The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 4,648. History Bartholomew Room in The Square Eynsham grew up near the historically important ford of Swinford on the River Thames flood plain. Excavations have shown that the site was used in the Bronze Age for a rectilinear enclosure on the edge of the gravel terrace. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records Eynsham as Egonesham and describes it as one of four towns that the Saxons captured from the Britons in AD 571. Evidence has been found of 6th and 7th-century Saxon buildings at New Wintles Farm, about three- quarters of a mile (1 km) from the present parish church. There is some evidence that Eynsham had an early minster, probably founded in the 7th or 8th centuries. The name is recorded in AD 864 (in the dative) as Egenes homme, i. e. \\"√Ügen's enclosure or river-meadow\\". In 1005 Aethelmar, kinsman of Aethelred II founded a Benedictine abbey on the site of the earlier minster. The first abbot was √Ülfric of Eynsham, a prolific writer in Old English. The Domesday Book of 1086 includes a paragraph about the settlement, then known as Eglesham.Eynsham, Some interesting and notable dates in the history of our village By 1302 Eynsham had a wharf handling cargo that included hay, straw, malt, grain and timber, beside the later Talbot Inn on Wharf Stream, a tributary of the Thames. By the medieval period Eynsham Abbey was one of the largest in the area, but it was dissolved at the Reformation in 1538 and only a few remains can still be seen. After the dissolution, the abbey estates were given to Sir George Darcy.Eynsham, Some interesting and notable dates in the history of our village By 1790 a newly completed Oxford Canal was trading with Eynsham Wharf, mainly to sell coal from the Midlands. From 1792 the Oxford Canal employed a wharfinger at Eynsham and in 1800 it bought the lease of the wharf. The Oxford Canal consolidated its position at Eynsham by buying the Talbot Inn in 1845 and the freehold of Eynsham Wharf in 1849, perhaps in response to the Railway mania that was beginning to take traffic from canals and navigations. Eynsham Lock is on the Thames just above the confluence with Wharf Stream. This was the last flash lock on the Thames, not rebuilt as a pound lock until 1928. Map of the village The village suffered a number of fires in its history. Two of the most serious were one on the morning of Whit Monday 1629 that destroyed 12 houses and another in 1681 that destroyed 20 houses. By the early 19th century the parish had its own fire engine ‚Äì from then until 1949 the ground floor of the early 18th-century Bartholomew Room served as the parish fire station. The Bartholomew Room was built in 1703 out of an endowment from John Liam Bartholomew in 1701 to found a charity school for the parish. Its lower storey was arcaded, presumably to serve as a market building. The arcades were walled up in the latter part of the 19th century. While some of the ground floor continued to serve as the fire station, another was turned into a village gaol. From 1928, the local Roman Catholic congregation used the upper room for its services. In 1983 the parish council bought and restored the building. Roads Swinford Bridge over the Thames By the mid-18th century, Swinford had a ferry, but the main road was in poor condition. Heavier road traffic between Oxford and Witney preferred to pass further north via Bladon, where the better-maintained Oxford‚ÄìWoodstock and Witney‚ÄìWoodstock roads met. When the latter became a turnpike in 1751, the road via Eynsham and Swinford ferry was included as a branch. In 1769 the Earl of Abingdon opened Swinford Toll Bridge to replace the ferry. The Witney‚ÄìWoodstock road ceased to be a turnpike in 1869, but the Witney‚ÄìOxford road remained one until 1877. Eynsham was a major coaching stop on the London‚ÄìFishguard road. Since 1922 this has been classified as the A40. In 1936 a bypass for the main road was built north of the village, and the road over Swinford bridge reclassified as the B4044. Rail The Witney Railway between Witney and Yarnton opened through Eynsham parish in 1861. The station was on the south side of the village. The Great Western Railway took over the line in 1890 and enlarged Eynsham station in 1944. British Railways closed the line to passenger trains in 1962. In 1970 the line closed also to goods traffic and the track was dismantled. The station has since been demolished and a business park built on the site. In February 2015 the Witney Oxford Transport Group proposed reopening the station as an alternative to improvements to the A40 road proposed by Oxfordshire County Council. The case centred on the severe traffic congestion on the roads to and from Oxford. Industry Local industries include gravel extraction and a large factory for superconducting magnets, Siemens Magnet Technology Ltd.Company site. Retrieved 9 July 2019. Churches Church of England The Church of England parish church of Saint Leonard was built the 13th century. In the 15th century the nave was rebuilt, a clerestory and north aisle were added and the west tower was built. There are Mass dials on the south wall. The building has been restored three times: by William Wilkinson in 1856, Harry Drinkwater in 1892 and over a period of eight years in the 1980s. The west tower has a ring of six bells. James Keene of Woodstock cast the third bell in 1653. Richard Keene cast the fifth bell in 1673. John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast or recast the treble, second, fourth and tenor bells in 1895. The church has also a Sanctus bell that Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast in 1924. St Leonard's is a Grade II* listed building. Eynsham Baptist Church Baptist The Baptist church in Lombard Street was opened in either 1808 or 1818. Roman Catholic In 1895 Herbert May founded a Roman Catholic mission at his home, Newland Lodge. The lodge burnt down in 1897, after which Mass was said at the Railway Inn until May had a new house built for him. The mission closed when May moved to Oxford. In 1928 the Roman Catholic parish of Witney leased the upper storey of the Bartholomew Room, making it St. Peter's Chapel. Building of a new Roman Catholic church was begun in the 1930s but was delayed by the Second World War and not completed until 1967. Amenities Local industries include gravel extraction and the large superconducting magnet factory, Siemens Magnet Technology Ltd. There is also a business park on the village outskirts.

It became notable after World War II as the hangout for rock climbers with many spending months there‚Äînot necessarily legally. It is located near Yosemite Falls, on the north side of the valley. There is a single parking lot at the campground, and no driveways connecting to individual campsites, so visitors must carry their gear in. Nearby boulders have long been used for bouldering. Among the boulders located here, the Columbia Boulder is probably the most famous. On it is the boulder problem called the Midnight Lightning first done by Ron Kauk in 1978. It is easily recognizable by a painting of a white thunderbolt next to it.  History  Physically unimpressive, Camp 4 was nevertheless a center of rock climbing development during the middle of the 20th century. Dozens of the most famous climbers in the world congregated at Camp 4 for years, learning from each other and trying out new ideas on Yosemite walls such as Half Dome and El Capitan. Some, such as Yvon Chouinard, made and sold climbing equipment in the camp's parking lot, laying the foundation for successful businesses later. Camp 4 was the site of ongoing friction between climbers and the National Park Service. The conflict came to a head in 1997, when flooding in Yosemite Valley destroyed many employee housing units. The Park Service decided to build a three-story dormitory complex at Camp 4, effectively eliminating the campground. Tom Frost financed and led the fight to save Camp 4, with help from attorney Richard Duane. Together, Frost and Duane filed a lawsuit against the National Park Service to save the historic rock climber campsite, and convinced the American Alpine Club to add their name to the list of plaintiffs. Climbers and mountaineering associations all over the world wrote letters in support, arguing that Camp 4 was one of the three most famous climbing base camps on earth, alongside Everest Basecamp and a similar site at Chamonix in the Alps. The effort was successful. On February 21, 2003, Camp 4 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places for \\"its significant association with the growth and development of rock climbing in the Yosemite Valley during the 'golden years' of pioneer mountaineering\\". From 1971 to 1999, Camp 4 was officially known as Sunnyside Walk-in Campground, but has been since renamed Camp 4 in recognition of its historic status. On June 14, 2012, the Superintendent of Yosemite National Park released a comprehensive rockfall hazard report for Yosemite Valley floor. The 96-page scientific report by an interdisciplinary team of geologists and rockfall-hazard specialists concludes that several campsites on the northern side of Camp 4 need to be relocated to achieve adequate safety for climbers.  Reservations and availability  Camp 4 does not offer traditional reservations at any time during the year, and the process for attaining a camping site differs depending on the season. In 2019, a lottery system was enacted for the peak season of late May through mid-September. Only those applications successfully drawn in the lottery are assigned campsites during the lottery period. Outside of the daily lottery window (i.e. from late September through mid-May), site assignments are first-come, first-served. In spring and fall, a line of those wishing to camp here typically forms at the campground kiosk early in the morning. A total of 36 sites are available daily, each accommodating a maximum of six people (i.e., 216 spots total) at a cost of US$6 per person per night. Notably, the Park Service has imposed a 30-night camping limit within Yosemite National Park per calendar year; however, from 1 May to 15 September, the camping limit in Yosemite is 14 nights, with only seven of those nights allowed in Yosemite Valley or Wawona. Because of the popularity of the camp, the relatively small number of camp sites, and the lack of reservation availability, it can be difficult to be able to camp at this campground, except for the winter season, which is less busy.

It was released on August 30, 1993 by Music for Nations in Europe and by Metal Blade Records in the US. Elements was reissued by Relapse Records in 2005 and was digitally remastered with the addition of six bonus tracks. Eduardo Rivadavia described the album for Allmusic as remaining \\"admirably true to the band's famously complicated arrangements, syncopated rhythms, and ultra-precise attack, but also boast[ing] a cleaner musicality never before attempted by the group\\". Elements was written, recorded and mixed in forty days in Pro Media Studios.Elements at Encyclopaedia Metallum The band wanted to dissolve but they were required to finish their third album in order to fulfill a contract to their record label. Elements features the addition of a third guitarist, Frank Emmi. Initially, Rand Burkey was not going to appear on the album, and as Kelly Shaefer had developed carpal tunnel syndrome, (preventing him from playing anything but rhythm guitar) a new lead guitar player was needed. Before recording, Burkey rejoined the band, and thus the band ended up with three guitarists. Shaefer plays rhythm guitar, while Emmi and Burkey share responsibilities for leads and solos. Elements was Atheist's last studio album for 17 years, until the 2010 release of Jupiter. Critical reception Elements was described by James Hinchcliffe in Terrorizer as \\"less frantic and jazz-leaning than Unquestionable Presence, and packed with unexpectedly Latin rhythms\\" that caused the album to \\"hurtle...to the edge of metal\\".

For heart failure, it is generally used with a diuretic, such as furosemide. It is given by mouth or by injection into a vein. Onset of effects are typically within an hour when taken by mouth and last for up to a day. Common side effects include headache, tiredness, feeling lightheaded with standing, and cough. Serious side effects include angioedema and low blood pressure. Use during pregnancy is believed to result in harm to the baby. It is in the angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitor family of medications. Enalapril was patented in 1978, and came into medical use in 1984. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2017, it was the 122nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than six million prescriptions. Medical uses Enalapril three-dimensional structure Enalapril is used to treat hypertension, symptomatic heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction.U.S. National Library of Medicine. Last Revised October 1, 2010 MedlinePlus: Enalapril It has been proven to protect the function of the kidneys in hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes, and may be used in the absence of hypertension for its kidney protective effects. It is widely used in chronic kidney failure. Furthermore, enalapril is an emerging treatment for psychogenic polydipsia. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that when used for this purpose, enalapril led to decreased water consumption (determined by urine output and osmolality) in 60% of patients. Pregnancy and breastfeeding Enalapril is pregnancy category D. Some evidence suggests it will cause injury and death to a developing fetus. Patients are advised not to become pregnant while taking enalapril and to notify their doctors immediately if they become pregnant. In pregnancy, enalapril may result in damage to the fetus's kidneys and resulting oligohydramnios (not enough amniotic fluid). Enalapril is secreted in breast milk and is not recommended for use while breastfeeding. Side effects The most common side effects of enalapril include increased serum creatinine (20%), dizziness (2‚Äì8%), low blood pressure (1‚Äì7%), syncope (2%), and dry cough (1‚Äì2%). The most serious common adverse event is angioedema (swelling) (0.68%) which often affects the face and lips, endangering the patient's airway. Angioedema can occur at any point during treatment with enalapril, but is most common after the first few doses. Angioedema and fatality therefrom are reportedly higher among black people. Mechanism of action Normally, angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II by an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). Angiotensin II constricts blood vessels, increasing blood pressure. Enalaprilat, the active metabolite of enalapril, inhibits ACE. Inhibition of ACE decreases levels of angiotensin II, leading to less vasoconstriction and decreased blood pressure. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic data of enalapril: * Onset of action: about 1 hour * Peak effect: 4‚Äì6 hours * Duration: 12‚Äì24 hours * Absorption: ~60% * Metabolism: prodrug, undergoes biotransformation to enalaprilatMenard J and Patchett A.

Academic Press, 2001. . Pg 30 History Squibb developed the first ACE inhibitor, captopril, but it had adverse effects such as a metallic taste (which, as it turned out, was due to the sulfhydryl group). Merck & Co. developed enalapril as a competing prodrug. Enalaprilat was developed partly to overcome these limitations of captopril. The sulfhydryl moiety was replaced by a carboxylate moiety, but additional modifications were required in its structure-based design to achieve a potency similar to captopril. Enalaprilat, however, had a problem of its own in that it had poor oral availability. This was overcome by the researchers at Merck by the esterification of enalaprilat with ethanol to produce enalapril. Merck introduced enalapril to market in 1981; it became Merck's first billion dollar-selling drug in 1988. The patent expired in 2000, opening the way for generics.Staff, Drug Discovery Online.

Often it happens in the context of a pneumonia, injury, or chest surgery. It is one of the various kinds of pleural effusion. There are three stages: exudative, when there is an increase in pleural fluid with or without the presence of pus; fibrinopurulent, when fibrous septa form localized pus pockets; and the final organizing stage, when there is scarring of the pleura membranes with possible inability of the lung to expand. Simple pleural effusions occur in up to 40% of bacterial pneumonias. They are usually small and resolve with appropriate antibiotic therapy. If however an empyema develops additional intervention is required.  Signs and symptoms  The clinical presentation of both the adult and pediatric patient with pleural empyema depends upon several factors, including the causative micro-organism. Most cases present themselves in the setting of a pneumonia, although up to one third of patients do not have clinical signs of pneumonia and as many as 25% of cases are associated with trauma (including surgery). Typical symptoms include cough, chest pain, shortness of breath and fever.  Diagnosis  The initial investigations for suspected empyema remains chest X-ray, although it cannot differentiate an empyema from uninfected parapneumonic effusion. Ultrasound must be used to confirm the presence of a pleural fluid collection and can be used to estimate the size of the effusion, differentiate between free and loculated pleural fluid and guide thoracocentesis if necessary. Chest CT and MRI do not provide additional information in most cases and should therefore not be performed routinely. On a CT scan, empyema fluid most often has a radiodensity of about 0-20 Hounsfield units (HU), but gets over 30 HU when becoming more thickened with time. The most often used \\"golden\\" criteria for empyema are pleural effusion with macroscopic presence of pus, a positive Gram stain or culture of pleural fluid, or a pleural fluid pH under 7.2 with normal peripheral blood pH. Clinical guidelines for adult patients therefore advocate diagnostic pleural fluid aspiration in patients with pleural effusion in association with sepsis or pneumonic illness. Because pleural effusion in the pediatric population is almost always parapneumonic and the need for chest tube drainage can be made on clinical grounds, British guidelines for the management of pleural infection in children do not recommend diagnostic pleural fluid sampling. Blood and sputum culture has often already been performed in the setting of community acquired pneumonia needing hospitalization. It should however be noted that the micro-organism responsible for development of empyema is not necessarily the same as the organism causing the pneumonia, especially in adults. As already mentioned before, sensitivity of pleural fluid culture is generally low, often partly due to prior administration of antibiotics. It has been shown that culture yield can be increased from 44% to 69% if pleural fluid is injected into blood culture bottles (aerobic and anaerobic) immediately after aspiration. Furthermore, diagnostic rates can be improved for specific pathogens using polymerase chain reaction or antigen detection, especially for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. In a study including 78 children with pleural empyema, the causative micro-organism could be identified using direct culture of fresh pleural fluid in 45% of patients, with an additional 28% using PCR on pleural fluid of negative cultures. Pneumococcal antigen detection in pleural fluid samples by latex agglutination can also be useful for rapid diagnosis of pneumococcal empyema. In the previously noted study, positive and negative predictive value of pneumococcal antigen detection was 95% and 90%, respectively. However, despite the additional diagnostic value of these tests, PCR and antigen detection have limited value in determining treatment choice because of the lack of information on antibiotic resistance.

This has been shown to improve resolution of the infection and shorten hospital admission. Data from a meta-analysis has shown that a pleural fluid pH of <7.2 is the most powerful indicator to predict the need for chest tube drainage in patients with non-purulent, culture negative fluid. Other indications for drainage include poor clinical progress during treatment with antibiotics alone and patients with a loculated pleural collection. Because of the viscous, lumpy nature of infected pleural fluid, in combination with possible septation and loculation, it has been proposed that intrapleural fibrinolytic or mucolytic therapy might improve drainage and therefore might have a positive effect on the clinical outcome. Intrapleural fibrinolysis with urokinase decreased the need for surgery but there is a trend to increased serious side effects. Approximately 15 to 40 percent of people require surgical drainage of the infected pleural space because of inadequate drainage due to clogging of the chest tube or loculated empyema. Patients should thus be considered for surgery if they have ongoing signs of sepsis in association with a persistent pleural collection despite drainage and antibiotics. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is used as a first-line therapy in many hospitals, although open thoracic drainage remains a frequently used alternative technique.  Antibiotics There is no readily available evidence on the route of administration and duration of antibiotics in patients with pleural empyema. Experts agree that all patients should be hospitalized and treated with antibiotics intravenously. The specific antimicrobial agent should be chosen based on Gram stain and culture, or on local epidemiologic data when these are not available. Anaerobic coverage must be included in all adults, and in children if aspiration is likely. Good pleural fluid and empyema penetration has been reported in adults for penicillins, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, clindamycin, vancomycin, gentamycin and ciprofloxacin. Aminoglycosides should typically be avoided as they have poor penetration into the pleural space. There is no clear consensus on duration of intravenous and oral therapy. Switching to oral antibiotics can be considered upon clinical and objective improvement (adequate drainage and removal of chest tube, declining CRP, temperature normalization). Oral antibiotic treatment should then be continued for another 1‚Äì4 weeks, again based on clinical, biochemical and radiological response.  Prognosis  All patients with empyema require outpatient follow-up with a repeat chest X-ray and inflammatory biochemistry analysis within 4 weeks following discharge. Chest radiograph returns to normal in the majority of patients by 6 months. Patients should, of course, be advised to return sooner if symptoms redevelop. Long-term sequelae of pleural empyema are rare but include bronchopleural fistula formation, recurrent empyema and pleural thickening, which may lead to functional lung impairment needing surgical decortication. Approximately 15% of adult patients with pleural infection die within 1 year of the event, although deaths are usually due to comorbid conditions and not directly due to sepsis from the empyema. Mortality in children is generally reported to be less than 3%. No reliable clinical, radiological or pleural fluid characteristics accurately determine patients‚Äô prognosis at initial presentation.  Epidemiology  The incidence of pleural empyema and the prevalence of specific causative microorganisms varies depending on the source of infection (community acquired vs. hospital acquired pneumonia), the age of the patient and host immune status. Risk factors include alcoholism, drug use, HIV infection, neoplasm and pre-existent pulmonary disease. Pleural empyema was found in 0.7% of 3675 patients needing hospitalization for a community acquired pneumonia in a recent Canadian single-center prospective study. A multi-center study from the UK including 430 adult patients with community acquired pleural empyema found negative pleural-fluid cultures in 54% of patients, Streptococcus milleri group in 16%, Staphylococcus aureus in 12%, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 8%, other Streptococci in 7% and anaerobic bacteria in 8%. Given the difficulties in culturing anaerobic bacteria the frequency of the latter (including mixed infections) might be underestimated. The risk of empyema in children seems to be comparable to adults. Using the United States Kids‚Äô Inpatient Database the incidence is calculated to be around 1.5% in children hospitalized for community acquired pneumonia, although percentages up to 30% have been reported in individual hospitals, a difference which may be explained by an transient endemic of highly invasive serotype or overdiagnosis of small parapneumonic effusions. The distribution of causative organisms does differ greatly from that in adults: in an analysis of 78 children with community acquired pleural empyema, no micro-organism was found in 27% of patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae in 51%, Streptococcus pyogenes in 9% and Staphylococcus aureus in 8%. Although pneumococcal vaccination dramatically decreased the incidence of pneumonia in children, it did not have this effect on the incidence of complicated pneumonia. It has been shown that the incidence of empyema in children was already on the rise at the end of the 20th century, and that the widespread use of pneumococcal vaccination did not slow down this trend. This might in part be explained by a change in prevalence of (more invasive) pneumococcal serotypes, some of which are not covered by the vaccine, as well a rise in incidence of pneumonia caused by other streptococci and staphylococci. The incidence of empyema seems to be rising in the adult population as well, albeit at a slower rate.

These boxes are specialized pieces of equipment belonging to the grip department, and should not be confused with simple crates, other boxes, or boxes for apples. Uses As one of the most ubiquitous and useful pieces of equipment on a film set, apple boxes are used for anything that needs to be propped up or supported temporarily. They can be used to prop up furniture and light stands, for leveling camera dolly track, or to provide temporary seats, workbenches, or stepladders. Often the need arises to make an actor appear taller, either because of their height, or to fit with the composition of a particular shot. In this use apple boxes are jokingly referred to as \\"man makers\\". Apple boxes were originally used for storage. They would have a forward opening in the box and it could be used as a double storage device for small necessary things. Sizes Full apple (also referred to as just an \\"apple box\\") 20\\"√ó12\\"√ó8\\" Half apple 20\\"√ó12\\"√ó4\\" Quarter apple 20\\"√ó12\\"√ó2\\" Pancake (eighth apple) 20\\"√ó12\\"√ó1\\" Nesting apple boxes fit the three smaller sizes into the full apple (which does not have the standard midway internal support crossbeam). To accommodate the smaller internal dimensions, the half, quarter and pancake are only 18 1/2\\" long √ó 10\\" wide. Half length \\"mini\\" apple boxes are now manufactured. Mini apple box 10\\"√ó12\\"√ó8\\" Mini half 10\\"√ó12\\"√ó4\\" Mini quarter 10\\"√ó12\\"√ó2\\" Mini pancake/eighth 10\\"√ó12\\"√ó1\\" Apple box sizes vary somewhat depending on manufacturer, but all sizes are designed to be fractions of the \\"full apple\\" size. Thus two half apples exactly equal the size of a full apple, two quarters equals one half, and two pancakes equal one quarter. This modular design is often critically important as many applications require mixes of sizes. Position Often when a grip is placing an apple box others are lifting something heavy to put on top of it, thus arose the need for terms describing what position the apple box should be placed in (i.e., which side of the apple box should be placed face-down). It is rare that these terms are used for anything other than the \\"full apple\\" size. New York: Positioned so the apple box is tallest, like the tall buildings in New York, 20\\" high. Texas/Chicago: Positioned so the apple box is resting on its longest narrow side, 12\\" high. LA: Positioned so the apple box is flattest, 8\\" high. Regional variations exist for the colloquial names of these positions are referred to as 1/2/3, New York/Chicago/LA, or Manhattan/Brooklyn/Queens Basso blocks Basso blocks are a stacking variant of conventional apple boxes. Their design gives the same elevation ability of Apples, but takes 66% less storage space. A full set of Basso Blocks is equivalent to twelve 1/2 Apples. A set of 1/2 Basso Blocks is equivalent to twenty-four 1/4 Apples. Elephant blocks are a three legged stable update to Basso Blocks that allow 1\\" elevation increments.

During a 15-year Major League Baseball (MLB) career, he pitched from 1953 to 1967 for seven different teams: the St. Louis Browns / Baltimore Orioles (1953‚Äì54; 1965), New York Yankees (1955‚Äì1959), Kansas City Athletics (1960‚Äì1961), Chicago White Sox (1961), San Francisco Giants (1962‚Äì1964), Houston Colt .45's / Houston Astros (1964‚Äì65), and Chicago Cubs (1967). Larsen pitched the sixth perfect game in MLB history, doing so in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series. It is the only no-hitter and perfect game in World Series history and is one of only two no-hitters in MLB postseason history (the other being Roy Halladay's in 2010). He won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award and Babe Ruth Award in recognition of his 1956 postseason. Early life Larsen was born in Michigan City, Indiana.Goldstein, Richard. \\"Don Larsen, Yankee Who Pitched Only Perfect Game in World Series History, Dies at 90\\". The New York Times. January 1, 2020. Larsen's family moved to San Diego, California in 1944, where his mother became a housekeeper and his father worked as a department store salesman.Paper (2009), p. 11. Larsen attended Point Loma High School where he was a member of the basketball and baseball teams.Paper (2009), p. 12. He was selected for the All-Metro Conference team as a basketball player, and was offered several college scholarships to play basketball. In baseball, Larsen's ability for the local American Legion team caught the attention of St. Louis Browns scout Art Schwartz. Schwartz signed Larsen to a contract to play for one of the Browns minor league teams in 1947, with Larsen receiving a $850 signing bonus ($ in current dollar terms). Larsen, on why he signed with the Browns over attending college, later said that he was \\"never much with the studies\\". Minor league baseball and military career Larsen started his career with the Aberdeen Pheasants of the Class-C Northern League in 1947, appearing in 16 games. He had a 4‚Äì3 win-loss record and a 3.42 earned run average (ERA). The next season with Aberdeen, he won 17 games and had a 3.75 ERA in 34 games. Larsen started the 1949 season pitching for the Globe-Miami Browns of the Class-C Arizona‚ÄìTexas League, before he moved up the minor league hierarchy, playing for the Springfield Browns in the Class-B Illinois‚ÄìIndiana‚ÄìIowa League, and the Wichita Falls Spudders of the Class-B Big State League for the first half of the 1950 season. Larsen was promoted to the Wichita Indians of the Class-A Western League in the second half of the 1950 season. With the Indians, Larsen had a 6‚Äì4 record with a 3.14 ERA in 21 games. In 1951, Larsen was drafted to the United States Army for the Korean War. He spent the next two years in the Army, working in a variety of non- combat jobs. He was discharged from the Army in 1953 and made the St. Louis Browns roster prior to the beginning of the season. Early major league career St. Louis Browns/Baltimore Orioles Larsen as a member of the Baltimore Orioles in 1954. Larsen made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with a start against the Detroit Tigers on April 17, 1953. He pitched five innings, giving up three earned runs, while striking out three in a no decision in an 8‚Äì7 Browns win. He had his first career win a little less than a month later, on May 12, against the Philadelphia Athletics, pitching innings and giving up one earned run in a 7‚Äì3 win. For his rookie season, Larsen finished with a 7‚Äì12 record, 4.16 ERA and 96 strikeouts in 38 games, 22 of them starts. He finished first on the team in innings pitched () and complete games (7) and second on the team in strikeouts. Larsen also allowed the most hits with 202, and earned runs (89) on the squad. He also broke a major league record for pitchers by having seven consecutive hits at one point. He batted .284 with 3 home runs in 81 at bats in his rookie year. The Browns relocated to Baltimore for the 1954 season, becoming the Baltimore Orioles. In 1954, Larsen went 3‚Äì21 with a 4.37 earned run average and 80 strikeouts in 29 games. He led the major leagues in losses and finished third in the league in earned runs allowed (98). The Orioles won only 54 games that season, while having 100 losses, and finished the season in seventh place. Two of Larsen's three wins were against the New York Yankees, including a 10‚Äì0 shutout on July 30, his last win of the season. His other victory was against the Chicago White Sox on May 30.  Trade to the Yankees  In 1954, the New York Yankees, despite winning 103 games, finished second behind the Cleveland Indians in the American League. Yankees general manager George Weiss blamed the age of their pitching staff for their performance. The Yankees‚Äô ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù pitching staff of the late 1940s and early 1950s, Vic Raschi, Ed Lopat and Allie Reynolds, were in their late thirties, and wearing down. Raschi was traded to the Cardinals prior to the season, Reynolds retired because of a back injury and Lopat was ineffective and retired within a year. Two other pitchers in the staff, Johnny Sain and Tommy Byrne were also near the end of their careers. Desperate for young starting pitching behind staff ace Whitey Ford and promising starter Bob Grim, Weiss managed to find a trade partner with the Orioles. At the end of the season, Larsen was traded by the Baltimore Orioles as part of a 17-player trade, with Billy Hunter, Bob Turley and players to be named later to the Yankees for, most prominently, catcher Gus Triandos, and outfielder Gene Woodling. When the trade was announced Turley was considered the key player in the trade. During the 1954 season, Turley had a 14‚Äì15 win- loss record with the Orioles, and some observers considered Turley to have the \\"liveliest fastball\\" in the league.Goldenbock (2010), p. 292 However, Weiss and Yankees manager Casey Stengel thought that Larsen had the most potential out of the two, having been impressed with Larsen's performance against the Yankees and demanded that he be included in the trade. New York Yankees As a member of the New York Yankees from 1955 through 1959, Larsen was used by manager Casey Stengel as a backup starter and occasional reliever. He went 45‚Äì24 during his five seasons in New York, making 90 starts in 128 appearances. 1955 season Larsen reported to spring training with a sore shoulder and pitched ineffectively to start the year.Golenbock (2010), p. 303 He was quickly demoted to the Denver Bears, and Larsen, visibly upset, decided to \\"take my sweet time\\" reporting to the Bears. After staying in St. Louis for a week, Larsen had a change of heart and reported to the team. Larsen spent most of the first four months of the season with the Bears, only pitching in five games for the Yankees during that timespan. During the 1955 season, Larsen participated in nineteen games, starting 13 of them. He had a 9‚Äì2 record with a 3.07 ERA and 44 strikeouts in 97 innings pitched. Larsen pitched a shutout against Jim Bunning and the Detroit Tigers on August 5, 1955. 1956 season In 1956 Larsen posted 11‚Äì5 record, with a career best 107 strikeouts and a 3.26 ERA. Larsen was used in between the bullpen and the starting rotation for most of the season, participating in 38 games, starting 20. Larsen had a rough start to the season, and by the end of May he had a 5.64 ERA. He gradually improved and by the beginning of August, Larsen lowered his ERA below 4.00. In a seven start stretch to finish the season, Larsen had five complete games, and pitched 10 innings in another. He pitched a four-hit shutout against his former team (Orioles) in the second game of a doubleheader on September 3. He finished the season with a 7‚Äì3 victory against the Boston Red Sox on September 28. =1956 World Series= The \\"everlasting image\\" of Yogi Berra leaping into Larsen's arms upon the completion of the perfect game Larsen's most notable accomplishment was pitching the only perfect game in World Series history; it is one of only 23 perfect games in MLB history. He was pitching for the New York Yankees in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series against the Brooklyn Dodgers on October 8, 1956. His perfect game remained the only no-hitter of any type pitched in postseason play until Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Roy Halladay threw a no-hitter against the Cincinnati Reds on October 6, 2010, in Game 1 of the National League Division Series. Stengel selected Larsen to start Game 2 of the Series. Despite being given a 6‚Äì0 lead by the Yankee batters, he lasted only innings in a 13‚Äì8 loss. He gave up only one hit, a single by Gil Hodges. He walked four batters and allowed four runs in the process but, because of an error by first baseman Joe Collins, none of the runs were earned. Larsen started Game 5 for the Yankees. Larsen's opponent in the game was Brooklyn's Sal Maglie. Larsen needed just 97 pitches to complete the perfect game, and only one Dodger batter (Pee Wee Reese in the first inning) was able to get a three-ball count. In 1998, Larsen recalled, \\"I had great control. I never had that kind of control in my life.\\" Brooklyn's Maglie gave up only two runs on five hits. Mickey Mantle's fourth-inning home run broke the scoreless tie. The Yankees added an insurance run in the sixth. After Roy Campanella grounded out to Billy Martin for the second out of the 9th inning, Larsen faced pinch hitter Dale Mitchell, a .312 career hitter. Throwing fastballs, Larsen got ahead in the count at 1‚Äì2. On his 97th pitch, a called third strike by home plate umpire Babe Pinelli, Larsen caught Mitchell looking for the 27th and last out.Note, though, that Larsen said on the The Tim McCarver Show, (airing March 5, 2014, on WCBS-FM, that Mitchell's check swing went around. After the pitch, catcher Yogi Berra leaped into Larsen's arms in celebration, setting up the \\"everlasting image\\". Larsen's unparalleled game earned him the World Series Most Valuable Player Award and Babe Ruth Award. When the World Series ended, Larsen did a round of endorsements and promotional work around the United States, but he stopped soon after because it was \\"disrupting his routine\\". 1957‚Äì1960 In 1957, Larsen had a 10‚Äì4 record with 3.74 ERA in 27 games, 20 of them starts. Larsen again had a bad start to the season, giving out four earned runs in innings pitched in his opening start against the Boston Red Sox. He gave up three consecutive hits to Gene Stephens, Gene Mauch and Sammy White to start the second inning, and after a sacrifice fly by pitcher Bob Porterfield, he gave up a double to Frank Malzone, knocking Larsen out of the game. On May 26, Larsen gave up four earned runs in less than one inning of work in a start against the Washington Senators. He started another game two days later against the Red Sox and by the end of the month his ERA was over 6. He improved by the end of the season, hurling a 3-hit shutout against the Kansas City Athletics on September 15. In the 1957 World Series against the Milwaukee Braves, he pitched seven innings in relief in Game 3, getting the win in a 12‚Äì3 lopsided defeat. He started the seventh game of the Series, lasting innings in a 5‚Äì0 loss as the Braves won the Series. Larsen won another World Series game in the 1958 World Series. Like the 1957 World Series, it went to a seventh game, and Larsen was New York's starting pitcher. Again he lasted just innings, taking a no-decision. Both the Yankees' and Don Larsen's fortunes would dip in 1959. New York slipped to third place and Don Larsen dropped below .500 for the first time in his Yankee career, going 6‚Äì7. He was traded to the Kansas City Athletics with Hank Bauer, Norm Siebern and Marv Throneberry for Roger Maris, Joe DeMaestri, and Kent Hadley. In July 1960, the Athletics sent Larsen back to the minors.  Later career  In 1961, Larsen went 8‚Äì2 while playing for both the Athletics and the Chicago White Sox, to whom he was traded in June 1961 with Andy Carey, Ray Herbert and Al Pilarcik for Wes Covington, Stan Johnson, Bob Shaw and Gerry Staley. After the 1961 season, Larsen was traded to the San Francisco Giants with Billy Pierce for Bob Farley, Eddie Fisher and Dom Zanni and a player to be named later (Verle Tiefenthaler). Larsen became a full-time relief pitcher, anchoring a strong bullpen that included Bobby Bolin and Stu Miller. He had five wins with 11 saves for the pennant-winning Giants. Larsen won the deciding game of the three-game playoff series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, relieving Juan Marichal in the eighth inning. In the 1962 World Series, Larsen won Game 4 pitching in relief, giving him a career World Series record of 4‚Äì2 with a 2.75 ERA. During his time with the Giants, Larsen earned the nickname of \\"Froggy\\" due to his hobby of hunting frogs and serving marinated frog legs to his Giants teammates. In 1964, the Giants sold Larsen to the Houston Colt .45s, who pressed Larsen back into a starting role. He responded with a 4‚Äì8 record and a 2.27 ERA. In 1965, he was traded to the Orioles for Bob Saverine and cash. The Orioles released him prior to the 1966 season, and he pitched the year for the Phoenix Giants of the Class-AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) in the San Francisco minor league organization. Larsen was on the Chicago Cubs roster for two weeks of the 1967 season, pitching only four innings in what would be his final stint in the major leagues. He spent the rest of the season with the Dallas-Fort Worth Spurs of the Class-AA Texas League. Larsen started the 1968 season in the Cubs' minor league system, pitching for the San Antonio Missions of the Texas League and Tacoma Cubs of the PCL, before retiring in the summer. Larsen hit well for a pitcher, finishing his career with a .242 average, 14 home runs and 72 runs batted in. One of his four-baggers matched his famous achievement on the mound, and in the same season, as he stroked a grand slam against the Boston Red Sox on 22 April 1956 in a game in which he pitched 4 innings. He was regarded well enough by his managers that he was used as a pinch hitter 66 times.  Pitching style  In his prime, Larsen was an athletically built (6'4\\", 215 lb), right-handed overhand power pitcher, who admitted to having poorer control than most pitchers in his era, but he trusted the framing by Yogi Berra to set him to aim low and outside batters, and mostly across the body. He was also known to have no windup or leg kick, a technique usually used by modern pitchers when there are runners on base. Because his action was so compact and he did not throw many changeups or breaking balls, runners could not easily steal on him. He could get hit for home runs with relative ease if his control was off.  Life after playing  Larsen at a Yankees fan fair in 2007 Roy Halladay and Don Larsen, the only two pitchers to throw postseason no-hitters in MLB history After retiring from baseball, Larsen attempted to work in the front office of a major league organization, and as a liquor salesman; neither career worked out. He became an executive for a paper company, working with farmers who worked in California's Salinas Valley. In 1964, Larsen was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego's finest athletes both on and off the playing surface. Larsen, with writer Mark Shaw, released an autobiography, The Perfect Yankee: The Incredible Story of the Greatest Miracle in Baseball History that was published in 1996. Larsen was in Yankee Stadium for two of baseball's 21 modern perfect games: his own in 1956, and David Cone's in 1999. Cone's game took place on Yogi Berra Day; Larsen threw out the ceremonial first pitch to Berra before the game. Larsen later said that Cone's perfect game was the first game he had seen in person from start to finish since his retirement.All Time Games, Don Larsen's Perfect Game, aired on MLB Network on January 1, 2009 Personal life and death Larsen married his first wife, Vivian, in 1955, out of a sense of duty after she became pregnant with his child. The day of his perfect game, she was in court suing him for unpaid alimony. They were divorced in 1957. Larsen and his second wife, Corrine, were married for over 60 years. They lived in Hayden Lake, Idaho. It was reported in 2012 that he put up for auction the uniform he had worn to pitch his perfect game to pay for expenses of his grandchildren's college education. Larsen died on January 1, 2020, from esophageal cancer at the age of 90. Personality Larsen was known for his personality and his enjoyment of the nightlife, specifically in New York City. During his time in minor league baseball, Larsen first developed a reputation as a \\"fun-loving guy\\" who liked to go out to bars and have a drink, according to teammate Bob Turley.Paper (2009), p. 13 When he broke into the Majors with the St. Louis Browns, Larsen started violating a time-limit curfew that was set by managers Marty Marion and then Jimmy Dykes. He was nicknamed \\"Gooneybird\\" for his antics.

Other types of full toss are rarely deliberate, as they can be very easy to hit. A low full toss is frequently the result of an error made while attempting to bowl a yorker, which bounces at the batsman's feet. Occasionally a full toss can surprise a batsman so effectively that he is unable to play it properly, and this can lead to a wicket, but few bowlers rely on this.

At the 2016 Census, Doncaster East had a population of 28,360. It is located in the hills between the Koonung Creek and the Mullum Mullum Creek. History The area was originally occupied by the Wurundjeri, Indigenous Australians of the Kulin nation, who spoke variations of the Woiwurrung language group. After European settlement, the area was used for agriculture, predominantly orchards. A small settlement was established in the 1860s, known as Waldau, which was home to many German settlers, who planted the large areas of pine trees that still exist today. German Lane was the original name for George Street, and Bismarck Street the original name for Victoria Street. The names were replaced during the First World War and the present names adopted. The Post Office opened on 8 August 1887. A Tunstall Square office was open from 1965 until 1990. Like much of the City of Manningham, Doncaster East was predominantly covered in fruit orchards for some time before subdivision began and it became a contiguous part of Melbourne. Housing estates began to replace orchards in the 1960s, generally along Doncaster Road, in the southern half of the suburb. The north half of the suburb was developed through the 1970s and 1980s, with the last orchard being removed in the 1990s. As the young parents who moved into these estates now retire and move away, many houses from the 60s and 70s are being converted into units. Geography The area of land that is occupied by Doncaster East mostly consists of rolling hills, creek valleys and short ridges. Andersons Creek Road runs along an unnamed ridge that, when atop, gives views of Mount Dandenong to the east and the further rolling hills of Templestowe to the west. Three main watercourses flow through or border the suburb: *Mullum Mullum Creek *Koonung Creek * Ruffey Creek The native vegetation of Doncaster East has been almost totally cleared, notable exceptions being the north-east of the suburb around the Mullum Mullum Creek, where small areas of native riparian bushland remain. Many small areas of Pine Trees were planted by early German settlers and can be found all over the suburb, particularly around George and Victoria Streets and to the south-east, in many places they were used as wind breaks or property boundaries for agriculture and serve as a good indicator of historical property boundaries. Many European deciduous trees were planted in the 1970s and 1980s and have since matured on roadsides and on private properties. Invasive species remain as one of the suburbs major environmental problems. Political geography The suburb boundaries roughly form the shape of an L flipped horizontally, bordered by Wetherby Road, Victoria Street and Blackburn Road to the west, adjoining Doncaster and Templestowe, the Mullum Mullum Creek, Springvale Road and Tunstall Road in the east, adjoining Warrandyte and Donvale and the Koonung Creek to the south, adjoining Blackburn North. The north-east section of the suburb sits on the western side of the Mullum Mullum Valley and is very occasionally referred to as being whole or part of West Warrandyte and rarer still, East Templestowe. There are many small anecdotal localities that have established individual community identities within the suburb, some of these include: *Donburn - Around the Blackburn Road/Doncaster Road intersection. *Deep Creek - The northernmost area of the suburb, near the Mullum Mullum Creek. *Milgate - Milgate Park and surrounds. *Tunstall - Around Tunstall Square and Tunstall Road. *Waldau - Historically, the area surrounding George and Victoria Streets. *The Pines - The area north of The Pines Shopping Centre. The Mullum Mullum Creek in Doncaster East Community Doncaster East has had a significant Chinese minority for many years. Therefore, there are a number of Chinese restaurants, notable in quality and quantity for being outside Chinatown in Little Bourke Street. The suburb contains a fitness centre, Anglican, Baptist, Catholic, Gospel, Islamic and Uniting places of worship, an athletics track, three Australian rules football/cricket ovals, soccer grounds, small to medium commercial services, a childcare centre, kindergarten, library, indoor sporting facilities, various playgrounds, retirement villages, medical centres, a small community hall, Donvale Rehabilitation Centre, many restaurants and strip shops and The Pines Shopping Centre. Shopping Strips and Centres in Doncaster East include: *Stockland The Pines *Donburn Shops *Jackson Court *Devon Plaza *Commercial Services either side of Doncaster Road, near the intersection of Blackburn Road. *Tunstall Square Transportation Reynolds Road heading towards the crossing of the Mullum Mullum Creek and over into Warrandyte, 2004 Public transportation in the City of Manningham consists of regular bus services that cover most of the suburb. Plans for a railway line to Doncaster East were scrapped by the Cain Labor Government and as a result local residents rely heavily on the use of cars. The suburb is serviced primarily by the Eastern Freeway to the south and Reynolds Road in the north. Through traffic consists primarily of cars and buses traveling to neighbouring Warrandyte and Donvale through the use of Heidelberg - Warrandyte Road, Reynolds Road and Tindals Road (Old Warrandyte Road) Within the suburban boundaries, Doncaster East is serviced by George Street, King Street and Victoria Street. Running north-south is Blackburn Road, which holds most of the flow of traffic during weekday peak hour times, together with Springvale Road, as residents travel from their homes to the Eastern Freeway and into the city. Education * Beverley Hills Primary School, located on Cassowary Street, is a government primary school, established in 1959. * Ss Peter & Paul‚Äôs School, located on Beverley Street, is a Catholic primary school, established in 1960. * Donburn Primary School, located on Colchester, is a government primary school, established in 1973. * East Doncaster Secondary College, located on George Street, is a government secondary school, established in 1974. * Milgate Primary School, located on Landscape Drive, is a government primary school, established in 1982. * Doncaster Gardens Primary School, located on Sandhurst Avenue, is a government primary school, established in 1997 through the merging of Waldau Primary School and Doncaster East Primary School. Development The EastLink tollway project, which extends the Eastern Freeway to Ringwood and then south to join with the Monash and Mornington Peninsula Freeways, was completed and opened in 2008. It enables residents of Doncaster East increased ease of travel when travelling through Melbourne's eastern and south-eastern suburbs. Certain areas of land are currently awaiting development, including the former Box Hill Institute of TAFE's East Doncaster campus, now a newly subdivided small housing estate and a large area surrounding the Cherry Hill Tavern, which is proposed for a reception centre. There are several vacant blocks of land in the suburb, many surrounding The Pines Shopping Centre. Various uses have been proposed and many applications for restaurants or fast food providers have been met with opposition from surrounding residents. Sport and recreation Many people are active members of certain clubs or facilities in Doncaster East. Popular activities include Scouts, Athletics, Football (AFL), Soccer, Lawn Bowls, Walking, Bike Riding and Dog Walking. The waters of the Mullum Mullum Creek are too shallow for swimming in the summer months, however, this does not stop exploration or walks on the paths around the creek. Doncaster Rovers Soccer Club (not to be confused with the English club of the same name) are based in Doncaster East. Founded in 1967, the club currently plays in Football Federation Victoria State League 2 South-East. The club plays its home games at Anderson Park. The suburb also has an Australian Rules football team, The Doncaster East Sharks, competing in the Eastern Football League. The Manningham Cricket Club plays at Rieschiecks Reserve and competes in the Eastern Cricket Association MacGibbon Shield. The East Doncaster Cricket Club plays at Zerbes Reserve and competes in the Eastern Cricket Association Dunstan Shield (Turf).

The misba·∏•ah is also known as tasbƒ´·∏• () ‚Äî not to be confused with the dhikr of tasbih ‚Äî in non-Arab languages, particularly in Persian. In Turkey, it is known as tespih. Use A misba·∏•ah is a tool which is used as an aid to perform dhikr, including the names of God in Islam, and the glorification of God after regular prayer. It is often made of wooden or plastic beads, but also of olive seeds, ivory, pearls, and semi-precious stones such as carnelian, onyx, and amber. They usually consist of 99 beads to assist in the glorification of God following prayers: 33 Tasbeeh (subhƒÅna-llƒÅh ), 33 Tahmeed ( æal-·∏•amdu li-llƒÅh), and 33 Takbeer ( æAllƒÅhu  æakbar). Some suggest the 99 beads also refer to the 99 names of Allah. Smaller misbahas consist of 33 beads, in which case one cycles through them three times to complete 99. However, misbahas may also consist of 100 or 200 count beads to assist in the dhikr duties of certain Sufi orders. Misbahahs are also used culturally to reduce stress or as an indication of status in society.

For twenty- five years, he was in the leadership of Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), the largest processor of farm commodities in the United States, where he made his fortune. Andreas was born in Worthington, Minnesota. He grew up mostly in Iowa (with siblings Albert, Lenore, Glen, Osborne and Lowell) and attended Wheaton College in Illinois, but dropped out in his sophomore year after getting married, and went to work for a modest, family-owned food-processing firm in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. When Cargill bought the Cedar Rapids facility in 1945, Andreas joined the commodity firm, eventually becoming a vice president. Andreas resigned from Cargill in 1952, and continued in the vegetable oil business, eventually as an executive of the Grain Terminal Association. In 1971 Andreas became Chief Executive Officer of ADM, and is credited with transforming the firm into an industrial powerhouse -- so powerful that by 1996, ADM had been investigated for price-fixing and was assessed the largest antitrust fine in United States history: 100 million dollars. Andreas remained CEO until 1997. While not well known to the public, Andreas commanded much respect among Washington politicians for his largesse. As part of the investigations surrounding illegal campaign fundraising linked to the Watergate scandal, Andreas was charged with (but acquitted of) illegally contributing $100,000 to Hubert Humphrey's 1968 presidential campaign. In 1972 Andreas unlawfully contributed $25,000 to President Nixon's re-election campaign via Watergate burglar Bernard Barker. Other recipients of Andreas's \\"tithing\\" -- as he puts it -- have included George H. W. Bush, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, Michael Dukakis, Jesse Jackson, and Jack Kemp. According to Mother Jones magazine: > During the 1992 election, Andreas gave more than $1.4 million in soft money > and $345,000 to individual candidates, using multiple donors in his company > and family members (including wife Inez) to circumvent contribution limits. Not all of Andreas's charity goes directly to politicians: in the 1990s he contributed $2.5 million to Florida public broadcasting network WXEL. He also aided the Community Partnership for the Homeless. Andreas was one of several signatories to a May 20, 2004 open letter exhorting President George W. Bush to lift travel and humanitarian aid restrictions on Cuba. He was on the Board of Trustees of The Forum for International Policy and is the namesake of Barry University's Dwayne O. Andreas School of Law. Andreas was implicated in the financial scandal of the Orthodox Church in America for his donations to Russia in 1991. One of his closest friends was former New York governor and two-time Republican presidential candidate, Thomas E. Dewey. It was Andreas who discovered his friend following Dewey's fatal heart attack in his room at Seaview, a Florida Hotel in which Andreas held partial ownership. Andreas was portrayed by Tom Smothers in the 2009 film The Informant! about the Lysine price-fixing conspiracy. Andreas died on November 16, 2016 in Decatur, Illinois at the age of 98.https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/dwayne-andreas- adm-ceo-dies-age-98-43588205 References External links * 1918 births 2016 deaths American chief executives of food industry companies Archer Daniels Midland people ","title":"Dwayne Andreas"},{"id":"711634","text":"Here Come the Miracles is a double album by Steve Wynn, released in 2001 on Blue Rose Records.

If the defendant does not break the law during that period, and fulfils the particular conditions of the probation, the judge usually dismisses the sentence. Australia In Australia, suspended sentences are commonly imposed in order to alleviate the strain on overcrowded prisons. For example, an individual may be sentenced to a six-month jail term, wholly suspended for six months; if they commit any other offence during that year, the original jail term is immediately applied in addition to any other sentence. As of 1 September, 2014, suspended sentences no longer exist in Victoria, and in its place are community correction orders, which can be for a fixed term to ensure good behaviour. Canada People's Republic of China In the People's Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau), both suspended sentences and suspended sentencing (, also translated as a sentence \\"with reprieve\\") are featured in the criminal law. In the first situation, a fixed-term sentence of three years or below can be suspended. In the second situation, sentencing does not immediately follow the guilty verdict, but instead is determined after a period of probation. Death sentences can also be suspended (called a \\"death sentence with reprieve\\"), so that an offender who does not intentionally re- offend during the two-year suspension period of release would have the sentence commuted to a life sentence. Finland A suspended sentence is called ehdollinen vankeusrangaistus in Finnish, which translates to \\"conditional imprisonment\\". When a sentence of imprisonment is imposed conditionally, the enforcement of the sentence is postponed for a probation period. The length of the probation period is at least one and at most three years. The probation period begins at the pronouncement or the issue of the judgment. When conditional imprisonment is imposed, the convicted person shall be notified, in connection with the pronouncement or the issue of the judgment, of the date when the probation period ends and of the grounds on which the sentence may be ordered to be enforced. The court may order the enforcement of conditional imprisonment if the convicted person commits an offence during the probation period and the charge has been brought within one year of the end of the probation period. In this event, the conditional sentence to be enforced, the sentence for the offence committed during the probation period and the sentences of imprisonment for the other offences considered in the same trial shall be joined as one unconditional sentence of imprisonment. The court may also order that conditional imprisonment be enforced only in part, in which case the remainder of the sentence shall continue to be conditional, subject to the same probation period. Ireland In the law of the Republic of Ireland, the 2006 law by which a suspended sentence is activated was ruled unconstitutional in 2016. The 2006 law required that a court decision on whether to activate the suspended sentence be made as soon as a later conviction was handed down, even if there was an appeal pending for the later conviction. Subsequent legislation introduced in 2017 corrected the deficiencies identified, introducing an effective appeal mechanism. Japan are common practice in Japan and can be applied in cases where a sentence is for up to 3 years in prison and/or 500,000 yen in fines. Any criminal activity during the period of the suspended sentence will result in the cancellation of the sentence and imprisonment for the prescribed term.  Russia  In Russia suspended sentence () is commonplace and its application is stipulated by an Article 73 of the Russian Criminal Code. The suspended sentences may not be applied to child offenders (the child was under 14 years old when abused), to those who have committed serious or very serious crime (the definition of which is given by Article 15 of the same Code as of 2019), or in case of crime recurrence. The judge may also impose additional restrictions on how the probation must be served. Initial sentence is enforced in case of convicted failing to fulfill conditions of the probation. United Kingdom A suspended sentence can be applied if the term of imprisonment is under two years and the offender agrees to comply with court requirements including a curfew, performing unpaid work and rehabilitation. In 2017, 5% of convictions resulted in a suspended sentence, compared to 7% immediate custodial sentences. United States In the United States, it is common practice for judges to hand down suspended sentences to first-time offenders who have committed a minor crime, and for prosecutors to recommend suspended sentences as part of a plea bargain. They are often given to mitigate the effect of penalties. In some jurisdictions, the criminal record of the guilty party will still carry the offense, even after probation is adequately served. In other cases, the process of deferred adjudication prevents the conviction from appearing on a person's criminal record, once probation had been completed. In the federal system, judges' authority to suspend sentences has been abolished, by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, through the United States Sentencing Commission, and upheld by Mistretta v.

It is one of the Magnificent Seven cemeteries. Established by Act of Parliament and laid out in 1839, it opened in 1840, originally as the West of London and Westminster Cemetery. Consecrated by Charles James Blomfield, Bishop of London, in June 1840, it is one of Britain's oldest and most distinguished garden cemeteries. Some 35,000 monuments, from simple headstones to substantial mausolea, mark more than 205,000 resting places. The site includes large plots for family mausolea, and common graves where coffins are piled deep into the earth. It also has a small columbarium, and a secluded Garden of Remembrance at the northern end for cremated remains. The cemetery continues to be open for burials. It is also known as an urban haven for nature. In 2014, it was awarded a National Lottery grant to carry out essential restoration and develop a visitor centre, among other improvements. The restoration work was completed in 2018. Although the cemetery was originally established by a private company, it is now the property of the Crown. Location Charles Booth 1889 map ‚Äì detail showing Brompton Cemetery Brompton Cemetery is adjacent to West Brompton station in west London, England. The main entrance is at North Lodge, Old Brompton Road in West Brompton, SW5, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. There is another entrance at South Lodge, located on the Fulham Road, SW10 near the junction with Redcliffe Gardens. History Brompton Cemetery Chapel Tomb of Frederick Richards Leyland (the only Grade II* funerary monument in Brompton Cemetery) The military section, Brompton Cemetery Main avenue Outer east section, Brompton Cemetery Colonnade, Brompton Cemetery, London Central roundel, Brompton Cemetery Emmeline Pankhurst's grave angels, Brompton Cemetery Monument of Valentine Cameron Prinsep Grave of Nellie Farren Robert Coombes monument Burnside Monument Alfred Mellon monument Barbe Sangiorgi monument Marchesa Casati grave By the early years of the 19th century, inner city burial grounds, mostly churchyards, had long been unable to cope with the number of burials and were seen as a hazard to health and an undignified way to treat the dead. In 1837 a decision was made to lay out a new burial ground in Brompton, London. The moving spirit behind the project was the architect and engineer, Stephen Geary, and it was necessary to form a company in order to get parliamentary permission to raise capital for the purpose. Geary was appointed as architect but was later forced to resign. Securing the land ‚Äì some 40 acres ‚Äì from local landowner, Lord Kensington and the Equitable Gas Light Company, as well as raising the money proved an extended challenge. The cemetery became one of seven large, new cemeteries founded by private companies in the mid-19th century (sometimes called the 'Magnificent Seven') forming a ring around the edge of London. The site, previously market gardens, having been bought with the intervention of John Gunter of Fulham, was in area. Brompton Cemetery was eventually designed by architect, Benjamin Baud with at its centre, a modest sandstone domed chapel dated 1839, at it southern end, reached by two symmetrical long colonnades, now all Grade II* listed, in the style of St. Peter's Square in Rome, and flanked by catacombs. It was intended to give the feel of a large open air cathedral. It is rectangular in shape with the north end pointing to the northwest and the south end to the southeast. It has a central \\"nave\\" which runs from Old Brompton Road towards the central colonnade and chapel. During the 4-year restoration project that began in 2014, an original Victorian flooring with Bath and York stone radial pattern was uncovered underneath the chapel carpet. Below the colonnades are catacombs which were originally conceived as a cheaper alternative burial to having a plot in the grounds of the cemetery. Unfortunately, the catacombs were not a success and only about 500 of the many thousands of places in them were sold. The Metropolitan Interments Act 1850 gave the government powers to purchase commercial cemeteries. The shareholders of the cemetery company were relieved to be able to sell their shares as the cost of building the cemetery had overrun and they had seen little return on their investment and there were few burials at first. During World War II the cemetery suffered bomb damage. Heritage status As a site, the cemetery is listed Grade I in the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. The chapel and each arcade quadrant is separately listed as Grade II*. Frederick Richards Leyland's is the only Grade II* listed funerary monument. Several other individual monuments are listed Grade II. They include: * Tomb of Peter Borthwick and family * Burnside Monument * Chelsea Pensioners Monument * Tomb of Clement Family * Tomb of Robert Coombes * Tomb of Herbert Fitch * Tomb of Percy E. Lambert * Mausoleum of Harvey Lewis * Mausoleum of James McDonaldLeaflet entitled \\"Brompton Cemetery\\" issued by the Friends of Brompton Cemetery * Tomb of Alfred Mellon * Tomb of Barbe Marie Therese Sangiorgi (wife of Soho restaurateur August Kettner) * Tomb of Samuel Leigh Sotheby In all there are up to forty items associated with the cemetery which have a Historic England listing, including gates and telephone kiosks. Burials Brompton was closed to burials between 1952 and 1966, except for family and Polish interments, but is once again a working cemetery, with plots for interments and a 'Garden of Remembrance' for the deposit of cremated remains. Many nationalities and faiths from across the world are represented in the cemetery. Military graves From 1854 to 1939, Brompton Cemetery became the London District's Military Cemetery. The Royal Hospital Chelsea purchased a plot in the north west corner where they have a monument in the form of an obelisk; the Brigade of the Guards has its own section south of that. There are 289 Commonwealth service personnel of World War I and 79 of World War II, whose graves are registered and maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. A number of veterans are listed in the Notable Interments. Although the majority of war graves are in the dedicated railed section to the west ‚Äì also containing 19th century services graves ‚Äì a number of servicemen's graves are scattered in other areas. Besides the British there are many notable Czechoslovak, Polish and Russian military burials.

Exhumations In the late 1880s when the nearby Earl's Court Exhibition Grounds played host to the American Show with Buffalo Bill, a number of Native American performers in the show, died while on tour in Britain.'The Wild, Wild West: Buffalo Bill in Earls Court ‚Äì contemporary illustrations. The Time Machine RBKC The Sioux chief, Long Wolf, a veteran of the Oglala Sioux wars was buried here on 13 June 1892 having died age 59 of bronchial pneumonia. He shared the grave with a 17-month-old Sioux girl named White Star believed to have fallen from her mother's arms while on horseback. 105 years later a British woman named Elizabeth Knight traced his family and campaigned with them to have his remains returned to the land of his birth. In 1997, Chief Long Wolf was finally moved to a new plot at Wolf Creek Cemetery (ancestral burial ground of the Oglala Sioux tribe) in Pine Ridge, South Dakota. His great grandson John Black Feather said \\"Back then, they had burials at sea, they did ask his wife if she wanted to take him home and she figured that as soon as they hit the water they would throw him overboard, so that's why they left him here.\\" There was a Brul√© Sioux tribesman buried in Brompton named Paul Eagle Star. His plot was in the same section as Oglala Sioux warrior Surrounded By the Enemy who died in 1887 from a lung infection at age 22. Like Long Wolf, he took part of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. Paul died a few days after breaking his ankle when he fell off a horse in August 1891. His casket was exhumed in spring of 1999 by his grandchildren, Moses and Lucy Eagle Star. The reburial took place in Rosebud's Lakota cemetery. Philip James accompanied the repatriation. Little Chief and Good Robe's eighteen- month-old son, Red Penny, who travelled in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show is also buried here. His specific resting place within the cemetery remains a mystery. Two notable Polish figures originally buried in Brompton Cemetery were reburied in Powazki Cemetery, Warsaw: *General Micha≈Ç Karaszewicz- Tokarzewski ‚Äì founder of a Polish resistance unit in WWII and war hero, who died in Casablanca on 22 May 1964. The urn containing his ashes was reburied at Powazki in September 1992. *Major General Felicjan S≈Çawoj Sk≈Çadkowski ‚Äì prime minister of Poland before outbreak of WWII, who died in London in August 1962, was reburied at Powazki on 8 June 1990. Two other exhumations involved Polish bishops of the Polish Orthodox Church: * Sawa, Jerzy Jewgieniewicz Sowietow, rus. –ì–µ–æ—Ä–≥–∏–π –ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω—å–µ–≤–∏—á –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≤ ‚Äì Gieorgij Jewgienjewicz Sowietow, (1898 in St Petersburg - 1951 in London) ‚Äì bishop of the Polish Autocephalous Orthodox Church and bishop in the Polish Armed Forces during World War II. * Bishop Mateusz, Konstanty Siemaszko (1894 in Babice - 1985 in London) - bishop of the Polish Orthodox Church. Both were buried in their final resting place in the Orthodox Cemetery, Warsaw on 31 December 2012.Prochy arcybiskupa Sawy powr√≥ci≈Çy do Polski (in Polish) Funerary art The richness of the art and symbolism contained in many graves traces art movements across two centuries. Aside from the stonemason's and sculptor's craft, there is a vast array of lettering, decorative ironwork (sadly in a very corroded state) and ceramics. Some graves and mausolea are the work of noted artists and architects. Flora and fauna Brompton Cemetery with Kensington Canal by William Cowen Although never envisaged as a park, JC Loudon devised the original planting scheme that was not fully realised, however, pines were imported from Poland with the prospect that in maturity they would cast shade over the graves. There are over 60 species of trees, of which the limes are dated to 1838. The fact of the enclosure of the cemetery by a wall, has preserved almost intact, a distinct area of Victorian country flora. The adjacent West London line afforded a green corridor for many years, enriched by ballast from the South Downs when Counter's Creek was filled in and two railway lines constructed in mid-19th century, although a small wetland area was preserved by West Brompton station. However recent redevelopment along the station has further reduced local biodiversity and further reductions are planned with the major redevelopment of nearby Earls Court Exhibition Centre. In the cemetery each season brings its features, like snow-drops and bluebells or wild lupin and foxgloves, broad-leaf pea, ferns and horse tail. There are small scale wooded areas and meadows. Since the land was used for market gardens, there are wild cabbages, asparagus and garlic among the slabs. A grape vine has fallen victim to maintenance. In Autumn, there can be a display of fungi, a mycologist's trove. The evergreens and ivy are a haven for birds and countless insects. Over 200 species of moth and butterfly have been identified in the cemetery. Despite the absence of a permanent water feature, there have been sightings of amphibians, notably a toad. Mammals are represented by bats, a range of rodents, including grey squirrels and one or two families of foxes. Among the birds, there is a long-standing population of carrion crows and several garden species with the addition of green woodpeckers and occasionally, nesting kestrels and ring-necked parakeets. The appearance of a female ring-necked pheasant in 2012 was short-lived. > \\"Brompton Cemetery has been identified as a Site of Borough Importance for > Nature Conservation (grade I) comprising moderately diverse grassland that > contains at least three notable London species that support a diverse > assemblage of invertebrates\\". Public access The cemetery is open daily to the public throughout the year, with opening times varying with the seasons. It is regularly visited by the Parks Police Service to monitor and curb occurrences of anti-social behaviour. Dog walking and cycling, under strict control, is permitted on indicated paths. Through traffic is forbidden and there is no parking. Any visiting vehicles must observe a 5 mph limit. The byelaws are displayed on boards at both entrances. The Friends of Brompton Cemetery organise Open Days, regular tours and other public attractions. The cemetery has a reputation for being a popular cruising ground for gay men. A connection with Beatrix Potter Nutkins gravestone Beatrix Potter, who lived in Old Brompton Road nearby and enjoyed walking around it, may have taken the names of some of her characters from tombstones in the cemetery. Names of people buried there included Mr Nutkins, Mr McGregor, Mr Brock, Mr Tod, Jeremiah Fisher and even a Peter Rabbett, although it is not known for certain if there were tombstones with these names.Mason, M.

Parties played acid house and acid techno music, electronic music genres with a distinct sound from the use of the Roland TB-303 synthesizer. The origin of the term acid house party is disputed coming either from the 1987 song \\"Acid Trax\\" by Phuture, or the consumption of MDMA and LSD that were common at the parties. Setting Events and parties were often held in empty warehouses across the UK and were essentially illegal. Some of the most famous party promoters included Energy, Biology, Genesis'88, Sunrise, and Weekend World.How property owners can neutralise Acid House parties. By: Daglish, James, EG: Estates Gazette, 00141240, 8/11/2018, Issue 1832 Emerging from Danny Rampling's London club Shoom in late 1987, parties grew in northern cities like Manchester (the Madchester scene) where warehouses had closed throughout the 1970s, and up to 10,000 people attended parties in smaller places such as Blackburn. Vague flyers around towns advertised events and information travelled by word of mouth (as well as the newly popular mobile pager) between clubbers who were obliged to party incognito. For most promoters, keeping entry cheap was a political issue - many of the early parties cost just ¬£1 to enter and prices rarely crept above ¬£3. If police turned up to shut down a party, some would open the doors and let everyone in for free. Glaswegian DJ Tommy Smith encapsulated the scene's defiant spirit on Granada TV show 'Up Front', hosted by Tony Wilson, during a debate with disgruntled Blackburn residents and Conservative MP Ken Hind. Smith declared that he was not on drugs or alcohol, simply ‚Äúhigh on hope‚Äù and the phrase entered the clubbers' lexicon and was widely used to market club nights. Music The music was characterised by the \\"squelching\\" bass produced by the Roland TB-303 and loud repetitive beats. It originated in Chicago and took on new qualities when it came to Europe. Songs from the time period include \\"French Kiss\\" by Lil Louis \\"On & On\\" by Jesse Saunders, \\"Mystery of Love\\" by Fingers Inc., \\"Love Can't Turn Around\\" by Farley \\"Jackmaster\\" Funk & Jesse Saunders (featuring Darryl Pandy), \\"Back to Life (However Do You Want Me)\\" by Soul II Soul, \\"I've Lost Control\\" by Sleezy D, and \\"Your Only Friend\\" by Phuture. The catchphrase of partygoers was ‚ÄòCan you feel it?‚Äô, alluding to the Royal House cry from \\"Can you Party?\\". Decline The prevalence of drug use at these parties was in contrast to Thatcherism at the time, sparking moral panic. Police raided parties, such as a 10,000-strong rave in Nelson in 1990. In response, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Entertainments (Increased Penalties) Act of 1990 which brought the decline of acid house parties. As a result, the time period is often referred to as the Second Summer of Love. Eventually, acid house parties morphed into the rave scene.Class of 88 - The True Acid House Experience, Wayne Anthony, Virgin. The book may also be downloaded from the - author's e-group.

In 325 the First Council of Nicaea signalled consolidation of Christianity under an orthodoxy endorsed by Constantine, and though this did not make other Christian groups outside the adopted definition illegal, the dissenting Arian bishops were initially exiled. But Constantine reinstated Arius just before the heresiarch died in 336 and exiled the Orthodox Athanasius of Alexandria from 335 to 337. In 380 Emperor Theodosius I made Christianity the Roman Empire's official religion (see State church of the Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire and the Goths) and did enforce the edict. In 392 Theodosius passed legislation prohibiting all pagan cultic worship.Theodosian Code, XVI.1.2 During the 4th century, however, there was no real unity between church and state: in the course of the Arian controversy, Arian or semi-Arian emperors exiled leading Trinitarian bishops, such as Athanasius (335, 339, 356, 362, 365), Hilary of Poitiers (356), and Gregory of Nyssa (374); just as leading Arian and Anomoean theologians such as A√´tius (fl. 350) also suffered exile. Towards the end of the century, Bishop Ambrose of Milan made the powerful Emperor Theodosius I (reigned 379‚Äì95) do penance for several months after the massacre of Thessalonica (390) before admitting him again to the Eucharist. On the other hand, only a few years later, Chrysostom, who as bishop of Constantinople criticized the excesses of the royal court, was eventually banished (403) and died (407) while traveling to his place of exile. Theological implications Critics point to this shift as the beginning of the phenomenon known as Caesaropapism. In its extreme form, such critics say, Christianity became a religious justification for the exercise of power and a tool in the expansion and maintenance of empire, a Christian empire, also known as Christendom. Augustine of Hippo, who originally had rejected violence in religious matters, later justified it theologically against those he considered heretics, such as the Donatists, who themselves violently harassed their opponents. Before him, Athanasius believed that violence was justified in weeding out heresies that could damn all future Christians.Olson, 172 He felt that any means was justified in repressing the Arian belief.Barnes, 230. In 385, Priscillian, a bishop in Spain, was the first Christian to be executed for heresy, though the most prominent church leaders rejected this verdict. Theologians critical of the Constantinian shift also see it as the point at which membership in the Christian church became associated with citizenship rather than a personal decision. American theologian Stanley Hauerwas names the shift as the foundation for the expression of Christianity in the United States today that is closely associated with patriotism and civil religion.

Larger values of the discrepancy function indicate a poor fit of the model to data. In general, the parameter estimates for a given model are chosen so as to make the discrepancy function for that model as small as possible. Analogous concepts in statistics are known as goodness of fit or statistical distance, and include deviance and divergence.

His expression \\"Bir k…ôr…ô y√ºks…ôl…ôn bayraq, bir daha enm…ôz!\\" (\\"The flag once raised will never fall!\\") became the motto of the independence movement in Azerbaijan in the 20th century. Early life Born at Novxanƒ±, near Baku, Mammad Amin Rasulzade received his education at the Russian-Muslim Secondary School and then at the Technical College in Baku. In his years of study he created \\"Muslim Youth Organisation Musavat\\", first secret organisation in Azerbaijan's contemporary history, and beginning from 1903 Rasulzade began writing articles in various opposition newspapers and magazines. At that time, his anti-monarchist platform and his demands for the national autonomy of Azerbaijan, aligned him with Social Democrats and future Communists. In 1904 he founded the first Muslim social- democrat organisation \\"Hummet\\" and became editor-in-chief of its newspapers, Takamul (1906‚Äì1907) and Yoldash (1907). Rasulzade also published many articles in non-partisan newspapers such as ', Irshad, and the journal '. His dramatic play titled The Lights in the Darkness was staged in Baku in 1908. Rasulzade and his co-workers were representatives of the Azerbaijani intelligentsia. Most of them, including Rasulzade himself, had been members of the Baku organization of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party (Bolsheviks) in 1905. A photograph is extant in Soviet archives, showing Rasulzade with Prokopius Dzhaparidze and Meshadi Azizbekov, Bolsheviks who later became famous as two of the 26 Baku Commissars shot during the civil war.M.D. Guseinov. –¢—é—Ä–∫—Å–∫–∞—è –î–µ–º–æ–∫—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –ü–∞—Ä—Ç–∏—è –§–µ–¥–µ—Ä–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤ \\"–ú—É—Å–∞–≤–∞—Ç\\" –≤ –ø—Ä–æ—à–ª–æ–º –∏ –Ω–∞—Å—Ç–æ—è—â–µ–º. Baku, 1927, p. 9 During the First Russian Revolution (1905‚Äì1907), Rasulzade actively participated in revolutionary developments. As the story goes, it was Rasulzade who saved young Joseph Stalin in 1905 in Baku, when police were searching for the latter as an active instigator of riots.Rais Rasulzade (his grandson), \\"Mammad Amin Rasulzade: Founding Father of the First Republic,\\" in Azerbaijan International, Vol. 7:3 (Autumn 1999), pp. 22-23. In 1909, under the persecution from Tsarist authorities, Rasulzade fled Baku to participate in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1911. While in Iran, Rasulzade edited Iran-e Azad newspaper, became one of the founders of Democrat Party of Persia and began publishing its newspaper IrƒÅn-e Now which means \\"New Iran\\" and which has been described as \\"the greatest, most important and best known of the Persian newspapers, and the first to appear in the large size usual in Europe\\". In 1911, Rasulzade also published his book \\"Saadet-e bashar\\" (\\"Happiness of Mankind\\") in defense of the revolution. After Russian troops entered Iran in 1911 and, in cooperation with British, assisted Qajar Court to put an end to Iranian Constitutional Revolution, Rasulzade fled to Istanbul, then capital of Ottoman Empire. Here, in the wake of Young Turk Revolution, Rasulzade founded a journal called T√ºrk Yurdu (The Land of Turks), in which he published his famous article \\"ƒ∞ran T√ºrkleri\\" about the Iranian Turks.Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

In 1915 he started to publish the party's newspaper \\"A√ßƒ±q S√∂z\\" (Open word) which lasted till 1918. When the February Revolution happened, Musavat together with other secret political parties in the Russian Empire, were quickly legalized and became a leading party of Caucasian Muslims after it merged with Party of Turkic Federalists headed by Nasib Yusifbeyli. The October revolution in 1917 lead to the secession of Transcaucasia from Russia and Rasulzade became head of Muslim faction in the Seym, the parliament of the Transcaucasian Federation. After the dissolution of the Transcaucasian Federation, the Muslim faction re-organized into the Azerbaijani National Council, whose head Rasulzade was unanimously elected in May 1918. On 28 May 1918 the Azerbaijani National Council, headed by Rasulzade, declared an independent Azerbaijan Republic. Rasulzade also initiated the establishment of Baku State University together with Rashid Khan Gaplanov, minister of education with the funding of oil baron Haji Zeynalabdin Taghiyev in 1919. Rasulzade taught Ottoman literature at the University. After the collapse of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in April 1920, Rasulzade left Baku and went into hiding in the mountainous village of Lahƒ±c, Ismailli to direct the resistance to Sovietization. But in August 1920, after the Soviet Russian army crushed the rebellions of Ganja, Karabakh, Zagatala and Lankaran, led by ex- officers of the Azerbaijani National Army, Rasulzade was arrested and brought to Baku. It was only due to an earlier rescue of Joseph Stalin, as Rasulzade hid Stalin from the police, that Rasulzade was released and transferred from Azerbaijan to Russia. For the next two years, Rasulzade worked as the press representative at the Commissariat on Nations in Moscow. He was seconded to Saint Petersburg in 1922 from where he escaped to Finland.  Exile  For the rest of his life, Rasulzade lived in exile first in Turkey. Between 1923 and 1927, he was an editor-in-chief of the magazine called \\"New Caucasus\\" (\\"Yeni Qafqasya\\") which was suspended by the Kemalist government by the request of Moscow. Rasulzade continued to publish various articles, newspapers, and magazines from 1928 till 1931 in Turkey. However, the 1931 suppression of the emigre publications coincided with Rasulzade's expulsion from Turkey, and some saw it as the result of caving in to Soviet pressure. In exile Rasulzade published a pamphlet titled O Pantiurkizme v sviazi s kavkazskoi problemoi (–û –ü–∞–Ω—Ç—é—Ä–∫–∏–∑–º–µ –≤ —Å–≤—è–∑–∏ —Å –∫–∞–≤–∫–∞–∑—Å–∫–æ–π –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º–æ–π, Pan-Turkism with regard to the caucasian problem), in which he firmly stated his view: Pan-Turkism was a cultural movement rather than a political program. Thus, he went to Poland in 1938, where he met his wife, Vanda, niece of Polish statesman J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, then to Romania in 1940. Finally, after World War II, he went back to Ankara, Turkey in 1947, where he participated in the politics of the marginal Pan Turkic movement. Due to sensitivity of his presence in either Turkey or Iran, and being often exiled, Rasulzade \\"cherished bad memories of both Iran and Turkey\\".Charles van der Leeuw, Azerbaijan: A Quest for Identity, Palgrave Macmillan, 2000, p. 121. In his appeal to Azerbaijani people in 1953 through Voice of America, he stressed his hope that one day it will become independent again.http://www.rasulzade.org/ME_Rasulzade_nin_Amerikanin_Sesinde_chixishi.mp3 He died in 1955, a broken man according to Thomas Goltz, and was buried in Cebeci Asri cemetery in Ankara.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, its UN seat was transferred to the Russian Federation.  Role in the founding of the United Nations  The Soviet Union took an active role in the United Nations and other major international and regional organizations. At the behest of the United States, the Soviet Union took a role in the establishment of the United Nations in 1945. The Soviet Union insisted that there be veto rights in the Security Council and that alterations in the United Nations Charter be unanimously approved by the five permanent members. From the creation in 1945 to 1955, there was a Western majority in the United Nations. Only a limited amount of non-Western nations joined the United Nations. The year 1955 marked the end of American hegemony over the General Assembly. This is because more nations became states, which were accepted into the United Nations. The new states were often just beginning to understand what being an independent state meant as they were pushed into the organization where they were often asked to pick between the West and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union made many new allies this way. Ukraine (red) and Byelorussia (green)left260px The USSR initially protested the membership of India and the Philippines, whose independence was then largely theoretical (being basically colonies of the United Kingdom and the United States, respectively, in all but name). A demand by the Soviet Union that all fifteen Soviet Socialist Republics be recognized as member states in the UN was counter-demanded by the United States that all then 48 states be similarly recognized. Ultimately two Soviet Republics (Ukraine and Byelorussia) were admitted as full members of the United Nations, so between 1945 and 1991, the Soviet Union was represented by three seats in the United Nations.Stalin: The Man and His Era. by Adam B. Ulam, p. 606-607 This resulted in the chairman of the United States delegation to the San Francisco Conference, Edward Stettinius, not pressing the demand for three seats in the Assembly. No mention is made by James F. Byrnes, who was at the Yalta Conference where the three seat issue was first discussed, of any official offer of three seats to the United States, nor of any discussion as to which of the United States states would have held those seats had they been offered.James F. Byrnes in his autobiography, All In One Lifetime, published by Harper Brothers,1958  Security Council and veto  John G. Stoessinger argued the Soviet Union did not abuse its veto power. The Soviet Union had cast its veto 109 times by 1973, out of a total 128 vetoes used by the council. The Soviet Union used the veto 18 times to protect their national interest against the United States. Many more vetoes were used because of Cold War and anti-Communist actions taken by the Western states. Even with all the vetoes used not all stuck. It is shown that for 75 percent of the vetoes cast by the Soviet Union, further actions were taken by United Nations. The Soviets believed strongly in the veto power, and insisted it be part of the United Nation Security Council. They voiced this option for the veto power to both the Security Council and the General Assembly. The Soviet representative to the United Nation in 1950, Andrei Y. Vishinsky, declared that \\"the veto power is the paramount principle, which constitutes the cornerstone of the United Nations.\\"  Relationship with China  The debate over China's representation with the United Nations began in 1949. The Communist Party of China took over the country's mainland, while the Nationalists moved to the island of Taiwan. The United Nations seat of China was held by the Nationalist government of the Republic of China, but conflict arose on which the government should hold the China seat. The Soviet Union supported the communist party, leading to conflict with the West. The Security Council sided with the United States and saw the Communist government of People's Republic of China (PRC) as illegitimate, and prevented it from entering the United Nations until 1971. Before the China seat was transferred to the Communist government of PRC in 1971, the Soviet Union was one of sixteen states that viewed it as being the legitimate government. A major turning point in the Soviet Union relation occurred in January 1950, when Soviet representatives boycotted United Nations functions in protest over the occupation of the seat of China by the Republic of China. Yakov Malik was the sole Soviet representative that walked out of the United Nations, and announced that they would be boycotting further Security Council meetings. In the absence of the Soviet representatives, the United Nations Security Council was able to vote for the intervention of United Nations military forces in what would become the Korean War. This was a downfall to the action of the boycott that was unforeseeable to the Soviet Union at the time. Nations questioned Soviet actions on relations with China, and how they acted on the issue of representation. The Soviet Union always voted for China's Communist Party to have the seat.  Relationship with the West  For many years, the West played a guiding role in United Nations deliberations, but by the 1960s many former colonies had been granted independence and had joined the United Nations. These states, which became the majority in the General Assembly and other bodies, were increasingly receptive to Soviet anti-imperialist appeals. By the 1970s, the United Nations deliberations had generally become increasingly hostile toward the West and toward the United States in particular, as evidenced by pro-Soviet and anti- United States voting trends in the General Assembly. Western media reported in 1987 that Eastern European and Asian communist countries that were allies of the Soviet Union, had received more development assistance from the United Nations than what the Soviet Union had contributed. This contradicted communist states' rhetorical support for the United Nation's establishment of a New International Economic Order, which would transfer wealth from the rich Northern Hemisphere to the poor Southern Hemisphere states. The Soviet Union announced in September 1987 that it would pay back a portion of its debt to the United Nations. The Soviet Union did not, however, win support in the United Nations for its foreign policy positions. The Soviet Union and Third World states often argued that imperialism caused and continued to maintain the disparities in the world distribution of wealth. They disagreed, however, on the proper level of Soviet aid to the Third World. Also, the Soviet Union encountered fierce opposition to its invasion and occupation of Afghanistan and the Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia and received little support (as evidenced by Third World abstentions) for its 1987 proposal on the creation of a \\"Comprehensive System of International Peace and Security.\\"  Participation in special agencies  After walking out of the United Nations in January 1950 known as the Chinese Boycott, the Soviet Union returned to various United Nations bodies in August 1950. The return brought with it a beginning of a new policy of active participation on international and regional organizations. By the late 1980s the Soviet Union belonged to most of the special agencies of the United Nations. They did, however, resist joining various agricultural, food and humanitarian relief efforts. During the Mikhail Gorbachev era, the Soviet Union made repeated suggestions for increasing United Nations involvement in the settlement of superpower and regional problems and conflicts. Though these proposals were not implemented, they constituted new initiatives in Soviet foreign policy and represented a break with the nature of past Soviet foreign policy. This lessened world tensions.  Dissolution and succession by Russia  In the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union, 11 Soviet republics‚Äîall except the Baltic states and Georgia‚Äîsigned the Alma- Ata Protocol on 21 December 1991, establishing the Commonwealth of Independent States and declaring that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. The Protocol provided that the Russian Federation would assume Soviet Union's United Nation membership, including its permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. The resignation of Soviet President Gorbachev on 25 December 1991 and the dissolution of the Soviet of the Republics the following day formalized the end of the Soviet Union. On 24 December 1991, the Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations Yuli Vorontsov delivered to the Secretary-General of the United Nations a letter from the Russian President Boris Yeltsin. The letter stated that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist, and that Russia would continue the Soviet Union's membership in the United Nations and maintain the full responsibility for all the rights and obligations of the Soviet Union under the United Nations Charter. The letter was circulated among the United Nations membership without any objection, and Russia formally took over the Soviet Union's seat in the United Nations General Assembly, in the Security Council and in other organs of the United Nations. The letter also confirmed the credentials of Soviet representatives to represent Russia, and Soviet representatives to the various United Nations agencies continued serving as Russian representatives without presenting new credentials. Ambassador Vorontsov continued serving as the first Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the United Nations. On 31 January 1992, Russian President Boris Yeltsin himself was in the Russian Federation‚Äôs seat in the Security Council during the ‚Äòsummit meeting‚Äô of the Council attended by heads of state and government.

The show glorified stunts and the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol, and took its name from the Hollywood special episode, which featured Randy Campbell jumping off the back of the \\"Y\\" of the famous Hollywood Sign. Concept and history Back of the Y is centred on a mock live TV show, featuring segments such as \\"Randy Campbell's Extreme Stunts\\" and \\"Cunstables\\". The show was low budget, and apparently filmed with amateur equipment and edited on home computers. A description of the show at the start of the first episode established the premise for the show, with reference to one of the characters: \\"Phil Bruff had a dream. To make a New Zealand TV show that wasn't complete shit. He failed... Miserably!!!\\" The show consisted of seven episodes of Back of the Y Masterpiece Television and The Back of the Y Goes To Hollywood Special. In addition to New Zealand, the show was broadcast on MTV2 in the UK and on Channel V in Australia. The show's creators are also responsible for That Cunt Rabbit and Heck, both animated TV shows for MTV UK, and appeared on the British game show Balls of Steel. Back of the Y features the New Zealand band Deja Voodoo, originally a fictional house band. After Back of the Y Stapp and Heath developed Deja Voodoo into a real band. In 2005 Back of the Y released a TV special, \\"Bogan's Heroes\\", a comedy based on life in prison. In 2007, Stapp and Heath released The Devil Dared Me To (The Randy Campbell Story), backed by Headstrong Productions, in association with the New Zealand Film Commission. The film tells the story of Randy Campbell, Back of the Ys Stuntman character, and how he rose to become \\"the world's greatest stuntman\\". The film stars Chris Stapp as the titular Randy Campbell, and Matt Heath as Dick Johansonson as well as an all-New Zealand cast. Back of the Y began shooting a second series from 24 September 2007 to 28 September 2007 at Henderson Valley Studios in Auckland. The second series of the show was aired on C4 in New Zealand from 26 May 2008. Series 3 is made up of six episodes and a making-of special. They also had a series in 2010 called Bogan Family Films. Regular features * \\"Vaseline Warriors\\": a Mad Max parody set in a post- apocalyptic future where all women have been destroyed, and men fight over ripped up pornographic magazines and vaseline. * \\"Bottlestore Galactica\\": a Battlestar Galactica parody.

It is a Grade I listed building and is set in gardens with formal areas. The hill behind the house is planted with a fine selection of shrubs and trees. Early history Lanhydrock estate belonged to the Augustinian priory of St Petroc at Bodmin but the Dissolution of the Monasteries during the 1530s saw it pass into private hands. In 1620 wealthy merchant Sir Richard Robartes, of Truro, acquired the estate and began building Lanhydrock House, designed to a four- sided layout around a central courtyard and constructed of grey granite. Robartes died in 1624 but work on the building was continued by his son John Robartes, 1st Earl of Radnor, a notable public figure who served as Lord Privy Seal and Lord President of the Council. The embattled walls were built of rude (rough), massive granite blocks with years 1636 and 1642 on the walls, indicating when they were built. A barbican gate was added and the house was garrisoned by Parliamentary forces in August 1644 when Sir Richard Grenville took possession. Agar-Robartes Most of the current building dates from late Victorian times, when the estate came under the ownership of the Agar- Robartes family. Through a lack of children, by the late 18th century the estate had passed to Anna Maria Hunt (1771‚Äì1861) of Mayfair, London, the great-niece of Henry Robartes, 3rd Earl of Radnor and 4th Baron Robartes. In 1804 she married Charles Bagenal Agar, the youngest son of Irish peer James Agar, 1st Viscount Clifden. The couple had three children, but by 1818 not only had her husband died, but also her eldest and youngest sons. Resultantly, over the next 50 years of widowhood, although mainly a remote landlord ‚Äì she preferred the social life of London ‚Äì she was known to be a conscientious, benevolent and charitable landlord and employer, who greatly improved the estate. On the death of his mother in 1822, her surviving middle son Thomas Agar moved his home to the estate, and adopted the Robartes name by warrant. Agar-Robartes was returned to Parliament for Cornwall East in 1847, a seat he held until 1868. In 1869 the barony of Robartes held by his mother's ancestors was revived when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Robartes of Lanhydrock, and of Truro in the County of Cornwall. By 1872 Baron Robartes of Lanhydrock, was listed in the top ten land holdings in Cornwall with an estate of or 2.93% of Cornwall.Who Owns Britain ‚Äì by Kevin Cahill (author) Agar-Robartes had had the east wing of the house demolished, leaving the U-shaped plan seen today. In 1880 he commissioned the architect George Gilbert Scott to renovate Lanhydrock House. On 4 April 1881 a major fire destroyed the south wing and caused extensive damage to the central section. The fire started in the kitchen and the near gale-force wind fanned the flames along the south wing and the ‚Ä≥communicating block‚Ä≥. Of the main house only the north wing, with its Long Gallery, and the front porch building survived intact, along with the original gatehouse which also dates back to the mid-17th century. The gallery was decorated with old plaster work which was considered to be the finest of its type in the west of England with figures representing the creation in ‚Ä≥bas-relief‚Ä≥. The property was insured for ¬£10,000 in the Royal Standard Office and for ¬£10,000 in the County Fire Office and the damage is estimated to cost ¬£8,000 to ¬£10,000 It was reported in August 1881 that the rebuilding of the house would cost ¬£50,000 and was to be undertaken by Messers Lang and Son of Liskeard. New sections were built behind the south wing, including a kitchen block, in the style of the original building ‚Äì which was unusual at the time. Agar-Robartes wife died five days after the fire of smoke inhalation, and he died of a broken heart 12 months later. Their only son Thomas Charles Agar-Robartes, 6th Viscount Clifden inherited the estate. He appointed local architect Richard Coad ‚Äì who had worked as an assistant to George Gilbert Scott ‚Äì to design and supervise the construction of a high- Victorian home from the previous adaptions of a Jacobean house his father had planned. After renovations on the home were completed, Agar-Robartes moved his family there from 1885. Having been called to the Bar in 1870, in 1880 Agar- Robartes was returned to Parliament as one of two representatives for Cornwall East. He entered the House of Lords on the death of his father in 1882, and on 10 September 1899 succeeded his kinsman as sixth Viscount Clifden. In 1891, as chairman of the Agar-Robartes Bank he took over the ownership of Wimpole Hall, the largest house in Cambridgeshire. Moving his family home there, he later served as Lord-Lieutenant of Cambridgeshire from 1906 to 1915.thepeerage.com Thomas Charles Agar-Robartes, 6th Viscount Clifden of Gowran The Robartes family declined significantly during the First World War, including the heir Thomas Agar-Robartes MP, who was killed during the Battle of Loos in France, while trying to rescue a colleague from no-man's land. Only one descendant survives, living in a cottage on the estate. Antiquities The cross in the churchyard Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded two Cornish crosses and two cross bases (at Tredinnick Cross and Reperry)For more details of Reperry Cross, see Lanivet in the parish. One cross is in the churchyard and the other is half a cross head at Treffry. The cross in the churchyard is ornamented on all four sides of the shaft.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 382‚Äì83, 183, 227 & 423 In addition to these there is a cross called Bodwen Cross; this cross was recorded in 1850 but was not mentioned by J. T. Blight or Arthur Langdon. It was found again in 1937 near Helman Tor in the parish of Lanlivery. It was taken from there and erected in the new cemetery at Lanhydrock. A request for it to be returned to Lanlivery to a site on the Saints' Way was refused.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 42 Lanhydrock Estate Company In 1934, to manage income taxes and death duties, the entire Cornish landholdings of the Agar-Roberts family were incorporated into the Lanhydrock Estate Company. In 1953, faced with crippling death duties through a lack of his own children, the 7th Viscount Clifden gave the house and approximately of parkland to the National Trust. This allowed the preservation of the house and its extensive Victorian collections, and, by agreement with HM Revenue, payment in kind of death duties, allowing the residual Lanhydrock Estate Company to pass into the hands of the wider family. On the death of the 7th Viscount, the titles and control of the company passed to his youngest brother Arthur Agar-Robartes, 8th Viscount Clifden. Lord Clifden died in December 1974, and in a similar death duty exchange with HM Revenue, added 298 acres during the 1970s to the National Trust's estate holdings. He had married Patience Mary Basset in 1920 but died without male issue, and upon his death all his titles, with the exception of the barony of Mendip (which the 6th Earl of Normanton succeeded) became extinct. His daughter Rachel married Captain Cromwell Lloyd-Davies RN, DSO DSC in 1941, and they had a daughter Ann Lloyd- Davies (1942‚Äìpresent). In 1964 she married Colin Williams; they and their three children now control the company.https://family- tree.cobboldfht.com/tree/view/person:4804 As of 2020 the company owns and controls 2,500 acres of land, and is by descent controlled by the Williams family. House and gardens today Today, the public tour of Lanhydrock house is one of the longest of any National Trust house. It takes in the service rooms, nurseries and some servants' bedrooms, as well as the main reception rooms and family bedrooms. In 2004 it was one of the Trust's ten most visited paid-entry properties, with over 200,000 visitors. Parts of the estate have been designated as an Important Plant Area, by the organisation Plantlife, for its ancient woodland and lichens. Lanhydrock was the main setting for a 1996 film version of Twelfth Night directed by Trevor Nunn, and starring Helena Bonham Carter as Olivia. On 12 June 2008 Lanhydrock hosted an episode of BBC TV's Antiques Roadshow, which was first aired on 12 October 2008 (part 1) and 30 November 2008 (part 2).

It is bowled by swing bowlers. Method An outswinger is bowled by holding the cricket ball with the seam at an angle and the first two fingers running along either side of the seam. The ball must be released at 12 o'clock height. The hands should move slightly towards the left at follow through and must push down for more back-spin. Once the ball has worn on one side the shiny side should face the leg side and the seam towards first or second slip for swing. The difference of pressure caused by movement of air over the rough and smooth surfaces tends to push the ball to the left. The result is that the ball curves, or swings to the left. In case of a new ball point the seam to the direction of swing. The difference of the separation of air by the seam the ball moves away from the batsman. Advantages From a right-handed batsman's point of view, the swing is away from his body towards his right, i.e. towards the off side. This swing away from the body is the source of the name outswinger. To a left-handed batsman, the swing is in towards the body and towards the leg side which from a technical point of view makes the outswinger, now an inswinger. Outswingers may be considered to be one of the more difficult fast deliveries for a right- handed batsman to play. This is because the ball moves away from his body. This means that any miscalculation can result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders. Tactical use To a right-handed batsman, a fast bowler will generally concentrate on bowling repeated outswingers, aiming to tempt the batsman to play away from his body and get him out in one of the ways described above. However, sometimes a fast bowler may attempt to deceive the batsman by bowling an off cutter instead of a standard outswinger, and look to get a batsman out either bowled or lbw. More commonly, variation is in the length of the ball, with yorkers and bouncers. An effective delivery length is one that places the ball approaching the top of the stumps; usually between two-thirds to three- quarters up the length of the pitch.

GSP Texas Instruments TMS34020. Texas Instruments Graphics Architecture (TIGA) is a graphics interface standard created by Texas Instruments that defined the software interface to graphics processors. Using this standard, any software written for TIGA should work correctly on a TIGA-compliant graphics interface card. The TIGA standard is independent of resolution and color depth which provides a certain degree of future proofing. This standard was designed for high-end graphics. However, TIGA was not widely adopted. Instead, VESA and Super VGA became the de facto standard for PC graphics devices after the VGA. Texas Instrument's TMS34010 and TMS34020 Graphics System Processors (GSP) were the original TIGA-compliant graphics processors. Clone Hardware The primary manufacturers of mainstream TIGA cards for the PC clone market included Number Nine Visual Technology and Hercules. Number Nine Visual Technology graphics cards using Texas Instruments' TIGA co-processors were made from about 1986 to 1992, including the Pepper and GX series. Hercules manufactured cards such as the Graphics Station and Chrome lines which were marketed primarily toward users of Microsoft Windows. In the early 1990s, Texas Instruments France (which had marketing control for the TIGA architecture and GSP chipsets in Europe) experimented with manufacturing and selling its own range of consumer oriented video cards based on TIGA and aimed at speeding up the user experience of Windows. These products were named TIGA Diamond (34020 based) and TIGA Star (34010 based), and provided a platform for selling TI DRAM and video palette chips as well as the GSP chips themselves. Impact Despite the superiority of the technology in comparison to typical SuperVGA cards of the era, the relatively high cost and emerging local bus graphics standards meant that IT distributors and PC manufacturers could not see a niche for these products at consumer level. The (limited) success of the graphics cards paved the way for products based upon various derivatives and clones of IBM's 8514 architecture. Part of the effort to make graphics accelerators useful required TI to convince Microsoft that the internal interfaces to its Windows Operating System had to be adaptable instead of hard-coded. Indeed, all versions of Windows prior to Windows 3.0 were \\"hard-coded\\" to specific graphics hardware.

It is bowled by swing bowlers. Grip Image:Inswing FromSide.jpg Image:Project3.gif Image:Inswing FromBehind.jpg An inswinger is bowled by holding the cricket ball with the seam vertical and the first two fingers slightly across the seam so that it is angled a little to the leg side. Once the ball has worn and been polished so that one side is rougher than the other, the rough side is placed on the leg side. The ball is placed on the pad of the thumb. This thumb position locks the wrist in a position inclined to the leg side. Back foot contact Inswing can be bowled from side-on, mid-way or chest on positions. But bowlers usually tend to pitch it in the good length spot or up to the batsman. It is the wrist position that is crucial, not the position of hips or shoulders. (See thumb position above). Point of release When the bowler delivers the ball, he angles the seam so that it points slightly to the leg side. To help achieve this position the bowling arm should be near vertical, brushing close to the ear. At release the wrist should remain cocked so as to help impart backspin along the orientation of the seam. The angle of the seam to the direction of motion produces an aerofoil effect as the ball moves through the air, pushing it to the leg side. This is enhanced by differential air pressure caused by movement of air over the rough and smooth surfaces, which also tends to push the ball to the leg side. The result is that the ball curves, or swings in to the batsman. Use of the inswinger Inswingers are not considered to be as difficult for a right-handed batsman to play as an outswinger. This is because the ball moves in towards his body, meaning that his body is often behind the line of the ball, and any miscalculated shot that is hit by the edge of the bat may be intercepted by his body rather than flying to a fielder for a catch. Inswingers can, however, sneak between the bat and pad to hit the wicket and bowl the batsman out, or miss the bat and hit the pads for a leg before wicket. A particularly effective delivery is the inswinging yorker, which can cause a batsman to attempt to pull his feet out of the line of the ball, leaving him vulnerable to being bowled, or out lbw if he is too slow. Another deceptive type are those pitched around the off-stump that appear to be passing the batmen by but swing in wildly to knock the stumps off. In the final match of 1983 World Cup, Balwinder Sandhu famously clean bowled Gordon Greenidge with a huge inswinger to which the batsman had shouldered arms.

The term may be used of all vessels operating out of a particular port, all vessels engaged in a particular type of fishing (as in the \\"tuna fishing fleet\\"), or all fishing vessels of a country or region. Although fishing vessels are not formally organized as if they were a naval fleet, very often the constraints of time and weather are such that they must all leave or return together, thus creating at least the appearance of an organized body (some countries, such as the former Soviet Union, did however organise their fishing fleets partially along naval lines and used the ships to also gather naval intelligence).Moscow's South Pacific Fishing Fleet Is Much More Than It Seems - Kim, Byung Ki; The Heritage Foundation, Asian Studies Backgrounder No. 80 September 6, 1988. Fishermen operating a particular type of vessel or in a particular port often belong to a local association which disseminates information and may be used to coordinate activities, such as how best to prevent overfishing in particular areas. World fishing fleet In 2002 the world fishing fleet numbered about four million vessels. About one-third were decked. The remaining undecked boats were generally less than 10 metres long, and 65 percent were not fitted with mechanical propulsion systems. The FAO estimates that Asia accounts for over 80 percent of them. The average size of decked vessels is about 20 gross tons (10‚Äì15 metres). Only one percent of the world fishing fleet is larger than 100 gross tons (longer than 24 metres). China has half (25,600) of these larger vessels. There is no international instrument in force concerning the safety of fishing vessels. International conventions and agreements awaiting ratification which concern safety at sea are almost exclusively aimed at vessels 24 metres in length and over, and therefore do not apply to artisan vessels in developing countries. Safety regulations for all fishing vessels are left almost entirely to national discretion.

He was born in Birmingham, Alabama, and raised in Dallas, Texas. Ramsey graduated from Highland Park High School in 1969, and was a prominent baritone in the school's Lads and Lassies Choir. In his senior year, he played a leading role in the musical Carousel. He released the critically acclaimed album, Willis Alan Ramsey, in 1972 on the Shelter label. The album included \\"Muskrat Candlelight\\" which was covered (under the title \\"Muskrat Love\\") by America in 1973 and by Captain & Tennille in 1976. Owing to conflict with his label, Ramsey left Shelter at the end of his contract. As a result, Ramsey's fans have been waiting more than 40 years for the release of his \\"mythical second album\\". When asked where the new album is, he often responds, \\"What's wrong with the first one?\\" In the 1980s, he moved to Great BritainBiography to reconnect with his ancestry and study traditional and modern music narrative. At the same time, he enjoyed a revival in the United States, due in part to numerous artists who cut versions of Ramsey's songs, including Widespread Panic (\\"Geraldine & The Honey Bee\\"), Jerry Jeff Walker (\\"Northeast Texas Women\\"), Waylon Jennings, Shawn Colvin (\\"Satin Sheets\\"), Jimmy Buffett (\\"The Ballad of Spider John\\"), and Jimmie Dale Gilmore (\\"Goodbye to Old Missoula\\"). In 1989, he returned to the United States and began performing again. Backed by Champ Hood, multi-instrumentalist (of Uncle Walt's Band fame), Ramsey could often be found on the same bill with another Dallas singer-songwriter, Alison Rogers. The two married in 1991 and continue to perform together. In 1996, Ramsey and Rogers co-wrote Lyle Lovett's hit, \\"That's Right (You're Not from Texas)\\". In 2000, Ramsey appeared on Austin City Limits, showcasing his new material and performing his classics. He is currently mixing his new album, Gentilly, so called since 1997.

Geodesy Geodesy is the scientific discipline that deals with the measurement and representation of the earth, its gravitational field and geodynamic phenomena (polar motion, earth tides, and crustal motion) in three- dimensional, time-varying space. The geoid is essentially the figure of the Earth abstracted from its topographic features. It is an idealized equilibrium surface of sea water, the mean sea level surface in the absence of currents, air pressure variations etc. and continued under the continental masses. The geoid, unlike the ellipsoid, is irregular and too complicated to serve as the computational surface on which to solve geometrical problems like point positioning. The geometrical separation between it and the reference ellipsoid is called the geoidal undulation, or more usually the geoid-ellipsoid separation, N. It varies globally between . A reference ellipsoid, customarily chosen to be the same size (volume) as the geoid, is described by its semi- major axis (equatorial radius) a and flattening f. The quantity f = (a‚àíb)/a, where b is the semi-minor axis (polar radius), is a purely geometrical one. The mechanical ellipticity of the earth (dynamical flattening, symbol J2) is determined to high precision by observation of satellite orbit perturbations. Its relationship with the geometric flattening is indirect. The relationship depends on the internal density distribution. The 1980 Geodetic Reference System (GRS 80) posited a semi-major axis and a flattening. This system was adopted at the XVII General Assembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG) in Canberra, Australia, 1979. The GRS 80 reference system was originally used by the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS 84). The reference ellipsoid of WGS 84 now differs slightly due to later refinements. The numerous other systems which have been used by diverse countries for their maps and charts are gradually dropping out of use as more and more countries move to global, geocentric reference systems using the GRS80 reference ellipsoid. Defining features of GRS 80 The reference ellipsoid is usually defined by its semi-major axis (equatorial radius) a and either its semi-minor axis (polar radius) b, aspect ratio (b/a) or flattening f, but GRS80 is an exception: For a complete definition, four independent constants are required.

This type of taxonomy may consider whole taxa rather than single species, so that groups of species can be inferred as giving rise to new groups. The concept found its most well-known form in the modern evolutionary synthesis of the early 1940s. Evolutionary taxonomy differs from strict pre-Darwinian Linnaean taxonomy (producing orderly lists only), in that it builds evolutionary trees. While in phylogenetic nomenclature each taxon must consist of a single ancestral node and all its descendants, evolutionary taxonomy allows for groups to be excluded from their parent taxa (e.g. dinosaurs are not considered to include birds, but to have given rise to them), thus permitting paraphyletic taxa. Origin of evolutionary taxonomy ‚ÄãJean- Baptiste Lamarck's 1815 diagram showing branching in the course of invertebrate evolution Evolutionary taxonomy arose as a result of the influence of the theory of evolution on Linnaean taxonomy. The idea of translating Linnaean taxonomy into a sort of dendrogram of the Animal and Plant Kingdoms was formulated toward the end of the 18th century, well before Charles Darwin's book On the Origin of Species was published. The first to suggest that organisms had common descent was Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis in his 1751 Essai de Cosmologie,J. S. Bromley, The new Cambridge modern history: The rise of Great Britain and Russia, 1688-1715/25, CUP Archive, 1970, , pgs. 62-63.Geoffrey Russell Richards Treasure, The making of modern Europe, 1648-1780, Taylor & Francis, 1985, , pg. 142 Transmutation of species entered wider scientific circles with Erasmus Darwin's 1796 Zo√∂nomia and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's 1809 Philosophie Zoologique. The idea was popularised in the English-speaking world by the speculative but widely read Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation, published anonymously by Robert Chambers in 1844. Following the appearance of On the Origin of Species, Tree of Life representations became popular in scientific works. In On the Origin of Species, the ancestor remained largely a hypothetical species; Darwin was primarily occupied with showing the principle, carefully refraining from speculating on relationships between living or fossil organisms and using theoretical examples only. In contrast, Chambers had proposed specific hypotheses, the evolution of placental mammals from marsupials, for example. Following Darwin's publication, Thomas Henry Huxley used the fossils of Archaeopteryx and Hesperornis to argue that the birds are descendants of the dinosaurs.Huxley, T.H. (1876): Lectures on Evolution. New York Tribune. Extra. no 36. In Collected Essays IV: pp 46-138 original text w/ figures Thus, a group of extant animals could be tied to a fossil group. The resulting description, that of dinosaurs \\"giving rise to\\" or being \\"the ancestors of\\" birds, exhibits the essential hallmark of evolutionary taxonomic thinking. The past three decades have seen a dramatic increase in the use of DNA sequences for reconstructing phylogeny and a parallel shift in emphasis from evolutionary taxonomy towards Hennig's 'phylogenetic systematics'. Today, with the advent of modern genomics, scientists in every branch of biology make use of molecular phylogeny to guide their research. One common method is multiple sequence alignment. Cavalier-Smith, G. G. Simpson and Ernst MayrMahner, Martin; Bunge, Mario. Foundations of Biophilosophy. Springer, p. 251. are some representative evolutionary taxonomists.  New methods in modern evolutionary systematics  Efforts in combining modern methods of cladistics, phylogenetics, and DNA analysis with classical views of taxonomy have recently appeared. Certain authors have found that phylogenetic analysis is acceptable scientifically as long as paraphyly at least for certain groups is allowable. Such a stance is promoted in papers by Tod F. Stuessy and others. A particularly strict form of evolutionary systematics has been presented by Richard H. Zander in a number of papers, but summarized in his \\"Framework for Post-Phylogenetic Systematics\\". Briefly, Zander's pluralistic systematics is based on the incompleteness of each of the theories: A method that cannot falsify a hypothesis is as unscientific as a hypothesis that cannot be falsified. Cladistics generates only trees of shared ancestry, not serial ancestry. Taxa evolving seriatim cannot be dealt with by analyzing shared ancestry with cladistic methods. Hypotheses such as adaptive radiation from a single ancestral taxon cannot be falsified with cladistics. Cladistics offers a way to cluster by trait transformations but no evolutionary tree can be entirely dichotomous. Phylogenetics posits shared ancestral taxa as causal agents for dichotomies yet there is no evidence for the existence of such taxa. Molecular systematics uses DNA sequence data for tracking evolutionary changes, thus paraphyly and sometimes phylogenetic polyphyly signal ancestor- descendant transformations at the taxon level, but otherwise molecular phylogenetics makes no provision for extinct paraphyly. Additional transformational analysis is needed to infer serial descent. Cladogram of the moss genus Didymodon showing taxon transformations. Colors denote dissilient groups.The Besseyan cactus or commagram is the best evolutionary tree for showing both shared and serial ancestry. First, a cladogram or natural key is generated. Generalized ancestral taxa are identified and specialized descendant taxa are noted as coming off the lineage with a line of one color representing the progenitor through time. A Besseyan cactus or commagram is then devised that represents both shared and serial ancestry. Progenitor taxa may have one or more descendant taxa. Support measures in terms of Bayes factors may be given, following Zander's method of transformational analysis using decibans. Cladistic analysis groups taxa by shared traits but incorporates a dichotomous branching model borrowed from phenetics. It is essentially a simplified dichotomous natural key, although reversals are tolerated. The problem, of course, is that evolution is not necessarily dichotomous. An ancestral taxon generating two or more descendants requires a longer, less parsimonious tree. A cladogram node summarizes all traits distal to it, not of any one taxon, and continuity in a cladogram is from node to node, not taxon to taxon. This is not a model of evolution, but is a variant of hierarchical cluster analysis (trait changes and non-ultrametric branches. This is why a tree based solely on shared traits is not called an evolutionary tree but merely a cladistic tree. This tree reflects to a large extent evolutionary relationships through trait transformations but ignores relationships made by species-level transformation of extant taxa. A Besseyan cactus evolutionary tree of the moss genus Didymodon with generalized taxa in color and specialized descendants in white. Support measures are given in terms of Bayes factors, using deciban analysis of taxon transformation. Only two progenitors are considered unknown shared ancestors.Phylogenetics attempts to inject a serial element by postulating ad hoc, undemonstrable shared ancestors at each node of a cladistic tree. There are in number, for a fully dichotomous cladogram, one less invisible shared ancestor than the number of terminal taxa. We get, then, in effect a dichotomous natural key with an invisible shared ancestor generating each couplet. This cannot imply a process-based explanation without justification of the dichotomy, and supposition of the shared ancestors as causes. The cladistic form of analysis of evolutionary relationships cannot falsify any genuine evolutionary scenario incorporating serial transformation, according to Zander. Zander has detailed methods for generating support measures for molecular serial descent and for morphological serial descent using Bayes factors and sequential Bayes analysis through Turing deciban or Shannon informational bit addition. The Tree of Life Evolution of the vertebrates at class level, width of spindles indicating number of families. Spindle diagrams are often used in evolutionary taxonomy. As more and more fossil groups were found and recognized in the late 19th and early 20th century, palaeontologists worked to understand the history of animals through the ages by linking together known groups. The Tree of life was slowly being mapped out, with fossil groups taking up their position in the tree as understanding increased. These groups still retained their formal Linnaean taxonomic ranks. Some of them are paraphyletic in that, although every organism in the group is linked to a common ancestor by an unbroken chain of intermediate ancestors within the group, some other descendants of that ancestor lie outside the group. The evolution and distribution of the various taxa through time is commonly shown as a spindle diagram (often called a Romerogram after the American palaeontologist Alfred Romer) where various spindles branch off from each other, with each spindle representing a taxon. The width of the spindles are meant to imply the abundance (often number of families) plotted against time. Vertebrate palaeontology had mapped out the evolutionary sequence of vertebrates as currently understood fairly well by the closing of the 19th century, followed by a reasonable understanding of the evolutionary sequence of the plant kingdom by the early 20th century. The tying together of the various trees into a grand Tree of Life only really became possible with advancements in microbiology and biochemistry in the period between the World Wars.  Terminological difference  The two approaches, evolutionary taxonomy and the phylogenetic systematics derived from Willi Hennig, differ in the use of the word \\"monophyletic\\". For evolutionary systematicists, \\"monophyletic\\" means only that a group is derived from a single common ancestor. In phylogenetic nomenclature, there is an added caveat that the ancestral species and all descendants should be included in the group. The term \\"holophyletic\\" has been proposed for the latter meaning. As an example, amphibians are monophyletic under evolutionary taxonomy, since they have arisen from fishes only once. Under phylogenetic taxonomy, amphibians do not constitute a monophyletic group in that the amniotes (reptiles, birds and mammals) have evolved from an amphibian ancestor and yet are not considered amphibians. Such paraphyletic groups are rejected in phylogenetic nomenclature, but are considered a signal of serial descent by evolutionary taxonomists.

It is also the term given to a scoring shot where the ball is hit to, or beyond, that perimeter. Edge of the field The boundary is the edge of the playing field, or the physical object (often a rope) marking the edge of the field. In low-level matches, a series of plastic cones are sometimes used. Since the early 2000s, the boundaries at professional matches are often a series of padded cushions carrying sponsors' logos strung along a rope. If it is accidentally moved during play (such as by a fielder sliding into the rope in an attempt to stop the ball) the boundary is considered to remain at the point where that object first stood. A traditional boundary rope When the cricket ball is inside the boundary, it is live. When the ball is touching the boundary, grounded beyond the boundary, or being touched by a fielder who is himself either touching the boundary or grounded beyond it, it is dead and the batting side usually scores 4 or 6 runs for hitting the ball over the boundary. Because of this rule, fielders near the boundary attempting to intercept the ball while running or diving often flick the ball back in to the field of play rather than pick it up directly, because their momentum could carry them beyond the rope while holding the ball. They then return to the field to pick the ball up and throw it back to the bowler. A law change in 2010 declared that a fielder could not jump from behind the boundary and, while airborne, parry the ball back on to the field. Scoring runs A boundary is the scoring of four or six runs from a single delivery, with the ball reaching or crossing the boundary of the playing field, and touching either the boundary or the ground, while either having touched the ground within the playing field first (in the case of four runs) or not (six runs); these events are known as a four or a six respectively. Occasionally there is an erroneous use of the term boundary as a synonym for a \\"four\\". For example, sometimes commentators say such as \\"There were seven boundaries and three sixes in the innings.\\" The correct terminology would be \\"There were ten boundaries in the innings of which seven were fours and three were sixes.\\" When this happens the runs are automatically added to the batsman's and his team's score and the ball becomes dead. If the ball did not touch the bat or a hand holding the bat, four runs are scored as the relevant type of extra instead; six runs cannot be scored as extras, even if the ball clears the boundary, which is in any case extremely unlikely. Note that any runs the batsmen completed by running before the ball reached the edge of the field don't count in the case of a boundary, unless they are greater than the number of runs that would be scored by the boundary, in which case it is the runs from the boundary that are discounted. A batsman scoring a six during a game at Chrishall, Essex The scoring of a four or six by a good aggressive shot displays a certain amount of mastery by the batsman over the bowler, and is usually greeted by applause from the spectators. Fours resulting from an edged stroke, or from a shot that did not come off as the batsman intended, are considered bad luck to the bowler. As a batsman plays himself in and becomes more confident as his innings progresses, the proportion of his runs scored in boundaries often rises. An average first-class match usually sees between 50 and 150 boundary fours. Sixes are less common, and usually fewer than 10 (and sometimes none) will be scored in the course of a match (especially a Test match). The Laws allow for captains to change the boundary allowances (number of runs scored through either type of boundary) through a pre-match agreement. Four runs Four runs are scored if the ball bounces, or rolls along the ground, before touching or going over the edge of the field. Four runs are scored as overthrows if a fielder gathers the ball and then throws it so that no other fielder can gather it before it reaches the boundary. In this case, the batsman who hit the ball scores however many runs the batsmen had run up to that time, plus four additional runs, and it is counted as a boundary. If the ball has not come off the bat or hand holding the bat, then the runs are classified as 'extras' and are added to the team's score but not to the score of any individual batsman. Four runs (or more) can also be scored by hitting the ball into the outfield and running between the wickets. Four runs scored in this way is referred to as an \\"all run four\\" and is not counted as a boundary.  Six runs  Six runs are scored if the ball does not bounce before passing over the boundary in the air. Prior to 1910, six runs were only awarded for hits out of the ground,\\"Ask Steven\\", 23 January 2006 Retrieved 7 July 2011 with five runs awarded for clearing the boundary. Records Sixes Shahid Afridi holds the world record for most sixes in ODIs. The record for most sixes in a Test match innings is 12, which was achieved by Pakistani all-rounder Wasim Akram during an innings of 257 not out against Zimbabwe in October 1996 at Sheikhupura. The One Day International record for most sixes hit in an innings is held by Eoin Morgan, who hit 17 sixes against Afghanistan at Old Trafford on 18 June 2019 in his innings of 148 off 71 balls. Brendon McCullum currently holds the record for most sixes in a Test career with 107. Shahid Afridi holds the record for most sixes in an ODI career (351 in 398 matches, 369 innings, on his retirement). MCG a yellow seat marks the biggest six hit at the ground. The record for the most sixes in a Test match is 27, which occurred during a 2006 Test match between Pakistan and India at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad. In their first innings, Pakistan hit eleven sixes. India hit nine in their first innings. Pakistan hit seven more sixes in their second innings. The record for most sixes in a One Day International is 46, which was achieved in a match between West Indies and England at St George‚Äôs on 27 February 2019. England hit 24 and West Indies hit 22 sixes. The equivalent record in Twenty20 Internationals was set on the AMI Stadium, 24 sixes were hit during the Twenty20 International match between India and New Zealand on 25 February 2009. In 2012, during the First Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka, West Indies cricketer Chris Gayle became the first player to hit a six off the first ball in a Test cricket match. Six sixes in an over As of January 2020, feat has occurred seven times in top level domestic or international cricket: On 31 August 1968, Garfield Sobers became the first man to hit six sixes off a single six-ball over in first- class cricket. The over was bowled by Malcolm Nash in Nottinghamshire's first innings against Glamorgan at St Helen's in Swansea. Nash was a seam bowler but decided to try his arm at spin bowling. This achievement was caught on film. On 10 January 1985, Ravi Shastri equaled Garry Sobers's record of hitting six sixes in an over in first class cricket. On 16 March 2007, in a match between South Africa and the Netherlands at the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Herschelle Gibbs became the first person to hit six sixes off an over in a One Day International match. The over was bowled by Dutch leg-spinner Daan van Bunge. On 19 September 2007, during a match between England and India in the inaugural T20 World Cup, Yuvraj Singh became the first batsman to hit six sixes in an over in a T20 International, in an over bowled by Stuart Broad. On 24 April 2013, Jordan Clark hit six sixes for Lancashire 2nd XI off Yorkshire 2nd XI's Gurman Randhawa at Scarborough. On 23 July 2017, Worcestershire's Ross Whiteley hit six sixes off six legal deliveries plus one wide to take the total number of runs in that over to 37 off bowler Karl Carver of Yorkshire at Headingley during a NatWest T20 Blast match. In October 2018 Afghan player Hazratullah Zazai hit six sixes in an over, becoming the third ever batsman to do so in a Twenty20 match. On 5 January 2020, in the 2019‚Äì20 Super Smash match between Canterbury and Northern Districts, Leo Carter hit six sixes in one over off the bowling of Anton Devcich.

The concept has been elaborated further from an \\"Anglo-Neo Foucauldian\\" perspective in the social sciences, especially by authors such as Peter Miller, Nikolas Rose, and Mitchell Dean. Governmentality can be understood as: * the organized practices (mentalities, rationalities, and techniques) through which subjects are governedMayhew, Susan (ed) A Dictionary of Geography (Article: Governmentality) Oxford University Press, 2004 Governmentality may also be understood as: * the \\"art of government\\" * the \\"how\\" of governing (that is, the calculated means of directing how we behave and act)Jeffreys and Sigley (2009) 'Governmentality, Governance and China' in China's Governmentalities, (ed.)

Lectures at the College de France, 1978‚Äê79. Palgrave MacMillan Semantics This term was thought by some commentators to be made by the \\"...linking of governing (\\"gouverner\\") and modes of thought (\\"mentalit√©\\")\\". In fact, it was not coined by uniting words \\"gouvernement\\" and \\"mentalit√©\\", but simply by making gouvernement into gouvernementalit√© just like musical into musicalit√© [i.e. government + -al- adjective + -it√© abstract noun] (see Michel Senellart's \\"Course Context\\" in Foucault's \\"Security, territory, population\\" lectures). To fully understand this concept, it is important to realize that in this case, Foucault does not only use the standard, strictly political definition of \\"governing\\" or government used today, but he also uses the broader definition of governing or government that was employed until the eighteenth century.Burchell, 90 That is to say, that in this case, for Foucault, \\"...'government' also signified problems of self-control, guidance for the family and for children, management of the household, directing the soul, etc.\\"Lemke, 2 In other words, for our purposes, government is \\"...the conduct of conduct...\\"Foucault in Burchell, 48 Basic definition In his lectures at the Coll√®ge de France, Foucault often defines governmentality as the \\"art of government\\" in a wide sense, i.e. with an idea of \\"government\\" that is not limited to state politics alone, that includes a wide range of control techniques, and that applies to a wide variety of objects, from one's control of the self to the \\"biopolitical\\" control of populations. In the work of Foucault, this notion is indeed linked to other concepts such as biopolitics and power-knowledge. The genealogical exploration of the modern state as \\"problem of government\\" does not only deepen Foucault's analyses on sovereignty and biopolitics; it offers an analytics of government which refines both Foucault's theory of power and his understanding of freedom. The concept of \\"governmentality\\" develops a new understanding of power. Foucault encourages us to think of power not only in terms of hierarchical, top-down power of the state. He widens our understanding of power to also include the forms of social control in disciplinary institutions (schools, hospitals, psychiatric institutions, etc.), as well as the forms of knowledge. Power can manifest itself positively by producing knowledge and certain discourses that get internalised by individuals and guide the behaviour of populations. This leads to more efficient forms of social control, as knowledge enables individuals to govern themselves. \\"Governmentality\\" applies to a variety of historical periods and to different specific power regimes. However, it is often used (by other scholars and by Foucault himself) in reference to \\"neoliberal governmentality\\", i.e. to a type of governmentality that characterizes advanced liberal democracies. In this case, the notion of governmentality refers to societies where power is de-centered and its members play an active role in their own self-government, e.g. as posited in neoliberalism. Because of its active role, individuals need to be regulated from 'inside'. A particular form of governmentality is characterized by a certain form of knowledge (\\"savoir\\" in French). In the case of neoliberal governmentality (a kind of governmentality based on the predominance of market mechanisms and of the restriction of the action of the state) the knowledge produced allows the construction of auto-regulated or auto-correcting selves. In his lecture titled Governmentality, Foucault gives us a definition of governmentality: As Foucault's explicit definition is rather broad, perhaps further examination of this definition would be useful. We shall begin with a closer inspection of the first part of Foucault's definition of governmentality: This strand of the three-part definition states that governmentality is, in other words, all of the components that make up a government that has as its end the maintenance of a well-ordered and happy society (population). The government's means to this end is its \\"apparatuses of security,\\" that is to say, the techniques it uses to provide this society a feeling of economic, political, and cultural well-being. The government achieves these ends by enacting \\"political economy,\\" and in this case, the meaning of economy is the older definition of the term, that is to say, \\"economy at the level of the entire state, which means exercising towards its inhabitants, and the wealth and behavior of each and all, a form of surveillance and control as attentive as that of the head of a family over his household and his goods\\".Burchell, 92 Thus, we see that this first part of the definition states that governmentality is a government with specific ends, means to these ends, and particular practices that should lead to these ends. The second part of Foucault's definition (the \\"resulting, on the one hand, in formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses, and, on the other, in the development of a whole complex of savoirs\\") presents governmentality as the long, slow development of Western governments which eventually took over from forms of governance like sovereignty and discipline into what it is today: bureaucracies and the typical methods by which they operate. The next and last part of Foucault's definition of governmentality can be restated as the evolution from the Medieval state, which maintained its territory and an ordered society within this territory through a blunt practice of simply imposing its laws upon its subjects, to the early Renaissance state, which became more concerned with the \\"disposing of things\\",Burchell, 95 and so began to employ strategies and tactics to maintain a content and thus stable society, or in other words to \\"render a society governable\\".Jones 174 Thus, if one takes these three definitions together, governmentality may be defined as the process through which a form of government with specific ends (a happy and stable society), means to these ends (\\"apparatuses of security\\"Burchell, 102), and with a particular type of knowledge (\\"political economy\\"), to achieve these ends, evolved from a medieval state of justice to a modern administrative state with complex bureaucracies. History of the term The concept of governmentality segues from Foucault's ethical, political and historical thoughts from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. His most widely known formulation of this notion is his lecture entitled \\"Security, territory and population\\" (1978). A deeper and richer reflection on the notion of governmentality is provided in Foucault's course on \\"The Birth of Biopolitics\\" at the Coll√®ge de France in 1978‚Äì1979. The course was first published in French in 2004 as Naissance de la biopolitique: Cours au Coll√®ge de France (1978-1979) (Paris: Gallimard & Seuil). This notion is also part of a wider analysis on the topic of disciplinary institutions, on neoliberalism and the \\"Rule of Law\\", the \\"microphysics of power\\" and also on what Foucault called biopolitics. In the second and third volumes of The History of Sexuality, namely, The Use of Pleasure (1984) and The Care of the Self (1984), and in his lecture on \\"Technologies of the Self\\" (1982), Foucault elaborated a distinction between subjectivation and forms of subjectification by exploring how selves were fashioned and then lived in ways which were both heteronomously and autonomously determined. Also, in a series of lectures and articles, including \\"The Birth of Biopolitics\\" (1979), \\"Omnes et Singulatim: Towards a Criticism of Political Reason\\" (1979), \\"The Subject and Power\\" (1982) and \\"What is Enlightenment?\\" (1984), he posed questions about the nature of contemporary social orders, the conceptualization of power, human freedom and the limits, possibilities and sources of human actions, etc. that were linked to his understanding of the notion of \\"governmentality\\". The notion of governmentality (not to confuse with governance) gained attention in the English-speaking academic world mainly through the edited book The Foucault Effect (1991), which contained a series of essays on the notion of governmentality, together with a translation of Foucault's 1978 short text on \\"gouvernementalit√©\\". Further developments of the concept Hunt and Wickham, in their work Foucault and Law [1994] begin the section on governmentality with a very basic definition derived from Foucault's work. They state, \\"governmentality is the dramatic expansion in the scope of government, featuring an increase in the number and size of the governmental calculation mechanisms\\" [1994:76]. In other words, governmentality describes the new form of governing that arose in the mid-eighteenth century that was closely allied with the creation and growth of the modern bureaucracies. In giving this definition, Hunt and Wickham conceive of the term as consisting of two parts 'governmental' and '‚Äìity' - governmental meaning pertaining to the government of a country; and the suffix ‚Äìity meaning the study of. They acknowledge that this definition lacks some of Foucault's finer nuances and try to redress this by explaining some more of Foucault's ideas, including reason of state, the problem of population, modern political economy, liberal securitisation, and the emergence of the human sciences\\" [1994:77]. Kerr's approach to the term is more complex. He conceives of the term as an abbreviation of \\"governmental rationality\\" [1999:174]. In other words, it is a way of thinking about the government and the practices of the government. To him it is not \\"a zone of critical-revolutionary study, but one that conceptually reproduces capitalist rule\\" [1999:197] by asserting that some form of government (and power) will always be necessary to control and constitute society. By defining governmentality only in terms of the state, Kerr fails to take account of other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government in this broader sense. Dean's understanding of the term incorporates both other forms of governance and the idea of mentalities of government, as well as Hunt and Wickham's, and Kerr's approaches to the term. In line with Hunt and Wickham's approach, Dean acknowledges that in a very narrow sense, governmentality can be used to describe the emergence of a government that saw that the object of governing power was to optimise, use and foster living individuals as members of a population [1999:19]. He also includes the idea of government rationalities, seeing governmentality as one way of looking at the practices of government. In addition to the above, he sees government as anything to do with conducting oneself or others. This is evident in his description of the word in his glossary: \\"Governmentality: How we think about governing others and ourselves in a wide variety of contexts...\\" [1999:212]. This reflects that the term government to Foucault meant not so much the political or administrative structures of the modern state as the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups may be directed. To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups [Dean, 1999:12]. Dean's main contribution to the definition of the term, however, comes from the way he breaks the term up into 'govern' 'mentality', or mentalities of governing‚Äîmentality being a mental disposition or outlook. This means that the concept of governmentality is not just a tool for thinking about government and governing but also incorporates how and what people who are governed think about the way they are governed. He defines thinking as a \\"collective activity\\" [1999:16], that is, the sum of the knowledge, beliefs and opinions held by those who are governed. He also raises the point that a mentality is not usually \\"examined by those who inhabit it\\" [1999:16]. This raises the interesting point that those who are governed may not understand the unnaturalness of both the way they live and the fact that they take this way of life for granted‚Äîthat the same activity in which they engage in \\"can be regarded as a different form of practice depending on the mentalities that invest it\\" [1999:17]. Dean highlights another important feature of the concept of governmentality‚Äîits reflexivity. He explains: > On the one hand, we govern others and ourselves according to what we take to > be true about who we are, what aspects of our existence should be worked > upon, how, with what means, and to what ends. On the other hand, the ways in > which we govern and conduct ourselves give rise to different ways of > producing truth. [1999:18] By drawing attention to the 'how and why', Dean connects \\"technologies of power\\" [Lemke, 2001:191] to the concept of governmentality. According to Dean any definition of governmentality should incorporate all of Foucault's intended ideas. A complete definition of the term governmentality must include not only government in terms of the state, but government in terms of any \\"conduct of conduct\\" [Dean, 1999:10]. It must incorporate the idea of mentalities and the associations that go with that concept: that it is an attitude towards something, and that it is not usually understood \\"from within its own perspective\\" [1999:16], and that these mentalities are collective and part of a society's culture. It must also include an understanding of the ways in which conduct is governed, not just by governments, but also by ourselves and others. The semantic linking of governing and mentalities in governmentality indicates that it is not possible to study technologies of power without an analysis of the mentality of rule underpinning them. The practice of going to the gym, expounded below, is a useful example because it shows how our choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles have been mobilised and shaped by various technologies of power. Mentality of rule A mentality of rule is any relatively systematic way of thinking about government. It delineates a discursive field in which the exercise of power is 'rationalised' [Lemke, 2001:191]. Thus Neo-liberalism is a mentality of rule because it represents a method of rationalising the exercise of government, a rationalisation that obeys the internal rule of maximum economy [Foucault, 1997:74]. Fukuyama [in Rose, 1999: 63] writes \\"a liberal State is ultimately a limited State, with governmental activity strictly bounded by the sphere of individual liberty\\". However, only a certain type of liberty, a certain way of understanding and exercising freedom is compatible with Neo-liberalism. If Neo-liberalist government is to fully realize its goals, individuals must come to recognize and act upon themselves as both free and responsible [Rose, 1999:68]. Thus Neo-liberalism must work to create the social reality that it proposes already exists. For as Lemke states, a mentality of government \\"is not pure, neutral knowledge that simply re-presents the governing reality\\" [Lemke, 2001:191] instead, Neo-liberalism constitutes an attempt to link a reduction in state welfare services and security systems to the increasing call for subjects to become free, enterprising, autonomous individuals. It can then begin to govern its subjects, not through intrusive state bureaucracies backed with legal powers, the imposition of moral standards under a religious mandate, but through structuring the possible field of action in which they govern themselves, to govern them through their freedom. Through the transformation of subjects with duties and obligations, into individuals, with rights and freedoms, modern individuals are not merely 'free to choose' but obliged to be free, \\"to understand and enact their lives in terms of choice\\" [Rose, 1999:87]. This freedom is a different freedom to that offered in the past. It is a freedom to realize our potential and our dreams through reshaping the way in which we conduct our lives.  From governmentality to neoliberal governmentality: cartography  = Governmentality and cartography = Cartographic mapping has historically been a key strategy of governmentality. Harley, drawing on Foucault, affirms that State-produced maps \\"extend and reinforce the legal statutes, territorial imperatives, and values stemming from the exercise of political power\\". Typically, State-led mapping conforms to Bentham's concept of a panopticon, in which 'the one views the many'. From a Foucauldian vantage point, this was the blueprint for disciplinary power. = Neoliberal governmentality and cartography = Through processes of neoliberalism, the State has \\"hollowed out\\" some of its cartographic responsibilities and delegated power to individuals who are at a lower geographical scale. 'People's cartography' is believed to deliver a more democratic spatial governance than traditional top-down State-distribution of cartographic knowledge. Thus subverting Harley's theory that mapping is uniquely a source of power for the powerful. Joyce challenges Foucauldian notions of Panopticism, contending that neoliberal governmentality is more adequately conceptualised by an omniopticon - 'the many surveilling the many'. Collaborative mapping initiatives utilising GPS technology are arguably omniopticons, with the ability to reverse the panoptic gaze. Self-governing capabilities Through our freedom, particular self-governing capabilities can be installed in order to bring our own ways of conducting and evaluating ourselves into alignment with political objectives [Rose, 1996:155]. These capabilities are enterprise and autonomy. Enterprise here designates an array of rules for the conduct of one's everyday existence: energy, initiative, ambition, calculation, and personal responsibility. The enterprising self will make an enterprise of its life, seek to maximize its own human capital, project itself a future, and seek to shape life in order to become what it wishes to be. The enterprising self is thus both an active self and a calculating self, a self that calculates about itself and that acts upon itself in order to better itself [Rose, 1996:154]. Autonomy is about taking control of our undertakings, defining our goals, and planning to achieve our needs through our own powers [Rose, 1996:159]. The autonomy of the self is thus not the eternal antithesis of political power, but one of the objectives and instruments of modern mentalities for the conduct of conduct [Rose, 1996:155]. These three qualities: freedom, enterprise and autonomy are embodied in the practice of going to the gym. It is our choice to go the gym, our choice which gym to go to. By going to the gym we are working on ourselves, on our body shape and our physical fitness. We are giving ourselves qualities to help us perform better than others in life, whether to attract a better mate than others, or to be able to work more efficiently, more effectively and for longer without running out of steam to give us an advantage over our competitors. When we go to the gym, we go through our own discipline, on our own timetable, to reach our own goals. We design and act out our routine by ourselves. We do not need the ideas or support of a team, it is our self that makes it possible. The practice of going to the gym, of being free, enterprising, autonomous, is imbued with particular technologies of power. Technologies of power Technologies of power are those \\"technologies imbued with aspirations for the shaping of conduct in the hope of producing certain desired effects and averting certain undesired ones\\" [Rose, 1999:52]. The two main groups of technologies of power are technologies of the self, and technologies of the market. Foucault defined technologies of the self as techniques that allow individuals to effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their own bodies, minds, souls, and lifestyle, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, and quality of life. Technologies of the market are those technologies based around the buying and selling of goods that enable us to define who we are, or want to be. These two technologies are not always completely distinct, as both borrow bits of each other from time to time. =Technologies of the self= Technologies of the self refer to the practices and strategies by which individuals represent to themselves their own ethical self-understanding. One of the main features of technologies of self is that of expertise. Expertise has three important aspects. First, its grounding of authority in a claim to scientificity and objectivity creates distance between self-regulation and the state that is necessary with liberal democracies. Second, expertise can \\"mobilise and be mobilised within political argument in distinctive ways, producing a new relationship between knowledge and government. Expertise comes to be accorded a particular role in the formulation of programs of government and in the technologies that seek to give them effect\\" [Rose, 1996:156]. Third, expertise operates through a relationship with the self-regulating abilities of individuals. The plausibility inherent in a claim to scientificity binds \\"subjectivity to truth and subjects to experts\\" [Rose, 1996:156]. Expertise works through a logic of choice, through a transformation of the ways in which individuals constitute themselves, through \\"inculcating desires for self-development that expertise itself can guide and through claims to be able to allay the anxieties generated when the actuality of life fails to live up to its image [Rose, 1999:88]. The technologies of the self involved in the practice of, for example, going to the gym are the: technology of responsibilisation, technology of healthism, technology of normalisation and technology of self-esteem. =Responsibilisation= In line with its desire to reduce the scope of government (e.g. welfare) Neo-liberalism characteristically develops indirect techniques for leading and controlling individuals without being responsible for them. The main mechanism is through the technology of responsibilisation. This entails subjects becoming responsibilised by making them see social risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, public safety etc. not as the responsibility of the state, but actually lying in the domain for which the individual is responsible and transforming it into a problem of 'self-care' [Lemke, 2001:201] and of 'consumption'.* The practice of going to the gym can be seen as a result of responsibilisation, our responsibility to remain free of illness so as to be able to work and to care for our dependants (children, elderly parents etc.) This technology somewhat overlaps with the technology of healthism. =Healthism= Healthism links the \\"public objectives for the good health and good order of the social body with the desire of individuals for health and well-being\\" [Rose, 1999:74]. Healthy bodies and hygienic homes may still be objectives of the state, but it no longer seeks to discipline, instruct, moralise or threaten us into compliance. Rather \\"individuals are addressed on the assumption that they want to be healthy and enjoined to freely seek out the ways of living most likely to promote their own health\\" [Rose, 1999:86-87] such as going to the gym. However while the technology of responsibilisation may be argued to be a calculated technique of the state, the wave of Healthism is less likely to be a consequence of state planning, but arising out of the newer social sciences such as nutrition and human movement. Healthism assigns, as do most technologies of the self, a key role to experts. For it is experts who can tell us how to conduct ourselves in terms of safe, precise techniques to improve cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and overall health. The borrowing from technologies of the market by technologies of the self can be clearly seen in the area of healthism. The idea of health, the goal of being healthy, the joys brought by good health and the ways of achieving it are advertised to us in the same manner as goods and services are marketed by sales people. By adhering to the principles of healthism, our personal goals are aligned with political goals and we are thus rendered governable. =Normalisation= Another technology of power arising from the social sciences is that of normalisation. The technology of norms was given a push by the new methods of measuring population. A norm is that \\"which is socially worthy, statistically average, scientifically healthy and personally desirable\\".Rose, 1999:76 The important aspect of normality, is that while the norm is natural, those who wish to achieve normality will do so by working on themselves, controlling their impulses in everyday conduct and habits, and inculcating norms of conduct into their children, under the guidance of others. Norms are enforced through the calculated administration of shame. Shame entails an anxiety over the exterior behaviour and appearance of the self, linked to an injunction to care for oneself in the name of achieving quality of life [Rose, 1999:73]. Norms are usually aligned with political goals, thus the norm would be fit, virile, energetic individuals, able to work, earn money, and spend it and thus sustain the economy. For instance, the practice of going to the gym allows one to achieve this 'normality'. Through shame we are governed into conforming with the goals of Neo-liberalism. =Self-esteem= Self-esteem is a practical and productive technology linked to the technology of norms, which produces of certain kinds of selves. Self-esteem is a technology in the sense that it is a specialised knowledge of how to esteem ourselves to estimate, calculate, measure, evaluate, discipline, and to judge our selves.Cruikshank, 1996:273 The 'self-esteem' approach considers a wide variety of social problems to have their source in a lack of self-esteem on the part of the persons concerned. 'Self-esteem' thus has much more to do with self-assessment than with self-respect, as the self continuously has to be measured, judged and disciplined in order to gear personal 'empowerment' to collective yardsticks.Lemke, 2001:202 These collective yardsticks are determined by the norms previously discussed. Self- esteem is a technology of self for \\"evaluating and acting upon ourselves so that the police, the guards and the doctors do not have to do so\\".Cruikshank, 1996:234 By taking up the goal of self-esteem, we allow ourselves to be governable from a distance. The technology of self-esteem and other similar psychological technologies also borrow from technologies of the market, namely consumption. A huge variety of self-help books, tapes, videos and other paraphernalia are available for purchase by the individual. =Technologies of the market= The technologies of the market that underlie the practice of going to the gym can be described as the technology of desire, and the technology of identity through consumption. The technology of desire is a mechanism that induces in us desires that we work to satisfy. Marketers create wants and artificial needs in us through advertising goods, experiences and lifestyles that are tempting to us. These advertisements seek to convey the sense of individual satisfaction brought about by the purchase or use of this product.Rose,1999:86 We come to desire these things and thus act in a manner that allows us to achieve these things, whether by working harder and earning more money or by employing technologies of the self to shape our lifestyle to the manner we desire . The borrowing of technologies of the self by technologies of the market extends even further in this case. Marketers use the knowledge created by psyche- discourses, especially psychological characteristics as the basis of their market segmentation. This allows them to appeal more effectively to each individual. Thus we are governed into purchasing commodities through our desire. The technology of identity through consumption utilises the power of goods to shape identities.Rose,1999:76 Each commodity is imbued with a particular meaning, which is reflected upon those who purchase it, illuminating the kind of person they are, or want to be. Consumption is portrayed as placing an individual within a certain form of life. The technology of identity through consumption can be seen in the choices that face the gym attendee. To go to an expensive gym because it demonstrates wealth/success or to go to a moderately priced gym so as to appear economical. The range of gym wear is extensive. Brand name to portray the abilities portrayed in its advertising, expensive to portray commitment, or cheap to portray your unconcern for other people's opinions. All of these choices of consumption are used to communicate our identity to others, and thus we are governed by marketers into choosing those products that identify with our identity. These technologies of the market and of the self are the particular mechanisms whereby individuals are induced into becoming free, enterprising individuals who govern themselves and thus need only limited direct governance by the state. The implementation of these technologies is greatly assisted by experts from the social sciences. These experts operate a regime of the self, where success in life depends on our continual exercise of freedom, and where our life is understood, not in terms of fate or social status, but in terms of our success or failure in acquiring the skills and making the choices to actualise ourself.Rose,1999:87 If we engage in the practice of going to the gym, we are undertaking an exercise in self- government. We do so by drawing upon certain forms of knowledge and expertise provided by gym instructors, health professionals, of the purveyors of the latest fitness fad. Depending on why we go to the gym, we may calculate number of calories burned, heart-rate, or muscle size. In all cases, we attend the gym for a specific set of reasons underpinned by the various technologies of the self and the market. The part of ourselves we seek to work upon, the means by which we do so, and who we hope to become, all vary according to the nature of the technology of power by which we are motivated [Dean, 1999:17]. All of these various reasons and technologies are underpinned by the mentality of government that seeks to transform us into a free, enterprising, autonomous individual: Neo-liberalism. Furthermore, Neo-liberalism seeks to create and disseminate definitions of freedom, autonomy and what it means to be enterprising that re-create forms of behavior amenable to neo-liberal goals. Ecogovernmentality Ecogovernmentality (or eco-governmentality) is the application of Foucault's concepts of biopower and governmentality to the analysis of the regulation of social interactions with the natural world. Timothy W. Luke theorized this as environmentality and green governmentality. Ecogovernmentality began in the mid-1990s with a small body of theorists (Luke, Darier, and Rutherford) the literature on ecogovernmentality grew as a response to the perceived lack of Foucauldian analysis of environmentalism and in environmental studies. Following Michel Foucault, writing on ecogovernmentality focuses on how government agencies, in combination with producers of expert knowledge, construct \\"The Environment.\\" This construction is viewed both in terms of the creation of an object of knowledge and a sphere within which certain types of intervention and management are created and deployed to further the government's larger aim of managing the lives of its constituents. This governmental management is dependent on the dissemination and internalization of knowledge/power among individual actors. This creates a decentered network of self-regulating elements whose interests become integrated with those of the State. Crises of governmentality According to Foucault, there are several instances where the Western, \\"liberal art of government\\" enters into a period of crisis, where the logic of ensuring freedom (which was defined against the background of risk or danger) necessitates actions \\"which potentially risk producing exactly the opposite.\\"Foucault, Michel. The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the College de France (1978-9). Trans. Graham Burchell. Ed. Michael Senellart. 1st Picador Paperback Edition. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, 2010, 69. The inherently contradictory logics that lead to such contradictions are identified by Foucault as: # Liberalism depends on the socialization of individuals to fear the constant presence of danger, e.g., public campaigns advocating savings banks, public hygiene, and disease prevention, the development of detective novels as a genre and of news stories of crime, and sexual anxieties surrounding \\"degeneration\\".Foucault, 2008, 66. # Liberal freedom requires disciplinary techniques that manage the individual's behaviour and everyday life so as to ensure productivity and the increase in profit through efficient labour, e.g., Bentham's Panopticon surveillance system. Liberalism claims to supervise the natural mechanisms of behaviour and production, but must intervene when it notices \\"irregularities.\\"Foucault, 2008, 67. # Liberalism must force individuals to be free: control and intervention becomes the entire basis of freedom. Freedom must ultimately be manufactured by control rather than simply \\"counterweighted\\" by it. Examples of this contradictory logic which Foucault cites are the policies of the Keynesian welfare state under F.D. Roosevelt, the thought of the German liberals in the Freiburg school, and the thought of American libertarian economists such as the Chicago School which attempt to free individuals from the lack of freedom perceived to exist under socialism and fascism, but did so by using state interventionist models. These governmental crises may be triggered by phenomena such as a discursive concern with increasing economic capital costs for the exercise of freedom, e.g., prices for purchasing resources, the need for excessive state coercion and interventionism to protect market freedoms, e.g., anti-trust and anti- monopoly legislation that leads to a \\"legal strait-jacket\\" for the state,Foucault, 2008, 68. local protests rejecting the disciplinary mechanisms of the market society and state. and finally, the destructive and wasteful effects of ineffective mechanisms for producing freedom.Foucault, 2008, 69.

Social Policy and Administration 70, 779-86. have recently suggested that the concept of governmentality may be useful in explaining the operation of evidence-based health care and the internalization of clinical guidelines relating to best practice for patient populations, such as those developed by the American Agency for Health Care Research and Quality and the British National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Recent research by Fischer and colleagues at the University of Oxford has renewed interest in Foucault's exploration of potential resistance to governmentality, and its application to health care, drawing on Foucault's recently published final lectures at the College de France. Beyond the West Jeffreys and Sigley (2009) highlight that governmentality studies have focused on advanced liberal democracies, and preclude considerations of non-liberal forms of governmentality in both western and non-western contexts.[ Jeffreys, E. & Sigley, G. 2009, 'Governmentality, governance and China' in Elaine Jeffreys (eds), China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York, USA, pp. 1-23] Recent studies have broken new ground by applying Foucault's concept of governmentality to non-western and non-liberal settings, such as China. Jeffreys (2009) for example provides a collection of essay on China's approach to governance, development, education, the environment, community, religion, and sexual health where the notion of 'Chinese governmentally' is based not on the notion of 'freedom and liberty' as in the western tradition but rather, on a distinct rational approach to planning and administration.[ Jeffreys, E. 2009, China's Governmentalities: governing change, changing government, Routledge, New York. ] Such new studies thus use Foucault's Governmentalities to outline the nature of shifts in governance and contribute to emerging studies of governmentality in non- western contexts.

Michel Foucault Political philosophy Geography Control (social and political) ","title":"Governmentality"},{"id":"711733","text":"Fabian Crisologo Ver (January 20, 1920 ‚Äì November 21, 1998) was a Filipino military officer who served as the Commanding Officer of the Armed Forces of the Philippines under President Ferdinand Marcos. Early life and education Fabian Ver was born on January 20, 1920 and grew up in the town of Sarrat in Ilocos Norte. Ver attended the University of Manila where he obtained a Bachelor of Law degree and later the University of Louisville where he graduated with a degree in police administration in 1963. He also undertook training in Hawaii and with the Los Angeles Police Department. Military and political career A portrait of General Fabian Ver at the AFP Museum in Camp Aguinaldo During World War II, he acted as a guerrilla intelligence officer with the rank of third lieutenant and after the war, he went on in the military service. During then Senator Ferdinand Marcos' term as Senate President in the early 1960s, he was one of his military advisers. He was at that time serving in the Criminal Investigation Service of the Philippine Constabulary with the rank of Captain. The Philippine Constabulary was at that time, a major service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines that deals with law enforcement and peace and order in the country. It is now at present, the Philippine National Police. According to the autobiography book of former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile entitled, \\"Juan Ponce Enrile: A Memoir\\", Ver was a man of Marcos through and through. He could not and would not say no to Marcos and would blindly carry out the wishes and orders of Marcos without question. Thus, he became the most loyal officer to Marcos and upon the latter's election as President of the Philippines in 1965, he became part of the latter's inner circle. And, Ver worked his way up through the military ranks. He was most trusted military officer of then President Ferdinand Marcos as Martial Law was declared on September 21, 1972. and he was also known as one of Marcos' chief enforcers, and was the highest among the Rolex 12. Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile, as the Martial Law Architect, the highest among the Rolex 12. He became further fiercely loyal to Marcos, and Marcos repaid his loyalty by appointing him as the commanding general of the Presidential Security Group, then known as the Presidential Security Command or PSC that tasked to secure Marcos and his family. When he was due for retirement in 1976, Marcos extended his term indefinitely. He also headed the then National Intelligence and Security Authority or NISA (now, the National Intelligence and Coordinating Agency), then, the vast and well-armed and well- equipped intelligence department of the Philippines, sending government agents to search for anti-Marcos critics. It placed spies in all government and private entities. In effect, NISA acts as secret police force of the Marcos regime. And since NISA was under the direct control of the Office of the President, Ver directly reports to Marcos. And under the 1978 National Security Code, NISA also was given functional supervision and control over the Intelligence Service of the AFP or ISAFP, thus its chief reports to Ver directly, thus widening his powers in the military gaining full suzerainty of the ISAFP to further NISA's functions. In fact in the Batas Militar documentary on 1997, the late General Romeo Espino, the then chief of staff of the AFP said Ver was a powerful man and he checks his recommendations for promotions and appointments before it reaches Marcos. And, if Ver decides to release any political prisoner detained by NISA, it equals that of Marcos as his signature is also considered as the latter's. Martial law was lifted in 1981, and Ver was appointed Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines over a cousin, then Major-General Fidel Valdez Ramos, then the chief of the Philippine Constabulary. Thus, Ver became the most powerful officer in the military, as he headed now three institutions: the entire AFP, the PSC and NISA. Police officials, military men, businessmen, politicians, bureaucrats and other prominent figures kowtowed to him. Many feared to displease him as he has direct access to Marcos and has his ear as well as of then First Lady Imelda Marcos. In fact, his three sons, who are all military officers like him were in the zenith of power. His eldest son, Irwin was rapidly promoted to colonel and named chief of staff of the Presidential Security Command. His other son, Rexor was the chief of the close- in security of Marcos and youngest son, Wyrlo, was the commander of the Armored Unit of Malacanang Palace. Irwin Ver graduated no. 1 in the Philippine Military Academy in 1970. During Ver's term as AFP chief of staff, he was biased in favor of the military officers that came from ROTC program by giving them incentives and named them to key important posts in the military, thus, this made the military officers who graduated from the Philippine Military Academy resentful. He also extended schooling privileges to his relatives, friends in the military especially the graduates of professional military schools that are close to him, to Marcos and to Imelda, including those who paid homage to him and filled the high posts in the military with Ilocano ROTC-trained military officers. This was the era of favoritism in the AFP. General Romeo Espino, Ver's predecessor, was AFP Chief of Staff for the longest term in the Philippines military, was like Ver, Espino was too an ROTC graduate in the University of the Philippines, but he was fair in administration of military affairs during his time, unlike Ver. Ver also instituted, along with Marcos, the extension of services in the military of those military officers loyal to them, who overreached their retirement age. As Marcos disregarded the authority of then Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile in the 1980s, he changed the military chain of command. Under the new chain of command, the authority would evolve from Marcos as president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces up to Ver, the chief of staff of the armed forces. As such, Ver replaced Enrile as the second most-powerful high government official in the country, the status which the latter held during martial law when he was tasked to administer it. Aquino assassination and acquittal by Marcos Ver kept aging officers loyal to himself and also to Marcos on the armed forces, thus making young officers disgruntled. The Reform the Armed Forces Movement (RAM) was formed by these young officers, led by then Colonel Gregorio Honasan as a result of this. The RAMboys, as they were known in the Philippines, played a key role in Marcos' overthrow. As the Marcos regime grew unpopular during these years, Marcos would be in and out of office due to kidney ailments. Political mismanagement would ensue, culminating with the 1983 assassination of popular opposition leader and senator Benigno Aquino Jr. upon his return from exile in the United States. The Agrava Commission, an independent fact-finding body put up by Marcos, found evidence to verify that the military and Ver were involved, but he was subsequently acquitted in 1985 by the Sandiganbayan. After the tumultuous snap election on February 7, 1986, Marcos announced that he was replacing Ver with Fidel Ramos due to his alleged ties with Ninoy Aquino's assassination, although he tacitly kept Ver in power.

Ver advised Marcos to give him orders to fire on the swelling number of protesters, but Marcos stubbornly refused to and dismissed him with a salute. This led to the end of the Marcos regime. Following the People Power Revolution, Ver and his family along with the Marcoses were exiled to Hawaii. He was not allowed to return to the country during the administration of Presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel V. Ramos.

However, some recent research has indicated that this Second Sophistic, which was previously thought to have very suddenly and abruptly appeared in the late 1st century, actually had its roots in the early 1st century.Bruce W. Winter, Philo and Paul Among the Sophists. 2nd ed. Grand Rapids: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 2002. It was followed in the 5th century by the philosophy of Byzantine rhetoric, sometimes referred to as the \\"Third Sophistic.\\" Writers known as members of the Second Sophistic include Nicetas of Smyrna, Aelius Aristides, Dio Chrysostom, Herodes Atticus, Favorinus, Philostratus, Lucian, and Polemon of Laodicea. Plutarch is also often associated with the Second Sophistic movement as well, although many historians consider him to have been somewhat aloof from its emphasis on rhetoric, especially in his later work. The term \\"Second Sophistic\\" comes from Philostratus. In his Lives of the Sophists, Philostratus traces the beginnings of the movement to the orator Aeschines in the 4th century BC. But its earliest representative was really Nicetes of Smyrna, in the late 1st century AD. Unlike the original Sophistic movement of the 5th century BC, the Second Sophistic was little concerned with politics. But it was, to a large degree, to meet the everyday needs and respond to the practical problems of Graeco-Roman society. It came to dominate higher education and left its mark on many forms of literature. The period from around AD 50 to 100 was a period when oratorical elements dealing with the first sophists of Greece were reintroduced to the Roman Empire. The province of Asia embraced the Second Sophistic the most. Diococceianus (or Chrysostomos) and Aelius Aristides were popular sophists of the period. They orated over topics like poetry and public speaking. They did not teach debate or anything that had to do with politics because rhetoric was restrained due to the imperial government‚Äôs rules. Owing largely to the influence of Plato and Aristotle, philosophy came to be regarded as distinct from sophistry, the latter being regarded as specious and rhetorical, a practical discipline. Thus, by the time of the Roman Empire, a sophist was simply a teacher of rhetoric and a popular public speaker. For instance, Libanius, Himerius, Aelius Aristides, and Fronto were sophists in this sense. Second Century Sophistic and the Roman Empire Introduction The year 146 BC marks the moment in history in which the Romans conquered one of the first civilized empires in the West. Ancient Greece is known for its rich culture, mythology, technology and intellect. In its Classical Period it was one of the greatest early empires. After the civilization fell to the Roman Conquest, the emerging empire would begin to grow following many of the traditions of the Greeks. Mirroring some of their architectural styles and adapting a similar religious cult, the Empire held the Greek culture with reverence to its customs. Throughout its growth, the Romans incorporated the Greeks into their society and imperial life. In the 1st and 2nd centuries AD a renaissance of Hellenic oratory and education captivated the Roman elites. The resurgence was called the Second Sophistic and it recalled the grand orators and teachings of the 5th century BC. ‚ÄúThe sophist was to revive the antique purer form of religion and to encourage the cults of the heroes and Homeric gods.‚ÄùPhilostratus: The Lives of the Sophists, page xix. Trans. Wright, W.C. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961. In this century, the Roman Emperors such as Trajan, Hadrian and numerous others, held these intellectuals in their high esteem. Many of them paid patronage to Athens and other Greek cities in the Empire.Philostratus: The Lives of the Sophists, page 113. Trans. Wright, W.C. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961. Elites sent their sons to be educated in schools developed by these sophists. The Emperor Hadrian sent his adoptive son Antoninus to study under the acclaimed Polemo in Smyrna. The Second Sophistic opened doors for the Greeks to prosper surprisingly, in many ways on their own terms. This renaissance enabled them to become a prominent society that the Romans could respect and revere. The sophists and their movement provided a way for the Romans to legitimatize themselves as civilized intellectuals and associate themselves with an old imperial pre-eminence. This movement allowed the Greeks to become a part of the Roman Empire but still retain their cultural identity. Definition of sophist Sophism was the revival of the use and value of higher education in the Roman Empire during the 1st and 2nd centuries AD. This also included a renewed emphasis and importance of rhetoric and oratory. The practice and teachings were modeled after the Athenian vocabulary of 400 BC, as well as the Hellenic traditions of that time. The sophists were great lecturers and declaimers who esteemed to address various issues of political, economic and social importance.The Cambridge Ancient History. Vol. XI. 2nd Ed., page 900. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000. Thus, they served a vast array of positions from educational and social leaders, to ambassadors, Imperial Secretaries and high priests.Philostratus: The Lives of the Sophists, page xv. Trans. Wright, W.C. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961. In these orders, they won the favor of Emperors who would restore their eastern centers of intellect. Some like Lucian heavily favored Atticism (an artificial purist movement favoring archaic expressions), while others like Plutarch favored the Greek of their day. A. Oratory A resurgence of educational value occurred during this time and these sophists were at the heart of it. They emphasized the importance of the practice of oratory. Sophists would begin their careers lecturing to groups of students. As they gained recognition and further competence they would begin speaking out to the public. There were two different oratory styles of sophism that developed out of the period of enlightenment: Asianism and Atticism. 1\\\\. Asianism A later sophist who wrote one of the only remaining accounts of these great orators in his Lives of the Sophists, Philostratus describes Asianism as a form that ‚Äú...aims at but never achieves the grand style.‚Äù He adds that its style is more, ‚Äúflowery, bombastic, full of startling metaphors, too metrical, too dependent on the tricks of rhetoric, too emotional.‚Äù This type of rhetoric is also sometimes referred to as ‚ÄúIonian‚Äù and ‚ÄúEphesian‚Äù, because it came from outside of Athens.Philostratus: The Lives of the Sophists, page xx. Trans. Wright, W.C. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961. The historical sophist criticized its form calling it, ‚Äútheatrical shamelessness‚Äù. It seems that this approach of oratory tended to put more emphasis on form, passion and sentiment rather than prudent realities. 2\\\\. Atticism In contrast, the other mode of rhetoric, Atticism, is explained by Philostratus as technique that is exemplified by the sophist Aelius Aristides. He describes Aristides as one who, ‚Äúusually imitates some classical author, aims at simplicity of style, and is a purist, carefully avoiding any allusion or word that does not occur in a writer of the classical period.‚Äù Atticism drew from Greece‚Äôs rich past and originated in its illustrious city of Athens. This is where the majority of the classic Hellenistic culture was cultivated. The impressive lectures and declamations of these sophists were based more upon preparation and the studying of information. Having this basis, they were then able to speak more adeptly about the topics to their audiences. The sophists generally gave their discourses in Rome or one of three major sophist centers. B. Rhetoric The three main centers of sophism lay east of the imperial capital of Rome. They were the core of ancient intellectualism; Ephesus, Smyrna and Athens. The sophists revitalized these cities bringing in wealth, acclaim and foreign interest from around the Empire.G.W. Bowersock, Greek Sophists in the Roman Empire, page 17 (1969 Oxford). They were the ones responsible for providing benefactions to the city and resolving the disputes of its citizens.G.W. Bowersock, Greek Sophists in the Roman Empire, page 26 (1969 Oxford. 1\\\\. Smyrna Smyrna was an important Greek city in the Empire at this age. Two noteworthy sophists were educated and taught in this center; attracting the respect of its citizens. They also invited the attention or patronage of Roman Emperors such as Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. Although neither of these men called the city their birthplace, both Polemo of Laodicea and Aelius Aristides spent much of their time here studying the rhetoric or advocating for its people. Another esteemed sophist in the 2nd century, Herodes Atticus, paved the way for succeeding sophists of Atticism in the great center of Athens.Philostratus: The Lives of the Sophists, page 139. Trans. Wright, W.C. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961. These three eminent connoisseurs of rhetoric were significant sophists of the 2nd century AD. Many succeeding them would strive to replicate and illustrate their immense knowledge of the Hellenic classics and eloquent skills in oratory. Out of all of the Second Sophistic orators, these men possessed significant esteem in the eyes of Emperors. They also provided their provincial regions as well as other areas of the Empire with an abundance of benefactions. 2\\\\. Polemo of Laodicea Polemo of Laodicea was the earliest of the trio. He was born in approximately 85 AD and is the only Asianic orator of Smyrna.Philostratus: The Lives of the Sophists, page 107. Trans. Wright, W.C. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961. Like so many of the other sophists, Polemo came from a ranked family. He, therefore, had connections and status with the local administration and it was easy for him to thrive in political and social aspects. Being from an elite family provided him the means and footing to be able study the sophistic discipline. His wealth and political connections allowed him to travel and prosper in his role as an expert of robust rhetoric. Not only was Polemo admired in Smyrna and other surrounding Greek centers of intellect, he was quite popular and venerated in Rome as well. He acted as a sort of ambassador to the Empire for his area. Polemo found a great deal of favor in the eyes of the Emperors Trajan, Hadrian and Antoninus . They bestowed many luxuries upon the sophist. 3\\\\. Herodes Atticus The Roman elites and Emperors valued the approval and sponsorship of acclaimed sophists. Herodes Atticus, at one point in time, received up to three letters a day from Emperor Marcus Aurelius.Philostratus: The Lives of the Sophists, page 175. Trans. Wright, W.C. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961. The Emperor also waited three days in Smyrna for the honor of meeting the student of Herodes and Polemo, Aelius Aristides.Philostratus: The Lives of the Sophists, page 217. Trans. Wright, W.C. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961. He then was required to wait one more day, before he was allowed to hear him speak. The man at the supposedly highest standing in the entire Empire was subject to the convenience of a man conventionally considered to be of a lower rank. Conclusion It seems that the association and a positive close relationship with these experts of rhetoric were coveted by these imperial officials. The sophists were held with high regard by those in surrounding regions and even by Roman elites and bureaucrats. ‚ÄúNo other type of intellectual could compete with them in popularity, no creative artists existed to challenge their prestige at the courts of phil-Hellenic Emperors, and though the sophists often show jealousy of the philosophers, philosophy without eloquence was nowhere.‚Äù Not only were the wealthy citizens encouraging their sons to follow the sophistic profession, but nobles were more than proud to claim relation with celebrated sophists.Philostratus: The Lives of the Sophists, page xvii.

Works Terre D'Ange Her first novel was Kushiel's Dart, published by Tor Books in 2001, and the recipient of the 2002 Locus Award for Best First Novel. The Kushiel's Legacy trilogy, completed with Kushiel's Chosen and Kushiel's Avatar, follows the story of a courtesan in a historical fantasy or alternate history (Terre d'Ange) society that follows a demi-god, Elua, whose precept is \\"Love as thou wilt\\". The map of Terre d'Ange, the \\"Land of the Angels,\\" bears a striking resemblance to that of France. Fictional versions of Greece, Great Britain, Italy, Germany, and Spain also figure prominently in the series. Elua was born when the blood of Yeshua ben Yosef, the son of the one God, mingled with the tears of the Magdelene and carried in the womb of Mother Earth. With Elua's peaceful wanderings and the one God's rejection of him, seven angels then rejected God to become Elua's companions on Earth. These angels and Elua himself then founded a nation and comingled with humans before leaving. D'Angelines are the people from their descent. The first trilogy, Kushiel's Legacy, begins with the story of Ph√®dre n√≤ Delaunay, a courtesan's flawed and unwanted daughter who is sold into indentured servitude. The second trilogy (named Treason's Heir in the UK and frequently dubbed the Imriel Trilogy in North America), is a continuation of the storyline started in Kushiel's Legacy. The main protagonist is Imriel n√≤ Montr√®ve de la Courcel, third in line for the throne of Terre d'Ange and adopted son of Ph√®dre n√≤ Delaunay de Montr√®ve. The third trilogy, whose third novel Naamah's Blessing came out in June 2011, takes place a century after both trilogies and features the protagonist Moirin of the Maghuinn Dhon. Moirin is half-D'Angeline and half of the Maghuin Donn. She is touched by the blessing of Naamah as well as her diadh-anam, the bear-goddess of the Maghuin Dhonn. After a terrible accident and the revelation that her father is a priest of Naamah, Moirin sets sail for Terre d'Ange in search of a destiny her bear-goddess has foretold. Instead of a seemingly clear destiny, Moirin finds herself in an entanglement of court intrigue, scandal and passion. Tossed between the Queen and her courtier, Moirin must decide which path to take before she bleeds dry in the process. She also meets Lo Feng, a sort-of priest of Ch'in, present day China. Feng teaches our heroine the five styles of breathing and offers a respite from her complicated court life. In following her destiny, she will also follow Feng and his young apprentice across yet another ocean where she will meet a princess possessed by a dragon. This is just the first test Moirin will encounter along her destiny's path. She discovers through her diadh-anam that her true love has never been far away. She will travel through cities, deserts and vast areas in an attempt to join the two together. Through her travels, she will always remember that she still has unfinished business back in Terre d'Ange before she can ever hope to see her mother again.

He was born in Mechelen, Belgium. In 1838 he was recognised as an excellent modeller, presenting his work at a local exhibition in Mechelen. Minister Rogier, who opened the exhibition, was so impressed that he arranged a place for Walschaerts at Li√®ge University. Career In 1842 he joined the Belgian State Railways and two years later had reached the rank of foreman. He was made chief superintendent of the works shortly after but mysteriously, for such a meteoric early career, never rose any higher. He held this position for the rest of his life, first at Mechelen and then at Brussels South. Walschaerts valve gear Whilst at Mechelen in 1844 he developed a new type of valve gear (a mechanism that allows for adjustment of the travel of the valves that distribute the steam to the cylinders and enables a steam locomotive to be put into reverse and to economise steam). He was not permitted by the company to patent the device himself as he was deemed of too lowly a rank. An engineer colleague and friend, M. Fisher, applied for the patent on his behalf but never claimed any contribution to it. Walschaerts name on the documents erroneously omitted the final 's' causing confusion over its correct spelling over the succeeding years. A locomotive built at the Tubize workshops fitted with the Walschaerts valve gear was awarded a gold medal at the 1873 Universal Exhibition in Vienna. This valve gear came to be used in the majority of steam locomotives, and became almost universal throughout the 20th Century.William Wallace Wood, The Walschaert locomotive valve gear; a practical treatise on the locomotive valve actuating mechanism originally invented by Egide Walschaerts, with the history of its development by American and European engine designers, and its evolution into the mechanically correct locomotive valve gear of the present day (englisch; PDF; 2,8 MB), New York, The N.

Splints can be used for injuries that are not severe enough to immobilize the entire injured structure of the body. For instance, a splint can be used for certain fractures, soft tissue sprains, tendon injuries, or injuries awaiting orthopedic treatment. A splint may be static, not allowing motion, or dynamic, allowing controlled motion. Splints can also be used to relieve pain in damaged joints. Splints are quick and easy to apply and do not require a plastering technique. Splints are often made out of some kind of flexible material and a firm pole-like structure for stability. They often buckle or Velcro together.

History  B.C. to A.D.  Splinting is not new to the medical field or the world. It‚Äôs found that splinting has been used since ancient times. Evidence suggests that splint usage dates back to 1500 B.C. that could treat not only fractures but burns as well. These splints were made from materials like, \\"leaves, reeds, bamboo, and bark padded with linen‚Ä¶ [and] copper.\\" Mummies from Egypt have been uncovered wearing splints from previous injuries that were obtained in their lifetime. Hippocrates, alive from 460-377 B.C., was very well known for his discoveries and techniques for splinting. He created a \\"distraction splint\\" that was advanced for his time. The splint, made up of leather cuffs that were separated by slim wooden slats, worked to repair the fracture and realign the bones. Around 1000 A.D. the use of Hippocrates‚Äô splinting technique using plants, like palm branches and cane halves, continued to be practiced. Flour dust, egg whites, and vegetable mixtures were created to form plaster for creating splints. Most splints in ancient times were cast-like and made to immobilize an area of the body. This is illustrated by the Aztecs around 1400 A.D. They made splints with leaves, leather, and paste.  1500s  In the early 1500s gunpowder was introduced to Europe which caused a serious decline in the market of armor making. Armor makers had to figure out how to make a living with the skills they had already acquired. This led to the creation of braces due to the common use of metal in braces. Armor makers were knowledgeable in areas of the exterior anatomy and joint alignment, making braces the obvious replacement for their armor making. In 1517, after the evolution of the armor trade, injuries were being treated by metal braces secured by screws. Jumping to 1592, the first written piece on splints by surgeon Hieronymus Fabricius, shows various drawings of armor-like splints for the entire body.  1700s‚Äì1800s  In the mid-1700s, doctors and mechanics worked with each other to create splints for certain injuries. Surgeons need these mechanics to design and build the splints for them. Most splints were made of metal. Plaster of Paris, a white powdery substance used mostly for casts and molds in the form of a quick-setting paste with water, began to be used for immobilizing splints. This method was not a popular way of splinting as it took too long to dry and suitable fabric was sparse. In the 1800s it was beginning to be recognized that rehabilitation after an injury was important. Orthopedics began to become a separate field from general surgery. A famous British Surgeon, Hugh Owen Thomas, created specialty splints that were cheap and best for injuries that were being rehabilitated. By 1883, mechanics and surgeons separated due to class issues. This created two different areas that shaped the way braces were being created and distributed. Around 1888, F. Gustav Ernst, a dedicated mechanic, released a book illustrating upper body splints. In 1899, orthopedic surgeon Alessandro Codivilla, followed suit and published a book explaining the importance of using surgical procedures to set up better results using splints.

The AIM-65 was essentially an expanded KIM-1 computer. Available software included a line-oriented machine code monitor, BASIC interpreter, assembler, Pascal, PL/65, and FORTH development system. Available hardware included a floppy disk controller and a backplane for expansion.  Features  Rockwell advertised the $375 AIM-65, with 1K RAM, as an \\"easy, inexpensive [computer] ... for learning, designing, work or just fun\\". Standard software included the system console monitor software in ROM, called Advanced Interactive Monitor. It featured an assembler, disassembler, setting and viewing memory and registers, starting execution of other programs and more. Single stepping was made possible using non-maskable interrupt (NMI). The command prompt was the less-than sign \\"<\\", and on receiving a single character command, it added this input character and the greater-than sign \\">\\". If the thermal printer was turned on, this would be output on a single line. The monitor included a number of service routines that could be accessed and used by a user's program to control I/O and code execution, and was fully documented, including source code. The machine featured dual cassette tape control. This made it possible to write large assembly programs using the two-pass assembler ROM. Source code in text was written twice consecutively to the input tape, and then the assembler, which could start/stop the input cassette tape using motor control was invoked. During the first pass the symbol table was built and stored in RAM. During the second pass symbols would be translated and code written out to the second tape, also using start/stop motor control. Being able to avoid storing code in RAM made it possible to save much space. It was however, still important to keep the symbols list short since RAM size was often no more than 4 KB. In 1981, Rockwell introduced an improved model with a 40 character display as the AIM-65/40. An industrial chassis version was known as the System 65 and included a PROM burner and floppy drives. Rockwell was also a pioneer in solid-state storage devices, introducing \\"bubble memory\\" non-volatile expansion boards about 1980. MTU made a \\"Visible Memory\\" card in 1978 that worked with the KIM-1 and AIM-65 computers, providing raster graphics display capability. MTU also made the first real time music synthesizer for a microcomputer; it worked with the KIM-1 and AIM-65, and featured a DAC with software providing 4 voices of wavetable-lookup synthesis. In Spain they were distributed by Comelta. This company made various card expansions: *CR-106 8 Kbytes of RAM *CR-119 RAM / ROM / PROM expansion *CR-120 Universal programming *CR-115 Microcassette controller(two units) *CR-113 Video controller *CR-401 Board Bus Extension(Standard S-64) Comelta assembled all the options in a single box to produce a new computer, the Comelta Drac-1. The first prototype used microcassetes, but definitive versions have two 8\\" floppy disk drives. In the late 1970s, the Rockwell AIM-65, and successor System 65 became the first computers used on board a float in the Tournament of Roses Parade. Cal Poly Universities wrote their own animation control language to control hydraulic and motor actuators on floats for many years. In 2003, some of these 27-year- old computers were still in use controlling various displays and creatures at a high tech Halloween show near Alexandria, Virginia, U.S.A.

It concluded that the computer was \\"an excellent value at the $375 needed for minimum configurations\\".  Programming  PL/65 was a programming language designed and implemented by Rockwell International for the AIM-65. It is based on a mix of ALGOL and PL/I, simplified where possible in order to adapt to the limited processing environment afforded by the 6502 (64k memory for instance).

A sarong or sarung (; meaning \\"string\\" or \\"to sheath\\" in Indonesian languages) is a large tube or length of fabric, often wrapped around the waist, worn in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Maldives, Sri lanka, the Arabian Peninsula, Horn of Africa, East Africa, and on many Pacific islands. The fabric often has woven plaid or checkered patterns, or may be brightly colored by means of batik or ikat dyeing. Many modern sarongs have printed designs, often depicting animals or plants. Different types of sarongs are worn in different places in the world, notably, the lungi in the Indian subcontinent and the izaar in the Arabian Peninsula.  Overview  COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Sarongweefster uit Bandoeng Java TMnr 10014439.jpgSundanese sarong weaver in Bandung, West Java, Dutch East Indies, 1900‚Äì1940. Chau Doc textile.jpgSarung denotes a length of fabric as a garment. Sarong or \\"sarung\\" denotes the lower garment worn by the Indonesian (and other Maritime Southeast Asian) men. This consists of length of fabric about a yard (0.91 m) wide and two-and-a-half yards (2.3 m) long. In the center of this sheet, across the narrower width, a panel of contrasting color or pattern about one foot wide is woven or dyed into the fabric, which is known as the kepala or \\"head\\" of the sarong. This sheet is stitched at the narrower edges to form a tube. One steps into this tube, brings the upper edge above the level of the navel (the hem should be level with the ankles), positions the kepala at the center of the back, and folds in the excess fabric from both sides to the front center, where they overlap and secures the sarong by rolling the upper hem down over itself. Malay men wear sarongs woven in a check pattern; women wear sarongs dyed in the batik method, with, for example, flower motifs, and in brighter colors. However, in Javanese culture, the wearing of batik sarung is not restricted to women on formal occasions such as weddings. The sarong is common wear for women, in formal settings with a kebaya blouse. Malay men wear sarongs in public only when attending Friday prayers at the mosque, but sarongs remain very common casual wear at home for men of all ethnicities and religions in Brunei, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and much of the Indian subcontinent. (In the Indian subcontinent, excluding Sri Lanka, sarongs are sometimes known as mundu or lungi). Regional variations  Arabian Peninsula  Bayt al-Faqih market.jpgYemeni men in traditional sarongs. Bait al-Faqih.jpgYemeni man tying his futah (sarong). Sometimes people keep money and other small utensils in the folds of the futah. Sarongs known under a variety of local names are traditionally worn by the people of Yemen and elsewhere on the Arabian Peninsula. Local names for the garment include f≈´·π≠ah, izaar, wizƒÅr and ma øwaz (pl. ma øƒÅwiz). In Hadhramawt sarong is called ·π£ƒÅr≈´n in the interior and ·π£ƒÅr≈´m in the coastal region. In Oman, sarongs are called wizƒÅr and are often white in color, similar to the Keralan mundu of the Indian subcontinent and it is usually worn under the Thawb. In Saudi Arabia, sarongs are known as izaar. Designs can be checkered or striped as well floral or arabesque, but double plaid (i.e., a vertical section of the izƒÅr with a different plaid pattern) designs from Indonesia are also very popular. In southwestern Saudi Arabia, tribal groups have their own style of unstitched izaar, which is locally woven. This is also worn in northern Yemen. However, the tribal groups in Yemen each have their own design for their f≈´·π≠ah, the latter of which may include tassels and fringes. It is thought that these tribal futah resemble the original izaar as worn on the Arabian Peninsula since pre-Islamic times such as the Shendyt. They are generally worn open and unstitched in such a way that the garment does not reach over one's ankles. Other izaars, often imported from Bangladesh, are the traditional clothing of Arab fishermen of the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. It was the traditional garment for men before the introduction of pant- like pajamas and kaftans during the Turkish and European colonial periods. Tube-stitched, as well as open sarongs, are both worn, even in formal dishdasha-wearing countries, as casual sleepwear and at home. Indian subcontinent LungiBoypagne.jpgBangladeshi boy in a traditional lungi. Bhangra Dance punjab.jpgIndian Bhangra dancers in lungi. Sarongs, very similar to those of South-East Asia and completely different from the Indian subcontinent (excluding Sri Lanka) are widespread ‚Äì in the state of Manipur, where they are called Phanek and Mekhela in Assam which are very similar to traditional attires of other South-East Asian nations. In the South Indian states of Kerala, where they are called mundu (if fully white or fully black) and lungi or kaili if coloured, and Tamil Nadu, where they are called kaili or saaram or vetti or lungi and are usually worn at home. A standard lungi measures 2.12 by 1.2 metres. Unlike the brightly colored Southeast Asian sarongs, the Kerala variety (the mundu) is more often plain white and is worn for ceremonial or religious purposes. In Kerala, the brightly coloured sarongs are called kaily and the white ones are called mundu. The more formal, all- white dhoti is worn for formal and religious occasions. While there are dresses based on the mundu which can be worn by women, they more commonly wear the sari. = Sri Lanka = Sarongs are very common in Sri Lanka and worn only by men. (A similar garment is worn by women. However, the women's garment is called \\"redda\\", which is wrap-around skirt.) It is the standard garment for most men in rural and even some urban communities. However, most men of upper social classes (whose public attire is trousers) wear the sarong only as a convenient night garment or only within the confines of the house. The Tamil- speaking communities, the Sri Lankan Tamils and the Sri Lankan Moors people also call it Saaram or Chaaram. Statistically, the number of people wearing sarong as their primary public attire is on the decline in Sri Lanka; the reason being that the sarong carries the stigma of being the attire for less educated lower social classes. However, there is a trend toward adopting sarong as a fashionable garment or as a formal garment worn with national pride, only on special occasions.http://www.travelsrilanka.com/index.cfm?PAGE=1176 Political and social leaders of Sri Lanka who want to portray their humility and closeness to \\"common man\\" and their nationalism, choose a variation of the sarong nicknamed the \\"national\\" as their public attire.  Horn of Africa  Sarongs are ubiquitous in Somalia and the Muslim-inhabited areas of the Horn of Africa. Although nomadic and urban Somali men have worn them for centuries in the form of a plain white skirt, the colorful macawiis (ma'awiis) sarong, which is the most popular form of the garment in the region, is a relatively recent arrival to Somalia courtesy of trade with the Southeast Asian islands and the Indian subcontinent. Before the 1940s, most macawiis were made of cotton. However, since the industrialization of the market for sarongs, they now come in many fabrics and combinations thereof, including polyester, nylon and silk. Designs vary greatly and range from checkered square motifs with watermarked diamonds and plaid to simple geometric lines. The one constant is that they tend to be quite colorful; black macawiis are rare. Sarongs in Somalia are worn around the waist and folded several times over to secure their position. They are typically sold pre-sewn as one long circular stretch of cloth, though some vendors offer to sew them as a value-added service.

They can be knee- length or ankle-length and come in various colors that are usually unique to the specific ethnic group that wove them. Among men, the skirt is usually drawn up and tied at the waist, forming a trouser-like clothing known as a salawal. They can also serve as shawls or blankets.

April 17, 2008 Among the Maranao people, the malong is featured in the folk dance kapa malong malong which shows the various ways that the malong can be utilized. During the Spanish colonial era, the tapis was worn over a longer Spanish skirt (saya or falda) due to the shortness of the tapis being deemed too immodest by the Spanish clergy to be worn alone. It evolved over time to become part of the traditional Filipino dress for women, the baro't saya. Western world In North and South America as well as Europe, hip wraps are worn as beach wear or as a cover-up over swimwear. The wrap is often made of a thin, light fabric, often rayon, and may feature decorative fringing on both sides. They may have ties, which are long thin straps of fabric which the wearer can tie together to prevent the wrap from falling down. These wraps are mostly worn by women as beach cover ups and do not usually resemble traditional Asian or African sarongs in size, pattern or design. Western men who wear male sarongs are influenced by the Scottish kilt or lava-lava within the Polynesian or Samoan culture. Typically sarongs are worn by men when they are at home or at the beach or as a cover up on a nude beach or by the pool or on a cruise. Securing Numerous tying methods exist to hold a sarong to the wearer's body. In some cases, these techniques customarily differ according to the sex of wearer. If a sarong has ties, they may be used to hold it in place. Sarong ties give the wearer a little extra hold and security. If no ties exist, a pin may be used, the fabric may be tightly tucked under itself in layers, the corners of the main sheet may be around the body and knotted, or a belt may be used to hold the sarong in place.

In the media The American public is most familiar with the sarong for the dozens of films set in the South Seas, most of them romantic dramas made in the 1930s and 1940s. Dorothy Lamour is by far the actress most linked with the garment, which was designed by Edith Head. Lamour starred in multiple films of this genre, starting with The Hurricane in 1937. In fact, Lamour was nicknamed \\"The Sarong Girl\\" by the press and even wore a sarong on occasion in more traditional films. Among the other actresses to don the sarong for film roles are Maria Montez, Gilda Gray, Myrna Loy, Gene Tierney, Frances Farmer and Movita. Male stars who wore the manly sarongs on film include Jon Hall, Ray Milland, Tyrone Power, Robert Preston, Sabu Dastagir and Ralph Fiennes in The Constant Gardener. The sarong was also worn by Pierce Brosnan in The Thomas Crown Affair (1999). The 2005 documentary film Soldiers in Sarong, directed by Lokendra Arambam, depicts the women's resistance movement in Manipur, North- East India. In Singapore, the term Sarong Party Girl refers to a local single Singaporean woman especially of Chinese ethnicity who favour socializing and having relationships with expatriate Caucasian men rather than the local ones.

Started in 1995, it is a chance for net.goths and others who normally only meet on the Internet to meet. Events at Convergence typically included live bands and club nights, bazaars, fashion, art shows, panels, and tours of goth-themed locales in the host city.  Location  Convergence is a \\"floating\\" event. The location for each year voted on by the net.goth community in response to proposals by volunteer committees. So far all have taken place in North America. Past Convergences have been held in: *Convergence 1 (June 23‚Äì24, 1995): Chicago *Convergence 2 (August 9‚Äì11, 1996): Boston *Convergence 3 (August 1‚Äì3, 1997): San Francisco *Convergence 4 (August 21‚Äì23, 1998): Toronto *Convergence 5 (April 2‚Äì4, 1999): New Orleans *Convergence 6 (May 26‚Äì29, 2000): Seattle *Convergence 7 (August 17‚Äì19, 2001): New York *Convergence 8 (May 31-June 2, 2002): Montreal *Convergence 9 (April 25‚Äì27, 2003): Las Vegas *Convergence 10 (May 7‚Äì9, 2004): Chicago, Illinois *Convergence 11 (April 22‚Äì25, 2005): San Diego *Convergence 12 (April 13‚Äì16, 2006): New Orleans, Louisiana *Convergence 13 (May 25‚Äì27, 2007): Portland *Convergence 14 (August 8‚Äì11, 2008): Ybor City (Tampa, FL) *Convergence 15 (July 17‚Äì20, 2009): Long Beach *Convergence 16 (August 13‚Äì16, 2010): Park City, Utah *Convergence 17 (June 24‚Äì26, 2011): Cozumel, Mexico *Convergence 18 (June 15‚Äì17, 2012): Buffalo, New York *Convergence 19 (April 18‚Äì22, 2013): Austin *Convergence 20 (April 25‚Äì27, 2014): Chicago *Convergence 21 (May 1‚Äì3, 2015): Hollywood *Convergence 22 (March 25‚Äì27, 2016): New Orleans *Convergence 23 (May 19-21, 2017): Dallas, Texas *Convergence 24 (April 27-29, 2018): Detroit, Michigan *Convergence 25 (May 3-5, 2019): Boston, Massachusetts  Attendance  Convergence was initially proposed and planned by two long-time members of the alt.gothic newsgroup hierarchy, at the time residents of Chicago, as an international gathering of members of the newsgroups and related net.goth groups. It was conceived as an opportunity for those who had previously known each other primarily or exclusively through Internet forums, to meet and get to know each other in person. There has been considerable debate regarding the extent to which the event should reach out to other on- line gothic communities, as well as members of local non-Internet-based gothic scenes. Some planning committees have made efforts to expand the scope of the event; while others have made similar efforts to restrict advertising to predominantly the founding net.goth communities. Attendance ranged over the years usually between 300-800, but attendance spiked at Convergence 13 to approximately 1,500.  Organization  There is no formal Convergence organization per se. Since shortly after its inception, the bidding and voting process has been managed by a more-or-less consistent group of volunteers, known informally as the C*b*l, composed of several of the longest-term participants in the alt.gothic newsgroups. The C*b*l is widely recognized as having made some of the most substantial contributions to maintaining Convergence, and are among its most frequent attendees. The group also maintains the official Convergence website, and provides organizational and informational assistance to host committees. Each Convergence is organized and run by an ad hoc volunteer committee. Committees typically consist of residents of the host city, a large percentage of whom are expected to be active participants on alt.gothic or related net.goth groups.

She was born in London to Jamaican parents, and her work explores topics related to British Jamaicans and how they negotiate racial, cultural and national identities. Early life Levy was of primarily Afro-Jamaican descent. She had a Jewish paternal grandfather and a Scots maternal great-grandfather. She said in a 2004 article: \\"Jews went to Jamaica in the 1600s. My paternal grandfather was born Orthodox Jewish, from a very strict family, but after fighting in the First World War he became a Christian and came back and married my grandmother. His family disowned him, so I don‚Äôt know much about them.\\"Salandy-Brown, Marina (November/December 2004), \\"ANDREA LEVY: 'THIS WAS NOT A SMALL STORY'\\", Caribbean Beat, Issue 70. Her father came to Britain on the in 1948, with her mother following later that year on a banana boat. Levy was born in Archway, London,\\"Tribute to Andrea Levy, 1956 - 2019\\". \\"the fourth, and baby, of the family, by a long way\\". She grew up on a council estate in Highbury, north London, and had a typical working-class upbringing. She attended Highbury Hill Grammar School and studied textile design and weaving at Middlesex Polytechnic. Career Levy began her career as a costume assistant, working part-time in the costume departments of the BBC and the Royal Opera House while starting a graphic design company with her husband Bill Mayblin. During this time, she experienced a form of awakening to her identity concerning both her gender and her race. At a racial-awareness session with colleagues at an Islington sex education project, she found herself having to choose between a \\"white\\" and \\"black\\" side, which she found a \\"rude awakening\\". Having not read a book until the age of 23, she subsequently became aware of the power of books and began to read \\"excessively\\". It was easy enough to find literature by black writers from the United States, but she could find very little literature from black writers in the United Kingdom. Levy began writing in her mid-30s after her father died. It was not a therapeutic attempt to deal with her loss, but rather a need to understand where she came from. She then enrolled in Alison Fell's Creative Writing class at the City Lit in 1989, continuing with the course for seven years. She struggled initially to get her work published, her first novel being rejected by several companies that were unsure of how to market her writing. Levy spoke in a 1999 interview of the \\"herd mentality\\" of publishers worried about the possibly limited market appeal of her work: \\"the main problem was that they perceived it as being just about race, and thought it would only appeal to black readers.\\"Hickman, Christie (6 February 2004), \\"Andrea Levy: Under the skin of history\\", The Independent. However, as Margaret Busby noted, Levy \\"proved that to write about... migration from the specific yet complex perspective of being a black English female is not a limitation to finding a wide and appreciative readership, but in fact the exact opposite.\\" Work In 1994 Levy's first novel, the semi-autobiographical Every Light in the House Burnin', was published and attracted favourable reviews. The Independent on Sunday stated: \\"This story of a young girl in the 60s in north London, child of Jamaican migrants, stands comparison with some of the best stories about growing up poor ‚Äì humorous and moving, unflinching and without sentiment\\". Her second novel, Never Far from Nowhere (1996), is a coming-of-age story about two sisters of Jamaican parentage, Vivian and Olive, growing up in Finsbury Park, London in the 1970s. It was long-listed for the Orange Prize. After Never Far from Nowhere, Levy visited Jamaica for the first time and what she learned of her family's past provided material for her next book, Fruit of the Lemon (1999). The novel is set in England and Jamaica during the Thatcher era, highlighting the differences between Jamaican natives and their British descendants. The New York Times noted the novel \\"illuminates the general situation facing all children of postcolonial immigrants\\". Levy's fourth novel, Small Island (2004), which looks at the immediate outcomes of World War II and migration on what became known as the Windrush generation, was a critical success. The Guardians Mike Phillips praised the writing and the subject matter, calling it Levy's \\"big book\\". Levy herself said in 2004: \\"When I started Small Island I didn‚Äôt intend to write about the war. I wanted to start in 1948 with two women, one white, one black, in a house in Earls Court, but when I asked myself, 'Who are these people and how did they get here?' I realised that 1948 was so very close to the war that nothing made sense without it. If every writer in Britain were to write about the war years there would still be stories to be told, and none of us would have come close to what really happened. It was such an amazing schism in the middle of a century. And Caribbean people got left out of the telling of that story, so I am attempting to put them back into it. But I am not telling it from only a Jamaican point of view. I want to tell stories from the black and white experience. It is a shared history.\\" Small Island won three awards, namely the Whitbread Book of the Year, the Orange Prize and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize. The novel was subsequently made into a two-part television drama of the same title that was broadcast by the BBC in December 2009. A stage adaptation written by Helen Edmundson premiered at the National Theatre in 2019.\\"Small Island\\", Olivier Theatre, National Theatre. Levy's fifth and final novel, The Long Song, won the 2011 Walter Scott Prize and was shortlisted for the 2010 Man Booker Prize. The Daily Telegraph called it a \\"sensational novel\\". Kate Kellaway in The Observer commented: \\"The Long Song reads with the sort of ebullient effortlessness that can only be won by hard work\\". The novel was adapted as a three-part BBC One television series that was broadcast in December 2018. Her short book Six Stories and an Essay was published in 2014. It begins with an autobiographical essay and includes stories that are drawn from various life experiences. Bonnie Greer paid tribute to Andrea Levy: \\"For every great writer, their own story is in their work, and is all that you really need to know....

After working in the big bands of Woody Herman, Lionel Hampton, and Stan Kenton, he devoted most of his career to playing music in Las Vegas. Career His first break into the professional jazz scene came in 1951 when he was hired to stand in for one of Woody Herman's regular trombonists, Urbie Green. When Green returned, Herman kept Fontana on as a permanent member of the band. After three years with Herman, Fontana joined Lionel Hampton's big band in 1954. In early 1955 he played briefly with Hal McIntyre and Chicago pianist and Playboy executive, Sam Distefano at Sam's Miami nightclub, The Stut 'n' Tut. He later joined Stan Kenton's big band. Fontana recorded three albums with Kenton and worked with trombonist Kai Winding during this period. After 1958, Fontana would tour rarely, such as a 1966 tour of Africa with Herman's band sponsored by the U.S. State Department. He primarily performed with house orchestras in Las Vegas during the 1960s, particularly Paul Anka's band (with Frank Rosolino). He also performed in bands backing Sammy Davis Jr., Tony Bennett, Wayne Newton, and the Benny Goodman orchestra. In the 1970s, he continued performing in house orchestras and lounges in Las Vegas. He also recorded with Louie Bellson, Bill Watrous, and Supersax. It was not until 1975 that Fontana recorded an album as an ensemble co-leader. He shared the billing for this record, The Hanna-Fontana Band: Live at Concord (Concord Jazz) with drummer Jake Hanna. Fontana toured in Japan with this ensemble. In 1978 he was featured on the jazz trombone recording Bobby Knight's Great American Trombone Company, with Charles Loper, Lew McCreary, Frank Rosolino, Phil Teele, and Bobby Knight. In the 1980s, he appeared regularly on National Public Radio's Monday Night Jazz program. His first album as a headliner was The Great Fontana (Uptown Jazz, 1985). In 2001 he joined The West Coast All Stars and played a concert in Stuttgart, Germany. He was joined by Conte Candoli, Teddy Edwards, Pete Jolly, Chuck Berghofer, and Joe LaBarbera. He was featured on the song \\"If I Only Had a Brain\\", from the movie The Wizard of Oz. Fontana died October 9, 2003, in Las Vegas, Nevada, at age of 75 after suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

Biography Born in Detroit, Michigan, United States, Frank Rosolino studied the guitar with his father from the age of nine. He took up the trombone at age 14 while he was enrolled at Miller High School, where he played with Milt Jackson in the school's stage band and small group. He did not graduate. He joined the 86th Division Army Band during World War II. Following his time in the Army, he returned home to Detroit. He performed in the Mirror Ballroom or the Bluebird with other musicians, such as Kenny Burrell, Paul Chambers, Tommy Flanagan, and the Jones brothers, Hank, Thad, and Elvin). He played with Charlie Parker in the 3 Deuces on 52nd Street in New York City. During these years Rosolino was also performing with the big bands of Bob Chester, Glen Gray, Tony Pastor, Herbie Fields, Gene Krupa, and Stan Kenton. After a period with Kenton he settled in Los Angeles, where he performed with Howard Rumsey's Lighthouse All-Stars (1954‚Äì1960) in Hermosa Beach.\\"Frank Rosolino: Biography\\" AllMusic. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, between nightclub engagements, Rosolino was active in many Los Angeles recording studios where he performed with such notables as Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, Tony Bennett, Peggy Lee, Mel Torm√©, Michel Legrand, and Quincy Jones. In the mid-to-late 1960s he and fellow trombonist Mike Barone, billed as \\"Trombones Unlimited,\\" recorded for Liberty Records several albums of pop- style arrangements of current hits, such as the 1968 album Grazing in the Grass. He can also be seen performing with Shelly Manne's group in the film I Want to Live! (1958) starring Susan Hayward, and also in Sweet Smell of Success (1957) with Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis. He was a regular on The Steve Allen Show and a guest artist on The Tonight Show and The Merv Griffin Show. Rosolino was a talented vocalist, renowned for his wild form of scat- singing, notably on Gene Krupa's hit record, \\"Lemon Drop\\". He recorded one vocal album, Turn Me Loose!, featuring both his singing and trombone playing. He can also be seen performing in the half-hour syndicated program Jazz Scene USA, hosted by Oscar Brown, Jr. It was during the 1970s that Rosolino performed and toured with Quincy Jones and the Grammy Award winning group Supersax. Rosolino's private life was highly troubled. On November 26, 1978, Rosolino shot both of his sons as they slept. One died instantly; the other survived, but was blinded. Rosolino shot himself in the head immediately after shooting his sons and died.

Kieyoomia was a POW in Nagasaki at the time of the atomic bombing but survived, reportedly having been shielded from the effects of the bomb by the concrete walls of his cell. The Japanese tried unsuccessfully to have him decode messages in the \\"Navajo Code\\" used by the United States Marine Corps, but although Kieyoomia understood Navajo, the messages sounded like nonsense to him because even though the code was based on the Navajo language, it was decipherable only by individuals specifically trained in its usage. Kieyoomia is notable for having not only survived the Bataan death march and related internment and torture in a concentration camp, but also being a hibakusha (survivor of an atomic bomb blast). Capture of the Philippine Islands The surrender of Bataan would hasten the fall of Corregidor, a month later. Without this final stand however, the Japanese might have quickly overrun all of the U.S. bases in the Pacific. Conflict in Bataan forced them to slow down, giving the allies valuable time to prepare for conflicts such as the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway which followed closely thereafter. Ultimately, Kieyoomia, along with more than 60,000 Filipino and 15,000 American prisoners of war were forced into the infamous Bataan Death March. Prisoner of war Prisoners on the march from Bataan to the prison camp, May 1942. (National Archives) The atomic bomb's mushroom cloud after detonating over Nagasaki. Initially tortured because his captors thought he was Japanese- American (and therefore a traitor), Kieyoomia suffered months of harsher punishment and beatings before the Japanese accepted his claim to Navajo ancestry. He survived the Death March that killed thousands of starved U.S. and Philippine soldiers. When the \\"Navajo Code\\" had the Japanese baffled, Kieyoomia was questioned and tortured although, as he was deployed to the Philippines with New Mexico's 200th Coast Artillery, he didn't even know about the existence of the code, he could only understand bits and pieces of what the Navajo Code Talkers were saying. Eventually, this led him to tell the Japanese that it sounded like nonsense to him. As punishment for his inability to crack the code and possibly because the Japanese viewed him as unwilling to crack the code, he was stripped naked and forced to stand for hours in deep snow until he talked. When he was finally allowed to return to his cell, a guard shoved him, causing the soles of his feet to tear as they were frozen to the ground. After surviving the prison camps, the \\"hell ships\\" and the torture, Kieyoomia was a prisoner in Nagasaki when that city was the target of the second atomic bomb dropped by the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF). Kieyoomia survived the attack, saying he was protected by the concrete walls of his cell. After 3¬Ω years as a prisoner of war, he was abandoned in the city for three days after the bombing, but says a Japanese officer finally freed him. Later life and Death  After the war, Kieyoomia returned to the United States and he regained the use of his wounded leg, and his feet healed. He lived to age 77, dying in 1997.

It was founded by Bruce Milne and Philip Morland from a house in Brunswick Street, Fitzroy in 1979 and is now operated by Greta Moon. The label started releasing bands on the Melbourne punk and new wave scene. Its first release was in 1979 with the EP Overnight by Two Way Garden. The labels first 25 releases were the bands' debut recordings, and included some seminal Australian acts such as The Young Charlatans, Mungabeans, Marching Girls, Clint Small, Scapa Flow, Little Murders, the Zorros and Dorian Gray. Philip Morland left and Greta Moon joined in 1982. In April 1989, the label released the debut single by the Candy Harlots, entitled Red Hot Rocket, with the initial 500 copies pressed on red vinyl and wrapped in a pair of women's lace knickers. By 1994 the label started to increase its profile due to the local and overseas success of bands like The Moodists (featuring Dave Graney and Mick Turner of Dirty Three). Releases from this later period included the Scientists' \\"Swampland\\" (which was actually the b-side of the single, with the a-side being \\"This Is My Happy Hour\\") and God's \\"My Pal\\", one of the label's most popular releases, as well as titles by Ollie Olsen's band No, Harem Scarem, various compilations such as the Asleep At The Wheel collection of (mostly unsigned) Melbourne bands, and the well-received Hard To Beat, a double album tribute to the Stooges, featuring many Australian acts. The label also branched out into international releases, issuing albums (under license) by overseas bands such as Sonic Youth, Mudhoney, Dinosaur Jr., Big Black and The 5.6.7.8's. Au Go Go was also instrumental in helping these bands tour Australia. In 1987, with the success of the mail-order service, the record shop was started. The shop shifted to a smaller space in central Melbourne in June 2000, but closed in late 2003 after losing its lease.Au Go Go is go going (Patrick Donovan, The Age, 3 October 2003) Their website was last updated Tue Feb 3 2009.http://www.augogo.com/master.html Bruce Milne started an offshoot label, Giant Claw Records, in 1989, to issue 7\\" singles. In the 1990s Milne was involved in running Melbourne pub/rock venue the Tote, in Collingwood, as well as a new label, In-Fidelity Recordings. Au-Go-Go continued throughout the 1990s, issuing early releases from such Australian acts as Spiderbait, The Meanies and Magic Dirt, the latter becoming one of the label's top attractions. Magic Dirt left Au Go Go in 1999, and the label never fully recovered. Due to a lack of funds, many of Au Go Go's releases are now out of print and are fast becoming collector's items.

The analogous solution for a charged, rotating body is given by the Kerr‚ÄìNewman metric. The metric was discovered between 1916 and 1921 by Hans Reissner, Hermann Weyl, Gunnar Nordstr√∂m and George Barker Jeffery. The metric In spherical coordinates (t, r, \\\\theta, \\\\varphi), the Reissner- Nordstr√∂m metric (aka the line element) is : ds^2 = \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{r_s}{r} + \\\\frac{r_{\\\\rm Q}^2}{r^2} \\\\right) c^2\\\\, dt^2 -\\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac{r_s}{r} + \\\\frac{r_Q^2}{r^2} \\\\right)^{-1} \\\\, dr^2 - r^2 \\\\, d\\\\theta^2 - r^2\\\\sin^2\\\\theta \\\\, d\\\\varphi^2, where c is the speed of light, t is the time coordinate (measured by a stationary clock at infinity), r is the radial coordinate, (\\\\theta, \\\\varphi) are the spherical angles, and r_s is the Schwarzschild radius of the body given by and r_Q is a characteristic length scale given by Here \\\\frac{1}{4\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0} is Coulomb force constant K.

In the limit that the charge Q (or equivalently, the length-scale r_Q) goes to zero, one recovers the Schwarzschild metric. The classical Newtonian theory of gravity may then be recovered in the limit as the ratio r_s/r goes to zero. In the limit that both r_Q/r and r_s/r go to zero, the metric becomes the Minkowski metric for special relativity. In practice, the ratio r_s/r is often extremely small. For example, the Schwarzschild radius of the Earth is roughly 9 mm (3/8 inch), whereas a satellite in a geosynchronous orbit has a radius r that is roughly four billion times larger, at 42,164 km (26,200 miles). Even at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion. The ratio only becomes large close to black holes and other ultra-dense objects such as neutron stars. Charged black holes Although charged black holes with rQ ‚â™ rs are similar to the Schwarzschild black hole, they have two horizons: the event horizon and an internal Cauchy horizon. As with the Schwarzschild metric, the event horizons for the spacetime are located where the metric component grr diverges (is not g_{rr} divergent, or equivalently g^{rr}=0?); that is, where = 1 - \\\\frac{r_{\\\\rm s}}{r} + \\\\frac{r_{\\\\rm Q}^2}{r^2}.}} This equation has two solutions: These concentric event horizons become degenerate for 2rQ = rs, which corresponds to an extremal black hole. Black holes with 2rQ > rs can not exist in nature because if the charge is greater than the mass there can be no physical event horizon (the term under the square root becomes negative).Andrew Hamilton: The Reissner Nordstr√∂m Geometry (Casa Colorado) Objects with a charge greater than their mass can exist in nature, but they can not collapse down to a black hole, and if they could, they would display a naked singularity.Carter, Brandon.

He was a leader in human genome research and Chair of the Institute for Science, Ethics and Innovation at the University of Manchester. Sulston was in favour of science in the public interest, such as free public access of scientific information and against the patenting of genes and the privatisation of genetic technologies.Ivan Oransky, Adam Marcus John Sulston. obituary 7 April 2018, The Lancet Early life and education Sulston was born in Fulmer, Buckinghamshire, England to Arthur Edward Aubrey Sulston and Josephine Muriel Frearson, n√©e Blocksidge. His father was an Anglican priest and administrator of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. His mother quit her job as an English teacher at Watford Grammar School, to care for him and his sister Madeleine. and home-tutored them until he was five. At age five he entered the local preparatory school, York House School, where he soon developed an aversion to games. He developed an early interest in science, having fun with dissecting animals and sectioning plants to observe their structure and function. Sulston won a scholarship to Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood and then to Pembroke College, Cambridge graduating in 1963 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Sciences (Chemistry). He joined the Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, after being interviewed by Alexander Todd and was awarded his PhD in 1966 for research in nucleotide chemistry. Career Between 1966 and 1969 he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. His academic advisor Colin Reese had arranged for him to work with Leslie Orgel, who would turn his scientific career onto a different pathway. Orgel introduced him to Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner, who worked in Cambridge. He became inclined to biological research. Although Orgel wanted Sulston to remain with him, Sydney Brenner persuaded Sulston to return to Cambridge to work on the neurobiology of Caenorhabditis elegans at the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB). Sulston soon produced the complete map of the worm's neurons. He continued work on its DNA and subsequently the whole genome sequencing. In 1998, the whole genome sequence was published in collaboration with the Genome Institute at Washington University in St. Louis, so that C. elegans became the first animal to have its complete genome sequenced. Sulston played a central role in both the C. elegans and human genome sequencing projects. He had argued successfully for the sequencing of C. elegans to show that large-scale genome sequencing projects were feasible. As sequencing of the worm genome proceeded, the Human Genome Project began. At this point he was made director of the newly established Sanger Centre (named after Fred Sanger), located in Cambridgeshire, England. In 2000, after the 'working draft' of the human genome sequence was completed, Sulston retired from directing the Sanger Centre. With Georgina Ferry, he narrated his research career leading to the human genome sequence in The Common Thread: A Story of Science, Politics, Ethics, and the Human Genome (2002). Awards and honours Sulston was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1986.  His certificate of election reads: He was elected an EMBO Member in 1989 and awarded the George W. Beadle Award in 2000. In 2001 Sulston gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures on The Secrets of Life. In 2002, he won the Dan David Prize and the Robert Burns Humanitarian Award. Later, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or MedicineJohn Sulston: Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2002 with Sydney Brenner and Robert Horvitz, both of whom he had collaborated with at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB), for their discoveries concerning 'genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death'. One of Sulston's most important contributions during his research years at the LMB was to elucidate the precise order in which cells in C. elegans divide. In fact, he and his team succeeded in tracing the nematode's entire embryonic cell lineage. In 2004, Sulston received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2006, he was awarded the George Dawson Prize in Genetics by Trinity College Dublin. In 2013, Sulston was awarded the Royal Society of New Zealand's Rutherford Memorial Lecture, which he gave on the subject of population pressure. He was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to science and society. On 23 October 2017 he was awarded the Cambridge Chemistry Alumni Medal. Sulston was a leading campaigner against the patenting of human genetic information. Personal life The Sulston Laboratories of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute are named in Sulston's honour. John Sulston met Daphne Bate, a research assistant in Cambridge. They got married in 1966 just before they left for US for postdoctoral research. Together they had two children. Their first child, Ingrid, was born in La Jolla in 1967, and their second, Adrian, later in England. The couple lived in Stapleford, Cambridgeshire where they were active members of the local community: John regularly volunteered in the local library and in working parties at Magog Down; he was a Trustee of Cambridge Past, Present and Future. Although brought up in a Christian family, Sulston lost his faith during his student life at Cambridge, and remained an atheist. He was a distinguished supporter of Humanists UK. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the Humanist Manifesto. Sulston was in favour of free public access of scientific information. He wanted genome information freely available, and he described as \\"totally immoral and disgusting\\" the idea of profiteering from such research. He also wanted to change patent law, and argued that restrictions on drugs such as the anti-viral drug Tamiflu by Roche are a hindrance to patients whose lives are dependent on them. In December 2010, Sulston backed Julian Assange by acting as a bail surety for him, according to Assange's attorney Mark Stephens. Sulston forfeited ¬£15,000 of the ¬£20,000 pledged in June 2012, as Assange had entered the embassy of Ecuador to escape the jurisdiction of the English courts. Sulston died on 6 March 2018 of stomach cancer, aged 75 years.

The Einstein‚ÄìRosen bridge, later named the wormhole, was a theory of Nathan Rosen. Background Nathan Rosen was born into a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York. He attended MIT during the Great Depression, where he received a bachelor's degree in electromechanical engineering and later a master's and a doctorate in physics. As a student he published several papers of note, one being \\"The Neutron,\\" which attempted to explain the structure of the atomic nucleus a year before their discovery by James Chadwick. He also developed an interest in wave functions, and later, gravitation, when he worked as a fellow at the University of Michigan and Princeton University.Saxon, Wolfgang. \\"Nathan Rosen, 86, of Israel; Physicist Worked With Einstein .\\" The New York Times 23 Dec. 1995, sec. 1: 28. State of science At the beginning of the 20th century science was progressing quickly and the inner workings of the atom were just beginning to be discovered. In 1900, Max Planck proposed the quantum theory, the idea that all energy moves in discrete amounts called quanta. In 1905, Albert Einstein published his theory of special relativity, which would be instrumental in the progression of physics and the understanding of the universe. Around 1927, Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, collaborating with many other physicists, developed the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, determining the probabilities of the movement of particles. These breakthroughs provided the model for the structure and workings of the atom and drove the revolution that would sweep up Nathan Rosen. Work with Einstein In 1932 with a ScD degree from MIT, he went to do research at Princeton University. In 1934 he became Albert Einstein's assistant at The Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey and continued in that position until 1936. In July 1935 Einstein and Rosen published an article developing a concept of folded space time in parallel layers connected by a bridge, using only General Relativity and Maxwell Equation. Earlier while working with Einstein, Rosen had pointed out the peculiarities of Einstein's studies involving entangled wave functions, and, in coordination with Boris Podolsky, a paper was drafted and published in May 1935 helping to develop a theoretical basis for the July 1935 publication. The May 1935 paper, entitled \\"Can quantum-mechanical description of physical reality be considered complete?\\" labeled these effects the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox or EPR paradox. Einstein helped Rosen to continue his career in physics with a letter to Molotov in The Soviet Union resulting in a temporary position during which in 1947 Einstein And Rosen published an article \\"On Gravitational Waves\\" in which they further developed the concept of folded space time caused by rotating cylinders. In 1952 Rosen became a professor at Technion in Haifa, Israel and remained in Haifa doing research until his death in 1995. After leaving Princeton, Rosen continued to publish on relativity with \\"General Relativity and Flat Space\\" in 1940 and \\"Energy and momentum of cylindrical gravitational waves\\" in 1958, further developing folded space time. Einstein- Rosen Bridges are purely theoretical. It was shown in a 1962 paper by theoretical physicists John A. Wheeler and Robert W. Fuller that these types of wormholes are unstable. Other researchers worked on the concept of wormholes and \\"Robert Hjellming in 1971 presented a model in which a black hole would draw matter in while being connected to a white hole in a distant location, which expels this same matter.\\" \\"In a 1988 paper, physicists Kip Thorne and Mike Morris proposed that such a wormhole could be made stable by containing some form of negative matter or energy.\\" This later work is not attributable to Rosen. Between 1940 and 1989 Rosen published a series of articles on his versions of bimetric gravity, an attempt to improve on General Relativity by removing singularities and replacing pseudo-tensors with tensors to eliminate nonlocality. The effort eventually failed in 1992 with conflicting pulsar data. Later years Later in his life, Nathan Rosen turned his attentions to teaching and the establishment of new universities. After briefly working for two years in the Soviet Union at the University of Kiev starting in 1936, he returned to the United States, where he taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1941 to 1952. In 1953, after permanently moving to Israel, he joined the Technion in Haifa, Israel. During this time Rosen was advisor to Asher Peres. Technion now has a lecture series named for him. He was President of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in the 1970s and commuted between the two institutions from his home in Haifa. Additionally, Nathan Rosen helped found the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, the Physical Society of Israel (serving as president from 1955‚Äì57), and the International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation (president 1974-77). He was very active in encouraging the founding of higher educational institutions in Israel. Contributions to physics Rosen made a number of contributions to modern physics. One of the most lasting discoveries Rosen brought to physics was his formulation of the structure of the hydrogen molecule, a molecule where none of the electrons have a definite quantum number, but the pair of electrons has a pure state. Rosen used what he called \\"entangled\\" wave functions to represent the molecule's structure. He also developed a theoretical analysis of the neutron as combination of proton and electron in an article in Physical Review 1931.

He is the founder of eBay where he served as chairman from 1998 to 2015. He became a billionaire at the age of 31 with eBay's 1998 initial public offering (IPO). Omidyar and his wife Pamela are philanthropists who founded Omidyar Network in 2004 in order to expand their efforts beyond non-profits to include for- profits and public policy. Since 2010, Omidyar has been involved in online journalism as the head of investigative reporting and public affairs news service Honolulu Civil Beat. In 2013, he announced that he would create and finance First Look Media, a journalism venture to include Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, and Jeremy Scahill.  Biography   Early life  Omidyar was born in Paris, the son of Iranian parents who migrated to France for higher education. He was given the name of Parviz. His father, Cyrus Omidyar (born ), is a surgeon who worked as a urologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and now practices in Aliso Viejo, California. Due to his father's work, the family moved to the US when Omidyar was a child. His mother, Elah√© Mir-Djalali Omidyar, who did her doctorate in linguistics at the Sorbonne, is an academic. Omidyar attended Punahou School in Honolulu for a couple of years (and currently serves on its Board of Trustees). His interest in computers began while he was a ninth-grade student at The Potomac School in McLean, Virginia. He graduated from St. Andrew's Episcopal School, Potomac, Maryland, in 1984. He graduated from Tufts University in Medford/Somerville, Massachusetts, with a bachelor's degree in computer science in 1988. He also had studied at the University of California, Berkeley during his undergraduate years. Shortly after, he went to work for Claris, an Apple Computer subsidiary, where he worked on the team that upgraded MacDraw to MacDraw II. In 1991, he co-founded Ink Development, a pen-based computing startup that later was rebranded as an e-commerce company and was renamed eShop Inc. Microsoft acquired eShop on June 11, 1996, for less than $50 million and Omidyar earned $1 million from the deal.  eBay and later career  Omidyar being shunned by Richard Branson In 1995, at the age of 28, Omidyar began to write the original computer code for an online venue to enable the listing of a direct person-to-person auction for collectible items. He created a simple prototype on his personal web page, and on Labor Day, Monday, September 4, 1995, he launched an online service called Auction Web, which would eventually become the auction site eBay. The service was originally one of several items on Omidyar's website eBay.com, which also had a section devoted to the Ebola virus, among other topics. The first item sold on the site was a broken laser pointer. Omidyar was astonished that anyone would pay for the device in its broken state, but the buyer assured him that he was deliberately collecting broken laser pointers. Similar surprises followed. The business exploded as correspondents began to register trade goods of an unimaginable variety. Omidyar incorporated the enterprise; the small fee he collected on each sale financed the expansion of the site. The revenue soon outstripped his salary at General Magic and nine months later, Omidyar decided to dedicate his full attention to his new enterprise. By 1996, when Omidyar signed a licensing deal to offer airline tickets online, the site had hosted 250,000 auctions. In the first month of 1997, it hosted two million. By the middle of that year, eBay was hosting nearly 800,000 auctions a day. In 1997, Omidyar changed the company's name from AuctionWeb to eBay, and began to advertise the service aggressively. The name \\"eBay\\" was his second choice. His first choice was already registered to a Canadian mining company, Echo Bay Mines. He originally wanted Echo Bay, the name of a recreational area near Lake Mead, Nevada, because it \\"sounded cool.\\" When he found out that echobay.com was taken, he simply dropped the \\"cho\\", and ebay.com was born. The frequently repeated story that eBay was founded to help Omidyar's fianc√©e trade Pez candy dispensers was fabricated by a public relations manager in 1997 to interest the media. This was revealed in Adam Cohen's 2002 book, and confirmed by eBay. Jeffrey Skoll joined the company in 1996. In March 1998, Meg Whitman was brought in as president and CEO, and continued to run the company until January 2008, when she announced her retirement. In September 1998, eBay launched a successful public offering, making both Omidyar and Skoll billionaires. In 2002, eBay bought PayPal, an online payment company. Later, in 2014, they spun PayPal off and currently Omidyar owns 6% of it. , Omidyar's 178 million eBay shares were worth around $4.45 billion. Omidyar is also an investor of Montage Resort and Spa in Laguna Beach, California. Additionally, Omidyar is also a member of the Berggruen Institute's 21st Century Council. In 2010, Omidyar launched an online investigative reporting news service, Honolulu Civil Beat, covering civic affairs in Hawaii. The site has been named Best News Website in Hawaii for three consecutive years. On September 4, 2013, Honolulu Civil Beat started a partnership with HuffPost, launching the weblog's latest regional addition, HuffPost Hawaii. In 2013, prompted by the Edward Snowden leaks, Omidyar announced the creation of First Look Media, a journalism venture launched on February 10, 2014, with The Intercept and including such journalists as Glenn Greenwald, Laura Poitras, Jeremy Scahill, Dan Froomkin, John Temple, and Jay Rosen. In 2020, Omidyar stepped down from the board of eBay as part of a broader overhaul of the company. He will stay as director emeritus, an honorary title. Film production Omidyar has been part of the executive producer team for the following films. *Merchants of Doubt (2014) *Spotlight (2015)  Omidyar Network  Omidyar Network is a philanthropic investment firm dedicated to harnessing the power of markets to create opportunity for people to improve their lives. It was established in 2004 by Omidyar and his wife, Pam. The organization invests in and helps scale innovative organizations to catalyze economic, social, and political change. To date, Omidyar Network has committed more than $992 million to for-profit companies and nonprofit organizations that foster economic advancement and encourage individual participation across multiple investment areas, including Property Rights, Governance & Citizen Engagement, Education, Financial Inclusion and Consumer & Internet Mobile. In 2010, he and his wife established, along with Richard Branson and the Nduna Foundation (founded by Amy Robbins), Enterprise Zimbabwe.\\"Branson Charity Focuses Aid Effort on Zimbabwe\\". STEPHANIE STROM. The New York Times, September 20, 2010. In 2018 Omidyar established the global philanthropic organisation Luminate. He separated the organization into a separate unit from his ten-year Governance & Engagement initiative.  Personal life  Omidyar and his wife, Pamela, own properties in Henderson, Nevada, and Honolulu, Hawaii. He is a follower of Buddhism. According to Forbes, his net worth was US$13.1 billion as of January 2019. Omidyar is a major donor to Democratic Party candidates and organizations. In 2019 alone, he donated approximately $500 million to charitable causes that he supports.

One side of the horizon contains closed space-like geodesics and the other side contains closed time-like geodesics. The concept is named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy. Under the averaged weak energy condition (AWEC), Cauchy horizons are inherently unstable. However, cases of AWEC violation, such as the Casimir effect caused by periodic boundary conditions, do exist, and since the region of spacetime inside the Cauchy horizon has closed timelike curves it is subject to periodic boundary conditions. If the spacetime inside the Cauchy horizon violates AWEC, then the horizon becomes stable and frequency boosting effects would be canceled out by the tendency of the spacetime to act as a divergent lens. Were this conjecture to be shown empirically true, it would provide a counter- example to the strong cosmic censorship conjecture. In 2018, it was shown that the spacetime behind the Cauchy horizon of a charged, rotating black hole exists, but is not smooth, so the strong cosmic censorship conjecture is false. The simplest example is the internal horizon of a Reissner‚ÄìNordstr√∂m black hole.

The measurement of lengths is more complicated in the theory of relativity than in classical mechanics. In classical mechanics, lengths are measured based on the assumption that the locations of all points involved are measured simultaneously. But in the theory of relativity, the notion of simultaneity is dependent on the observer. A different term, proper distance, provides an invariant measure whose value is the same for all observers. Proper distance is analogous to proper time. The difference is that the proper distance is defined between two spacelike-separated events (or along a spacelike path), while the proper time is defined between two timelike- separated events (or along a timelike path).  Proper length or rest length  The proper length or rest length of an object is the length of the object measured by an observer which is at rest relative to it, by applying standard measuring rods on the object. The measurement of the object's endpoints doesn't have to be simultaneous, since the endpoints are constantly at rest at the same positions in the object's rest frame, so it is independent of Œît. This length is thus given by: :L_{0} = \\\\Delta x. However, in relatively moving frames the object's endpoints have to be measured simultaneously, since they are constantly changing their position. The resulting length is shorter than the rest length, and is given by the formula for length contraction (with Œ≥ being the Lorentz factor): :L = \\\\frac{L_{0}}{\\\\gamma}. In comparison, the invariant proper distance between two arbitrary events happening at the endpoints of the same object is given by: :\\\\Delta\\\\sigma=\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta x^{2} - c^{2}\\\\Delta t^{2}}. So ŒîœÉ depends on Œît, whereas (as explained above) the object's rest length L0 can be measured independently of Œît. It follows that ŒîœÉ and L0, measured at the endpoints of the same object, only agree with each other when the measurement events were simultaneous in the object's rest frame so that Œît is zero. As explained by Fayngold: :p. 407: \\"Note that the proper distance between two events is generally not the same as the proper length of an object whose end points happen to be respectively coincident with these events. Consider a solid rod of constant proper length l0. If you are in the rest frame K0 of the rod, and you want to measure its length, you can do it by first marking its endpoints. And it is not necessary that you mark them simultaneously in K0. You can mark one end now (at a moment t1) and the other end later (at a moment t2) in K0, and then quietly measure the distance between the marks. We can even consider such measurement as a possible operational definition of proper length. From the viewpoint of the experimental physics, the requirement that the marks be made simultaneously is redundant for a stationary object with constant shape and size, and can in this case be dropped from such definition. Since the rod is stationary in K0, the distance between the marks is the proper length of the rod regardless of the time lapse between the two markings. On the other hand, it is not the proper distance between the marking events if the marks are not made simultaneously in K0.\\"  Proper distance between two events in flat space  In special relativity, the proper distance between two spacelike-separated events is the distance between the two events, as measured in an inertial frame of reference in which the events are simultaneous. Extract of page 191 Extract of page 136 In such a specific frame, the distance is given by \\\\Delta\\\\sigma=\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta x^2 + \\\\Delta y^2 + \\\\Delta z^2}, where * Œîx, Œîy, and Œîz are differences in the linear, orthogonal, spatial coordinates of the two events. The definition can be given equivalently with respect to any inertial frame of reference (without requiring the events to be simultaneous in that frame) by \\\\Delta\\\\sigma=\\\\sqrt{\\\\Delta x^2 + \\\\Delta y^2 + \\\\Delta z^2 - c^2 \\\\Delta t^2}, where * Œît is the difference in the temporal coordinates of the two events, and * c is the speed of light. The two formulae are equivalent because of the invariance of spacetime intervals, and since Œît = 0 exactly when the events are simultaneous in the given frame. Two events are spacelike-separated if and only if the above formula gives a real, non-zero value for ŒîœÉ.  Proper distance along a path  The above formula for the proper distance between two events assumes that the spacetime in which the two events occur is flat. Hence, the above formula cannot in general be used in general relativity, in which curved spacetimes are considered. It is, however, possible to define the proper distance along a path in any spacetime, curved or flat. In a flat spacetime, the proper distance between two events is the proper distance along a straight path between the two events. In a curved spacetime, there may be more than one straight path (geodesic) between two events, so the proper distance along a straight path between two events would not uniquely define the proper distance between the two events. Along an arbitrary spacelike path P, the proper distance is given in tensor syntax by the line integral L = c \\\\int_P \\\\sqrt{-g_{\\\\mu u} dx^\\\\mu dx^ u} , where * gŒºŒΩ is the metric tensor for the current spacetime and coordinate mapping, and * dxŒº is the coordinate separation between neighboring events along the path P. In the equation above, the metric tensor is assumed to use the \`+‚àí‚àí‚àí\` metric signature, and is assumed to be normalized to return a time instead of a distance. The ‚àí sign in the equation should be dropped with a metric tensor that instead uses the \`‚àí+++\` metric signature. Also, the c should be dropped with a metric tensor that is normalized to use a distance, or that uses geometrized units.

Life Early life  Vinter Hansen was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. Education While studying at the University of Copenhagen, she was appointed a computer at the University's observatory in 1915. In the pre- electronic era, computers were humans that worked doing hand calculations at the direction of astronomers. She was the first woman to hold an appointment at the University. She was later appointed observatory assistant and, in 1922, observer. Career  Editor of Nordic Astronomy Review  She was a very energetic worker, who, along with her normal work of observing and performing mathematical reductions of observations took on the task of editing the Nordisk Astronomisk Tidsskrift (Nordic Astronomy Review).  International Astronomical Union  She later became Director of the International Astronomical Union's telegram bureau and Editor of its Circulars.  Work as Astronomer at University of Copenhagen  By 1939, Vinter Hansen was the First Astronomer at the Observatory of the University of Copenhagen, widely known for her accurate computation of orbits of minor planets and comets.  Tagea Brandt Rejselegat Award  In that 1939 she received the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat (travel award), given to women that have made big contributions on arts or science. With the award money (DKK 10.000 or 160,000 of actual US $) undertook a tour through the United States to Japan and back. On her return trip in 1940, the outbreak of World War II restricted her homeward journey.  Work in University of California  She was awarded a Martin Kellogg Fellowship at the University of California which allowed her to work for a time in the United States. Also in 1940 she was awarded the Annie J. Cannon Award in Astronomy.  Return to Denmark  Vinter Hansen was appointed [Order of the DannebrogKnight of the Order of the Dannebrog in 1956 and continued her career at the University of Copenhagen until 1960.  Death  Julie Vinter Hansen died in 1960, from a heart-failure just days before her retirement, in her beloved vacation destination, the Swiss mountain village of M√ºrren, and was buried in Copenhagen. The minor planet 1544 Vinterhansenia, discovered by Finnish astronomer Liisi Oterma in the 1940s, was named in her honour.  Awards  * Knight of the Order of the Dannebrog (1956) * Annie J.

It was Wilson's most popular book, and many consider it his best work.\\"Widely considered Wilson's finest achievement\\" http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID;=4746 (Marina MacKay, Washington University in St. Louis, \\"Sir Angus Wilson,\\" The Literary Encyclopedia 8 Jan. 2001. Plot summary The novel deals with the significance of two connected events that happened on the same day, long before the opening of the novel. The first was the excavation of an ancient and valuable archaeological idol, a phallic figure unearthed from the tomb of an Anglo-Saxon bishop Eorpwald, known as the \\"Melpham excavation\\". Gerald has long been haunted by a drunken revelation by his friend Gilbert, who was involved with this excavation, that the whole thing was a hoax perpetrated to embarrass Gilbert's father. Gilbert told Gerald that he put the idol there. Gerald, while feeling that his friend was telling the truth, pushed the matter to the back of his mind and tried to forget about it. He now feels ashamed that he, a history professor, has never had the courage to try to resolve the matter one way or another. The second is that Gerald Middleton fell in love with Dollie, Gilbert's fianc√©e, and had an affair with her when his friend went off to fight in World War I. When Gilbert was killed at the front, Dollie refused to marry Gerald. He ended up marrying a Scandinavian woman named Inge but continued his affair with Dollie, who became an alcoholic. Gerald and Inge later separated. Anglo-Saxon Attitudes is full of side-plots and coincidences and contains a host of eccentric characters. Some of these characters are Gerald's family. Robin his eldest son, is a womaniser who cannot decide whether to leave his wife or his mistress. Kay has an unhappy marriage and a deeply embittered view of her father, whom she appears to blame for everything that has gone wrong in her life, including her withered hand (which was actually caused by her mother). Gerald's estranged wife, Inge is a grotesquely deluded woman who cannot bring herself to acknowledge her younger son John's homosexuality or her daughter's physical disability. Gerald feels responsible for Dollie's plight and for those of his children. He feels that the knowledge of his complicity over the Melpham affair has drained his morale and made him withdrawn and indecisive. The novel begins with him resolving to make good the 'bloody shameful waste' of his life, by investigating the Melpham affair and making peace with Dollie. He also attempts to develop better relationships with his grown-up children and with Inge. By the novel's end, Gerald achieves a measure of peace with his past. He persuades Dollie to come forward with a letter from Gilbert's father's colleague, Canon Portway, proving that the Melpham incident was a hoax; then he and Dollie begin a platonic friendship. He gives up on achieving good relations with his family.  Sources of inspiration  The theme of the novel was suggested to Wilson by archeological disputes, notably the Piltdown man hoax (1908‚Äì1912) and an accusation that the Elgin marbles had been mishandled by the British Museum, later substantiated.Notes by Angus Wilson The book alludes to the Sutton Hoo ship- burial discovery of 1939, in a country-house setting near Woodbridge, Suffolk. The Melpham discovery is similarly set among the 'East Folk' on the east coast of England. Eorpwald (also the name of the Melpham bishop) is in reality the unique Anglo-Saxon name of the successor of Raedwald, who was popularly thought to have been buried in the famous ship. That discovery, essentially a pagan style of burial in which Christian artefacts were included, raised many disputes among academics (as Angus Wilson knew).  Television adaptation  The novel was made into a three-part television mini-series in 1992 by the Thames Television subsidiary Euston Films. The screenplay was written by Andrew DaviesThe movie was allegedly made primarily because Davies got into an argument with ITV over the quality of their programmes and rather heatedly decided to find a good novel that had not been put on film and adapt it himself with a first-class screenplay. and featured Richard Johnson in the role of Gerald Middleton. Tara Fitzgerald played a major supporting role as the young Dollie and there were appearances by a 16-year-old Kate Winslet, and by Daniel Craig as Gilbert. The film won the BAFTA award for best serial drama; Davies and Johnson also won awards from the Writers' Guild of Great Britain and the Broadcasting Press Guild respectively. The series is available on DVD in both the UK and USA. The phrase \\"Anglo-Saxon attitudes\\" \\"Anglo- Saxon attitudes\\" is a phrase originated by Lewis Carroll in Through the Looking-Glass (1871): :\\"All this was lost on Alice, who was still looking intently along the road, shading her eyes with one hand. 'I see somebody now!' she exclaimed at last. 'But he's coming very slowly--and what curious attitudes he goes into!' :(For the Messenger kept skipping up and down, and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands spread out like fans on each side.) :'Not at all,' said the King. 'He's an Anglo-Saxon Messenger--and those are Anglo-Saxon attitudes. He only does them when he's happy.'\\" Wilson uses part of this quotation at the front of his novel. Lewis Carroll is referring to a ninth- to eleventh-century style in English drawing, in which the figures are shown in swaying positions with the palms held out in exaggerated positions.See, for instance, the Utrecht Psalter, the Easter Tables (British Library MS Caligula.A.XV) or the Psychomachia of Prudentius (British Library MS Add. 24199). (D. Talbot Rice, English Art 871-1100, Clarendon Press, Oxford 1952)).  Other works  Anglo-Saxon Attitudes has also been used as the title of several subsequent literary works. John Maddocks' review of Carleton S. Coon's The Origin of Races for the first issue of New York Review of Books in February 1963, was headed \\"Anglo-Saxon Attitudes\\". History Today titled its report of the opening of a new museum at Canterbury in Kent, on the site of St. Augustine's abbey, \\"Anglo-Saxon Attitudes\\". Anglo-Saxon Attitudes was also the name of an historical conference \\"in pursuit of the English\\" to define the evolution of the English \\"cultural self-image\\" held at the University of Salford on 9-11 July 1999.

One song on the album, \\"Good Lovin' Ain't Easy To Come By\\", was a hit single and remains popular to this day. Terrell had been ill, suffering from complications caused by a brain tumor, since the fall of 1967. Marvin Gaye later claimed that as a result, most of the female vocals on this album were performed by Valerie Simpson, who served as co-songwriter and co-producer for the LP with her boyfriend and future husband Nickolas Ashford. Simpson is quoted in Ludie Montgomery's biography of Terrell, My Sister Tommie, as not having subbed Terrell for vocals. Simpson again explicitly denied having done so in the liner notes to The Complete Motown Singles series.The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 9: 1969 (Motown/Hip-O Select, 2008 On the docuseries Unsung about Terrell, Simpson admitted she sang with Gaye during sessions saying, \\"I sang things with Marvin because Tammi was not available. And, then we would bring Tammi in to go over her parts. Those are Tammi Terrell vocals because we know that we went back in with Tammi and got what we needed.\\" Gaye at the time criticized Motown for the album thinking they were taking advantage of Terrell's health. Motown assured him proceeds from the album would go to Terrell's family for insurance of her health. At the time the album was released, Terrell was on her seventh operation to cure the brain tumor that would eventually kill her after the eighth operation. The album was released on compact disc in 1992, and again in 2001 as part of The Complete Duets. Track listing All tracks written by Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson except where noted.

From the mid-13th to early 19th centuries the 'caves' were created from the mining of flint and lime-burning chalk. History Today the caves are a tourist attraction and although they are called caves, they are entirely man-made and were dug and used as chalk and flint mines. The earliest recorded mention of the mines and lime-burning kilns above dates from a 9th-century Saxon charter and then not again until around 1232AD; they are believed to have been last worked in the 1830s. During World War I the caves were used as an ammunition storage dump associated with the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich. In the 1930s the tunnels were used for mushroom cultivation. Second World War shelter When the aerial bombardment of London began in September 1940, the caves were used as an air-raid shelter. Soon they became an underground city accommodating up to 15,000 inhabitants (who each paid a penny to enter).http://www.subbrit.org.uk/db/1449530998.html The tunnels were fitted with electric lighting, toilets and washing facilities; a chapel was built and also a hospital. The caves were located close to Chislehurst railway station and many people arrived there to then enter the shelter. Shortly after VE Day the shelter was officially closed. There has been only one child born in the caves, christened in the cave chapel with the unfortunate name of Cavena Wakeman, who endured the name until she turned 18, when she legally changed her first name to Rose and using Cavena as her middle name. Mythology In 1903, William Nichols, then Vice President of the British Archaeological Association, produced a theory that the mines were made by the Druids, Romans and Saxons. This theory was used to give names to the three parts of the caves: tour guides point out supposed Druid altars and Roman features. However this is based on Dr Nichols' writings. The earliest documented evidence for a Chalk Cave is in 1737. (However the earliest recorded mention of the mines and lime-burning kilns above, dates from a 9th-century Saxon charter and then not again until around 1232AD, this being that most likely because there was no taxation on them prior to 1232AD) An opposing article in the next issue showed the similarity of the workings to coal mines in the Newcastle area, and argued that most of the excavation had been made in the last two centuries and that the evidence for any dene-holes was slight. However a dene-hole does exist in what is known as the middle section. The caves were used between 1830 and the 1860s for producing lime. The 25-inch to a mile (approx 1:2,500) Ordnance Survey map of 1862‚Äì63 describes the place as a \\"chalk pit\\" and marks an \\"engine house\\" and two remaining kilns. A further investigation produced, among other evidence, a letter from the son of one of the workers. TV and film The caves have appeared in several television programmes including episodes of Doctor Who from 1972 titled The Mutants. In an episode of Seven Natural Wonders presented by Bill Oddie, the caves were presented as one of the wonders of the London area. The caves were also used in the films Beat Girl, The Tribe and Inseminoid and in music videos for metal bands Iron Maiden - (Can I Play With Madness) - and Cradle of Filth. They appear in Episode Five of The Tyrant King, 1968. The caves featured in two episodes of Most Haunted. A 20-year investigation into the haunting of the caves by author James Wilkinson containing the testimonies of many of the guides and owners over a 50-year period was published in 2011 entitled The Ghosts of Chislehurst Caves. Music venue In the 1960s, the caves were used as a rock music venue. David Bowie was known to have performed there four times: June 1962, 17 November 1962, 1964 & 4 March 1966.https://www.bowiewonderworld.com/tours/tour58.htm Pink Floyd played there on 8 December 1967.http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/concert- dates/1967-tour-dates-concerts.html Jimi Hendrix played there twice: 16 December 1966 & 27 January 1967.https://garagehangover.com/chislehurst-caves- chislehurst-kent/https://jimihendrix.com/encyclopedia- item/january-27-1967-live-performance-the-experience-perform-at-chislehurst- caves-in-bromley-kent-after-the-show-jimi-hendrix-meets-up-with-effects- maestro-roger-mayer-where-he-provides-jimi-some-of-his/ The Yardbirds played there on 1 July 1966.https://garagehangover.com/chislehurst-caves-chislehurst- kent/ Eric Burdon & The Animals played there on 6 October 1967.https://garagehangover.com/chislehurst-caves-chislehurst-kent/ The Herd played there on 7 February 1968.https://garagehangover.com/chislehurst-caves- chislehurst-kent/ Other bands said to have played there were the Rolling Stones, Status Quo, Pretty Things & the Troggs. Jazz (acts included Acker Bilk, Humphrey Lyttelton and Kenny Ball). On 31 October 1974, a lavish media party was held in the caves by the band Led Zeppelin to celebrate the launch of new UK record company Swan Song Records. Radio Caroline ran some gigs on a Saturday night with DJs like Dave Lee Travis, Johnnie Walker, Tony Blackburn and Simon Dee, who would bring down music acts such as Muddy Waters. One of the last concerts down in the Caves was on 9 January 1981 when four Bromley bands (11.53. Five O, Hepatitis Risk & Real Colmans) played there. The Music aspect of the caves completely stopped in 2000 with The Rock & Roll gypsies being the last band to perform in January 2001.

It arises from defects in the earliest stages of steroid hormone synthesis: the transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria and the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone‚Äîthe first step in the synthesis of all steroid hormones. Lipoid CAH causes mineralocorticoid deficiency in affected infants and children. Male infants are severely undervirilized causing their external genitalia to look feminine. The adrenals are large and filled with lipid globules derived from cholesterol. Presentation Problems that emerge in persons with lipoid CAH can be divided into: # mineralocorticoid deficiency, # glucocorticoid deficiency, # sex steroid deficiency, and # damage to gonads caused by lipid accumulation. Mineralocorticoid deficiency Most infants born with lipoid CAH have had genitalia female enough that no disease was suspected at birth. Because the adrenal zona glomerulosa is undifferentiated and inactive before delivery, it is undamaged at birth and can make aldosterone for a while, so the eventual salt-wasting crisis develops more gradually and variably than with severe 21-hydroxylase-deficient CAH. Most come to medical attention between 2 weeks and 3 months of age, when after a period of poor weight gain and vomiting, they were found to be dehydrated, with severe hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis (\\"Addisonian or adrenal crisis\\"). Renin but not aldosterone is elevated. Many infants born with this condition died before a method for diagnosis was recognized for proper treatment to begin. In some cases, the condition is more mild with signs and symptoms of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency appearing after months or even years (late onset). Glucocorticoid deficiency Insufficiency of cortisol synthesis has several consequences. Elevated ACTH is accompanied by and contributes to marked hyperpigmentation even in the newborn period. An inadequate cortisol response to stress undoubtedly hastens the deterioration as dehydration develops, can cause hypoglycemia, and contributes to the high mortality rate in infancy. Sex steroid deficiency and gonadal damage =In development= Prenatal production of DHEA by the fetal adrenal glands is impaired, resulting in abnormally low maternal estriol levels by the middle of pregnancy. The effects of impaired progesterone production from placental cells that originate from the affected baby (trophoblasts) in the case of lipoid CAH due to P450scc deficiency are still unclear, but are thought to result in miscarriage when the deficit in the enzyme's activity are severe enough. The results of reduced or absent testosterone output by fetal Leydig cells in the male is detailed below. =Female patients= Genetic XX females with lipoid CAH are born with normal external and internal pelvic anatomy. They come to medical attention when they develop a salt-wasting adrenal crisis or other signs of progressive adrenal insufficiency. With glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement, these girls will reach the age of puberty. Because the ovaries are relatively inactive in fetal life and childhood, they sustain little damage from lipid accumulation during childhood. In the case of lipoid CAH due to StAR deficiency, when rising gonadotropin levels initiate puberty, despite the inefficiency of sex steroid synthesis, the ovaries will usually make enough estradiol to produce breast development, and in some cases even menarche, with menses continuing for some years. Ovarian and adrenal androgen production is minimal and produces little pubic or other body hair. However insufficient estradiol and progesterone are produced to induce maturation of an egg and ovulation. Although prepubertal ovaries are inactive enough that no lipid accumulates to cause damage, once they have begun to produce estrogen, lipid damage begins to accrue and the ability to produce estrogen, as well as ovulate, is slowly degraded. Cysts also form in the ovaries. Women with lipoid CAH have been infertile presumably due to anovulation. =Male patients= The genitalia of XY fetuses with lipoid CAH are severely undervirilized due to impairment of steroid hormone synthesis. The fetal testes make AMH, which prevents a uterus and inner vagina from forming, but since the Leydig cells fail to make testosterone during development even in response to hCG, the testes are usually remain in the abdomen or lodge in the inguinal canals (undescended testes) and are nonfunctional. Consequently, XY patients do not undergo puberty and remain infertile. In addition to the testes remaining inside, formation of the penis, also dependent on testosterone, is compromised. Hence, the external genitalia in most of infants resemble that of normal females (though the vagina is a short, blind pouch), or is slightly ambiguous (more female than male). Nearly all reported XY cases have been assumed to be girls and raised as such. Late onset forms of the disease Milder cases of lipoid CAH have been described that arise from less severe mutations that compromise but do not eliminate the ability of StAR to instigate steroid production. In these cases, mineralocorticoid deficiency emerges up to several years after birth. Sex steroid production may be sufficient to allow for normal sexual development as well and even fertility. These nonclassic forms of the disorder are sometimes diagnosed as familial glucocorticoid deficiency type 3. Genetics This inherited disease is autosomal recessive. Understanding of the molecular basis for it has been advanced in the last decade by better understanding of adrenal steroidogenesis as well as genetic studies of affected patients. It used to be assumed that lipoid CAH resulted from a defect of the enzyme that converted cholesterol to pregnenolone. The conversion reactions are mediated by a single enzyme, formerly referred to as 20,22-desmolase, but now identified as cytochrome P450scc (cholesterol side chain cleavage enzyme). However, few cases of lipoid CAH due to a mutation and defect of P450scc have been identified. Although the disorder is considered autosomal recessive, a single mutation in P450scc can be sufficient to cause the condition. All other cases of lipoid adrenal hyperplasia that have been studied have been found to be due to mutations of the gene for the primary protein that transports cholesterol into the mitochondria, StAR, encoded by a gene on chromosome 8p11.2 in the human. Congenital adrenal hyperplasias are a family of autosomal recessive diseases resulting from defects in steps of the synthesis of steroid hormones from cholesterol. All forms of CAH involve excessive or defective production of sex steroids and can prevent or impair development of primary or secondary sex characteristics in affected infants, children, and adults. Many also involve excessive or defective production of mineralocorticoids, which can cause hypertension or salt-wasting. Lipoid CAH is one of the rarer forms of CAH and results from defects in the steps from cholesterol to pregnenolone. This results in the catastrophic loss of most or all steroid hormones in the body. It is caused by mutations in either of two proteins: cytochrome P450scc and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). Pathophysiology The deficiency results in impaired synthesis of all three categories of adrenal steroids (cortisol, mineralocorticoids, sex steroids) and high levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). A low level of steroid synthesis proceeds even without efficient transport, but is rarely enough to prevent the consequences of deficiency. While severe loss of steroid production results in manifestation of the disease within a few weeks of birth, milder forms (late onset) can present years after birth. Unlike in models of the disease in mice, patients with lipoid CAH do not always have enlarged adrenals due to lipid accumulation. This may in part be due to hormone replacement used to keep them alive preventing hyperstimulation of the gland by the pituitary. ACTH stimulates growth of the adrenal cells and increases LDL receptors to amplify transport of cholesterol into the cells of the adrenal cortex which make adrenal steroids, where it accumulates since little can enter the mitochondria for conversion to steroid. Normally, adrenal steroids then signal their presence to the brain to moderate ACTH levels (feedback inhibition). However, in the absence of this, ACTH levels are elevated and cholesterol uptake by the cortical cells continues unabated. The adrenals become markedly enlarged (hyperplastic) by the accumulated lipid. Lipid accumulation is thought to damage the cells further (‚Äúsecond hit hypothesis‚Äù). Because P450scc and StAR are also essential for sex steroid synthesis in the testis and ovary, the production of testosterone by Leydig cells in the testis and androgens (which leads to estrogen production by granulosa cells) and progesterone by ovarian theca cells and luteal cells, respectively, can also be impaired. Similar to the adrenal gland, cholesterol accumulation damages the Leydig cells of the testes. In the ovary, the damage begins after puberty, the time when the ovary starts making steroid with follicle development. The placenta also makes steroid to help maintain pregnancy. However, since StAR is not required for placental steroid production, pregnancy goes to term. When the mutation in P450scc that causes lipoid CAH is either heterozygous or its presence on both alleles does not completely destroy all function, affected babies can survive to birth as well. Also of note, enlargement of the adrenal gland is not always found in the patient, especially in cases where a mutation in the gene for P450scc is the cause. The pathophysiology of lipoid CAH differs from other forms of CAH in certain aspects. First, the affected gene in most cases is that for a transport protein (StAR) rather than a steroidogenic enzyme. Second, because the defect compromises all steroid synthesis. Thus, there are no problems due to excessive mineralocorticoids or androgens. Third, lipid accumulation damages the testes and ovaries so that even with appropriate adrenal hormone replacement (and in the absence of other intervention), gonadal function and fertility cannot be preserved. Diagnosis In terms of diagnosis of this condition, gene sequencing can be done. Management Management of salt-wasting crises and mineralocorticoid treatment are as for other forms of salt-wasting congenital adrenal hyperplasias: saline and fludrocortisone.Glucocorticoids can be provided at minimal replacement doses because there is no need for suppression of excessive adrenal androgens or mineralocorticoids. As with other forms of adrenal insufficiency, extra glucocorticoid is needed for stress coverage. Female patients XX females with lipoid CAH may need estrogen replacement at or after puberty. Active intervention has been used to preserve the possibility of fertility and conception in lipoid CAH females. In a case report in 2009, a woman with late onset lipoid CAH due to StAR deficiency underwent hormone replacement therapy in combination with an assisted fertility technique, intracytoplasmic sperm injection. This led to ovulation and with implantation of the in vitro fertilized egg, a successful birth. Male patients Most XY children are so undervirilized that they are raised as girls. The testes are uniformly nonfunctional and undescended; they are removed when the diagnosis is made due to the risk of cancer development in these tissues. Epidemiology Lipoid CAH is quite rare in European and North American populations. Most cases occur in Japan and Korea (where the incidence is 1 in 300,000 births) and Palestinian Arabs. Despite autosomal inheritance, there has been an unexplained preponderance of genetic females in reported cases.

It was signed by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (1846-1921), an opponent of slavery, who acted as regent to Emperor Pedro II, who was in Europe. The Lei √Åurea was preceded by the Rio Branco Law of September 28, 1871 (\\"the Law of Free Birth\\"), which freed all children born to slave parents, and by the Saraiva-Cotegipe Law (also known as \\"the Law of Sexagenarians\\"), of September 28, 1885, that freed slaves when they reached the age of 60. The text of the Lei √Åurea was brief: The succinctness of the law was intended to make clear that there were no conditions of any kind to the freeing of all slaves. However, it did not provide any support to either freed slaves or their former owners to adjust their lives to their new status: slave owners did not receive any state indemnification, and slaves did not receive any kind of compensation from owners or assistance from the state. Before the abolition of slavery, slaves were prohibited from owning assets or receiving an education; but after being freed, former slaves were left to make their own way in the world. Without education or political representation, former slaves struggled to gain economic and social status in Brazilian society. The Lei √Åurea was authored by Rodrigo A. da Silva, then Minister of Agriculture (in the Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Jo√£o Alfredo Correia de Oliveira) and member of the Chamber of Deputies, and, after passing both houses of the National Assembly (Assembl√©ia Geral), it was sanctioned by Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (1846-1921), who was Regent at the time, while her father, Emperor Dom Pedro II, was in Europe. The Golden Law was signed by the Princess Imperial and countersigned by Rodrigo A. da Silva, in his capacity as Minister of Agriculture. Princess Isabel (who was a staunch supporter of the abolitionist movement) was awarded the \\"Golden Rose\\" by Pope Leo XIII and Minister Rodrigo A. da Silva received honors from the Vatican, France and Portugal. In August 1888 Rodrigo A. da Silva went on to be chosen for a lifetime seat in the Senate of the Empire. Aside from the activities of abolitionists, there were a number of reasons for the signing of the law: slavery was no longer profitable, as the wages of European immigrants, whose working conditions were poor, cost less than the upkeep of slaves, and the decline in the arrival of new slaves - Brazil was the last country in the Western world to abolish slavery. The Lei √Åurea had other consequences besides the freeing of all slaves; without slaves and lacking workers, the plantation owners (fazendeiros) had to recruit workers elsewhere and thus organized, in the 1890s, the Sociedade Promotora de Imigra√ß√£o (\\"Society for the Promotion of Immigration)\\". Another effect was an uproar among Brazilian slave owners and upper classes, resulting in the toppling of the monarchy and the establishment of a republic in 1889 - the Lei √Åurea is often regarded as the most immediate (but not the only) cause of the fall of monarchy in Brazil.

Eldest was first published in hardcover on August 23, 2005, and was released in paperback in September 2006. Eldest has been released in an audiobook format, and as an ebook. Like Eragon, Eldest became a New York Times bestseller. A deluxe edition of Eldest was released on September 26, 2006, including new information and art by both the illustrator and the author. Other editions of Eldest are translated into different languages. Eldest begins following several important events in Eragon. The story is the continued adventures of Eragon and his dragon Saphira, centering on their journey to the realm of the Elves in order to further Eragon's training as a Dragon Rider. Other plots in the story focus on Roran, Eragon's cousin, who leads the inhabitants of Carvahall to Surda to join the Varden, and Nasuada as she takes on her father's role as leader of the Varden. Eldest ends at the Battle of the Burning Plains, where Eragon faces a new Dragon Rider, Murtagh, and a new dragon, Thorn. Reviews pointed out the similarities between Eldest and other works such as The Lord of the Rings, while praising the themes of the book, such as friendship and honor. Several of these reviews commented on the style and genre of Eldest, while others considered the possibility of a film adaptation similar to the first film.  Plot synopsis   Setting  Eldest begins three days after the events of the preceding novel, Eragon, in the dwarf city of Tronjheim, inside of a hollowed mountain named Farthen D√ªr. Farthen D√ªr is in the southeastern part of Alaga√´sia, the fictional continent where the Inheritance Cycle takes place. Throughout the novel, the protagonists travel to many different places: Ellesm√©ra, the elven capital city in the forest Du Weldenvarden, on the northern portion of Alaga√´sia; Carvahall, a small town located on the northwestern part of Alaga√´sia in Palancar Valley; and Aberon, the capital of Surda, in the southern portion of Alaga√´sia.  Characters  The story is told in third- person through protagonists Eragon, Roran, and Nasuada. Eragon is nearly always accompanied by his dragon Saphira. Due to the multiple points-of-view, multiple stories take place concurrently, and the protagonist characters do not meet often. Several other characters return from Eragon, including Arya (the elf warrior, daughter of the elven queen), Orik, Roran (Eragon's cousin and a major character), Ajihad (the leader of the Varden, who dies and is replaced by his daughter Nasuada), and Angela (the herbalist). Some new characters are introduced in Eldest, such as Oromis and his dragon Glaedr. Murtagh appears briefly as a minor protagonist but then reappears later as a primary antagonist with his dragon, Thorn.  Plot summary  Eldest begins as Ajihad, the king of the rebel Varden force, is ambushed and killed, while The Twins and Murtagh are assumed dead. Ajihad's daughter Nasuada is elected to command the Varden, and decides to move them to Surda and oppose the Empire openly. Eragon and Saphira decide to travel to the forest Du Weldenvarden to be trained as a Dragon Rider by the elves. The dwarf king, Hrothgar, decides to adopt Eragon to his clan, D√ªrgrimst Ingeitum, and have his now foster brother, Orik, accompany him to the forest. Once there, Eragon meets the stranger who had contacted him, revealed to be a Rider, Oromis, with his Dragon Glaedr, the only Dragon and Rider secretly alive. However, both are crippled, and so cannot fight Galbatorix directly, choosing to instead pass on their knowledge. Eragon and Saphira are taught the use of logic, magic theory, scholarship, and combat, among other things. However, having received a massive scar on his back in the previous book, Eragon is beset by agonizing seizures, which debilitate him. He also struggles with his romantic feelings for Arya, while Saphira has similar struggles toward Glaedr. Arya becomes aware of his feelings, and distances herself from him, not to interfere in his education, while Saphira is eventually violently rejected by Glaedr. Eventually, in an ancient elven ceremony, the Agaet√≠ Bl√∂dhren, Eragon is affected by powerful magic, turning him into an elf-human hybrid, and healing his back injury. He makes another romantic attempt on Arya, but she harshly rejects him, and leaves to rejoin the Varden. Regardless, he continues his studies more successfully, due to his enhanced abilities. Meanwhile, unknowing of all of this, Eragon's cousin Roran plans to marry Katrina, daughter of Sloan, the village butcher. While the village is at peace, they are unexpectedly attacked by Galbatorix's soldiers and the Ra'zac, the strangers who had killed Roran's father, Garrow. The village metalsmith, Horst, equips Roran with a hammer, and he fights the soldiers. The Ra'zac and most of the soldiers escape, saying that they want information from Roran. The entire village then sets up defenses, and during a second invasion, the Ra'zac escape again. One night, Roran wakes up to find Katrina being attacked by the Ra'zac, who sneaked into the house. Roran then discovers they are monsters, not humans, and one of them bites him, leaving a serious injury, and capture Katrina. Sloan, revealed to be in league with the Ra'zac, is then flown away by the Ra'zac, along with Katrina. Torn between chasing after Katrina and staying behind to defend his home, Roran rallies almost the entirety of the village to travel to Surda and join the Varden. On the way, they journey to Teirm, where Roran meets Jeod, Brom's friend, who informs him about Eragon, and decides to go with them. With Jeod's help, they steal a ship, and journey toward Surda by sea. Meanwhile, Nasuada struggles under the burdens of leadership over the Varden. She hatches a plan to fund them by selling magically-crafted lace, to alleviate their financial troubles. She also meets Elva, a child supposedly blessed by Eragon in the previous book. Eragon is revealed to have botched the blessing with poor phrasing, accidentally forcing Elva to feel the pain of others. Elva uses her abilities to save Nasuada from an assassination attempt. Nasuada eventually learns that Galbatorix is fielding a massive army against them, and sends for help from the dwarves and Eragon. Eragon eventually has a prophetic dream of the coming battle, and decides to interrupt his training to aid the Varden in battle. Oromis consents and provides him with numerous gifts to help him, but insists he return to finish his training after the battle. He journeys with Sapphira and Orik to the Varden's camp, reuniting with Nasuada and Arya, and meeting Elva, promising to rid her of his failed blessing. The Varden are then joined by an army of urgals, who seek an alliance with them after being freed of Durza's control. As the battle begins, it goes poorly for the Varden, as they are massively outnumbered. Roran and the dwarves arrive mid-battle, and begin to turn the tide in favor of the Varden, but an unknown Dragon Rider unexpectedly arrives and kills Hrothgar. Eragon engages this Rider, who proves an even match, and unmasks him, revealing him to be Murtagh. Murtagh reveals he was kidnapped by the Twins, who had betrayed the Varden. After the dragon, named Thorn, had hatched for him, they were both forced into loyalty by Galbatorix. Meanwhile, the battle proceeds, with the Twins revealing themselves and causing massive losses among the Varden, until Roran kills them. Murtagh and Eragon resume their fight, with Murtagh easily defeating Eragon through magic. He shows mercy to him, on account of their old friendship, but takes Eragon's sword Zar'roc, which he claims to be his inheritance, revealing that he and Eragon are brothers. He leaves, leaving Eragon in dismay as to his parentage. Ultimately, the Varden win the battle. The book ends as Roran asks Eragon for help in rescuing Katrina, to which he agrees.  Critical reaction  Eldest received generally negative reviews, and it was met with criticism similar to Eragon for its derivative nature. School Library Journal noted that Eldest lacked originality, but would still find reception among fans. It also acknowledged that themes of Eldest are based generally on the works of other writers. BookBrowse also criticized Eldest, but said, as School Library Journal noted, that nothing the reviewers can say will stop some children from reading the book. Entertainment Weekly rated Eldest as one of the worst five books of 2005, calling it a \\"700-page drag.\\" The Boston Globe gave a negative review for Eldest, criticizing the very low points and for \\"drama that rises to a wet pop.\\" The Christian Science Monitor gave Eldest a C+ grade. Similar to other reviews, it criticized the long plot and its similarities to The Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, as well as the lack of humor. The review commented that Roran, one of the secondary major characters, had the best part of the book. SFSignal also gave Eldest a poor review, giving it one out of five stars. The main reason of this was for its dull pace. The SFSignal review, like The Christian Science Monitor, did say that Roran had the \\"strongest sequence\\" in the book. However, there were also some more positive reviews of Eldest. Bookmarks magazine saw Eldest's similarity to other works, but said that Eldest displayed more emotional depth than Eragon. Publishers Weekly also gave a positive review for Eldest, praising the revelations in the final pages. Barnes & Noble gave a positive review for Eldest, in particular for its style, characters and themes such as friendship, forgiveness, responsibility, and honor. Eldest won the 2006 Quill Award in Young Adult Literature. Eldest also was nominated for a British Book Award in the Children's Book of the Year section, the Disney Adventures Book Award, the Colorado Blue Spruce Award, Young Adult Book Award, and the Wyoming Soaring Eagle Book Award. Goodreads gave the book a score of 3.97 out of 5.  Themes  Several themes in Eldest have been noted. A Barnes & Noble reviewer praised the honor, friendship, responsibility, and forgiveness in the book. The reviewer called these themes \\"age-transcendent\\". School Library Journal commented on how Eragon looked for a definition for good and evil. A third review, while not identifying any specific themes, said the author was \\"layering his themes\\" to make the book more exciting. Another review praised the story for the themes of power, family, and maturing. Paolini commented on the theme in Eldest of vegetarianism: > \\"One of my goals as an author is to explore various aspects of human nature. > It's my job, then, to attempt to understand why people act, even if it > differs from my own point of view or practice, and to present those reasons > to the best of my ability. The actions and beliefs of my characters are not > necessarily my own.\\" There are also themes of religion and atheism, the dwarves being highly religious, the elves being atheists, and Eragon, growing up without a religious background but a set of superstitions, wondering if there are higher powers.  Literary style and genre  Eldest falls in the genre of juvenile fiction and fantasy. Reviews often commented on how Eldest borrowed from the fantasy genre. Other reviews criticized and praised the writing style of the author. Los Angeles Times, while noting that the writing was more mature, criticized the novel for being inconsistent. An Entertainment Weekly review was negative toward the story because it was slow-paced, while The Washington Post said Eldest needed to be shortened. A reviewer from The Boston Globe said: > \\"He is to English as a bad dog to a chainsaw: he worries it, and worries it, > and devastation spreads around him.\\" On the other hand, Barnes & Noble called the writing style fluid and Children's Literature praised the story for being richly detailed. Kirkus Reviews compared the story to a patchwork of fantasy elements and characters, then concluded that it, despite being derivative, was exciting and held together well.  Film adaptation  Whether or not the book will be adapted to film remains a matter of speculation. When asked whether there would be a movie adaptation of Eldest at the premiere of Eragon, Christopher Paolini replied, \\"I think we'll know after opening weekend.\\" Many critics have considered the possibility of a sequel in their reviews of Eragon. One critic said that 20th Century Fox's plans to adapt Eldest was \\"jumping the gun\\" and that \\"they will have a tough time convincing anyone but the most die-hard fans to return for another helping.\\" Even some critics who gave the film positive reviews were skeptical towards the possibility of a sequel: \\"That the studio hopes to build a franchise on this, now that‚Äîthat is expecting way too much.\\" According to an interview with director Stefen Fangmeier: Fangmeier's comments were made in March 2007, before the October 2007 announcement that the trilogy was to be expanded into a four-book cycle. As of now, there are no plans for Eldest being made into a movie.  Limited edition  A deluxe version of Eldest called the \\"Limited Edition\\" was released on September 26, 2006. It was published by Random House. The deluxe edition included an excerpt of Brisingr, a poster of Glaedr (which would become the cover art for Brisingr), the history of Alaga√´sia, art by Christopher Paolini, and a list of characters, places, objects, and dwarf clans. The deluxe edition was also released in an Ebook format. Eldest has been published in forty-one countries, several translations from English into different languages have been made. Translations for languages such as Spanish, Portuguese, and Serbian have appeared. Worldwide Eldest has several publishers including Gailivro, which publishes the Polish and Portuguese Eldest, and Gramedia Pustaka Utama, the publisher of the Indonesian translations. An omnibus of Eragon and Eldest was published on July 8, 2008 and included never-before-seen manuscripts by Christopher Paolini.

Historically in Cheshire, it had a population of 17,436 at the 2011 Census.Bramhall South and Bramhall North Wards History The Anglo- Saxon manor of Bramall was held as separate estates by two Saxon freemen, Brun and Hacun., Retrieved 26 January 2015 In 1070, William the Conqueror subdued the north-west of England, and divided the land among his followers. The manor was given to Hamon de Massey, who eventually became the first Baron of Dunham Massey. The earliest reference to Bramall was recorded in the Domesday Book as \\"Bramale\\", a name derived from the Old English words brom meaning broom, both indigenous to the area, and halh meaning nook or secret place, probably by water. De Masci received the manor as wasteland, since it had been devastated by William the Conqueror. By the time of the Domesday survey, the land was recovering and cultivated again.Dean, p14 In 1875, Bramhall was one of eight civil parishes of Cheshire to be included in the Stockport Rural rural sanitary district. The sanitary district became the Stockport Rural District in 1894. The parish was abolished in 1900 and its former area became part of the Hazel Grove and Bramhall civil parish and urban district. In 1974, the district was abolished, under the Local Government Act 1972, and transferred to Greater Manchester to be combined with that of other districts to form the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport.http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/ewm/maps/districtstext.html Governance Bramhall is part of the parliamentary constituency of Cheadle, represented by Conservative Mary Robinson since 2015. Landmarks Bramhall War Memorial Bramall Hall, situated in of parkland, is an example of a 14th- century Cheshire building.

Roy was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec and the House of Commons of Canada, and advocated social credit theories of monetary reform. Background Roy was born in Saint-Prosper, Quebec. He studied accounting, sales management, and human resources in the Saint-Georges seminary, and commercial law, political economy and business administration at Universit√© Laval. In 1980, following his departure from politics, he studied property valuation. He was an accountant for the Saint-Prosper agricultural co- operative from 1945 to 1949, and secretary of the Federation of Co-operative Trucking (Quebec South district) from 1949‚Äì1952, and for the Sherbrooke district from 1952-1953. He founded the F. Roy Transports trucking company, which he ran from 1953-1962. He was Director-General of a credit union in La Chaudi√®re from 1962 to 1970, and member of the administrative and executive councils of a Quebec credit union federation (F√©d√©ration des caisses d'√©tablissement du Qu√©bec) from 1968 to 1970. In 1970, he was director of recruitment and sales for the federation. In 1960, he co-founded the Saint- Prosper Chamber of Commerce, and became president in 1963. Social Credit activist From 1962 to 1968, he was president of the Dorchester riding federal Ralliement cr√©ditiste association, and regional organizer for the party in the 1962, 1963, 1965 and 1968 federal elections. From 1964 to 1965, he was provincial vice-president of the party. Member of the legislature He was elected to the Quebec National Assembly for Beauce riding in 1970, and held the post of chief whip of the Ralliement cr√©ditiste du Qu√©bec caucus from 1970 to 1972. He was parliamentary leader of the party from 1972 to 1975, and lost a bid to become leader at a February 1973 leadership convention. In the 1973 provincial election, he was returned to the National Assembly for the riding of Beauce-Sud. He was president of the party from 1973‚Äì1974, but was expelled on November 3, 1975. He founded the Parti national populaire with former Liberal cabinet minister J√©r√¥me Choquette on December 14, 1975, and was re-elected in the 1976 provincial election as the only PNP Member of the National Assembly. Federal politics He was appointed leader of the federal Social Credit Party of Canada on March 30, 1979, and resigned his National Assembly seat on April 5, 1979. Under Roy, the party won the tacit support of the sovereigntist Parti Qu√©b√©cois, which formed the government of Quebec. Social Credit attempted to rally the separatist and nationalist vote: Canadian flags were absent at its campaign kick-off rally, and the party's slogan was C'est √† notre tour (\\"It's our turn\\"), which was reminiscent of the popular separatist anthem Gens du pays that includes the chorus, \\"C'est √† votre tour de vous laisser parler d'amour\\" (It's your turn to talk about love). The party focused its platform on constitutional change, promising to fight to abolish the federal government's rarely used right to disallow any provincial legislation, and stating that each province has a \\"right to choose its own destiny within Canada\\". Despite these attempts to win nationalist and separatist votes, the party was reduced to six seats in the 1979 federal election. Roy himself was elected from Beauce in eastern Quebec. While his party provided some support to the minority Progressive Conservative Party of Canada government, Prime Minister Joe Clark was unwilling to reciprocate. He refused to recognize the Socreds as an official party (they had half the seats required for official status in the Commons) or form a coalition with them. When the PC government presented its December budget which included a controversial gas tax opposed by the Liberals and NDP, the Socreds demanded that the gas tax revenues be allocated to Quebec which Clark turned down. In reaction, when the NDP attached a rider to the budget bill declaring that \\"this House has lost confidence in the government,\\" the Socred caucus abstained on the vote to adopt the amendment, which led to the defeat of the Clark government and an election on February 18, 1980. The abstention by Social Credit on this important vote contributed to the growing perception that the party had become irrelevant following the death of iconic leader R√©al Caouette four years earlier Roy and all other Socred candidates were defeated in the 1980 federal election. The death of the Social Credit candidate in the riding of Frontenac, Quebec resulted in the postponement of the election in that riding to March 24. Roy sought to return to the House of Commons in the by-election, but lost to the Liberal candidate. Social Credit would never come within sight of winning a seat in the Commons again. Roy resigned from the leadership on November 1, 1980. Retirement Roy returned to business and community involvement, serving as director of Geoffrion Leclerc from 1981‚Äì1988, director of a community college (C√©gep de L√©vis-Lauzon) from 1984‚Äì1985, member of the Beauce economic council from 1981, as well as participating in Rotary Club activities and local celebrations. In 1987 he was one of the co-chairs of the 250 th anniversary of the Beauce. He continues to campaign in many socio-economic organizations. He sat on the consultation committee of the Marius-Barbeau Museum. In 1989, Fabien Roy became the founding president of the Village des d√©fricheurs of Saint-Prospe He published his autobiography (D√©put√© √† Qu√©bec et √† Ottawa‚Äîmais toujours Beauceron !, ) in 2005. Personal life  On 27 August 1960, he married Pauline Lessard Eudore in the parish Assumption, Saint-Georges-de-Beauce.

It lies to the west of Kexbrough, and is located at approximately , at an elevation of around 200 metres above sea level. At the 2001 census it had a population of 142, reducing to 128 at the 2011 Census. There are many Hoylands in Barnsley - there is the village of Hoyland itself south east of Barnsley on the road to Sheffield, which includes the former hamlets of Hoyland Common, Upper Hoyland and Hoyland Nether (nether being old English for \\"lower\\"). Hoylandswaine is located on the opposite side of the wide valley, and at almost 1000 feet above sea level has a wilder and bleaker feel than High Hoyland. The word Hoyland is derived from Norse, and at its simplest means \\"farm on a hill\\". Despite there being countless farms on hills around England, the majority of the Hoylands are concentrated in Barnsley. History There is some evidence to suggest that High Hoyland has quite an ancient history, though no archaeological survey has yet taken place. Some people believe the village may have been the site of an Iron Age hill fort, and its strategic hilltop location would surely have been a good place for one. Nearby Kexbrough (originally Cezeburgh) also lends weight to the theory, since the \\"burghs\\" were originally strongholds. The village was nevertheless in existence in 1086 when the Domesday survey was compiled. The village was listed as Heyholand, being one of only 16 settlements in present-day South Yorkshire to be recorded. Today a bridleway runs along the ridge above the village; originally this was a trans-Pennine salt track, and was also mentioned in the Domesday survey. Present day The village is now part of Barnsley's metropolitan area, yet retains a very rural feel and has become part of the commuter belt west of Barnsley, which also includes Silkstone and Cawthorne. The Cherry Tree Public House is one of the most famous in South Yorkshire, and has won awards for both its ale and its views - with spectacular open vistas across the valley. From here it is possible to see Cannon Hall, the Peak District National Park, Barnsley Town Hall and on clear days the cooling towers of the distant power stations of Drax and Eggborough.

His research has focused on experiments that trap and cool atoms to temperatures close to absolute zero, and he led one of the first groups to realize Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation in these systems in 1995. For this achievement, as well as early fundamental studies of condensates, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001, together with Eric Allin Cornell and Carl Wieman. Biography Ketterle was born in Heidelberg, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, and attended school in Eppelheim and Heidelberg. In 1976 he entered the University of Heidelberg, before transferring to the Technical University of Munich two years later, where he gained the equivalent of his master's diploma in 1982. In 1986 he earned a PhD in experimental molecular spectroscopy under the supervision of Herbert Walther and Hartmut Figger at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching, before conducting postdoctoral research at Garching and the University of Heidelberg. In 1990 he joined the group of David E. Pritchard in the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT (RLE). He was appointed to the MIT physics faculty in 1993 and, since 1998, he has been John D. MacArthur Professor of Physics. In 2006, he was appointed Associate Director of RLE and began serving as director of MIT's Center for Ultracold Atoms. After achieving Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensation in dilute gases in 1995, his group was in 1997 able to demonstrate interference between two colliding condensates, as well as the first realization of an \\"atom laser\\", the atomic analogue of an optical laser. In addition to ongoing investigations of Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensates in ultracold atoms, his more recent achievements have included the creation of a molecular Bose condensate in 2003, as well as a 2005 experiment providing evidence for \\"high-temperature\\" superfluidity in a fermionic condensate. Ketterle is also a runner, and was featured in the December 2009 issue of Runner's World's \\"I'm a Runner\\". Ketterle spoke of taking his running shoes to Stockholm when he received the Nobel Prize and happily running in the early dusk. Ketterle completed the 2013 Boston Marathon with a time of 2:49:16, and in 2014, in Boston, ran a personal record of 2:44:06. Ketterle serves on the Board of Trustees of the Center for Excellence in Education (CEE), and participates in the Distinguished Lecture Series of CEE's flagship program for high-school students, the Research Science Institute (RSI), which Ketterle's own son Jonas attended in 2003. Ketterle sits on the International Scientific Advisory Committee of Australia's ARC Centre of Excellence in Future Low-Energy Electronics Technologies. Ketterle is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May of 2008, urging him to \\"reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill\\" by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy‚Äôs Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Personal life Since 2011, Ketterle has been married to Mich√®le Plott. He has five children, three with Gabriele Ketterle, to whom he was married from 1985 to 2001.

The well-visited seaside resort island is located along the Atlantic Coast just east of St. Simons Island. It lies about north of Jacksonville, Florida and about south of Savannah, Georgia, and is reachable via a causeway from St. Simons Island. The Anschutz family of Denver, Colorado owns two resorts with limited public access and maintains a gated community for around 500 single- family residences. The resorts, Sea Island Beach Club and The Cloister, are located a short distance from one another, connected by a roundabout in the middle of Sea Island Drive, the island's main connecting road. The oceanfront Beach Club contains restaurants, a game room, a bowling alley, an ice cream shop, a bar, and three pools. Sea Island's main hotel, The Cloister, is located on its southwestern side along the Black Banks River. It includes restaurants, 200 rooms, a spa, tennis and squash courts, an exercise facility, and is home to the only Forbes Five Star restaurant in the state of Georgia, The Georgian Room. It is the only resort in the world to have received four Forbes Five-Star awards for ten consecutive years. Georgia's Sea Island is part of a long chain of barrier islands, also known as \\"sea islands\\", located along the coasts of South Carolina, Georgia and northern Florida between the Santee and St. Johns rivers. History Like many of the easternmost barrier islands of Georgia, Sea Island was formed about 5,000 years ago, after the last major ice age. Unlike the much older, Pleistocene-age islands just to its west, there is little information about early human activity on the island. Most of its recorded history dates from the beginning of the 20th century. Its original English name was Fifth Creek Island. Its first known white settler was Captain James Mackay, who served under General Oglethorpe at Fort Frederica. Subsequent holders included a series of St. Simons Island plantation owners, who used the land primarily for grazing. In 1926, automobile magnate Howard Coffin added it to his other land purchases in coastal Georgia. Two years later, on the advice of friends who foresaw the potential in oceanfront properties, he opened the Cloister Hotel that was nicknamed the \\"Little Friendly Hotel\\" and turned over its management to his cousin, Alfred W. Jones. Upon Howard Coffin‚Äôs death in 1937, A. W. Jones inherited the property, along with other tracts of nearby coastal land owned by the Sea Island Company.173x173pxFrom its beginnings, the Cloister was a success, attracting a variety of \\"Roaring Twenties\\" luminaries. When President Calvin Coolidge decided to spend his Christmas holidays on Sea Island in 1928, the new hotel gained national attention. Promoted as a quiet, worry-free escape, as opposed to some of the high-energy resorts in Florida, the Cloister appealed to businessmen, politicians, and celebrities, including New York Mayor Jimmy Walker, Edsel Ford, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Eddie Rickenbacker, and many others. In addition to the hotel, Mr. Coffin also dreamed of creating a residential community on the island and encouraged his guests to consider building \\"cottages\\" nearby. To that end, he brought in electricity, water and telephone service, and improved causeway access to both St. Simons and Sea Islands. Among those building homes was Eugene O‚ÄôNeill, who wrote the play Ah, Wilderness! while there. Although growth slowed during the Great Depression, the still modest resort was able to make it through the financial crisis and World War II. In the postwar years, the Cloister and its surrounding community grew slowly, with the hotel welcoming a steady stream of distinguished guests, including U.S. presidents Hoover, Eisenhower, Ford and Carter. In 1949, Sarah Churchill married photographer Anthony Beauchamp on the island. Among the thousands of honeymooners to visit were George and Barbara Bush. The island‚Äôs residential community also grew in numbers and in stature, with some lot prices pushing into the millions of dollars by the end of the 20th century. 21st century In 2001, The Lodge was built on St. Simons Island with the help of Bill Jones. The Lodge became a hub for golfers and yet another accommodation under the Sea Island umbrella. By 2003, A. W. \\"Bill\\" Jones III decided it was time for a complete restoration of the Cloister building, which lacked a proper foundation, and did not meet modern building codes. Over a three-year period, the hotel was demolished and replaced with a new, luxurious structure that retained the look and feel of the original. Upgrades were also made to the resort's beach club and spa. Just two years after its grand re- opening, the financial panic of 2008 and the subsequent Great Recession hit the Sea Island Company from several directions. Expected property sales in a new, upscale development did not occur. Resort visitation declined. New home purchases in the surrounding community stalled. Revenue from the Cloister dropped by 31% from 2007 to 2009. As a result, and despite winning 5-star travel guide awards the company defaulted on its loans which were later found to have been ill-advised from the start and about 25% of its workforce was laid off. Although two major creditors, Synovus and Bank of America agreed to a restructured loan package in 2009, Sea Island Company was unable to sell off enough of its land holdings, and again defaulted in 2010. Later that year, the company filed Chapter 11 Bankruptcy, and was acquired by a consortium of investors who formed Sea Island Acquisitions, LLC, to manage the property and turn its business around. http://www.ledger- enquirer.com/news/business/article29324686.html In April 2016, Sea Island Acquisitions completed a $40 million expansion that added a new \\"Garden Wing\\" to the Cloister with 63 rooms. In June 2016, the Anschutz family of Denver, Colorado, headed by Philip Anschutz, bought out the other three investors to become the sole owner of Sea Island Company.  Commemorative live oaks  While visiting Sea Island in 1928, President Calvin Coolidge planted a live oak to commemorate the occasion. The planting became a tradition observed by a succession of distinguished guests including presidents and heads of state. In addition to President Coolidge, those who personally planted trees included Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, Queen Juliana of the Netherlands, President George H.W. Bush, Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, and President Bill Clinton. During the G8 conference in 2004, President George W. Bush planted a tree. Only one of the commemorative trees is not a live oak. In 1931, Howard Coffin planted an English oak acorn from General Oglethorpe's estate in England, to honor the founder of the Georgia colony. G8 summit 2004 G8 summit. From June 8‚Äì10, 2004, President George W. Bush chose to host a summit of the Group of Eight leaders at Sea Island. Present at the summit were Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada, President Jacques Chirac of France, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, Prime Minister Junichir≈ç Koizumi of Japan, President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and Prime Minister Tony Blair of the United Kingdom. Also in attendance were European Union Commission President Romano Prodi and several other invited heads of state. Sea Island was selected for the summit in part because its relative isolation facilitated the extensive security arrangements necessary for such a gathering. As part of the security measures, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated the summit a National Special Security Event (NSSE). Access to the island was tightly controlled, and press headquarters (the International Media Center) was located in Savannah, Georgia, some to the north. Protesters and demonstrations were marginalized, in part because the conference venue was located in a nearly inaccessible place. The leaders and other summit participants discussed issues faced by developing countries in Africa and elsewhere, ranging from peacekeeping operations, HIV/AIDS vaccine development, famine relief, debt reduction, and the eradication of polio. Golf A significant portion of Sea Island's culture and economy revolves around golf. In 1928, two years after Sea Island Company founder Howard Coffin purchased Retreat Plantation, the first nine- hole course was completed and fittingly named Plantation. The next year the second nine, Seaside, was established. In the near future golf legends such as Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen, and Sam Snead all ventured to Sea Island to play the courses. The first tournament played in the area was the Sea Island Ladies Open Invitational in 1954, which was won by World Golf Hall of Famer Louise Suggs. Over time, the third resort course, Retreat, and two non-resort affiliated courses, Frederica Golf Club and Ocean Forest Golf Club, were also founded on the island. In 2001, the scope of golf in Sea Island expanded greatly and golf became the centerpiece that it is today in the area. The creation of the Lodge at Sea Island has allowed golfers to stay on the golf course property. Two premier amateur golf tournaments were played at Ocean Forest Golf Club. The Walker Cup, one of the most prestigious amateur events throughout the world, was held in August of 2001 and even featured an opening ceremony headlined by President George H.W. Bush. The second tournament held at Ocean Forest was the inaugural Jones Cup Invitational, named after the club's founding family. Since then, the Jones Cup has been played every year at Ocean Forest, and in 2009 the Jones Cup Junior Invitational was created and held at the Seaside course. Both of these events attract golfers from across the country to compete in very exclusive tournaments at extremely challenging venues. The following year, the largest tournament that is played in Sea Island was founded. The PGA Tour, with the help of host and Sea Island native Davis Love III, held the first ever McGladrey Classic (now the RSM Classic) on both the Plantation and Seaside courses. The Sea Island community has benefited greatly from this event, through increased exposure and the yearly contributions the Davis Love Foundation raises throughout the tournament week. This tournament has helped attract individuals to travel to or live in Sea Island, which has helped grow the economy in the area and led to the expansion of the resort.

Typically, this will be the removal of water from a solution or suspension, such as the removal of water from fruit juice. One benefit of producing a concentrate is that of a reduction in weight and volume for transportation, as the concentrate can be reconstituted at the time of usage by the addition of the solvent. Soft drink concentrates The process of concentrating orange juice was patented in 1948. It was originally developed to provide World War II troops with a reliable source of vitamin C. Today, the majority of retailed orange juice is made from reconstituted orange juice concentrate. Most sodas and soft drinks are produced as highly concentrated syrups and later diluted with carbonated water directly before consumption or bottling. Such concentrated syrups are sometimes retailed to the end-consumer because of their relatively low price and considerable weight savings. Condensed milk is also produced for transport weight savings and resistance to spoilage. Most juice and soda concentrates have a long shelf-life due to high sugar content and/or added preservatives.

Venus is in the upper right quadrant The 2012 transit of Venus, when the planet Venus appeared as a small, dark spot passing across the face of the Sun, began at 22:09 UTC on 5 June 2012, and finished at 04:49 UTC on 6 June. Depending on the position of the observer, the exact times varied by up to ¬±7 minutes. Transits of Venus are among the rarest of predictable celestial phenomena and occur in pairs. Consecutive transits per pair are spaced 8 years apart, and consecutive pairs occur more than a century apart: The previous transit of Venus took place on 8 June 2004 (preceded by transits on 9 December 1874 and 6 December 1882); the next pair of transits will occur on 10‚Äì11 December 2117 and December 2125 within the 22nd century. Observations of the event Path across the Sun, with contact times and other data Visibility map The entire transit was visible from the western Pacific Ocean, northwesternmost North America, northeastern Asia, Japan, the Philippines, eastern Australia, New Zealand, and high Arctic locations including northernmost Scandinavia, and Greenland. In North America, the Caribbean, and northwestern South America, the beginning of the transit was visible on 5 June until sunset. From sunrise on 6 June, the end of the transit was visible from South Asia, the Middle East, east Africa, and most of Europe. The phenomenon was not visible from most of South America, nor from western Africa. There were a number of live online video streams with footage from telescopes around the world. Midway through the transit one of the NASA streams had nearly 2 million total views and was getting roughly 90,000 viewers at any given moment. In Los Angeles, crowds jammed Mount Hollywood where the Griffith Observatory set up telescopes for the public to view the transit. In Hawaii, hundreds of tourists watched the event on Waikiki Beach where the University of Hawaii set up eight telescopes and two large screens showing webcasts of the transit. The transit was also observed and photographed by a flight engineer aboard the International Space Station, Don Pettit. NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory could not see the transit as it was not in between the Earth and the Sun at the time of the event, but high-definition images of the event were obtained by Solar Dynamics Observatory, from above the Earth. Agency astrophysicist Dr. Lika Guhathakurta said, \\"We get to see Venus in exquisite detail because of SDO's spatial resolution, SDO is a very special observatory. It takes images that are about 10 times better than a high- definition TV and those images are acquired at a temporal cadence of one every 10 seconds. This is something we've never had before\\". Research Children in Dili observing the transit of Venus The 2012 transit gave scientists a number of research opportunities. These included: *Measurement of dips in a star's brightness caused by a known planet transiting a known star (the Sun). This will help astronomers when searching for exoplanets. Unlike the 2004 Venus transit, the 2012 transit occurred during an active phase of the 11-year activity cycle of the Sun, and would have provided practice in detecting a planet's signal around a \\"spotty\\" variable star. *Measurement of the apparent diameter of Venus during the transit, and comparison with its known diameter. This will have given information on how to estimate exoplanet sizes. *The number of locations documenting the event will provide much data via parallax that will generate more accurate measurements. *Observation of the atmosphere of Venus simultaneously from Earth-based telescopes and from the Venus Express spacecraft. This gave a better opportunity to understand the intermediate level of Venus's atmosphere than is possible from either viewpoint alone, and should provide new information about the climate of the planet. *Spectrographic study of the atmosphere of Venus. The results of analysis of the well-understood atmosphere of Venus will be compared with studies of exoplanets with atmospheres that are unknown. *The Hubble Space Telescope used the Moon as a mirror to study the light reflected from Venus to determine the makeup of its atmosphere. This may provide another technique to study exoplanets. * Experimental reconstruction of Lomonosov's discovery of Venusian atmosphere (1761) with antique refractors. The researchers observed the \\"Lomonosov's arc\\" and other aureole effects due to Venus's atmosphere and concluded that Lomonosov's telescope was fully adequate to the task of detecting the arc of light around Venus off the Sun's disc during ingress or egress if proper experimental techniques as described by Lomonosov in his 1761 paper are employed.

The field and track at Villanova Stadium are known as \\"Goodreau Field\\" and \\"Jumbo Elliott Track,\\" respectively. On May 7, 1930, the playing field at Villanova Stadium was dedicated to the memory of Leo J. Francis Goodreau, a Villanova football player who died due to injuries incurred in practice. On September 27, 1980, the running track was dedicated to Villanova's legendary track and field coach James \\"Jumbo\\" Elliott. Renovations In Fall 1999, the stadium underwent a face-lift with the Stadium Renovation Project. Included in this project was a state of the art press box, in addition to housing an 80-person meeting room for all Villanova Athletic Department personnel to use. The former AstroTurf playing field was replaced during the spring of 2002 with a synthetic grass surface known as AstroPlay. In Fall 2009, the stadium received a new scoreboard along with a new playing surface. In 2016, a new football operations building, the Andrew J. Talley Athletic Center, which also serves as the training room for the sports programs at the school, opened, named for the school's first head coach since the May 1984 reinstatement of the program until the end of 2016.

For example, the attribute named number might have the value singular. The value of an attribute may be either atomic, e.g. the symbol singular, or complex (most commonly a feature structure, but also a list or a set). A feature structure can be represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), with the nodes corresponding to the variable values and the paths to the variable names. Operations defined on feature structures, e.g. unification, are used extensively in phrase structure grammars. In most theories (e.g. HPSG), operations are strictly speaking defined over equations describing feature structures and not over feature structures themselves, though feature structures are usually used in informal exposition. Often, feature structures are written like this: \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mbox{category} & noun\\\\ phrase\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mbox{agreement} & \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\mbox{number} & singular \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mbox{person} & third \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\end{bmatrix} Here there are the two features category and agreement. Category has the value noun phrase whereas the value of agreement is indicated by another feature structure with the features number and person being singular and third. This particular notation is called attribute value matrix (AVM). The matrix has two columns, one for the feature names and the other for the values. In this sense a feature structure is a list of key-value pairs. The value might be atomic or another feature structure. This leads to another notation for feature structures: the use of trees. In fact, some systems (such as PATR-II) use S-expressions to represent feature structures.

Heterobranchia is one of the main clades of gastropods. Currently Heterobranchia comprises three informal groups: the lower heterobranchs, the opisthobranchs and the pulmonates.Bouchet P. & Rocroi J.-P.

Diversity  The three subdivisions of this large clade are quite diverse: * The Lower Heterobranchia includes shelled marine and freshwater species. * Opisthobranchia are almost all marine species, some shelled and some not. The internal organs of the opisthobranchs have undergone detorsion (unwinding of the viscera that were twisted during torsion). * The Pulmonata includes the majority of land snails and slugs, many freshwater snails, and a small number of marine species. The mantle cavity of the Pulmonata is modified into an air- breathing organ. They are also characterized by detorsion and a symmetrically- arranged nervous system. The pulmonates almost always lack an operculum and are hermaphroditic. Taxonomy  Berthella martensi, a pleurobranch.  Older taxonomy  The families currently included in Heterobranchia have historically been placed in many different parts of the taxonomic class of gastropods. Earlier authors (such as J.E. Gray, 1840) considered Heterobranchia to consist of only marine gastropods, and conceptualized it as a borderline category, intermediate between the Opisthobranchia & Pulmonata, and all the other gastropods. The (sometimes recognized) category Heterostropha within the Heterobranchia, which includes such families as Architectonicidae, the sundial or staircase snails, is primarily characterized by a shell which has a heterostrophic protoconch, in other words the apical whorls are coiled in the opposite plane to the adult whorls. The classification of this group was revised by Ponder & War√©n in 1988. According to the older taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Ponder & Lindberg, 1997) the Heterobranchia were ranked as a superorder.  2005 taxonomy  The graph of neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree shows that there is no clade-supporting pattern for the monophyly of Opisthobranchia (green) or of Pulmonata (yellow) based on datasets by J√∂rger et al.

For a detailed taxonomy, see Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005)#Clade Heterobranchia.  2010 taxonomy  J√∂rger et al.

It was published in 1999. Plot summary William Mandella, protagonist of The Forever War, lives with his wife Marygay on the icy world Middle Finger, a planet of the Mizar system. Dissatisfied with the state of their society, they eventually decide to jump forward in time, using the time dilation of interstellar travel. Their intention is to travel for 10 subjective years, at relativistic speeds, into the future, during which 40,000 Earth years will have passed on Middle Finger. They, along with other Forever War veterans and other disenchanted humans on Middle Finger, hope that whatever they will find upon their return will be more to their liking. This requires the consent of the posthuman group mind now known as 'Man', and of the alien group mind Tauran race. When permission is denied, William and allies hijack the ship. After Marygay and William head away from their planet, a series of unexplained occurrences happen and the ship starts to lose antimatter mysteriously. They abandon the ship and return home. Instead of the intended 40,000 years, they have only been away 24 Earth years. Upon arrival, they find the planet still intact, but seemingly vacant; everyone having literally disappeared at the same time as the incident on their ship. They then return to Earth and in the course of the investigation they discover a shape-shifting being posing as an android cowboy at a western-themed amusement park. This being has been on Earth and the other inhabited planets for millennia and is not certain of its own origin. It also has no idea what happened to the denizens of Earth. The resolution involves a god who evidently created the universe as an experiment. This god explains that the action of leaving the galaxy on a 40,000 year round-trip is similar to a laboratory mouse escaping its cage.

He is also known for appearing on the third series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, and the thirteenth series of Strictly Come Dancing, in which he was partnered with Janette Manrara. During his time on I'm A Celebrity, Andre developed an on-screen romantic relationship with fellow contestant Katie Price. Andre and Price were married two years after the show's finale; they had two children, and together they released the album A Whole New World (2006), before divorcing in 2009. In 2009, Andre released the album Revelation, with the single \\"Behind Closed Doors\\", which reached No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart. He followed it up with his seventh studio album Accelerate in 2010. Early life and music career Andre was born on 27 February 1973 in Harrow, London, and is of Greek Cypriot descent. In 1979, as a six-year-old, Andre and his family relocated to Sydney, before settling on Australia's Gold Coast when he was nine. At the age of 14, Andre finished runner-up to Wade Robson in a dancing competition where the prize was to meet Michael Jackson. In 1989, 16-year-old Andre became a contestant on Australian talent show New Faces, and as a result, he was offered a recording contract for $146,000. During this time, Andre lived in a beach-side apartment in Surfers Paradise. and attended Benowa State High School on the Gold Coast In the early 1990s, Andre established himself on the Australian music scene. In 1992, Andre released his debut single, \\"Drive Me Crazy\\", which peaked at No. 72 on the Australian singles chart. However, his musical breakthrough occurred with his second single, \\"Gimme Little Sign\\", which peaked at No. 3 and spent a total of 31 weeks in the charts. In 1993, Andre received an ARIA Award for highest-selling Australian single of the year. His second studio album was released on 30 September 1996, peaking at No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart. The album included the hit single \\"Mysterious Girl\\", which peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart. As a result, Andre returned to the UK in the mid-1990s.

It was the largest student occupation in Canadian history, and resulted in $2 million of property damage. Background The Sir George Williams Affair has been labelled as a riot when, in fact, it was a peaceful protest until the riot police arrived. It all started in 1968 when six West Indian students accused biology professor Anderson of discrimination because of alleged unfair grading. These accusations were laid against Anderson on May 1968. There was no meeting held to discuss the incident and to find a solution. This issue could have been resolved promptly but it was not taken seriously by the administrators. Eight months later, students took matters into their own hands by organizing meetings, sit-ins and peaceful protests. There were also additional events happening at the university and in the city of Montreal that contributed to the festering crisis and its destructive conclusion. In October 1968, a few months before the riot, Montreal hosted two conferences on the position of black people in society. The first conference was hosted at the University and organized by black alumni and some professors and other members of the University. The first was a conference engaging Black organizations across Canada represented by Black leaders from Halifax to Vancouver. According to \\"Expression\\", a quarterly publication of the Negro Citizenship Association Inc (Conference Issue Winter 1968) the purpose of the conference was to examine the \\"problems in the Canadian society with reference to Black people\\". The second, \\"The Black Writers Conference\\" was hosted at McGill University. This conference was focused on \\"the ideology of Black Power and Black Nationalism\\". The two conferences held weeks apart and at the two different venues reflected formal agreements to disagree on priorities and span of action: domestic versus international. Both of these conferences contributed to the tensions at Sir George Williams University. Other elements that contributed to the riots were a series of miscommunications between the students and the University administration, and the nature of the University itself, which was an institution that encouraged non-traditional educational philosophy, openness and accessible higher education to a wider range of students from different backgrounds and different social standings.  Overview  In Montreal, the estimated population of black people was 7,000 in 1961 which increased to 50,000 in 1968. McGill University was the first choice of University for many students but since they had a strict admission policy they could not be easily accepted. Sir George Williams University had a more lenient admissions policy and accepted students from various backgrounds. Classes were offered during the day and night, which was convenient for students. Sir George Williams University was very popular among foreigners.David Austen, \\"All Roads Led to Montreal: Black Power, the Caribbean, and the Black Radical Tradition in Canada\\", The Journal of African American History, Vol.92, 2007, p.517 The occupation was sparked by the university's mishandling of racism allegations against the biology professor Perry Anderson at the school, who was accused of being biased in his grading of black students. In the spring of 1968, six black students from the West Indies had accused Anderson of racism, charging that he had given them lower grades than what their work merited. One black student, Rawl Frederick wrote a poem describing the atmosphere at Sir George Williams entitled Man Trap that read: \\"They designate institutions, we disintegrate in infernos, They consummate animals that abort us, Nursing grounds for dysgenic beasts, Developing ghettoes/employing social workers to create Negroes. Man-trap, I know your name, your face\\". Rodney John, one of the six students who made the complaint against Anderson recalled in a 2019 interview: \\"What made it even more farcical was the experience of Terrence (Ballantyne, another student). He had a white lab partner. Terrence handed in his lab. His lab gets 7 out of 10. His lab partner borrows Terrence‚Äôs lab and copies it word for word. The guy gets the lab back and guess what? He gets a higher mark and doesn‚Äôt get any marks deducted for being late. Just imagine you have 13 students each with their own stories. This was a pattern.\\" Additionally, it was charged that in the classroom that Anderson would address black students as \\"mister\\" while he addressed white students by their first names, which was widely seen as evidence that he was prejudiced against his black students. In September 1968, the complaints against Anderson of racial bias were denied by the university administration. In general, the university administration had a patronizing and dismissive attitude towards the black students, taking the viewpoint that it was self-evident that Anderson was not a racist and the students complaining about him were just \\"whiners\\" unhappy with the failing grades that they had brought about themselves. When John asked to see the report clearing Anderson, he recalled: \\"When we asked to see a copy of the report, nobody had a copy. Eventually it was stated the report had been sent to the principal. So we went to his office. He didn‚Äôt have a copy of the report either. What was told to us was it got lost in the internal mail\\". All through the fall of 1968, there had a mounting mood of frustration and rage by the black students against a university administration that was indifferent to their concerns. On 28 January 1969, The Georgian, the student newspaper ran a special edition accusing Anderson of racism, and the university administration of a cover-up. The issue of The Georgian galvanized the student community, most of whom had been previously unaware of the matter. Beginning on January 29, 1969, over 400 students occupied the university's computer lab. Fed up with what they considered to be intransigence on the part of the administration, black and white students left a meeting and occupied the university computer lab on the ninth floor of the Henry F. Hall Building. Two of the leaders of the students were Roosevelt \\"Rosie\\" Douglas and Anne Cools. John stated: \\"We‚Äôre talking about an era of social change and development of a social consciousness. Many students were prepared to join the cause on that basis. At the height of the occupation you had anywhere from three to five hundred bodies involved. A great majority at that time were white students. But you also had black students who identified with the struggle. Racism was rampant in the community and the university was not insulated from that racism. And so you had a tremendous rippling effect.\\" Most of the occupation was quite peaceful: the police were not involved, and negotiations continued. On 10 February 1969, an agreement was reached under which the students would leave the Hall building in exchange for a new committee to examine the allegations of prejudice against Anderson. However, most of the students refused to leave the Hall building. The occupation continued until February 11 when negotiations broke down and riot police were called in to storm the Hall building. After they learned that the university was planning to renege on the agreement, the remaining students began to barricade themselves in. The faculty of Sir George Williams, siding with Anderson, vetoed the agreement to have a new committee appointed to examine the allegations of racial bias against black students. Instead, the administration asked for the Montreal police to evict the students from the Hall building. As the police and the students fought in the halls, other students threw the computer punch cards out of the windows, littering the streets above with thousands of punch cards. A fire broke out in the computer lab, forcing the occupiers out of the building; 97 of them were arrested. John accused the police of starting the fire: \\"The violence was perpetuated ‚Äî I have no hesitation saying this ‚Äî by the police and the administration. Are students going to start a fire when they‚Äôre locked in?\\" As the building burned, the crowds watching the scene from below chanted \\"Let the niggers burn!\\" and \\"Burn, niggers, burn!\\". As the students tried to escape from the burning building, they were arrested, subjected to racist insults and beaten savagely by the police. Once in custody, the 87 students were divided by race with the 38 black students being separated from the white students. The computer lab was destroyed, resulting in over $2 million in damage. The entire incident was recorded live by television crews, and the most memorable image associated with the riot was smoke raising from the Hall building while the streets were swamped with punch cards. Windows were broken and computer tapes and punched cards tossed onto the street below. The charges against most of the rioters were eventually dismissed. A total of 1, 044 charges were brought by the Crown, of which only 50 were heard in court, 9 were unheld and 22 were dropped. The governor-general of Canada, Roland Michener, who was touring the West Indies at the time was unable to give a speech at the St. Augustine campus of the University of the West Indies in Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad and Tobago, as various radical students accused Canada of being a racist country. Public opinion in Canada was overwhelmingly against the students who were denounced as \\"rampaging criminals\\", \\"thugs\\" and \\"anarchists\\". The man considered the leader of the protest, Kennedy Frederick of Grenada, was denied bail and brought to court in a cage as if he was an animal. The media blamed lax immigration laws that allowed \\"trouble-making\\" students from the West Indies to attend Canadian universities. Several of the occupiers had privileged backgrounds, coming from wealthy West Indian families; among those arrested and convicted were Roosevelt Douglas, who later became Prime Minister of Dominica, and who was a son of one of the richest men in Dominica. Also arrested was Anne Cools, now a Canadian Senator. Deeply involved also was student Cheddi \\"Joey\\" Jagan Jr., son of Guyana's prime minister. Some claim that the computer lab was not damaged, except for several million computer punched cards that were sent fluttering to the street below; but a Canadian Broadcast Corporation documentary shows smashed computer tape drives and extensive fire damage. The damage was listed in millions of dollars. It is unknown who caused the fire. The police accused the occupiers of the damages, while the occupiers accused the police of setting the fire as an easy way to get all the students out of the room without physically entering it.

The occupation became a key event illustrating the widespread disaffection and rebelliousness among the nation's youth during the 1960s.

In April 1971 Sir George Williams adopted University Regulations on Rights and Responsibilities and the Ombuds office was established. The Sir George Williams affair also raises the question of racism in Canada. When the fire broke out during the destruction of the computer lab and many protesters were still in the building, white passerby yelled ‚Ä≥Let The Niggers Burn‚Ä≥. This incident sparked interest and raised questions internationally.David Austen,All Roads Led to Montreal: Black Power, the Caribbean, and the Black Radical Tradition in Canada,The Journal of African American History, Vol.92,2007,521 Film In February 2014, director Mina Shum and producer Selwyn Jacob began shooting in Montreal on a National Film Board of Canada feature documentary entitled Ninth Floor, about the Sir George Williams Affair. Filming coincided with the 45th anniversary of the incident. The film had its world premiere at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival, on September 12. The film focuses on individuals who were connected to the incident, and how it shaped their lives. The film shows the events at the time, and follows up on the lives of those involved decades later.

It lies between Worksop and Harthill, and is located at an elevation of around 110 metres above sea level. At the 2011 Census, it had a population of 476, down from 502 in 2001.Office for National Statistics : Census 2001 : Parish Headcounts : Rotherham Retrieved 28 August 2009 The rectangular-towered parish church of St Peter, a predominantly 12th-century structure with 15th-century additions, is emblazoned with Norman carvings, and has been nominated among England's 1,000 best churches. The village has a public house, the Parish Oven. History The name Thorpe derives from the Norse for an outlying farmstead, while Salvin refers to 13th century lord of the manor Ralph Salvain. There are earlier references to the settlement though, including a mention in the Domesday Book as Rynkenild Thorp, part of Roger de Busli's Laughton en le Morthen estate. This name refers to the settlement's place on the Roman road of Rynkenild Street, now Packman Lane. Within the bounds of the parish is Netherthorpe Airfield which has been active since 1933. The Old Hall, Thorpe Salvin Thorpe Hall Thorpe Salvin contains the ruins of Thorpe Hall, a manor house designed and built by Robert Smythson in 1570. It was built on the site of the previous manor house which was the residence of an earlier lord of the manor, Sir Bryan Sandford, Knight, who fought for Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth Field, 19 August 1485. Sir Bryan was one of many who defected from Richard III's army just days before the battle. For more information about this and the Sanford Family of Co.Yorks and Virginia, see the Sanford Index, Revised, by Charles M. Marsteller. In 1636, the hall was bought by Edward Osborne. When his descendant Thomas Osborne became Duke of Leeds, he moved out to a grander property in Kiveton Park, and the hall fell into disuse. It was partially demolished in the 1820s, with only the south front now remaining. It is Grade II* Listed.

It is a member of the Waterloo Region District School Board. The school dates from 1855, making it one of the oldest high schools in Kitchener and Waterloo. Its sports teams are known as the Raiders. History The school first opened on April 2, 1855 as the Berlin Senior Boys' Grammar School (Kitchener was formerly named Berlin, but changed at the time of World War I). It initially was located in a building at the corner of King and Eby streets in the downtown area, and tuition cost five shillings per month. From 1857 to 1871, it occupied space in the Berlin Central School (now Suddaby Public School) on Frederick Street. Girls were first admitted to the school in 1866. With increasing numbers at the Central School, the school then moved to the former Swedenborgian Church on Church Street. In 1874, land was purchased at a cost of $650 for the first permanent home for the school at its current location on King Street West, closer to the Waterloo border. The building cost $5,804 and opened in 1876. By this time it was called Berlin High School (Ontario legislation passed in 1871 renamed grammar schools \\"high schools).\\" In 1876, teacher David Forsyth started laboratory experiments in science class. He and the school were considered pioneers in this regard. Commercial subjects were added to the curriculum by 1884. Manual training was also introduced in the 19th century. Music was also introduced in 1884. Athletics became available after 1891. In 1903, building commenced on the first addition to the school (since then, ten other additions have been made). While construction was taking place, some classes were moved to the City Hall and to Kitchener's Carnegie library. On November 30, 1904, a Provincial-Order- in-Council raised the school to the status of a collegiate institute, and the school became the Berlin Collegiate Institute. By 1905 the new building was in use. The school changed names along with the city in 1916 to Kitchener Collegiate Institute. By 1919 the school was quite crowded, and the office and other unsuitable rooms were being used as classrooms. As well, the Dominion and Provincial governments had recently announced a policy assisting municipalities in funding of schools. Plans for an expansion were drawn, but were not approved by the municipality. Two years later, however, a set of revised plans were approved. These plans involved demolishing the 1876 building, modernizing the 1903-4 building, which still stands, and placing in front of it a new gymnasium, auditorium, front hall, and classrooms, as well as an east wing of classrooms in place of the 1876 building. Construction started on July 2, 1922. The new school opened for classes on September 4, 1923. The formal opening of the building took place on April 4, 1924, when the school was given its current name. Kitchener‚ÄìWaterloo Collegiate and Vocational School shortly after the opening of the 1924 extension. In 1924 there were 550 students, a figure that had increased to 1,418 students by 1932. Due to cramped conditions, grade 9 classes were held in the downtown Victoria Public School and in King Edward Public School from 1933 to 1951, when the west-wing addition was completed.Boulden, 1980 In 1948, KCI introduced driver education, one of the first schools to do so. In 1955, KCI celebrated its 100th anniversary. For the previous hundred years, KCI had been the only public high school in Kitchener and Waterloo. However, in 1956, Eastwood Collegiate Institute opened. Less than 20 years later there were eight high schools in Kitchener and Waterloo. Many of the new schools' principals were former teachers at KCI. In 1969, the Kitchener and Waterloo High School Board, which had been the governing body of the school for over a century, came to an end. KCI became part of the Waterloo County Board of Education (now the Waterloo Region District School Board). In the 1970s, the City of Kitchener designated the front foyer of the school as a heritage structure under the provisions of the Ontario Heritage Act. The school's 125th anniversary celebrations took place on the weekend of May 16-18, 1980. Over six thousand former students took part. In 2003, considerable controversy arose when the Waterloo Region District School Board was selecting a high school to close, in order to open a new school in the southwest end of Kitchener (this was required under the provincial funding model of the time). A large public outcry began when the staff report recommended the closure of KCI, along with Southwood Secondary School. Although the school was plagued with many heating, plumbing and electrical problems due to its age, sentimentality and emotions won the day and some repairs and renovations were decided upon. Critics of this proposal noted that KCI had a significant history and a unique culture among secondary schools in Kitchener and Waterloo, partly due to the wide variety of socio-economic and cultural backgrounds among its students. Regardless of the enormous job and associated costs, further analysis of the financial situation by trustees, eliminated the need for a Kitchener school closure. In 2004, football coach Ed Dietrich was selected runner-up \\"NFL/CFL High School Coach of the Year\\". In 2005, the school celebrated its 150th anniversary reunion from May 27‚Äì29. The school underwent extensive renovations in 2006, with money from the provincial government. Some students are concerned that there is still no air conditioning. Building facade, 2005 In March 2017, KCI opened its renovated main office. The space now includes a new meeting room, staff mailbox area and unisex washrooms; the construction used wood reclaimed from the original office. Traditions The school colours are red, yellow, and black (adopted from the flag of Germany because of the city's German heritage), and its motto is Veritas Vincat (Latin, May Truth Prevail); until 1916 the motto was H√∂her Hinauf (German, To the Heights). At various points since his introduction, there have been contentious debates about the propriety of the former school mascot, a First Nations raider named Rodney. Citing the issue of racism and pressure from special interest groups, the school reluctantly change the school mascot to a pirate while maintaining the raider name. Notable alumni Statue of W.L.M. King, on the school's lawnThe most famous alumnus of the school was William Lyon Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of Canada for over 21 years, who was a student between 1887 and 1891. During the school's 150th anniversary celebrations, a statue of him as a student was unveiled on the front lawn of the school.

The land that comprised a row of lots that spanned the entire length of a new township was \\"conceded\\" by the Crown for this purpose (hence, a \\"concession of land\\"). Title to an unoccupied lot was awarded to an applicant in exchange for raising a house, performing roadwork and land clearance, and monetary payment. Concession roads and cross-cutting sidelines or sideroads were laid out in an orthogonal (rectangular or square) grid plan, often aligned so that concession roads ran (approximately) parallel to the north shore of Lake Ontario, or to the southern boundary line of a county. Unlike previous American colonial practice, land in Ontario was surveyed first before being allocated to settlers. The provision of road allowances was an advance over earlier survey systems which allocated no roadways. Waterloo township, for example, had no road allowances. In some townships, the \\"line road\\" name (e.g., Ninth Line) was applied to the roads that elsewhere were called \\"concession roads\\", i.e., roads that ran between two adjacent concessions. Corner of 8th Concession and 18th Sideroad, King Township, Ontario Survey Systems By one count, there were five major Ontario survey systems, with 166 variations, resulting in a \\"crazy quilt\\" of surveys. In many cases special colonization roads ran diagonally across the grid. Survey lines referenced back from the Great Lakes ran at different angles, forming triangles and other irregular shapes. Some townships had more than one survey. Holland, Nelson and Toronto Township (today Mississauga) are examples. In a common square grid layout known as a 1,000 Acre Sectional System, adjacent parallel roads were 100 chains or apart, and arranged as 10 100-acre lots each 20 chains by 50 chains so that two consecutive concession roads and two consecutive side roads enclosed a square of . Another system used 100-acre lots each 30 by 33.333 chains, again arranged in 1000-acre blocks. Concession roads were 5/6-mile apart, while sideroads were 1-7/8 mile apart. Other plans used during colonial surveying used different layouts and lot sizes of 100, 150, 160, 200 or 320 acres. Sample Survey Size, Ontario Concession System In a Single Front survey, lots were measured from one side of the concession to the other. Any errors in the survey became apparent at the road junctions, with the side roads being offset.Example Jogged Intersection in Single Front TownshipSingle Front Survey Example (Ontario) In a Double Front survey, lots were measured from the front of the concession to a midpoint, and then from the back of the concession to the midpoint. This makes the road junctions even, but any errors result in jogs at the midpoint of the side road. Example Even-Intersection Jogged- Sideroad in Double Front Township Double Front Survey Example (Ontario) Special Terms * Road Allowance‚Äîa strip of land for provision of a public road between lots. Typically 66 feet wide or one chain. * Unopened Road Allowance - is a public highway that has not been opened and assumed for maintenance purposes by-law of the township. * Baseline‚ÄîThe first concession road in a township, was often called the baseline (from the surveying term), and roads so named remain in many municipalities, including Ottawa, Clarington and London. * Front‚Äîthe first concession road was also frequently called the front. * Broken front‚Äîconcession along a lake shore. * Townline‚Äîa boundary line or road between two townships, e.g., Adjala-Tecumseth Townline. Note that townlines might be side roads. * Given Roads‚Äîspecial roads made to avoid natural obstacles interfere with the grid. * Gore‚Äîtriangular shaped lots Concession Road Numbering There is considerable variation in concession road nomenclature. Markham, for example, has both \\"Ninth Line\\" and \\"11th Concession Road\\". In some townships, numbering is sequential, starting from one side. For example, in King Township, concessions start from Yonge. Bathurst is the (former) Second Concession road, between concessions 1 and 2 (forms the front of the second concession of land). There is no \\"first\\" concession road. In some townships, the baseline passed through the middle, with concessions numbered on each side. *For example, In Peel, Hurontario Street is the centre line, with concession line roads being numbered East or West. In present-day Mississauga (which has two surveys) McLaughlin Road is the former \\"First Line West\\" in the northern survey, north of Eglinton Avenue, and Mavis Road is its counterpart in the southern survey (both fronting second concession of land). *In Warwick Township in Lambton County, the Egremont Road was the baseline, with successive concessions numbered either \\"North of the Egremont Road\\" (\\"NER\\") or \\"South of the Egremont Road\\" (\\"SER\\"). In some townships, such as those in Bruce County, each side of each successive concession road comprised a separate numbered concession. Thus, the south side of a road might be Concession 2 and the north side Concession 3. In this system, for the purposes of road signing only even (or, sometimes, odd) numbers were used, so that concession roads were successively numbered, e.g., 2, 4, 6, etc. This simplified the address numbering of farm lots, especially along township boundary roads where opposite sides of the same road were in different townships. Where even numbers were used, the numbers of odd-numbered concessions would appear only in property records (e.g., Lot 18, Concession 11, Brant Township, which would be on the north side of Concession Road 10). Many concession roads retain their original names. Less developed areas are often referred to as \\"back concessions\\". Side Road Numbering Side road or sideline numbering varies depending on the township. Some examples: * Sequential‚ÄîIn King Township, sideroads were numbered consecutively. The last concession road was 13, so the first sideroad was 14, the next 15, and so on. * By adjacent lot number‚ÄîMany townships in Bruce County, are numbered in multiples of 5, i.e., starting with the town line (road on township boundary), then numbered 5th, 10th, 15th, and so on, with five lots between each pair of successive sidelines in the original township survey. The side road number is tied to the adjacent lot number. The \\"side road\\" name survives on several roads in Ontario. In Renfrew County, most side roads are given legitimate names. Such as Stokes Road, Patterson Road, Dillabough Road, Cheese Factory Road, among others. The Renfrew County is known for many lines, such as Barr Line (generally called ‚ÄúThe Barr Line), Rice Line, Snake River Line, Cahill Line, among countless others. They also have roads named after obscure settlements that no one other than those who study the area know about, hence Pine Valley Road (one sign simply marks as ‚ÄúPine Valley‚Äù), Donegal Road, Wolftown Road, Connaught Road. As well as major roads like Foymount & Brudenell Road, (County Road 512), known by some as ‚ÄúThe 512‚Äù. It was made famous in Canadian rapper Lil Canuk in his song ‚ÄúDown On the 512‚Äù, talking about life on Foymount Road, in communities such as Cormac, Foymount, Donegal, and Eganville. He had another song called ‚ÄúThe 613 (Call Me)‚Äù, which name drops Dacre, Hyndford, Scotch Bush Road, The Barr Line, Renfrew, Mount Saint Patrick, Douglas, Eganville, Griffith, Calabogie, Beachburg, Westmeath, Haley Station, Martins Corners, Kelly‚Äôs Corners, Bulgers Corners, Greenwood, Pembroke, Ferguslea, Forestlea, Foymount, Brudenell, Pine Valley Road, and Castleford, as well as Arnprior, Station and Woito Station. ‚ÄúThe Prior‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Frew‚Äù Down in the Station ‚ÄúHaley‚Äù, ‚ÄúWoito‚Äù, and ‚ÄúKillaloe‚Äù All three corners ‚ÄúBulge‚Äù, ‚ÄúKelly‚Äù, and down by ‚ÄúMartin‚Äù From Hyndford to the Scotch Bush to over in Dacre Up Mount St. Paddy, to Mountain of the Foy, take a rest in Wilno, to Brundell. Impact In most of Upper Canada this layout of roads preceded urban development, so that most Ontario municipalities now have grid patterns of streets. In cities, many concession roads have become major streets. However, a few of the \\"sideline\\" roads in urban areas still retain their historic numbered lines or use \\"Line\\" for their street designations: Brown's Line, Ninth Line, and Guelph Line are important thoroughfares in Toronto and its western suburbs.

Description and history Streetsville Secondary School was opened in 1957. The school has 873 students, and of the 925, 476 are French Immersion. As of February 2019, forty students are bused in. The school features a main floor and a second floor on its north side. It has two gymnasiums, one large in size, and the second being half the size of the first. When the school first opened, the smaller gym was originally intended to be a swimming pool. The school has a library, which was recently renovated and expanded, and a cafeteria. The school has several unusual classes including Grade 11 and 12 Photographic Arts, the unusual aspect being the darkroom available for student use, one of the last remaining in the Peel school system. Also available to students is Music Production, a course teaching the recording and mastering of music using computers. In 2005, the French immersion programme for students was introduced at Streetsville Secondary School where students can learn bilingualism in Canada. The courses offered are: French Immersion (Grades 9-12), Science and Geography of Canada (Grade 9), Contemporary Canadian History, Career Studies, and Civics (Grade 10), World History to the 16th Century (Grade 11), and Canadian and World Issues: A Geographic Analysis (Grade 12). Up until summer of 2005, the school had 13 portable buildings. However, in 2005, Mississauga Secondary School opened in the area and about half of the grade 9 and 10 students attending Streetsville had to switch schools due to boundary changes. This dropped the overall attendance by about 500, and all of the portables have been removed. The sole portable remaining was used as an extension of the school's drama room until it was removed in 2006 due to budget cuts. In 2015, the roof of the portapac collapsed due to flooding after a heavy rainstorm. Mold was discovered within the portapac and as such, it was boarded up. 3 portables have been added to the back of the school to replace the portapac, which was removed during the $7 million renovation/expansion that the school underwent during the summer of 2015 and the 2015-16 school year that included the removal of all materials containing asbestos from the building as well as installing new windows throughout the building. The portapac was replaced with a permanent extension to the school.

It has a diverse student population. The school has an English as a Second Language (ESL) program to assist new immigrants, and a Peer Assisted Learning (PALS) program. The school is also a Regional Enhanced Learning Centre for the secondary program.  History  The Woodlands School was opened in the year 1969. While the first phase of its present building was under construction, The Woodlands operated within Springfield Public School building. In September, 1970, the school's students and staff moved to the new building, and The Woodlands became a combined elementary and secondary school. The facility received a major renovation throughout 2016. This renovation implemented a new open concept design to the front of the school, and also removed the old library building attached to the school, replacing it with a new elementary classroom wing. An elevator was later built near the front of the school. Academics  Elementary students  Students in grades 7 through 8 are enrolled in a full-year schedule of two terms per year, with the subjects taught rotated on a ten-day cycle. Report cards for each term are sent home with each student in January and June, Progress reports are given out in October. and elementary classes continue throughout the secondary exam periods.  Secondary students  Courses are offered at the Enhanced, Academic, Applied, and Locally Developed levels. Woodlands also offers a gifted education program. Students currently residing in north, central, or west Mississauga who are identified as gifted through the Canadian Cognitive Abilities Test are given the option of attending the Woodlands, with transportation provided by the Peel District School Board.

Early career MTH's founder, Mike Wolf, started assembling and selling trains at the age of 12 in 1973 for Williams Electric Trains, which had begun producing reproductions of vintage trains manufactured by Lionel Corporation, in the early 1970s. By 1980, Wolf was operating a mail order business selling Williams trains and parts out of his bedroom in his parents' home. When Williams decided to end its line of Lionel Standard gauge and O gauge reproductions, Wolf bought the tooling and continued building the replicas. Although many published reports have stated that Williams had acquired original Lionel tooling, both Wolf and Jerry Williams deny this claim. From 1983 to 1987, MTH marketed the reproduction trains on its own. In 1987, Lionel approached Samhongsa, MTH's subcontractor in South Korea, about manufacturing Standard Gauge trains that bore the Lionel name. Samhongsa directed Lionel to Wolf. Before the end of 1987, MTH became a Lionel subcontractor, allowing MTH's Lionel reproductions to bear the Lionel name and be marketed by Lionel itself. As part of the agreement, MTH sold Lionel trains product as part of its mail order business. By the early 1990s, MTH was the second-largest mail-order Lionel dealer in the country. MTH had a troubled relationship with Lionel that ended in April 1993 when MTH decided to re-enter the market with an O scale model of the General Electric Dash 8 diesel locomotive, which Wolf had first offered to produce for Lionel. Turned down, Wolf decided to market the locomotive himself, citing reduced orders from Lionel for MTH's replicas as the reason. Then-Lionel CEO Richard Kughn, who learned of the decision from a flyer at a train show, responded by canceling MTH's Lionel dealership. MTH, in turn, filed an anti-trust suit against Lionel, which was settled out of court in 1995. MTH then expanded its product line, adding the former Lionel vintage reproductions, reproductions of equipment from other manufacturers, and new original designs. By 1998, MTH was the largest manufacturer of O gauge trains, eclipsing Lionel's market share by approximately $60 million to $50 million. At its peak, MTH employed about 135 people. MTH also produced many sets of New York City Subway cars, licensed by the MTA, and two sets of Chicago 'L' cars. Lionel currently holds the MTA license for the NYC Subway cars in O scale while Walthers holds the license in HO scale after acquiring Life-Like. The license transfer is in part due to MTH producing sets covered in graffiti. MTH and Lionel developed a rivalry similar to that between Lionel and Ives in the 1930s and Lionel and American Flyer in the 1940s and 1950s. Although their train cars are the same size and can operate as part of the same train, the two companies' locomotives use their own proprietary electronic control systems. MTH uses a system called Digital Command System (DCS), which is capable of operating MTH engines as well as engines using Lionel's Trainmaster Command Control (TMCC), used by many other O gauge manufacturers, and Digital Command Control (DCC), which is an open industry standard used by most two-rail scales. In December 1999, three former employees of Samhongsa rival Korea Brass were convicted of industrial espionage for stealing and using proprietary MTH designs to produce models for Lionel. In April 2000, MTH again sued Lionel, this time for industrial espionage, citing as evidence original electronic drawing files and the precedent set in the South Korean criminal courts. On June 7, 2004, a jury in Detroit, Michigan found Lionel guilty and awarded MTH $40.8 million. The following day, Lionel announced it would appeal the verdict. On December 14, 2006, the judgement was overturned on appeal, citing legal mistakes in the jury trial, and a new trial was ordered. Later career MTH has also traded lawsuits with Quantum Sound Industries, whose technology is used to add electronic sound to model locomotives from various manufacturers. MTH's critics also say the company patented some elements of DCC, which was supposed to be an unencumbered open standard. As of June 2004, MTH has 57 employees and annual sales of about US$40 million. News reports from the fall of 2004 estimated MTH's annual sales at closer to $30 million. As a privately held company, MTH does not officially release sales figures. In its 2007 reorganization plan, Lionel estimated MTH's annual revenue at about $30 million and stated that MTH is the second-largest manufacturer of O gauge trains in terms of market share. Although MTH is disliked by Lionel collectors because its reproductions have lowered the market value of all but the most pristine vintage Lionel equipment and disliked by some other hobbyists because of its aggressive marketing and legal tactics, MTH is widely credited with bringing innovations into a hobby that had changed very little since the 1950s as well as lowering prices. On December 30, 2005, the Union Pacific Railroad sued MTH for using its logos, along with logos of various fallen flag railroads it has acquired, without a license. UP had previously sued other manufacturers, most notably Lionel and Athearn, for the same reason. At the time of the suit, UP had 104 licensees. The suit requested that MTH stop using the trademarks, pay damages, and send UP-branded inventory to the railroad for destruction. On November 8, 2006 MTH Electric Trains and Union Pacific Railroad announced that they had amicably settled the trademark infringement case that U.P. filed against MTH in the Omaha, Nebraska federal court. The settlement benefits both parties as well the entire model railroad industry, allows Union Pacific to continue to protect its intellectual property, and authorizes MTH‚Äôs use of Union Pacific‚Äôs trademarks and paint designs on model train products and accessories. Union Pacific has also decided to change its trademark-licensing program so that model railroad manufacturers will no longer have to pay a royalty and will enjoy a perpetual license to use Union Pacific trademarks and paint designs on model railroad products. In late 2007, Lionel and MTH settled their long-term fight over trade secrets and patent infringements. In March 2008, the court approved a settlement, which has its details under court seal, that includes a one time cash payment to MTH that will take place soon after Lionel exits bankruptcy. In 2009, Lionel Electric Trains (Lionel, LLC) and MTH Electric Trains began working together under the Lionel Corporation banner. For three decades, MTH Trains had been making Tinplate Reproductions of trains, but did not have the authentic Lionel and American Flyer graphics on the models and boxes. In 2009, the two joined forces, allowing MTH Trains to produce the Lionel tinplate electric trains with the official graphics. The interior electronics are from MTH Electric Trains, but the exterior bears the Lionel Corporation graphics. In June 2020, it was announced that the CEO, Mike Wolf, will be retiring and MTH will be shutting down forever in May 2021.https://mthtrains.com/news/658 The licensing agreement between M.T.H. and Lionel LLC to manufacture tinplate trains with the Lionel logo were terminated in 2019. While an option to continue the relationship was proffered, the renewal terms offered by Lionel for an extension beyond 2019 were not conducive for any future M.T.H. tinplate plans. * Classic Toy Trains (March 1994).

A substantially similar law, the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act was passed during the 108th Congress on April 30, 2003. Legislative history The bill was sponsored by Senator Joseph Biden, along with cosponsors Chuck Grassley, Orrin Hatch, Joseph Lieberman, Strom Thurmond, Patrick Leahy and Richard Durbin.Patrick Leahy and Richard Durbin withdrew their sponsorship of the bill in September 2002. The bill was referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary on June 18, 2002. June 27, 2002 it was reported out of the committee without written comment or amendment and placed on the Senate Legislative Calendar. On October 10, 2002, Senator Biden provided introductory remarks on the bill before the Senate. This bill was introduced to the Senate again on January 7, 2003 by Senator Thomas Daschle[SD] with co-sponsors; Senator Joseph Biden Jr. [D-DE], Senator Hillary Clinton [D-NY,] Senator Jon Corzine [D-NJ], Senator Mark Dayton [D-MN] Senator Richard Durbin [D-IL], Senator Edward Kennedy [D-MA], Senator Patrick Leahy [D-VT], Senator Patty Murray [D-WA], Senator Jack Reed [D-RI], Senator Charles Schumer [D-NY]. This bill also failed to pass. On Thursday (April 10, 2003) the Senate and House passed the Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act (formerly known as the RAVE Act) as an attachment to the child abduction-related AMBER Alert Bill. The language of the original act was changed slightly before the bill was passed without public hearing, debate or a vote. Purpose The stated purpose of the Act was: \\"A bill to prohibit an individual from knowingly opening, maintaining, managing, controlling, renting, leasing, making available for use, or profiting from any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance, and for other purpose.\\"See text of statute. Substantive law changes of the Act The Act would have modified section 416(a) of the Controlled Substances Act (also known as the \\"crackhouse law\\" and codified at United States Code, ) to expand the section regarding \\"Establishment of manufacturing operations\\", which previously outlawed maintaining, managing or owning any place used to manufacture, distribute or use drugs to include temporary or permanent uses of the premises. The Act also would have created a civil penalty of $250,000 or \\"2 times the gross receipts, either known or estimated, that were derived from each violation that is attributable to the person.\\", whichever was greater. Additionally, the Act recommended that the United States Sentencing Commission reconsider the then-current Federal sentencing guidelines with respect to offenses involving Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid, commonly known as a date rape drug. Public commentary on the Act Most of the public commentary regarding the RAVE Act centered on the prologue section of the bill titled \\"Findings.\\" Such sections do not create new substantive law but serve as guidance to the judiciary in interpreting the law and the executive in enforcing the law. Among the items listed in the \\"Findings\\" section include statements regarding rave promoters providing \\"chill rooms\\" and bottled water for large fees, where participants can go and cool down from the body-temperature-raising effects of ecstasy; and selling \\"neon glow sticks; massage oils; menthol nasal inhalers; and pacifiers that are used to combat the involuntary teeth clenching associated with ecstasy.\\" Specifically, many were concerned that these expansive definitions might permit the police to arrest and charge concert promoters under this law so long as glow sticks and bottled water were present. \\"RAVE Act: RIP Live Electronic Music\\", Kuro5hin.org, July 7, 2002 Congress was also accused of picking an easy, public target so as to continue support for the War on Drugs. Others were concerned that too much responsibility would be placed on concert promoters to police their patrons.\\"Chemical Warfare: The RAVE Act\\", AlterNet, October 8, 2002 Also, many were concerned that their First Amendment right to freedom of assembly would be violated were the law enacted.http://www.law.indiana.edu See also * Retracted article on dopaminergic neurotoxicity of MDMA References Drug culture Proposed legislation of the 107th United States Congress Drugs in the United States ","title":"Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act"},{"id":"712110","text":"Colombey-les-Deux-√âglises () is a commune in the Haute-Marne department in north-eastern France.

The opposing term, referring to the original entity after which something else was named, is called an eponym. History The word is first recorded in the mid-17th century, and probably comes from the phrase describing people connected \\"for the name's sake\\". Proper Usage When namesake refers to something or someone who is named for something or someone else, the second recipient of a name is usually said to be the namesake of the first. This usage usually refers to humans named for other humans, but current usage also allows things to be or have namesakes. Sometimes the first recipient can also be called the namesake; however, the correct and unambiguous term would be the eponym. Family Naming a child after a relative, friend, or well-known person is a common practice in the English- speaking world. Continued practise of naming a child for the parent or grandparent may result in several relatives (e.g. cousins) being namesakes of each other despite not having been named for each other. Among Ashkenazi Jews, it is customary to name a child after a dead relative, such as the child's grandparent, but never after a living person., citing Sefer Chassidim 460; Shaarei Halachah Uminhag, vol. 3, p. 298. Sephardic Jews traditionally are encouraged to name their children after relatives, living or dead. Greek families traditionally name a child after its paternal grandparents and the second child of the same sex is named after its maternal grandparents. Suffixes When a son is named for his father, \\"Jr.\\"/\\"II\\", \\"III'\\", or another name suffix may be added to the name of the son (and sometimes \\"Sr.\\" or a prior number to the father's name), in order to distinguish between individuals, especially if both father and son become famous, as in the case of poet Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and his son, Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., an Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. Sometimes the \\"Jr.\\" or \\"Sr.\\" suffix is applied even when the child's legal name differs from that of the parent. One example is that of the singer Hiram King Williams, known professionally as Hank Williams, and his son Randall Hank Williams, known professionally as Hank Williams Jr. Daughters being named for their mothers using similar suffixes is less common. One example is thoroughbred jockey Rosemary Homeister Jr. whose mother was also a jockey before turning to train. A more archaic method of distinguishing father from son was to follow the name with the Elder or the Younger, respectively, for example William Pitt the Elder and William Pitt the Younger. Concepts Buildings, such as the Trump Tower, and companies, like the Ford Motor Company, are often named for their founders or owners. Biologic species and celestial bodies are frequently named for their discoverers.See, e.g., (species); and (comets). Alternatively, their discoverers may name them in honor of others.See, e.g., (species of spider named for actor Harrison Ford). Occasionally, material goods, such as toys or garments, may be named for people closely associated with them in the public mind. The teddy bear, for example, was named for President Theodore Roosevelt, because of a popular story in which the then-President objected to cruel treatment of a bear by hunters. The fedora hat may be considered the \\"namesake\\" of a fictional character, Princess F√©dora Romanoff, from an 1887 play, F√©dora, by Victorien Sardou. In her portrayal of that character, Sarah Bernhardt wore a soft felt hat with a center crease, which became known popularly as a \\"fedora\\".

Colony of Nueva Helvetia The Swiss pioneer John Sutter (1803-1880) arrived in Alta California with other Euro-American settlers in August 1839. He established an agricultural and trading colony, with the stockade Sutter's Fort, and named it \\"Nueva Helvetia.\\" It was located at the confluence of the Sacramento River and American River. In English the name means \\"New Switzerland\\", after Sutter's home country. The design was influenced by Fort Vancouver, the principal trading station of the Columbia Department, operated by the Hudson's Bay Company, which Sutter visited in 1838 before entering Alta California.Dillion, Richard. Fool's Gold, the Decline and Fall of Captain John Sutter of California. New York City: Coward-McCann. 1967, p. 66. The site of \\"Nueva Helvetia\\" is just a few miles east of where his son, John Sutter, Jr., established Sacramento, and is on the eastern edge of present-day downtown Sacramento. Rancho New Helvetia Rancho New Helvetia, in Spanish Rancho Nueva Helvetia, was a Mexican land grant issued in 1841 by Governor Juan Alvarado to John Sutter. It encompassed lands in present-day Sacramento County, Sutter County, and Yuba County, California.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco The grant extended roughly from near present-day Marysville, southwards along the Feather River, to the confluence of the Sacramento River and American River near present-day Sacramento.Dise√±o del Rancho New Helvetia It was significantly larger than Sutter's 1839 Nueva Helvetia colony. By 1840, the pueblo (town) and rancho settlements in Mexican Alta California were primarily located on coastal plains and the inland valleys near them. The Californios were worried about encroachments by foreigners, especially by American immigrants. To serve as a buffer \\"against their invasion, and \\"marauding\\" bands of Indians, hunters, and trappers\\", Governor Alvarado granted eleven square leagues of land, the maximum under Mexican law, in the lower Sacramento Valley, then in the interior of the territory. Part of Sutter's mandate with the grant was to encourage settlers, and he made numerous grants of parcels of land. However, these grants far exceeded the quantity of land ultimately awarded to him. Operations As many as six hundred Indians worked at New Helvetia during the wheat harvest. Other industries included \\"a distillery, hat factory, blanket works, and a tannery.\\" These workers were recruited through local leaders such as Maximo, a Miwok who had sent many workers to Mission San Jos√© and Anashe. Housing and working conditions at the fort were very poor, and have been described as \\"enslavement\\", with uncooperative Indians being \\"whipped, jailed, and executed.\\" Housing for workers living in nearby villages and rancher√≠as was described as somewhat better.Hurtado (1988), p. 57-59 The settlement was defended by an army of Miwok, Nisenan, and Mission Indians, all consisting of 150 infantry, 50 cavalry, and German- speaking white officers. This group, wearing Russian uniforms purchased from Fort Ross, marched to the Pueblo of Los Angeles area and briefly defended Governor Manuel Micheltorena from the revolt of the Californios. Gold Rush In January 1848 James W. Marshall found gold at Sutter's Mill on the rancho, starting the California Gold Rush. Sutter was forced to abandon his business ventures at the settlement after that, when the area was overrun by large numbers of gold-seekers. Sutter's Fort is preserved as a California State Historic Park. With the gold rush, Sutter's workers abandoned him to seek their fortune in the gold fields. Later, squatters occupied his land. By 1852, Sutter was bankrupt. An engraving of New Helvetia made in 1849 Post- statehood With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, in 1852 Sutter filed a claim with the Public Land Commission for the eleven square leagues granted by Alvarado in 1841. In 1853 Sutter amended his petition, and claimed an additional 22-square-league \\"Rancho New Helvetia Sobrante\\", granted to him and his son, John A. Sutter Jr., by Governor Manuel Micheltorena in 1845. Both grants (New Helvetia and Sobrante) were confirmed by the US District Court in 1857, but the US Attorney General filed an appeal and took the case to the US Supreme Court. Although Sutter could not produce the original records of his grant, the Supreme Court accepted the 1841 Alvarado grant (Rancho New Helvetia) and sent the 1845 Micheltorena grant (Rancho New Helvetia Sobrante) back to the district court.United States v.

Each of the four sundays in Advent has an additional own door. An Advent calendar is a special calendar used to count the days of Advent in anticipation of Christmas. Since the date of the First Sunday of Advent varies, falling between November 27 and December 3 inclusive, many Advent calendars, especially those that are reusable, often begin on December 1, although those that are produced for a specific year often include the last few days of November that are part of the liturgical season. The Advent calendar was first used by German Lutherans in the 19th and 20th centuries. Design and use An Advent calendar featuring Santa Claus riding his sleigh Traditional Advent calendars feature the manger scene, Saint Nicholas and winter weather, while others range in theme, from sports to technology. They come in a multitude of forms, from a simple paper calendar with flaps covering each of the days to fabric pockets on a background scene to painted wooden boxes with cubby holes for small items. Many Advent calendars take the form of a large rectangular card with \\"windows\\", one for each day of December leading up to and including Christmas Eve (December 24) or Christmas Day (December 25). Consecutive doors are opened every day leading up to Christmas, beginning on the start of the Advent season for that year, or in the case of reusable Advent calendars, on December 1. Often the doors are distributed across the calendar in no particular order. The calendar windows open to reveal an image, a poem, a portion of a story (such as the story of the Nativity of Jesus), or a small gift, such as a toy or a chocolate item. Often, each window has a Bible verse and Christian prayer printed on it, which Christians incorporate as part of their daily Advent devotions. Advent calendars may also have puzzles and games printed on their reverse side. The long-established British magazine Country Life incorporates an Advent calendar‚Äîwhich it describes as \\"our famous Advent calendar\\"‚ÄîFor example, Country Life, November 25, 2015 in its cover for the final issue of November. There are many variations of Advent calendar, including social media Advent calendars, and string up reusable Advent calendars. Many towns have created living advent calendars. Some Advent calendars even eschew traditional Christmas motifs and themes, focusing only on Jesus as the central character of the Christmas story. The Nordic Julekalender/Julkalender In Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden there is also a tradition of having a so- called Julekalender (Swedish: Julkalender, Finnish: Joulukalenteri, Icelandic: J√≥ladagatal; the local word for a Yule‚Äîor Christmas‚Äîcalendar, even though it actually is an Advent calendar) in the form of a television or radio show, starting on December 1 and ending on Christmas Eve (December 24). Such a show first aired on radio in 1957 in the form of the Swedish radio series Barnens adventskalender; the first televised show of the genre aired in 1960 in the form of the Swedish program Titteliture. The first julekalender aired in Denmark was Historier fra hele verden in 1962. The televised julkalender or julekalendar has now extended into the other Nordic countries; in Finland, for example, the show is called Joulukalenteri. Over the years, there have been several kinds of julekalender; some are directed at children, some at both children and adults, and some directed at adults alone. There is a Julkalender radio show in Sweden, which airs in the days leading up to Christmas. A classic example of a julekalender enjoyed by children (as well as adults, if purely for nostalgic reasons) is the 1979 Norwegian television show Jul i Skomakergata; another is the 1990 Icelandic television show √Å ba√∞kari til Betlehem.

History The concept of the funnel cake dates back to the early medieval Persian world, where similar yeast-risen dishes were first prepared. and later spread to Europe. Pennsylvania Dutch immigrants brought the yeast dish, known as Drechderkuche, to America, and around 1879, they developed the baking powder version along with its new name, funnel cake. Preparation Funnel cakes are made by pouring batter into hot cooking oil in a circular pattern and deep frying the overlapping mass until golden-brown. The batter is commonly poured through a funnel, creating its texture and giving its name. When made at concession stands, a pitcher with an integral funnel spout is employed. Alton Brown recommends they be made with choux pastry, which expands from steam produced by its high water content. Funnel cakes are typically served plain with powdered sugar but can also be served with jam/jelly, cinnamon, chocolate, fresh fruit, or other toppings. They are similar in recipe to angel wings, the difference being the density of the mix. The dough for angel wings is viscous enough to be cut into shapes and dropped into the oil by hand. By location A funnel cake topped with custard and whipped cream. Europe In south German cuisine, the equivalent is called Strauben or Strieble and is made and served similarly. In Finnish cuisine, the analogous tippaleip√§ (literally droplet bread) is traditionally served at May Day (Vappu) celebrations, alongside sima. In Lithuania, it is called skruzdƒólynas, which literally translates to \\"ant nest\\". It is normally made in early spring to empty last year's honey stock and make more space for the new one, and it is also made at the first harvest of honey. Asia In the Indian subcontinent, a similar dessert, with a crystallized sugary exterior coating, is called jalebi. In Iran, this is known as zulbia and is a popular dessert. These differ from funnel cake in using no baking powder, which results in a somewhat chewy texture. Kumukunsi is another similar native doughnut from the Maguindanao people in the Philippines. It is made with rice flour, duck eggs, and sugar that is molded into rope-like strands and then fried in a loose spiral. They have the taste and consistency of creamy pancakes. North America In North America, funnel cakes were originally associated with Pennsylvania Dutch Country. It is one of the first North American fried foods, which is associated with the Pennsylvania Dutch, German immigrants who came to Pennsylvania in the 17th and 18th centuries. Today, it is a staple dish that can be found at amusement parks and fairs all over the country. The name ‚Äúfunnel‚Äù later came from the technique used to make the cakes, in which the pancake-like batter is poured into hot oil through a funnel.

King was part of the Philadelphia team that played from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of World War I. This period of cricket in the United States was dominated by \\"gentlemen cricketers\\"‚Äîmen of independent wealth who did not need to work. King, an amateur from a middle-class family, was able to devote time to cricket thanks to a job set up by his teammates. A skilled batsman who proved his worth as a bowler, King set numerous records in the continent of North America during his career and led the first-class bowling averages in England in 1908. He successfully competed against the best cricketers from England and Australia. King was the dominant bowler on his team when it toured England in 1897, 1903, and 1908. He dismissed batsmen with his unique delivery, which he called the \\"angler\\", and helped develop the art of swing bowling in the sport. Sir Pelham Warner described Bart King as \\"one of the finest bowlers of all time\\", and Donald Bradman called him \\"America's greatest cricketing son.\\" Early and personal life King was born in Philadelphia on October 19, 1873. Early in his life, he worked in a linen trade. Although this was the family business, his father later allowed him to leave to enter the insurance industry. King was not a member of the aristocratic and wealthy families of Philadelphia that produced many of the era's top cricketers. King's obituary in Cricket Quarterly suggests that his career in insurance was set up for him by those families to allow him to continue playing the game. In 1913 (or 1911\\"Pennsylvania, Philadelphia Marriage Indexes, 1885‚Äì1951,\\" index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/JVZ4-KYS : accessed October 19, 2013), John B King and Lockhart, 1911.), King married Fannie Lockhart; the marriage lasted for fifty years. King's wife died in 1963, and he died in 1965 in his native Philadelphia two days before his 92nd birthday. Bart King was regarded by many of his contemporaries as an affable person. Ralph Barker called him the Bob Hope of cricket thanks to his quips and stories. King was also noted for making jabs at opponents, but leaving them laughing at themselves. The same held true when he would question umpires that turned down his appeals. He is said to have spoken for ninety minutes at a dinner during his last tour to England, punctuated every few seconds with laughs. The dinner guests were kept laughing even while King spoke with a dead-pan expression. One man who attended the dinner noted that King \\"told his impossible tales with such an air of conviction ... that his audiences were always in doubt when to take him seriously. He made their task doubly difficult by sprinkling in a fair mixture of truth with his fiction.\\" Cricketing career King played most of his Philadelphia club career at the Belmont Cricket Club. Like most young American men of this era, Bart King came to cricket only after first playing baseball. He began to play club cricket at Tioga Cricket Club in 1888, aged 15, starting out as a batsman. Tioga was one of the lesser Philadelphian cricket clubs. King played his first recorded match for the club in 1889, when he was tried as a bowler due to his physique. He took 37 wickets for 99 runs for the club in the 1889 cricket season. King played for Tioga until 1896, when he joined Belmont Cricket Club. King joined the Philadelphian cricket team for three tours of England while playing at Belmont. King's most dominating matches came during these tours, playing with the premier American team of the era. Australia in Philadelphia In 1893, the Australian team stopped by Philadelphia on its way home from a tour of England. Australia fielded a strong side, but the team was tired after a long tour and trip. In spite of this fatigue, the Australians chose to face the full strength of the Gentlemen of Philadelphia in a three-day match starting September 29. On a small ground at Belmont, the September grass was coarse. It had been rolled so that the ball moved very quickly across the ground. The Australian side, fielding first, dropped many catches and could not cope with the short boundary, allowing the Philadelphians to reach a huge total of 525 runs. King came in to bat last, at number 11, making 36 runs. The leading Australian bowlers, Hugh Trumble and George Giffen, took 2 for 104 and 0 for 114 respectively. When the Australians came to bat, they hoped that they would, by now, have recovered from their tiring journey, but ran into problems when dealing with Bart King's developing swing bowling. The side was all out for 199, with King taking 5 wickets for 78 runs. The Australians followed on and were all out again for 268, allowing the Gentlemen of Philadelphia to win by an innings and 68 runs. The cricket world was stunned that a single American city could turn out a side capable of beating the full strength of Australia. The Australians won the return match on October 6 by six wickets, but the Australian captain, Jack Blackham, said to the Americans, \\"You have better players here than we have been led to believe. They class with England's best.\\" Tour of England in 1897 Bart King c. 1905 King won the Child's Bowling Cup, the premier award for bowling in American cricket, for the first time in 1896, and joined the Philadelphian cricket team's tour of England in 1897. The tour was very ambitious, and was arranged mainly for educational purposes: few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a low level of competition. In 1897, the tour started on June 7 at Oxford, ending in late July at The Oval almost 2 months later. The schedule included fifteen matches against all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field. While the tour initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on June 17. King demonstrated his batting ability in the first innings with a fourth-wicket stand of 107 with John Lester. He then took 7 wickets for 13 runs, and Philadelphia dismissed Sussex for 46 in less than an hour. King took 6 for 102 in Sussex's second innings, helping the Philadelphians to victory by 8 wickets. Despite the excitement surrounding King's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall, and the results may have been worse than hoped for by the tour's promoters. Philadelphia won only two of their fifteen matches, losing nine and earning a draw in the remaining four. After their win against Sussex, the only other win of the tour came against Warwickshire. During this match, King took 5 for 95 and 7 for 72 and scored 46 runs. According to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, King proved himself to be the best bowler on the American side and had to do much of the work. He bowled three hundred overs, more than anyone else in the team, taking 72 wickets with a bowling average of a little over 24 runs. In addition to his bowling, King scored 441 runs as a batsman at a batting average of just over 20. Following the 1897 tour, many English counties were interested in securing King's services. It was thought that he would not play as a professional, so alternative means of remuneration had to be found: one county reportedly offered to arrange a marriage with a widow who had an income of ¬£7000 per year. In the end, King returned to the United States, where he continued to perform very well in club cricket. Tour of England in 1903 The Philadelphian team returned to England in 1903. This proved to be King's most successful tour, particularly his performances in the matches against Lancashire and Surrey. King played in 13 of the 15 matches on the tour, missing two with a strained side. In his first match, against Cambridge University, he took 5 for 136 and 4 for 28. He followed that with 8 for 39 in the first innings against Oxford University, though the match was eventually abandoned as a draw due to rain. In his next match, against Gloucestershire, he took 2 for 26 in the first innings but did not bowl in the second. He also took 7 for 51 and 2 for 28 against a strong MCC side at Lord's. Then came the Lancashire match at Old Trafford Cricket Ground. In Lancashire's first innings, King bowled 27 overs and took 5 wickets for 46 runs. The Philadelphians passed Lancashire's first innings score, but their lead was quickly overtaken in Lancashire's second innings. With the wind strong over King's left shoulder, the scene was set for him to dominate the opposition. In his first over after the lunch break on day two of the match, he yorked one of Lancashire's opening batsmen and his replacement with successive balls. He clean bowled two more batsmen in his second over, and bowled a stump out of the ground in the third. In 3 overs, he had taken 5 wickets for 7 runs. After this performance, King had to be rested in the field. One batsman was run out before King returned to take 4 more wickets, ending the innings with 9 for 62. The Philadelphians won next morning by nine wickets. Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering again. It was in this match that King gave what Barker called his finest first-class performance ever. Batting first, he scored 98 runs in the Philadelphian's first innings before being run out, and he then took 3 for 89 in Surrey's reply. In the second innings, he made 113 not out and then took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that he fell asleep during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match. Tour of England in 1908 King toured England with the Philadelphians a third time in 1908. This tour included both first-class matches and more minor ones. The first match that was played was against South Wales in Cardiff. The Philadelphians won by 36 behind the bowling of King and Ranji Hordern. The pair took all 20 wickets of the Welsh side. After this, the first-class matches began with Worcestershire on July 9. Again the Philadelphians won and again Hordern and King took most of the wickets. This trend continued throughout the tour. In the first-class matches that King played, the Philadelphians recorded four wins and six losses. Although he was already 35 years old, King had posted extraordinary numbers in his bowling. He topped the bowling averages for the entire 1908 English cricket season at 11.01. This mark was not bettered until 1958, when Les Jackson of Derbyshire posted an average of 10.99. Later career King's cricketing career did not end with his last first-class match. He continued to play club matches in Philadelphia and participated in non-first-class fixtures around the continent. King is noted for holding the bowling record against Canada. On a rainy afternoon at Philadelphia in 1906, King bowled into a slight breeze to capture 8 wickets for 17 runs. This record came in a four-year period during which King focused on club cricket in Philadelphia, when he won the city's batting award three times and the bowling award four times. King played in his last two international matches in 1912, against Australia. His performances were of the highest quality, given that he was nearing his fortieth year. In the first match, he took 9 wickets for 78 runs to help Philadelphia win by 2 runs; in the second, Australia won by 45 runs despite him taking 8 for 74. King joined the Philadelphia Cricket Club after the 1912 season. Despite being well past his 40th year, he continued to play competitive cricket for another 4 years. His 27-year career ended with his last game for the Philadelphia Cricket Club against Frankford, on July 20, 1916. On this occasion, his bowling and batting skills had declined, but he maintained a batting average of 43.33 for that final season. Death King died at a nursing home in his native Philadelphia in 1965, two days short of his 92nd birthday. The Times newspaper in the UK ran an obituary for him, which quoted Plum Warner as saying that: \\"Had he been an Englishman or an Australian, he would have been even more famous than he was.\\" Achievements and legacy Bart King's bowling delivery Though King focused on bowling throughout his career, he was also a very fine batsman. In 1905, he established a North American record batting record by scoring 315 at the Germantown Cricket Club. The following year, he scored 344 not out for Belmont against the Merion Cricket Club, setting a North American batting record which still stands. He scored 39 centuries in his North American career, and he topped 1,000 runs in six seasons. He took over 100 wickets in eight seasons, including a double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in four seasons. In his whole career, he scored 19,808 runs at an average of 36.47, and took 2,088 wickets at an average of 10.47. He took all 10 wickets in an innings on three occasions, and took 9 wickets in an innings five times. One of these occasions, in the Gentlemen of Ireland's first innings in 1909, was followed by a hat-trick in the second innings. There is an apocryphal story of King emulating a famous baseball pitcher of the day, Rube Waddell, by sending all his fielders back into the pavilion and finishing off the opponent's innings on his own. King and Belmont were playing Trenton in the Halifax Cup at Elmwood Cricket Ground. Some versions of the story have him banishing the fielders and then calling one of them to a position back and to the leg side. This fielder was stationed there to pick up the bails which landed at his feet after King bowled his trademark \\"angler\\". This story was disputed some years later by the captain of Trenton, who claimed that when he \\"went in to bat that afternoon, King had four balls left in his over.\\" He claimed to have \\"hit the first delivery to cover point but of course there was no one there. The ball stopped within three feet of the boundary, and King had to chase it. By the time he got back we had run six.\\" The captain claimed to be the only batsmen to have hit four consecutive sixes off King, but commended the bowler on his ability to spin a tale. Thanks to his dominant performance over his career and his renown in the world of cricket, King was elected an honorary member of the Incogniti Cricket Club in 1908 and an honorary life member of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1962. When Plum Warner was asked to name the greatest bowler who ever lived, he said that John Barton King, \\"at the top of his power and speed, was at least the equal of the greatest of them all.\\" King is credited as one of the first bowlers to utilise swing bowling deliberately. Other bowlers in his time could sometimes get the ball to swing, but King was one of the first to do so at will with an old or new ball. He made use of a lethal delivery which he called the \\"angler\\", a product of his experience as a baseball pitcher, to confuse the English batsmen. He would come in with the ball clasped above his head in both hands as would a baseball pitcher. He was famous for his late swing‚Äîin and out‚Äîand would produce the in-swinger with his right hand coming down from a point over his left shoulder. He described it as an in-swinger which, if properly bowled, would change direction sharply in the last 10 or of flight. King used this ball only sparingly and only against good batsmen. After a tour to Philadelphia by an Australian side in 1896, George Giffen said \\"the Philadelphians really have some high-class players, but it was the fact of their bowlers playing us with baseball curves that upset our batsmen.\\" King's First-class batting career, showing runs scored (red bars) and the average of the last ten innings (blue line).

The range runs approximately northwest to southeast in southwestern Wallowa County and eastern Union County between the Blue Mountains to the west and the Snake River to the east. The range is sometimes considered to be an eastern spur of the Blue Mountains, and it is known as the \\"Alps of Oregon\\". Much of the range is designated as the Eagle Cap Wilderness, part of the Wallowa‚ÄìWhitman National Forest. Geography The range is drained by the Wallowa River, which flows from the north side of the mountains, and its tributary the Minam River, which flows through the west side of the range. The Imnaha River flows from the east side of the range. The highest point in the range is Sacajawea Peak, which is above sea level. Sacajawea is the sixth highest mountain in Oregon and the state's highest peak outside of the Cascade Range. Geology Many geologists believe that the Wallowa Mountains in northeastern Oregon are a displaced fragment of the Insular Belt. The core of the Wallowas is composed of the Wallowa Batholith surrounded by Columbia River basalt. In addition there are many older terranes between the batholith and basalt flows. The Wallowa Batholith is formed of granite from a magma upwelling in Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous time (between 160 million and 120 million years ago). The placement of this rock caused uplift of the surface, which at the time was tropical sea. This is evident from the slate, quartzite, and marble present in the mountains, which come from metamorphism of the sedimentary deposits of oceans during the Triassic. At the center of the Batholith are granodioritic rocks, while the outer limits of the range are tonalitic. The granite batholith is cut by dikes; however, these are uncommon. The valley of the Lostine River in the mountains Glaciers carved out the valleys during the late Pleistocene, which left a number of moraines. The series of moraines is formed by a series of glacial advances and retreats. Glacial till is also a common feature of the valleys. The melting of the glaciers produced a large quantity of water, which carried sediment to the valley bottoms, leaving delta deposits on top of the former deposits. Climate In the mountains, much precipitation falls as snow. Total snowfall peaks around March. Most precipitation in the area is orographic precipitation. Near the tops of the mountains, total annual precipitation can exceed per year, while in the valleys it can be as low as .  Avalanches  The Wallowa Mountains are a popular destination for backcountry skiers and snowmobilers. However, avalanches are a consistent threat to backcountry skiers and snowmobilers. In February 2014, two backcountry skiers were killed and two others were serious injured in the southern Wallowas near Cornucopia when an avalanche swept into a mountainside gully. On March 8, 2016 the local avalanche center director, Kip Rand, was killed backcountry skiing near the Hurwal Divide and Chief Joseph Peak (Mount Joseph) in an avalanche following the collapse of a large cornice. Ecology The higher precipitation of the mountains compared with the surrounding country has created a mesic habitat in the Wallowas. Vegetation in the region contains combinations of plants found in both the Rocky Mountains and the Cascades. At low elevations, Douglas fir is the most common tree for slopes, whereas Engelmann spruce and lodgepole pine occur in valley bottoms, with grand fir common below . In meadows and around springs and seeps, willows and sedge grow. Above , subalpine fir is dominant, and whitebark pine is often found on ridges and south-facing slopes. Human history The area was home to the Wallowa band of the Lower Nez Perce. The Nez Perce lived in the canyons and burned trees to create meadows for the horses that they obtained around 1730. In 1834, Captain Bonneville crossed through the mountains and met with the lower Nez Perce on his way to Fort Walla Walla. In the 1840s, people began to move west, bringing settlers through the land. The Nez Perce began to trade with these settlers. A settlement in the mountains was built in 1861. In 1863, a new treaty was signed that relinquished lands that granted by an 1855 treaty, turning them over to the American government. This same year, the settlers in the mountains moved to present-day La Grande. These lands included the Wallowa Valley, home of Chief Joseph. The government first opened the Wallowa Valley to settlement in 1867. Surveyors began to come through and would continue until 1869. The Wallowa Valley was partitioned in 1873, with one half for the Nez Perce and the other for settlers. Two years later, in 1875, the government banned the Nez Perce from the valley. The first road into the valley, a toll road, was constructed the same year. The U.S. Government attempted to force the removal of the Nez Perce in 1877; however, this angered the natives, who chose instead to raid the settlers, leading to the Nez Perce War. Logging came in the late 1880s, using streams and rivers to transport the wood. A dam was constructed on Wallowa Lake in 1884 to help irrigate the valley. In 1908, the first railroad into the valley was completed. Rail lines were built to the upper valley by the Union Pacific Railroad in 1919, allowing for safer transportation of logs. The dam beneath Wallowa Lake was replaced by a concrete dam in 1916, and a new dam was completed in 1929.

It is not currently known whether there are any exponents between 4031399 and 13347311 that produce Wagstaff probable primes. Note that when p is a Wagstaff prime, \\\\frac{2^p+1}{3} need not to be prime, first counterexample is p=683, and it is conjectured that if p is a Wagstaff prime and p>43, then \\\\frac{2^p+1}{3} is composite.  Primality testing  Primality has been proven or disproven for the values of q up to 83339. Those with q > 83339 are probable primes . The primality proof for q = 42737 was performed by Fran√ßois Morain in 2007 with a distributed ECPP implementation running on several networks of workstations for 743 GHz-days on an Opteron processor.Comment by Fran√ßois Morain, The Prime Database: (242737 + 1)/3 at The Prime Pages. It was the third largest primality proof by ECPP from its discovery until March 2009. Currently, the fastest known algorithm for proving the primality of Wagstaff numbers is ECPP. The LLR (Lucas-Lehmer-Riesel) tool by Jean Penn√© is used to find Wagstaff probable primes by means of the Vrba- Reix test. It is a PRP test based on the properties of a cycle of the digraph under x^2-2 modulo a Wagstaff number.  Generalizations  It is natural to considerDubner, H. and Granlund, T.: Primes of the Form (bn \\\\+ 1)/(b + 1), Journal of Integer Sequences, Vol. 3 (2000) more generally numbers of the form :Q(b,n)=\\\\frac{b^n+1}{b+1} where the base b \\\\ge 2. Since for n odd we have :\\\\frac{b^n+1}{b+1}=\\\\frac{(-b)^n-1}{(-b)-1}=R_n(-b) these numbers are called \\"Wagstaff numbers base b\\", and sometimes consideredRepunit, Wolfram MathWorld (Eric W. Weisstein) a case of the repunit numbers with negative base -b. For some specific values of b, all Q(b,n) (with a possible exception for very small n) are composite because of an \\"algebraic\\" factorization. Specifically, if b has the form of a perfect power with odd exponent (like 8, 27, 32, 64, 125, 128, 216, 243, 343, 512, 729, 1000, etc. ), then the fact that x^m+1, with m odd, is divisible by x+1 shows that Q(a^m, n) is divisible by a^n+1 in these special cases. Another case is b=4k^4, with k positive integer (like 4, 64, 324, 1024, 2500, 5184, etc. ), where we have the aurifeuillean factorization. However, when b does not admit an algebraic factorization, it is conjectured that an infinite number of n values make Q(b,n) prime, notice all n are odd primes. For b=10, the primes themselves have the following appearance: 9091, 909091, 909090909090909091, 909090909090909090909090909091, ‚Ä¶ , and these ns are: 5, 7, 19, 31, 53, 67, 293, 641, 2137, 3011, 268207, ... .

The Anatomy of Dependence was described by Harvard professor emeritus Ezra Vogel as \\"the first book by a Japanese trained in psychiatry to have an impact on Western psychiatric thinking.\\"Kageyama, Yuri. \\"Takeo Doi, Scholar on Japanese Psyche, Dies,\\" Associated Press. 6 July 2009. Others critiqued Doi's theories as merely a variety of nihonjinron.Dale, Peter N. (1986). The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, pp. 116-175. In 1986, Doi published a further book, The Anatomy of Self, that expanded on his previous analysis of the concept of amae by a deeper examination of the distinctions between honne and tatemae (inner feelings and public display); uchi (home) and soto (outside); and omote (front) and ura (rear) and suggests that these constructs are important for understanding the Japanese psyche as well as Japanese society. \\"Takeo Doi: Japanese Psychiatrist who Developed the Concept of Indulgent Dependency,\\" The Times (London).

She was the wife of cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, and mother to their two daughters, Olga and Elena Rostropovich. Biography Vishnevskaya was born in Leningrad. She made her professional stage debut in 1944 singing operetta. After a year studying with Vera Nikolayevna Garina, she won a competition held by the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow (with Rachmaninoff's song \\"O, Do Not Grieve\\" and Verdi's aria \\"O patria mia\\" from Aida) in 1952. The next year, she became a member of the Bolshoi Theatre. On 24 March 1957, she made her debut in Finnish National Opera as Tatyana in Eugene Onegin. On 9 May 1960, she made her first appearance in Sarajevo at the National Theatre, as Aida. In 1961, she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Aida; the following year she made her debut at the Royal Opera House with the same role. For her La Scala debut in 1964, she sang Li√π in Turandot, opposite Birgit Nilsson and Franco Corelli. In addition to the roles in the Russian operatic repertoire, Vishnevskaya also sang roles such as Violetta, Tosca, Cio-cio-san, Leonore, and Cherubino. Benjamin Britten wrote the soprano role in his War Requiem (completed 1962) specially for her, though the USSR prevented her from traveling to Coventry Cathedral for the premiere performance. The USSR eventually allowed her to leave in order to make the first recording of the Requiem. Vishnevskaya was married to the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich from 1955 until his death in 2007; they performed together regularly (he on piano or on the podium). Both she and Rostropovich were friends of Dmitri Shostakovich, and they made an electrifying recording of his opera Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk for EMI. According to Robert Conquest, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn stayed at their dacha from 1968 while writing much of The Gulag Archipelago.Robert Conquest, Solzhenitsyn Was a Russian Patriot, Wall Street Journal (8 August 2008) Galina Vishnevskaya with husband Mstislav Rostropovich In 1974, the couple asked the Soviet government for an extended leave and left the Soviet Union. Eventually they settled in the United States and Paris. In 1982, the soprano bade farewell to the opera stage, in Paris, as Tatyana in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. In 1987, she stage directed Rimsky-Korsakov's The Tsar's Bride in Washington, D.C. In 1984, Vishnevskaya published a memoir, Galina: A Russian Story (), and in 2002, she opened her own opera theatre in Moscow, the \\"Galina Vishnevskaya Opera Centre\\". In 2006, she was featured in Alexander Sokurov's documentary Elegy of a life: Rostropovich, Vishnevskaya. In 2007, she starred in his film Alexandra, playing the role of a grandmother coming to see her grandson in the Second Chechen War. The film premiered at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.Galina Vishnevskaya, Now 80, Finds New Success as Film Actress, PLAYBILLArts (31 May 2007) In the last week of her life, Russian President Vladimir Putin honoured her with the First Class Order of Merit for the Fatherland. On 11 December 2012, Vishnevskaya died at the age of 86 in Moscow. She was married three times. Her first marriage was to Georgy Vishnevsky, a sailor. She retained his family name after their divorce. Her second marriage was to the violinist and director of the Leningrad Light Opera company, Mark Rubin, who also served as her manager. This second marriage produced a son, who died at age 2 months, and lasted 10 years before ending in divorce. Her daughters survive her. Recordings Vishnevskaya made many recordings, including Eugene Onegin (1956 and 1970), Mussorgsky's Songs and Dances of Death (1961 and 1976), Britten's War Requiem (with Sir Peter Pears and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, conducted by the composer; 1963), The Poet's Echo (1968), Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov (1970 and 1987), Puccini's Tosca (1976), Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades (with Regina Resnik, 1976), Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk (1978), Tchaikovsky's Iolanta (with Nicolai Gedda, 1984), and Prokofiev's War and Peace (1986).

His semi-autobiographical novel The Short-Timers (1979) was the basis of the film Full Metal Jacket (1987). He was a United States Marine Corps veteran, who served during the Vietnam War. Biography Early life Born in Russellville, Alabama, Hasford joined the United States Marine Corps in 1966 and served as a combat correspondent during the Vietnam War. As a military journalist, he wrote stories for Leatherneck Magazine, Pacific Stars and Stripes, and Sea Tiger. During his tour in Vietnam, Hasford was awarded the Navy & Marine Corps Achievement Medal with Valor Device, during the Battle of Hu·∫ø in 1968. Early literary career Hasford associated with various science fiction writers of the 1970s, including Arthur Byron Cover and David J. Skal. He had works published in magazines and anthologies such as Space and Time and Damon Knight's Orbit series. He also published the poem \\"Bedtime Story\\" in a 1972 edition of Winning Hearts and Minds, the first anthology of writing about the war by veterans. The poem was reprinted in Carrying the Darkness in 1985. First novel and film In 1978, Hasford attended the Milford Writer's Workshop and met veteran science fiction author Frederik Pohl, who was then an editor at Bantam Books. At Pohl's suggestion, Hasford submitted The Short-Timers, and Pohl promptly bought it for Bantam. The Short- Timers was published in 1979 and became a best-seller, described in Newsweek as \\"[t]he best work of fiction about the Vietnam War\\". It was adapted into the feature film Full Metal Jacket (1987), directed by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Hasford, Kubrick, and screenwriter Michael Herr was nominated for an Academy Award. Hasford's actual contributions were a subject of dispute among the three, and ultimately Hasford chose not to attend the Oscar ceremonies. Library books theft charges In 1985, Hasford had borrowed 98 books from the Sacramento, California public library and was wanted for grand theft there. Then, in 1988, shortly before the Oscars ceremony, he was charged with theft after campus police from California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, California, found nearly 10,000 library books in his rented storage locker. At that time, he had 87 overdue books and five years of Civil War Times magazine issues checked out from the Cal Poly-SLO library; the materials were valued at over $20,000. Hasford's book collection included books borrowed (and never returned) from dozens of libraries across the United States, from libraries in Australia and the United Kingdom, and, allegedly, books taken from the homes of acquaintances. Among them were 19th-century books on Edgar Allan Poe and the American Civil War. Hasford had obtained borrowing privileges at Cal Poly-SLO as a California resident, using a false address and Social Security number. Hasford initially denied the charges, but he eventually admitted possession of several hundred stolen books and pleaded nolo contendere (\\"no contest\\") to possession of stolen property. He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment (of which he served three months) and promised to pay restitution from the royalties of his future works. Hasford claimed that he wanted the books to research a never-published book on the Civil War. He described his difficulties as \\"a vicious attack launched against me by Moral Majority fanatics backed up by the full power of the Fascist State.\\" Second and third novels In 1990, he published a second novel, The Phantom Blooper: A Novel of Vietnam, a sequel to The Short-Timers. The sequel was supposed to be the second of a \\"Vietnam Trilogy\\", but Hasford died soon after completing The Phantom Blooper and before writing the third installment. Hasford's final novel is A Gypsy Good Time (1992), a hardboiled, noir detective story set in Los Angeles. Later life and death Hasford, impoverished and suffering from untreated diabetes, moved to the Greek island of Aegina and died there of heart failure on 29 January 1993, aged 45. He is interred at Winston Memorial Cemetery in Haleyville, Alabama.

Traditionally, Icelandic presidential elections in which the incumbent president indicates a wish to obtain a new mandate are uncontested. The current president, √ìlafur Ragnar Gr√≠msson, was first elected in 1996 with 41.4% of the vote, in an election with an 85.9% turnout contested by four candidates. In 2000 he was re-elected without opposition. When √ìlafur Ragnar announced his intention to seek another mandate in 2004, two other candidates emerged: :√Åst√æ√≥r Magn√∫sson, a businessman and pacifism activist, who won 2.6% of the vote in the 1996 election and failed to obtain the necessary 1,500 supporters when he attempted to stand in the 2000 election, and :Baldur √Åg√∫stsson, who was unknown to the general public. Unlike parliamentary elections in Iceland, presidential elections are not fought on the basis of party politics; instead, candidates attempt to use their personalities to attract supporters and appear as a living symbol of national unity. By tradition, the presidency is an almost entirely powerless office, as the presidents almost never use the powers granted to them by the constitution, instead just exercising moral authority. √ìlafur Ragnar, however, has expressed a wish to have a public discussion on the role of the head of state. Unprecedentedly in the history of the Icelandic Republic, on 2 June 2004 √ìlafur Ragnar vetoed a media ownership law passed by the Althing. Dav√≠√∞ Oddsson, who was Prime Minister at the time, claimed that the veto was tainted because the president's daughter worked for Baugur Group, which had recently acquired roughly half of the country's media. There was little doubt that √ìlafur Ragnar would be re-elected, but the veto controversy had an effect on the voting - the unprecedentedly high number of empty ballots (20.6% of the total) was thought to be largely a protest of the veto.

It is his first-person account of the hunt for a computer hacker who broke into a computer at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Summary Author Clifford Stoll, an astronomer by training, managed computers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in California. One day in 1986 his supervisor, Dave Cleveland, asked him to resolve an accounting error of 75 cents in the computer usage accounts. Stoll traced the error to an unauthorized user who had apparently used nine seconds of computer time and not paid for it. Stoll eventually realized that the unauthorized user was a hacker who had acquired superuser access to the LBNL system by exploiting a vulnerability in the movemail function of the original GNU Emacs. Early on, and over the course of a long weekend, Stoll rounded up fifty terminals, as well as teleprinters, mostly by ‚Äúborrowing‚Äù them from the desks of co-workers away for the weekend. These he physically attached to the fifty incoming phone lines at LBNL. When the hacker dialed in that weekend, Stoll located the phone line used, which was coming from the Tymnet routing service. With the help of Tymnet, he eventually tracked the intrusion to a call center at MITRE, a defense contractor in McLean, Virginia. Over the next ten months, Stoll spent enormous amounts of time and effort tracing the hacker's origin. He saw that the hacker was using a 1200 baud connection and realized that the intrusion was coming through a telephone modem connection. Stoll's colleagues, Paul Murray and Lloyd Bellknap, assisted with the phone lines. After returning his ‚Äúborrowed‚Äù terminals, Stoll left a teleprinter attached to the intrusion line in order to see and record everything the hacker did. He watched as the hacker sought - and sometimes gained - unauthorized access to military bases around the United States, looking for files that contained words such as ‚Äúnuclear‚Äù or ‚ÄúSDI‚Äù. The hacker also copied password files (in order to make dictionary attacks) and set up Trojan horses to find passwords. Stoll was amazed that on many of these high-security sites the hacker could easily guess passwords, since many system administrators had never bothered to change the passwords from their factory defaults. Even on military bases, the hacker was sometimes able to log in as ‚Äúguest‚Äù with no password. This was one of the first ‚Å†‚Äî ‚Å†if not the first ‚Å†‚Äî documented cases of a computer break-in, and Stoll seems to have been the first to keep a daily logbook of the hacker's activities. Over the course of his investigation, Stoll contacted various agents at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations. At the very beginning there was confusion as to jurisdiction and a general reluctance to share information; the FBI in particular was uninterested as no large sum of money was involved and no classified information was accessed. Studying his log book, Stoll saw that the hacker was familiar with VMS, as well as AT&T; Unix. He also noted that the hacker tended to be active around the middle of the day, Pacific time. Eventually Stoll hypothesized that, since modem bills are cheaper at night and most people have school or a day job and would only have a lot of free time for hacking at night, the hacker was in a time zone some distance to the east. With the help of Tymnet and agents from various agencies, Stoll found that the intrusion was coming from West Germany via satellite. The Deutsche Bundespost (the West German post office) also had authority over the phone system there, and it traced the calls to a university in Bremen. In order to entice the hacker to reveal himself, Stoll set up an elaborate hoax - known today as a honeypot - by inventing a fictitious department at LBNL that had supposedly been newly formed by an ‚ÄúSDI‚Äú contract, also fictitious. When he realized the hacker was particularly interested in the faux SDI entity, he filled the ‚ÄúSDInet‚Äù account (operated by an imaginary secretary named ‚ÄòBarbara Sherwin‚Äô) with large files full of impressive- sounding bureaucratese. The ploy worked, and the Deutsche Bundespost finally located the hacker at his home in Hanover. The hacker's name was Markus Hess, and he had been engaged for some years in selling the results of his hacking to the Soviet Union‚Äôs intelligence agency, the KGB. There was ancillary proof of this when a Hungarian agent contacted the fictitious SDInet at LBL by mail, based on information he could only have obtained through Hess. Apparently this was the KGB's method of double-checking to see if Hess was just making up the information he was selling. Stoll later flew to West Germany to testify at the trial of Hess and a confederate.

LGBT themes in speculative fiction include lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender (LGBT) themes in science fiction, fantasy, horror fiction and related genres. Such elements may include an LGBT character as the protagonist or a major character, or explorations of sexuality or gender that deviate from the hetero-normative. Science fiction and fantasy have traditionally been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider their heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction. History Before the 1960s, explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in speculative fiction, as the editors who controlled what was published attempted to protect their perceived key market of adolescent male readers. As the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were undisguised homosexuals, though these tended to be villains, and lesbians remained almost entirely unrepresented. In the 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. New wave and feminist science fiction authors realised cultures in which homosexuality, bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm, and in which sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality were commonplace. From the 1980s onwards, homosexuality gained much wider mainstream acceptance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional speculative fiction stories. Works emerged that went beyond simple representation of homosexuality to explorations of specific issues relevant to the LGBT community. This development was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors and their early acceptance by speculative fiction fandom. Specialist gay publishing presses and a number of awards recognising LGBT achievements in the genre emerged, and by the twenty-first century blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable by most readers of speculative fiction. There was a concurrent increase in representation of homosexuality within non-literary forms of speculative fiction. The inclusion of LGBT themes in comic books, television and film continues to attract media attention and controversy, while the perceived lack of sufficient representation, along with unrealistic depictions, provokes criticism from LGBT sources. Critical analysis Zephyr and Hyakinthos: Greek mythology, which often features homosexuality, is a source for much modern speculative fiction and mythic figures continue to appear in fantasy stories. As genres of popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more constrained than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effects that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership.Clute & Nicholls, p. 1088 \\"Sex\\" Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives.Clute & Grant, \\"Sex\\" p. 354 On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due to the influence of lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.Garber & Paleo, p. x \\"Preface\\" In speculative fiction, extrapolation allows writers to focus not on the way things are (or were), as non-genre literature does, but on the way things could be different. It provides science fiction with a quality that science fiction critic Darko Suvin has called \\"cognitive estrangement\\": the recognition that what we are reading is not the world as we know it, but a world whose differences force us to reconsider our own with an outsider's perspective.Darko Suvin, Metamorphoses of Science Fiction, Yale University Press 1979, When the extrapolation involves sexuality or gender, it can force the reader to reconsider their heteronormative cultural assumptions; the freedom to imagine societies different from real-life cultures makes SF an effective tool for examining sexual bias. In science fiction, such estranging features include technologies that significantly alter sex or reproduction. In fantasy, such features include figures such as mythological deities and heroic archetypes, who are not limited by preconceptions of human sexuality and gender, allowing them to be reinterpreted.Marchesani, pp.1‚Äì6 SF has also depicted a plethora of alien methods of reproduction and sex, some of which can be viewed as homo- or bisexual through a human binary-gender lens. In spite of the freedom offered by the genres, gay characters often remain contrived and stereotypical,Garber & Lyn Paleo, p. xix \\"Introduction\\" by Samuel R. DelanyGarber & Lyn Paleo, p. xi \\"Preface\\" and most SF stories take for granted the continuation of heteronormative institutions.Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn Eds.,The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction, \\"Science Fiction and Queer Theory\\", Wendy Pearson, p. 153. Alternative sexualities have usually been approached allegorically, or by including LGBT characters in such a way as to not contradict mainstream society's assumptions about gender roles.Edward James and Farah Mendlesohn Eds.,The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction, \\"Science Fiction and Queer Theory\\", Wendy Pearson, p. 150. Works that feature gay characters are more likely to be written by women writers, and to be viewed as being aimed at other women or girls; big-name male writers are less likely to explore gay themes.Bacon-Smith, p.137 Speculative fiction has traditionally been \\"straight\\";Stephanie A. Smith, \\"A Most Ambiguous Citizen: Samuel R. \\"Chip\\" Delany\\" , American Literary History, Oxford Journals. Retrieved on October 20, 2008 Samuel R. Delany has written that the science fiction community is predominantly made up of white male heterosexuals, but that the proportion of minorities, including gay people, is generally higher than found in a \\"literary\\" group.Samuel R. Delany, Shorter Views, p.268 The inclusion of homosexuality in SF has been described in Science Fiction Culture as \\"sometimes lagging behind the general population, sometimes surging ahead\\".Bacon-Smith, p.135 Nicola Griffith has written that LGBT readers tend to identify strongly with the outsider status of mutants, aliens, and characters who lead hidden or double lives in science fiction.Nicola Griffith, Stephen Pagel Bending the Landscape. Original Gay and Lesbian Writing: Science Fiction, Overlook Press: 1998 In comparison, Geoff Ryman has claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible, with his books being marketed as one or the other, but never both, and David Seed said that SF purists have denied that SF that focuses on soft science fiction themes and marginalised groups (including \\"gay SF\\") is \\"real\\" science fiction.David Seed Ed., A Companion to Science Fiction, \\"Science Fiction and Postmodernism\\" p. 245, Gay and lesbian science fiction have at times been grouped as distinct subgenres of SF,Brian Stableford, Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia, \\"Sex\\", p. 479, and have some tradition of separate publishers and awards.

After the hero distinguishes himself in combat, the king gives him his son the prince in marriage. The all-male society reproduces (male children only) by giving birth from the thigh or by growing a child from a plant produced by planting the left testicle in the moon's soil.Dynes, Johansson, Percy & Donaldson, Pg. 752, \\"Science Fiction\\" In other proto-SF works, sex itself, of any type, was equated with base desires or \\"beastliness\\", as in Gulliver's Travels, which contrasts the animalistic and overtly sexual Yahoos with the reserved and intelligent Houyhnhnms. The frank treatment of sexual topics of pre-nineteenth century literature was abandoned in most speculative fiction, although Wendy Pearson has written that issues of gender and sexuality have been central to SF since its inception but were ignored by readers and critics until the late twentieth century.Pearson, Hollinger & Gordon, Queer Universes: Sexualities in Science Fiction, Liverpool UP, 2008, p. 2 Early works that contained LGBT themes and showed the gay characters to be morally impure include the first lesbian vampire story Carmilla (1872) by Sheridan Le FanuGarber & Paleo, \\"Carmilla\\" p. 76 and The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890) by Oscar Wilde, which shocked contemporary readers with its sensuality and overtly homosexual characters.Garber & Paleo, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" p. 148 An Anglo-American Alliance, a 1906 novel by Gregory Casparian, was the first SF-themed novel to openly portray a lesbian romantic relationship. Pulp era (1920‚Äì30s) During the pulp era, explicit sexuality of any kind was rare in genre science fiction and fantasy. For many years, the editors who controlled what was published felt that they had to protect the adolescent male readership that they identified as their principal market. Although the covers of some 1930s pulp magazines showed scantily clad women menaced by tentacled aliens, the covers were often more lurid than the magazines' contents. In such a context, writers like Edgar Pangborn, who featured passionate male friendships in his work, were exceptional; almost until the end of their careers, including so much as a kiss would have been too much. Implied or disguised sexuality was as important as that which was openly revealed. As such, genre SF reflected the social mores of the day, paralleling common prejudices; This was particularly true of pulp fiction, more so than literary works of the time. As the demographics of the readership broadened, it became possible to include characters who were more or less undisguised homosexuals, but these, in accordance with the attitudes of the times, tended to be villains: evil, demented, or effeminate stereotypes. The most popular role for the homosexual was as a 'decadent slaveholding lordling' whose corrupt tyranny was doomed to be overthrown by the young male heterosexual hero. During this period, lesbians were almost entirely unrepresented as either heroes or villains. One of the earliest examples of genre science fiction that involves a challenging amount of unconventional sexual activity is the early novel Odd John (1935), by Olaf Stapledon. John is a mutant with extraordinary mental abilities who will not allow himself to be bound by many of the rules imposed by the ordinary British society of his time. The novel strongly implies that he seduces an older boy who becomes devoted to him but also suffers from the affront that the relationship creates to his own morals.Garber & Paleo, \\"Odd John\\" p. 127 Golden Age (1940‚Äì50s) In the Golden Age of Science Fiction, the genre \\"resolutely ignored the whole subject\\" of homosexuality, according to Joanna Russ.Joanna Russ, Introduction to Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, p xxii, Ed. Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo G K Hall: 1983 As the readership for science fiction and fantasy began to age in the 1950s, however, writers like Philip Jose Farmer and Theodore Sturgeon were able to introduce more explicit sexuality into their work. Until the late 1960s, however, few other writers depicted alternative sexuality or revised gender roles, or openly investigated sexual questions. The majority of LGBT characters were depicted as caricatures, such as \\"man- hating amazons\\", and attempts at portraying homosexuals sympathetically or non-stereotypically were met with hostility. Sturgeon wrote many stories during the Golden Age of Science Fiction that emphasised the importance of love, regardless of the current social norms. In his short story \\"The World Well Lost\\" (1953), first published in Universe magazine, homosexual alien fugitives and unrequited (and taboo) human homosexual love are portrayed. The tagline for the Universe cover was \\"[His] most daring story\\"; its sensitive treatment of homosexuality was unusual for science fiction published at that time, and it is now regarded as a milestone in science fiction's portrayal of homosexuality.Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, p 130, G K Hall: 1983 According to an anecdote related by Samuel R. Delany, when Sturgeon first submitted the story, the editor (Haywood Braun) not only rejected it but phoned every other editor he knew and urged them to reject it as well.Samuel R. Delany, Introduction to Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, p xviii, Ed. Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo G K Hall: 1983 Pearson, Hollinger & Gordon, p. 56 Sturgeon would later write Affair with a Green Monkey, which examined social stereotyping of homosexuals, and in 1960 published Venus Plus X, in which a single-gender society is depicted and the protagonist's homophobia portrayed unfavourably. Images of homosexual male societies remained strongly negative in the eyes of most SF authors. For example, when overpopulation drives the world away from heterosexuality in Charles Beaumont's short story \\"The Crooked Man\\" (1955), first published in Playboy, inhumane homosexuals begin to oppress the heterosexual minority. In Anthony Burgess's The Wanting Seed (1962) homosexuality is required for official employment; Burgess treats this as one aspect of an unnatural state of affairs which includes violent warfare and the failing of the natural world. Although not usually identified as a genre writer, William S. Burroughs produced works with a surreal narrative that estranged the action from the ordinary world as science fiction and fantasy do. In 1959 he published Naked Lunch, the first of many works such as The Nova Trilogy and The Wild Boys in which he linked drug use and homosexuality as anti-authoritarian activities. New Wave era (1960‚Äì70s) By the late 1960s, science fiction and fantasy began to reflect the changes prompted by the civil rights movement and the emergence of a counterculture. Within the genres, these changes were incorporated into a movement called \\"the New Wave,\\" a movement more sceptical of technology, more liberated socially, and more interested in stylistic experimentation.Marchesani, p. 3 New Wave writers were more likely to claim an interest in \\"inner space\\" instead of outer space. They were less shy about explicit sexuality and more sympathetic to reconsiderations of gender roles and the social status of sexual minorities. Under the influence of New Wave editors and authors such as Michael Moorcock (editor of the influential New Worlds), sympathetic depictions of alternative sexuality and gender multiplied in science fiction and fantasy, becoming commonplace.Dynes, Johansson, Percy & Donaldson, p. 752, \\"Science Fiction\\" The introduction of gay imagery has also been attributed to the influence of lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements in the 1960s.Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, \\"Preface\\" p. x G K Hall: 1983 In the 1970s, lesbians and gay men became a more visible presence in the SF community and as writers; notable gay authors included Joanna Russ, Thomas M. Disch and Samuel R. Delany.Justine Larbalestier Ed., Daughters of Earth: Feminist Science Fiction in the Twentieth Century, \\"Simians, Cyborgs and Women\\", Joan Haran, p. 245 Feminist SF authors imagined cultures in which homo- and bisexuality and a variety of gender models were the norm. Joanna Russ's The Female Man (1975) and the award-winning story \\"When It Changed\\", showing a female-only lesbian society that flourished without men, were enormously influential. Russ is largely responsible for introducing radical lesbian feminism into science fiction;Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, \\"Joanna Russ\\", p. 118, G K Hall: 1983 she has stated that being openly lesbian was bad for her career and sales. Similar themes are explored in James Tiptree Jr.'s award-winning \\"Houston, Houston, Do You Read?\\", which presents a female-only society after the extinction of men from disease. The society lacks stereotypically \\"male\\" problems such as war, but is stagnant. The women reproduce via cloning and consider men to be comical. Tiptree was a closeted bisexual woman writing secretly under a male pseudonym,Alice Sheldon was bisexual. \\"I like some men a lot, but from the start, before I knew anything, it was always girls and women who lit me up.\\" Julie Phillips, James Tiptree, Jr.: The Double Life of Alice B. Sheldon, St. Martin's PressHoustonvoice.com and explored the sexual impulse as her main theme. Other feminist utopias do not include lesbianism: Ursula K. Le Guin's The Left Hand of Darkness (1969) depicts trans-species sexuality, in which individuals are neither \\"male\\" nor \\"female\\" but can have both male and female sexual organs and reproductive abilities, making them in some senses bisexual. In The Language of the Night, a collection of Le Guin's criticism, she admits to having \\"quite unnecessarily locked the Gethenians into heterosexuality ... the omission [of the homosexual option] implies that sexuality is heterosexuality. I regret this very much.\\" Le Guin often explores alternative sexuality in her works,Garber & Paleo, \\"Ursula K Le Guin: Biographical note\\" p. 78 and has subsequently written many stories that examine the possibilities SF allows for non-traditional homosexuality, such as the bisexual bonding between clones in \\"Nine Lives\\".Garber & Paleo, \\"Nine Lives\\" p. 77 Sexual themes and fluid genders also figure in the works of John Varley, who came to prominence in the 1970s. Many of his stories contain mentions of same-sex love and gay and lesbian characters.Garber & Paleo, \\"John Verley: Biographical note\\" p. 140 In his \\"Eight Worlds\\" suite of stories and novels, humanity has achieved the ability to change sex on a whim. Homophobia is shown to initially inhibit uptake of this technology, as in his story \\"Options\\", as it engenders drastic changes in relationships, with bisexuality eventually becoming the norm for society.Garber & Paleo, \\"Options\\" p. 139 His Gaea trilogy features lesbian protagonists, and almost all the characters are to some degree bisexual.Garber & Paleo, \\"Titan\\" p. 140 Samuel R. Delany was one of the first openly gay science fiction authors;M. Keith Booker, Encyclopedia of Literature and Politics: Censorship, Revolution, and Writing, \\"Science Fiction\\" p. 639, 2005, Greenwood Publishing Group, in his earliest stories the gay sexual aspect appears as a \\"sensibility\\", rather than in overt sexual references. In some stories, such as Babel-17 (1966), same-sex love and same-sex intercourse are clearly implied but are given a kind of protective colouration because the protagonist is a woman who is involved in a three- person marriage with two men. The affection all three characters share for each other is in the forefront, and sexual activity between or among them is not directly described. In Dhalgren (1975), his most famous science fiction novel, Delany peoples his large canvas with characters of a wide variety of sexualities.David Soyko, \\"Dhalgren\\", on-line review (2002) SFSite Once again, sexual activity is not the focus of the novel although there are some of the first explicitly described scenes of gay sex in SF and Delany depicts characters with a wide variety of motivations and behaviours.David Seed Ed., A Companion to Science Fiction, \\"Samuel Delany\\" p. 403, Delany's Nebula-winning short story \\"Aye, and Gomorrah\\" posits the development of neutered human astronauts and then depicts the people who become sexually oriented toward them. By imagining a new gender and resultant sexual orientation, the story allows readers to reflect on the real world while maintaining an estranging distance. Further award-winning stories featuring gay characters, such as \\"Time Considered as a Helix of Semi-Precious Stones\\", were to follow, all collected in Delany's short story retrospective Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories. Delany faced censorship from book distribution companies for treatment of these topics. In later works, gay themes become increasingly central to Delany's works, attracting controversy,David Seed Ed., A Companion to Science Fiction, \\"Samuel Delany\\" p. 404, and some blur the line between science fiction and gay pornography.Delany describes The Mad Man, for example, as a \\"pornotopic fantasy\\". Delany's SF series Return to Neveryon was the first novel from a major US publisher to deal with the impact of AIDS,Ga√©tan Brulotte & John Phillips,Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature', p.324, CRC Press, 2006, and he later won the William Whitehead Memorial Award for lifetime achievement in gay and lesbian writing.David Seed Ed., A Companion to Science Fiction, \\"Samuel Delany\\" p. 399, His most recent gay-themed novel is Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders. Other big name SF authors approached LGBT themes in individual works: In Time Enough for Love (1973) by Robert A. Heinlein, the main character argues strongly for the future liberty of homosexual sex, but sex for the purpose of procreation remains held as the ideal.Garber & Paleo, \\"Time Enough for Love\\" p. 61 The female bisexuality in Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) has been described as mere titillation and male homosexuality in the same work was a \\"wrongness\\" deserving pity.Garber & Paleo, \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" p. 61 Heinlein's use of sexuality is discussed in an essay entitled \\"The Embarrassments of Science Fiction\\" by SF writer Thomas Disch.Peter Nicholls, Science Fiction at Large, \\"Thomas Disch\\", \\"The Embarrassments of Science Fiction\\", Harper & Row: 1976 ISBN Disch was publicly gay from 1968; this came out occasionally in his poetry and particularly in his novel On Wings of Song (1979). His other major SF novels also contained bisexual characters: in his mosaic novel 334, gay people are referred to as \\"republicans\\" in contrast to the straight \\"democrats\\". However, he did not try to write to a particular community: \\"I'm gay myself, but I don't write 'gay' literature.\\" Michael Moorcock was one of the first scifi authors to depict positive portrayals of homosexual, lesbian and bisexual relationships and sex in his novels. For example, in his 1965 novel, The Final Programme, most of the leading characters, including the central 'hero' Jerry Cornelius, engage in same sex relationships on multiple occasions and same sex relationships are depicted as entirely normal and without any moralising, negative consequences or gratuitous titillation, this is the case in the whole Jerry Cornelius series and in Moorcock's fiction generally (particularly in the Dancers at the End of Time series) sexuality is seen as polymorphic and fluid rather than based in fixed identities and gender roles. Elizabeth Lynn is an openly lesbian science fiction and fantasy writer who has written numerous works featuring positive gay protagonists.Garber & Paleo, \\"Elizabeth A. Lynn: Biographical note\\" p. 84 Her Chronicles of Tornor novels (1979‚Äì80), the first of which won the World Fantasy Award, were among the first fantasy novels to have gay relationships as an unremarkable part of the cultural background, and included explicit and sympathetic depictions of same-sex love;Garber & Paleo, \\"A different light\\" p. 83 the third novel is of particular lesbian interest. Her SF novel A Different Light (1978) featured a same-sex relationship between two men,Garber & Paleo, \\"The Dancers of Arun\\" p. 83 and inspired the name of the LGBT bookstore and chain \\"A Different Light\\". The \\"magical lesbian tale\\" \\"The Woman Who Loved the Moon\\" also won a World Fantasy Award and is the title story in the Lynn's The Woman Who Loved the Moon, a collection also containing other gay speculative fiction stories.Garber & Paleo, \\"The Woman Who Loved the Moon\\", \\"The Man Who Was Pregnant\\", \\"Jubilees's Story\\" \\"The White King's Dream\\" p. 83 Modern SF (post New Wave) After the pushing back of boundaries in the 1960s and 1970s, homosexuality gained much wider tolerance, and was often incorporated into otherwise conventional SF stories with little comment. This was helped by the growing number of openly gay or lesbian authors, such as David Gerrold, Geoff Ryman, Nicola Griffith and Melissa Scott, and transgender writers such as Jessica Amanda Salmonson,Thomas M. Disch, The Dreams Our Stuff is Made Of: How Science Fiction Conquered the World, Simon and Schuster, 2000, page 134. an author who chronicled the progress of her gender change in the pages of The Literary Magazine of Fantasy and Terror.John Clute and John Grant, \\"Salmonson, Jessica Amanda,\\" The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, Macmillan 1997, p. 832; . In the 1980s, blatant homophobia was no longer considered acceptable to most readers. However, depictions of unrealistic lesbians continue to propagate for the titillation of straight men in genre works.Joanna Russ, Introduction to Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, p xxiii, Ed. Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo G K Hall: 1983 . In the 1990s, stories depicting alternative sexualities experienced a resurgence.Wendy Pearson (March 1999), Identifying the Alien: Science Fiction meets its Other Science Fiction Studies, volume 26, Part 1, No. 77 Uranian Worlds, by Eric Garber and Lyn Paleo, was compiled in 1983 and is an authoritative guide to science fiction literature featuring gay, lesbian, transgender, and related themes. The book covers science fiction literature published before 1990 (2nd edition, 1990), providing a short review and commentary on each piece.Eric Garber, Lyn Paleo Uranian Worlds: A Guide to Alternative Sexuality in Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Horror, 2nd Edition, G K Hall: 1990 Pearson, Hollinger & Groden, p.7 In Lois McMaster Bujold's Ethan of Athos (1986), the titular \\"unlikely hero\\" is gay obstetrician Dr. Ethan Urquhart of the single-gender world Athos, whose dangerous adventure alongside the first woman he has ever met presents both a future society where homosexuality is the norm and the lingering sexism and homophobia of our own world. Cyberpunk, a genre arising in the mid-1980s, has been seen as heteronormative and masculine to a large extent, although feminist and \\"queer\\" interpretations are mooted by some critics.Pearson, Hollinger & Gordon, p. 9Pearson, Hollinger & Gordon, p. 121 Melissa Scott, a lesbian writer, has written several cyberpunk works that prominently feature LGBT characters, including Lambda-award-winning Trouble and Her Friends (1994) and Shadow Man (1995), the latter having also been inducted into the Gaylactic Spectrum Hall of Fame. Scott has reported that reviewers called some of these works \\"too gay\\" for mixing cyberpunk clich√©s with political themes. Many of Scott's other SF works also contain LGBT themes; she said that she chooses to write about gay themes using SF because these genres allow her to explore situations in which LGBT people are treated better or worse than in reality, and that it also gives an estranging distance for readers averse to such themes, who might otherwise feel accused of similar discriminatory practices as those in the books. A number of LGBT-themed anthologies of speculative short fiction have been published since the 1980s, the first being the science fiction-themed Kindred Spirits (1984), edited by Jeffrey M. Elliot. These anthologies often focus on particular sexual identities, such as the New Exploits of Lesbians series with titles in the fantasy (Magical lesbians, Fairy-tale lesbians) and horror (Twilight lesbians) areas. Others are grouped around particular genres, such as the award-winning Bending the Landscape series edited by Nicola Griffith and Stephen Pagel, in which each of the three volumes focus upon science fiction, fantasy or horror; or the horror-oriented Queer Fear anthologies, edited by Michael Rowe. Gay characters became common enough that Diana Wynne Jones' The Tough Guide to Fantasyland contains an entry on gay mages as a fantasy clich√©.Diana Wynne Jones. The Tough Guide To Fantasyland. DAW (December 1, 1998). Such characters are found in Mercedes Lackey's works, such as the Lambda award- winning The Last Herald Mage trilogy (1989), in which the protagonists are gay and have magical powers. Their relationships are an integral part of the story, which takes places in the fictional country of Valdemar. Much of the extended series provides non-heterosexual role-models for younger readers.Clute & Grant, \\"Mercedes (Ritchie) Lackey\\", p. 554 David Gerrold is an openly gay science fiction writer with a number of LGBT-themed works. The Man Who Folded Himself (1973) examines the narcissistic love of a time-traveler who has gay orgies with alternate versions of himself, including female and lesbian versions. Gerrold's multi-award-winning Jumping Off the Planet (2000) is the first book in a young adult series, in which a father kidnaps his three sons and goes to the moon; one son is gay, and rejected from college as he is ineligible for a scholarship available to straight people who agree to have their sexual orientation changed to prevent overpopulation. Gerrold received a Nebula Award for a semi-autobiographical short story \\"The Martian Child\\" (1994), in which a gay man adopts a child. The story was later expanded to book length, and a feature film was produced in which the protagonist was straight, causing criticism.Why the Martian Child's Daddy Isn't Gay , May 8, 2007, blog entry from co-producer of Martian Child feature film Geoff Ryman wrote several award-winning novels and short stories that prominently feature LGBT characters: The protagonist of The Child Garden (1989), an outsider because of her resistance to genetic manipulation and her lesbianism, enters into a relationship with a similarly outcast lesbian polar bear. Lust (2001) follows a gay man who finds that his sexual fantasies are magically coming true. Was (1992) includes a gay actor with AIDS and a mentally challenged abused child, linked by their connection to The Wizard of Oz books and film.Damien Broderick, Transrealist fiction: Writing in the Slipstream of Science, p.92 In a Locus magazine interview Ryman claimed that the gay and SF genre markets are incompatible: ‚ÄúIn 1990, if you had asked me which was the worst thing to be labeled as, gay or an SF writer, I'd have said gay: kills you stone-dead in the market. Then Was came out.... They had it in the gay section of bookstores and they had stuff in gay magazines, but they didn't say SF ‚Äî at which point I realized that being a science fiction writer is worse than being gay.\\" 21st century Larissa Lai's novel Salt Fish Girl (2002) depicts lesbian relationships in the context of a dystopian corporate future. The novel features Asian-Canadian characters in these lesbian relationships, incorporating racial and ethnic identity into a queer understanding of speculative fiction. Salt Fish Girl engages queer ideas in regards to procreation and bodies, as characters are able to give birth without sperm by eating the durian fruit. It was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. award in 2002. Elizabeth Bear's Carnival (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, as a pair of gay male ambassador-spies attempt to infiltrate and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps telling of the evolution of public perception of same sex relationships that the relationships are unmentioned or only peripherally noted in reviews. Rafael Grugman dystopian novel Nontraditional Love (2008) describes the twenty-third century. USA. The world is homosexual. The author describes an inverted world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden. Conception occurs in test tubes. In lesbian families, one of the women carries the child. Gay male couples turn to surrogate mothers to bring their children to term. The Netherlands is the only country where mixed-sex marriages are permitted. In this world intimacy between the opposite sexes is rejected, world history and the classics of world literature have been falsified in order to support the ideology of the homosexual world. The author paints a grotesque situation, but underlying this story is the idea that society should be tolerant and accepting and respect the right of every person to be themselves. Reviewing the field of lesbian romance speculative fiction in 2012, Liz Bourke concluded that it remained a niche subgenre of uneven quality, but mentioned Jane Fletcher, Chris Anne Wolfe, Barbara Ann Wright, Sandra Barret and Ruth Diaz as contributors of note. More recently in Rick Riordan's 2013 teen-fantasy novel The House of Hades, character Nico di Angelo professes romantic feelings for protagonist Percy Jackson. In terms of gender identity, Kim Stanley Robinson's 2012 novel 2312 depicts a world of fluid gender, where \\"self-images for gender\\" include feminine, masculine, androgynous, gyandromorphous, hermaphrodite, ambisexual, bisexual, intersex, neuter, eunuch, nonsexual, undifferentiated, gay, lesbian, queer, invert, homosexual, polymorphous, poly, labile, berdache, hijra, and two-spirit. In 2013, Natasja Hellenthal's lesbian fantasy debut novel The Queen's Curse became an Amazon best-seller, and in her The Comyenti Series the main female character is bisexual and falls in love with a lesbian character. The comyentis are a supernatural/paranormal bisexual species. Ellen Kushner's mannerpunk Swordspoint series of novels feature homosexual and bisexual protagonists in the 18th century fantasy world of Riverside. It spawned Swordspoint: Tremontaine, a thirteen part \\"Fantasy of Manners\\" written by a variety of authors. The audiobooks of Swordspoint won the 2013 Audie Award for Best Audio Drama, the Earphones Award from AudioFile Magazine, and the 2013 Communicator Award: Gold Award of Excellence (Audio). The Swordspoint sequel The Fall of the Kings, written with Kushner's wife Delia Sherman, won the 2014 Wilbur Award. Within the realm of tie-in speculative fiction, there was also an increase in LGBT representation. In particular, from 2001 onwards there was a concerted effort to explore this in licensed Star Trek literature.For a list of LGBT characters in Star Trek fiction begun in 2009, see http://www.trekbbs.com/threads/lgbt-characters-in-trek-help-and-no-flames- please.87663/ In the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine relaunch, the post-series novels following the end of the eponymous television series, a passing line in one series to a certain species, the Andorians, marrying in fours allowed the exploration of a quatri-gendered species, who partnered in broadly two 'male' and two 'female' species. Andrew J. Robinson's Garak novel, A Stitch in Time, suggested the omnisexuality of his character, which was followed up in subsequent novels, in particular Una McCormack's 2014 novel, The Crimson Shadow.In particular, suggested by the Epilogue of the novel, where Garak and his friend, Dr Parmak, embrace. https://books.google.com/books?id=PzAGDNZ0ip4C&lpg;=PP1&pg;=PA319#v=onepage In the original series Star Trek: Vanguard, created by Marco Palmieri and David Alan Mack, two of the main characters were a lesbian Vulcan officer and a lesbian Klingon intelligence agent.For details on this, see the series bible and addendum at the author's website, http://davidmack.pro/writing/storming- heaven/the-finale/ Sarah Waters is a Welsh author popular for lesbian romances in historical times, most often the Victorian Era. Popular works of hers include Tipping the Velvet (1998) and Fingersmith (2002). Comics and manga For much of the 20th century, gay relationships were discouraged from being shown in comics which were seen mainly as directed towards children. Until 1989, the Comics Code Authority (CCA), which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through news stands in the United States, forbade any suggestion of homosexuality. Artists had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character's orientation. Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA's seal of approval. The CCA came into being in response to Fredric Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent, in which comic book creators were accused of attempting to negatively influence children with images of violence and sexuality, including subliminal homosexuality. Wertham claimed Wonder Woman's strength and independence made her a lesbian,Wertham, Fredric (1954) Seduction of the Innocent, pp. 192 and 234‚Äì235, Rinehart & Company, Inc. and stated that \\"The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies.\\" In recent years the number of LGBT characters has increased greatly in mainstream superhero comics; however, LGBT characters continue to be relegated to supporting roles, and generate criticism for the treatment gay characters receive. Marvel Alpha Flight's Northstar was the first major gay character in the Marvel universe and remains the most famous gay character in mainstream comics. Created by Marvel Comics in 1979 as a member of the original Alpha Flight superhero team, Northstar's sexual identity was hinted at early in his history, in 1983 in issues 7 and 8 of Alpha Flight, but not openly stated; his apparent lack of interest in women was chalked up to his obsessive drive to win as a ski champion. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106 and his outing made national headlines. In 2002, Marvel Comics revived The Rawhide Kid in their Marvel MAX imprint, introducing the first openly gay comic book character to star in his own magazine. The first edition of the Rawhide Kid's gay saga was called Slap Leather. According to a CNN. com article, the character's sexuality is conveyed indirectly, through euphemisms and puns, and the comic's style is campy. Conservative groups quickly protested the gay take on the character and claimed that children would be corrupted by it, and the covers carried an \\"Adults only\\" label. Marvel's policy had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an \\"Adults Only\\" label, in response to conservative protests. But in 2006, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada claimed that this policy was no longer in force, and Marvel received GLAAD's 2005 Best Comic Book Award for its superhero comic book Young Avengers, which included gay characters but was published as a mainstream book with no warning label. In 2012, despite protests, Marvel published an issue of Astonishing X-Men in which Northstar married his partner, Kyle. DC DC often still draws criticism for its use of stereotypes for LGBT characters. Firebrand, a superhero debuting in 1941, is thought by some to be an early example, with his pink or transparent costume. Writer Roy Thomas penned thought balloons that suggested Firebrand had been involved in a gay relationship with his sidekick and bodyguard Slugger Dunn, although these hints never moved beyond subtext. A more modern example is the violent vigilante superhero Midnighter. The Batman-like Midnighter was shown as being in a relationship with the Superman-like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority. Midnighter and Apollo are now married and have an adopted daughter ‚Äì Midnighter has gone on to star in his own title. In 2006, DC Comics could still draw widespread media attention by announcing a new, lesbian incarnation of the well-known character Batwoman, even though openly lesbian minor characters such as Gotham City police officer Renee Montoya already existed in the franchise. Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson. Panel from Batman No. 84 (June 1954), page 24. In addition to true LGBT characters, there has been controversy over various homosexual interpretations of the most famous superhero comic book characters. Batman's relationship with Robin has famously come under scrutiny, in spite of the majority of creators associated with the creator denying that the character is gay. Psychologist Fredric Wertham, who in Seduction of the Innocent asserted that \\"Batman stories are psychologically homosexual\\", claimed to find a \\"subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature 'Batman' and his young friend 'Robin'\\".Wertham, Fredric. Seduction of the Innocent. Rinehart and Company, Inc., 1954. pg. 189‚Äì90 It has also been claimed that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because \\"he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality,\\" and \\"the 1960s TV series remains a touchstone of camp.\\"Medhurst, Andy. \\"Batman, Deviance, and Camp.\\" The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media. Routledge: London, 1991. , pg. 150 Frank Miller has described the relationship between Batman and the Joker as a \\"homophobic nightmare\\",Sharrett, Christopher. \\"Batman and the Twilight of the Idols: An Interview with Frank Miller.\\" The Many Lives of the Batman: Critical Approaches to a Superhero and His Media. Routledge: London, 1991. , pp. 37‚Äì38 he views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting. Some continue to play off the homosexual interpretations of Batman. One notable example occurred in 2000, when DC Comics refused to allow permission for the reprinting of four panels (from Batman #79, 92, 105 and 139) to illustrate Christopher York's paper All in the Family: Homophobia and Batman Comics in the 1950s. Another happened in the summer of 2005, when painter Mark Chamberlain displayed a number of watercolors depicting both Batman and Robin in suggestive and sexually explicit poses. DC threatened both artist and the Kathleen Cullen Fine Arts gallery with legal action if they did not cease selling the works and demanded all remaining art, as well as any profits derived from them. Many of DC's gay characters, such as Obsidian and Renee Montoya, were changed or essentially erased in The New 52 reboot of 2011. Meanwhile, others, such as Kate Kane, were given far less attention than before the reboot. In 2012 DC announced that an \\"iconic\\" character would now be gay in the new DC universe. It was then revealed that Alan Scott, the original Green Lantern was that character. This led to fan outcry because his status as \\"iconic\\" is debatable, and he does not actually exist in the mainstream DC universe. This also effectively meant that the already gay character, Obsidian, could not exist as he was Alan Scott's child. Manga Yaoi and Yuri (also known as Boys' Love and Girls' Love, respectively, as well as Sh≈çnen-ai and Sh≈çjo-ai in the West, although these are not used in Japan due to pedophilic undertones) are Japanese genres which have homosexual romance themes, across a variety of media. Yaoi and yuri have spread beyond Japan: both translated and original yaoi and yuri is now available in many countries and languages. The characters of yaoi and yuri do not tend to self- identify as homosexual or bisexual.McLelland, Mark. Why are Japanese Girls' Comics full of Boys Bonking? Refractory: A Journal of Entertainment Media Vol. 10, 2006/2007Lees, Sharon (June 2006). \\"Yaoi and Boys Love\\" . Akiba Angels. As with much manga and anime, SF and fantasy tropes and environments are common: For example, Ai no Kusabi, a 1980s yaoi light novel series described as a \\"magnum opus\\" of the Boys Love genre,Drazen, Patrick (October 2002). '\\"A Very Pure Thing\\": Gay and Pseudo-Gay Themes' in Anime Explosion! The What, Why & Wow of Japanese Animation Berkeley, California: Stone Bridge Press pp.95‚Äì97 . involves a science fictional caste system. Simoun has been described as being \\"a wonderful sci fi series\\" which does not have to rely on its yuri content to appeal to the audience. Yaoi has been criticised for stereotypical and homophobic portrayals of its characters,Lunsing, Wim.

There is also a style of manga called Bara, which is typically written by gay men for a gay male adult audience. Bara often has more realistic themes than yaoi and is more likely to acknowledge homophobia and the taboo nature of homosexuality in Japan. While western commentators sometimes group bara and yaoi together, writers and fans consider them separate genres. Film and television In general, speculative fiction on television and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality. Sexual relationships in major speculative fiction franchises have generally been depicted as heterosexual in nature. Inter-species and inter-ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted, while homosexual relationships and transgender characters are more rare. Film LGBT characters in films began to appear more regularly only in the 1980s. Films in the late 1920s and early 1930s reflected the liberal attitudes of the day and could include sexual innuendos and references to homosexuality, but from the 1930s until 1968 the film industry in the US followed the Production Code. The code spelled out what was morally acceptable for a public audience; references to sexual \\"perversions\\" such as homosexuality were forbidden. Virtually all motion pictures produced in the United States adhered to the code,Doherty, Thomas \\"The Code Before 'Da Vinci'\\" Washington Post (May 20, 2006) and similar censorship was common in other countries, for example an early version of the first lesbian vampire film Dracula's Daughter, a film described in The Celluloid Closet as presenting \\"homosexuality as a predatory weakness\\", was rejected by the British Board of Film Censors in 1935, who said in part \\"...Dracula's Daughter would require half a dozen ... languages to adequately express its beastliness.\\". Horror author Anne Rice has named Dracula's Daughter as a direct inspiration for her own homoerotic vampire fiction, naming a bar in her novel Queen of the Damned \\"Dracula's Daughter\\" in honor of the film. Films produced under such censorship could only introduce homosexuality as a disguised undercurrent, and still flirted with controversy in doing so, such as in the cult horror film White Zombie. The less stringent rules of the post-Hayes film industry allowed sexuality to be more open, and cinema as a whole became more sexually explicit from the 1980s in particular, but aimed to purely to entertain rather than exploring underlying sexual dynamics. Much of the sex in speculative fiction film is merely intended to titillate; a review of fantasy films identified 10‚Äì15% as softcore pornography.Clute & Grant, p.xxx, \\"Pornography\\" but it remained rare to see gay characters in speculative fiction films. Horror films, that had sex as one of their major preoccupations, continued to be more leniently censored, due to the perception of being unserious and lightweight. Vampires in particular have been described as obvious erotic metaphors and as a result, numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly imply or explicitly show lesbianism, following the inspiration of lesbian vampire story Carmilla. The prototypical Hollywood vampire, Dracula, was shown to be openly gay in the spoof film Does Dracula Suck? in 1969. Gay genre films remain rare,The Year in Gay Movies, AfterElton.com and science fiction films' inclusion of gay characters continues to relegate them to supporting roles, such as the \\"stereotypical, limp-wristed, frantic homosexual\\" minor character played by Harvey Fierstein in the 1996 blockbuster Independence Day, a film whose main theme has been described as being the anxiety surrounding male friendships and homosexual panic. It is also interesting to note that the film's director, Roland Emmerich, is openly gay. Still there are some curious cases like Cthulhu (2007) a horror/thriller film based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft, in which the main character is gay but it isn't the main thing, although it is important in the development of the character's psychology. The film is plagued with monsters and disturbing happenings. Also, in V for Vendetta there are two secondary characters ‚Äì one gay, one lesbian ‚Äì shown as victims of the totalitarian dystopia. 2012 saw the light of the epic Wachowskis + Tom Tykwer blockbuster, Cloud Atlas, featuring in one of the six stories a couple of gay characters. Television LGBT characters began appearing on television with increasing frequency only in the 1990s. The 1994 television science fiction show, Babylon 5 introduced a bisexual character, Susan Ivanova whose relationship with a fellow female telepath was revealed in season 2 (1995). Advocate magazine called this relationship out as the closest that the Star Trek franchise or any \\"Star Trek clone,\\" as he called the show, had come to a \\"gay creature‚Äîmuch less a gay human being.\\" Babylon 5 continued to explore the state of same-sex relationships in the future with the introduction of a male- male marriage and subsequent honeymoon as cover for two of the main characters who were on a covert mission to a Mars colony in season 4. The Xena: Warrior Princess fantasy television series introduced its main characters, Xena and Gabrielle, as close companions; fan speculation about lesbian overtones led to them becoming lesbian icons, although the lesbian content remained at the subtext level. The series has been cited as \\"trail-blazing\\" and breaking down barriers, allowing the production of subsequent programming such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which introduced a number of LGBT characters. The most famous is the major character, Willow and her partners Tara and Kennedy. Although praised for their \\"healthy relationship\\" and being the first lesbian relationship between major characters on prime-time television, others criticised the use of witchcraft as a metaphor for lesbian sex. Tara's death directly after reconciliatory sex with Willow caused an outcry among the LGBT community, who saw it as a \\"homophobic clich√©\\". Andrew Wells, a recurring villain and eventual ally, was strongly implied to be gay, although closeted. The series was influential on subsequent television speculative fiction, including Torchwood. The series won a number of LGBT themed awards, and was regarded as groundbreaking in its portrayal of gay youth. Torchwood is a British science fiction drama television programme, part of the long-running Doctor Who franchise, which began airing in 2006 on BBC Three. The series explores several themes in its narrative, in particular LGBT themes. Various characters are portrayed as sexually fluid; through those characters, the series examines homosexual and bisexual relationships. Although the nature of their sexual flexibility is not explicitly discussed, the characters offer varying perspectives on orientation, Series creator Russell T Davies said that he hoped to defy audience expectations of monosexual characters: \\"Without making it political or dull, this is going to be a very bisexual programme. I want to knock down the barriers so we can't define which of the characters is gay. We need to start mixing things up, rather than thinking, 'This is a gay character and he'll only ever go off with men.'\\" Davies has also described Jack Harkness as omnisexual: \\"He'll shag anything with a hole. Jack doesn't categorise people: if he fancies you, he'll do it with you.\\" The inclusion of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series has not been universal. For example, the Star Trek franchise's lack of same- sex relationships has long been a sore spot with LGBT fandom, some of whom have organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters. They also point out that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in Star Trek, but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre. Within the Star Trek canon, there had been little LGBT representation until Star Trek: Discovery in 2017. The International Review of Science Fiction ran a feature entitled \\"Prisoners of Dogma and Prejudice: Why There Are no G/L/B/T Characters in Star Trek: Deep Space 9\\" However, gender identity has occasionally been treated as an \\"issue\\" within the new Star Trek series, to be dealt with as a theme in individual episodes, such as the 1995 Star Trek: Deep Space Nine episode \\"Rejoined\\", which was the first episode of the show to feature a same-sex relationship and romantic same-sex kiss between women. Subsequently, the Star Trek franchise has portrayed a few same-sex kisses, but always in the context of either the evil \\"mirror universe\\" (\\"The Emperor's New Cloak\\") or body possession (\\"Warlord\\" and others). In a 2000 Fandom interview, Star Trek screenwriter Ronald D. Moore suggested that the reason why no gay characters existed in the television franchise was because someone wanted it that way, and no amount of support from fans, cast or crew was going to make any difference.Frank Statements by Ronald D. Moore In recent years, a few of the Star Trek novels and comics, which are officially licensed but not considered canon, have featured serious direct same-sex relationships, including portraying a minor canon character as gay. In 2005 the television series Dante's Cove premiered on the here! cable station. The series included both gay and lesbian couples dealing with supernatural situations in the coastal town of the same name. The following year, Syfy premiered the series Eureka. The series spotlighted a fictional town in Oregon that consisted almost entirely of geniuses. This included the town's caf√© owner Vincent, who also happened to be gay. HBO brought then new series True Blood to the forefront of gay genre television, introducing a variety of omnisexual characters to the small screen in 2008 including: Lafayette Reynolds (played by Nelsan Ellis), Jesus Velasquez (played by Kevin Alejandro), Tara Thornton (played by Rutina Wesley), Pam Swynford De Beaufort (played by Kristin Bauer van Straten), Eddie Gauthier (played by Stephen Root), Russell Edgington (played by Denis O'Hare), and Rev. Steve Newlin (played by Michael McMillian). Stargate Universe in 2009 became the first space-based science fiction show to feature an openly gay character in its primary cast, which was \\"Camille Wray\\" played by Ming-Na. \\"Wray\\" was also the first gay character in the franchise and the first primary lesbian Asian-American character on primetime television. Wray's storyline featured a committed long-term relationship with her Earth-bound partner Sharon (played by Reiko Aylesworth), the lifelike portrayal of which was very positively received by the lesbian community and press. Stargate Universe was cancelled after a two-season run. In 2009 the series Warehouse 13 premiered on the Syfy cable network. The series later introduced a character named Steve Jinks, played by actor Aaron Ashmore, a gay government agent assigned to assist in the containment of bizarre artifacts. In 2010 a cable series prequel to Battlestar Galactica was introduced titled Caprica. The series highlighted a world in which same-sex marriage was common. One of the central characters named Sam Adama, played by Sasha Roiz, had a husband named Larry, played by Julius Chapple. In 2011 the cable station Syfy premiered the series Being Human, an Americanized version of the previously released British series of the same name. A lesbian character named Emily Levison, played by actress Alison Louder, was introduced as the sister to one of the main characters. That same year the FX cable series American Horror Story highlighted gay ghost couple Chad Warwick and Patrick, played by Zachary Quinto and Teddy Sears. The HBO cable station premiered Game of Thrones, based on the book series of the same name. The series included gay couple Renly Baratheon and Loras Tyrell, played by actors Gethin Anthony and Finn Jones. MTV also premiered the cable series Teen Wolf that same year. One of the characters depicted is an out gay high school lacrosse player named Danny Mahealani, played by Keahu Kahuanui. Slash fiction The platonic close male relationships in television and film science fiction have been reinterpreted by fans as slash fiction ‚Äì Kirk/Spock being the earliest example.David Seed Ed., A Companion to Science Fiction, \\"Science Fiction/Criticism\\" p. 57, Slash cannot be commercially distributed due to copyright, and until the 1990s was either undistributed or published in zines.Decarnin, Camilla (2006) \\"Slash Fiction\\" in Ga√´tan Brulotte and John Phillips (eds.) Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature New York: Routledge, pp. 1233‚Äì1235. With the advent of the internet, the slash fiction community of fans and writers began to cluster at sites such as FanFiction.Net, and websites and fanzines dedicated to popular speculative fiction franchises such as X-files and Star Trek have become common. The use of characters from major SF franchises in \\"gay readings\\" has caused legal action: LucasFilm has sent cease and desist orders to prevent gay reinterpretations of Star Wars characters, and Anne Rice is notorious for attempts to stop production of slash fiction based on her Vampire Chronicles characters, although many of the characters are bisexual in canon. Slash fiction has been described as important to the LGBT community and the formation of queer identities, as it represents a resistance to the expectation of compulsory heterosexuality, but has also been noted as being unrepresentative of the gay community, being more a medium to express feminist dissatisfactions with SF. According to polls, most of slash fandom is made up of heterosexual women with a college degree. These demographics are older than the yaoi fans and they tend to be more easily disturbed about slash depicting underage sexuality, but this is becoming less true due to the popularity of Harry Potter-inspired slash fiction.McLelland, Mark. The World of Yaoi: The Internet, Censorship and the Global ‚ÄúBoys' Love‚Äù Fandom The Australian Feminist Law Journal, 2005. Femslash is a subgenre of slash fiction which focuses on romantic and/or sexual relationships between female fictional characters,Lo, Malinda. (January 4, 2006) Fan Fiction Comes Out of the Closet AfterEllen.com. Retrieved July 19, 2007. Typically, characters featured in femslash are heterosexual in the canon universe; however, similar fan fiction about lesbian characters are commonly labeled as femslash for convenience.Herzing, Melissa. (April 2005) The Internet World of Fan Fiction Virginia Commonwealth University. Retrieved August 12, 2007. There is less femslash than there is slash based on male couples ‚Äì it has been suggested that heterosexual female slash authors generally do not write femslash, and that it is rare to find a fandom with two sufficiently engaging female characters. Janeway/Seven is the main Star Trek femslash pairing, as only they have \\"an on-screen relationship fraught with deep emotional connection and conflict\\".http://j-l-r.org/asmic/fanfic/print/jlr-cyborgsex.pdf There is debate about whether fanfiction about canon lesbians such as Willow and Tara of Buffy the Vampire Slayer counts as \\"slash\\", their relationship storylines are more coy than heterosexual ones, which entices Willow/Tara femslash authors to fill in the gaps in the known relationship storyline. It is \\"relatively recently\\" that male writers have begun writing femslash. Reaction of the speculative fiction community There has been a long history of tolerance of LGBT people in SF fandom. The presence of gay members was noted by attendees of early conventions, but generally not discussed ‚Äî the idea that gay or lesbian members would seek recognition within the SF community was \\"unthinkable,\\" and an accusation in the 1940s by a fanzine editor that the Los Angeles Science Fiction Association was \\"full of gay members\\" caused a scandal in fan circles.Bacon-Smith, p.136 Prominent SF fan Forrest Ackerman is regarded as one of the first members of fandom to openly support the gay and lesbian movements. He was known for writing early lesbian fiction and aided in the publication of The Ladder, the journal of the recently formed lesbian group the Daughters of Bilitis. He claims the group named him an honorary lesbian for his support, and to have pseudonymously written the earliest work of \\"lesbian SF\\" in 1947 in Vice Versa, the lesbian fanzine edited by Lisa Ben. As the number of works featuring LGBT characters increased, so did the visibility of LGBT fans. At least as early as the 1980 Worldcon (Noreascon Two), there were gatherings of gay and gay-friendly members of the SF community, including Samuel R. Delany, Marion Zimmer Bradley and Melissa Scott.Bacon-Smith, p. 139 However, such meetings did not necessarily indicate whole-hearted acceptance within the fan community, and gay and lesbian fans were not regarded as a unified interest group. Informal gatherings at conferences and the attempted creation of a newsletter for LGBT fans drew little notice.Bacon-Smith, p. 140 Networking between gay fans continued, finally coalescing at the 1986 Worldcon into a plan of action. This led to the first Gaylaxicon science fiction convention being held in 1988 and subsequently to the creation of the Gaylactic Network and the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards by the science fiction community. Gay-themed discussions are now a staple at conventions such as WisCon; for example, WisCon 30 featured a panel discussing \\"Why Women Write About Gay Men\\", and the 38th World Science Fiction Convention in Boston had a discussion panel entitled \\"The Closed Open Mind ‚Äì Homophobia in Science Fiction and Fantasy Stories\\". Other SF authors, such as Orson Scott Card, have been criticised by the LGBT community for their works or opinions, which have been described as homophobic.\\"Orson Scott Card Draws Gay Protest\\", 'Science Fiction Chronicles 13(6), March 1992. Some lesbian science fiction is targeted specifically to a lesbian audience, rather than science fiction fans, and published by small feminist or lesbian fiction presses such as Bella Books, Bold Strokes Books, Ylva Publishing, Regal Crest Enterprises, Bedazzled Ink, Intaglio Publications, and Spinsters Ink. A notable author writing science fiction published by lesbian presses is Katherine V. Forrest. LGBT speculative fiction awards A number of awards exist that recognise works at the intersection of LGBT and speculative fiction: * The Gaylactic Spectrum Awards honour works in science fiction, fantasy and horror which include positive explorations of gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender characters, themes, or issues. The awards were instituted in 1999 and are given for best novel, short fiction and other works of the previous year. Works produced before the awards' inception are eligible for entry into the Hall of Fame. * The Lambda Literary Awards include awards for science fiction, fantasy and horror. The awards were first presented in 1989, with separate categories for speculative fiction for lesbians and gay men. In 1993 these categories were merged and the combined award has undergone several name changes since then. Although the awards are given based on the quality of the writing and the LGBT themes, the author's sexual orientation is also a factor. * The James Tiptree, Jr. Award honours works of science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore one's understanding of gender. Thus, it often goes to works which deal directly or tangentially with gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender issues. * Golden Crown Literary Society Awards (or \\"Goldies\\") are given to works containing lesbian themes or depictions of lesbian characters. Awards are given in numerous categories, including speculative fiction (or \\"SciFi/Fantasy/Horror\\") and paranormal romance.

It was founded during 1988 during the U.K's discovery of acid house. They were an organisation that staged acid house parties in empty industrial warehouses in London and within the M25 motorway area. \\"Over the course of 1989, promoters such as World Dance, Genesis, Helter Skelter and Energy succeeded in setting acid house nights free of the urban core's constructions, staging ever more elaborate Orbital parties in borrowed and rented fields, the odd warehouse, or some other similarly vacant structure\\".Clover, J. 1989: Bob Dylan didn't have this to sing about. p. 64 At that point in time acid house parties were deemed illegal by authorities because most promoters of the period gained entrance into buildings by breaking and entering. Overview and history Fuelled by the drug MDMA (Ecstasy), nightclub goers in London were desperate for events that catered to their needs and went on until the early hours of the morning. Genesis‚Äô88 found empty warehouses in London and transformed them into state- of-the-art dance arenas that consisted of professional lighting rigs, sound systems and colourful decorations. Unbeknownst to the buildings' owners the Genesis promoters would wear their best business suits and convince police riot squads that the warehouses were acquired through legitimate channels. Matthew Collin writes in Altered State: The Story of Ecstasy Culture and Acid House: \\"From their first party in October 1988 onwards, Genesis developed a prodigious reputation for cracking open huge warehouses and holding illegal raves, week after week, from Aldgate to Hackney, Tottenham to Walthamstow\\". Collin, M. ' Altered State: The Story of Ecstasy Culture and Acid House. p. 136. To give themselves more credit they would assume official titles such as George Michael‚Äôs personal manager or project manager for a major record company. Genesis enjoyed a succession of events that saw attendances rise from 300 to 15,000 people. Victims of their own success, Genesis were targeted by the UK government and the criminal underworld attracted by media articles of huge profits (¬£500,000) being made by such promoters. The Genesis organisers were kidnapped and threatened with death if they didn‚Äôt comply with the gangsters. They demanded 25% of all profits in return for 24-hour protection. This plight was shared by other promoters who had also encountered the same terror tactics.Collin, M. ' Altered State: The Story of Ecstasy Culture and Acid House. p. 142.

History Ernesto de la Guardia, a member of the Wagnerian Society of Buenos Aires, first proposed the creation of a national conservatory. He gained support from the president Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear and his wife Regina Pacini a noted soprano, the Conservatorio Nacional de M√∫sica y Declamaci√≥n (National Conservatory of Music and Recitation) was founded by Argentine musician Carlos L√≥pez Buchardo, among others, on July 7, 1924. Based upon the School of Lyric and Scenic Art held at the Teatro Col√≥n in Buenos Aires, the conservatory focused on both lyric and theatrical studies, providing instruction in composition, vocal and instrument music, recitation and speech. Carlos L√≥pez Buchardo became the first director and the first assistant director was . The conservatory began its operations at the Teatro Col√≥n. Within a few years, in 1930 the Conservatory relocated to the upper floors of the Teatro Nacional Cervantes. In 1928, renowned Russian prima ballerina, Elena Smirnova was hired as the first professor of dance of the Conservatory. In 1939, the name was changed to the Conservatorio Nacional de M√∫sica y Arte Esc√©nico (National Conservatory of Music and Performing Arts) and it was renamed again upon the death of Buchardo at the end of 1948. The conservatory was renamed to honor its first director, and has since been known as the Conservatorio Nacional de \\"Carlos L√≥pez Buchardo\\". In 1950, the Dance Department was split from the organization with the founding of the National School of Dance () and then between 1957 and 1958, the Theater Arts Department was separated from the Conservatory to create the National School of Theater (). Moving several times in the 1940s, by 1982, the Conservatory established its current location (2017) in the Palacio Rocca Avenida C√≥rdoba 2445. Modern organization The National Conservatoire was divided in 1989 into the present and independent Escuela Nacional de M√∫sica (basic and first levels) and the Conservatorio Nacional Superior de M√∫sica (middle and high levels). In 1995, the middle level of the National Conservatorium is assigned to the government of the city of Buenos Aires, which is in 1998 named Conservatorio de M√∫sica de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires.

Biography Susana Natividad Rinaldi was born to a wealthy father and a poor mother in Buenos Aires in 1935. Dubbed \\"La Tana\\" (in reference to her Italian origins), she spent her childhood moving throughout different provinces of Argentina. She began studying chamber singing at the National Conservatory of Music at age 14, and in 1955 she entered the School of Dramatic Art. Two years later, she made her television debut and in 1959 debuted on the stage. When she was asked to record a poetry concert in 1966 she offered them a tango album, and by the end of that year her first album, with music arranged by bandone√≥n virtuoso Roberto Pansera, was released. Her success over time prompted her to give up acting and to instead pursue a career as a singer. After touring Argentine tango bars and milongas, Rinaldi gained fame as a singer during the late 1960s. She called the attention of her audience by singing tangos which up to then had only been sung by men, including standards by Jos√© Mar√≠a Contursi, Enrique Santos Disc√©polo, Homero Manzi, and C√°tulo Castillo. This gave her a deserved reputation among a new audience made up mostly of young university students. She achieved fame when she incorporated into her repertoire songs by new authors, such as Eladia Bl√°zquez, Osvaldo Avena, H√©ctor Negro, and Chico Novarro. She and her husband, bandone√≥n virtuoso Osvaldo Piro, established Magoya, a caf√© concert in seaside Mar del Plata, in 1971. Following the March 1976 coup, however, Rinaldi was forced to leave the country. After a long stay in Paris, she returned to Argentina in 1989 with an innovative idea of a tango-show. Due to this, she was again rejected by traditional tango listeners, although she did become one of the main figures in the tango renewal movement of the time. An artist with a political conscience, she supported her ideals through music in international concert tours and as UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador since 1992. Her tireless defense of human rights and her passionate promotion of a more just and peaceful world earned her the title of Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires in 1990. Other distinctions earned during her lengthy career include the SADAIC Grand Prize in 1969 and 1999; and the Konex Award in 1985, 2001, and 2005.

Many more could exist as at least one sheet must have been printed, and possibly many sheets; however, they may all have been destroyed, or lie unrecognised in stamp collections or on cover. Background The Large Queens were the first issue by Canada; they are so- called to distinguish them from the 1870 issues (the \\"Small Queens\\") which are similar in appearance but physically smaller. The Large Queens were normally printed on wove paper, but the 1¬¢, 2¬¢, and 3¬¢ values were also printed on the less-desirable laid paper. The 1¬¢ and 3¬¢ on laid paper were long-known although uncommon. The Unitrade Specialized Catalogue of Canadian Stamps lists Scott number 32, the 2c Laid Paper Large Queen, at $250,000. The last auction price recorded is $247,500. First copy The stamp was first reported in 1925, although many authorities were dubious, and the Scott catalog did not list it until the 1930s. According to a 2014 BNA Topics First Quarter article by Glenn Archer, the second known example bears a two-ring 5 numeral cancel and was discovered in 1935 in the estate of English stamp dealer JW Westhorpe. According to an 18 November 1971 Globe and Mail article by Douglas Patrick, this example sold for $25,000 to New York dealer Robert Lyman, in the J.N. Sissons' Firth collection auction. In 1986, Vancouver stamp dealer Daniel Eaton acquired this 2c Laid Paper from Stanley Gibbons in London and sold it to Los Angeles stamp dealer George Holschauer for $90,000. The 1971 Globe and Mail article says A.L. Michael of Stanley Gibbons was the underbidder in the 1971 auction.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire it borders, to the south, Derbyshire and is astride the M1 motorway. The civil parish of Wales, which has a population of 6,455, increasing to 7,069 at the 2011 Census, encompasses the village and neighbouring settlement Kiveton Park.Wales is made up of four output areas in the Wales ward http://www.ukcensusdata.com/wales-e05001035#sthash.Dj7dOifD.QR4CsRRh.dpbs History Wales shares its name with the country of Wales, and the derivation may well be the same if it bears the same Anglo Saxon (and Germanic) root meaning foreigner(s). The suggestion, therefore, is that there was a continued Celtic presence here following the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons at the turn of the 6th century. An alternative explanation suggests that the settlement's name may be derived from the word Waelas, meaning \\"field of battle\\". The earliest reference to Wales is in 1002, when Wulfric Spot, a Saxon thegn, is recorded as owning Walesho. Sir William Hewet, Lord Mayor of London in 1559, was born in Wales, and his descendants, the Dukes of Leeds, would come to dominate the area. The collieries at Waleswood and Kiveton Park historically provided employment in the area, including to migrants from Wales' namesake country, until Kiveton Park Colliery was closed in September 1994. Geography The village of Wales itself is located at approximately , at an elevation of around 1,000 feet (300 m) above sea level. It lies on the A618 and B6059 roads. The M1 motorway bisects the parish, while the southern boundary is partly marked by the Chesterfield Canal whose Norwood Tunnel runs under meadowland to the south. To the west of the village is Rother Valley Country Park. Education and employment Education in Wales is provided by Wales Primary School and Wales High School.

The mechanism is held to be a quantum process called objective reduction that is orchestrated by cellular structures called microtubules. It is proposed that the theory may answer the hard problem of consciousness and provide a mechanism for free will. The hypothesis was first put forward in the early 1990s by Nobel laureate for physics, Roger Penrose, and anaesthesiologist and psychologist Stuart Hameroff. The hypothesis combines approaches from molecular biology, neuroscience, pharmacology, philosophy, quantum information theory, and quantum gravity. While mainstream theories assert that consciousness emerges as the complexity of the computations performed by cerebral neurons increases, Orch OR posits that consciousness is based on non-computable quantum processing performed by qubits formed collectively on cellular microtubules, a process significantly amplified in the neurons. The qubits are based on oscillating dipoles forming superposed resonance rings in helical pathways throughout lattices of microtubules. The oscillations are either electric, due to charge separation from London forces, or magnetic, due to electron spin‚Äîand possibly also due to nuclear spins (that can remain isolated for longer periods) that occur in gigahertz, megahertz and kilohertz frequency ranges. Orchestration refers to the hypothetical process by which connective proteins, such as microtubule- associated proteins (MAPs), influence or orchestrate qubit state reduction by modifying the spacetime-separation of their superimposed states. The latter is based on Penrose's objective-collapse theory for interpreting quantum mechanics, which postulates the existence of an objective threshold governing the collapse of quantum-states, related to the difference of the space-time curvature of these states in the universe's fine-scale structure. Orch OR has been criticized from its inception by mathematicians, philosophers,Davis, Martin 1993. How subtle is G√∂del's theorem? More on Roger Penrose. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 16, 611‚Äì612. Online version at Davis' faculty page at http://cs.nyu.edu/cs/faculty/davism/Putnam, Hilary 1995. Review of Shadows of the Mind. In Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society 32, 370‚Äì373 (also see Putnam's less technical criticisms in his New York Times review) and scientists,. The criticism concentrated on three issues: Penrose's interpretation of G√∂del's theorem; Penrose's abductive reasoning linking non- computability to quantum events; and the brain's unsuitability to host the quantum phenomena required by the theory, since it is considered too \\"warm, wet and noisy\\" to avoid decoherence. In 2014, Penrose and Hameroff published lengthy responses to these criticisms and revisions to many of the theory's peripheral assumptions, while retaining the core hypothesis. Background Logician Kurt G√∂del In 1931, mathematician and logician Kurt G√∂del proved that any effectively generated theory capable of proving basic arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete. In other words, a mathematically sound theory lacks the means to prove itself. An analogous statement has been used to show that humans are subject to the same limits as machines., , under \\"The Argument from Mathematics\\" where he writes \\"although it is established that there are limitations to the powers of any particular machine, it has only been stated, without sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect.\\" However, in his first book on consciousness, The Emperor's New Mind (1989), Roger Penrose argued that G√∂del-unprovable results are provable by human mathematicians. He takes this disparity to mean that human mathematicians are not describable as formal proof systems, and are therefore running a non- computable algorithm. If correct, the Penrose‚ÄìLucas argument leaves the question of the physical basis of non-computable behaviour open. Most physical laws are computable, and thus algorithmic. However, Penrose determined that wave function collapse was a prime candidate for a non-computable process. In quantum mechanics, particles are treated differently from the objects of classical mechanics. Particles are described by wave functions that evolve according to the Schr√∂dinger equation. Non-stationary wave functions are linear combinations of the eigenstates of the system, a phenomenon described by the superposition principle. When a quantum system interacts with a classical system‚Äîi.e. when an observable is measured‚Äîthe system appears to collapse to a random eigenstate of that observable from a classical vantage point. If collapse is truly random, then no process or algorithm can deterministically predict its outcome. This provided Penrose with a candidate for the physical basis of the non-computable process that he hypothesized to exist in the brain. However, he disliked the random nature of environmentally induced collapse, as randomness was not a promising basis for mathematical understanding. Penrose proposed that isolated systems may still undergo a new form of wave function collapse, which he called objective reduction (OR). Penrose sought to reconcile general relativity and quantum theory using his own ideas about the possible structure of spacetime. He suggested that at the Planck scale curved spacetime is not continuous, but discrete. He further postulated that each separated quantum superposition has its own piece of spacetime curvature, a blister in spacetime. Penrose suggests that gravity exerts a force on these spacetime blisters, which become unstable above the Planck scale of 10^{-35} \\\\text{m} and collapse to just one of the possible states. The rough threshold for OR is given by Penrose's indeterminacy principle: ::\\\\tau \\\\approx \\\\hbar/E_G :where: ::* \\\\tau is the time until OR occurs, ::* E_G is the gravitational self-energy or the degree of spacetime separation given by the superpositioned mass, and ::* \\\\hbar is the reduced Planck constant. Thus, the greater the mass-energy of the object, the faster it will undergo OR and vice versa. Atomic-level superpositions would require 10 million years to reach OR threshold, while an isolated 1 kilogram object would reach OR threshold in 10‚àí37s. Objects somewhere between these two scales could collapse on a timescale relevant to neural processing. An essential feature of Penrose's theory is that the choice of states when objective reduction occurs is selected neither randomly (as are choices following wave function collapse) nor algorithmically. Rather, states are selected by a \\"non- computable\\" influence embedded in the Planck scale of spacetime geometry. Penrose claimed that such information is Platonic, representing pure mathematical truth, aesthetic and ethical values at the Planck scale. This relates to Penrose's ideas concerning the three worlds: the physical, the mental, and the Platonic mathematical world.

Voronkov, eds., Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 3835, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, pp. 125‚Äì138. Minsky argued that because humans can believe false ideas to be true, human mathematical understanding need not be consistent and consciousness may easily have a deterministic basis.Marvin Minsky. \\"Conscious Machines.\\" Machinery of Consciousness, Proceedings, National Research Council of Canada, 75th Anniversary Symposium on Science in Society, June 1991. Feferman argued that mathematicians do not progress by mechanistic search through proofs, but by trial-and-error reasoning, insight and inspiration, and that machines do not share this approach with humans. Orch OR Penrose outlined a predecessor to Orch OR in The Emperor's New Mind, coming to the problem from a mathematical viewpoint and in particular G√∂del's theorem, but lacked a detailed proposal for how quantum processes could be implemented in the brain. Stuart Hameroff separately worked in cancer research and anesthesia, which gave him an interest in brain processes. Hameroff read Penrose's book and suggested to him that microtubules within neurons were suitable candidate sites for quantum processing, and ultimately for consciousness. Throughout the 1990s, the two collaborated on the Orch-OR theory, which Penrose published in Shadows of the Mind (1994). Hameroff's contribution to the theory derived from his study of the neural cytoskeleton, and particularly on microtubules. As neuroscience has progressed, the role of the cytoskeleton and microtubules has assumed greater importance. In addition to providing structural support, microtubule functions include axoplasmic transport and control of the cell's movement, growth and shape. Orch OR combines the Penrose‚ÄìLucas argument with Hameroff's hypothesis on quantum processing in microtubules. It proposes that when condensates in the brain undergo an objective wave function reduction, their collapse connects noncomputational decision-making to experiences embedded in spacetime's fundamental geometry. The theory further proposes that the microtubules both influence and are influenced by the conventional activity at the synapses between neurons. Microtubule computation A: An axon terminal releases neurotransmitters through a synapse and are received by microtubules in a neuron's dendritic spine. B: Simulated microtubule tubulins switch states. Hameroff proposed that microtubules were suitable candidates for quantum processing. Microtubules are made up of tubulin protein subunits. The tubulin protein dimers of the microtubules have hydrophobic pockets that may contain delocalized œÄ electrons. Tubulin has other, smaller non-polar regions, for example 8 tryptophans per tubulin, which contain œÄ electron-rich indole rings distributed throughout tubulin with separations of roughly 2 nm. Hameroff claims that this is close enough for the tubulin œÄ electrons to become quantum entangled. During entanglement, particle states become inseparably correlated. Hameroff originally suggested in the fringe Journal of Cosmology that the tubulin-subunit electrons would form a Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate. He then proposed a Frohlich condensate, a hypothetical coherent oscillation of dipolar molecules. However, this too was rejected by Reimers' group. Hameroff then responded to Reimers. \\"Reimers et al have most definitely NOT shown that strong or coherent Frohlich condensation in microtubules is unfeasible. The model microtubule on which they base their Hamiltonian is not a microtubule structure, but a simple linear chain of oscillators.\\" Hameroff reasoned that such condensate behavior would magnify nanoscopic quantum effects to have large scale influences in the brain. Hameroff then proposed that condensates in microtubules in one neuron can link with microtubule condensates in other neurons and glial cells via the gap junctions of electrical synapses. Hameroff proposed that the gap between the cells is sufficiently small that quantum objects can tunnel across it, allowing them to extend across a large area of the brain. He further postulated that the action of this large-scale quantum activity is the source of 40 Hz gamma waves, building upon the much less controversial theory that gap junctions are related to the gamma oscillation. Evidence In 1998, Hameroff made eight probable assumptions and 20 predictions to test the proposal. In 2013, Anirban Bandyopadhyay of the Japanese National Institute for Materials Science detected quantum states in microtubules. Penrose and Hameroff reported that Bandyopadhyay's experiments supported six out of the 20 theses, while invalidating none of the others. They subsequently responded to several critiques. In 2015, physicist Matthew Fisher of the University of California, Santa Barbara proposed that the nuclear spins in phosphorus atoms could become entangled, preventing the information loss of decoherence and enabling quantum computation within the brain. The FELIX experiment has also been suggested to evaluate and measure the criterion of orchestrated objective reduction. Criticism Orch OR has been criticized both by physicists and neuroscientists who considered it to be a poor model of brain physiology. Decoherence in living organisms In 2000 Max Tegmark claimed that any quantum coherent system in the brain would undergo effective wave function collapse due to environmental interaction long before it could influence neural processes (the \\"warm, wet and noisy\\" argument, as it was later came to be known). He determined the decoherence timescale of microtubule entanglement at brain temperatures to be on the order of femtoseconds, far too brief for neural processing. Christof Koch and Klaus Hepp also agreed that quantum coherence does not play, or does not need to play any major role in neurophysiology. Koch and Hepp concluded that \`\`The empirical demonstration of slowly decoherent and controllable quantum bits in neurons connected by electrical or chemical synapses, or the discovery of an efficient quantum algorithm for computations performed by the brain, would do much to bring these speculations from the ‚Äòfar-out‚Äô to the mere ‚Äòvery unlikely‚Äô.' In response to Tegmark's claims, Hagan, Tuszynski and Hameroff claimed that Tegmark did not address the Orch-OR model, but instead a model of his own construction. This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24 nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, although still far below 25 ms. Hameroff's group also suggested that the Debye layer of counterions could screen thermal fluctuations, and that the surrounding actin gel might enhance the ordering of water, further screening noise. They also suggested that incoherent metabolic energy could further order water, and finally that the configuration of the microtubule lattice might be suitable for quantum error correction, a means of resisting quantum decoherence. In 2007, Gregory S. Engel, Professor in Chemistry at The University of Chicago, claimed that all arguments concerning the brain being \\"too warm and wet\\" have been dispelled, as multiple \\"warm and wet\\" quantum processes have been discovered. In 2009, Reimers et al. and McKemmish et al., published critical assessments. Earlier versions of the theory had required tubulin-electrons to form either Bose‚ÄìEinsteins or Frohlich condensates, and the Reimers group noted the lack of empirical evidence that such could occur. Additionally they calculated that microtubules could only support weak 8 MHz coherence. McKemmish et al. argued that aromatic molecules cannot switch states because they are delocalised; and that changes in tubulin protein-conformation driven by GTP conversion would result in a prohibitive energy requirement. Neuroscience Hameroff frequently writes: \\"A typical brain neuron has roughly 107 tubulins (Yu and Baas, 1994)\\", yet this is Hameroff's own invention, which should not be attributed to Yu and Baas. Hameroff apparently misunderstood that Yu and Baas actually \\"reconstructed the microtubule (MT) arrays of a 56 Œºm axon from a cell that had undergone axon differentiation\\" and this reconstructed axon \\"contained 1430 MTs ... and the total MT length was 5750 Œºm.\\" A direct calculation shows that 107 tubulins (to be precise 9.3 √ó 106 tubulins) correspond to this MT length of 5750 Œºm inside the 56 Œºm axon. Hameroff's 1998 hypothesis required that cortical dendrites contain primarily 'A' lattice microtubules, but in 1994 Kikkawa et al. showed that all in vivo microtubules have a 'B' lattice and a seam. Orch OR also required gap junctions between neurons and glial cells, yet Binm√∂ller et. al. proved in 1992 that these don't exist in the adult brain. In vitro research with primary neuronal cultures shows evidence for electrotonic (gap junction) coupling between immature neurons and astrocytes obtained from rat embryos extracted prematurely through Cesarean section, however, the Orch-OR claim is that mature neurons are electrotonically coupled to astrocytes in the adult brain. Therefore, Orch OR contradicts the well-documented electrotonic decoupling of neurons from astrocytes in the process of neuronal maturation, which is stated by Fr√≥es et al. as follows: \\"junctional communication may provide metabolic and electrotonic interconnections between neuronal and astrocytic networks at early stages of neural development and such interactions are weakened as differentiation progresses.\\" In 2001, Hameroff further proposed that microtubule coherence spreads between different neurons via dendritic lamellar bodies (DLBs) that are connected directly with gap junctions. De Zeeuw et al. had already proved this to be impossible in 1995, by showing that DLBs are located micrometers away from gap junctions. In 2014, Bandyopadhyay et. al. speculated that microtubule-based quantum coherence can extend between different neurons if their notion of wireless transmission of information globally across the entire brain is proven. Hameroff and Penrose doubt whether such a wireless transmission would be capable of transmitting superimposed quantum-states and stick to their original gap junction proposal. Hameroff speculated that visual photons in the retina are detected directly by the cones and rods instead of decohering and subsequently connect with the retinal glia cells via gap junctions, but this too was falsified. Other biology-based criticisms have been offered. including a lack of explanation for the probabilistic release of neurotransmitter from presynaptic axon terminals and an error in the calculated number of the tubulin dimers per cortical neuron, a claim which Penrose and Hameroff directly disputed.

It usually applies to portfolios of derivatives instruments, where the volatility of its underlying is a major influencer of prices. Sensitivity to volatility A measure for the sensitivity of a price of a portfolio (or asset) to changes in volatility is vega, the rate of change of the value of the portfolio with respect to the volatility of the underlying asset. Risk management This kind of risk can be managed using appropriate financial instruments whose price depends on the volatility of a given financial asset (a stock, a commodity, an interest rate, etc.). Examples are Futures contracts such as VIX for equities, or caps, floors and swaptions for interest rates. Risk management is the configuration and identification of analyzing, and or acceptance during investment decision- making. In essence this occurs whenever an investor or portfolio manager evaluates potential losses within an investment. Under certain investment objectives, appropriate solutions (or no solution) will occur to assess the investors goals and standards. Improper risk management can and or will negatively affect companies as well as their individuals. For example, the recession that began in 2008 was largely caused by the loose credit risk management of financial firms.

It began life in 1993 as a print publication of Steve Jackson Games for its first 30 issues, though it has been published on the Internet since March 1998. Print issues were bimonthly; the first online version published new articles each week; the second online version is monthly. Pyramid is headquartered in Austin, Texas. It replaced Steve Jackson Games' previous magazine Roleplayer. Pyramid features general gaming articles by freelance authors, as well as Designer's Notes by Steve Jackson Games product developers, industry news, cartoons, and gaming product reviews. Although articles tend to concentrate on Steve Jackson Games products such as GURPS, it has published articles on other games such as d20 System, Talisman, Nobilis, Hero System, and has featured various comic strips and single-panel cartoons (currently Murphy's Rules). Steve Jackson Games also briefly published another online magazine, d20 Weekly for several months using a very similar model to that of Pyramid. However, the venture was not a success, and was eventually folded into a slightly expanded Pyramid. The online subscription system used for Pyramid also granted access to subscriber forums, a dedicated chat server, and occasional pre-publication playtest material for Steve Jackson Games and other companies' products. In 2008 this was changed: Pyramid is available as a PDF download from e23 (online service), and the subscriber forums have been discontinued. Access to playtest material is contingent on participation in an actual playtest. In late 2018, it was announced on the Pyramid page of the Steven Jackson Games website that \\"we are closing down Pyramid magazine later this year. The December 2018 issue will be the final issue of the magazine, and effective immediately, we are no longer accepting subscriptions.\\"http://www.sjgames.com/pyramid/ Publication history Shannon Appelcline noted that Roleplayer magazine ceased publication with issue #30 in 1993, \\"but only so that Steve Jackson Games could start a new magazine. Pyramid debuted in May 1993. It was an ironic return to the generalist magazine industry‚Äîthough it also promised to incorporate the SJG material that had once been printed in Autoduel Quarterly and Roleplayer.\\" Appelcline noted that the magazine covered its own games including Car Wars, but covered GURPS so strongly that \\"SJG always had problems selling Pyramid as a non-house organ. Contrariwise Car Wars quickly faded away. The new magazine also looked quite nice, with glossy pages and some full color pages‚Äîluxuries that Space Gamer had enjoyed only briefly. It soon became entirely color, as SJG's star continued to rise over the next few years.\\" Appelcline concluded that Steve Jackson Games began \\"having concerns over the profitability of publishing a generalist magazine. They finished up Pyramid's print run with #30 (March/April 1998), and then did something unprecedented: they began publishing 'volume two' of Pyramid as an online, weekly, subscription-based magazine and were able to successfully do so for 10 years.\\" He also noted that as the company was moving to PDF technology, Steve Jackson Games ended the HTML second volume of Pyramid and reinvented it in 2008 as a PDF-only third volume of Pyramid.

South from Uxbridge town centre, the line ran near Whitehall Road and Cleveland Road. In 1863, a plan was approved to construct an extension of the Uxbridge Branch to create a link northwards to in Hertfordshire via , connecting it to the Watford and Rickmansworth Railway (W&RR;). The scheme never went ahead as the GWR withdrew its funding. In November 1885, the Staines West branch opened sharing a short section of the Vine Street branch to connect to the main line. An intermediate station at Cowley opened in 1904. The Uxbridge Branch continued to be operated under British Rail until 10 September 1962, when the service from West Drayton was withdrawn and Uxbridge Vine Street station was closed to passengers.Uxbridge Vine St at Subterranea Britannica www.disused-stations.org.uk, Accessed 2008-11-20Uxbridge Vine St Line at Abandoned Tube Stations www.abandonedstations.org.uk Accessed 2008-11-20 Goods traffic ceased two years later and the only stretch of the line north of West Drayton to survive longer than this was that as far as Middlesex Oil Depot, some distance south of Cowley, which closed in 1979.

A triangular junction with the main line at the north end connected west towards Denham and east towards West Ruislip. The three junctions were named Denham South, Denham West and Denham East. The curve between the South and East Junctions was little used, and closed during World War I.

The station serves the western end of the north quay of the Royal Albert Dock, from which it takes its name. A view of the London City Airport is available. The station is located on an elevated section of the DLR's Beckton branch, between Prince Regent and Beckton Park stations. It is in Travelcard Zone 3. The station was opened on 28 March 1994. There was previously a station called Connaught Road on the Eastern Counties and Thames Junction Railway in the same area but this closed in 1940. The station is further from the nearest houses than any other on the DLR, despite which it has a steady patronage from those living in the area of Beckton to the north. In fact the station signage is subtitled \\"For West Beckton\\". However, the access route from these houses to the station, crossing the busy Royal Albert Way on the level, is notably substandard, the only footbridge being some distance away. Following the relocation of many London Borough of Newham council staff to the Building 1000 offices adjoining the station, usage has increased substantially during office hours. During disruption, Royal Albert acts as a terminus with a shuttle between Royal Albert and Beckton. This is possible because there is a crossover to the west of the station. The station serves the London Regatta Centre and Royal Docks Business Park which houses Newham Council. DLR upgrades It was originally planned that in 2010 work would start on extending the platforms at Royal Albert to handle three-car trains, which are being introduced across the DLR. The extension would have been at the east end of the station, bringing the platforms closer to Royal Docks Road, although no new access steps were planned. The platforms have not however been extended, and although metal catwalks have been installed, these are too narrow for non-emergency use and Selective Door Operation is used instead. 2010 should have also seen Royal Albert served by a second DLR service. The existing route between Beckton and Tower Gateway would have been supplemented by a second service between Beckton and Stratford International via Canning Town using the new DLR tracks from Canning Town to Stratford International. However this extension was severely delayed and didn't open until 31 August 2011. Connections London Buses routes 300 and 376 serves the station.

Unlike most of Pratchett's Discworld novels, Going Postal is divided into chapters, a feature previously seen only in Pratchett's children's books and the Science of Discworld series. These chapters begin with a synopsis of philosophical themes, in a similar manner to some Victorian novels and, notably, to Jules Verne stories. The title refers to both the contents of the novel, as well as to the term 'going postal'. The book was on the shortlist for both the Nebula and Locus Awards for Best (Fantasy) Novel. It would also have been shortlisted for the Hugo Award for Best Novel, except that Pratchett withdrew it, as he felt stress over the award would mar his enjoyment of the Worldcon.The 2005 Hugo Nominees (fiction) This was the first time Pratchett had been shortlisted for either award. Plot As with many of the Discworld novels, the story takes place in Ankh-Morpork, a powerful city-state based on the historical and modern settings of various metropolises like London or New York City. The protagonist of the story is Moist von Lipwig, a skilled con artist who was to be hanged for his crimes, but saved at the very last moment by the cunning and manipulative Patrician Havelock Vetinari, who has Moist's death on the scaffold faked. In his office, Vetinari then presents Moist with two options: he may accept a job offer to become Postmaster of the city's rundown Postal Service or he may choose to walk out of the door and never hear from Vetinari again. As exiting through the door in question would lead to a fatal drop, Moist decides to accept the job. After a thwarted attempt at escape, Moist is brought to the Post Office by his parole officer Mr Pump, a golem. It turns out that the Post Office has not functioned for decades, and the building is full of undelivered mail, concealed under a layer of pigeon dung. Only two employees remain: the aged Junior Postman Tolliver Groat and his assistant Stanley Howler. Meanwhile, Vetinari is holding a meeting with the board executives of the Grand Trunk Company, a company that owns and operates a system of visual telegraph towers known as \\"clacks\\". He notes that since they have taken full control, the quality of service had gone down considerably. Despite unnerving most of the board, Vetinari fails to make headway, especially with its chairman, Reacher Gilt. It's rumored that, from his penthouse office in Tump Tower, Reacher Gilt plans to usurp Vetinari as Patrician. As Moist attempts to revitalise the service, he discovers that a few months before taking the job, a number of his predecessors have predeceased in the building within weeks of each other in unusual circumstances. He also discovers that the mail inside the building has taken on a life of its own, and is nearly suffocated as a result. Moist introduces postage stamps to Ankh-Morpork, hires golems to deliver the mail, and finds himself competing against the Grand Trunk Clacks line. He meets and falls in love with the chain-smoking, golem-rights activist, Adora Belle Dearheart, and the two begin a relationship by the end of the book. Dearheart is the daughter of the Clacks founder Robert Dearheart, though the company was taken away from her father and the other founders by tricky financial manoeuvring. Because of this, she still has useful contacts amongst the clacks operators. The unscrupulous Clacks chairman, Reacher Gilt, sets a banshee assassin (Mr Gryle) on the Postmaster, but only manages to burn down much of the Post Office building. The banshee dies when he gets flipped onto the space-warping sorting machine. Lipwig makes an outrageous wager that he can deliver a message to Genua, 2000 miles from Ankh-Morpork, faster than the Grand Trunk can. \\"The Smoking Gnu\\", a group of clacks-crackers, sets up a plan to send a Discworld equivalent to a killer poke into the clacks system that will destroy the machinery, halting the message that Lipwig will race against. Lipwig talks the Gnu out of it, and opts for a more psychological attack on the Grand Trunk, leaving the semaphore towers standing. This plan succeeds. Gilt is soon arrested and finds himself in front of the Patrician, offered a similar choice to the one Moist faced in the beginning of the book: run the mint or exit the room. Gilt, however, ends up walking through the door to his death.

He was an important organizer of the Hungarian Communists' power (for example, organizing the State Protection Authority (√ÅVH)), but he eventually fell victim to M√°ty√°s R√°kosi's show trials. Background Born in Sz√©kelyudvarhely, the ninth of eleven children in a family of Transylvanian Saxons, his ties to Communism began at an early age when he became a member of the Communist Party of Hungary (KMP). Later he was expelled from his university for his political ideas and would become a building worker, until 1936 when he joined the Popular Front in the Spanish Civil War. He became commissar of the Rakosi Battalion of XIII International Brigade.Hugh Thomas, The Spanish Civil War, 4th Rev. Ed. 2001, p. 927 After the collapse of Republican Spain, he was interned in France until 1941, when he was finally able to return to Hungary, where he became Secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee, an underground Communist movement. In December 1944 he was arrested by a detachment of the Arrow Cross Party. He was to be executed, and was transported to the prison of Sopronk≈ëhida, then into Germany; but the intercession of his elder brother, Endre, a fascist under-secretary, saved his life. L√°szl√≥ Rajk was released on 13 May 1945. He went home to Hungary and took part in party politics. He became a member of all the leader corporations of the party (MKP) and the Extemporal Parliament. Rajk was a member of the High National Council from 7 December 1945 to 2 February 1946. On 20 March 1946 he was appointed minister of the Interior. In this post he organized the Hungarian Communist Party's private army and secret police (an organization analogous to the KGB, Securitate, Stasi and so on), the √ÅVH (originally AVO), and he became directly responsible for this. Under the cover of \\"struggle against fascism and reaction\\" and \\"defence of the power of proletariat\\", he prohibited and liquidated several religious, nationalist, and maverick establishments and groups (the number of these was about 1,500), and set up the first show trials. He was reassigned from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 5 August 1948 to 30 May 1949. R√°kosi, who saw Rajk as a threat to his power, decided to accuse him on false charges and had him arrested on 30 May 1949 on trumped-up charges. Rajk, who was popular among the Communists before, soon became the \\"chained dog\\" of Tito, Horthy and \\"the imperialist\\". Trial L√°szl√≥ Rajk was accused of being a \\"Titoist Spy\\", an agent for western imperialism and one who planned on restoring capitalism and jeopardizing Hungary's independence. During his time in prison, Rajk was tortured and was promised acquittal if he took responsibility for the charges brought against him. Stalin's NKVD emissary coordinated with Hungarian General Secretary M√°ty√°s R√°kosi and his √ÅVH to orchestrate Rajk's show trial. At his trial, held between 16 and 24 September 1949, in the large assembly hall of the headquarters of the Metal and Engineering Workers' Trade Union in Budapest, he confessed to all the charges brought against him. After his confession the prosecution decided, against the promise made, to call for the heaviest sentences to be brought down upon him and the other seven men who stood trial with him. Rajk was to be made an example for the beginning of Stalin's anti-Titoist purges. Rajk, along with Drs Tibor Sz√∂nyi and Andr√°s Szalai, was sentenced to death. Rajk was executed on 15 October 1949. Post- trial/reburial The Rajk trial marked the beginning of the anti-Titoist drive movement of Stalin. His trial also marked the beginning of the removal of all political parties in Hungary. The purges, however, left the economy in a truly disastrous state whereby a lack of capital inflow doomed the building projects that were underway. A vast number of the intelligentsia were then employed on the sort of manual labouring duties usually reserved for skilled professionals. The result left the country with an inadequate infrastructure and unsatisfactorily manufactured goods. The government was also using too many men to search for spies within the country and not enough to perform the productive work to sustain the economy. Dissatisfaction with R√°kosi's rule began to surface. On 28 March 1956, following numerous demonstrations, Rajk was rehabilitated in spite of his responsibility for the excesses of the secret police √ÅVH which he had founded in 1946, including initial large purges and executions under his direction. The rehabilitation speech, even though it was not publicized, had vast consequences for R√°kosi, who had used the Rajk guilt as an explanation for the other purges that followed. Now that he had to admit that he was, indeed, wrong, it would end up ruining R√°kosi's rightful authority. L√°szlo Rajk was then reburied, before 100,000 mourners, on 6 October 1956, along with two other men who lost their lives during the purges. (This was a precursor to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, which began on 23 October.)

In most of the games, the player controls private investigator Edward Carnby, who goes to investigate a haunted mansion or town that is full of undead creatures. The original story is based on the writings of H. P. Lovecraft, although later games in the series drew inspiration from other sources including voodoo, the Wild West, and the works of H. R. Giger. Six installments of the series have been created, with various themes and locations. Two comic books and two films were created based upon the games. Games Alone in the Dark (1992) The first game in the series was developed by Infogrames and released for the PC in 1992. It was one of the first two games to use polygonal characters over pre-rendered backgrounds. Guinness World Records awarded it the record of \\"First Ever 3D Survival Horror Game\\" in the Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition 2008 edition. Krisalis Software made a port for the 3DO in 1994 that was released by Interplay Entertainment. A Mac version was released in 1994. In 2014, Atari published a port to iOS developed by Kung Fu Factory but was pulled out of the App Store after the latest iOS updates. Jack in the Dark (1993) A small game made during the second game's production, Jack in the Dark was used as a promotional game distributed at Christmas 1993, just before the second installment's release. The game was on a single floppy in a golden wrapping featuring a Jack-in-the-box illustration on the top. It is a short adventure featuring the young child Grace Saunders. During Halloween, she enters a small toy store after dark and gets locked inside. There, the toys are alive, and Grace must save Santa Claus from an evil Jack-in-the-box. Jack in the Dark is an adventure game that focuses purely on puzzles and has no combat. Later CD versions of both Alone in the Dark and Alone in the Dark 2 came packaged with this game. Alone in the Dark 2 (1993) Developed by Infogrames and released for the PC in 1993, Alone in the Dark 2 was a drastic departure from the original game, being more action-oriented than its predecessor, with a much greater emphasis on firearms and shootouts, and resulting in more difficult combat. Like the original, it was ported to the 3DO by Krisalis and released by Interplay. An enhanced port under the name of Alone in the Dark: Jack is Back (Alone in the Dark: One-Eyed Jack's Revenge in the United States) was released in 1996 for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Both versions were also released in Japan under the original name. Alone in the Dark 3 (1994) Alone in the Dark 3 was the last game to utilize the same engine and characters as the original game. Released for the PC in 1994, the game returned to the gameplay style of the original game. A version of the game for Windows 95 was released as Alone in the Dark: Ghosts in Town in 1996. Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare (2001) The next generation game of the Alone in the Dark series was created by Darkworks as a console survival horror title, and shows significant influence from the Resident Evil series. The control scheme and gameplay are much closer to that of Resident Evil than the original Alone in the Dark games. Internally known as Alone in the Dark 4, the game was released in 2001, developed by Darkworks for the PlayStation and Dreamcast, and by Spiral Studios for the PC and PlayStation 2, also with an alternative portable Game Boy Color version developed by Pocket Studios. Alone in the Dark (2008) Developed by Eden Games for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and by Hydravision Entertainment for the PlayStation 2 and Wii, Alone in the Dark changed the focus of the series back to Survival horror. Initially known as Alone in the Dark: Near Death Investigation, the game was finally re-branded as simply Alone in the Dark despite having only a few connections with the original game. The game introduced 3D generated scenarios and interchangeable first and third-person view to the series. The environment plays a large role in core game-play; any object, even decorative, can be used as a melee weapon or combined to make different styles of weapons. The PS3 version was released several months after the other versions as Alone in the Dark: Inferno. It had a few gameplay changes and fewer glitches. Alone in the Dark: Illumination (2015) Announced on August 20, 2014, Illumination was released on June 11, 2015. Unlike the previous installments, the game is only played online. The game was heavily panned by critics and fans. Storyline Carnby opening a trunk at the Derceto mansion. Edward Carnby is the main protagonist of the series, and is a private detective. In the first three games, he is depicted as a middle-aged private investigator during the 1920s. The New Nightmare depicts him as a younger adult in 2001. In the 2008 installment of the series, Carnby's appearance was drastically changed. He has been the main protagonist in every game to date, with the exception of the mini game, Jack in the Dark, which instead features Grace Saunders, a character who appears in Alone in the Dark 2. He is also the main character in two movies loosely based upon the games. The three original games take place in the 1920s and depict the paranormal cases of private eye Edward Carnby. In 1924 (Alone in the Dark) he is commissioned by an antique dealer to investigate a piano in the loft of the Louisiana mansion Derceto, which was abandoned after its owner Jeremy Hartwood committed suicide. On Christmas Eve 1924 (Alone in the Dark 2) Carnby goes on to solve a case involving the kidnapping of young Grace Saunders after the investigating procedures of his deceased partner Ted Stryker, with all the clues leading to an old California mansion named \\"Hell's Kitchen\\"Alone in the Dark 2 Manual and an infamous gangster who inhabited it. In 1925 (Alone in the Dark 3) he is called to investigate the disappearance of a film crew at a two-bit ghost town known by the name of Slaughter Gulch located in the Mojave Desert in California. The first game shares the protagonist role with Jeremy Hartwood's niece, Emily Hartwood, who also takes a role of damsel-in-distress in Alone in the Dark 3. In Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare Carnby is investigating the death of his best friend, Charles Fiske. He teams up with Aline Cedrac, a young University professor specializing in ancient Indian languages, on a mission to Shadow Island.Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare Manual When Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare was made, the setting was moved from the 1920s to 2001, and a background legend was made up in order to explain that Edward Carnby belonged to a lineage of Shadow Hunters who were born the 29th of February of every 40 years and raised as orphan children in St George's Orphanage, all of them going by the name of Edward Carnby. The name is depicted as a literal anglicized form of \\"El War Qarn'bi\\", which means \\"the one who battles evil incarnate and hunts out the shadows\\". According to this legend, the original Edward Carnby was born in 1888 and went out of record after engaging several strange affairs in the years 1920 to 1939. The Edward Carnby that plays the main role in Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare was born in 1968. The 2008 Alone in the Dark reinterpreted once again the series storyline. It follows the canon of the first three games, and ignores the events of Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare. The story takes place in Central Park, New York, both inside the park and in its surroundings. Taking place in 2008, the game claims that there has only ever been one Edward Carnby, who has been possessed since the late 1920s, and is now over 100 years old, though he retains a youthful appearance. Alone in the Dark: Illumination takes place in the mining town of Lorwich, Virginia and harkens back to the series' Lovecraftian background. Development The original game engine was created by Fr√©d√©rick Raynal as a pet project while working at Infogrames. With the help of Didier Chanfray, who made the 3D models, a working prototype of the attic (the game's first room) was designed. An internal contest was held to create the art to complete the 3D prototype. Ya√´l Barroz's art was selected and she was introduced into the game's core team. Fr√©d√©rick Raynal directed the project. Shortly after Alone in the Dark's initial release, a major disagreement between the team and Infogrames' director (Bruno Bonnell) took place regarding the direction of the sequel. As a result, most of the original team left Infogrames to create a new studio named Adeline Software International. According to an interviewEDGE Magazine 150, pages 104-107 made just after the release of Alone in the Dark, portions of the sequels were designed by the original team before leaving. The interview presented a sketch of the house that was used in the sequel and mentioned the fact that Carnby could be dressed as Santa Claus. The original game's engine is the first known to use interpolated animation, relying on the computer to render the frames between key frames. This approach has the advantages of reducing the game's memory footprint (requiring less memory to store) and adapting to each computer's power. The game engine developed for Alone in the Dark was reused in its first two sequels (Alone in the Dark 2 and Alone in the Dark 3) without substantial changes. Infogrames updated it for use in 1996's Time Gate: Knight's Chase. Adaptations An Alone in the Dark one-shot comic book entitled Life is a Hideous Thing was published by Semic Comics in 2001 in France, and translated by Image Comics in the U.S. in September 2002. It was also translated and published in Italy and Spain. Written by Jean-Marc Lofficier and drawn by Matt Haley and Aleksi Briclot, it takes place just before Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare. It stars Edward Carnby and introduces Aline Cedrac, both on the trail of a mysterious lost city of Aggartha in Tibet. The comic also features Frank Stone, a young scientist who accompanies Aline, Ganesha, a fortune hunter, and Dr. Leng, a wise man who lives in his private flying ship along with his beautiful assistant Monplaisir (the two characters also appear in a French comic book based on \\"Motor Mayhem\\"). The characters travel to Aggartha in order to destroy the Crown of Genghis Khan, a powerful artifact able to summon a powerful creature known as the Creeping Chaos. Frank Stone is revealed to be possessed by a demon, and unleashes the Creeping Chaos. Its up to Carnby and Cedrac to defeat him and cast the creature back. The Creeping Chaos's appearance is based on a deity from Lovecraft's lore, Shub-Niggurath. In 2005, an Alone in the Dark film was released. A semi-sequel to the fourth game in the series, Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare, the movie has little-to-no relation to the games from the 1990s or the 2008 continuation. As a result, the film is known as one of the worst ever made. The movie contains plot elements that directly contradict those in The New Nightmare, thus it is not considered canonical by either timeline. Guinness World Records named the film the \\"Lowest-Grossing Game Based Movie\\" in Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008 edition. Production on a fifth installment of Alone in the Dark was confirmed when screenwriters of the movie stated that the director, Uwe Boll, looked over preliminary monster art from the new game to get inspiration for the film's creatures. However, the game was delayed and Darkworks, the development team behind Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare, eventually worked on another Survival horror game, Cold Fear, released in early 2005. Atari Inc. confirmed in 2006 the production of Alone in the Dark: Near Death Investigation by Eden Games development studio and Hydravision Entertainment studio. In 2009, a low- budget sequel titled Alone in the Dark II was released, featuring an entirely new cast and a story centered on witch hunting.

Together with his early climbing partner, Don Whillans, he was one of a new breed of British post-war climbers who came from working class backgrounds in contrast to the upper and middle class professionals who had dominated the sport up to the Second World War. Some of his climbs were televised and he assisted with mountaineering scenes in several films; Brown died on 15 April 2020 at the age of 89. Early life Brown was born the seventh and last child of a family in Ardwick, Manchester, England. His father was a builder and merchant seaman who died in 1931 when Brown was eight months old. Brown's mother was forced to take in washing before she began work as a cleaner. In his autobiography, The Hard Years, Brown remembered being banned from the Scouts for refusing to go on a church parade and recalled how he began exploring the countryside ‚Äì camping out, playing and climbing in old quarries. At around the age of 16 he came to Kinder Downfall and, having read Colin Kirkus' Let's Go Climbing, he decided to begin climbing. He reputedly borrowed his mother's old washing line to use as a rope, but Brown himself explained that, in fact, he stole rope that had been placed around roadworks. After leaving school he trained as an apprentice plumber and general builder, working for a plumber and general builder called Archie.\\"Joe Brown Biography\\" Joe-Brown.com. In 1949‚Äì50, he was conscripted for 18 months in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, where he spent his free time climbing with friends. Brown broke his leg in three places in a scrum for the tea urn but was back up and climbing three months later. Climbing career In 1956 Brown and Ian McNaught-Davis made the first ascent of the west summit of the Muztagh Tower Brown, who was known as \\"The Master\\" and \\"The Human Fly\\", became famous for climbing during the 1950s. He was a member of the Valkyrie Climbing Club and founding member of the Rock and Ice Club. In Hard Rock, Ken Wilson said of Brown: \\"The reader may gain some idea of his ability by studying those of his climbs featured in this book. He has brought to climbing a rare combination of attributes: keenness, patience, strength, technical ability, eye for a line, competitiveness and, above all, a subtle and mysterious charisma. Few would deny that his place in British rock climbing remains pre-eminent.\\" Reviewing Brown's autobiography The Hard Years in 1967, the climber A. B. Hargreaves said: \\"This is a remarkable book by a remarkable man. As for the man, the hard man, the climber, his achievements both in rock climbing and mountaineering have been very great. In twenty years he has become a legend\\". An early climbing partner was Don Whillans, from the neighbouring city of Salford. They were among the first of a new breed of post-war climbers from working class backgrounds, in contrast to the upper and middle class professionals who had dominated the sport up to the Second World War. So famous was he that the Post Office delivered a letter to him simply addressed \\"The Human Fly, UK\\". Brown established a number of new routes in Snowdonia and the Peak District that were at the leading edge of the hardest grades. Examples on Dinas Cromlech in the Llanberis Pass include \\"Cenotaph Corner\\" (1952, graded E1, with Doug Belshaw) and \\"Cemetery Gates\\" (1951, E1, with Don Whillans). Brown's mountaineering achievements in the Alps and Himalayas included many ascents in the 1950s with Whillans and other members of the Rock and Ice climbing club and, in 1955, the first ascent of the world's third highest mountain, Kangchenjunga in the Nepalese Himalayas, with George Band. In 1956 he made the first ascent of the west summit of the Muztagh Tower in the Karakoram with Ian McNaught-Davis. The other members of the team, John Hartog and Tom Patey, reached the main summit the next day. As well as creating pioneering routes, he helped create new types of \\"protection\\" to improve safety on climbs, and is acknowledged to have created some of the first \\"nuts\\" by drilling the thread out of engineering nuts and threading the centre with a sling. He started to create and improve climbing gear and in 1966 opened a shop, since expanded to three shops in Snowdonia and an online store. Personal life On 17 February 1957, Brown married Valerie Melville Gray. His first daughter Helen was born in 1960, followed six years later by Zoe. On 15 April 2020, Brown died at his home in Llanberis, aged 89.  Honours  Brown was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) and in 2011 was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the New Year's Honours List for services to rock climbing and mountaineering. Upon receiving the CBE, the BBC reported him as saying: \\"Receiving the CBE is so strange, because it's like I'm being awarded for enjoying myself\\".  In the media  Throughout his climbing career Brown was involved in films such as Hazard, Upside Down Wales, Five Days One Summer, in which he and other British climbers assisted with the mountaineering scenes. In 1986 he was the stunt double for Robert De Niro during the climbing scenes in The Mission. Brown is remembered for televised rock climbs in the 1960s, three in Snowdonia, and in 1967, a spectacular new route on the Old Man of Hoy, a Scottish sea stack, with Ian McNaught-Davis and Chris Bonington, which was broadcast live by the BBC. Fifteen years later Brown repeated the climb of the Old Man in a television documentary with his second daughter Zoe. In his 2010 book Unjustifiable Risk?: The Story of British Climbing, Simon Thompson, says of Brown: \\"Joe Brown is regarded by many as the finest British climber of the twentieth century\\".

It has also seen some popularity in regions of the United States and Canada where the aforementioned diasporas are common. Its origins are in the Slavic and Ancient Greek languages. Variations include: Nadja, Nadya, Nadine, Nadiya, and Nadiia. The name Nadia means \\"hope\\" in many Slavic languages, e.g. Ukrainian Nadiya (–ù–∞–¥—ñ—è, accent on the i), Belarusian Nadzeya (–ù–∞–¥–∑–µ—è, accent on the e), and Old Polish Nadzieja, all of which are derived from Old East Slavic. In Bulgarian and Russian, on the other hand, Nadia or Nadya (–ù–∞–¥—è, accent on first syllable) is the diminutive form of the full name Nadyezhda (–ù–∞–¥–µ–∂–¥–∞), meaning \\"hope\\" and derived from Old Church Slavonic, which it entered as a translation of the Greek word ŒµŒªœÄŒØœÇ (Elpis), with the same meaning. The name's early roots and origins date back to Ancient Greece mythology. In most other languages, it is a name in its own right.

Following a Roman Catholic Requiem Mass, a catafalque may be used to stand in place of the body at the absolution of the dead or used during Masses of the Dead and All Souls' Day. According to Peter Stanford, the term originates from the Italian ', which means scaffolding. However, the Oxford English Dictionary says the word is \\"[o]f unknown derivation; even the original form is uncertain; French pointing to or , Italian to , Spanish to .\\" The most notable Italian catafalque was the one designed for Michelangelo by his fellow artists in 1564. An elaborate and highly decorated roofed surround for a catafalque, common for grand funerals of the Baroque era, may be called a '.  Papal catafalques  Large processions have followed the catafalques of Popes. The households of the cardinals carried the catafalque of Pope Sixtus V in 1590. The bier, decorated with gold cloth, was followed by \\"confraternities, religious orders, students of seminaries and colleges, orphans and mendicants\\". In 1963, a million people filed past the catafalque of Pope John XXIII, which had been carried in procession to St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. In Catholic Liturgy, the catafalque is either an empty casket or a wooden form made to look like a casket that is covered by the black pall and surrounded by six unbleached (orange) candles (when they are available); it is a symbolic representation of the deceased or a monument erected to represent the faithful departed. When it is present, the priest sings the absolution for the deceased as if the body was present. The body was the Temple of the Holy Spirit and must be shown the greatest respect, even symbolically, the catafalque is thus this symbol of hope in God and in His promise to raise our bodies and that of our departed ones in glory like the Risen Body of His Son seated at His right hand.  Notable catafalques  Voltaire's catafalque Other than religious leaders such as Popes, famous people have lain in state or been carried in procession to their burial place on a catafalque.  Voltaire  Thirteen years after his death, the remains of Voltaire were transferred on a catafalque to the Panth√©on in Paris, a building dedicated to the great men of the French nation. It bore the inscription: \\"Poet, philosopher, historian, he made a great step forward in the human spirit. He prepared us to become free.\\"  Abraham Lincoln  The Lincoln catafalque in the United States Capitol The Lincoln catafalque, first used for United States President Abraham Lincoln's funeral in 1865, has been used for all those who have lain in state in the Capitol Rotunda since Lincoln's death, the most recent of which were civil rights activist and U.S. representative John Lewis on July 27, 2020 and U.S. Representative Elijah Cummings on October 25, 2019. It has recently been used at the memorial for Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the rotunda of the Supreme Court of the United States on September 23, 2020. It was later moved to the portico of the Court for public viewing. When not in use, the catafalque is kept on display in the Exhibition Hall at the United States Capitol Visitor Center. Commentators noted that the structure of the original pine timbers and boards has been reinforced, albeit being left 'original'.According to Robert Cromie in his book The Great Chicago Fire, copyright 1958, Lincoln's catafalque was in Woods' Museum in Chicago and was burned in the Great Chicago Fire in 1871. However, Lincoln had funeral ceremonies during stops at several major cities as his remains were taken by train from Washington to Springfield, Illinois for burial. Cromie probably meant the catafalque used for ceremonies held at Chicago, rather than the one built for his state funeral in DC and retained at the U.S. Capitol.

Atenolol, however, does not seem to improve mortality in those with high blood pressure. Other uses include the prevention of migraines and treatment of certain irregular heart beats. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. It can also be used with other blood pressure medications. Common side effects include feeling tired, heart failure, dizziness, depression, and shortness of breath. Other serious side effects include bronchospasm. Use is not recommended during pregnancy and alternative drugs are preferred when breastfeeding. It works by blocking Œ≤1-adrenergic receptors in the heart, thus decreasing the heart rate and workload. Atenolol was patented in 1969 and approved for medical use in 1975. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 36th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 20 million prescriptions. Medical uses Atenolol is used for a number of conditions including hypertension, angina, long QT syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. The role for Œ≤-blockers in general in hypertension was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom, and later in the United States, as they are less appropriate than other agents such as ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, thiazide diuretics and angiotensin receptor blockers, particularly in the elderly. Side effects Atenolol was the main Œ≤-blocker identified as carrying a higher risk of provoking type 2 diabetes, leading to its downgrading in the United Kingdom in June 2006 to fourth-line agent in the management of hypertension. Antihypertensive therapy with atenolol provides weaker protective action against cardiovascular complications (e.g. myocardial infarction and stroke) compared to other antihypertensive medications. In some cases, diuretics are superior. Overdose Symptoms of overdose are due to excessive pharmacodynamic actions on Œ≤1 and also Œ≤2-receptors. These include bradycardia (slow heartbeat), severe hypotension with shock, acute heart failure, hypoglycemia and bronchospastic reactions. Treatment is largely symptomatic. Hospitalization and intensive monitoring is indicated. Activated charcoal is useful to absorb the drug. Atropine will counteract bradycardia, glucagon helps with hypoglycemia, dobutamine can be given against hypotension and the inhalation of a Œ≤2-mimetic as hexoprenalin or salbutamol will terminate bronchospasms. Blood or plasma atenolol concentrations may be measured to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 3 mg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 3‚Äì30 mg/L in overdose victims. Society and culture Atenolol has been given as an example of how slow healthcare providers are to change their prescribing practices in the face of medical evidence that indicates that a drug is not as effective as others in treating some conditions. In 2012, 33.8 million prescriptions were written to American patients for this drug. In 2014, it was in the top (most common) 1% of drugs prescribed to Medicare patients. Although the number of prescriptions has been declining steadily since limited evidence articles contesting its efficacy was published, it has been estimated that it would take 20 years for doctors to stop prescribing it for hypertension. Despite its diminished efficacy when compared to newer antihypertensive drugs, atenolol and other beta blockers still a relevant clinical choice for treating some conditions, since beta blockers are a diverse group of medicines with diferent properties that still requires further research. As consequence, reasons for the popularity of beta blockers can't be fully atributed to a slow healthcare system ‚Äì patient compliance factor, such as.treatment cost and duration, also affect adherence and popularity of therapy.

The rapping (r√§pp√§ys) is mainly done in Finnish. Many rappers use Helsinki slang words; general slang and Finnish dialects are used too by some artists. Many early rappers () used the English language. Some Finnish rap was already recorded in the early 1980s and some popular artists emerged in the early 1990s but it was not until the 2000s that it finally became a long-lasting phenomenon in the form of a wider scene and numerous popular performers. The first recorded Finnish rap song was \\"I'm Young, Beautiful and Natural\\" in the English language which was made by an artist called General Njassa in 1983. Rap music in Finnish language made its first breakthrough in 1990 when groups Raptori and P√§√§kk√∂set and artist Nikke T got their records to Finnish charts. Raptori in particular became a nationwide phenomenon. These artists had a style greatly different when compared to American rap music. Their music was highly influenced by the dance-pop of the 1980s and their approach to music was largely humoristic. Later Finnish rappers tend to despise this wave of the early 1990s. Niko Toiskallio (Nikke T) himself has later stated that he regrets his humoristic dance-influenced rap recordings and he claims that so-called humour-rap deprived the credibility of Finnish rap scene which did not recover until many years later in the late 1990s.Ylioppilaslehti (the weekly paper of university students), 2007, 5.11  Notable artists  ;Mainstream rap artists and crews *Eevil St√∂√∂ *Mikael Gabriel *JVG *Cheek *Uniikki *Teflon Brothers *M√§kki *Elastinen *Spekti *Daco Junior *Ezkimo *Nikke Ankara *Kapasiteettiyksikk√∂ *Petri Nyg√•rd * Redrama *Juju *Pyhimys *Kube *Heikki Kuula ;Underground rap artists and crews *Amoc *Notkea Rotta *Steen1 *OG Ikonen *Paleface *Raimo *Ruudolf *Ruger Hauer *Iso H *Gettomasa *SMC L√§hi√∂rotat References External links * Finnish hip hop portal based around the \\"Basso\\" magazine ","title":"Finnish hip hop"},{"id":"712319","text":"Atrophy is the partial or complete wasting away of a part of the body. Causes of atrophy include mutations (which can destroy the gene to build up the organ), poor nourishment, poor circulation, loss of hormonal support, loss of nerve supply to the target organ, excessive amount of apoptosis of cells, and disuse or lack of exercise or disease intrinsic to the tissue itself. In medical practice, hormonal and nerve inputs that maintain an organ or body part are said to have trophic effects. A diminished muscular trophic condition is designated as atrophy. Atrophy is reduction in size of cell, organ or tissue, after attaining its normal mature growth. In contrast, hypoplasia is the reduction in size of a cell, organ, or tissue that has not attained normal maturity. Atrophy is the general physiological process of reabsorption and breakdown of tissues, involving apoptosis. When it occurs as a result of disease or loss of trophic support because of other diseases, it is termed pathological atrophy, although it can be a part of normal body development and homeostasis as well. Normal development Examples of atrophy as part of normal development include shrinking and the involution of the thymus in early childhood, and the tonsils in adolescence. In old age, effects include, but are not limited to, loss of teeth, hair, thinning of skin that creates wrinkles, weakening of muscles, loss of weight in organs and sluggish mental activity. Muscle atrophies Disuse atrophy of muscles and bones, with loss of mass and strength, can occur after prolonged immobility, such as extended bedrest, or having a body part in a cast (living in darkness for the eye, bedridden for the legs etc.). This type of atrophy can usually be reversed with exercise unless severe. Astronauts in microgravity must exercise regularly to minimize atrophy of their limb muscles. There are many diseases and conditions which cause atrophy of muscle mass. For example, diseases such as cancer and AIDS induce a body wasting syndrome called cachexia, which is notable for the severe muscle atrophy seen. Other syndromes or conditions which can induce skeletal muscle atrophy are congestive heart failure and liver disease. During aging, there is a gradual decrease in the ability to maintain skeletal muscle function and mass. This condition is called sarcopenia, and may be distinct from atrophy in its pathophysiology. While the exact cause of sarcopenia is unknown, it may be induced by a combination of a gradual failure in the satellite cells which help to regenerate skeletal muscle fibers, and a decrease in sensitivity to or the availability of critical secreted growth factors which are necessary to maintain muscle mass and satellite cell survival.  Dystrophies, myositis, and motor neuron conditions  Pathologic atrophy of muscles can occur with diseases of the motor nerves or diseases of the muscle tissue itself. Examples of atrophying nerve diseases include Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, poliomyelitis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease), and Guillain‚ÄìBarr√© syndrome. Examples of atrophying muscle diseases include muscular dystrophy, myotonia congenita, and myotonic dystrophy. Changes in Na+ channel isoform expression and spontaneous activity in muscle called fibrillation can also result in muscle atrophy. A flail limb is a medical term which refers to an extremity in which the primary nerve has been severed, resulting in complete lack of mobility and sensation. The muscles soon wither away from atrophy. Gland atrophy The adrenal glands atrophy during prolonged use of exogenous glucocorticoids like prednisone. Atrophy of the breasts can occur with prolonged estrogen reduction, as with anorexia nervosa or menopause. Testicular atrophy can occur with prolonged use of enough exogenous sex steroids (either androgen or estrogen) to reduce gonadotropin secretion. Vaginal atrophy In post-menopausal women, the walls of the vagina become thinner (atrophic vaginitis). The mechanism for the age-related condition is not yet clear, though there are theories that the effect is caused by decreases in estrogen levels. This atrophy, and that of the breasts concurrently, is consistent with the homeostatic (normal development) role of atrophy in general, as after menopause the body has no further functional biological need to maintain the reproductive system which it has permanently shut down. Research One drug in test seemed to prevent the type of muscle loss that occurs in immobile, bedridden patients. Testing on mice showed that it blocked the activity of a protein present in the muscle that is involved in muscle atrophy. However, the drug's long-term effect on the heart precludes its routine use in humans, and other drugs are being sought.

Mikhalkov is a three- time laureate of the State Prize of the Russian Federation (1993, 1995, 1999) and is a Full Cavalier of the Order \\"For Merit to the Fatherland\\". Nikita Mikhalkov won the Golden Lion of the Venice Film Festival (1991) and was nominated for the Academy Award (1993) in the category Best Foreign Language Film for the film Close to Eden. He won an Academy Award (1995) for Best Foreign Language Film and the Grand Prix of the Cannes Film Festival (1994) for the film Burnt by the Sun. Mikhalkov received the \\"Special Lion\\" of the Venice Film Festival (2007) for his contribution to the cinematography and nominated for the Oscar (2008) in the category \\"Best Foreign Language Film\\" for the film 12. Ancestry Mikhalkov was born in Moscow into the distinguished, artistic Mikhalkov family. His great grandfather was the imperial governor of Yaroslavl, whose mother was a princess of the House of Golitsyn. Nikita's father, Sergei Mikhalkov, was best known as writer of children's literature, although he also wrote lyrics to his country's national anthem on three occasions spanning nearly 60 years ‚Äì two sets of lyrics used for the Soviet national anthem, and the current lyrics of the Russian national anthem. Mikhalkov's mother, poet Natalia Konchalovskaya, was the daughter of the avant-garde artist Pyotr Konchalovsky and granddaughter of another outstanding painter, Vasily Surikov. Nikita's older brother is the filmmaker Andrei Konchalovsky, primarily known for his collaboration with Andrei Tarkovsky and his own Hollywood action films, such as Runaway Train and Tango & Cash. Career Early acting career Mikhalkov studied acting at the children's studio of the Moscow Art Theatre and later at the Shchukin School of the Vakhtangov Theatre. While still a student, he appeared in Georgi Daneliya's film I Step Through Moscow (1964) and his brother Andrei Konchalovsky's film Home of the Gentry (1969). He was soon on his way to becoming a star of the Soviet stage and cinema. Directing While continuing to pursue his acting career, he entered VGIK, the state film school in Moscow, where he studied directing under film maker Mikhail Romm, teacher to his brother and Andrei Tarkovsky. He directed his first short film in 1968, I'm Coming Home, and another for his graduation, A Quiet Day at the End of the War in 1970. Mikhalkov had appeared in more than 20 films, including his brother's Uncle Vanya (1972), before he co-wrote, directed and starred in his first feature, At Home Among Strangers in 1974, an Ostern set just after the 1920s civil war in Russia. Mikhalkov established an international reputation with his second feature, A Slave of Love (1976). Set in 1917, it followed the efforts of a film crew to make a silent melodrama in a resort town while the Revolution rages around them. The film, based upon the last days of Vera Kholodnaya, was highly acclaimed upon its release in the U.S. Mikhalkov's next film, An Unfinished Piece for Mechanical Piano (1977) was adapted by Mikhalkov from Chekhov's early play, Platonov, and won the first prize at the San Sebastian Film Festival. In 1978, while starring in his brother's epic film Siberiade, Mikhalkov made Five Evenings, a love story about a couple separated by World War II, who meet again after eighteen years. Mikhalkov's next film, A Few Days from the Life of I. I. Oblomov (1980), with Oleg Tabakov in the title role, is based on Ivan Goncharov's classic novel about a lazy young nobleman who refuses to leave his bed. Family Relations (1981) is a comedy about a provincial woman in Moscow dealing with the tangled relationships of her relatives. Without Witness (1983) tracks a long night's conversation between a woman (Irina Kupchenko) and her ex-husband (Mikhail Ulyanov) when they are accidentally locked in a room. The film won the Prix FIPRESCI at the 13th Moscow International Film Festival. In the early 1980s, Mikhalkov resumed his acting career, appearing in Eldar Ryazanov's immensely popular Station for Two (1982) and A Cruel Romance (1984). At that period, he also played Henry Baskerville in the Soviet screen version of The Hound of the Baskervilles. He also starred in many of his own films, including At Home Among Strangers, A Slave of Love, and An Unfinished Piece for Player Piano. International success Incorporating several short stories by Chekhov, Dark Eyes (1987) stars Marcello Mastroianni as an old man who tells a story of a romance he had when he was younger, a woman he has never been able to forget. The film was highly praised, and Mastroianni received the Best Actor Prize at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival and an Academy Award nomination for his performance. Mikhalkov's next film, Urga (1992, a.k.a. Close to Eden), set in the little- known world of the Mongols, received the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Mikhalkov's Anna: 6‚Äì18 (1993) documents his daughter Anna as she grows from childhood to maturity. Mikhalkov's most famous production to date, Burnt by the Sun (1994), was steeped in the paranoid atmosphere of Joseph Stalin's Great Terror. The film received the Grand Prize at Cannes and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, among many other honours. To date, Burnt by the Sun remains the highest-grossing film to come out of the former Soviet Union. In 1996, he was the head of the jury at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival. Recent career Mikhalkov and his daughter Nadezhda at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival Mikhalkov used the critical and financial triumph of Burnt by the Sun to raise $25 million for his most epic venture to date, The Barber of Siberia (1998). The film, which was screened out of competition at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival, was designed as a patriotic extravaganza for domestic consumption. It featured Julia Ormond and Oleg Menshikov, who regularly appears in Mikhalkov's films, in the leading roles. The director himself appeared as Tsar Alexander III of Russia. The film received the Russian State Prize and spawned rumours about Mikhalkov's presidential ambitions. The director, however, chose to administer the Russian cinema industry. Despite much opposition from rival directors, he was elected the President of the Russian Society of Cinematographers and has managed the Moscow Film Festival since 2000. He also set the Russian Academy Golden Eagle Award in opposition to the traditional Nika Award. In 2005, Mikhalkov resumed his acting career, starring in three brand-new movies ‚Äì The Councillor of State, a Fandorin mystery film which broke the Russian box-office records, Zhmurki, a noir-drenched comedy about the Russian Mafia, and Krzysztof Zanussi's Persona non grata. In 2007, Mikhalkov directed and starred in 12, a Russian adaptation of Sidney Lumet's court drama 12 Angry Men. In September 2007, 12 received a special Golden Lion for the ‚Äúconsistent brilliance‚Äù of its work and was praised by many critics at the Venice Film Festival. In 2008, 12 was named as a nominee for Best Foreign Language Film for the 80th Academy Awards. Commenting on the nomination, Mikhalkov said, \\"I am overjoyed that the movie has been noticed in the United States and, what's more, was included in the shortlist of five nominees. This is a significant event for me.\\" He also served as the executive producer of an epic film 1612. Mikhalkov presented his \\"epic drama\\" Burnt by the Sun 2 at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, but did not receive any awards. The film was selected in 2011 as the Russian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards. Personal life Mikhalkov's first wife was renowned Russian actress Anastasiya Vertinskaya, whom he married on 6 March 1967. They had a son, Stepan, born in September 1966. With his second wife, former model Tatyana, he had a son Artyom (born 8 December 1975), and daughters Anna (born 1974) and Nadya (born 27 September 1986). Political views Mikhalkov with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on the set of the movie Burnt by the Sun 2 in Leningrad Oblast on 13 May 2008 Mikhalkov is actively involved in Russian politics. He is known for his at times Russian nationalist and Slavophile views. In October 2006, Mikhalkov visited Serbia, giving moral support to Serbia's sovereignty over Kosovo.–ú–∏—Ö–∞–ª–∫–æ–≤: \\"–Ø –ø—Ä–∏–µ—Ö–∞–ª, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞—Ç—å —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ö–æ—Å–æ–≤–∞ –≤ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–∞–≤–µ –°–µ—Ä–±–∏–∏\\" In 2008, he visited Serbia to support Tomislav Nikoliƒá who was running as the ultra-nationalist candidate for the Serb presidency at the time. Mikhalkov took part in a meeting of \\"Nomocanon\\", a Serb youth organization which denies war crimes committed by Serbs in the 1992‚Äì99 Yugoslav wars. In a speech given to the organization, Mikhalkov spoke about a \\"war against Orthodoxy\\" wherein he cited Orthodox Christianity as \\"the main force which opposes cultural and intellectual McDonald's\\". In response to his statement, a journalist asked Mikhalkov: \\"Which is better, McDonald's or Stalinism?\\" Mikhalkov answered: \\"That depends on the person\\".

Dunaway on a horse-drawn limbers and caissons during a military funeral procession at Arlington National Cemetery, 2008. A military funeral is a memorial or burial rite given by a country's military for a soldier, sailor, marine or airman who died in battle, a veteran, or other prominent military figures or heads of state. A military funeral may feature guards of honor, the firing of volley shots as a salute, drumming and other military elements, with a flag draping over the coffin. Canada Canadian military funerals involve many rituals seen in other parts of the world. The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery use a 25-pounder gun and limber as the funeral vehicle. Muffled drums accompany the graveside processional. The deceased's headdress, insignia and medals are borne on a velvet cushion into the funeral service. Volleys are fired over the grave when the body is interred. Countries in the Commonwealth duplicate the British military drill and ceremony. The Canadian funeral described above typifies the funerary service. The bugle tune Last Post is played as the body is interred. Chile Chilean Army cadets carrying the coffin of general Augusto Pinochet. In Chilean military funerals, due to its Prussian military tradition, the German song \\"Ich hatt' einen Kameraden\\" is sung in its Spanish version (\\"Yo ten√≠a un camarada\\"). The casket may or may not be horse-drawn on a caisson. A bugler sounds the final honors during interment. When the coffin enters the tomb, a fireteam executes a salvo.Tradiciones Navales. Chilean Navy, n/d (in Spanish). Retrieved 25 April 2017. If for a general or flag officer, the 1st Artillery Regiment \\"Tacna\\" fires a three-volley gun salute. Germany In Germany, Ludwig Uhland's song \\"Ich hatt' einen Kameraden\\" is an integral part of a military funeral. It is played when the coffin is lowered into the grave, military personnel will perform a salute. Indonesia State Funeral procession of President B. J. Habibie, Jakarta - 12 September 2019. The casket is carried by Paspampres honor guardsmen and is accompanied by the Military chief of staffs and the INP chief In Indonesia, military funerals are generally given only either towards retired personnel of the Indonesian National Armed Forces who served in domestic operations or in international peacekeeping operations or retired guerrillas and/or soldiers of the National Revolutionary War, especially those holding the \\"Bintang Gerilya (Star of the Guerrilla)\\" order, or to active personnel killed while on active duty service. Exceptional politicians and Ministers have the option for such a funeral, but most opt for a more intimate religious one. During the occasion of a State funeral, it is obligatory for a military funeral to be conducted, preceded by a final religious service before the funeral march begins. A Three-volley salute is the norm done by a squad seven soldiers occasionally a mixture of Armed Forces or Police personnel dependent on their career.(For example: a Minister of Transportation may have been a career Army/Navy soldier, became a bureaucrat and assisted the national aviation or maritime industry- thus the corresponding service branch would send soldiers as gratitude.) The Honour drill team surrounding the burial site is a platoon-size or company formation and the larger the platoon or company, the more illustrious the departed. Prayers are led by representatives of the person's religious faith. Similar traditions also exist in the Indonesian National Police. See here: Indonesian Military Funeral Video Sample During the funeral ceremony, the presiding officer of the ceremony reads a message of remembrance in the name of the government and people of Indonesia, as well as his/her chosen uniformed organization in which he/she served, preceded by a reading of the person's life and achievements, as well as of his/her military/police service record (if any).

So the funeral follows the protocol of a state funeral, and in particular the six officers in high uniform who carry the coffin are members of the same Armed Force of the departed. Poland In Poland, the last fragment of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Tarnowski's song ≈öpij, kolego (\\"Sleep, friend\\"),Polish text a portion of the larger composition Jak to na wojence ≈Çadnie (the title has no precise English translation, but it is roughly \\"how nice it is in war\\", with a diminutive form conveying a sense of ironic solidarity) is an integral part of a military funeral, played by a trumpeter. It is also played during state ceremonies. Also part of it is a three volley salute (salwa honorowa) with the firing party consisting of an armed platoon or company. Russia In Russia the people eligible for the military funerals are the distinguished veterans honorably discharged from service, servicemen killed in action or otherwise perished during their active service, state dignitaries and some other categories of people who distinguished themselves in state service. The ritual include the honor guard, size of which depends on the deceased rank and status and may wary from merely a squad to a full company, which escorts the departed to the hearse and from the hearse to the grave, with a special detachment to carry the deceased's awards. A military marching band accompanies the funeral procession as well, traditionally playing the \\"How glorious is our Lord\\" (an old Royal anthem from XVIII century) as the body is put on the hearse and the National Anthem of Russia during the salute after the actual burial. On special occasions the garrison commander may authorise the use of a gun carriage (horse or motor drawn at his discretion) instead of a traditional motor hearse (a gun carriage in a Continental style is traditionally used in Russia instead of a caisson preferred in the Anglosphere). A deceased's portrait is carried before the procession, followed by the funerary wreaths and the awards, with the pallbearers following them. All military personnel presented are required to stand at attention as a flag-wrapped casket passes them. Aside from a flag, a land or air forces veteran is buried with his or her regulation cap on the casket, while naval officers are also entitled to their ceremonial dirk and its sheath to be crossed on a casket cover. Russian Orthodox clergy say a memorial player for the deceased serviceman or woman. At the burial ground, the eulogy is first read, the flag is lowered and the band plays the funerary march as the casket is lowered into the grave, after which a three-volley salute is fired with blank rounds, followed by the performance of the national anthem by the band. An artillery gun salute may be authorised for a particularly important funeral for a general or flag officer. Spain In Spain, the formed troops sing \\"La muerte no es el final\\": Death is not the End during funeral ceremonies and in all military ceremonies, when the fallen are being honored. The Spanish Legion has an exception: the regimental hymn Novio de la Muerte (Bridegroom of Death) is played in full instead during occasions that the Legion attends. United Kingdom The British Army carries reversed arms at military funerals. The Last Post and Rouse or Reveille are sounded at the right moment during the rite. United States of America In the United States, the United States Army Military District of Washington (MDW) is responsible for providing military funerals. \\"Honoring Those Who Served\\" is the title of the program for instituting a dignified military funeral with full honors to the nation's veterans. As of January 1, 2000, Section 578 of Public Law 106-65 of the National Defense Authorization Act mandates that the United States Armed Forces shall provide the rendering of honors in a military funeral for any eligible veteran if requested by his or her family. As mandated by federal law, an honor guard detail for the burial of an eligible veteran shall consist of no fewer than two members of the Armed Forces. One member of the detail shall be a representative of the parent armed service of the deceased veteran. The honor guard detail will, at a minimum, perform a ceremony that includes the folding and presenting of the flag of the United States to the next of kin and the playing of \\"Taps\\", which will be played by a lone bugler, if available, or by audio recording. Today, there are so few buglers available that the United States Armed Forces often cannot provide one. However, federal law allows Reserve and National Guard units to assist with funeral honors duty when necessary. On the day of the burial or interment, the U.S. Flag is lowered to half-staff.

They are lined with a synovial membrane that secretes a lubricating synovial fluid. There are more than 150 bursae in the human body. The bursae rest at the points where internal functionaries, such as muscles and tendons, slide across bone. Healthy bursae create a smooth, almost frictionless functional gliding surface making normal movement painless. When bursitis occurs, however, movement relying on the inflamed bursa becomes difficult and painful. Moreover, movement of tendons and muscles over the inflamed bursa aggravates its inflammation, perpetuating the problem. Muscle can also be stiffened. Signs and symptoms 3D still showing Bursitis. Bursitis commonly affects superficial bursae. These include the subacromial, prepatellar, retrocalcaneal, and pes anserinus bursae of the shoulder, knee, heel and shin, etc. (see below). Symptoms vary from localized warmth and erythema to joint pain and stiffness, to stinging pain that surrounds the joint around the inflamed bursa. In this condition, the pain usually is worse during and after activity, and then the bursa and the surrounding joint becomes stiff the next morning. Bursitis could possibly also cause a snapping, grinding or popping sound ‚Äì known as snapping scapula syndrome ‚Äì when it occurs in the shoulder joint. This is not necessarily painful. Cause There can be several concurrent causes. Trauma, auto-immune disorders, infection and iatrogenic (medicine-related) factors can all cause bursitis. Bursitis is commonly caused by repetitive movement and excessive pressure. Shoulders, elbows and knees are the most commonly affected. Inflammation of the bursae may also be caused by other inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and gout. Immune deficiencies, including HIV and diabetes, can also cause bursitis. Infrequently, scoliosis can cause bursitis of the shoulders; however, shoulder bursitis is more commonly caused by overuse of the shoulder joint and related muscles. Traumatic injury is another cause of bursitis. The inflammation irritates because the bursa no longer fits in the original small area between the bone and the functionary muscle or tendon. When the bone increases pressure upon the bursa, bursitis results. Sometimes the cause is unknown. It can also be associated with various other chronic systemic diseases. Diagnosis Types The most common examples of this condition: * Prepatellar bursitis, \\"housemaid's knee\\" * Infrapatellar bursitis, \\"clergyman's knee\\" * Trochanteric bursitis, giving pain over lateral aspect of hip * Olecranon bursitis, \\"student's elbow\\", characterised by pain and swelling in the elbow * Subacromial bursitis, giving shoulder pain, is the most common form of bursitis. * Achilles bursitis * Retrocalcaneal bursitis * Ischial bursitis, \\"weaver's bottom\\" * Iliopsoas bursitis * Anserine bursitis Treatment It is important to differentiate between infected and non- infected bursitis. People may have surrounding cellulitis and systemic symptoms include a fever. The bursa should be aspirated to rule out an infectious process. Bursae that are not infected can be treated symptomatically with rest, ice, elevation, physiotherapy, anti-inflammatory drugs and pain medication. Since bursitis is caused by increased friction from the adjacent structures, a compression bandage is not suggested because compression would create more friction around the joint. Chronic bursitis can be amenable to bursectomy and aspiration. Bursae that are infected require further investigation and antibiotic therapy. Steroid therapy may also be considered. In cases when all conservative treatment fails, surgical therapy may be necessary. In a bursectomy the bursa is cut out either endoscopically or with open surgery. The bursa grows back in place after a couple of weeks but without any inflammatory component.

The presence of a carbuncle is a sign that the immune system is active and fighting the infection. The infection is contagious and may spread to other areas of the body, or other people; those living in the same residence may develop carbuncles at the same time. In the early 21st century, infection involving methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become more common. Signs and symptoms A carbuncle is a cluster of several boils, which is typically filled with purulent exudate (dead neutrophils, phagocytized bacteria, and other cellular components). Fluid may drain freely from the carbuncle, or intervention involving an incision and drainage procedure may be needed. Carbuncles may develop anywhere, but they are most common on the back and the nape of the neck. A carbuncle is palpable and can range in size to be as small as a pea or as large as a golf ball. Surface is red, looking like hot red coal. The surrounding area is indurated. Later, skin on the centre of the carbuncle softens and peripheral satellite vesicles appear, which rupture discharging pus and give rise to cribriform appearance. As the impending infection develops, itching may occur. There may be localized erythema, skin irritation, and the area may be painful when touched. Sometimes more severe symptoms may occur, such as fatigue, fever, chills, and general malaise as the body fights the infection. Cause The initial cause of a carbuncle can often not be determined. Triggers that make carbuncle infections more likely include recent incidence of folliculitis; friction from clothing or shaving; having hair pulled out, such as sites where clothing or furniture grab at hairs; generally poor hygiene; poor nutrition; or weakened immunity.

Removal may be surgical, mechanical, chemical, autolytic (self-digestion), and by maggot therapy. In oral hygiene and dentistry, debridement refers to the removal of plaque and calculus (tartar) that have accumulated on the teeth. Debridement in this case may be performed using ultrasonic instruments, which fracture the calculus, thereby facilitating its removal, as well as hand tools, including periodontal scaler and curettes, or through the use of chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide. In podiatry practitioners such as chiropodists, podiatrists and foot health practitioners remove conditions such as calluses and verrucas. Debridement is an important part of the healing process for burns and other serious wounds; it is also used for treating some kinds of snake and spider bites. Sometimes the boundaries of the problem tissue may not be clearly defined. For example, when excising a tumor, there may be micrometastases along the edges of the tumor that are too small to be detected, but if not removed, could cause a relapse. In such circumstances, a surgeon may opt to debride a portion of the surrounding healthy tissue to ensure that the tumor is completely removed.  Types  There is lack of high quality evidence to compare the effectiveness of various debridement methods on time taken for debridement or time taken for complete healing of wounds.  Surgical debridement  Surgical or \\"sharp\\" debridement and laser debridement under anesthesia are the fastest methods of debridement. They are very selective, meaning that the person performing the debridement has complete control over which tissue is removed and which is left behind. Surgical debridement can be performed in the operating room or bedside, depending on the extent of the necrotic material and a patient's ability to tolerate the procedure. The surgeon will typically debride tissue back to viability, as determined by tissue appearance and the presence of blood flow in healthy tissue.  Autolytic debridement  Autolysis uses the body's own enzymes and moisture to re-hydrate, soften and finally liquefy hard eschar and slough. Autolytic debridement is selective; only necrotic tissue is liquefied. It is also virtually painless for the patient. Autolytic debridement can be achieved with the use of occlusive or semi-occlusive dressings which maintain wound fluid in contact with the necrotic tissue. Autolytic debridement can be achieved with hydrocolloids, hydrogels and transparent films. It is suitable for wounds where the amount of dead tissue is not extensive and where there is no infection.  Enzymatic debridement  Chemical enzymes are fast acting products that slough off necrotic tissue. These enzymes are derived from micro-organisms including Clostridium histolyticum; or from plants, examples include collagenase, varidase, papain, and bromelain. Some of these enzymatic debriders are selective, while some are not. This method works well on wounds (especially burns) with a large amount of necrotic debris or with eschar formation. However, the results are mixed and the effectiveness is variable. Therefore, this type of debridement is used sparingly and is not considered a standard of care for burn treatments.  Mechanical debridement  When removal of tissue is necessary for the treatment of wounds, hydrotherapy which performs selective mechanical debridement can be used. Examples of this include directed wound irrigation and therapeutic irrigation with suction. Baths with whirlpool water flow should not be used to manage wounds because a whirlpool will not selectively target the tissue to be removed and can damage all tissue. Whirlpools also create an unwanted risk of bacterial infection, can damage fragile body tissue, and in the case of treating arms and legs, bring risk of complications from edema. Hydrosurgery uses a high‚Äêpressure, water‚Äêbased jet system to remove burnt skin. This should leave behind the unburned, healthy skin. A 2019 Cochrane systematic review aimed to find out if burns treated with hydrosurgery heal more quickly and with fewer infections than burns treated with a knife. The review authors only found one randomised controlled trial (RCT) with very low certainty evidence that investigated this. Based on this trial, they concluded that it is uncertain whether or not hydrosurgery is better than conventional surgery for early treatment of mid‚Äêdepth burns. More RCTs are needed to fully answer this question. Allowing a dressing to proceed from moist to dry, then manually removing the dressing causes a form of non-selective debridement. This method works best on wounds with moderate amounts of necrotic debris (e.g. \\"dead tissue\\"). Maggot debridement being used on a diabetic foot ulcer.  Maggot therapy  In maggot therapy, a number of small maggots are introduced to a wound in order to consume necrotic tissue, and do so far more precisely than is possible in a normal surgical operation. Larvae of the green bottle fly (Lucilia sericata) are used, which primarily feed on the necrotic (dead) tissue of the living host without attacking living tissue. Maggots can debride a wound in one or two days. The maggots derive nutrients through a process known as \\"extracorporeal digestion\\" by secreting a broad spectrum of proteolytic enzymes that liquefy necrotic tissue, and absorb the semi-liquid result within a few days. In an optimum wound environment maggots molt twice, increasing in length from 1‚Äì2 mm to 8‚Äì10 mm, and in girth, within a period of 3‚Äì4 days by ingesting necrotic tissue, leaving a clean wound free of necrotic tissue when they are removed.

The southern terminus is on the Ohio border, where it continues as State Route 109 (SR 109). The highway passes through communities like Adrian, where it intersects US Highway 223 (US 223), Chelsea and Webberville along its course. It crosses some major rivers, including the River Raisin and the Shiawassee. The section of the highway between M-50 and Manchester was built as a limited- access highway. M-52's northern terminus is at M-46, west of Saginaw. Adrian previously converted their downtown streets to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973. The traffic pattern created an unusual arrangement in the routings of the two state highways downtown. Southbound M-52 followed Winter Street, which also carried both eastbound and westbound directions of the US 223 business loop. These streets carried both highways around the downtown business district in this arrangement until November 2009. M-52 is an original state trunkline highway, dating to the 1919 formation of the system. Other segments of the modern routing were designated M-92 and M-47 at the time. Extensions to M-52 supplanted M-92 completely and M-47 partially along their routings. These extensions completed the modern M-52 routing in the late 1960s. Route description M-52 starts at the Ohio state line as Adrian Highway in Fairfield Township, Lenawee County, where it is the continuation of SR 109 into Michigan. The highway runs north to Adrian where it intersects US Highway 223 (US 223) at the city border with Madison Township. As the highway crosses the city line, it is concurrently designated Business US 223 (Bus. US 223) along Main Street into downtown Adrian. Bus. US 223/M-52 intersects Beecher Street, which carries M-34 to the latter's eastern terminus in Adrian. After Beecher, Main Street turns north-northeast into the downtown area. In downtown Adrian, M-52 runs north along Main Street to Church Street. Since November 2009, the one-way streets were converted back to two-way functionality. Both directions of M-52 now turn east along Church, then north along Broad Street. At Front Street, traffic is diverted west back to Main Street. Continuing north out of downtown Adrian, M-52 follows Main Street over the South Branch of the River Raisin and out of the city limits, where it once again becomes Adrian Highway. The highway curves from running north-northeast back to due north. West of the city of Tecumseh, the trunkline intersects M-50. M-52 continues north as a limited-access highway. Access to and from the highway is limited to select cross roads only. Just south of the county line, the highway intersects with US 12 before crossing into Washtenaw County. M-52 north of I-94 intersection, Chelsea The limited-access section of M-52 continues north through western Washtenaw County, where it ends in Manchester. M-52 turns west along Austin and City roads into the village. The trunkline continues along the banks of the north branch of the River Raisin on Riverside Drive before turning north out of town. Just south of Chelsea, M-52 crosses Interstate 94 (I-94). The highway continues through downtown Chelsea and turns northwesterly through the Waterloo State Recreation Area in the northwesternmost part of the county. The highway clips the corner of Jackson County, running for almost through Waterloo Township before crossing into Ingham County south of Stockbridge. M-52 joins M-106 south of Stockbridge, and the two highways run together into the village. In downtown, M-106 turns east and M-52 turns west before heading north out of town. At the Stockbridge‚ÄìWhite Oak township line, M-52 joins M-36 which follows the townships' common border. The two highways run concurrently north into White Oak Township before M-36 turns west, ending the concurrency. In western Webberville, M-52 passes under I-96 and merges with M-43 at the latter's eastern terminus. The two highways run north to, and turn west along, Grand River Avenue. At Perry Road, M-52 turns back north out of the village. The trunkline continues north into Shiawassee County and runs through Perry before crossing I-69. Continuing north, M-52 curves northeasterly into downtown Owosso intersecting M-21 west of M-71's western terminus. M-52 continues northward parallel to the Shiawassee River into Saginaw County. The trunkline runs through the community of Oakley before intersecting M-57 west of Chesaning. North of Chesaning, M-52 angles to the northeast into and through St. Charles, crossing the Shiawassee River west of the Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge. The northern terminus of M-52 is an intersection with M-46 west of Saginaw in Thomas Township. History M-52 was first designated by July 1, 1919. The original routing started at the Ohio state line and ran north through Adrian to M-50 much as it does today. It turned east along M-50 into Tecumseh and then turned north to Clinton where it terminated. The remainder of the modern highway routing is either not part of the state trunkline system, or it is parts of other highways at this time, M-92 or M-47. In 1954, M-92 was extended southward to end in Clinton at the same intersection with US 112 where M-52 terminated. By July 1, 1960, M-92's southern end was shifted westward, terminating west of Clinton at US 112 on a new roadway south of Manchester. M-52 was extended around 1962 north between M-50 and US 12 (the former US 112) west of Tecumseh and Clinton. This extension ended at M-92's terminus with US 12\\\\. M-52 was then extended north supplanting the M-92 designation in its entirety. M-52 at this time runs north from the Ohio state line to Millville in southwestern Ingham County. In the late 1960s, Stockbridge Road between Webberville and Stockbridge was upgraded to state highway standards and uploaded from the county to the state. This construction was shown on the 1969 state map. When it was completed later that year, M-52 was extended northward a second time, to I-96 outside of Webberville. Where Stockbridge Road crossed I-96, M-52 was continued north, supplanting M-47 through Webberville and north to the junction with M-46 west of Saginaw. This designation change shortened M-47 to its current southern terminus in Saginaw Township. alt=M-52 previously ran along the one-way Main, Church, Broad, Front and Winter streets in downtown Adrian In downtown Adrian, the highways previously split into an uncommon arrangement of one-way streets. This arrangement was similar to a traffic circle in how the traffic was routed through the central business district on Church, Broad, Front and Winter streets. The first one-way pairing started on Main Street at the intersection with Winter Street. Northbound traffic continued on Main Street, while southbound traffic was routed along Winter Street. At Church Street, westbound Bus. US 223/northbound M-52 turned east for a block on Church and then north onto Broad Street. Then the highway designations continued on Broad Street three blocks north to Front Street, passing to the east of the downtown businesses. The designations were then routed west along Front Street. At Main Street, M-52 turned back north again as a two-way street. In the opposite direction, southbound M-52 traffic was diverted from Main west on Front Street. Front Street west of Main Street carried southbound M-52 and westbound Bus. US 223 traffic one block west to Winter Street, which then turned down Winter. Westbound Bus. US 223 traffic turned west along Maumee Street while eastbound Bus. US 223 followed southbound M-52 down Winter to Main Street. This arrangement was ended in November 2009 when the City of Adrian converted all of the one-way streets to two-way traffic. Downtown streets had been converted to one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973.

He was the fourth president and chief executive officer (CEO) of Nintendo. He was a major contributor in broadening the appeal of video games by focusing on novel and entertaining games rather than top-of-the-line hardware. Born in Sapporo, Japan, Iwata expressed interest in video games from an early age and created his first simple game while in high school. He majored in computer science at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. In 1980, he joined the game developer HAL Laboratory while attending the university. At HAL, he worked as a programmer and closely collaborated with Nintendo, producing his first commercial game in 1983. Games to which he contributed include EarthBound and the Kirby series. Following a downturn and near- bankruptcy, Iwata became the president of HAL in 1993 at the insistence of Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi and brought financial stability. In the following years, he worked in the development of the Pok√©mon and Super Smash Bros. series. Iwata joined Nintendo as the head of its corporate planning division in 2000. Nintendo saw growth under Iwata and, when Yamauchi retired, he became the company's president in May 2002. Under Iwata's direction, Nintendo developed the Nintendo DS and Wii game consoles, helping the company achieve financial success. As a self-declared gamer, he focused on expanding the appeal of video games across demographics through a \\"blue ocean\\" business strategy. Nintendo attained record profits by 2009, and Barron's placed Iwata among the top 30 CEOs worldwide. Iwata expanded his strategy by defining a quality-of-life product line for the Wii that evolved into a ten-year strategy to create standalone products. Later hardware such as the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U proved far less profitable than the Wii, and Nintendo's net sales fell by two thirds from 2009 to 2012; the company saw its first operating losses in 30 years during this time. Iwata voluntarily halved his salary in 2011 and 2014. In 2015, after several years of refusal, Iwata put a portion of Nintendo's focus into the rapidly growing mobile game market; a landmark partnership with mobile provider DeNA was established that March. Throughout his career, Iwata built a relationship with Nintendo fans through social media and his regular appearances in Iwata Asks and Nintendo Direct, becoming the public face of the company. In June 2014, a tumor in Iwata's bile duct was discovered during a routine physical exam. It was removed, and Iwata returned to work in October of that year. The problem resurfaced in 2015, and Iwata died at the age of 55 from its complications on July 11. Members of the gaming industry and fans alike offered tributes through public announcements and social media, and fans worldwide established temporary memorials. Iwata was posthumously awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2015 Golden Joystick Awards and the 2016 D.I.C.E. Awards. Early life alt=A Commodore PET 2001 model personal computer Satoru Iwata was born on December 6, 1959, and raised in Sapporo, Japan, where his father served as a prefectural official. Throughout middle and high school, Iwata displayed leadership skills through service as class president, student council president, and club president at various times. His first experience with computers was in middle school with a demo computer that used telephone lines. Iwata would frequent the Sapporo subway and play a simple numeric game, called Game 31, until he mastered it. With money saved up from a dish-washing job and some additional allowance from his father, Iwata purchased an HP-65, the first programmable calculator, in 1974. After entering Hokkaido Sapporo South High School in April 1975, he began developing his own games during his junior year. The several simple number games Iwata produced, such as Volleyball and Missile Attack, made use of an electronic calculator he shared with his schoolmates. He obtained his first computer, a Commodore PET, in 1978. He dismantled and studied the machine out of his desire to understand it. The computer coincidentally had a central processing unit (MOS 6502) similar to the one used by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), a gaming console for which he would later develop games. Following high school, Iwata was admitted to the Tokyo Institute of Technology in April 1978, where he majored in computer science. Tomohiko Uematsu, an engineering professor, noted Iwata's proficiency with software programming and remarked that Iwata could write programs faster and more accurately than any of his other students. While attending the school, he was one of several unpaid interns at Commodore Japan, assisting the subsidiary's head engineer‚ÄîYash Terakura‚Äîwith technical and software-development tasks. One of his main reasons for taking the job was to spend more time around computers and learn of details not openly available to the public. Terakura would later serve as a mentor to Iwata, teaching him about hardware engineering to supplement Iwata's already extensive software knowledge. Iwata and several of his friends rented an apartment in Akihabara and soon formed a club where they would create and code games. Classmates living in nearby apartments referred to Iwata's room as \\"Game Center Iwata\\". He would frequently show off his games to the Seibu department store's computer department, and by 1980 a group of employees there invited him to join their company, HAL Laboratory, Inc. HAL Laboratory While attending university, Iwata worked for HAL Laboratory as a part-time programmer in 1980. Among their first creations was a peripheral device that enabled older computers to display graphics for video games. With this device, Iwata and members of HAL created multiple games that were \\"straight rip-offs of Namco‚Äôs Rally-X, Galaxian, and others\\". Despite this, HAL became the first company to establish a license with Namco for developing games. He joined the company in a full-time capacity after graduating in 1982, becoming its fifth employee and only programmer. Around the same time, Iwata's father was elected mayor of Muroran. Despite his passion, Iwata's family did not approve of his career choice, and his father did not talk with him for six months after Iwata joined HAL. Iwata became the company's coordinator of software production in 1983, the time during which he helped HAL create a relationship with Nintendo so they would be able to produce games for its newly released Nintendo Entertainment System. He traveled to Kyoto himself to request permission to work on games for the NES, to which Nintendo obliged. His first commercially published game was Joust for the NES‚Äîa port of the 1982 arcade game. Other video games he worked on were Balloon Fight, NES Open Tournament Golf, EarthBound, and the Kirby games. Nintendo initially contacted several other developers to produce Open Tournament Golf; however, all of them declined as they did not believe the large amount of data could be stored within an NES cartridge. Iwata seized this opportunity and \\"recklessly\\" stepped up to develop the game. It proved particularly taxing as Iwata had to create his own data compression method in order to fit all 18 courses into the game. Similarly, HAL had to program parallax scrolling for F-1 Race as the NES hardware did not initially support it. Iwata's proficiency with programming quickly placed him in high esteem among fellow programmers and gamers alike. He would often continue to work on weekends and holidays because of his passion. With the company on the verge of bankruptcy, Iwata was promoted to president of HAL in 1993 at the insistence of Nintendo's then-President, Hiroshi Yamauchi. With assistance from Nintendo, Iwata helped turn the company around from its ¬•1.5 billion debt and stabilize its finances within six years. Lacking experience in management, Iwata put a lot of effort into learning how to better himself, often reading books on the topic and seeking advice from others. Although he was not part of Nintendo at the time, Iwata assisted in the development of Pok√©mon Gold and Silver, which were released for the Game Boy Color in November 1999, by creating a set of compression tools utilized for graphics in the games. While working as a go-between for Game Freak and Nintendo, he aided in the programming of Pok√©mon Stadium for the Nintendo 64 by reading the original coding in Pok√©mon Red and Green and porting the battle system into the new game in just one week. According to Tsunekazu Ishihara, the president of The Pok√©mon Company, Iwata was instrumental in bringing Pok√©mon to Western markets. While being president of HAL, he developed the plan for localization after reviewing the code for Red and Green, which was then completed by Teruki Murakawa, with the Western releases coming two years after their Japanese release. Additionally, he assisted Masahiro Sakurai in the development of Super Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64. Nintendo Early years (2000‚Äì02) In 2000, Iwata took a position at Nintendo as the head of its corporate planning division and took a seat on the board of directors. Over the next two years, he sought to reduce the cost and length of game development while preserving quality. During his first two years at Nintendo, the company saw profit increases of 20 and 41 percent, values which are at least partially attributable to his work. When Yamauchi, the company's president since 1949, retired on May 24, 2002, Iwata succeeded as Nintendo's fourth president with Yamauchi's blessing. He was the first Nintendo president unrelated to the Yamauchi family through blood or marriage since its founding in 1889. Yamauchi left the company in Iwata's hands with a final request: \\"that Nintendo give birth to wholly new ideas and create hardware which reflects that ideal. And make software that adheres to that same standard.\\" Iwata inherited a company that promoted individualism, with a policy established by Yamauchi to create new development positions as needed. However, this inhibited efficient collaboration between certain departments. At the time of Iwata's promotion, Nintendo, though still a profitable company, was not performing as well as other console makers. The recently released GameCube was performing poorly compared to competitors, with Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox outselling it. His presidency also came at the onset of the popularization of online gaming, and Nintendo had yet to move into this facet of the market. He took a cautious approach to the issue, stating: \\"We're not negative toward the idea of going online. We're just practical.\\" He also fostered a relationship between Nintendo and Capcom that improved the GameCube's appeal. During an interview in 2002, Iwata stated that he felt the gaming industry was becoming too exclusive, and he wanted to develop hardware and games that would appeal to all players rather than focusing on top of the line graphics. One of his first actions as president was to meet directly with the company's 40 department heads and 150 other employees. This contrasted starkly with Yamauchi's practice of rarely meeting with employees and generally having a single, annual speech. Shigeru Miyamoto described the previous business atmosphere as \\"stuffy\\" and stated Iwata \\"improved the ventilation\\". Iwata was acutely aware that his position as president would not ensure compliance from his employees and sought to communicate with them on a personal level. If employees disagreed with his view, Iwata would suggest they follow their idea instead of his own, stating \\"creators only improve themselves by taking risks\\". Alongside the increased level of interaction, Iwata also brought more data and science into the business aspect of the company. Whereas Yamauchi made decisions based on intuition and experience, Iwata brought forth hypotheses loaded with data to convey his position. Iwata also promoted Miyamoto, Genyo Takeda, Yoshihiro Mori, and Shinji Hatano to representative directors on the company's board of directors, equaling his own position. Revitalization of the company (2003‚Äì09) Following up on his 2002 interview, Iwata highlighted an urgency in the gaming market in his keynote speech at the 2003 Tokyo Game Show. During this speech, he reflected on the history of the industry and concluded with the declining interest in video games. A slump in sales in the Japanese market had begun at the end of the 1990s and continued into the early 2000s. Competition between Nintendo and Sony resulted in increasingly hardware-heavy consoles; however, the Nintendo 64 proved to be too cumbersome for developers and software suffered severely. After a year-long analysis conducted at Iwata's behest, Nintendo concluded that pushing hardware was not the most effective way to promote video games and decided to focus on software. A major internal reorganization of Nintendo took place in 2004, with Iwata consolidating various departments established under Yamauchi. He sought to promote collaborative work throughout the company. He later established a \\"User Expansion Project\\" in 2005 whereby employees normally not associated with game development would submit ideas for new games. In a March 2004 interview, Iwata stated: \\"Games have come to a dead end.\\" He stressed that developers wasted far too much time focusing on core gamers and would be unable to turn a profit if they did not tend to the average game player. Furthermore, he wished to prove that Nintendo, considered a \\"conservative\\" company at the time, would become a forefront innovator of entertainment. Iwata articulated a \\"blue ocean\\" strategy to help Nintendo successfully compete against the other console manufacturers. Instead of competing on technical specifications, Iwata drew on his previous experience as a game developer to produce novel and entertaining hardware and games. =Nintendo DS= Iwata helped lead a revitalization of Nintendo's handheld business by transitioning the company from the Game Boy Advance to the Nintendo DS, which sported a unique form factor and inclusion of a touchscreen that allowed for novel games. The idea for using two screens on a single device originated with Yamauchi before his retirement, while Miyamoto suggested the use of a touchscreen. Miyamoto subsequently spearheaded development of the device and its prototypes. The Nintendo DS proved to be a highly profitable system and went on to become the second-best selling video game console of all time with more than 154 million units, inclusive of subsequent iterations, sold by September 2014. In June 2004, Iwata sought a conference with Dr. Ryuta Kawashima about a game that could appeal to non-gamers. This project would later become Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!, released in May 2005. Iwata personally oversaw development of the Brain Age series, even foregoing a public appearance on the day of the Nintendo DS's release in Japan on December 2. Miyamoto supported Iwata's work with the series and sent one of his prot√©g√©s, Kouichi Kawamoto, to help develop the game. The Brain Age series is partially credited with launching the popularity of the Nintendo DS, and the series as a whole sold over 30 million copies by December 2008. Subsequent iterations of the Nintendo DS, the DS Lite and DSi, also saw positive sales. The DS Lite improved upon the original DS, featuring brighter screens and a slimmer design in accordance with consumer demand. Released in March 2006 in Japan and three months later worldwide, the DS Lite ultimately sold nearly 94 million units. Statistics showed that households often shared a single DS, and Iwata sought to expand this from one per household to one per person. The console's third iteration, the DSi, embodies this idea with the \\"i\\" representing a single person. Despite concerns that the video game market was already over saturated by the DS and DS Lite, Iwata was confident that the DSi would sell, especially in European markets. The DSi built upon the success of the DS Lite by similarly meeting consumer demand. In addition to being slimmed further, the DSi featured two cameras, SD card support, an audio reader, and the \\"Nintendo DSi Shop\\". The relatively quick succession of the DS Lite and DSi broke the conventional pattern for release of game systems, each being released roughly 18 months apart instead of 5 years. Iwata saw the gradual price drop in the five-year cycle as a way of indirectly telling consumers to wait to purchase products and a punishment for those who bought it at launch. He sought to alleviate this issue with the quick releases. =Wii= Discussions between Iwata, Miyamoto, and Takeda about a new home console began in the first half of 2003. With encouragement from Yamauchi, Iwata pushed for development of a revolutionary product that would later become the Wii. Iwata subsequently assigned Takeda to the project, \\"telling [Takeda] to go off the tech roadmap\\". The overall premise was that \\"a Mom has to like it\\". During the console's development process Iwata challenged engineers to make the Wii no thicker than three DVD cases stacked together, a feat they ultimately accomplished. Takeda and his team focused on reducing power consumption while retaining or improving levels of performance shown with the GameCube. Alongside the internal hardware designed by Nintendo's engineers, Iwata proposed that the console abandon use of a typical controller to make gaming more accessible to everyone. Miyamoto took the lead on developing a new controller while Takeda's team provided the internal components. After six months and dozens of scrapped prototypes, Takeda procured a CMOS sensor that later became the core aspect of the remote. With the addition of accelerometers, they were able to effectively produce motion controls. Initially codenamed \\"Revolution\\" during a teaser at E3 2004, following Iwata's goal of creating a gaming revolution, Iwata publicly revealed the Wii at E3 2005, holding it above his head to emphasize its small size and light weight design. Reveal of the Wii's signature Wii Remote controller was withheld until the Tokyo Game Show in September 2005. During his speech at the conference, Iwata reiterated his stance on growing the gaming market but expanded upon it by emphasizing the need to make controls less complicated. The controller's remote control design partially stemmed from Iwata's desire to have a device that was \\"immediately accessible\\" to all. He also insisted that the Wii Remote be referred to as simply a \\"remote\\" rather than a controller to emphasize its accessibility to anyone. The Wii ultimately popularized the use of motion control-based video games and proved highly successful for Nintendo, helping to nearly double the company's stock price. Tapping into the market of casual players, the Wii marked \\"a breakthrough moment in the history of video games\\": a new genre of gaming was established for the family market. Iwata's former experience as a programmer, a rarity for technology CEOs, was said to help contribute towards his leadership of the company. By the end of the 2009 fiscal year, Nintendo saw record net sales and profit of ¬•1.8 trillion (US$18.7 billion) and ¬•279 billion (US$2.8 billion), respectively. Due to his success, Barron's included Iwata on their list of the 30 top CEOs worldwide from 2007 to 2009. =Quality of life products= Players of Pok√©mon Go gathered around a \\"virtual\\" Pok√©mon gym in Brest, France. Social interactions outside homes like this was one of the goals of Iwata's quality-of-life initiative. Starting with the introduction of the Wii in 2006, Iwata placed focus on development of products that improved quality of life. The Wii Fit series, conceptualized by Miyamoto, epitomized this movement. At E3 2009, Iwata revealed development of an add-on product to the Wii: the Wii Vitality Sensor. The device measured autonomic nerve functions, namely pulse, and incorporate acquired data into relaxation products. Iwata saw the device as a continuation of the \\"blue ocean\\" strategy previously articulated. He indicated that the market of motion controls was turning into a \\"red ocean\\", whereby too many companies would saturate the market and restrict profits. The Vitality Sensor was developed in hopes of providing a novel way to interact with video games and continue Nintendo's history of innovation. However, testing of a prototype device yielded less than desirable results and Nintendo had postponed the release of the product indefinitely by 2013. In January 2014, Iwata unveiled a ten-year strategy for the company based on quality-of-life products. The target was a new market outside video games. Developed under partnerships with Dr. Yasuyoshi Watanabe and ResMed, the first device in this initiative was a fatigue and sleep deprivation sensor announced in October 2014. Unlike the Vitality Sensor, the sleep sensor was to be a stand-alone product that would not need to be worn. Following Iwata's death in July 2015, analysts questioned whether Nintendo would continue the quality-of-life initiative. Despite a planned United States release in March 2016, some suggested the product had been temporarily shelved, while others believed the product had been indefinitely postponed like the Vitality Sensor before it. The device was formally discontinued by February 2016; however, Tatsumi Kimishima stated that research into quality of life products would continue. Nintendo-based products like the Nintendo Switch designed to encourage use on the go and social interactions, the mobile augmented reality game Pok√©mon Go that requires travelling outside the house, and its addition Pok√©mon Sleep that works based on a player's sleep patterns, all represent continuations of Iwata's quality-of-life initiative. The Switch game Ring Fit Adventure, which includes accessories that let players manipulate the game through physical exercise, is seen as a successor to Wii Fit and continuing the quality-of-life program. Financial downturn (2010‚Äì14) Subsequent hardware units under Iwata's tenure, including the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, were not as successful as the DS and Wii, and Nintendo's finances took a downward turn starting in 2010. During the development phase of the 3DS, a handheld device featuring stereoscopic 3D without the need of accessories, Iwata stated that his background in technology helped keep Nintendo's engineers in line. It was hoped that the successor to the Nintendo DS would reinvigorate the company after profits began declining. However, weak sales upon the release of the Nintendo 3DS caused the company's stock to fall by 12 percent on July 29, 2011. The console's poor sales prompted a price cut in August from its launch price of US$250 to US$170. Sales of the 3DS continually fell below expectations. Iwata later admitted in 2014 that he had misread the market and had not appropriately accounted for changing lifestyles since the launch of the Wii. He continually placed focus on family-oriented games despite declining popularity. The Wii U, released in November 2012, was sold below its production cost as Nintendo hoped for stronger software sales to alleviate ongoing losses. The addition of HD graphics, a feature not present in the original Wii, placed unexpected strain on development teams and led to software delays. Compounding the frustration of consumers was Iwata's disinterest in competitors such as Microsoft and Sony, both of which experienced similar issues during the releases of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 respectively. Paul Tassi of Forbes claimed that Nintendo could have handled the change more efficiently by drawing lessons from Microsoft and Sony's transition to HD graphics. The console ultimately failed to meet sales expectations and became the slowest-selling Nintendo platform, with 9.5 million units sold by June 2015. Miyamoto attributed the lackluster sales to public misunderstandings of the console's concept and functionality. Iwata later admitted the console to be a failure as a successor to the Wii, with games being unable to showcase notable originality in the Wii U. The back-to- back failures of the 3DS and Wii U prompted Mitsushige Akino of Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. to suggest that Iwata should resign from his position. Nintendo's overall net sales declined from its peak of ¬•1.8 trillion (US$18.7 billion) in 2009 to ¬•549 billion (US$4.6 billion) in 2015. Net income losses were incurred in 2012 and 2014. In 2010, Nintendo revealed that Iwata earned a modest salary of ¬•68 million (US$770,000), which increased to ¬•187 million (US$2.11 million) with performance based bonuses. In comparison, Miyamoto earned a salary of ¬•100 million (US$1.13 million). Iwata voluntarily halved his salary in 2011 and 2014 as apologies for the poor sales while other members of the Nintendo board of directors had pay cuts of 20‚Äì30 percent. This also served to ensure the job security of Nintendo's employees, preventing workers from being laid off in order to improve short-term finances. In 2012, the company experienced its first operating loss since entering the video game market more than 30 years earlier. Losses continued for the next two years before the company finally returned to profitability at the end of the 2015 fiscal year. The slight turnaround was largely attributed to blockbuster games such as Pok√©mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire and Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. In June 2013, Iwata took on the additional role of Nintendo of America's CEO. As one of his first changes as CEO, Iwata decided that they would not hold large press conferences at E3, and instead have several smaller events, each aimed at a certain demographic. While traveling to Tokyo in late 2013, Iwata sketched an idea for a series of physical toys that could connect with Nintendo's games. This concept soon developed into the Amiibo line of figures which launched less than a year later. Amiibo proved to be a huge success, with more than 6 million figurines sold by the end of 2014, roughly a month after launch. By March 2016, combined sales of figures and cards‚Äîa product released in 2015‚Äîexceeded 64 million units, proving financially beneficial across all Nintendo platforms. Mobile market and Switch (2015) The Nintendo Switch in its handheld form with the Joy-Con controllers attached In early 2010, the success of Apple Inc.'s mobile App Store prompted concern among game developers that the medium was shifting to smart devices. That July, Iwata acknowledged competition from Apple and considered them the \\"enemy of the future\\". However, during an interview the following year, Iwata appeared entirely against the idea of Nintendo moving into the mobile market, claiming the company would \\"cease to be Nintendo\\" if they did so. He reasoned that mobile gaming would lack integrity over the quality of games in an effort to turn a profit. A slow shift in this view ensued over the following years as the mobile gaming market continued to grow. In 2012 he acknowledged that mobile devices provided significant competition but remained confident in his company's abilities. In a message to shareholders in March 2014 fiscal year, Iwata stated, \\"‚Ä¶ I believe that the era has ended when people play all kinds of games only on dedicated gaming systems.\\" He cited the convenience of mobile devices for quick entertainment and expansive capabilities over a handheld console's dedicated software. Criticism arose over his continued stubbornness in moving to the mobile market, with analysts and investors continually requesting a change in outlook. Yoshihisa Toyosaki, president of Architect Grand Design Inc., claimed that \\"Nintendo is out of touch\\", referring to the company's history of ignoring outside input. This ultimately negatively influenced Nintendo's finances and popularity to a degree. In March 2015, Iwata put part of Nintendo's focus on the growing mobile game market, creating a landmark partnership with mobile provider DeNA to publish games, as traditional hardware console sales began to falter. This came in contrast to Nintendo's previous business model which put focus on console exclusives to prompt people to buy their platforms. Iwata emphasized that although Nintendo IPs would be utilized in mobile games, the company would not compromise their integrity. He also stressed that the main goal would be to reach as many people as possible rather than which options would earn the most money, similar to the idea behind the Wii. After the partnership with DeNA was established, Iwata reiterated his stance that the common free-to-play type mobile games, which he referred to as \\"free-to-start\\", threatened the future quality of games. Although he acknowledged the practice as a viable means of promoting games in the short-term, he considered the model outdated and not a sound direction for core development. He also emphasized that the business model for these games did not match with the core values of Nintendo and could not serve as the basis of \\"long-lasting relationship with [Nintendo's] customers\\". Iwata oversaw development of the Nintendo Switch through the final months of his life, serving as the console's head developer. In a February 2017 interview with the magazine Time, Miyamoto believed Iwata's goal for the system was to make it portable and allow communication between people. Iwata focused on the technical aspects of the device during this stage. Public relations Iwata was well known for incorporating his humor into his Nintendo Direct videos, such as during a pre-recorded video shown at alt=refer to caption During the earlier years of his presidency at Nintendo, Iwata would often forego media appearances, unless new hardware was being announced, in order to spend more time programming. However, his attitude towards this changed, and he eventually became a prominent part of Nintendo's public relations. Iwata helped Nintendo to improve relations with its fans by regularly responding to them through social media, and he shared insights on Nintendo's employees, games, and hardware through his interview series Iwata Asks. Inspiration for this series, which began in September 2006, stemmed from Iwata's background as a game programmer and his curiosity of the mindset of other developers. These interviews often showcased the friendly camaraderie between Iwata and other members of Nintendo as jokes and laughter were commonplace. They also revealed a different side of the normally secretive Nintendo: openness to discuss some of the inner workings of the company. In 2011, Iwata helped to institute Nintendo Direct, a series of online press conferences open to all that revealed upcoming Nintendo games and products outside of typical industry channels. These videos were often quirky and humorous, reflecting the personality of Iwata himself. This stood completely against the generally serious tones displayed by Sony and Microsoft. One such video displayed a mock battle between him and Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aim√© to showcase the inclusion of Mii characters, Nintendo digital avatars, in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. These frequently spurred the creation of Internet memes; such memes include the phrase \\"please understand\\" which was often used by Iwata for delays or other negative news, adding \\"[Iwata laughs]\\" to forum posts as a reference to his frequent laughter in segments of Iwata Asks, and images of Iwata staring silently at a bunch of bananas as part of a pre-recorded E3 2012 video to promote the Donkey Kong franchise. As a byproduct of his presence in Iwata Asks and Nintendo Direct, Iwata became the public face of Nintendo. Iwata enjoyed conversing with reporters and would prepare stories in advance to entertain them. Even when time did not allow, he would mingle with interviewers and chat casually. Other projects Iwata assisted in the founding of Creatures Inc. and The Pok√©mon Company which were established in 1995 and 1998, respectively, by Tsunekazu Ishihara. Iwata later coordinated licensing changes domestically and internationally with The Pok√©mon Company when it became its own entity. In 1998, Iwata helped his colleague and personal friend Shigesato Itoi establish Hobonichi by working as the company's IT Manager. He acquired this position after being asked by Itoi one month prior to the June 6 launch date to arrange a website and the company's technical systems, to which Iwata complied. Iwata personally enjoyed the role and even still held the position in 2007, despite running Nintendo full-time by this point. Soon after his promotion to president of Nintendo, Iwata assigned himself to a development team at HAL Laboratory working on Super Smash Bros. Melee, for the GameCube, to continue his programming passion. Stemming from his work with the Brain Age series, Iwata assisted in producing educational games such as Kanji Sonomama Rakubiki Jiten DS, English Training: Have Fun Improving Your Skills!, and Imasara Hito ni Kikenai Otona no Joushikiryoku Training DS. He also worked on Animal Crossing, Mario, Metroid Prime, and 'The Legend of Zelda' series of games, among others. He also had a cameo in WarioWare: Smooth Moves. Iwata partook in the development of Pok√©mon Go, an augmented reality mobile game, starting in 2013. The game was publicly revealed in September 2015, two months after his death. Illness and death Fans left memorabilia and personalized artwork of various Nintendo video game series, including Mario, Kirby, and The Legend of Zelda, dedicated to Iwata at a memorial in the alt=refer to caption On June 5, 2014, Nintendo announced that Iwata would not attend E3 2014 due to medical problems. Iwata issued a public message to shareholders on June 24 that he had undergone surgery the previous week to remove a tumor in his bile duct discovered during a routine physical examination. After roughly four months of recovery from a successful surgery, he returned to work in October. During this time he lost a notable amount of weight, but stated he was feeling healthier as a result. Iwata made his first public appearance on a Nintendo Direct announcement on November 5, but looked \\"gaunt and pale\\". He appeared to take this in stride and updated his own Mii, avatars used in Nintendo hardware, in June 2015 to reflect his slimmer self. On January 28, 2015, Iwata came down with a high fever and was suspected to have influenza; a meeting with shareholders was postponed accordingly. Some time after attending a different shareholder meeting on June 26, Iwata became ill again and was hospitalized. Despite his hospitalization, Iwata continued to work via his laptop in his bed and provided feedback on Pok√©mon Go to Tsunekazu Ishihara. He died due to complications from the tumor on July 11 at the age of 55. Nintendo announced his death the following day. Flags at Nintendo's headquarters were lowered to half-staff on July 13. Nintendo's regional offices took a day of silence on July 13 across all of its social media accounts in remembrance of Iwata. Members of the gaming industry and fans alike expressed their sadness on social media over Iwata's death and gratitude for his accomplishments. Fans established memorials across the world, including at the Japanese Embassy in Moscow, Russia, and the Nintendo World Store in Manhattan, New York. Shuhei Yoshida, president of SCE Worldwide Studios, stated: \\"I pray that Mr. Iwata, who contributed so much to the development of the gaming industry, rests in peace.\\" Composer and director Junichi Masuda, most known for his work with the Pok√©mon games, tweeted: \\"He was a man who understood Pok√©mon, and a great leader. When I visited the other day, he was well. I will pray for his soul from the bottom of my heart.\\" The Tokyo Institute of Technology issued a memorial statement on August 4, with Iwata's former classmates and professors contributing their memories. At The Game Awards 2015, Reggie Fils-Aim√© delivered a tribute to Iwata, describing him as \\"fearless\\" and \\"unique, in the fullest meaning of the word\\". Several hours after the announcement of Iwata's death, a photograph of a rainbow over Nintendo's headquarters in Kyoto was posted to Twitter and widely shared; it was dubbed \\"the Rainbow Road to heaven\\", in reference to a stage in the Mario Kart series. Funeral services for Iwata were held in Kyoto on July 16 and 17. Despite stormy weather produced by Typhoon Nangka, an estimated 4,100 people attended to pay their respects. Following the wake, Iwata's remains were cremated and his ashes were buried at an undisclosed place in Kyoto. Following Iwata's death, general directors Shigeru Miyamoto and Genyo Takeda temporarily managed the company together. On September 14, Nintendo announced that Tatsumi Kimishima, head of its Human Resources Division and former CEO of Nintendo of America, would succeed Iwata as the fifth president of Nintendo. Influence and legacy Throughout his life, Iwata was known for unconventional ideas and changing the medium of gaming. He was seen as the embodiment of Nintendo: playful, quirky, humorous, and fun. Iwata's proficiency in programming led many to refer to him as a \\"genius\\" in the subject, with some likening him to a Japanese Bill Gates. His hands-on approach to business earned him admiration and respect from both developers and gamers. The opening to Iwata's \\"Heart of a Gamer\\" speech at GDC 2005 is regarded as the \\"essence\\" of who he was: a humble businessman dedicated to video games. He, alongside others at Nintendo such as Miyamoto, are credited with vastly expanding the gaming market and creating a new genre. By targeting a new audience instead of competing against Microsoft and Sony, Iwata avoided a \\"straight fight\\" with Nintendo's competitors and successfully achieved his goals. Accordingly, Iwata was referred to as a \\"gentle revolutionary\\". The simplistic appeal of the Nintendo DS and Wii served to expand the market. Chris Kohler of Wired magazine stated that \\"thanks to Nintendo's Satoru Iwata, we're all gamers now,\\" referring to the surge in video game popularity following the releases of the Nintendo DS and Wii. Although widely respected, he received criticism over his stubbornness in moving Nintendo to the mobile market. Following Iwata's death, Reggie Fils- Aim√© remarked, \\"... it will be years before his impact on both Nintendo and the full video game industry will be fully appreciated.\\" In October 2015, a fan-made Amiibo featuring Iwata's Mii avatar was crafted and auctioned for US$1,900 on eBay; all proceeds were to be donated to the Child's Play charity in his memory. Iwata was posthumously and unanimously granted the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2015 Golden Joystick Awards for his influence across the gaming industry. Iwata was also posthumously granted the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2016 DICE Awards. At the 2016 Game Developers Choice Awards, Iwata was honored with a short animated film by David Hellman, the artist who worked on Braid. In July 2019, Hobonichi published a book, , by Yasuda Nagata in Japan. The book includes excerpts from many Iwata Asks interviews and interviews with Iwata's closest friends, including Shigeru Miyamoto and Shigesato Itoi, after his death. In response to public demand, the agency is planning to localize the book in multiple languages with the Tuttle-Mori Agency. Viz Media will publish the title as Ask Iwata in North America in early 2021. Video game tributes A tribute in honor of Iwata, reading \\"This game is dedicated to our wingman who fell in battle\\", was placed at the end of the credits for Star Fox Zero. Another speculated tribute appears in the Nintendo Switch 2017 launch game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, a game in development at the time of his death. A non-playable character, who bears a striking resemblance to Satoru Iwata, asks for the player to go atop Satori Mountain in search of the mystical Lord of the Mountain. Given the similarity between \\"Satori\\" and \\"Satoru\\" and the fact that the Lord of the Mountain is seen as a guiding spirit, the quest is thought to be an elaborate tribute to Iwata. In September 2017, modders discovered that an emulated version of the NES game Golf, which Iwata programmed, is included in every Nintendo Switch console's firmware, and can be accessed by moving the Joy-Con controllers similarly to how Iwata would move his hands in Nintendo Direct presentations when the system clock is set to July 11, the day of his death; this appeared to be removed by Nintendo with a system update issued later that year. Within Pok√©mon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, visiting the Game Freak building with Pok√©mon introduced in Pok√©mon Gold and Silver has a non- player character relate how they were having trouble getting data onto the Game Boy Color game cards until they were helped by an \\"amazing guy\\"; this acknowledges Iwata's contribution to Gold and Silver that allowed them to include the whole of the world from Pok√©mon Red and Blue without compromising the size of the Gold/Silver world.

The earliest observations on the reactions of high-frequency electromagnetic currents upon the human organism were made by Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval. The field was pioneered in 1907 by German physician Karl Franz Nagelschmidt, who coined the term diathermy from the Greek words dia and Œ∏Œ≠œÅŒºŒ∑ therma, literally meaning \\"heating through\\" (adj., diather¬¥mal, diather¬¥mic). Diathermy is commonly used for muscle relaxation, and to induce deep heating in tissue for therapeutic purposes in medicine. It is used in physical therapy to deliver moderate heat directly to pathologic lesions in the deeper tissues of the body. Diathermy is produced by three techniques: ultrasound (ultrasonic diathermy), short-wave radio frequencies in the range 1‚Äì100 MHz (shortwave diathermy) or microwaves typically in the 915 MHz or 2.45 GHz bands (microwave diathermy), the methods differing mainly in their penetration capability. It exerts physical effects and elicits a spectrum of physiological responses. The same techniques are also used to create higher tissue temperatures to destroy neoplasms (cancer and tumors), warts, and infected tissues; this is called hyperthermia treatment. In surgery diathermy is used to cauterize blood vessels to prevent excessive bleeding. The technique is particularly valuable in neurosurgery and surgery of the eye. History The idea that high- frequency electromagnetic currents could have therapeutic effects was explored independently around the same time (1890‚Äì1891) by French physician and biophysicist Jacques Arsene d'Arsonval and Serbian American engineer Nikola Tesla.J. W. Hand,\\"Biophysics and Technology of Electromagnetic Hyperthermia\\" in d'Arsonval had been studying medical applications for electricity in the 1880s and performed the first systematic studies in 1890 of the effect of alternating current on the body, and discovered that frequencies above 10 kHz did not cause the physiological reaction of electric shock, but warming., translated by J. H. Kellogg He also developed the three methods that have been used to apply high-frequency current to the body: contact electrodes, capacitive plates, and inductive coils. Nikola Tesla first noted around 1891 the ability of high-frequency currents to produce heat in the body and suggested its use in medicine. By 1900 application of high-frequency current to the body was used experimentally to treat a wide variety of medical conditions in the new medical field of electrotherapy. In 1899 Austrian chemist von Zaynek determined the rate of heat production in tissue as a function of frequency and current density, and first proposed using high- frequency currents for deep heating therapy. In 1908 German physician Karl Franz Nagelschmidt coined the term diathermy, and performed the first extensive experiments on patients. Nagelschmidt is considered the founder of the field. He wrote the first textbook on diathermy in 1913, which revolutionized the field. Until the 1920s noisy spark-discharge Tesla coil and Oudin coil machines were used. These were limited to frequencies of 0.1 - 2 MHz, called \\"longwave\\" diathermy. The current was applied directly to the body with contact electrodes, which could cause skin burns. In the 1920s the development of vacuum tube machines allowed frequencies to be increased to 10 - 300 MHz, called \\"shortwave\\" diathermy. The energy was applied to the body with inductive coils of wire or capacitive plates insulated from the body, which reduced the risk of burns. By the 1940s microwaves were being used experimentally. Uses Shortwave diathermy machine, 1933 Physical therapy The three forms of diathermy employed by physical therapists are ultrasound, short wave and microwave. The application of moderate heat by diathermy increases blood flow and speeds up metabolism and the rate of ion diffusion across cellular membranes. The fibrous tissues in tendons, joint capsules, and scars are more easily stretched when subjected to heat, thus facilitating the relief of stiffness of joints and promoting relaxation of the muscles and decrease of muscle spasms. =Ultrasound= Ultrasound diathermy employs high-frequency acoustic vibrations which, when propelled through the tissues, are converted into heat. This type of diathermy is especially useful in the delivery of heat to selected musculatures and structures because there is a difference in the sensitivity of various fibers to the acoustic vibrations; some are more absorptive and some are more reflective. For example, in subcutaneous fat, relatively little energy is converted into heat, but in muscle tissues there is a much higher rate of conversion to heat. The therapeutic ultrasound apparatus generates a high-frequency alternating current, which is then converted into acoustic vibrations. The apparatus is moved slowly across the surface of the part being treated. Ultrasound is a very effective agent for the application of heat, but it should be used only by a therapist who is fully aware of its potential hazards and the contraindications for its use. =Short wave= Short wave diathermy machines use two condenser plates that are placed on either side of the body part to be treated. Another mode of application is by induction coils that are pliable and can be molded to fit the part of the body under treatment. As the high-frequency waves travel through the body tissues between the condensers or the coils, they are converted into heat. The degree of heat and depth of penetration depend in part on the absorptive and resistance properties of the tissues that the waves encounter. Short wave diathermy operations use the ISM band frequencies of 13.56, 27.12, and 40.68 megahertz. Most commercial machines operate at a frequency of 27.12 MHz, a wavelength of approximately 11 meters. Short wave diathermy usually is prescribed for treatment of deep muscles and joints that are covered with a heavy soft-tissue mass, for example, the hip. In some instances short wave diathermy may be applied to localize deep inflammatory processes, as in pelvic inflammatory disease. Short wave diathermy can also be used for hyperthermia therapy, as an adjuvant to radiation in cancer treatment. Typically, hyperthermia would be added twice a week before radiation, as shown in the photograph from a 2010 clinical trial at Mahavir Cancer Sansthan in Patna, India. Clinical trial of hyperthermia and radiation at the Mahavir Cancer Sansthan, Patna, India =Microwave= Microwave diathermy uses microwaves, radio waves which are higher in frequency and shorter in wavelength than the short waves above. Microwaves, which are also used in radar, have a frequency above 300 MHz and a wavelength less than one meter. Most, if not all, of the therapeutic effects of microwave therapy are related to the conversion of energy into heat and its distribution throughout the body tissues. This mode of diathermy is considered to be the easiest to use, but the microwaves have a relatively poor depth of penetration. Microwaves cannot be used in high dosage on edematous tissue, over wet dressings, or near metallic implants in the body because of the danger of local burns. Microwaves and short waves cannot be used on or near persons with implanted electronic cardiac pacemakers. Hyperthermia induced by microwave diathermy raises the temperature of deep tissues from 41 ¬∞C to 45 ¬∞C using electromagnetic power. The biological mechanism that regulates the relationship between the thermal dose and the healing process of soft tissues with low or high water content or with low or high blood perfusion is still under study. Microwave diathermy treatment at 434 and 915 MHz can be effective in the short-term management of musculo-skeletal injuries. Hyperthermia is safe if the temperature is kept under 45 ¬∞C or 113 ¬∞F. The absolute temperature is, however, not sufficient to predict the damage that it may produce. Microwave diathermy-induced hyperthermia produced short-term pain relief in established supraspinatus tendinopathy. The physical characteristics of most of the devices used clinically to heat tissues have been proved to be inefficient to reach the necessary therapeutic heating patterns in the range of depth of the damage tissue. The preliminary studies performed with new microwave devices working at 434 MHz have demonstrated encouraging results. Nevertheless, adequately designed prospective-controlled clinical studies need to be completed to confirm the therapeutic effectiveness of hyperthermia with large number of patients, longer-term follow-up and mixed populations. Microwave diathermy is used in the management of superficial tumours with conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Hyperthermia has been used in oncology for more than 35 years, in addition to radiotherapy, in the management of different tumours. In 1994, hyperthermia was introduced in several countries of the European Union as a modality for use in physical medicine and sports traumatology. Its use has been successfully extended to physical medicine and sports traumatology in Central and Southern Europe. Surgery Surgical diathermy is usually better known as \\"electrosurgery\\". (It is also referred to occasionally as \\"electrocautery\\", but see disambiguation below.) Electrosurgery and surgical diathermy involve the use of high-frequency A.C. electric current in surgery as either a cutting modality, or else to cauterize small blood vessels to stop bleeding. This technique induces localized tissue burning and damage, the zone of which is controlled by the frequency and power of the device. Some sourcesValleylab article on Principles of Electrosurgery/Electrocautery insist that electrosurgery be applied to surgery accomplished by high-frequency alternating current (AC) cutting, and that \\"electrocautery\\" be used only for the practice of cauterization with heated nichrome wires powered by direct current (DC), as in the handheld battery-operated portable cautery tools. =Types= Diathermy used in surgery is of typically two types. *Monopolar, where electric current passes from one electrode near the tissue to be treated to other fixed electrode (indifferent electrode) elsewhere in the body. Usually this type of electrode is placed in contact with buttocks or around the leg. *Bipolar, where both electrodes are mounted on same pen-like device and electric current passes only through the tissue being treated. Advantage of bipolar electrosurgery is that it prevents the flow of current through other tissues of the body and focuses only on the tissue in contact. This is useful in microsurgery and in patients with cardiac pacemaker. Diathermy risks Burns from electrocautery generally arise from a faulty grounding pad or from an outbreak of a fire. Monopolar electrocautery works because radio frequency energy is concentrated by the surgical instrument's small surface area. The electrical circuit is completed by passing current through the patient's body to a conductive pad that is connected to the radio frequency generator. Because the pad's surface area is large relative to the instrument's tip, energy density across the pad is reliably low enough that no tissue injury occurs at the pad site. Electrical shocks and burns are possible, however, if the circuit is interrupted or energy is concentrated in some way. This can happen if the pad surface in contact is small, e.g. if the pad's electrolytic gel is dry, if the pad becomes disconnected from the radio frequency generator, or via a metal implant. Modern electrocautery systems are equipped with sensors to detect high resistance in the circuit that can prevent some injuries. As with all forms of heat applications, care must be taken to avoid burns during diathermy treatments, especially in patients with decreased sensitivity to heat and cold. With electrocautery there have been reported cases of flash fires in the operating theatre related to heat generation meeting chemical flash points, especially in the presence of increased oxygen concentrations associated with anaesthetic. Concerns have also been raised regarding the toxicity of surgical smoke produced by electrocautery. This has been shown to contain chemicals which may cause harm to patients, surgeons and/or operating theatre staff. For patients that have a surgically implanted Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) system, diathermy can cause tissue damage through energy that is transferred into the implanted SCS components resulting in severe injury or death. Military Medical diathermy devices were used to cause interference to German radio beams used for targeting nighttime bombing raids in World War II during the Battle of the Beams.

Evol., 14 (2014), pp. 133‚Äì149 Headshield slugs are the most morphologically diverse group of all the opisthobranchs. Anatomy The vast majority possess a shell, although it may be reduced or internal. They have a well-developed headshield, a characteristic broadening at the head, which is used to plow beneath the surface of the sand. This headshield prevents the sand entering the mantle cavity. There is a muscular foot with or without parapodia (fleshy wing-like flaps). Life habits and related anatomical structures Headshield slugs often live just beneath the surface of the sand and can also be seen crawling on rocks. They have well-developed sensory structures to detect prey, which may be other opisthobranchs, polychaetes or bristleworms and foraminiferans. Several species are voracious carnivores. Members of the brightly colored genus Chelidonura also have well-developed eyes on the anterior end of the head and bundles of sensory cilia around the mouth. With these cilia they are able to track their prey by following the victim‚Äôs mucous trail. The Hancock's organ is a chemosensory organ situated between the foot and the headshield. It plays a role in olfactory and sensory detection. It is visible as a dark brown pit at the base of the right rhinophore.  Taxonomy  The taxonomy of the shelled cephalaspideans, the bubble snails, like that of many shelled mollusks, used to be based very simply on shell characteristics. But because there are some similarities in shell morphology throughout this group, more recently taxonomists have taken other anatomical characteristics into consideration, such as the radula, gizzard, penis, and Hancock‚Äôs organ.

This term is more commonly used for progressive diseases such as cancer or advanced heart disease than for trauma. In popular use, it indicates a disease that will progress until death with near absolute certainty, regardless of treatment. A patient who has such an illness may be referred to as a terminal patient, terminally ill or simply terminal. There is no standardized life expectancy for a patient to be considered terminal, although it is generally months or less. Life expectancy for terminal patients is a rough estimate given by the physician based on previous data and does not always reflect true longevity. An illness which is lifelong but not fatal is a chronic condition. Terminal patients have options for disease management after diagnosis. Examples include caregiving, continued treatment, hospice care, and physician-assisted suicide. Decisions regarding management are made by the patient and his or her family, although medical professionals may give recommendations or more about the services available to terminal patients. Lifestyle after diagnosis varies depending largely on management decisions and also the nature of the disease, and there may be living restrictions depending on the condition of the patient. Oftentimes, terminal patients may experience depression or anxiety associated with oncoming death, and family and caregivers may struggle with psychological burdens as well. Psycho-therapeutic interventions may help alleviate some of these burdens, and is often incorporated in palliative care. Because terminal patients are aware of their oncoming deaths, they have more time to prepare advance care planning, such as advance directives and living wills, which have been shown to improve end-of- life care. While death cannot be avoided, patients can still strive to die a good death.  Management  By definition, there is not a cure or adequate treatment for terminal illnesses. However, some kinds of medical treatments may be appropriate anyway, such as treatment to reduce pain or ease breathing. Some terminally ill patients stop all debilitating treatments to reduce unwanted side effects. Others continue aggressive treatment in the hope of an unexpected success. Still, others reject conventional medical treatment and pursue unproven treatments such as radical dietary modifications. Patients' choices about different treatments may change over time. Palliative care is normally offered to terminally ill patients, regardless of their overall disease management style, if it seems likely to help manage symptoms such as pain and improve quality of life. Hospice care, which can be provided at home or in a long-term care facility, additionally provides emotional and spiritual support for the patient and loved ones. Some complementary approaches, such as relaxation therapy, massage, and acupuncture may relieve some symptoms and other causes of suffering.  Caregiving  Terminal patients often need a caregiver, who could be a nurse, licensed practical nurse or a family member. Caregivers can help patients receive medications to reduce pain and control symptoms of nausea or vomiting. They can also assist the individual with daily living activities and movement. Caregivers provide assistance with food and psychological support and ensure that the individual is comfortable. The patient's family may have questions and most caregivers can provide information to help ease the mind. Doctors generally do not provide estimates for fear of instilling false hopes or obliterate an individual's hope.University of Texas Cancer therapy and research center. \\"Terminal Cancer Overview\\" 2010-02-09. In most cases, the caregiver works along with physicians and follows professional instructions. Caregivers may call the physician or a nurse if the individual: * experiences excessive pain. * is in distress or having difficulty breathing. * has difficulty passing urine or is constipated. * has fallen and appears hurt. * is depressed and wants to harm themselves. * refuses to take prescribed medications, raising ethical concerns best addressed by a person with more extensive formal training. * or if the caregiver does not know how to handle the situation. Most caregivers become the patient's listeners and let the individual express fears and concerns without judgment. Caregivers reassure the patient and honor all advance directives. Caregivers respect the individual's need for privacy and usually hold all information confidential.Physical Needs of the Person With Terminal Cancer University of Virginia. Retrieved on 2010-02-09  Palliative care  Palliative care focuses on addressing patients' needs after disease diagnosis. While palliative care is not disease treatment, it addresses patients' physical needs, such as pain management, offers emotional support, caring for the patient psychologically and spiritually, and helps patients build support systems that can help them get through difficult times. Palliative care can also help patients make decisions and come to understand what they want regarding their treatment goals and quality of life. Palliative care is an attempt to improve patients' quality-of-life and comfort, and also provide support for family members and carers. Additionally, it lowers hospital admissions costs. However, needs for palliative care are often unmet whether due to lack of government support and also possible stigma associated with palliative care. For these reasons, the World Health Assembly recommends development of palliative care in health care systems. Palliative care and hospice care are often confused, and they have similar goals. However, hospice care is specifically for terminal patients while palliative care is more general and offered to patients who are not necessarily terminal.  Hospice care  While hospitals focus on treating the disease, hospices focus on improving patient quality-of-life until death. A common misconception is that hospice care hastens death because patients \\"give up\\" fighting the disease. However, patients in hospice care often live the same length of time as patients in the hospital. A study of 3850 liver cancer patients found that patients who received hospice care, and those who did not, survived for the same amount of time. In fact, a study of 3399 adult lung cancer patients showed that patients who received hospice care actually survived longer than those who did not. Additionally, in both of these studies, patients receiving hospice care had significantly lower healthcare expenditures. Hospice care allows patients to spend more time with family and friends. Since patients are in the company of other hospice patients, they have an additional support network and can learn to cope together. Hospice patients are also able to live at peace away from a hospital setting; they may live at home with a hospice provider or at an inpatient hospice facility.  Medications for terminal patients  Terminal patients experiencing pain, especially cancer-related pain, are often prescribed opioids to relieve suffering. The specific medication prescribed, however, will differ depending on severity of pain and disease status. There exist inequities in availability of opioids to terminal patients, especially in countries where opioid access is limited. A common symptom that many terminal patients experience is dyspnea, or difficulty with breathing. To ease this symptom, doctors may also prescribe opioids to patients. Some studies suggest that oral opioids may help with breathlessness. However, due to lack of consistent reliable evidence, it is currently unclear whether they truly work for this purpose. Depending on the patient's condition, other medications will be prescribed accordingly. For example, if patients develop depression, antidepressants will be prescribed. Anti- inflammation and anti-nausea medications may also be prescribed.  Continued treatment  Some terminal patients opt to continue extensive treatments in hope of a miracle cure, whether by participating in experimental treatments and clinical trials or seeking more intense treatment for the disease. Rather than to \\"give up fighting,\\" patients spend thousands more dollars to try to prolong life by a few more months. What these patients often do give up, however, is quality of life at the end of life by undergoing intense and often uncomfortable treatment. A meta-analysis of 34 studies including 11,326 patients from 11 countries found that less than half of all terminal patients correctly understood their disease prognosis, or the course of their disease and likeliness of survival. This could influence patients to pursue unnecessary treatment for the disease due to unrealistic expectations.  Transplant  For patients with end stage kidney failure, studies have shown that transplants increase the quality of life and decreases mortality in this population. In order to be placed on the organ transplant list, patients are referred and assessed based on criteria that ranges from current comorbidities to potential for organ rejection post transplant. Initial screening measures include: blood tests, pregnancy tests, serologic tests, urinalysis, drug screening, imaging, and physical exams. For patients who are interested in liver transplantation, only patients with acute liver failure have the highest priority over patients with only cirrhosis. Acute liver failure patients will present with worsening symptoms of somnolence or confusion (hepatic encephalopathy) and thinner blood (increased INR) due to the liver's inability to make clotting factors. Some patients could experience portal hypertension, hemorrhages, and abdominal swelling (ascites). Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) is often used to help providers decide and prioritize candidates for transplant.  Physician-assisted suicide  Physician- assisted suicide (PAS) is a highly controversial concept, only legal in a few countries. In PAS, physicians, with voluntary written and verbal consent from the patient, give patients the means to die, usually through lethal drugs. The patient then chooses to \\"die with dignity,\\" deciding on his/her own time and place to die. Reasons as to why patients choose PAS differ. Factors that may play into a patient's decision include future disability and suffering, lack of control over death, impact on family, healthcare costs, insurance coverage, personal beliefs, religious beliefs, and much more. PAS may be referred to in many different ways, such as aid in dying, assisted dying, death with dignity, and many more. These often depend on the organization and the stance they take on the issue. In this section of the article, it will be referred to as PAS for the sake of consistency with the pre-existing Wikipedia page: Assisted Suicide. In the United States, PAS or medical aid in dying is legal in select states, including Oregon, Washington, Montana, Vermont, and New Mexico, and there are groups both in favor of and against legalization. Some groups favor PAS because they do not believe they will have control over their pain, because they believe they will be a burden on their family, and because they do not want to lose autonomy and control over their own lives among other reasons. They believe that allowing PAS is an act of compassion. While some groups believe in personal choice over death, others raise concerns regarding insurance policies and potential for abuse. According to Sulmasy et al., the major non-religious arguments against physician-assisted suicide are quoted as follows: * (1) \\"it offends me\\", suicide devalues human life; * (2) slippery slope, the limits on euthanasia gradually erode; * (3) \\"pain can be alleviated\\", palliative care and modern therapeutics more and more adequately manage pain; * (4) physician integrity and patient trust, participating in suicide violates the integrity of the physician and undermines the trust patients place in physicians to heal and not to harm\\" Again, there are also arguments that there are enough protections in the law that the slippery slope is avoided. For example, the Death with Dignity Act in Oregon includes waiting periods, multiple requests for lethal drugs, a psychiatric evaluation in the case of possible depression influencing decisions, and the patient personally swallowing the pills to ensure voluntary decision. Physicians and medical professionals also have disagreeing views on PAS. Some groups, such as the American College of Physicians (ACP), the American Medical Association (AMA), the World Health Organization, American Nurses Association, Hospice Nurses Association, American Psychiatric Association, and more have issued position statements against its legalization. The ACP's argument concerns the nature of the doctor-patient relationship and the tenets of the medical profession. They state that instead of using PAS to control death: \\"through high-quality care, effective communication, compassionate support, and the right resources, physicians can help patients control many aspects of how they live out life's last chapter.\\" Other groups such as the American Medical Students Association, the American Public Health Association, the American Medical Women's Association, and more support PAS as an act of compassion for the suffering patient. In many cases, the argument on PAS is also tied to proper palliative care. The International Association for Hospice and Palliative Care issued a position statement arguing against considering legalizing PAS unless comprehensive palliative care systems in the country were in place. It could be argued that with proper palliative care, the patient would experience fewer intolerable symptoms, physical or emotional, and would not choose death over these symptoms. Palliative care would also ensure that patients receive proper information about their disease prognosis as not to make decisions about PAS without complete and careful consideration.  Medical care  Many aspects of medical care are different for terminal patients compared to patients in the hospital for other reasons.  Doctor‚Äìpatient relationships  Doctor‚Äìpatient relationship are crucial in any medical setting, and especially so for terminal patients. There must be an inherent trust in the doctor to provide the best possible care for the patient. In the case of terminal illness, there is often ambiguity in communication with the patient about his/her condition. While terminal condition prognosis is often a grave matter, doctors do not wish to quash all hope, for it could unnecessarily harm the patient's mental state and have unintended consequences. However, being overly optimistic about outcomes can leave patients and families devastated when negative results arise, as is often the case with terminal illness.  Mortality predictions  Often, a patient is considered terminally ill when his or her estimated life expectancy is six months or less, under the assumption that the disease will run its normal course based on previous data from other patients. The six-month standard is arbitrary, and best available estimates of longevity may be incorrect. Though a given patient may properly be considered terminal, this is not a guarantee that the patient will die within six months. Similarly, a patient with a slowly progressing disease, such as AIDS, may not be considered terminally ill if the best estimate of longevity is greater than six months. However, this does not guarantee that the patient will not die unexpectedly early. In general, physicians slightly overestimate the survival time of terminally ill cancer patients, so that, for example, a person who is expected to live for about six weeks would likely die around four weeks. A recent systematic review on palliative patients in general, rather than specifically cancer patients, states the following: \\"Accuracy of categorical estimates in this systematic review ranged from 23% up to 78% and continuous estimates over-predicted actual survival by, potentially, a factor of two.\\" There was no evidence that any specific type of clinician was better at making these predictions.  Healthcare spending  Healthcare during the last year of life is costly, especially for patients who used hospital services often during end-of-life. In fact, according to Langton et al., there were \\"exponential increases in service use and costs as death approached.\\" Many dying terminal patients are also brought to the emergency department (ED) at the end of life when treatment is no longer beneficial, raising costs and using limited space in the ED. While there are often claims about \\"disproportionate\\" spending of money and resources on end-of-life patients, data have not proven this type of correlation. The cost of healthcare for end-of-life patients is 13% of annual healthcare spending in the U.S. However, of the group of patients with the highest healthcare spending, end-of-life patients only made up 11% of these people, meaning the most expensive spending is not made up mostly of terminal patients. Many recent studies have shown that palliative care and hospice options as an alternative are much less expensive for end-of-life patients.  Psychological impact  Coping with impending death is a hard topic to digest universally. Patients may experience grief, fear, loneliness, depression, and anxiety among many other possible responses. Terminal illness can also lend patients to become more prone to psychological illness such as depression and anxiety disorders. Insomnia is a common symptom of these. It is important for loved ones to show their support for the patient during these times and to listen to his or her concerns. People who are terminally ill may not always come to accept their impending death. For example, a person who finds strength in denial may never reach a point of acceptance or accommodation and may react negatively to any statement that threatens this defense mechanism.  Impact on patient  Depression is relatively common among terminal patients, and the prevalence increases as patients become sicker. Depression causes quality of life to go down, and a sizable portion of patients who request assisted suicide are depressed. These negative emotions may be heightened by lack of sleep and pain as well. Depression can be treated with antidepressants and/or therapy, but doctors often do not realize the extent of terminal patients' depression. Because depression is common among terminal patients, the American College of Physicians recommends regular assessments for depression for this population and appropriate prescription of antidepressants. Anxiety disorders are also relatively common for terminal patients as they face their mortality. Patients may feel distressed when thinking about what the future may hold, especially when considering the future of their families as well. It is important to note, however, that some palliative medications may facilitate anxiety.  Coping for patients  Caregivers may listen to the concerns of terminal patients to help them reflect on their emotions. Different forms of psychotherapy and psychosocial intervention, which can be offered with palliative care, may also help patients think about and overcome their feelings. According to Block, \\"most terminally ill patients benefit from an approach that combines emotional support, flexibility, appreciation of the patient‚Äôs strengths, a warm and genuine relationship with the therapist, elements of life-review, and exploration of fears and concerns.\\"  Impact on family  Terminal patients' families often also suffer psychological consequences. If not well equipped to face the reality of their loved one's illness, family members may develop depressive symptoms and even have increased mortality. Taking care of sick family members may also cause stress, grief, and worry. Additionally, financial burden from medical treatment may be a source of stress.  Coping for family  Discussing the anticipated loss and planning for the future may help family members accept and prepare for the patient's death. Interventions may also be offered for anticipatory grief. In the case of more serious consequences such as Depression, a more serious intervention or therapy is recommended. Grief counseling and grief therapy may also be recommended for family members after a loved one's death.  Dying  When dying, patients often worry about their quality of life towards the end, including emotional and physical suffering. In order for families and doctors to understand clearly what the patient wants for himself or herself, it is recommended that patients, doctors, and families all convene and discuss the patient's decisions before the patient becomes unable to decide.  Advanced Directives  At the end of life, especially when patients are unable to make decisions on their own regarding treatment, it is often up to family members and doctors to decide what they believe the patients would have wanted regarding their deaths, which is a heavy burden and hard for family members to predict. An estimated 25% of American adults have an advanced directive, meaning the majority of Americans leave these decisions to be made by family, which can lead to conflict and guilt. Although it may be a difficult subject to broach, it is important to discuss the patient's plans for how far to continue treatment should they become unable to decide. This must be done while the patient is still able to make the decisions, and takes the form of an advance directive. The advance directive should be updated regularly as the patient's condition changes so as to reflect the patient's wishes. Some of the decisions that advance directives may address include receiving fluids and nutrition support, getting blood transfusions, receiving antibiotics, resuscitation (if the heart stops beating), and intubation (if the patient stops breathing). Having an advance directive can improve end-of-life care. It is highly recommended by many research studies and meta-analyses for patients to discuss and create an advance directive with their doctors and families.  Do-not-resuscitate  One of the options of care that patients may discuss with their families and medical providers is the do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order. This means that if the patient's heart stops, CPR and other methods to bring back heartbeat would not be performed. This is the patient's choice to make and can depend on a variety of reasons, whether based on personal beliefs or medical concerns. DNR orders can be medically and legally binding depending on the applicable jurisdiction. Decisions like these should be indicated in the advance directive so that the patient's wishes can be carried out to improve end-of-life care.  Symptoms near death  A variety of symptoms become more apparent when a patient is nearing death. Recognizing these symptoms and knowing what will come may help family members prepare. During the final few weeks, symptoms will vary largely depending on the patient's disease. During the final hours, patients usually will reject food and water and will also sleep more, choosing not to interact with those around them. Their bodies may behave more irregularly, with changes in breathing, sometimes with longer pauses between breaths, irregular heart rate, low blood pressure, and coldness in the extremities. It is important to note, however, that symptoms will vary per patient.  Good death  Patients, healthcare workers, and recently bereaved family members often describe a \\"good death\\" in terms of effective choices made in a few areas: * Assurance of effective pain and symptom management. * Education about death and its aftermath, especially as it relates to decision-making. * Completion of any significant goals, such as resolving past conflicts. In the last hours of life, palliative sedation may be recommended by a doctor or requested by the patient to ease the symptoms of death until he or she passes away. Palliative sedation is not intended to prolong life or hasten death; it is merely meant to relieve symptoms.

It is an alternate route to U.S. 1 with three signed sections and two unsigned sections where the highway is concurrent with its parent. Due to the reconfiguration of tunnel interchanges brought on by the completion of the Big Dig, Route 1A is discontinuous in the downtown Boston area. Vehicles entering Downtown Boston via the Sumner Tunnel must take I-93 north to the exit for Government Center and make a U-turn to access the entrance ramp to I-93 south (which silently carries Route 1A south as well) and vice versa.Executive Office of Transportation - Office of Transportation Planning Roads - June 2008 The older tunnels to and from East Boston have interchanges with I-93 and surface roads north of the point at which unsigned Route 1A \\"exits\\" Route 1 in downtown Boston. Unsigned Route 1A along the Fitzgerald Expressway does not directly connect to those tunnels; a direct connection requires using I-90 and the newer Ted Williams Tunnel, which is not concurrent with Route 1A at any point. Route description Rhode Island border to Attleboro A short segment of Route 1A, in length, in Attleboro runs from U.S. Route 1A at the Rhode Island border through a junction with Interstate 95, before heading north and merging with Route 1. The entire length of this segment is known as Newport Avenue. North Attleborough to Dedham This segment of Route 1A extends roughly north from North Attleborough to Dedham, passing through the towns of Plainville, Wrentham, Norfolk, Walpole, Norwood and Westwood on the way. Prior to its realignment along I-95 and I-93, Route 1 continued north along the Providence Highway towards Boston at the junction of Route 1A and that road. Boston to Salisbury Veterans Memorial Bridge entering Beverly This segment of Route 1A extends from Boston, Massachusetts to Salisbury, Massachusetts. The highway starts from US 1 (which is on the Central Artery with I-93 and Route 3) at the former Government Center/Logan Airport interchange. It passes through the Callahan Tunnel (outbound/northbound) and Sumner Tunnel (inbound/southbound), becoming the East Boston Expressway past Logan Airport. The East Boston Expressway was the first freeway built in the city. Immediately beyond Logan Airport, Interstate 90 ends at Route 1A. The road continues as a divided highway through Revere. It is a limited access highway through Revere, passing Suffolk Downs and the Wonderland Greyhound Park (which is across the street from the outer terminus of the MBTA's Blue Line), before running through the isolated Point of Pines neighborhood and exiting Revere over the General Edwards Bridge into Lynn. For the first mile and a half in Lynn, it is concurrent with the Lynnway, and is a high-traffic retail area. After the Lynnway portion, the route becomes concurrent with Route 129 for a mile, before crossing into Swampscott as Paradise Road. At Vinnin Square, it passes into Salem as Loring Avenue, passing by Salem State University. The route turns left onto Lafayette Street and is concurrent with Route 114. At the intersection with Derby Street, notable for the large fire station, the route turns right. At the next stop sign, the route turns left onto Hawthorne Boulevard passing Salem Common and the Salem Witch Museum before turning left onto Winter Street. At the end of Winter Street, the route turns right onto Bridge Street crossing the Veterans Memorial Bridge into Beverly. It follows two of the main streets of downtown Beverly, before heading north, passing through Wenham and Hamilton (through this section the road is occasionally signed as a US Route) before becoming the main road through the town of Ipswich, crossing the historic Choate Bridge over the Ipswich River. While in Ipswich, much of the route runs concurrently with Route 133 until just over the town line into Rowley. It passes through the main village of Rowley, as well as the central villages of Newbury. In Newburyport, Massachusetts, it merges with Route 1, signed with its parent highway over the Merrimack River and into the town center of Salisbury. It then heads east from the Salisbury town center before turning north and ending in Salisbury Beach at the New Hampshire border. New Hampshire Route 1A continues north from this point.

It is used symbolically to signal the Commons' right to consider matters not contained in the Queen's (or King's) Speech. Ceremonial purpose The bill is introduced after the Queen's Speech, after the Commons have returned to their chamber, but before any debate on the contents of the speech. No Member of Parliament presents it, nor has it been ordered to be printed in recent times, and it is not intended to make any further progress. However, it bears symbolic import: by not discussing the contents of the Queen's Speech immediately, the Commons is demonstrating that it can debate on whatever it chooses, and set its own business. The practice of giving a first reading to a bill before debating the Speech dates back to at least 1558; the purpose of this practice was first explained in a 1604 bill. Various bills were used for the purpose; originally they were just normal bills and could progress to a second reading. The Outlawries Bill was first introduced in the 1727 session and has been used at the start of every session thereafter (except for 1741 and 1742). John Wilkes interrupted the reading of the bill in 1763, to complain about his imprisonment, but the Speaker required Commons to first deal with the bill. In 1794 Richard Sheridan used the reading of the bill to raise the subject of the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. The usefulness of the bill was last considered in 2002. The Procedure Committee investigated the history of the bill and determined that because it has symbolic meaning and takes very little time to announce, there is no need to abandon it.Parliament Information Office Other legislatures The equivalent bill used by the House of Lords is the Select Vestries Bill. In Canada, similar pro forma bills are introduced in both houses of Parliament, numbered bills C-1 and S-1. They are traditionally entitled An Act respecting the Administration of Oaths of Office in the House of Commons and An Act relating to Railways in the Senate, although the text of neither bill makes any mention of oaths of office or railways. In the Australian House of Representatives, a new bill is drafted for this purpose each time (in the 46th Parliament this was the Agriculture Legislation Repeal Bill 2019) and is presented by the Prime Minister. Unlike the Canadian equivalent, the bills' contents do address the respective subject matters and could theoretically be enacted like any other bill. However, a second reading is never moved. A pro forma bill is not used in the Australian Senate; instead, other formal business, such as question time, ministerial statements and/or other bills, is transacted before consideration of the governor-general's speech. The Parliament of Northern Ireland (in existence 1921‚Äì1972) also gave a first reading to the Outlawries Bill after the Speech from the Throne (delivered by the Governor of Northern Ireland, except in 1921 when King George V appeared in person).http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/intro.html Background The term outlawry referred to the formal procedure of declaring someone an outlaw, i.e. putting him outside of the sphere of legal protection. In the common law of England, a judgment of (criminal) outlawry was one of the harshest penalties in the legal system, since the outlaw could not use the legal system to protect them if needed, e.g. from mob justice. To be declared an outlaw was to suffer a form of civil death. No one was allowed to give him food, shelter, or any other sort of support - to do so was to commit the crime of aiding and abetting, and to be in danger of the ban oneself. In effect, (criminal) outlaws were criminals on the run who were \\"wanted dead or alive\\". By the rules of common law, a criminal outlaw did not need to be guilty of the crime he was outlawed for. If a man was accused of a crime and, instead of appearing in court and defending himself from accusations, fled from justice, he was committing serious contempt of court, which was itself a capital crime; so even if he were innocent of the crime he was originally accused of, he was guilty of evading justice. There was also civil outlawry. Civil outlawry did not carry capital punishment with it, and it was imposed on defendants who fled or evaded justice when sued for civil actions such as debts or torts. The punishments for civil outlawry were nevertheless harsh, including confiscation of chattels (movable property) left behind by the outlaw. In the civil context, outlawry became obsolescent in civil procedure by reforms that no longer required summoned defendants to appear and plead. Still, the possibility of being declared an outlaw for derelictions of civil duty continued to exist in English law until 1879 and in Scots law until the late 1940s. Since then, failure to find the defendant and serve process is usually interpreted in favour of the defendant, and harsh penalties for mere nonappearance (merely presumed flight to escape justice) no longer apply. Content Since the bill is now neither printed nor debated, its exact text is unclear. The following outlawry bill, as introduced during the reign of Queen Victoria, may serve as an illustration for such a bill's form. Missing details such as dates or penalties are indicated in brackets. When a defendant in civil or criminal cases could not be found, the reason would not always be clear. A person might depart for perfectly innocent reasons and be completely unaware that a criminal accusation or civil suit might be brought against him after his departure. The English common law, however, established a rule that if a defendant could not be found (or did not show up for court) after a certain waiting period and proper public advertisements, he could be assumed to have fled or hid to escape justice, and subjected to the appropriate punishments for contempt of court. A \\"clandestine outlawry\\" would be a judgment of outlawry passed against a defendant without giving the legal action proper publicity and the defendant adequate opportunity to be notified and answer the charges. The Outlawries Bill contemplates two manners in which this might happen. The first possibility considers that litigants ‚Äì whether attorneys, solicitors or any other persons ‚Äì might know the county where the defendant is dwelling, but nevertheless fail to send or deliver the Writ of Proclamation to the sheriff of the proper county. In other words, they might sue a defendant in a remote place and, knowing where the defendant lives, fail to contact the defendant by official channels. The second possibility refers to a previous Act of Outlawry describing the proper proclamations to be made to seek a legal defendant, and considers that a sheriff might neglect or refuse to make such proclamations, and nevertheless report (returning the writ) that the person was not found (and therefore presumed to be escaping justice). The text of the Outlawries Bill provides penalties for both kinds of malefactors (sheriffs and plaintiffs), leaving blanks for the actual penalties, to be decided during further discussion of the Bill. Before the Outlawries Bill became a symbolic custom, several Outlawry Acts were passed into English law: the Outlawry Act 1331 (5 Edw III c.12,13), in 1363 (37 Edw. III), in 1406 (7 Hen IV), in 1532 (23 Hen VIII), and the Avoidance of Secret Outlawries Act 1588 (31 Eliz I), none of which appear to be still in force.Henry St Clair Feilden, \\"A short constitutional history of England\\", p.231 (1882) See also *Select Vestries Bill in the House of Lords *Bills C-1 and S-1, equivalent in Canadian Parliament References External links *A-Z of Parliament (BBC) Laws in the United Kingdom Constitution of the United Kingdom 1727 in law ","title":"Outlawries Bill"},{"id":"712409","text":"Urkesh or Urkish (modern Tell Mozan; ) is a tell, or settlement mound, located in the foothills of the Taurus Mountains in Al-Hasakah Governorate, northeastern Syria. It was founded during the fourth millennium BC possibly by the Hurrians on a site which appears to have been inhabited previously for a few centuries. Geography There are other contemporary ancient sites in this area of upper Khabur River basin. For example, Chagar Bazar is 22 km south of Mozan. Tell Arbid is located 45 km south of Tell Mozan. Tell Brak is about 50 km to the south. Tell Leilan is located about 50 km to the east of Urkesh. Leilan, Brak and Urkesh were particularly prominent during the Akkadian period.Margreet L. Steiner, Ann E. Killebrew, The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of the Levant: C. 8000-332 BCE. OUP Oxford, 2014 p398 History The recently arrived Hurrians founded the small state (or states) of Urkesh. Urkesh was an ally of the Akkadian Empire through what is believed to have been a dynastic marriage tradition. Tar'am-Agade the daughter of the Akkadian king, Naram-Sin, is believed to have been married to the king of Urkesh. During the early second millennium BC the city passed into the hands of the rulers of Mari, a city a few hundred miles to the south. The king of Urkesh became a vassal (and apparently an appointed puppet) of Mari. The people of Urkesh evidently resented this, as the royal archives at Mari provide evidence of their strong resistance; in one letter, the king of Mari tells his Urkesh counterpart that \\"I did not know that the sons of your city hate you on my account. But you are mine, even if the city of Urkesh is not.\\" In the middle of the millennium, Tell Mozan was the location of a Mitanni religious site. The city appears to have been largely abandoned circa 1350 BC, although the reason for this is unknown to archaeologists at this time.

Important excavated structures include the royal palace of Tupkish, an associated necromantic underground structure (Abi), a monumental temple terrace with a plaza in front and a temple at the top, residential areas, burial areas, and the inner and outer city walls.Giorgio Buccellati and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati, Great Temple Terrace at Urkesh and the Lions of Tish-atal, in General studies and excavations at Nuzi 11/2: in honor of David I.

Agatha Christie, his wife, wrote that they chose not to continue at the site because it seemed to have Roman material.Agatha Christie, Come Tell Me How You Live, Akadine Press, 2002, No trace of Roman occupation levels have been found in later excavations, however. Mallowan went on to excavate Chagar Bazar, another site to the south of Mozan/Urkesh. Excavations at Tell Mozan began in 1984 and have been conducted for at least 17 seasons up to the present time. The work has been led by Giorgio Buccellati of UCLA and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati of California State University, Los Angeles.Giorgio Buccellati and Marilyn Kelly Buccellati, Mozan 1: The Soundings of the First Two Seasons, Undena, 1988, Lucio Milano, Mozan: The Epigraphic Finds of the Sixth Season, Undena, 1991, Giorgio Buccellati and Marilyn Kelly-Buccellati, The Seventh Season of Excavations at Tell Mozan, 1992, Chronique Arch√©ologique en Syrie, vol. 1, pp. 79-84, 1997Giorgio Buccellati and Marilyn Kelly Buccellati, Preliminary Report on the 21th Season of Excavations at Tell Mozan-Urkesh (July‚ÄìSeptember 2008), Chronique Arch√©ologique en Syrie IV, pp. 127-132, 2010Giorgio Buccellati et al, Preliminary Report on the 22nd Season of Excavations at Tell Mozan-Urkesh (July‚ÄìOctober 2009), Chronique Arch√©ologique en Syrie V, pp. 107-116,2011 The 2007 season was primarily dedicated to working on publication material, primarily excavation units A16, J1, J3 and J4. A small sounding was done in J1 to clarify the transition between Mittani and Khabur. The excavations have been assisted at various times by other groups including the German Archaeological Institute. The excavations at Tell Mozan are known for the project's interest in pursuing the uses of technology in an archaeological context. The main focus is on the 'Global Record', a method of documentation that combines journal entries into a hypertext based output. This system marries the advantages of both the database and prose type approaches, in that elements are individually linked across both stratigraphy and typology, and yet remain tied in a more synthetic whole through the narrative of the archaeological record. Another focal point of research at the site is the application of conservation.Buccellati, G. and S. Bonetti, Conservation at the core of archaeological strategy.

Shaum-shen is the craftsman.\\" The mud brick architecture which comprises the majority of the structures found to date has been preserved over the years though an innovative system. This system protects the monument while still allowing a detailed inspection of the primary document as originally unearthed. The same system affords an overview of the architectural volumes as perceived by the ancients. A sizeable lab in the field research facility allows the conservators to give the best possible on-site care while interacting with the excavations. Special emphasis is placed on documenting the concrete types of contact which are observed in the ground. This is done with great detail at the level of each individual feature. From this evidence is automatically derived a complete depositional history of all elements in contact. The strata are conceived as segments of this continuum in which a single depositional moment can be reconstructed. The phases are periods that are culturally identifiable on the basis of typological and functional analysis. Horizons are the broad chronological subdivisions based on comparative material and as they can be linked to the general historical understanding. One of the most important fixed points of reference for chronology are impressions on door sealings of the seal of Tar'am-Agade, the daughter of Naram-Sin, which because of stratigraphy can be firmly linked to phase 3 of the AP palace occupation.

He was known during his tenure as Secretary of the Interior for his controversial \\"Hodel Policy,\\" which stated that disused dirt roads and footpaths could be considered right-of-ways under RS 2477. Hodel proposed that rather than reduce the production of CFCs to prevent ozone layer destruction, people should wear hats and use sunscreen. His plan was assailed by scientists and environmentalists, who pointed out the ‚Äúbroad and potentially disastrous effects that increased ultraviolet radiation would have on the Earth‚Äôs climate, food chains and individual species of plants and animals other than humans.‚Äù Critics of Hodel‚Äôs ‚ÄúRay-Ban Plan‚Äù sarcastically depicted animals and plants wearing sunglasses to protect against increased radiation, and he soon resigned under pressure. Early life Hodel was born in Portland, Oregon, the son of Philip E. Hodel and Theresia R. Brodt. He attended Harvard University. In 1957 he married Barbara Beecher Stockman, who was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and attended Wellesley College. She married Hodel during her senior year. They moved to Oregon after graduation and Hodel earned his J.D. at the University of Oregon. While living in Oregon, the Hodels had two sons, and Barbara became a full-time mother. After their elder son's suicide, the Hodels became evangelical Christians. They became active in church and other Christian ministries and began speaking at evangelical meetings and prayer breakfasts. The Hodels have appeared on The 700 Club with Pat Robertson, The Hour of Power with Robert Schuller and on Focus on the Family broadcasts with James Dobson, encouraging families that have also lost loved ones to suicide. Government career From 1972 to 1977, Hodel was the administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration. After leaving it, he said that the Pacific Northwest would eventually need all the power that would be produced by the nuclear power plants proposed by the Washington Public Power Supply System.The Oregon Journal August 31, 1982 page 11 Hodel served as United States Secretary of Energy from 1982 to 1985 and Secretary of the Interior from 1985 to 1989 under President Ronald Reagan. He had been Undersecretary of the Interior under James Watt. Critics disrupted his efforts to impose a new management policy on a large amount of federal land and blocked his efforts to create vast new wilderness areas. In spite of the criticisms, the Reagan administration added over two million acres (8,000 km¬≤) to the national wilderness system. The Hodel policy was continued under Manuel Lujan Jr. in the George H. W. Bush administration. It was rescinded in 1997 by Secretary Bruce Babbitt. In an article, Hodel wrote, \\"Throughout President Reagan's eight years, his secretaries of the Interior pursued these objectives within the framework of his and their conviction that America could have both an improving environment and an adequate energy supply. We did not and do not have to choose between them, as some have contended.\\" While secretary, Hodel proposed to undertake a study on the removal of the O'Shaughnessy Dam in Yosemite National Park, and the restoration of Hetch Hetchy Valley, a smaller but inundated version of Yosemite Valley. Dianne Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco, which owns the dam, opposed the study and had it quashed. In March 1984, the Navajo Nation requested that Secretary of the Interior William Clark make a reasonable adjustment of the coal lease royalty rate paid by Peabody Coal, now Peabody Energy. In July 1985, the newly appointed Hodel secretly met ex parte with Peabody's representative, \\"a former aide and friend of Secretary Hodel.\\" After briefly reviewing the proposals' merits, Hodel approved lease amendments with royalty rates well below the rate that had previously been determined appropriate by the agencies responsible for monitoring the federal government's relations with Native Americans. In 2007, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit determined that those actions breached the government's duty of trust to the Nation and established a \\"cognizable money-mandating claim\\" against the government under the Indian Tucker Act. Post-government career Hodel moved to Colorado, where he engaged in the energy consulting business and served on various charitable and corporate boards of directors. He is the author of Crisis in the Oil Patch (Regnery, 1995). From June 1997 to February 1999, Hodel served as president of the Christian Coalition, a nonprofit conservative political group founded by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson. From May 2003 to March 2005, Hodel served as president and CEO of Focus on the Family, a nonprofit evangelical Christian organization. He said his job was to manage the transition from the founder, James Dobson, to his ultimate successor. Several years before being named president, Hodel had served on its board, and he remained on the board until October 2005. Hodel was also chairman of the company FreeEats.com, which has disseminated push polls for the Economic Freedom Fund.  Environmental efforts  As Secretary of the Interior, in 1985 Hodel ordered the acquisition of a ranch in southern Arizona that became the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge. Encompassing approximately of savanna grassland in the Altar Valley, the refuge was created for the masked bobwhite quail. This refuge contains the United States' only population of the masked bobwhite quail. , Hodel serves as chairman and senior vice president for strategy and policy at Summit Power Group, Inc., a Seattle-based developer of wind, solar and gas-fired power plants. In 1989, he was the founder and managing director of Summit's predecessor company.

It is a generalization of the outer product (which is denoted by the same symbol) from vectors to matrices, and gives the matrix of the tensor product with respect to a standard choice of basis. The Kronecker product is to be distinguished from the usual matrix multiplication, which is an entirely different operation. The Kronecker product is also sometimes called matrix direct product. The Kronecker product is named after the German mathematician Leopold Kronecker (1823-1891), even though there is little evidence that he was the first to define and use it. The Kronecker product has also been called the Zehfuss matrix, after Johann Georg Zehfuss, who in 1858 described this matrix operation, but Kronecker product is currently the most widely used.  Definition  If A is an matrix and B is a matrix, then the Kronecker product is the block matrix: :\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} \\\\mathbf{B} & \\\\cdots & a_{1n}\\\\mathbf{B} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{m1} \\\\mathbf{B} & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\end{bmatrix}, more explicitly: :{\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{B}} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} b_{11} & a_{11} b_{12} & \\\\cdots & a_{11} b_{1q} & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & a_{1n} b_{11} & a_{1n} b_{12} & \\\\cdots & a_{1n} b_{1q} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{11} b_{21} & a_{11} b_{22} & \\\\cdots & a_{11} b_{2q} & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & a_{1n} b_{21} & a_{1n} b_{22} & \\\\cdots & a_{1n} b_{2q} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & & & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{11} b_{p1} & a_{11} b_{p2} & \\\\cdots & a_{11} b_{pq} & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & a_{1n} b_{p1} & a_{1n} b_{p2} & \\\\cdots & a_{1n} b_{pq} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots & & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{m1} b_{11} & a_{m1} b_{12} & \\\\cdots & a_{m1} b_{1q} & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} b_{11} & a_{mn} b_{12} & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} b_{1q} \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{m1} b_{21} & a_{m1} b_{22} & \\\\cdots & a_{m1} b_{2q} & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} b_{21} & a_{mn} b_{22} & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} b_{2q} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & & & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ a_{m1} b_{p1} & a_{m1} b_{p2} & \\\\cdots & a_{m1} b_{pq} & \\\\cdots & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} b_{p1} & a_{mn} b_{p2} & \\\\cdots & a_{mn} b_{pq} \\\\end{bmatrix}.

Let Hi be the Hamiltonian of the ith such system. Then the total Hamiltonian of the ensemble is :H_{\\\\mathrm{Tot}}=\\\\bigoplus_{i}H^{i}. }}  Abstract properties   Matrix equations  The Kronecker product can be used to get a convenient representation for some matrix equations. Consider for instance the equation , where A, B and C are given matrices and the matrix X is the unknown. We can use the \\"vec trick\\" to rewrite this equation as : \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{B}^\\\\textsf{T} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\right) \\\\, \\\\operatorname{vec}(\\\\mathbf{X}) = \\\\operatorname{vec}(\\\\mathbf{AXB}) = \\\\operatorname{vec}(\\\\mathbf{C}) . Here, vec(X) denotes the vectorization of the matrix X, formed by stacking the columns of X into a single column vector. It now follows from the properties of the Kronecker product that the equation has a unique solution, if and only if A and B are nonsingular . If X and AXB are row-ordered into the column vectors u and v, respectively, then : \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right)\\\\mathbf{u} . The reason is that : \\\\mathbf{v} = \\\\operatorname{vec}\\\\left((\\\\mathbf{AXB})^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right) = \\\\operatorname{vec}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{B}^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\mathbf{X}^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\mathbf{A}^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right)\\\\operatorname{vec}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{X^\\\\textsf{T}}\\\\right) = \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}^\\\\textsf{T}\\\\right)\\\\mathbf{u} .  Applications  For an example of the application of this formula, see the article on the Lyapunov equation. This formula also comes in handy in showing that the matrix normal distribution is a special case of the multivariate normal distribution. This formula is also useful for representing 2D image processing operations in matrix-vector form. Another example is when a matrix can be factored as a Hadamard product, then matrix multiplication can be performed faster by using the above formula. This can be applied recursively, as done in the radix-2 FFT and the Fast Walsh‚ÄìHadamard transform. Splitting a known matrix into the Hadamard product of two smaller matrices is known as the \\"nearest Kronecker Product\\" problem, and can be solved exactly by using the SVD. To split a matrix into the Hadamard product of more than two matrices, in an optimal fashion, is a difficult problem and the subject of ongoing research; some authors cast it as a tensor decomposition problem. In conjunction with the least squares method, the Kronecker product can be used as an accurate solution to the hand eye calibration problem.Algo Li, et al. \\"Simultaneous robot-world and hand-eye calibration using dual-quaternions and Kronecker product.\\" International Journal of the Physical Sciences Vol. 5(10), pp. 1530-1536, 4 September 2010.  Related matrix operations  Two related matrix operations are the Tracy‚ÄìSingh and Khatri‚ÄìRao products, which operate on partitioned matrices. Let the matrix A be partitioned into the blocks Aij and matrix B into the blocks Bkl, with of course , , and .  Tracy‚ÄìSingh product  The Tracy‚ÄìSingh product is defined as :\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\circ \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}_{ij} \\\\circ \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right)_{ij} = \\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{A}_{ij} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{kl}\\\\right)_{kl}\\\\right)_{ij} which means that the (ij)-th subblock of the product is the matrix , of which the (k)-th subblock equals the matrix . Essentially the Tracy‚ÄìSingh product is the pairwise Kronecker product for each pair of partitions in the two matrices. For example, if A and B both are partitioned matrices e.g.: : \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array} {c  c} \\\\mathbf{A}_{11} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{A}_{21} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{22} \\\\end{array} \\\\right] = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array} {c c  c} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 7 & 8 & 9 \\\\end{array} \\\\right] ,\\\\quad \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array} {c  c} \\\\mathbf{B}_{11} & \\\\mathbf{B}_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{B}_{21} & \\\\mathbf{B}_{22} \\\\end{array} \\\\right] = \\\\left[ \\\\begin{array} {c  c c} 1 & 4 & 7 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 2 & 5 & 8 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 & 6 & 9 \\\\end{array} \\\\right] , we get: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\circ \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\left[\\\\begin{array} {c  c} \\\\mathbf{A}_{11} \\\\circ \\\\mathbf{B} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{12} \\\\circ \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{A}_{21} \\\\circ \\\\mathbf{B} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{22} \\\\circ \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\end{array}\\\\right] ={} &\\\\left[\\\\begin{array} {c  c  c  c} \\\\mathbf{A}_{11} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{11} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{11} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{12} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{12} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{11} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{12} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{A}_{11} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{21} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{11} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{22} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{12} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{21} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{12} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{22} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{A}_{21} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{11} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{21} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{12} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{22} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{11} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{22} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline \\\\mathbf{A}_{21} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{21} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{21} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{22} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{22} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{21} & \\\\mathbf{A}_{22} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}_{22} \\\\end{array}\\\\right] \\\\\\\\\\\\ ={} &\\\\left[\\\\begin{array} {c c  c c c c  c  c c} 1 & 2 & 4 & 7 & 8 & 14 & 3 & 12 & 21 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 4 & 5 & 16 & 28 & 20 & 35 & 6 & 24 & 42 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 2 & 4 & 5 & 8 & 10 & 16 & 6 & 15 & 24 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 3 & 6 & 6 & 9 & 12 & 18 & 9 & 18 & 27 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 8 & 10 & 20 & 32 & 25 & 40 & 12 & 30 & 48 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 12 & 15 & 24 & 36 & 30 & 45 & 18 & 36 & 54 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 7 & 8 & 28 & 49 & 32 & 56 & 9 & 36 & 63 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\hline 14 & 16 & 35 & 56 & 40 & 64 & 18 & 45 & 72 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 21 & 24 & 42 & 63 & 48 & 72 & 27 & 54 & 81 \\\\end{array}\\\\right]. \\\\end{align}  Khatri‚ÄìRao product  * Block Kronecker product * Column-wise Khatri‚ÄìRao product  Face-splitting product  Mixed-products properties : \\\\mathbf{A} \\\\otimes (\\\\mathbf{B}\\\\bull \\\\mathbf{C}) = (\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{B}) \\\\bull \\\\mathbf{C}, where \\\\bull denotes the Face-splitting product : (\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\bull \\\\mathbf{B})(\\\\mathbf{C} \\\\otimes \\\\mathbf{D}) = (\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{C}) \\\\bull (\\\\mathbf{B} \\\\mathbf{D}),Vadym Slyusar.

Matrix theory ","title":"Kronecker product"},{"id":"712450","text":"Quantum statistical mechanics is statistical mechanics applied to quantum mechanical systems. In quantum mechanics a statistical ensemble (probability distribution over possible quantum states) is described by a density operator S, which is a non-negative, self-adjoint, trace-class operator of trace 1 on the Hilbert space H describing the quantum system. This can be shown under various mathematical formalisms for quantum mechanics. One such formalism is provided by quantum logic.  Expectation  From classical probability theory, we know that the expectation of a random variable X is defined by its distribution DX by : \\\\mathbb{E}(X) = \\\\int_\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\lambda \\\\, d \\\\, \\\\operatorname{D}_X(\\\\lambda) assuming, of course, that the random variable is integrable or that the random variable is non-negative. Similarly, let A be an observable of a quantum mechanical system. A is given by a densely defined self-adjoint operator on H. The spectral measure of A defined by : \\\\operatorname{E}_A(U) = \\\\int_U \\\\lambda d \\\\operatorname{E}(\\\\lambda), uniquely determines A and conversely, is uniquely determined by A. EA is a boolean homomorphism from the Borel subsets of R into the lattice Q of self-adjoint projections of H. In analogy with probability theory, given a state S, we introduce the distribution of A under S which is the probability measure defined on the Borel subsets of R by : \\\\operatorname{D}_A(U) = \\\\operatorname{Tr}(\\\\operatorname{E}_A(U) S). Similarly, the expected value of A is defined in terms of the probability distribution DA by : \\\\mathbb{E}(A) = \\\\int_\\\\mathbb{R} \\\\lambda \\\\, d \\\\, \\\\operatorname{D}_A(\\\\lambda). Note that this expectation is relative to the mixed state S which is used in the definition of DA. Remark. For technical reasons, one needs to consider separately the positive and negative parts of A defined by the Borel functional calculus for unbounded operators. One can easily show: : \\\\mathbb{E}(A) = \\\\operatorname{Tr}(A S) = \\\\operatorname{Tr}(S A). Note that if S is a pure state corresponding to the vector œà, then: : \\\\mathbb{E}(A) = \\\\langle \\\\psi  A  \\\\psi \\\\rangle. The trace of an operator A is written as follows: : \\\\operatorname{Tr}(A) = \\\\sum_{m} \\\\langle m  A  m \\\\rangle .  Von Neumann entropy  Of particular significance for describing randomness of a state is the von Neumann entropy of S formally defined by : \\\\operatorname{H}(S) = -\\\\operatorname{Tr}(S \\\\log_2 S) . Actually, the operator S log2 S is not necessarily trace-class. However, if S is a non-negative self-adjoint operator not of trace class we define Tr(S) = +‚àû. Also note that any density operator S can be diagonalized, that it can be represented in some orthonormal basis by a (possibly infinite) matrix of the form : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\lambda_1 & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\lambda_2 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & & \\\\lambda_n & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & & \\\\ddots \\\\end{bmatrix} and we define : \\\\operatorname{H}(S) = - \\\\sum_i \\\\lambda_i \\\\log_2 \\\\lambda_i. The convention is that \\\\; 0 \\\\log_2 0 = 0, since an event with probability zero should not contribute to the entropy. This value is an extended real number (that is in [0, ‚àû]) and this is clearly a unitary invariant of S. Remark. It is indeed possible that H(S) = +‚àû for some density operator S. In fact T be the diagonal matrix : T = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{2 (\\\\log_2 2)^2 }& 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{1}{3 (\\\\log_2 3)^2 } & \\\\cdots & 0 & \\\\cdots\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & & \\\\frac{1}{n (\\\\log_2 n)^2 } & \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & & & \\\\ddots \\\\end{bmatrix} T is non- negative trace class and one can show T log2 T is not trace-class. Theorem. Entropy is a unitary invariant. In analogy with classical entropy (notice the similarity in the definitions), H(S) measures the amount of randomness in the state S. The more dispersed the eigenvalues are, the larger the system entropy. For a system in which the space H is finite-dimensional, entropy is maximized for the states S which in diagonal form have the representation : \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\frac{1}{n} & 0 & \\\\cdots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & \\\\frac{1}{n} & \\\\dots & 0 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\cdots & \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\end{bmatrix} For such an S, H(S) = log2 n. The state S is called the maximally mixed state. Recall that a pure state is one of the form : S =  \\\\psi \\\\rangle \\\\langle \\\\psi , for œà a vector of norm 1. Theorem. H(S) = 0 if and only if S is a pure state. For S is a pure state if and only if its diagonal form has exactly one non-zero entry which is a 1. Entropy can be used as a measure of quantum entanglement.  Gibbs canonical ensemble  Consider an ensemble of systems described by a Hamiltonian H with average energy E. If H has pure-point spectrum and the eigenvalues E_n of H go to +‚àû sufficiently fast, e‚àír H will be a non-negative trace-class operator for every positive r. The Gibbs canonical ensemble is described by the state : S= \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{e}^{- \\\\beta H}}{\\\\operatorname{Tr}(\\\\mathrm{e}^{- \\\\beta H})}. Where Œ≤ is such that the ensemble average of energy satisfies : \\\\operatorname{Tr}(S H) = E and :\\\\operatorname{Tr}(\\\\mathrm{e}^{- \\\\beta H}) = \\\\sum_n \\\\mathrm{e}^{- \\\\beta E_n} = Z(\\\\beta) This is called the partition function; it is the quantum mechanical version of the canonical partition function of classical statistical mechanics. The probability that a system chosen at random from the ensemble will be in a state corresponding to energy eigenvalue E_m is :\\\\mathcal{P}(E_m) = \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{e}^{- \\\\beta E_m}}{\\\\sum_n \\\\mathrm{e}^{- \\\\beta E_n}}. Under certain conditions, the Gibbs canonical ensemble maximizes the von Neumann entropy of the state subject to the energy conservation requirement.

Biography  Pietro Carrera born in Sicily, in Militello in Val di Catania (Province of Catania), located in the Valley of Noto; here he grew up in the old colony of San Vito. He was the son of Donna Antonia Severino (mother) and Mariano Carrera, a traditional craftsman who entered the priesthood after his wife's death. During his studies in the Seminario Diocesiano of Siracusa, he had the opportunity to visit many different Sicilian cities. As a result of his travels he met Paolo Boi, so-called \\"The Siracusan\\", in the town of Palermo during 1597. After taking his vows, he first become the chaplain at the church of S. Maria della Stella and later of Francesco Branciforte's Court (the Prince of Pietraperzia and Marchese of Militello). During his stay at Branciforte's Court he became interested in chess, winning against Salvatore Albino the so-called \\"Beneventano\\" and against Geronimo Cascio. Cascio won against the famous but old Polerio. After developing a fond relationship with the Prince's wife, Lady Giovanna, he composed a short poem for her in Latin in exameter form regarding chess. Only fragments of this poem, the title being \\"The Pessopedia\\", remain today. In 1617 he wrote and published Il Gioco degli Scacchi (The Game of Chess), subdivided into eight books where \\"learning the rules, the odds, the endgames, the blindfold chess and a discussion about the true origins of chess in itself\\". This was the first book ever printed in Militello, on request of the Princes of Butera, by Giovanni Rosso from Trento; in this poem Carrera collected and elaborated in a systematic fashion information given by previous authors. After the Prince of Branciforte's death, he moved to Messina, then to Canicatt√¨ and finally to Catania. Here in 1635, using an alias, he published the \\"Risposta di Valentino Vespaio contro l'apologia di Alessandro Salvio\\" (\\"Valentino Vespaio's answer against Alessandro Salvio's explanation\\"), where he debated the accusations and criticisms made against him from Salvio. Famous and esteemed, he died on September 18, 1647 in Messina. Carrera is also remembered as the inventor of chess variant (Carrera's chess) on an 8x10 chessboard, in which there were added two new pieces called the \\"Champion\\" (a combination of the moves of the tower (rook) and the knight) and \\"Centaurus\\" (a combination of the bishop and the knight); these innovations had more fame than the ones made by Piacenza and Marinelli. It was a predecessor of Capablanca Chess. He is not remembered as a great live player but as a master of theory and a great source of information regarding contemporary players of his time.

Located in the province of Zambales but governed independently from the province, it has a population of people according to the . Along with the municipality of Subic (and later, Castillejos and San Antonio as well as the municipalities of Dinalupihan, Hermosa and Morong in Bataan), it comprises Metro Olongapo, one of the twelve metropolitan areas in the Philippines. Etymology According to popular legend, there once was a group of warring tribes who lived in the area in and around what is now the modern city. A wise old man (known as apo), seeing the perils of disunity, exerted great effort toward uniting the warring tribes. There were, however, some who bitterly opposed his idea, and one day the old man just disappeared without a trace. After a long search, the old man's body was found, but with the head missing. It is said that the tribesmen launched search parties to locate the severed head of the man; to the Sambals, decapitation was the only permissible form of assassination.It was recorded as customary for the Sambal to execute those who have taken another person's life, unless done by decapitation. Their manner of execution was to bore a hole at the top of the skull and then scrape out the brains. These efforts proved to be futile, and the search was eventually called off. A young boy, however, vowed to himself that he'll never stop searching until he found the elder's head. He searched for weeks, but found nothing. Then, one day, he chanced upon what appeared to be the old man's head, resting on top of a bamboo pole. The boy, while holding the severed head, ran back to his people crying, \\"Olo nin apo!

To this day, the old man's head acts as a symbol of the people's unity in what is now a modern city. History British period Britain ruled the Philippines for a short time, from 1762 to 1764. The British invasion of the Philippines was the first challenge to Spain's control of the archipelago after 191 years of rule. The Royal Navy and British Army joined with the East India Company in Madras to capture Spain's Asian colony. In conjunction with the attack against Spain's key possession in the Americas, Havana, both settlements were successfully seized. However, in the Philippines, whilst the expedition was launched as part of a plan to harass the Spaniards in their possessions, as well as for commercial gain and new territories, the military campaign led by General William Draper and Admiral Samuel Cornish, may have been launched under the guise of an invasion in order to gain prize money. The publication \\"When Britain Ruled the Philippines 1762‚Äì1764\\" describes the events as they unfolded at the Admiralty in London and at the East India Company in Madras, leading to the invasion and occupation of the capital city of Manila and the port city of Cavite. The capital was looted, a galleon was seized, and the British commanders imposed a ransom of four million dollars upon the Spaniards. The enormous sums in prize money and valuables seized mainly benefited the commanders. Spanish period In 1868, a Spanish military expedition was dispatched to study the possibility of relocating the Cavite Naval Station in Subic Bay due to its unhealthy condition. Spanish King Alfonso XII through a Royal Decree made Subic Bay (then called Subig) as Spain's stronghold in the Far East in 1884. Vice Admiral Juan Bautista de Antiquiera made Olongapo a settlement for the Spanish Navy. On March 8, 1885, the Spanish Naval commission authorized construction of the Arsenal in Olongapo. The Spanish planned to make their naval station, and the village of Olongapo an island, protected against attack by rebels. The Spanish Navy Yard occupied the entire area east of the Spanish Gate. Employing Filipino labor, they did extensive dredging of the harbor and the inner basin and built a drainage canal. The canal served both to drain the swampy area around the yard and also to form a line of defense. Within ten years, the Spaniards had erected walls and markers to fence off the arsenal. They had shops and buildings erected. The Spanish government spent almost three decades developing the naval station. From higher naval commands, the order was sent to fortify Grande Island at the mouth of Subic Bay with mines and cannons. But this project was hardly begun before it was overtaken by the rout of the Spanish Navy in Manila Bay by US Admiral George Dewey. American period Aerial view of the Olongapo Naval Station in 1928 On May 1, 1898, the construction of the Spanish Administration Building was hardly completed when Admiral Dewey's flagship, , led the Asiatic Fleet into Manila Bay. A detachment of Admiral Dewey's fleet bombarded the navy yard. Eventually, after the surrender, Spain relinquished all her rights in the Philippines to the United States. This marked the end of more than three hundred years of Spanish rule over the islands. Realizing the tremendous importance of Olongapo as a naval facility, the U.S. Navy decided to keep the base in functioning order; the President of the United States, then Theodore Roosevelt, on November 9, 1901, by executive order, reserved the waters of Subic and some of the adjacent lands for naval purposes. The naval station was widened and with the establishment of the American rule in the Philippines. American defenses in the islands were facilities left by the Spanish Navy which were taken over by the United States. Olongapo grew in direct proportion to the growth of the naval station. More people came to live in Olongapo since the Navy offered employment. To most Filipinos during that time, it was a welcome change. The promise of a different kind of experience as shop workers and office help induced many young men to leave their farms and fishing boats to work in the Navy Yard. Others finding the lure of the sea irresistible joined the U.S. Navy. Olongapo impressed its visitors as being one of the finest communities in the country. People passing through the town never failed to comment on its cleanliness and orderliness. World War II When the war broke out in 1941, the old town was obliterated. Olongapo had to suffer the brunt of destruction twice. On December 14, 1941, Japanese bombers attacked the Olongapo/Subic Bay area. Ten days later, the order was given to burn Subic Bay Naval Station and withdraw. Olongapo was set aflame by the local Filipinos in anticipation of Japanese troop arrival. The USS New York was scuttled in Subic Bay.Subic Bay History ‚Äì 1940's. Subicbaypi.com (April 8, 1942). Retrieved on 2013-07-28. When the American forces made a last-ditch stand on the Bataan peninsula, the Naval Station was abandoned and most of its facilities were burned before the Japanese came. In 1945, Olongapo was again bombed, shelled and burned. Joint American and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops aided the recognized guerrilla fighters in liberating Olongapo from the Japanese forces. With the exceptions of the Station Chapel (it was the Olongapo Parish Church before the war) and the Spanish Gate, none of its former landmarks withstood the sweep of the war's fury. The general headquarters between the United States Army, Philippine Commonwealth Army & Philippine Constabulary was stationed in Olongapo during and aftermath in World War II and active on 1945 to 1946 were operated against the Japanese for the liberation in Central Luzon. Reconstruction and rehabilitation Shortly after the war was over, the Philippines was granted independence. Olongapo was one of the principal navy bases retained by the US. The Navy started to rebuild the town after the hostilities ceased. Olongapo was built on a new undeveloped site a couple of miles north of its former location. The prewar town site became a part of the Naval Station. The first few years after the war were difficult for the new town, as everything in the new Olongapo was in a deplorable state. There was no electric power and no drainage system. The water supply and sanitation facilities were inadequate, and streets were unpaved. Gradually, Olongapo evolved into a better community: new businesses were established; housing projects were planned, civic facilities were restored. Due to the Korean War, the US spent over $170 million to convert the base into the homeport of her Navy's Seventh Fleet, developing the Cubi Naval Air Station as the largest US installation of its kind in Asia. Naval authorities relocated the residence from the area of the former Public Works Center area to what is now the hub of Olongapo ‚Äì along what is now known as Rizal Avenue and Ramon Magsaysay Drive, and in the Barangays New Asinan and New Kalalake areas. Zoning of Olongapo was patterned after American practice where streets are constructed along straight lines. The magnitude of facilities construction in the Olongapo and Subic Bay area brought growth and prosperity to Olongapo. By 1956, migrants from nearby towns and provinces had swelled the population to 39,180. Independence and Cityhood Olongapo and the bridge leading to NS Subic Bay, 1981. Unlike the rest of the Philippines which gained independence from the United States after World War II in 1946, Olongapo was governed as a part of the United States naval reservation. The Subic Bay Naval Base commanding officer was chairman of the Olongapo town council, school board, and hospital board. Olongapo's 60,000 Filipino residents paid taxes to the United States Navy and those accused of crimes involving American servicemen were tried in US Navy courts. In July 1955, Manila mayor Arsenio Lacson announced that US service personnel accused of crimes in Manila would be tried in Philippine courts because of US Navy abuses of Filipinos in Olongapo. On October 23, 1959, Olongapo was placed under martial law when Robert Grant, the American owner of an Olongapo auto parts store was killed and the US Navy declined to identify or try the Naval Supply Depot sentry who shot him.Anderson, Gerald Subic Bay from Magellan to Pinatubo: The History of the U.S. Naval Station Subic Bay Gerald Anderson (2009) pp.130‚Äì138 Olongapo City was the last piece of Philippine territory surrendered by the US to the country in the 1950s. On December 7, 1959, 56,000 acres of land with electrical, telephone and water utilities was relinquished to Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Felixberto Serrano. The first mayor appointed was civic leader Ruben Geronimo and he was later succeeded by business entrepreneur Ildefonso Arriola. Six years later, through the efforts of Rep. Ramon Magsaysay Jr. in Congress and Sen. Genaro Magsaysay in the Senate, Pres. Ferdinand Marcos signed R.A. 4645, heeding the clamor of the people, Olongapo was reconverted to a chartered city on June 1, 1966. The adjacent U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay headed by Manuel Ardonia was the largest United States Navy installation in the Pacific at the time, and employed 15,000 Filipino civilians. The base was visited by 215 ships per month as Vietnam War activity peaked in 1967. The nightclubs along Ramon Magsaysay Drive between the naval base main gate and Rizal Avenue were notoriously popular among the 4,225,000 servicemen visiting the base that year.Tucker, Spencer C. The Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: A Political, Social, and Military History (2011) p.863 Sailors of the war remember talented Filipino musicians and singers, inexpensive San Miguel beer, attractive teen-age prostitutes, erotic floor shows, Jeepney rides back to the naval base and children diving for coins tossed from the bridge over the estuarine drainage channel in front of the naval base main gate.Sherwood, John Afterburner: Naval Aviators and the Vietnam War NYU Press (2004) pp.27‚Äì28 Olongapo was then upgraded as a highly urbanized city on December 7, 1983. Mount Pinatubo eruption Ash from Mount Pinatubo covers Naval Station Subic Bay. June 15, 1991 was a memorable date in Olongapo. Mount Pinatubo, from the city, violently erupted with a force 8 times greater than the May 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. Volcanic clouds blocked out the sun. Volcanic earthquakes and heavy muddy rain, as well as thunderstorms from a typhoon passing over Central Luzon made Black Saturday a 36-hour nightmare. This caused widespread damage to the US facility and Olongapo City. On September 16, 1991, the Senate leaders of the Philippines did not grant an extension of the existing RP-US Military Bases Agreement between the Republic of the Philippines and the US, thus terminating the stay of US military in the Philippines. Present-day Olongapo The U.S. flag is lowered and Philippine flag is raised during turnover of Naval Station Subic Bay. At present, Olongapo is currently headed by Mayor Rolen C. Paulino who broke the Gordon Dynasty in the city during the 2013 Local Election, succeeding the city's leadership from James Bong Gordon, Jr. the brother of Richard Gordon. Olongapo took the National headlines during the incumbency of Mayor Richard Gordon, who, Like his father before him, who was against the departure of the US military forces, lobbied for the turnover of the facility and its conversion into a freeport in 1992. To date, the renowned volunteerism strategy and overturning an ailing economy to prosperity after double disasters ‚Äì Mt. Pinatubo's eruption and withdrawal of US Bases ‚Äì is an unparalleled achievement. The People of Olongapo; men, women, and even young adults led by City Officials and its Mayor Richard \\"Dick\\" Gordon, boldly bolted into a strong corps of 8,000 volunteers who protected and preserved the abandoned US Naval Base facilities from poachers. He complemented this with an aggressive advocacy to convert the area into a protected area and industrial zone. Later, he launched an aggressive international investment promotion which resulted in the acceleration of the development of a prime industrial and tourism zone in the country, the Subic Bay Freeport Zone (SBFZ). As the first chartered city and highly urbanized city in its province, it rose from being a \\"sin city\\" in the 1960s and 1970s into a \\"model city\\" in the 1980s and 2000s. The city is known for its innovative methods of urban management in the 1980s when it comes to addressing crime and sanitation that has been said to be copied by local governments nationwide. The city pioneered the Color-coded transport system, Integrated Solid Waste Management System, Volunteerism, Organized vendors, elderly, youth and women's groups, use of slogans, People's Law Enforcement Board, Emergency Response Team, and international awards such as the UNESCO Cities for Peace representing Asia and the Pacific in 1997 and the Konrad Adenauer Local Medal of Excellence in 1999. The city has also been awarded as a GAWAD KALASAG Hall of Famer for its Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (DRRMO), DRRMO was eventually awarded as a Presidential Lingkod Bayan Awardee in 2013. The city has been known for being recognized as a Child Friendly and Business Friendly City, Olongapo is also a recipient of several awards for its outstanding performance for its local health programs, best run City Hospital, National TESDA KABALIKAT Awardee (2016) for its Skills, Employment & Livelihood Programs and a two (2) time National Best Public Employment Service Office (PESO) for Highly Urbanized City category (2016 & 2017).  Geography  Situated at the Southern entry point of Zambales and the Northwestern interior of the Subic Bay area, Olongapo City is north of Manila. The land area of Olongapo City is . The city proper is located on a tidal flatland, with the rugged Zambales Mountains on its three sides, and the Bataan and Subic Bay at its base.

Infrastructure  Subic Bay International Airport  Transportation  = Airport = The Subic Bay International Airport serves the immediate area of the Subic Bay Freeport Zone and the general area of Olongapo City (it is located in the adjacent town of Morong, Bataan). This airport was once the Naval Air Station Cubi Point. The terminal has two gates. It has been proposed to be converted into a logistics hub. Currently the south-west ramp is used by US Armed Forces as part of the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement between the Philippines and the US. = Sea Port = The Port of Subic is one of the busiest, largest, historical and most important of Ports in the Philippines. The Port is operated and managed by the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority (SBMA). It covers the fenced area of the former U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay located in the south- west of Luzon Island in the Philippines surrounded by the municipality of Subic and Olongapo City in Zambales, and Hermosa and Morong in Bataan = Roads = The city has an organized road network, featuring a series of rectangular street grids. The primary road that connects Olongapo to the rest of the other is the Jose Abad Santos Avenue. In the city's main district, the names of those streets running from North to South follow the English alphabet's order. While streets running East to West are numbered from 1st to 27th, starting from the South parallel and up. Even streets are on the East side of the city while the Odd streets are on the West. Most of the roads in Olongapo are made of concrete and asphalt. = Public Transportation = The city boasts its Color-coded Public Transportation System which it has pioneered in the country. All public utility jeepneys and tricycles have its own color code depending on the district, zone or route that it is serving. It is also used for the computation of fares. For tricycles, fares will differ depending on your zone of origin and destination. For jeepneys, fares increases on every kilometer after the first three kilometers of the route, with an exception on yellow jeepneys, which has a fixed fare end-to-end. The minimum fare for tricycles are Php 7.50 per person, while Php 7.00 for jeepneys. Taxi services are also operated in the city but are limited.

Local bus terminals are also present and are primarily used for transportation in neighboring towns and inside the Subic Bay Freeport Zone. Road infrastructure Olongapo is accessible through the National Highway (via Zigzag Road) from Hermosa and Dinalupihan, Bataan. The National Highway cuts through the city center and goes through north up to Barangay Barreto and then on to the neighboring town of Subic, and the rest of the towns in Zambales up to Pangasinan province. Another access to the city is via SCTEX and Subic‚ÄìTipo Expressway exiting to the gates of Subic Bay Freeport Zone and also, from the south, Morong, Bataan (via Balanga, Bataan) through the Morong gate of Subic Bay Freeport Zone.  Public Utilities  = Electricity = Electricity services were formerly provided by the government-run Public Utilities Department (PUD) since the city was founded. However, in the late 2000s, the city faced debt in its electricity distribution costs amounting to P5 billion to power suppliers and threatened to cut the city from the Luzon power grid. Then Mayor James Gordon Jr. also attributed the crisis to low collection rate due to nonpayment or debts incurred by consumers, widespread energy theft and corruption in the PUD. The situation worsened because of interests imposed by Private Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp. (PSALM), the refusal of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) to grant an increase in power rates, and the years of delay in the PUD's privatization. In 2013, through Republic Act No. 10373, the PUD was sold for Php 610 million to Olongapo Electricity Distribution Company (OEDC), an affiliate of Cagayan Electric Power and Light Company (CEPALCO), which was given a 25-year franchise to take over the city's power distributor. The company has since upgraded the city's obsolete and dilapidated distribution network and has made significant improvements to the city's electricity services. = Water = Water services are provided by Subic Water and Sewerage Company (also known as Subic Water. Not to be confused with Subic Water District (SWD), which is a different water distribution company serving the neighboring towns of Subic, Zambales.).

In March 2016, this was reversed and the city has bought back its shares because the city wanted to have a representation in Subic Water because the city's constituents accounted for the majority of Subic Water's customers.

Junk faxes are the faxed equivalent of spam or junk mail. Proponents of this advertising medium often use the terms broadcast fax or fax advertising to avoid the negative connotation of the term junk fax. Junk faxes are generally considered to be a nuisance since they waste toner, ink and paper in fax machines. History Junk faxing came into widespread use in the late 1980s as a result of the development and proliferation of relatively inexpensive desktop fax machines which resulted in rapid growth in the number of fax machines in the U.S. The invention of the computer-based fax board in 1985 by Dr. Hank Magnuski, provided an efficient platform for reaching those fax machines with minimal cost and effort. The fax machines of this period typically used expensive thermal paper and a common complaint about junk faxes was that they consumed that expensive paper without permission, thus shifting the cost of printing the advertisement to the recipient. In the U.S., the passage of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act in 1991 along with action by individual states reduced the use of junk faxes at that time. However, by the late 1990s, junk faxing had once again become a widespread problem in the U.S., with the entry of a number of large-scale fax broadcasters who boasted of the capacity to send millions of fax advertisements per day. Because the legal restrictions of fax advertising are more widely known today, junk faxes are now predominately used in connection with disreputable or fly-by-night marketers. National regulations United States The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (47 USC 227), or TCPA, among other things specifically outlawed junk faxing: :the use of any telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement to a telephone facsimile machine (paragraph (b)(1)(C)) The TCPA also requires a fax transmitter to identify the source phone number and transmitting organization or individual on each page. The process of war dialing to determine what phone numbers reach fax machines was also prohibited by the FCC rules under the TCPA. The TCPA, in particular the junk fax provision, has been challenged in court on First Amendment grounds, but the law has withstood legal challenges. In 2005, the United States Congress passed the Junk Fax Prevention Act of 2005. It amended the TCPA so as to no longer prohibit unsolicited fax advertisements if: :the unsolicited advertisement is from a sender with an established business relationship with the recipient(paragraph (b)(1)(C)(i)) and the sender complies with other requirements. In April 2006, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) implemented changes to the fax advertising rules of the TCPA. The new rules: (1) codify an established business relationship (EBR) exemption to the prohibition on sending unsolicited fax advertisements; (2) define EBR as used in the context of unsolicited fax advertisements; (3) require the sender of fax advertisements to provide specified notice and contact information on the fax that allows recipients to ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù of any future transmissions from the sender; and (4) specify the circumstances under which a request to ‚Äúopt-out‚Äù complies with the Act. The new rules took effect in August 2006. The federal TCPA permits state junk faxing laws that are equal to or more restrictive than the federal law, and so many states have their own laws regarding junk faxes. Additionally, some courts have ruled that unsolicited fax advertisements are common law conversion, independent of any statutory provisions or exemptions. =Enforcement= The FCC can investigate violations and impose fines on the violators. Individuals who receive junk faxes can file a complaint with the FCC. Complaints must specify: * That the sender did not have permission to send the fax (i.e. unsolicited) * That the complainant did not have a prior business relationship with the sender * That the fax was for a good or service * Any telephone number or addresses included in the fax * Your name, address, and a telephone number where you can be reached during the day * The telephone number through which you received the fax advertisement * A copy of the fax advertisement, if possible, or confirmation that you have retained a copy of the fax Failure to provide any of the above information may result in the complaint being closed without further action. State authorities can also take actions against violations of the TCPA. It is also possible for the recipient of a junk fax to bring a private suit against the violator in an appropriate court of their state. Through a private suit, the recipient can either recover the actual monetary loss that resulted from the TCPA violation, or receive $500 in damages for each violation, whichever is greater. The court may triple the damages for each violation if it finds that the defendant acted willingly or knowingly. The FCC and/or the FTC can impose additional civil penalties of up to $11,000.00 per fax transmitted.  United Kingdom  According to the government legislation on the 1st of May 1999, it is unlawful to send an individual an unsolicited sales and marketing fax without any prior consent of the customer. If the fax receiver is a company or corporate instances, fax communications are permitted unless the subscriber has previously notified the caller that such communications should not be sent on that line; or the subscriber‚Äôs line is listed in the register kept under regulation 25 of PECR. This register is maintained on behalf of OFCOM by the Direct Marketing Association and is branded as the Facsimile Preference Service (‚ÄúFPS‚Äù). Canada Unsolicited faxes are regulated by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) and must follow certain guidelines, but there is no individual right to sue the senders. Information on the rules of telemarketing faxes in Canada can be found in the CRTC Unsolicited Telecommunications Rules. Individuals wishing to avoid such faxes may enroll in the CRTC's National Do Not Call List; its effectiveness, however, is a point of controversy. Hong Kong The Office of the Telecommunications Authority (OTA) has implemented regulations to address junk faxes. Complaints will result in disconnection of the offenders' phone service.

Having played in small pub bands from the age of 14, after graduating school McBrain paid his bills with session work before he joined a variety of artists, such as Streetwalkers, Pat Travers, and the French political band, Trust. He joined Iron Maiden in time to debut on their fourth album (replacing Clive Burr), Piece of Mind (1983), and has remained with them since, contributing to a total of thirteen studio releases. Biography McBrain was born in Hackney, London, and first wanted to learn the drums at a young age after watching Joe Morello performing with The Dave Brubeck Quartet on television. At the age of ten, he started to play drums with pots, pans and other kitchen utensils, before, to his parents' dismay, he began drumming on the gas cooker with a pair of knives and chipped off the paintwork. McBrain recalls that he was eleven or twelve before his father bought him his first drum kit, \\"which was basically one snare, one tom-tom, one cymbal, two drumsticks and a pair of brushes.\\" He soon started playing Rolling Stones and Beatles covers with school bands, before he began regularly playing \\"pubs and weddings\\" by the age of 14. McBrain broke his nose after a fight in school that left him with his trademark flat features. He never underwent surgery to repair his nose. Although he obtained a degree in engineering at Southgate Technical College at his parents' request, upon finishing his education, McBrain paid his rent by undertaking session work, before deciding to join his first \\"proper\\" band, \\"The 18th Fairfield Walk\\", later known as \\"Peyton Bond\\". A small pub band, which he decided was \\"never gonna go anywhere\\" as they only performed Otis Redding, The Beatles and The Who covers, McBrain soon left to join \\"The Wells Street Blues Band\\", which renamed themselves \\"The Axe\\" in 1969. Although this group would play their own material, the band split up after an argument between the singer and the guitarist, and McBrain began playing with Billy Day, a singer and keyboardist, and Michael \\"Mickey\\" Lesley, a guitarist, in 1971. At that point, he was known as \\"Nicky\\", a nickname given to him by his parents after his teddy bear, Nicholas, until an intoxicated Billy Day introduced him to Dick Asher, head of CBS Records, as \\"Neeko\\", while they were recording at CBS Studios, Whitfield Street. McBrain liked the name, changing it to Nicko \\"so that it sounded more English\\", and decided to keep it even after leaving the group. In 1973, McBrain performed on a single by Cockerel Chorus, \\"Nice One Cyril\\", on the label Young Blood. Also in 1973, McBrain played on a self-titled album by guitarist Gordon Giltrap. This is notable not only as McBrain's album debut, but also because Giltrap in 1978 released an album called Fear of the Dark and used a font for his logo that is quite similar to the one used by Iron Maiden. In 1975, he began playing with Streetwalkers, before joining Pat Travers, singer Jenny Darren, McKitty and then the French band, Trust, with whom he met Iron Maiden for the first time, while touring together in 1981. In 1982, the band asked McBrain to replace their previous drummer, Clive Burr, and, as news of Burr's departure had not yet been announced, McBrain made his first appearance with Iron Maiden on German TV disguised as Eddie. He formed a close partnership with bassist, Steve Harris, and completed what many critics consider the band's \\"definitive\\" line-up, releasing a series of gold and platinum selling albums throughout the 1980s. Although the band's line-up changed during the 1990s, McBrain remained in Iron Maiden and, since the return of Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson in 1999, the group has undergone a resurgence in popularity, and are now considered by some as \\"bigger than ever\\". When he's not recording and touring with Iron Maiden, McBrain often plays with side projects including a band called McBrain Damage which played Iron Maiden covers. In March 2017, he was a guest drummer with the 8G Band on Late Night with Seth Meyers. Although he writes the drum parts for all the band's songs, McBrain registered his first and only album songwriting credit for \\"New Frontier\\", from 2003's Dance of Death, which expresses his opposition to human cloning, arising from his religious beliefs. However, McBrain had received two previous songwriting credits for non-album tracks: 1984's \\"Mission From 'Arry\\", which was actually a recording of a backstage argument with Steve Harris, and 1992's \\"Nodding Donkey Blues\\", which were B-sides of the singles \\"2 Minutes to Midnight\\" and \\"Be Quick or Be Dead\\", respectively. Drumming style McBrain's drumming has been an important element of Iron Maiden's sound from 1983's Piece of Mind onwards, with guitarist Adrian Smith remarking that, \\"he always had the chops and the technique, but in Maiden he really exploded, to the point where a lot of stuff we did after he joined was then founded on his playing, all those busy patterns he does, displaying tremendous technique.\\" As described in detail on the band's 2004 documentary, Piece of Mind's opening track, \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", famously displays McBrain's ability to use the single drum pedal very quickly, plus his rapid tom fills. He is often considered among the best and most influential heavy metal/hard rock drummers of all time. In the 2008 Live After Death DVD, Steve Gadd, McBrain's then drum technician, comments that, on the World Slavery Tour, some drummers would refer to McBrain as an 'octopus' after witnessing the way in which his stamina gives him the ability to use all of his large signature drum kit in concert. McBrain often employs the back end of his left hand drum stick to allow for more powerful \\"snare hits\\". He is known for not using a double bass pedal, with Bruce Dickinson commenting that he refused to use one on \\"Where Eagles Dare\\", considering them 'undrummerish'. He claims to have only ever used a double pedal once on \\"Face in the Sand\\", from Dance of Death, preferring to use a DW 5000 Accelerator single pedal. Since switching to the DW pedal in 2000, McBrain plays barefoot, stating that it gives him \\"more freedom.\\" Steve Harris remarks that \\"...he can play all kinds of music. Drummers from other bands sit round the back of him to see what he's doing, but he's got his kit set so he doesn't even look at what he's hitting half the time\\". After McBrain joined the band in 1982, Harris also noted how much easier playing with McBrain was for a songwriter,'Band' interactive sub section of the Enhanced CD-ROM Piece of Mind (1998 re-master edition) with Adrian Smith claiming that, \\"Steve loves playing with him. [They] used to work for hours going over these bass and drum patterns.\\" In 1988, McBrain collaborated with Andrew Chapman on a book entitled Iron Maiden & Nicko McBrain's Rhythms of the Beast, which was published by Warner Bros. Music in 1990. The book featured complete transcriptions of McBrain's drum work on twelve classic Iron Maiden songs, including six live versions as recorded on the band's 1985 album Live After Death. After selling internationally for several years, the book was taken out of print. Used copies are occasionally found for sale online. In 1991, McBrain released an instructional drum video, entitled Rhythms of the Beast (not related to the above book of the same name), which was re-released on DVD in 2010. The video features McBrain demonstrating his technique, and covers tuning, soloing and parts of the drum kit. In 2020, McBrain was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame. Equipment McBrain is a long-time user of Paiste cymbals and currently plays British Drum Company drums, moving from Sonor Drums and having previously endorsed Premier. For A Matter of Life and Death he used his Ludwig metal shell LM 402 snare drum which was purchased in 1975, making it the oldest drum in his kit. He endorses Vic Firth signature drum sticks, also using them for his own drumming. As of 2016, McBrain also uses Remo drumheads, Sonor hardware, an LP cowbell and a DW 9000 single pedal (painted gold).

He lives in Boca Raton, Florida. McBrain converted to Christianity in 1999 after an experience in the Spanish River Church, near his Boca Raton home. His wife, Rebecca, had been asking him to attend with her, and upon entering the church, McBrain soon found himself crying as he experienced a \\"calling\\". Recounting the tale, he said \\"I just sat there thinking, 'I didn't drink last night... why can't I stand?' I had this love affair with Jesus going on in my heart.\\" In 1988, McBrain appeared as a guest on The Sooty Show, in which he played drums with Sooty and Sweep. In reference to his appearance on the show, McBrain's drum kit has since been decorated with a Sooty puppet, which is often dressed accordingly with the band's corresponding tours. McBrain has a pilot's licence, for which he has a twin engine rating. In 2009, he opened a restaurant called Rock 'N' Roll Ribs in Coral Springs, Florida. The restaurant received positive reviews on an episode of Check, Please! South Florida and was awarded \\"Best Ribs of 2012\\" by New Times Broward-Palm Beach. McBrain is a fan of snooker and has attended the World Snooker Championships at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield. He also enjoys playing golf in his spare time, along with his bandmate Dave Murray, and is a friend of Swedish golfer and Florida resident Jesper Parnevik, whom he met at Ullna Golf Club in Sweden. Jaguar XJ6 Greatest Hits customized for McBrain Since he is a lifelong enthusiast of Jaguar Cars, the manufacturer built a custom XKR-S model to McBrain's specifications in 2012. In March 2018, Jaguar Land Rover Classic Works revealed a customized Jaguar XJ Series III for McBrain. In 2015, McBrain stopped drinking alcohol after seeing an interview in which he had had too much wine and has remained sober to this day. In 2018, he also launched a musical instrument store named Drum One in Manchester, England. The retailer specialises in drum kits and related merchandise. To promote the launch of the store, McBrain conducted an interview with Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice Discography ;Cockerel Chorus * Nice One Cyril (1973) ;Gordon Giltrap * Giltrap (1973) ;Streetwalkers * Downtown Flyers (1975) * Red Card (1976) ;Pat Travers * Makin' Magic (1977) * Putting It Straight (1977) ;Trust * Marche ou Cr√®ve (Original French Release)/Savage (English Language Version) (1981) ;WhoCares * \\"Out of My Mind\\" (2011) ;Solo * Rhythms of the Beast (instructional drum video) (1991) ;Iron Maiden * Piece of Mind (1983) * Powerslave (1984) * Somewhere in Time (1986) * Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988) * No Prayer for the Dying (1990) * Fear of the Dark (1992) * The X Factor (1995) * Virtual XI (1998) * Brave New World (2000) * Dance of Death (2003) * A Matter of Life and Death (2006) * The Final Frontier (2010) * The Book of Souls (2015)  Notes   Literature   External links  * Nicko McBrain's DrumOne Nicko McBrain Interview NAMM Oral History Library (2018) 1952 births Living people English rock drummers English heavy metal drummers Iron Maiden members Trust (French band) members English people of Scottish descent English people of Irish descent English expatriates in the United States People from Hackney Central English Christians Converts to Christianity Stretch (band) members Streetwalkers members ","title":"Nicko McBrain"},{"id":"712481","text":"Location of Kurgan Oblast in Russia Location of Vologda Oblast in Russia Belozersky District is the name of several administrative and municipal districts in Russia.

At , it is the largest LDS temple by floor area. Dedicated in 1893, it is the sixth temple completed by the church, requiring 40 years to complete, and the fourth temple built since the Mormon exodus from Nauvoo, Illinois, in 1846. On April 19, 2019 the LDS Church announced that the temple would close on December 29, 2019 for seismic renovations that are anticipated to take approximately four years. Details Cutaway model showing the interior layout of the temple The Salt Lake Temple is the centerpiece of the Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. Like other LDS temples, the church and its members consider it sacred and a temple recommend is required to enter, so there are no public tours inside the temple as there are for other adjacent buildings on Temple Square. In 1912, the first public photographs of the interior were published in the book The House of the Lord, by James E. Talmage.Talmage, James. The House of the Lord. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, 1912 Since then, various photographs have been published, including by Life magazine in 1938. The temple grounds are open to the public and are a popular tourist attraction. Due to its location at LDS Church headquarters and its historical significance, Latter-day Saints from around the world patronize the temple. The Salt Lake Temple is also the location of the weekly meetings of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. As such, there are special meeting rooms in the building for these purposes, including the Holy of Holies, which are not part of other temples. The temple includes some elements thought to evoke Solomon's Temple at Jerusalem. It is oriented towards Jerusalem and the large basin used as a baptismal font is mounted on the backs of twelve oxen, as was the Molten Sea in Solomon's Temple (see Chronicles 4:2‚Äì4). (However, the literal interpretation of the Biblical verses has been disputed.) At the east end of the building, the height of the center pinnacle to the base of the angel Moroni is 210 feet, or 120 cubits, making this Temple 20 cubits taller than the Temple of Solomon. Name In 1999, as the building of LDS temples accelerated, the church announced a formal naming convention for all existing and future temples. For temples in the United States and Canada, the temple's name is generally the city or town in which the temple is located, followed by the name of the applicable state or province (with no comma). For temples outside of the U.S. and Canada, the temple's name is generally the city name (as above) followed by the country name. However, for reasons on which the church did not elaborate, the Salt Lake Temple was not renamed the \\"Salt Lake City Utah Temple\\". (The Provo City Center Temple is the only other temple that does not include a state, province, or country in the temple's name.) Location The temple is in downtown Salt Lake City, with several mountain peaks close by. Nearby, a shallow stream, City Creek, splits and flows both to the west and to the south, flowing into the Jordan River. There is a wall around the temple site. The surrounding wall became the first permanent structure on what has become known as Temple Square. The wall is a uniform 15 feet high but varies in appearance because of the site's southwest slope. Uses The temple is considered the house of God and is reserved for special ceremonies for practicing Latter-Day Saints. The main ordinance rooms are used during the endowment ceremony‚Äînamely the creation, garden, telestial, terrestrial, and celestial rooms in that order of use. A washing and anointing ceremony is also administered, and until 1921, the rooms were also used for healing rituals of washing and anointing for the sick or pregnant and were administered by women and men. The temple also serves as a place for marriage sealing ceremonies for live and deceased persons. Additional uses include functioning as a location for baptisms for the dead, baptisms for health (until being discontinued in 1921), and, briefly, for re-baptism for the renewal of covenants. Other rituals performed in the temple include the second anointing ordinance for live and deceased persons, and meeting rooms for church leaders. Temple construction and dedication Granite for temple being quarried at Little Cottonwood Canyon (1872) The temple's location was first marked by LDS prophet Brigham Young, the second president of the church, on July 28, 1847, just four days after he arrived in the Salt Lake Valley. In 1901 the apostle Anthon H. Lund recorded in his journal that \\"it is said\\" that Oliver Cowdery's divining rod was used to locate the temple site.Anthon H. Lund Journal, July 5, 1901, cited by BYU Prof. D. Michael Quinn https://byustudies.byu.edu/content/latter-day-saint-prayer-circles The temple site was dedicated on February 14, 1853 by Heber C. Kimball. Groundbreaking ceremonies were presided over by Young, who laid the cornerstone on April 6 of that year. The architect was Truman O. Angell, and the temple features both Gothic and Romanesque elements. Sandstone was originally used for the foundation. During the Utah War, the foundation was buried and the lot made to look like a plowed field to prevent unwanted attention from federal troops. After tensions eased in 1858 and work on the temple resumed, it was discovered that many of the foundation stones had cracked, making them unsuitable for use. Although not all of the sandstone was replaced, the inadequate sandstone was replaced. The walls are quartz monzonite (which has the appearance of granite) from Little Cottonwood Canyon, twenty miles (32 km) southeast of the temple site. Oxen transported the quarried rock initially, but as the Transcontinental Railroad neared completion in 1869 the remaining stones were carried by rail at a much faster rate. A plaque with construction details The capstone‚Äîthe granite sphere that holds the statue of the Angel Moroni‚Äîwas laid on April 6, 1892, by means of an electric motor and switch operated by Wilford Woodruff, the church's fourth president, thus completing work on the temple's exterior. The Angel Moroni statue, standing tall, was placed on top of the capstone later the same day. At the capstone ceremony, Woodruff proposed the building's interior be finished within one year, which would allow the temple to be dedicated forty years to the day of its commencement. John R. Winder was instrumental in overseeing the interior's completion on schedule; he would serve as a member of the temple presidency until his death in 1910. Woodruff dedicated the temple on April 6, 1893, exactly forty years after the cornerstone was laid.  2019‚Äì2024 renovation  Aerial computer rendering of Temple Square upon renovation completion = Structural = The temple is planned to undergo a seismic retrofitting in the form of base isolation and wall strengthening. It will be made to withstand a magnitude 7.3 earthquake, the strongest expected magnitude in the Salt Lake Valley. The renovation was announced on April 19, 2019 with construction starting on December 29, and is expected to take about four years until the temple's estimated reopening in 2024. Other facilities in Temple Square (and certain parts of the main temple) will be demolished, reconstructed, and modernized inline with seismic code. = Nonstructural = Computer-generated cutaway model of the Salt Lake Temple post-renovation showing the newly-installed base isolators and underground facilities. The temple's outdated mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems will be replaced with more modern and efficient systems. The walls around the temple will be reconstructed with new entranceways and openings for patron and visitor access, allowing easier viewing and passage. The interior of the temple, along with its historical artifacts, will be preserved and restored to their original design and aesthetic. Within Temple Square, the landscapes and plazas will be almost completely redone, adding new facilities, amenities, and visitor-oriented activities throughout the complex. Visitor access and tourism will still remain during the entire renovation process, but in regulated and coordinated fashion. Symbolism The Salt Lake Temple incorporates many symbolic adornments including Masonic symbols. Symbolism is an important subject in the LDS faith. These symbols include the following: Infographic of the locations and details of some Salt Lake Temple exterior symbols. * All-Seeing Eye ‚Äì The center tower on each side has a depiction of the All-Seeing Eye of God representing how God sees all things. Original 1854 design of the East side showing the horizontal angel, Sun faces, earth details, and compass and square window details. These elements were later modified or removed. * Angel Statue ‚Äì The golden Angel Moroni statue, by sculptor Cyrus E. Dallin, tops the capstone of the temple. It symbolizes the angel mentioned in that will come to welcome in the Second Coming of Christ. Early architectural plans showed two horizontally flying angels Page 33 archived here. and the earliest references to the Salt Lake Temple's angel were always Gabriel. The original blueprint drawings intended the angel to be wearing temple ceremonial clothing like the angel on the Nauvoo temple, but Paris-trained sculptor Dallin's 12.5-foot statue wears a crown instead of a temple cap that included a bright light which created a halo effect at night. As a result of an earthquake on March 18, 2020, the statue's trumpet broke. * Beehive ‚Äì The beehive symbol (which appears on the Utah state seal) appears on external doors and doorknobs and symbolizes the thrift, industry, perseverance, and order of the Mormon people. * Big Dipper ‚Äì On the west side of the temple the Big Dipper appears, which represents how the priesthood can help people find their way to heaven as the constellation helped travelers find the North Star. The uppermost stars on the temple's constellation align with the actual North Star. * Compass and Square ‚Äì Early plan drawings of the temple show the Masonic arrangements of a compass and square placed around the second and fourth floor windows, but the plans were changed during construction. These symbols had appeared on the Nauvoo Temple weathervane. * Clasped Hands ‚Äì Above each external door and doorknob appears the \\"hand clasp,\\" which is a representation of covenants that are made within temples or brotherly love. * Clouds ‚Äì On the east side of the temple are \\"clouds raining down\\" representing the way God has continued revelation and still speaks to man \\"like the rains out of Heaven\\" or alternatively a veil of ignorance or sin. * Earths ‚Äì The Earth Stones in the lower buttresses have been interpreted as the gospel of Christ spreading over the whole Earth. An original 1854 elevation plan showing the saturn stones, earth stone detail, Sun faces, and square and compass window accents. These elements were later discarded. * Saturns ‚Äì Early drawings and a written description by Angell showed Saturnstones along the top tier of the temple, though the design was changed years later. * Spires ‚Äì The six spires of the temple represent the power of the priesthood. The three spires on the east side are a little higher than those on the west: they represent the Melchizedek, or \\"higher priesthood\\", and the Aaronic, or \\"preparatory priesthood\\" respectively. The three spires on the east side represent the church's First Presidency and the twelve smaller spires on those three represent the Twelve Apostles. * Sun, Moon, and Stars ‚Äì Around the temple there are several carved stones depicting the Sun, Moon, and stars which correspond respectively to the celestial, terrestrial, and telestial kingdoms of glory in the afterlife. The sunstones have also been interpreted to represent God, the moonstones in different phases as representing different phases of life, and the starstones representing Jesus Christ. These symbols were drawn from the three lesser lights symbols in the Freemasonry practiced by many early church leaders in Nauvoo. Additionally, five-pointed stars have traditionally represented the five wounds of Christ (hands, feet, and side) and the five-pointed star with an elongated downward ray found on several LDS temples has been interpreted to represent Christ coming to Earth. Incidents Bombings Two bombing incidents have damaged the temple. On April 10, 1910, a bomb at the nearby Hotel Utah (now the Joseph Smith Memorial Building) damaged the trumpet of the Moroni statue atop the temple. On November 14, 1962, the southeast door of the Salt Lake Temple was bombed. FBI agents state that the explosive had been wrapped around the door handles on the temple's southeast entrance. The large wooden entrance doors were damaged by flying fragments of metal and glass. Damage to interior walls occurred 25 feet inside the temple, but damage to the interior was minor. Eleven exterior windows were shattered. 1999 Salt Lake City tornado The temple suffered light to moderate damage in 1999 when a tornado rated F2 on the Fujita Scale struck Salt Lake City. A wedding ceremony taking place at the time allowed a photographer taking photographs of the new couple to record video of the tornado as it passed near the temple, forcing the bride and groom and everyone with them to shelter against the temple doors and pillars for protection from the wind and debris. They were unable to be allowed inside to take shelter as the temple doors were locked. Despite being pelted with rain and hail, everyone survived, and were able to then come out to look at the damage to many of the trees around the temple grounds and surrounding buildings before resuming the ceremony. 2020 Salt Lake City earthquake On the morning of March 18, 2020, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck just outside Salt Lake City. Though most of the damage was outside the city, minor damage was inflicted on the temple. The trumpet of the Angel Moroni on top of the temple's tallest spire was lodged out of the statue, and some stones from the smaller spires were displaced. No other damage to the temple has been reported. Interior images Below are several photographs from the interior of the temple. In response to a member obtaining unauthorized images of the interior of the temple, church leaders decided to release the book The House of the Lord in 1912, which contained authorized black-and-white photographs of the interior, some of which are shown below. The unauthorized photographs had been taken over several months the year before by a man who was repeatedly allowed to enter with his camera while the temple was closed by a temple gardener friend.

The series is named after a group originally created by author Lawrence Miles for BBC Books' Doctor Who novels. Overview Originally a subplot in the Eighth Doctor Adventures, the War involves several characters and concepts evolved from the original Doctor Who set-up. In several cases, the Faction Paradox series still features these groups, albeit with names changed for reasons both literary (most of the groups or items mentioned are described from different perspectives) and legal (the Faction and the Enemy are Miles's creations, but other elements are not -- thus the Great Houses are the Faction Paradox range's equivalent to Doctor Who's Time Lords). Faction Paradox themselves are not the enemy in this War, and play a neutral part, willing to act against both sides in their own interests. Miles has described them as \\"a ritualistic time-travelling guerrilla organisation\\". The semi-mythical founder of Faction Paradox is Grandfather Paradox, named after the grandfather paradox of time travel theory. Originally a member of the Great Houses himself, the Grandfather created a new group after he became frustrated with the ways of the Great Houses. Faction Paradox therefore takes a good deal of pleasure in irritating the Great Houses, and many of their traditions and rituals are aligned in direct opposition to the way the Great Houses do things. Their time machines are bigger on the inside, in much the same way as TARDISes are, and the familial titles its members use (e.g. \\"Father\\", \\"Cousin\\") reference family units which the Great Houses lost when they became sterile. Faction Paradox also take a perverse pride in causing time paradoxes (something that is against the laws of the Great Houses) and achieving impossible or absurd effects for their own sake. For instance, they typically wear ritual skull masks which are in fact the skulls of vampirised members of the Great Houses who, in the Great Houses' version of history, never existed. Their stronghold on Earth exists in a version of London, within what they call \\"The Eleven-Day Empire\\", bought from the British government in 1752. In that year, the British Empire first adopted the Gregorian calendar, and in so doing had to correct their dating scheme by 11 days (2 September 1752 being followed by 14 September 1752). Faction Paradox claimed the missing 11 days as their base (building on the illogicity that only the numbering scheme changed and no days were actually \\"missing\\"). Stories Doctor Who (BBC Books) After a brief mention of Grandfather Paradox in the Virgin New Adventures novel Christmas on a Rational Planet, Faction Paradox and the War in Heaven made their debut in BBC Books' Eighth Doctor novels. The most relevant books to the Faction Paradox universe are *Alien Bodies (Lawrence Miles, 1997) *Unnatural History (Kate Orman and Jon Blum, 1999) *Interference: Book One (Shock Tactic) (Lawrence Miles, 1999) *Interference: Book Two (The Hour of the Geek) (Lawrence Miles, 1999) *The Blue Angel (Paul Magrs, 1999) *The Taking of Planet 5 (Simon Bucher Jones and Mark Clapham, 1999) *The Shadows of Avalon (Paul Cornell, 2000) *The Adventuress of Henrietta Street (Lawrence Miles, 2001) Several other Doctor Who novels featured or referenced Faction Paradox, most notably The Ancestor Cell (written by Stephen Cole and Peter Anghelides in 2000), The Quantum Archangel (written by Craig Hinton in 2001), and The Gallifrey Chronicles (written by Lance Parkin in 2005), but were contradicted or otherwise ignored in the Faction Paradox series. Faction Paradox (BBV) A series of full-cast audio dramas dubbed The Faction Paradox Protocols was produced by BBV between 2001 and 2004. All were written by Lawrence Miles. These stories centred on two Cousins of the Faction, Justine and Eliza. (Justine had previously featured in the BBC novel Alien Bodies, and Eliza appeared in Dead Romance as \\"Christine Summerfield\\".) The first two stories were set in the Eleven-Day Empire; the second two in 18th century London; and the last two were split between Justine's pre-Faction past and the Great Houses' prison facility. Although there were six releases and an ongoing story, each pair (usually released close together) formed a two-part story. In order they were: *The Eleven-Day Empire *The Shadow Play *Sabbath Dei *In the Year of the Cat *Movers *A Labyrinth of Histories Faction Paradox (Mad Norwegian Press) In 2002 Mad Norwegian Press published a multi-author faux- encyclopedia to the first 50 years of the War in Heaven, edited by Faction Paradox creator Lawrence Miles, as a companion to the BBV audios. After the success of The Book of the War, Mad Norwegian began publishing a Faction Paradox series of novels set in the same universe. These novels roam the ongoing War in Heaven; despite the series' name, the Faction and its members are not the focus, sometimes featuring only as minor characters, and sometimes not appearing at all. The books also featured characters from the Doctor Who novels, including Chris Cwej and Compassion. *The Book of the War (Lawrence Miles et al., 2002) *This Town Will Never Let Us Go (Lawrence Miles, 2003) *Of the City of the Saved... (Philip Purser-Hallard, 2004) *Warlords of Utopia (Lance Parkin, 2004) *Warring States (Mags L Halliday, 2005) *Erasing Sherlock (Kelly Hale, 2006) Mad Norwegian also republished the Virgin New Adventures novel Dead Romance as part of their Faction Paradox line in 2003. Faction Paradox (Image Comics) Cover of the first comics issue In 2003, the first two issues of a Faction Paradox comic were produced by Mad Norwegian and published by Image Comics. The series was subsequently cancelled. The comic was written by Lawrence Miles with art from Jim Calafiore and inks by Peter Palmiotti.Faction Paradox It was set after the events of the War in Heaven, though due to its short run it did not give much detail on the post-War universe.Comic Db Entry for Faction Paradox It tied into events described in The Faction Paradox Protocols, The Book of the War, and The Adventuress of Henrietta Street. Faction Paradox (Magic Bullet) In 2004 Magic Bullet Productions, known for their Kaldor City audio dramas, obtained the license to produce further Faction Paradox audios, dubbed The True History of Faction Paradox. The narrative of this series continued from The Faction Paradox Protocols, although the first CD was also written to be accessible to newcomers. Like the BBV audios, these stories focused on Cousin Justine and Cousin Eliza, but the characters were recast. The dramas in the series, released between 2005 and 2009, have featured guest stars including Julian Glover, Peter Miles, Philip Madoc and Gabriel Woolf. Woolf plays the ancient Egyptian god Sutekh, whom he had previously played in the 1975 Doctor Who story Pyramids of Mars.

Plot The novel follows the adventures of John Paul Ziller and his wife Amanda‚Äîlovable prophetess and promiscuous earth mother, inarguably the central protagonist‚Äîwho open \\"Captain Kendrick's Memorial Hot Dog Wildlife Preserve,\\" a combination hot dog stand and zoo along a highway in Skagit County, Washington. Other characters in this rather oddball novel include Mon Cul the baboon; Marx Marvelous, an educated man from the east coast; and L. Westminster \\"Plucky\\" Purcell, a former college football star and sometime dope dealer who accidentally infiltrates a group of Catholic monks working as assassins for the Vatican. In so doing Plucky discovers a secret of monumental proportions dating to the very beginning of Christianity. Major Themes In this novel, the author uses nonlinear plot progression in the tone of a first- person diary to express his views on religion and other topics. His humorous, scathing and insightful perceptions of those who swirl past the main characters has great comedic value. The book is a cultural icon for the \\"Children of the Sixties.\\" A major theme of the novel is the mummified corpse of Jesus Christ and Western Civilization's belief and faith in the divinity of Jesus Christ. In his memoir, Robbins states that he wanted to question what would happen to Western Civilization if it could be demonstrated that Jesus was not immortal.Robbins 248. Development history In 1966, Doubleday's West Coast Editor Luthor Nichols contacted Robbins to ask him to write a book on Northwest Art. Instead, Robbins told Nichols he wanted to write a novel and pitched the idea of what was to become Another Roadside Attraction.Robbins 230-32. In 1967 Robbins mailed off 30 pages of his novel to Nichols who sent them on to the New York office. The senior editors, holdovers from when Doubleday was a Roman Catholic publishing house, did not approve, but Nichols encouraged Robbins to keep writing. When he had 70 pages, Nichols tried them again on New York, but the senior editors were still unconvinced. It wasn't until 1970 that Doubleday finally accepted the manuscript and in 1971 published 6,000 copies of Another Roadside Attraction.Robbins 246‚Äì53 In his memoir, Robbins states that he did not want to describe the sixties in this novel but to re-create them on the page, \\"to mirror in style as well as content their mood, their palette, their extremes, their vibrations, their profundity, their silliness and whimsy.\\" Robbins 243‚Äì45. Robbins also said he used a collage technique‚Äîhe skimmed media such as the underground press, KRAB radio program guides, broadsides, fliers for concerts to try and pluck out items that might capture a portrait of the period.Robbins 247. In the book a baboon is stolen from the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. Shortly after publication someone did actually steal a baboon from the Zoo.Robbins 254.

Money Magic, pp. 175-221. Because coins are small, most coin tricks are considered close-up magic or table magic, as the audience must be close to the performer to see the effects. Though stage conjurers generally do not use coin effects, coin magic is sometimes performed onstage using large coins. In a different type of performance setting, a close-up coin magician (or 'coin worker') will use a large video projector so the audience can see the magic on a big screen. Coin magic is generally considered harder to master than other close-up techniques such as card magic, as it requires great skill and grace to perform convincingly, and this requires much practice to acquire. Elements Coin effects include productions, vanishes, transformations, transpositions, teleportations, penetrations, restorations, levitations and mental magic‚Äîsome are combined in a single routine. A simple effect might involve borrowing a coin, making it vanish, concealing the coin, then reproducing it again unexpectedly and returning it to the owner. More complex effects may involve multiple coins, substituting or switching coins and other objects or props can be employed (i.e. handkerchiefs, glasses) as well as the coins. However, the power of most coin magic lies in its simplicity and the solidity of the object; the basic skills of sleight of hand and misdirection often appear most magical without complex equipment. Almost any audience will be amazed by the simplest mystery, such as passing a coin through a table. Sleights and tricks Some classic coin magic effects: *Coin vanish - making a coin seemingly vanish. *Coin production - making a coin seemingly appear. *Transposition - making two coins switch places Some classic coin magic plots: *Chink-a-chink - A bare-handed Matrix. *Coins Across - The magical transfer of multiple coins from one hand to another. *Coin Bite - Taking a bite out of a coin then visually restoring it right in front of the spectator. *Coins Through Table - Coins penetrate through the surface of the table. *Coin to Bottle - A coin is slammed into a sealed bottle. *Coins to Glass - Similar to coins across - coins transfer from one hand to a glass. *Matrix - A teleportation illusion of four coins moving invisibly under the cover of four playing cards. *Miser's Dream - Grabbing multiple coins from thin air. Popularized by Thomas Nelson Downs, who would drop coin after coin into a borrowed top hat. *Spellbound - Visually changing one coin into another, while only showing one coin at all times. *Tenkai Pennies - A two coin routine where one coin travels from one hand to the other. *Three fly - A coins across type effect involving three coins visually transferring from one hand to another. A sampling of coin sleights and moves: *Palming - A form of concealment. *Sleeving - A form of concealment. *Lapping - A form of ditching a coin. *The French Drop - a retention of vision coin vanish involving the Passing of a coin from one hand to the other than making it disappear. *The Muscle Pass - Shooting a coin from one hand to the other, this can be done in such a way that can make the coin look as if it is defying gravity Coin magicians Some magicians widely known for coin magic include: * Thomas Nelson Downs (considered, along with J.B. Bobo, one of the magicians key to the development and teaching of modern coin magic) * J.B. Bobo (author of Modern Coin Magic, a core reference and starting point for coin magicians) * Tony Slydini (a well- known magician whose style of magic transformed close-up magic including his impressive coin routines) * Dai Vernon * Ed Marlo * David Roth (most important developer of coin magic in the twentieth century and inventor of the standard plots common in current coin magic) * Larry Jennings * Michael Ammar (one of the most prolific publishers and teachers, an experienced all around magician, including coin work) * Dean Dill (coin magician and inventor who has appeared on television and also works as a barber) * Michael Vincent * Shoot Ogawa (Last Vegas restaurant performer known for highly stylized, high-difficulty, impressive coin magic) * Apollo Robbins (contemporary of Shoot Ogawa and co- contributor to a number coin teaching materials) * David Stone (talented performer and teacher of fast-paced, flashy coin magic) * Rocco Silano * Jay Sankey * Rich Ferguson (author of Chip Tricks, a magician and mentalist who has authored various magic instructional videos) * Luis Piedrahita * Michael Rubinstein * Mike Gallo * Chris Kenner * Paul Cummins * Ryan Hayashi Performance Although some coin magic use gimmicks (e.g. modified coins or trick coins), such gimmicks usually do not entirely create the magical effect. Gimmicked coins are made by several major manufacturers, such as Sterling, Johnson, Sasco or Tango Magic. Producing a memorable mystery requires significant skill in presenting the effect and utilizing misdirection to distract the audience from the secret of the gimmick. A performer who relies entirely on special equipment may not impress an audience. Many people are more impressed by an effect which depends (or seems to depend) entirely on skillful manipulation and misdirection than by an effect which appears to depend to some extent on specially made props. A performer who has mastered the basic skills can nonetheless use gimmicks to powerful effect without it being obvious to the audience. Some prefer not to use gimmicks at all, though most well-known coin magicians do use simple coin gimmicks. In literature Canadian novelist Robertson Davies devotes a good part of his Deptford Trilogy to the art of coin magic. All three novels follow in part or wholly the career of a fictitious magician, Magnus Eisengrim, who was abducted as a boy by a traveling circus and learned his craft while concealed in a papier-m√¢ch√© automaton. The descriptions of coin magic throughout are remarkable for their clarity. The final novel in the series, World of Wonders, details his life and career. In the Neil Gaiman novel American Gods, the main character, Shadow, is experienced with coin magic, and many different tricks and aspects of coin magic are discussed in the book. In the Dean Koontz novel From the Corner of His Eye, a police officer uses coin magic to interrogate suspects. Thieves, wizards, and jesters, in historical and fantasy literature are often depicted as being skilled in sleight of hand, and are often depicted doing standard coin magic. Rolling a coin across the knuckles (coin walking) is a popular image. Silk in David Eddings's Belgariad, and Mat Cauthon and Thom Merrilin in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time do this frequently. Johnny Depp's whimsical character Jack Sparrow coin walks in the end of Pirates of the Caribbean. Also, Vila Restal in the BBC science fiction television program Blake's 7 mixed his skills as a thief with such tricks.

His first original novel, The Pendragon Protocol, the first volume of The Devices Trilogy, is an urban fantasy thriller which combines Arthurian myth with issues of modern British politics and identity. The British Fantasy Society said that the novel's \\"writing is crisp and clever, the plotting devoid of flab and the cast of characters appealing, interesting and consistent\\", and that it was based on \\"that rarest of fantasy beasts ‚Äì an original idea\\". Prior to 2014, his best known fiction was set in shared universes with origins in Doctor Who licensed fiction. From 2015 he is the editor of The Black Archive, a series of book-length critical studies of individual Doctor Who stories. The series is published by Obverse Books, and features contributions from Simon Bucher-Jones, Simon Guerrier, Kate Orman and others. Purser-Hallard has written or co-written three of the books. He has also written short stories and a novel featuring Sherlock Holmes, with a second novel expected in 2020. Purser-Hallard received his doctorate in English literature at Oxford University. His DPhil thesis, entitled 'The Relationship Between Creator and Creature in Science Fiction', examined how British and American science fiction of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries explored the relationship between humanity and a putative creating deity through stories about the creation of sentient individuals by scientists, working from Mary Shelley's Frankenstein through to recent authors like Bruce Sterling, William Gibson and Dan Simmons.\\"Afterword\\" and \\"About the Author\\" in Peculiar Lives pp132-34.Abstract on Purser-Hallard's website.

In recent years, the usage of the name has gradually changed to include several other church facilities that are immediately adjacent to Temple Square. Contained within Temple Square are the Salt Lake Temple, Salt Lake Tabernacle, Salt Lake Assembly Hall, the Seagull Monument, and two visitors' centers. The square was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1964, recognizing the Mormon achievement in the settlement of Utah.  History  Layout of Temple Square, circa 1893. Temple Square and the surrounding area in 2013. In 1847, when Mormon pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, president Brigham Young selected a plot of the desert ground and proclaimed, \\"Here we will build a temple to our God.\\"Quoted in Gordon B. Hinckley, \\"The Salt Lake Temple\\", Ensign, March 1993, p. 2. When the city was surveyed, the block enclosing that location was designated for the temple, and became known as Temple Square. Temple Square is surrounded by a 15-foot wall that was built shortly after the block was so designated. The square also became the headquarters of the LDS Church. Other buildings were built on the plot, including a tabernacle (prior to the one occupying Temple Square today) and Endowment House, both of which were later torn down. The Salt Lake Tabernacle, home of The Tabernacle Choir at Temple Square, was built in 1867 to accommodate the church's general conferences, with a seating capacity of 8,000. Another church building, the Salt Lake Assembly Hall, was later built with a seating capacity of 2,000. As the church has grown, its headquarters have expanded into the surrounding area. In 1917, an administration building was built on the block east of the temple and in 1972, the twenty-eight story LDS Church Office Building, which was, for many years, the tallest building in the state of Utah. The Hotel Utah, another building on this block, was remodeled in 1995 as additional office space and a large film theater and renamed the Joseph Smith Memorial Building. In 2000, the church purchased the section of Main Street between this block and Temple Square and connected the two blocks with a plaza called the Main Street Plaza. In 2000, the church completed a new, 21,000 seat Conference Center on the block north of Temple Square. In 2020, many of the buildings on and around Temple Square were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the 4-year renovation project.Harkins, Paighten. \\"LDS Church closes Temple Square, other downtown attractions, because of coronavirus\\", The Salt Lake Tribune, 14 March 2020. Retrieved on 18 March 2020.  Modern usage  Salt Lake Temple  Tourism  Attracting 3 million to 5 million visitors a year, Temple Square is the most popular tourist attraction in Utah, bringing in more visitors than the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone National Park. By comparison, Utah's five National Parks‚ÄîZion, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef, Canyonlands, and Arches‚Äîhad a combined total of 5.3 million visitors in 2005.  General Conference   Lighting  The grounds, as well as the Gardens at Temple Square, often host concerts and other events. During the Christmas holiday season, approximately 100,000 Christmas lights sparkle from trees and shrubs around Temple Square each evening until 10 pm. The lighting of Temple Square is a popular event, usually attended by more than 10,000 people.Michael De Groote, \\"Decades of downtown S.L. music and lights\\", Deseret News, December 12, 2010.  Other uses  The multiple gates to Temple Square are popular places for critics of the LDS Church‚Äîmainly former members and activist evangelical ministers‚Äîto picket and hand out tracts and literature critical of the church. They are also well-known locations for street musicians to perform, especially during the holiday season.  Street directions  Temple Square serves as the center point for all street addresses in Salt Lake City. The streets in Salt Lake follow a grid pattern which deviate out from the southeast corner of Temple Square.  Sites   Salt Lake Temple  The Salt Lake Temple is the largest and best-known of the LDS Church's operating temples. It is the sixth temple built by the church overall, and the fourth operating temple built following the Mormon exodus from Nauvoo, Illinois.  North and South Visitors' Centers  Christus statue in North Visitors' Center Today, Temple Square features two visitors' centers, called the North Visitors' Center and the South Visitors' Center. The North Visitors' Center was built first and features a replica of the Christus, a statue of Jesus Christ by Danish sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen. The Christus is located in a domed room with large windows, painted with clouds, stars, planets, and other heavenly bodies. The visitors' centers and grounds are staffed by full-time sister missionaries and senior missionary couples exclusively; no single male missionaries are called to serve on Temple Square. The sister missionaries serving on Temple Square are from around the world, speaking enough languages to cater to the majority of visitors. Beginning with the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, the sister missionaries have been wearing tags with the national flags of their home country along with their missionary name tags. On April 19, 2019, church leaders announced that the South Visitors' Center will be demolished as part of a massive renovation project that will begin December 29, 2019. Two smaller visitors' pavilions will take its place. Old Bureau of Information building, which served visitors from 1904 to 1978 (1909 photo). Assembly Hall at Temple Square at Christmas time.  Conference and assembly buildings  There are three large assembly buildings housed on Temple Square. The smallest of the three is the Salt Lake Assembly Hall, which seats approximately 2,000 and is located on the southwest corner of Temple Square. The Assembly Hall is a Victorian Gothic congregation hall, with a cruciform layout of the interior that is complemented by Stars of David circumscribed high above each entrance, which symbolize the gathering of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Construction of the hall began on August 11, 1877, and was completed in 1882.Assembly Hall. It is located just south of the Salt Lake Tabernacle and across from the South Visitor Center near the South Gate. Upon entering Temple Square from the south, the Assembly Hall can be seen to the left (west). The Assembly Hall hosts occasional free weekend music concerts and is filled as overflow for the church's twice-a-year general conferences. The second structure is the Salt Lake Tabernacle, home of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square. The Tabernacle was built between 1864 and 1867 with an overall seating capacity of 8,000, including the choir area and gallery. In March 2007, the Tabernacle was rededicated after extensive renovations and restorations were completed. Spacing between the pews was substantially increased, resulting in a reduced overall seating capacity. The Tabernacle was rededicated at the Saturday afternoon session of the church's 177th Annual General Conference. In addition to housing the choir, the Tabernacle is also used for other religious and cultural events. The largest and most recently built assembly building is the LDS Conference Center. With a capacity of over 21,000, it is used primarily for the LDS Church's general conferences as well as for concerts and other cultural events. The Conference Center was completed in 2000. Attached on the northwest corner of the Conference Center is the Conference Center Theater, an 850-seat theater for dramatic presentations, such as Savior of the World, as well as concerts and other events.Conference Center.  Museums and libraries  = Family History Library = Located on the block west of Temple Square, the Family History Library is the largest genealogical library in the world and is open to the general public at no charge.

Following his victory, he was celebrated as a national hero. A former soldier, Louis was encouraged to try out for the Olympics by his former commanding officer. After progressing through qualifying, he went on to win the inaugural Olympic marathon after placing first from seventeen competitors. Louis later became a police officer and a farmer. Outside of his athletics career, Louis was arrested for forgery, of which he was acquitted after spending a year in jail. Early life Spyridon Louis was born in the town of Marousi, north of Athens, into a poor family. Louis's father sold mineral water in Athens, which at the time lacked a central water supply, and Spyridon helped him by transporting it.  Preparation  After Pierre de Coubertin's decision in 1894 to revive the Olympic Games, preparations were made to organise the first modern Olympics in Athens. One of the races would be the marathon, an event which had never been held before. It had been suggested by Frenchman Michel Br√©al, who was inspired by the legend of the messenger Pheidippides, who had run from Marathon to Athens to announce the Athenian victory in the Battle of Marathon‚Äîand then dropped dead. The Greeks were very enthusiastic about this new event and decided to hold qualifiers for the marathon. These races were started by Colonel Papadiamantopoulos, who Louis previously served under in the military. The first qualifying race‚Äîthe first ever marathon race‚Äîwas held on 22 March, and was won by Charilaos Vasilakos in 3 hours, 18 minutes. Louis participated in the second qualifying race, two weeks later, and placed fifth. Papadiamantopoulos, who knew of Louis's talent in running, had convinced him to try out. The Olympic marathon was run on 10 April (or 29 March by the Julian calendar then in use in Greece). The Greek public had been very enthusiastic about the Games, but were disappointed in the fact that no track and field event had yet been won by a Greek competitor. The victory in the discus throw, a classical Greek event, by the American Robert Garrett had been particularly painful. Because of its close connection with Greek history, the public yearned for the marathon to be won by one of their countrymen.  The marathon race  In Marathon, Colonel Papadiamantopoulos gave the starting signal for the small field, consisting of seventeen athletes, thirteen of them representing Greece. The early leader of the race, which led over dusty dirt roads along which throngs of Greeks had gathered to watch, was the Frenchman Albin Lermusiaux, who had placed third in the 1500 metres prior to the marathon. In the town of Pikermi, Louis is said to have made a stop at a local inn to drink a glass of wine. (Louis's grandson, also Spyridon Louis, has stated that this is incorrect; that his grandfather's girlfriend gave him half an orange and shortly afterwards he \\"got a glass of cognac from his future father-in-law.\\") After asking for the advantage of the other runners, he confidently declared he would overtake them all before the end. After 26 km, Lermusiaux was exhausted and abandoned the race. The lead was taken over by Edwin Flack, an Australian who won the 800 and 1500 m races. Louis slowly closed in on Flack. The Australian, not used to running long distances, collapsed a few kilometers onwards, giving Louis the lead. During the race, there was tension among the Greek spectators when Flack was in first place. However, when news was delivered to the fans that Louis overtook the lead, the cry \\"Hellene, Hellene!\\" was taken up by rapturous spectators. Louis was greeted with cheers after entering the Panathenaic Stadium for the final part of the marathon. Louis ran with Crown Prince Constantine and Prince George of Greece during the last lap, finishing with a time of 2:58:50. Louis's victory set off wild celebrations, as described in the official report of the Games: > Here the Olympionic Victor was received with full honour; the King rose from > his seat and congratulated him most warmly on his success. Some of the > King‚Äôs aides-de-camp, and several members of the Committee went so far as to > kiss and embrace the victor, who finally was carried in triumph to the > retiring room under the vaulted entrance. The scene witnessed then inside > the Stadion cannot be easily described, even strangers were carried away by > the general enthusiasm. Adding to the celebrations, two more Greek runners entered the stadium to finish in second and third place. Third place finisher Spyridon Belokas was later found to have covered part of the course by carriage and was disqualified; third place was awarded to the Hungarian Gyula Kellner.  After the Olympics  After his victory, Louis received gifts from many countrymen, ranging from jewellery to a lifelong free shave at a barber shop. It is unknown whether Louis accepted all these gifts, although he did take back home the carriage he had asked of the king. After the Olympics, Louis ended his athletic career to become a farmer and a police officer.Spyridon Louis with Crown Prince (later king) Paul of Greece in Berlin, during the 1936 Summer Olympics In 1926, Louis was arrested on charges of falsifying military documents and was imprisoned. After spending more than a year in jail, he was acquitted. His last public appearance came in 1936, when he was invited to be a guest of honour by the organizers of the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin. After bearing the standard of the Greek team during the opening ceremonies, he was received by Adolf Hitler and offered him an olive branch from Olympia, the birthplace of the Olympic Games, as a symbol of peace. Louis recalled the moments after his victory: \\"That hour was something unimaginable and it still appears to me in my memory like a dream ‚Ä¶ Twigs and flowers were raining down on me. Everybody was calling out my name and throwing their hats in the air ...\\" Several months before the Italian invasion of Greece, Louis died. In Greece, various sports establishments are named after Louis. These include the Olympic Stadium of Athens where the 2004 Summer Olympics were held, as well as the road outside the stadium. The Jayne Mansfield movie It Happened in Athens is a heavily fictionalized take on Louis and the marathon, and his story is featured in the 1984 TV miniseries The First Olympics: Athens 1896. The expression in Greek: \\"yinomai Louis\\" (Œ≥ŒØŒΩŒøŒºŒ±Œπ ŒõŒøœçŒ∑œÇ), translated as \\"to becŒøme Louis,\\" is now employed to mean \\"tŒø disappear by running fast.\\"  Breal's Silver Cup  The silver cup given to Louis at the first modern Olympic Games staged in Athens in 1896, was sold for ¬£541,250 ($860,000) in London during a Christie's auction on 18 April 2012. The trophy, with a height of six inches, broke the auction record for Olympic memorabilia. The item was sold on the day Britain marked the 100 days' countdown to the 2012 London Olympics.

It is a localised variant of the Macaroni penguin. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the royal penguin as near threatened. The scientific name commemorates the German zoologist Hermann Schlegel.  Description  Royal penguin head It is one of the crested penguins (a different genus from the similarly named king or emperor penguins). There is some controversy over whether royal penguins are a subspecies of macaroni penguins. Individuals of the two groups have been known to interbreed, though this is a relatively rare occurrence. Indeed, other penguins have been known to form mixed-species pairs in the wild. They inhabit the waters surrounding Antarctica. Royals look very much like macaroni penguins, but have a white face and chin instead of the macaronis' black visage. They are long and weigh . (2011). (2011). Males are larger than females. Royal penguins breed only on Macquarie Island and, like other penguins, spend much of their time at sea, where they are assumed to be pelagic.  Breeding  Royal penguins nest on beaches or on bare areas on slopes covered with vegetation. Like most seabirds they are colonial, nesting in scrapes on the ground up to a mile inland. The breeding season begins in September with laying following in October. Though royals typically lay two eggs, only one usually survives. The egg is kept warm by both parents for around 35 days. This is done by rotating 12-day shifts. After hatching, the male cares for the chick for 2 to 3 weeks, when the female returns with food for both of them. If the female is delayed or fails to return to the colony, the chick will die. At about one month old, the chicks begin to group together for warmth and safety. Both parents continue to feed chicks two to three times a day. When the chicks are just over two months old, they will have grown their adult plumage and will leave the colony to go to sea to feed on their own.  Diet  Royal penguins fighting on Macquarie Island Royal penguins feed on krill, small fish, and small amounts of squid.  Threats  Royal penguins as a species are classified as near threatened by the IUCN, with high risk of endangerment in the wild. Historically they were hunted for their oil; between 1870 and 1919 the government of Tasmania issuing licences for hunting them, with an average of 150,000 penguins (both royal and king) being taken each year. At the peak of the industry in 1905, the plant established on Macquarie Island was processing 2000 penguins at a time, with each penguin yielding about half a litre of oil.Commonwealth Marine Reserves - Home Page .

These functioned as effective monopolies for a particular good or labor. The term \\"corporation\\" was used as late as the 18th century in England to refer to such ventures as the East India Company or the Hudson's Bay Company: commercial organizations that operated under royal patent to have exclusive rights to a particular area of trade. In the medieval town, however, corporations were a conglomeration of interests that existed either as a development from, or in competition with, guilds. The most notable corporations were in trade and banking. The effects of a corporation were similar to a monopoly. On the one hand, the ability to have sole access to markets meant that the business was encouraged (e.g., the ability to be an exclusive trader provided an incentive to the East India Company to accept financial risks in exploration) and the negative effects of competition were avoided (to take the same example, exclusive patents cut down on merchants sponsoring piracy). Innovation was stifled, however, and prices were unregulated. (In the case of patent corporations, the town or monarch was ostensibly able to regulate prices by revoking the patent, but this rarely occurred.)

It occurs when tobacco smoke enters an environment, causing its inhalation by people within that environment. Exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke causes disease, disability, and death. \\"There is sufficient evidence that involuntary smoking (exposure to secondhand or 'environmental' tobacco smoke) causes lung cancer in humans\\" The health risks of secondhand smoke are a matter of scientific consensus. These risks have been a major motivation for smoke-free laws in workplaces and indoor public places, including restaurants, bars and night clubs, as well as some open public spaces. Concerns around secondhand smoke have played a central role in the debate over the harms and regulation of tobacco products. Since the early 1970s, the tobacco industry has viewed public concern over secondhand smoke as a serious threat to its business interests. Harm to bystanders was perceived as a motivator for stricter regulation of tobacco products. Despite the industry's awareness of the harms of secondhand smoke as early as the 1980s, the tobacco industry coordinated a scientific controversy with the purpose of stopping regulation of their products.  Effects  Secondhand smoke causes many of the same diseases as direct smoking, including cardiovascular diseases, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases. These diseases include: * Cancer: ** General: overall increased risk; reviewing the evidence accumulated on a worldwide basis, the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded in 2004 that \\"Involuntary smoking (exposure to secondhand or 'environmental' tobacco smoke) is carcinogenic to humans.\\" ** Lung cancer: passive smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer. In the United States passive smoke is estimated to cause more than 7,000 deaths from lung cancer a year among non-smokers. ** Breast cancer: The California Environmental Protection Agency concluded in 2005 that passive smoking increases the risk of breast cancer in younger, primarily premenopausal females by 70% and the US Surgeon General has concluded that the evidence is \\"suggestive,\\" but still insufficient to assert such a causal relationship. In contrast, the International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded in 2004 that there was \\"no support for a causal relation between involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke and breast cancer in never-smokers.\\" A 2015 meta-analysis found that the evidence that passive smoking moderately increased the risk of breast cancer had become \\"more substantial than a few years ago.\\" ** Pancreatic cancer: A 2012 meta-analysis found no evidence that passive smoking was associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. ** Cervical cancer: A 2015 overview of systematic reviews found that exposure to secondhand smoke increased the risk of cervical cancer. ** Bladder cancer: A 2016 systematic review and meta- analysis found that secondhand smoke exposure was associated with a significant increase in the risk of bladder cancer. * Circulatory system: risk of heart disease, reduced heart rate variability. ** Epidemiological studies have shown that both active and passive cigarette smoking increase the risk of atherosclerosis. ** Passive smoking is strongly associated with an increased risk of stroke, and this increased risk is disproportionately high at low levels of exposure. * Lung problems: ** Risk of asthma. ** Risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ** According to a 2015 review, passive smoking may increase the risk of tuberculosis infection and accelerate the progression of the disease, but the evidence remains weak. ** The majority of studies on the association between secondhand smoke exposure and sinusitis have found a significant association between the two. * Cognitive impairment and dementia: Exposure to secondhand smoke may increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia in adults 50 and over. Children exposed to secondhand smoke show reduced vocabulary and reasoning skills when compared with non- exposed children as well as more general cognitive and intellectual deficits. * Mental health: Exposure to secondhand smoke is associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms. * During pregnancy: ** Low birth weight, part B, ch. 3. ** Premature birth, part B, ch. 3 (Note that evidence of the causal link is described only as \\"suggestive\\" by the US Surgeon General in his 2006 report.) Laws limiting smoking decrease premature births. ** Stillbirth and congenital malformations in children ** Recent studies comparing females exposed to Environmental Tobacco Smoke and non-exposed females, demonstrate that females exposed while pregnant have higher risks of delivering a child with congenital abnormalities, longer lengths, smaller head circumferences, and low birth weight. * General: ** Worsening of asthma, allergies, and other conditions. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis found that passive smoking was associated with a slightly increased risk of allergic diseases among children and adolescents; the evidence for an association was weaker for adults. ** Type 2 diabetes. It remains unclear whether the association between passive smoking and diabetes is causal. *Risk of carrying Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae. *A possible increased risk of periodontitis. * Overall increased risk of death in both adults, where it is estimated to kill 53,000 nonsmokers per year, making it the 3rd leading cause of preventable death in the U.S, and in children. The World Health Organization states that passive smoking causes about 600,000 deaths a year, and about 1% of the global burden of disease. As of 2017, passive smoking causes about 900,000 deaths a year, which is about 1/8 of all deaths caused by smoking. * Skin conditions: A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found that passive smoking was associated with a higher rate of atopic dermatitis. Risk to children * Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In his 2006 report, the US Surgeon General concludes: \\"The evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between exposure to secondhand smoke and sudden infant death syndrome.\\" Secondhand smoking has been estimated to be associated with 430 SIDS deaths in the United States annually.\\"Secondhand Smoke and Children Fact Sheet\\", American Lung Association August 2006. * Asthma. Secondhand smoke exposure is also associated with an almost doubled risk of hospitalization for asthma exacerbation among children with asthma. * Lung infections, also including more severe illness with bronchiolitis and bronchitis,Preventing Smoking and Exposure to Secondhand Smoke Before, During, and After Pregnancy .

In the United States, it is estimated that secondhand smoke has been associated with between 150,000 and 300,000 lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children under 18 months of age, resulting in between 7,500 and 15,000 hospitalizations each year. * Impaired respiratory function and slowed lung growth * Allergies * Maternal passive smoking increases the risk of non- syndromic orofacial clefts by 50% among their children. * Prenatal and childhood passive smoke exposure does not appear to increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease. * Learning difficulties, developmental delays, executive function problems, and neurobehavioral effects. Animal models suggest a role for nicotine and carbon monoxide in neurocognitive problems. * An increase in tooth decay (as well as related salivary biomarkers) has been associated with passive smoking in children. * Increased risk of middle ear infections. * Invasive meningococcal disease. * Maternal exposure to secondhand smoke exposure during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects. * Miscarriage: a 2014 meta-analysis found that maternal secondhand smoke exposure increased the risk of miscarriage by 11%. * Anesthesia complications and some negative surgical outcomes. * Sleep disordered breathing: Most studies have found a significant association between passive smoking and sleep disordered breathing in children, but further studies are needed to determine whether this association is causal. * Adverse effects on the cardiovascular system of children.  Evidence  Exposure to secondhand smoke by age, race, and poverty level in the US in 2010 Epidemiological studies show that non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke are at risk for many of the health problems associated with direct smoking. In 1992, a review estimated that secondhand smoke exposure was responsible for 35,000 to 40,000 deaths per year in the United States in the early 1980s. The absolute risk increase of heart disease due to ETS was 2.2%, while the attributable risk percent was 23%. A 1997 meta-analysis found that secondhand smoke exposure increased the risk of heart disease by a quarter, and two 1999 meta-analyses reached similar conclusions. Evidence shows that inhaled sidestream smoke, the main component of secondhand smoke, is about four times more toxic than mainstream smoke. This fact has been known to the tobacco industry since the 1980s, though it kept its findings secret. Some scientists believe that the risk of passive smoking, in particular the risk of developing coronary heart diseases, may have been substantially underestimated. In 1997, a meta-analysis on the relationship between secondhand smoke exposure and lung cancer concluded that such exposure caused lung cancer. The increase in risk was estimated to be 24% among non-smokers who lived with a smoker. In 2000, Copas and Shi reported that there was clear evidence of publication bias in the studies included in this meta-analysis. They further concluded that after correcting for publication bias, and assuming that 40% of all studies are unpublished, this increased risk decreased from 24% to 15%. This conclusion has been challenged on the basis that the assumption that 40% of all studies are unpublished was \\"extreme\\". In 2006, Takagi et al. reanalyzed the data from this meta-analysis to account for publication bias and estimated that the relative risk of lung cancer among those exposed to secondhand smoke was 1.19, slightly lower than the original estimate. A 2000 meta-analysis found a relative risk of 1.48 for lung cancer among men exposed to secondhand smoke, and a relative risk of 1.16 among those exposed to it at work. Another meta- analysis confirmed the finding of an increased risk of lung cancer among women with spousal exposure to secondhand smoke the following year. It found a relative risk of lung cancer of 1.29 for women exposed to secondhand smoke from their spouses. A 2014 meta-analysis noted that \\"the association between exposure to secondhand smoke and lung cancer risk is well established.\\" A minority of epidemiologists have found it hard to understand how secondhand smoke, which is more diluted than actively inhaled smoke, could have an effect that is such a large fraction of the added risk of coronary heart disease among active smokers. One proposed explanation is that secondhand smoke is not simply a diluted version of \\"mainstream\\" smoke, but has a different composition with more toxic substances per gram of total particulate matter. Passive smoking appears to be capable of precipitating the acute manifestations of cardio-vascular diseases (atherothrombosis) and may also have a negative impact on the outcome of patients who suffer acute coronary syndromes. In 2004, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) reviewed all significant published evidence related to tobacco smoking and cancer. It concluded: Subsequent meta- analyses have confirmed these findings. The National Asthma Council of Australia cites studies showing that secondhand smoke is probably the most important indoor pollutant, especially around young children: * Smoking by either parent, particularly by the mother, increases the risk of asthma in children. * The outlook for early childhood asthma is less favourable in smoking households. * Children with asthma who are exposed to smoking in the home generally have more severe disease. * Many adults with asthma identify ETS as a trigger for their symptoms. * Doctor-diagnosed asthma is more common among non-smoking adults exposed to ETS than those not exposed. Among people with asthma, higher ETS exposure is associated with a greater risk of severe attacks. In France, exposure to secondhand smoke has been estimated to cause between 3,000 and 5,000 premature deaths per year, with the larger figure cited by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin during his announcement of a nationwide smoke-free law: \\"That makes more than 13 deaths a day. It is an unacceptable reality in our country in terms of public health.\\" There is good observational evidence that smoke-free legislation reduces the number of hospital admissions for heart disease.  Exposure and risk levels  The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization concluded in 2004 that there was sufficient evidence that secondhand smoke caused cancer in humans. Those who work in environments where smoke is not regulated are at higher risk. Workers particularly at risk of exposure include those in installation repair and maintenance, construction and extraction, and transportation. Much research has come from studies of nonsmokers who are married to a smoker. The US Surgeon General, in his 2006 report, estimated that living or working in a place where smoking is permitted increases the non-smokers' risk of developing heart disease by 25‚Äì30% and lung cancer by 20‚Äì30%.. Some contrary research is reviewed in Unlucky Strike: Private Health and the science, law and politics of smoking Staddon, John (2013/2014 US) Unlucky Strike: Private Health and the Science, Law and Politics of Smoking. Buckingham, UK: University of Buckingham Press.. Similarly, children who are exposed to environmental tobacco smoke are shown to experience a range of adverse effects and a higher risk of becoming smokers later in life. The WHO has identified reduction of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke as key element for actions to encourage healthy child development. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors the extent of and trends in exposure to environmental tobacco smoke by measuring serum cotinine in national health surveys. The prevalence of secondhand smoke exposure among U.S. nonsmokers declined from 87.5% in 1988 to 25.2% in 2014. However, nearly half of blacks and the poor were exposed in 2014.  Interventions to reduce environmental tobacco smoke  A systematic review compared smoking control programmes and their effects on smoke exposure in children. The review distinguishes between community-based, ill-child and healthy-child settings and the most common types of interventions were counselling or brief advice during clinical visits. The review did not find superior outcomes for any intervention, and the authors caution that evidence from adult settings may not generalise well to children. Biomarkers Breath CO monitor displaying carbon monoxide concentration of an exhaled breath sample (in ppm) with corresponding percent concentration of carboxyhemoglobin displayed below. Environmental tobacco smoke can be evaluated either by directly measuring tobacco smoke pollutants found in the air or by using biomarkers, an indirect measure of exposure. Carbon monoxide monitored through breath, nicotine, cotinine, thiocyanates, and proteins are the most specific biological markers of tobacco smoke exposure. Biochemical tests are a much more reliable biomarker of secondhand smoke exposure than surveys. Certain groups of people are reluctant to disclose their smoking status and exposure to tobacco smoke, especially pregnant women and parents of young children. This is due to their smoking being socially unacceptable. Also, it may be difficult for individuals to recall their exposure to tobacco smoke. A 2007 study in the Addictive Behaviors journal found a positive correlation between secondhand tobacco smoke exposure and concentrations of nicotine and/or biomarkers of nicotine in the body. Significant biological levels of nicotine from secondhand smoke exposure were equivalent to nicotine levels from active smoking and levels that are associated with behaviour changes due to nicotine consumption. =Cotinine= Cotinine, the metabolite of nicotine, is a biomarker of secondhand smoke exposure. Typically, cotinine is measured in the blood, saliva, and urine. Hair analysis has recently become a new, noninvasive measurement technique. Cotinine accumulates in hair during hair growth, which results in a measure of long-term, cumulative exposure to tobacco smoke. Urinary cotinine levels have been a reliable biomarker of tobacco exposure and have been used as a reference in many epidemiological studies. However, cotinine levels found in the urine reflect exposure only over the preceding 48 hours. Cotinine levels of the skin, such as the hair and nails, reflect tobacco exposure over the previous three months and are a more reliable biomarker. =Carbon monoxide (CO)= Carbon monoxide monitored via breath is also a reliable biomarker of secondhand smoke exposure as well as tobacco use. With high sensitivity and specificity, it not only provides an accurate measure, but the test is also non-invasive, highly reproducible, and low in cost. Breath CO monitoring measures the concentration of CO in an exhalation in parts per million, and this can be directly correlated to the blood CO concentration (carboxyhemoglobin). Breath CO monitors can also be used by emergency services to identify patients who are suspected of having CO poisoning.  Pathophysiology  A 2004 study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization concluded that non-smokers are exposed to the same carcinogens as active smokers. Sidestream smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals, including 69 known carcinogens. Of special concern are polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines, and aromatic amines, such as 4-aminobiphenyl, all known to be highly carcinogenic. Mainstream smoke, sidestream smoke, and secondhand smoke contain largely the same components, however the concentration varies depending on type of smoke. Several well-established carcinogens have been shown by the tobacco companies' own research to be present at higher concentrations in sidestream smoke than in mainstream smoke. Secondhand smoke has been shown to produce more particulate-matter (PM) pollution than an idling low-emission diesel engine. In an experiment conducted by the Italian National Cancer Institute, three cigarettes were left smoldering, one after the other, in a 60 m¬≥ garage with a limited air exchange. The cigarettes produced PM pollution exceeding outdoor limits, as well as PM concentrations up to 10-fold that of the idling engine. Secondhand tobacco smoke exposure has immediate and substantial effects on blood and blood vessels in a way that increases the risk of a heart attack, particularly in people already at risk. Exposure to tobacco smoke for 30 minutes significantly reduces coronary flow velocity reserve in healthy nonsmokers. Secondhand smoke is also associated with impaired vasodilation among adult nonsmokers. Secondhand smoke exposure also affects platelet function, vascular endothelium, and myocardial exercise tolerance at levels commonly found in the workplace. Pulmonary emphysema can be induced in rats through acute exposure to sidestream tobacco smoke (30 cigarettes per day) over a period of 45 days. Degranulation of mast cells contributing to lung damage has also been observed. The term \\"third-hand smoke\\" was recently coined to identify the residual tobacco smoke contamination that remains after the cigarette is extinguished and secondhand smoke has cleared from the air. Preliminary research suggests that by-products of third-hand smoke may pose a health risk, though the magnitude of risk, if any, remains unknown. In October 2011, it was reported that Christus St. Frances Cabrini Hospital in Alexandria, Louisiana would seek to eliminate third-hand smoke beginning in July 2012, and that employees whose clothing smelled of smoke would not be allowed to work. This prohibition was enacted because third-hand smoke poses a special danger for the developing brains of infants and small children.Louisiana Hospital to Ban Odor of Smoke on Workers' Clothes, Fox News, October 3, 2011 In 2008, there were more than 161,000 deaths attributed to lung cancer in the United States. Of these deaths, an estimated 10% to 15% were caused by factors other than first-hand smoking; equivalent to 16,000 to 24,000 deaths annually. Slightly more than half of the lung cancer deaths caused by factors other than first-hand smoking were found in nonsmokers. Lung cancer in non-smokers may well be considered one of the most common cancer mortalities in the United States. Clinical epidemiology of lung cancer has linked the primary factors closely tied to lung cancer in non- smokers as exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke, carcinogens including radon, and other indoor air pollutants.  Opinion of public health authorities  There is widespread scientific consensus that exposure to secondhand smoke is harmful. The link between passive smoking and health risks is accepted by every major medical and scientific organisation, including: * World Health Organization * U.S. National Institutes of Health * Centers for Disease Control * United States Surgeon General * U.S. National Cancer Institute * United States Environmental Protection Agency * California Environmental Protection Agency * American Heart Association, American Lung Association, and American Cancer Society * American Medical Association * American Academy of Pediatrics * Australian National Health and Medical Research Council * United Kingdom Scientific Committee on Tobacco and HealthTwo relevant reports have been published by the Scientific Committee: * A 1998 report of the SCOTH concluded that passive smoking was a cause of lung cancer, heart disease, and other health problems. * A 2004 update by the SCOTH , reviewing new evidence published since the 1998 report, found that recent research had confirmed the initially reported link between passive smoking and health risks.  Public opinion  Recent major surveys conducted by the U.S. National Cancer Institute and Centers for Disease Control have found widespread public awareness that secondhand smoke is harmful. In both 1992 and 2000 surveys, more than 80% of respondents agreed with the statement that secondhand smoke was harmful. A 2001 study found that 95% of adults agreed that secondhand smoke was harmful to children, and 96% considered tobacco-industry claims that secondhand smoke was not harmful to be untruthful. A 2007 Gallup poll found that 56% of respondents felt that secondhand smoke was \\"very harmful\\", a number that has held relatively steady since 1997. Another 29% believe that secondhand smoke is \\"somewhat harmful\\"; 10% answered \\"not too harmful\\", while 5% said \\"not at all harmful\\".  Controversy over harm  As part of its attempt to prevent or delay tighter regulation of smoking, the tobacco industry funded a number of scientific studies and, where the results cast doubt on the risks associated with secondhand smoke, sought wide publicity for those results. The industry also funded libertarian and conservative think tanks, such as the Cato Institute in the United States and the Institute of Public Affairs in Australia which criticised both scientific research on passive smoking and policy proposals to restrict smoking.\\"Cato and the tobacco industry\\". Accessed 8 April 2011.Nahan, Mike. The Australian, 10 April 2000, \\"The IPA sings its own song\\". New Scientist and the European Journal of Public Health have identified these industry-wide coordinated activities as one of the earliest expressions of corporate denialism. Further, they state that the disinformation spread by the tobacco industry has created a tobacco denialism movement, sharing many characteristics of other forms of denialism, such as HIV-AIDS denialism. Industry-funded studies and critiques =Enstrom and Kabat= A 2003 study by James Enstrom and Geoffrey Kabat, published in the British Medical Journal, argued that the harms of passive smoking had been overstated. Their analysis reported no statistically significant relationship between passive smoking and lung cancer, coronary heart disease (CHD), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, though the accompanying editorial noted that \\"they may overemphasise the negative nature of their findings.\\" This paper was widely promoted by the tobacco industry as evidence that the harms of passive smoking were unproven. The American Cancer Society (ACS), whose database Enstrom and Kabat used to compile their data, criticized the paper as \\"neither reliable nor independent\\", stating that scientists at the ACS had repeatedly pointed out serious flaws in Enstrom and Kabat's methodology prior to publication. Notably, the study had failed to identify a comparison group of \\"unexposed\\" persons. Enstrom's ties to the tobacco industry also drew scrutiny; in a 1997 letter to Philip Morris, Enstrom requested a \\"substantial research commitment... in order for me to effectively compete against the large mountain of epidemiologic data and opinions that already exist regarding the health effects of ETS and active smoking.\\" In a US racketeering lawsuit against tobacco companies, the Enstrom and Kabat paper was cited by the US District Court as \\"a prime example of how nine tobacco companies engaged in criminal racketeering and fraud to hide the dangers of tobacco smoke.\\" The Court found that the study had been funded and managed by the Center for Indoor Air Research, a tobacco industry front group tasked with \\"offsetting\\" damaging studies on passive smoking, as well as by Philip Morris who stated that Enstrom's work was \\"clearly litigation-oriented.\\" A 2005 paper in Tobacco Control argued that the disclosure section in the Enstrom and Kabat BMJ paper, although it met the journal's requirements, \\"does not reveal the full extent of the relationship the authors had with the tobacco industry.\\" In 2006, Enstrom and Kabat published a meta-analysis of studies regarding passive smoking and coronary heart disease in which they reported a very weak association between passive smoking and heart disease mortality. They concluded that exposure to secondhand smoke increased the risk of death from CHD by only 5%, although this analysis has been criticized for including two previous industry-funded studies that suffered from widespread exposure misclassification. =Gori= Gio Batta Gori, a tobacco industry spokesman and consultantUnited States of America v.

Milloy, who has a master's degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, argued that studies yielding relative risks of less than 2 were meaningless junk science. This approach to epidemiological analysis was criticized in the American Journal of Public Health: The tobacco industry and affiliated scientists also put forward a set of \\"Good Epidemiology Practices\\" which would have the practical effect of obscuring the link between secondhand smoke and lung cancer; the privately stated goal of these standards was to \\"impede adverse legislation\\".Scientific Communications Through the Media, from the Philip Morris document archive.

Also cited in However, this effort was largely abandoned when it became clear that no independent epidemiological organization would agree to the standards proposed by Philip Morris et al. = Levois and Layard = In 1995, Levois and Layard, both tobacco industry consultants, published two analyses in the journal Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology regarding the association between spousal exposure to secondhand smoke and heart disease. Both of these papers reported no association between secondhand smoke and heart disease. These analyses have been criticized for failing to distinguish between current and former smokers, despite the fact that former smokers, unlike current ones, are not at a significantly increased risk of heart disease. = World Health Organization controversy = A 1998 study by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) on environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) found \\"weak evidence of a dose‚Äìresponse relationship between risk of lung cancer and exposure to spousal and workplace ETS.\\" In March 1998, before the study was published, reports appeared in the media alleging that the IARC and the World Health Organization (WHO) were suppressing information.

Australian 1998, March 10.WHO Rejects smoking link with lung cancer. Zimbabwe Independent 1998, Oct 23.No Link Between Passive Smoking and Lung Cancer. The Times 1998, March 9. alleged that the WHO withheld from publication of its own report that supposedly failed to prove an association between passive smoking and a number of other diseases (lung cancer in particular). In response, the WHO issued a press release stating that the results of the study had been \\"completely misrepresented\\" in the popular press and were in fact very much in line with similar studies demonstrating the harms of passive smoking. The study was published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute in October of the same year, and concluded the authors found \\"no association between childhood exposure to ETS and lung cancer risk\\" but \\"did find weak evidence of a dose‚Äìresponse relationship between risk of lung cancer and exposure to spousal and workplace ETS.\\" An accompanying editorial summarized: With the release of formerly classified tobacco industry documents through the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, it was found (by Elisa Ong and Stanton Glantz) that the controversy over the WHO's alleged suppression of data had been engineered by Philip Morris, British American Tobacco, and other tobacco companies in an effort to discredit scientific findings which would harm their business interests. A WHO inquiry, conducted after the release of the tobacco-industry documents, found that this controversy was generated by the tobacco industry as part of its larger campaign to cut the WHO's budget, distort the results of scientific studies on passive smoking, and discredit the WHO as an institution. This campaign was carried out using a network of ostensibly independent front organizations and international and scientific experts with hidden financial ties to the industry. = EPA lawsuit = In 1993, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a report estimating that 3,000 lung cancer related deaths in the United States were caused by passive smoking annually.US Environmental Protection Agency.

The United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina ruled in favor of the tobacco industry in 1998, finding that the EPA had failed to follow proper scientific and epidemiologic practices and had \\"cherry picked\\" evidence to support conclusions which they had committed to in advance. The court stated in part, \\"EPA publicly committed to a conclusion before research had begun‚Ä¶adjusted established procedure and scientific norms to validate the Agency's public conclusion... In conducting the ETS Risk Assessment, disregarded information and made findings on selective information; did not disseminate significant epidemiologic information; deviated from its Risk Assessment Guidelines; failed to disclose important findings and reasoning‚Ä¶\\" In 2002, the EPA successfully appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The EPA's appeal was upheld on the preliminary grounds that their report had no regulatory weight, and the earlier finding was vacated. In 1998, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, through the publication by its National Toxicology Program of the 9th Report on Carcinogens, listed environmental tobacco smoke among the known carcinogens, observing of the EPA assessment that \\"The individual studies were carefully summarized and evaluated.\\" = Tobacco-industry funding of research = The tobacco industry's role in funding scientific research on secondhand smoke has been controversial. A review of published studies found that tobacco-industry affiliation was strongly correlated with findings exonerating secondhand smoke; researchers affiliated with the tobacco industry were 88 times more likely than independent researchers to conclude that secondhand smoke was not harmful. In a specific example which came to light with the release of tobacco-industry documents, Philip Morris executives successfully encouraged an author to revise his industry-funded review article to downplay the role of secondhand smoke in sudden infant death syndrome. The 2006 U.S. Surgeon General's report criticized the tobacco industry's role in the scientific debate: This strategy was outlined at an international meeting of tobacco companies in 1988, at which Philip Morris proposed to set up a team of scientists, organized by company lawyers, to \\"carry out work on ETS to keep the controversy alive.\\" All scientific research was subject to oversight and \\"filtering\\" by tobacco-industry lawyers: Philip Morris reported that it was putting \\"...vast amounts of funding into these projects... in attempting to coordinate and pay so many scientists on an international basis to keep the ETS controversy alive.\\" Tobacco industry response Measures to tackle secondhand smoke pose a serious economic threat to the tobacco industry, having broadened the definition of smoking beyond a personal habit to something with a social impact. In a confidential 1978 report, the tobacco industry described increasing public concerns about secondhand smoke as \\"the most dangerous development to the viability of the tobacco industry that has yet occurred.\\"A Study of Public Attitudes toward Cigarette Smoking and the Tobacco Industry in 1978, produced for the Tobacco Institute and released under the terms of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement. In United States of America v. Philip Morris et al., the District Court for the District of Columbia found that the tobacco industry \\"... recognized from the mid-1970s forward that the health effects of passive smoking posed a profound threat to industry viability and cigarette profits,\\" and that the industry responded with \\"efforts to undermine and discredit the scientific consensus that ETS causes disease.\\" Accordingly, the tobacco industry have developed several strategies to minimise the impact on their business: * The industry has sought to position the secondhand smoke debate as essentially concerned with civil liberties and smokers' rights rather than with health, by funding groups such as FOREST. * Funding bias in research; in all reviews of the effects of secondhand smoke on health published between 1980 and 1995, the only factor associated with concluding that secondhand smoke is not harmful was whether an author was affiliated with the tobacco industry. However, not all studies that failed to find evidence of harm were by industry-affiliated authors. * Delaying and discrediting legitimate research (see for an example of how the industry attempted to discredit Takeshi Hirayama's landmark study, and for an example of how it attempted to delay and discredit a major Australian report on passive smoking) * Promoting \\"good epidemiology\\" and attacking so-called junk science (a term popularised by industry lobbyist Steven Milloy): attacking the methodology behind research showing health risks as flawed and attempting to promote sound science. Ong & Glantz (2001) cite an internal Phillip Morris memo giving evidence of this as company policy. * Creation of outlets for favourable research. In 1989, the tobacco industry established the International Society of the Built Environment, which published the peer- reviewed journal Indoor and Built Environment. This journal did not require conflict-of-interest disclosures from its authors. With documents made available through the Master Settlement, it was found that the executive board of the society and the editorial board of the journal were dominated by paid tobacco-industry consultants. The journal published a large amount of material on passive smoking, much of which was \\"industry-positive\\". Citing the tobacco industry's production of biased research and efforts to undermine scientific findings, the 2006 U.S. Surgeon General's report concluded that the industry had \\"attempted to sustain controversy even as the scientific community reached consensus... industry documents indicate that the tobacco industry has engaged in widespread activities... that have gone beyond the bounds of accepted scientific practice.\\" The U.S. District Court, in U.S.A. v. Philip Morris et al., found that \\"...despite their internal acknowledgment of the hazards of secondhand smoke, Defendants have fraudulently denied that ETS causes disease.\\" = Position of major tobacco companies = The positions of major tobacco companies on the issue of secondhand smoke is somewhat varied. In general, tobacco companies have continued to focus on questioning the methodology of studies showing that secondhand smoke is harmful. Some (such as British American Tobacco and Philip Morris) acknowledge the medical consensus that secondhand smoke carries health risks, while others continue to assert that the evidence is inconclusive. Several tobacco companies advocate the creation of smoke-free areas within public buildings as an alternative to comprehensive smoke-free laws.The most current positions of major tobacco companies on the issue of passive smoking can be found on their websites. As of 13 January 2009, the following websites contain tobacco-industry positions on the topic: * British American Tobacco: * Imperial Tobacco: * Philip Morris: USA and International * R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company:  US racketeering lawsuit against tobacco companies  On September 22, 1999, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a racketeering lawsuit against Philip Morris and other major cigarette manufacturers.Litigation Against Tobacco Companies U.S. Department of Justice Almost 7 years later, on August 17, 2006 U.S. District Court Judge Gladys Kessler found that the Government had proven its case and that the tobacco company defendants had violated the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). In particular, Judge Kessler found that PM and other tobacco companies had: * conspired to minimize, distort and confuse the public about the health hazards of smoking; * publicly denied, while internally acknowledging, that secondhand tobacco smoke is harmful to nonsmokers, and * destroyed documents relevant to litigation. The ruling found that tobacco companies undertook joint efforts to undermine and discredit the scientific consensus that secondhand smoke causes disease, notably by controlling research findings via paid consultants. The ruling also concluded that tobacco companies were fraudulently continuing to deny the health effects of ETS exposure. On May 22, 2009, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the lower court's 2006 ruling.Appeal Ruling, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, 22 May 2009Altria, Cigarette Makers Lose 'Lights' Ruling Appeal Bloomberg news, 22 May 2009U.S. appeals court agrees tobacco companies lied Reuters, 22 May 2009  Smoke-free laws  As a consequence of the health risks associated with secondhand smoke, smoke-free regulations in indoor public places, including restaurants, caf√©s, and nightclubs have been introduced in a number of jurisdictions, at national or local level, as well as some outdoor open areas.Smokers Daring Bloomberg To Ticket Them Under Park Ban Ireland was the first country in the world to institute a comprehensive national smoke-free law on smoking in all indoor workplaces on 29 March 2004. Since then, many others have followed suit. The countries which have ratified the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) have a legal obligation to implement effective legislation \\"for protection from exposure to tobacco smoke in indoor workplaces, public transport, indoor public places and, as appropriate, other public places.\\" (Article 8 of the FCTC) The parties to the FCTC have further adopted Guidelines on the Protection from Exposure to secondhand Smoke which state that \\"effective measures to provide protection from exposure to tobacco smoke ... require the total elimination of smoking and tobacco smoke in a particular space or environment in order to create a 100% smoke-free environment.\\" Opinion polls have shown considerable support for smoke-free laws. In June 2007, a survey of 15 countries found 80% approval for smoke-free laws.Market Research World A survey in France, reputedly a nation of smokers, showed 70% support.  Effects  Smoking bans by governments result in decreased harm from second hand smoke, including less admissions for acute coronary syndrome. In the first 18 months after the town of Pueblo, Colorado enacted a smoke-free law in 2003, hospital admissions for heart attacks dropped 27%. Admissions in neighbouring towns without smoke-free laws showed no change, and the decline in heart attacks in Pueblo was attributed to the resulting reduction in secondhand smoke exposure. A 2004 smoking ban instituted in Massachusetts workplaces decreased workers' secondhand smoke exposure from 8% of workers in 2003 to 5.4% of workers in 2010. A 2016 review also found that bans and policy changes in specific locations such as hospitals or universities can lead to reduced smoking rates. In prison settings bans might lead to reduced mortality and to lower exposure to passive smoking. In 2001, a systematic review for the Guide to Community Preventive Services acknowledged strong evidence of the effectiveness of smoke-free policies and restrictions in reducing expose to secondhand smoke. A follow up to this review, identified the evidence on which the effectiveness of smoking bans reduced the prevalence of tobacco use. Articles published until 2005, were examined to further support this evidence. The examined studies provided sufficient evidence that smoke-free policies reduce tobacco use among workers when implemented in worksites or by communities. While a number of studies funded by the tobacco industry have claimed a negative economic impact from smoke-free laws, no independently funded research has shown any such impact. A 2003 review reported that independently funded, methodologically sound research consistently found either no economic impact or a positive impact from smoke-free laws. Air nicotine levels were measured in Guatemalan bars and restaurants before and after an implemented smoke-free law in 2009. Nicotine concentrations significantly decreased in both the bars and restaurants measured. Also, the employees support for a smoke-free workplace substantially increased in the post-implementation survey compared to pre-implementation survey. The result of this smoke-free law provides a considerably more healthy work environment for the staff.  Public opinion  Recent surveys taken by the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco demonstrates supportive attitudes of the public, towards smoke-free policies in outdoor areas. A vast majority of the public supports restricting smoking in various outdoor settings. The respondents reasons for supporting the policies were for varying reasons such as, litter control, establishing positive smoke-free role models for youth, reducing youth opportunities to smoke, and avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke.  Alternative forms  Alternatives to smoke-free laws have also been proposed as a means of harm reduction, particularly in bars and restaurants. For example, critics of smoke-free laws cite studies suggesting ventilation as a means of reducing tobacco smoke pollutants and improving air quality. Ventilation has also been heavily promoted by the tobacco industry as an alternative to outright bans, via a network of ostensibly independent experts with often undisclosed ties to the industry. However, not all critics have connections to the industry. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) officially concluded in 2005 that while completely isolated smoking rooms do eliminate the risk to nearby non-smoking areas, smoking bans are the only means of completely eliminating health risks associated with indoor exposure. They further concluded that no system of dilution or cleaning was effective at eliminating risk. The U.S. Surgeon General and the European Commission Joint Research Centre have reached similar conclusions. The implementation guidelines for the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control states that engineering approaches, such as ventilation, are ineffective and do not protect against secondhand smoke exposure. However, this does not necessarily mean that such measures are useless in reducing harm, only that they fall short of the goal of reducing exposure completely to zero. Others have suggested a system of tradable smoking pollution permits, similar to the cap-and-trade pollution permits systems used by the Environmental Protection Agency in recent decades to curb other types of pollution. This would guarantee that a portion of bars/restaurants in a jurisdiction will be smoke- free, while leaving the decision to the market. In animals Multiple studies have been conducted to determine the carcinogenicity of environmental tobacco smoke to animals. These studies typically fall under the categories of simulated environmental tobacco smoke, administering condensates of sidestream smoke, or observational studies of cancer among pets. To simulate environmental tobacco smoke, scientists expose animals to sidestream smoke, that which emanates from the cigarette's burning cone and through its paper, or a combination of mainstream and sidestream smoke. The IARC monographs conclude that mice with prolonged exposure to simulated environmental tobacco smoke, that is 6hrs a day, 5 days a week, for five months with a subsequent 4 month interval before dissection, will have significantly higher incidence and multiplicity of lung tumors than with control groups. The IARC monographs concluded that sidestream smoke condensates had a significantly higher carcinogenic effect on mice than did mainstream smoke condensates. Observational studies Secondhand smoke is popularly recognised as a risk factor for cancer in pets. A study conducted by the Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine and the University of Massachusetts Amherst linked the occurrence of feline oral cancer to exposure to environmental tobacco smoke through an overexpression of the p53 gene. Another study conducted at the same universities concluded that cats living with a smoker were more likely to get feline lymphoma; the risk increased with the duration of exposure to secondhand smoke and the number of smokers in the household. A study by Colorado State University researchers, looking at cases of canine lung cancer, was generally inconclusive, though the authors reported a weak relation for lung cancer in dogs exposed to environmental tobacco smoke. The number of smokers within the home, the number of packs smoked in the home per day, and the amount of time that the dog spent within the home had no effect on the dog's risk for lung cancer. Terminology As of 2003, \\"secondhand smoke\\" was the term most used to refer to other people's smoke in the English-language media. Other terms used include \\"environmental tobacco smoke\\", while \\"involuntary smoking\\" and \\"passive smoking\\" are used to refer to exposure to secondhand smoke. The term \\"environmental tobacco smoke\\" can be traced back to a 1974 industry-sponsored meeting held in Bermuda, while the term \\"passive smoking\\" was first used in the title of a scientific paper in 1970. The Surgeon General of the United States prefers to use the phrase \\"secondhand smoke\\" rather than \\"environmental tobacco smoke\\", stating that \\"The descriptor \\"secondhand\\" captures the involuntary nature of the exposure, while \\"environmental\\" does not.\\" Most researchers consider the term \\"passive smoking\\" to be synonymous with \\"secondhand smoke\\". In contrast, a 2011 commentary in Environmental Health Perspectives argued that research into \\"thirdhand smoke\\" renders it inappropriate to refer to passive smoking with the term \\"secondhand smoke\\", which the authors stated constitutes a pars pro toto.
