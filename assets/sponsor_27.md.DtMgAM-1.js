M. Frimbo, World's Greatest Railroad Buff. Early life Whitaker's father, Charles Harris Whitaker, was an editor of the Journal of the American Institute of Architects. He lectured frequently and transited the Atlantic over 50 times on steamships. When Rogers Whitaker was nine he took his first solo train ride. He developed a love for trains that lasted his entire life. During Whitaker's sophomore year at Princeton, Whitaker's father declined to continue paying his tuition, and instead gave him $40 and a letter of introduction to use in seeking a job. Whitaker lived in a theatrical boarding house down the hall from Mae West and worked at the New York Times checking bridal announcements for hoaxes placed by jilted suitors while also selling advertising for a trade magazine. Career at The New Yorker In 1926, Whitaker was employed by The New Yorker magazine as head of the make-up department, responsible for laying out each issue. He went on to establish the fact-checking department and acted as chief proofreader at the copy desk. Eventually he rose to the level of editor, and took on many interesting duties. He covered college football from 1937 until 1968, signing the pieces \\"J.W.L.\\" because an editor reportedly liked the look of the letters together. He was also a major contributor to the magazine's \\"Goings on About Town\\" section, spending much time at cabarets and supper clubs. Whitaker retired from The New Yorker in 1975. E. M. Frimbo Whitaker's greatest love in life was traveling by train. He accumulated 2.7 million miles of such travel during his lifetime, and wrote extensively about his trips under the pen name \\"E. M. Frimbo,\\" often in collaboration with the staff writer Tony Hiss. He put his knowledge of trains to good use during World War II, where he was commissioned as a Major in the U.S. Army's Traffic Control Division of the Transportation Corps. There he helped to plan the routing of troop trains. In 1970, Whitaker testified before the Interstate Commerce Commission to argue against the Penn Central Railroad's plan to eliminate all 34 of its long distance passenger trains. A year before his death Whitaker appeared in the first episode (\\"Coast to Coast\\") of the BBC documentary series Great Railway Journeys, in which he is interviewed by the episode's narrator Ludovic Kennedy. Personal life Whitaker was a cat enthusiast who gave his cats names based on unusual criteria. \\"Epiphany\\" was named for the important day in the church calendar on which the cat came to his home. \\"Edward W.

Joyce (1827 ‚Äì 7 January 1914) was an Irish historian, writer and music collector, known particularly for his research in Irish etymology and local place names of Ireland. Biography He was born in Ballyorgan in the Ballyhoura Mountains, on the borders of counties Limerick and Cork in Ireland, and grew up in nearby Glenosheen. The family claimed descent from one Se√°n M√≥r Seoighe (fl. 1680), a stonemason from Connemara, County Galway. Robert Dwyer Joyce was a younger brother. Joyce was a native Irish speaker who started his education at a hedge school. He then attended school in Mitchelstown, County Cork. Joyce started work in 1845 with the Commission of National Education. He became a teacher and principal of the Model School, Clonmel. In 1856 he was one of fifteen teachers selected to re- organize the national school system in Ireland. Meanwhile he earned his B.A. in 1861 and M.A. in 1863 from Trinity College, Dublin. He was principal of the Training College, Marlborough Street, in Dublin from 1874 to 1893. As a member of the Society for the Preservation of the Irish Language he wrote an Irish Grammar in 1878. He was President of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland from 1906 to 1908, an association of which he was a member from 1865. Joyce was a key cultural figure of his time. His wide interests included the Irish language, Hiberno-English, music, education, Irish literature and folklore, Irish history and antiquities, place-names and much else. He produced many works on the history and culture of Ireland. His most enduring work is the pioneering The Origin and History of Irish Names of Places (first edition published in 1869).Robert Hogan, ed., Dictionary of Irish Literature (Dublin: Gill & Macmillan 1979) Joyce collection in St. Patrick's College The P.W.

These include autographed presentation copies by Joyce and his brother Robert, as well as books from Joyce's own library. The collection also contains nine manuscripts associated with Joyce and his family members, including a very fine manuscript in P.W. Joyce's own hand of Echtra Cormaic itir Tairngiri agus Ceart Cla√≠d Cormaic (Adventures of Cormac in the Land of Promise), a passage from the Book of Ballymote, which Joyce translated into English.

She was born 27 October 1891 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, US to the Irish parents of Patrick and Mary Cadden. In 1895, Cadden and her family returned to Ireland in County Mayo, where she completed years of schooling. Once she obtained her spot on the list of licensed midwives in Dublin, she opened a series of maternity nursing homes to aid women with health issues and to perform illegal abortions. After a series of criminal convictions, Cadden lost her status as a licensed midwife. In 1944, Cadden was charged and convicted for the murder of 33 year old Helen O'Reilly. She was sentenced to life in prison, and after a year at Mountjoy prison, she was declared insane and moved to the criminal lunatic asylum Dundrum, where she died of a heart attack on 20 April 1959. Although many people committed backstreet abortions during the period of Cadden's life, Cadden was the only person in Ireland to be sentenced to the death penalty for a maternal death occurring as a result of an abortion. As the most notorious Irish abortionist, the term 'Nurse Cadden' has become synonymous with evil.  Background  = Childhood = Mamie Cadden was born Mary Anne Caden on 27 October 1891 in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to Patrick and Mary Caden, and was the eldest of seven children, five of whom survived infancy. Patrick and Mary Cadden had met in America, where Patrick worked as a miner. In 1895, upon the death of her paternal grandfather, Cadden and her family returned to County Mayo, and Mamie's father inherited his father's farm. Her parents settled down, purchased a small family farm, and opened a grocery store on their land. There, her parents expanded the family and Mamie became the eldest of seven siblings and her father's favorite child. Cadden spent much of her early life on this farm, and continued to live there until she was 33 years old. = Education = While living in Mayo, Cadden and her siblings attended school from a young age. She attended Lahardane National School in Mayo until the age of fifteen, and was literate and spoke good Irish and English. After completing school, Cadden worked on her family's farm. Once many years had passed, Mamie realized she did not want to spent the rest of her life on the farm with her next youngest brother. She had always taken an interest in midwifery, and in 1925, shortly after her sister Theresa's death, Cadden sold her portion of her land to her father to finance her midwifery certification course. She moved to Dublin to train as a midwife at the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, and completed a six-month course, qualifying as a midwife on 10 December 1926.The Irish Times (Tuesday, October 23, 1956), page 4. While there, she changed the spelling of her name 'Caden' to 'Cadden' upon her move. In 1931 she purchased a property in Rathmines and ran it as her own maternity nursing home. This was a common practice among midwives at the time, the profession then being one that operated independently of nursing and medicine.  Legal context  During the time Mamie Cadden was entering the medical field in Ireland, the medical industry was dominated by Irish men. The Catholic Church and Irish political state were heavily intertwined. The Catholic Church wanted to ensure that medicine in Ireland operated under the ethos of the Church. This Catholic ethos helped ensure in the Irish health care system made things like contraceptives relatively inaccessible. In 1929, the Censorship of Publications Act banned the sale of literature that advocated the use of birth control. While the Act did not ban the access or sale of birth control, it did, however, ban the access to information about contraceptives. Birth control was officially prohibited in Ireland in 1935 until 1979. Many believed that birth control would tarnish the work in prenatal clinics and mother and baby entities. For many years, Catholic principles and Catholic professionals remained central to developments in the Irish medical scene. As a result, many women resorted to illegal abortions and contraceptives. These illegal actions were facilitated by people like Mamie Cadden.  Midwife and abortionist  = Early career = After Cadden completed her training at the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, she began working as a midwife. She first worked in the Alverno maternity nursing home on Portland Row in Dublin from 1927 to 1929. In 1929, she opened her own maternity nursing home in the suburb of Ranelagh which operated until 1931. Cadden's work became quite large, and her business outgrew her facilities. In 1931, she moved her business to Rathmines and became the owner of one of Dublin's most extensive nursing homes. Based at 4 Ormonde Terrance, she later changed the name to St. Maelruin. As there was a large demand for her services, Cadden did not need to advertise her work; and such an advertisement would have been illegal. \\"Nurse Cadden's\\" activities were an open secret and many women wanted to use her services. Enjoying a thriving business, she enjoyed a flashy social life, frequenting dances, dining and drinking in Dublin‚Äôs top hotels, and driving a highly conspicuous red open-top 1932 MG sports car. At St Maelruin, Cadden gave help for health issues, pregnancies, illegal abortions, and foster care operations for unwanted children born. Her cousin, Molly O'Grady, helped as her maid and accomplice. Cadden also accepted fees for placing children in adoption. She also operated a fostering service, which placed children with families who received payment for caring for the child. She also procured abortions ‚Äî both medical (using preparations such as ergot) and surgical (by injecting a solution). The intentional killing of an unborn child was a criminal act in Ireland at that time and remained illegal until 2018. She was sentenced to a year's hard labour in Mountjoy Prison for abandoning and exposing a new-born baby on the side of the road in County Meath. = Working after her first conviction = After her first conviction for child abandonment, Cadden was removed from the roll of registered midwives and was banned from aiding women in childbirth. When she was in prison, Cadden was forced to sell St Maelruin as she faced a financial crisis from the legal stresses of her arrest. The home sold in May 1939. Once out of prison, she resumed her illegal activities in rented premises despite having been struck off as a midwife. She also provided miscellaneous medical treatments such as supposed cures for constipation and dandruff. She fell foul of the law again in 1945 when a pregnant girl who went to Cadden for an abortion denounced her. The girl claimed that Cadden had inserted the laminaria tents which were found in her cervix. Cadden was tried under the Offences against the Person Act 1861. Despite denying the charges, she was convicted of procuring an abortion and was sentenced to penal servitude in Mountjoy Prison for five years. Having served her full term she resumed her former trade on her release, this time in Hume Street, near Dublin's fashionable St Stephen's Green. Operating out of a one-roomed flat, she was able to continue her illegal business and was still well-known enough in Dublin not to need to advertise. One of her clients died from an air embolism in the heart in 1951. Cadden left the woman's body outside on the street. Even this did not put an end to her activities as there was not sufficient evidence to connect her. Five years later, one of her patients, Helen O'Reilly, died of an air embolism during a procedure to abort a pregnancy in the fifth month. When her body was found on the pavement in Hume Street, Cadden was arrested and tried for murder. She was sentenced to death by hanging in 1956, but this was commuted to life imprisonment after public appeals for clemency and due to the unintentional nature of Helen O'Reilly's death. (The last hanging in the Republic of Ireland took place in 1954, while the last woman to be hanged was Annie Walsh in 1925.) Cadden started serving her term in Mountjoy Prison, but was declared insane and moved to the Criminal Lunatic asylum in Dundrum, Dublin, where she died of a heart attack on 20 April 1959.  Criminal record  * 1939: Cadden was sentenced to a year in prison for child abandonment. * 1945: Cadden was sentenced to 5 years in prison for an attempt to procure a miscarriage. * 1956: Cadden was sentenced to death by hanging for the murder of Helen O'Reilly. Helen O'Reilly died as a result of an air embolism. She was 5 months pregnant, and the death occurred during an abortion. Tools to perform the illegal operation were found in Cadden's flat on Hume Street. Police found a Higginson syringe, two specula - instruments used to dilate the birth canal - and a surgical clamp. Over 80 witnesses were called to give evidence in the trial, which lasted about a week.

C.W.

Summerland, also called the Astral plane Heaven, is depicted as where souls who have been good in their previous lives go between incarnations. Theosophists believe the Summerlands are maintained by hosts of planetary angels serving Sanat Kumara, the Nordic alien from Venus who Theosophists believe is the governing deity of Earth and leader of the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth. Sanat Kumara is believed to rule over our planet from the floating city of Shamballa, believed by Theosophists to exist on the etheric plane (a plane between the physical plane and the astral plane), about five miles (8 km) above the Gobi Desert. Theosophists also believe there is another higher level of heaven called Devachan, also called the Mental plane Heaven, which some but not all souls reach between incarnations ‚Äî only those souls that are more highly developed spiritually reach this level, i.e., those souls that are at the first, second, and third levels of initiation.

In order to attain Nirvana, it is necessary to have attained the fourth level of initiation or higher, meaning one is an arhat and thus no longer needs to reincarnate.

Musical career =Cap'n Jazz= Short-lived but highly influential, Cap'n Jazz helped transform emo from an underground punk subgenre into a more widely accepted subset of indie rock. The band quickly earned a cult following around Chicago and the Midwest, which would later spread to the rest of the US and the world after and around the time of the band's demise. Their unique sound, the fact that their recordings were relatively scarce, helped solidify their status as an underground legend. The band split in 1995 and their stature continued to grow. A double CD retrospective, entitled Analphabetapolothology, was posthumously released in 1998. Davey von Bohlen maintained the highest profile of any ex-Cap'n Jazzer, living in Milwaukee and founding the Promise Ring, which became one of the most popular emo bands of the '90s. Cap'n Jazz played an unannounced 5 song set in Chicago in November 2009, the first time all five members had been together since 1995, and later played 10 sold out summer shows across the US. =The Promise Ring= The Promise Ring is an American emo band from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In their early years, their music was usually classified as emo, but their later albums could be described more accurately as indie pop.[1] The band was started in 1994 as a side project by Davey von Bohlen during his time as a guitarist/vocalist for Cap'n Jazz. Von Bohlen started the project alongside guitarist Jason Gnewikow of None Left Standing, drummer Dan Didier and bassist Scott Beschta, the latter two both being former members of Ceilishrine [2]. The Promise Ring released their first full-length album in 1996 and gained a following in the US, Europe and Japan with this and subsequent albums. In 1998 von Bohlen created Tornado Country Music Publishing and continues to serve as owner. The Promise Ring is often credited as playing a major role in the creation of the emo sound and the band was known for vibrant live shows. Nothing Feels Good is their second album and was the band's first real hit and gained it a following, being praised by everyone from SPIN magazine to MTV. The band achieved a popular single with \\"Why Did Ever We Meet?\\". The title of this album was used as a title for the book Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo by Andy Greenwald. Following their final release in 2002, The Promise Ring decided to move on to new projects, including von Bohlen's and Didier's new band named Maritime. Over the years, von Bohlen and his TPR bandmates have endured many life- threatening events. During a 1999 Promise Ring tour, the band's van encountered black ice, resulting in a wreck that ejected all the band members on board and placed them in the hospital. von Bohlen was ejected through the windshield but sustained what were thought to be minor injuries. Prior to the recording of The Promise Ring's final album wood/water in April 2001, von Bohlen was diagnosed with a fist-sized meningioma which had been causing severe, crippling headaches and illness for two years and believed to be related to head trauma sustained in the accident. The fist-sized brain tumor was successfully removed and deemed benign, but a staph infection, which caused von Bohlen to pass out on stage and required two additional surgeries to remove an infected palm sized piece of his skull and to replace it a year later, prevented the band from touring for a substantial amount of time. Since then, von Bohlen appears to have a clean bill of health and has resumed recording and touring. On November 22, 2011, it was announced that The Promise Ring was reforming for a tour and possibly new material.http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/the_promise_ring_announce_milwaukee_chicago_shows_plan_rarities_album =Maritime= Maritime formed in 2003 out of the ashes of The Promise Ring and The Dismemberment Plan, initially composed of singer/guitarist Davey von Bohlen, drummer Dan Didier (of The Promise Ring) and bassist Eric Axelson (of The Dismemberment Plan). Maritime has released three full-length albums, Glass Floor in 2004, We, the Vehicles in 2006, and Heresy and the Hotel Choir in 2007. Axelson left the band in 2006 and was replaced by Justin Klug on bass and Dan Hinz was added on guitar. The band has toured each album across the US, Europe (Grand Hotel Van Cleef Records) and Japan. In late April, 2010, the band announced that they were leaving Flameshovel Records and had signed with Dangerbird Records. On April 5, 2011 the band released their newest record, Human Hearts. Maritime's next album, Magnetic Bodies/Maps of Bones was released on October 16, 2015. It is currently not known whether the band will have another album or not.

Thus, providing the best possible action requires that the guitar fingerboard have a slight curve to allow the strings to vibrate freely. Incorrect relief may cause fret buzz. To provide adjustable relief, most guitars have an adjustable truss rod. Some guitars, such as certain older Guild 12-strings, have two parallel truss rods. Turning the truss rod screw changes the tension of the truss rod, and thus the relief. Novice players should not attempt this, as the guitar neck can easily be damaged or broken. As the wood of the guitar neck is affected by temperature and humidity (weather and climate), relief may change with these altering conditions. Compensation for this may be required if fret buzz occurs, by adjusting the truss rod.

It was founded in 1936 by the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Agnes, which continues to sponsor the university today. Marian University has an enrollment of approximately 2000 undergraduate and graduate students. Seventy-one percent of students are women. Ninety-four percent of students receive financial aid. Approximately 32% of undergraduate students live on campus.University Profile at Official Website History Marian University opened as Marian College of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin on September 8, 1936, with 17 full-time and 25 part-time students, and eight faculty. The Congregation of Sisters of St. Agnes founded the college in response to a Wisconsin Department of Instruction decision that nuns were not allowed to teach in public schools while wearing their religious habits. Marian became accredited in elementary education in 1941. The first graduating class in August 1941 had eight nun graduates. The first lay students graduated in 1942. Marian had 86 full-time and 145 part-time students in 1950, who attended classes in a convent next to St. Agnes Hospital. Although founded as a women‚Äôs college, the superintendent of Fond du Lac schools attended art and music classes with his wife in 1940. Increasing enrollment caused the college to move to its current campus on Fond du Lac's east side in the mid 1960s, and the college became co-educational in 1970. The school became accredited by the North Central Association for a Master's of Arts program in 1987, and was approved for a Ph.D. program in Leadership Studies in 2002. On May 1, 2008, Marian College of Fond du Lac changed its name to Marian University to reflect an expansion of its programs and classes and to position the institution for continued growth.

Langejans is an innovative American luthier. He handcrafts everything from reversible dualette guitars to harp guitars. A descendant of farmer immigrants from Bentheim, Germany, Langejans was born and raised in Holland, Michigan, where his luthier shop keeps him busy building guitars for such notable musicians as Thom Bresh (Merle Travis's son) and Jars of Clay. His father being a homebuilder, woodworking was a skill Langejans picked up early in life. While in school, he developed a strong work ethic and an even stronger love of music. During his time in the US Navy, Langejans made regular practice of entertaining his fellow sailors with his accordion and guitar talents. After his naval discharge, Langejans took a job at Meyer Music in Holland, where he was trained in the intricacies of instrument repair and electronics. In 1971, he began to design and build his own guitars, originally bearing the name Del's. He has made over 1200 guitars as of 2006, many of them custom-made-to-order, putting Langejans guitars in the hands of numerous stars from all genre of music. The Langejans Dualette is a two sided guitar which was custom made for Thom Bresh. On one side is a steel string-guitar and on the other is a nylon-string. The harp guitar at the right was custom made for Hall of Fame Finger-picker Muriel Anderson. Langejans also makes banjo-guitars as well as standard type models. At one point, so many orders had been called in that there was a four-year waiting list for a Langejans guitar. As of 2013, the Langejans website stated \\"Del is no longer making guitars\\".

He was an enthusiastic supporter of the Nazis and an open antisemite. He is known in the field of biblical studies for his (Theological Dictionary of the New Testament). Biography Kittel was born on 23 September 1888 in Breslau. The son of Old Testament scholar Rudolf Kittel, he married Hanna Untermeier in 1914, but there were no children from the union. In May 1933, he joined the Nazi Party. He had had no previous involvement in politics but called the party \\"a v√∂lkisch renewal movement on a Christian, moral foundation\\". On 3 May 1945, after Adolf Hitler's Third Reich capitulated to the Allies, Kittel was arrested by the French occupying forces. He was subsequently removed from office and interned at Balingen. In his own defence, Kittel maintained his work was \\"scientific in method\\" and motivated by Christianity, although it may have appeared antisemitic to some. He attempted to distinguish his work from the \\"vulgar antisemitism of Nazi propaganda\\" like Der St√ºrmer and Alfred Rosenberg, who was known for his anti- Christian rhetoric, v√∂lkisch arguments and emphasis on Lebensraum. Kittel characterized his work as an \\"attempt to grapple with the problem of Jewry and the Jewish question\\". Martin Dibelius, a theologian at Heidelberg, wrote that Kittel's works related to ancient Judaism \\"are of purely scientific character\\" and \\"do not serve the Party interpretation of Judaism\\". He said further that Kittel deserved \\"the thanks of all who are interested in the scientific study of Judaism.\\" Claus Schedl, who attended Kittel's lectures on the Jewish Question in the winter of 1941‚Äì1942 in Vienna, said that \\"one heard not a single word of malice\\" and that \\"Professor Kittel truly did not collaborate\\". Schedl says that Kittel was one of very few scholars who promoted an opinion on the Jewish Question other than the official one. Kittel himself said his goal was to combat the myths and distortions of extremist members of the Nazi Party. Annemarie Tugendhat was a Christian Jew whose father had been taken to the concentration camp Welzheim in 1938. She testified that Kittel had strongly objected against the actions being taken against Jews. Kittel's work on the Jewish Question was not based on the racial theories of Nazism but upon theology. In 1946, Kittel was released pending his trial, but was forbidden to enter T√ºbingen until 1948. From 1946 to 1948 he was a pastor () in Beuron. In 1948, he was allowed back into T√ºbingen, but died that year before the criminal proceedings against him could be resumed. He died on 11 July 1948. Nazi Germany A Professor of Evangelical Theology and New Testament at the University of T√ºbingen, he published studies depicting the Jewish people as the historical enemy of Germany, Christianity, and European culture in general. In a lecture of June 1933 (The Jewish Question), that soon appeared in print, he spoke for the stripping of citizenship from German Jews, their removal from medicine, law, teaching, and journalism, and to forbid marriage or sexual relations with non-Jews ‚Äì thus anticipating by two years the Nazi government, which introduced its Nuremberg Racial Laws and took away Jewish rights of German citizenship in 1935. A close friend of Walter Frank, Kittel joined Frank's , a politicized organization upon its foundation in 1935. Within this institute he was attached to . William F. Albright wrote that, \\"In view of the terrible viciousness of his attacks on Judaism and the Jews, which continues at least until 1943, Gerhard Kittel must bear the guilt of having contributed more, perhaps, than any other Christian theologian to the mass murder of Jews by Nazis.\\" Literary works Kittel's * , 1914 * , 1914 * , 1926 * , 1926 * , 1932 * Founder and co-editor of the , 5 vols., 1933‚Äì1979 * (A theological correspondence with Karl Barth, 1934 with Karl Barth * , 1939 * (World Jewry of Antiquity ‚Äì Research on the Jewish Question), 1943 with Eugen Fischer See also * Walter Grundmann References =Footnotes= =Bibliography= : : : : : : : : : : Further reading : External links * Gerhard Kittel by Textus Receptus 1888 births 1948 deaths 20th-century Christian biblical scholars 20th-century German male writers 20th-century German Protestant theologians 20th-century lexicographers 20th-century Lutherans German biblical scholars German lexicographers German Lutheran theologians German male non-fiction writers Lutheran biblical scholars Nazi Party members New Testament scholars People from the Province of Silesia Writers from Wroc≈Çaw University of Kiel alumni University of T√ºbingen faculty ","title":"Gerhard Kittel"},{"id":"5733074","text":"Anna Anderson McCurley (n√©e Gemmell; born 18 January 1943) is a Scottish politician.

He spent portions of 13 seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals. He was nicknamed \\"Spittin' Bill\\" because he threw the spitball. He led the National League in earned run average in 1914, and he won 20 games in the 1920 season. Early life Doak was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Bertha Shattenbrand Doak and William E. Doak, a civil engineer. Both sides of Doak's family originated from Germany. He had one sibling, a younger sister. Doak's father pressured him to become a mining engineer, but Doak began playing semipro baseball in 1909. He was in the minor leagues by the next year, and made it to the major leagues by 1912. Career The St. Louis Cardinals purchased Doak's contract in the summer of 1913, and he spent the majority of his career with that team. In he went 19‚Äì6 and led the league with an ERA of 1.72. Doak won 20 games in , and led the NL in ERA again in 1921. On June 14, 1924, Doak was traded by the Cardinals to the Brooklyn Robins for Leo Dickerman.https://www.baseball- reference.com/leagues/MLB/1924-transactions.shtml He returned to St. Louis for a short time in 1929 before retiring. His lifetime record is 169‚Äì157, with an ERA of 2.98 and 1,014 strikeouts. Even though Doak played with many unremarkable teams, he is among the Cardinals' top 10 in eight pitching categories; his 32 shutouts rank second behind Bob Gibson. Doak's main pitch, the spitball, earned him the nickname \\"Spittin' Bill\\". When the pitch was outlawed in 1920, Doak was one of 17 pitchers allowed to continue throwing the spitball. Doak made his most lasting contribution to baseball by innovating the design of the baseball glove. In 1920, he suggested to Rawlings that a web should be laced between the first finger and thumb, saying it would create a natural pocket. The Bill Doak glove soon replaced all other baseball gloves and is the standard to this day. Later life Doak retired to Bradenton, Florida, where he owned a candy shop (Bill Doak's Sweet Shop), and also coached the Bradenton High School baseball team, which made it to the state championship.

The village of Shamokin was just south of the \\"forks of the Susquehanna\\", the confluence of the West Branch Susquehanna River with the Susquehanna River (sometimes called the North Branch). According to Meginness (1892), the path crossed the river \\"...in shallow water on a ledge of rocks since destroyed by the erection of the dam at Sunbury...\\" to the west (right) bank at about the current location of Shamokin Dam in Snyder County. The path then continued \\"...up the ravine in Blue Hill and followed the present road for a few miles\\" along the ridge which is the border between Snyder and Union counties. The path then turned \\"...towards the river, passed over the hill and followed the river through Winfield and Lewisburg; thence to Buffalo Creek, which it crossed where the iron bridge now spans it.

The park is noted for the springtime flowering of dogwood trees, and is popular with families for picnics and hiking. It is approximately north of Philadelphia, from exit 339 of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. History Both Fort Washington State Park and the neighboring town are named for American defenses and encampment established here in 1777, during the Philadelphia campaign of the American Revolutionary War. After Washington's defeat at the Battle of Germantown, his 11,000 troops were encamped in this area from November 11, 1777 to December 11, 1777, after which time they marched to Valley Forge for winter quarters. From December 5‚Äì8, 1777, the Battle of White Marsh was fought in the immediate vicinity. The park's Fort Hill marks the spot where a temporary fort once stood. The Pennsylvania Militia (under Generals Armstrong, Cadwalader and Irvine) held positions on what is today called Militia Hill. The park was established by Philadelphia's Fairmount Park Commission in the early 1920s. The commission, in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, administered the park until 1953. That year, an act of state legislature transferred responsibility of the park to the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters (known today as the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources). The observation deck at Fort Washington State Park overlooks the Wissahickon Valley, a National Natural Landmark. Recreation Recreational activities at Fort Washington State Park include Disc Golf, fishing, hiking, dog walking, bird and wildlife watching, sledding, cross-country skiing and picnicking. From September 1 to October 31, an organized \\"Hawk Watch\\" takes place in which viewers can observe all 16 species of raptors that migrate on the East Coast from the park's observation deck.

The Beaux-Arts building was designed by architect Jarvis Hunt, a preeminent railroad station architect, and opened in 1912. The station has not been served by trains since 1994. History The original station in 1910 Amtrak trains at 16th Street station in 1980 The original 16th Street depot was a smaller wood structure, built when the tracks were on the shoreline of San Francisco Bay. Later the shoreline was filled and now lies nearly a mile west. It was replaced in 1912 by a Beaux-Arts building designed by architect Jarvis Hunt. For decades the 16th Street station was the main Oakland station for Southern Pacific (SP) through trains, almost entirely replacing the 7th Street station. It was a companion (or \\"city station\\") for Oakland Pier, two miles away, where passengers could board ferries to San Francisco. (After 1958, the ferries were replaced by buses from 16th Street station to the SP's Third and Townsend Depot). The elevated platforms were used for the SP-owned East Bay Electric Lines commuter service (renamed IER in 1938). Many IER trains were expressed past 16th Street when the Bay Bridge opened in 1941. When the IER folded in 1941, some lines were sold to the competing Key System; however, the Key System only served the station with a surface line on 16th Street, and did not use the elevated platforms. The station also served as the main rail link for points north and east of the Bay Area. San Francisco-area passengers boarded ferries to Oakland Long Wharf, and after 1958 boarded buses to 16th Street. Amtrak took over intercity passenger rail services in 1971, and decided to consolidate most Bay Area service in Oakland, leaving San Francisco as one of the largest cities without direct intercity rail service. The station was severely damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, but continued serving trains at an adjacent building. In the 1990s, the adjacent railroad tracks were moved west during the construction of Interstate 880 (to replace the earthquake-destroyed Cypress Street Viaduct), which isolated the station from the tracks. Amtrak service to 16th Street station ended on August 5, 1994; Oakland passengers used a bus connection from the 1993-opened Emeryville station until Oakland's new main station, Oakland-Jack London Square, opened in 1995. Emeryville largely replaced 16th Street station as the connection point for Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach across the bay in San Francisco, as Emeryville is closer to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge than Oakland-Jack London Square. However, Jack London Square serves as the San Francisco connection for the southbound Coast Starlight, along with some Thruway routes to Southern California. The station buildings are largely intact, including the interlocking tower and ironwork elevated platforms. The station was purchased in 2005 by BUILD, an affiliate of BRIDGE Housing, and is being restored as part of a local redevelopment project. In 2015, the station was used to stage a local opera company's production of Lulu. As of 2019, the station is being used as a rented space for private events. In media The station was used in films including Chu Chu and the Philly Flash, Funny Lady (as Cleveland station), RENT, and Hemingway & Gellhorn (as a stand-in for the Hotel Florida). Mumford & Sons filmed their music video for \\"Babel\\" in the station.

He was a right-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1995 and 2003. He pitched in the Mexican League after his MLB retirement. Biography Acevedo attended Dundee-Crown High School in Carpentersville, Illinois, where as a senior he had an 8‚Äì0 record in baseball. After high school, Acevedo attended Parkland College in Champaign, Illinois. He was drafted by the Colorado Rockies in 1992 as a 14th round amateur pick. Acevedo signed with them June 3, 1992 and debuted April 30, 1995. During his career, Acevedo served primarily as a relief pitcher, starting only 34 of his 366 games played. Known as a journeyman, Acevedo played for the Colorado Rockies, Detroit Tigers, Florida Marlins, Milwaukee Brewers, New York Mets, New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, and Toronto Blue Jays during an eight- year career. He was a part-time closer for the Cardinals in 1998, taking over in the second half of the season for struggling veteran Jeff Brantley. He finished his MLB career with a 4.33 ERA and a 28‚Äì40 win‚Äìloss record. His 28 saves in a season for Detroit in 2002 is a record for a Mexican-born pitcher. He retired after the 2003 season. Rob Neyer and Bill James credit Acevedo as having thrown a mid-90s four seam fastball and a cut fastball. In early 2002, Acevedo married Sonja Ptach. They have three children together. Soon after their marriage, Acevedo retired as an MLB player and began pitching for Monterrey of the Mexican League. Ptach filed for divorce in 2005 for irreconcilable difference and mental cruelty. The divorce was settled with Acevedo being ordered to pay off their former home. Throughout his MLB career Acevedo made upwards of $4.5 million, but a failed restaurant investment, credit card and cell phone debt, along with money owed to the Illinois Department of Revenue caused Acevedo to not pay off his mortgage as ordered. In March 2010, Acevedo was sentenced to six months in jail for contempt of court. The charge was related to a violation of the financial terms of his divorce settlement.

Popular Library was a New York paperback book company established in 1942 by Leo Margulies and Ned Pines, who at the time were major pulp magazine and newspaper publishers. The company's logo of a pine tree was a tribute to Pines, and another Popular Library signature visual was a reduced black-and- white copy of the front cover on the title page. A native of Malden, Massachusetts, Pines became the president of Pines Publications in 1928 and continued to lead the company until 1961. He was the president of Popular Library from 1942 to 1966 and its chairman from 1966 to 1968. Retiring in 1971, he continued to work as a consultant. History Popular Library was founded in 1942 as a detective-story reprint paperback book company. Popular expanded to publish most genres. In February 1962, the company announced it was issuing a public offering of 127,500 common shares at $8 a share, through Sutro Bros. & Company. Ned Pines was retaining 318,000 shares representing 68.3 percent of the 466,000 shares outstanding. Perfect Film and Chemical Corporation purchased Popular Library in 1968. The company, which also had the Curtis Books imprint, was sold in 1970 to Fawcett Publications. Popular won the Carey Thomas Award in 1976 for distinguished fiction in mass-market publishing under editorial director Patrick O'Connor. In 1977, CBS Publications purchased Popular Library and Fawcett Books. CBS then renewed the copyright of in the Standard/Better/Nedor/Popular 1950s pulps library and the various Captain Marvel titles. In 1982, CBS Publications sold off Popular Library to Warner Communications. In April 1985, Warner Books relaunched Popular Library starting out with five other books plus the reprint of Question of Upbringing continuing each month with the follow volumes from A Dance to the Music of Time series by Anthony Powell. In addition, two books would be issued per month from Popular's new imprint, Questar, for science fiction. Writers and illustrators Although Popular Library embraced all genres, it was notable for publishing a wide variety of mystery authors. The line-up of Popular Library novelists included Mary Roberts Rinehart, John Dickson Carr, Anthony Powell, P. D. James, Harper Lee, Helen Van Slyke, Margaret Atwood, Margaret Drabble, Jean Rhys, Ann Beattie, Taylor Caldwell, Anne Tyler, Craig Rice, Cornell Woolrich, Sam Cherry, Octavus Roy Cohen, Mignon G. Eberhart, Ernest Haycox, Rufus King, Arthur Miller and John Steinbeck. Popular Library‚Äôs first 100 covers were all by the same artists, H. Lawrence Hoffman and Sol Immerman. The cover art became more eye-catching and vivid with the addition of illustrators Rudolph Belarski, Earle K. Bergey and Rafael DeSoto. John Erskine's The Private Life of Helen of Troy is an early Popular Library title with conspicuous cover art and blurb (\\"Her lust caused the Trojan War\\") which made it eagerly sought by collectors.

The title of King of the Goths (, , ) was for many centuries borne by both the kings of Sweden and the kings of Denmark. In the Swedish case, the reference is to G√∂taland (land of the Geats), in the Danish case, to the island of Gotland (land of the Gutes). Gotland has traditionally been interpreted as the original home of the Goths.  Migration period  Jordanes' Getica has a number of legendary kings of the Goths predating the 4th century: Berig (the leader of the original Goths during their migration from Scandza to Oium), and Filimer son of Gadaric (\\"about the fifth since Berig\\"). A Gothic leader named Cniva is recorded for the Battle of Abritus of 250. Attila the Hun styled himself \\"Attila, Descendant of the Great Nimrod. Nurtured in Engaddi. By the grace of God, King of the Huns, the Goths, the Danes, and the Medes. The Dread of the World\\".  Swedish title  A papal letter from about 1100 is directed to two Swedish kings‚ÄîInge the Elder and Halsten or H√•kan R√∂de (only the initials are given)‚Äîas Kings of the Visigoths, which has been interpreted as meaning that they only ruled over Westrogothia, and had lost control over the rest of the country. In a papal letter dated 5 September 1164, King Charles VII of Sweden (Karl Sverkersson) (c 1130‚Äì67; reigned 1161‚Äì1167) was addressed as rex Sweorum et Gothorum. The first Swedish king to regularly use the title was King Magnus III of Sweden, particularly after he had in c 1278 had his final win over his deposed brother Valdemar who had hitherto held lands of V√§sterg√∂tland. First Sveriges och G√∂tes Konung up to later decades of Gustaf I of Sweden, then Sveriges, G√∂tes och Vendes Konung, was used in official documentation. Between 1814 and 1905 Sveriges, Norges, G√∂tes och Vendes Konung was used, adding Norway. Sveriges, G√∂tes och Vendes Konung was used again from 1905 up to the accession of Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in 1973, who was the first monarch officially proclaimed Sveriges Konung (\\"King of Sweden\\") and nothing else.  Danish title  Coat of arms representing the Danish monarchs' title as 'King of the Goths'. Today it is a common symbol of Jutland.Forsvaret.dk - Om Jydske Dragonregiment The first Danish king to use the title was Valdemar IV (reigned 1340 to 1375), who adopted it in 1362Svane, Erling: Det danske Rigsv√•ben og Kongev√•ben, Odense University Press, 1994, p. 172 after conquering Gotland the previous year. The Danish kings continued to use the title over the next six hundred years until 1972, when Queen Margrethe II succeeded. She abandoned the use of all her predecessors' titles except her title as 'Denmark's Queen', which is the royal style today. First documented 1449, the arms of the Danish monarchs contained until 1972 a subcoat representing the title King of the Goths: on gold, a blue heraldic leopard above nine red heraldic hearts.

It is not to be confused with the similarly-looking symbol for Funen. King of the Wends (; ) was a pan- Scandinavian title denoting sovereignty, lordship or claims over the Wends, a people who historically populated Western Slavic lands of southern coasts of the Baltic Sea, those otherwise called Mecklenburg, Holstein and Pomerania, and was used from the 12th century to 1972 by Kings of Denmark and from c. 1540 to 1973 by the Kings of Sweden. The generally accepted interpretation is that the word refers to the Wends, West Slavic peoples that lived on the south shores of the Baltic Sea, although the situation is further complicated by the existence of the Vends, located between the Finns and the Wends and with somewhat unknown origin. The title's one poetic explanation also was kingship over the antique people of the Vandals (vandalorum rex), but that idea came only in the 16th century. A recent interpretation, not much supported in academic research, has been made that the part \\"Vend\\" in the later established titles of the Kings of Sweden (three kingdoms: King of the Svear, G√∂tar and Vends; Svears, G√∂ters och Venders konung) means Finland, the form presumably being akin to winds, \\"vind\\". As such, the √ñsterland‚Äîthe medieval name for the Finnish part of the Swedish kingdom‚Äîwas the third part of the realm. However, only forty years after the adoption of the title \\"king of the Wends\\", the Swedish kings began to style themselves as \\"Grand Prince of Finland\\" as well. Kings of Denmark bore the title for eight centuries, after it was first adopted by King Canute VI (reigned 1182 to 1202), who conquered the lands of the Wends in Pomerania and Mecklenburg. In Germanic languages, the name was Wends, and in medieval documentation the Latin name was sclavorum rex, referring to the Slavic peoples in and around the region now known as Mecklenburg. In the 16th century, Latin sclavorum was changed to vandalorum also by Danish kings, showing the new poetic idea. The Danish Kings continued to use the title over the next seven hundred years until 1972, when Queen Margrethe II succeeded. She abandoned the use of all the royal titles except for that of Denmark's King/Queen, which is the royal style today. When Sweden had made its final breakaway from the Kalmar union that united it with Norway and Denmark, tensions between the two rulers were high, and it showed also in their flags, coat-of-arms and titles. Gustav I of Sweden adopted c 1540 the third \\"kingdom\\" to his titles (which hitherto had only included Sweden and the Goths): he took \\"Vandalorumque\\" rex, \\"Venders\\" konung as the third name of the list of kingships. Sveriges, G√∂ters och Venders konung ('King of Sweden, the Goths and the Wends') was used in official documentation up to the accession. in 1973, of Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, who was the first monarch to be proclaimed Sveriges konung (\\"King of Sweden\\") and nothing else.

Though it is called a freeway, it is composed of both limited-access and high-speed divided highway portions. There are also two segments of the highway that are two lanes, separated by a center turn lane: a brief portion in west-central Washington County (west of Sandersville) and another brief portion in northern Jefferson County (completely within the city limits of Wrens). As of August 2018, the Fall Line Freeway is 100% open to traffic. Between August 2017 and July 2018, the highway was completed. The Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) announced that the highway was officially signed as SR 540 on September 24, 2018. Most of the FLF was a piecing together of segments of pre-existing highways, upon which SR 540 was designated in September 2018. It consists of U.S. Route 80 (US 80) from the Alabama state line to Geneva and from Macon to East Macon; SR 22 from Alabama to Geneva; SR 41 in Geneva; SR 96 from Geneva to west of Fort Valley; SR 90 from west of Junction City to Junction City; SR 49 Connector (SR 49 Conn.) from west of Fort Valley to Fort Valley; SR 49 from Fort Valley to Byron; Interstate 75 (I-75) from Byron to Macon; I-16 in Macon; SR 87 from Macon to East Macon; US 23/US 129 Alternate (US 129 Alt.) from Macon to East Macon; SR 19 from Macon to East Macon; SR 57 from East Macon to southwest of Gordon; SR 24 from southeast of Milledgeville to east of Sandersville; SR 88 from east of Sandersville to Wrens; US 1/SR 4 from Wrens to Augusta; US 221 in Wrens; and SR 17 in Wrens. From 2018 to 2019, the highway formerly used the southern portion of SR 243, from southwest of Gordon to north-northeast of Ivey, until that highway was decommissioned. The portion of the highway from north-northeast of Ivey to southeast of Milledgeville was newly built highway, specifically for this project. The FLF is proposed to be the main portion of the Georgia segment of I-14. This Interstate Highway is currently entirely within Central Texas and may be extended into Augusta. Route description Contrary to its description as a \\"freeway,\\" the Fall Line Freeway is a four-lane divided highway, except for short two-lane sections west of Sandersville and within Wrens and undivided portions in places like Reynolds, Macon, and Ivey. Four freeway sections exist: following the J.R. Allen Parkway (part of US 80/SR 22), which is the bypass north of Columbus, Interstate 75 (I-75) from Byron to Macon, I-16 in Macon, and the interchange with US 441 between Ivey and Sandersville, south of Milledgeville. The highway is designed to assist the flow of commercial traffic, providing an easier path for freight trucks carrying goods between Columbus and Augusta, avoiding Atlanta. Much of the route follows US 80, SR 96, SR 24, SR 88, and US 1/SR 4, while other parts are separate alignments, such as much of the portion between Scottsboro and Sandersville. =Muscogee County= The Fall Line Freeway as seen in between Columbus and Macon SR 540 and the FLF begin on an unnamed bridge over the Chattahoochee River, at the Alabama state line, on the Phenix City, Alabama‚ÄìColumbus city line, concurrent with U.S. Route 80 (US 80) and SR 22\\\\. The state line is also the western terminus of SR 22\\\\. On the Alabama side of the state line, US 80 (and the unsigned designation Alabama State Route 8) travel on the J.R. Allen Parkway, a freeway into Phenix City. On the Georgia side, US 80, SR 22, SR 540, and the FLF utilize the parkway as a bypass of most of Columbus. They head to the east-northeast and curve to the northeast. Immediately, they have an interchange with the northern terminus of SR 22 Connector (SR 22 Conn.; Manchester Expressway). Just over later, they meet SR 219 (River Road). After an interchange with Bradley Park Drive, they meet Interstate 185 (I-185 and its unsigned companion designation SR 411) and US 27/SR 1 (Veterans Parkway). On the eastbound side is also access to Moon Road, which has a separate exit on the westbound side. The highways then meet Blackmon and Schomburg roads. After a curve to the southeast, the freeway ends, and the roadway changes to a divided highway. Almost immediately, they have an interchange with US 27 Alternate (US 27 Alt.) and SR 85\\\\. They curve to the east-northeast and then meet the eastern terminus of SR 22 Spur (Macon Road). They travel in a generally northeastern direction until entering Upatoi. There, they curve to the southeast. Then, they curve back to the east- northeast and cross over Baker Creek, where they leave the city limits of Columbus and Muscogee County and enter Talbot County. =Talbot County= The highway continues to the east-northeast and travels just to the north of Box Springs. After beginning to head to the northeast, FLF crosses over Rockmore and Upatoi creeks and intersects the northern terminus of SR 355\\\\. It curves to an easterly direction and intersects SR 41, which joins the concurrency. US 80, SR 22, SR 41, SR 540, and the FLF curves to the northeast and enters Geneva. In the central part of the city, US 80, SR 22, and SR 41 make a left turn to the north-northwest at the western terminus of SR 96\\\\. Here, the FLF takes the beginning of SR 96 to the northeast. Almost immediately, it intersects the western terminus of SR 240\\\\. The roadway curves to the east- southeast and leaves Geneva. The highway then intersects a former segment of SR 96\\\\. Then, it begins a gradual curve to the northeast. Right after curving back to the south-southeast, it begins a concurrency with SR 90\\\\. Approximately later, SR 90, SR 96, SR 540, and the FLF intersect another former segment of SR 96\\\\. The highway enters Junction City. It curved to the east-southeast and intersects Old Mauk Road, which leads to the main part of Junction City. It curved to the east-northeast and intersected the southern terminus of Buckner Road, which also leads to the main part of the city. At this intersection, SR 90 turns right to the south-southeast. The FLF curves back to the east-southeast, leaving the city limits and enters Taylor County. =Taylor County= The FLF (SR 96, SR 540 ) travels through the southern part of Howard. Just after beginning a curve to the south-southeast, it intersects the western terminus of Old 96 Road, the former path of SR 96 through Butler. The highway travels on a southern bypass of the city. Just west of the city is an intersection with SR 137 (Charing Road). The highway curves to the east- southeast. Just before an intersection with the northern terminus of Payne Farm Road and the southern terminus of Tower Street, it enters the southern part of Butler. There, it intersects US 19/SR 3 (South Broad Street). Just after leaving the city limits of Butler, the highway curves to the northeast. After a curve to the east-northeast, it intersects the eastern terminus of SR 96's former path through Butler. It curves to the southeast and enters Reynolds just before an intersection with the southern terminus of Hicks Road. It curves to the east and enters the main part of the city. It intersects SR 128 (Winston Street). Just west of Collins Street, the highway curves to the east-northeast. It curves to the east-southeast and leaves the city limits of Reynolds just to the west of an intersection with the northern terminus of South General John B. Gordon Road. It curves to the southeast and then back to the east- northeast. and crosses over the Flint River on the Ward Edwards Bridge. Here, it enters Crawford County. =Crawford and Peach counties= SR 96, SR 540, and the FLF curve to the east-southeast and then gradually curve to the northeast. During a curve to the east-northeast, they enter Peach County. Just to the west of Aldridge Road, they re-enter Crawford County. Less than later, they re-enter Peach County. They curve to the northeast and intersect the southern terminus of SR 49 Conn. Here, SR 96 turns right to the southeast, towards Fort Valley, while SR 49 Conn., SR 540, and the FLF head to the northeast on a bypass of the city. They curve to the east-northeast. Just after an intersection with Peggy Drive, they pass Fort Valley Middle School. After a curve to the northeast, they pass Hunt Elementary School and intersect US 341/SR 7 (Hartley Road). They curve to a due-east direction before curving to the southeast, where they intersect SR 49\\\\. Here, SR 49 Conn. ends, and SR 540 and the FLF take SR 49 to the northeast. They curve to the east-northeast and then back to the northeast. They cross over Mule Creek and enter Powersville. There, they intersect the western terminus of SR 247 Conn. (Robert Ray Parkway) and the southern terminus of Newell Road. The highways curve to the north-northeast. They enter Byron. In the city, they intersect SR 42\\\\.

At an interchange with I-520 (Bobby Jones Expressway; and its unsigned companion designation SR 415), both SR 540 and the FLF end, while US 1 and SR 4 continue into the heart of Augusta. History =1920s to 1960s= The roadway that would eventually become SR 540 (Fall Line Freeway) was established at least as early as 1919 as part of SR 22 in the northern part of the Columbus area, SR 49 from Fort Valley to Byron, SR 24 in the western part of the Sandersville area, and an unnumbered road from Wrens to Augusta. By the end of 1921, SR 22 was shifted southward to travel between Columbus and Geneva. SR 19 was established from Macon to East Macon. SR 57 was established between East Macon and Gordon. SR 24 was placed on the Wrens‚ÄìAugusta segment. By October 1926, US 80 was designated on the Columbus‚ÄìGeneva segment. US 1 was designated on the Wrens‚ÄìAugusta segment. By October 1929, SR 24 was removed from the Wrens‚ÄìAugusta segment and was replaced with SR 4. In 1931, SR 96 was established between Geneva and Reynolds. In 1937, SR 96 was shifted to the southeast, onto the Reynolds‚ÄìFort Valley segment. Between January 1945 and November 1946, SR 243 was designated between Gordon to south-southwest of Milledgeville. Between June 1960 and June 1963, I-75 was proposed in the Byron area. An unnumbered road was built from SR 171 northwest of Louisville to Wrens. By 1966, I-75 was completed from Byron to the I-475 interchange and proposed from there to the I-16 interchange. I-16 was proposed in Macon. SR 88 was established on the Sandersville‚ÄìWrens segment. In 1966, I-16 was completed in Macon. The next year, US 80/SR 22 was proposed to be shifted southward in the Macon area. =1970s and 1980s= In 1970, I-75 was completed just south of I-16. The next year, I-75 was completed in the Macon area. In 1983, the J.R. Allen Parkway, the freeway bypass of the main part of Columbus, was proposed along its current path. By the beginning of 1986, this freeway was under construction from the Alabama state line to just east of US 27/SR 1\\\\. A southeastern bypass of Macon, designated as SR 758, was proposed from US 80/SR 22 at US 41 Bus./US 129 Alt./SR 11 in the southern part of the city east-northeast, northeast, and north-northeast to US 23/US 80/US 129 Alt./SR 19/SR 87 east of Ocmulgee National Monument in what is now East Macon. In 1988, it was completed, with US 80/SR 22 shifted onto it. The northern bypass of Fort Valley, designated as SR 49 Connector, was proposed on its current path. Also, the northern bypass of Sandersville, designated as SR 816, was proposed from Deepstep Road northwest of the city to SR 88 east-northeast of it. In 1989, SR 816's proposed path was extended westward to SR 24 west of Sandersville. =1990s and 2000s= In 1991, the Sandersville bypass was completed and redesignated as a westward extension of SR 88. The next year, SR 49 Conn. was completed. In 1993, a southern bypass of Butler, designated as SR 827, was proposed from SR 96 west-northwest of the city to SR 96 east of it. In 1997, the western part of SR 758 was completed. In 1999, this bypass's proposed designation, SR 827, was canceled. In 2000, all of SR 758, except for the completed portion, was canceled. At this time, the Butler bypass was completed, but no route number was designated. In 2004, a new roadway, from SR 243 north-northeast of Ivey to SR 24 southeast of Milledgeville, was proposed. Also, SR 758 was re-proposed on its previous path. The next year, SR 758's proposed path was again canceled. Also, the proposed roadway between Ivey and Sandersville was also canceled. In 2006, SR 96 was shifted onto the Butler bypass. Also, SR 758 was decommissioned. =2010s= Between 2011 and 2013, SR 243 was extended southward as a western bypass of Gordon. The highway's final section of new roadway between SR 24 and US 441 south of Milledgeville in Baldwin and Wilkinson counties, as well of the widening of SR 24 to the Sandersville bypass, was awarded to Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. of Fleming Island, Florida in January 2013. It appears as though GDOT has delayed plans to address the highway's passage through the city of Wrens, where it reduces to a two-lane road through downtown with a center turn lane. According to GDOT's GRIP maps, the section through Wrens is considered complete. Other documents suggest that GDOT has entertained the idea of a Wrens bypass, however. The highway was estimated to cost $75.3 million. Between 2013 and 2015, a new road was built from SR 243 north-northeast of Ivey to US 441/SR 29 south-southeast of Scottsboro. The segment between the Scottsboro and Sandersville areas was completed and opened to traffic in October 2016. In 2016, the new portion of highway was extended to SR 24 southeast of Milledgeville, and SR 243 was extended on it. Between August 2017 and July 2018, the highway was completed. GDOT announced to the public that the highway was officially signed as Georgia State Route 540 on September 24, 2018. In October 2018, GDOT began installing SR 540 shields in Columbus. Future The Fall Line Freeway, including portions of US 80 is proposed to be included in an extension of I-14, which currently extends from Copperas Cove to Belton, Texas and may be extended to Augusta.

Amand Yegorovich Struve () (30 May 1835 - 12 September 1898) was a Baltic German military engineer and bridge specialist of Russian Empire. Struve's relatives included diplomats, engineers, government officials and military officers. He was a graduate of the main artillery school of the Imperial Russian Army and received his engineering education at the Nikolaevsky Engineer Academy. From 1858 to 1862 he was chief of construction of the Moscow-Nizhny Novgorod Railway, which was opened from Moscow to Vladimir on 14 (26 New Style) June 1861 and to Nizhny Novgorod on 1 (13) August 1862. In 1863 he established workshops at Kolomna to manufacture iron structures for bridge spans. This facility was converted in 1871 to manufacture machinery under the name A. Struve, Kolomna Maschinenfabrik with his brother Gustav as manager. This was the forerunner of today's Kolomensky Zavod (German: Lokomotivfabrik Kolomna). Struve was chief of construction in 1864-65 of the Oka bridge of the Moscow-Ryazan Railway, the first bridge in Russia intended for both railway and road traffic. He next supervised construction of a section of the Moscow-Kursk Railway; this road was opened from Moscow to Kursk on 17 (29) September 1868. From 1868 to 1870 Struve was chief of construction of the Struve Bridge on the Dnieper at Kiev. This was the first Russian bridge in which the foundation was laid using the caisson method. His subsequent bridge projects included the Dnieper bridge at Kremenchug (1870-72), the Liteiny Bridge on the Neva at St. Petersburg (1875-79), and the Alexandrovsky Bridge on the Volga at Syzran (1876-1880). Upon completion of the Liteiny Bridge in 1879, Struve was promoted to Major General. When his brother Gustav died in 1882 he assumed management of the works at Kolomna. In Kiev Struve built a central sewerage system, horse-pulled railway (1885-86), the first electric tramway in the Russian Empire (1891-92), and a gas-powered street lighting system. Promoted to Lieutenant General in 1896, Struve died at Kolomna on 31 August (12 September) 1898.

The winner of the game earned a berth in Super Bowl IV in New Orleans against the champion of the American Football League. The Minnesota Vikings of the Western Conference hosted the Cleveland Browns of the Eastern Conference. It was the Vikings' first appearance in the title game, while the Browns were making their second straight appearance and fourth of the 1960s. Minnesota had a regular season record of 12‚Äì2, including a 51‚Äì3 defeat of the Browns eight weeks earlier on November 9. The Vikings defeated the Los Angeles Rams 23‚Äì20 in the Western Conference championship a week earlier at Met Stadium. They were coached by Bud Grant and led on offense by quarterback Joe Kapp and wide receiver Gene Washington. The defense allowed only 133 points (9¬Ω per game) during the regular season and their four defensive linemen were known as the \\"Purple People Eaters.\\" Cleveland was 10‚Äì3‚Äì1 during the regular season and had upset the Dallas Cowboys 38‚Äì14 at the Cotton Bowl for the Eastern Conference title. The Browns were coached by Blanton Collier; Bill Nelsen was the starting quarterback and Gary Collins and Paul Warfield were star wide receivers for the team. Although not as severe as the \\"Ice Bowl\\" of 1967, the weather conditions were bitterly cold at , with a sub-zero wind chill factor. Cleveland linebacker Jim Houston suffered frostbite during the game and was hospitalized. Minnesota was favored by nine points to win the title game at home, and they won, 27‚Äì7. Of the four NFL teams that joined the league during the AFL era (1960s), Minnesota was the sole winner of a pre-merger NFL championship. The Dallas Cowboys entered the league in 1960 and lost two NFL title games to the Green Bay Packers, in 1966 and 1967. The expansion Atlanta Falcons (1966) and New Orleans Saints (1967) did not qualify for the postseason until 1978 and 1987, respectively. The Vikings would go on to lose Super Bowl IV 23-7 to the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs. Starting with the season, the NFL champion was determined in the Super Bowl, beginning with Super Bowl V. Game summary Cleveland had lost the previous season's NFL title game 34‚Äì0 at home, and this time fared little better. The Vikings dominated the game, racking up 381 yards with no turnovers, while Cleveland gained just 268 yards and turned the ball over three times. The Vikings took a lead just four minutes into the first quarter, driving 70 yards for a touchdown in 8 plays. The key play of the drive was a pass from Joe Kapp to receiver Gene Washington that was nearly 5 yards short of the mark. Despite the short throw, Washington was able to come back and haul it in for a 33-yard gain to the Browns' 24-yard line. Two plays later, Dave Osborn's 12-yard run moved the ball to the 7. Then two plays after that, Bill Brown accidentally slipped and bumped into Kapp while moving up to take a handoff, but Kapp simply kept the ball himself and ran it 7 yards for a touchdown. The situation never got any better for Cleveland. The next time Minnesota got the ball, defensive back Erich Barnes slipped while in one on one coverage with Washington, enabling him to catch a pass from Kapp and take off for a 75-yard touchdown completion. Barnes had been knocked down by linebacker Jim Houston, his teammate, and this made the score 14-0 after only a few seconds more than 7 minutes of play. Near the end of the first quarter, Browns running back Leroy Kelly lost a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Wally Hilgenberg on the Cleveland 43. Kapp then completed a 12-yard pass to Washington before Fred Cox finished the drive with a 30-yard field goal, putting the Vikings up 17‚Äì0. Later in the second period, Hilgenberg snuffed out a Cleveland scoring threat by intercepting a pass from Bill Nelsen on the Vikings' 33-yard line. Minnesota subsequently drove 67 yards in 8 plays. Kapp started the drive with a pair of completions to John Henderson for 17 total yards, while Osborn broke off a 16-yard run and ended up finishing the drive with a 20-yard touchdown burst, giving the Vikings a 24‚Äì0 lead with 4:46 left in the first half. Cleveland responded with a drive to the Vikings' 17, but turned the ball over on downs when Nelsen overthrew receiver Gary Collins in the end zone on 4th and 3. The third quarter was mostly uneventful, other than Cox's 32-yard field goal that gave Minnesota a 27‚Äì0 lead after an 11-play, 80-yard drive. The most noteworthy play was a 13-yard scramble by Kapp in which he plowed into 240-pound Browns linebacker Jim Houston so hard that Houston was knocked out of the game. In the 4th quarter, Cleveland finally got on the board when a diving 18-yard reception by Paul Warfield set up Nelsen's 3-yard touchdown pass to Collins. There were still 13 minutes on the clock at this point, but there would be no more scoring. The Vikings had a drive to the Cleveland 2-yard line, but decided to let the clock run out instead of go for another score. Kapp completed just 7 of 13 passes, but for 169 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 57 yards and another score. Osborn rushed 18 times for 108 yards and a touchdown. Washington had 120 yards and a touchdown on just 3 receptions. Kelly was the Browns' top rusher with 80 yards, while also catching two passes for 17. Nelsen completed just 17 of 33 passes for 181 yards, with one touchdown and two interceptions. The Browns had trouble on the frozen turf of Metropolitan Stadium even though many players wore broomball shoes.

In addition to policy development, he directed extensive research into corruption in the then NSW Government, contributing to a number of public inquiries and criminal prosecutions. His extensive filing database caused the then Leader of the Opposition and later Premier Bob Carr to refer to him as \\"Lord of the Files\\". Upon the change of government in March 1988, he was appointed as Director-General of the NSW Cabinet Office in the Liberal- National Coalition Government led by Premier Nick Greiner. In the five years he served as Cabinet Secretary, Sturgess personally drove a number of major policy initiatives, including the establishment of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the corporatisation of government business enterprises, the so-called \\"new environmentalism\\" (including tradeable air, water and fishing permits), and the creation of electricity markets. From 1990, he was involved in the \\"new federalism\\" agenda, initiated by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Premier Greiner. He led the team of NSW officials at a series of Special Premiers Conferences that produced new policies such as the National Competition Policy, the National Electricity Market, mutual recognition of state regulations, and, ultimately, the formation of the Council of Australian Governments. He retired from public administration in late 1992, six months after the resignation of Greiner as Premier. From 1993 to 2000, Sturgess chaired a series of government inquiries - into business regulation, the governance of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the financial management of the Australian Federal Police and the rationalisation of Australia's border controls, among other issues. He also served on a number of public, private and not-for-profit boards, including the Australian Constitutional Centenary Foundation, the NSW Police Board and spent seven years as a non-executive director of the Serco Group PLC, a FTSE-100 public service company operating in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific. In 2000, Sturgess relocated to London, where he joined Serco as Adviser to the Board and then from January 2003, as Executive Director of the Serco Institute, whose purpose is \\"to foster the development of sustainable public service markets through an outward-facing programme of research and communication\\". In that capacity, he played a leading role in the establishment of the Public Services Strategy Board, the UK's first industry association representing the public service industry, underneath the umbrella of the Confederation of British Industry. He continued to serve as adviser to the Public Services Strategy Board until 2011. He resigned from the Serco Institute in April 2011 and returned to Australia to take up the New South Wales Premier's ANZSOG Chair in Public Service Delivery at the University of New South Wales, a research position based in the government precinct in Sydney and studying the challenges involved in front-line service delivery. In 2014, he was also appointed as Professor of Public Service Innovation at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia. In 2015, he was appointed by the NSW government to chair an inquiry into 'point-to-point transportation', which resulted in the legalisation of ride-sharing and a substantial reconstruction of the regulations governing the taxi industry to enable them to compete. He was appointed to the Heritage Council of New South Wales in 2016.  Research interests  Since taking up the chair with ANZSOG in 2011, Sturgess has specialised in studying the relationship between policy/funding and delivery, with a particular focus on the discipline of commissioning. As part of that research agenda, he has developed a contestability framework for public services‚Äî\\"benchmarking with consequences\\"‚Äîbuilding on the work of the British health economist Chris Ham. He is actively involved in the application of these principles in the real world, and in 2015, he was appointed by New South Wales Cabinet to chair a Commissioning and Contestability Advisory Board, advising the NSW Minister for Corrections. In 2016, the NSW government established a Commissioning and Contestability Unit in Treasury, based on his work. Sturgess has advised a number of government inquiries on commissioning - the Victorian and Queensland Commissions of Audit (2012 and 2013), the National Commission of Audit (2014), the Harper Review of Competition Policy, the New Zealand Productivity Commission's review of social services (2015) and more recently the Australian Productivity Commission's review of human services (2016). He has also advised numerous central and line departments and agencies in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Canada. He lectured at the UK government's Commissioning Academy from 2013 to 2016, and has taught a three- day Commissioning Academy in Ontario, Canada since 2015, and more recently in Ottawa. In March 2017, Sturgess published a study of public service contracting in the UK, for the Business Services Association, entitled 'Just Another Paperclip?'. He was highly critical of the way in which public service contracting has developed in recent years, and laid the primary responsibility on government, arguing that public service markets are not like commodity markets, but rather are government's supply chain. Since 2000, he has also undertaken detailed primary research into the contractual system used for transporting convicts to Australia in the early years of European settlement, and has delivered a number of academic papers and published articles in peer- reviewed journals on the operation of this system. In 2012, he started detailed research to identify the site where the founding Governor of Australia, Arthur Phillip, came ashore in Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788 - based on new documents, maps and drawings that had come to light in the more than 50 years since the question was last considered. The research he undertook with a colleague, Michael Flynn, has generally been accepted. He also led a media campaign, which resulted in the port-a-loo that had been erected on the landing site being removed. Honours Sturgess was awarded membership of the Order of Australia in January 2005, for services to government.  Personal  He remains involved as a director of his late father's business, Engine Australia, an Australian after-market diesel engine parts supplier. He married his wife Helen in Brisbane in 1976, and they are the parents of four children.

Population: History Sergey Kirov founded Kirovsk in 1929 as the settlement of Nevdubstroy () in order to serve the nearby 8th Sergey Kirov Power Station. At the time Nevdubstroy formed part of Mginsky District with its administrative center in the settlement of Mga. The district remained a part of the Leningrad Okrug of Leningrad Oblast until August 15, 1930, when the okrugs were abolished as well, and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. On January 21, 1931 the settlement of Nevdubstroy was transferred to Leningradsky Prigorodny District. On May 20, 1936 it was granted urban-type settlement status and renamed rabochiy poselok pri 8-y GES imeni Kirova (); the name was later shortened to rabochiy poselok imeni Kirova (). On August 19, 1936, when Leningradsky Prigorodny District was abolished, the settlement transferred back to Mginsky District. Between September 1941 and January 1944, during World War II, German troops occupied the settlement. The settlement was renamed Kirovsk - after Sergey Kirov (1886-1934) - and granted town status on November 5, 1953. On December 9, 1960, Mginsky District was abolished and split between Volkhovsky and Tosnensky Districts. Kirovsk transferred to Tosnensky District. On February 1, 1963, it became a town of oblast significance. On April 1, 1977, Kirovsky District was established by splitting areas off from Volkhovsky and Tosnensky Districts, with the administrative center in Kirovsk, essentially in the limits of the former Mginsky District. In 2010 the administrative structure of Leningrad Oblast was harmonized with its municipal structure, and Kirovsk became a town of district significance. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kirovsk serves as the administrative center of Kirovsky District.Oblast Law #32-oz As an administrative division, it is, together with the settlement of Molodtsovo, incorporated within Kirovsky District as Kirovskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Kirovskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Kirovsky Municipal District as Kirovskoye Urban Settlement.Law #100-oz Economy and infrastructure The town consists of the Old Town built in the 1950s and Ladoga, the part built during the Soviet construction boom of the 1980s. The main industries suffered severely during the 1990s. Most people try to find work in the nearby St. Petersburg. Kirovsk has four high schools, a music school and a hospital, but no maternity ward. The main employers are the Ladoga plant (which manufactured Soviet nuclear submarine equipment until it switched to machine parts and electronics), Dubrovsky Zavod and the 8th Power Station. Because of these industries, Kirovsk was in Soviet times considered a closed town. Kirovsk (Nevdubstroy railway station) is connected by railway to Mga. There are several direct suburban trains to St. Petersburg's Moskovsky railway station and Ladozhsky railway station. The A120 road, which encircles St. Petersburg, passes Kirovsk. The M18 Highway, which connects St. Petersburg and Murmansk, passes several kilometres north of the town. The Neva River is navigable. Kirovsk is home to the Diorama, which is housed inside the Ladozhsky Bridge over the Neva River. The site, otherwise known as \\"The Road of Life\\", commemorates Kirovsk's role as being the sole entry point for goods destined for Leningrad when Nazi German troops besieged the city during World War II.

He is best known for his intense rivalry, reconciliation, and then resumption of hostilities with Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr.  Early life and career  1917 cartoon of attorney Walmsley Walmsley was born to a prominent family in Uptown New Orleans. He was the son of wealthy cotton factor Sylvester Pierce Walmsley and his wife, the former Myra E. Semmes. He attended Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama, and then Tulane University in New Orleans, where he was a student athlete. In 1912, he graduated from Tulane University Law School. After graduation, he became a lawyer for a New Orleans firm. On April 15, 1914, he wed the former Julia Havard of New Orleans, and the couple had one daughter, Augusta, later Mrs. Frederick J. King. He served in World War I as a major in the United States Army Air Corps, forerunner of the Air Force. From 1919 to 1924, Walmsley served as an assistant attorney general of Louisiana. In 1925, he was appointed city attorney by Mayor Martin Behrman of New Orleans, and he became a prominent figure in Behrman's Regular Democratic Organization political machine. The Old Regulars helped him to be elected as commissioner of public finance, a post which he held from 1926 to 1929. In July 1929, Walmsley was appointed acting mayor of New Orleans to fill in for Behrman's successor, Arthur J. O'Keefe, who resigned because of illness.  Walmsley as mayor  A member of the New Orleans's exclusive Boston Club, Walmsley moved in the highest social circles of the city. The conservative patrician mayor set a pro-business tone for his administration when as one of his first acts as mayor he confronted a militant strike by municipal streetcar workers. In one memorable scene he confronted an angry crowd of striking workers who had come to the city council chambers to protest the banning of improvised 'jitney' transportation. He based his election campaign in April 1930 on his response to the strike and on his credentials in restoring 'law and order,' and beat opponent Francis Williams by a comfortable margin, winning 14 of 17 wards. Continuing in this vein, Walmsley later passed an ordinance banning the spread of \\"anarchistic, communistic, or radical doctrines\\" in New Orleans. He also fired almost two thousand black city employees by enforcing a Jim Crow law banning the employment of non-voters. Walmsley's term as mayor continued an alliance between the city's social and economic elite and the city's most powerful political machine. Owing his political success to his membership in the Old Regular machine's Choctaw Club, Walmsley benefited from their ability to turn out votes and dispense patronage. In 1933, Walmsley was elected president of the National Conference of Mayors. Among the accomplishments of his administration were improvements in street paving and drainage, construction of the Municipal Auditorium, completion of a new Criminal Courts Building and the extension of New Orleans City Park towards the Lakefront. = Walmsley and Huey Long = Huey Long's election as governor in 1928 had brought a new force to Louisiana's political scene and threatened the hold of the Old Regulars on New Orleans. At first, Long had reached out to the Old Regulars by offering an alliance, but the Old Regulars participated in an attempt to impeach Long in 1929. Though initially reluctant, Walmsley accepted an alliance with Long after the Old Regulars' uncharacteristically weak showing in the 1930 U.S. Senate race which had sent Long to Washington, D.C., after Long unseated Joseph E. Ransdell in the primary election. Walmsley claimed: > an obligation I owe to my people and the people of this state to join hands > with Governor Long and bury our political tomahawk so that the city and > state can forge ahead. ... The governor worked hard to develop a program we > could all unite on; he was the victor, and he showed himself more generous. > ... When the roads and bridges he is planning are completed, more of the > city people will be going to the country, and more people will be coming to > the city. ... Let us therefore forget all bickerings and let the capitalists > and the laboring interests ... join hands as we have joined hands.Huey > Pierce Long, Jr., Every Man a King: The Autobiography of Huey P. Long (New > Orleans: National Book Club, Inc., 1933), pp. 228‚Äì230. In return for the political support of the New Orleans machine, Long promised a bridge over the Mississippi River, a Lakefront Airport, and money for infrastructure improvements. The alliance brought overwhelming Old Regular support for Long's chosen successor as governor, Oscar K. Allen, who won 70 percent of the New Orleans vote in the gubernatorial election of 1932. The alliance continued until December 1933, when Walmsley and the Old Regulars formally severed the relationship in advance of Walmsley's mayoral reelection campaign of 1934. Angered by Walmsley's repudiation of the alliance, Long picked John Klorer, Sr., to oppose Walmsley in a vitriolic campaign, culminating in a political crisis that only narrowly averted armed conflict between Long's and Walmsley's factions. Walmsley won the election, but the campaign strengthened the mayor and the governor's disdain for each other. In response to attacks on Long by Walmsley's supporters in the state legislature in 1934, Long unleashed an unprecedented attack on Walmsley's power in New Orleans. Long proposed a series of bills cutting off state funding for the city and stripping municipal government of its traditional rights to issue licenses, assess property taxes, regulate public utilities, and control the police department. In response, Walmsley invoked the memory of the white supremacist White League's armed resistance to 'despotism' during Reconstruction in order to arouse New Orleanians to attend a rally against Long in Baton Rouge in the summer of 1934. Many attendees came armed and called for the lynching of the governor, but Walmsley belatedly toned down his rhetoric and asked for restraint. After the rally, Long stepped up his assault on Walmsley by sending Louisiana National Guard troops to occupy the registrar of voters office across the street from New Orleans City Hall, setting up machine guns in the windows and declaring martial law. The confrontation escalated; Walmsley had 400 city police sent to City Hall, while Long increased his own troop strength to 3,000 and had them equipped with tear gas guns. The standoff climaxed during the congressional election of September 1934; but just as in the mayoral election in January 1934, the potential for armed conflict was averted by a last-minute truce in which both Long's National Guard and Walmsley's police agreed to stay off the streets on election day to prevent voter intimidation. Long also initiated a wide-ranging corruption investigation of the Walmsley administration, staging lurid radio testimonials from witnesses. The legislative attacks continued through 1934 and 1935; Long had laws passed stripping the municipal government of its remaining powers by having the state set budget amounts for the city and forbidding the firing of any city employee without state approval. Without the ability to collect its own revenue, New Orleans was on the verge of bankruptcy by the summer of 1935. Long's assassination on September 8, 1935, did not end the state's discriminatory policies towards New Orleans. Dissatisfaction with this state of conflict with Long and caused Walmsley's own Old Regular ward leaders to ask the mayor to resign in the hope of ending the legislative siege. Walmsley continued to resist this pressure and remained in office despite the defection of nearly the entire Old Regular organization; the Old Regular-controlled city council stripped him of all remaining powers. Walmsley finally agreed to resign in June 1936; after several interim mayors, Walmsley would be succeeded by Robert Maestri, a Longite loyalist, and the municipal government would regain the powers stripped from it by the state legislature during the feud between Long and Walmsley.  After City Hall  Walmsley as Deputy Director of the Office of Civilian Defense, 1941. Years after his resignation as mayor, Walmsley moved to Washington to become deputy director of the Office of Civilian Defense in 1941, under Fiorello La Guardia. In March 1942, Walmsley returned to active service with the Army Air Forces, but he died three months later on June 19, 1942, of a heart attack in San Antonio, Texas.  Sources  * Boulard, Garry.

ELPC's mission is to advance environmental progress and economic development together throughout the Midwest through projects that advance clean energy, clean air, clean water and clean transportation. Founded in 1993, ELPC today has a staff of more than 40 public interest attorneys, public policy analysts, scientists, finance specialists, and media experts. ELPC's annual revenues of about $6 million are raised from more than 160 foundation and individual major donors, as well as many supportive members across the Midwest and nation. The organization has consistently received the highest rating from Charity Navigator, the independent non-profit rating agency.  About  ELPC was founded in 1993 by Howard A. Learner, a public- interest attorney, after a year-long strategic planning process sponsored by seven major foundations. The organization advocates for improved policies and policy implementation at the federal, state and local levels related to renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean air, clean water and smart transportation. Attorneys who work for the organization represent local grassroots organization in litigation related to the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act and other major pieces of national environmental legislation before federal and state courts as well as state and local administrative bodies. The organization states that its attorneys and policy advocates work on multi- disciplinary teams alongside scientists, finance specialists, media experts and others. The organization's governing leadership includes a Board of Directors, Science Advisory Council, Next Generation Advisory Council and state-based advisory councils in Iowa, Michigan and South Dakota. Members of the Board and Advisory Councils include individuals from legal, civic, business and non-profit sectors.  Programs  ELPC runs a number of environmental advocacy programs: * Climate Change Solutions: ELPC aims to transform the Midwest region into a center for climate solutions that address the two most prominent sources of carbon pollution‚Äîenergy generation and transportation. This work spans the organization's other program areas related to Clean Air, Clean Energy, and Clean Transportation. * Clean Energy: ELPC works to create policies that drive markets for clean energy to succeed. This includes creating markets for wind and solar energy, designing energy efficiency programs and policies, promoting farm energy, and advancing transmission policies that support clean energy. * Clean Air: ELPC works to clean up or shut down old, dirty coal plants, often providing free legal assistance to local grassroots organizations. * Clean Water: ELPC works in Midwest states to make sure the Clean Water Act is implemented and enforced well, often providing free legal assistance to local grassroots organizations. * Clean Transportation: ELPC works to advance the Midwest High-Speed Rail Network, create a market for cleaner cars, and oppose wasteful highway spending. * Special Places: ELPC works with grassroots groups throughout the Midwest to protect the region's most precious natural treasures, including places like the Driftless Area, Great Lakes, Saugatuck Dunes, Mississippi River, and North Woods.  Political activity  Impacts made by the ELPC include: 2012 March 15: Indiana adopted anti-degradation standards, required by the Clean Water Act, to protect waterways.

He was San Diego 2005 First Round pick #18 overall. He was inducted to the University of Miami baseball Hall of fame in 2019. Where he went 24-0 to start his career. He played in Major League Baseball with the San Diego Padres in 2009. Carrillo was released by the Detroit Tigers in 2013, after he was implicated in the Bio-Genesis scandal, he served a 100- game suspension under the Tigers minor league system. He was with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2014. Amateur career = High school = Carrillo attended Mt. Carmel High School in Chicago which boasts other famous sports alums such as Donovan McNabb, Simeon Rice, Antoine Walker, Chris Chelios, and Denny McLain, where he was a two sport star in both basketball and baseball. As a junior, Carrillo decided to concentrate solely on baseball. He played both shortstop and pitcher. As a shortstop, he broke the school's single season hit record with 52 hits his junior year to go along with a 5-1 record and a 1.12 ERA. His senior year, Carrillo posted a 9-1 record with an ERA of 0.96 while batting .370 with 5 home runs and 48 RBI which led to his selection to the All-State team. = College = Carrillo chose to attend the University of Miami to play baseball for head coach Jim Morris. However, under NCAA regulations, a low score on the ACT exam which Carrillo took to gain entry into the University forced him to sit out the entire 2003 season. In Carrillo went 12-0 with two saves while keeping his ERA at 2.69 and compiling 91 strikeouts in 113.2 innings pitched. After the 2004 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Brewster Whitecaps of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Carrillo continued the undefeated streak at Miami in by going 12-0 in his first 15 games until his winning streak was ended against the Clemson University Tigers. Carrillo still managed to obtain one of the most remarkable (albeit not record breaking) streaks in the history of college baseball by starting his career with a record of 24-0. However, Carrillo lost his last two decisions as a starter, the final one coming against Nebraska and Joba Chamberlain in the 2005 Super Regional. Carrillo still compiled impressive stats in the 2005 season by going 13-3 with one save and a 2.22 ERA while striking out 127 batters in 125.2 innings pitched. Professional career =San Diego Padres= Minor leagues Carrillo was drafted in the 1st round, 18th overall in the 2005 MLB Draft by the San Diego Padres. Carrillo signed immediately even though he felt that what the Padres offered him did not match what he felt he deserved. However, Carrillo felt that in the end, his skills would do all the negotiating for him and when he signed his next contract, his loyalty and willingness to prove himself would ultimately translate into a large contract. Carrillo, by most scouts' accounts, was the most \\"Major League ready\\" pitcher in the entire draft and it was expected that he could reach the big leagues as a starter within the next year or so. According to Sports Illustrated, Carrillo's \\"stuff\\" (his array of pitches) is of Major League caliber. In 2007 scout.com ranked him as the number 1 prospect in the Padres' organization, while Baseball America moved him down to the number 2 prospect, after ranking him number 1 the year before. Carrillo throws a fastball, which has been clocked at 97 MPH, along with a change-up, curveball, and two-seam fastball that reaches somewhere between 89-91 MPH and has a lot of movement. Carrillo began his professional career with the Single-A Lake Elsinore Storm where he started 7 games and went 1-2 with a 7.01 ERA with 29 strikeouts in 25.2 innings pitched. He then made his way up to Double-A Mobile where he went 1-3 with a 3.02 ERA to go along with 43 strikeouts in 50.2 innings pitched. On May 19, Carrillo joined the Triple-A Portland Beavers. However, he was only able to pitch 2.2 innings because of tightness in his right throwing elbow. Carrillo was sent to the Padre team specialist in San Diego and was told that he would need to rehab the elbow for roughly a month. Carrillo, as well as the Padre organization, were pleased with this as opposed to Carrillo being forced to have surgery. However, in early 2007, Carrillo's arm had not responded to rest and it was determined he needed Tommy John surgery on his elbow. He rehabbed and came back to pitch in June 2008, finishing up the year with Lake Elsinore Storm. His arm strength and control improved during the summer. Carrillo played with the San Antonio Missions in 2009. Carrillo pitched well in Class AA during the second half of 2009, and was promoted to AAA Portland on July 29. Carrillo made his Major league debut on August 13, 2009 against the Milwaukee Brewers, giving up three home runs. He went 1-2 in three starts with San Diego. Carrillo competed for a spot in the starting rotation in Spring training 2010. However, he did not make the team and was optioned to Triple A Portland. On September 2, 2010, he was designated for assignment by the Padres =Philadelphia Phillies= On September 9, 2010, Carrillo was claimed off waivers by the Philadelphia Phillies. He was only with the organization for 3 days, as the Phillies designated him for assignment on September 12. The Padres then reclaimed Carrillo off waivers on September 15. =Houston Astros= On September 22, 2010 Carrillo was claimed off waivers by the Houston Astros. He was released on April 29, 2011.Astros Release Cesar Carrillo, MLBTradeRumors.com, April 29, 2011. =Detroit Tigers= At the beginning of spring training in 2012, however, Carrillo remained an unsigned free agent.

All three films tell the continuing story of El Mariachi (portrayed by Carlos Gallardo and Antonio Banderas). The films were released in theatres between 1993 and 2003, and later on a complete DVD trilogy box set in 2010. The films =Production= The trilogy began with the 1993 ultra low-budget production of El Mariachi. The film was made on a budget of only US$7,000 using 16-millimeter film, was shot entirely in Mexico with a mostly amateur cast, and was originally intended to go directly to the Mexican home-video market (a process detailed in Rodriguez's book Rebel Without a Crew). Reportedly Rodriguez got some funds for the film by offering himself up as a human guinea pig to science labs. Other finances came in the form of prize money won by his short student film, Bedhead, at film festival competitions. Executives at Columbia Pictures liked the film so much that they bought the rights to it for American distribution and eventually spent several times more than the film's original production budget on 35 millimeter film transfers, a marketing campaign and the eventual distribution/release of the film. It was so well received that they eventually chose to finance the second part of the trilogy, Desperado, and subsequently the final chapter, Once Upon a Time in Mexico. =Plots= A recurring theme of the Mexico Trilogy deals with El Mariachi being alone as all of his loved ones die in front of him. The first film of the trilogy, El Mariachi, tells the story of an out-of-work musician, known simply as El Mariachi (Carlos Gallardo), traveling through Mexico. He arrives in a small border town, hoping to find work in some of the local cantinas and clubs. Unfortunately for the man, local hoodlums mistake him for a recently escaped convict who has been hunting down his former associates with a guitar case filled with weapons. As the story progresses, El Mariachi falls in love with a woman who helps him hide from those who are trying to kill him, and eventually sees her die at the hands of those same men. He seeks revenge for all he has been put through. The second film, Desperado, continues with El Mariachi's (later portrayed by Antonio Banderas) quest for revenge where he finds a new love and quenches his thirst for revenge. The third and final film, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, revolves around a failed coup attempt on the President of Mexico wherein El Mariachi is the hero who saves him. El Mariachi also seeks revenge on the murderer who killed his wife. Reception =Box office= All three films were made using Rodriguez's \\"Mariachi-style\\" of filmmaking in which (according to the back cover of his book Rebel Without a Crew) \\"creativity, not money, is used to solve problems.\\" Thus, all three movies have been extremely profitable. El Mariachi was made for $7,000 and went on to gross more than $2 million in its theatrical release. Desperado was made for $7 million and grossed over $24.6 million in US theaters. Once Upon a Time in Mexico was made for $29 million and grossed over $56.3 million domestically and an additional $41.8 million worldwide and holds the box office distinction for being the most improved second sequel of all-time grossing 122% more than Desperado. =Awards and critical reaction= All three films have won various prestigious awards. El Mariachi won the Audience Award at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival and the 1993 Deauville American Film Festival and Best First Feature at the 1994 Independent Spirit Awards. Desperado saw Salma Hayek nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the 1996 Saturn Awards, and was nominated for the Bronze Horse at the 1995 Stockholm Film Festival. Once Upon a Time in Mexico won two Imagen Foundation Awards for performances by Antonio Banderas and Rub√©n Blades, was nominated for two Satellite Awards, winning Robert Rodriguez an award for Best Song (\\"Siente Mi Amor\\") and Johnny Depp a nomination for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role, Comedy or Musical and the movie's impressive stunts landed it two Taurus World Stunt Awards nominations. TV series adaptation A TV series adaptation of the El Mariachi franchise premiered on March 20, 2014 on AXN.

It is near the downtown loop, between Paseo and Chestnut Trafficway to the west and east, and Independence Avenue and Cliff Drive to the south and north. Pendleton Heights is one of the oldest specifically residentially- designed neighborhoods in Kansas City, preceded only by Quality Hill. It was Kansas City's first developed suburb, platted in the late nineteenth century from what had been the Jones Farm. Accordingly, the neighborhood is recognized by the City of Kansas City as a historic district. The neighborhood has three city parks (North Terrace Park, Independence Plaza Park and Maple Park), the original city reservoir, one of only two nationally listed urban scenic byways, and the largest collection of true Victorian homes in the City. Architectural styles include \\"Traditional Victorian\\", American Craftsman, American Foursquare, Italianate, Eastlake, Shingle-Style, Richardsonian Romanesque, \\"Folk Victorian\\", \\"Kansas City Shirtwaist\\", Beaux Arts, and grand Queen Anne. The neighborhood includes a castle on the bluffs (\\"Tiffany Castle\\") overlooking the East Bottoms and the Missouri River below. One home, the Philip E. Chappell house at 1836 Pendleton Avenue, has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places since 1990. Pendleton Heights hosts an annual Holiday Homes Tour and Artist Market on the first Saturday of December. Select Victorian homes decorated for the holiday season are open for tour, and neighborhood artists set up booths with items available for sale. In 2013, Pendleton Heights was featured by This Old House as one of their \\"Best Old House Neighborhoods in the US\\". The Pendleton Heights Community Garden launched in early 2013. This project is in partnership with PHNA, Kansas City Community Gardens and MU Extension. The garden occupies a formerly vacant parcel at Brooklyn and Minnie in the heart of the neighborhood. Residents can lease plots in the garden for personal gardening or work in community plots in exchange for a share of the harvest. In the summer of 2013, PHNA reached an agreement with KC Parks & Recreation to plant an orchard on the vacant lot at Lexington and Montgall. In addition to providing fresh fruit and nuts for the neighborhood, this orchard will also provide a history lesson ‚Äì the selected tree varieties represent trees grown in Northeast Kansas City as far back as 1860. Varieties include peaches, apples, figs, pecans, pawpaws, serviceberries and more. The neighborhood is home to Kansas City University of Medicine and Biosciences. The neighborhood is home to Jerusalem Farm, a Catholic intentional community whose mission is to \\"make ourselves available to the needs of our community. The main way that we do this is through addressing home repair needs and coordinating volunteers from Kansas City and around the country.\\" Jerusalem Farm offers weekly curbside composting to the residents of Pendleton Heights.

The name is pronounced \\"a-map- see-oh\\", and is typically displayed with the tagline \\"Ontario's Professional Employees\\". AMAPCEO represents just over 14,000 professional and supervisory public servants, most of whom work directly for the Government of Ontario in the Ontario Public Service (or OPS). The union also represents six bargaining units outside the OPS in the Broader Public Sector (or BPS). Of Canada's ten provinces and three territories, Ontario is the most populous (at 14.3 million in April 2018, constituting almost 40 per cent of the Canadian population) and the second largest in area (1.076 million km¬≤). Ontario's political system is based on the Westminster system of parliamentary democracy and the career public service is apolitical and non-partisan, providing objective advice to, and implementing decisions of, successive governments, regardless of the political party that is elected to form the government at any given time. AMAPCEO-represented employees in the OPS work in every government ministry and in a number of agencies, boards and commissions in over 130 cities and towns across Ontario and in twelve cities outside Canada. The six BPS bargaining units consist of: the Office of the Ontario Child Advocate (OCA), originally established as an independent office of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and more recently merged with the Office of the Ombudsman (also an independent office of the Legislature); Public Health Ontario (PHO, formerly known as the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion), an independent provincial Crown agency; Waypoint Centre for Mental Health Care (formerly the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre), which was the final psychiatric hospital divested from direct provincial government control; the Evidence Development and Standards Department at Health Quality Ontario (HQO, formerly known as the Ontario Health Quality Council), an independent provincial Crown agency that promotes and monitors quality assurance in the health-care sector; the Ontario Arts Council (OAC), an independent agency that promotes and funds artists and arts organizations; and the Office of the French Language Services Commissioner (OFLSC), established as an independent office of the Legislative Assembly in 2014, but more recently merged with the Office of the Ombudsman. (A seventh BPS unit at the Ontario Racing Commission was also represented by AMAPCEO until the ORC's 2016 merger with the Alcohol and Gaming Commission of Ontario.) About eighty per cent of AMAPCEO members work in the provincial capital city of Toronto. Members include: policy analysts, financial analysts, auditors, economists, mediators, arbitrators, educators, information technology professionals, scientists, chaplains, veterinarians, program supervisors, clinical co-ordinators, psychiatric patient advocates, media relations and communications officers, epidemiologists, arts granting officers and many others. The union also represents senior economic officers in the Ontario Ministry of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, who are based in Canadian high commissions, embassies and consulates abroad. As a trade union, AMAPCEO is relatively young, having been established in 1992 as a grassroots organization to represent employees who, at that time, were excluded from collective bargaining (and who were not legally entitled, therefore, to join a union). In 1993, AMAPCEO negotiated a Social Contract sectoral framework agreement with the provincial government on behalf of 12,000 non-unionized civil servants. When bargaining rights were extended by the government to some previously-excluded employees, AMAPCEO successfully signed up a sufficient number of members (subsequently certified by the Ontario Labour Relations Board) to achieve voluntary recognition by the government as an official bargaining agent in March 1995. At that time, the membership was approximately 4,500 employees in a single bargaining unit within the OPS; total bargaining unit membership has more than tripled in size since certification, encompassing sIx bargaining units in both the OPS and the BPS. AMAPCEO celebrated the 20th anniversary of its founding in 2012 and its 25th anniversary in 2017. Since its establishment in 1992, AMAPCEO has negotiated contracts with governments representing all three of Ontario's major political parties. Under a governance structure implemented on January 1, 2017, members are assigned to one of eleven geographic Districts based on where they work; there are eight Districts in the City of Toronto and three outside Toronto, proportionate to the distribution of AMAPCEO members across the province. Ten of the Districts are about the same size (roughly between 1,000 and 1,300 members), with the Northern District slightly smaller. The AMAPCEO Board of Directors consists of fifteen members: the four executive officers (President, Vice-President, Secretary and Treasurer), who are elected by Delegates at the annual convention, and twelve Directors, each elected from and by the members in one of the 11 Districts. The Board Director in each District presides over a District Executive Committee, consisting of that District's Delegates, who are elected roughly on the basis of one Delegate for every 50 members. The annual convention consists of the fifteen members of the Board of Directors plus all Delegates - just over 200 in total at the present time. (In addition to participating as members of their Districts, members in each of the six BPS bargaining units separately elect one dedicated Delegate from their unit, to ensure that all bargaining units are represented at the annual convention.) All Delegates and members of the AMAPCEO Board serve two- year terms, staggered so that approximately one-half of the Delegates, Directors and executive officers are elected annually. Before his initial election as President on January 1, 2015, Dave Bulmer, worked as a professional educator in London for the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. He has subsequently been re-elected. He previously served as AMAPCEO's Treasurer and before that, as a Director on the Board. Vice-President Cynthia Watt was first elected effective January 1, 2016, and has subsequently been re-elected. At the time of her election, Watt worked as a senior policy advisor on postsecondary matters, based in Toronto, where she was chair of the AMAPCEO chapter in the Ministries of Education and Advanced Education and Skills Development. During their terms of office, the President and Vice- President are on full-time leave from their bargaining unit positions and work in the AMAPCEO office in Toronto. The other two elected executive officers are the Secretary, Glynn Robinson, and the Treasurer, Chris Harper. The Executive Committee consists of the four executive officers plus the Board Chair, who is a Director elected by the Board each year (currently Angela Freeman, Director for the University/Toronto South District). Dave Bulmer is AMAPCEO's third President and Cynthia Watt is the fourth Vice-President. They were preceded by: Founding President Janet Ballantyne, 1992-1995 (the Vice-President during that period was Arthur (Art) Halpert), and immediate past President Gary (Gary) Gannage, 1995-2014 (who worked with former Vice-Presidents Robert (Bob) Stambula, 1995-2013, and Sally Jurcaba [aka Sally Pardaens, and previously as Sally Rudka], whose sole two-year term in 2014-2015 straddled the final year of the Gannage Era and the first year of Dave Bulmer's presidency). AMAPCEO employs just over 40 full-time professional staff who provide advice and services to members from a single office in Toronto (located at 1 Dundas Street West at the corner of Dundas and Yonge Streets, a location close to where most members work and where most of the union's employer counterparts are based). All employees in the office, except for the senior management staff, are members of a bargaining unit represented by the national Canadian union, Unifor. Rob Smalley is the Chief Operating Officer. Other senior management staff include: Angela Stewart, Director of Finance and Administrative Services; Jennifer Sherwood, Director of Membership Services, and Farrah Charania, Manager, Human Resources and Administrative Services.

It was directed by James Signorelli and written by Dangerfield, Michael Endler, P. J. O'Rourke and Dennis Blair. The original music score was composed by Laurence Rosenthal. The theme song \\"Easy Money\\" is performed by Billy Joel and was featured on his album An Innocent Man. Plot Montgomery \\"Monty\\" Capuletti is a hard-living, heavy-drinking, pot-smoking, gambling family man who makes his living as a baby photographer in New Dorp, Staten Island. He loves his wife Rose but has a very tense relationship with his wealthy, snobbish mother- in-law, Mrs. Monahan, who runs a successful department store chain and hates the way Monty acts and lives. There is an added ethnic rivalry between Monty and his wife's family, as he is Italian and they are Irish. The irresponsible Monty cannot even pick up a wedding cake for his engaged daughter Allison without fouling up. He and his best friend Nicholas 'Nicky' Cerone are smoking marijuana while driving, and an accident destroys the cake. After Mrs. Monahan dies unexpectedly, his family is in for an inheritance. Attorney Scrappleton reveals that Mrs. Monahan left a stipulation in her will that if Monty is able to curb his vices for a year by going on a diet and giving up drugs and gambling, he will receive $10 million. If not, the family gets nothing. Allison's wedding to Julio goes off without a hitch, at least until the wedding night. Monty's gambling and drinking buddies are also interested in whether or not Monty can really give up everything and bet whether or not he will make it. Monty and Nicky go to the mother-in-law's department store and find awkward fashions, catering to a clientele which clearly do not include the likes of Nicky and Monty. Nicky argues that it may not be worth it to Monty if this is the kind of atmosphere he will be exposed to, but Monty points out he must tough it out to provide for his wife and daughters, not just him. Meanwhile, Mrs. Monahan's scheming nephew Clive Barlow does his best to undermine Monty's resolve so the money and department store can instead be left to him. Monty ultimately reforms. When the entire year is up, he and the family celebrate aboard a boat. To his chagrin though, Mrs. Monahan turns up. She had faked her own death simply to persuade her slovenly son-in-law to straighten up. Ultimately though, she gives the money to Monty on the basis he upheld her stipulation. Now rich, Monty and his family live in a mansion. Still in control, Mrs Monahan denies Monty dessert and coffee then commands a beer she found in the refrigerator be thrown out. Monty gleefully agrees to each action then says he's heading out for a walk. Mrs. Monahan gloats about her actions and that she finally has Monty under control to her daughter's chagrin. However, Monty has actually proceeded to a hideaway under the house to join Nicky and his friends for pizza, poker, and beer.

He is funny just standing still--or his version of standing still, which includes nervous twitching, profuse sweating, pained expressions and rolling of the eyes.\\" Siskel also called Easy Money \\"a film that's easy to like\\" and also praised Pesci's performance, calling him \\"the unsung hero of 'Easy Money,' an actor whose very appearance gives this little film a lot of class.\\" See also * List of American films of 1983 References External links 1983 films 1983 comedy films American films American comedy films English- language films Orion Pictures films Films shot in New Jersey Films shot in New York City Films directed by James Signorelli Films with screenplays by Rodney Dangerfield Films scored by Laurence Rosenthal 1983 directorial debut films ","title":"Easy Money (1983 film)"},{"id":"5733325","text":"Vendsyssel Forenede Fodboldklubber is a professional football club based in Hj√∏rring, Denmark. The team currently competes in the Danish 1st Division, the second tier of Danish football. The club plays home matches at Nord Energi Arena, which has a capacity of 7,500. The club is playing on a license from Hj√∏rring IF, which used to belong to FC Hj√∏rring. The club is a cooperation between Hj√∏rring IF and Frederikshavn fI. History The roots of Vendsyssel FF can be traced to 9 November 1886, where Hj√∏rring Gymnastikforening was founded. After multiple mergers, the club was named Hj√∏rring IF in 1921. The club's existence has been marked by relative anonymity, bouncing between the lower divisions of the Danish football pyramid. Renamed FC Hj√∏rring in 2006, the club, however, soon found success, secured promotion in their 2009‚Äì10 Danish 2nd Divisions campaign. This meant their first promotion to the Danish 1st Division, the second tier in the Danish football league system. In May 2013, the Danish Football Association announced that FC Hj√∏rring's licence would be revoked due to poor economy, resulting in a relegation to the Danish 2nd Divisions. FC Hj√∏rring appealed the decision, which was successful, as the Danish Football Association assessed that the financial situation had improved sufficiently in order to renew the licence for the 2010-11 Danish 1st Division. On 24 June 2013, FC Hj√∏rring announced a merger with Frederikshavn fI, which would subsequently change the name of the club to Vendsyssel FF. On 3 March 2014, Frederikshavn fI officially announced that they would step out of the merger on the senior level, but that they intended to continue a partnership with Vendsyssel FF on the youth level. In the summer of 2018 the club earned its first promotion to the highest tier in Danish football by beating Lyngby BK in two games in the Superliga playoffs, after losing in the playoffs the year before to AC Horsens. They only lasted one season in the Superliga, however, as they were relegated the following season. Stadium Vendsyssel FF's Nord Energi Arena, more popularly known as Hj√∏rring Stadion, was opened in 1930 and went through renovations in 2014. Besides being the home ground for Vendsyssel FF, it also functions as home ground for nine-time Danish women's football league winners, Fortuna Hj√∏rring.

A gamine is a slim, elegant young woman who is, or is perceived to be, mischievous, teasing or sexually appealing. The word gamine is a French word, the feminine form of gamin, originally meaning urchin, waif or playful, naughty child. It was used in English from about the mid-19th century (for example, by William Makepeace Thackeray in 1840 in one of his Parisian sketches), but in the 20th century, came to be applied in its more modern sense.  Lexicography  In 1997 the publisher HarperCollins drew up a list of 101 words ‚Äì one a year ‚Äì that defined the years 1896 to 1997.See The Times, 3 November 1997 \\"Gamine\\" was chosen for 1899, being described by Philip Howard in The Times as follows: Gamine has been used particularly of such women in the performing arts or world of fashion. In that context, the closest English word ‚Äì of Anglo-Norman origin ‚Äì is probably \\"waif\\" (although \\"gamine\\" is often seen as conveying an additional sense of style and chic). For example, in a press release of 1964, impresario Andrew Oldham described the 17-year-old singer Marianne Faithfull as \\"shy, wistful, waif-like\\";Faithfull ‚Äì An Autobiography, 1994 and writer and musician John Amis referred to German-born actress Luise Rainer (b. 1910) as Paul Muni's \\"waif-wife\\" in the 1937 film, The Good Earth.The Oldie, August 2006 Gaminerie has sometimes been used in English with reference to the behaviour or characteristics of gamin(e)s.  In silent films  In the early 20th century, silent films brought to public attention a number of actresses who sported a gamine look. These included the Canadian-born Mary Pickford (1892‚Äì1979), who became known as \\"America's Sweetheart\\" and, with her husband Douglas Fairbanks, was one of the founders of the film production company United Artists; Lillian Gish (1893‚Äì1993), notably in Way Down East (1920); and Louise Brooks (1906‚Äì86), whose short bobbed hairstyle, widely copied in the 1920s, came to be regarded as both a gamine and a \\"Bohemian\\" trait (this style having first appeared among the Paris demi-monde before World War I and among London art students during the war.Virginia Nicholson (2002) Among the Bohemians) In 1936, Charlie Chaplin cast his then-girlfriend Paulette Goddard (1910‚Äì1990) as an orphaned gamine (credited as \\"A Gamin\\") in one of his last silent films, Modern Times.  Audrey Hepburn and gamines of the 1950s  In the 1950s \\"gamine\\" was applied notably to the style and appearance of the Belgian-born actress Audrey Hepburn (1929‚Äì1993): for example, in the films, Sabrina (1954) and Funny Face (1957). Hepburn also played the role of the gamine Gigi in New York (1951) in the play of that name, based on the novel (1945) by Colette, who had personally \\"talent-spotted\\" her when she was filming in Monte Carlo.Judith Thurman (1999) Secrets of the Flesh ‚Äì A Life of Colette On film and in photographs, Hepburn's short hair and petite figure created a distinct and enduring \\"look\\", well defined by Don Macpherson,Stars of the Screen (Marks & Spencer, 1989) who cited her \\"na√Øvet√© which did not rule out sophistication\\", and described her as \\"the first gamine to be accepted as overpoweringly chic\\". Other film actresses of the period regarded as gamines included Leslie Caron (b. 1931), who played the leading role in the 1958 musical film of Gigi; Jean Seberg (1938‚Äì79), best known in Bonjour Tristesse (1957) and Jean-Luc Godard's √Ä bout de souffle (1960); Jean Simmons (1929-2010), for example, in Angel Face (1952); and Rita Tushingham (b. 1940), whose first starring role was in A Taste of Honey (1961). The French singer Juliette Gr√©co (1926-2020), who emerged from Bohemian Paris in the late 1940s to become an international star in the 1950s, also had gamine qualities.  1960s and beyond  In many ways, the \\"gamine look\\" of the 1950s paved the way for the success of the following English models: Jean Shrimpton (b. 1942), one of the first to promote the mini-skirt in 1965; Twiggy (b. Lesley Hornby, 1949), who became \\"The Face of '66\\";\\"The face of '66\\" BBC News and Kate Moss (b. 1974), associated in the 1990s with the \\"waif\\" look and what, notably through an advertising campaign for Calvin Klein in 1997, became known as \\"heroin chic.\\" Moss was part of a trend of \\"wafer\\" thin models which was satirized in Neil Kerber‚Äôs strip cartoon \\"Supermodels\\" in the magazine Private Eye. Gamines share similarities with the modern, cinematic \\"Manic Pixie Dream Girl\\" stock character.  Other gamines  Others who have been described as gamines include Danish-French actress Anna Karina (1940‚Äì2019); American actresses Julia Roberts (b. 1967) (she was often compared to Audrey Hepburn at the start of her career), Edie Sedgwick (1943‚Äì1971), Elizabeth Hartman (1943‚Äì1987), Mia Farrow (b. 1945), Sissy Spacek (b. 1949), Winona Ryder (b. 1971), Michelle Williams (b. 1980), Gwyneth Paltrow (b. 1972),The Austin Chronicle 2009-02-27.

As Governor of Chile Manso de Velasco served as governor of Chile from November 1737 to June 1744, during which time he stood out for his numerous projects. His tenure saw the construction of the first public food market in Santiago, irrigation canals on the Maipo River as well as breakwaters on the Mapocho River, the rebuilding of Valdivia (destroyed by an earthquake), and the celebration of an armistice with the indigenous Mapuche people, signed in the \\"Parlement of Tapihue\\". In addition, he founded a large number of Chilean cities listed here with their current names, their given names, and their date of founding: * Cauquenes (Nuestra Se√±ora de las Mercedes), 1742 * Copiap√≥ (San Francisco de la Selva), 1744 * Curic√≥ (San Jos√© de Buena Vista), 1743 * Melipilla (San Jos√© de Logro√±o), 1742 * Rancagua (Santa Cruz de Triana), 1743 * San Felipe, 1740 * San Fernando (San Fernando de Tinguiririca), 1742 * Talca (San Agust√≠n de Talca), 1742 His efficiency and diligence recommended him to a higher post, and Ferdinand VI named him viceroy of Peru in 1745, making him the first governor of Chile to be elevated in such a manner. As Viceroy of Peru Portrait of Antonio Manso de Velasco in the Museo Hist√≥rico Nacional of Chile Statue of Governor Jos√© Antonio Manso de Velasco in the city of Rancagua. Manso de Velasco was the viceroy of Peru during the reign of Ferdinand VI of the House of Bourbon, holding the office from 1745 to October 12, 1761. He succeeded Jos√© Antonio de Mendoza, 3rd Marquis of Villagarc√≠a and was replaced by Manuel de Amat y Juniet. The most important event of his tenure was the great earthquake of 1746. =Lima earthquake= On October 28, 1746 at around 10:30 at night, a major earthquake struck Lima and vicinity, resulting in one of the highest number of deaths for such an event in the area. Witnesses differ on the duration of the event, with reports ranging from 3 to 6 minutes. The intensity of the quake is today estimated at X or XI on the Mercalli intensity scale. The aftershocks, by the hundreds, continued for the following two months. In Lima, the destruction was severe. Of 60,000 inhabitants, 1,141 were reported to have died. Only 25 houses remained standing. In Callao, a tsunami of nearly 17 meters in height penetrated up to 5 kilometers inland leaving only 200 survivors out of a population of 5,000. The fact that the earthquake struck at night probably contributed to the casualties, as many people were caught asleep in their homes. In the wake of the disaster, the population was gripped by hunger and fear. As a result of this earthquake, building practices were modified, with the adobe style abandoned for quincha (wattle and daub) construction techniques, which resulted in more flexible structures that were more resistant to disruptive seismic activity. On February 10, 1747 he founded the city of Bellavista. On May 30, 1755 the cathedral of Lima was begun. Last days Photograph of the tomb that keeps the remains of Manso de Velasco, located in the Church of San Pedro in the city of Priego de C√≥rdoba The aged and tired Manso de Velasco asked for permission to return to Spain for his retirement, and received a positive answer from the crown in 1761. However, his trip home took him through the port of Havana in the then-Captaincy General of Cuba, just at a time when the colony was under siege. The British laid siege to the port, and Manso de Velasco, nominally the highest-ranking military officer in the area, found himself named the \\"Chief of the War Council\\" by the Governor of Cuba. Thus, at age 74, he led the defense of the fortified city. Unfortunately, the troops under his command were poorly trained and their equipment was inferior, leading to a Spanish surrender after only 67 days. Photograph of the street name sign at Conde de Superunda street in Priego de C√≥rdoba dedicated to the homonymous count. Captured by the British, he was eventually brought to Cadiz in Spain. Due to his position as \\"Chief of the War Council\\", he was imprisoned in Madrid and tried by a court- martial presided over by the Count of Aranda. He and other accused chiefs were held responsible for the inglorious defeat in Cuba by this court-martial. Charles III, King of Spain, ratified the sentences on March 4, 1765 ending the process. The sentences were not lenient, Manso de Velasco was condemned to 10 years of exile to 40 leagues from the Court, seizure of goods and he was made jointly responsible for compensating harmed Habaneros. Shortly after being notified of the sentence Manso de Velasco left for his exile in Priego de C√≥rdoba, where he arrived the same year. Less than two years later, on January 5, 1767, he died in the same city, where his remains still lay in the Church of San Pedro.

Mikroutsikos presented the first and second series of the famous reality show Big Brother on the ANT1 channel. He also presented ANT1's music academy Fame Story. Mikroutsikos moved to Alpha TV where he presented the reality show Apo Kardias (By My Heart). The show was banned by the Greek authorities after an episode in which a woman accused her husband of forcing her to agree to bestiality, specifically sexual acts with their dog. Mikroutsikos defended himself by saying that all the things presented through his popular show were pieces of the puzzle of our life and by closing our eyes we just ignore the problem. Mikroutsikos was nicknamed \\"realitaras\\" (reality trump). Personal life Mikroutsikos has been married three times, with Maria Dimitriadi, trainer Foteini Georganta and TV presenter Dimitra Roubessi. He also had a long-term relationship with singer Sophia Vossou. Mikroutsikos has a son, Stergios, from his first marriage with Maria Dimitriadi. He is the brother of Thanos Mikroutsikos. Mikroutsikos, the son of a mathematician, has a degree in mathematics himself. As a youngster, he was a member of the Revolutionary Communist Movement of Greece.

Halfway along it forms the southern junction of Chalfont Road. The road is probably named after the village of Polstead in the county of Suffolk. Overview The houses in Polstead Road were designed by Harry Wilkinson Moore and built between 1887 and 1894. St Margaret's Institute Community Centre was the first building constructed on Polstead Road, following a subscription by parishioners of St Philip and St James Church in 1889 \\"for the building of a Working Men's Institute, 'to provide rational amusement and instruction for working men of any creed, sect, or opinions, who may thus be kept out of public houses'\\".

Lawrence of Arabia's childhood home from 1896 to 1921 at 2 Polstead Road Blue plaque on Lawrence's former home The Lawrence family The most famous resident was T. E. Lawrence (1888‚Äì1935), later known as 'Lawrence of Arabia'. The son of Thomas Chapman (1846-1919; who became, in 1914, Sir Thomas Chapman, 7th Baronet), an Anglo-Irish nobleman, he was brought up in a house (No. 2) on this road and a blue plaque records the fact. The future Sir Thomas Chapman, the 7th Baronet of Killua Castle in County Westmeath, Ireland, separated from his wife to live with his daughters' governess, Sarah Junner, also known as Sarah Lawrence. They had five sons and the couple lived under the names of Mr and Mrs Lawrence, moving to No. 2, Polstead Road in the summer of 1896 with the aim that the children could receive a good education for a reasonable cost. T. E. Lawrence attended the City of Oxford High School for Boys in central Oxford. Here also was born his youngest brother, A. W. Lawrence, who went on to become the Laurence Professor of Classical Archaeology at Cambridge University in the 1940s. The house is a semi-detached red-brick house that had been built approximately six years before the Lawrences moved there. They built a bungalow in the garden because the house was not large enough to accommodate the entire family. 2 Polstead Road remained the Lawrence family home until 1921. Lawrence was in residence when he departed for the First World War. In January 2017, it was reported that Oxford City Council had failed to gain Grade II listed status for the Lawrence home, leaving its future in doubt.The Sunday Telegraph [non-internet, paper only], Sunday, 22 January 2017.

Stanley Sadie, 2nd Ed. (2001)  Life  Silcher was meant to be a school teacher, but dedicated himself entirely to music in the seminary in Ludwigsburg after he met Carl Maria von Weber. He was taught composition and piano by Conradin Kreutzer and Johann Nepomuk Hummel. In 1817 he was named musical director at the University of T√ºbingen. He is regarded as one of the most important protagonists of choir singing. He arranged many German and international folk songs that even today remain standard repertoire of many choirs in Germany and became an integral part of German daily life. In 1829 Silcher founded the \\"Akademische Liedertafel\\" in T√ºbingen and directed it until his death. He was married to Luise Rosine Ensslin (6 September 1804 in T√ºbingen ‚Äì 17 June 1871 ibid.).

The species is endemic to North America. It is sometimes referred to as the common ground snake or variable ground snake, as its patterning and coloration can vary widely, even within the same geographic region.Stebbins, R.C. (2003). A Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians, Third Edition. The Peterson Field Guides Series ¬Æ. Boston and New York: Houghton Mifflin. xiii + 533 pp. . (Sonora semiannulata, pp. 391‚Äì393 + Plate 45 + Map 170). Another common name is miter snake referring to the head marking which suggests a bishop's miter; the synonym \\"episcopus \\" (Latin for \\"bishop\\") is a similar allusion. Geographic range S. semiannulata is native to the Southwestern United States, in Arizona, Nevada, California, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregonhttps://www.dfw.state.or.us/wildlife/living_with/docs/livingwsnakes.pdf, Texas, and Utah, as well as northern Mexico, in Chihuahua, Coahuila, Durango, Nuevo Le√≥n, and Sonora. Description The western ground snake can grow to a total length (including tail) of 8 to 19 inches (20.3 to 48.3 cm). The color and pattern can vary widely. Individuals can be brown, red, or orange, with black banding, orange or brown striping, or be solid-colored. The underside is typically white or gray. It has smooth dorsal scales, a small head, and the pupil of the eye is round. Habitat The preferred habitat of S. semiannulata is dry, rocky areas with loose soil. Behavior The western ground snake is typically nocturnal and secretive, but it is common throughout its range. It is often found on roadsides, or in dry drainage ditches at night, foraging for food. Diet The diet of S. semiannulata consists primarily of invertebrates, such as spiders, scorpions, centipedes, crickets, and insect larvae. Reproduction The western ground snake is oviparous, breeding and laying eggs through the summer months. Taxonomy Sonora semiannulata was once broken up into five separate subspecies, based on the vast differences in color and patterning that the species displays, but recent research has shown that the various colors and patterns of ground snake interbreed indiscriminately, making distinction between them impossible and thus not warranting subspecies status, though some sources still refer to them, using geography as a basis rather than morphology.

The Ballyhoura Mountains () are located in south-east County Limerick and north-east County Cork in central Munster, running east and west for about 6 miles on the borders of both counties. Features The southern part of the hills is largely afforested with conifers, on the northern side there is extensive heathland and blanket bog. The mountains include Seefin (528m, 1702 ft), near Seefin on the northwest is Black Rock (516m, 1696 ft) and 3 miles to the west is Carron Mountain (c.440m, 1469 ft) on the boundary of Cork and Limerick. Immediately east of Seefin is Knockea (1311 ft), east of which again is the detached mountain of Knockeennamroanta (1319 ft). Between these is the pass of Barnaderg, now called Redchair, leading from the plain of Limerick to the plain of Cork. At the north side of the valley is the peak of Barnageeha (1196 ft). The Ballyhoura Mountains have been listed as a Special Area of Conservation. The blanket bog occurs in most of the flatter areas and features such species as heather (Calluna vulgaris), with deergrass (Scirpus cespitosus), hare‚Äôs-tail cottongrass (Eriophorum vaginatum), common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and crowberry (Empetrum nigrum). The wet heath is dominated by heather, cross- leaved heath (Erica tetralix) and bilberry accompanied by a range of mosses and liverworts. The dry heath is more species-rich, with bell heather (Erica cinerea), green-ribbed sedge (Carex binervis), tormentil (Potentilla erecta), bent grasses (Agrostis spp.) and mosses such as Hypnum jutlandicum. The Ballyhoura Mountain Bike Park situated near under Seefin and Blackrock is the largest Trail network of its kind in Ireland. The trails range from the moderate 6 kilometre Greenwood loop to the demanding 50 kilometre Castlepook loop. The nearest towns and villages to the Trailhead are Ardpatrick, Glenosheen, Ballyorgan and Kilfinnane.

It is directed by John Irvin, produced by Evzen Kolar and Ken Solarz and written by Solarz. Plot Retired thief, Roy Egan (Harvey Keitel), comes out of retirement to help his youngest brother, Lee (Timothy Hutton), with a jewelry heist in Palm Springs. Along for the ride are hired muscle, Jorge Montana (Wade Dominguez), and wheelman, Skip Kovich (Stephen Dorff). The heist goes down the next day and, thanks to Jorge's scrambling of the police monitors and traffic signals, their getaway is successful. In Skip's motel room, his girlfriend, Gena (Dana Barron), voices how little money he will be receiving from the heist. At the trailer park Lee and Jorge are having some beers and talking about how much each will make when Skip shoots them. Roy, who was in the bathroom, hears the gunshots, slams the door on Skip, and runs for it. Roy steals a car and heads to Los Angeles where he rents a room and starts plotting. He stops at Jorge's house along the way to inform his wife, Rachel (Famke Janssen), about her husband's death and to ask if she knows Skip's whereabouts. Skip employs Odell and his crew as protection against Roy, and proceeds to deal with his debt to loan shark Harvey (Elliott Gould). Harvey is connected with the Chinese mob and Skip convinces Harvey to use his connections to track down Roy, in exchange for more money on top of what he already owes him. Roy is found by two members of the Chinese mob and kidnapped but he frees himself, killing his captors in the process. Rachel finds a bruised and bloody Roy lying in her yard. She cleans him up and Roy offers her $5,000 to take care of him. Once he recovers, Rachel asks for $100,000 instead. Roy refuses at first, but when she gives him Jorge's address book full of contacts ‚Äì including Skip ‚Äì he accepts. Rachel also tells Roy where the Chinese mob launders cash and gives him a Saint Christopher medal for protection. Roy attacks the man in charge, Uncle Luke (Fran√ßois Chau), and takes Skip's money, but unknowingly leaves his motel key behind. Uncle Luke tells Skip about the key Roy left behind. Chinese mobsters later attempt to kill Roy in his motel room, but Roy is waiting for them. Skip kidnaps Rachel. He goes to a trailer where his girlfriend Gena finds that Odell has sent two of his guys to get the money Skip owes them. They take Gena hostage and Skip kills them both, purposefully killing Gena in the process. Skip and Roy plan to meet at a refinery and when Roy arrives, he gets into a gun fight with the mob who are after Skip. Roy takes them out, but is severely wounded, although still able to beat Skip to death with his bare hands. He rescues Rachel who speeds a barely conscious Roy to a hospital. When she returns, both Roy and her car are gone, but he has left her money in a duffel bag. Rachel and her children bury Jorge and relocate to Port Arthur, Texas. One day, the postman delivers a small package to her. She opens it and finds the religious medal she gave Roy, assuring her that he's alive.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada, the House of Commons of Canada, the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, the Senate of Canada and as the mayor of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec.  Early life  Joseph-Hyacinthe Bellerose was born on July 12, 1820 at Trois-Rivi√®res to father Michel-Hyacinthe Bellerose, a merchant, and mother Genevi√®ve-Sophie Lema√Ætre. The young Joseph attended a local Trois-Rivi√®res school until 1833, when he began attending S√©minaire de Nicolet. Educated there until 1836 or 1837, Bellerose completed his classical education at S√©minaire de Saint-Hyacinthe in 1842. He began to study law in Montreal and married Henriette Armand on October 4, 1847. After marriage, the couple moved to Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec, where Bellerose entered business and began farming. There, he joined the militia and raised twenty volunteer regiments, before his commissioning as ensign in the 2nd Battalion of Terrebonne militia on December 6, 1855. On January 29, 1857, Bellerose was made captain of the 1st Company of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul volunteer militia and on December 4 of that same year was made a brigade major. The next year, he was approached regarding a captaincy position in the 100th foot of the regular army, but declined the offer for reasons unknown. On May 22, 1861, he became brigade major of Military District No. 8 and commanding officer of the new 12th Battalion of Volunteer Militia on October 29, 1862.Joseph-Hyacinthe Bellerose - Dictionary of Canadian Biography (accessed 2010-01-09)  Political career  In 1861, Bellerose made an attempted entry into politics by running against Louis-Sim√©on Morin for the Quebec Legislative Assembly of Canada constituency of Laval. Two years later, he made another attempt, and this time was successful, winning the constituency with a majority of just 94. He was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1867 elections in the Quebec riding of Laval. A Conservative, he was re-elected in the 1872 elections. He was also elected to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec, and served there on occasion at the same time as serving in the House of Commons of Canada. In 1873, he was appointed to the Senate of Canada representing the senatorial division of De Lanaudi√®re, Quebec. It was due to the insistence of Bellerose that from 1877, the record of debates in the Senate of Canada was translated into French, a reminder of his roots in Quebec. During his political career, Bellerose served in several other roles, including justice of the peace, mayor of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec (at the same time as serving in the federal Senate representing a constituency) and president of the Union Navigation Company. He died in office in 1899, aged seventy-nine years and one month. Bellerose is buried in the Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Quebec parish church vault.

Macy. It was released nationwide in the United States and Canada on March 2, 2007. Plot Doug Madsen (Tim Allen), Woody Stevens (John Travolta), Bobby Davis (Martin Lawrence) and Dudley Frank (William H. Macy) are four middle-aged everymen living in a Cincinnati suburb who find themselves disillusioned with the quality of everyday life and lack of adventure. Doug is a dentist who has trouble bonding with his son Billy (Dominic Janes); Dudley is a single (yet sometimes preoccupied)computer programmer who is afraid to talk to women; Bobby is a henpecked plumber whose wife has made him return to work after having taken a year off to unsuccessfully write a book; and Woody is a wealthy lawyer married to a supermodel. They find escape from their daily routines on weekends by riding motorcycles together posing as a biker gang called the \\"Wild Hogs\\". One day, Woody finds out his wife is divorcing him thus rendering him bankrupt. He convinces his friends to go on a road trip on their bikes to California. After encountering several misadventures, they end up at a local bar, where they meet a rowdy, much larger biker gang called the Del Fuegos, headed by Jack Blade (Ray Liotta). Jack calls the Wild Hogs \\"posers\\" and has his gang steal Dudley's bike after a bogus deal to exchange Dudley's bike for a new bike that is in fact used and derelict, forcing the men to leave with Dudley in a sidecar attached to Woody's bike. Furious at their bullying of Dudley, Woody returns to the Del Fuegos bar and retrieves Dudley's bike, cuts off their bikes' fuel lines in the process and fabricates a story to the other Wild Hogs of how he \\"negotiated\\" with them to return the bike. When the Del Fuegos hear the Wild Hogs riding back past the bar, they attempt to pursue them, only for the bikes to stall. Jack inadvertently drops his lit cigarette onto the ground, igniting the fuel leaking from the bikes which then causes the bar to explode. Woody, after witnessing the explosion from afar, convinces the others to keep riding. Eventually, the Wild Hogs run out of gas and end up stranded in the desert. They eventually push their bikes to Madrid, New Mexico, where they stumble into a diner and help themselves to water and beer without paying. As a result, the townspeople first mistake them for Del Fuegos. When the Wild Hogs explain their actions, they learn that the Del Fuegos have been terrorizing the town frequently, while the local police force are unable to do anything to protect the town. Although Woody is still anxious about the Del Fuegos, the others convince him to stay in the town overnight. During their stay in the town, Dudley falls in love with Maggie (Marisa Tomei), the diner's owner. While out searching for the Wild Hogs, Jack's closest biker members Red and Murdock (Kevin Durand and M. C. Gainey) spot the group and report their location to Jack. Jack tells the pair not to harm the Wild Hogs until he gets there, leaving them unable to fight back when Bobby notices and confronts the pair by splashing beer and spraying ketchup and mustard on their clothes before finally physically attacking Murdock, thus scaring off Red. The Wild Hogs are hailed as heroes amongst the town's residents and celebrate well into the night with the townspeople. The next day, Woody persuades the others that they must leave, but their departure is ruined when the Del Fuegos arrive. Jack threatens to wreck the town unless the Wild Hogs pay for the damage done to their bar. Woody admits to the Wild Hogs what he really did to get Dudley's bike back as well as the real reason for the trip, exasperating the others. Jack and the rest of the Del Fuegos take over Maggie's diner, but when he threatens to burn it, Dudley confronts them and is held hostage. The others attempt to rescue Dudley but fail. They then decide to fight the Del Fuego gang letting Jack, Red, Murdock and a member trained in martial arts \\"Tiny\\" battle the group in a 4 on 4 altercation but the Wild Hogs are beaten severely, but refuse to give up. The townspeople band together to battle the Del Fuegos, but just as Jack threatens to take on the rest of the town, Damien Blade (Peter Fonda), Jack's father and the founder of the Del Fuegos, arrives and stops the fight. Damien lectures Jack for letting four \\"posers\\" hold off an entire biker gang, questioning aloud just which side was the \\"posers\\". He also adds that the bar was merely an insurance scam and therefore was glad that the Wild Hogs destroyed it. Damien tells the Del Fuegos to leave town and ride the open road until they remember what riding is really about, mentioning as he leaves that Jack \\"takes after his mother\\". He then acknowledges the Wild Hogs by telling them his motto: \\"Ride hard, or stay home\\". He also lightheartedly informs the Wild Hogs to \\"lose the watches\\", indicating the watches on their wrists. Doug and Bobby's wives arrive, and Doug reconciles with his son. Bobby's wife orders him to return with her, but he refuses and convinces her to let him finish the ride. The Wild Hogs leave and arrive in Southern California, where everyone except for Dudley crashes into a surfboard. During the credits, it is revealed that the Wild Hogs called Extreme Makeover: Home Edition to give the Del Fuegos a new bar. The Del Fuegos react in joy (while Jack is emotionally speechless) at their new bar while the Wild Hogs watch the event on TV.

Reception =Critical response= Wild Hogs opened on March 2, 2007 to mostly negative reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 14% based on 141 reviews with an average rating of 3.8/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Wild Hogs is a dreadful combination of fish-out-of-water jokes, slapstick, and lazy stereotypes.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 27 out of 100 based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Ty Burr of The Boston Globe compared the film's merits to its titular motorcycles, believing it to be \\"a bumptious weekend ride... the engine could use tuning and the plugs are shot, but it gets you most of the way there.\\" Although writing a negative review, Burr offered praise for the film's final act, believing it \\"takes a satisfying turn\\" and that, with the exception of Allen, each of the film's primary cast members \\"earned his designated chuckle.\\" He also favorably compared the film to RV, another comedy film focusing on a road trip. Wild Hogs Movie Review ‚Äì Wild Hogs Movie Trailer ‚Äì The Boston Globe =Box office= Despite negative reviews, the film grossed $39.7 million on its opening weekend, ranking #1 in box office sales and nearly tripling the debut of fellow opener Zodiac. The film performed well throughout its entire run, falling just 30.5% in its second weekend and ultimately grossing $168.2 million domestically and $253.6 million worldwide, becoming Travolta's first film since The General's Daughter in 1999 to gross over $100 million domestically. =Lawsuit= In March 2007, the Hells Angels filed suit against Walt Disney Motion Pictures Group alleging that the film used both the name and distinctive logo of the Hells Angels Motorcycle Club without permission. That suit resulted in voluntary dismissal. Home media Wild Hogs was released on standard DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 14, 2007. Cancelled sequel Because of the movie's strong box office performance, Disney announced that a sequel, Wild Hogs 2: Bachelor Ride, would be released in 2010. However, after Disney's next comedy starring John Travolta, Old Dogs (which co-starred Robin Williams), was a critical failure, Disney cancelled both Wild Hogs 2: Bachelor Ride and Wedding Banned, a comedy that was to star Williams and Anna Faris.

As initially built the engine shed had twelve \\"roads\\" (tracks) providing facilities for 60 locomotives. The railways at Immingham were worked by the Great Central Railway, the developer of the Port. In 1923 it was taken over by the LNER and then became part of the Eastern Region of British Railways in 1948. During the LNER period (1930s) a concrete automatic coaling stage was added to the facilities. During the British Railways period the facility had a shed code of 40B, reproduced from The Railway Magazine, September 2008 and had two sub-sheds: New Holland and Grimsby. At its peak the shed had an allotment of over 120 locomotives, with 12 stabling roads ‚Äì part of the building was demolished in the 1950s and a diesel depot constructed.

The last steam locomotive worked from the shed was No.61058 (LNER B1) on 7 February 1966, which hauled a train of empty wagons to Markham Colliery. Following the splitting up of the former BR Trainload business into three companies in 1994, the depot came briefly under the control of \\"shadow privatisation company\\" Loadhaul. Loadhaul was acquired and merged into English Welsh & Scottish in 1995. The TOPS depot code for the EWS/DB Schenker depot at Immingham is IM, and for the Freightliner Traction Maintenance Depot at Immingham, IN. As a result of centralisation of maintenance activities by EWS to Toton TMD the shed was used only for storage of out of service locomotives.

His main academic specializations are in Roman-Dutch law, public international law, jurisprudence, human rights, criminal procedure and international criminal law. He has served on the International Law Commission, the primary UN institution for the development of international law, and has been active in reporting on human-rights violations by Israel in the Palestinian territories. He has written several books on apartheid, human rights, and international law, in addition to coauthoring textbooks on criminal law and procedure and international law. He has also written extensively on South African apartheid. Education John Dugard earned his BA (1956) and LLB (1958) degrees at Stellenbosch University (South Africa) and a second LLB (1965) and LL.D. degree, a Diploma in International Law (1965), and an LL.D. Degree (1980), all from Cambridge University. Career =Academic= From 1975‚Äì1977, Dugard was the Dean and a Professor of Law at the University of Witwatersrand (Johannesburg, South Africa). From 1978‚Äì1990, he was the Director of the University of Witwatersrand's Centre for Applied Legal Studies,http://www.law.wits.ac.za/cals \\"a research centre committed to the promotion of Human Rights in South Africa\\". John Dugard Retrieved 27 June 2011 Dugard was Director of the Lauterpacht Centre for International Law at the University of Cambridge from 1995‚Äì1997. In 1998, Dugard was appointed Chair in Public International Law at Leiden University in the Netherlands and as Director of the Advanced LL.M. programme in Public International Law. Since 2006 he has been a Professor of Law at the Centre for Human Rights of the University of Pretoria. He has held visiting professorships at Princeton University, Duke University, UC Berkeley and University of Pennsylvania, and University of New South Wales (Australia). =Other Professional Activities= He has, since 1997, served as a member of the International Law Commission of the United Nations. In 2000, he became its Special Rapporteur on Diplomatic Protection. In 2000, he served as Judge ad hoc in the cases concerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Burundi) (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda) and (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Rwanda) at the International Court of Justice. Dugard visited the Palestine Center in Washington DC in March 2009 and gave a lecture entitled \\"Apartheid and Occupation under International Law.\\" The video and the transcript of the lecture were made available online. United Nations Following the recurrence of the Palestinian intifada in late 2000, John Dugard was appointed as Chairman of a UN Commission on Human Rights inquiry commission on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories. In 2001, he was appointed United Nations Special Rapporteur to the commission on \\"the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since 1967\\". He was charged with submitting annual reports and recommendations to the UN concerning the situation of international human rights and humanitarian law. In its first special session in July 2006, the Human Rights Council dispatched an urgent fact-finding mission headed by Dugard to report on the situation in the Palestinian territories. On 26 September 2006, Dugard reported that the \\"standards of human rights in the Palestinian territories have fallen to intolerable new levels\\".UN says Gaza crisis 'intolerable' BBC News Online, 26 September 2006 Beginning in 2008, he served as Judge ad hoc on the International Court of Justice. Dugard visited the Palestine Center in Washington DC in March 2009 and gave a lecture entitled \\"Apartheid and Occupation under International Law.\\"http://www.20essexst.com He is currently a door tenant at 20 Essex Street Chambers in London, who specialise in Public International Law. =2007 Report= In a report released in February 2007, Dugard stated \\"Israel's laws and practices certainly resemble aspects of apartheid\\" in the occupied Palestinian territory. \\"It is difficult to resist the conclusion that many of Israel's laws and practices violate the 1966 Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination,\\" says the report. Dugard also stated, \\"Discrimination against Palestinians occurs in many fields. Moreover, the 1973 International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid appears to be violated by many practices, particularly those denying freedom of movement to Palestinians.\\"Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, John Dugard, Human Rights Council  Fourth Session, 29 January 2007 Referring to Israel's actions in the occupied West Bank, he wrote, \\"Can it seriously be denied that the purpose [...] is to establish and maintain domination by one racial group (Jews) over another racial group (Palestinians) and systematically oppressing them? Israel denies that this is its intention or purpose. But such an intention or purpose may be inferred from the actions described in this report.\\"McCarthy, Rory. \\"Occupied Gaza like apartheid South Africa, says UN report\\", The Guardian, 23 February 2007. Critics noted that Dugard was appointed in 2001 as an unpaid expert by the UN Human Rights Commission to investigate only violations by the Israeli side. Israel and the U.S. therefore dismissed his reports as one-sided. Israel's UN ambassador in Geneva, Itzhak Levanon, said that \\"Professor Dugard will better serve the cause of peace by ceasing to enflame the hatred between Israelis and Palestinians, who have embarked on serious talks to solve this contentious situation.\\"UN expert: Palestinian terror 'inevitable' result of occupation An Israeli foreign ministry spokesman, Mark Regev, said it was \\"rank politicisation\\" of the UN's human rights apparatus. \\"This is the promoting of partisan, one-sided political attitudes which frankly don't serve the interests of anyone who is seriously interested in human rights.\\"UN envoy hits Israel 'apartheid' Dugard also issued a report in 2008.Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, John Dugard, Human Rights Council  Fifth Session, 21 January 2008. In 2009 he was replaced by American professor of international relations Richard A. Falk. =Other writings on Israel and the Palestinian territories= In an August 2009 article for the Huffington Post, Dugard compared the current situation in the occupied Palestinian territory to South African apartheid. \\"Israel is long overdue\\", he wrote, \\"to undergo the same racial reckoning and transformation that the United States underwent in the 1960s and South Africa passed through in the 1990s\\". He stated that Israeli settlers had two choices: to \\"leave the occupied territories\\" or \\"live under Palestinian law\\". And he declared that \\"Israel must make the choice in the weeks ahead whether it intends to continue ruling over the Palestinians indefinitely or will step back from the dual system of law and apartheid it appears poised to embrace under the leadership of Prime Minister Netanyahu.\\" Dugard also compared Israeli policy in the occupied Palestinian territory to apartheid in South Africa in a November 2011 article for Al Jazeera. While acknowledging some distinctions between the two systems, he said that \\"in practice, there is little difference\\", with both regimes being \\"characterized by discrimination, repression and territorial fragmentation (that is, land seizures).\\" He said that Israel's \\"confiscation of Palestinian farms under the pretext of building a security wall\\" was reminiscent of South African actions against blacks, and argued that \\"Israel has gone beyond apartheid South Africa in constructing separate (and unequal) roads for Palestinians and settlers\\". He also claimed that Israeli security forces, like the South African Security Police, \\"practiced torture on a large scale\\". In a 2012 paper, Dugard reiterated his comparison of Israel and South Africa. \\"Israel does not recognize those who engage in resistance activities, either as combatants or as protesters, as 'political' prisoners as this would confer legitimacy on the cause that motivates them\\", wrote Dugard. \\"Instead they are termed ordinary criminals, security prisoners or, most frequently, 'terrorists.' South Africa too sought to denigrate its political prisoners in this way\\". He further maintained that \\"more Palestinians have been killed in targeted assassinations of combatants [by Israel] than were judicially executed in South Africa\\". He concluded that \\"However cruel and inhuman the conditions of Palestinian prisoners, however unfair the trials that sent them to prison, and however demeaning their characterization as 'criminals' or 'terrorists,' we should not forget that Palestinian prisoners are the fortunate ones. For they were not murdered by a regime that murders political opponents under the euphemism of 'targeted assassinations.'\\" In a September 2012 article, he declared that Britain, as the original \\"Mandatory Power\\" governing what is now Israel under a League of Nations mandate, had violated a \\"sacred\\" obligation to Palestinians by supporting Israel over the decades and that the \\"jury is still out on the question whether Israel acted in self-defence or as an aggressor\\" in the Six-Day War. \\"Sadly Britain has done little to protect the human rights of the Palestinian people or to advance their independence\\", Dugard wrote. While questioning the legality of the 1947 UN resolution establishing Israel, he argued for the legitimacy of Palestine as a state, noting that it is a member of the League of Arab States and of UNESCO and that \\"between 120 and 130 states have recognised the state of Palestine in some way or another\\". Dugard was one of 52 international figures who signed a 2012 letter calling for a military embargo against Israel on the eve of the International Day of Solidarity with the People of Palestine. Among the other signatories were Nobel Peace laureates Mairead Maguire and Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel, performer Roger Waters, filmmakers Mike Leigh and Ken Loach, and authors Alice Walker and Naomi Klein. Citing \\"Israel's unchecked belligerence\\" and \\"subjugation of Palestinians\\", the letter argued that \\"Israel's attempt to justify [the] illegal use of belligerent and disproportionate military force as 'self- defence' does not stand up to legal - or moral - scrutiny, as states cannot invoke self-defence for acts that serve to defend an unlawful situation which they have created in the first place\\". Criticism of Dugard The Anti- Defamation League (ADL) called on U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour in 2004 to remove Dugard from the position of U.N. Special Rapporteur for Human Rights, for his \\"clearly demonstrated bias against the State of Israel\\". The ADL cited Dugard's report, \\"Question of the violation of human rights in the occupied Arab territories, including Palestine\\", in which, according to the ADL, he \\"presents personal convictions as fact, and goes well beyond reporting to an incendiary call for action by the international community against Israel\\". While \\"Dugard comprehensively presents as fact alleged Israeli human rights abuses against the Palestinians\\", charged the ADL, his report made \\"little to no mention of Palestinian involvement in terrorism against Israel, of Palestinian arms smuggling tunnels, or rocket attacks against Israeli towns\\". UN Watch criticized Dugard in 2006, protesting his appointment to lead a \\"fact-finding mission...on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories\\". Dugard's reports, complained UN Watch, \\"stand out, even by UN standards, for their virulently anti-Israel prejudice. Not only does Dugard systematically ignore Palestinian acts of terror and their victims, but he has gone so far as to laud Palestinian 'militarized groups armed with rifles, mortars, and Kassam-2 rockets [who] confront the [Israeli army] with new determination, daring, and success.'\\" Also, while \\"many UN figures...like to lambaste Israel\\", Dugard is \\"the only appointee of the UN who regularly rails against the UN-sponsored Quartet and its Road Map for Middle East Peace\\". Citing Dugard's statement about the recent capture by Hamas of Israeli Corporal Gilad Shalit, in which Dugard expressed sympathy \\"for all Israel's young soldiers compelled to serve in the army of an occupying power\\", UN Watch commented that \\"Dugard could not bring himself to express sympathy for the captured soldier without wrapping it in a sharp stab, drenched with cynicism, at Israel's morality. We've seen nothing to suggest Corporal Shalit has felt anything other than patriotic about his service\\". UN Watch further noted that while Dugard had criticized the use of the death penalty by the Palestinian Authority against Palestinian convicts, he had never made reference in his reports to \\"the terror faced daily by Israeli civilians\\" and \\"the attempted mega-terror attacks against Israeli skyscrapers, ports and fuel depots\\". Memberships He is a member of the Institut de Droit International. Since 1997 he has been a member of the UN International Law Commission. He is a member of the Crimes Against Humanity Initiative Advisory Council, a project of the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis to establish the world's first treaty on the prevention and punishment of crimes against humanity. Honors and awards John Dugard has honorary doctorates of law from the University of Cape Town, University of Natal, University of Port Elizabeth, University of Pretoria and the University of the Witwatersrand. In April 2012, he received one of South Africa's highest civilian honors, the Order of the Baobab: Gold, in a ceremony conducted by President Jacob Zuma.

It was founded in the United States by several Silicon Valley entrepreneurs in 2001. The organization principally caters to entrepreneurial business leaders, aiming to promote policies that support and encourage prosperity through entrepreneurship and innovation. Most of the Lead21 senior staff, board of directors and membership reportedly have very close connections to the Republican Party and many Republican administrations (especially Arnold Schwarzenegger's administration in California, and the Bush Administration). Lead21 reports having a multi-partisan donor and membership base, including Democratic members, with no \\"political litmus test\\" for membership. Like many right-of-center think tanks, it has no partisanship requirement, but is rooted in traditional conservative- and libertarian- leaning values such as limited government, lower taxes, and pro-market policies. Lead21 was conceived on August 18, 2001, by Auren Hoffman and Price Roe, and shortly after founded with the additions of entrepreneurs Christopher Alden, F. John Duncan, and Rob Reid. According to the organization's official website, some of these early founders served as senior appointees in the George W. Bush Administration. Lead21 executive director Daniel Trimble was the organization's first full-time employee, hired at the start of 2006, followed by a Program Manager and Press Secretary, Candace d'Holbach, in 2007. History Lead21 was founded by a group of entrepreneurs, investors and senior executives from San Francisco and the surrounding Silicon Valley region. New Century Leadership Council (NCLC), as it was called at the time, launched the new organization at the home of Silicon Valley veteran Ellen Hancock, with former California Governor Pete Wilson as guest-of-honor. Additional early members and supporting leaders included E. Floyd Kvamme (chairman of the U.S. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), Thomas Stephenson of Sequoia Capital fame, Gregory Slayton (a notable Bush-Cheney 2004 fundraiser and currently the Ambassador to Bermuda under George W. Bush's administration), and Duf Sundheim (chairman of the California Republican Party 2003-2007). According to news and press reports from the time, more than 150 people showed up for the opening event. NCLC was said to have started as a venue for conservatives and libertarians, whom the group claimed were politically quiet in the San Francisco Bay Area‚Äîa region widely considered to be overtly liberal. Lead21 bills itself as \\"multi- partisan\\" in its membership demographic (which reportedly includes Republicans, Independents, Libertarians, and Democrats), but mostly appears to support Republicans and Libertarians as their platform of limited government, lower taxes, and pro-business policies tend to be embraced by those political bases. Lead21 explicitly states that its focus is not about partisan politics; that it is about supporting entrepreneurship and innovation. However, the organization does not appear to have supported any Democratic candidates or campaigns except California Governor Gavin Newsom. Lead21 has hosted Mayor Newsom, and several board members of the organization as well as several of its top members have been appointed to San Francisco city commissions. It is widely noted that Newsom's election win against Matt Gonzalez in the contest for San Francisco mayor in 2003 is often attributed to direct Republican turnout in his support. In 2003, NCLC changed its name to Lead21. Lead21 claims it grew to several hundred members in its first few years after its founding, with no budget or staff. In 2004, Lead21 hired Sally Dorfman as a paid, part-time staffer to coordinate its increasingly routine events and bookkeeping. It was not until February 2006 that it hired its first full-time director, Daniel Trimble, who with the Board and Program Manager, Candace d'Holbach, led the organization through its most explosive growth in terms of membership and revenue. Trimble resigned in April 2007. Growth In July 2006, director Daniel Trimble stated at a Lead21 reception with General Charles G. Boyd (former Deputy Commander-in-Chief of United States European Command (USEUCOM) that the organization has no marketing budget, and that its growth has been fueled almost entirely by word of mouth from its membership. In August 2006, Lead21 declared it was on the verge of surpassing 1,000 members and alumni, and in Fall of 2006 announced it had reached that mark. Lead21 does not make its full membership roster available to the public, however, it does list most of its \\"Presidential Members\\" and donors on its website. Legal status Lead21 is a not-for-profit membership association filed in California, and is registered as a political organization under section 527 of U.S. tax and election laws. Lead21 is reportedly not a fundraising organization that raises money for candidates, committees or campaigns, and as such has never registered as a federal or state political action committee. As of September 2006, Lead21 reports it is in the process of re-filing, for legal status as a combination 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) educational research and issue advocacy organization. Funding Lead21 has received most of its funding from its own membership, and reportedly has become largely self-sustaining based on annual membership contributions. According to Lead21's official website, it has received financial support from the following \\"major donors\\" among its \\"Chairman's Circle.\\" It is not known publicly how much these individuals have contributed: *William H.

Davis and Squier Edwin Davis was born in 1811 in Hillsboro, Ohio, just a few miles from Chillicothe and the many mounds and earthworks of the Scioto River valley. Seeing these features as a young man inspired his deep curiosity about them. At the time, archaeology had not developed as an academic discipline. Davis explored the mounds while a student at Kenyon College and wrote a paper on the subject which he read at his commencement. Daniel Webster, an early member of the American Antiquarian Society, heard the paper and encouraged Davis to continue his research. After graduating from medical college and establishing a practice in Chillicothe, Davis used his free time to continue his explorations. He collected artifacts he discovered in and around the mounds. Ephraim Squier, ten years younger than Davis, was born in Bethlehem, New York in 1821. By the time he arrived in Chillicothe in 1845 as the editor of the weekly Scioto Gazette newspaper, he had received training in civil engineering, education and journalism. Squier was intrigued by the numerous prehistoric monuments in the surrounding area. His questioning local residents about them failed to provide much insight. With his characteristic ambition, Squier decided to \\"take the compass and chain in one hand and the mattock and spade in the other\\" and begin his own research.Squier, Davis, Meltzer, Introduction, p.6. When the two men encountered one another, they formed a collaboration based on Davis' knowledge of the Scioto Valley sites and growing collection of artifacts, combined with Squier's knowledge of surveying and writing. Their joint personal interests soon became a formal project. Project scope This map of Serpent Mound is one of many in Ancient Monuments surveyed and sketched by Squier and Davis. Ancient Monuments provides descriptions of sites across much of the Eastern United States, as the title indicates. The hundreds of earthworks which Squier and Davis personally surveyed and sketched were located primarily in and around Ross County in southern Ohio. This area includes Serpent Mound, Fort Ancient, Mound City and Seip Earthworks (both now part of Hopewell Culture National Historical Park), and Newark Earthworks. All their Kentucky sites were taken from the manuscripts of the late C. S. Rafinesque. James McBride, John Locke and Charles Whittlesey, among others, contributed additional first-hand reports, but the scope of Squier and Davis' own work was unprecedented. A major part of Squier and Davis' achievement was their classification of sites according to apparent function, such as burial grounds, effigies, fortifications, and building foundations. They sometimes were limited by their preconceptions about the cultures which they described. Their observation and descriptive skills often exceeded the quality of the records they made regarding excavation methods and recovery techniques. Contributions to knowledge Ancient Monuments was edited by the physicist Joseph Henry, the first Secretary of the Smithsonian, who wanted a worthy initial volume for the Institution's Contributions to Knowledge series. Henry knew that the first book's reception would be important for both the Smithsonian and for American science. His choosing a book devoted to the mound builders was risky, as their origin, history and identity were then the subject of much debate and literature but little scientific investigation. In addition, the subject touched on issues of race, religion, and the still raw tensions between Native Americans and ethnic European settlers. Knowing that both anthropology and archaeology were relatively new fields of study, Henry sought to minimize Squier and Davis' speculation about the origins and purposes of the works they had surveyed and sketched. He emphasized the scientific presentation of their findings. The work clearly communicates the view‚Äîcommonly held at the time‚Äîthat the earthworks had been created by a race separate from and superior to contemporary Native American populations. When the book was published, Squier and Davis' work immediately became a milestone in a still-developing field. Established then as a primary source on the subject of the mound builders, it retains that position because of the breadth of its coverage. Re-issue A 150th anniversary paperback edition of Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley was published by the Smithsonian in 1998. The extensive introduction was written by David J. Meltzer, professor of anthropology at Southern Methodist University. References * Ephraim G. Squier, Edwin H. Davis, David J. Meltzer (Editor). (Paperback Re-issue, 1998).

A businessman with interests in financial services, entertainment, and media, and an estimated net worth of $2.8 billion, he is ranked by Forbes as the 232nd richest person in America. Saban is the founder of Saban Entertainment, producer and distributor of children's television programs in the US such as Power Rangers. He headed up consortiums which purchased the broadcasters ProSiebenSat.1 Media and Univision Communications. He is a major donor to the US Democratic Party and active in pro-Israel political efforts in the US. In March 2017, Saban was honored with the 2,605th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his achievements in television. Life Saban was born in Alexandria, Egypt, to an Egyptian-Jewish family. In 1956, the Saban family immigrated to Israel, along with most of the Egyptian Jewish community. Saban was sent to a Youth Aliyah boarding school. Expelled for being a troublemaker, he enrolled in a night high school where the principal told him: \\"You're not cut out for academic studies; you're cut out for making money.\\" He served as a soldier in the Israel Defense Forces.http://www.themarker.com/magazine/MAGAZINE-1.3113715 Saban is married to Cheryl Lynn (Flor) Saban, with whom he has two children. He also has two stepchildren, Tifanie and Heidi Lenhart, an actress. He resides in Beverly Hills, California.\\"Haim Saban\\". Forbes. Retrieved May 31, 2014 Music career  Saban started his career in 1966 as a bass player and manager with the rock band The Lions of Judah (Ha'arayot), which was named after the Lion of Judah in Jewish Scripture. In 1969, Dave Watts from the British band The Tornados joined The Lions. That year, the band traveled to England, performed in night clubs in London and was signed up by Polydor Records. In July 1969, the band appeared on the BBC TV programme Colour Me Pop. The Lions recorded a single, \\"Our Love's A Growing Thing\\", but it was not released in the UK due to financial difficulties. The band returned to Israel and Saban focused on being a music promoter. In the early 1970s, Saban moved to France where he worked as a music producer. His clients included Noam Kaniel, Mike Brant and Shuki & Aviva. He also launched a record company with Shuki Levy. In 1978 and 1982, Saban used the pseudonym Kussa for music/lyrics writing credits on four records for which he also served as producer using his real name. Since then, he has frequently used the name Kussa Mahchi for his composing credits on Saban Entertainment productions, including the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie theme song. In 2019, Saban announced that he had formed the Saban Music Group backed by $500 million of his own capital. The company will focus on global artists, particular Latin American, tapping new artists and acquiring existing businesses.Haim Saban returning to his roots in music with new company Haaretz Business career =Saban Entertainment= In the United States, he became a television producer, founding Saban Entertainment in 1988. During that time, Haim Saban and partner Shuki Levy became known for soundtrack compositions for children's television programs of the 1980s. Although Levy and Saban composed for their own properties (such as Kidd Video and Maple Town), they scored for other production companies as well (such as Inspector Gadget, The Mysterious Cities of Gold, M.A.S.K., Dinosaucers, Dragon Quest, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, She-Ra: Princess of Power, and Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors). In 1998, The Hollywood Reporter reported that he did not actually compose all the music (totalling 3,700 works in 2008) he is credited for; ten composers threatened to sue and Saban settled out of court. In the 1990s, Saban's company became known for the production of Power Rangers, Masked Rider, VR Troopers and Big Bad Beetleborgs, which were Western adaptations of Japanese tokusatsu shows. =Fox Family= In 1996, News Corporation's Fox Children's Productions and Haim Saban's Saban Entertainment merged to form Fox Kids Worldwide. Also in that year, the joint venture purchased the C&D; library from Jean Chalopin. With the growing shift in children's television from over-the-air programming blocks to cable channels such as Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, the two companies sought to launch a competitor that would carry programming from the popular Fox Kids lineup. Eying The Family Channel, News Corp. made an offer to purchase IFE through the joint venture in 1997. On July 23, 2001, Saban announced that he and News Corporation would sell Fox Family Worldwide Inc for $5.3 billion to The Walt Disney Company. and on October 24, 2001, the sale was completed and the network was renamed ABC Family. Saban profited about $1.6 billion from this sale. =ProSiebenSat.1= In August 2003, Saban led a consortium, which acquired a controlling stake in the straggling ProSiebenSat.1 Media group from the Kirch Media Group, the then-bankrupt German media conglomerate. ProSiebenSat.1, is Germany's largest commercial television broadcasting company, which owns five German TV channels, including ProSieben and SAT.1, two of the top three stations in Germany. Collectively, ProSiebenSat.1's channels represented approximately 45% of the German TV advertising market at the time. Saban's ProSiebenSat.1 acquisition was the first time a foreigner took control of a significant German Media company. Saban oversaw a successful business turnaround of ProSiebenSat.1, recruiting former business rivals, ex- BSkyB chief executive Tony Ball and former BBC Director General Greg Dyke to the board of the company. In March 2007, Saban Capital Group and the consortium sold its controlling interest in ProSiebenSat.1 to KKR and Permira, for 22.40 euros a share after originally paying 7.5 euros per share in 2003. =Univision= On June 27, 2006, Saban Capital Group led a group of investors bidding for Univision Communications, the largest Spanish-language media company in the United States. Other investors in the Saban-led group were Texas Pacific Group of Fort Worth, Texas and Thomas H. Lee Partners. The group was successful in acquiring Univision with a bid valued at $13.7 billion (USD). Views and opinions  Saban, a long-time supporter and donor of many pro-Jewish and Israel causes, has stated his main goal in multiple interviews: \\"I'm a one-issue guy, and my issue is Israel.\\" Saban became involved in politics in the mid-1990s when he felt that support for Israel was slipping in the United States. He says his views have shifted over the years: \\"I used to be a real leftist. I remember Arik Sharon [the leader of Israel's right-wing Likud Party] coming here, to my house, a few months before Camp David, when he was still leader of the opposition. He told me there would be no deal because [Yassir] Arafat would not sign. I told myself that there was nothing to be done ‚Äì these right-wingers were simply insane. I had no doubt that there would be a deal and the problems would be resolved. History proved that Sharon was right and I was wrong. In matters relating to security, that moved me to the right. Very far to the right...When there is a terrorist attack, I am [Avigdor] Lieberman. Sometimes to the right of Lieberman. For two days I really love Lieberman. But afterward I come back to reality. Look, I don't see a solution today.\\" Saban has been a consistent donor to the United States Democratic Party according to his mandatory Federal Election Commission filings. Mother Jones, in an analysis of the major donors to the campaigns of 1998 election cycle, ranked Saban 155th among individual donors. Amy Paris noted that Saban's Clinton-era \\"generosity did not go unrewarded. During the Clinton administration, the entertainment executive served on the President's Export Council, advising the White House on trade issues.\\" The New York Times reported that Haim and his wife \\"slept in the White House several times during President Clinton's two terms.\\" Saban remains close friends with the former President. Clinton described Saban as a \\"very good friend and supporter.\\" Saban contributed between $5 million to $10 million to the William J. Clinton Foundation. During the 2000 presidential election, Saban increased his rank to 5th among individual donors with a combined contribution of $1,250,500. Matthew Yglesias wrote that \\"Saban was the largest overall contributor to the Democratic National Committee during the 2001‚Äì2002 cycle.\\" Saban's donations during that 2001‚Äì2002 period exceeded $10 million, the largest donation the DNC has received from a single source up to that time. In September 2004, Hillary Clinton described Saban as a very good friend, supporter and adviser: \\"I am grateful for his commitment to Israel, to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East and to my foundation's work, particularly on reconciliation issues.\\" In May 2007, Haim publicly declared his support for Clinton in 2008 presidential election. In June 2007, Saban and Steven Spielberg co-hosted a Hillary Clinton fundraiser at the house of Peter Chernin, the President of News Corporation. According to the Los Angeles Times, the fundraiser brought in over $850,000. In March 2008, Saban was among a group of major Jewish donors to sign a letter to Democratic Party house leader Nancy Pelosi advising her not to run in the Democratic presidential primaries. The donors were upset by Pelosi's statement that the party 'superdelegates' should heed the will of the majority in selecting a candidate.\\" The donors, who were strong supporters of the DCCC, implied that Pelosi could lose their financial support in upcoming congressional elections. In May 2008, it was reported that Haim Saban had offered $1 million to the Young Democrats of America and urged the endorsement of Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee for president.\\" Saban has also made donations to members of the Republican Party including a 2003 contribution to George W. Bush's 2004 re-election campaign. Saban supported Hillary Clinton for President of the United States in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Between June 2015 and June 2016, he and his wife donated US$7 million to Priorities USA, a pro-Clinton Super PAC. Meanwhile, Saban has called Republican candidate Donald Trump \\"a danger to America\\". Saban has said that Keith Ellison, who ran for the leadership of the DNC, \\"is clearly an anti-Semite and anti-Israel individual.\\" Saban also called Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \\"an anti-Israel person.\\"Haim Saban's confidence in Hillary Clinton, BY Danielle Berrin, Jewish Journal, Jun 1, 2016. In 2006, Saban discussed his views on the Middle East and Persian Gulf region in an interview with Haaretz. Commenting on Iran, he said: \\"When I see Ahmadinejad, I see Hitler. They speak the same language. His motivation is also clear: the return of the Mahdi is a supreme goal. And for a religious person of deep self-persuasion, that supreme goal is worth the liquidation of five and a half million Jews. We cannot allow ourselves that. Nuclear weapons in the hands of a religious leadership that is convinced that the annihilation of Israel will bring about the emergence of a new Muslim caliphate? Israel cannot allow that. This is no game. It's truly an existential danger.\\"\\"Haim Saban\\" The Atlantic, June 10, 2007. If Obama strikes a \\"bad deal\\" with Iran that would put Israel at risk, \\"I would bomb the living daylights out of these sons of bitches,\\" Saban said at a meeting of the Israeli American Council. In 2005, Saban spent $100,000 to oppose California's 2005 Proposition 77 redistricting reform. Saban contributed $100,000 to pass California's 2008 redistricting reform, Proposition 11, which created a Citizens Redistricting Commission to redraw California's state political boundaries, but not U.S. Congressional districts. Saban contributed $2,000,000 to support Proposition 27, California's proposed 2010 repeal of Proposition 11, the 2008 redistricting reform ‚Äì the same reform that Haim Saban previously supported with a $100,000 contribution. He joined list of other well-connected, big-money donors to the Democratic Party in supporting Proposition 27. Philanthropy =Saban Center for Middle East Policy= Saban with U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Martin Indyk, Washington, D.C., December 7, 2014 In 2002 Saban provided an initial grant of 13 million USD and a pledge of additional funds to create the Saban Center for Middle East Policy, a foreign policy think tank based in Washington, D.C.. The Saban Center is part of the larger Brookings Institution think tank. The Saban Center aims to provide policy makers in government with information and analysis regarding America's foreign policy in the Middle East. Saban recruited Martin Indyk to direct the center. In 2007, Saban donated $14 million to complete the children's hospital at Soroka Medical Center. =Saban National Political Leadership Training Seminar= Saban sponsors the American- Israel Public Affairs Committee's Saban National Political Leadership Training Seminar, a series of semiannual seminars in Washington to provide college student activists for three days of intensive pro-Israel advocacy training.Peace Now The seminars provide up to 300 students from a hundred campuses with training in order to \\"prepare for challenges and opportunities on their campuses and [the students] left Washington prepared to mobilize for legislative and electoral impact during the next school year and into campaign '08.\\"AIPAC Among the prominent figures to have addressed the seminars are Senator Evan Bayh and Congressman Mark Kirk and academics David Makovsky, Robert Satloff and Dennis Ross.

Media Vision was widely known for its Pro AudioSpectrum PC sound cards‚Äîwhich it often bundled with CD-ROM drives‚Äîand its spectacular growth and demise. Company history Media Vision was founded in May 1990 by Paul Jain and Tim Bratton. Early employees also included Russ Faust, Michael Humphries, Dan Gochnauer, Bryan Colvin and Doug Cody, all from Jain's prior company, Video-7. As Bratton recalls, he wrote the company's business plan while an engineer at National Semiconductor based on Jain's vision of evolving multimedia from VGA to audio and video. Jain raised substantial funding, based on a business plan on a single sheet of paper, from top VCs such as Brentwood, Nazem, 3i and others. Within its first two years of operation, Media Vision had become the second-largest producer of personal computer sound cards, providing strong competition to Creative Labs. It was the first company to offer a multimedia CD ROM kit (single-speed CD ROM drive from Sony and Media Vision sound card with an included CD Rom with games and a multimedia version of Compton's encyclopedia) at Fry's Electronics, the well known retailer, where manufacturers routinely tested sales of their new products. Media Vision's kits priced at US$1999 sold out within hours. All the larger computer companies such as Microsoft, Apple and others were the primary initial buyers according to Fry's Electronics. In 1992, Media Vision was the first company to publish Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions on CD-ROM; having beaten Microsoft to market with its own product, Bill Gates's assistant telephoned and ordered two copies. During the same year, the company acquired Pellucid, Inc., a computer graphics company, and began producing a line of high- performance video graphics cards for the PC. Media Vision became a publicly traded company in late 1992. Jain oversaw the development of several multimedia chips because he quickly realized that the audio board business would morph into audio chips on PC motherboards. Media Vision developed three complex chips such as a 16-bit accelerator chip, an FM synthesis chip and a Mixed Signal DSP. =New logotype and new image= Media Vision logotype (1990‚Äì1993) In 1993, Media Vision updated its logotype to reflect its expanding product lines and broad foray into technologies beyond computer audio. Perhaps one of the biggest endeavors was the company's leap into software publishing with the creation of its Multimedia Publishing Group. CD- ROM titles such as Critical Path, Quantum Gate, and Forever Growing Garden were often bundled with its multimedia kits. The new logo reflected the company's desire to be known as a cutting-edge multimedia technology company. During the same year, the company expanded business operations into Europe with the establishment of Media Vision GmbH in Munich, Germany. =Financial scandal= Media Vision could not sustain its rise. On May 17, 1994, CEO Paul Jain stepped down as Media Vision quickly became the subject of the longest- running securities fraud case in Silicon Valley history. The investigation and trial lasted nearly a decade, resulting in criminal charges filed against Jain in 1998 and his unsuccessful indictment on 27 counts of financial fraud and judgments against Jain and CFO Steve Allen. Judge Jenkins, who oversaw the case, allowed only two counts of \\"wire fraud\\" against Jain, and in conjunction with the US attorney's office, dismissed all the other charges. Jain was represented by Michael Chertoff. Jain maintained that he was set up while other senior officers of the company tried to cover a US$6 million revenue shortfall. He fought the DOJ for ten years and only pleaded guilty because during this period, Jain had two little children and did not want to endanger his health and financial resources, in a continuing battle with the DOJ. In the end, Jain served a few months at a federal camp and subsequently founded four companies in developing multimedia products. The collapse of Media Vision cost investors and bond holders US$200 million. This loss was in large part created by the class-action lawsuit in which the beneficiaries were lawyers and short sellers. Jain himself lost over US$40 million in the decreased value of his shares of Media Vision. Jain sold less than 10% of his share holdings during Media Vision's life according to the auditor's reports. Media Vision ultimately became Aureal Semiconductor. When the company changed its name to Aureal, it sold all product lines, key technologies, and trademarks related to the old Media Vision to SVT Shiva, Inc. (SVTI) of San Jose, California. SVTI then created a new division called Media Vision Innovations, Inc. to sell existing inventory. It is suspected that Bob Brownell, who conspired to become Media Vision's CEO and forced Jain out, along with his VP of sales Steve Cason, were beneficiaries of selling this inventory at 25% of the cost. The new division also developed and sold a few new multimedia products under the Media Vision name. SVTI agreed to purchase audio chips from Aureal for the first two years as part of the deal. Products Media Vision's products included PC adapter cards, other hardware, and computer games. =PC adapter cards= LMSI * Pro Audio Spectrum (1991): 8-bit ISA audio card with CD-ROM interface * Pro Audio Spectrum Plus: ISA audio card, 8-bit digital sampling, 16-bit digital audio playback with CD-ROM interface, Sound Blaster compatibility. * Pro Audio Spectrum 16 (May 1992): 16-bit ISA card with CD-ROM interface, 16-bit stereo digital audio, stereo FM synthesis, Sound Blaster compatibility; based on the MVD101 chipset. * Thunder Board: low-cost 8-bit ISA Sound Blaster compatible sound. * Thunder and Lightning: VGA adapter with Sound Blaster compatible sound. * PCMCIA 16 Bit Sound Card * Pro Audio Studio 16: enhanced version of the Pro Audio Spectrum 16 sound card, bundled with voice-recognition software and a microphone * Pro Audio 16 Basic: Stripped down version of Pro Audio Spectrum 16, without SCSI interface, the bundled voice recognition software and microphone; based on the MVD101 chipset. * Pro Sonic 16: Based on Media Vision's JAZZ 16 chipset (not compatible with the Pro Audio Spectrum line). * Pro 3-D: Based on Media Vision's JAZZ 16 chipset (not compatible with the Pro Audio Spectrum line), with built-in SRS surround sound, and KORG wavetable daughter board. * ProZonic: Released in 1996 by Media Vision Innovations, Inc. * Pro Movie Spectrum/Studio (1993): a realtime video capture board, ISA card, Video1 hardware video codec * Pro Graphics 1024: high-performance video card * Pro Graphics 1280: high-performance video card =Other hardware= * multimedia kits, each bundling a Pro Audio Spectrum sound card, CD-ROM drive and software * Audio Port (March 1992): parallel/printer port audio device for laptop computers * CDPC: integrated desktop CD-ROM, audio I/O, amplified speakers * Memphis: enhanced version of the CDPC * ReNO: portable CD-ROM/CD Audio device * Pro Audio Spectrum Patch Panel for the Apple Macintosh =Software= * Critical Path * Quantum Gate * Forever Growing Garden * PlanIt Adrenaline * PlanIt Earth Internal structure Internally, Media Vision was dominated by its large engineering and marketing departments, roughly equal in size and reporting to the Chief Operating Officer Russell Faust.

The group was founded in 1992 by Xavier Boyer, Pedro Resende, M√©d√©ric Gontier and Sylvain Marchand. History Singer and guitarist Boyer and bassist Resende formed the pop combo as students at the University of Rouen. Taking their name from a souvenir t-shirt given to Boyer's father in 1980, the duo recruited guitarist Mederic Gontier, and with the addition of drummer Sylvain Marchand a year later, the lineup was complete. The foursome released a self-produced and self-financed EP, \\"20 Minutes\\" which resulted in them signing a deal with French label Atmospheriques. In 1998, the band flew to New York City to record their first album Puzzle with Andy Chase. Featuring contributions from Eric Matthews and Adam Schlesinger, Puzzle was mixed in Sweden by Tore Johansson. Puzzle received a gold certification from the RIAJ in December 2000. Tahiti 80's U.S. label, Minty Fresh, released a mini LP called Extra Pieces, which included B-sides, remixes and other rarities. In 2001, the band re-united with Andy Chase to record a more experimental follow up album, Wallpaper for the Soul. The sessions took place in Rouen, New York City, √âtretat, London. and Portland, Oregon. The album was mixed by Tony Lash and arranged by Richard Anthony Hewson. Wallpaper for the Soul was released in 2002, garnered positive reviews. Following that, Xavier Boyer selected songs for a compilation called \\"A Piece of Gold\\" on behalf of the band. Featuring Todd Rundgren, Small Faces, and Donald Byrd, it was only released in Japan. For their third album, from 2003‚Äì2004, Tahiti 80 spent several months at their own recording studio, the Tahitilab. The songs were mostly improvised and written in the studio, and collaborated with Neal Pogue and Serban Ghenea. British singer Linda Lewis also appeared as a guest artist on \\"Your Love Shines\\". \\"Better Days Will Come\\" was featured in the first episode of the fourth season of Smallville in September, 2004. In 2007, the band transferred to Barclay and in 2008, they returned to the Tahitilab to record Activity Center. It was described by critics as a back to basics album, with a rawer sound and a rock production style. Drums were subsequently played by Julien Barbagallo with percussion by Raphael Leger. During winter and early spring 2010, Tahiti 80 recorded their fifth album, The Past, The Present & The Possible. The album was released in early 2011. In 2012, Barbagallo left Tahiti 80 to join Tame Impala, with multi-instrumentalist Hadrien Grange of Parisian pop group Dorian Pimpernel replacing him. In 2014, Tahiti 80 released Ballroom, their sixth album which was co-produced by Richard Swift.

The depot is owned by DB Cargo UK. The depot was originally of service to steam locomotives (shed code 12A). The depot code is now CL. The old steam shed used to be known colloquially as \\"the Lanky\\", a reference to its origins as the main depot of the Lancaster and Carlisle railway.  History  Constructed by the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway, the depot passed into London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) ownership as part of the 1923 Grouping. The LMS rebuilt Upperby in 1948, replacing the original shed with a large concrete roundhouse. The LMS also constructed an enginemen's hostel on the hill adjacent to the depot (now the Hilltop Hotel).Chris Hawkins, George Reeve (1981) LMS Engine Sheds Vol 1 the L&NWR; In the 1960s, Upperby was allocated diesel locomotives including Sulzer Type 2 (later Class 25) and the unsuccessful Metro-Vic Co-Bo Type 2. However, once the new purpose-built diesel depot, Kingmoor TMD was completed, work was transferred there and Upperby closed as a locomotive depot on 1 January 1968.Peter W. Robinson, \\"Rail Centres: Carlisle\\" Ian Allan Ltd, 1986. The roundhouse was demolished in 1979, but the remaining buildings continued in use as a carriage maintenance and servicing facility until closure in the early 1990s. When British Rail was privatised in 1994‚Äì7, the disused depot became the property of EWS (now DB Cargo UK) as part of a nationwide portfolio of sites which also included the nearby Currock wagon repair depot.  Present day  Upperby is no longer an operational depot, although some sidings are still present and used to store redundant wagons. Part of the land formerly making up the site is now used by Network Rail for office space and storage of equipment. The former carriage shed was demolished in December 2016.

Photograph by Hank Graber. Anthony McCall (born 1946) is a British-born New York based artist known for his ‚Äòsolid-light‚Äô installations, a series that he began in 1973 with \\"Line Describing a Cone,\\" in which a volumetric form composed of projected light slowly evolves in three-dimensional space. Occupying a space between cinema, sculpture, and drawing, his work's historical importance has been recognised in such exhibitions as \\"Into the Light: the Projected Image in American Art 1964‚Äì77,‚Äù Whitney Museum of American Art (2001‚Äì02); \\"The Expanded Screen: Actions and Installations of the Sixties and Seventies,‚Äù Museum Moderner Kunst, Vienna (2003‚Äì04); \\"The Expanded Eye,\\" Kunsthaus Zurich (2006); \\"Beyond Cinema: the Art of Projection,‚Äù Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin (2006‚Äì07); \\"The Cinema Effect: Illusion, Reality and the Projected Image,‚Äù Hirshhorn Museum, Washington DC (2008); and \\"On Line: Drawing Through the Twentieth Century,‚Äù Museum of Modern Art (2010‚Äì11). Career McCall studied graphic design and photography at Ravensbourne College of Art and Design, Bromley, Kent, England from 1964 to 1968. McCall was a key figure in the avant-garde London Film-makers Co-operative in the 1970s. His earliest films are documents of outdoor performances that were notable for their minimal use of the elements, most notably fire.[1] After moving to New York in 1973, McCall continued his fire performances and developed his 'solid light' film series, beginning with Line Describing a Cone, in 1973. Based on simple, animated line-drawings, these projections strikingly emphasise the sculptural qualities of a beam of light. In darkened, haze-filled rooms, the projections create an illusion of three-dimensional shapes, ellipses, waves and flat planes that gradually expand, contract or sweep through space. In these works, the artist sought to deconstruct cinema by reducing film to its principle components of time and light and removing the screen entirely as the prescribed surface for projection. The works also shift the relationship of the audience to film, as viewers become participants, their bodies intersecting and modifying the transitory forms. At the end of the 1970s, McCall withdrew from making art. Some twenty years later, he acquired a new dynamic and re-opened his 'solid light' series, this time using digital animation and digital projection rather than 16mm film.[1] The first of the new works, \\"Doubling Back\\" (2003) was exhibited at the 2004 Whitney Biennial. McCall developed the use of a slow-moving cinematic ‚Äòwipe‚Äô to combine and separate two opposing forms within one volumetric object; the new works also explored the extended cyclical ‚Äòinstallation‚Äô structure that he had first developed in the film-based work of the seventies. New installations included \\"You and I, Horizontal\\" (2006), \\"Leaving, with Two-Minute Silence\\" (2009), and \\"Face to Face\\" (2013). Anthony McCall. \\"Between You and I\\" (2006). Installation view, Peer/The Round Chapel, London, 2006. Photograph by Hugo Glendinning. McCall also developed a parallel series of vertically oriented works, starting with \\"Breath\\" (2004) in which a projector mounted on the ceiling projects directly downwards onto the floor, creating a ten-metre-tall, tent-like, almost architectural enclosure with a 4-metre wide base. Other vertical works included \\"Between You and I\\" (2006), \\"Meeting You Halfway\\" (2009), and \\"Coupling\\" (2009). The first survey exhibition of McCall's work in an international institution took place at the Serpentine Gallery London, in 2007-8. This included early performance films, horizontal solid light works, and works on paper. The vertical works were first exhibited as a solo show (\\"Breath: The Vertical Works‚Äù) at Hangar Bicocca, Milan in 2009. The horizontal and vertical works were combined in a solo show at Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin (\\"Five Minutes of Pure Sculpture\\") in 2012. McCall has recently embarked on a new series, which use slanting beams, projected from ceiling-to-floor at a 45-degree angle. Originating from two widely separated projectors mounted on the ceiling, the beams converge at the floor, creating a single, superimposed ‚Äòfootprint‚Äô. Works include \\"Coming About\\" (2016) and the four-projector installation, \\"Crossing\\" (2016).

She initially serves as an antagonist, but joins the protagonist Mario after he helps her. In the original Japanese release and in European translations, she is a transgender woman, while the script in English releases was altered to portray her as a cisgender woman. Vivian has been called one of the best LGBTQ characters in video games, but the way the Japanese version of the game depicts her and her gender identity has received some criticism. Concept and creation Vivian is a purple, ghost-like person with pink hair, white gloves, and a pink-and-white striped hat, while her two older sisters Beldam and Marilyn wear blue and yellow hats respectively. She is able to hide herself and others in shadows and can manipulate flames. Vivian is a transgender woman, and is mocked by Beldam, who misgenders her and calls her a cross-dresser. When Paper Mario: The Thousand- Year Door was localized to English and German, Vivian's status as a trans woman was changed to that of a cisgender woman, and the transphobia from her sister was changed to insults about her appearance. In non-English/German localizations of the game, Vivian is still transgender. The Italian version, in particular, emphasizes her status as a trans woman by having Vivian express pride in having transitioned; she pushes back against her sister's bullying by saying \\"I'm proud to have turned into a woman!\\" In the Japanese version of Super Paper Mario, Vivian's collectible card describes her using the term, \\"otoko no ko\\" a term used for male crossdressers, implying that Vivian was originally intended to be male in Japan.inu651225 (2010-10-23), „Çπ„Éº„Éë„Éº„Éö„Éº„Éë„Éº„Éû„É™„Ç™ ÂÖ®„Ç´„Éº„ÉâÈõÜÔΩõ„Éç„Çø„Å∞„ÇåÊ≥®ÊÑèÔΩù, retrieved 2019-03-10 Appearances Vivian first appears in the 2004 role-playing video game Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. She initially works against the protagonist Mario and his allies as part of the Shadow Sirens, a group consisting of her and her two sisters Beldam and Marilyn, the former of whom routinely abuses her. She assists Mario when he helps her find a missing object, unaware of his actual identity. When she discovers who he is, she is initially reluctant to help him further, but decides to join him due to the abuse she suffered from her sister and the kindness Mario showed her. By the end of the story, Beldam vows to treat her better. She appears in a cameo role in the sequel, Super Paper Mario, both as a collectible card and as a plush doll owned by a character. She also appears as a collectible in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Reception Vivian has received mostly positive reception since her appearance in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. Nintendojo writer Mel Turnquist included Vivian's decision to stay by Mario's side as one of their most inspiring moments in video games due in part to also being a younger sibling herself. Liberty Voice called Vivian's defection from her sisters to Mario's side relatable to children. Inverse included Vivian in a series where they discuss potential Super Smash Bros. inclusions, expressing hope that she is included instead of a more traditional choice like Paper Mario. She has received particular attention for her status as a transgender character. IGN included Vivian in their list of favorite LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and others) characters. They praised Vivian for not being defined by her status as a trans person, though expressed disappointment in the change from trans woman to cis woman in the English releases due to Vivian being one of few quality trans characters in video games. Drag queen Daphne J. Sumtimez listed Vivian as one of her idols. In their essay on transgender characters, authors Emil Christenson and Danielle Un√©us discuss Vivian and how her femininity is designed. They mention Vivian's bent wrists and frequent smiling as feminine qualities that she typically displays. They also bring up the pink color of her hat, noting that the contrast between her sisters may be intentional to heighten her femininity. They acknowledge the transphobia Vivian receives, but comment that it is depicted negatively due to her sisters being villains. Author Nicholas Taylor includes her in a section on transgender characters in the book Queerness in Play, discussing how Vivian's role in the narrative can help players understand their experiences with gender, identity, and expression. Some critics were displeased with how Vivian's gender was presented in the Japanese version, however. VG247 felt that Vivian's gender identity was expressed in a transphobic fashion. Writer Laura Kate Dale was critical of dialogue in the game that stated she was at one time male, feeling it suggested she was not truly female. In their breakdown of LGBTQ+ representation in video games, writers Quincy Nolan and Ian Laih-Nolan included Vivian, similarly criticizing the language used in the Japanese version to describe her but noting that it does not take away from her \\"gender-bending presence.\\" Vivian has been compared to fellow trans Nintendo character Birdo, who is similarly misgendered in some games and had her trans identity removed in English localizations.

His first feature, Donovan's Echo, was released in 2012. Early life Cliffe was born in British Columbia, Canada. He showed strong artistic skills at an early age, and developed his first newspaper published comic strip with his brother Jason at the age of 11. As a kid, Jim's love of movies were often a creative driving force with his art. He also experimented with animation, and made video shorts with his friends, mimicking stunts and sequences from some of his favorite movies. Career Professionally, Jim's career has primarily been in the arts - illustration, design and animation - as the idea of becoming a movie director didn‚Äôt really seem like a tangible goal to him. In 2005, Jim's first professional short film noir Tomorrow's Memoir gained attention after winning 'Best Comics-Oriented Film' at the San Diego Comic-Con. At 27-minutes in length, Tomorrow's Memoir screened at several festivals, and would also go on to become an online hit within the comic community following its launch on the now retired ifilm. The short film also garnered rave reviews from Film Threat, DC Comics, Moviehole, and others. In 2007, Jim's first feature-length screenplay, 'Donovan‚Äôs Echo' (co-written by Cliffe and his wife Melodie Krieger) won the Bronze Award in the PAGE International Screenwriting Awards and made quarter-finalist in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Nicholl Fellowships in Screenwriting. Donovan's Echo went into production in late 2010 on a modest budget of \\"around $3M\\", with Cliffe attached as director. Starring Danny Glover and Bruce Greenwood, the movie premiered in Sudbury, Ontario's Cin√©fest in September 2011, and was the opening film at the Calgary International Film Festival that same month. Donovan's Echo had a limited theatrical release across Canada in February, 2012. The Toronto Film Scene's William Brownridge wrote, \\"With such an interesting mystery, great performances, and themes of hope and acceptance, Donovan's Echo is a great debut for Jim Cliffe\\". Similarly, David Voigt of The Toronto Examiner added in his review, \\"For a debut feature, Cliffe shows real skill as a solid storyteller with an eye for casting as well.\\" Donovan's Echo was released on DVD, Blu-ray and digital download in Canada in September 2012 by Anchor Bay Entertainment, and will be coming to the U.S. in May 2013. Cliffe and his wife Melodie are currently writing new projects, including one with an extraterrestrial theme, inspired by the events of Roswell and Project Blue Book.

The film also details the attempts by the United States government under President Richard Nixon to silence him. The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival and its North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. It was released in New York City and Los Angeles, California on 15 September 2006, and had a nationwide release on 29 September. A soundtrack composed of John Lennon tracks was released by Capitol Records and EMI on 26 September 2006. The film makes extensive use of archival footage of Lennon and Yoko Ono, and includes an interview conducted by anti-war reporter Gloria Emerson.Lions Gate tunes in Lennon documentary, Daily Variety, September 2, 2005. The U.K. release was on December 8, 2006, 26 years to the day after the death of John Lennon. The DVD was released on February 13, 2007 in the United States. The film made its cable television debut in the U.S. on August 18, 2007 on VH1 Classic. Synopsis The film explores the political activism that Lennon became strongly involved in with the Beatles, and after the band ended. John Lennon is established as being a potential political threat to the American government, and therefore much of the film covers the theme of 'silencing' him and other popular figures that became involved in anti-war activism. Throughout the film the audience can see both sides of the situation: the audience sees the protests and events Lennon and Yoko Ono organised, such as the famous \\"Give Peace a Chance\\" rally and concepts such as bagism and bed peace. We also see the increasing fear experienced by the US government and CIA. This build-up of paranoia and fear for control led to the eventual deportation notice sent to John Lennon's house, informing him that 'his temporary stay in the USA was now over'. The film debunks and exposes the somewhat bizarre behaviour of the CIA and police department over John Lennon and other contemporary figures' behaviour, referring also to different modern issues like drug abuse. The film features a montage of various mediums. There are videos of performances of songs and interviews of Lennon at the time, recordings of Yoko Ono both present and from the late 1960s and 1970s, as well as a basic story structure of retelling the story of John Lennon's attempts to spread a message of peace around the United States and, on a wider scale, the entire Western world during the Vietnam War. The DVD \\"Extras\\" contain a further 54 minutes of interview segments within ten topic sections, the highlight with Yoko Ono reading her letter written in 2000, to the Parole Board, whom at the time were considering the case of Mark David Chapman.

She served in the Russian Pacific Fleet and was sunk by a Russian naval mine near the entrance to Port Arthur, Manchuria, just after the start of the Russo- Japanese War in 1904. History A contract to build four second-rank protected cruisers to reinforce the Russian Pacific Fleet was issued by the Marine Ministry on 15 April 1899. It was intended that these ships be built in Danzig to the design of the cruiser for reconnaissance, aviso and destroyer support duties. However, due to political pressure from the throne, the contract for the Boyarin was issued to the Danish firm of Burmeister & Wain (the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorvna was from Denmark). This created numerous issues. The cost of the Boyarin was far higher than expected, due to higher wages in Denmark and need for the shipyard to import many components. Changes made to the design resulted in problems with stability, and efforts to compensate by increasing her displacement from 2600 tons to 3075 tons resulted in a lower speed. Despite the increase in displacement, she was inferior to Novik in ammunition storage, the number of naval mines and layout of the bridge. The keel was laid of 24 September 1900, with Commander V I Litvinov appointed chief equipping officer. She was launched on 26 May 1901 without any presence of the Imperial Russian Navy during the ceremony ‚Äì a breach of tradition and etiquette. After launching, Commander Vladimir Fedorovich Sarychev, former captain of the gunboat Gilyak, who had just returned from the Boxer Rebellion in China, was appointed captain. During factory acceptance testing in June 1902, severe vibrations revealed that the practical operational speed was only 14 knots. =Armament= The main armament consisted of six Canet guns in shielded mountings, one each at the bow and stern and four in sponsons. Anti-torpedo boat armament consisted of eight 47 mm guns, four in the bow and stern casemates and four in midship sponsons. Five torpedo tubes with 11 torpedoes were placed one on the stern and two on each side, all above water. =Protection= The armour used was Krupp plate, on the deck and on the conning tower. =Machinery= The powerplant consisted of two shafts with triple expansion steam engines and 16 Belleville-type boilers. Operational record Boyarin arrived in Kronstadt on 6 October 1902, and Commander Sarychev was formally placed in command. On 8 October she was included in the Russian Pacific Fleet reinforcement squadron under the command of Admiral Baron Stackelberg, but broke down and had to be repaired in Denmark on the way. Upon rejoining the squadron on 19 November at Isle of Portland in England, Commander Sarychev reported to local authorities that his chief engineer had died of gunshot wounds. After passing through the Suez Canal, Boyarin was assigned to detached duty in a show of force in the Persian Gulf to reinforce Russian political interests and influence. This angered the British government, which refused to permit coaling rights at any British port, and the Russian government was forced to request that a French collier based in Djibouti escort Boyarin through the Indian Ocean. Boyarin reached Port Arthur on 13 May 1902. Djibouti 1902. Cattle destined for Boyarin She was assigned to maneuvers with the First Pacific Squadron in the Yellow Sea, followed in June by maneuvers in the Pacific Ocean. In August she participated in several training exercises. Viceroy Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev praised her in his reports to Petrograd for her utility and low consumption of coal. With the increasing diplomatic tension between the Empire of Japan and Russia, Boyarin was deployed to Chemulpo (now Incheon) in Korea in December 1903 to safeguard Russian interests. She was relieved by the arrival of the on 30 December 1903 and returned to Port Arthur. =Battle of Port Arthur= On the night of 8 February 1904, in the Battle of Port Arthur, the opening battle of the Russo-Japanese War, Imperial Japanese Navy destroyers launched a pre- emptive strike on the First Pacific Squadron anchored in the roadstead outside Port Arthur. Admiral Oskar Stark sent a squadron that included Boyarin in pursuit, but it succeeded only in attacking a Russian destroyer heading into port before returning to Port Arthur. Several hours later a fleet of Japanese ships was observed to be approaching, and Boyarin was deployed on the outer roadstead. The fleet was Admiral Togo Heihachiro‚Äôs main battle fleet with six battleships and nine cruisers. Boyarin fired three shots at the fleet before fleeing back into the protection of Port Arthur and raising the alarm. That evening, Boyarin received orders to escort the minelayer Yenisei to Talienwan on the west side of Port Arthur to complete laying of the last minefields. On Yenisei struck one of her own mines, exploded, and sank. Inexperienced shore- based observers panicked and reported another attack by Japanese destroyers, and Boyarin was dispatched with four Russian destroyers to investigate. The cruiser also struck a mine laid by Yenisei, at 0816 on. The explosion killed ten crew members, and she sank up to her portholes. Although efforts were made to patch the breach she began to list, and Commander Sarychev gave the order to abandon ship. That evening, a team from Port Arthur found her grounded near the shoreline, evidently with repairable damage. However, she drifted during a storm that night, striking at least one other mine, and sank. Several days later, the wreckage was discovered on the bottom around from the shoreline and further attempts at salvage were discontinued. Sarychev was found guilty at a court-martial of premature abandonment of the damaged vessel, and spent the remainder of the siege of Port Arthur on shore duty.

Cheat sheets are so named because they may be used by students without the instructor's knowledge to cheat on a test. However, at higher levels of education where rote memorization is not as important as in basic education, students may be permitted to consult their own notes (crib notes, or crib sheet) during the exam (which is not considered cheating). The act of preparing a crib sheet can be an educational exercise, and students are sometimes only allowed to use crib sheets they have written themselves. A cheat sheet is a physical piece of paper, often filled with equations and/or facts in compressed writing. Students often print cheat sheets in extremely small font, fitting an entire page of notes in the palm of their hands during the exam. Crib sheets are also fully worked solutions for exams or work sheets normally handed out to university staff in order to ease marking (grading). As reference cards In more general usage, a crib sheet is any short (one- or two-page) reference to terms, commands, or symbols where the user is expected to understand the use of such terms but not necessarily to have memorized all of them. Many computer applications, for example, have crib sheets included in their documentation, which list keystrokes or menu commands needed to achieve specific tasks to save the user the effort of digging through an entire manual to find the keystroke needed to, for example, move between two windows. An example of such a crib sheet is one for the GIMP photo editing software. Other examples include \\"Read Me First\\" and \\"Quick Reference Card\\" documents included with consumer electronics. Some academic and technical publishers also publish crib sheets for software packages and technical topics. In some cases these are also intended as display items in that they are colorful and visually appealing.

Baxter competed in women's bodybuilding from 1979 to 1986, competing in four IFBB Ms. Olympia competitions between 1982 and 1985. She was inspirational for many up-and-coming female bodybuilders, especially those who desired a physique that would be large and muscular even by bodybuilding standards. She was a groundbreaker in making wrestling videos and short action movies that catered to fans of women's bodybuilding. Baxter also trained and dated singer David Lee Roth. The early female bodybuilders already had been groundbreakers, as they had been muscular athletes, usually in track or gymnastics, at a time when neither muscularity nor sports were encouraged for young girls. Baxter had been a collegiate gymnast at Kent State University and was still quite well muscled when taking up bodybuilding in her mid-30s. She competed in some of the earliest prominent women's bodybuilding contests. The first major mainstream article on the sport, \\"Here She Is, Miss, Well, What?\\" in the March 17, 1980 Sports Illustrated opened with full page shots of Cammie Lusko and Baxter doing rear double biceps shots. A full-body shot of Baxter doing a front double biceps pose was on the inside page. At the time, Baxter weighed around 120 pounds for contests at 5-3. In 1982, Muscle & Fitness ran a three- page photo feature on different types of female bodybuilding physiques‚ÄîShelly Gruwell with the long, lean physique most like a model; Rachel McLish epitomizing the muscular, average framed woman; Baxter with the more muscular than average (for a bodybuilder) but still graceful build (she was posed with right leg extended, squatting on the left leg); 5-1 Mary Roberts with the short, thick, powerful build. Yet even as that issue hit the stands, Baxter was training with legendary male bodybuilder Don \\"The Ripper\\" Ross with the goal of redefining the outer limits of female bodybuilder muscularity. She later admitted to taking some steroids during this period. She and Ross expected at the 1982 Ms. Olympia, she would finish either first or last. Baxter's clothed entrance into the host hotel lobby at that Olympia has become legendary among longtime bodybuilding fans. Reg Bradford, in his contest coverage for BodyPower magazine, called her \\"massive with a capital M\\" and declared it was apparent \\"Lindsay Wagner had been imitating The Bionic Woman on television\\" for here was a true superwoman in the flesh. In a posthumous interview published by Female Bodybuilding and Weight Training, Baxter claimed a competitor came up to her in tears, saying, \\"That's not what a female bodybuilder should look like!\\" Muscle & Fitness' contest coverage estimated Baxter gained 8 pounds of muscle, an amazing amount back then for a 5-3 female bodybuilder. As a matter of fact, Baxter weighed in at 129. By modern standards, she would be a good-sized light heavyweight in a class competition. Back then, only Carla Dunlap rivaled Baxter's combination of size and definition. The Women's Physique Publication reported that the IFBB circulated a memo among the judges, admonishing them not to reward \\"uncontrolled muscularity.\\" Baxter would finish eighth, but immediately gained a devoted legion of followers among fans and more than a few competitors. Unlike many women then and now, Baxter was a complete bodybuilder. She boasted superior size in almost every bodypart. Though an H-frame with broad shoulders and hips with a thick waist, the kind of build perfect for powerlifting more so than bodybuilding, she simply gave herself a V-shape by building incredibly massive latissimus dorsi muscles and huge deltoids. Her legs would be admired for their tremendous mass and shape, although she sometimes had trouble getting them defined for contests. Standing next to Baxter onstage wasn't the desired position for many competitors. She would dominate an observer's eye and her completeness highlighted the weaknesses of those around her. In addition to her physique, she had a very 1980s-ish shock of big blond hair that also demanded attention and a certain middle-aged sex appeal now connected to so- called \\"cougars.\\" Baxter also understood that one of the things that drew bodybuilding fans to the sport/activity were the physiques of seemingly superhuman size, seeming to symbolize superhuman strength and will. Superhero comic books had been filled with bodybuilding ads since the 1960s. She figured women's bodybuilding fans were no different and she herself declared to Muscle & Fitness in 1983 \\"I want to be superwoman!\\" She made a wrestling video with her taking on another of bodybuilding's most muscular women, Pillow, and in an interview published posthumously by Flex Magazine, stated she liked it because they \\"looked like two superwomen fighting.\\" In the just dawning age of common VCR usage, Baxter sold tapes of her wrestling Pillow or men. (Bodybuilding world gossip has it that Baxter was such a physical woman, she'd playfully put friends in leg scissors to see if they could escape or last before giving up). Though judges continued to place her lower and lower at subsequent Olympias and Women's World Championships, Baxter continued to get bigger, denser and even more defined. In one of the posthumous interviews, she said, \\"The judges weren't the ones buying my videos\\" so she might as well keep pleasing herself and the fans. It's been theorized that fear of those videos reaching mainstream media and making women's bodybuilding, then struggling for mainstream acceptance much more than even today, something practiced by women the average person couldn't relate to at all also was behind the low contest placings that kept Baxter out of the mainstream. The low point for Baxter in this regard probably was the 1984 Ms. Olympia, when she wasn't placed in the top 15 during prejudging and, therefore, couldn't compete in the night show. Several competitors told Women's Physique World and other magazines they were shocked by this placing and felt bad for Kay, who was competing at 138-140 pounds by this point at a size that would be huge by standards of 10 years hence. Still, her fans loved her with a devotion no other female bodybuilder could claim. She was voted \\"The Best Woman Bodybuilder in the World\\" by readers of the Women's Physique Publication, a mail-order only magazine whose readers and editors tended to favor the more heavily muscled bodybuilders, each year from 1982-84. Women's Physique World, a color newsstand sister to WPP that began in 1984, featured her on their first Back Page (a shot of a female bodybuilder from the back) and made her the coverwoman of an issue that devoted a few articles to her. Strength Training for Beauty, a magazine aimed at bodybuilders and fans who appreciated both muscle and sexy attire/makeup, had Baxter in several issues. In the first WPP announcing she had been voted \\"Best Bodybuilder in the World,\\" Baxter wondered if bodybuilding needed to be split into two contests‚Äîa more mainstream-palatable level of bodybuilding and Ultimate Bodybuilding, which would reward high levels of denied size. Several years later, as fitness contests featuring muscular women less muscular than bodybuilders and doing routines that featured more dancing than look-at-my- muscles posing, Baxter seemed a prophet. From 1982-85, Baxter was the benchmark for hugely muscled female bodybuilders. The 1985 Worlds, however, was the last competition at which fans would marvel at the awesomeness of her physique while judges would buried her in the results. The latter still happened, not so much the former. The bar was moving in women's bodybuilding as bigger girls such as 5-7, 145-pound Deanna Panting, 5-4, 145-pound Hannie Van Aken and 5-5, 155-pound Peggy Ouwerling were taking the \\"Big Girl\\" baton from Kay, whose influence they often acknowledged. \\"Someone had to stick her neck out for the cause of muscular women ‚Ä¶ and I've got no regrets about that... not one\\", she said. One of her catchphrases was \\"Get built without guilt\\". Baxter died in a car crash in 1988 just as her career was moving towards acting. The Women's Extravaganza, an event that featured a bodybuilding contest and a strength competition, was renamed for her in 1990. She was inducted into the IFBB Hall of Fame in 2001.

Dodge, Jr. (July 29, 1891 - November 26, 1968) was a Bureau of Investigation agent in the early 1920s who had an affair with Imogene Remus, the wife of millionaire bootlegger George Remus. Franklin L. Dodge, Jr. was born in Lansing, Michigan in 1891. His father, Franklin L. Dodge, Sr. was a prominent lawyer and businessman who served two terms as a representative in the Michigan State Legislature and made several unsuccessful bids for higher office as a Democrat. Dodge, Jr. joined the Bureau of Investigation, forerunner of today's F.B.I. While an agent, Dodge was credited for the investigation that led to the conviction of the \\"Savannah Four\\", a ring of bootleggers led by Willie Haar. He proceeded to conduct an undercover investigation of the corrupt practices of Albert Sartain, warden of the Atlanta Federal Prison, who was removed and convicted. It was during this investigation that he met George Remus, a millionaire bootlegger from Cincinnati who had entered the Atlanta Federal Prison in 1924. Soon after, Dodge resigned from the Bureau and began an affair with Remus' wife Imogene, who had been given power of attorney to manage Remus' many holdings. Dodge convinced Imogene to begin liquidating her husband's assets and hide as much money as possible. They also sold Remus's huge Fleischmann distillery, and gave Remus only $100 of the multimillion-dollar empire he created. To protect themselves, they then tried to have Remus deported. When that failed, they paid a hitman $15,000 to kill Remus, which also failed.Haunted Cincinnati and Southwest Ohio by Jeff Morris, Michael A. Morris; Arcadia Publishing, 2009 The controversy became public when Congressman Fiorello La Guardia, a fierce opponent of Prohibition, detailed records of these transactions on the floor of Congress in March 1926 as an example of how bootlegging profits were corrupting law enforcement. In October 1927, six months after he was released from prison, Remus shot Imogene to death in broad daylight in a Cincinnati park. During the murder trial, Remus defended himself by making Dodge and his deceased wife the villains of the tragedy and secured his acquittal by reason of temporary insanity. Now outside the public eye, Dodge lived the rest of his life in Michigan, where he worked for the Michigan Liquor Control Commission after the end of Prohibition. He eventually married. He died in 1968 and is buried in Lansing, Michigan. References Sources *Brown, Dorothy M. Mabel Walker Willebrandt: A Study of Power, Loyalty, and Law.

The Class 507 EMUs were far more regularly seen at the depot until its final years of use when the Class 508s began to be used interchangeably with the Wirral Line. A Class 936 departmental train, used for Sandite and de-icing duties, was often stabled in the shed. The depot was taken out of use in 1997; from then on all stock on the Northern Line was serviced at Kirkdale or Birkenhead North depots. Some of the tracks to the depot and the local signal were removed during summer 2006. Demolition A Plan had been drawn up by the 502 Group to use Hall Road TMD As a base for their train and for her restoration. However, the building had become unsafe and was demolished in April 2009. Nothing remains of the depot as of 2013.

Originally discovered by the Romanian bacteriologist Victor Babe»ô, over 100 species of Babesia have since been identified. Babesia comprises more than 100 species of tick-borne parasites that infect erythrocytes (red blood cells) in many vertebrate hosts. Babesia species infect livestock worldwide, wild and domestic vertebrate animals, and occasionally humans, where they cause the disease babesiosis. In the United States, B. microti is the most common strain of the few which have been documented to cause disease in humans.  Classification  B. bovis transmission Babesia is a protozoan parasite found to infect vertebrate animals, mostly livestock mammals and birds, but also occasionally humans. Common names of the disease that Babesia microti causes are Texas cattle fever, redwater fever, tick fever, and Nantucket fever. The disease it causes in humans, babesiosis, is also called piroplasmosis. Due to historical misclassifications, the protozoan Babesia microti has been labeled with many names, including Nuttallia; the microbiological community changed the name Babesia microti to Theileria microti based on evidence from 2006. The sequence published in 2012 shows that the species belongs to neither Babesia nor Theileria, but instead to a separate genus. Another \\"western\\" group is also separate from core Babesia. The avian Babesia species are characterized as having ring and amoeboid forms, and fan-shaped or cruciform (cross-shaped) tetrad schizonts. Developing parasites have only been reported in red blood cells.  History  For centuries, the animal disease was known to be a serious illness for wild and domesticated animals, especially cattle. In 1888, Victor Babe»ô first identified the causative agent in Romania and believed it to be due to the bacterium he named Haematococcus bovis. He documented the disease by describing signs of a severe hemolytic illness seen uniquely in cattle and sheep. In 1893, Americans Theobald Smith and Fred Kilborne identified the parasite as the cause of Texas cattle fever, the same disease described by Babe»ô. They also identified the tick as the transmitting agent, a discovery which first introduced the concept of arthropods functioning as disease vectors. It was believed to be a disease that only affected nonhuman mammals, but in 1957, the first case of babesiosis was seen in a human. The person had been splenectomized, as were all people diagnosed with babesiosis until 1969, when the first case of babesiosis was diagnosed in a person who still had their spleen. This proved the parasite was a potential pathogen in anyone.  Genetics  Babesia show host specificity, allowing many different subspecies of Babesia to emerge, each infecting a different kind of vertebrate organism. While B. bovis and Babesia bigemina prefer to infect cattle in tropical environments, they can infect other animals, such as the white-tailed deer. Therefore, while the organism has the capacity to display host specificity, and thus increase transmission effectiveness, it can still infect a variety of hosts. It achieves this through mutations and natural selection. In different environments, individual protozoa may develop mutations which, when they increase the protozoa's fitness, allow the population to increase their numbers. This specificity explains why Babesia have such great genetic diversity. Babesia selfishly persists long-term in the host's system: the host gains no benefit from the parasite invasion and only suffers. This allows the parasite to exploit all resources offered by the host, to increase in number, and to increase the rate of transmission. Too lethal an infection results in the host¬¥s death and the parasite is unable to spread, which is a loss from an evolutionary standpoint. Different species of Babesia are able to withstand the stress of the host's immune system. Infection typically stimulates the innate immune system, and not the humoral immune system. This results in control of the infection, but also persistence and not clearance of the parasite. =Genomics= The genome of B. microti has been sequenced and shows that the species does not belong to either Babesia or Theileria, but instead to a separate genus. , it is known that the mitochondrial genome is linear like other sequenced Apicomplexa mitochondrial genomes, although it was initially reported that it was circular. Partial RNA sequencing of canine piroplasms has identified a number of additional species.  Life cycle  The life cycle of B. microti, which is typical of parasites in the genus, requires a biological stage in a rodent or deer host. It is transmitted by ticks of the family Ixodidae between these hosts. To begin, the tick as the definitive host becomes infected itself, as it takes up gametocytes when attached for a blood meal. It also introduces the Babesia into the intermediate host (e.g. cattle) when taking a blood meal. As Babesia enter the animal¬¥s red blood cells (erythrocytes), they are called sporozoites. Within the red blood cell, the protozoa become cyclical and develop into a trophozoite ring. The trophozoites moult into merozoites, which have a tetrad structure coined a Maltese-cross form. Trophozoite and merozoite growth ruptures the host erythrocyte, leading to the release of vermicules, the infectious parasitic bodies, which rapidly spread the protozoa throughout the blood. Rather than producing more and more trophozoites, some of the merozoites produce gametocytes. The gametes are fertilized in the tick gut and develop into sporozoites in the salivary glands. These are the sporozoites the infected tick introduces when it bites an intermediate host. Even as an incidental host, the phase changes which occur in the parasite are the same within humans as in the biological hosts. Babesia can be diagnosed at the trophozoite stage, and can also be transmitted from human to human through the tick vector, through blood transfusions, or through congenital transmission (an infected mother to her baby). Life cycle of Babesia Seasonality =Temperature= Cold weather completely interrupts transmission. The emergence of tick-borne diseases has been found to coincide with climate change. The correlation between climate change and the incidence of tick-borne diseases is not known to be strong enough to count as a major factor. =Humidity= High humidity and rainfall accommodate ticks carrying Babesia. This may explain why B. bigemina infection in cattle in the hilly region of Meghalaya has increased. The life span and number of generations of Babesia microplus correlate with increasing the longevity of larvae and the number of annual generations. Warm, dry weather interferes with the Babesia life cycle within the tick. Warm, wet weather increases the intensity of infestation‚Äîthe population is able to thrive due to the relatively fluid environment making water and nutrients more accessible.  Transmission  Babesia species are spread through the saliva of a tick when it bites. Already at its nymphal stage, a tick bites into the skin for a blood meal. The tick, if not removed, stays attached for three to four days, with longer periods of feeding associated with a higher probability of acquiring the parasite. The parasite can survive in the tick as it molts through its various developmental stages, resulting in all tick stages being potentially infectious. Some species of Babesia can be transmitted from a female tick to its offspring before migrating to salivary glands for feeding. B. microti, the most common species in humans, has not been shown to transmit transovarially. Ticks of domestic animals that transmit Babesia and cause much disease include the very widespread cattle ticks, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, and R.(B.) decoloratus. These ticks have a strict one-host feeding cycle on cattle, so the Babesia can only be transmitted by the transovarial route. In the Americas, Ixodes scapularis is the most common vector. This hard tick, commonly known as a deer tick, is also the vector for other tick-associated illnesses, such as Lyme disease. Many species of Babesia only infect nonhuman mammalian hosts, most commonly cattle, horses, and sheep. B. microti and B. divergens are the two main pathogenic species in humans. Their reservoirs are theorized to be the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), voles from the Microtus genus, and the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). These woodland species are hypothesized reservoirs because although they are known to harbor the disease, complete reservoir competence has not yet been shown. Most cases of transmission between humans are attributed to a tick vector. As of 2003, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged more than 40 cases of babesiosis contracted from transfusions of packed red blood cells (PRBC), as well as two infections documented from organ transplantation. PRBC transfusions that cause infections were identified through testing the blood donor for B. microti antibodies. The occurrence of Babesia transmission through PRBC blood transfusions puts pressure on governmental organizations (such as the CDC) to heighten standard measures for screening blood donations. Transmission is also possible through congenital transmission (from an infected mother to her baby). As symptoms may not appear, many women may not be aware they are infected during pregnancy, and therefore a measurement of congenital transmission rate is not known at this time. Currently, no vectors for avian Babesia have been identified, but they are assumed to be ticks. Babesia species require competent vertebrate and invertebrate hosts to maintain transmission cycles.  Epidemiology  Of the species to infect humans, B. microti is most common in the Americas, whereas B. divergens is the predominant strain found in Europe. Endemic areas are regions of tick habitat, including the forest regions of the northeastern United States and temperate regions of Europe. Ixodidae, the tick vectors of B. microti, also transmit the better-known Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. For reasons that remain unclear, in areas endemic to both Lyme disease and babesiosis, Lyme disease transmission prevails and is more predominant in the region. Prevalence of babesiosis in malaria-endemic regions remains unknown due to the likelihood of misdiagnosis as malaria. As the disease results in a high number of asymptomatic individuals, many populations can possess high seroprevalence without much documentation of illness. For example, in Rhode Island and Nantucket, seroprevalence has been measured to be 20‚Äì25%. Prevalence of babesiosis is mostly documented during the months of May to September, when tick activity in endemic regions is high. There are 15 avian species of Babesia, and four Babesia have been reported from sea hosts. Babesia poelea was described from brown boobies (Sula leucogaster) on Sand Island, Johnston Atoll, Central Pacific. B. poelea was reported from a masked booby (Sula dactylatra melanops) from Desnoeufs Island, Amirantes, Seychelles. Babesia peircei has been observed in 2 species of penguins, the jackass penguin (Sphenicus demersus) from South Africa and the little penguin (Eduyptula minor) from southern Australia. Babesia bennetti was associated from the yellow-legged gull (Larus cachinnans) from Benidorm Island off the coast of Spain. Babesia uriae was found in common murres in California. About 40 cases of human babesiosis, caused by intraerythrocytic protozoans (protozoa inside red blood cells) of the genus Babesia, were reported in Europe. Disease Bovine babesiosis caused by B. bovis is an important constraint for cattle industries worldwide. =In humans = Signs of infection with B. microti usually arise one to eight weeks after a bite from an infectious tick. Infections from B. divergens have a shorter latent period, usually ranging from one to three weeks. The severity of B. microti infections varies. For 25% of cases in adults and 50% of cases in children, the disease is asymptomatic or mild with flu-like symptoms. In other cases, symptoms are characterized by irregular fevers, chills, headaches, general lethargy, pain, and malaise. In severe cases effects of parasitic multiplication, symptoms like hemolytic anemia, jaundice, shortness of breath, and hemoglobinuria have been documented. Individuals with normal immune function and healthy spleens often recover without treatment. Splenectomized patients are more susceptible to contracting the disease and can die within five to eight days of symptom onset. They suffer from severe hemolytic anemia, and occasional hepatomegaly has been documented. Parasitemia levels can reach up to 85% in patients without spleens, compared to 1‚Äì10% in individuals with spleens and effective immune systems. Complications include acute respiratory failure, congestive heart failure, and kidney failure. Infections can be fatal in 5‚Äì10% of hospitalized patients, with increased risk of death in the immunosuppressed, the elderly, and those also infected with Lyme disease. B. divergens infections have a much higher fatality rate (42%) and present with more severe symptoms. Infected individuals suffer from hemoglobinuria followed by jaundice, a persistently high fever, chills, and sweats. If left untreated, B. divergens infections can develop into shock-like symptoms with pulmonary edema and kidney failure. In birds The pathogenicity of B. uriae for murres is currently unknown. Birds were found with lesions, anemia and respiratory difficulty, and tissues of avian hosts were affected. Babesia peircei infections can cause mild anemia, leukocytosis, and impairment of hepatic function in African penguins. = Diagnostic tests = As a protozoan parasite, the most effective way to identify Babesia infection is through blood sample testing.  Morphology  Babesia species enter red blood cells (erythrocytes) at the sporozoite stage. Within the red blood cell, the protozoa become cyclical and develop into a trophozoite ring. The trophozoites moult into merozoites, which have a tetrad structure coined a Maltese-cross form. This tetrad morphology seen with Giemsa staining of a thin blood smear is unique to Babesia, and distinguishes it from Plasmodium falciparum, a protozoan of similar morphology that causes malaria. Trophozoite and merozoite growth ruptures the host erythrocyte, leading to the release of vermicules, the infectious parasitic bodies, which rapidly spread the protozoa throughout the blood. It is important to pay attention to particular morphologies of Babesia in blood smears, because of its great similarity to the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This has resulted in many patients suffering from babesiosis being misdiagnosed. The few distinguishing factors for Babesia include protozoa with varying shapes and sizes, the potential to contain vacuoles, and the lack of pigment production. Trophozoites appearing in a tetrad formation within an erythrocyte are also indicative of Babesia. Despite much study of babesiosis and malaria, misdiagnosis with blood smear can be frequent and problematic. To supplement a blood smear, diagnoses should be made with an indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test. IFA testing has a much higher specificity than stained blood smears, with antibody detection in 88-96% of infected patients. Diagnostic measures through antibody testing are also particularly useful for identifying serum prevalence in asymptomatic individuals. Due to the transmissibility of Babesia through blood transfusions, IFA testing would be an effective means of screening for the disease in blood donations. Historically, babesiosis diagnosis was carried out with xenodiagnosis in hamsters for B. microti and in gerbils for B. divergens. This diagnostic technique has been abandoned in favor of faster diagnostic measures. = Treatment = Several methods are available to manage and treat babesiosis in animals. In humans, many spontaneously recover, having only experienced mild symptoms not diagnosed as the disease. This is almost always seen in B. microti infections, which are generally more common in the United States. For B. divergens and more severe B. microti infections, the standard treatment historically for symptomatic individuals was oral or intravenous clindamycin with oral quinine. With the results of research completed in 2000, however, treatment regimens have been increasingly leaning towards oral atovaquone with oral azithromycin. The latter are preferred, as they are equally effective in all but the most severe cases and exhibit fewer associated adverse reactions. In severe cases, blood exchange transfusions have been performed to lower the parasitic load in an individual. Other measures include addressing and correcting abnormal clinical signs. In seabirds, primaquine has been used in a study to show effective treatment on infected hosts. Treatment for babesiosis consisted of primaquine (1 mg/kg PO q24h for 10 days; primaquine phosphate 1.76%m/v in stabilized solution, Primaquin Solution, MedPet Ltd, Benrose, South Africa). After, treatment was followed by a phospholipid supplement (1 capsule/bird PO q24h for 12 days; deoiled, enriched phospholipids from soybeans, 300 mg/capsule, Essentiale Extreme, SanoÔ¨Å Aventis Ltd, Midrand, South Africa); as an attempt to mitigate potential hepatotoxic effects of primaquine. To prevent transmission of Babesia and other tickborne pathogens, all birds with visible ectoparasites are treated with pesticide powder (carbaryl 50 g/kg) upon admission, and the facilities are thoroughly cleaned on a daily basis. = Prevention in animals= In 1906, efforts were made to eradicate the tick vector of bovine babesiosis in the United States. This eradication was recorded as being successfully completed four decades later. Effective control can be achieved by vaccination with live attenuated phenotypes of the parasite. The vaccines have a number of drawbacks, so better, safer vaccines are still being researched. In recent years, a number of parasite proteins with immunogenic potential have been discovered. Through polymerase chain reaction, genetic sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis of the genes, a high degree of conservation (98‚Äì100%) was found among Brazilian isolates of B. bovis and the T2Bo isolate. Thus, these genes are considered for inclusion in a recombinant cocktail vaccine for cattle babesiosis caused by B. bovis. =Prevention in humans= The most effective public health measure for Babesia is to avoid tick exposure. This can be through personal prevention such as avoiding tick- infested areas (especially during high tick season between May and September), remaining covered with light clothing, searching for ticks after being outdoors, and removing discovered ticks from the skin. Other measures include applying DEET, a common repellent that is effective against ticks and insects. (For people who react adversely to DEET, alternative insect repellents should be used.) On a state level, if health departments are particularly motivated, tick elimination is a possibility. In 1906, efforts were made to eradicate the tick vector of the bovine disease form of babesiosis in the United States. This eradication was recorded as being successfully completed four decades later. Complete eradication through vector control would be a long-term project, which would significantly reduce the prevalence of both babesiosis and Lyme disease, but, as public health departments are often short on funding, preventive measures are more recommended. Due to the relatively low prevalence of the human disease and the presence of several reservoirs, babesiosis has not been a candidate for vaccines. In regions where ticks of domestic animals are routinely controlled with chemical acaricides to reduce incidence of infection with B. bovis and B. bigemina, the risk to humans from these parasites will be reduced.

In addition to his Queen's Plates, Giddings Jr. won ten of the two other Canadian Classic Races which today constitute the Canadian Triple Crown series. Harry Giddings Jr. maintained a stud farm near Oakville, and owned four of his eight Queen's Plate winners. He trained horses for other owners and was active in the business until his death in 1949.

Steneofiber esseri This small, 30-cm-long (1-ft-long) creature probably lived in large freshwater lakes, like present day beavers. A semiaquatic lifestyle is indicated by the presence of combing-claws, which living beavers use to waterproof their fur. Most likely, it was incapable of bringing down trees like its modern relatives. Steneofiber was more terrestrial than modern beavers, living in burrows. The finding of a possible family group of Steneofiber skeletons in France has been used to infer that the genus employed a K-selected reproductive strategy like modern beavers, in which extensive parental care is given to a small number of offspring. Steneofiber is among earliest known members of the subfamily Castorinae, which includes beavers more closely related to the two living species than to the recently extinct giant beaver.

Background Novik was ordered as a part of a program to bolster the Russian Pacific Fleet with a 3000-ton class reconnaissance cruiser. Shipbuilders from several countries offered designs, and eventually the German shipbuilders Schichau-Werke, better known for its torpedo boats was selected. The new cruiser was launched on 2 August 1900 and her trials began on 2 May 1901. Some initial vibration problems were experienced with her screws, but testing was completed on 23 April 1902 with five test runs at an average speed of 25.08 knots. This made Novik one of the fastest cruisers in the world at the time,Article 21 July 1901 New York Times which so impressed the Russian naval leadership that a near copy was made in the Russian . On 15 May 1902, Novik was assigned to the Russian naval base at Kronstadt. Service life (Russia) =Early career= On 14 September 1902, Novik departed Kronstadt for the Pacific, via the Kiel Canal, stopping at Brest (5 October), Cadiz, Naples and Piraeus, where she rendezvoused with the battleship .French newspaper Patrie, quoted in She departed Greece for Port Said on 11 December, but was forced to turn back due to severe weather, only transiting the Suez Canal on 20‚Äì21 December. Afterwards, she called on Jeddah, Djibouti, Aden, Colombo and Sabang, reaching Singapore on 28 February 1903, Manila, Shanghai and finally arriving at Port Arthur on 2 April 1903. She was assigned to accompany the cruiser to Japan from 26‚Äì29 May 1903 on a diplomatic mission, conveying Russian Minister of War Aleksey Kuropatkin to Kobe and Nagasaki, returning to Port Arthur from 12‚Äì13 June. She was then sent to Vladivostok over overhaul and dry-dock inspection from 23 July. As with other ships in the Pacific Fleet, she received a new dark olive paint scheme. She returned to Port Arthur in early September. =Russo-Japanese War= Novik suffered minor damage from an 8-inch shell, after she single-handedly pursued the attacking Japanese destroyers for nearly 30 miles on 9 February 1904, during the Battle of Port Arthur.Steer (1913) p. 16, 17Corbett (2015) Vol. 1, p. 98 Novik's commander, Captain Nikolai von Essen was one of the few ships in the Russian fleet to offer combat, and the only one to pursue the enemy, closing to within 3,000 yards of the Japanese squadron to deliver a torpedo, without effect. Novik's damage required nine days to repair. Article New York Times On 10 March 1904, Admiral Makarov sortied in Novik as his flagship, from Port Arthur, along with the cruiser Bayan to rescue one his destroyers, then in hot combat with a Japanese destroyer, just outside of shore battery range. After three attempts, withdrawing each time to within shore battery protection, coupled with the arrival of Japanese Armored Cruisers, the Russian destroyer finally sank, and Makarov and Novik returned to Port Arthur.Steer (1913) p. 50Corbett (2015) Vol. 1, p. 150 On 13 April 1904, a similar incident occurred, the Torpedo Boat Destroyer Strashni was fighting Japanese Torpedo Boat Destroyers, and was in sinking condition, when the Russian cruiser Bayan showed up, which quickly caused the enemy destroyers to leave the area. But the Bayan also knew that the retreating Japanese destroyers were headed to their own Armored Cruisers. Bayan picked up some survivors, then just outside of Port Arthur met with Admiral Makarov aboard his flagship Petropavlovsk, along with cruisers the Novik, Askold, Diana, and the battleship Poltova just coming out of Port Arthur.Corbett (2015) Vol. 1, p.180-183 Several minutes later the flagship struck three mines just outside the entrance to Port Arthur, and sank with great loss of life (including Admiral Makarov). The fleet then returned to the safe confines of Port Arthur. On 23 June, Novik was again part of an unsuccessful attempted sortie from Port Arthur, this time under Makarov's successor, Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft. On 10 August, the Russian fleet once more attempted to run the Japanese blockade of Port Arthur. In the resulting Battle of the Yellow Sea, most of the Russian ships returned to port but several managed to escape to be interned in various neutral ports. Novik was slightly damaged by three hits and two crewmen were killed. Novik reached the neutral German port of Tsingtao ; however, choosing to avoid internment, Commander von Schultz chose to outrace its Japanese pursuers around the Japanese home islands towards Vladivostok, hoping to join with the Russian cruiser squadron based there. Novik was pursued by the Japanese cruiser , which was later joined by . Spotted by a Japanese transport ship while coaling at Sakhalin, Novik was trapped in Aniva Bay, and forced into the battle of Korsakov by Tsushima. Realizing that he was hopelessly outgunned and after sustaining five hits, three of them under the water line, von Schultz ordered Novik scuttled, intending to make salvage impossible. Service life (Japan) Suzuya at Kure, 7 November 1908 The Imperial Japanese Navy had been impressed with the speed of Novik, and despite the considerable damage inflicted during the Battle of Korsakov (and the damage created by its own crew in attempting to scuttle the vessel), sent an engineering crew to salvage the vessel as a prize of war in August 1905. The operation took almost a year to accomplish. The wreck was repaired at the Yokosuka Naval Arsenal, and commissioned in the Imperial Japanese Navy as Suzuya on 20 August 1906. Her new name came from the Suzuya River in Karafuto, near where Novik was captured. During the repair work, her original boilers were replaced by eight Miyabara boilers, her three smokestacks were reduced to two, her lateral engines were removed and power output was reduced to 6,000HP. Suzuya's bow and stern main guns were replaced with 120-mm guns and her four 120-mm guns amidships were replaced by 76-mm guns. She also retained her six 47mm Hotchkiss guns and two 37mm guns. All repairs were complete by December 1908, and she was officially designated as an aviso rather than as a cruiser. Indeed, she served with the IJN primarily for high speed reconnaissance and as a dispatch vessel; however, due to her battle damage and fewer boilers, the repaired vessel could only attain a maximum speed of , as opposed to in her original configuration. Furthermore, the development of wireless communications quickly made such dispatch vessels obsolete. Suzuya was re-classified as a second-class coastal defense vessel on 28 August 1912, and was declared obsolete and sold for scrap on 1 April 1913.

Map of the railways in Paraguay The rail system in Paraguay consisted primarily of a 376 km main line of standard gauge between Asunci√≥n and Encarnaci√≥n (with a connection to Posadas, Argentina). The infrastructure was administered by Ferrocarriles del Paraguay S.A. (FEPASA), corporation established in 2002. Early in the 21st century, rail transport mostly ceased. Overview Railroads in Paraguay used steam locomotives until the end of railroad service in 1999. In 1988, The New York Times published an article describing the journey from Buenos Aires, Argentina to Asunci√≥n, Paraguay.

History Railways in Paraguay were inaugurated in 1861, during the era of Carlos Antonio L√≥pez. Privatized and renationalized several times, the railroad was finally nationalized in 1961. As of 1988, the 367 km rail system was outdated, wood-powered, slow and costly even with government subsidies. The volume of cargo carried on the railroad declined in the 1970s and 1980s as alternative roads and waterways became more efficient, though some agricultural goods did move by train. In Encarnaci√≥n, the Paraguayan railroad system connected via train ferry, then since 1990 via the San Roque Gonz√°lez de Santa Cruz bimodal road-rail bridge, with the Argentine city of Posadas, which is connected by Ferrocarril General Urquiza to Buenos Aires and the Uruguayan and Brazilian railroad systems.

The championship was originally known as the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship from its creation in 1942 until 1981. The championship was revived in 1987 as the WCWA Texas Tag Team Championship, and used until 1980, when it was abandoned as WCWA was merged with the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) to become the United States Wrestling Association. The name was also used for a title by NWA Southwest from 1998 to 2011, also known as the NWA Southwest Texas Tag Team Championship. As it is a professional wrestling championship, it is won not by actual competition, but by a scripted ending to a match. The first time a championship was promoted as the \\"Texas Tag Team Championship\\" was in 1943 when records indicate that Ellis Bashara and Angelo Cistoldi won the championship. The Texas Tag Team Championship was not mentioned again until 1945 in what would later become the National Wrestling Alliance's East Texas territory. By 1950 it was promoted by Southwest Sports and was officially recognized by the NWA. The first champions recognized by the NWA was the team of Rito Romero and Miguel Guzm√°n. In 1966, Fritz Von Erich bought Southwest Sports and renamed it NWA Big Time Wrestling. In the 1981 the championship was abandoned, with Raul Mata and Billy White Wolf as the last champions at the time. The Texas Tag Team Championship was brought back in 1987, with Big Time Wrestling now known as World Class Wrestling Association. The first WCWA Texas Tag Team Champions were Tony Atlas and Skip Young, who won a one-night single elimination tag team tournament to claim the championship. When WCWA merged with the Tennessee based CWA the title was abandoned, with Steve and Shaun Simpson as the last holders of the championship. In 2012 NWA Wrecking Ball Wrestling reactivated the NWA Texas titles. wreckingballwrestling.com The team of Duke Keomuka and Danny Savich won the championship on six occasions, the most of any team. Keomuka won the championship a total of 16 times, in addition to teaming with Savich he also won it with Ivan Kalmikoff, Mr. Moto, Don Evans, Tiny Mills, Kinji Shibuya, Tony Martin, Tokyo Joe, John Tolos, and Maurice Vachon. In 1950, Killer Kowalski defeated Keomuka and Savich in a handicap match, to become the only wrestler to hold the tag team championship singled handedly. Romero and Guzm√°n's reign from March 3 until November 30, 1950 is the longest confirmed reign of any championship team, a total of 272 days. Based on recorded history there were 153 individual reigns between 1943 and 1989, possibly more since there are periods of time where the championship history is unrecorded.

It involves the rhythmic use of a pair of matching floggers, one in each hand of the person administering the flogging. The term is an allusion to Florentine fencing, a Society for Creative Anachronism style where the fighter uses two swords, one in each hand. Mechanically, the rotation of the wrists, with hands in close proximity, is similar to the close-hand techniques of Poi. Because of this, the technique can be used to intensify the sensation of the strikes by repeating them in a manner which has a higher rhythm and strike rate than other methods. Although it may be believed that the intensity of this technique should only be done after the person receiving the flogging has been warmed-up (meaning to slowly, gradually bringing the blood up to the surface of the skin as to not cause injury), a slower rhythm with gentle impact can be used to great warm-up effect. The skin will become very warm to the touch when this has happened, and in some people, the skin may become pink. One must always be careful to check when it is safe to intensify the strike impact of this specialized technique. The strikes of the floggers come on the downward stroke or the 'top' of each figure-eight flail and are thrown to avoid striking the kidney or spinal area of the subject's back as well as avoiding any areas near joints or bone. This type of flagellation should only be done on the muscular regions of the body as to prevent serious injury. This is best done with a set of matching (identical, identically weighted or similar) floggers so that strike pressures can be most easily controlled. There are different flogging styles. The most common ones are two point Florentine Flogging and four point Florentine Flogging.

The POWs have ripped off their clothing and strewed it along the road. Some of the clothing is burning. Operation Big Switch was the repatriation of all remaining prisoners of the Korean War. Ceasefire talks had been going on between Communist and UN forces since 1951, with one of the main stumbling blocks being the Communist insistence that all prisoners be returned home, with the UN insisting that prisoners who wished to remain where they were be allowed to do so. After talks dragged on for two years, the Chinese and North Koreans relented on this point, and the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953. Details Operation Big Switch began in August 1953 and lasted until December. 75,823 Communist prisoners (70,183 North Koreans and 5,640 Chinese) were returned. Over 22,600 Communist soldiers, the majority of whom were former Republic of China soldiers who fought against the Communists in the Chinese Civil War and were pressed into foreign service in the People's Volunteer Army following their defeat, declined repatriation.

It was originally serialized in Hakusensha's LaLa magazine from July 2001 to May 2002, and later resumed in the January 2013 issue of LaLa DX and ended in the December 2013 issue. The story focuses on a sickly teenage girl and a vampire who just might save her life. Millennium Snow is licensed in English for release in North America, Australia and Southeast Asia. Plot Millennium Snow focuses on Chiyuki Matsuoka, a high school girl hospitalized with a heart problem. Since birth her heart has been very weak and she was told that she would probably live to be only fifteen. However, one day she meets T≈çya Kan≈ç, a vampire, with the opposite problem: T≈çya lives for about one thousand years. It's customary for a vampire at his age of eighteen to choose a human partner to be with for 1000 years who in turn would let him drink their blood and share his life span for the millennium. Early in the series, Chiyuki offers T≈çya her blood, so that she would be able to live longer, but T≈çya refuses, claiming he dislikes the sight and taste of blood. In the beginning, he even looks down on humans, believing that they are weak creatures who will only die before him and leave him behind, but later on he, with the help of Chiyuki, starts to see the world in a different perspective. Characters Millennium Snow main characters: T≈çya (left), Chiyuki (center), and Satsuki (right). ;: The heroine of the story, Chiyuki is a 17-year-old high school student who is hospitalized due to having a weak heart condition since birth. She has frequent seizures when she becomes distressed, and lately the seizures have been worsening. She tends to be a spunky person who is able to withstand anything. However, she also can be very emotional and cries a lot accordingly. :When she first meets T≈çya, he tells her that humans are weak. Later they go out shopping but Chiyuki has an attack and is immediately sent back to the hospital. When they return to the hospital, she believes she is dying and tells him not to be sad if she dies, because other people out there need him. He saves her by giving her a little bit of his blood to save her temporarily. Since then, she cannot die and does not want to leave him. After gaining some of his blood, she has recovered enough to go back to school, but is held back since she was in the hospital for so long. The blood he gives her though may not be effective because he has been going on so long without sucking a human's blood, so she can still get attacks, but her body is stronger. ;: T≈çya is the 18-year-old vampire that Chiyuki meets. While T≈çya tells Chiyuki that he hates blood, Yamimaru reveals to Chiyuki that he, like any other vampire, does indeed like blood, but simply doesn't want to be a burden on anyone. He can be out during the daytime, though still avoids garlic. Since he doesn't take in any blood, he has become anemic and whenever he is starving for food, he often falls over and is unable to move around until his bat Yamimaru comes to help him. :The main reason T≈çya does not want to look for a partner is that he has too nice a personality and would not want to force anyone to live for 1000 years as he sees it as more of a curse than a blessing. He often puts on the facade that he's a tough guy, but in reality he's quite the opposite. He extremely dislikes Satsuki. As noted by Yamimaru, he is just jealous that he and Chiyuki have become so close because he cares for Chiyuki more than anyone else. Later on the series he starts to develop feelings for Chiyuki. ;: T≈çya's servant bat who is the only one that T≈çya can rely on, especially if T≈çya has collapsed from a lack of energy. He has the ability to transform into a normal looking human, though this can only be done for about four to five hours per day. He has two human forms: one that is very tall (6'6\\") and theoretically looks like T≈çya's older brother, and a much younger version who can theoretically appear to be T≈çya's younger brother. ;: He is a very handsome student at Chiyuki's school who is very popular among the girls. He tends to be very suave and flirts a lot with the female students. As noted by Chiyuki, he also has a great sense of humor. :Satsuki lives with his grandmother and has been able to gain a lot of her wisdom because of it. Also, like T≈çya, he is not a human but in fact a werewolf. It is due to this that he constantly tries to appear as a normal person. If he didn't, he would always feel very insecure about him being a werewolf. He also seems to care a lot for Chiyuki and likes to protect (as well as flirt with) her to annoy T≈çya. Later on the series he starts to develop feelings for Chiyuki as well. ;Keigo Kuramatai: He is Chiyuki's 26-year-old cousin who shares a brother-sister bond with her. He is very protective of her due to her health issues; he can also be very possessive of her. Chiyuki believes that he left for the United States to study English, but the truth is that he is studying to become a heart specialist for her sake. He tries to separate Chiyuki from T≈çya. He even goes so far as to try to kill T≈çya with a rock but hits Chiyuki instead. He does not know Satsuki is a werewolf. Release Millennium Snow is written and illustrated by Bisco Hatori. The manga was originally serialized in Hakusensha's LaLa magazine between the July 2001 and May 2002 issues, and was later collected into two tank≈çbon volumes published from November 2001 to August 2002. A special chapter titled was released in the July 2002 issue of LaLa DX. The manga resumed in the January 2013 issue of LaLa DX, and ended in the December 2013 issue. Millennium Snow is licensed in English for release in North America by Viz Media, and in New Zealand and Australia by Madman Entertainment. Chuang Yi has licensed the series in English and Mandarin. Reception Millennium Snow was positively received by readers. The first volume of the English-language release appeared at the fourth place on Publishers Weeklys list of the bestselling graphic novels for April 2007. More than 20,000 copies of the first volume were sold in 2007. In 2013, the Japanese edition of volume three sold an estimated 27,582 copies for the week of August 5‚Äì11, with an estimated 27,765 copies sold in all. In his review of the first Millennium Snow volume, Anime News Network's Theron Martin felt that the character designs \\"not only have the typical ridiculously lanky look but simply aren't very appealing despite her efforts to portray Toya and Satsuki as bishonen studs.\\" Martin liked the unrelated bonus story at the end of the volume, calling it \\"exquisitely beautiful and melancholy\\". Millennium Snow ranked sixth on About.com's 2007 Reader's Poll for Best New Shojo Manga.

With budget support, money is given directly to a recipient country government, usually from a donor government. Budget support differs from other types of aid modalities such as: # Balance of payments support, which is currently mainly the domain of the International Monetary Fund. With balance of payments support the funds go to the central bank for foreign exchange purposes, while with budget support they generally go to the Ministry of Finance (or equivalent) and into the budget for public spending. # Project aid, where development assistance funds are used by donors to implement a specific project, with donors retaining control of the project's financing and management. In practice, budget support varies dramatically and is done in a large range of different ways. One of the broadest distinctions is between general budget support and sector budget support. General budget support is unearmarked contributions to the government budget including funding to support the implementation of macroeconomic reforms (structural adjustment programmes, poverty reduction strategies). Budget support is a method of financing a recipient country‚Äôs budget through a transfer of resources from an external financing agency to the recipient government‚Äôs national treasury. The funds thus transferred are managed in accordance with the recipient‚Äôs budgetary procedures. Funds transferred to the national treasury for financing programmes or projects managed according to different budgetary procedures from those of the recipient country, with the intention of earmarking the resources for specific uses, are therefore excluded. Sector budget support, like general budget support, is an un earmarked financial contribution to a recipient government‚Äôs budget. However, in sector budget support, the dialogue between donors and partner governments focuses on sector-specific concerns, rather than on overall policy and budget priorities.OECD DAC  Rationale for budget support  The underlying rationale for budget support is variously seen as: a) Researchers at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) describe how highly fragmented, ad hoc, small projects were not delivering results and cumulatively may have been undermining aid agencies' own objectives.Lawson, Andrew, David Booth, Alan Harding, David Hoole and Felix Naschold (2002) General Budget Support Evaluability Study: Phase 1 - Final Synthesis Report. London: Overseas Development Institute. There is some evidence that the effect of ad hoc, small projects is not systematic, but there is a wide range of individual evaluations of project as well as some more meta-review data such as Wapenhans report (1992) and ‚ÄòAssessing Aid‚Äô (1998). Thus the ODI highlights the following benefits: * High transactions costs from the multiplicity of different reporting and accounting requirements, including tied aid; * Inefficient spending dictated by donor priorities and procurement arrangements; * Undermining of state systems through the special staffing arrangements and parallel structures; * Corrosion of democratic accountability as mechanisms are designed to satisfy donor rather than domestic constituencies; * Hard to sustain positive impact beyond the short term, with high level of reliance on donor funding which undermined sustainability; * Corruption, fraud and rent-seeking were also a feature of the management of projects and not overcome by their independence from government control. b) that building recipient government capacity and accountability to their own populations for service delivery, as the only sustainable way of reducing poverty in the long term. Evidence is scarce, since it is hard to tell what level and type of effect budget support is or even could have on these long term and highly political processes. The findings of the largest review to date are over all positive. For more information, see the 8-country evaluation of GBS (1994-2004), 4-page summary: http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/16/63/37421292.pdf In practice the other types of aid instruments are still running concomitantly which means the potential expressed in the underlying rationale is unlikely to be fully tested.  Risks  The risks for donor governments and recipient governments are very different. The literature describes a range some of which are summarised below. For the donor government the risks include: # Political risk of a recipient government doing something high profile and unpalatable # Fiduciary risk of putting resources into weak systems or supporting poor policies (but this is partly the point of budget support also). This type of risk includes that of corruption in the recipient government. # Loss of profile- donors tend to like to be able to report on specific outputs that they are responsible for, which is not possible with budget support For the recipient government the risks include: # Much greater levels of intrusion by donors in your budget process # Reduced levels of flexibility about the allocation of resources, which with time may undermine the incentives for improving the efficiency of public spending # Increased volatility and unpredictability of aid flows # Increased vulnerability to ‚Äòaid shocks‚Äô if donors decided to withdraw funding  References  Support International development ","title":"Budget support"},{"id":"5734088","text":"Springfield is a ward in the London Borough of Hackney occupying much of Upper Clapton and some of Stamford Hill; the ward is part of the Hackney North and Stoke Newington constituency.

History Vitro was incorporated in 1950 as the Vitro Manufacturing Company. Its main product was slide transparencies for overhead projectors. For some time prior to incorporation, the founders had produced tinted lighting gels for the theater and stage industry, and were known for their leadership in the production of gels used to replicate the lighting characteristics of the outdoors on a sunny day. These gels had this quality because of the admixture of salts of uranium, which are bright yellow. This business had positioned Vitro as a ready source of uranium during US military and scientific research efforts into nuclear energy during the Second World War. It seems likely that the confidential relationships developed in this time-frame with US government entities led to later contracting and development business arrangements. In 1950 Vitro acquired the Kellex Corporation, a company involved in the development of the nuclear bomb. In 1953 the company reorganised as the Vitro Corporation of America. One of Vitro's earliest customers was the United States Navy, a relationship which continued into the 1990s. In 1968 Vitro was acquired by Automation Industries Inc and renamed Vitro Engineering Corp. In 1978 Automation Industries and its Vitro subsidiary were acquired by General Cable Corp, which renamed the new company GK Technologies. In 1981 GK Technologies (including Vitro) was acquired by the Penn Central Corporation. Penn Central had emerged from bankruptcy without its failing rail businesses (acquired by Federal government) and diversified into defense and other businesses. By the early 1990s Penn Central had begun to focus on financial services and in 1992 announced it was divesting Vitro. In 1993 Tracor completed its purchased of Vitro for $94 million.

It extends from an intersection with U.S. Route 9 (US 9), NY 29, and NY 50 in the city of Saratoga Springs to a junction with US 9 and NY 22 in the Clinton County hamlet of Keeseville. At in total length, NY 9N is the longest letter-suffixed route in the state. It is concurrent with its parent route for in the village of Lake George and for three blocks in the hamlet of Elizabethtown. Much of NY 9N runs alongside either a river or a lake. It follows the Hudson River through northern Saratoga County and southern Warren County, the entirety of Lake George's western shoreline, the west edge of Lake Champlain between Ticonderoga and Westport, and the Ausable River from Keene to Keeseville. The other portions of NY 9N pass through predominantly rural and mountainous regions of the Adirondack Mountains. The NY 9N designation was originally created as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to replace New York State Route 9W, a route assigned to an alternate routing of US 9 from Elizabethtown to Keeseville. NY 9N was extended southward to Lake George in March 1936 and to Saratoga Springs in the early 1950s, supplanting several other routes (including New York State Route 9K) in the process. Route description NY 9N is the longest suffixed route in the state, extending for from Saratoga Springs to Keeseville. The route stretches through four counties‚ÄîSaratoga, Warren, Essex and Clinton‚Äîand serves several villages and hamlets, including Lake George, Ticonderoga, and Elizabethtown. It overlaps its parent route, US 9, in Lake George and Elizabethtown and meets Interstate 87 (I-87) four times. =Saratoga County= NY 9N begins at the intersection of Church Street, Broadway (US 9, NY 29 westbound, and NY 50) and Lake Avenue (NY 29 eastbound) in the city of Saratoga Springs. Situated on the northwestern corner of the junction is the city's post office. The route heads west, following Church Street out of the city's center. At Bensonhurst Avenue, ownership and maintenance of NY 9N shifts from the city of Saratoga Springs to the New York State Department of Transportation. As NY 9N exits the city limits and enters the town of Greenfield, it turns to follow a more northerly routing. It meets County Route 21 (CR 21) just north of the town line, where the Church Street name ends, and CR 36 (Wilton Road) to the north in the hamlet of Greenfield Center. Saratoga Springs post office and first reassurance shield at NY 9N's southern terminus The route continues on into the town of Corinth, where it crosses the Blue Line into Adirondack Park. Not far to the north, NY 9N enters the village of Corinth, situated on the west bank of the Hudson River. The highway follows Saratoga Avenue and Maple Streets into the village center, where it turns north and exits the village on Main Street. NY 9N follows the western edge of the river north for roughly through the towns of Corinth and Hadley before crossing over it and passing from Saratoga County to Warren County. =Warren County= Across the county line in Lake Luzerne, NY 9N begins to deviate from the Hudson River, gradually curving to the northeast as it passes through the hamlets of Lake Luzerne, Fourth Lake, and Lake Vanare, all of which are named for small lakes bearing those names near the center of the communities. Just northeast of Lake Vanare, NY 9N enters the town of Lake George, where it connects to I-87 (the Adirondack Northway) at exit 21 and meets US 9. Here, it joins its parent route northward toward the village of Lake George. The conjoined routes intersect the northern end of NY 9L just south of the village line before becoming Canada Street and entering the village limits upon crossing over West Brook. US 9 and NY 9N serve as the primary north‚Äìsouth thoroughfare through the village before splitting at the north end of the village. While US 9 continues to the north, NY 9N heads northeast along the western edge of Lake George. The portion of NY 9N between Lake George village and Hague is relatively isolated, with mountains lining the western edge of the highway and the lakeshore located to the immediate east. Along this stretch, NY 9N serves numerous lakeside hamlets, the southernmost of which is Diamond Point, a community just south of the Lake George‚ÄìBolton town line. The route continues on, passing through the hamlets of Bolton and Bolton Landing, the latter of which is home to The Sagamore, a resort situated on an island in Lake George. View of NY 9N from the North End Trailhead in Bolton. North of Bolton Landing, the route leaves the main lake and instead follows the edge of Northwest Bay, an inlet separated from Lake George itself by a large, mountainous peninsula. The bay abruptly ends about to the north, at which point NY 9N curves to the east and proceeds through a pass in the mountains to rejoin the western edge of Lake George at Sabbath Day Point in the town of Hague. Here, the route turns back to the north and follows Lake George to the hamlet of Hague, where it meets the northern (signed as the eastern) terminus of NY 8\\\\. NY 9N continues to serve as the lakeside roadway for another before curving away from the lake and entering Essex County. =Essex and Clinton counties= Now in the town of Ticonderoga, NY 9N passes through a valley before curving to the east and entering the hamlet of Ticonderoga. For the most part, NY 9N bypasses the community as it turns north onto Wicker Street, the westernmost north‚Äìsouth through street in the hamlet. Northwest of the former village's center, NY 9N meets NY 22 and NY 74, the latter of which serves as a northerly bypass of Ticonderoga. NY 22 joins NY 9N here, following the route out of the hamlet. NY 9N and NY 22 head generally northward through an area of lowlands, which eventually give way to Lake Champlain as the conjoined routes pass into the town of Crown Point. Once again, NY 9N serves as the lakeside highway as it follows the western edge of the lake through the hamlet of Crown Point to the peninsula that gives the town its name. While NY 9N and NY 22 pass by Crown Point to the west, NY 185 directly serves the peninsula and the Crown Point State Historic Site, located at its tip. The routes continue northward along the lakeshore through the town of Moriah and the village of Port Henry to the town of Westport, where NY 9N and NY 22 split in the hamlet of Westport. While NY 22 continues north towards Essex, NY 9N heads west to follow a more inland routing through a series of narrow valleys. NY 9N intersects I-87 once again at exit 31 just before entering the town of Elizabethtown. The route continues west, passing over the Bouquet River and entering the hamlet of Elizabethtown, where it rejoins US 9 in the former village's center. Unlike the overlap in Lake George, this concurrency lasts for only three blocks before the two routes split. NY 9N continues to the west for through deep, narrow valleys to Keene, where it meets NY 73 north of Keene Valley. Here, NY 9N turns north, joining NY 73 for to the hamlet of Keene, located on the east branch of the Ausable River. NY 73 heads off to the west from this point toward Lake Placid; however, NY 9N follows the river northward into the town of Jay, where it intersects the east end of NY 86\\\\. The highway continues alongside the western bank of the river branch to the hamlet of Au Sable Forks, situated on the Essex‚ÄìClinton County line and at the point where the Ausable River's east and west branches come together. The highway enters Au Sable Forks from the south on South Main Street and becomes North Main Street upon crossing the west branch of the river and entering Clinton County and the town of Black Brook. NY 9N immediately turns east upon crossing the river, following Ausable Street out of the hamlet and along the northern edge of the Ausable River into the town of Au Sable. Here, NY 9N meets I-87 one final time at exit 34 just southwest of the village of Keeseville. NY 9N continues on into Keeseville, where it meets NY 22 once again at an intersection across the river from the village center. NY 22 and NY 9N come together once more, overlapping for to an intersection with US 9 a short distance downstream from the center of Keeseville. NY 9N comes to an end here while NY 22 turns south onto US 9. History NY 9N and US 9 facing towards Lake George Village in 1973 Map of the area surrounding Glens Falls and Saratoga Springs, with former NY 9K highlighted in red In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 22, an unsigned legislative route that was initially split into two segments. The northern half of the route ran from Riparius to Rouses Point and mostly followed what is now US 9 between the two locations. From Elizabethtown to Keeseville, however, Route 22 followed a more westerly alignment via Keene, Jay, and Au Sable Forks. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route 22 north of Riparius became part of NY 6, which continued south toward Glens Falls on what is now US 9\\\\. At the same time, the section of modern NY 9N between Saratoga Springs and Lake George was designated as part of NY 10. The portion between Ticonderoga and Westport became part of a realigned NY 30 by the following year. By 1926, the piece of current NY 9N from Hague to Ticonderoga was designated as the easternmost leg of NY 47, which continued west to Chestertown on modern NY 8. In 1927, most of NY 6 north of Round Lake was replaced by US 9 when U.S. Highways were first signed in New York. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. The lone exception was between Elizabethtown and Keeseville, where US 9 followed a previously unnumbered highway to the east instead. The bypassed section of NY 6 between the two locations was redesignated as NY 9W at this time. NY 9W was renumbered to NY 9N as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, eliminating the alphanumerical duplication between itself and US 9W. NY 47, meanwhile, became part of the new NY 8 in the 1930 renumbering, allowing the NY 47 designation to be reassigned to a previously unnumbered roadway along the western shore of Lake George between NY 8 in Hague and US 9 in Lake George village. At the same time, NY 10 was realigned south of Long Lake and replaced with NY 9K from Saratoga Springs to Lake George while the roadway connecting Ticonderoga to Westport became part of NY 22 after NY 30 was reassigned elsewhere in the state. The segment of modern NY 9N from Westport to Elizabethtown, previously unnumbered, was designated NY 195. NY 9N was extended south to Lake George in March 1936, supplanting both NY 47 and NY 195 in an effort to aid tourists. From Westport to Hague, NY 9N overlapped with NY 22 (from Westport to Ticonderoga) and NY 8 (from Crown Point to Hague). The route was extended once more in November 1953 to its current southern terminus in Saratoga Springs, replacing NY 9K and creating a short overlap with US 9 through Lake George village in the process. The overlap with NY 8 was eliminated in the mid-1960s when that route was truncated to end at its junction with NY 9N in Hague.

High-level describe those operations that are more abstract in nature; wherein the overall goals and systemic features are typically more concerned with the wider, macro system as a whole. Low-level describes more specific individual components of a systematic operation, focusing on the details of rudimentary micro functions rather than macro, complex processes. Low-level classification is typically more concerned with individual components within the system and how they operate. Features which emerge only at a high level of description are known as epiphenomena. Differences Due to the nature of complex systems, the high-level description will often be completely different from the low-level one; and, therefore, the (different) descriptions that each deliver are consequent upon the level at which each (differently) direct their study. For example, * there are features of an ant colony that are not features of any individual ant; * there are features of the human mind that are not known to be descriptive of individual neurons in the brain; * there are features of oceans which are not features of any individual water molecule; and * there are features of a human personality that are not features of any cell in a body. Uses * In computer science, software is typically divided into two types: high-level end-user applications software (such as word processors, databases, video games, etc.), and low-level systems software (such as operation systems, hardware drivers, etc.). As such, high-level applications typically rely on low-level applications to function. In terms of programming, a high-level programming language is one which has a relatively high level of abstraction, and manipulates conceptual functions in a structured manner. A low-level programming language is one like assembly language that contains rudimentary microprocessor commands. * In formal methods, a high-level formal specification can be related to a low-level executable implementation (e.g., formally by mathematical proof using formal verification techniques). * In sociology and social anthropology, high-level descriptions would be terms like economy and political structure, and low level descriptions would be individual peoples' motivations and work. * In neuroscience, low-level would relate to the functioning of a cell (or part of a cell, or molecule) and high level to the overall function or activity of a neural system. * In documentation, a high-level document contains the executive summary, the low- level documents the technical specifications. * In business, corporate strategy is a high-level description, a list of who does what jobs is a low level description. Examples * Climate is a high-level description of the actions of the atmosphere and oceans. Physics of water and gas molecules is a low-level description of the same system. * The instruction \\"write a creative poem on love\\" is a high-level instruction. The instruction \\"tighten the tendons in the dominant wrist to grip the pen\\" is a low-level description of an activity within that. * \\"Wikipedia is an encyclopedia\\" is a high-level description compared to \\"Wikipedia is a collection of textual articles on many topics\\". The former reflects a higher level view of organization, purpose, concept and structure, but does not explain what Wikipedia physically is. The latter is more detailed as to what exactly Wikipedia contains and how it's made up, but doesn't explain what its overall purpose and goals are. These are typical features of high-level and low-level descriptions.

He has previously played for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks, Sydney Roosters and the Canberra Raiders in the National Rugby League (2004 - 2014); and for the Hull Kingston Rovers, Salford Red Devils, and the Catalans Dragons teams in the Super League (2015 - 2018). His main positions were as a or . Background Carney was born in Goulburn, New South Wales, Australia. Playing Career =Early career= Carney played his junior rugby league for the Goulburn Stockmen, before being recruited to the Canberra Raiders' junior academy at the age of just twelve. Playing in the Jersey Flegg Championship, Carney's team were Premier Champions in 2003. =Senior career= =Canberra Raiders (2004-09)= Carney made his National Rugby League Premiership d√©but during the 2004 NRL season at the age of 17. After a handful of appearances, he was named the Canberra Raiders' Rookie of the Year. Canberra Raiders had signed Jason Smith and Sam Peez, who in 2005, helped shape Carney's game. Despite only playing 11 games and scoring a single try. Carney was rewarded with a starting position in the Junior Kangaroos' annual fixture against Papua New Guinea, where he tallied a record 20 points. 2006 was Carney's breakthrough year, where he cemented his position in the first- grade team, scoring 12 tries in 18 games. Alongside Adam Mogg, he was the Raiders' leading try-scorer for 2006. His long-range kicking game also became a feature of his play, going onto record numerous 40-20's. Carney won three games in extra-time off 40-metre drop-goals, as Canberra finished in the top 8 of the National Rugby League (NRL) competition ladder. He was again selected in the Junior Kangaroos' squad, where he was appointed as captain. After an incident on 16 December 2006 in Goulburn, Carney was charged with drink driving and reckless driving. Following legal proceedings in February 2007, Carney was suspended from driving a motor vehicle for five-years. Taking on the role of in 2007, Carney earned three 'Man-of-the-Match' Awards from seven games. However, his selection chances in the NSW Country Origin team were laid to rest due to another driving-related off-field misbehaviour. On 18 May 2007, despite being disqualified from driving, Carney drove a Ute belonging to teammate, Steve Irwin. Police began to pursue the vehicle after noticing the wheels of the Ute momentarily lost traction as it went around a corner. Despite the police car having its sirens sounding and lights flashing, Carney refused to stop his speeding vehicle. Leading police on a high-speed chase through the back streets of the Canberra suburb of Bruce. After turning into a dead-end street, Carney stopped the car and fled the scene on foot, leaving Irwin in the passenger seat. Irwin told police that, ‚ÄúCarney was the driver.‚Äù Police went to Carney's home address, but he was not there instead the police found 23-year-old room-mate, Tom Witcombe. Who ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù that he had not seen Carney since earlier that afternoon. The next morning, Carney turned himself into the police. On Tuesday 12 June 2007, Carney appeared at the ACT Magistrates Court. Carney plead guilty to the charges of failing to stop when directed by police, negligent driving and driving while disqualified. He was spared jail, but the Court placed Carney on a 12-month good behaviour order and banned him from driving until 2012. He was also sentenced to 200 hours of community service. The Magistrate warned Carney that if he were to commit another offence he would, ‚Äúundoubtedly go to jail.‚Äù Controversially the Canberra Raiders club sacked Steve Irwin (who was not charged with any offences over the incident), but retained Carney. Carney was the Raiders' top try-scorer for the 2007 NRL season. Before the 2008 NRL season, Carney began modelling his game on Johnathan Thurston, in a bid to play representative football. He was also being personally coached by his life and childhood hero, Laurie Daley. His 2008 pre-season was eventful, as he became the subject of a three-way battle between Canberra, Manly and Penrith. Eventually he re-signed with the Raiders until 2010, with an option for a further two-years. Though off-field misbehaviour continued to plague Carney's playing career and on 20 July 2008, it was ‚Äúalleged‚Äù that he had urinated on a man in a Canberra nightclub, the man had to undertake counseling to overcome the trauma of the incident. Carney was suspended from participating in league matches and training while the allegations were investigated. The complaint was withdrawn two-days later, but Carney remained suspended for the round 21 match against the Gold Coast Titans. The nightclub allegations sparked renewed interest in Carney's 2007 negligent driving charges, when Steve Irwin ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù that Carney was intoxicated whilst driving at the time of the 2007 incident. But Irwin had been pressured by the club (Canberra Raiders) to remain quiet, in an attempt to avoid a jail sentence for Carney. The incident led to the club imposing an ultimatum on Carney which included a five-point plan. Whereby Carney would have to: *Stand-down from training and matches for the rest of the season. *To go on an alcohol ban until the end of 2012. *Undergo counselling. *Complete a community service programme. *To also pay a $20,000 fine. The NRL threatened to de-register his contract for two-years, if Carney did not accept this plan in order to protect the Raiders from losing him to another club. Carney asked for a variation of the plan where he could avoid points one and two. This was unacceptable to the club's board and on 7 August 2008, the Canberra club sacked Carney and terminated his $400,000 a season contract. Carney was de-registered by the NRL and he would not be eligible to compete in the competition until 2010. Carney attempted to follow ex-Dragon's coach Nathan Brown to the Huddersfield Giants on a one-year deal, but was unable to obtain a Visa in late 2008, due to his previous drink driving offences. Carney applied to the NRL in an effort to play for an Australian club in the 2009 NRL season, but the NRL stated that, ‚Äúthey would not accept registration of a contract for Todd Carney for that season.‚Äù In February 2009, Carney went on a vandalism spree in Goulburn, jumping on a car bonnet and damaging the entrance to a Fone Zone store. He received a 12-month suspended jail sentence and he was also ordered to undertake alcohol counselling. In March 2009, the Canberra Raiders agreed to release Carney to play for the Atherton Roosters in the Cairns competition in Far North Queensland. Carney was assaulted by four-men in Atherton on 10 May 2009, with one of those men former Cowboys, Broncos and current (at the time of the incident) London Broncos' player, Nick Slyney. Carney ‚Äúreportedly‚Äù injured a man by setting his pants on fire in an incident on New Year's Eve. The man suffered burns to his buttock, scrotum and upper thighs, after ‚Äúallegedly‚Äù having his pants set alight while on holiday at Airlie Beach in Queensland. The police did not investigate the incident, with the man making no formal complaint. However, this was not a good start to his Sydney Roosters' career, after the club had just handed him a career lifeline by signing him to a three-year deal. =Sydney Roosters (2010-11)= After his season-long ban from the NRL expired, Carney joined the Sydney Roosters for the 2010 NRL season. Carney playing for the Sydney Roosters. In preparation for his comeback season, Carney bought a punching bag to exercise with. He played his first game for the club against his old team the Atherton Roosters, in a pre-season trial in Atherton. After playing all of his football at Canberra in the position, he was shifted to by Roosters' coach, Brian Smith. After his d√©but against the South Sydney Rabbitohs in a 36-10 victory, Carney was kept at . Only shifting back into the position to cover injuries or representative absentees. Until round 14 against the Melbourne Storm, when he was permanently switched to , displacing captain Braith Anasta to . His switch to the position was very successful, with the Roosters undertaking a five-game winning streak soon after the move. Carney formed an incisive attacking combination with his partner Mitchell Pearce. He was also a facilitator to his outside backs with Anthony Minichiello and Shaun Kenny-Dowall in particular showing increased productivity. In addition, he had taken on the kicking duties for the Roosters scoring over 200 points. In the regular season Carney finished second on the top-point scorers and goal-kickers lists. He was named as the season's Dally M Medallist for the NRL's best player. Carney also won the Dally M 'Five-Eight of the Year' and the Provan-Summons Medal ('People's Choice') Award. He also received the Rugby League International Federation's 'International Player of the Year Award' for 2010. In December 2010, it was ‚Äúreported‚Äù that Carney had injured himself, after falling from his balcony while trying to gain entry to the building after locking himself out. He suffered no serious injuries. Carney dated Seven Network television presenter, Liz Cantor. Their relationship didn't last very long and they soon went their separate ways. At the end of his 2011 NRL season, he had played a total of 118 games, 115 at club level and 3 at representative level. On 26 February 2011, it was ‚Äúreported‚Äù that Carney would face a low-range drink driving charge. The Sydney Roosters confirmed that they would stand-by him through this indiscretion. Just over a month later, Carney was found to be involved with Anthony Watts, when he was drinking on 16 April 2011. Following the second incident in three- months, NRL management stood Carney down from the Roosters indefinitely. He was subsequently required to receive treatment for his behavioural issues. Carney returned to the NRL in a round 10 clash against the Cronulla Sharks at Toyota Park. However in early August 2011, Carney, together with Nate Myles and Frank-Paul Nuuausala, broke a team agreement to not touch alcohol for two- weeks. All three players were subject to disciplinary hearings.

By mid-October 2011, there was further media ‚Äúspeculation‚Äù that Carney would be signed by the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks or the St. George Illawarra Dragons. On 26 October 2011, it was announced that Carney had accepted a two-year contract with the Cronulla Sharks, estimated to be worth $700,000. =Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks (2012-14)= Carney's first year at Cronulla was very good, as he helped the side into the finals. However, they were defeated by the Raiders in the Qualifying Finals. He was also selected to represent New South Wales in the annual State of Origin series playing at the position. Carney spent the off-season recovering from an achilles tendon tear, but despite an offer from the New Zealand Warriors in January 2013, Carney signed-up with the Sharks for an additional five-years from 2013. Carney for the second time in his career, he won the Dally M 'Five-Eight of the Year' Award in the 2013 NRL season. On 29 June 2014, Carney was sacked by the Sharks, due to a photograph leaked on social media in which he appears to urinate into his own mouth. As he was on his last warning for behavioural issues, the NRL's Chief Operating Officer Jim Doyle, said, ‚ÄúI would be surprised if any club would show interest in signing him. Considering his chequered history and even if they did it was 'unlikely' the NRL would agree to register him.‚Äù On 18 January 2019, Carney appeared on the NRL podcast titled \\"Bloke in a bar\\". Carney was asked by host Denan Kemp about the incident which saw his contract terminated by Cronulla. Carney said that his \\"Bubbler\\" act had been performed by another teammate Bryce Gibbs. Carney claimed the \\"Bubbler\\" became part of celebrations after each win. Carney also claimed that former Cronulla boss Steve Noyce was among the club officials to witness Gibbs do the '\\"Bubbler\\" and says he did not balk at it before the publicly circulated photo of Carney stole headlines and ultimately led to his exile from the NRL. Carney stated that Noyce only made an issue of the act because of the photograph becoming public.

On 22 May 2018, Carney's former side the Northern Pride were demanding $15,000 in compensation for relocation costs. Northern Pride Chief Executive Officer Greg Dowling, said, ‚ÄúHe (Carney) doesn't owe us money, but we want compensation. We paid him an amount to relocate here and we want that refunded. Once they pay we'll clear him. Naturally, we were chasing a number of people and when Todd agreed, we concentrated on him thinking he would be here long-term. I've spoken to his manager and to Greg Florimo, so that's where things are at now.‚Äù On 1 July 2018, Carney's move to the North Sydney Bears was blocked, after Carney refused to pay the Northern Pride a $15,000 release fee. Northern Pride had demanded the North Sydney Bears to pay the release fee, but they refused to do so, hoping that a deal could be arranged between Carney's management team and the North Queensland side before the transfer window closed. =Hull Kingston Rovers (2018)= It was revealed on 7 July 2018, that Carney had signed a short-term contract at Hull Kingston Rovers, to play for the east Hull outfit until at least the end of the 2018 rugby league season.https://mobile.twitter.com/hullkrofficial/status/1015460400626724864 Just 24-hours after landing fresh off the plane from his native Australia, Todd participated in his first training session with his new club on 23 July 2018.

Head Coach Tim Sheens took the decision not to throw Carney into the deep end on his d√©but, (due to his lack of game-time over the previous months), to allow him time to adjust and to get himself well adapt to his new surroundings.

The seal itself was given to Haakon as a gift from Henry III of England in 1236 H√°konar saga H√°konarsonar (The Saga of Haakon Haakonarson) or H√°konar saga gamla H√°konarsonar is an Old Norse Kings' Saga, telling the story of the life and reign of King Haakon Haakonarson of Norway. Content and style The circumstances of the saga's composition are exceptionally well understood, as they are recorded in some detail in Sturlunga saga (particularly Sturlu √æ√°ttr): the saga was written in the 1260s (apparently 1264-65) by the Icelandic historian and chieftain Sturla √û√≥r√∞arson (nephew of the noted historian Snorri Sturluson). Sturla √û√≥r√∞arson was at the court of Haakon's son Magnus Lagab√∏te when Magnus learned of his father's death in Kirkwall in Orkney. Magnus is said to have immediately commissioned Sturla to write his father's saga. This was awkward for Sturla: 'King H√°kon had instigated the death of Sturla's uncle, Snorri Sturluson, in 1241. Sturla rightly regarded H√°kon as his most dangerous enemy, for he had steadfastly resisted the king's subjugation of Iceland to Norway, which was accomplished in 1262-1264. Sk√∫li B√°r√∞arson (d. 1240), H√°kon's most dangerous rival for royal power, was the maternal grandfather of Magn√∫s, who supervised the composition of his father's biography, much as King Sverrir is said to have \\"sat over\\" Karl J√≥nsson as the Icelandic abbot wrote Sverrir's biography'.Paul Schach, 'H√°konar saga gamla H√°konarsonar', in Pulsiano, Phillip (ed.), Medieval Scandinavia: An Encyclopedia (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 259-60 (p. 259).

The label gave a strong foundation to bands Anatomy of a Ghost, Ever We Fall (who later signed with Hopeless) and Fear Before the March of Flames (who signed to Equal Vision). Later signees (e.g. Drop Dead, Gorgeous, Breathe Carolina and The Devil Wears Prada), gained considerable popularity while with Rise, and moved on to what were larger labels at the time (Interscope, Fearless and Ferret, respectively). Rise has also signed some veteran bands, including Hot Water Music, Bouncing Souls, The Bled, Bleeding Through and From First To Last. Rise Records' releases are distributed in the U.S. by ADA and BMG. In July 2013, the company moved from Portland to neighboring Beaverton, Oregon.

Mountains in the north provided the necessary raw materials such as firewood, kaolinite, and silicon dioxide for the master potters while a well established system of distribution transported pottery throughout Korea and facilitated export to China and Japan.

The kiln sites are important today because they are the remnants of the pottery culture. The 188 kilns of the Gangjingun Kiln Sites are located in the regions of Yongunni, Gyeyulli, Sadangni, and Sudongni. 98 of these are designated as historic sites by the Korean government. The 75 kilns in Yongunni are in generally in good condition and are some of the earliest dated. These kilns are dated to the 10th and 11th centuries. These kilns provide clues for scholars interested in discovering the origins and kiln characteristics of the first Korean celadons manufactured. Fragments of ancient Chinese kiln products have also been uncovered in this region. 59 kilns remain in Gyeyulli and the kilns in this region date from the 11th century to the 13th century. Excavations have uncovered pottery similar in style to Yongunni pottery but most pottery shards are of the conventional inlaid celadon type. Celadon Incense Burner from the Korean Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392), with kingfisher color glaze. The 43 kilns of Sadangni are dated from the 12th to 14th centuries. The kilns at Tangion village date from the early 12th century to the 13th century and are representative of the Goryeo ceramic kilns which were used in the production of Goryeo celadons, famous for their superior kingfisher color and inlay technique. The pottery produced here would be during the peak of the creative development of Korean celadon. An additional six kilns remain in Sudongni which date to the 14th century but most have been destroyed due to river erosion and farming. These celadon kilns were still employing techniques from previous centuries although the colors, patterns, and glazes used were very diverse. The Daegumyeon kiln site was rediscovered in 1914. Excavations unearthed a wide variety of pottery fragments diverse in shape, size and colors. The Daegumyeon kiln site is unusual because of the high concentration of kilns and because the dates of these kilns range throughout the entire Goryeo Dynasty. This site, therefore, is very valuable as a resource for scholars and archaeologists. A fully restored kiln based on those excavations is now housed at the National Museum of Korea. The Goryeo Celadon Office was established in 1986 to preserve kiln sites and also to reproduce and reconstruct the techniques lost many hundreds of years ago. The Goryeo Celadon Museum in Gangjin features the history of the sites and houses a collection.

He was involved with the creation and development of multiple corporations, including the United Fruit Company, Gillette Safety Razor Corp., and International Telephone & Telegraph Corporation. He was also part of the American delegation at the Paris Peace Conference following the First World War. From 1937 to 1944, Palmer donated his extensive land holdings to the state of Massachusetts. These lands today make up the Bradley Palmer State Park in Topsfield, Massachusetts. Biography =Family background= The American Palmers in Bradley Palmer's ancestral line came from William Palmer, Nottinghamshire, who was possibly one of the original Scrooby congregation of puritan separatists. He sailed on the vessel Fortune in 1621 from Plymouth, England, to Plymouth, Massachusetts, settling finally in Duxbury. Bradley's grandfather on his father's side, Gideon, moved to Pennsylvania Bradley Webster Palmer was born on June 28, 1866, in Wilkes- Barre, Pennsylvania. His father was Henry W. Palmer, who served as Attorney General of the State of Pennsylvania, 1879‚Äì1883, and a member of congress, 1901‚Äì1907 and 1909. His mother, Ellen W. Palmer, was an essential figure in fighting for the rights of breaker boys in Pennsylvania. She promoted child literacy and appropriate wages, equal to those of adults for the work done by the boys. Until the 1990s a statue of Ellen Palmer stood on the city commons in Wilkes-Barre. =Education= Bradley's parents sent him to Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, where he was admitted at the age of 16 in 1882. At Exeter, Palmer was involved in The Exonian, debate club, the Christian Fraternity, and the G. L. Soule Literary Society, as well as playing tennis, baseball, and lacrosse, and being his class secretary. From there he went immediately to Harvard University, receiving an AB in 1888. He was a treasurer of the Harvard Lampoon and a member of the Hasty Pudding Club. He played football and baseball for his class teams, and he was a member of the Institute of 1770 (later merged with the Hasty Pudding Club), Delta Kappa Epsilon, the Historical Club, the Finance Club, the St. Paul's Society, and the Varsity Club. He stayed on an extra year in Harvard University School of Law, earning the AM in 1889. He was a proctor that year. Returning to Wilkes- Barre he went to work in his father's law office there in 1889 at the age of 23 and passed the bar in Pennsylvania in 1890. He returned to Boston in 1891 and passed the bar in Massachusetts the following year. Legal career Until 1899 Bradley's chief work in the firm of Storey, Thorndike and PalmerThe name of the firm changed somewhat over the years as partners moved in and out. had been to check the legality of bonds and then to handle the legal business of the Boston Fruit Company, the company of Andrew W. Preston, a Boston banana importer. In that year, however, he created the United Fruit Company by a merger of Preston's firm and the banana import business of Minor Cooper Keith. Bradley became a director and a permanent member of the executive committee, while his law partners were listed as executives. Their first move was to buy outright or buy an interest in 14 competitors. They now had a monopoly on the Costa Rican banana import business and controlled 80% of the entire business in the United States. These moves under Bradley's tutelage brought instant wealth to everyone concerned. The profits in 1899 were 1.6 million, and were up to 6.2 million by 1907. For all business purposes, Bradley was United Fruit. When the first anti-trust suit was brought against United Fruit in 1909, charging that it had created a monopoly and was using its financial interests in the competition (in this case the Bluefields Steamship Company) to suppress their business, Palmer, as secretary, was named along with Preston and Keith, the president and vice president. Palmer was a lawyer and partner with multiple Boston-based corporations, including the United Fruit Company (which controlled large land holdings and agriculture in Central America), Gillette, and ITT Corporation. He was possibly an attorney for Sinclair Oil during the Teapot Dome scandal.Though no primary sources support this claim, most secondary sources report this. Personal life Palmer never married, but was involved in the social life of the North Shore of Massachusetts, which is relatively densely populated with horse farms. He belonged to Myopia Hunt Club in Hamilton, Massachusetts, which is known for its golf course and its equestrianism. Periodically it holds steeple-chasing events, polo matches, horse shows and fox hunts. Bradley Palmer hosted some of these events on his estate. Bradley died in 1946. Bradley enjoyed numerous individualisms, such as smoking a cigar with the end stuck in a pipe bowl. Public service During WWI, Palmer's career took a brief break from his legal career. In December 1917, Palmer went to Washington D. C. and joined the office of Alien Property Custodian, which was charged with the investigation of attempts by German nationals to conceal their extensive property of all sorts in the United States, and with the confiscation and disposition of this property. Where he did both investigations and dispositions, mainly by sale, for which legal expertise was required. All of members of the APC served without pay. He also was appointed as counsel to the Capital Issues Committee. In 1918 Bradley was also appointed to an advisory committee supporting the Federal Reserve Board, also serving without pay. He was the board's lawyer. After the War, Palmer continued serving his country after being appointed by President Wilson to the delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. Wilson chose Palmer because of his experience with the Alien Property Custodian. In Palmer's own words: \\"At the end of the War, President Wilson required someone familiar with the operations of the Alien Property Custodian to attend the peace conferences in Paris. He selected me. I had no official title, but was assigned as the representative of the United States to several sub-committees whose duty was to prepare the provisions of the treatise of economic character. Our sphere covered restoration of business relations, adjustment of private contracts, property rights and interests, and similar considerations.\\"Harvard Class of 1888, ‚ÄúBradley Webster Palmer,‚Äù in Harvard Class of 1888: Secretary‚Äôs Report No. X (Boston: The Rockwell and Churchill Press, 1938), 253. The elements negotiated by Palmer and his fellow economic delegates made it into the separate U.S.‚ÄìGerman Peace Treaty in 1921. For his work during the Paris Peace Conference, Palmer was decorated by France, Belgium, and Romania, as well as receiving a letter of commendation from the United States government. He then returned home and began practicing law again. Land holdings Beginning in 1891 Palmer began to acquire land. An equestrian and nature-lover, he continued to purchase land as he accumulated the means. At one point, he owned over 10,000 acres (40 km¬≤) on the North Shore of Massachusetts in towns such as Boxford, Georgetown, Hamilton, Ipswich, Rowley, and Topsfield. In 1898 Palmer purchased the hereditary farm holdings of the Lamson family, some . This would become the estate in which he resided, known as Willow Dale. The mansion was built in 1902 by Charles K. Cummings, who described the original structure as having, > a rather unusual arrangement, the master‚Äôs house, the quarters for a farmer > or caretaker, and the stable, all being joined together under one roof. This > was done with a view to economy of construction and management; and > especially during the winter months this grouping together of quarters, > which more often appear as separate buildings, has been found convenient and > agreeableC. Cummings, ‚ÄúHouse of Mr. Bradley W. Palmer, Topsfield, Mass.,‚Äù > Architectural Review, 11 (1904): 40. In 1915, Palmer renovated the mansion, moving the stables and coach house to separate buildings and replacing them with a dining room and ballroom respectively. He also added an addition for a screened patio, guest rooms, and servants quarters. This ultimately gave Willowdale the form it has today. By 1944, Palmer had donated all of his land holdings in Massachusetts to the Commonwealth, leasing back the surrounding his mansion. The estate is now incorporated as part of the Bradley Palmer State Park. The mansion became a civil defense training academy, before it fell into disrepair and was eventually leased for renovation by the Department of Conservation and Recreation. Today it is operated as a premier events venue under the name Willowdale Estate. Death Bradley Palmer died on November 9, 1946 due to an unspecified pulmonary illness. Bradley Palmer's body lay in state at Willow Dale before being processing to Wilkes-Barre, PA. He was laid to rest in Hollenback Cemetery with his mother and father. Their tombstone also contains a memorial to Palmer's brother, Henry Palmer, who had died at sea just six days before Bradley Palmer. His body was never recovered.

Clan Chief, the Earl of Rothes From 1457 the Clan Chief of Clan Leslie also held the position of Earl of Rothes. The Chief is currently the Hon. Alexander Leslie, the brother of James Malcolm David Leslie, 22nd Earl of Rothes (born 1958). History =Origins= Coat of arms of Lords of Leslie The first Leslie in Aberdeenshire was Alexander who was appointed Constable of The Bass in Inverurie in 1080 on behalf of the king, his brother-in-law.Clan Leslie Origins, Clan Leslie Society Australia & New Zealand. The progenitor of the Clan Leslie is a man named Bartolf who was a nobleman from Hungary, who came to Scotland in 1067.Way, George and Squire, Romily. (1994). Collins Scottish Clan & Family Encyclopedia. (Foreword by The Rt Hon. The Earl of Elgin KT, Convenor, The Standing Council of Scottish Chiefs). pp. 194 ‚Äì 195. Bartolf was in the retinue of Edgar the √Ütheling, brother of Saint Margaret of Scotland, who was later the queen of Malcolm III of Scotland. Bartholf later married Malcolm III's sister, Princess Beatrix of Scotland. Bartolf was said to be a man of intellect and bravery and as a result Malcolm III made him governor of the royal Edinburgh Castle and gave him estates in Fife, Angus, the Mearns and Aberdeenshire. It is said that Bartolf helped the queen across a dangerous river on a horse and that Bartolf told her to \\"grip fast\\", which is where the Leslie family motto originates. Bartolf established himself in the Garioch district of Aberdeenshire, at a place then known as Lesselyn. At Lesselyn he built a castle and it is from there that the name evolved into Lesley, and the various spelling variations. Bartolf's son was named Malcolm and was made constable of the royal Inverury Castle, which he held for David II of Scotland. His great-grandson was Sir Norman Lesley who acquired the lands of Fythkill in Fife, which were later called Lesley, in about 1282. =14th to 15th centuries: Rothes and Balquhain= The family sided with Robert the Bruce against firstly The Comyn in the Buchan and secondly Edward I and as a result were awarded further tracts of Aberdeenshire. They fought at the Battle of Bannockburn. Sir Andrew de Lesly was one of the signatories of Declaration of Arbroath, was sent to the Pope in 1320 asserting Scotland's independence. His grandson, Walter died at the Battlew of Harlaw in 1411 together with six of his cousins from Balquhain.ScotWeb The chiefly line of the Clan Leslie passed to a junior branch of the family, from whom the present Earl of Rothes descends. In 1391, Sir Norman Lesley believed that his only son, David, had been killed in the Crusades, and therefore passed over his estates to his cousin, Sir George Lesley. Then in 1398, after George Lesley had taken possession of the castle and lands, David returned from the Crusades and claimed possession of his estate. The family managed to resolve the matter peacefully and in 1445 Sir George Lesley's grandson, also called George, was created a Lord of Parliament as Lord Lesley of Leven, and all of his lands were united into the barony of Ballinbreich. At some point before 1458, he was then advanced to the title of Earl of Rothes. =16th century= Rothes During the Anglo-Scottish Wars, George de Lesly was the Leslys' first Earl. His son George Leslie, the 2nd Earl, and his grandson were killed at the Battle of Flodden in 1513.The third Earl, also George, carried out a private family vendetta on the life of David Beaton, cardinal Archbishop of St Andrews. At the trial he was acquitted. George Leslie, 4th Earl of Rothes, was one of the Scottish commissioners at the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, as heir to the throne of France in 1558. George, along with the Earl of Cascillus and two others, died in mysterious circumstances, believed to be poisoning for refusing to allow the crown of Scotland to be settled on the Dauphin of France. Balquhain Fetternear which became the home of the Leslies of Balquhain, Wardes, and Warthill includes the remains of a 14th-century palace, home of Bishop Alexander Kininmund who, in 1320, drafted the Declaration of Arbroath, the letter sent to Pope John XXII in Avignon declaring that the Scots would never be subjected to English rule. It also incorporates the remains of even earlier palaces and sites of settlement dating back 4,000 years. John Leslie, Bishop of Ross was born in 1526. He was the most loyal of Mary, Queen of Scots's supporters during the turbulent times of 1562. It was John Leslie who wrote for her the famous History of Scotland. He, the second baron of Wardes, was awarded extensive lands in the Garioch from James IV and was five times married. He is now represented in the Garioch by the Leslies of Warthill descended from his second son. =17th century= During the 17th century, Lesleys fought in Germany, France, Sweden and in the Baltic as mercenaries. Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven, fought on the Continent and then returned to Scotland to command the Covenanter army. His seat was Balgonie Castle or the Tower of Balgonie, which he improved and extended. Alexander Leslie won a great victory over the English royalists at the Battle of Newburn in 1640.Edward Furgol, 'Beating the Odds: Alexander Leslie's 1640 Campaign in England' in Steve Murdoch and Andrew Mackillop (eds.), Fighting for Identity: Scottish Military Experience c.1550‚Äì1900 (Leiden, 2002), pp. 33‚Äì59. Wars of the Three Kingdoms Commanding the Covenanters Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven, and General Robert Monro captured Edinburgh Castle with a thousand men. With the Scots, Leven went into England in 1640 and defeated the King's soldiers at the Battle of Newburn. For this, he was created Earl of Lewis by King Charles I. General Alexander Leslie of Balgonie fought for Gustavus Adolphus, the King of Sweden. He achieved great fame across Europe for his skills in war and returned to Scotland a Field Marshal. In 1642, Leven went to Ireland and held command alongside Robert Munro (d. 1680) of the Scottish Army. They were sent to put down a rebellion of Irishmen who had killed Scots in Ulster. In 1644, Leven commanded Scottish Covenanter forces to victory over English Royalists at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644. This battle was the largest battle of the English and Scottish Civil War, and one of the most decisive. It resulted in a Parliamentarian victory, which meant that the north of England was effectively lost to King Charles for the rest of the war. During the Civil War, General David Leslie, Lord Newark, was victorious commanding his Scottish Covenanters force against a Scottish Royalist force at the Battle of Philiphaugh in 1645. The Royalist army of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, was destroyed by the Covenanter army of Sir David Leslie, restoring the power of the Committee of Estates. Dunaverty Castle was a MacDonald stronghold. During the Civil War, it was besieged in 1647 by Scottish supporters of Oliver Cromwell who were led by David Leslie, from Clan Leslie. The MacDonalds surrendered and then 300 of them were massacred. The castle is nothing more than a ruin now, known as Blood Rock. During the Civil War, David Leslie laid siege to the Royalist garrison at Kincardine Castle. The Castle was being held by the Chief of Clan MacNab. MacNab found that it would not be possible to maintain defense. During the night, sword in hand, at the head of 300 men, they cut their way through the besieging force. All made it through apart from the MacNab chief himself and one other man who were captured and sent to Edinburgh as prisoners of war. The chief was sentenced to death but he escaped and rejoined King Charles and continued to fight. Leslie's Scottish Covenanter force was defeated by the Scottish Parliamentarian forces who were at this point in time loyal to the Parliament of England and Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Dunbar (1650). Leslie successfully commanded the Scottish Argyll Government Royalist forces at the Battle of Carbisdale (1650) where he was victorious against Scottish Royalist forces commanded by James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose. Leslie's Royalist Forces were defeated at the Battle of Worcester in 1651. Leslie, who was now commanding Royalist forces, had supported the plan of fighting in Scotland, where royal support was strongest. King Charles, however, insisted on making the war in England. Leslie was captured and imprisoned in the Tower of London where he remained until the restoration of 1660. Balquhain The career of Walter Leslie (1607‚Äì1667) was all in Europe, where in the Thirty Years War he rose to prominence after leading the assassination of the Imperial generalissimo Wallenstein and his coterie in 1634, becoming a field marshal and imperial count.Worthington, David. Scots in Habsburg Service, 1618‚Äì1648, 2004, Brill, especially pp. 153‚Äì288, and see index. google books Sir Alexander Leslie of Auchintool was a general in the Russian army and was Governor of Smolensk. The seventh Earl of Rothes was created Duke of Rothes by Charles II in 1680. =18th century= John Hamilton-Leslie, 9th Earl of Rothes, was Vice Admiral of Scotland and governor of the royal Stirling Castle. During the Jacobite rising of 1715, he supported the British government and commanded a regiment of cavalry at the Battle of Sheriffmuir. He sold much of the clan estates but Leslie House near Fife remained the seat of the chiefly Earls until 1926.

During Palmer's life, the mansion hosted many events such as Palmer's Harvard class reunions, business and governmental meetings, and races for the nearby Myopia Hunt Club, of which Palmer was a member. Between 1997 and 2007, the building was restored by the Forsythe-Fandetti family as part of the state's historic curatorship program. It opened in 2007 under the name Willowdale Estate and may now be rented for a variety of different events including weddings and corporate occasions. Willowdale Estate also hosts a variety of public events each year including historical tours and holiday events. ;Trails Park trails are used for walking, hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and cross- country skiing. The park is crossed by the Bay Circuit Trail and Discover Hamilton Trail. To the park's north, trails in Willowdale State Forest can be reached via footbridge over the Ipswich River. The park is used as the home field for meets of the Masconomet Regional High School cross-country team. In the autumn, the neighboring horse farms conduct fox hunts (they bring their own fox). Sometimes equestrian meets are held there. Numerous hurdles are in evidence in the equestrian runs, which are periodically mowed. Horses brought in by trailer at will may usually be seen on any non-winter day, more so toward the autumn. ;Other The park also offers picnicking, canoeing, and fishing in addition to handicapped-accessible wading pool and restrooms. The former barn and garage facilities have been turned into a headquarters and maintenance center. Also on the grounds is a colonial farmhouse currently being restored and a caretaker's house.

In traditional Islamic law (sharia), the doctrine of qisas provides for a punishment analogous to the crime. Qisas is available to the victim or victim's heirs against a convicted perpetrator of murder or intentional bodily injury.Tahir Wasti (2009), The Application of Islamic Criminal Law in Pakistan: Sharia in Practice, Brill Academic, , pp. 12-13 In the case of murder, qisas gives the right to take the life of the killer, if the latter is convicted and the court approves.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Qisas (2012) Those who are entitled to qisas have the option of receiving monetary compensation (diyya) or granting pardon to the perpetrator instead. Qisas is one of several forms of punishment in traditional Islamic criminal jurisprudence, the others being Hudud and Ta'zir.Asghar Schirazi (1997), The Constitution of Iran : politics and the state in the Islamic Republic, I.B. Tauris London, pp. 222-225 The legal systems of Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and some Nigerian states currently provide for qisas. Islamic scriptures = Quran = The Qisas or equivalence verse in Quran is, The Qur'an allows the aggrieved party to receive monetary compensation (blood money, diyya, ) instead of qisas,Christie S. Warren, Islamic Criminal Law, Oxford University Press, Qisas or forfeit the right of qi·π£ƒÅ·π£ as an act of charity or in atonement for the victim family's past sins. = Hadith = The Hadiths have extensive discussion of qisas. For example, Sahih Bukhari states, Many premodern Islamic scholars ruled that only diya (blood money) and not qisas was available when the victim was a non-Muslim dhimmi and to non-Muslim slaves owned by a Muslim, based on hadith.Anver M. Emon (2012), Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law, Oxford University Press, , pp. 237-249; Quote \\"Muslim jurists defended this discriminatory application of qisas liability by reference to a hadith in which the Prophet said: 'A believer is not killed for an unbeliever or one without a covenant during his residency.' Jurists who constructed discriminatory rules of liability relied on the first half of the hadith. Furthermore, they argued that these discriminatory rules reflected the fact that Muslims were of a higher class than their non-Muslim co-residents.\\"; Quote 2 \\"Furthermore, using the logical inference of a minore ad maius, Al- Mawardi held that just as a Muslim bears no liability for sexually slandering a dhimmi, he cannot be liable for killing one, a much more serious offense. Traditional jurisprudence Traditional Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) treats homicide as a civil dispute,Tahir Wasti (2009), The Application of Islamic Criminal Law in Pakistan: Sharia in Practice, Brill Academic, , pp. 283-288 rather than an act requiring corrective punishment by the state to maintain order. In all cases of murder, unintentional homicide, bodily injury and property damage, under traditional Islamic law, the prosecutor is not the state, but only the victim or the victim's heir (or owner, in the case when the victim is a slave). Qisas can only be demanded by the victim or victim's heirs.Rudolph Peters (2006), Crime and Punishment in Islamic Law, Cambridge University Press, , pp. 44-49, 114, 186-187 According to classical jurists of the Shafi'i, Maliki and Hanbali schools, qisas is available only when the victim is Muslim, while the Hanafi school took a different stance on this point.Majid Khadduri and Herbert J. Liebesny, Law in the Middle East: Origin and Development of Islamic Law, 2nd Edition, Lawbook Exchange, , pp. 337-345Rudolph Peters and Peri Bearman (2014), The Ashgate Research Companion to Islamic Law, , pp. 169-170J. Norman D. Anderson (2007), Islamic Law in Africa, Routledge, , pp. 372-373 In the early history of Islam, there were considerable disagreements in Muslim jurist opinions on applicability of Qisas and Diyya when a Muslim murdered a non-Muslim (Dhimmi, Musta'min or slave).Tahir Wasti (2009), The Application of Islamic Criminal Law in Pakistan: Sharia in Practice, Brill, , pp. 89-90 Most scholars of Hanafi school of fiqh ruled that, if a Muslim killed a dhimmi or a slave, Qisas (retaliation) was applicable against the Muslim, but this could be averted by paying a Diyya.Rudolph Peters and Peri Bearman (2014), The Ashgate Research Companion to Islamic Law, , pp. 129-137 In one case, the Hanafi jurist Abu Yusuf initially ordered Qisas when a Muslim killed a dhimmi, but under Caliph Harun al-Rashid's pressure replaced the order with Diyya if the victim's family members were unable to prove the victim was paying jizya willingly as a dhimmi.Yohanan Friedmann (2006), Tolerance and Coercion in Islam: Interfaith Relations in the Muslim Tradition, Cambridge University Press, , pp. 42-43 According to Fatawa-e-Alamgiri, a 17th-century compilation of Hanafi fiqh in South Asia, a master who kills his slave should not face capital punishment under the retaliation doctrine.SC Sircar, , pp. 276-278 Non-Hanafi jurists have historically ruled that Qisas does not apply against a Muslim, if he murders any non-Muslim (including dhimmi) or a slave for any reason. Both Shafi'i and Maliki fiqh doctrines maintained, notes Friedmann, that the Qisas only applies when there is \\"the element of equality between the perpetrator and the victim\\"; Qisas is not available to an infidel victim when the crime's perpetrator is a Muslim because \\"equality does not exist between a Muslim and an infidel, and Muslims are exalted above the infidels\\".Yohanan Friedmann (2006), Tolerance and Coercion in Islam: Interfaith Relations in the Muslim Tradition, Cambridge University Press, , pp. 45-46, Quote: \\"(...) maintained that the element of equality which is inherent in the concept of qisas \\"does not exist between a Muslim and an infidel because infidelity lowered his standing and diminished his rank\\" (wa la musawat bayna al-muslim wa al-kafir fa-inna al-kufr hatta manzilatahu wa wada'a martabatahu). Perceiving Muslims as exalted above the infidels is, again, the conceptual basis for determining the law.\\" According to Hanbali legal school, if a Muslim kills or harms a non- Muslim, even if intentionally, Qisas does not apply, and the sharia court may only impose a Diyya (monetary compensation) with or without a prison term on the Muslim at its discretion. The Maliki fiqh also forbids applying Qisas against a Muslim if the victim is a dhimmi, but has ruled that the Muslim may be killed if the murder was treacherous. If the killing, bodily or property damage was unintentional, the compensation to a non-Muslim was declared to be half of what would be due for an equivalent damage to a Muslim. The Shafi'i fiqh was similar to Hanbali fiqh, and Qisas did not apply if the victim was a non-Muslim; additionally, Shafi'i jurists held that the compensation for the victim's heirs should be a third of what would be due in case the victim was a Muslim. According to Hanafi school, neither Qisas nor Diyya applied against a Muslim or a dhimmi who killed a Musta'min (foreigner visiting) who did not enjoy permanent protection in Dar al-Islam and may take up arms against Muslims after returning to his homeland (dar al-harb).Yohanan Friedmann (2006), Tolerance and Coercion in Islam: Interfaith Relations in the Muslim Tradition, Cambridge University Press, , pp. 42-51 Neither Qisas nor any other form of compensation applied in case the victim was an apostate (converted from Islam to another religion), a person who has committed the hadd crime of transgression against Islam or Imam (baghy), or a non-Muslim who did not accept himself or herself as a Dhimmi, or if the non-Muslim victim's family could not prove that the victim had paid Jizya regularly.Yohanan Friedmann (2006), Tolerance and Coercion in Islam: Interfaith Relations in the Muslim Tradition, Cambridge University Press, , pp. 42-50Richard Terrill (2012), World Criminal Justice Systems: A Comparative Survey, Routledge, , pp. 554-562 Muslim jurists justified the discriminatory application of Qisas between Muslims and non-Muslims by referring to the following hadith.Anver M. Emon (2012), Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law, Oxford University Press, , pp. 237-250 Numerous Hanafi, Shafi'i and Maliki jurists stated that a Muslim and a non-Muslim are neither equal nor of same status under sharia, and thus the judicial process and punishment applicable must vary. Current practice Qi·π£ƒÅ·π£ is currently provided for by legal systems of several countries which apply traditional Islamic jurisprudence (Saudi Arabia) or have enacted qisas laws as part of modern legal reforms. =Iran= Through sections 1 through 80 of Iran's penal code, Qisas have been enacted as one of the methods of punishment.A Guide to the Legal System of the Islamic Republic of Iran , March 2006Islamic Penal Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran , Book 3 Iran penal code outlines two types of Qisas crime - Qisas for life, and Qisas for part of human body.Shahid M. Shahidullah, Comparative Criminal Justice Systems: Global and Local Perspectives, , pp. 425-426 In cases of qisas for life, the victim's family may with the permission of court, take the life of the murderer. In cases of qisas for part of human body, section 55 of Iran's penal code grants the victim or victim's family to, with permission of the court, inflict an equal injury to the perpetrator's body. If the victim lost the right hand and perpetrator does not have a right hand for qisas, then with court's permission, the victim may cut the left hand of the perpetrator. In one episode, qi·π£ƒÅ·π£ was demanded by Ameneh Bahrami, an Iranian woman blinded in an acid attack. She demanded that her attacker Majiv Movahedi be blinded as well.\\"In Iran, a case of an eye for an eye\\" Phillie Metro March 29, 2009 In 2011, Bahrami retracted her demand on the day the sentence was to be carried out, requesting instead that her attacker be pardoned.\\"Iranian sentenced to be blinded for acid attack is pardoned\\" (BBC News, 31 July 2011) A prisoner lodged in the Gohardasht Prison of the city of Karaj, was reported to have been blinded in March 2015 after being convicted for an acid attack on another man in 2009 and sentenced to the punishment under \\"qisas\\". =Pakistan= Pakistan introduced Qisas and Diyat in 1990 as Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Ordinance, after the Shariat Appellate Bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan declared that the lack of Qisas and Diyat were repugnant to the injunctions of Islam as laid down by the Quran and Sunnah.Federation of Pakistan v. Gul Hasan Khan, PLD 1989 SC 633‚Äì685, affirming PLD 1980 Pesh 1‚Äì20 and PLD 1980 FSC 1‚Äì60 Pakistani parliament enacted the law of Qisas and Diyat as Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1997.see PPC ss. 299‚Äì338-H; Tahir Wasti (2009), The Application of Islamic Criminal Law in Pakistan: Sharia in Practice, , Brill, p. 8 An offender may still be punished despite pardoning by way of ta'zƒ´r or if not all the persons entitled to Qisas joined in the compromise.Pakistan Penal Code s. 311; Azmat and another v. The State, PLD 2009 Supreme Court of Pakistan 768 The Pakistan Penal Code modernized the Hanafi doctrine of qisas and diya by eliminating distinctions between Muslims and non-Muslims. =Nigeria= Since the 1960s, several northern states of Nigeria have enacted sharia-based criminal laws, including provisions for Qisas. These codes have been applied in the Sharia Courts of Nigeria to Muslims. Many have been sentenced to retaliation under the Qisas principle, as well as to other punishments such as hudud and tazir.G.J. Weimann (2007), \\"Judicial Practice in Islamic Criminal Law in Nigeria 2000 to 2004‚ÄîA Tentative Overview,\\" Islamic Law & Society, 14(2), pp. 240‚Äì286I.K. Oraegbunam (2012), Penal Jurisprudence under Islamic Criminal Justice: Implications for the Right to Human Dignity in Nigerian Constitution, Journal Islamic State Practices in Int'l Law, 8, pp. 31-49 =Saudi Arabia= Murder and manslaughter are private offenses in Saudi Arabia, which a victim or victim's heirs must prosecute, or accept monetary compensation, or grant pardon. The sharia courts in Saudi Arabia apply Qisas to juvenile cases, with previous limit of 7 year raised to 12 year age limit, for both boys or girls.Child Rights International Network (March 2013), Inhuman sentencing of children in Saudi Arabia, 17th session of the Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review; Don Cipriani (2009), Children‚Äôs Rights and the Minimum Age of Criminal Responsibility, Farnham: Ashgate Publishing, This age limit is not effectively enforced, and the court can assess a child defendant's physical characteristics to decide if he or she should be tried as an adult. In most cases, a person who satisfies at least one of the following four characteristics is considered as an adult for Qisas cases: (1) above the age of 15, (2) has wet dreams (al-ihtilam), (3) any appearance of pubic hair, or (4) start of menstruation. Qisas principle, when enforced in Saudi Arabia, means equal retaliation and damage on the defendant.Human Rights Watch (2008), The Last Holdouts, Juvenile Death Penalty in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Pakistan and Yemen, , pp. 7-9; Archived summary According to reports in Saudi media, in 2013, a court in Saudi Arabia sentenced a defendant to have his spinal cord severed to paralyze him, unless he paid one million Saudi riyals (about US$270,000) in Diyya compensation to the victim. The offender allegedly stabbed his friend in the back, rendering him paralysed from the waist down in or around 2003. Other reported sentences of qisas in KSA have included eye gouging, tooth extraction, and death in cases of murder.Saudi Arabia: News of paralysis sentence \\"outrageous\\" Amnesty International (2 April 2013) Qisas and honor crimes According to most variations of Islamic Law, Qisas doesn't apply if a Muslim parent or grandparent kills their child or grandchild, or if the murder victim is a spouse with whom one has surviving children. The culprit can be, however, subject to Diyya (financial compensation) which is payable to the surviving heirs of the victims or punished through Tazir which is a Fixed punishment given by the Judge or Ruler. Sara Hossain and Lynn Welchman (2005), 'Honour': Crimes, Paradigms and Violence Against Women, , pp. 85-86 The four major schools of Sunni Sharia have been divided on applicability of Qisas when the victim is a child, and the father is the murderer. The Hanafi, Shafi'i and Hanbali Sunni sharias have ruled that Qisas does not apply, as has the Shia Sharia doctrine. The Maliki school, however, has ruled that Qisas may be demanded by the mother if a father kills his son.Tahir Wasti (2009), The Application of Islamic Criminal Law in Pakistan: Sharia in Practice, Brill, , p. 90 The Hanafi, Hanbali and Shafi'i sharia extend this principle to cases when the victim is a child and the mother or grandparents are the murderers.Al-Misri (Translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller), Reliance of the Traveller, , Ruling O:1.2, Quote: \\"The following are not subject to retaliation: (2) a Muslim for killing a non-Muslim; (4) a father or mother (or their fathers or mothers) for killing their offpsring, or offspring's offpsring; (5) nor is retaliation permissible to a descendant such as when his father kills his mother\\"Tahir Wasti (2009), The Application of Islamic Criminal Law in Pakistan: Sharia in Practice, Brill, Scholars suggest that this exemption of parents and relatives from Qisas, and the treatment of homicide-related Qisas as a civil dispute that should be handled privately by victim's family under sharia doctrine, encourages honor crimes, particularly against females, as well as allows the murderer(s) to go unpunished.Stephanie Palo (2008), A Charade of Change: Qisas and Diyat Ordinance Allows Honor Killings to Go Unpunished in Pakistan, UC Davis Journal Int'l Law & Policy, 15, pp. 93-99RA Ruane (2000), Murder in the Name of Honor: Violence Against Women in Jordan and Pakistan. Emory Int'l Law Review, 14, pp. 1523-1532Hannah Irfan (2008), Honor Related Violence Against Women in Pakistan, World Justice Forum, Vienna July 2‚Äì5, pp. 9-12 This, state Devers and Bacon, is why many honor crimes are not reported to the police, nor handled in the public arena.Lindsey Devers and Sarah Bacon (2010), Interpreting Honor Crimes: The Institutional Disregard Towards Female Victims of Family Violence in the Middle East, International Journal of Criminology and Sociological Theory, Vol. 3, No. 1, June 2010, pp. 359-371Sharbanoo Keshavarz (2006), Honor Killing in Iran: a Legal Point of View, Yearbook of Islamic & Middle East Law (2006-2007), Vol 13, pp. 87-103 Historically, Sharia did not stipulate any punishment against the accused when the victim is the child or the spouse of the murderer, but in modern times some Sharia-based Muslim countries have introduced laws that grant courts the discretion to impose imprisonment of the murderer. However, the victim's heirs have the right to waive Qisas, seek Diyat, or pardon the killer.Shahid M. Shahidullah (2012), Comparative Criminal Justice Systems: Global and Local Perspectives, , pp. 511 Eye for an eye A legal concept similar to Qisas is the principle of Eye for an eye first recorded in the Code of Hammurabi.

Palaeolagus lived in the Oligocene period which was about 33-23 million years ago. The earliest leporids described from the fossil record of North America and Asia date to the upper Eocene some 40 million years ago. Taxonomy The fossil remains of rabbits are scanty and those specimens that have been found are often too fragmentary to determine satisfactory the relationship with living forms. The bones of rabbits and hares are lightweight and fragile in structure, and so they are not easily preserved as fossils. Most of the species are inhabitants of uplands where conditions are not ideal for preservation. In a few deposits, rabbit remains seem numerous but many fossil species are known only from a few teeth and bones. Description The long creature closely resembled modern rabbits.

PPR is currently present in North, Central, West and East Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia. It is caused by small ruminants morbillivirus in the genus Morbillivirus, and is closely related to, among others, rinderpest morbillivirus, measles morbillivirus, and canine morbillivirus (previously known as canine distemper virus). The disease is highly contagious, and can have an 80‚Äì100% mortality rate in acute cases in an epidemic setting. This virus does not infect humans. This disease was first described in 1942 in C√¥te d'Ivoire. Now, PPR has spread to more than 70 countries in the world. In 2017, the disease was reported to be affecting saiga in Mongolia, causing near-catastrophic herd depletion for the endangered species. In 2018, the disease was reported to be in Bulgaria close to the border with Turkey.  Synonyms  PPR is also known as goat plague, kata, syndrome of stomatitis-pneumoenteritis, and ovine rinderpest. Official agencies such as the FAO and OIE use the French name \\"peste des petits ruminants\\" with several spelling variants.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms are similar to those of rinderpest in cattle and involves oral necrosis, mucopurulent nasal and ocular discharges, cough, pneumonia, and diarrhea, though they vary according to the previous immune status of the sheep, the geographic location, the time of year, or if the infection is new or chronic. They also vary according to the breed of sheep. However, fever in addition to either diarrhea or signs of oral discomfort is sufficient to suspect the diagnosis. Incubation period is 3-5 days. = Hyperacute cases = Hyperacute cases are found dead without previous symptoms. They die with a serous, foamy, or haemorrhagic discharge coming out of the nose. = Acute cases at onset = In acute cases, animals are recumbent, sometimes in self-auscultation position. Body temperature is high (40.5 to 41 ¬∞C) in the beginning of the onset in acute cases. The most typical signs are seen in the digestive tract. When entering an affected flock, one sees many animals with hind limbs stained by sticky faeces. Some sheep have an arched back and show pain when defecating. Tenesmus may be noticed when taking rectal temperature. Fluid faeces are olive green to brown. Examination of the mouth shows ulceration of the buccal mucosae, especially on the inner face of the lips, and neighboring gum. There can be periodontitis or serous nasal exudate and conjunctivitis. = Evolution of acute cases = Nasal discharge becomes mucopurulent and may obstruct the nose. A dry, fitful coughing develops. Death occurs from 5 to 10 days after the onset of the fever. Some animals may recover, but a dry, stertorous coughing often persists for some days.J. Berrada, Observations des premiers cas confirm√©s de peste des petits ruminants au Maroc, oral presentation, El Jadida, 31-07-2008.

Four genotypes (lineages) of the virus are described. Their classification is based on the nucleoprotein (N) or previously the fusion (F) protein gene. Lineages I and II are found mainly in West Africa. Lineage III is generally found in East Africa. Lineage IV was long known as the Asian lineage, but has now spread to the African continent and become the most prevalent lineage of all. Epidemiology =Origin and spread= This virus appears to have evolved at the start of the 20th century in Nigeria. The extant genotypes subsequently appeared in West Africa (lineages I and II), East Africa and Arabia (lineage III), and Pakistan‚ÄìIndia (lineage IV). The first description of the disease was published in 1942 and relates to an outbreak in C√¥te d‚ÄôIvoire, West Africa, in goats and sheep in 1940.Dhar P, Sreenivasa BP, Barrett T, Corteyn M, Singh RP, Bandyopadhyay SK (2002) Recent epidemiology of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV). Vet Microbiol 88(2):153‚Äì159 It spread to East Africa and Arabia at the beginning of the 1980s and to Pakistan and India in the early 1990s (Calcutta goat markets) finally reaching Tibet in 2007. The first description of this virus in India was in 1987. The outbreak in Burkina Faso in 1999 was caused by the lineage I group. Genotype III has caused outbreaks in Ethiopia (1996) and also in Arabia, southern India, and Tamil Nadu (1992). This lineage was found in Yemen in 2001. Genotype IV has been isolated in Kuwait in 1999. = Geographical repartition = As of 2017, the disease is present in West Africa, part of Central Africa (Gabon, Central African Republic), East Africa (north of the Equator), the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent including Nepal and Myanmar. The disease is endemic in the Indian subcontinent and is a major threat to fast-growing goat husbandry in India, causing an annual loss of around 1800 million Indian rupees. In North Africa, only Egypt was once hit, but since summer 2008, Morocco is suffering a generalized outbreak with 133 known cases in 129 provinces, mostly affecting sheep. The outbreak has precipitated the vaccination of a large number of the 17 million sheep and five million goats in the country. = Dissemination = The disease is transmitted by infected aerosols in situation of close contact of animals. The long-distance spread is by sick animals. As the virus soon becomes inactive outside the body, indirect contamination is generally limited. In an affected flock, even in pest-free regions, the disease does not progress very rapidly, in spite of the close contact between animals. New clinical cases may be observed daily for a 1-month period.L. Mahin (2008) Observations sur un foyer de Peste des petits ruminants, unpublished data.  Post mortem lesions  The lesions are situated in the digestive tract. Quick post mortem examination will lead to the discovery of many haemorrhagic patches on the serous membranes, and intense pneumonia. A risk exists that it may conclude with enzootic pneumonia, inability to open the mouth, and problems with the oesophagus and different parts of the intestine. Erosions and inflammation are widespread on buccal mucosa. The same lesions are also present in pharynx, oesophagus, and on mucus-producing epithelia of the gut, from abomasum to rectum. Zebra-striped lesions on coecum and colon are said to be typical in some cases. Rarely, also petechiae are on the rumen mucosa.Tligui, Observations n√©cropsiques sur les premiers cas confirm√©s de peste des petits ruminants au Maroc, oral presentation, El Jadida, 31-07-2008. Diagnosis History and clinical signs enable a presumptive diagnosis to be made in endemic regions. The virus can be detected in acute cases from various swabs and blood samples, using PCR and ELISA. Antibodies can also be detected by ELISA. Treatment and control Antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, penicillin, and streptomycin can be used and supportive treatment may be helpful. Additionally, a vaccine has been developed that may decrease death in the flock. Movement restrictions and slaughter of affected flocks may be required in an attempt to eradicate the disease.

It is used in historical texts referring to the Irish and Scottish kings, and those of similar rank. While the Modern Irish word is exactly the same,Niall √ì D√≥naill: \\"Focl√≥ir Gaeilge-B√©arla\\" in modern Scottish Gaelic it is r√¨gh, apparently derived from the genitive. Cognates include Gaulish Rix, Latin rex/regis, Spanish rey,https://dle.rae.es/rey?m=form French roi,http://stella.atilf.fr/Dendien/scripts/tlfiv5/visusel.exe?11;s=300828855;r=1;nat=;sol=0; Sanskrit raja, and German Reich. There were three grades of r√≠: a ruir√≠ or \\"overking\\" was a major, regional king and superior to a r√≠ tuatha \\"king of tribes\\" or a r√≠ buiden \\"king of bands\\" either of whom, in turn, were superior to several figures known as r√≠ benn \\"king of peaks\\" or r√≠ tuath \\"king of a tribe\\". Three traditional grades The three traditional grades of r√≠ in Gaelic Ireland was largely symbolic. As time went on, the real power of many lesser kings could equal or even eclipse those of higher grade. =R√≠ benn= A r√≠ benn (king of peaks), or r√≠ tuaithe (king of a single tribe), was most commonly a local petty king of a single t√∫ath, although \\"one\\" t√∫ath might be many times the size of another. There are generally estimated to have been between 100 and 150 in Ireland, depending on who really qualified. Importantly, in theory every king of a superior grade was also a ri benn himself, and exercised no direct compulsory legal authority outside his own ancestral t√∫ath.Byrne, p. 41 Kings were bound to others by military allegiance and the payment of tribute. Examples: * Kings of Thira Dha Locha * Kings of Umaill =Ri buiden= A ri buiden (king of bands), also ri tuath (king of [many] tribes) or ruiri (overking), was a regional king to whom several r√≠ benn were subordinate, and often other territories. He was in some sense still a petty king, but could also achieve provincial-level prominence, including, although rarely, the provincial kingship, and was often fully sovereign in any case. Depending on who was counted, there may have been as many as 20 genuine ruiri in Ireland at any one time. Examples: * Kings of Osraige * Kings of Breifne * Kings of U√≠ Maine * Kings of Moylurg * Kings of Iar Connacht =R√≠ ruirech= A \\"king of over-kings\\", a r√≠ ruirech was often a provincial (r√≠ c√≥icid) or semi-provincial king to whom several ruiri were subordinate. They were also referred to as ri bunaid cach cinn (\\"ultimate king of every individual\\"). Several kingdoms belonging to the 1st and 2nd millennia are listed below, but do not all belong to the same periods. No more than six genuine r√≠ ruirech were ever contemporary, with the average being three or four. Originally, there were only five provinces, at least according to legend (see the T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge, the actual text thereof). Examples: * Kings of Ulster * Kings of Munster * Kings of Mide * Kings of Connacht * Kings of Leinster Ard R√≠ The ard r√≠, or \\"High King\\" (of Ireland), was traditionally the supreme ruler of all the Irish provinces, subject to no higher domestic authority. While the r√≠ ruirech were in theory subordinate to the high king, Irish stories and mythology relate that the power of the high king varied considerably throughout the office's existence, and he was usually not more than a figurehead exercising suzerainty over the largely independent lower kingdoms. According to tradition, the high king was originally crowned at Lia F√°il upon the Hill of Tara in Meath, in the Kingdom of Leinster. When stood upon by a candidate for the throne, if they were the rightful High King of Ireland, the stone monument was said to loudly roar in joy. The stone was supposedly split by the sword of Cuchulain when it refused to acknowledge his preferred candidate Lugaid Riab nDerg, following which it never called out again. * High King of Ireland In Scotland, the Ard R√≠ initially had very little centralized power. Instead, he exercised suzerainty over the lower kingdoms, much like his Irish counterpart. This would change as Scotland combined into a more centralized state, and the High King gathered more power over regional monarchs. This was to the point where the regional Kings were referred to as 'Earls' by the English rather than the proper term, R√≠. *High King of Scotland *Style of the monarchs of Scotland Scotland Scotland had a variety of r√≠ as well. In addition to the monarch or \\"high king\\" there were others, although these are conventionally styled only \\"lords\\" in the English language. * Lord of the Isles * Lords of Galloway * Lords of Argyle There were also a number of Kings of Moray, who are commonly styled mormaers in later Scottish tradition, but properly styled r√≠ in contemporary Irish sources. The famous Macbeth of Scotland is argued to have begun his career as Ruiri of Moray. (Cowan, p. 119) A number of Scottish monarchs styled themselves 'High King of Scotland,' 'High King of Picts,' or 'High King of Alba,' using the following variants of the term 'Ard R√≠': Ard R√≠g To√≠ Ardr√≠ Aird-R√≠ Airdr√≠gh Airdr√≠ Other than the Irish/Scottish Gaelic titles, some styled themselves in latin: Scottorum Basileus Rex omnium prouiciarum Pictorum (King of All the Provinces of the Picts) See also * White Wand * Flaith * Tigerna * Irish nobility * Ollam * R√≠g (Norse god) Notes References * Bhreathnach, Edel (ed.), The Kingship and Landscape of Tara.

The reservation features a hardwood forest, two freshwater lakes, a winding stretch of the Saugus River, and scenic views of Boston and rural New England from rocky hilltops. The park is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation. History ;Native Americans Archaeological evidence shows that hunting, camping, and fishing took place along the Saugus River as far back as the Paleo-Indians and continuing through the Archaic and Woodland periods. ;Colonial period In 1666, John Gifford, the second general agent of the Saugus Iron Works, who had left the company over a dispute with its creditors, purchased 260 acres along the Saugus River from Thomas Breedon of Boston for ¬£260. He established his own iron works on the site, which closed in 1675 due to the economic downturn caused by King Philip's War. Gifford's site later housed a sawmill (1703‚Äì1740), wire-manufacturing operation (1814‚Äì1828), a snuff-grinding mill (1837‚Äì1871), and a second sawmill (1871‚Äì1902). ;The Six- Hundred Acres In 1706, the land (known as the Six-Hundred Acres) was divided among the male settlers. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the land remained largely unchanged. Most of the land was passed down through the same families. Most landowners resided off of the property and used the land for firewood, if at all. In 1814, a fieldstone milldam was constructed downstream from the Gifford site to provide power for the Linen and Duck Manufactory Company of Boston. The mill closed after the War of 1812 due to a decline in the demand for sailcloth; however, the dam still exists. ;Breakheart Hill Forest In 1891, Benjamin Newhall Johnson, Micajah Clough, and John Bartlett of Lynn began purchasing land in the Six-Hundred Acres for use as a hunting retreat. They created Upper Pond (today's Silver Lake) and Lower Pond (today's Pearce Lake), stocked them with fish, and named their property Breakheart Hill Forest. Johnson purchased a log cabin in Maine, numbered all of its parts, and brought it down to Breakheart Hill, where it was rebuilt on the shore of Lower Pond. On June 12, 1891 the retreat was officially opened. In the early 1900s, the partners increased the size of the property. ;Breakheart Hill Farm The Six- Hundred Acres was also home to Breakheart Hill Farm, an 18-acre farm. It was first owned by the Hitchings family, who sold it to Thomas Houghton for $375 in 1830. Four years later, it was sold to Artemas Edmands for $400. In 1892, Edmands' grandson sold it to the Breakheart Hill Forestry, run by Johnson and his associates, for $1. After purchasing the land, Johnson hired George Parrott to farm the land and keep out trespassers. In 1897, Parrott was succeeded by George E. Bailey. In May 1900, Bailey hired John C. Best to assist him on the property. On October 8, 1900, after a dispute, Best shot and killed Bailey. He then dismembered Bailey's body, placed the pieces in burlap bags, drove Bailey's carriage down to Floating Bridge Pond in Lynn, and dumped the bags in the pond. After a sensational trial, Best was found guilty and executed in the electric chair at Charlestown State Prison. Bailey was succeeded as caretaker of Breakheart Hill by Henry Cole. On April 12, 1901, Cole left home and was never seen again. He and his wife had an argument before he left and she believed that he had not returned because he had tired of his family situation. After Cole's disappearance, George Parker took over as caretaker and remained on the farm until his death in 1923. ;State ownership In 1934, the executors for Johnson and Clough sold the Breakheart Hill Forest to the Metropolitan District Commission for $40,000. The MDC then turned the land over to the Civilian Conservation Corps. Over the course of six years, the CCC built roads and trails, planted trees, and restored the dams at Upper Pond and Lower Pond. The CCC's efforts resulted in the return of wildlife that had become rare in Breakheart, including beavers, fishers, coyotes, blue herons, and owls. Breakheart was opened to the public in 1936. Activities and amenities Hiking trail at Breakheart in autumn *Visitor center: The park is headquartered at the Christopher P. Dunne Visitor Center which opened in 2004. In addition to restrooms, educational programs and information, the center has displays and exhibits that introduce aspects of the forest's wildlife and human history. *Swimming: The beach at the north end of Pearce Lake also has a first aid station during the summer months. *Trails: Trails are available for hiking, mountain biking, and cross-country skiing. *The park also offers fishing, orienteering, a tot lot, and a play area for dogs and their owners, Bark Place. Breakheart Parkways On August 11, 2003, the Breakheart Reservation Parkways (officially registered as Breakheart Reservation Parkways-Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston) were added to the National Register of Historic Places. The parkways consist of Forest Street, Pine Tops Road, Elm Road, and Hemlock Road. The parkways are under the jurisdiction of the Department of Conservation and Recreation, which also controls Lynn Fells Parkway in Melrose and Saugus. In December 2002, the Massachusetts Historical Commission voted to nominate both the Lynn Fells Parkway and the Breakheart Reservation Parkways to the Keeper of the National Register, but only the Breakheart Reservation Parkways were added to the Register that year. (The Lynn Fells Parkway was separately added to the national register in 2003.) The system was designed by Charles Eliot.

Created by writer Greg Pak and artist Carlo Pagulayan, the character first appeared in Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #93 during the \\"Planet Hulk\\" storyline. Taika Waititi portrays Korg, through the use of motion capture, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe films Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Avengers: Endgame (2019) and will return in Thor: Love and Thunder (2022). Publication history Created by Greg Pak and Carlo Pagulayan, Korg was inspired by Thor's origin story and was later retconned in Incredible Hulk #94 into one of the stone creatures that fought Thor in Journey into Mystery #83 released in 1962. Fictional character biography Korg is part of the Kronan race seen in Journey into Mystery #83. After his defeat at the hands of Thor when the Stone Men tried to invade Earth, Korg became a prisoner of the Red King on the alien planet of Sakaar. He was forced into slavery by an obedience disk and made to fight for his life in the gladiatorial arenas. Korg was made to kill his brother Margus against his will, a fact that continues to haunt Korg. When the Hulk was exiled to the Red King's planet, Korg became the Hulk's ally after he and five others were victorious during one of the gladiator games that rule on the planet as a form of entertainment. Korg was the first to let the group talk to each other, and after more victories in the game, Korg became a gladiator. Still fighting alongside the Hulk, Korg was part of the group that rebelled against the Red King after the Silver Surfer used his Power Cosmic to destroy the disks that controlled the slaves. The Surfer had also been made a slave by such a disk, but it was destroyed by the Hulk when they were forced to battle (in the film adaptation, it was Beta Ray Bill, not the Silver Surfer, using the lightning powers of his hammer, Stormbreaker, to perform this feat). After the detonation of Sakaar, Korg convinces Hiroim (who has lost hope and wanted to stay and die) to come with him on the space ship. Korg was with the Hulk and the others and managed to knockout Wonder Man. However, after the discovery that Miek had triggered the destruction of Sakaar, Korg and the other surviving Warbound surrendered to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, only to escape when earthquakes began to tear Manhattan Island apart due to the damage the Hulk had caused. Working with fellow Warbound member Hiroim and Earth hero Thing, Korg was able to heal the damage caused to the island, before he and his fellow Warbound retreated into the sewers. Korg is also featured in World War Hulk: Frontline as a detective of sorts and is partnered up with a New York detective when investigating the death of Arch-E-5912. In the Avengers: The Initiative issue of World War Hulk, Korg is confronted by his fear when Trauma comes to rescue his fellow Cadets: Korg's worst fear is the Thunder god Thor. In the miniseries Warbound, he helps in the defeat of the Leader who has turned a city in the middle of the desert into a new Gamma World but at the cost of Hiroim's life. During the \\"World War Hulks\\" storyline, Bruce Banner calls on Korg's help when Leader and MODOK transform an army and many of Earth's heroes into \\"Hulks\\", helping subdue them. During the 2010‚Äì2011 \\"Chaos War\\" storyline, Korg ends up helping the Hulks and A-Bomb fight a resurrected Abomination and the forces of Amatsu- Mikaboshi. When the Zom part of Doctor Strange is awakened by Amatsu- Mikaboshi, Marlo Chandler ends up using the death fragment to resurrect some of Hulk's allies. One of them is Hiroim as it is shown that Korg and Hiroim had a relationship (although Korg's people have no separate genders). During the 2016 \\"Civil War II\\" storyline, Korg was with the Warbound when they receive word that Bruce Banner is dead. When at Bruce's funeral, Korg stated how Hulk wanted to be left alone and how he made allies that were like family to him. When the Skrullduggers were emerging from a portal to Weirdworld in a Roxxon facility, Korg appeared to help the Brood-infected human Blake and Roxxon's Man-Thing in preventing the Skrullduggers from emerging from the portal. This was confirmed when Weapon H and Dario Agger came to check up on Blake and Man-Thing.Weapon H #7. Marvel Comics. Three days ago, Korg saves some soldiers from the Skrullduggers. His inner monologue states that he came to Weirdworld after hearing that Hulk is back from the dead. In the present, Korg learns from Dario Agger that the Roxxon soldiers are safe in a bunker in Weirdworld. As Weapon H leads the mission to Weirdworld, they are attacked by a tribe of blue-skinned humanoids called the Inaku who blame them for breaking the Earth and allowing the Skrullduggers to take their queen.Weapon H #8. Marvel Comics. After Weapon H frees his fellow captives, he has Korg and Titania stay behind to help Man-Thing fortify the Inaku village in case the Skrullduggers show up while Weapon H, Angel, and Blake go on a stealth mission to the Roxxon outpost. He and Titania help the Inaku set up a pit filled with spikes that are coated in berry poison.Weapon H #9. Marvel Comics. When the Skrullduggers attack, Man-Thing, Korg, and Titania assist the Inaku in defending their fortified village from the Skrullduggers until they suddenly go in one direction.Weapon H #10. Marvel Comics. Korg, Man-Thing, Titania find Weapon H with the Skrullduggers under Morgan le Fay's control as they attack the Inaku village. Thinking that Weapon H is in a battle frenzy, Korg reminds Titania that Weapon H is part-Hulk. When Morgan le Fay of Earth-15238 shows up and is identified as a queen to the Inaku, Titania and Korg are attacked by Protector Hara, the Skrullduggers, and Weapon H. Korg faces off against Weapon H.Weapon H #11. Marvel Comics. Korg and Titania catch up to Weapon H where they find that Dario has transformed into Minotaur. When everyone evacuates through the portal during Minotaur's fight with Morgan le Fay, Korg carries Sonia through the portal. After Dario pays them the terms of their contract, Titania takes Blake, Korg, and Man-Thing out to a burger joint down the street.Weapon H #12. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Like all Kronans, Korg possesses a body made of a durable, silicon-based substance that grants him protection against nearly all forms of physical harm and gives him a rock- like appearance. In oxygen-rich atmospheres, Korg also possesses vast super strength almost comparable to Thing. His mineral state also grants him an extremely prolonged lifespan. When fighting as a gladiator, he mostly relied on his physical power and extremely durable form, rather than actual fighting skills. He is, however, an experienced military strategist and consummate pragmatist, constantly assessing his environment so he can tell what actions are necessary for his continued survival. Other versions =Marvel Zombies Return= * In Marvel Zombies Return, Hulk, along with the Warbound, reach the moon in hopes to start World War Hulk but instead meet Zombiefied versions of Giant Man and the Immortals. At the start of the battle, Korg is blown to pieces and killed. =What if= * In What if: Planet Hulk, Korg is shown devastated that Miek was killed in the destruction of Sakaar not knowing he was the one responsible.

He was born to a family who descended from Svantepolk of Skarsholm and his wife Benedikta Sunadotter. Svantepolk had been the younger son of Canute, Duke of Reval, Laland and Belinge (possibly also Halland), a bastard of Valdemar II of Denmark with Helena Guttormsdatter, daughter of a Swedish earl. Benedikta was the sister- in-law of King Eric XI and daughter of earl Sune Folkason, justiciar of V√§sterg√∂tland, with his wife Helena Sverkersdotter, herself the daughter of Sverker II of Sweden and his first wife Benedikte Ebbesdotter of the Galen. This made Benedict as one of the noblest blood of Sweden of his time. The rumors of improper relations between king Magnus IV of Sweden and Queen Blanche originate from the pamphlet Libellus Magno Erici, but have most likely no factual basis. His coat of arms was a standing lion; thus, the family has in some later reconstructions been called Lejon. This may also mean they were kin with the Folkunge, his line's ancestress belonging to those siblings of Boberg family who were nephews and nieces of Birger jarl. His paternal great- grandfather was Bengt Magnusson, justice of √ñsterg√∂tland. His kinship with the royal family (he was at least a distant cousin of Magnus, fourth cousin counted from Danish kings) and with other noble families of the country is presumed as the reason for the young man's exceptionally rapid rise. From 1352 he is known to have had a seat in the kingdom's Privy Council. Duke Benedict was married to Ingeborg Ulvsdotter of Tofta, a member of the Sparre family. She was much older than he, possibly already a widow. Ingeborg was the daughter of Ulf Abj√∂rnsson, justiciar of Tioh√§rad, the younger half-sister of Lord Karl of Tofta, maternal niece of Erengisle, Earl of Orkney, and the aunt of the future Margaret Sparre of Tofta, mother of Charles VIII of Sweden and ancestress of Gustav Vasa. In about 1353, the king created Benedict Duke of Finland and Halland. The title of Halland came from his descent from Duke Canute of Reval whose male line, which had held Halland as compensation for Reval and Laland, had gone extinct some fifty years earlier. Previous holders of the duchy of Halland had been the king's own father Duke Eric, his mother Duchess Ingeborg, and Ingeborg's second husband Knut Porse, as well as king's half-brothers. Benedict was also appointed Viceroy of Scania, the newly acquired group of mostly Danish provinces. Most probably, the chief reasons the king took these steps were to stop the spiritual and secular fr√§lse, to gain yet more power at royal expense, and Hanseatic power in Nordic commerce. (Their personal relationship was also rumored at the time to be the reason.) The Viceroy confiscated many of the properties of the Archdiocese of Lund upon the death of Archbishop Peder Jensen in 1355. Hanseatic privileges were also curbed in Skanish ports. However, Benedict repudiated his wife sometime in 1356, one of the reasons his noble relatives did not protect him. His wife's relatives became his enemies, and the duke was driven into exile. A civil war started at about the same time: leaders of Swedish nobility used the king's eldest son Eric as claimant and cited the favorite's exceptional privileges as an insult to the younger king. In 1356 a revolt started, nominally against Duke Benedict, but actually to weaken the king and his centralizing grip. In 1357, Benedict was exiled and Scania as well as several other Swedish and Finnish provinces were given to the young king Eric. Duke Benedict's elder brother Lord Knut was exiled to Norway with his wife M√§rta Ulvsdotter, a daughter of St Bridget of Sweden. Benedict probably lived in Denmark. In c 1360, Benedict returned to Sweden, but according to tradition was besieged in R√∂nneholm castle in Scania and eventually killed by his brother-in-law Lord Karl Ulvsson and Magnus Nilsson R√∂de. 1330 births 1360 deaths Swedish nobility People of medieval Finland 14th-century Swedish people Dukes of Halland ","title":"Benedict, Duke of Halland"},{"id":"5734544","text":"Clowance Estate Crowan ()Place-names in the Standard Written Form (SWF) : List of place-names agreed by the MAGA Signage Panel .

The present church is of the 15th century but was substantially restored in 1872. In some 18th-century documents there is evidence that the parish was called Uni-Crowan and this may be connected to the fact that the parish was in two parts, one in Penwith and one in Kerrier hundred.

Germoe village, the parish's main settlement and church town, is about five miles (8 km) west of Helston and seven miles (11.3 km) east of Penzance. The A394 Penzance to Helston road runs along the southern border of the parish.Ordnance Survey: Landranger map sheet 203 Land's End Other settlements in the parish include Balwest, Boscreege and Tresowes Green. The parish is named after Saint Germocus, one of the companions of Saint Breage. According to legend Germoc was a king in Ireland whose feast day is 6 May. Historically, the largest landowners in the parish were the Godolphin family (the Dukes of Leeds). GENUKI website: Germoe.

Retrieved May 2010 The population was 508 in the 2001 census. This had increased to 549 at the 2011 Census. The parish is now rural in character but was once associated with mining; to the north it borders the geological formation known as the Tregonning-Godolphin Granite (one of five granite batholiths in Cornwall) and the area was formerly an important source of tin and copper ore (see Geology of Cornwall). Tregonning Hill is the site of the Germoe war memorial. Churches The parish church in Germoe is mostly of the 14th century and is built on the site of an earlier Norman church. The church has a chancel, nave, north aisle, south transept, and a three-stage battlemented tower of granite ashlar. There are three long tailed monkeys carved on the porch which are said to ward off evil. There is a Godolphin family pew in the north aisle. A small medieval building in the churchyard wall is known as St Germoe's Chair. The Anglican ecclesiastical parish of Germoe is now grouped with Breage. A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was built at Balwest in 1829 for miners in the north of the parish.

They are usually found in gravel and rocky-bottomed slow-flowing waters with high dissolved oxygen content. A typical adult barbel will range from 25 to 100 cm in length and weigh anywhere between 200 g and 10 kg, although weights of 200 g are more common. Babies weigh 100‚Äì150 g. Barbel roe is poisonous and causes vomiting and diarrhea in some people. However, the fish itself can be eaten and recipes are available in The Illustrated London Cookery Book by Frederick Bishop. The name barbel derived from the Latin barba, meaning beard, a reference to the two pairs of barbels‚Äîa longer pair pointing forwards and slightly down positioned‚Äîon the side of the mouth. Fish described as barbels by English-speaking people may not be known as barbels in their native country, although the root of the word may be similar. For instance, the Mediterranean barbel (Barbus meridionalis) is known as barbeau m√©ridional or barbeau truit√© in France, but also as drogan, durgan, tourgan, turquan and truitat. Europe Barbus barbus, the barbel native to Great Britain, is known simply as the barbel and is a popular sport fish. Subspecies of B. barbus are recognised; namely B. barbus bocagei, B. barbus sclateri, B. barbus thessalus and B. barbus plebejus. The Mediterranean barbel (Barbus meridionalis) is found in Spain, France, Poland, Romania, and Ukraine. It is a much smaller fish than B. barbus. Other barbel in Europe include Barbus sclateri ‚Äì sometimes known as the European barbel; the Italian barbel (Barbus tyberinus); the Albanian barbel (Barbus albanicus); and the Iberian barbel, which is found in Spain and Portugal and is eaten by many European duck species. Asia The Crimean barbel (Barbus tauricus) is found in the Salgir River in the Crimean peninsula. A sub-species, the Kuban barbel (Barbus tauricus kubanicus) is found in the upper and middle Kuban River in Russia. The Aral barbel (Barbus brachycephalus) is found in Central Asia, and the sub- species B. brachycephalus caspius (the Caspian Barbel) is found in the Caspian Sea. The Bulatmai barbel (Barbus capito carpito, formerly Cyprinus capito) is found in the Kura river in Trans-caucasia. The Terek barbel (Barbus ciscaucasicus) is found in the Kuma River, Russia. The Turkestan barbel (Barbus conocephalus) is found in the Zeravshan river. The Gokcha barbel (Barbus goktschaicus) is found in the Lake Sevan in Armenia. The Kura barbel (Barbus lacerta formerly Mtkvari barbel) is found in Syria. The Himri barbel (Barbus luteus) is native to Mesopotamian rivers. The Amur barbel or Barbel steed (Hemibarbus labeo) is found in the Amur basin and elsewhere in east and south-east Asia, including south-east Siberia. Africa Barbus callensis is found in Tunisia. The Ripon barbel (Barbus altianalis) is found in the African Great Lakes. Labeobarbus bynni bynni is found in the Nile and lakes that have been connected to that river. The sub-species Barbus bynni occidentalis is known as the Niger barb. Other Occasionally non-cyprinid fish are called barbels such as Austroglanis gilli, or Schilbe mystus, both are catfish. Some species of the genus Sinocyclocheilus a cave dwelling fish found in China have made use of the term barbel in their English common name. Literary references The barbel is mentioned in Nostradamus Les Proph√©ties, century VII, 24 : Fishing for barbel Barbel, although often found in still waters, are predominantly a river-dwelling fish and are very sought after by many anglers. They may not be the most elusive fish in the river; in fact, in the right conditions they are fairly easy to catch. They are, however, very hardy fish who will fight right until you slip your landing net under them. Despite this hardy nature in the water they do not cope well out of the water and must be returned safely and quickly. It is good custom to support the fish in the water until it is fully recovered and swims away of its own accord. Some of the best barbel fishing venues are along the Loddon near Reading. The Severn at Bewdley is a particular hotspot where there are different day ticket and club stretches on both sides of the bank. The current record on the river Severn is 16 lb 11 oz, taken by Kevin Gittins, in November 2014. Nottinghamshire's River Trent is now being recognised as one of the best venues in the UK since Craig Lander landed an 18 lb 14 oz giant Trent barbel.

This Asian arowana has large, protruding barbels In fish anatomy and turtle anatomy, a barbel is a slender, whiskerlike sensory organ near the mouth. Fish that have barbels include the catfish, the carp, the goatfish, the hagfish, the sturgeon, the zebrafish, the black dragonfish and some species of shark such as the sawshark. Barbels house the taste buds of such fish and are used to search for food in murky water. The word \\"barbel\\" comes from the Middle Latin barbula, for \\"little beard.\\" Barbels are sometimes erroneously referred to as barbs, which are found in bird feathers for flight. Barbels may be located in a variety of locations on the head of a fish. \\"Maxillary barbels\\" refers to barbels on either side of the mouth. Barbels may also be nasal, extending from the nostrils. Also, barbels are often mandibular or mental, being located on the chin.  Fish  The armored searobin displays a more extensive set of barbels = Morphology = In fish, barbels can take the form of small, fleshy protrusions or long, cylindrical shaped extensions of the head of a fish. The cylindrical barbel shapes are built on an internal support system that can be made from ossified tissue or from cartilaginous connective tissue that provides a base for blood vessels and myelinated nerves to wrap around, held together in the dermis. Muscle tissue in the central region of the barbel allows the structure limited movement that aids in prey manipulation. On the epidermis, taste buds are situated on dermal papillae, small ridges of folded skin that increase the surface area of the skin and the total number of taste buds that can be concentrated on the barbel. Concentrations of taste buds vary from species to species, with bullhead catfish having 25 buds in a square milometer of barbel skin. Barbels begin to develop during the embryonic, larval, or juvenile life stages of most of the species in which they are present. Development regulation of barbels has been linked to the C-C motif ligand 33 of the chemokine family of genes, due to its presence in barbeled catfish and zebrafish and absence or difference in expression in barbel-less members of the same families. This class of genes are signalling genes that provide migrating cells directional information during morphogenesis. = Function = In most fish species, barbels are used to aid in the acquisition of food in bodies of water that have low visibility due to low light conditions or murky waters. The taste receptors are able to detect enzymes in the water and help the fish identify if it is from a possible food source or possible sources of danger. The abyssal zone scavengers Coryphaenoides armatus possess one small mandible barbel that they use to search the seafloor for carrion to eat. Freckled Goatfish, Upeneus tragula, develop barbels as a response to food availability. When starved of food for two days under laboratory conditions, U. tragula develop large barbels compared to those developed by those who were fed consistently. The large barbels help the organism capture prey and compete against other individuals. However, individuals that developed large barbels also experienced a decreased growth rate. In the species Triportheus signatus, individuals have been found to develop barbels late in life as a response to low dissolved oxygen in pools left after flood waters recede following the rainy season. These structures are more vascularized than barbels of other fish species to help gas exchange in low oxygen conditions and direct more water flow over the gills.

Miek appears in Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Endgame as a larva-like creature instead of a humanoid roach. Publication history Miek was first seen in The Incredible Hulk vol. 2 #92 during the \\"Planet Hulk\\" storyline and was created by Greg Pak and Carlo Pagulayan. Fictional character biography Miek was a member of planet Sakaar's native race of insectoids. When he was young, his father and most of his hive were attacked and killed by local Imperials, forcing Miek to flee underground. He was accidentally rescued, as an outcast slave, during Hulk's battle with the Red King. Soon after, the Warbound escaped with Miek secretly leading them to the place where his father was killed. The Warbound then aided him in securing his revenge. Miek and Brood, who have formed a connection due to their insect nature, freed Miek's brothers and added the Warbound to their Hive. Within a short time he underwent a metamorphosis and evolved into a giant heavily armoured \\"King\\" version of his race. Miek located one of the last Queens of his race, at an egg farm at which the Warbound were hiding. Unfortunately for Miek, and his species, the Queen was consumed by a Spike infection and had to be killed. Miek led the Warbound in Hulk's place while Hulk, Hiroim, and Caiera attempted to obtain the allegiance of Caiera and Hiroim's people. Following the death of Caiera Oldstrong, Miek and the rest of the Warbound accompanied the Hulk back to Earth, where he pledged to aid him in a quest of vengeance against those responsible for the Hulk's forced exile.Avengers: The Initiative #4 (2007) On Earth, Miek was one of the most vocal in encouraging the destruction of the planet in revenge for what was done. By the end, it was revealed that Miek knew all along that the Illuminati were not responsible. Red King loyalists had planted a damaged warp core on the Hulk's ship hoping it would kill the Hulk. Miek did not tell the Hulk hoping it would encourage the Hulk to keep destroying. Enraged, the Hulk and No-Name nearly killed Miek.World War Hulk #5 (2007) After the Hulk's defeat Miek was captured by S.H.I.E.L.D. in Wonderland and relayed information about the Warbound to help recapture them.World War Hulk Aftersmash: Warbound #1 (2008) Following the Secret Invasion storyline, Miek was presumably still imprisoned in the Negative Zone supervised by Wonderland's freed inmates. =Chaos War= Miek made a full recovery as he remained locked away in Prison 42 and stayed there until Amatsu-Mikaboshi became the Chaos King and attacked all of reality. As order gave way to chaos, Miek found his freedom along with many other prisoners. He pledged his service to the Chaos King, who sought to destroy everything much like Miek wished Hulk would. Miek, with an army of other former prisoners, attacked Amadeus Cho and Galactus as they attempted to complete a gateway to a pocket universe to save creation. Cho recognized him from the attack on New York but could not reason with him. Miek was unwilling to trust anything Cho said and tried to stop Cho from completing the gateway. Despite Miek initially had the upper hand and nearly killed Cho, an earthquake caused by the fight between Chaos King and Hercules caused him to lose his prey. Amadeus quickly knocked him with the Golden Mace, causing Miek to fly away.Chaos War #5 =Planet Savage= Miek found that as a result of his exposure to the Chaos King's energies, he had become biologically female. This allowed her to lay clutches of eggs, but the hatchlings could not survive long after birthing. Miek found her way to the Savage Land, and in the process of asserting herself there, slaughtered forty-three Sakaarian refugees residing there. She had also grown considerably larger and more powerful through this time. Ka-Zar contacted Hulk regarding the deaths of the Sakaarians, and Hulk assembled his Warbound and headed there directly, despite the grievous injuries he'd sustained from his battle with Zeus. During the Warbound's first night there, the Sakaarian elder had drugged the group, allowing Miek and her insect horde to abduct the Hulk. The elder had made an agreement with Miek that his people would be spared if he helped Miek obtain the Hulk as a sacrifice.Incredible Hulk #622 Miek had attempted to supplant her hatchlings into the bodies of Sakaarians, to keep them fed and safe, but that had not worked. When attempting it with the Hulk's unconscious body, the hatchlings thrived. Using exceedingly strong insect chemicals, Miek kept the Hulk drugged and under mind control while her hatchlings gestated in Hulk's chest, even sending the mind-controlled Hulk against his own Warbound in an attempt to stop them from rescuing his captive. When the Hulk's rage burned off the mind control, Miek tried to convince the Warbound to help them keep her hatchlings alive.Incredible Hulk #623 Hulk then tore the infants from her chest and attempted to stomp them, before he set about killing Miek. Skaar then tackled Hulk, smashing his head into the ground, and calling him a \\"stupid monster\\". Skaar promised the infant insects that no one would hurt them and that he'd care for them, as he could sympathize with their plight. Miek attempted to drug Skaar, to make him kill his father, only to have another of her arms chopped off by Hulk, who then punched Miek through a volcano and across the Savage Land into a mountain of ice. Hulk chased after and tried to save Miek, but Miek would not let him, and fell presumably to her death.Incredible Hulk #625 Powers and abilities As a Sakaaran Native, Miek hatched from an egg in a grub-like larval stage and eventually entered a cocoon-like pupae stage after several months. Six months later, he emerged from his cocoon as an adult Native, with fully formed antennae, six limbs, and postpharyngeal glands used to communicate with other members of their familial hive. Later in life, Miek entered into a second pupae stage and emerged as a Native king, with an armor- like chitinous carapace, longer mandibles, clawed phalanges, and overall greater body mass. As a gladiator on Sakaar, he developed six-limbed fighting skills, often wielding four weapons at a time to keep his opponents off- balance. Other versions =Marvel Zombies Return= In the 4th issue of Marvel Zombies Return, when Hulk and the Warbound land on the moon they are met by zombiefied versions of Giant Man and the Immortals. There Miek along with No-Name are soon killed and eaten by Giant Man.Marvel Zombies Return #4 (2009) =What If?= * In the What If? issue revolving around Planet Hulk called What if Caiera the Oldstrong had survived the destruction of Sakaar instead of the Hulk?, Miek is also killed in the destruction of Sakaar when they run into a volcanic crack formed as Sakaar breaks apart, believing that the Hulk is coming towards them, and is burned to death. His death prevents anyone from discovering the truth of Sakaar's destruction and leads to Caiera's conquest of Earth. * Miek was also featured in a What If? issue revolving around \\"World War Hulk\\". In the first story, he is killed alongside the Warbound and the heroes that are present when Iron Man does not hesitate to use the laser on Hulk. In the second story, Miek's treachery is known after Thor had successfully reasoned with Hulk. In other media =Television= * Miek appeared in The Super Hero Squad Show episode \\"Planet Hulk\\", voiced by Dave Wittenberg. * Miek appears in the Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. episode \\"Planet Leader\\", voiced by Benjamin Diskin. He is among the Sakaar inhabitants that are controlled by Leader where they are among the slaves in the Sakaar mines. Miek was the one who told A-Bomb and Red Hulk about a revolution that will be starting soon. =Films= * Miek appears in the Planet Hulk film voiced by Sam Vincent. He is shown to be more cowardly yet good and friendly and looks up to the Hulk as a friend. While never betraying them, becoming evil, or meta-morphing into King Miek, he does get braver throughout the film, even single-handedly fighting and killing a traitor who was about to kill his friends under the orders of the Red King. His past and reason for exile though were never revealed. * Miek appears in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ** Miek appears in Thor: Ragnarok. This version of the character is a larva-like creature as opposed to a humanoid roach, and initially uses an exoskeleton equipped with blades in order to aid them in combat. Beside Korg, he is one of the gladiators who befriends Thor after he arrived in Sakaar. When Thor stages an escape, Valkyrie frees Miek, Korg, and the rest of the gladiators to start a rebellion. Miek helps evacuate the Asgardians during the final battle, but loses his suit in the process. After being accidentally stepped on by Korg, Miek is carried by him on board the ship out of guilt, believing he had killed his friend, and is overjoyed when he realizes Miek is still alive, and has laid eggs. ** Miek returns in Avengers: Endgame. It is revealed that, with Korg, he had survived Thanos' attack on the Asgardian lifeboat and are living on Earth in the New Asgard settlement in Norway. Five years after Thanos snapped half of the universe out of existence with the Infinity Gauntlet, Miek and Korg are living as Thor's roommates in his hut when the Hulk and Rocket come to recruit Thor in retrieving the Infinity Stones. The two later appear at the battle at the former Avengers compound against Thanos and his army. ** In October 2017, producer Kevin Feige stated that both Miek and Korg will appear in future Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, specifically Thor: Love and Thunder. =Video games= * Miek appears in Marvel: Contest of Champions as a companion of Korg.

Located at the intersection of Marcy Avenue and Broadway in Brooklyn, it is served by the J train at all times, the M train at all times except late nights, and the Z train during rush hours in the peak direction.  History  Remains of the Broadway Ferry spur behind the billboard. Marcy Avenue opened on June 25, 1888 as a part of the Broadway Elevated, one of the first elevated lines in New York City. Trains traveled westbound to the Broadway Ferry terminal on the East River in Brooklyn and eastbound services ran to Canarsie (this routing is no longer used due to the later building of the Canarsie Line) and a connection over the Williamsburg Bridge to Delancey Street/Essex Street in Manhattan opened in 1908.1912 BMT system map NYCSubway Retrieved August 10, 2009 In 1913, trains were extended farther down the newly opened Nassau Street Line to Chambers Street. A year later, a connection was built to allow Myrtle Avenue trains to run on the Broadway Elevated. The Dual Contracts expansion projects radically changed operations at Marcy Avenue. A third track was added, allowing trains to run express, although the track remains as a stub-end at Marcy Avenue for storage and turn-arounds. The Contracts also provided for the merger of the Jamaica Line from Broadway Junction to 168th Street with the Broadway Elevated, in turn making the Broadway Elevated part of the Jamaica Line and giving trains three eastern terminals. On April 13, 1954, the enlarged station platform at Marcy Avenue was opened, as well as the expanded stairway facilities. As part of the 2015‚Äì2019 Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Capital Program, station capacity enhancements will be made at the station. The project will assess the feasibility of widening and reconstructing the stairs at Havemeyer Street, widening the westerly outbound platform, and widening the platform level fare control areas to fit in an additional low-level turnstile. Design work started in April 2017 and will be finished in December 2017, with construction set to begin in April 2018.  Station layout  View from the eastbound platform, looking west This station has two side platforms and three tracks and is the westernmost station on the Jamaica Line. The center track dead ends at the west end at a bumper block and is unusable for service. Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames that run along the entire length except for a section at the southeast (railroad south), where they have waist-high black steel fences. During the 1999 reconstruction of the Williamsburg Bridge, a temporary platform was erected over the center track for the station's use as a terminal station. The 2005 artwork here is called A Space Odyssey by Ellsworth Ausby. It consists of stained glass windows depicting space travel on the platform windscreens. Just west of this station, there is a short section of trackway continuing straight which once led to the Broadway Ferry Spur. As now configured, westbound trains run over the Williamsburg Bridge, connecting to the BMT Nassau Street Line in Manhattan. To the east, there are switches that are used to access the center express track, which is used by the J and Z trains in the peak direction weekday midday and rush hours. =Exits= All four fare control areas of the station are on platform level. As a result, there is no free transfer between directions. The primary ones, are elevated station houses adjacent to the platforms. Each station house has doors leading to the stairs and platform, turnstile bank, token booth, and two stairs and one ADA-accessible elevator to the street. The stairs from the Manhattan-bound station house go down to either northern corner of Marcy Avenue and Broadway while the stair from the Queens-bound station house go down to either southern corners. The elevators go down to either western corner of Marcy Avenue and Broadway, with the Queens-bound elevator on the southwest corner and the Manhattan-bound elevator on the northwest corner. Both platforms have a HEET turnstile entrance/exit at their extreme west end that was added during a 1990s renovation. Each leads to a canopied staircase that goes down to either side of Broadway near Havemeyer Street.  In popular culture  SW Corner entrance The home of the character Dave Stutler in the 2010 film The Sorcerer's Apprentice is located near this station. Stutler is also attacked by a wolf in this station. The fictional neighborhood of \\"Little Wadiya\\", from the 2012 film The Dictator, is located near to this station. The choice may be related to the presence of the Hasidic Jewish Community in Williamsburg. Flight of the Conchords are seen emerging from Marcy Avenue station singing the song Inner City Pressure during season 1, episode 2 of their eponymous TV show.

They are now considered obsolete. Ethernet networking of this period (mid 1980s to mid 1990s) used \\"thin coax\\" or 10BASE2. All devices on a network segment connected to the same electrical section of RG-58 coaxial cable. Intermediate devices were connected via a T piece. The two ends of the segment were terminated with a resistive network terminator. Although these networks were reliable when connected, they were prone to accidental misconnection by non-technical office staff. This was particularly an issue when devices, such as desktop computers, were being added or removed from the network. Although a rare need at this time, the situation was even worse for portable laptops. To avoid some of the drawbacks with 10BASE2 over BNC connectors, the EAD socket was one of several alternatives developed to give an \\"office friendly\\" network connector that could easily be connected and disconnected, and avoided the risk of making misconnections. With the obsolescence of 10BASE2 networks, from the mid 1990s, in favour of Ethernet over twisted pair, EAD sockets became obsolete. EAD is an abbreviation for German Ethernet-Anschlussdose, and were developed from TAE connectors for telephony applications but were intended for connecting coaxial network cables like 10BASE2. A different mechanical encoding (Type E) prevented mix-up with phone plugs. EAD cables were duplex connections replacing two thin-wire cables, with the T-connector integrated into the BNC end. The contacts of an EAD outlet are closed if no connector is plugged in. When a cable is plugged in, the normally-closed contacts in the socket are opened so that signals pass through the loop cable. Worn out connectors or outlets can cause the same problems that haunted the simpler connectors but user errors are largely reduced.

The village had a railway station which led to the change of name from Skateraw to Newtonhill but it was closed in 1956; the signal box was still in use until May 2019 and remnants of a platform can still be seen. A feasibility study received funding in May 2018 to study the possible reopening of the station. Transport links Newtonhill today is accessed by the A92 road and functions primarily as a commuter town to Aberdeen and other business hubs in the area. The village is also well served by buses run by Stagecoach Group providing regular services to Aberdeen, Stonehaven and Montrose. Community groups and activities Newtonhill has a successful Boys' Brigade chess team which has won the Scottish tournament many times and have won the British grand finals the most out of all British teams. There is an active community spirit in Newtonhill and many events are organised through the Newtonhill and District Village Association, with wider planning issues being discussed by the Community Council. Natural features The Bay at Newtonhill, which features several caves The Burn of Elsick, which drains agricultural lands from the west, flows into the North Sea at Newtonhill. The White Wife is a rock formation which allows sea angling. Newtonhill also has a great scenic views of the cliffs looking on to the pebble shore, where fishing still a custom to many. History Newtonhill is in Kincardineshire, though local government re-organisation means that the local authority is Aberdeenshire Council. Newtonhill is situated about half a mile east of the ancient Causey Mounth road, which was built on high ground to make passable this only available medieval route from coastal points north to Aberdeen. This ancient passage specifically connected the Bridge of Dee via Portlethen Moss, Muchalls Castle and Stonehaven to the south.C.Michael Hogan, Causey Mounth, Megalithic Portal, ed. by Andy Burnham, 2007 The route was that taken by William Keith, 7th Earl Marischal and the Duke of Montrose when they led a Covenanter army of 9000 men in the first battle of the First Bishop's War in 1639.Archibald Watt, Highways and Byways around Kincardineshire, Stonehaven Heritage Society (1985)  Geography  Newtonhill is located on the North-East coast of Scotland, approximately 9 miles south of Aberdeen and 6 miles north of Stonehaven.

It originated from WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York from its launch on Saturday October 31, 1993 until July 2012. It shifted to local competitor WBBZ-TV on August 4, 2012.Off Beat Cinema website Retrieved July 24, 2012. Off Beat Cinema features a broad range of films described by the show's staff as \\"the Good, the Bad, the Foreign...\\" but mostly cult movies such as Night of the Living Dead, Santa Claus Conquers the Martians and even more art house fare such as The Third Man in a format not unlike the Creature Double Feature of the 1970s and 1980s. On occasion, a clip show will air featuring episodes of short features (the annual Christmas special follows this format, with another example being the ‚ÄúNight of Superheroes‚Äù that included Flash Gordon and Commando Cody serials and the Fleischer Studios Superman shorts). As with most hosted movie programs of its kind, a large portion of Off Beat Cinema's film catalog consists of films that lapsed into the public domain. History =Creation= Off Beat Cinema was created and is written by Paragon Advertising executive James Gillan. It originally started airing in 1993 in the Buffalo/Toronto area on WKBW-TV. On the show's official site, he states, \\"Off Beat Cinema was created to provide a forum for films that are not regularly shown on television ‚Äì and in many cases ‚Äì are not readily available, even on DVD. There is an enormous cache of films out there that an entire generation grew up watching that are otherwise unavailable. We wanted to create a program reminiscent of the hosted late night film shows of the 1960s and 1970s ‚Äì the kind of show that made you beg your parents to let you stay up late to watch. Where else can you watch Teenagers from Outer Space and a week later watch Bergman‚Äôs The Seventh Seal in its original language version?\\" The show's producer John Di Sciullo says on the official site that \\"Off Beat Cinema was originally a reaction to the insidious spread of infomercials and the void of late night television. The program really struck a chord with viewers.\\" Off Beat Cinema has its own slate of advertisers, usually targeting alternative crowds. Poster Art, Terrapin Station (a Grateful Dead inspired head shop in Buffalo, named after the album of the same name), and Mighty Taco, among many other area restaurants, are among the show's numerous sponsors. The series began originating on WBBZ-TV starting August 4, 2012, where it follows Svengoolie, a similar program from Me-TV, with which WBBZ is affiliated.

The series also began adding more well-received \\"classic\\" films into its rotation after the move to WBBZ, a move that helps contrast the series from the strictly B-movie and Z-movie films that Svengoolie and other midnight-movie series regularly feature. On January 26, 2013, the show transitioned to high-definition television. The first film to be featured in HD was Hangar 18.

The show's original trio of hosts were led by the witty and irreverent \\"Maxwell Truth\\" (\\"Airborne\\" Eddy Dobosiewicz), high-energy bearded \\"Oscar Wild\\" (Matthew Bauer), and spacey-but-friendly chick \\"Luna\\" (Liz Honig). Others were also seen in the coffeehouse, usually as extras. Occasionally, an odd aspiring poet named \\"Bird\\" was featured as a recurring player, Luna was seen less frequently after the first year or so, often being replaced by a few rotating female characters, most frequently Loraine O'Donnell as \\"Zena\\". Bauer left the show in 1995, and the character of Oscar was replaced by the pseudo-profound beatnik artist and would-be philosopher \\"Bird\\" (Anthony Billoni, who by day serves as an anti-tobacco lobbyisthttp://buffalonews.com/2016/03/04/poloncarz-wants-pharmacy-retailers- banned-from-selling-tobacco-products/). Shortly thereafter, the third host slot was permanently filled by \\"Zelda\\" (Stage and Film Actress Constance McEwen Caldwell), who was quite friendly with the boys, but also enjoyed deflating their pretensions with a well-timed barb. The trio of Maxwell, Zelda and Bird remained as hosts for the next 20 years. Each week they were often joined by guest stars like Emo Philips, Lauren Bacall and Keanu Reeves, and music acts like the Barenaked Ladies, and the Tragically Hip. Dobosiewicz was fired from the show in April 2015 after comparing the behavior of rioters in Baltimore to animals in a tweet, that included a picture of baboons. Dobosiewicz issued a statement defending his actions from accusations that his comments were racist and was blacklisted from local television for a year. From then until June 2016, Bird and Zelda hosted the program as a duo. In July 2016, the third host position was filled by \\"Theodore,\\" played by Jeffrey Roberts and described as a \\"cinematic theologian.\\" Interstitial segments are shot in black and white. Interstitial music on Off Beat Cinema is provided by David Kane's Them Jazzbeards and is typically fusion in style. =Syndication= Off Beat Cinema can also be seen nationwide on many Retro TV affiliates, as well as on Tampa, Florida's WTSP, the Vision Communications stations (WYDC Corning and WBGT-CD Rochester) and many other stations.Click on Off-Beat-Cinema-Network movie schedules Off Beat Cinema website.

The film stars Othon Bastos, Maur√≠cio do Valle, Yon√° Magalh√£es, and Geraldo Del Rey. It belongs to the Cinema Novo movement, addressing the socio-political problems of 1960s Brazil. The film was released on DVD in North America for the first time by Koch-Lorber Films. Plot The film starts in the 1940s, during another drought in the sert√£o, when ranch hand Manuel (Geraldo Del Rey) is fed up with his situation. His boss tries to cheat him of his earnings and Manuel kills him, fleeing with his wife, Rosa (Yon√° Magalh√£es). Now an outlaw, Manuel joins up with a self-proclaimed saint who condones violence (at one point slaughtering a baby) and preaches disturbing doctrines. It is now Rosa who turns to killing and the two are on the move once again. And so it goes, the two running from one allegiance to another, following the words of others as they attempt to find a place in their ruthless land. Blending mysticism, religion, and popular culture in this symbolic and realistic drama, Rocha insists that rather than follow the external and obscure dogmas of culture and religion, man must determine his path by his own voice.

Its filming took place on Monte Santo and Canudos, Bahia lasting from June 18, 1963 to September 2, 1963. In the scene where we see Manuel (Geraldo Del Rey) carrying a huge stone over his head while climbing Monte Santo on his knees, Del Rey insisted on carrying a real stone that weighted over 20 kilos - something that worried Rocha. After the shooting, Del Rey had to take 2 days off, due to fatigue. During the dubbing of the sound, Othon Bastos performed three voices. Besides dubbing himself as Corisco, he performed the voice for Lampi√£o (whom Corisco had \\"incorporated\\") and also dubbed Sebasti√£o, the black God, even though L√≠dio Silva played the character on screen. Reception =Critical reception= Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 100%, based on , with a rating average of 8.5/10. A. H. Weiler from The New York Times praised the film, calling it \\"Simple, black-and-white, more arresting as a shocking polemic than as memorable drama.\\" Ted Shen from The Chicago Reader wrote, \\"The fusion of European and Afro-Brazilian elements-- dialogue, exquisite black-and-white images, and music by Villa-Lobos--is startlingly original and poetical in conveying the hope and despair of the oppressed.\\" Time Out Magazine praised the film's style as being \\"somewhere between folk ballad and contemporary myth, since the references to Brazilian history and culture are pervasive and fairly opaque to the uninitiated\\". =Awards= The film was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the 1964 Cannes Film Festival, but failed to win.

Early life and education Fisher was born during October 1853 in Collin County, north of Dallas, Texas, to Jobe Fisher and the former Lucinda Warren. His brothers were Jasper and James Fisher. Fisher's mother died when he was two years old, and his father married a woman named Minerva. After the Civil War ended, the family moved to Williamson County, near Austin, where his brother James was then residing. Jobe Fisher was a cattleman who owned and operated two freight wagons. After the death of his stepmother Minerva, the Fishers moved to Goliad, west of Victoria, Texas, where they were joined by his paternal grandmother, who helped her son raise his children. King Fisher was restless, handsome, popular with the girls, and prone to running with a tough crowd. His father sent him to live with his brother James circa 1869. Some two years later, Fisher was arrested for horse theft and sentenced to two years in prison. However, because of his youth, he was released after only a short time that same year.Texas Gunslinger, Outlaw and Lawman. =Cowboy and outlaw= After his release from prison, Fisher began working as a cowboy, breaking horses. Because of the incessant raids, lootings, and rapes of Texas ranch and farm families by bandits, he soon found himself taking part in posse activities. As a result of his successes in this arena, he fancied himself as a gunman. Fisher began to dress rather flamboyantly and carried ivory handled pistols. He became quite proficient with a gun and began running with a band of outlaws which carried out frequent raids into Mexico. However, after only a short time, a dispute arose over how the spoils of their loot would be divided. One of the men drew his pistol, and Fisher immediately pulled his guns and managed to kill three of the bandits in the ensuing shootout. He then took over as leader of the gang, and over the course of the next several months killed seven more Mexican bandits. In 1872, he bought a ranch on the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass, in Maverick County on the Mexican border. He used this ranch as his gang's base of operations and even was so brazen as to place a sign that read \\"This is King Fisher's road. Take the other one.\\" During this time, King Fisher rarely committed acts of violence or theft against other Texas settlers, instead opting to raid and rustle cattle across the Mexican border. This was a time of massive raids, pillaging, looting, raping, and murder by United States and Mexican bandits. In response to feelings of alleged lack of reprisal or defense by authorities, the Texans formed more groups of bandits. This activity only fueled disputes and ill will from the Mexican side and generated substantial problems for Texas Ranger battalions, who were trying to quell Mexican bandit raids into Texas. The Texas Rangers, under Leander H. McNelly, opposed the Mexican rebel leader Juan Cortina. The Rangers also raided the Fisher Ranch and arrested Fisher. However, he was released after a \\"gentleman's agreement\\"' was reached that his cattle rustling into Mexico would end. Pressure from the Texas Rangers caused Fisher to retire from this trade, and he began legitimate ranching.Leander McNelly =Gunfighter= By the late 1870s, Fisher had a reputation as being fast with a gun. In 1878, an argument between Fisher and four Mexican vaqueros erupted. Fisher is alleged to have clubbed the nearest one to him with a branding iron, then as a second drew a pistol Fisher drew his own pistol and shot and killed the man. He then spun around and shot the other two, who evidently had not produced weapons and merely sat on the fence during the altercation. Fisher was arrested several times for altercations in public by local lawmen and had been charged at least once with \\"intent to kill\\". The charges were dropped after no witnesses came forward. Although well known as a trouble maker, Fisher was well liked in south Texas. He married the former Sarah Vivian on April 6, 1876, and the couple had four daughters.King Fisher's four daughters were: Florence (1877-1952), Eugenia \\"Ninnie\\" (1879-1915), P.L. (1882-1883) and Mittie Marguerite (1883-1958). With his new family, he began a more settled life by working in the cattle business. He served briefly in 1883 as acting sheriff of Uvalde County, Texas. During this service he trailed two stagecoach robbery suspects, the brothers Tom and Jim Hannehan, to their ranch near Leakey in Real County, Texas. The Hannehans resisted, and Fisher shot and killed Tom. Jim then surrendered and was taken into custody along with the stolen loot from the robbery. For years after Fisher's death, Tom Hannehan's mother would travel to Fisher's grave on the anniversary of Tom Hannehan's death. She would build a fire on top of the grave and then dance around it. According to reporter Carey McWilliams, when asked about how many notches he had on his gun (how many people he had killed), he replied, \\"thirty-seven, not counting Mexicans.\\"  Ambush and murder  In 1884, while in San Antonio, Texas, on business, Fisher came into contact with his old friend, gunfighter and gambler Ben Thompson. Thompson was unpopular in San Antonio, since he had earlier killed a popular theater owner there named Jack Harris. A feud over that killing had been brewing since between Thompson and friends of Harris. Fisher and Thompson attended a play on March 11 at the Turner Hall Opera House, and later, about 10:30 p.m., they went to the Vaudeville Variety Theater. A local lawman named Jacob Coy sat with them. Thompson wanted to see Joe Foster, a theater owner and friend of Harris's, and one of those fueling the ongoing feud. Thompson had already spoken to Billy Simms, another theater owner, and Foster's new partner. Fisher and Thompson were directed upstairs to meet with Foster. Coy and Simms soon joined them in the theater box. Foster refused to speak to Thompson. Fisher allegedly noticed that something was not right. Simms and Coy stepped aside, and as they did Fisher and Thompson leapt to their feet just as a volley of gunfire erupted from another theater box, a hail of bullets hitting both Thompson and Fisher. Thompson fell onto his side, and either Coy or Foster ran up to him and shot him in the head with a pistol. Thompson was unable to return fire and died almost immediately. Fisher was shot thirteen times, and did fire one round in retaliation, possibly wounding Coy, but that is not confirmed. Coy may have been shot by one of the attackers and was left crippled for life. Foster, in attempting to draw his pistol at the first of the fight, shot himself in the leg, which was later amputated. He died shortly thereafter. The description of the events of that night are contradictory. There was a public outcry for a grand jury indictment of those involved. However, no action was ever taken. The San Antonio police and the prosecutor showed little interest in the case. Fisher was buried on his ranch. His body was later moved to the Pioneer Cemetery in Uvalde, Texas. In popular culture *Fisher is portrayed by Jack Lambert (American actor) in the 1959 episode \\"Incident in Leadville\\" of the television series Bat Masterson starring Gene Barry. * Fisher is portrayed by Robert Yuro in \\"King of the Uvalde Road,\\" a 1970 episode of the syndicated television series Death Valley Days, with Dale Robertson as host and co-star.

Fisher knows that if the mail comes through, his power will be jeopardized. *Alfred Molina plays Fisher in the 2001 film Texas Rangers. *In William W.

OMA DM is designed to support and utilize any number of data transports such as: * physically over both wireline (USB, RS-232) and wireless media (GSM, CDMA, IrDA, or Bluetooth) * transport layers implemented over any of WSP (WAP), HTTP, or OBEX or similar transports The communication protocol is a request-response protocol. Authentication and challenge of authentication are built-in to ensure the server and client are communicating only after proper validation. The server and client are both stateful, meaning a specific sequence of messages are to be exchanged only after authentication is completed to perform any task. The communication is initiated by the OMA DM server, asynchronously, using any of the methods available such as a WAP Push or SMS. The initial message from server to client is said to be in the form of a notification, or alert message. Once the communication is established between the server and client, a sequence of messages might be exchanged to complete a given device management task. OMA DM does provide for alerts, which are messages that can occur out of sequence, and can be initiated by either server or client. Such alerts are used to handle errors, abnormal terminations etc. Several parameters relating to the communication such as the maximum message size can be negotiated between the server and client during the initiation of a session. In order to transfer large objects, the protocol does allow for sending them in smaller chunks. Error recovery based on timeouts are not specified completely, hence, different implementations could possibly differ (protocol is not fully specified relating to these, and seem to leave them open intentionally). The protocol specifies exchange of Packages during a session, each package consisting of several messages, and each message in turn consisting of one or more commands. The server initiates the commands and the client is expected to execute the commands and return the result via a reply message.

One of the earlier Polish developed first-person shooters for Microsoft Windows, the game follows a son of a scientist transported back in time to World War II to avert the Axis victory and features levels set both in World War II and the future. The game received unfavorable reviews at its launch, with the game garnering some positive coverage from the Polish video game press and widely panned abroad. A sequel for the game, entitled Mortyr II, was released in 2004, five years after the original game. Plot Screenshot from Mortyr Screenshot from Mortyr In 1944, unexpectedly for the Allies, a German winter offensive results in over 80% of European territories falling to German control. No one really knows what Hitler and his generals did to bring forth this course of events, but the fall of London made it clear that the Allies had little chance of winning the war. Soon after, the destruction of Moscow and the taking of Washington D.C. ended the war. It was hard to believe that it was the German military technique or their leaders' tactical skills. People started to talk about final development of the Wunderwaffe, especially that not many managed to flee from the battlefields to tell what they have seen - their reports were unclear and not explaining anything. Nevertheless, the world was unable to stop the F√ºhrer and his Reich. In the year 2093, 148 years after the end of the war, the overwhelming Reich rules the Earth under totalitarianism, but Armageddon is nearing. The victory of German troops brought not only terror of Nazi dictatorship but also mysterious weather changes, which are seemingly leading the world towards destruction. General Jurgen Mortyr thinks that the Nazis are somehow responsible for the growing number of disasters and weather changes. The only way to prevent the destruction of mankind is to travel back in time to 1944. General Mortyr assigns his son, Sebastian, the mission to investigate and stop the events that could destroy the future of mankind. Development The game have gone through few conceptual changes before the setting for the time traveling World War II shooter was settled on. It initially started development as Netguard which was to be a science fiction detective story, and soon after it restarted development as a psychological horror game called Insanity before settling on a World War II game. The game was about to mostly have the World War II setting with the time travel elements being relegated to the epilogue but the developers ended up extending the concept for future- based levels for the second half of the game. Two separate studios based on two separate cities (Warsaw and Toru≈Ñ) were involved with developing the game. Interactive Magic picked up Mortyr in December 1998. The publisher reportedly invested heavily in the launch of Mortyr. According to IGN, it was planned as the company's \\"largest retail launch since Apache\\". In April 1999, Interactive Magic announced that its release would be supported by a global shipment of 100,000 copies to stores. GameSpot's Alan Dunkin likewise reported that the publisher was \\"betting a lot\\" on the game, and supporting it with \\"a media and marketing blitz\\". It was planned as the first release of iMagicGames, created in March 1999 when Interactive Magic divided its business into halves dedicated to online and browser games and to retail CD-ROMs, the latter handled by iMagicGames. By April, Mortyr was set to launch in May. Before its release, Interactive Magic called the game the \\"likely successor to the wildly popular Wolfenstein.\\" As part of the promotional campaign, the company demonstrated a pre-release version of the game at the Extreme Annihilation tournament held by the Cyberathlete Professional League. In April, the publisher reported that four stores, including Best Buy, had declined to carry Mortyr because of its Nazi themes and visuals. Walmart also refused to carry the game. While Best Buy offered \\"no comment\\" on its decision, CNET Gamecenter reported fansite Mortyr.net's owner as saying that he had been told \\"it isn't because of content, but because they feel the game falls into a crowded category.\\" GameSpot's Dunkin remarked of the situation, \\"Best Buy, on the other hand, reportedly says that it doesn't want to carry Mortyr because it won't sell.\\" On May 20, Interactive Magic sold iMagicGames to Ubi Soft, including Mortyr. The CD-ROM division had been unsuccessful, and the sale marked Interactive Magic's full transition into the online gaming arena, where it had been growing. Ubi Soft proceeded to drop the still-unreleased Mortyr in June. According to that company, the game was canceled because of its unsuitedness to Ubi Soft's brand. At the time, The Adrenaline Vault reported claims from an anonymous source involved with the decision that Mortyr was dropped because of its \\"history of development problems it has not wholly overcome.\\" According to the report, Interactive Magic purchased the game for a low price, and it was in \\"no condition to ship yet still served to increase the paper value of the CD-ROM side of IMagic's business.\\" Mortyr remained without a United States publisher by July 21, when Mirage released a downloadable demo for the game. In September, the game was picked up by publisher HD Interactive, which set it for an October release, before finally releasing the game Stateside in late December. Reception The game received unfavorable reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Jim Preston of Next Generation said, \\"Boring, derivative single-player and uninspired multiplayer action consign Mortyr to the bargain heap.\\" Sequel A sequel for the game, entitled Mortyr II, developed by Mirage and published by Hip Games, was released in 2004, five years after the original game.

Located at the intersection of Lorimer Street and Broadway in Brooklyn, it is served by the J train at all times except weekdays in the peak direction and the M train at all times except late nights. The Z train skips this station when it operates. History This station opened on June 25, 1888 as part of a westward extension of the Broadway Elevated to Driggs Avenue with the final terminus of Broadway Ferry opening a few weeks later. Upon the opening of the Williamsburg Bridge tracks, trains were rerouted after Marcy Avenue to Delancey Street (later renamed Essex Street).  Station layout There are two side platforms and three tracks. The center track is used by the J and Z trains in the peak direction weekday midday and rush hours. Both platforms have beige windscreens and red canopies with green frames and support columns. Some sections of the windscreen feature mesh to allow a view of the streets below. The station name plates are in the standard black with white lettering. The 2002 artwork here is called Roundlet Series by Annette Davidek.willethauser.com It features 16 stained glass panels on the platform windscreens that are 36 inches tall and 36 inches wide. They all have a floral and vine theme. =Exits= Southwestern stair This station has two entrances/exits. The full-time side is an elevated station house beneath the tracks on the northwest end. Inside fare control, it has one staircase to each platform at their extreme ends and a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions. Outside fare control, there is a turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases to the street. One goes down to the northwest corner of Broadway and Lorimer Street while the other goes down to the southeast peninsula formed by Throop Avenue, Lorimer Street, and Broadway. The northbound platform has an additional staircase going up to a work level above the mezzanine. The station's other entrance/exit is unstaffed and has a sealed elevated station house beneath the tracks. A single staircase from each platform goes down to the station house landing, where a single high entry/exit turnstile provides entrance/exit from the system. Another staircase then goes down to either western corner of Wallabout Street and Broadway. Broadway on the IND Crosstown Line is about two blocks to the west from the full-time entrance at Lorimer Street. Despite demands from G riders, there is no permanent free transfer from Lorimer Street to there; a free transfer was temporarily created in Summer 2014 due to the Hurricane Sandy-related shutdown of the IND Crosstown Line under the Newtown Creek. A free transfer using a MetroCard between Broadway and Lorimer Street stations was provided during the 14th Street Tunnel shutdown from April 2019 until May 31, 2020 during weekends and late nights. The transfer was honored through the end of May 2020, even though L train tunnel work was completed on April 26.

Kommersant (Vlast). 2001-10-23 from February 27 to October 15, 1992 (Minister for Nationalities according to Carnegie Endowment for International Peace). Early life Born in Sverdlovsk, Valery Tishkov attended Moscow State University, where he received a B.A. in 1964. He earned an M.A. in 1969 from North-Eastern State University in Magadan, and a Ph.D. degree in 1978 from the USSR Academy of Sciences. Since 2000, he has been Director of the Institute of Ethnology and Anthropology of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IEA). Career Tishkov started his academic career in Canadian ethnohistory with two books on pre- Confederation Canada and the first Russian version of the History of Canada (1982). His publications gave birth to Canadian studies within Russia. In the 1980s he studied indigenous peoples and published a general text on the contemporary Amerindian population of North America. His primary interests were in political status, historic and comprehensive claims, Indian government and movements. Since 1990 he has focused on the ethnic factor in Russian transformation as well as on the theory and political practice of ethnicity. Tishkov‚Äôs theoretical challenge came also from his formula ‚ÄòForget the Nation‚Äô (2000) where he suggested a post-nationalist understanding of nationalism. He argued that the nation is a powerful metaphor which two forms of social groupings ‚Äì polity and ethnic entity ‚Äì are fighting to have as their exclusive property. There is no sense in defining states and ethnic groups by the category of nation. The latter is a ghost word, escalated to a level of meta- category through historical accident and the inertia of intellectual prescription. A suggested ‚Äòhard scenario‚Äô for breaking the methodological impasse is a ‚Äòzero option‚Äô, when both major clients for being a nation will be deprived of a luxury called by that label. He edited two fundamental encyclopedias on ethnic groups of Russia (1994) and ethnic groups and religions of the world (1998) that present a comprehensive enterprise in ethnographic reference literature. Tishkov is a full member of the Russian Academy of Sciences. Since 2005 he has been a member of the Public Chamber of Russia. Key Publications * (1990) Indigenous Peoples of North America.

The refrain states: :He'd fly through the air with the greatest of ease, :That daring young man on the flying trapeze. The song was first published in 1867, with words written by the British lyricist and singer George Leybourne, music by Gaston Lyle, and arrangement by Alfred Lee. The lyrics were based on the phenomenal success of trapeze artist Jules L√©otard, for whom the one-piece dancer's garment was named. The following century, the song inspired the 1934 short story The Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze by William Saroyan. The film Man on the Flying Trapeze came out in 1935, starring W. C. Fields and Mary Brian. This song is sometimes associated with Emmett Kelly, who performed as a trapeze artist before becoming famous as a clown. Recordings Comedian Walter O'Keefe recorded the song in 1932, but owing to poor depression-era record sales, it took 2 years to become a hit. It was his theme song whenever he appeared on radio or television. It was later recorded by Don Redman & His Orchestra (1936), Eddie Cantor, Burl Ives, Cliff \\"Ukulele Ike\\" Edwards, Spike Jones, Ian Whitcomb, Les Paul & Mary Ford, Bing Crosby (for his 1962 album On the Happy Side), Alvin and the Chipmunks, Crispin Hellion Glover, Graham Parker, and Bruce Springsteen, among others. It also appeared (as \\"Flying Beat\\") on the MGM album The Beatles with Tony Sheridan & Guests, performed by The Titans. In 1994, the people at Disney wrote their own lyrics of this song for the Mickey's Fun Songs home video: \\"Let's Go to the Circus\\". JibJab also used this song to reflect the events that occurred in the year 2010, dubbed as \\"So Long To Ya, 2010\\". Cinema A version preceding the Fields film was performed by the Our Gang (Little Rascals) kids as the International Silver String Submarine Band in the 1934 short film Mike Fright. A second Our Gang rendition, by Carl \\"Alfalfa\\" Switzer, was later included in the 1939 short Clown Princes. The passengers on the bus sing the song in the 1934 Frank Capra film It Happened One Night. The song was the basis of the 1934 Popeye the Sailor musical cartoon The Man on the Flying Trapeze. In the 1934 Fox film George White's Scandals, the song is performed by Rudy Vallee. Dick Powell sings it twice in the 1934 film Twenty Million Sweethearts. In the 1936 film Bengal Tiger, a group of the circus performers sing the song together in a bar after a performance. In the 1954 film The Bridges at Toko-Ri the USS Savo Island band plays the refrain while Mickey Rooney's character (CPO Mike Forney) is being transferred via highline to a ship alongside. A brief variation of this song with altered lyrics is sung by Alan Tracy and Tin-Tin Kyrano in the 1968 film Thunderbird 6, based on Gerry Anderson's popular television series, Thunderbirds The song was performed by young children in the Technicolor 1934 Vitaphone short \\"Show Kids\\", written by Joe Traub and directed by Ralph Staub. In the 1997 film George of the Jungle the song plays as the title character swings on jungle vines. There is also a short sequence in the 2013 film The Lone Ranger, where the song is played as background music when the heroes of the movie go to a traveling carnival with a brothel.

As an investigative journalist in the 1970s, he began focusing on death penalty cases, which led to a career exposing and publicizing the injustices and misconduct in the legal system. Warden's work was instrumental in the blanket commutation of death row cases in Illinois in 2003 and in the abolition of the Illinois death penalty in 2011. Warden has done pioneering research work in the field of wrongful convictions that has paved the way for widespread changes in criminal justice practices, including changes in interrogation methods, in eyewitness identification procedures as well as exposing the over-reliance by prosecutors of jailhouse informants and false confessions. Warden is also the author of several books on wrongful conviction cases. Early career Warden grew up in Carthage, Missouri. He began his journalism career in Missouri in 1960 at the Joplin Globe and went on to work at the Columbia Tribune, the Kalamazoo Gazette, and then in 1965 to the Chicago Daily News, where he was an award- winning Chicago beat reporter and a foreign correspondent until it folded in 1978. At the Daily News, in the mid-1970s, he served as a foreign correspondent based in Beirut, where he and his wife and children were under siege in an ocean-front hotel for several days before they were evacuated.  Career in Criminal Justice Journalism  In 1978, after Warden was asked by a progressive bar association to expand its newsletter, he launched the Chicago Lawyer, which began by reporting on the judicial selection process but soon expanded to reporting on false confessions, police misconduct and judicial incompetence. In 1982, The Chicago Lawyer published its first of many investigative stories focusing on the ‚ÄúFord Heights Four‚Äù a highly publicized case in which 4 young black men had been convicted by an all-white jury of murder. Warden was first alerted to the gross prosecutorial misconduct which would later be uncovered in that case when he received an unsolicited letter from one of the defendants on death row. It took another 15 years until the wrongfully convicted inmates were to be released and exonerated, after receiving help from students at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern who investigated the case for a school assignment. Warden's reporting was also instrumental in the first DNA-based exoneration in Illinois‚Äîthat of Gary Dotson who had been falsely convicted of a rape that in fact had not occurred. The Chicago Lawyer focused on many other Death Row cases including Darby Tillis and Perry Cobb, Rolando Cruz and Alex Hernandez, all of whom were later exonerated. In a law review article, Warden described how he had evolved from a supporter of capital punishment into a crusader for abolition‚Äîreferring to a thesis advanced by Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall that the average citizen, if fully informed of the realities of capital punishment, would ‚Äúfind it shocking to his conscience and sense of justice.‚Äù  Career in Criminal Justice Reform  In 1999, Warden helped found the Center on Wrongful Convictions, part of the Bluhm Legal Clinic at Northwestern University School of Law. During his tenure there (1999-2014), the Center was instrumental in approximately 25 exonerations of innocent men and women in Illinois. Warden is the co-author with James Tuohy of Greylord: Justice, Chicago Style (about \\"Operation Greylord\\" a sting investigation into judicial corruption in Chicago) and with David Protess of A Promise of Justice (about the wrongful convictions of ‚Äúthe Ford Heights Four‚Äù) and Gone in the Night (about the false conviction of a suburban Chicago man for the murder of his stepdaughter). He contributed legal analysis for a 2005 Northwestern edition reprinting of The Dead Alive, a 19th-century novel by Wilkie Collins based on the 1819 wrongful murder convictions of two brothers in Vermont. In 2009, Warden edited True Stories of False Confessions, an anthology of 29 articles on false confessions published by Northwestern University Press in 2009. In 2018, the Journal of Law & Social Policy published a comprehensive article by Warden and co-author Daniel Lennard on the American experience with capital punishment. In 2015 he joined Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Rick Tulsky to launch Injustice Watch.

Melanesian mythology is the folklore, myths and religion of Melanesia ‚Äî the archipelagos of New Guinea, the Torres Strait Islands, the Admiralty Islands, Solomon Islands, New Caledonia and Vanuatu. Professor Roland Burrage Dixon wrote an account of the mythology of this region for The Mythology of All Races, which was published in 1916. Since that time, the region has developed new cults and legends as a result of exposure to western civilisations and their missionaries. These include the cargo cults in which the natives attempt to restore the supply of material goods which were a side- effect of the campaigning in this region during the Pacific War. Geography Melanesia falls into two geographic divisions: New Guinea with the smaller adjacent islands forming one, and the long series of islands lying to the north and east of it, from the Admiralty Group to New Caledonia and Fiji, constituting the other. From the anthropological point of view the population of the Melanesian area is exceedingly complex, being composed of a number of different racial types. While detailed knowledge of the area is still too fragmentary to render conclusions other than tentative, it may be said that at least three groups can be recognized. Presumably most ancient and underlying all others, though now confined to certain of the more inaccessible parts of the interior of New Guinea and possibly to some few islands of the Eastern Archipelago, are a number of Negrito or Negrito-like tribes in regard to which we thus far have only the scantiest details. The bulk of the population of the interior of New Guinea, of considerable stretches of its southern, south- western, and northern coasts, and of portions of other islands forms a second stratum known as Papuan. Mythological material from them is exceedingly scanty. The third type is that which occupies much of south-eastern New Guinea, together with part of its northern and north-western coasts, and forms the majority of the inhabitants of the islands reaching from the Admiralty Islands to Fiji. Strictly speaking, the term Melanesian should be applied to this group only; and from it and the Papuo-Melanesian mixtures the greater part of the myth material at present available has been derived. It is quite evident that no adequate presentation of the mythology of the whole Melanesian area, using the term in its broader geographical sense, can as yet be made; the most that can be done is to present an outline of the material derived from what is clearly the latest stratum of the population and to supplement this, when possible, by such fragmentary information as we possess from the older Papuan Group. Of Negrito mythology, here, as in the case of Indonesia, absolutely nothing is known. Summary The material on the mythology of Melanesia, though incomplete and fragmentary, appears rather clearly to prove the existence of two distinct strata, one of which may be called Papuan, the other Melanesian. The former is best represented among the Kai tribes of the region north of Huon Gulf in German New Guinea, as well as by the Baining and Sulka of northern New Britain, and may be traced, more or less plainly, among the remaining coastal tribes of both German and British New Guinea; whereas it is much less apparent in the Banks Islands, the New Hebrides, and Fiji. The Melanesian stratum, on the other hand, is perhaps best developed in eastern Melanesia, i.e. Santa Cruz, the Banks Islands, the New Hebrides, and Fiji; though it is well represented throughout the New Guinea littoral districts, among the coast tribes of northern New Britain and in the Admiralty Islands. What has been called the Papuan type of mythology seems to be characterized by a relative absence of cosmogonic myths, by the prominence of ghosts, and by a general simplicity and naivete; and this category also appears to show an extensive development of tales of local distribution only, corresponding to the discreteness and lack of relationship on the linguistic side. The Melanesian stratum, on the other hand, exhibits a considerably greater evolution on the side of cosmogony, an especial fondness for cannibalistic tales, and a rudimentary dualistic character which is revealed in the many stories of the wise and foolish culture hero brothers. Further examination of this Melanesian type seems to indicate that it is by no means a unit, although, because of the character of the material, any conclusions must be wholly tentative. The following grouping is suggested: :#myths of general distribution throughout Melanesia; :#those confined more or less strictly to New Guinea and the immediate vicinity; and :#those similarly restricted in their distribution to Fiji, the New Hebrides, and the Banks and Santa Cruz Islands. If now, instead of limiting our view to Melanesia alone, we include the whole of the Oceanic area and endeavour to discover the relationship of Melanesian mythology to that of the adjacent sections, it appears that, whereas of the two main types (the Papuan and Melanesian) the former shows little in common with any of the other Oceanic regions, the latter, on the contrary, exhibits numerous and interesting relationships with Indonesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia, and some even with Australia. The Melanesian type of incidents which reveal similarities with these other areas may be divided into four groups: :#those whose resemblances are only with Indonesia; :#only with Polynesia; :#with both Indonesia and Polynesia; and :#with Micronesia. The first of these groups is represented much more strongly in New Guinea than in the eastern archipelago; and in New Guinea it is far more prominent on the northern coast than on the southern. It would seem to manifest influences from Indonesia which, in the course of migrations eastward, did not extend beyond Melanesia, and which were greater in New Guinea and its vicinity than in the eastern and more distant archipelagos. The second group‚Äîrather unexpectedly‚Äîis, like the first, more prominent in New Guinea than farther east, but is better represented on the south coast than is the first group. From the character of the incidents and their distribution in Melanesia and Polynesia this group itself would appear to comprise (a) incidents preponderantly Melanesian, borrowed by the Polynesian ancestors and carried with them into Polynesia, and {b) incidents of Polynesian development which have been transmitted westward as a result of the probable late reflex of Polynesian peoples into parts of eastern Melanesia. The third group, comprising myth-incidents from Indonesia, Melanesia, and Polynesia, is contrasted with both the others in that it is best represented in eastern Melanesia. Theoretically, these incidents may be regarded as a portion of those brought by the Polynesian ancestors from their Indonesian homes and still preserved by them in Polynesia. Their presence in Melanesia would thus be hypothetically due to their having been taken over from the migrant Polynesians, and their greater prominence in the eastern archipelago would be expected, as it was presumably in this area, rather than in New Guinea, that, during their migration, the Polynesian ancestors made their longest halt and exerted their greatest influence on the aboriginal population. The last group, which is composed of those incidents common to Melanesia and Micronesia, is about equally represented in New Guinea and the eastern archipelago. The relatively large number of similarities between Micronesia and Melanesia is only what we should expect, owing to the many evidences derived from other sources, of relationship between the peoples of the two areas; but the amount of agreement with eastern Melanesia is rather striking. Myths of origins and the deluge Apparently one of the clearest characteristics of the mythology of the Melanesian area is the almost total lack of myths relating to the origin of the world. With one or two exceptions, the earth seems to be regarded as having always existed in very much the same form as today. In the Admiralty Islands a portion of the population believed that once there was nothing but a widespread sea; and one myth states that in this sea swam a great serpent, who, desiring a place on which he might rest, called out, \\"Let the reef rise!\\", and the reef rose out of the ocean and became dry land. Another version differs in that a man and a woman, after having floated upon the primeval sea, climbed upon a piece of driftwood and wondered whether the ocean would dry up or not. At last the waters wholly retired, and land appeared covered with hills, but barren and without life; whereupon the two beings planted trees and created foods of various sorts. In New Britain, among the coastal tribes of the Gazelle Peninsula, we find the familiar story of the fishing of the land from the bottom of the sea, a task which was accomplished by the two culture hero brothers, To-Kabinana and To-Karvuvu, some of whose other deeds will be recounted later. The same story in slightly greater detail is found also in the southern New Hebrides. This conception of a primeval sea is found widely in central Polynesia, Micronesia, and Indonesia, and it is perhaps significant that it apparently occurs in Melanesia only on its northern margin, where contact with non-Melanesian peoples would theoretically be expected. A much closer affiliation with Polynesia is shown, however, in another class of origin-myths to which we may now turn. If there is little interest in the beginning of the world in the Melanesian area, the same cannot be said of the origin of mankind, for on this subject there is considerable and widely variant material. Three types of myths may be recognized: one, that in which mankind is directly created by some deity or pre-existing being; second, that in which man comes into being spontaneously or magically; and, third, that where mankind descends to earth from the sky-land. =Creation of mankind= In the Admiralty Islands it is said that Manual was alone and longed for a wife; so he took his axe, went into the forest, and cut down a tree, and after he had fashioned the trunk into the figure of a woman, he said, \\"My wood there, become a woman!\\", and the image came to life. In the Banks Islands a somewhat more elaborate tale is told. Qat was the first to make man, cutting wood out of the dracaena-tree and forming it into six figures, three men and three women. When he had finished them, he hid them away for three days, after which he brought them forth and set them up. Dancing in front of them and seeing that they began to move, he beat the drum before them, and they moved still more, and \\"thus he beguiled them into life, so that they could stand of themselves.\\" Then he divided them into three pairs as husband and wife. Now Marawa, who was a malicious, envious fellow, saw what Qat had made and determined to do likewise. So he took wood of another sort, and when he had fashioned the images, he set them up and beat the drum before them, and gave them life as Qat had done. But when he saw them move, he dug a pit and covered the bottom with coco-nut fronds, burying his men and women in it for seven days; and when he dug them up again, he found them lifeless and decomposed, this being the origin of death among men. According to another version from this same area, while the first man was made of red clay by Qat, he created the first woman of rods and rings of supple twigs covered with the spathes of sago palms, just as they make the tall hats which are used in the sacred dances. A tale of the creation of man from earth is told in the New Hebrides. \\"Takaio made from mud ten figures of men. When they were finished, he breathed upon them, breathed upon their eyes, their ears, their mouths, their hands, their feet, and thus the images became alive. But all the people he had made were men and Takaro was not satisfied, so he told them to light a fire and cook some-food. When they had done so, he ordered them to stand still and he threw at one of them a fruit, and lo! one of the men was changed into a woman. Then Takaro ordered the woman to go and stay by herself in the house. After a while, he sent one of the nine men to her to ask for fire, and she greeted him as her elder brother. A second was sent to ask for water, and she greeted him as her younger brother. And so one after another, she greeted them as relatives, all but the last, and him she called her husband. So Takaro said to him, \\"Take her as your wife, and you two shall live together.\\" A still different version is that from New Britain. In the beginning a being drew two figures of men upon the ground, and then, cutting himself with a knife, he sprinkled the two drawings with his blood and covered them over with leaves, the result being that they came to life as To-Kabinana and To-Karvuvu. The former then climbed a coco-nut-tree which bore light yellow nuts, and picking two unripe ones, he threw them to the ground, where they burst and changed into two women, whom he took as his wives. His brother asked him how he had come to be possessed of the two women, and To-Kabinana told him. Accordingly, To-Karvuvu also climbed a tree and likewise threw down two nuts; but they fell so that their under side struck the ground, and from them came two women with depressed, ugly noses. So To-Karvuvu was jealous because his brother's wives were better looking than his, and he took one of To-Kabinana's spouses, abandoning the two ugly females who were his own. Another version from the same region brings out more clearly the distinction between the characters of the two brothers and serves moreover, to account for the two marriage classes into which the people are divided. To-Kabinana said to To-Karvuvu, \\"Do you get two light-coloured coco-nuts. One of them you must hide, then bring the other to me\\". To-Karvuvu, however, did not obey, but got one light and one dark nut, and having hidden the latter, he brought the light-coloured one to his brother, who tied it to the stem of his canoe, and seating himself in the bow, paddled out to sea. He paid no attention to the noise that the nut made as it struck against the sides of his canoe nor did he look around. Soon the coco- nut turned into a handsome woman, who sat on the stem of the canoe and steered, while To-Kabinana paddled. When he came back to land, his brother was enamoured of the woman and wished to take her as his wife, but To-Kabinana refused his request and said that they would now make another woman. Accordingly, To-Karvuvu brought the other coco-nut, but when his brother saw that it was dark-coloured, he upbraided To-Karvuvu and said: \\"You are indeed a stupid fellow. You have brought misery upon our mortal race. From now on, we shall be divided into two classes, into you and us.\\" Then they tied the coco- nut to the stem of the canoe, and paddling away as before, the nut turned into a black-skinned woman; but when they had retumed to shore, To-Kabinana said: \\"Alas, you have only ruined our mortal race. If all of us were only light of skin, we should not die. Now, however, this dark-skinned woman will produce one group, and the light-skinned woman another, and the light-skinned men shall marry the dark-skinned women, and the dark-skinned men shall marry the light-skinned women.\\" And so To-Kabinana divided mankind into two classes. =Origin of mankind from other sources= Turning now to the second type of tales of the origin of mankind, the belief in a direct or indirect origin from birds may first be considered. In the Admiralty Islands, according to one version, a dove bore two young, one of which was a bird and one a man, who became the ancestor of the human race by incestuous union with his mother. Another recension has it that a tortoise laid ten eggs from which were hatched eight tortoises and two human beings, one man and one woman; and these two, marrying, became the ancestors of both light-skinned and dark-skinned people. At the other extremity of Melanesia, in Fiji, it is said that a bird laid two eggs which were hatched by Ndengei, the great serpent, a boy coming from one and a girl from the other. A variant of this is found in Torres Straits where, according to the Eastern Islanders, a bird having laid an egg, a maggot or worm was developed from it, which then was transformed into human shape. Myths of the origin of men or of deities from a clot of blood are of interest in their relation to other areas in Oceania. One version again comes from the Admiralty Islands. A woman, named Hi-asa, who lived alone, one day cut her finger while shaving pandanus strips. Collecting the blood from the wound in a mussel-shell, she put a cover over it and set it away; but when, after eleven days, she looked in the shell, it contained two eggs. She covered them up, and after several days they burst, one producing a man and the other a woman, who became the parents of the human race. In the neighbouring island of New Britain one account gives a similar origin for the two brothers To-Rabinana and To-Karvuvu. While an old woman was wading in the sea searching for shellfish, her arms pained her, and so, taking two sharp strips of pandanus, she scratched and cut first one arm and then the other. The two strips of pandanus, thus covered with her blood, she laid away in a heap of refuse which she intended to burn; but after a time the pile began to swell, and when she was about to set fire to it, she saw that two boys had grown from her blood‚Äîfrom the blood of her right arm, To-Kabinana, and from that of her left arm, To-Karvuvu. At several points in German New Guinea we find similar tales of children originating from clots of blood, although here they are not considered as the parents of mankind. An origin of the human race from plants seems definitely stated only in the Solomon Islands, where it is said that two knots began to sprout on a stalk of sugar-cane, and when the cane below each sprout burst, from one issued a man and from the other a woman, these becoming the parents of mankind. With this we may compare the tales from New Britain. Two men (sometimes described as To-Kabinana and To-Karvuvu) were fishing at night, and while they were so engaged a piece of wild sugar-cane floated into the net, where it became entangled. Disengaging it, they threw it away, but again it was enmeshed and was once more discarded. When, however, it was caught for the third time, they determined to plant it, and did so. Taking root, the cane grew, and after a time it began to swell, until one day, while the two men were absent at work, the stalk burst and from it came out a woman who cooked food for the men and then returned to her hiding-place. The two came back from their work and were much surprised to find their food ready for them; but since the same thing occurred the next day, on the following morning they hid themselves to see who it was that had prepared their food. After a time the stalk opened and the woman came out, whereupon they immediately seized her and held her fast. In some versions, the woman then became the wife of one of the men, and all mankind are supposed to be descended from the pair. An origin of the first woman from a tree and of the first man from the ground is given by the Papuan tribes of Elema in British New Guinea; while in the New Hebrides the first female being is said to have sprung from a cowrie-shell which turned into a woman. An origin of man from stone is told by the Baining of New Britain. At first the only beings in the world were the sun and the moon, but they married, and from their union were born stones and birds, the former subsequently turning into men, the latter into women, and from these the Baining are descended. The origin of Qat himself is ascribed in the Banks Group to a stone, which in the beginning burst asunder and gave birth to the culture hero‚Äîa concept which recalls the tales of the source of the first supernatural beings in Tonga, Celebes, and the Union and Gilbert Groups. The third type of myths of the beginning of mankind has thus far been reported apparently only from one portion of German New Guinea. =Origin of the sea= Although Melanesia seems characteristically to lack myths of the origin of the world, a tale recounting the source of the sea is quite widely spread. As told by the Baining in New Britain, the story runs as follows. In the beginning the sea was very small‚Äîonly a tiny water-hole, belonging to an old woman and from which she got the salt water for the flavouring of her food. She kept the hole concealed under a cover of tapa cloth, and though her two sons repeatedly asked her whence she obtained the salt water, she refused to answer. So they determined to watch and eventually surprised her in the act of lifting the cover and dipping up the salt water. When she had gone they went to the spot and tore the cover open; and the farther they tore, the larger became the water-hole. Terrified by this, they ran away, each carrying a corner of the cloth; and thus the water spread and spread until it became the sea, which rose so that only a few rocks, covered with earth, remained above it. When the old woman saw that the sea constantly grew larger, she feared that the entire world would be covered by it, so she hastily planted some twigs along the edge of the shore, thus preventing the ocean from destroying all things. =Origin of the sun and moon= Of the origin of the sun and moon various tales are told. In the Admiralty Islands it is said that when the sea had dried so that man appeared, the first two beings, after planting trees and creating food plants, made two mushrooms, one of which the man threw into the sky, creating the moon, while the woman tossed the other upward and formed the sun. A different account is given by the people of southern British New Guinea. According to this, a man was digging a deep hole one day when he uncovered the moon as a small bright object. After he had taken it out, it began to grow, and finally, escaping from his hands, rose high into the sky. Had the moon been left in the ground until it was born naturally, it would have given a brighter light; but since it was taken out prematurely, it sheds only feeble rays. With this we may compare a tale from German New Guinea which recounts how the moon was originally kept hidden in a jar by an old woman. Some boys discovered this, and coming secretly, opened the jar, whereupon the moon flew out; and though they tried to hold it, it slipped from their grasp and rose into the sky, bearing the marks of their hands on its surface. The people of Woodlark Island have another tale in which the origin of the sun and moon is connected with the origin of fire. According to this, in the beginning an old woman was the sole owner of fire, and she alone could eat cooked food, while other people must devour theirs raw. Her son said to her: \\"You are cruel. You see that the taro takes the skin off our throats, yet you do not give us fire with which to cook it\\"; but since she proved obdurate, he stole some of the flame and gave it to the rest of mankind. In anger at his action, the old woman seized what was left of her fire, divided it into two parts, and threw them into the sky, the larger portion thus becoming the sun, and the smaller the moon. In all of these myths the sun and moon seem to be regarded as inanimate objects, or at least as such in origin. Another group of tales, however, considers them to be living beings. As an example we may take the version given by one of the tribes of the Massim district of British New Guinea. One day a woman who was watching her garden close to the ocean, seeing a great fish sporting in the surf, walked out into the water and played with the fish, continuing to do this for several days. By and by the woman's leg, against which the fish had rubbed, began to swell and became painful until at last she got her father to make a cut in the swelling, when out popped an infant. The boy, who was named Dudugera, grew up among the other children of the village until one day, in playing a game, he threw his dart at the other children rather than at the mark, whereupon they became angry and abused him, taunting him with his parentage. Fearing lest the others might really harm him, Dudugera's mother determined to send him to his father; so she took the boy to the beach, whereupon the great fish came, seized him in his mouth, and carried him far away to the east. Before he left, Dudugera warned his mother and relatives to take refuge under a great rock, for soon, he said, he would climb into a pandanus-tree and thence into the sky, and, as the sun, would destroy all things with his heat. So Indeed, it came to pass, for excepting his mother and her relatives, who heeded Dudugera's advice, nearly everything perished. To prevent their total annihilation his mother took a lime-calabash, and climbing upon a hill near which the sun rose, cast the lime into his face as he came up, which caused the sun to shut his eyes and thus to decrease the amount of heat. The concept that originally there was no night is rather characteristic of Melaneslan mythology: day was perpetual and night was discovered or brought to mankind. In the Banks Islands, after Qat had formed men, pigs, trees, and rocks he still did not know how to make night, for daylight was continuous. His brothers said to him, \\"Thls is not at all pleasant. Here is nothing but day. Can't you do something for us?\\" Now Qat heard that at Vava in the Torres Islands there was night, so he took a pig, and went to Vava, where he bought night from I-Qong, Night, who lived there. Other accounts say that Qat sailed to the edge of the sky to buy night from Night, who blackened his eyebrows, showed him sleep and taught him how to make the dawn. Qat returned to his brothers, bringing a fowl and other birds to give notice of the dawn. He begged his brothers to prepare beds of coco-nut fronds. Then for the first time, they saw the sun sinking in the west, and they cried out to Qat that it was crawling away. \\"'It will soon be gone,' said he, 'and if you see a change on the face of the earth, that is night,' Then he let go the night, 'What is this coming out of the sea,' they cried, 'and covering the sky?' 'That is night,' said he, 'sit down on both sides of the house, and when you feel something in your eyes, lie down and be quiet.' Presently it was dark, and their eyes began to blink. 'Qat! Qat! what is this? Shall we die?' 'Shut your eyes,' said he, 'that is it, go to sleep.' When night had lasted long enough the cock began to crow and the birds to twitter; Qat took a piece of red obsidian and cut the night with it; the light over which the night had spread itself shone forth again, and Qat's brothers awoke.\\" =Origin of fire= Myths of the origin of fire present a number of interesting types in the Melanesian area. We may begin with the form widely current in British New Guinea. According to a version told by the Motu, the ancestors of the present people had no fire, and ate their food raw or cooked it in the sun until one day they perceived smoke, rising out at sea. A dog, a snake, a bandicoot, a bird, and a kangaroo all saw this smoke and asked, \\"Who will go to get fire?\\" First the snake said that he would make the attempt, but the sea was too rough, and he was compelled to come back. Then the bandicoot went, but he, too, had to return. One after another, all tried but the dog, and all were unsuccessful. Then the dog started and swam and swam until he reached the island whence the smoke rose. There he saw women cooking with fire, and seizing a blazing brand, he ran to the shore and swam safely back with it to the mainland, where he gave it to all the people. Some of the Massim tribes of eastern British New Guinea give quite a different origin, according to which people had no fire in the beginning, but simply warmed and dried their food in the sun. There was, however, a certain old woman called Goga who thus prepared food for ten of the youths, but for herself she cooked food with fire, which she obtained from her own body. Before the boys came home each day, she cleared away all traces of the fire and every scrap of cooked food that they should not know her secret; but one day a piece of boiled taro accidentally got among the lads' food, and when the youngest ate it, he found it much better than what was usually given him. The youths resolved to discover the secret, so the next day, when they went to hunt, the youngest hid at home and saw the old woman take the fire from her body and cook with it. After his companions had returned, he told them what he had seen, and they determined to steal some of the fire. Accordingly, on the following day they cut down a huge tree, over which all tried to jump, but only the youngest succeeded, so they selected him to steal the fire. He waited until the others had gone, and then creeping back to the house, he seized the firebrand when the old woman was not looking, and ran off with it. The old woman chased him, but he jumped over the tree, which she was unable to do. As he ran on, however, the brand burned his hand, and he dropped it in the dry grass, which caught the blaze and set fire to a pandanus-tree which was near. Now, in a hole in this tree, lived a snake, whose tail caught fire and burned like a torch. The old woman, finding that she could not overtake the thief, caused a great rain to fall, hoping thus to quench the fire, but the snake stayed in his hole, and his tail was not extinguished. When the rain had stopped, the boys went out to look for fire, but found none, because the rain had put it all out; but at last they saw the hole in the tree, pulled out the snake, and broke off its tail, which was still alight. Then making a great pile of wood, they set fire to it, and people from all the villages came and got flame, which they took home with them. \\"Different folk used different kinds of wood for their firebrands and the trees from which they took their brands became their pitani (totems).\\" A snake in this tale plays the part of the saviour of fire; but in other forms of the myth the serpent is the real source or bringer of flame. A version from the Admiralty Islands runs as follows: The daughter of Ulimgau went into the forest. The serpent saw her, and said, \\"Come!\\" and the woman replied, \\"Who would have you for a husband? You are a serpent. I will not marry you.\\" But he replied, \\"My body is indeed that of a serpent, but my speech is that of a man. Come!\\" And the woman went and married him, and after a time she bore a boy and a girl, and her serpent husband put her away, and said, \\"Go, I will take care of them and give them food.\\" And the serpent fed the children and they grew. And one day they were hungry, and the serpent said to them, \\"Do you go and catch fish.\\" And they caught fish and brought them to their father. And he said, \\"Cook the fish.\\" And they replied, \\"The sun has not yet risen.\\" By and by the sun rose and warmed the fish with its rays, and they ate the food still raw and bloody. Then the serpent said to them, \\"You two are spirits, for you eat your food raw. Perhaps you will eat me. You, girl, stay; and you, boy, crawl into my belly.\\" And the boy was afraid and said, \\"What shall I do?\\" But his father said to him, \\"Go,\\" and he crept into the serpent's belly. And the serpent said to him, \\"Take the fire and bring it out to your sister. Come out and gather coco-nuts and yams and taro and bananas.\\" So the boy crept out again, bringing the fire from the belly of the serpent. And then having brought the food, the boy and girl lit a fire with the brand which the boy had secured and cooked the food. And when they had eaten, the serpent said to them, \\"Is my kind of food or your kind of food the better?\\" And they answered, \\"Your food is good, ours is bad.\\" Similar to this in that the igneous element was obtained from snakes, but on the other hand suggesting aflinities with the fire-quest of the Polynesian Maui, is a myth current in New Britain. There was once a time when the Sulka were ignorant of fire; but one day a man named Emakong lost one of his ornaments, which fell into a stream. Taking off his loin-cloth he jumped in and dove to recover the lost object, but was amazed, on reaching the bottom, to find himself in the yard of a house. Many people came up and asked him his name, and when he replied that he was called Emakong, one of them said, \\"Oh, that is also my name,\\" whereupon he took the bewildered man to his house and gave him a new loin-cloth. Great was Emakong's astonishment to see a fire in the house. At first he was afraid of it, but after he had been given cooked food and had found this much better than the raw viands which he had always eaten before, he lost his fear of the new thing. When it became night, the crickets began to sing and this also alarmed him, for in the world above there was no night, and crickets were unknown. His terror became still greater, however, when he heard resounding claps of thunder from every side and saw all the people turn into snakes in order to sleep. His namesake reassured him, however, and said that he need not fear, for this was their custom, and that when day should come again, all would return to their human form. Then, with a loud report, he also changed into a snake, and Emakong alone retained the shape of man. In the morning, when the birds sang to announce the coming day, he awoke, and with a crash all the serpents again turned into men. His namesake now did up a package for him, containing night, some fire, some crickets, and the birds that sing at dawn, and with this Imakong left, rising through the water. On reaching the shore, he threw the fire into dry grass, but when the people saw the blaze and heard the crackling of the flame, they were greatly alarmed and all fled. Emakong, however, ran after them and telling them of his adventures, explained to them the use of the things that he had brought. =Origin of death= Although not cosmogonic in the stricter sense of the term, we may conveniently include here the myths given to account for the origin of death. According to the version current in Ambrym, the good and the malicious deities were discussing man after he had been made. The former said: \\"Our men seem to get on well, but haven't you noticed that their skins have begun to wrinkle? They are yet young, but when they are old, they will be very ugly. So when that happens, we will flay them like an eel, and a new skin will grow, and thus men shall renew their youth like the snakes and so be immortal.\\" But the evil deity replied: \\"No, it shall not be that way. When a man is old and ugly, we will dig a hole in the ground and put the body in it, and thus it shall always be among his descendants.\\" And because the one who has the last word prevails, death came into the world. With this we may compare another form of myth as told in the Banks Islands, according to which, in the beginning men did not die, but cast their skins like snakes and crabs, and thus renewed their youth. One day an old woman went to a stream to change her skin and threw the old one into the water where, as it floated away, it caught upon a stick. When she went home, her child refused to recognize her in her new and youthful form, and to pacify the infant, who cried without ceasing, she returned and got her old skin, and put it on again. From that time men have ceased to cast their skins and have died when they grew old. According to other tales, death was due to a mistake. Thus in the Banks Islands it is said that in the beginning men lived forever, casting their skins, and that the permanence of property in the same hands led to much trouble. Qat, therefore, summoned a man called Mate (\\"Death\\") and laid him on a board and covered him over; after which he killed a pig and divided Mate's property among his descendants, all of whom came and ate of the funeral feast. On the fifth day, when the conch-shells were blown to drive away the ghost, Qat removed the covering, and Mate was gone; only his bones were left. Meanwhile, Qat had sent Tagaro the Foolish to watch the way to Panoi, where the paths to the underworld and the upper regions divide, to see that Mate did not go below; but the Fool sat before the way of the world above so that Mate descended to the lower realms; and ever since that time all men have followed Mate along the path he took. Still another explanation is that death was due to disobedience. Thus the Baining in New Britain say that one day the sun called all things together and asked which wished to live forever. All came except man; so the stones and the snakes live forever, but man must die. Had man obeyed the sun, he would have been able to change his skin from time to time like the snake, and so would have acquired immortality. As a last example of this class of myths we may take one which attributes the origin of death to ingratitude. In the Admiralty Group one account states that a man once went out fishing; but since an evil spirit wished to kill and eat him, he fled into the forest. There he caused a tree to open, and creeping inside, the tree closed again, so that when the evil being came, he did not see his victim and went away, whereupon the tree opened, and the man came out. The tree said to him, \\"Bring to me two white pigs,\\" so the man went to his village and got two pigs, but he cheated the tree in that he brought only a single white one, the other being black whitened with chalk. For this the tree rebuked him and said: \\"You are unthankful, though I was good to you. If you had done what I had asked, you might have taken refuge in me whenever danger threatened. Now you cannot, but must die.\\" So, as a result of this man's ingratitude, the human race is doomed to mortality and cannot escape the enmity of evil spirits. =Deluge and Flood= Of deluge-myths from the Melanesian area, only a few have been reported which do not bear the marks of missionary influence. As told in British New Guinea, the story runs that once a great flood occurred, and the sea rose and overflowed the earth, the hills being covered, and people and animals hurrying to the top of Tauaga, the highest mountain. But the sea followed and all were afraid. Yet the king of the snakes, Raudalo, did not fear. \\"At last he said to his servants, 'Where now are the waters?' And they answered, 'They are rising, lord.' Yet looked he not upon the flood. And after a space he said again, 'Where now are the waters?' and his servants answered as they had done before. And again he inquired of them, 'Where now are the waters?' But this time all the snakes, Titiko, Dubo and Anaur, made answer, 'They are here, and in a moment they will touch thee, lord.' \\"Then Raudalo turned him about, . . . and put forth his forked tongue, and touched with the tip of it the angry waters which were about to cover him. And on a sudden the sea rose no more, but began to flow down the side of the mountain. Still was Raudalo not content, and he pursued the flood down the hill, ever and anon putting forth his forked tongue that there might be no tarrying on the way. Thus went they down the mountain and over the plain country until the sea shore was reached. And the waters lay in their bed once more and the flood was stayed.\\" Another tale from this same region presents features of interest. One day a man discovered a lake in which were many fish; and at the bottom of the lake lived a magic eel, but the man knew it not. He caught many fish and returned the next day with the people of his village whom he had told of his discovery; and they also were very successful, while one woman even laid hold of the great eel, Abaia, who dwelt in the depths of the lake, though he escaped her. Now Abaia was angry that his fish had been caught and that he himself had been seized, so he caused a great rain to fall that night, and the waters of the lake also rose, and all the people were drowned except an old woman who had not eaten of the fish and who saved herself in a tree. The association of snakes and eels with the deluge in these tales strongly suggests the type of deluge-myth current in parts of Indonesia, and known also apparently in the Cook Group. =Geographical flow= From the examples given it may be seen that the origin-myths of Melanesia show clear evidence of composite origins. From small groups like the Admiralty Islands several quite different legends accounting for the same thing have been collected, and throughout the whole area a striking variety exists. In how far we are justified in attributing one set of myths to the older Papuan stratum and another to the later Melanesian layer is very difficult to say, since but little from the purer Papuan tribes of the area has as yet been recorded. Comparison with Polynesia and Indonesia suggests that the myths of the origin of the sea, of mankind as originally having had the power to renew their youth by changing skins, and of the obtaining of fire from or with the aid of snakes, were primarily Papuan, for no traces of either appear in Indonesia, and only the former is found in somewhat mutilated form in Samoa, but nowhere else in Polynesia. Other themes, however, such as the origin of human beings from eggs or from a clot of blood, are widely known in Indonesia and also occur in western and south-western Polynesia, and would seem to be immigrant elements from the great culture stream which, passing from Indonesia eastward into the Pacific, swept with greatest strength the north-eastern and south- eastern parts of Melanesia.  Culture Heroes  One of the most noteworthy features of Melanesian mythology is the prominence of tales relating either to two culture heroes, one of whom is, as a rule, wise and benevolent, while the other is foolish and malicious; or to a group of brothers, usually ten or twelve in number, two of whom, one wise and one foolish, are especially outstanding. Thus a rudimentary sort of dualism is developed which stands in rather marked contrast to Indonesian mythology, while showing points of contact with Polynesian and Micronesian ideas. In New Britain we have already seen how To-Karvuvu unsuccessfully imitated To-Kabinana in the making of woman; and in the local forms of the myth of the origin of death it was To- Karvuvu who cried and refused to recognize his mother when she had shed her skin and become rejuvenated, so that he was thus directly responsible for the entrance of death into the world. A few other examples of his foolishness may be given from the same region. According to one of these tales, To-Kabinana and To-Karvuvu were one day walking in the fields when the former said to the latter, \\"Go, and look after our mother.\\" So To-Karvuvu went, filled a bamboo vessel with water, poured it over his mother, heated stones in the fire, killed her, and laid her in the oven to roast, after which he returned to To- Kabinana, who asked him how their parent was and if he had taken good care of her. To-Karvuvu replied, \\"I have roasted her with the hot stones,\\" whereupon his brother demanded, \\"Who told you to do that?\\" \\"Oh,\\" he answered, \\"I thought you said to kill her!\\" but To-Kabinana declared, \\"Oh, you fool, you will die before me. You never cease doing foolish things. Our descendants now will cook and eat human flesh.\\" On another occasion To-Kabinana said to his brother, \\"Come, let us each build a house,\\" and accordingly each constructed a dwelling, but To-Kabinana roofed his house outside, while his foolish brother covered his on the inside. Then To-Kabinana said, \\"Let us make rain!\\" so they performed the proper ceremony, and in the night it rained. The darkness pressed heavily on To-Karvuvu so that he sat up, and the rain came through the roof of his house and fell upon him, and he wept. In the morning he came to his brother, saying, \\"The darkness pressed upon me, and the rain-water wet me, and I cried.\\" But when To-Kabinana asked, \\"How did you build your house?\\" the other replied, \\"I covered it with the roof covering inside. It is not like yours.\\" Then they both went to look at it, and To-Karvuvu said, \\"I will pull it down and build like yours.\\" But his brother had pity on him and said, \\"Do not do that. We will both of us live together in my house.\\" Many of the evil or harmful things in the world were the work of the foolish brother. One day To-Kabinana carved a Thum-fish out of wood and let it float on the sea and made it alive so that it might always be a fish; and the Thum-fish drove the Malivaran-fish ashore in great numbers so that they could be caught. Now To- Karvuvu saw them, and asked his brother where were the fish that forced the Malivaran-fish ashore, sa}ring that he also wished to make some. Accordingly, To-Kabinana told him to make the figure of a Thum-fish, but instead the stupid fellow carved the effigy of a shark and put it in the water. The shark, however, did not drive the other fish ashore, but ate them all up, so that To- Karvuvu went crying to his brother and said, \\"I wish I had not made my fish, for he eats all the others\\"; whereupon To-Kabinana asked, \\"What kind of a fish did you make?\\" and he replied, \\"A shark.\\" Then To-Kabinana said, \\"You are indeed a stupid fellow. You have brought it about that our descendants shall suffer. That fish will eat all the others, and he will also eat people as well.\\" The characters of the two brothers are seen to be quite clearly distinguished, To-Karvuvu being in these tales (as in many others from this same area) foolish or stupid rather than designedly malicious, although his follies are usually responsible for the troubles and tribulations of human life; whereas To-Kabinana, on the other hand, appears as actively benevolent, his well-intentioned deeds in behalf of mankind being frustrated by his brother. Tales of a similar type have been collected at one or two points on the German New Guinea shore, but appear to be much less common than among the coast population of New Britain. From British New Guinea few tales of this sort seem to have been collected, although stories of the wise and foolish brothers are very prevalent in the Solomon, Santa Cruz, and Banks Islands and the New Hebrides, where they are of the second type, in that, instead of the usual two brothers, we have a group of ten or twelve. In the Banks Islands Qat is the great hero, and many tales are told of him and his eleven brothers, all of whom were named Tagaro, one being Tagaro the Wise, and one Tagaro the Foolish. In the stories told in Mota, all seem to have combined against Qat and endeavoured to kill him; but in Santa Maria, another island of the group, Qat has his antithesis in Marawa, the Spider, a personage who in Mota seems to become Qat's friend and guide. Thus, according to one tale, when Qat had finished his work of creation, he proposed to his brothers, Tagaro, that they make canoes for themselves. Qat himself cut down a great tree and worked secretly at it every day, but made no progress, for each morning, when he came back to his task, he found that all that had been done the previous day was undone, and the tree-trunk made solid again. On finishing work one night, he determined to watch, and accordingly, making himself of very small size, he hid under a large chip which he carried away from the pile that he had made during the day. By and by a little old man appeared from a hole in the ground and began to put the chips back, each in the place from which it had been cut, until the whole tree-trunk was almost whole once more, only one piece being lacking, namely, that under which Qat had hidden himself. Finally the old man found it, but just as he was about to pick it up, Qat sprang out, grew to his full size, and raised his axe to kill the old man who had thus interfered with his work. The latter, however, who was Marawa in disguise, begged Qat to spare his life, promising to complete the canoe for him if he would do so. So Qat had mercy on Marawa, and he finished the boat, using his nails to scoop and scrape it out. When the canoes were finished, Qat told his brothers to launch theirs, and as each slipped into the water, he raised his hand, and the boat sank; whereupon Qat and Marawa appeared, paddling about in their canoe and surprising the other brothers, who had not known that Qat was at work. After this, the brothers tried to destroy Qat in order that they might possess his wife and canoe. \\"One day they took him to the hole of a land-crab under a stone, which they had already so prepared by digging under it that it was ready to topple over upon him. Qat crawled into the hole and began to dig for the crab; his brothers tipped over the stone upon him, and thinking him crushed to death, ran off to seize Ro Lei and the canoe. But Qat called on Marawa by name, 'Marawa! take me round about to Ro Lei,' and by the time that his brothers reached the village, there was Qat to their astonishment sitting by the side of his wife.\\" They tried to kill him in many other ways, but Qat was always the victor, and their plans were frustrated. The element of the opposition of the wise and foolish brothers is better brought out, it seems, in the New Hebrides, where Tagaro becomes the chief actor and is pitted against Suqe-matua. \\"Tagaro wanted everything to be good, and would have no pain or suffering; Suqe-matua would have all things bad. When Tagaro made things, he or Suqe-matua tossed them up into the air; what Tagaro caught is good for food, what he missed is worthless.\\" In a neighbouring island Tagaro is one of twelve brothers, as in the Banks Islands, and usually another of them is Suqe-matua, who continually thwarts him. In Lepers Island \\" Tagaro and Suqe-matua shared the work of creation, but whatever the latter did was wrong. Thus when they made the trees, the fruit of Tagaro's were good for food, but Suqe-matua's were bitter; when they created men, Tagaro said they should walk upright on two legs, but Suqe-matua said that they should go like pigs; Suqe- matua wanted to have men sleep in the trunks of sago palms, but Tagaro said they should work and dwell in houses. So they always disagreed, but the word of Tagaro prevailed. In this latter feature we have the exact opposite of the conditions in New Britain. Tagaro was said to be the father of ten sons, the cleverest of whom was Tagaro-Mbiti. In another portion of this island Tagaro's opponent, here known as Meragbuto, again becomes more of a simple fool, and many are the tricks that Tagaro plays upon him.\\" One day Meragbuto saw Tagaro, who had just oiled his hair with coco-nut oil, and admiring the effect greatly, asked how this result had been produced. Tagaro asked him if he had any hens, and when Meragbuto answered that he had many, Tagaro said: \\"Well, when they have roosted in the trees, do you go and sit under a tree, and anoint yourself with the ointment which they will throw down to you.\\" Meragbuto carried out the instructions exactly and rubbed not only his hair, but his whole body with the excrement of the fowls. On the following day he went proudly to a festival, but as soon as he approached everyone ran away, crying out at the intolerable odour; only then did Meragbuto realize that he had been tricked, and washed himself in the sea. Another time Tagaro placed a tabu upon all coco-nuts so that no one should eat them; but Meragbuto paid no attention to this prohibition, eating and eating until he had devoured nearly all of them. Thereupon Tagaro took a small coco-nut, scraped out half the meat, and leaving the rest in the shell, sat down to await the coming of Meragbuto, who appeared by and by, and seeing the coco-nut, asked Tagaro if it was his. \\"Yes,\\" said Tagaro, \\"if you are hungry, eat it, but only on condition that you eat it all.\\" So Meragbuto sat down and scraped the remainder of the nut and ate it; but though he scraped and scraped, more was always left, and so he continued eating all day. At night Meragbuto said to Tagaro, \\"My cousin, I can't eat any more, my stomach pains me.\\" But Tagaro answered, \\"No. I put a tabu on the coco-nuts, and you disregarded it; now you must eat it all.\\" So Meragbuto continued to eat until finally he burst and died. If he had not perished, there would have been no more coco-nuts, for he would have devoured them all. At last Tagaro determined to destroy Meragbuto, and accordingly he said, \\"Let us each build a house.\\" This they did, but Tagaro secretly dug a deep pit in the floor of his house and covered it over with leaves and earth; after which he said to Meragbuto: \\"Come, set fire to my house, so that I and my wife and children may be burned and die; thus you will become the sole chief.\\" So Meragbuto came and set fire to Tagaro's house, and then went to his own and lay down and slept. Tagaro and his family, however, quickly crawled into the pit which he had prepared, and so they escaped death; and when the house had burned, they came up out of their hiding-place and sat down among the ashes. After a time Meragbuto awoke, and saying, \\"Perhaps my meat is cooked,\\" he went to where Tagaro's house had been, thinking to find his victims roasted. Utterly amazed to see Tagaro and his family safe and sound, he asked how this had happened, and Tagaro replied that the flames had not harmed him at all. \\"Good!\\" said Meragbuto, \\"when it is night, do you come and set fire to my house and burn me also.\\" So Tagaro set fire to Meragbuto's house, but when the flames began to burn him, Meragbuto cried out, \\"My cousin! It hurts me. I am dying.\\" Tagaro, however, replied, \\"No, you will not die; it was just that way in my case. Bear it bravely; it will soon be over.\\" And so it was, for Meragbuto was burned up and entirely destroyed. Two points of special interest in connexion with these tales deserve brief discussion. One of the most characteristic features of Polynesian mythology is the prominence of the Maui cycle; and if we compare these Polynesian tales with the Melanesian stories of the wise and foolish brothers, there is a suggestion of some sort of relationship between them. To be sure, the similarity lies mainly in the fact that in both regions there is a group of brothers, one of whom is capable, the others incapable or foolish, whereas the actual exploits of the two areas are different. Again, it is only in New Zealand that even this slight amount of correspondence is noticeable. In spite, however, of this very slender basis for comparison, it seems, in view of the relative absence of this type of tale from the rest of the Pacific area, that the suggestion of connexion between the two groups of myths is worth further investigation. This is especially evident in view of the second of the two points to which reference has been made, i.e. the similarity between Tagaro, the name of the Melanesian brothers in the New Hebrides, and the Polynesian deity Tangaroa, who appears in several guises, i. e. as a simple god of the sea in New Zealand, as the creator in the Society and Samoan Groups, and as an evil deity in Hawaii. It is not yet possible to determine the exact relationship between the Polynesian Tangaroa and the New Hebridian Takaro, but it is probable that there is some connexion between them. It may be that the use of the name in the New Hebrides is due wholly to borrowing during the comparatively recent Polynesian contact; but on the other hand, it is possible that Tangaroa is a Polynesian modification of the Melanesian Tagaro. The general uniformity of the conceptions of Tagaro in Melanesia, contrasted with the varied character of Tangaroa in Polynesia, adds considerable difficulty to the problem. The final elucidation of the puzzle must wait, however, for the materials at present available are not sufficiently complete to enable us to draw any certain conclusions. Miscellaneous tales =Cannibals= A very common class of tales in Melanesia deals with cannibals and monsters, and our discussion of the general or more miscellaneous group of myths may well begin with examples of this type. As told by the Sulka, a Papuan tribe of New Britain, one of these stories runs as follows. Once there was a cannibal and his wife who had killed and eaten a great many persons, so that, fearing lest they should all be destroyed, the people resolved to abandon their village and seek safety in flight. Accordingly, they prepared their canoes, loaded all their property on board, and made ready to leave; but Tamus, one of the women of the village, was with child, whence the others refused to take her with them, saying that she would only be a burden upon the journey. She swam after them, however, and clung to the stem of one of the canoes, but they beat her off, compelling her to return to the deserted village and to live there alone. In due time she bore a son, and when he grew up a little, she would leave him in her hut while she went out to get food, warning him not to talk or laugh, lest the cannibals should hear and come and eat him. One day his mother left him a dracaena-plant as a plaything, and when she was gone he said to himself, \\"What shall I make out of this, my brother or my cousin?\\" Then he held the dracaena behind him, and presently it turned into a boy, with whom he played and talked. Resolving to conceal the presence of his new friend. Pupal, from his mother, he said to her on her return, \\"Mother, I want to make a partition in our house; then you can live on one side, and I will live on the other\\" and this he did, concealing Pupal in his portion of the house. From time to time his mother thought that she heard her son talking to someone and was surprised at the quantity of food and drink he required; but though she often asked him if he was alone, he always declared that he was. At last one day she discovered Pupal and then learned how he had come from the dracaena. She was glad that her son now had a companion, and all three lived happily together. Tamus was, however, more than ever afraid that the cannibals would hear sounds, and suspecting the presence of people in the deserted village, would come to eat them; but the two boys reassured her, saying, \\"Have no fear; we shall kill them, if they dare to come.\\" Accordingly, making themselves shields and spears, they practised marksmanship and also erected a slippery barricade about the house, so that it would be difficult to climb. When they had completed their preparations, they set up a swing near the house, and while they were swinging, called out to the cannibals, \\"Where are you? We are here, come and eat us.\\" The cannibals heard, and one said to the other, \\"Don't you hear someone calling us over there? Who can it be, for we have eaten all of them.\\" So they set out for the village to see what could have made the noise, the two boys being meanwhile ready in hiding. When the cannibals tried to climb the barricade, they slipped and fell, and the boys rushing out succeeded in killing them both after a hard fight. The children then called to the boy's mother, who had been greatly terrified, and when she came and saw both the cannibals dead, she built a fire, and they cut up the bodies and burned them, saving only the breasts of the ogress. These Tamus put in a coco-nut-shell, and setting it afloat on the sea, said: \\"Go to the people who ran away from here, and if they ask, 'Have the cannibals killed Tamus, and are these her breasts?' remain floating; but if they say, 'Has Tamus borne a son and has he killed the cannibals, and are these the breasts of the ogress?' then sink!\\". The coco-nut-shell floated away at once and by and by came to the new village built by the people who had fled years before. All occurred as Tamus had foreseen, and through the aid of the coco-nut-shell and its contents the people learned the truth. When they discovered the death of the cannibals, they were overjoyed and set out at once for their old home; but just as they were about to land, Pupal and Tamus's son attacked them, and the latter said, \\"Ye abandoned my mother and cast her away. Now, ye shall not come back.\\" After a while, however, he relented and allowed the people to land, and all lived together again happily and safely in their old home. Another cannibal story which introduces interesting features is told in the New Hebrides. There was once a cannibal named Taso, who came one day upon the sister of Qatu and killed her, but did not eat her because she was with child. So he abandoned her body in a thicket, and there, though their mother was dead, twin boys were bom. They found rain-water collected in dead leaves, and shoots of plants that they could eat; so they lived, and when they grew old enough to walk, they wandered about in the forest until one day they found a sow belonging to their uncle Qatu. He came daily to give it food, but when he had gone, the boys would eat part of the sow's provisions. Thus they grew, and their skins and hair were fair. Qatu wondered why his sow did not become fat, and watching, discovered the tmns and caught them; but when they told him who they were, he welcomed them as his nephews and took them home with him. After they grew bigger, he made little bows of sago fronds for them, and when they could shoot lizards, he broke the bows, giving them larger ones with which they brought down greater game; and thus he trained them until they were grown up and could shoot anything. When they were young men, Qatu told them about Taso and how he had murdered their mother, warning them to be careful, lest he should catch them. The twins, however, determined to kill the cannibal, so they set a tabu on a banana-tree belonging to them and said to their uncle: \\"If our bunch of bananas begins to ripen at the top and ripens downwards, you will know that Taso has killed us; but if it begins to ripen at the bottom and ripens upwards, we shall have killed him.\\" So they set off to kill Taso, but when they came to his house, he had gone to the beach to sharpen his teeth, and only his mother was at home. Accordingly, they went and sat in the gamal the men's house, to wait for him, and lighting a fire in the oven, they roasted some yams and heated stones in the blaze. Thereupon Taso's mother sang a song, telling him that there were two men in the gamal and that they should be food for him and for her; so the cannibal quickly returned from the shore, and as he came, he moved his head from side to side, striking the trees so that they went crashing down. When he reached the gamal he climbed over the door-rail, but the boys immediately threw at him all the hot rocks from the oven and knocked him down, and then with their clubs they beat him until he was dead, after which they killed his mother, and setting fire to the house over them, went away. Now Qatu, hearing the popping of the bamboos as the house burned, said, \\"Alas, Taso has probably burned the boys!\\" Hastening to see what had happened, however, he met them on the way and heard from them that they had killed Taso and had revenged their mother whom he had slain. Although greatly feared, and capable of destroying people in numbers, the cannibals are usually pictured as stupid and easily deceived, as shown in the following two tales. In a village lived four brothers, the eldest of whom one day took his bow and went out to shoot fish. Those which were only wounded he buried in the sand, and so went on until his arrow hit and stuck in the trunk of a bread-fruit- tree; whereupon, looking up and seeing ripe fruit, he climbed the tree and threw several of them down. An old cannibal heard the sound as they dropped and said, \\"Who is that stealing my fruit?\\" The man in the tree replied, \\"It is I with my brothers,\\" and the old ogre answered, \\"Well, let us see if what you say is true. Just call to them.\\" Accordingly, the man shouted, \\"My brothers!\\" and all the fish that he had buried in the sand, replied, so that it sounded as if many men were near; whereupon the cannibal was frightened and said, \\"It is true, but hurry up, take what you will, only leave me the small ones.\\" So the man took the bread-fruit, gathered up the fish which he had buried, and went home; but when his brothers begged him to share his food with them, or at least to give them the skins of the fish, he refused, telling them to go and get some for themselves. The next day the second brother went off, followed his brother's tracks, imitated his procedure, and came back with fish and fruit; the third brother did the same on the following day; and then it came the turn of the fourth to go. He, however, failed to bury the wounded fish, but killed them, and when the cannibal asked him to call his brothers, there was no reply. \\"Aha,\\" said the cannibal, \\"now I have got you. You must come down from the tree.\\" \\"Oh, yes!\\" said the youngest brother, \\"I shall come down on that tree there.\\" Quickly the ogre took his axe and cut down the tree, and in this way he felled every one that stood near. \\"Now, I surely have you,\\" said he, but the youngest brother replied, \\"No, I will come down on your youngest daughter there.\\" So the cannibal rushed at her and gave her a fatal blow; and thus the man in the tree induced the stupid monster to kill all his children and his wife and lastly to cut off his own hand, whereupon the man came down from the tree and slew the ogre. The following story presents striking features of agreement with certain Indonesian tales. A man and his family had dried and prepared a great quantity of food, which they stored on a staging in their home; and one day, when the man had gone off to his field to work, a cannibal came to the house, and seeing all the provisions, resolved to get them. So he said to the man's wife, who had been left alone with the children, \\"My cousin told me to tell you to give me a package of food.\\" The woman gave him one, and he hid it in the forest, after which he returned and repeated his request, thus carrying away all the food which the people had stored. Finally he seized the woman and her children, shut them up in a cave, and went away, so that when the husband returned, he found his house empty. Searching about, he at last heard his wife calling to him from the cave where she had been imprisoned, and she told him how the cannibal, after stealing their food, had taken her and the children. Hard though her husband tried, he could not open the cave, but was forced to sit there helpless while his wife and family starved to death, after which he returned to his town and plaited the widower's wristlets and arm-bands for himself. One day the old cannibal came by, and seeing him sitting there, he admired the plaited ornaments which the man wore, but did not know what they were. He asked the man to make him some like them, and the widower agreed, saying, \\"You must first go to sleep, then I can make them properly.\\" So they went to seek a suitable place, and the man, after secretly telling the birds to dam up the river, that the bed might be dry, led the cannibal to a great tree-root in the channel of the stream and told him that this would be a good place. Believing him, the cannibal lay down on the root and slept, whereupon the man took strong rattans and vines and tied the monster fast, after which he called out to the birds to break the dam and let the flood come down the river. He himself ran to the bank in safety, and when the cannibal, awakened by the water which rose higher and higher, cried out, \\"What is this cold thing which touches me?\\" the man replied: \\"You evil cave-monster, surely it was for you that we prepared all the food, and you came and ate it up. You also killed my wife and children, and now you want me to plait an arm-band for you.\\" Then he tore off his own arm-bands and signs of mourning and threw them away, while the water rose above the head of the cannibal and drowned him. =Women= The theme of the woman abandoned by the people of the village, one form of which has already been given, is very common in Melanesia, and another version presents several interesting features for comparison. A woman named Garawada one day went with her mother-in-law into the jungle to gather figs. Coming to a fig-tree, Garawada climbed up and began to eat the ripe fruit, while she threw down the green ones to her mother-in-law. The latter, angered at this, called to Garawada to come down, but when she reached the fork in the tree, the old woman, who was a witch, caused the forks to come together, thus imprisoning her daughter-in-law, after which she went away and left her. For many days the woman remained in the tree, and finally bore a son; but after a while the child fell to the ground, and though his mother feared that he would die, he found wild fruits and water, and lived. One day he looked up into the tree and discovered his mother, and from that time he gave her fruits and berries in order that she might not starve. Nevertheless, he longed for other companions, and one day he said to his parent, \\"Mother, teach me my party that I may sing it when I find my people, and that thus they may know me.\\" So she taught him his spell: \\"I have sucked the shoots of dabedabe; My mother is Garawada.\\" The child then ran off to seek his way out of the jungle. Once he forgot his song, but after hastening back to relearn it, he hurried away again and came to the edge of the forest, where he saw some children throwing darts at a coco-nut which was rolled upon the ground. He yearned to play with them, and making for himself a dart, he ran toward them, singing his charm and casting his missile. Not being used to aim at a mark, however, he missed the coco-nut and struck one of the children in the arm, whereat, thinking an enemy had attacked them, the children all ran shrieking to their homes. The next day he came again, and this time the children fled at once, but though he followed, he was unable to catch them, and so returned a second time to his mother. The children now reported their adventure to their parents, and the father of one of them determined to go with them the following day and hide that he might watch what happened. Accordingly, when the little jungle-boy came the third time, the man ran out and caught him and asked him who he was; whereupon the boy told him the story of his mother's bravery, and how he himself had grown up alone in the jungle, and then sang his song: \\"I have sucked the shoots of dabedabe; My mother is Garawada\\" At this the man said, \\"Truly thou art my nephew. Come, let us go and set thy mother free.\\" So they went with many of the villagers and cut down the tree, for they could not separate the branches; but as the tree fell, Garawada slipped away and ran swiftly to the beach, and there, turning into a crab, crawled into a hole in the sand. Her son wept, because he knew that his mother had left him, but his uncle led him back to the village and took him into his own home, and the children no longer were afraid to have him for a playfellow. The theme of the swan-maiden, which perhaps occurs in parts of Polynesia and widely in Indonesia, seems quite well developed in the New Hebrides. According to the version told in Lepers Island, a party of heavenly, winged maidens once flew down to earth to bathe, and Tagaro watched them. He saw them take off their wings, stole one pair, and hid them at the foot of the main pillar of his house. He then returned and found all fled but the wingless one, and he took her to his house and presented her to his mother as his wife. After a time Tagaro took her to weed his garden, when the yams were not yet ripe, and as she weeded and touched the yam vines, ripe tubers came into her hand. Tagaro's brothers thought she was digging yams before their time and scolded her; she went into the house and sat weeping at the foot of the pillar, and as she wept her tears fell, and wearing away the earth pattered down upon her wings. She heard the sound, took up her wings, and flew back to heaven. Another version adds that the returning sky-maiden took her child with her; and when Tagaro came back to find his wife and son absent, he asked his mother regarding them, her reply being that they had gone to the house and wept because they had been scolded about the yams. Tagaro hurried to the dwelling, but seeing that the wings were gone, he knew that his wife and child had returned to the sky-land. Thereupon he called a bird and said, \\"Fly up and seek for them in their country, for you have wings and I have not.\\" So the bird flew up and up and up, and perched upon a tree in the sky-country. Under the tree Tagaro's wife sat with her child, making mats, and the bird, scratching upon a fruit pictures of Tagaro, the child, and its mother, dropped it at their feet. The boy seized it, and recognizing the pictures, they looked up and saw the bird, from whom they learned that Tagaro was seeking them. The sky-woman bade the bird tell Tagaro that he must ascend to the sky-land, for only if he should come up to her would she agree to descend to earth again. The bird carried the message, but Tagaro was in despair, for how, without wings, could he possibly reach the sky? At last he had an idea. Quickly making a powerful bow and a hundred arrows, he shot one of them at the sky. The arrow stuck firmly, and he then shot another into the butt of the first, and a third into the butt of the second, and thus, one after another, he sent his arrows, making an arrow-chain, until, when he had sped the last one, the end of the chain reached the earth. Then from the sky a banian-root crept down the arrow- chain and took root in the earth. Tagaro breathed upon it, and it grew larger and stronger, whereupon, taking all his ornaments, he and the bird climbed the banian-root to the sky. There he found his lost wife and child, and said to them, \\"Let us now descend.\\" Accordingly, his wife gathered up her mats and followed him, but when Tagaro said to her, \\"Do you go first,\\" she replied, \\"No, do you go first.\\" So Tagaro started, and they followed; but when they were halfway down, his wife took out a hatchet which she had concealed and cut the banian-root just beneath her, so that Tagaro and the bird fell to earth, while she and her child climbed back again to the sky. In its distribution the story of the Isle of Women presents a number of elements of interest. According to the version from New Britain, a man one day set some snares in a tree to catch pigeons. One of the birds was caught, but succeeded in tearing the snare loose and flew away over the sea. The man, thinking to secure it, followed it in his canoe, and after having paddled all day and all night, in the morning he saw an island and the bird perched upon a tree. Carefully concealing his canoe, he started after the bird, but hearing people coming, he hurriedly climbed into a tree and hid himself. The tree stood directly over a spring, and soon many women appeared, coming to get water. One of them preceded the others, and as she stooped to dip up water, she saw the reflection of the man in the surface of the pool; whereupon she called out to her companions, \\"I will fill your water-vessels for you,\\" for she did not wish the others to know that there was a man in the tree. When all the vessels had been filled and the women had started to return home, she secretly left her sun-shield behind; and after they had gone a little way, she said, \\"Oh, I left my sun-shield! Do you all go on, I will catch up.\\" So she went back to the spring, and calling to the man to come down, she asked him to marry her, and he agreed. She took him to her house and secreted him there, and thus she alone of all the women had a man for her husband; for all the rest had only tortoises. In due time she had a child, at which the other women were envious and asked her how her human child had been born but she refused to disclose her secret, although by and by she confided to her sister that she had found a man and agreed to let her also become his wife. When later her sister bore a child, the other women were again curious, and at last discovering the secret, each and every one of them wished to have the man for her husband, and they paid the sisters to let them all marry the man and become his wives; so that the man had very many spouses. After the man's first child had grown, he determined to leave the island; and accordingly, uncovering his canoe, which he had concealed, he paddled away to his own home, where he saw the signs that were put up in the house of the dead, for all thought him drowned. It was evening when he reached his village, and as he rapped on the drum to let his wife know that he had returned, she called out, \\"Who is there?\\" to which he answered, \\"It is I.\\" She lit a torch and came out of the house and looked at him; but was angry, and saying, \\"You are the one who caused us to spend all our bead-money in vain on your funeral ceremonies, while you have been living shamelessly with other wives, she seized an axe and struck him so that he died. Of tales in which inanimate objects become persons or act as such, and which arc apparently characteristic of the Melanesian area, we may take an example from German New Guinea. One night, while two women were sleeping in a house, a tapa-beater transformed itself into a woman resembling one of the pair, and waking the other, said to her, \\"Come, it is time for us to go fishing.\\" So the woman arose, and they took torches and went out to sea in a canoe. After a while she saw an island of drift-wood, and as the dawn came on, perceived that her companion had turned into a tapa-beater, whereupon she said: \\"Oh, the tapa-beater has deceived me. While we were talking in the evening, it was standing in the corner and heard us, and in the night it came and deceived me.\\" Landing her on the island, the tapa-beater paddled away and abandoned her; but she sought for food, and found a sea-eagle's egg which she held in her hand until it broke and hatched out a young bird, for which she cared until it grew large. Then the bird would fly off and get fish for her to eat, and also brought her a fire-brand, so that she could cook her food. Her great desire, however, was to return to her home; but when the bird said that he would carry her to the shore, she doubted whether he was strong enough. Then the bird seized a great log of wood and showed her that he could lift that, so she finally trusted him and thus was borne safely back to her own island. Her parents were delighted to see her, and she petted and fed the bird who had taken care of her so well; but since the sea-eagle could not be content, it flew away. Then the woman told her parents how the tapa-beater had deceived and kidnapped her; and her father was angry, and building a great fire, he threw the tapa-beater into it and burned it up. =Ghosts= Equally typical of Melanesia are the many tales of ghosts; and an example from the Kai, a Papuan tribe of German New Guinea, runs as follows. One day a number of brothers who were gathering material for making arm-bands had climbed into a great tree, when the youngest made a mis-step, and falling to the ground, was killed. The other brothers, who could not see what had happened because of the thick foliage, called out, \\"What was that which fell?\\" The ghost of the dead brother, however, still stood in the tree and said, \\"I stepped on a dead branch which broke,\\" and thus lying to his brothers, he descended from the tree before them, wrapped his body in leaves, and hid it. When his brothers came down, the ghost went along with them, but on the way he suddenly said, \\"Oh! I forgot and left something at that tree. Wait for me till I get it.\\" Accordingly, they waited while the ghost went back, picked up his body, and brought it along, but hid it again before he came to the place where his brothers were. Then they all went on toward the village; but after a while he repeated the trick several times until his brothers, becoming suspicious, watched and found out how they had been deceived. Thereupon they all fled, and coming to the village, cried out, \\"We have seen something mysterious. Shut your doors.\\" So all the people obeyed, all but an old woman and her grandson, for she had not heard the warning and left her door open. By and by the ghost came, carrying his body on his back. He tried to throw his corpse into the first house, but it struck against the closed door and fell down again; so he picked it up and cast it at the next with like result. Thus he tried them all until he came to the last house, in which the old woman lived; and here, because the door was open, the ghost succeeded and threw his body into the house. Quickly the old woman seized the bundle and tossed it out again, but the ghost caught it and hurled it back. Thus they continued to send the body to and fro; but at last the old woman seized her grandson by mistake and threw him out, at which the ghost cried, \\"That is great! Now you have given me something to eat.\\" The old woman then said, \\"Throw him back again,\\" but the ghost replied, thinking to cheat her, \\"Do you first throw out my body. Then I will throw him back.\\" So they argued until dawn was near, when the old woman shouted, \\"The dawn is coming. Does that mean something for you or for me?\\" Since the ghost replied, \\"For me!\\" the woman delayed until the day had come. The light of the sun put the ghost in danger, so he threw the grandson back and received his own body in return; but being no longer able to conceal himself, he was changed into a wild taro-plant, while his body became a piece of bark. =Animals= In many parts of Melanesia a type of tale is found which seems to be rare in Polynesia and Indonesia, but is, on the other hand, common in Australia, i.e. the stories told to account for peculiar markings or characteristics of different animals, plants, or inanimate things. In the Banks Islands it is said that a rat and a rail, once finding a gariga-tree full of ripe fruit, disputed which should climb the tree. At last the rat went up, but instead of throwing ripe fruit down to the rail, he ate them himself and tossed down only stones. Finding that the rat refused to give him any fully ripe fruit, the bird said, \\"Throw me down that one. It is only red ripe,\\" whereupon the rat took the fruit and tossed it at the rail, so that it hit him on his forehead and stuck fast. The rail was angry, and as the rat came down from the tree, he thrust the unfolded leaf of a dracaena into the rat's rump, where it stuck fast. So the tail of the rat is the leaf of the dracaena that the rail put there, and the red lump on the head of the rail is the gariga-fruit which the rat threw at him. In Lepers Island in the New Hebrides the origin of good and bad yams is given as follows. One day a hen and her ten chickens came across a wild yam, which got up after a while and ate one of the chickens. The survivors called to a kite, which said to the hen, \\"Put the chickens under me,\\" and when the yam came and asked the kite where the chickens were, the bird replied, \\"I don't know.\\" Thereupon the yam scolded the kite, and the latter, seizing the yam, flew high into the air and dropped it to the ground. Then another kite took it up and let it fall, so that the yam was broken into two parts; and thus the two kites divided the yam between them, whence some yams are good and some are bad. The story of how the turtle got his shell is told as follows in British New Guinea. The turtle and the wallaby, being hungry one day, went together to the hombill's garden and began to eat his bananas and sugar-cane. While they were thus engaged, the birds were preparing a feast, and Binama, the hornbill, asked one of them to go to the shore for some salt water with which to flavour the food. Several made excuses, for they feared that an enemy might kill them, but at last the wagtail agreed to go, and on the way passed through Binama's garden, where he saw the wallaby and the turtle feasting. The turtle was much frightened at being discovered and said, \\"Your master bade us eat his bananas, for we were hungry.\\" The wagtail knew that this was not true, but said nothing, got the sea-water, and returning to the village by another path, cried out, \\"Friends, the turtle and the wallaby are eating in our master's garden.\\" Then all the people were angry, and getting their spears, they ran and surrounded the garden. The wallaby, seeing his danger, made a tremendous leap and escaped, but the turtle, having no means of flight, was caught and carried prisoner to Binama's house, where he was tied to a pole and laid upon a shelf until the morrow, when Binama and the others went to get food to make a feast, at which they intended to kill the turtle. Only Binama's children were left in the house, and the turtle, speaking softly to them, said, \\"Loosen my bonds, O children, that we may play together.\\" This the children did and then, at the turtle's request, got the best of their father's ornaments, which the turtle donned and wore as he crawled about. This amused the children and they laughed loudly, for the turtle had put a great bead necklace about his neck and shell armlets on his arms and a huge wooden bowl on his back. By and by the people could be heard returning; and as soon as the turtle became aware of this, he ran swiftly to the sea, while the children cried out, \\"Come quickly, for the turtle is running away!\\" So all the people chased the turtle, but he succeeded in reaching the sea and dived out of sight. When the people arrived at the shore, they called out, \\"Show yourself! Lift up your head!\\" Accordingly, the turtle rose and stuck his head above water, whereupon the birds hurled great stones at him and broke one of the armlets; they threw again and destroyed the other; again, and hit the necklace, so that the string gave way, and the beads were lost. Then for a last time calling to the turtle to show himself, they threw very large stones which fell upon the wooden bowl on his back, but they did not break it, and the turtle was not harmed. Then he fled far away over the sea, and to this day all turtles carry on their backs the bowl that once was in the house of Binama. From New Britain comes the following tale of the dog and the kangaroo. One day when the kangaroo was going along, followed by the dog, he ate a yellow lapua-fruit and was asked by the dog, when the latter came up with him, \\"Tell me, what have you eaten that your mouth is so yellow?\\" The kangaroo replied, \\"There is some of it on yonder log,\\" pointing to a pile of filth; whereupon the dog, thinking that it was good, ran quickly and ate it up, only to hear his companion laugh and say, \\"Listen, friend, what I ate was a yellow laptua- fruit like that; what you have eaten is simply filth.\\" Angered at the trick played upon him, the dog resolved to have his revenge, and so, as they went on toward the shore, he ran ahead and buried his forepaws in the sand. When the kangaroo came up, the dog said: \\"Gracious, but you have long forepaws! Break off a piece of your long paws. I have broken off a piece of mine as you see, and now mine are beautiful and short. Do you do likewise, and then we shall both be alike.\\" So the kangaroo broke off a piece of each of his forepaws and threw the pieces away, whereupon the dog jumped up and said, triumphantly, \\"Aha! I still have long forepaws, but you have only short ones. You are the one who deceived me and made me eat the filth,\\" and as he uttered these words, he sprang at the kangaroo and killed him, and ever since the kangaroo has had short forepaws. In several cases the parallelism between the Melanesian and Australian tales of this type is very striking; its significance will be apparent later.

The peninsula ends at Dennis Head, the site of an early Celtic fortress.Genuki website Later it served as a Royalist stronghold during the English Civil War, and provided a lookout point for the Home Guard during the Second World War. The parish is divided by the tidal Gillan Creek. The hamlet and parish church are on the north side of the creek. On the south side are the hamlets of Carne, Flushing (not to be confused with the larger village of Flushing north of Falmouth) and Gillan, and further inland the small ancient settlements of Boden and Trewarnevas. The South West Coast Path runs along both shores of Gillan Creek and crosses it on stepping stones only passable at low tide. The path then rounds Dennis Head and leaves the parish on the south shore of the Helford River. St Anthony-in-Meneage lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). Parish church The parish church is dedicated to St Anthony and is situated near the shore. It is medieval though parts are of different dates, a window in the chancel (Early English) is the earliest and the north aisle with an arcade of plain octagonal piers somewhat later. The tower was built in the 15th century of granite blocks at the west end. The font is ornamented with angels and a Latin inscription and is probably of the 15th century.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall; 2nd ed., revised by Enid Radcliffe. Penguin Books; pp. 155-56 N.B. Pevsner gives the dedication as St Dunstan Bosahan The thatched lodge by the entrance to Bosahan Bosahan House was a 19th-century country estate with a large house, which was demolished in 1884 and rebuilt on a grander scale. The Member of Parliament for West Cornwall, Arthur Pendarves Vivian MP bought the estate at an auction (reserve price ¬£24,000) in 1882, when the estate was described as having a ‚Ä≥fine residential mansion‚Ä≥. Also included in the sale were the three farms of Halvose, Passage and Treath (about ) as well as some fishing and ferry rights on the River Hal. At the time of the auction the estate covered in the parishes of St Anthony, Manaccan and Constantine, and was originally developed by the Grylls family. The 1884 house was demolished in the 1950s and replaced by a smaller house.Matthew Beckett Bosahan ; England's Lost Country HousesOrdnance Survey One-inch Map of Great Britain; Truro and Falmouth, sheet 190. 1961Bosahan Lodge, Gate Piers, Gates and Flanking Walls; British Listed Buildings In 1909, The Gardeners' magazine described the garden which had been developed over the previous 25 years, as ‚Ä≥the most Cornish of all Cornish gardens‚Ä≥.

One is located at an elevated station house beneath the tracks, which has two staircases from either southern corners of Flushing Avenue and Broadway, token booth, turnstile bank, a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions, and a single staircase to each platform at their extreme north end. Each staircase landing has an exit-only turnstile to allow passengers to exit the station without having to go through the station house. Three elevators were installed in Fall 2003 to make this station ADA accessible due to its proximity to Woodhull Hospital. One of them is at the southwest corner of Broadway and Flushing Avenue and goes up to the adjacent staircase balcony. The other two go up to the platforms from the staircase landing. The other set of entrance/exit are stairs located at the south ends of each platform. These stairs lead to Fayette Street. There was formerly another station house at this end, but it was removed. These stairs were closed in the 1980s due to high crime, but were reopened in July 2017 to address potential capacity constraints from shuttle bus transfers due to reconstruction on the Myrtle Avenue Line and the 14th Street Tunnel.

Church history The historic parish church of St Gluvias, dedicated to Gluvias of Cornwall (or Gluviacus) serves the Church of England parish of St Gluvias with Penryn. Gluvias of Cornwall was the son of Gwynllyw the warrior, King of Gwentlog, and a nephew of St Petroc.

Hammer (born April 26, 1939) was the first female president of the National Rifle Association (NRA) from 1995 to 1998. As an influential NRA lobbyist from the 1970s through today, Hammer is credited with influencing many of Florida's gun laws including the 2005 Stand your ground law.Spies, Mike, The N.R.A. Lobbyist Behind Florida‚Äôs Pro-Gun Policies, The New Yorker, March 5, 2018 The success of her pro-gun lobby has had an impact upon similar laws across the United States. She developed the NRA program for children, Eddie Eagle GunSafe, in 1988 that the NRA promotes as an alternative to Child access prevention law (CAP) or safe storage laws. In 2005, she was inducted into Florida Women's Hall of Fame. Hammer is currently very active in lobbying the NRA positions and helping to write pro-gun legislation with the Florida State Legislature, including participation in senate and house committee meetings following the mass shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on 14 February 2018. Following the mass shooting, Hammer became the target of harassment and filed law suits against five men. Early life Hammer grew up on a farm owned by her grandparents near Columbia, South Carolina. They were relatively poor and engaged in subsistence hunting. She learned to shoot \\"squirrels and rabbits for dinner\\" with a .22 bolt-action single-shot rifle. She would go hunting after school. Her father served in World War II and died in Okinawa. She says that he was killed \\"defending freedoms like the right to bear arms.\\" She married a man who also loved hunting and they entered shooting competitions together as part of \\"family recreational activities\\" which later included their children. The major catalyst that led her to become a pro-gun activist was the Gun Control Act of 1968, which was passed in response to the assassinations of John F. Kennedy in 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. in April 1968, and Bobby Kennedy in June 1968. She said \\"our government, that is supposed to protect us and our rights, decided to engage in some political eyewash.\\" In the mid-1980s, in a parking deck, Hammer claims she was followed by a car with five male passengers and a male driver who appeared to be either drunk or on drugs. Instead of running, she claims she stood firmly in front of the vehicle with her six-shot .38-caliber revolver, that she always carried in her purse, aimed at the car. She claims they quickly reversed and left. National Rifle Association (NRA) Tallahassee, Florida-based Hammer served as NRA president, an NRA board member, and an NRA lobbyist for the state of Florida. She has been the executive director of the Unified Sportsmen of Florida, (USF) the NRA affiliate in Florida, since 1976. She is a certified firearms instructor. =NRA President= Hammer had been an NRA member all her adult life, and had served as second and first vice president. On December 5, 1995, Thomas Washington, who was president of the NRA for 18 months during a period that was sometimes \\"embattled\\", died as a result a heart attack suffered while deer hunting. During his tenure, President George H. W. Bush, a pro-gun candidate and NRA life member, who had the NRA endorsement, resigned from the NRA after receiving an April 13, 1995 fundraising letter by NRA vice president Wayne LaPierre calling the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ARTs) \\"jack- booted government thugs\\". Following Washington's death, Hammer, \\"who was in line to succeed him, took over\\", becoming the \\"first female president in the 125-year history of the National Rifle Association.\\" In a 1996 profile in the New York Times, she was described as being as \\"tough as a day-old biscuit\\" with a \\"startlingly deep\\" voice. She says, \\"It truly is not guns that kill people, individuals do.\\" In 1996, with Hammer as president, NRA membership was at a record high with Republicans in power both in congress and in many state legislatures. New members included women, minorities, \\"hunters, target shooters and people who want to learn how to use guns to protect themselves from violent crime.\\" She served as president from 1995 to 1998. =Unified Sportsmen of Florida (USF)= Hammer became head of the pro-gun Unified Sportsmen of Florida (USF), the NRA's affiliate in Florida, in the 1970s, following her move to Florida. =NRA lobbyist= In an article in Newsweek, Hammer, who was described as a \\"78-year-old lobbyist\\" who is \\"under five feet tall\\", carries a \\"handgun in her purse\\" and is the \\"most powerful [lobbyist] in her industry when it comes to pro-gun legislation\\". She has been active as a lobbyist in the state of Florida from the late 1970s and continues her position today. Hammer has been credited with being the force behind most gun laws in Florida for more than three decades, which included about 30 laws since 1998 alone. Republicans were in control of the Florida legislature during that time. She \\"lobbied for and eventually pushed through\\" a 1987 Florida law that allows Floridians who \\"have no criminal records or mental illness\\" to carry concealed weapons with concealed-carry (CCW) permits. In 2002, Hammer, on behalf of the NRA, \\"had lawmakers quietly move\\" the division handling the concealed weapons permit program to Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Until 2002, the Division of Licensing was under the Florida Department of State in Tallahassee. In all other American states, either the police or courts handles CCW permits. According to the Tampa Bay Times, on June 8, 2018, Hammer said, \\"What we did is we helped write the bill and then amended it onto somebody else's bill...It was just me. Just NRA. Just gun owners wanting to be sure the program was protected.\\" From February 2016 through March 2017, the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services failed to use the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) on over 300,000 CCW permit applications, which meant that those with a mental illness or drug addiction, could get a CCW permit. By June 2018 Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam said that his office had revoked 291 permits erroneously granted to people who did not pass background checks. In 2018, the Tampa Bay Times revealed that between 2014 and 2018, with Putman as Agriculture Commissioner, 298 emails were exchanged between Hammer and employees of the Department of Agriculture. With Putman as Commissioner, Florida became the first and only state in the United States to grant over two million CCW permits. Nikki Fried, who replaced Putman in 2018 supports placing the CCW permit program under the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's authority and has criticized Hammer for her NRA lobbying regarding CCW permits. Hammer is lobbying to have the program placed under Republican Jimmy Patronis, the state Chief Financial Officer. Hammer said, \\"No program that facilitates a constitutional right should be under a politically appointed agency head, it must be under an elected official answerable to the people. I assure you 1.8 million (concealed weapons) license holders would not be happy if the program were disrupted.\\" According to the Orlando Weekly, Fried said that \\"Politics should have no role in our concealed weapons permit process ‚Äî the current system has allowed groups like the NRA to control our state government for long enough.\\" The hundreds of emails from Hammer to the Department of Agriculture, made available online by the Tampa Bay Times, include complaints about denied CCW license renewals, spam phone calls and email, South Korean dogs, and a specific pest control company that she claimed damaged a house she owned. They reveal that Hammer's \\"sphere of influence\\" was much wider than just gun legislation. Hammer was \\"one of the chief architects\\" of the Stand-your-ground law that was signed into law by Governor Jeb Bush in 2005. It was the first to be passed in the United States. It was based on the Castle Doctrine. The controversy surrounding the trial George Zimmerman, who fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, \\"focused attention once again on Florida's gun laws, and on Hammer's role in getting them passed.\\" Hammer worked with Jeb Bush's chief of staff, Sally Bradshaw, on the stand-your- ground legislation. Bradshaw said, \\"There is no more tenacious presence in Tallahassee than Marion Hammer. A lot of lobbyists come and go, but Marion is part of a cause, and that means she has real credibility and a stick-with-it- ness that few can match. You want her on your side in a fight.\\" Hammer told lawmakers that\\"You can't expect a victim to wait before taking action to protect herself, and say: 'Excuse me, Mr. Criminal, did you drag me into this alley to rape and kill me or do you just want to beat me up and steal my purse?'\\" She criticized opponents of the legislation as \\"bleeding-heart criminal coddlers.\\" Dennis Baxley (R-Fl), a funeral director, who worked with Hammer on the law and was its sponsor, said that Hammer's words resonated with the constituents of the county he represented, Marion County, Florida. Baxter described her as a \\"determined\\" and a \\"tremendous inspiration.\\" He said, \\"She doesn't want to see anybody victimized. She is absolutely vibrant in protecting the Second Amendment.\\" The law passed with almost no opposition. \\"Opposing it seemed like political suicide in Florida.\\" During the first six months after taking office in January 2011 as Governor of Florida, Rick Scott, who has an A+ NRA rating, signed three important pro-gun bills into law, Senate Bill 234, House Bill 155, and House Bill 45, by the end of the May 7th, 2011, when the Florida legislature adjourned. The first made the Right-to- Carry or Concealed Weapons Licensing law, more pro-gun. House Bill 155 would allow gun-owners to carry guns into doctor's offices and examining rooms. The third, House Bill 45, which was co-sponsored by state Representative Matt Gaetz (R-4) and which Hammer, \\"worked to enact\\", \\"punishes local officials who attempt to establish gun regulations stricter than those imposed at the state level. Officials can be fined thousands of dollars and removed from office.\\" N.R.A. papers show that it was \\"deeply involved in advocating\\" for House Bill 45. Hammer \\"oversaw its development\\" which included monitoring even \\"minor adjustments to the bill's language.\\" In an exchange of emails about \\"three draft amendments\\" including one about \\"where fines should be deposited\\", an analyst corresponded with Hammer, \\"Marion, I've spoken with you about the first one\\"; an analyst \\"said she'd spoken with you about the others. Let me know what you think.\\" Hammer's influence was felt across the United States as Florida pro-gun laws, according to Bloomberg News, became the model for similar laws passed in a majority of U.S. states. Hammer's efficacy as lobbyist in Florida for her Second Amendment agenda, has led to Florida being dubbed the \\"Gunshine State\\" ‚Äî not just the \\"Sunshine State\\". In a February 2, 2017 opinion piece, Hammer wrote that, in \\"the 1970s and 1980s, one of the more blatant areas of abuse by local governments was the unconstitutional regulation of Second Amendment rights. With no justification whatever, and based solely on the personal views of elected local officials, all manner of unconstitutional ordinances existed in many jurisdictions... With the growing arrogance and misconduct by local governments, more preemption laws are inevitable and necessary.\\" Since the 1987 law that gave the state of Florida \\"exclusive right to regulate firearms\\", local governments imposed their own additional regulations. Hammer described these \\"local gun haters\\" as flouting the 1987 law. She said that these laws that differed from locality to locality, meant that \\"law-abiding people\\" who were bearing arms \\"had no way of knowing what these local regulations were. On June 2011 Governor Rick Scott, signed a \\"tough\\" new Florida statewide law, that \\"forbid city and county governments from enacting or enforcing local gun-control regulations.\\" The law, which was backed by the NRA, applies hefty fines to any city of county that tries to \\"adopt or enforce local gun laws\\". As NRA lobbyist, Hammer was cited as saying, \\"The Constitution [Second Amendment] protects the right to keep and bear arms. Local governments are not allowed to regulate the Bill of Rights.\\" She criticized the February 26, 2014 actions of the Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum who subsequently was sued by Florida Carry and the Second Amendment Foundation. She said Mayor Andrew Gillum's attack on NRA was \\"unwise\\"; he was just \\"stomping his feet for attention.\\" In a November 30, 2017 statement, Hammer sent a statement to the USF and NRA members and friends, calling on them to email Florida Supreme Court Justice Barbara Pariente to tell her to resign. Her letter included the November 30, 2017 News Service Florida weekly political briefing notes, launching Hammer's campaign to \\"purge\\" Justice Pariente from a case, \\"which centers on whether [Governor Scott, who is pro-gun] or his successor has the legal authority to appoint replacements for three justices\\" that \\"could have far-reaching implications for the makeup of the court\\". In an interview with the News Service, Hammer said that, \\"The majority of our [The Supreme Court of FloridaFlorida supreme court] is ...liberal leaning and biased against the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\\" In March 2017, the court \\"upheld a longstanding ban on people openly carrying firearms in public.\\" In September 2017, the Supreme Court of Florida, unanimously voted to \\"dr[a]w a line in the sand in Florida's stand your ground law by saying the determination of immunity in a criminal case does not carry over to a civil case.\\" In December 2017, Hammer responded to the rejection by the Florida Senate Judiciary Committee of pro-gun proposals that would have loosened gun laws regarding carrying concealed- weapons near courthouses, religious institutions, private schools, day care facilities, and the inadvertent display of handguns. She said that, the proposal to \\"allow Floridians with concealed-weapons licenses to carry firearms\\" at religious institutions, is a \\"private property-rights measure.\\" She said with \\"2018 an election year it's important to know who isn't being truthful in their support of Second Amendment issues...We had Republicans who joined the Democrats as obstructionists last year, and bills would be (temporarily postponed), which was a type of protectionism for Republicans. This year, thankfully, they voted. They've been outed, and now we can report it.\\" The NRA political action committee (PAC), Political Victory Fund (NRA- PVF), keeps track of allegiance to NRA values through a scoring system established in the 1970s, by which they rate political candidates \\"based on voting records, and public statements\\" on their positions on gun rights on a point scale ranging from A+ to F. Governor Rick Scott, for example had the highest rating of A+ for his \\"unmatched record of support for the Second Amendment in Florida. Rick has signed more pro-gun bills into law in one term than any other governor in Florida history.\\" On February 22, 2018, in her position as USF executive director and as past president of the NRA, Hammer asked USF and NRA members and friends to email politicians that \\"Gun control won't protect our children.\\" She recommended that politicians focus on providing armed security in schools and on tightening of mental health laws. =Eddie Eagle GunSafe= Hammer began to develop the NRA program for children, Eddie Eagle GunSafe, in 1988, which was updated by Lisa Monroe, a University of Oklahoma School of Education early childhood education specialist contracted by the NRA. The NRA promotes Eddie Eagle GunSafe as an alternative to the (CAP law) or safe storage law. Marion Hammer, the NRA lobbyist who promoted the stand-your-ground law, created the Eddie Eagle GunSafe program in the late 1980s. According to the NRA, by 2016, there were 28 million children who had completed the Eddie Eagle program. In their testimony in Tennessee in 2016, the NRA lobbyist said that the Eddie Eagle program was the most effective way \\"to reduce firearm-related accidents\\" regarding children. Awards Hammer was awarded with the Outstanding Community Service Award from the National Safety Council in 1993. In 2005, Hammer was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame. Personal life Hammer's grandson has a disability and she has lobbied so that children with dyslexia can \\"use talking computers during standardized tests\\". She has \\"helped secure funding for the McKay scholarships for children with disabilities\\" and for funding to install \\"speed-limit signs outside private schools\\". Sally, the youngest of Hammer's three daughters was \\"diagnosed with a terminal, inoperable brain tumor\\" in 1995. When Sally's husband left shortly after the diagnosis, she and her two young children, 3-year-old Eric and Kayla, who was under one at the time, went to live with Hammer. Critics In her first year as NRA president, Hammer was criticized for holding the NRA convention on April 19, 1996, the one-year anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing. \\"Critics called that decision insensitive at best.\\" She said that the scheduling was done before the tragic bombing and if the NRA had rescheduled, \\"People would have said the only reason they changed it was because they somehow felt responsible.\\" According to a 2016 article in Newsweek, Hammer was allegedly involved in having a lawsuit against a skeet club dropped. In 2015 Southwest Florida Water Management District (Swiftmud), sued the Skyway Trap & Skeet Club in St. Petersburg for not building a barrier that would prevent spent ammunition from accumulating in neighboring Sawgrass Lake Park, a public wetland. In a February 11, 2016 statement, Hammer called on Governor Scott, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and the Florida legislature to abolish Swiftmud and to investigate Swiftmud's \\"blatant and wanton Civil Rights/Second Amendment rights violations.\\" Hammer wrote that Swiftmud was \\"a malignant state agency that uses unlimited tax dollars in what I can only called an evil attempt to steal private property and destroy a small private business.\\" Hammer met with Ben Albritton, the head of the committee that funds Swiftmud. Hammer said that a NRA lawyer wrote the document that spelled out the terms of the dismissal of the Swiftmud lawsuit. Hammer then sent this to Albritton and Governor Scott's office. Albritton had his assistant send an email to Swiftmud's Colleen Thayer with an attachment that spelled out the terms of the dismissal of the Swiftmud lawsuit. It was written as if Swiftmud had already consented to it. The digital signature on the document was \\"Marion\\". Harassment following Stoneman Douglas High School shooting Following the February 14, 2018 Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in which Nikolas Cruz killed fourteen students and three staff members using an AR-15 style semi- automatic rifle, Hammer participated in senate and house committee meetings to advocate for the NRA. In this role, Hammer has become the target of those calling for more gun control. She has been harassed in person, through phone calls, in written form‚Äîincluding emails‚Äîand fears that the threats may lead to physical violence. She \\"has been confronted and verbally attacked in grocery stores.\\" Her life has been disrupted and she has avoided public places and limited her social and public activities. On July 13, 2018 Hammer filed federal and state lawsuits seeking over $2 million in damages from five men who she claimed had harassed her. On November 28, 2018, U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle dismissed Hammer's claims against Lawrence Sorensen, a California attorney who had sent her two emails on March 24 with graphic images of gunshot wounds. Justice Hinkle said that Sorensen's emails, which he described as \\"disgusting\\" were protected by the First Amendment. Justice Hinkle said that, \\"The photographs were graphic, partly because they apparently depicted actual injuries. But images as graphic, or nearly so, can be seen in movies and video games, on cable if not also network television, and in medical literature. The photographs were germane to the policy debate that Ms. Hammer regularly participated in and Mr. Sorensen apparently sought to join. Sending these photographs, at least in these circumstances, was not tortious. And treating them as tortious would violate the First Amendment.\\" The dismissal is \\"limited to Sorensen\\".

The Kishwaukee River drainage area includes McHenry, Boone, Kane, DeKalb, Ogle, and Winnebago Counties.Kishwaukee River Watershed (PDF), Listed Streams, Environmental Protection Agency. Crop lands occupy two-thirds of the watershed's surface area. History The Kishwaukee has been used by humans for thousands of years. The Native Americans were the first to use it to transport goods for trade. The name Kishwaukee is derived from the Potowatomi word meaning the \\"river of the sycamore.\\" The Potowatomi used the large sycamore trees in the river valley for dugout canoes. Incidentally the river demarks the northernmost natural range of the sycamore tree.Kishwaukee Bottoms offers something for every outdoors person . Dr. Robert Hedeen, The Rock River Times, July 1, 1993. (Archived by WebCite). Native Americans began to arrive in the area in the closing years of the last Ice Age. Near the mouth of the Kishwaukee, not too far from the Rock River valley are several mound sites from the Mississippian period, around 900 CE or the Upper Mississippian period around 1400 CE. No archaeological sites have been identified from the Native American period, which is generally said to be around 1650. Despite this, it is known that several groups occupied the area during that time and the Mascouten were in the Kishwaukee region at the time of the first contact with Europeans, around 1655. Waste spills and fish kills On Wednesday April 20, 1988 the employees of Lincoln Land Hog Farm, north of Sycamore, were working on a pipe on the farm's retention pond. The berm wall gave way allowing two million gallons of hog waste to spill into the Kishwaukee River. The result, aquatic life downstream was utterly vanquished. The Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) stated that of the river were affected and an estimated 70,000 fish were killed along with aquatic plants, insects, clams and crustaceans.Fish Kills on the Kishwaukee River . Mac McIntyre, DeKalb County Online, May 29, 2014. (Archived at WebCite) This, however was not the first fish kill along the Kishwaukee and the city of DeKalb has been the location of more than half of the fish kills since 1954. Of the 19 documented fish kills since that year, 11 of them have occurred within DeKalb city limits. Another well documented fish kill along the Kishwaukee was in 1984. According to IDOC reports the 1984 fish kill and a number of others were in direct correlation with heavy canning activities at the Del Monte canning facility that once operated on Taylor Street in DeKalb. The 1984 fish kill affected a portion of the river from a bend north of Lucinda Avenue, near Annie's Woods to Lincoln Highway. IDOC gathered evidence that proved a faulty pipe at Del Monte was responsible for this particular fish kill. Del Monte cut the state a check for the value of lost fish and took steps to prevent a similar mishap after they found out they were culpable. Hydrologic history A mid September thunderstorm rolls into DeKalb over the Kishwaukee River. The United States Geological Survey maintains four monitoring stations, in cooperation with National Weather Service, along the Kishwaukee River and has extensive data on low records and high crests and other information that is hydrologically pertinent. The four stations are in DeKalb, Fairdale, Belvidere and Perryville Road in Rockford. The DeKalb and Fairdale stations are along the South Branch Kishwaukee while the other two are both along the main branch. Flood stages vary slightly at each of the monitoring stations.

These boulders were dubbed \\"hard heads\\" by the locals and were used in the underpinning of barns and for the stoning of wells. The glaciation was responsible for these boulders as well. Two major ice sheets advanced over the Kishwaukee basin in its past. The first, the Illinoian covered the area 300,000 to 125,000 years ago. Though the Illinoian covered the entire area evidence of the coverage is found only in a few sediments at the surface in select sites. The reason for this is the second ice sheet, the Wisconsinan advanced over the area 25,000 to 13,500 years ago and covered over most of the prior glacial deposits.The Kishwaukee River Basin, 1997 Inventory of the Region's Resources. The end moraines that mark where the glacial margin once stood. One of the more visible of these formations is the Marengo Moraine which is a north‚Äìsouth moraine in western McHenry County which extends southwest across northwestern Kane County. The ridge is named after the town of Marengo, located on the moraine. North of the Marengo Moraine and to the west of the North Branch Kishwaukee River is a deep depression, or notch, across the Marengo Moraine. The depression is a subglacial channel, easily differentiated from a valley by the lack of rivers and streams along its bottom. The channel once carried meltwater from under and in front of the glacier when it was depositing its moraine. Tributaries Major tributaries of the Kishwaukee River include Piscasaw Creek, Rush Creek, Beaver Creek, Killbuck Creek, the North Branch Kishwaukee River and two separate tributaries called South Branch Kishwaukee River. Other tributaries include Mokeler Creek, Bessie Creek, Lawrence Creek, Owens Creek and Coon Creek.Kishwaukee River , Watersheds of Illinois ‚Äì 1996 Fact Sheet, Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, 1996, accessed January 22, 2011.L.

Wildlife The sun sets over Northern Illinois University as the Kishwaukee River meanders its way along in the background.As a \\"Class A\\" stream fish in the Kishwaukee thrive in a sediment free environment. Class A is denoted by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR), the IDNR samples fish populations and measures pollution at stream sites throughout the state. A designation of Class A describes a stream where a significant number of the species of fish are silt intolerant.Kishwaukee River Watershed, Friends of the Kishwaukee. The Kishwaukee River watershed is home to 28 endangered, threatened, or watch- listed species.Kishwaukee River Watershed , Friends of the Kishwaukee. =Plants= Plant life along the Kishwaukee is abundant. Various native flora from burr oaks, and lady's slippers to lousewort, and trilliums to trout lilies. Skunk cabbage blooms in late February and at the other end of the spectrum goldenrods and gentians bloom in late October, 1,070 species of plant are found in the Kishwaukee Basin, around 34% of the state's native vascular plants. Of that number 14 are listed as endangered in Illinois and another 14 as threatened in the state as of 1997. In addition the prairie bush clover is a federally threatened species that occurs in the basin. Invasive species continue to be a problem in the Kishwaukee River Basin. 21% of the area's plants are foreign species. Canada thistle has persisted in the region since as early as 1922 when McHenry County started showing concern. \\"The county has its regular thistle commissioners and they in turn have been authorized to engage scores of assistants to aid in doing away with these pests ... If the land owner refuses to cut them down at the lawful time, the commissioner simply hires a man [at $3 to $4 a day] to do the work and reports the transaction and makes a bill which is placed against the land at the coming tax paying season\\", McHenry County officials were recorded as saying at the time. The vegetation that dots the Kishwaukee Basin today is but a fraction of what it once was. In 1820, before European colonization, around 74% of the riparian area was forested, and the remainder was prairie. The forests were varied. Savanna, blacksoil and gravel prairies were included in the 74%, as well as various wetlands. Toward the southwest the land became flatter and dominated by prairie thanks to few natural barriers for wildfires. By 1997 those numbers had dwindled. McHenry County still had the highest percentage of wetlands, at 6.2% and DeKalb County still had the least at 1.0% =Mammals= A muskrat moves through the waters of the Kishwaukee River. Muskrat are one of many mammals to be found in and around the river.Rabbit, woodchuck and skunk are all common along the river. The once common martin and prairie wolf no longer occur in the area. White-tailed deer are numerous as they are over much of the state of Illinois. One of the smallest and fiercest mammals in Illinois is the shrew. Shrew will not hesitate to go after prey twice its size and four of the state's six shrew species can be found around the Kishwaukee River. Though none of the shrew species are endangered the tiny pygmy shrew has been called the \\"rarest shrew in Illinois.\\" They have been collected along the Kishwaukee and their abundance suggests they may be more common than previously assumed. River otters Before 1987 the IDNR's records show no signs of river otter in the Kishwaukee River. The reason was that the Kishwaukee and its tributaries wandered through prairies with little or no tree cover. It was only once the prairies were farmed that trees began to thrive along the shores of the river, creating ideal habitat for river otters. Today the Kishwaukee provides habitat suitable for river otters. By 1997 the river otter had been sighted along the South Branch Kishwaukee River. In addition to tree cover river otters find ideal habitat in northern Illinois when it is isolated from the main river channel, has extensive vegetation, open water in winter, good water quality, suitable den sites and minimal human disturbance. =Amphibians and reptiles= Twelve amphibian and 21 reptile species can be found along the river. That represents 30% of the amphibians and 34% of reptiles found in Illinois. Although, there are not currently any endangered or threatened reptile or amphibian species the river basin was at one time home to the state-endangered eastern Massasauga. =Birds= The Kishwaukee's bird population is not atypical for the area, which is primarily agricultural. Of the 299 species of bird that regularly occur in Illinois at least 262 of them can be found along and around the Kishwaukee River. Around 135 species have bred in and around the Kishwaukee River at some time or another. The wetlands that remain along the Kishwaukee are some of the most desirable habitat for avian species. Exner Marsh and Kloemphen Marsh, both in McHenry County, have great blue heron, pied-billed grebe, king rail, common gallinule, veery the state-endangered yellow-headed blackbird, the state- endangered osprey, and the state-threatened least bittern. Several Bald Eagles hunt and nest in the Rockford area. Parks and conservation =Boone County= In Boone County the Boone County Conservation District maintains Kishwaukee Bottoms. The Bottoms encompass several individual conservation areas. Anderson Bend, Distillery and LIB are all three located along the Kishwaukee River west of Belvidere. The LIB entrance is located west of Belvidere. The areas that are part of Kishwaukee Bottoms lie along the banks of the river and thus host typical flora and fauna of northern Illinois river bottom. Silver maple, sycamore and willow trees populate the shores of the river. These species dominate because of adaptations which allow them to withstand seasonal flooding. Lower areas in the Bottoms are sprinkled with wetlands that are populated by myriad aquatic species including turtles, frogs and beaver. Water fowl and wading birds are common throughout the marsh as well as along much of the Kishwaukee River itself. In all Kishwaukee Bottoms contains of wild land which contains little development. Hiking and skiing trails total about and wind through prairies, woodlands, and wetlands. =DeKalb County= The DeKalb County Forest Preserve District operates a number of forest preserves along the Kishwaukee River. MacQueen Forest Preserve and Potawatomi Forest Preserve are adjacent and straddle the north side of the bank of South Branch while just across the stream, on the banks' south side, is the nearly preserve set aside by the state. In all, the area of MacQueen and Potawatomi preserves encompasses more than and of the Kishwaukee River, which is not only set aside for public use but actively being conserved and monitored.Forest Preserve Locations, DeKalb County Forest Preserve. Kishwaukee River State Fish and Wildlife Area Under Governor George Ryan the state of Illinois acquired of land along the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb County. The land was purchased using $2.68 million in Illinois Open Land Trust funding. The area was opened to the public as the Kishwaukee River State Fish and Wildlife Area.NewsFront , Outdoor Illinois, March 22, 2002, Illinois Periodicals Online, Northern Illinois University Libraries. =Winnebago County= The Winnebago County Forest Preserve District operates and maintains Kishwaukee River Forest Preserve. This preserve was acquired by the district in 1927. Included in the preserve is canoe access, of hiking trails, fishing access and a oak woods site. The oak woods is an Illinois Natural Area Inventory site of notable natural quality, and trails provide public access.Kishwaukee River Forest Preserve, Winnebago County Forest Preserve District. The Winnebago County Forest Preserve District also owns and operates Oak Ridge Forest Preserve, Deer Run Forest Preserve, Espenscheid Memorial Forest Preserve, McKiski Forest Preserve, Blackhawk Springs Forest Preserve, Kishwaukee Gorge North Forest Preserve, Kishwaukee Gorge South Forest Preserve, Rockford Rotary Forest Preserve, Kilbuck Bluffs Forest Preserve, and Hinchliff Forest Preserve. The Rockford Park District owns and operates the Seth B. Atwood Park, the former rifle range of Camp Grant. The Village of Cherry Valley owns and operates the Baumann Park. Environmental preservation The Kishwaukee River Ecosystem Partnership, founded in 1996, is an organization whose purpose is the continued preservation of the river's natural resources. Friends of the Kishwaukee River, founded in 2012, is a non- profit organization whose mission is to promote and enhance good stewardship of the river and the surrounding lands by restoring and preserving its natural character, encouraging safe and responsible recreation, protecting its watershed from degradation, and increasing the area's community's appreciation of its natural beauty.

Set in a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri, the series stars Breckin Meyer and Kiele Sanchez. The show was a part of the TGIF Friday night line up, after Hope & Faith, airing at 9:30 EST. The show earned fair enough ratings to get picked up for a whole season, but it was cancelled at the end of the season. The series followed the adventures of a single-child New Yorker adjusting to life with his wife's large, close-knit suburban family. The show was originally to be titled Back to Kansas. Premise Producer Tom Hertz (Spin City, Less Than Perfect) loosely based this comedy on his life experiences. The sitcom centers on New York loner Tom (Breckin Meyer, Clueless) who was raised as an only child. After he marries Susan (Kiele Sanchez, That Was Then), a woman raised in the Midwest by a large family, they move to Kansas to be closer to them and he has to quickly adjust to life with a big, caring family. When Tom married Susan he thought he was only getting a new wife. He never even considered that he would be getting a brand-new family as well. Included in this new family are mother Sandy, the rule-maker of the house, and father Bill, once an only child, who could be the person Tom can relate to the most. There's also Susan's competitive sister Mary and her husband Chris, who considers himself Bill and Sandy's favorite son-in-law and finds Tom as somewhat of a threat. And finally there's Susan's brother Lewis, a shy and awkward young man who has made a career of collecting bugs. Other family members who occasionally drop by include Uncle Dave, the big-shot of the family, and Lisa, the youngest daughter who wants to backpack around Europe and become an art major. When Married to the Kellys premiered Fridays at 8:30pm/7:30 central during ABC's fall 2003 season, it aired after George Lopez, where ABC brought back its famed TGIF block along with the new Kelly Ripa comedy Hope & Faith and Life with Bonnie. Originally bought by ABC as The Untitled Tom Hertz Project the show needed a quick title in order for the series to be promoted in time for the network to unveil its new line-up. So they decided on the tentative title Back to Kansas. Although the series does take place in Kansas the title didn't quite work since the main character isn't really returning to Kansas (his wife is) and the show wasn't really about the wife's \\"return\\" to Kansas but more about the entire Kelly family and the main character's efforts in trying to fit into a new situation. The show soon acquired the more appropriate and fitting title Married to the Kellys. An interesting fact about the show is that Tom Hertz didn't just use real life situations as inspiration for this sitcom, he also used real life family members. All the characters in the series were named after Tom, his wife and his in-laws (with the exception of Lewis). Married to the Kellys also starred Josh Braaten (That '80s Show), Nancy Lenehan (Grace Under Fire), Emily Rutherfurd (The Ellen Show, Van Wilder), Sam Anderson (Angel) and newcomer Derek Waters.

Biography Presley Marion Rixey The older brother of John Franklin Rixey,Dr. Presley M. Rixey, President McKinley's Physician, Appointed Rixey earned his medical degree at the University of Virginia in 1873. On 25 April 1877, he married Earlena J. English, daughter of Rear Admiral Earl English, United States Navy. He was commissioned Assistant Surgeon in the Navy on 28 January 1874. He served on the , , (1879‚Äì82), (1884‚Äì87), (1893‚Äì96), and , Biographical Sketches of Distinguished Officers of the Army and Navy receiving promotion to Passed Assistant Surgeon on 18 April 1877, to Surgeon on 27 November 1888, and was commissioned as a Medical Inspector on 24 August 1900. He was assigned as the personal physician to First Lady Ida McKinley in 1899 and spearheaded her improved health during the following few years. As he traveled with the McKinleys during this time providing personal care of Mrs. McKinley, he was present when President McKinley was shot in Buffalo. He attended President McKinley after he was shot in Buffalo, New York, in 1901. Rixey was appointed Surgeon General of the United States Navy on 15 February 1902 and served as Chief of the Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, with the rank of rear admiral, until his retirement on 4 February 1910. During his tenure as Surgeon General, Rixey strongly supported the foundation of a women's nursing corps for the Navy. In his 1902 annual report, he stated that, \\"There has been a growing conviction in the minds of many of the most experienced medical officers of the service, especially since the war with Spain, that the employment of women for the nursing of the sick in our large hospitals would result in greater efficiency than has been obtained heretofore by the use of male nurses alone, and that such employment would not conflict with the conditions arising from the military character of the institution.\\" With his help, the Navy Nurse Corps was finally established in 1908. He accompanied President Theodore Roosevelt during his November 1906 visit to the Panama Canal Zone, and reviewed health and sanitation procedures there.Special Message of the President Concerning the Panama Canal, December 17, 1906 (pp. 57-59): http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/images/research/txtspeeches/962.pdf From 16 January 1913 to 16 April 1917, Rixey served as a member of the Naval Examining Board, presiding over it during the last four months of that period.

The parish population at the 2011 census was 2,743. The electoral ward of Wendron had a 2011 population of 4,936. History The parish of Wendron was part of the Hundred of Kerrier and was originally bounded by the parishes of Illogan, Gwennap, Stithians, Constantine, Mawgan-in-Meneage, Gunwalloe, Sithney and Crowan. Until the mid 19th-century the parish of Wendron included the town of Helston and what are now the parishes of Carnmenellis and Pencoys. The parish of Carnmenellis was created in 1846; Helston in 1848; and Pencoys in 1881. Before 1284 Edmund, Earl of Cornwall, gave the church of Wendron, with its chapels, to Rewley Abbey near Oxford. Before this it had belonged to the Earl's, Manor of Helston, which included the whole parish. The church is cruciform but was enlarged in the 15th-century and is a grade I listed building. The church contains the brass of Warin Penhalluryk, rector of St Just, vicar of Wendron and Stithians, d. 1535. The holy well of St Wendrona is at Trelill and nearby was her chapel, which was licensed in 1427, at about the same date as the well. At Degibna, on Loe Pool, was a chapel dedicated to St Degamanus. At Bodilly was a chapel of St Henry the Hermit (died 1120, feast day on 16 January).Henderson (1925), pp. 10 and 217‚Äì18. The Revd G. H. Doble served for almost twenty years as the vicar of Wendron (1925‚Äì1945). Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded the existence of seven stone crosses in the parish, including two at Merther Uny. The other crosses were in the churchyard, and at Boderwennack, Bodilly, Manhay-vean and Trenethick. There is also an early cross-slab in the church.Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard ;Merther Uny At Merther Uny was a quasi-parochial chapel of St Uny with its own cemetery. The farm called Marooney was recorded as Mertharuny in 1751 and Metheruny in 1756. In a circular garden still known as \\"the churchyard\\" in which human bones have been dug up are the remains of a small chapel. Nearby is \\"a magnificent Celtic cross of an enriched and most original design\\". This chapel is on the site of a very ancient church in honour of St Euny. After the Reformation it was allowed to decay. Arthur Langdon (1896) records two crosses at Merther Uny (one illustrated below right). The roadside cross at Merther Uny Arthur Langdon (1896) gave the following account of the Merther Uny crosses: \\"The cross stands in situ on the Merther Uny estate, on Polglaze Hill, by the left-hand side of the road from St. Wendron to Constantine. Formerly there was a road leading down to Merther Uny old churchyard, the entrance to which was close to the cross; but all traces of this road have now disappeared. A tradition is still believed in the neighbourhood that a man lies buried beneath the cross. The monolith is known locally as 'Meruny Cross'.\\"--\\"The cross occupies its original site, near the south side of the entrance to the old churchyard, and stands on a base ... The cross has some very curious ornament, and in many points resembles that at Roche ...\\"Langdon, A. G. (1896) Old Cornish Crosses. Truro: Joseph Pollard; pp. 264 & 346 ;Nonconformity There were Wesleyan Methodist chapels at Edgcumbe, Menhay, Penmarth, Porkellis, Burrows, Coverack Bridges, Degibna, Gweek and Crelly. There were Bible Christian chapels at Boskenwyn Downs and Carnkie; Wesleyan Methodist Free chapels at Trewenack and Four Lanes; and a Baptist chapel in Lower Town, now part of Helston. The Long Stone on Prospidnick Hill is just to the east. The villages of Wendron Churchtown, Coverack Bridges, Lower Town, Trewennack, Gweek, Edgecumb, Menhay and Four Lanes were in the historic parish. The former Wendron School Mining The Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World Heritage Site is partly in Wendron parish. The earliest recorded record of mining is from 1326, where there was a mechanical tin smelter in the village of Penmarth. By the early 18th-century there were underground mines and in the 19th-century Wendron was an important tin-mining area. Severe unemployment was caused when mining declined and in 1878 the landowner, Lord Robartes, tried to help the unemployed by bringing uncultivated land into production. In 1883 there were just four mines working in the parish, but only one making a profit. Mengern Mine employed eighteen underground, around twelve on the surface dressing floors, and sold on average three tons of tin per month. New Trumpet was recently started and despite a lack of wealthy investors was expected to be successful. It was reported in March 1883 that the mine was producing excellent copper-ore and tin is expected below the copper, in the eastern part of the old Trumpet Consol sett. East Lovell was in debt to the tune of ¬£5,100 and there was a proposal to sell the pumping engine and stamps, which were valued at ¬£500. The fourth mine, The Lovell was drained by a water wheel in the Ninnis Valley with was said to be economical.

He created New York's Downtown Divas revues in the 80s, was the co-founder and editor-in-chief of OutWeek Magazine, became the first openly gay columnist at a major American newspaper, New York Newsday, and authored the book Sexual Ecology. He now makes documentaries for HBO, The History Channel and other networks.  Biography  = Early life = Gabriel Rotello was born and raised in Danbury, CT and attended Knox College and Carlton College. He was in the first group of American exchange students to live and study in Kathmandu, Nepal. After graduating Rotello became a New York City keyboard player, arranger and music director. In 1979 he co-founded the underground band Brenda and the Realtones, whose story was recounted in the Off Broadway show Endangered Species in 1997. In the 1980s, as music director of The Realtones he backed artists such as Ronnie Spector, Darlene Love, Solomon Burke, Rufus Thomas and many others. In the mid 1980s he produced a series of music revues at The Limelight, The Palladium and The Saint under the general name Downtown Dukes and Divas. Among his collaborators were The Uptown Horns, David Johansen, Cherry Vanilla, Johnny Thunders, The Lady Bunny, Holly Woodlawn, Joey Arias, David Peaston, Taylor Mead, Sylvain Sylvain, Jackie Curtis, Dean Johnson, Michael Musto, Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato of the Fabulous Pop Tarts and many others. Rotello's life and productions during this period were frequently filmed by videographer Nelson Sullivan, and are now part of Sullivan's archive of downtown life in the '80s. = AIDS activism and Outweek = In 1988 Rotello joined the AIDS activist group ACT UP and served on its fundraising committee. In 1989 he co-founded OutWeek Magazine with businessman Kendall Morrison and became its editor-in-chief. The New York Times called OutWeek \\"‚Ä¶the most progressive of the gay publications,\\" and Time Magazine wrote that \\"its greatest success was in shaking up its competitors by challenging their brand of gay activism with a more militant stance.\\" Rotello and OutWeek became controversial for the practice of outing, which originated at OutWeek, and for promoting the word queer as a catch-all phrase for sexual minorities. As an investigative reporter Rotello helped break numerous stories such as the Covenant House scandal and the Woody Myers affair, which the New York Times called \\"the most bitter dispute of the Dinkins administration.\\" Many of the young staffers Rotello hired at OutWeek went on to become well- known figures in gay and lesbian writing, publishing and other fields, including Michelangelo Signorile, Sarah Pettit, Dale Peck, Jim Provenzano, K.M. Soehnlein and James St James. = New York Newsday = Rotello left OutWeek shortly before it folded in 1991 and was hired as a columnist by New York Newsday, becoming the first openly gay man to become a columnist at a major American newspaper. For his weekly columns, which explored gay life, homophobia and the AIDS epidemic, he received the GLAAD Award as Outstanding Journalist in 1995. After New York Newsday folded he became a columnist for The Advocate and wrote for the Village Voice, The New Scientist, Out Magazine, The Nation and The New York Times. = Sexual Ecology = In 1997 Rotello published Sexual Ecology: AIDS and the Destiny of Gay Men (Dutton). Its investigation of why HIV continues to infect large numbers of gay men, and its conclusion that partner reduction must be added to the strategy of condoms to bring new infections down, ignited a major debate and Sexual Ecology became one of the most controversial gay books of its generation. It has been called \\"a remarkable book...a breath of fresh air in the growing litany about the AIDS epidemic\\" (The New Scientist), \\"‚Ä¶the Silent Spring of the AIDS epidemic (Boston Globe) and \\"...the most important book about gay men and AIDS since And the Band Played On\\" (The Nation). But it was also criticized for offering \\"‚Ä¶a message of empathy laced with contempt\\" (Out Magazine), and as \\"‚Ä¶.an ugly distortion of gay life\\" (The Village Voice). In 1998 Rotello co-wrote My Life and the Paradise Garage with Mel Cheren, a memoir about the legendary gay disco Paradise Garage, its pioneering DJ Larry Levan and the impact of AIDS on a generation of gay men. = TV and film = In 1998 Rotello moved to Los Angeles and began making documentaries exploring American life and popular culture with World of Wonder founders Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato. Their first collaboration, the documentary Party Monster, centered on New York's downtown nightclub scene, a world which Rotello, Bailey and Barbato knew from their earlier days as musicians. Their next feature, The Eyes of Tammy Faye, is on Current TV's list of 50 Documentaries to See Before You Die. Rotello's work with Bailey and Barbato includes a number of high-profile documentaries and documentary series including AMC's Hollywood Fashion Machine, HBO's Hidden F√ºhrer: Debating the Enigma of Hitler's Sexuality; HBO's Monica in Black and White, Bravo's Reality of Reality, AMC's Movies That Shook the World, and AMC's Out of the Closet/Off The Screen: The William Haines Story, as well as reality shows such as RuPaul's Drag Race. Their 2010 HBO film The Strange History of Don't Ask Don't Tell was nominated for an Emmy Award and a GLAAD Award. Rotello currently makes science and history documentaries with Flight 33 Productions for the History Channel, Discovery Channel and National Geographic Channel, including series such as The Universe, Life After People, Big History and America's Secret Slang.

Charles, Duke of Calabria (1298 ‚Äì 9 November 1328), was the son of King Robert of Naples and Yolanda of Aragon. Charles was born in Naples in 1298, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King Charles II, the second king of the Angevin dynasty that ruled Naples since 1266. Charles was the son of the King's third son Prince Robert and his consort Yolanda of Aragon. Little is known of his early life, so one can assume that he spent his early years at the court of his grandfather. In 1309, Charles' grandfather died and his father became King Robert the Wise. It was then that he became Duke of Calabria and was created Vicar-General of the Kingdom of Sicily (Naples). His father intended him to lead the force sent to aid Florence in 1315, but was constrained by time to send his uncle, Philip I of Taranto, instead. The Florentine-Neapolitan coalition was badly beaten at the ensuing Battle of Montecatini. The victory of Castruccio Castracani at Altopascio in 1325 led the Florentines to elect Charles signore (lord) of the city for ten years in 1326. At the time, he was unsuccessfully attempting to seize Sicily from his first cousin Frederick III, and sent Walter VI of Brienne as his deputy until he could arrive, where Walter made a (misleadingly) favorable impression. While Charles' arrival checked Castruccio, he exacted onerous taxes from the Florentines, until he was recalled to Naples in December 1327 due to the advance of Emperor Louis IV into Italy. There he died in 1328. He left as heir his eldest surviving daughter, Joanna Œô; a posthumous daughter, Marie, was born in 1329. Charles was buried in the church of Santa Chiara in Naples. Marriages and issue In 1316, he married Catherine of Habsburg (1295‚Äì1323), daughter of Albert I of Germany. Catherine died in 1323, ad Charles married Marie of Valois (1309‚Äì1332), daughter of Charles of Valois, later that same year. They had five children: * Eloisa (b. January or February 1325 ‚Äì d. 27 December 1325). * Joanna Œô (b. Naples, March 1326 ‚Äì d. castello di San Fele, 22 May 1382), Queen of Naples after succeeded her grandfather. * Charles Martel (b.

Publication history Transdimensional Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was written by Erick Wujcik with a cover by Kevin Long and illustrations by James Lawson, and was published by Palladium Books in 1989 as a 112-page book. Contents Transdimensional Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a supplement of rules for travel to and adventures in other times and parallel worlds. The book includes lots of new mutants and mutations (such as mutant dinosaurs), rules for building and using time machines, ancient and black powder weapons, and magic. Time travel =Principles= The time travel system lays out a system of temporal physics that represents time as a \\"flowing tube\\" that spirals along in twists and the twists are themselves wrapped into coils. This model can be imagined by thinking of a telephone cord wrapped around a cylinder. Time travel is possible by leaving your current point in the tube and travelling either to a neighboring twist or any coil. Coils allowed time travellers to travel into the past by great leaps, to predefined years. The farther in the past the coil, the greater the gap. The first few coils closest to present day are separated by thousands of years, coils farther in the past were separated by millions and then billions of years. Roughly detailed in a few paragraphs, the coils go as far back as the beginning of the universe. Twists vary in size depending on which coil was considered its home coil. In the present-day coil (based on 1988, when the game was published), twists were 125 years apart. So, from 1988, one could travel into the past year of 1863 or to the future year of 2113. From the new twist, the time traveller could potentially travel another 125 years, either to return home or move farther away from their home time, to 1738 or 2238 respectively. There are rough details for past times with more detailed future times for the next millennia. These consist mostly of a variety of apocalyptic settings, ranging from Palladium's After the Bomb to robot massacres inspired by stories of artificial intelligences run amok, and a scant few more utopian settings. There were no guidelines for what would happen if one travelled so far down successive twists as to cross into another coil; however, twists were so comparatively small that it is mechanically discouraged to travel by such means. It is easier to simply jump directly to the desired coil. =Time stream alterations= Changes to the past (or future) are dealt with using alternate branching time streams (i.e., immutable timelines). Changes to a given timeline would automatically put travellers into an alternate branch with the changes in place. If the travellers somehow change the past and then travel back to the future to reach their home time, their home time will consequently appear different to them, according to the changes that were put in place. However, time stream changes were intended to be played with loosely. The sample adventure includes an instance where a player, while reading a history book, re-reads a section of the book and notices that there has been a change. Mutant animals This book introduced extinct animal species, including a wide variety of dinosaurs and Pleistocene mammals. New size levels were added to allow for some of the massive sizes of dinosaurs. A new method of mutation was introduced as well, allowing for the addition of BIO-E (\\"Biological Energy\\") for traveling into the future, making evolutionary mutation towards sentience something of a temporal mandate. This meant dinosaurs and other ancient creatures taken into present day would automatically mutate given enough time. This book also introduces the idea of mutant humans and features advanced psionic rules. Humans travelling into the future from an earlier era might also mutate. Humans could also remove hands, legs, or other features (those animal mutants usually must add to become more human-like) and potentially become smooth-skinned creatures with vestigial legs and arms that some evolutionary science fiction mused. By sacrificing default human attributes, humans could attain more powerful psionic phenomena, ranging from ectoplasmic arms and legs (to make up for a lack of them) and more powerful mental abilities not previously covered or available in the core rulebook.

It has about 3,100 inhabitants. It lies near ≈†umperk. Etymology The name of \\"Bludov\\" is derivered from the name of its probable founder Blud of Bludov. History Bludov was established in the 13th century and was the only Czech village in the German ≈†umperk District. Bludov was a farming village during the medieval and early modern eras. Local historian Jan B≈ôezina has speculated that gold was mined on Zlatn√≠k Hill, but there is little historical evidence for this claim. Panning may have been done in Vitonick√Ω Creek at Vlƒç√≠ D≈Øl. Blud of Bludov's son built the castle on the slope of the H√°j Hill. The Bludov Castle was destroyed during the Bohemian‚ÄìHungarian War. During the 16th century Bludov became the possession of a Zierotin noble, who built the Bludov Chateau. During the 15th century Bludov became a possession of Tunkl of Brn√≠ƒçko, who built six large ponds near the village. The pond were dried in the 19th century, because their maintenance did not pay off economically. During the second half of the 19th century, Bludov was industrialized with the construction of two mills, a sawmill, two textile workshops, an engineering works and a limekiln. At the beginning of the 20th century, the textile factories failed and a dairy, an iron-foundry and a distillery were established. In 1929 the Bludov Spa was opened. In 1963, the Vlƒç√≠ D≈Øl pool was opened. Small and medium-sized businesses were suppressed by the communist government during the 1950s, and the spa and dairy were nationalized. The head office of the farm collective was built opposite the Bludov Chateau, with concrete functionalist architecture. Economy Granodiorit quarry During the 1970s the dairy was rebuilt as the Nealko, a soft-drink factory. Agrega, a factory repairing electric motors, was also established. Nealko and Agrega faced financial troubles after the Velvet Revolution, prompting Agrega to expand its services to repair injection pumps, alternators, starters and cars and sell Peugeot and Citroen cars and auto parts. Nealko produced an unsuccessful soft-drink brand, Mon√°da. It then produced soft drinks for diabetics before going bankrupt at the beginning of the 21st century. In the Mohelnick√° Br√°zda lowlands, corn, barley, wheat, oilseed rape, poppy, sugar beet, alfalfa and flax are grown and cattle and broilers raised. The Granodiorite quarry is located on the Chochol√≠k Hill, where stone is processed into sand and a type of wollastonite known as Bludovit is sometimes mined. Bludovit is used decoratively, and its powder is used in blast furnaces. Bludov Spa is focused on treatment of obesity and musculoskeletal disorders.

The setting was an imaginary small town in the South Wales Valleys. The plot centered on the arrival of Randy (Michael Neill), an American visitor, who was taken in by the Price family (but had to share a bed with pensioner Idris, played by Islwyn Morris). Randy soon formed a relationship with local girl Mandy (Shelley Miranda Barrett). The other main characters were Idris's son, Gwynne (played by Boyd Clack, who also co-wrote the series), Gwynne's wife Moira (Ri Richards), barman Dai (Rhodri Hugh), and Mandy's friend Bridget (Einir Sion), replaced in the final series by the character of Donna (Kirsten Clark). In the final episode Randy moved into his own house with Mandy. There are continual references to Idris's ferret Sylvester (his beloved pet), and he eventually discovers that it is, in fact, a girl ferret. The reason for the title is explained in the first episode: the district had been used for the initial testing of satellite dishes, but when the time came to return the dishes or pay for the service, no one returned them and no one paid. Satellite City thus suggests a run-down area. In 1999 the series won a BAFTA Cymru Award for Best Light Entertainment. A pilot, eighteen 30-minute episodes and a one-hour special were made in all. The pilot was significantly different from the remainder of the series, portraying Idris as senile and deluded into believing that clothes pegs are talking to him.

She is bisexual, dating both Seth Cohen and Marissa Cooper in the second season of the series. Characterization and background =Conception= Creator Josh Schwartz described Alex as \\"the bad girl who runs the Bait Shop, which is the new club the kids are going to be hanging out at where all these bands will be performing at. She's our \\"Nat\\" (Beverly Hills 90210), if you will.\\" =Background= Alex is the resident bad girl in the show. In season 2, she reveals to Seth that she was expelled from the non- fictional Mater Dei School in Santa Ana (a Catholic school) and Newport Union High School, the local public school in Newport. Character history =Season 2= When Seth needed tickets to The Walkmen show for Summer and Zach, in an attempt at friendship, he goes to The Bait Shop to buy them. He asks Alex and she says that the show is sold out and that he'd have to work there to get tickets, and ends up hiring him. Seth convinces her to go on a date with Ryan (\\"The New Era\\"), with himself and Lindsay joining to make it a double date. It turns out that Ryan and Alex have very little in common, and when the date is over Seth goes back to The Bait Shop and apologizes to her for the horrible night, in which she replies that he's bratty and immature, but also charming. She says there is hope for him yet, and Seth asks her to go for ice cream. She kisses him on the stairs as they leave, and share ice cream on the pier. Seth invites her to the SnO.C. dance, she declines and tells him that he got the wrong idea out of the kiss. The same night, Zach appears at the Bait Shop for a drink. While there, he asks Alex for advice on Summer, oblivious to the fact that Alex actually knows Seth and Summer. She advises him to fight for Summer, otherwise she'll never fall for him. At the end of the conversation, she realizes that Zach is talking about Seth and Summer's relationship, and seems to contemplate making a move of her own. Alex shows up at the dance, and takes care of Seth after Zach punches him, and they end up sharing a kiss at the Bait Shop where they've gone to get a first aid kit. As their relationship has progressed, Seth keeps trying to impress her by being a \\"bad boy\\" by getting drunk and stealing Caleb's car. Upon realizing what Seth is doing Alex tells him that she's been with a lot of bad boys, and that he's just not one of them. She then proceeds to tell him that she likes him because he's a good guy. When Sandy, Seth's dad, shows up at the Bait Shop he asks her to tell Seth that they cannot see each other because Seth will not listen to him, as Sandy thinks Alex is a bad influence on Seth. When Seth ends up coming by the Bait Shop after sneaking out she tells him that his dad came by for a visit, and that she needs to do the right thing and not see him for a while. This doesn't last long as Alex then helps Seth and Sandy throw a surprise anniversary party for Kirsten, and they then approve of her. The good doesn't last long though; when Alex's ex-girlfriend, Jody, shows up in town it causes a strain between Seth and her and they decide to break up, and she apologizes for the incident. Alex and Marissa start to watch a horror movie the night she and Seth broke up. When they decide that they are cold, Alex reaches over Marissa to pull a blanket over them. As she leans over and pulls back, they share a glance at one another, and it is something Marissa has never experienced before. Alex and Marissa become very close over the next while, and when Alex's ex-girlfriend will not let her leave her house, Marissa gets her out of it by saying that she and Alex are dating. The next day, Alex then questions why they hang out so much, which ended up hurting Marissa's feelings. Later on, though, at The Bait Shop, Alex is listening to Rachael Yamagata sing a sultry tune when Marissa approaches her from behind and takes her hand, weaving their fingers together. They exchange smiles. On Valentine's Day, Marissa goes to see Alex at the Bait Shop after an awful dinner with Julie Cooper. Alex then asks Marissa if she's in the mood for the beach, which is where they share their first kiss. Alex then feels that Marissa is embarrassed by her because she won't tell anyone about them, but Marissa then tells her best friend Summer, making her happy. In the episode The Rainy Day Women, Marissa moves in with Alex. However, Alex and Marissa end up experiencing some problems in their relationship, mainly because of her jealousy towards Ryan. They later break up (The Blaze of Glory), which leaves Alex feeling devastated, prompting her to decide that she wants to go back home and return to high school. Alex appears in 13 episodes throughout the second season. She stated in the first episode that she appeared in (The New Kids on the Block) that she had attended (and got expelled from) numerous public schools in the surrounding areas. It's then revealed in a later episode (The Accomplice) that she had got emancipated from her parents; having done this, she dropped out of high school, got a job at The Bait Shop and moved into an apartment on the numeric streets of Newport Beach.

Early life William was educated by his uncle Hugh, forty-second abbot of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s at Paris, and, having been ordained subdeacon, received a prebend in the church of Sainte-Genevi√®ve-du- Mont. William reportedly sought entry into a stricter house (either a Cluniac or a Cistercian monastery) while still in his youth, though he decided to remain at Ste-Genevi√®ve. According to the hagiographic sources, his exemplary life did not commend him to his fellow canons, who tried to rid themselves of his presence, and even prevented by slander his ordination to the diaconate by the Bishop of Paris. William obtained this order from the Bishop of Senlis by his uncle's intercession, and was soon afterwards presented by the canons to the little priory of √âpinay. In 1148, by order of Pope Eugene III, the secular canons of Ste-Genevi√®ve were replaced by canons regular from the Parisian monastery of St. Victor, whose prior, Odo, was made abbot of Ste-Genevi√®ve. William soon afterwards joined the new community and was made sub-prior. In this position he showed great zeal for the religious life, and on one occasion opposed the entry of a new prior who had obtained his position irregularly. For this he was punished by Abbot Garin, successor of Odo, but his action was finally supported by Pope Alexander III. Such actions apparently put William at odds with his abbot, who subjected him to humiliating discipline, about which the canon complained bitterly to the pope. Work in Denmark In 1161 Absalon, bishop of Roskilde (and later archbishop of Lund) in Denmark, sent to Paris the provost of his cathedral (almost surely the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus) to obtain canons regular for the reform of the canonry of St. Thomas at Eskils√∏. Absalon and William were said to have formed a close friendship when the former was studying at the schools of Paris. In 1165 William journeyed to Denmark with three companions, and became abbot of that house. Denmark was an unwelcome destination for these French churchmen. Reiterating themes from the history of early-medieval Christian missions, William and his men were frightened by the culture and language of their new home, and the new abbot's original companions soon left him and returned to France, a permission denied to William. Nevertheless, despite difficulties arising from poverty and opposition on the part of the community, he reformed the monastery and in 1176 transferred it to √Übelholt, dedicated to the Paraclete, in Sj√¶lland (now Region Hovedstaden), near the present-day town of Hiller√∏d. As abbot, William worked to institute the standards of religious discipline emerging from reform centers in the heartlands of Latin Christendom. These included a stricter insistence on claustration. William also worked to establish closer links among Danish church institutions similarly committed to ecclesiastical rigor. These included other communities in the Augustinian tradition (such as Vestervig), but also extended to Cistercian houses, most notably the monks of nearby Esrum Abbey. William also continued to serve as an intermediary between Denmark and France. He likely had a hand in arranging for Absalon's relative (who replaced Absalon as bishop in Roskilde in 1192) to study at Ste-Genevi√®ve. Peder continued to enjoy a closer relationship with William after his return. Nowhere was William's role as a conduit between Gallic and Danish society more apparent, however, than in the \\"Ingeborg Affair.\\" Working apparently on behalf of King Knud VI of Denmark, and Absalon, William intervened in the case of Philip Augustus of France who was attempting to repudiate his wife Ingeborg (1175‚Äì1236), daughter of Valdemar I of Denmark. It was on this occasion that he composed a genealogy of the Danish kings, intended to disprove the alleged impediment of consanguinity between Ingeborg and Philip. Death and canonization According to the Vita composed to support his candidacy for sainthood, William died on Easter Sunday 1202, though the actual year was 1203. Numerous miracles were reported at his grave, and in 1218 the Archbishop of Lund, Anders Sunesen, requested that Pope Honorius III appoint a local commission to investigate the claims for William's sanctity. Their report was presumably sent to Rome, where it languished for some time. Then, in January 1224, William was canonized by Honorius, who acted on additional information provided by Cardinal Gregorius de Crescentio, recently returned from a papal legation to Denmark. A new church was constructed at √Übelholt Abbey and William's remains were moved there in 1238.  Sources for William's life and career  William of √Übelholt was the subject of a saint's Vita et miracula, composed most likely as part of his canonization process. It was printed in M.C. Gertz, ed., Vitae Sanctorum Danorum (Copenhagen, 1908‚Äì12), pp. 285‚Äì369. Gertz also included in that edition a brief treatise supposedly written by William on the authenticity of the relics of Saint Genevi√®ve (pp. 378‚Äì82). William's genealogy of the Danish kings can be found in M.C. Gertz, ed., Scriptores Miniores Historiae Danicae Medii Aevi, vol. 1 (Copenhagen, 1970; reprint of Copenhagen, 1917‚Äì18), pp. 176‚Äì85. William also left a substantial collection of letters, published most recently in the Diplomatarium Danicum, vol. 3,pt. 2, ed. C.A. Christensen, Herluf Nielsen, and Lauritz Weibull (Copenhagen, 1977). Further evidence can be found in charters dealing with √Übelholt (mostly transmitted through the archives of √Übelholt Abbey and its closest neighbor, Esrum). These have been published in the Diplomatarium Danicum.

Directed by German Expressionist filmmaker Paul Leni, the film stars Laura La Plante as Annabelle West, Forrest Stanley as Charles \\"Charlie\\" Wilder, and Creighton Hale as Paul Jones. The plot revolves around the death of Cyrus West, who is Annabelle, Charlie, and Paul's uncle, and the reading of his will 20 years later. Annabelle inherits her uncle's fortune, but when she and her family spend the night in his haunted mansion they are stalked by a mysterious figure. Meanwhile, a lunatic known as \\"the Cat\\" escapes from an asylum and hides in the mansion. The film is part of a genre of comedy horror films inspired by 1920s Broadway stage plays. Paul Leni's adaptation of Willard's play blended expressionism with humor, a style Leni was notable for and critics recognized as unique. Leni's style of directing made The Cat and the Canary influential in the \\"old dark house\\" genre of films popular from the 1930s through the 1950s. The film was one of Universal's early horror productions and is considered \\"the cornerstone of Universal's school of horror.\\"Carlos Clarens, An Illustrated History of Horror and Science-Fiction Films: The Classic Era, 1895‚Äì1967 (New York: Da Capo Press, 1997), p. 56, . The play has been filmed five other times, with the most notable in 1939 starring comedic actor Bob Hope and Paulette Goddard.  Plot  In a decaying mansion overlooking the Hudson River, millionaire Cyrus West approaches death. His greedy family descends upon him like \\"cats around a canary\\", causing him to become insane. West orders that his last will and testament remain locked in a safe and go unread until the 20th anniversary of his death. As the appointed time arrives, West's lawyer, Roger Crosby (Tully Marshall), discovers that a second will mysteriously appeared in the safe. The second will may only be opened if the terms of the first will are not fulfilled. The caretaker of the West mansion, Mammy Pleasant (Martha Mattox), blames the manifestation of the second will on the ghost of Cyrus West, a notion that the astonished Crosby quickly rejects. Annabelle West (Laura La Plante) is stalked in the night. As midnight approaches, West's relatives arrive at the mansion: nephews Harry Blythe (Arthur Edmund Carewe), Charles \\"Charlie\\" Wilder, Paul Jones, his sister Susan Sillsby (Flora Finch) and her niece Cecily Young (Gertrude Astor), and niece Annabelle West. Cyrus West's fortune is bequeathed to the most distant relative bearing the name \\"West\\": Annabelle. The will, however, stipulates that to inherit the fortune, she must be judged sane by a doctor, Ira Lazar (Lucien Littlefield). If she is deemed insane, the fortune is passed to the person named in the second will. The fortune includes the West diamonds which her uncle hid years ago. Annabelle realizes that she is now like her uncle, \\"in a cage surrounded by cats.\\" While the family prepares for dinner, a guard (George Siegmann) barges in and announces that an escaped lunatic called the Cat is either in the house or on the grounds. The guard tells Cecily, \\"He's a maniac who thinks he's a cat, and tears his victims like they were canaries!\\" Meanwhile, Crosby suspects someone in the family might try to harm Annabelle and decides to inform her of her successor. Before he speaks the person's name, a hairy hand with long nails emerges from a secret passage in a bookshelf and pulls him in, terrifying Annabelle. When she explains what happened to Crosby, the family immediately concludes that she is insane. Alone in her assigned room, Annabelle examines a note slipped to her which reveals the location of the family jewels, fashioned into an elaborate necklace. She follows the note's instructions and soon discovers the hiding place, in a secret panel above the fireplace. She retires for the night, wearing the diamond-encrusted necklace and begins to toss and turn. While Annabelle sleeps, the same mysterious hand emerges from the wall behind her bed and snatches the diamonds from her neck. Once again, her sanity is questioned, but as Harry and Annabelle search the room, they discover a hidden passage in the wall and in it the corpse of Roger Crosby. Mammy Pleasant leaves to call the police, while Harry searches for the guard; Susan runs away in hysterics and hitches a ride with a milkman (Joe Murphy). Paul and Annabelle return to her room to search for the missing envelope, and discover that Crosby's body is missing. Paul vanishes as the secret passage closes behind him. Wandering in the hidden passages, Paul is attacked by the Cat and left for dead. He regains consciousness in time to rescue Annabelle. The police arrive and arrest the Cat, who is Charlie Wilder in disguise; the guard is his accomplice. Wilder is the person named in the second will; he hoped to drive Annabelle insane so that he could receive the inheritance.  Cast   Production  The Cat and the Canary is the product of early 20th- century German Expressionism. According to art historian Joan Weinstein, expressionism includes the art styles of Die Br√ºcke and Der Blaue Reiter, cubism, futurism, and abstraction. The key element that connects these styles is the concern for the expression of inner feelings over verisimilitude to nature.Joan Weinstein, The End of Expressionism: Art and the November Revolution in Germany, 1918‚Äì1919 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990), p. 3, . Film historian Richard Peterson notes that \\"German cinema became famous for stories of psychological horror and for uncanny moods generated through lighting, set design and camera angles.\\" Such filmmaking techniques drew on expressionist themes. Influential examples of German expressionist film include Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) about a deranged doctor and Paul Leni's Waxworks (1925) about a wax figure display at a fair.Richard Peterson, liner notes, The Cat and the Canary (DVD, Image Entertainment, 2005). Waxworks impressed Carl Laemmle, the German-born president of Universal Pictures. Laemmle was struck by Leni's departure from expressionism by the inclusion of humor and playfulness during grotesque scenes. Meanwhile, in the United States, D. W. Griffith's One Exciting Night (1922) began a Gothic horror film trend that Laemmle wanted to capitalize on; subsequent films in the genre like Alfred E. Green's now lost The Ghost Breaker (1922), Frank Tuttle's Puritan Passions (1923), Roland West's The Monster (1925) and The Bat (1926), and Alfred Santell's The Gorilla (1927)‚Äîall comedy horror film adaptations of Broadway stage plays‚Äîproved successful.Steve Neale, Genre and Hollywood (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 95, .Ian Conrich, \\"Before Sound: Universal, Silent Cinema, and the Last of the Horror Spectaculars\\", in The Horror Film, ed. Stephen Price, (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 2004), p. 47, . Laemmle turned to John Willard's popular play The Cat and the Canary, which centered on an heiress whose family tries to drive her insane to steal her inheritance. Willard hesitated in permitting Laemmle to film his play because, as historian Douglas Brode explains, \\"that would have exposed to virtually everyone the trick ending, ... destroying the play's potential as an ongoing moneymaker.\\" Nevertheless, Willard was convinced and the play was adapted into a screenplay by Alfred A. Cohn and Robert F. Hill.Douglas Brode, Edge of Your Seat: The 100 Greatest Movie Thrillers (New York: Citadel Press, 2003), p. 32, . = Casting = The Cat and the Canary features veteran silent film stars Laura La Plante, Creighton Hale, and Forrest Stanley.

According to film historian Gary Don Rhodes, her part in The Cat and the Canary was typical for women in horror and mystery films: \\"The female in the horror film ... becomes the hunted, the quarry. She has little to do, and so the question becomes 'What will be done with her?'\\" Rhodes adds, \\"The heroines are young and beautiful, but represent more a prize to be possessed‚Äîwhether \\"stolen\\" by a villain or \\"owned\\" by a young hero at the films' conclusions.\\" Following The Cat and the Canary, La Plante maintained a career with Universal, but she is described as a \\"victim of talkies.\\"Hans J.

Lucien Littlefield was cast as deranged psychiatrist Dr. Ira Lazar who bore an eerie resemblance to Werner Krauss's title character in The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. = Directing = As Universal anticipated, director Paul Leni turned Willard's play into an expressionist film suited to an American audience. Historian Bernard F. Dick observes that \\"Leni reduced German expressionism, with its weird chiaroscuro, asymmetric sets, and excessive stylization, to a format compatible with American film practice.\\" Jenn Dlugos argues that \\"many stage play movie adaptations [of the 1920s] fall into the trap of looking like 'a stage play taped for the big screen' with minimal emphasis on the environment and plenty of stage play overacting.\\"Jenn Dlugos, review of The Cat and the Canary DVD, at Classic-Horror; last accessed January 4, 2007. This, however, was not the case for Leni's film. Richard Scheib notes that \\"Leni's style is something that lifts The Cat and the Canary up and away from being merely a filmed stage play and gives it an amazing visual dynamism.\\"Richard Scheib, review of The Cat and the Canary, at The SF, Horror and Fantasy Film Review ; last accessed January 4, 2007. Leni used similar camera effects found in German expressionist films such as The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari to set the atmosphere of The Cat and the Canary. The film opens with a hand wiping cobwebs away to reveal the title credits. Other effects include \\"dramatic shadows, portentous superimpositions and moody sequences in which the camera glides through corridors with billowing curtains.\\" Film historian Jan-Christopher Horak explains that a \\"matched dissolve from an image of the mansion and its oddly shaped towers to the oversized bottles of medicine that the dearly departed has been forced to consume functions as a double image of a prison, dwarfing the old man who sits alive with his will in a corner of the frame.\\"Jan- Christopher Horak, \\"Sauerkraut and Sausages with a Little Goulash: Germans in Hollywood, 1927.\\" Film History 17 (2005): pp. 241. Leni worked with the cast to add to the mood created by lighting and camera angles. Cinematographer Gilbert Warrenton recalled that Leni used a gong to startle the actors. Warrenton mused, \\"He beat that thing worse than the Salvation Army beat a drum.\\"Gilbert Warrenton, quoted in Kevin Brownlow, \\"Annus Mirabilis: The Film in 1927\\", Film History 17 (2005): p. 173. While the film contains elements of horror, according to film historian Dennis L. White it \\"is structured with an end other than horror in mind. Some scenes may achieve horror, and some characters dramatically experience horror, but for these films conventional clues and a logical explanation, at least an explanation plausible in hindsight, are usually crucial, and are of necessity their makers' first concern.\\"Dennis L. White, \\"The Poetics of Horror: More than Meets the Eye\\", Cinema Journal 10 (No. 2, Spring 1971): p. 5. Besides directing, Leni was a painter and set designer. The sets of the film were designed by Leni and fabricated by Charles D. Hall, who later designed the sets of Dracula (1931) and Frankenstein (1931).John T. Soister, Up from the Vault: Rare Thrillers of the 1920s and 1930s (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2004), p. 69, . Leni hoped to eschew realism for visual designs that reflected the emotions of characters. He wrote, \\"It is not extreme reality that the camera perceives, but the reality of the inner event, which is more profound, effective and moving than what we see through everyday eyes ....\\" Leni went on to direct the Charlie Chan film The Chinese Parrot (1927), The Man Who Laughs (1928), and The Last Warning (1929) before his death in 1929 from blood poisoning.Graham Petrie, Hollywood Destinies: European Directors in America, 1922‚Äì1931 (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2002), pp. 186‚Äì189 .

Variety opined, \\"What distinguishes Universal's film version of the ... play is Paul Leni's intelligent handling of a weird theme, introducing some of his novel settings and ideas with which he became identified .... The film runs a bit overlong .... Otherwise it's a more than average satisfying feature ....\\"Variety review of The Cat and the Canary, quoted in Roy Kinnard, Horror in Silent Films: A Filmography, 1896‚Äì1929 (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 1995), p. 200, . A New York Times review expounded, \\"This is a film which ought to be exhibited before many other directors to show them how a story should be told, for in all that he does Mr. Leni does not seem to strain at a point. He does it as naturally as a man twisting the ends of his mustache in thought.\\"Mourdant Hall, \\"Mr. Leni's Clever Film; 'Cat and Canary' an Exception to the Rule in Mystery Pictures\\", New York Times, September 18, 1927, p. X5. Nonetheless, as film historian Bernard F. Dick points out, \\"[e]xponents of Caligarisme, expressionism in the extreme ... naturally thought Leni had vulgarized the conventions [of expressionism]\\". Dick, however, notes that Leni had only \\"lighten[ed] [expressionist themes] so they could enter American cinema without the baggage of a movement that had spiraled out of control.\\"Bernard F. Dick, City of Dreams: The Making and Remaking of Universal Pictures (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1997), p. 56, . Modern critics address the film's impact and influence. Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice remarks, \\"[Leni's] adroitly atmospheric film is virtually an ideogram of narrative suspension and impact\\";Michael Atkinson, review of The Cat and the Canary DVD, The Village Voice (New York), March 3, 2005, available here . Chris Dashiell states that \\"[e]verything is so exaggerated, so lacking in subtlety, that we soon stop caring what happens, despite a few mildly scary effects\\", although he admits that the film \\"had a great effect on the horror genre, and even Hitchcock cited it as an influence.\\"Chris Dashiell, review of The Cat and the Canary, at CineScene.com ; last accessed January 4, 2007. Tony Rayns has called the film \\"the definitive 'haunted house' movie .... Leni wisely plays it mainly for laughs, but his prowling, Murnau-like camera work generates a frisson or two along the way. It is, in fact, hugely entertaining ....\\"Tony Rayns, The Time Out Film Guide, Second Edition, Edited by Tom Milne (London: Penguin Books, 1991), p. 106, . John Calhoun feels that what makes the film both \\"important and influential\\" was \\"Leni's uncanny ability to bring out the period's slapstick elements in the story's hackneyed conventions: the sliding panels and disappearing acts are so fast paced and expertly timed that the picture looks like a first-rate door-slamming farce .... At the same time, Leni didn't short-circuit the horrific aspects ....\\"John Calhoun, The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural, edited by Jack Sullivan (New York: Viking, 1986), p. 73, . Although not the first film set in a supposed haunted house, The Cat and the Canary started the pattern for the \\"old dark house\\" genre.Schatz, Genius of the System, p. 88. The term is derived from English director James Whale's The Old Dark House (1932), which was heavily influenced by Leni's film,Clarens, Illustrated History of Horror, p. 57. and refers to \\"films in which murders are committed by masked killers in old mansions.\\"Jeffrey S. Miller, Horror Spoofs of Abbott and Costello: A Critical Assessment of the Comedy Team's Monster Films (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2004), p. 2, . Supernatural events in the film are all explained at the film's conclusion as the work of a criminal. Other films in this genre influenced by The Cat and the Canary include The Last Warning, House on Haunted Hill (1959), and the monster films of Abbott and Costello and Laurel and Hardy.Miller, Horror Spoofs, pp. 2‚Äì3.Joseph Maddrey, Nightmares in Red, White, and Blue: The Evolution of the American Horror Film (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2004), p. 40, . A tinted version produced by David Shepard, film preservationist, was released on both VHS and DVD in 1997 and 2005 by Image Entertainment. The 2005 \\"Special Edition\\" contains an original score by Franklin Stover. The original black-and-white version airs infrequently on the cable television network Turner Classic Movies. In 2001, the American Film Institute nominated this film for AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 96% based on 25 reviews.http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1003747-cat_and_the_canary  Other film versions  The Cat and the Canary has been filmed five other times. Rupert Julian's The Cat Creeps (1930) and the Spanish language La Voluntad del muerto (The Will of the Dead Man) directed by George Melford and Enrique Tovar √Åvalos were the first talkie versions of the play; they were produced and distributed by Universal Pictures in 1930. Although the first sound films produced by Universal, neither was as influential on the genre as the first film and The Cat Creeps is lost.Soister, Up from the Vault, p. 74. The plot had become too familiar, as film historian Douglas Brode notes, and it \\"seemed likely the play would be put away in a drawer [indefinitely].\\" Yet Elliott Nugent's film, The Cat and the Canary (1939), proved successful.Douglas W. McCaffrey, The Road to Comedy: The Films of Bob Hope, (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 2005), pp. 28‚Äì29, .Alan Jones, The Rough Guide to Horror Movies (New York: Rough Guides, 2005), p. 77, . Nugent \\"had the inspired idea to openly play the piece for laughs.\\" The film was produced by Paramount and starred comedic actor Bob Hope. Hope played Wally Campbell, a character based on Creighton Hale's performance as Paul Jones. One critic suggests that Hope developed the character better than Hale and was funnier and more engaging. Other film adaptations include Katten och kanarief√•geln (The Cat and the Canary), a 1961 Swedish television film directed by Jan Molander and The Cat and the Canary (1978), a British film directed by Radley Metzger. The 1978 version was produced by Richard Gordon, who explains why he and Metzger made their film version: \\"Well, it hadn't been done since the Bob Hope version, it had never been done in colour, it was a well-known title, had a certain reputation, and it was something that logically could or in fact should be made in England.\\"Interview with Richard Gordon, in Tom Weaver, Return of the B Science Fiction and Horror Heroes: The Mutant Melding of Two Volumes of Classic Interviews (Jefferson, N.C.: McFarland, 2000), p. 192, .

A sequel to Black God, White Devil, it features the return of the character Antonio das Mortes, now as the protagonist, again played by Maur√≠cio do Valle. The original title is a reference to the tale of Saint George and the Dragon. Plot After the World War II, in the Brazilian sert√£o. A group of impoverished peasant mystics (beatos) gathered around Dona Santa (Rosa Maria Penna), a female spiritual figure, join in veneration of Saint George with an obscure figure named Coirana (Lorival Pariz). Coirana claims to have restarted the canga√ßo and seeks to take the revenge of Lampi√£o and other cangaceiro martyrs, presenting the tale of Saint George and the Dragon in a contemporary class conflict context. They threaten the town of Jardim de Piranhas governed by Coronel Hor√°cio (Joffre Soares) a blind and old cattle owner married to younger and attractive Laura (Odete Lara). Dr. Mattos (Hugo Carvana), the corrupt police chief of the town, hires Ant√¥nio das Mortes as a jagun√ßo against Coirana and Ant√¥nio fatally wounds Coirana in a duel. However, Ant√¥nio is changed by his experiences with the poor, and so he then demands that the coronel distribute the food stored in a warehouse to the remaining cangaceiros. The colonel raged and sent Mata Vaca (Vin√≠cius Salvatori) to kill Ant√¥nio das Mortes. But Ant√¥nio das Mortes with the help of his friend \\"Professor\\" (Othon Bastos) kills Mata Vaca and his jagun√ßos. The coronel is killed by Ant√£o (M√°rio Gusm√£o), the helper and possibly lover of Dona Santa in a scene reminiscent of Saint George slaying the Dragon iconography. The movie ends with Ant√¥nio das Mortes walking by the roadside, carrying on the struggle - in some ways hopeless or unending - which extends beyond the killing of the colonel and the expropriation of his land.

The range is about southwest of the Four Corners. The highest summit, Pastora Peak, is in elevation, whereas elevations on the surrounding plateau are near . Chuska Mountains (Arizona and New Mexico), each with a little snow. Also, two features of the Navajo Volcanic Province: BP Buell Peak (Arizona), (at southeast perimeter Canyon de Chelly, on north Defiance Plateau), and SR Ship Rock (New Mexico), (east of Red Rock Valley, colored red, and the Lukachukai Mountains, attached at north Chuskas). The mountains are within the Navajo Nation. Teec Nos Pos, Arizona, the closest community, is adjacent at the northern foothills, on Teec Nos Pos Wash, from Pastora Peak, about 5-mi miles to the north from the mountain's perimeter; Teec Nos Pos had about 800 inhabitants in the 2000 census.  Geology  The Carrizo Mountains primarily consist of igneous rocks that intruded Permian through Cretaceous marine strata. The most common igneous rock type is porphyritic hornblende diorite. Intrusive forms include laccoliths, stocks, sills, and dikes. Ages of the igneous rocks range from 70 to 74 million years. Similar igneous-cored ranges of the Colorado Plateau, including the Henry Mountains, Abajo Mountains and La Sal Range, formed ca. 31 to 20 million years ago, making them distinctly younger than the late Cretaceous intrusions of the Carrizo Mountains. Radiometric ages of igneous intrusions in Sleeping Ute Mountain are essentially identical to those of the diorite intrusions in the Carrizos. Both the Carrizo Mountains and Sleeping Ute Mountain are located along the southwest extension of the Colorado Mineral Belt, a 250-mile long lineament characterized by igneous rocks associated with abundant ore deposits. Large ore deposits have not been found in the igneous rocks of the Carrizo Mountains, although small deposits of uranium, vanadium, copper and silver have been found in the sedimentary rocks of the Morrison Formation.

Geographic range P. glutinosus is found from New York, west to Illinois, south to Mississippi, and east to Alabama, with isolated populations in southern New Hampshire and northwestern Connecticut.Powell, Robert; Conant, Roger; Collins, Joseph T.

(Plethodon glutinosus, pp. 82-84 + Plate 6). Common names The northern slimy salamander is so called because of the texture of its skin. It is also sometimes referred to as the viscid salamander, grey-spotted salamander, slippery salamander, or sticky salamander, depending on which source is consulted. Taxonomy P. glutinosus is one of 57 species in the genus Plethodon and was one of the first of its cogeners to be described. Due to its large geographic range, some taxonomic researchers have suggested splitting P. glutinosus into several distinct species, but this is not widely accepted. Description 130px The northern slimy salamander is typically an overall black in color, with numerous silvery spots or gold spots across its back. It is usually in total length (including tail), but can grow to 20.6 cm (8.1 in).Conant, Roger (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. xviii + 429 pp. + Plates 1-48. (hardcover), (paperback). (Plethodon glutinosus, pp. 276-277 + Plate 41 + Map 230). Males are not easily distinguished from females, though females tend to be slightly larger. It has 15-17 costal grooves.A northern slimy salamander in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee Behavior All plethodontid salamanders are territorial, and fight aggressively for territory. Their preferred habitat is in moist soil or leaf litter beneath stones, rotting logs, or other debris near a permanent water source. They sometimes make use of other animals' burrows. Their diet consists primarily of ants, beetles, sow bugs, and earthworms, but they will consume most kinds of insect. Reproduction Breeding of P. glutinosus takes place in the spring, and courtship consists of the males performing a sort of dance to attract the females' attention. Females lay clutches of four to 12 eggs in a moist area, which she guards, often neglecting food for the period until they hatch. Hatchlings emerge from the eggs in about three months, having no aquatic stage, like many other salamander species. They instead develop directly into their entirely terrestrial adult form. Maturity is not reached for two to three years.

Origins To counter the critic of the Great Western Railway (GWR) actually standing for \\"The Great Way Round\\", the GWR started a series of straightening projects between London Paddington and its two major hubs of Taunton and Birmingham. It hence sponsored the Birmingham and North Warwickshire Railway to create a more direct route between south Birmingham and Stratford-upon-Avon, which would bypass the existing route via Lapworth, effectively creating the last mainline railway built in the United Kingdom. The line also provided a new service to Henley-in-Arden, rendering redundant the original GWR branch from Rowington Junction to Henley, which consequently closed to passengers in 1915. History =GWR: TYS/174= The North Warwickshire Line came into operation from 1908, and the GWR immediately adopted it and ran all services. However, its major depot in the area was at Wolverhampton (Stafford Road), and so it needed a facility south of Birmingham. Its existing locomotive depot at Bordesley was too small, and so land was acquired to build a G.J. Churchward-style twin-turntable layout depot, allowing for extension towards the Warwick Road for two further turntables should the need arise. The east turntable was nominally allocated to passenger locomotives, the west to freight classes. A standard twin-track ramped coal stage was built in between the entrance roads to the roundhouses, above which was a water softening facility, and associated water tank which stored to supply the entire site. On the west side was a large repair depot which became known as \\"The Factory\\", equipped with heavy lifting gear and full engineering facilities to repair and completely overhaul any GWR locomotive. To the east were a series of carriage sidings and maintenance sheds. The final facility which opened in July 1908, was similar in design to other large GWR depot facilities, such as the original four turntable layout at Old Oak Common. The twin turntables gave access to 28 roads each of varying length, each with an inspection pit, in total capable of accommodation up to thirty- six tender engines and twenty-eight tank engines. Most major express trains ran north and terminated or changed engines at Birmingham Snow Hill or Wolverhampton, making access to Wolverhampton (Stafford Road) TMD easier and quicker. Hence Tyseley always played second fiddled to its major regional sister shed, its allocation mostly made up of tank engines and freight locomotives. Allocated 72 engines on opening in 1908, it fulfilled both local services as well as those heading south from Tyseley South Junction and Bearley to Stratford, Cheltenham, Gloucester, Bristol, South Wales and the West Country. The GWR shed code was TYS. =British Railways: 84E= GWR Class'5101' 4155 at Tyseley MPD in 1964 Post nationalisation in 1948, locomotive numbers rose till by the mid-1950s there were 100 engines allocated, a mix of former GWR, LMS and new BR Standard designs. In 1957 Diesel Multiple Units were introduced by the Western Region of British Railways, which covered the Birmingham area suburban and local services. A new DMU depot was developed on the extreme west of the site beyond the Factory. This marked the height of the depot, and beyond this point much of the site was in decline, in part as from 1963 the depot became allocated to the London Midland Region. In the same year the freight turntable and covering shed were demolished, followed in 1964 by the Factory, on top of which a new diesel repair facility was built. The GWR roots of the depot survived until the end, with the last allocated steam locomotives being three Pannier tanks that worked the Hawne Basin on the Dudley Canal from Halesowen railway station, until 1967. When British Railways allocated depot codes in 1949 (based on the former LMS system), Western Region depots were numbered between 81 and 89, and Tyseley was given the code 84E. Following transfer to the London Midland Region, the depot was given the code 2A in September 1963. =British Rail= In 1987, the depot had an allocation including Class 08 shunting locomotives and Classes 101, 108, 115, 116, 118, 119, 121, 122, 127 and 128 DMUs. The depot was also a stabling point for Class 20s and Class 47s. Tyseley Locomotive Works National Railway Museum-preserved LMS Princess Coronation Class No.6229 Duchess of Hamilton at Tyseley Locomotive Works. The preserved original GWR coaling stage is visible in the background With the demise of steam on BR in the summer of 1968, the passenger roundhouse was demolished in the same year, with plans to do similar to the coal stage. However, Patrick Whitehouse the new owner of No.7029 Clun Castle negotiated a lease bid, with plans to adapt it for steam locomotives. This and the fact that Birmingham City Council placed a preservation order on the turntable managed to create a strip of land inside the depot, that today is the Tyseley Locomotive Works. Present Tyseley traincare depot, showing London Midland second generation Class 150 Sprinter (left) and the later Class 170 Turbostar (right) Assigned to Central Trains and later Maintrain, it was also used as the scrapyard for Class 310s in 2004/05. Currently operated by West Midlands Trains (WMT), the depot serves as a servicing point for its DMU Class 172 Turbostar under the depot code is TS. The depot is also used by some CrossCountry High Speed Trains, Class 170 Turbostar, Class 220 Voyager and Class 221 Super Voyager trains due to its convenient location near their central hub, . Incidents In December 2019, a driver died after being caught between two trains that another driver was attempting to couple.

Adam Savage wired the electronics and control systems. Blendo had the first effective implementation of the full-body kinetic energy spinner weapon that became common in Robot Wars. The robot had a shell made from a wok and was spun by a lawnmower engine. Blades attached to the shell caused damage to its opponents, removing bodywork and in some instances causing them to be thrown over the polycarbonate safety shields into the audience. Combat performance =Robot Wars= Blendo first competed in the second Robot Wars competition in San Francisco (1995). After two fights (against robots Namreko and DoMore) it was deemed too hazardous to compete by the event supervisors and the insurance company after throwing pieces of its opponents over the arena walls. It was given co-champion status in exchange for withdrawing from the competition.'Gearheads' by Brad Stone, It returned in the fourth Robot Wars in 1997 after the height of the arena walls had been increased to prevent debris from reaching the audience. In this competition, Blendo again fought two robots (Hercules and Punjar), and quickly defeated both. After causing damage to the arena walls in both matches Blendo was again asked to withdraw in exchange for co-champion status. =BattleBots= Blendo would later compete in a total of four BattleBots competitions. However, Blendo had little success in BattleBots. A combination of a stronger arena design capable of containing the energy Blendo released, stronger robots able to take multiple hits from Blendo, multiple copycat designs, and Blendo's own tendency to tear itself apart caused it to be defeated in its first match in all four BattleBots events in which it competed. =After BattleBots= Blendo's creators Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage went on to host the Discovery Channel series MythBusters, which also featured fellow combat robot competitor Grant Imahara and his robot, Deadblow.

The seeds, grown from plantlike pods, replace sleeping people with perfect physical duplicates with all the same knowledge, memories, scars, etc. but are incapable of human emotion or feeling. The human victims disappear forever. The duplicates live only five years and cannot sexually reproduce; consequently, if unstopped, they will quickly turn Earth into a dead planet and move on to the next world. One of the duplicate invaders claims this is what humans do ‚Äì use up resources, wipe out indigenous populations, and destroy ecosystems in the name of survival. The novel has been adapted for the screen four times; the first film, Invasion of the Body Snatchers in 1956, the second in 1978, the third in 1993, and the fourth in 2007. It was also the basis of the 1998 movie The Faculty. Unlike the first three film adaptations, which elected for darker, far more dystopian narratives, the novel contains an optimistic ending, with the aliens voluntarily vacating after deciding that they cannot tolerate the type of resistance they see in the main characters and leaving behind a small population of duplicates who are all hunted and killed shortly after. Critical reception In 1967, Damon Knight criticized the novel's scientific incoherence: Under Jack Finney's entry in The Science Fiction Encyclopedia, John Clute remarks concerning the novel: Galaxy reviewer Groff Conklin faulted the original edition, declaring that \\"Too many s-f novels lack outstanding originality, but this one lacks it to an outstanding degree.\\" F&SF; reviewer Anthony Boucher found it to be \\"intensely readable and unpredictably ingenious\\" despite noticeable inconsistencies and its sometimes lack of scientific accuracy.

These gift vehicles are commonly based on United States tax law, but Canada, the United Kingdom, and other nations are beginning to establish similar laws. In the United States the specific rules of planned giving are defined by the United States Congress and the Internal Revenue Service. History and etymology The term \\"planned giving\\" was coined years ago by Robert F. Sharpe: \\"A donor usually considers a current gift to your institution as a cash outlay now. To make a deferred gift, a person decides to give at some future date, either a number of years from now or at death. A deferred gift is a present decision to make a future gift, evidenced by a legal contract. \\"While the name 'deferred giving' is best known to professionals in the field, it is not a term that communicates very much to the average donor. Therefore, we suggest the term 'planned giving.' When a person makes a planned gift, it suggests forethought.\\" ‚ÄîGive & Take, a publication of the Sharpe Group, August 1972 =Education= The use of planned giving by colleges and universities was pioneered by Allen Hawley at Pomona College. In 1942, Hawley introduced what became known as the Pomona Plan, where members receive a lifetime annuity in exchange for donating to the college upon their death. The plan's model has since been adopted by many other institutions, although the annuity rates offered by Pomona remain among the highest. Usage Planned gifts are referred to as such because they require more planning, negotiation and counsel than many other gifts. Planned gifts can result in immediate income, income to charity over time or serve to delay a gift for life or other period of time while the donor or others retain income and/or access to the assets used to fund the gift. Because of the current or future charitable benefits, a number of state and/or federal income tax, capital gains, estate and gift benefits are associated with giving in this way. Parents who have a child with a disability should ensure that the inheritance they leave for their child does not affect their child's eligibility to social assistance programs such as the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP). A Henson trust can be useful to ensure this. Efforts to encourage planned gifts are popular among thousands of colleges, universities, hospitals, museums and community foundations in the United States. Funds generated through planned gifts are devoted to current funding needs as well as capital projects and endowments. Reports published during and after the Great Depression of the 1930s indicate that planned gifts provided a higher percentage of philanthropic dollars than in times of economic prosperity. See \\"Philanthropy in Uncertain Times - A Retrospective 1931-1949\\" and \\"Summary of Recent Research on Depression Giving,\\" from the Sharpe Group. Research shows that planned giving may become considerably more important as a type of philanthropy in the United States due to the aging Baby Boomer population. This is often referred to as the \\"Great Wealth Transfer.\\" See \\"Philanthropy's Missing Trillions in the Stanford Social Innovation Review. Types of planned gifts By far, the most commonly utilized planned gift is the bequest of property through a person's final will. Other types include: *Charitable bargain sale *Charitable Gift Annuity (CGA) *Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust (CRAT) *Charitable Remainder Unitrust (CRUT) *Charitable remainder trust *Charitable lead annuity trust *Charitable lead trust *Donor Managed Investment Account *Pooled income fund *Retained life estate *Testamentary life income Assets to give *Securities *Business Interests *Cash *Life insurance *Personal property *Real estate *Retirement plan References *Marrick, Peter. 2009.

It was founded in 1914 in Indianapolis to build high-performance automobiles that would be used in the brothers' own pursuit of glory at the Indianapolis 500. An early investor was former world-class cyclist and Flint, Michigan-based industrialist Albert Champion, who left the venture soon after almost being beaten to death by Louis Chevrolet in an argument. Gaston Chevrolet won the 1920 Indianapolis 500 in a Frontenac, but died a few months later in a late-season race in Los Angeles in November 1920; he had already accumulated enough points to posthumously win the championship. In 1921, Frontenac won the Indy 500 again, this time at the hands of Tommy Milton, and the brothers' promising company entered into a deal with Stutz Motor Company.

She was a daughter of Valdemar I of Denmark and Sofia of Minsk. Marriage Ingeborg was married to Philip II Augustus of France on 15 August 1193 after the death of Philip's first wife Isabelle of Hainaut (d. 1190). Her marriage brought a large dowry from her brother King Canute VI of Denmark. Stephen of Tournai described her as \\"very kind, young of age but old of wisdom.\\" At the marriage, she was renamed Isambour. On the day after his marriage to Ingeborg, King Philip changed his mind, wished to obtain a separation and attempted to send her back to Denmark. Outraged, Ingeborg fled to a convent in Soissons, from where she protested to Pope Celestine III. Three months after the wedding, Philip summoned an ecclesiastical council in Compi√®gne and had it draw a false family tree to show that he and Ingeborg would have been related through Philip's first wife. Contemporary Canon law stated that a man and a woman could not marry if they shared an ancestor within the last seven generations. The council therefore declared the marriage void. Ingeborg protested again and the Danes sent a delegation to meet Pope Celestine III. They convinced him that the spurious family tree was false but the pope merely declared the annulment invalid and prohibited Philip from marrying again. Philip ignored the Pope's verdict. Ingeborg spent the next 20 years in virtual imprisonment in various French castles. In one stage she spent more than a decade in the castle of √âtampes southwest of Paris. Her brother Knud VI and his advisers continually worked against the annulment. Contemporary sources also indicate that many of Philip's advisers in France supported Ingeborg. Political reasons for this royal marriage are disputed, but Philip probably wanted to gain better relations with Denmark because the countries had been on different sides in the schism of the future succession to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire. Possibly he also wanted more allies against the rival Angevin dynasty. As a dowry, he had asked for the support of the Danish fleet for a year and the right to any remaining claims Denmark had to the throne of England. Ingeborg's brother Knud VI agreed only to a dowry of 10.000 silver marks. Marriage had been negotiated through Philip's adviser Bernard of Vincennes and Guillaume, the abbot of the Danish monastery of √Übelholt. A page from the psalter of Ingeborg of Denmark Her defence Pope Celestine defended the Queen, but was able to do little for her. Indeed, Philip asked Pope Celestine III for an annulment on the grounds of non- consummation ‚Äúper maleficium,‚Äù impotence caused by sorcery. (Historians have presented many theories for the alleged lack of consummation from temporary impotence to bouts of sweating sickness). Philip had not reckoned with Ingeborg, however; she insisted that the marriage had been consummated, and that she was his wife and the rightful Queen of France. The Franco-Danish churchman William of √Übelholt (c. 1127 ‚Äì 1203) intervened in the case of Philip Augustus who was attempting to repudiate Ingeborg. The genealogy of the Danish kings which William drew up on this occasion to disprove the alleged impediment of consanguinity and two books of his letters, some of which deal with this affair, have come down to us. Philip married Agnes of Merania in June 1196. However, in 1198 new Pope Innocent III declared that this new marriage was void because the previous marriage was still valid. He ordered Philip to dismiss Agnes and take Ingeborg back. Ingeborg had written to him, stating abuse and isolation and claiming thoughts of suicide because of harsh treatment. Philip's response was to lock Ingeborg away in the Ch√¢teau d'√âtampes in Essonne. Locked up in a tower, Ingeborg was a prisoner. Food was irregular and sometimes insufficient. No one was allowed to visit her, except for one occasion when two Danish chaplains were allowed to visit. Le Ch√¢teau (L√©on Guibourg√©, √âtampes, ville royale, 1957, pp. 227-230) Philip, meanwhile, brought Agnes back, and continued to live with her, producing a second child, a son. For these offences, Philip was excommunicated in 1200, and the kingdom was placed under an interdict. When the king did not comply, Pope Innocent III placed France under interdict in 1199 until September 1200 when Philip said he would obey. He later reneged on that promise. Agnes died the following year. In 1201 Philip asked the Pope to declare his children legitimate and the Pope complied to gain his political support. However, later that year Philip again asked for an annulment, claiming that Ingeborg had tried to bewitch him in the wedding night and thus made him unable to consummate the marriage. So he asked for divorce on the grounds of witchcraft. This attempt failed as well. Reconciliation and later life Philip reconciled with Ingeborg in 1213, not out of altruism but because he wished to press his claims to the throne of the Kingdom of England through his ties to the Danish crown. Later, on his deathbed in 1223, he is said to have told his son Louis VIII to treat her well. Later both Louis VIII and Louis IX acknowledged Ingeborg as a legitimate queen. After this time, Ingeborg spent most of her time in a priory of Saint- Jean-de-l‚ÄôIle which she had founded. It was close to Corbeil on an island in Essonne. She survived her husband by more than 14 years. Ingeborg of Denmark died in either 1237 or 1238 and was buried in the Church of the Order of St John in Corbeil (√âglise de l'ordre de Saint-Jean √† Corbeil).

Released on December 22, 1978, it is a remake of the 1956 film of the same name, which is based on the 1955 novel The Body Snatchers by Jack Finney. The plot involves a San Francisco health inspector and his colleague who discover that humans are being replaced by alien duplicates; each is a perfect copy of the person replaced, only devoid of human emotion. Released in the United States over the Christmas weekend 1978, Invasion of the Body Snatchers grossed nearly $25 million at the American box office. It initially received varied reviews from critics, though its critical reception has significantly improved in subsequent years, receiving a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes and also being hailed as one of the greatest remakes ever as well as one of the best science-fiction horror films of all time. Plot A race of gelatinous creatures, having abandoned their dying planet and traveled to Earth, land in San Francisco. They infiltrate Earth's ecosystem, latching onto plantlife and taking the form of small pods with fragrant pink flowers. Elizabeth Driscoll, a laboratory scientist at the San Francisco Health Department, brings one of the flowers home, where she lives with her boyfriend Geoffrey. Leaving the flower on their bedside table, she awakens the next morning to discover Geoffrey now behaving strangely cold and distant. Elizabeth's colleague, Matthew Bennell, advises her to visit his psychiatrist friend David Kibner, who is holding a book- signing party to promote his new self-help book. As Elizabeth and Matthew drive to the bookstore, a hysterical man warns them of danger and shouts \\"They're coming! You'll be next!\\" before being chased away by a mob of people and then hit by a car. The mob watch his death without any emotion. At the bookstore, Elizabeth asks Kibner for help regarding Geoffrey, but he theorizes that Elizabeth is simply using the belief that Geoffrey is behaving differently as an excuse to end their relationship. Despite other people complaining of similar scenarios, she takes his advice. Meanwhile, Matthew's friend Jack Bellicec calls Matthew to investigate when a grotesque body covered in fibres which resembles Jack is found in his wife Nancy's mud baths. Sensing danger with these odd occurrences, Matthew goes to Elizabeth to warn her. After breaking into her house, he finds Elizabeth in a deep sleep but also discovers a semi-formed duplicate of her in the bedroom. Suspecting Geoffrey's involvement, Matthew takes Elizabeth home with him, but when he returns later with the police, the duplicate body is gone. The following night, Matthew and his friends are nearly duplicated as they sleep, by four pods in Matthew's garden. The aliens gestate inside the pods which grow to around three feet (about 1 m) in length before breaking open and spawning a human duplicate that grows rapidly. The pods duplicate any humans while they are sleeping in the immediate vicinity, copying not just their physical characteristics but their memories too. Once the duplication is complete, the original human dies and disintegrates and the alien \\"pod person\\" takes their place. Matthew calls the police, but realizes that the department has been infiltrated. They have also begun tracking him through the phone lines, alerting others to the group's location. Matthew destroys his own semi-formed duplicate before escaping with the others, pursued by the aliens who emit a shrill scream when they discover a human being among them, drawing other aliens nearby. Cornered at a dead end road, Jack and Nancy break away and create a distraction, allowing Matthew and Elizabeth to hide and eventually escape back into the city. There, the pair takes refuge in the health department, where they each ingest a large dose of Speed, keeping them awake for several more hours. Again tracked through the phone lines, they are soon captured by Jack and Kibner, who have been duplicated. Matthew and Elizabeth are both injected with sedatives whilst being informed of the aliens' intentions for survivability, though their previous dose of Speed enables them to escape and kill Jack‚Äôs duplicate whilst locking Kibner in a refrigerated room. Matthew and Elizabeth reunite with Nancy, who has learnt to evade the aliens by hiding her emotions and blending in with them. The two follow her example, but their cover is blown when Elizabeth screams at the sight of a mutant dog with a human head. They separate from Nancy amid the chaos and quickly board a truck en route to Pier 70, where the aliens are cultivating more pods and intending to ship them to other widely populated cities. While Matthew scouts the area in an attempt to flee aboard a vacant ship, Elizabeth falls asleep and is duplicated. Matthew returns and is horrified as her body disintegrates in his arms. Pursued by the duplicate Elizabeth, he breaks into the docks' warehouse and burns down the building, destroying hundreds of pods. He flees and hides under a bridge, exhausted, as the aliens try to find him. The next morning, Matthew returns to work at the health department and witnesses several schoolchildren being taken for duplication, while more pods are being prepared for the remaining West Coast cities.In the final scene, Matthew (Donald Sutherland) demonstrates the characteristic pose by which the \\"pod people\\" identify unconverted humans. As he heads towards City Hall, he encounters Nancy, who quietly approaches him and attempts a hushed conversation. To her horror, he points at her and emits an earsplitting shriek, having been replaced by the pods himself.

It can be a new envisioning that was a variation on a theme,' he said on the film's 40th anniversary. The first change he anticipated was filming in color; the second was changing the location to San Francisco. \\"Could it happen in the city I love the most? The city with the most advanced, progressive therapies, politics and so forth? What would happen in a place like that if the pods landed there and that element of 'poddiness' was spread?\\" Cinematographer Michael Chapman worked with Kaufman to try to capture the film noir feel of the original in color, reviewing some classics of that genre before production. Some of the things they borrowed were scenes with light giving way to shadow and shooting from unusual angles. They used certain color tinges to indicate that some characters were now pod people. \\"When they're running along the Embarcadero and the huge shadows appear first, those are sort of classic film noir images\\", the director said. Sound editor Ben Burtt, who had helped create many of the signature sounds from Star Wars the year before, also added to the film's ambience. Natural sounds that mix with the city's more industrial noises give way to just the latter as the film progresses. Among them are the grinding noises of garbage trucks, a common urban sound that slowly becomes horrific as it becomes clear that most of what they are processing is the discarded husks that remain of pre-pod human bodies. Burtt also designed the iconic shriek when pod people see a surviving human, a sound Kaufman said was composed of many elements, including a pig's squeal. All the special effects were created live for the camera. The scene at the beginning where the pods travel through space from their dead homeworld to San Francisco was one of the simplest. \\"I found some viscous material in an art store, I think we paid $12 for a big vat of it, and then [we dropped it] into solutions and reversed the film\\", Kaufman recalled. The dog with the banjo player's face, another effective moment later in the film, included a mechanism whereby the creature appeared to lick itself. The film features a number of cameo appearances. Kevin McCarthy, who played Dr. Miles Bennell in the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, makes a brief appearance as an old man frantically screaming \\"They're coming!\\" to passing cars on the street. Though not playing the same character, Kaufman meant McCarthy's cameo as a nod to the original movie, as if he had been \\"metaphorically\\" running around the country since the original film shouting out his warnings. While they were filming the scene, in the Tenderloin, Kaufman recalls that a naked man lying on the street awoke and recognized McCarthy. After learning that they were filming the remake of the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers, he told McCarthy that that film was better. \\"We were in the middle of shooting the film and we got our first review!\\" The original film's director, Don Siegel, appears as a taxi driver who alerts the police to Matthew and Elizabeth's attempt to flee the city. Robert Duvall is also seen briefly as a silent priest sitting on a swing set in the opening scene. Kaufman appears in dual roles both as a man wearing a hat who bothers Sutherland's character in a phone booth, and the voice of one of the officials Sutherland's character speaks to on the phone. His wife, Rose Kaufman, has a small role at the book party as the woman who argues with Jeff Goldblum's character. Chapman appears twice as a janitor in the health department. McCarthy and Siegel played a role in shaping the film's twist ending. Before filming, Kaufman had sought out Siegel for advice, and while the two were talking in the latter's office, McCarthy happened to come in. The topic eventually came around to the original film's ending, which they regarded as \\"pat\\". After coming up with the ending he used, he kept it a secret from everyone involved in the filming except screenwriter W.D. Richter and producer Robert Solo. Sutherland was only informed of the scene the night before shooting; Kaufman is not sure Cartwright even knew until Sutherland turned around to point and shriek at her. The studio executives only learned of it when a cut was screened for them at George Lucas's house. The film score by Denny Zeitlin was released on Perseverance Records; it is the only film score Zeitlin has composed. Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead recorded the banjo parts. Kaufman said of the casting of Nimoy, \\"Leonard had got typecast and this [film] was an attempt to break him out of that,\\" referring to the similar quirks that Dr. Kibner and his pod double had in common with Spock, the Star Trek character that Nimoy was most well known for. According to Kaufman, it was Mike Medavoy, then head of production at United Artists, who suggested the casting of Donald Sutherland. Sutherland's character had a similar curly hairstyle as that of another character he portrayed in Don't Look Now (1973). \\"They would have to set his hair with pink rollers every day\\", recalled co-star Veronica Cartwright. According to Zeitlin, Sutherland's character was originally written as an \\"avocational jazz player\\" early in development. The director encouraged his actors to fill the spaces between dialogue with facial expressions. \\"Often people on the set or at the studio are so worried about just getting content, and content is not necessarily going to make the scene full of humanity or feel compassion and amusement and humor\\", Kaufman told The Hollywood Reporter. He particularly singled out the way Adams rolls her eyes in opposite directions while she and Sutherland have dinner as something that a pod person could and would never do. Release =Box office= Invasion of the Body Snatchers premiered in the United States on December 22, 1978, showing on 445 screens nationally. Between its premiere and December 25, the film had earned a total of $1,298,129 in box office sales. It would go on to gross a total of nearly $25 million in the United States. On the film's 40th anniversary, Kaufman believes the film may have seemed timely when it came out since the Jonestown mass suicide had occurred a month earlier and still dominated the news: \\"That was a case of a lot of people from San Francisco were looking for a better world and suddenly found themselves in pod-dom, and it was fatal. It could not have been a more pointed reason for watching the movie.\\" =Critical reception= Contemporaneous The New Yorker's Pauline Kael was a particular fan of the film, writing that it \\"may be the best film of its kind ever made\\". Variety wrote that it \\"validates the entire concept of remakes. This new version of Don Siegel's 1956 cult classic not only matches the original in horrific tone and effect, but exceeds it in both conception and execution.\\" Gene Siskel gave the film three stars out of four and said it was \\"one of the more entertaining films in what has turned out to be a dismal Christmas movie season.\\"Siskel, Gene (December 22, 1978). \\"Sci-fi, romance, comedy fill the holiday bill\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 3, p. 1, 2. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"a thoroughly scary success in its own right. Not literally a remake‚Äîit's more of a sequel, actually‚Äîthis handsome, highly imaginative film generates its own implications from Finney's sturdy allegory of dehumanization and manages even to have some fun in the process.\\"Thomas, Kevin (December 21, 1978). \\"A 'Body Snatchers' That Tells All\\". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. The film was not without negative criticism. The New York Times' Janet Maslin wrote that the \\"creepiness [Kaufman] generates is so crazily ubiquitous it becomes funny.\\" Roger Ebert wrote that it \\"was said to have something to do with Watergate and keeping tabs on those who are not like you‚Äù, and called Kael's praise for the film \\"inexplicable\\", while Time magazine's Richard Schickel labeled its screenplay \\"laughably literal\\". Phil Hardy's Aurum Film Encyclopedia called Kaufman's direction \\"less sure\\" than the screenplay. The film received a nomination from the Writers Guild of America for Best Drama Adapted from Another Medium. The film was also nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. It was also recognized by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films. Philip Kaufman won Best Director, and the film was nominated Best Science Fiction Film. Donald Sutherland, Brooke Adams, and Leonard Nimoy received additional nominations for their performances. Subsequent assessment Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978) has been named among the greatest film remakes ever made, by several publications, including Rolling Stone. Film scholar M. Keith Booker posited that the film's \\"paranoid atmosphere\\" links it to other films outside the science fiction genre, and that it \\"bears a clear family resemblance to paranoid conspiracy thrillers like Alan J. Pakula's The Parallax View (1974).\\" Chris Barsanti, in The Sci-Fi Movie Guide (2014), praised the performances of Adams and Sutherland, but criticized some elements of the film, writing: \\"The subtlety of Donald Siegel's original gives way to gaudy f/x and self-consciously artsy camerawork ... the film is overindulgently long, too, though it certainly has its shocking moments.\\" On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received an approval rating of 93% based on 57 reviews, with an average rating of 8.2/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Employing gritty camerawork and evocative sound effects, Invasion of the Body Snatchers is a powerful remake that expands upon themes and ideas only lightly explored in the original.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews.\\" In a 2018 review published by Complex, the film was ranked among the greatest science fiction films of all time: \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers is doubly impressive; it both improves upon the '56 film and Jack Finney's literary source material with a scarier disposition and more layered character development.\\" =Home video= Invasion of the Body Snatchers was released on DVD in the United States, Australia and many European countries. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in the United States in 2010 and in the United Kingdom in 2013 by MGM Home Entertainment. Then released once more on Blu-ray by Shout! Factory in the United States and Canada in 2016. This release contains a 2K scan of the interpositive. Legacy The Chicago Film Critics Association named it the 59th scariest film ever made.

The expression of the (local) virial stress can be derived as the functional derivative of the free energy of a molecular system with respect to the deformation tensor.Morante, S., G. C. Rossi, and M. Testa. \\"The stress tensor of a molecular system: An exercise in statistical mechanics.\\" The Journal of chemical physics 125.3 (2006): 034101, http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.2214719.  Volume averaged Definition  The instantaneous volume averaged virial stress is given by :\\\\tau_{ij} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Omega} \\\\sum_{k \\\\in \\\\Omega} \\\\left(-m^{(k)} (u_i^{(k)}- \\\\bar{u}_i) (u_j^{(k)}- \\\\bar{u}_j) + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\Omega} ( x_i^{(\\\\ell)} - x_i^{(k)}) f_j^{(k\\\\ell)}\\\\right) where * k and \\\\ell are atoms in the domain, * \\\\Omega is the volume of the domain, * m^{(k)} is the mass of atom k, * u_i^{(k)} is the ith component of the velocity of atom k, * \\\\bar{u}_j is the jth component of the average velocity of atoms in the volume, * x_i^{(k)} is the ith component of the position of atom k, and * f_i^{(k\\\\ell)} is the ith component of the force applied on atom k by atom \\\\ell. At zero kelvin, all velocities are zero so we have :\\\\tau_{ij} = \\\\frac{1}{2\\\\Omega} \\\\sum_{k,\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\Omega} ( x_i^{(\\\\ell)} - x_i^{(k)}) f_j^{(k\\\\ell)}. This can be thought of as follows. The œÑ11 component of stress is the force in the x1-direction divided by the area of a plane perpendicular to that direction. Consider two adjacent volumes separated by such a plane. The 11-component of stress on that interface is the sum of all pairwise forces between atoms on the two sides. The volume averaged virial stress is then the ensemble average of the instantaneous volume averaged virial stress. In a three dimensional, isotropic system, at equilibrium the \\"instantaneous\\" atomic pressure is usually defined as the average over the diagonals of the negative stress tensor: :\\\\mathcal{P}_{at} = -\\\\frac{1}{3}Tr(\\\\tau). The pressure then is the ensemble average of the instantaneous pressure :P_{at} =\\\\langle \\\\mathcal{P}_{at} \\\\rangle. This pressure is the average pressure in the volume \\\\Omega. =Equivalent Definition = It's worth noting that some articles and textbook use a slightly different but equivalent version of the equation :\\\\tau_{ij} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Omega} \\\\sum_{k \\\\in \\\\Omega} \\\\left(-m^{(k)} (u_i^{(k)}- \\\\bar{u}_i) (u_j^{(k)}- \\\\bar{u}_j) - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\Omega} x_i^{(k\\\\ell)} f_j^{(k\\\\ell)}\\\\right) where x_i^{(k\\\\ell)} is the ith component of the vector oriented from the \\\\ellth atoms to the kth calculated via the difference x_i^{k\\\\ell} = x_i^{(k)} - x_i^{(\\\\ell)} Both equation being strictly equivalent, the definition of the vector can still lead to confusion. = Derivation = The virial pressure can be derived, using the virial theorem and splitting forces between particles and the container or, alternatively, via direct application of the defining equation P=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial F(N,V,T)}{\\\\partial V} and using scaled coordinates in the calculation.  Inhomogeneous Systems  If the system is not homogeneous in a given volume the above (volume averaged) pressure is not a good measure for the pressure. In inhomogeneous systems the pressure depends on the position and orientation of the surface on which the pressure acts. Therefore, in inhomogeneous systems a definition of a local pressure is needed.Numerical Simulations of a Smectic Lamellar Phase of Amphiphilic Molecules, p. 40, https://books.google.de/books?id=rPpegGthzO4C&lpg;=PA40&dq;=local%20pressure%20tensor&hl;=de&pg;=PA40#v=onepage&q;=local%20pressure%20tensor&f;=false As a general example for a system with inhomogeneous pressure you can think of the pressure in the atmosphere of the earth which varies with height.

Lee Ermey, and Forest Whitaker. It is loosely based on the 1955 novel The Body Snatchers by Jack Finney, with a screenplay by Nicholas St. John, Stuart Gordon, and Dennis Paoli. Body Snatchers is the third film adaptation of Finney's novel, the first being Invasion of the Body Snatchers in 1956, followed by a remake of the same name in 1978. The plot is centered around the discovery that people working at a military base in Alabama are being replaced by perfect physical imitations grown from plantlike pods. The duplicates are indistinguishable from normal people except for their utter lack of emotion. Plot Steve Malone, an agent from the Environmental Protection Agency, is sent to a military base in Alabama to test possible effects on the surrounding ecological system caused by military actions. With him is his teenage daughter from his first marriage, Marti, his second wife Carol, and Marti's half brother Andy. On their way to the base, they stop at a gas station. In the restroom, Marti is threatened by an MP member with a knife. When he notices her fear, he lets go of her, satisfied that she shows an emotional response. Before she leaves the room, he warns her, \\"they get you when you sleep\\". Steve and his family move into their new home on the base, and Marti makes friends with the base commander's daughter Jenn. On his first day in day care, Andy runs away because he is recognized as an outsider among the other somehow conformist children. He is picked up and brought home by helicopter pilot Tim. Marti and Tim quickly feel attracted to each other. Meanwhile, while examining soil samples, Steve is approached by medical officer Major Collins, who asks him about psychological effects, particularly narcophobia (the fear of sleep), and their possible relation to toxication of the environment. Steve believes that a physiological reaction would be more likely. In the evening, Marti and Jenn go to the bar attended by the station's military personnel, where they meet not only Tim but also the MP who threatened Marti at the gas station. He denies that they ever met before. That night, a group of soldiers can be seen picking giant pods from the river running by the base. When Andy wakes up and enters his mother's room, Carol's body crumbles to dust, while a naked soulless double emerges from the closet. Nobody believes Andy's story that his real mother is dead and the person pretending to be Carol is only an impostor. The following night, Marti and her father are nearly \\"taken over\\" too by duplicates emerging from the giant pods. Carol attempts to convince Steve that the takeover is a good thing, claiming that it ends confusion and anger. She also claims that there's no place to go, as the events at the base are not an isolated incident. Steve is almost shocked and saddened into compliance, but Marti and Andy drag him out the door. Carol emits a shrill and mechanical scream that alerts other \\"pod people\\" to the presence of a human being. Now the majority in numbers, they swarm over the base chasing the remaining humans. After hiding Marti and Andy in a warehouse, Steve enters Major Collins' office. The hysterical Major tries to call for help, but the line is blocked. While swallowing sleep-prevention pills Collins announces that it is too late to run; all they can do is fight. Their conversation is interrupted by the arrival of a group of pod people, led by base commander General Platt. While Steve hides, the pod people try to convince the Major that the individual is not important, and that only conformity can solve the world's problems. The Major shoots himself rather than live in such a world. Steve returns to his children and tells them to follow him, claiming to have found a way out. They drive aimlessly through the military base, as loudspeakers shout out instructions for spreading the invasion by carrying out pods in trucks. Realizing that her father was replicated while he was away, Marti swerves the car to the side and tries to escape with her brother. Tim, who escaped his former comrades who tried to turn him into one of them, suddenly appears and Marti takes his gun and shoots the Steve duplicate. Pod Steve's body shrinks into a mass of seething, bloody goo. Tim manages to get hold of a helicopter gunship, but Marti and Andy are taken away by the pod people. They sedate both of them and take them to the base infirmary where the remaining human beings are being systematically duplicated by pods. Tim is able to rescue Marti, despite her pod duplicate trying to seduce him into compliance. Incomplete, it dies when he pulls its connecting tendrils off Marti. Marti and Tim leave the building, pretending to be pod people so they can get to Tim's helicopter to escape. However, they are spotted by Jenn, now a pod duplicate, who gets suspicious and tells Marti she saw Andy looking for her. When Marti reacts by displaying emotion, Jenn responds by giving out a pod scream to alert the other pod people. Tim and Marti manage to get in the helicopter and are joined at the last minute by Andy who runs up to them. But right after taking off, Andy, who is actually a pod duplicate, attacks both and tries to bring down the helicopter. After a short scuffle, a heartbroken Marti is forced to throw Pod-Andy out of the helicopter and he gives out a pod scream while falling to his death. The ending of the film is an ambiguous one. Tim destroys the trucks filled with pods with the helicopter's rockets, while Marti confesses her profound hatred in a voice-over narration, thereby hinting at a loss of humanitarian quality. While they land on another base, the words of Marti's replaced stepmother earlier in the film can be heard, suggesting that the phenomenon may have already spread beyond the army base: \\"Where you gonna go, where you gonna run, where you gonna hide? Nowhere... 'cause there's no one like you left.\\" Cast * Gabrielle Anwar as Marti Malone * Terry Kinney as Steve Malone *Billy Wirth as Tim Young *Meg Tilly as Carol Malone *Reilly Murphy as Andy Malone *Christine Elise as Jenn Platt *R. Lee Ermey as General Platt *Forest Whitaker as Major Matthew Collins *Kathleen Doyle as Diana Platt *G. Elvis Phillips as Pete *Tonea Stewart as Mrs. Fitzpatrick Background info Warner Brothers released Body Snatchers to only a few dozen theaters, and consequently its domestic gross was a mere $428,868.Body Snatchers in the Internet Movie Database. The film marked director Ferrara's first venture into the science fiction genre. Producer Robert H. Solo had already produced its 1978 predecessor Invasion of the Body Snatchers. The largest difference in this version of the story is that it takes place on an Army base in Alabama, unlike a small California town in the original novel and the first adaptation filmed in 1956, or in San Francisco like in the 1978 remake. While the first two films portrayed the tightly organised, conformist \\"pod society\\" invading a free civil society, Ferrara's film, according to Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert, made a connection between \\"the Army's code of rigid conformity, and the behavior of the pod people, who seem like a logical extension of the same code\\". Body Snatchers is the film which departs the farthest from the original novel, compared to the 1956 and 1978 versions. While Steve Malone, like the doctors Bennell in the earlier films, also has a medical/scientific profession, the main character in this film is his daughter Marti. The character of Becky/Elizabeth (Bennell's love interest and his companion during his escape attempt from the invaders) is dropped completely, as are Bennell's acquaintances and later antagonists Dr. Kaufman/Kibner and the Belicecs. Re- invented, however, are two elements which had been dropped from the 1978 version: A young boy (named Jimmy Grimaldi in the 1956 version, here Marti's half brother Andy) claims that his mother is not his \\"real\\" mother. Also, the film features a voice-over narration by the main character. Two ideas invented by the 1978 version are picked up here again: The mortal remains of the \\"original\\" human beings are picked up by garbage trucks, and the duplicates utter an outworldly scream when they discover a genuine human, thereby calling assistance from other pod people. Reception Body Snatchers was shown in competition at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, receiving very positive reviews from some critics. Roger Ebert considered it superior to the previous adaptations of Finney's famous novel and in his review (February 25, 1994) gave it four stars out of four, praising it for psychological realism and social criticism. Ebert stated \\"as sheer moviemaking, it is skilled and knowing, and deserves the highest praise you can give a horror film: It works\\". Nick Shager of the horror film review site Lessons of Darkness said in his 2006 review of the film, \\"this economical horror show still offers a few stunning moments of paranoia-laced terror\\". Blake Davis of KFOR Channel 4 News said of the film: \\"One of the creepiest and most overlooked horror movies made in the past decade, featuring a strong, scary turn by Meg Tilly\\". However, some critics panned the film ‚Äî Richard Harrington of The Washington Post' (February 18, 1994) called it \\"a soulless replica of Don Siegel's 1956 model and Philip Kaufman's 1978 update\\". Owen Gleiberman noted in Entertainment Weekly (February 11, 1994), \\"[the] notion of a military base as a symbol of mindless conformity isn't exactly revelatory, and the characters remain sketchy and underdeveloped.\\" Based on 29 reviews, the film holds a 69% on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 6.2 out of 10. The site's critics' consensus states: \\"Body Snatchers may not topple previous adaptions, but it boasts an effective sense of dread and strong characterizations.\\"  Year-end lists  * Top 3 \\"Best in-your-face exploitation\\" (not ranked) ‚Äì Glenn Lovell, San Jose Mercury News * Dishonorable mention ‚Äì William Arnold, Seattle Post- Intelligencer See also *List of science fiction horror films *List of American films of 1993 References  Further reading * Tibbetts, John C., and James M.

Its depot code is CF. It is operated by Transport for Wales. The depot is used by Transport for Wales fleet and some Cross Country class 170s. In steam days the depot was called Cardiff Canton and its shed code was 86C. It was built in 1882 as the main maintenance base for the South Wales Railway and the major Welsh engineering base for the Great Western Railway (GWR). After nationalisation in 1948 it was a heavy overhaul base for British Railways. After privatisation in the mid-1990s the depot became a joint Arriva Trains Wales and English Welsh & Scottish facility. The EWS depot closed as a maintenance centre from 10 December 2005, but EWS' successor DB Cargo UK still uses the depot for long term storage and occasional stabling. History =Steam= Former GWR steam locomotives at Canton in 1951 Cardiff Canton was opened in June 1882 as a six road, -long shed, built to replace Long Dyke, east of Cardiff General station. The GWR enlarged the depot in 1897 with a -diameter turntable installed in a square locomotive shed with 28 roads radiating of off the turntable. In 1925 the GWR added a locomotive repair and lifting shed and a new coaling stage. In 1931 the original -turntable was removed and replaced by a larger -diameter one at the west end of the yard. At this time, around the peak of GWR operation, the depot had allocated 50 main line passenger locomotives, 40 heavy goods/mineral locomotives and 30 smaller local passenger/goods and shunting locomotives. Steam traction at the depot ceased on 8 September 1962. =Diesel= BR diesel locomotives at Canton in the 1980s In the winter of 1962‚Äì63, Kyle Stewart contracted to build for British Railways a new ¬£1,324,000 complex on a site. Lord Brecon, Minister of State for Welsh Affairs, opened the new depot on 18 September 1964. The original allocation was 360 locomotives for major maintenance, 197 for normal maintenance and 62 shunting locomotives. Employed were 40 managerial and supervisory staff, 31 clerical staff, 382 maintenance staff and 55 unskilled staff. In 1987, the depot's allocation of rolling stock included Classes 08, 37, 47, 56 and DMUs, although Classes 33 and 50 could also usually be seen at the depot.

A specialized case of hydrostatic stress, contains isotropic compressive stress, which changes only in volume, but not in shape. Pure hydrostatic stress can be experienced by a point in a fluid such as water. It is often used interchangeably with \\"pressure\\" and is also known as confining stress, particularly in the field of geomechanics. Hydrostatic stress is equivalent to the average of the uniaxial stresses along three orthogonal axes and can be calculated from the first invariant of the stress tensor: Diagram showing compressive hydrostatic stresses \\\\sigma_h = \\\\frac{I_i}{3}=\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{xx} + \\\\sigma_{yy} + \\\\sigma_{zz}}{3} Its magnitude in a fluid, \\\\sigma_h, can be given by: :\\\\sigma_h = \\\\displaystyle\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\rho_i g h_i where i is an index denoting each distinct layer of material above the point of interest, \\\\rho_i is the density of each layer, g is the gravitational acceleration (assumed constant here; this can be substituted with any acceleration that is important in defining weight), and h_i is the height (or thickness) of each given layer of material. For example, the magnitude of the hydrostatic stress felt at a point under ten meters of fresh water would be :\\\\sigma_h = \\\\rho_w g h_w =1000 \\\\,\\\\text{kg m}^{-3} \\\\cdot 9.8 \\\\,\\\\text{m s}^{-2} \\\\cdot 10 \\\\,\\\\text{m} =9.8 \\\\cdot {10^4} \\\\text{ kg m}^{-1} \\\\text{s}^{-2} =9.8 \\\\cdot 10^4 \\\\text{ N m}^{-2} where the index w indicates \\"water\\".

After appearing before an all party committee on petroleum pricing, the Nova Scotia legislature passed Bill 79 The Nova Scotia Petroleum Products Pricing Act. After a year of not proclaiming it law, Rodney MacDonald, the Premier of Nova Scotia announced in May 2006 that petroleum prices will be regulated, beginning on 1 July 2006, two weeks following New Brunswick's announcement of doing the same.

This plus a 6 cent per litre wholesale margin, plus a transportation allowance of 0.5 to 2 cents per litre, and a retail margin of 4 to 5.5 cents per litre (or to a maximum of 7.5 cents per litre for full-serve gasoline). =Zones= The transportation of the product is calculated based on six zones in Nova Scotia: *Zone 1 - Halifax Regional Municipality, Hants County and southern Colchester County - 0.5 cents per litre *Zone 2 - Lunenburg, Kings and Eastern Annapolis counties, - 1 cent per litre. *Zone 3 - Western Annapolis, Digby, Yarmouth, Shelburne, and Queens counties - 1.4 cents per litre. *Zone 4 - Cumberland County - 1.5 cents per litre *Zone 5 - Northern Colchester, Pictou, Antigonish, and Guysborough counties, and the Port Hastings - Port Hawkesbury area of Inverness County - 1.5 cents per litre. *Zone 6 - the remainder of Inverness County, Richmond County, Victoria County, and Cape Breton Regional Municipality - 2 cents per litre. =Taxes= *Federal Excise Tax - 10 cents for Gasoline 6 Cents for Diesel *Nova Scotia Road Tax - 15.5 cents *Harmonized Sales Tax 15% of the total of the above (about 3 cents per 20 cents per litre) Notice There is no notice of change in prices. Every Friday, prices may go up or down or stay the same, depending on the market price over the past 7 days. Interrupter and Price Changes Scheduled price changes occur every second Thursday starting 13 July 2006. The interrupter is based on a formula that will determine whether the market prices of fuels have changed enough to warrant a price change . This ‚Äúinterrupter‚Äù formula will run every second Wednesday beginning 19 July 2006. For the interrupter formula to trigger a price change, a 5-day average NYMEX spot price from the last price change to the current date, will be calculated. If this new average NYMEX spot price changes by ¬±4 cents per litre over the last NYMEX spot price average, used to set the scheduled price change, the pump price may be adjusted using the new average NYMEX spot price as the baseline. If the interrupter is not triggered on the interruption date, the current pump price will continue until the next price change the following Thursday. In extreme circumstances, precipitated by a weather or perhaps a geopolitical event, a catastrophic interrupter could initiated whereby international product prices change by significant amounts, say ¬±15 cents per litre. This interrupter would be initiated on the day of the price change or the next day when rack prices in Nova Scotia would change. Controversy Many critics argue that this method of controlling the price of petroleum products is not in the public interest; these critics include the Liberal Party of Nova Scotia, the Nova Scotia Chambers of Commerce, and vocal critics, mainly in the Halifax Regional Municipality, from the public at large. When this was first brought about many including in the New Democratic Party and the Retail Gasoline Dealers Association of Nova Scotia wanted a system similar to Prince Edward Island for lower prices. The ones opposing this scheme argued that the PEI system not only keeps prices higher but it does not allow for competition. The lower gasoline prices are a result of PEI's not charging the Provincial Sales Tax of 10% unlike in Nova Scotia where the Harmonized Sales Tax of 15% is charged. In New Brunswick, the HST is also charged, but they set a maximum price for most of entire province (no zones) without setting a minimum price. As a price comparison, on 1 July 2006, the same day Nova Scotia started its system, the maximum price in New Brunswick was 112.4 cents per litre for regular self serve compared to Nova Scotia's minimum price of 113.3 to 115.2 (depending on the zone) cents per litre.

The depot code was 52A during the steam era and GD later on. It was known, along with the adjacent locomotive works, as Greenesfield or Greensfield, after a Mr. Greene, from whom the North Eastern Railway (NER) bought the land . In 1958, all BR locomotive depots on Tyneside, Wearside and in Northumberland became sub-sheds of Gateshead. The depot closed in 1991. Housing now occupies the site, now known as Ochre Yards. The street names reflect the site's history, with Worsdell Drive and Fletcher Road named after former locomotive superintendents of the NER. Engine shed and infrastructure The main shed housed four turntables for most of its working life. Prior to 1908, all four turntables had been 48' 5\\", which proved to be a problem as locomotives were steadily increasing in size. However, in that same year, the Redheugh Incline was closed, thereby allowing the track running alongside the southern wall of the shed to be lifted, and an extension built to accommodate three larger 60' 0\\" turntables . In the 1920s, the arrival of large 4-6-2 \\"pacific\\" type locomotives (the Vincent Raven designed NER \\"2400\\" class which became \\"A2\\" under the LNER, and the Doncaster built Gresley \\"A1s\\" designed for the GNR), necessitated converting the adjoining locomotive works' tender shop into a shed which could accommodate them, as even the 60' turntables in the main shed were not large enough. The problem of turning these locomotives without a large enough turntable was overcome by utilising the triangular junctions at the southern ends of the High Level and King Edward VII bridges, which allowed the locomotives to perform a three-point turn in much the same way as a road vehicle. The rebuilding of the shed in the 1950s would include the provision of a 70' turntable which these locomotives could use, but this would soon become obsolete with the phasing out of steam traction under the BR 1955 Modernisation Plan. After the steam locomotives departed, the main shed at Gateshead was converted into a five-road straight shed, in which various diesels were stored and maintained. The conversion drastically altered the depot, as coaling stages and similar steam engine infrastructure gave way to diesel-related infrastructure, such as fuel tanks. One exception was the water tower at the western end of the shed, which would remain until closure . =Sub-Sheds in BR steam days= Gateshead had several sub-sheds, some of which had sub-sheds of their own. When Sunderland (which was formerly 54A) became a sub-shed of Gateshead, it, along with its own sub- sheds, received new codes with Gateshead's 52 prefix.  52B Heaton  this shed was allocated similar types of ECML locomotives as Gateshead. Heaton had (and still has) extensive carriage sidings. It would also encompass South Gosforth Car Sheds, where the Tyneside electric stock was stabled, including the NER Class ES1 shunting locomotives for the steeply graded Quayside Branch. Heaton and South Gosforth are the only surviving sheds which were sub-sheds of Gateshead, all of the others listed here are now closed. Heaton carriage sidings' ability to accommodate the fixed rakes of carriages with a power unit and Driving Van Trailer that form an HST played a major role in the decision to close Gateshead, whose cramped location between Askew Road and the Tyne offered limited scope for expansion. This was effectively the same reason that led to Gateshead being replaced by Darlington as the location of the NER's main works.  52C Blaydon  Which, by 1955, also included Hexham and Alston.  52D Tweedmouth  The northernmost extent of Gateshead's control, which included the shed at Alnmouth.  52E Percy Main  Allocated locomotives for use on the former Blyth & Tyne lines in South-East Northumberland.  52F North and South Blyth  Allocated locomotives mainly for use on the heavy mineral traffic in the Northumberland coalfield, North Blyth was at Cambois, and was later replaced by an entirely new diesel depot (Blyth Cambois TMD). The new depot closed in 1994.  52G Sunderland  (54A until 1958) - last MPD in the region with an allocation of steam locomotives, with the last examples leaving in 1967. Also included Durham, which did not have a BR shed code.  52H Tyne Dock  (54B until 1958) - provided motive power for freight workings on South Tyneside, including the iron ore workings to Consett. Also encompassed Pelton Level MPD near Stanley.  52J Borough Gardens  (54C until 1958) - later the site of Park Lane Goods Depot.  52K Consett (54D until 1958) - provided facilities for locomotives working the lines in and out of Consett, (only the former Stanhope & Tyne route remaining for traffic to and from the steelworks by 1980, when the plant finally closed) as well as being allocated snowploughs which were essential in winter due to the town's location being a high fell on the edge of the Pennines. Locomotives =Steam= The shed was home to numerous express locomotives, such as the 35 pacifics allocated in 1954. Newcastle Central station pilots and various other smaller locomotives for local passenger trains and goods workings were also based at the depot. The experimental water-tube boilered \\"W1\\" 4-6-4 No. 10000, which became known as the \\"hush-hush\\" due to the secrecy surrounding its construction, was also stabled at Gateshead before being converted into a more conventional locomotive. In BR days, the shed continued to house mainly ex-NER/LNER locomotives, the BR standard classes being somewhat conspicuous by their absence from north east lines (one exception being a modified batch of the massive \\"9Fs\\" which had been specially fitted with large Westinghouse air pumps; these locomotives were stabled at Tyne Dock shed and employed on the heavy iron ore trains to Consett Steelworks where the pumps were needed to operate the air powered doors on the large bogie ore hoppers). Gateshead also provided motive power for Dunston Staithes, to the West, which had restrictions in place regarding locomotives that could work on them, these being, in LNER and BR days, J71 and J72 0-6-0 tanks and a pair of Y3 sentinel geared locomotives affectionately known as \\"pups\\". The 0-6-0 tanks propelled loaded trains out of the Norwood Coal Yard onto top of the Staithes where the waiting pups shunted the wagons into position above the loading chutes, while the empties rolled back off the staithes under gravity and would be collected for their journey back to the colliery by an 0-8-0 from Blaydon or Borough Gardens. Bowes Bridge, which never had its own shed code, was also a sub-shed of Gateshead and was allocated a pair of N10 0-6-2 tanks for working the sections of the Tanfield Branch level enough not to require rope haulage. The last of Gateshead's steam allocation left in October 1965, with steam lingering on in a revenue-earning capacity in the north east at Sunderland MPD, a handful of industrial locations and NCB lines for a few years before being phased out altogether (although it never completely disappeared from the region, the Tanfield Railway having reopened as a preservation centre just as the last survivors of the NCB steam fleet were retired). =Diesel= Diesels on shed included the following: *Class 03 shunters *Class 08 shunters *Class 25 https://www.derbysulzers.com/gateshead.html Gateshead 52A Its allocation of BR/Sulzer Type 2's 1960 - 1974 and a whole lot more that crept into the story *Class 45 \\"peaks\\" *Class 46 \\"peaks\\" *Class 47/4s used on Trans-Pennine services *Class 55 \\"Deltics\\" used on East Coast Main Line expresses. *Class 56 After closure in 1991, the depot stood for a number of years until its last remaining resident, 08 618 (which had been loitering in the shed since being withdrawn in February 1990), was sold for scrap to TJ Thomson of Stockton-on- Tees, and cut up on site in February 2001, just before most of the buildings were demolished. Gateshead Railway Works Gateshead was, before 1910, the NER's locomotive department headquarters and main works. Part of the works occupied the former site of the original Gateshead Station, where trains from London terminated until the High Level Bridge and Newcastle Central Station opened. Gateshead Station's train shed subsequently became the works' No. 1 erecting shop (where the final assembly of the locomotives was carried out), and the hotel adjoining the station became offices. On the opposite side of the running lines, at the Eastern end of Chater's Bank sidings, a roundhouse built sometime between 1895 and 1898 served as the works' paint shop. By 1957, this was marked on the OS map as an engine shed, which suggests that locomotives from the soon to be closed Borough Gardens MPD had been transferred to Gateshead. The roundhouse is not present on OS maps from the 1960s onwards, but is visible in a video of BR freight workings in 1983Class 31, 37, 45, 46, 47 in the North East (Gateshead Depot GD) 1983 Peak Goyle, Youtube. (also visible in this video is the Gateshead Breakdown Train, the new Redheugh Bridge and its soon to be dismantled predecessor, with the similarly doomed chimneys of Dunston Power Station in the background). Locomotive production at Gateshead ceased in 1910, when production was switched to Darlington. However, the works continued to maintain and overhaul engines until they closed in 1932. The works re-opened during the Second World War to ease the pressure on Darlington for maintaining and overhauling locomotives. A new 60-ton crane was installed during this time. The works remained open until 1959, when they closed for the last time. In 1996, part of the former works was used as an exhibition space for Antony Gormley's \\"Field For The British Isles\\", consulting of 40,000 small terracotta figures. Most of the works was demolished in 2002, along with the adjacent engine sheds, although some of the buildings nearest the river have survived and have been converted into apartments. Remaining railway activity The only remaining railway activity is on the line connecting the junctions leading to the bridges, and the Tyneside IECC at the west of the site (near the King Edward VII bridge lines), which controls train movements on the East Coast Main Line between Northallerton and Morpeth. Most other TMDs in the area have also closed, mainly due to decreased goods and mineral traffic in the latter half of the 20th century. Only Heaton TMD and South Gosforth TMD (now used for maintaining the Tyne & Wear Metrocars) remain in operation, although the Tyne Yard at Lamesley retains some facilities for freight locomotives. Surviving Related Buildings Gateshead Railway Club, opposite the former entrance to Gateshead station (now Aligeez pizza shop), near the southern end of the High Level Bridge has survived, and The Central bar on the opposite side of the viaduct carrying the line to Sunderland has memorabilia relating to the area's railway history on the walls, including some Gateshead (52A) shed plates from a steam locomotive.

The depot is located on the south side of the Glasgow Central to Paisley lines, adjacent to Shields Junction, close to the site of the former station. The depot's code is 'GW'. History The depot was opened in May 1967 by the Minister of Transport, the Rt. Hon. Barbara Castle MP. Initially to maintain the Class 303 and Class 311 rolling stock operating on the electrified services from Glasgow Central High Level to Gourock, Wemyss Bay, Motherwell via Rutherglen and also the Cathcart Circle and Kirkhill Branches. Electrification up until this point had been confined to Cathcart Circle and Newton/Neilston branches (May 1962) and the North Suburban lines (1960) with sets being maintained at Hyndland Depot which opened in 1959. In 1974 with the further extension of the West Coast Main Line electrification to Glasgow Central meant that AC Electric locomotives would be running the entire route from Euston to Glasgow. The decision was made to maintain the locos at Shields while the coaching stock was maintained at nearby Polmadie Depot. The original allocated locomotives were the Class 81 fleet. Visiting classes ranged from Classes 85, 86 and 87 locos, ultimately seeing the Class 90 introduced in the late 1980s. In its original guise, the depot was capable of handling 8 √ó 3-car sets in four roads undercover. It had seven stabling roads. Within the depot itself Matterson lifting jacks were used to allow the changing of wheelsets and traction motors. Also a wallcrane for the removal of pantographs and other associated roof equipment from the fleet. The depot also had an underfloor wheel profiling machine located in a separate shed in No. 7 road. The depot was also the original home of the electrification maintenance train and the maintenance staff prior to moving to the purpose built Network Rail facility at Cowlairs. In 1978 the depot saw its first expansion as British Rail decided to base the Class 370 Advanced Passenger Train at the depot. Part of the expansion saw the extension of the maintenance shed by fully three coach lengths to allow for the additional passenger rakes into which the APT was formed. Additional equipment was installed including a 15 tonne overhead crane, a purpose built wheel drop pit for removing the axles on the articulated bogies of the APT. In 1985 the decision was made to scrap the APT and BR announced a consolidation of its EMU maintenance in Scotland, this led to the closure of Hyndland Depot in 1987 as a maintenance facility. Furthermore, a purpose built facility was opened at Yoker allowing the closure of Bridgeton as a stabling point also. This meant that the depot at Shields was now responsible for all the EMU maintenance in the Glasgow area. All fleets were maintained by the expanded staff who had transferred. The Class 314 and Class 303 EMUs were transferred from the north of the city to the depot by means of a connecting line just west of Rutherglen station. Around 1990, a further development saw the withdrawal of the electric loco fleet to Polmadie. This left Shields with a 'captive' fleet to maintain. By now this fleet had been enhanced by the introduction of the Class 318 EMUs for the newly electrified Ayrshire lines and by the Class 320 fleet for the North Clyde services. Both of which were commissioned out of the depot. As the life expectancy of the Class 303 fleet diminished, a fleet of Class 334 Juniper EMUs were commissioned again by Shields and fully introduced in 2002. The depot also maintained the Royal Mail Class 325 dual voltage EMUs in partnership with Selhurst Depot in London prior to being mothballed in 1999. Following an announcement by Transport Scotland of the order of a new fleet of Class 380 EMUs a ¬£24m expansion of the depot got underway. This included a dedicated 3-road maintenance shed to the east of the existing building. This was for the exclusive use of the new sets. also housed within the building were new office accommodation and stores. As part of the expansion a new state of the art wheel lathe was also installed enabling faster re-profiling of rolling stock wheelsets.  Allocation  The allocation comprises the following ScotRail stock: * Class 318 EMUs (21 sets, since 1986) * Class 320 EMUs (22 sets, since 1990) * Class 334 EMUs (40 sets, since 2000) * Class 380 EMUs (38 sets, since 2010) * Class 385 EMUs (70 sets, since 2020) The depot was formerly home to: * Class 81 electric locomotives (1975-1990) * Class 303 EMUs (1975-2002) * Class 305 EMUs (1991-2001) * Class 311 EMUs (1975-1993) * Class 314 EMUs (1987-2019) * Class 322 EMUs (2001-2011) * Class 325 EMUs (1996-1999) * Class 370 Advanced Passenger Train-Prototype (1981-1985)  References  * Baker, S.K.

The film was released in Hong Kong on 18 November 1993. Plot Junbao and Tienbo grow up together in a Shaolin Temple as monks, studying the martial arts and generally getting into trouble. They are both expelled from the temple after Tienbo impulsively almost kills a fellow student who cheats in a fight against him. Aided in their escape by their sympathetic teacher, they receive final instructions regarding the potential paths of their different personalities, with a specific warning given to Tienbo. Junbao and Tienbo then go into the outside world to find their way in life. Meanwhile, a gang of henchmen are forcibly taking money from a local shop owner. A girl nicknamed Miss Li steals the money and returns it. Having noticed the money gone, the henchmen start to chase down Little Melon, who holds her own during the fight but soon gets outnumbered and into trouble. Junbao comes to her aid and defeats the gang, before Army reinforcements arrive to break up the fight and so the trio flee to escape capture. At this moment the eunuch governor Liu Jin travels through the town, roughing up the locals as he does so. Tienbo realizes that he wants to be as rich and powerful as the governor, but Miss Li warns him that the governor has \\"the heart of a viper\\". Miss Li then shows the two sworn brothers to a pub for food. Inside the pub, they find a young woman named Siu-lin, who is searching for her lost husband, during which she supports herself by playing on a sanxian that said husband gave to her as a wedding gift. She finds him inside the pub as the new husband of the governor's sister, who picks a fight with Siu-lin. Siu-lin gets the upper hand in the duel, but the husband, eager to please his wealthy new wife, hits and injures Siu-lin on the head with a stool. Junbao comes to Siu-lin's rescue by fighting off the governor's sister's bodyguards before fleeing. The next day, while Junbao and Tienbo are making money with their amazing kung fu skills, the governor's second-in- command spots them and is impressed with Tienbo's abilities (and his eagerness to kow-tow to authority). He offers him a position in the army, which Tienbo readily accepts. However, Junbao is more reluctant to do so and declines going with Tienbo, and so the two brothers part ways. Later, some soldiers come to the pub to collect taxes (which have increased due to the governor‚Äôs greedy nature), but Junbao and the rebels (who have stolen great valuables from the governor to give back to the poor) fight and kill them one by one. One soldier escapes alive and starts off towards the army's camp to warn them about the rebels with Junbao in pursuit. Just in front of the army encampment, Tienbo kills the soldier before he warns the rest of the army about the rebels whereabouts. Tienbo warns Junbao to stay clear of the rebels as they'll get him into trouble. Now knowing where the rebels are hiding however, Tienbo takes this unique opportunity to gain a promotion. He sets a trap for Junbao and the rebels by telling them that the army is on patrol and when would be the best time to attack them. Junbao and Siu-lin collect all the rebels from the region and go to the army camp (thus, falling for Tienbo's trap). A big battle occurs where most of the rebels die. Tienbo captures Miss Li and Siu- lin. In the end, the only escaped survivors are Junbao and a few rebels. Because of the trap, the governor promotes Tienbo to Embroidered Uniform Guard lieutenant. Tienbo kills Miss Li to prove his devotion to the governor, and with his new authority (and some poignant advice from the governor) holds Siu- lin as bait so that he can lure Junbao to defect. Junbao shows up to confront Tienbo and rejects his offer, and after a fierce fight manages to rescue Siu- lin. However, due to the injury he receives and the fact that his best friend betrayed him, Junbao's mind snaps and he goes crazy. While recuperating in the countryside safehouse with the help of Siu-lin, he has a sudden epiphany that regains his mental health, and begins using natural phenomenon as inspiration to create a new style of martial arts which uses \\"soft\\" movements to offset power, speed and strength. While the governor is traveling to Beijing to see the empress, Junbao and Siu-lin intercept the convoy, defeat his sister and guards and captures the governor as a hostage, before going to the army camp to confront Tienbo. Due to his arrogance, Tienbo declines and starts to fight Junbao, thinking the latter is still the inferior fighter. To Tienbo's surprise, however, Junbao is now fighting using the heretofore unseen style, which he calls Tai chi, and is able to fend off Tienbo's superior strength with ease. Out of frustration, Tienbo kills the governor in order to gain complete control over the troops surrounding them. Siu-lin intervenes and convinces them not to listen to Tienbo, as he just betrayed their leader. Seeing this (and also the brutal way Tienbo utilizes his troops as battle fodder), the troops back off and leave Tienbo's fate to Junbao. After a stunning series of parries and blows by Junbao, Tienbo is defeated and eventually killed when he falls upon a bundle of spears. After the fight, Junbao parts way with Siu-lin, and returns Tienbo's ashes to the Shaolin Temple, before establishing his own school at Wudang Mountains.

Other amine compounds can be used instead of ethylene diamine, such as triethylene tetramine or ethanolamine, but EDA has been found to be most effective. PLX is a fairly powerful high explosive, marginally exceeding the destructive yield of TNT. Properties PLX, when mixed, is a transparent liquid with a yellowish tint. Ethylene diamine is very volatile, requiring the contents to be sealed if any storage is intended. Generally, for safety purposes, the contents are transported separately and mixed on site. PLX is known to have a velocity of detonation (VoD) of anywhere between 6,000 and 7,000 m/s, depending on diameter. Although greatly sensitized by the addition of EDA, PLX still requires a powerful blasting cap or a small booster charge to successfully detonate. Uses and discovery PLX was invented during World War II by the Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey. It was originally designed to clear minefields by being spread via plane over the targeted area or poured from a safe distance and detonated by troops on the ground. This explosive can also be gelled through the addition of nitrocellulose, ETN, or any number of soluble nitrate esters or gelling agents. This allows for powdered metals, such as aluminum or magnesium, to be suspended in the mixture. The metal powders act as fuel, increasing heat and energy output but lowering the brisance and VoD. The result is a more sustained blast wave and a \\"push and heave\\" effect, desirable for thermobaric purposes. Trzci≈Ñski reports that 200 grams of a mixture of NM with PMMA as gelling agent and AlMg (45:55, mean particle size = 63 microns) as fuel, in a ratio of 67.2/2.8/30 by mass, has a peak overpressure of 120 kPa 2 m from the(open air) blast site, a 1.65 TNT equivalency in peak pressure, and a 1.62 equivalency in shockwave impulse. As a reference, 104 kPa is widely regarded as a pressure where 50 % of eardrums fail. It's still 3 - 5 times less than the pressure needed to achieve a 50 % fatality rate via pulmonary injury as per Bass/Bowen equations (standing adult, facing any direction).https://www.ffi.no/no/Rapporter/2012%20-%2000539.pdf PLX has been implicated as one of the materials capable of being used in catastrophic terrorism, as most steel core columns can not withstand the detonation of 10 - 30 kg PLX in direct contact (explosive on bare steel). Nitromethane and its gelling agents are freely sold to the public in the US, though. Its sale to the public has been banned in the EU in september 2014.https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we- do/policies/crisis-and-terrorism/explosives/explosives- precursors/docs/guidelines_on_the_marketing_and_use_of_explosives_precursors_en.pdf It was the supposed explosive used in the film Die Hard with a Vengeance. However, the film grossly exaggerated the sensitivity of this explosive mixture. PLX was one of the explosives used to down Korean Air Flight 858 along with C-4.

Biography Born on 31 August 1835, Richard Glynn Vivian was the seventh child and fourth and youngest son of the nine children of industrialist John Henry Vivian and his wife Sarah, daughter of Arthur Jones, of Reigate. His brothers were Henry Vivian (b. 1821), William Graham Vivian (b. 1827) and Arthur Vivian (b. 1834) (who became industrialists and politicians). His uncle was Hussey Vivian, 1st Baron Vivian, a hero of Waterloo. He graduated from Cambridge University as M.A. In February 1855, when he was nineteen years old, his father died, and he inherited a quarter of his father's copper business, Vivian & Sons; but leaving his brothers to be involved in the copper industry he chose to travel and pursue the arts. He gradually built a large art collection. He became a burgess of Swansea, and a Deputy Lieutenant.Burke (1928) In 1885 on 11 March he married Laura Hermione Beatrice Halkett, the only daughter of Henry Craigie Halkett; but six years later, on 6 June 1891, she divorced him. In 1898 he bought Sketty Hall, Swansea, installed his art collections there and began improving the house and its grounds. But in March 1902 he became almost blind ‚Äì an event described in his book, E Tenebris Lux, dictated in 1906. This development affected him deeply, strengthening his Christian faith and prompting him to use his wealth to serve the needs of others. In 1905, visiting Brighton, he was moved by the preaching of James Philips, pastor of the Union Street Mission. In 1906 he established the Glynn Vivian Miners' Mission and endowed it with ¬£30,000, and helped start a mission hall in Swansea; its first pastor was Herbert Voke, who had been Glynn Vivian's assistant. In 1908 a second miners' mission was established in Japan, and others followed around the world (the Glynn Vivian Miners' Mission still exists today as the International Miners' Mission). He also established near Swansea the Glynn Vivian Rest Home for the Blind, at Caswell Bay in Gower. In 1905 he offered his collection of paintings, drawings and china to Swansea Corporation, who with his endowment built the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery to house it. Vivian laid the foundation stone on 14 May 1909, but he died at his London home on 7 June 1910, just over a year before the gallery was opened by his brother, Graham.Morris (1995) References Further reading * Richard Glynn Vivian, E Tenebris Lux: Out Of Darkness, Light!

The project was filmed in 1989, but it was not released until 1992 when the success of Once Upon a Time in China made Li a major action star. Plot The story occurs in Los Angeles, where a fight between Master Tak (Yuen Wah) and Johnny (Jerry Trimble) destroys Tak's herbal medicine store. Johnny is prevented from killing Tak when Anna (Anne Rickets) comes to save him. During his recovery he stays in Anna's camper van. Jet (Jet Li) arrives from Hong Kong on the airport bus. When he arrives at Tak's store to resume as Tak's Kung Fu student, he finds the store shuttered and three thieves steal his bag. He chases their car on foot through the streets and eventually catches them. The thieves are so impressed with Jet's physical skills they beg him to be their master. They take Jet to their home (an abandoned municipal building) but they're attacked by a larger gang. Jet reluctantly steps in to defend his new friends, but their home is set on fire. Johnny and his gang are closing down kung fu schools and making a name for themselves. Jet meets May (Crystal Kwok), a bank worker responsible for the loan on Tak's store - but neither knows where Master Tak is. Jet finds himself in the middle of a robbery at a carpark. He finds himself fighting beside Johnny, but Johnny recognizes him from one of Tak's pictures and makes it clear he intends to kill both Jet and Tak. Anna and Jet's friends get beaten up, so Jet trains his friends to defend themselves. Jet is eventually re- united with Tak, but Tak claims he's no longer interested in either teaching Kung Fu or doing herbal medicine. Jet and his friends go to Tak's store and prepares to deal with Johnny's gang. The three friends put their newfound skills into practice fighting four members of Johnny's gang. Jet and Johnny fight outside the store until the police step in. Jet and Tak argue, and Jet decides to return to Hong Kong. On the airport bus he's attacked by two dreadlocked men armed with a shotgun who was at the carpark. Jet manages to defeat the men and regain control of the bus despite a shotgun blast killing the driver. May has been following the bus in her car, possibly intending to express romantic interest in Jet. In the meantime, Tak and the three friends make their way to a rooftop where Johnny and his gang are holding Anna hostage. Jet and May go to Tak's store to find a note and a will. They quickly make their way to the rooftop of a tall building where Tak has disabled 15 or 20 of Johnny's men but is beginning to tire due to his age. Jet takes over for his master and fights Johnny while Tak and the friends defeat the rest of the gang and rescue Anna. After an intense fight Jet manages to kick Johnny off a hanging wire to his death. Jet boards the airport bus, once again intending to go to Hong Kong. To his surprise he finds May there as well; planning to go to with him for a holiday, but the three friends and Master Tak drive up beside the bus: Master Tak has stolen Jet's passport so he can't leave. Jet and the others laugh at May's misfortune of traveling alone but she in anger and frustration shoves her ticket in Jet's mouth as the credits roll.

Four minutes of cuts were made, including: * The opening scene, in which Anna fights a gymnastics student. * A scene of Anna being banned from gymnastics school. * A scene of Jet walking through Los Angeles is cut slightly. Also, acoustic guitar music replaces the original, more somber score, changing the intentions of the scene significantly. * A scene in which Jet, after the clinic is raided, finds Anna beaten up. Reception Upon initial release, The Master was not particularly successful. In his audio commentary for the Hong Kong Legends DVD release, Bey Logan gives possible explanations why, citing characters' ridiculous behaviour and contrived situations. He explains that the characters' motivations are unclear - there is no clear reason why Johnny and his gang repeatedly go to Uncle Tak's store to intimidate him, and close down other kung fu schools. Also, if the bus driver is shot by the dreadlocked man with a shotgun, why does the bus keep moving while the action is still going? Lastly, the Hong Kong film crew doesn't have the same luxury as the American film crew which led to certain scenes that didn't work too well. Despite the flawed plot, the film did give signs of what was to come from Jet Li's appearances in films with modern settings. Li's action style in The Master was an early example of what was to come in his Hollywood films Romeo Must Die and Cradle 2 the Grave.http://www.thespinningimage.co.uk/cultfilms/displaycultfilm.asp?reviewid=1200 Box office The Master earned a weak HK$8,096,542 in Hong Kong.

Early life Miguel was born in Gaiman, in the Chubut Province in Argentina, June 1, 1956. Career At 17, she met Diego Verdaguer, a man 5 years her senior, whom she would later marry. At this time, Diego was already an established artist, and she joined his musical group called Mediterr√°neo. The group enjoyed success in Los Angeles, California, but after being discovered by a Univision network record executive, she launched her own solo career with help from San Diego. Miguel's first album, El Sonido Vol. 1, was recorded in 1981, and released a year later. Implementing a different sound and style than Mediterr√°neo, her album was a success. Follow-up albums were released a year later. Songs during this period, such as Asi No Te Amara Jamas, √âl Me Minti√≥ (1981), and Mi Buen Coraz√≥n (1982) have become staples of Los Angeles radio stations for KRCD-FM Recuerdo 103.9/98.3 FM. The birth of her and Verdaguer's daughter, Ana Victoria, led Miguel to break from the recording studio and focus on motherhood. She would return to the music scene in 1987, with her fourth album, El Pecado. In 1989 she recorded her fifth studio album, El rostro del Amor, with lyrics by Anahi van Zandweghe. Its title song was chosen to greet Pope John Paul II in his visit to Mexico. For her sixth album, Rompecorazones, she delved in the world of ranchero music. Under the supervision of composer Federico Mendez, he chose her songs, including the title song, which became great hits. In 1996, Miguel traveled to Italy where she recorded Amame una vez m√°s, also with lyrics by Anahi in the title song and most of the others. The album was released the same year and was met with critical praise and highly positive sales in the United States and Latin America. The title track was nominated for a Lo Nuestro Award for Pop Song of the Year. She returned in 1998 to record once more. The album 5 Dias was released the following year. It included a remake of the song \\"As√≠ Como Hoy\\", which Diego produced. In 2005, she released her album Piedra de Afilar. This album brought in newcomer, multi-instrumentalist David Snow as a co-producer with her longtime husband/producer Diego Verdaguer. This album shows Amanda to be looking ahead to a more modern sound without losing the polished productions and fabulous songs that made her famous. This album also contains a long-awaited duet between Miguel and Diego, \\"Siempre Fuimos Dos\\", penned by David Snow, Diego Verdaguer and Miguel, with lyrics by Anahi, who also wrote all the other lyrics in the album.

Now professionally performing as Cassidy Catanzaro with Cassidy and The Music was the lead singer and writer for the band Antigone Rising from 1999 through 2008. Early life Cassidy was born Susan H Catanzaro and grew up in Sparta Township, New Jersey, a small rural town in Sussex County. She has one brother, Eugene who works in education. Cassidy has said that growing up near the Pennsylvania border amongst the lakes and farms influenced her love of nature and her free spirit. She began attending a nearby Nazarene Gospel Church with her father as a small child. Its pastor was her next door neighbor. That's where Cassidy discovered the joy that's created from singing. Her mother's taste in music also influenced her: Bruce Springsteen, Fleetwood Mac, and Southern Rock and soul from the 1970s. Cassidy as a youngster sang back-ups for local hero, Jim Kilby. She then moved to New York City, often performing solo or with a band. Cassidy got her first paying job when she relocated to Los Angeles, as a singer and dancer in stage reviews written and produced by Emmy Award-Winning Anita Mann. It was around this time that Cassidy traveled through the US, South America and Europe, spending two summers in Alaska. Cassidy later moved to London, Greater London where she found work singing jazz and session singing for London's premiere jingle house Hobson's Her voice was heard throughout the U.K. singing with Tessa Niles in Barbie commercials. It was there that Cassidy also began writing songs on guitar. She also sang with the late Robert Palmer, The Bucketheads, Curiosity Killed the Cat and Luciana. 1999-2008 - Antigone Rising In 1999 and living again in Los Angeles, she was approached by Antigone Rising who was looking for a new lead singer. She sent the band a demo tape. And after a face to face meeting she was asked to join. Cassidy provided A.R. with songs she had written while spending time in Los Angeles, and it was ultimately these songs that inspired Lava/Atlantic executive Jason Flom to sign the all female band to a record deal. The band released four independent albums with Cassidy singing lead vocals. Her live performance hailed among the best live rock singers in the business. They built a dedicated fanbase, known for following them along their East Coast tour stops. Their major label debut From the Ground Up produced by Neil Dorfsman was released exclusively through a landmark deal between Starbucks coffee shops, in conjunction with Starbucks' Hear Music series and Lava/Atlantic Records. AR enjoyed multiple features in Rolling Stone magazine veteran writer David Fricke calling Cassidy \\"A vocal dynamo\\" and hailing their show as the \\"big rock show of the SxSW festival\\". They were featured in national commercials for 7 Jeans and appeared in all Conde Nast magazines in the Spring of 2006. Although AR received very little radio play the band has sold upwards of 1 million copies of FTGU to date, and a collective 3 million records including all releases. Vh1 aired a half hour special featuring the band from its humble beginnings to its steady rise and Cassidy can still be seen as a regular commentator in Vh1's \\"I love..\\" series and \\"Bad Girls\\" Special. The band toured with The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Dave Mathews, and Rob Thomas and appeared on late night and morning television. The Matchbox 20 singer also co-wrote and produced tracks for the band. He is highly quoted as calling Cassidy \\"a born star\\".

It is a brick structure in the Queen Anne architectural style erected in the late 19th century. In 1980, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is the oldest theater in Westchester County still used as a theater, and considered one of the county's finest non- residential applications of the Queen Anne Style. In 1901 it was one of the first theaters to show the new form of entertainment called motion pictures. Dave Brubeck, Louis Armstrong and Miles Davis are among the musicians who have performed there. Many classical music performances have been recorded there to take advantage of its excellent acoustics. It is one of only 6% of theaters in the United States built before 1900. It closed in 1976 due to neglect and structural problems. Shortly after it was listed on the Register, a local not- for-profit bought it and restored it. It has remained in operation since it was reopened a few years later, with several other renovations. More notable artists have performed there since then and it has been used in several films and television commercials. Building The Music Hall is located on the northeast corner of the intersection of West Main and Kaldenberg Place, one block west of Broadway (U.S. Route 9). The surrounding neighborhood is a densely developed urban core, with many two-story commercial and mixed-use buildings. Some mature trees grow above building height, and there are a few parking lots between and behind the buildings. The terrain slopes gradually towards the Hudson River 0.6 mile (1 km) to the west. =Exterior= The building itself is a two-and-a-half-story three-by-seven-bay structure. Its south (front) facade and the first three bays on the east and west have a rough-cut granite foundation and brick facing. The remaining bays and the north elevation have a brick foundation with stucco and half-timber facing. A limestone water table at the southwest corner appears to be the foundation due to the slope exposing it. Atop the building is a hipped roof shingled in slate with a cast iron parapet railing around its flat central section. On the south the facade is intricately and elaborately detailed, with square corner towers and a gable-roofed middle section flanked by two smaller square quoined towers. Two small shops with flank the main entrance. Their windows are topped with panels of frosted glass set with designs of stained glass and lead, panels that also top the nearby doors leading to stairs to the upper floors. Above the main entrance is the marquee. Its flat top has another iron railing; illuminated lettering on it spells out \\"Music Hall\\" on all three sides. Two terra cotta belt courses with paneling between set off the second story, with large corbels on the corner towers. The upper one forms the sill of the one- over-one double-hung sash windows with painted wood surrounds and glass transoms topped by terra cotta lintels. On the towers flanking the center, these windows are additionally topped by triangular panels. In the middle a door to the balcony creates a tripartite version of the window with an additional two flanking windows. Above it is an arched brick, stone and terra cotta panel with \\"Music Hall\\" spelled out in the semicircle below large keystone-shaped arrangements. The \\"18\\" and \\"85\\" on the sides indicates the construction date. A terracotta and sandstone string course tops the windows on the second story, with corbelling between it and the corniced roofline. Similar, but more intricate decoration graces the flanking towers at the center. The gable field has an eight-pane double casement window, with the brick and terra cotta giving way to fish-scale wood shingles midway up. Above the window is a bell-shaped hood with finial. The roofline has the same treatment as the flat portions of the roof. The southeast and southwest facades of the corner towers have a small arched window with fanlight flanked by two small smooth wooden Doric pilasters. Similar openings in the other sides have been shingled over in slate. Atop the towers are bell-cast roofs shingled in slate and topped by finials as well with weather vanes. The center flanking towers have flared pyramidal roofs and finials. Fenestration on the stucco and half-timber section in the rear consists of six rectangular windows and five doors. They are placed irregularly on the two stories. The only decorative touch is the triangular pediment on one dormer window at the roof. =Interior= The lobby uses mostly marble and limestone with brass trim. Detailing uses classically-inspired motifs. To the rear, the large entertainment space has been extensively modified from its original design. It has a pitched floor with 843 permanent seats. Plaster panels on the wall conceal the original wooden arches. Silhouettes of figures in early 20th- century dress decorate wall niches in the panels as well as stair landings and hallways. Similar landscapes in silhouette fill the domes beneath the balcony. Higher up, the plaster panels on the arched ceiling spandrels and frieze have been painted gold, as have the classical elements on the stage wall. The plaster ceiling medallions from which the chandeliers hang are original. Backstage the original ceiling arches are intact, as are the murals and door surrounds. Other original finishing can also be found in one of the second- floor apartments, now used as office space. History In 1885, William L. Wallace, a local chocolate manufacturer, had the idea to build a theater in the heart of Tarrytown. The building was to be mixed-use with apartments and commercial space, as well as a large entertainment area in the rear. Architect Philip Edmunds's design exemplified the Queen Anne style in its mix of materials, as advocated by Richard Norman Shaw, considered to have established the style. It cost Wallace $50,000 ($ in modern dollars) to build and opened in December. The first night's performance was instrumental selections from The Mikado with a quartet vocal performance of \\"Moonlight on the Lake\\". Originally, the performance space had a flat floor with removable seating. The stage is not believed to have been movable, although that was possible at the time. The wooden spandrels were visible, as was elaborate classical detailing, such as the molded consoles supporting the balcony and elaborate brackets supporting the main floor posts. The more flexible interior space allowed the theater to host all sorts of events, including several roller skating contests in 1886. It was altered in 1901 to accommodate motion pictures, a new form of entertainment it was one of the first theaters to show. The following year, the wealthy residents of Tarrytown sponsored the first of several lavish annual flower shows. John D. Rockefeller often loaned palm trees grown in the greenhouses at Kykuit, his nearby estate, for use in sets. The original gas chandeliers were replaced with electric ones in 1910. In 1915 another alteration moved the main entrance from the west facade to its current location. That year it hosted the Cotton Ball, a major women's suffrage rally. Other political events the Music Hall hosted during the Progressive Era included speeches by Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt. Performers of that era included Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k and Mae West. A further remodeling in 1922 changed the interior to its present configuration, sloping the floor, adding permanent seats and covering the wall spandrels with plaster. The new interior added some Art Nouveau and Art Deco elements. By 1930, the theater was exclusively showing films. It continued to do so until 1976, when television and larger multi-screen theaters had undercut its business. The village proposed that the vacant theater be torn down to make way for a parking lot. That fate was avoided around the time it was listed on the Register. In 1980 the Friends of the Mozartina Musical Arts Conservatory, a not-for-profit organization, purchased the abandoned theater to preserve it and establish a center for the performing arts. It was necessary to repair electrical and plumbing infrastructure damaged by years of neglect. For 23 years the Music Hall was run by a volunteer staff, primarily local music professor Berthold Ringeisen and his wife Helen. Due to its wooden arches, the theater's acoustics are excellent enough that many classical music performances have been recorded there. In 2009, the Canadian Brass could be heard clearly in the rear of the theater without amplification. Bjorn Olsson was hired as the theater's first full-time professional director in 2003. That year the theater spent $100,000 to re-roof one side of the building, replace the stage curtain, spotlights and sandbags. Four years later, in 2007, it bought the property behind the theater to use as staff parking and for a possible future loading dock. The year afterwards, a local Junior League chapter raised most of the money to replace the original air conditioning after it failed. The restrooms were made disabled accessible in 2011. Today, the theater hosts performances 180 days a year. Several films and television commercials have been shot in the building, including The Preacher's Wife (1996), The Impostors (1998), The Secret Lives of Dentists (2003), Mona Lisa Smile (2003), Game 6 (2005), and The Good Shepherd, a 2006 film directed by Robert De Niro which filmed on location at the Music Hall in November 2005. More recently, exterior and interior scenes from the 2011 film, Henry's Crime, starring Keanu Reeves, were shot at the Tarrytown Music Hall in January 2010. Random Farms Kids Theater (a Westchester-based non-profit children's theater and founded by Anya Wallach in 1996), Ars Viva Chamber Orchestra (a premiere chamber orchestra), and Westchester Symphonic Winds (an adult community-based 60-piece wind and percussion ensemble) are all currently recognized as resident companies of the Tarrytown Music Hall. In 2012, the alternative music group guster filmed a DVD at the Music Hall during their acoustic tour. In 2018, The Music Hall introduced a resident theater arts program for young people called The Tarrytown Music Hall Academy, offering a variety of workshops to kids in the Hudson Valley and beyond with a focus on the process of creating theater arts, including lighting, costume, and set design, play writing, stage combat choreography, as well as performance.

Lego Town is one of the three original themes that Lego produced upon its launch of the Lego minifigure in 1978 along with Castle and Space. The Town brand was briefly replaced with Lego World City in 2003 and 2004 before it was simply rebranded as Lego City in 2005. History The Lego City theme traces its origins to Lego Town, a theme introduced with the first minifigures in 1978, although Lego sets with city buildings and vehicles were commonplace by the late 1960s. In 1975, a precursor to the minifigure was introduced, in the same scale but without moving parts. These mid-1970s, Town sets had buildings and vehicles functioning more as models, with minifigures unable to ride the vehicles, which continued with the new minifigures until the early 1980s, when buildings and vehicles consistently were designed to be compatible with minifigures. All sets were originally released under the \\"Legoland\\" label until it was discontinued and replaced with \\"Lego System\\" branding in 1991. Eventually, different subthemes under the \\"Town\\" brand were used to tie together related sets, such as police, coast guard, emergency services, airport, road rescue, trains, fire, and harbour. During the Christmas season, a City-themed advent calendar set is sold through the online Lego Shop and at retailers. In June 2020, following the killing of George Floyd by police, Lego made an announcement that they would temporarily stop marketing police-related Lego City sets. Due to misinformation claiming that they removed these sets from being sold that led to backlash, Lego issued a follow-up statement emphasizing that the sets were still for sale and that digital advertising for the sets would just be temporarily haulted. Subthemes Outside of Lego City's generic city and town life based sets that are released regularly, the theme has had various subthemes, many of which are recurring. Under the Lego Town theme, the subthemes released during the 1990s and early 2000s also had individualized branding and labeling. In 2003 and 2004, the only town-based sets were released under the \\"World City\\" label. Since the launch of City in 2005, they are just labeled as City sets but often have multiple sets based around a single concept released at the same time during Lego's release schedule. =Town subthemes (1991‚Äì2002)= *Arctic: 2000 *City Center: 1999‚Äì2000 *Divers: 1997 *Extreme Team: 1998‚Äì1999 *Flight: 1992‚Äì1996 *Launch Command: 1995 *Nautica: 1991 *Outback: 1997 *Paradisa: 1992‚Äì1997 *Res-Q: 1998 *RSQ911: 1991‚Äì1992 *Space Port: 1999 *Town Jr: 1997‚Äì1998, 2001‚Äì2002 =City subthemes (2005‚Äìpresent)= *Airport: 2006, 2010, 2016, 2020 *Arctic: 2014, 2018 *Cargo: 2008, 2013 *Coast Guard: 2008, 2013, 2017 *Construction: 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009 **Demolition: 2015 *Deep Sea Explorers: 2015, 2020 *Emergency/Medical: 2006, 2012, 2018 *Farm: 2009‚Äì2010 *Fire: 2005, 2007, 2008, 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, 2020 **Forest Fire: 2012 *Great Vehicles: 2012‚Äì2020 *Harbour: 2007, 2011 *Jungle: 2017 *Mining: 2012, 2018 *Police: 2005, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2014, 2017, 2020 **Elite Police: 2013, 2020 **Forest Police: 2012 **Mountain Police: 2018 **Prison Island: 2016 **Sky Police: 2019 **Swamp Police: 2015 *Space: 2011, 2015, 2019 *Town: 2009, 2012‚Äì2013, 2015‚Äì2020 *Trains: 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2018 *Volcano Explorers: 2016 Octan Octan logo, unchanged since 1992. Octan is a fictional oil company that has appeared in multiple Lego sets since 1992. Before that time, logos of the real-world oil companies Esso, Shell and Exxon were used on sets. The Shell logo continued to be used on promotional sets after that time. In 2014, Lego announced it would not renew its marketing agreement with Shell, under pressure from the environmental group Greenpeace. Octan first appeared in the 1992 sets \\"6397 Gas N' Wash Express\\" and \\"6594 Gas Transit\\". Since the release of the Octan name, Lego has not signed any further deals with Shell or other gas corporations. Octan (or oktan) is the Danish word for octane, a component of gasoline. Octan has appeared in a number of Lego video games. Lego Island for example features an Octan gas station and the company sponsors the race track. In The Lego Movie, Octan is the base company of the main antagonist Lord Business. His company is the producer of almost all of the commodities in his dominion. In the Lego set \\"7747 Wind Turbine Transport\\", the Octan logo had a new part in it which said Energy, which implies that it now produces renewable energy, not just oil products. Then, in the set 60016 Tanker Truck, the Energy part of it is larger suggesting that Octan is now going green. In a number of Town and City sets it is shown that Octan has a racing team that competes in at least Formula One, GT racing and rallying. Other media A video game developed by TT Fusion called Lego City Undercover was released for the Wii U on March 18, 2013; a port of the game was released April 4, 2017 on Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. A prequel to the game was also released for the Nintendo 3DS on April 21, 2013. Lego City content, based on Lego City Undercover, was added to the toys-to-life video game Lego Dimensions on May 9, 2017, via a \\"fun pack\\" containing a Chase McCain minifigure and a constructible Police Helicopter. In 2011, short two to five minute films produced by M2 Films and Lego were aired on Cartoon Network and released on the Lego website. New films have since been released every year. In 2019, Nickelodeon premiered a new series in June of that year, based on the Lego City theme. The series, titled Lego City Adventures features the newly introduced named characters from the brand as they do their daily jobs in the fictional metropolis.

The depot is situated to the east of Leeds railway station on the north side of the line. The TOPS depot code is NL. History 48343 Neville Hill 22 June 1968 In 1899 the locomotive shed at Holbeck was found not to have sufficient capacity for the number of locomotives using it, so an additional depot was constructed at Neville Hill by the North Eastern Railway at a cost of ¬£132,971, with the facility being extended in 1904. Sometime during the 1950s the four-roundhouse shed was reduced by half and given a new frontage. A DMU shed is believed to have been added in 1958 along with servicing facilities for diesels although main line locomotives such as class 45s were still being stabled outside the old brick- built steam shed in 1961. D2000 series 0-6-0 diesel shunters were the first diesel locos allocated to Neville Hill, probably about that time; the quartet in 1961 comprised D2242-4/6. At the formation of British Railways in 1948 the depot code was 50B, under York (50A). In 1959 it was transferred to the Leeds District under Holbeck (55A) and re-coded 55H. After 1973 the depot code became NL. A completely new set of buildings were opened in 1969 to cater for diesel locomotives, DMUs, and coaching stock. This included a new carriage cleaning plant, an inspection pit and a repair shed. At this time the main use of the depot was for DMUs and carriages, but by 1980 Neville Hill was maintaining HSTs and Class 08 shunters. The allocation at this time reflected the changes going on in British Rail with a move from loco-hauled coaching stock to fixed formation HSTs, so that the allocation of locomotives in 1977 was just 4 Class 08 shunters while the larger locomotives were located on the south side of Leeds at Holbeck shed, but by 1985 all 9 of the shunters for the Leeds area were allocated to Neville Hill along with 55 HST power cars. In 1987, the depot had an allocation of Class 08 shunters. Classes 101, 108, 110, 111, 141, 142, 144 and 150 DMUs and Class 254 HSTs were also allocated. The line from Leeds City station to Neville Hill depot was electrified in the early 1990s as a corollary to the East Coast Main Line electrification project. The electrification was energised in March 1993. =Current= The depot is operated by East Midlands Railway and Northern used for light and heavy maintenance, and train storage. CrossCountry and London North Eastern Railway also use the site for train storage. The site employs over 400 people (2009). Rolling stock in the modern era  As of 2011, East Midlands Trains had 24 Class 43s, and 10 Mark 3 sets allocated to Neville Hill. Northern had Class 144, Class 153, Class 155, Class 321 and Class 333s allocated to Neville Hill. London North Eastern Railway carry out light maintenance and cleaning on their High Speed Train and InterCity 225 sets as well as CrossCountry High Speed Trains. Neville Hill also has Class 08 diesel shunters owned by Maintrain Ltd., and Wabtec Rail Ltd. In 2012 East Midlands Train's facility at Neville Hill was used for the \\"Project Miller\\" restoration of a prototype Class 43 unit (Class 41) number 41001 to working condition. As of 2012 five Class 322s were allocated to Neville Hill,, after being transferred from Scotland in the second half of 2011.

This species is obligately eusocial, with queens and workers, though the differences between the castes are not nearly as extreme as in honey bees. Early taxonomists mistakenly assigned the worker females to a different species from the queens. They are small (about 1 cm), shiny, mostly black bees with off-white hair bands at the bases of the abdominal segments. L. malachurum is one of the more extensively studied species in the genus Lasioglossum, also known as sweat bees. Researchers have discovered that the eusocial behavior in colonies of L. malachurum varies significantly dependent upon the region of Europe in which each colony is located.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  L. malachurum was described by the entomologist William Kirby in 1802. This species of bees fall within the genus Lasioglossum, which is the largest bee genus. Lasioglossum falls within the family Halictidae, which includes small to midsized bees and is commonly referred to as the sweat bee family because the Halictidae are frequently attracted to human perspiration. L. malachurum falls within the order Hymenoptera, a large order of generally winged insects containing wasps, bees, and ants. One species of lasioglossum that is closely related to the L. malachurum is L. hemichalceum.  Description  Lasioglossum.malachurum = Caste dimorphism = Physical size is a major distinguishing feature between queens and gynes versus female worker bees. Queens consistently are larger in body size than workers. Queens also tend to have worn wings and worn mandibles as a result of higher activity, in addition to greater ovarian development correlating with the reproductive capacity of queens. Queens also generally have abundant fat stores. This physical dimorphism persists throughout all stages of the lifecycle, from pupae to adult. Rarely, queens can be abnormally small compared to the size of workers, but abnormally large workers have never been observed in the wild. = Nest identification = The sweat bee has a simple nesting architecture consisting of a vertical tunnel into the ground ending in a compartment reserved for brood-rearing. They nest underground, like Lasioglossum zephyrus, but they do not form the same complex structures. Nest entrances are frequently concealed using scattered foliage. For L. malachurum, thousands of nests can be found located within a small region in nesting aggregations, which suggests that the bees likely have some sort of identification mechanism for conspecific nests. In fact, nest entrances and brood cell linings are both impregnated with secretions from the Dufour's gland of the bees, which plays a role in nest orientation. Nests are dug into hard, compact soil and can be sealed from within by the queen using her abdomen. Because nests are dug into hard soil, construction of a nest represents a significant energy expense to a queen, which explains why gynes frequently usurp other nests rather than founding one of their own. L. malachurum is a Western Palaearctic species and nests can be found across Southern England and the Channel Islands, most of continental Europe, and North Africa.  Distribution and habitat  L. malachurum is found across England, continental Europe, and northern Africa, so is capable of inhabiting a broad range of habitats and climates. Differences in the climes of the various habitats can frequently impact the social behavior of L. malachurum within that habitat. The length of summer, for example, can affect the length of the breeding season and thereby impact the number of broods a queen may have. The longer breeding seasons in Southern Europe can also lead to reproductive capacity in worker bees, making L. malachurum in those regions not purely eusocial. Female workers in southern European colonies of L. malachurum consequently have significantly more developed ovaries than their counterparts in northern European colonies. Due to the relatively broad range of nesting habitats of the species, L. malachurum is subject to a myriad of climate-based selective pressures that cause a differential in behavior dependent upon location. Researchers have identified a tendency for L. malachurum in southern European climes to be characterized by more activity and the production of more worker broods prior to the production of a gyne brood, whereas L. malachurum in northern European climes exhibit less activity and only a single worker brood prior to the gyne brood.  Colony cycle  The queens of L. malachurum, following fertilization the previous year, begin to appear in the spring, when food sources are plentiful to sustain them after the long overwintering period. Although several females usually outwinter in the same burrow with little conflict, they start to act aggressively until a single female is left in possession of the burrow, leaving the evicted females to obtain or excavate burrows of their own. Each female with a nest tunnel then begins to build brood cells in short side passages which she excavates to the side of the main passage. Immediately following construction, each brood cell is mass-provisioned with a mixture of pollen and nectar in the form of a firm, doughy mass. An egg is laid on each pollen mass and the individual cell sealed by the female. Each egg takes 22 days to develop from an egg to a full adult. She then goes on to construct more, similar cells containing eggs and pollen masses. During this time, before the first worker brood has emerged, containing only about five workers, the foundress queen frequently leaves the nest to find provisions to build the brood cells of the nest. These nest absences are accompanied by high risk of intraspecific usurpation. Once the brood is provisioned, the queen seals the nest synchronously with all other queens in the aggregation, and all above-ground activity ceases for three weeks. Larvae from the earliest eggs are full grown and start pupation by the end of May in Central Europe (or much earlier in warmer climates), emerging from their cells by mid-June. For bees in cooler climates with shorter breeding seasons, these adults are all non-reproductive female workers, somewhat smaller than their mother. The original maternal female bee remains within the nest and guards the entrance to the burrow, now acting as a queen while her non-reproductive daughters act as workers; they go out foraging for food and help in the construction of new brood cells, in which the queen lays new eggs. For bees in warmer climates with longer breeding seasons, some of the female workers have reproductive capacity and can help breed up to two subsequent worker broods before the eventual gyne brood. Males begin to emerge from the final brood of the season by the beginning of August in Central Europe, or May‚ÄìJune in the Mediterranean region. Several days later, reproductive females begin to emerge, as well, which are morphologically similar to their queen. During sunny weather, the nest aggregation becomes a lek and the males vie for territory on the ground. The males mate with the new reproductive females (from both their own and separate nests), although they do not attempt mating with the non-reproductive females. Impregnated females may continue to live in their mothers' nests, although it is thought that they only forage for their own food and do not contribute to the rest of the nest. With the arrival of the colder autumn weather, the males and non-reproductive females die off, and the impregnated reproductive females go on to spend the winter in diapause and repeat the lifecycle the following year. The lifecycle is longer, with two successive broods of workers, in southern Europe. Soil temperature specifically has been linked to decreasing the overall length of the nesting cycle. Workers in warmer soil tend to require less time to provision a new brood, possibly because they have more active time each day.  Behavior  = Dominance hierarchies = L. malachurum colonies are monogynous. Although the queen coordinates the workers within the nest, the workers can exert pressures on the queen, as well. Because queens frequently are replaced through usurpation and queen turnover, the workers within a nest are less related to the queen than expected. As such, the workers are less likely to cooperate with the queen based on maximizing their own fitness. To get the workers to remain with the nest and continue to aid her own offspring, the queen often cedes reproduction to alien workers. These workers can produce males or gynes and have high rates of reproduction. They do not, however, overwinter, nor are they morphologically similar to a queen or gyne. The length of lifespan for the queens may be a factor that leads to more reproductive workers in southern climes that have longer breeding seasons; in northern climes, where the queen is generally alive for production of gynes, workers are less likely to be reproductive. In southern climes, where the queen frequently does not survive to gyne production, workers are more likely to be reproductive. = Communication and recognition =  Male-female communication  Communication between males and females of L. malachurum is mediated using pheromones. Virginal queens attract males through a sex hormone that mated queens lack; thus, males are much more attracted to younger queens. The chemical distinctions between the pheromones released by virginal and mated queens are significant in terms of proportions of hydrocarbons and lactones. Whereas isopentenyl esters, unsaturated fatty acids, and hydrocarbons are far more abundant in the chemical makeup of a virginal queen's hormones, the old queen's hormones are more likely to be made up of largely macrocyclic lactones. This chemical distinction between virginal and old females allows males to distinguish between the two, thus enabling male choice in sexual partner. They are also capable of discriminating between familiar and unknown queens, and l generally are more attracted to queens of a foreign colony, which likely arose as an outbreeding mating strategy, which increases genetic diversity of the population and decreases the probability that the next generation would be subject to genetic disease.  Nest recognition  Because L. malachurum generally nests in aggregations of thousands of colonies within a small region, the ability of bees to recognize their own nests is crucial. Outside the entrances to the nest, guards are posted. These guards mark the nest entrances with Dufour's gland secretions to create olfactory cues to guide colony specific bees back to the nest. These secretions are largely made up of alkanes and alkenes. Bees of the species L. malachurum also rely on visual cues and landmarks to determine where their nests are, which they establish through orientation flights and continuously update through reorientation flights.  Nestmate discrimination  Nestmates are able to identify other nestmates using olfactory cues, as well. Chemical similarities, specifically in nonvolatile alkenes and alkanes, provide this cue. Notably, the component of discrimination is not based on kinship, but on shared nesting site, and individual bees of L. malachurum do not behave differently toward related nestmates and unrelated nestmates. In a given nest, the many different compounds mix together to form a gestalt odor that marks all of the members of the nest. This form of scent blending is found commonly among other members of Hymenoptera including certain bees, wasps, and ants. The gestalt bouquet of odors differs significantly in terms of chemical composition between different nests. = Usurpation = Queens frequently can be usurped by intraspecific gynes, because the creation of a new nest is a significant energy investment for gynes. The probability of a colony usurpation increases steadily as the season progresses, most likely because the probability of a gyne having the time and resources to found a new colony and produce new workers decreases. The increasing risk of usurpation may play a role in the small worker broods, because the queen ceases foraging and seals her nest in mid-May to protect from usurping gynes. Early nest closure has been favored by pressure from usurpation and has developed into an evolutionarily stable strategy. It might also explain why queens are highly aggressive toward other conspecific queens. In confrontations between foundresses and usurping gynes, female size is a significant determinant of outcome because it gives the queen or usurper a significant advantage. Although they have a physical advantage in usurpation, larger queens are more likely to found their own nests rather than usurp another. = Mating behavior = The nest aggregation of thousands of colonies that persists throughout the year becomes a lek mating system on warm summer days in the latter half of the breeding season (July through September). The daily operational sex ratio has far more males than females, which is common in a lek mating system and among other bees. The lek mating is a system in which a large group of males clusters at sites visited by females for mating. Males are attracted during mating by a mix of olfactory cues produced in multiple glandular sources from the female. Males seek out unrelated, unmated females; because females are only receptive for a short period following their emergence, males must seek out and find an unmated gyne before the large number of other males. Mating can occur either in the female's nest or on flowers. Queens can be polyandrous, but only rarely do they actually mate with multiple males. Most colonies arise from only one queen and one male. = Aggression = Aggression is commonly seen between conspecifics of all halictid bees; especially between usurper females, drawn out fights can occur that last for nearly a half-hour and result in damage to or loss of limbs and body parts. Guard bees of the L. malachurum species, which are workers that defend the nest, also demonstrate antagonistic behavior toward non-nestmate conspecifics, by orienting their stingers toward the intruders or blocking the entrance to the nest with their abdomens. They are able to discriminate between non-nestmates and nestmates, which they allow to pass with ease. Foragers, though, are either unable to discriminate between nestmate and non-nestmate conspecifics or are uninterested in pursuing aggression against non-nestmate conspecifics, so exhibit high levels of tolerance toward all conspecifics.  Pollination  L. malachurum bees are polylectic, meaning that they collect pollen from a broad range of unrelated plant species. Although L. malachurum displays opportunism when selecting flowers from which to extract pollen, they will generally narrow their selection of pollen during a given collection period. The species demonstrates floral consistency, and generally only collects from one pollen source during a given pollen flight. The pollination behavior of L. malachurum may be useful for humans to cultivate and develop, because the bee has been implicated in pollinating species of plants that are commonly used by humans for food and for medication.  Parasites  L. malachurum colonies are parasitized by the kleptoparasitic species of the genus Sphecodes. The bees of this genus have developed a strategy for invading the nest of host species that involves avoiding interaction with any host individuals. The parasites generally parasitize L. malachurum nests during the early spring when the foundress queens need to leave their nests unattended to forage. Other species enter guarded nests during the second brood cycle and kill the guard, as well all other present host individuals, before laying eggs in the brood cells. After oviposition, the parasite closes the brood cells to prevent the host female from returning and replacing the parasite eggs. Because the parasites in the genus Sphecodes parasitize a broad range of other bee species, few adaptations to the specific L. malachurum bee colonies exist.

The depot operator is Great Western Railway. The depot code is PZ. Description 08410 and 57605 Totnes Castle in the sidings at Long Rock The depot is beside the Cornish Main Line, where it runs as a single track on the southern side and terminates at Penzance railway station, half a mile west of the depot. The depot is small, with six long sidings to store High Speed Trains and Voyagers, and four smaller sidings. If the longer sidings are all used up, trains are stored at Laira TMD, Plymouth, and then make their way to Penzance railway station in the morning. The depot also has a fuel lane, a single- tracked modern maintenance shed, and a small carriage washer. A few years ago, facilities at Penzance TMD were expanded to cater for the new fleet of Voyagers used by CrossCountry. The main line and depot lie near the sea, with just Long Rock beach and the embankment that carries the South West Coast Path separating them, which means this depot and the main line sometimes have problems due to the sea. The fuel storage tanks at the depot are located behind the maintenance shed and are replenished on a daily basis by road deliveries. History = Steam shed = A four-road engine shed was built at Long Rock in 1914. As well as the engine shed there was a turntable built to fit all size locomotives which ran on the route. The depot had watering facilities and coal stored for the locomotives, as well as sidings around the depot. The turntable was removed in 1966 and two of the four shed roads were removed in 1968. From 1958 Long Rock serviced diesel locomotives, which continued after steam traction had ended in 1962. The steam depot was closed in June 1976. = Diesel shed = The east end of 1977 shed (and 57604) A new depot was constructed on the same site as the steam shed, designed for British Rail's fleet of new Intercity 125 fleet (now referred to as High Speed Trains or HSTs). The depot consisted of a 750 ft long maintenance shed, long enough to fit a full IC125 set, along with a fueling lane on the southern side of the shed. Six long sidings were built to the east of the maintenance shed for stabling IC125's when not in use, which also have overhead gantry lights. The mainline next to the depot was also singled at the same time. In total the new depot cost ¬£1.5 million to build, and was ready for use in October 1977. Capacity at the depot was increased in a project that started in 2017 to cater for additional rolling stock maintenance such as additional cars for the Night Riviera sleeper service. The work cost ¬£20m. On 13 April 2019, after the work was completed, an open day was held at the depot in aid of Penlee Lifeboat station and the RNLI. Trains serviced 08410 with a sleeping car from the Night Riviera Allocated to the depot: * - 08645 'St. Piran' is the depot shunter. * and the Mark 3 coaches for the Night Riviera overnight service to London.

Found principally on the limestone cliffs of Kentucky, Tennessee and North Carolina, but it is hardy at the north to zone 4. The largest specimen known is at Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio, 22 m tall and 2.2 m trunk diameter; the tallest known is a slender tree 27 m tall but only 0.55 m trunk diameter, at Plott Cove Research Natural Area, Georgia (Spongberg & Ma 1997; Eastern Native Trees Society). Plants from Alabama have the leaves more densely hairy underneath than those from further north, and are distinguished as Cladrastis kentukea f. tomentosa (Steyermark) Spongberg. Cultivation Cladrastis kentukea is widely grown as an ornamental tree for its attractive flowers, and is locally naturalized in many areas of the eastern United States outside of its restricted native range. It thrives in full sunlight and in well-drained soil, tolerates high pH soils as well as acid situations. The Yellowwood can withstand urban settings and is attractive to birds. A number of cultivars have been selected, including 'Perkin's Pink' (syn. 'Rosea', an invalid name) with pink flowers. Kentucky yellowwood is recommended as one of the best medium-sized trees for cultivation as an ornamental plant in gardens. The only quality that is mentioned is a tendency of the trunk to divide very near the ground, as a multi-trunked tree. bark and low branching habit Uses The name yellowwood derives from its yellow heartwood, used in small amounts for specialist furniture, gunstocks and decorative woodturning. Distinctions Yellowwood won a Pennsylvania Horticultural Society Gold Award in 1994. The Society of Municipal Arborists selected the yellowwood (Cladrastis kentukea or C. lutea) as its Urban Tree of the Year for 2015. Notes References *Andrews, S.

It can be found at wikisource.org/wiki/South_Africa_Act_1909. The Act also made provisions for admitting Rhodesia as a fifth province of the Union in the future, but Rhodesian colonists rejected this option in a referendum held in 1922.See section 150 of South Africa Act. The South Africa Act was the third major piece of legislation passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom with the intent of uniting various British colonies and granting them some degree of autonomy. Earlier, the British North America Act, 1867 had united three colonies (the Province of Canada (which was split into Ontario and Quebec) Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick) and the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, 1900 had united the Australian colonies. Historical background In the aftermath of the Anglo-Boer War (1899‚Äì1902), Britain re-annexed the South African Republic and the Orange Free State, two hitherto independent Boer republics. These new territories, renamed the Transvaal Colony and the Orange River Colony respectively, were added to Britain's existing South African territories, the Cape Colony and Colony of Natal. It was British government policy to encourage these four colonies to come together in closer union; after the grant of responsible government to the Transvaal Colony and Orange River Colony in 1907, this aspiration was one that was also increasingly held by the Afrikaner population. These political forces resulted in the 1908 National Convention, which met on 12 October 1908 and completed its work on 11 May 1909. This Convention settled on the terms and constitution of a governmental, legislative, and economic Union. These proposals were transmitted to the British government, which duly prepared a Bill to give effect to these wishes. The Bill was passed by Parliament on 20 September 1909 and on 20 September 1909 King Edward VII of the United Kingdom proclaimed that the Union of South Africa would be established on 31 May 1910. This Act, which essentially brought into being the South African state as it is known today, served as the South African constitution for over fifty years, during which time the Statute of Westminster greatly increased South Africa's independence from Britain. Although South Africa became a republic in 1961 and left the Commonwealth, the basic structure of the 1909 Act continued to live on in its replacement, the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act (32 of 1961). However, the last vestiges of the 1909 Act finally disappeared in 1983 when the apartheid-era government enacted a new constitution, the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act (110 of 1983). Government structure The provinces of the Union The structure of the government of the Union of South Africa was similar to the government of other British Dominions. A Governor-General of South Africa was appointed to represent the British Monarch, who was also the Monarch of South Africa. Executive power was vested in the Monarch/Governor-General and was exercised on the advice of the Executive Council.See Part III of South Africa Act of 1909 Though not explicitly provided for by the South Africa Act, the office of Prime Minister of South Africa was quickly established as the head of government and, like other government ministers, the Prime Minister was required to be a Member of either House of Parliament. As in other British Dominions, the Governor- General appointed the leader of the largest political party in the lower house of Parliament as Prime Minister. Prime Ministers were also sworn in as Executive Councilors if they were not already members of the Executive Council. Legislative power was vested in a Parliament consisting of the Monarch, a Senate, and a House of Assembly.See section 19 of South Africa Act. For most of the Union's existence, the South Africa Act provided for each Province to have equal representation in the upper house, the Senate, and Senators were chosen by an electoral college made up of the Province's members in the House of Assembly and the members of the provincial legislature. The composition and election of the Senate would later be modified as part of the move towards apartheid and the establishment of the Republic of South Africa. In the lower house of Parliament, the House of Assembly, each Province was represented proportionally according to their respective populations and members were elected from individual districts within a Province. The House of Assembly had more power than the Senate, much like the relationship between the House of Commons and House of Lords. In the case of a disagreement between the Senate and House of Assembly, the Governor-General could convene a joint sitting of the two houses to review the legislation, make amendments, and vote on the bill.See section 63 of the South Africa Act. Because the House of Assembly was much larger than the Senate, the system was designed to protect the stronger position of the House in any joint sitting. A similar method of resolving disagreements exists in the Australian Parliament and the Indian Parliament, but the Australian Senate and the Rajya Sabha are each half the size of the Australian House of Representatives and the Lok Sabha, respectively, whereas the South African Senate was only one-third the size of the South African House of Assembly. Unlike the Australian model (but like the Indian one), no double dissolution election occurred before a joint sitting, further strengthening the position of the House of Assembly and the Prime Minister over the Senate. The Act also established a Supreme Court of South Africa, which served as a unified court system for the Union and consisted of local, provincial, and appellate divisions. The old supreme courts of the provinces became the provincial divisions of the new Supreme Court of South Africa. The appellate division, which was the highest court in the land, was seated at Bloemfontein.See Part VI of South Africa Act, 1909. There was a further appeal to the Privy Council, particularly in Admiralty cases.See section 106 of South Africa Act, 1909 The power judicial review of Parliamentary legislation and administrative acts was the same as in the United Kingdom. In addition, the Supreme Court could review Parliamentary amendments of the entrenched clauses of the South Africa Act of 1909. Each province was governed by an Administrator, appointed by the central government, and had a legislature in the form of a unicameral Provincial Council; four members of the Council joined with the Administrator to form a five-member executive committee that acted as the Province's Cabinet.See Part V, sections 68 to 94 of South Africa Act, 1090. Unlike Canada and Australia, which became dominions through the Federation of British colonies, the South Africa Act created a centralized, unitary state. Each of the four provinces became subordinate entities and had far fewer powers than the Canadian provinces or Australian states. As such, the government of South Africa was quite similar‚Äîfrom a constitutional standpoint‚Äîto the government of the United Kingdom. The Cape Qualified Franchise The Cape Colony had long adhered to a system of non-racial franchise, whereby qualifications for suffrage were applied equally to all males, regardless of race. During the union negotiations, the last Cape Prime Minister, John X. Merriman, and Sir Walter Stanford, representing the Transkei and other African communities, fought unsuccessfully to have this multi-racial franchise system extended to the rest of South Africa. Their attempt failed in the face of opposition from the white governments of the other constituent states, which were determined to entrench white rule.P.M. Laurence: The life of John Xavier Merriman, Richard R. Smith Inc, 1930.P. Lewsen (ed.): Selections from the Correspondence of J.X. Merriman. Cape Town: Van Riebeek Soc. 1963. The South Africa Act permitted the Cape Province to keep a restricted version of its traditional franchise, whereby qualifications limited the suffrage of all citizens according to education and wealth. This led to the Cape being the only province in South Africa where coloureds (mixed-race people) and Black Africans could vote. The act also permitted the Parliament of South Africa to prescribe all other voting qualifications. However, according to the Act, Parliament was given the power to change the Cape's voting requirements by a two-thirds vote. Over the following years, legislation was passed by Parliament to slowly erode this colour-blind voters roll. In 1931, the remaining franchise qualifications, except for the age limit of 21, were removed for white voters, but kept in place for Black and \\"Coloured\\" voters (including the demand that voters be male). In 1956, the Apartheid government removed all remaining suffrage rights for \\"non-whites\\"Christoph Marx: Oxwagon Sentinel: Radical Afrikaner Nationalism and the History of the Ossewabrandwag. LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2009. p.61. in what became known as the Coloured vote constitutional crisis. Overall the Act did little to protect black Africans during the time period in which the South Africa Act was the constitution of South Africa, and ultimately enabled the establishing of fifty years of apartheid and racial discrimination. Other provisions The Act established English and Dutch as the official languages of South Africa, with equal status under the law, and required all government documents and Parliamentary proceedings to be published in both languages.See section 137 of South Africa Act, 1909. In modern times, English remains one of the official languages of the Republic of South Africa. Dutch was extended to include Afrikaans by the Official Languages of the Union Act, 1925, and replaced by Afrikaans in the Constitution of 1961. Bibliography * Brand, Hon.

Central to a community's rape response, RCCs provide a number of services, such as victim advocacy, crisis hotlines, community outreach, and education programs. As social movement organizations, they seek to change social beliefs and institutions, particularly in terms of how rape is understood by medical and legal entities and society at large. There is a great deal of diversity in terms of how RCCs are organized, which has implications for their ideological foundations, roles in their communities, and the services they offer. In the United States, the National Sexual Assault Hotline (1-800-656-HOPE, operated by RAINN) is a partnership by over 1,100 rape crisis centers.  History  The first American RCCs were formed in several states throughout the country in the early 1970s, largely by women associated with the second-wave feminist movement. Central to second-wave feminism was the practice of consciousness raising, which allowed groups of women to speak openly about their experiences with sexual violence and the shortcomings of law enforcement, health care providers, and the criminal justice system to effectively and constructively respond to survivors.Maria Bevacqua, Rape on the Public Agenda: Feminism and the Politics of Sexual Assault (Boston: Northeastern University Press, 2000), 29-30. Prior to the 1970s and 1980s several barriers existed for rape survivors seeking justice, such as the fact that the concept of marital rape did not exist, juries were instructed to be suspicious of the validity of the survivor's accusations, eyewitnesses were required to bring cases to court, and survivor blaming was the norm.Mary P. Koss and Mary R. Harvey, The Rape Victim: Clinical and Community Interventions (Newbury Park: Sage Publications, 1991), 131. Employing a feminist analysis, second-wave anti-rape activists began working to redefine rape as a direct outcome of patriarchy and an illustration of women's subordinate status in society relative to men. Rather than relying on traditional notions of rape as a primarily sexual act committed by deviants who are unknown to their survivors, feminists have emphasized the violence of rape, as well how it is embedded in normal social interactions.Bevacqua, 58. This redefinition effectively politicized rape, framing it as a larger pattern stemming from women's oppression rather than a series of random, unexplainable criminal acts.Patricia Yancey Martin, Rape Work: Victims, Gender, and Emotions in Organization and Community Context (New York and London: Routledge, 2005), 98. From a feminist standpoint, the only way to completely eliminate rape is to create a society where women and men have equal status. Working from this new feminist definition of rape, anti-rape activists began organizing at the grassroots level, forming the first RCCs. Among the first was the Washington D.C. Rape Crisis Center, founded in 1972 by women identifying with the radical branch of the women's movement. The D.C. RCC published a pamphlet entitled How to Start a Rape Crisis Center, which provided a model for other early RCCs to follow.Bevacqua, 74-75. In line with the prevailing values of the women's movement at that time, early RCCs were nonhierarchical, fairly anti- establishment, and were largely staffed by volunteers.Martin, 96-97. In addition to providing services for rape survivors, such as 24-hour crisis hotlines, legal and medical assistance, referrals, emotional support, and counseling, many early RCCs focused their efforts on raising awareness about rape in their communities by organizing public demonstrations and inviting the media to attend.Bevacqua, 75. Such an example is the annual Take Back the Night march, which has become a mainstay in many communities and a means for women to express uncensored anger about sexual violence against women. The efforts of local anti-rape activists and RCCs to redefine and politicize rape were instrumental in getting rape put onto the national agenda. Once the National Organization for Women identified rape as a priority focus, the anti- rape movement gained an even larger organizational base that could mobilize larger numbers of people and lobby for legal reform.Bevacqua, 96-97. Because of efforts by anti-rape activists and RCCs on local, state, and federal levels, the 1970s and 80s saw many important legislative changes that greatly improved the situation for rape survivors. Among these achievements are the criminalization of marital rape, rendering a rape survivor's prior sexual history inadmissible as evidence in court (rape shield law), repealing the requirement for corroboration in rape cases, and eliminating the requirement that survivors must have physically resisted the attack in order to prosecute.Koss and Harvey, 131. Another important development was expanding the legal definition of rape to include forced oral and anal sex,Bevacqua, 98. penetration by a finger or object, and a number of other acts and situations.Martin, 100. Individual activists working with RCCs were often responsible for bringing about these legal successes. For example, in 1980 Anne Pride, director of Pittsburgh Action Against Rape (PAAR) was held in contempt of court for refusing to submit the records of a client to the defence attorney. When the case came to court a mistrial was ruled and the case went to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, which ruled in favour of PAAR. This forced the issue of RC counsellors and confidentiality on the political and legislative agenda. By 1983 there was no legal doubt that RC record would remain confidential. Early RCCs also sought to publicize the problematic manner in which law enforcement, health care providers, the criminal justice system, and the media responded to rape. RCCs would write letters to newspapers, hold press conferences, buy radio and television ads, and distribute flyers to draw negative attention to various actors who committed disservices to rape survivors.Martin, 98. Among their primary targets were law enforcement and hospitals.Nancy A. Matthews, Confronting Rape: The Feminist Anti-Rape Movement and the State (London and New York: Routledge, 1994), 11. They criticized police officers for being unresponsive to rape survivors and perpetrating what they called a ‚Äúsecond rape. For example, it was not uncommon at the time for police officers to question rape survivors about their sexual history or accuse them of provoking their attack.Matthews, 11. Hospitals received criticism for their treatment of rape survivors, as they had no infrastructure to appropriately treat them and physicians often minimized the seriousness of rape survivors‚Äô injuries.Koss and Harvey, 128. Seen as a threat rather than a resource, RCCs largely had a combative relationship with mainstream organizations, a trend that has since changed. Poor relations between RCCs and mainstream organizations eventually became unproductive as law enforcement and physicians would refuse RCC advocates access to rape survivors.Martin, 98. Now most RCCs coordinate their activities with law enforcement, hospitals, the criminal justice system, and other mainstream organizations. RCCs also provide mainstream organizations with training and education and work to develop protocols for them to follow.Martin, 161. The level of cooperation between RCCs and mainstream organizations and how responsibilities are allocated among them vary from community to community. Structure and Organization While the goals of RCCs have remained largely unchanged since their creation in the 1970s, they have undergone a number of structural changes. Among these changes is the phenomenon of RCCs moving toward more professionalization and hierarchy and away from the radical activism that defines their roots.Rebecca Campbell, Charlene K. Baker, and Terri L. Mazurek, \\"Remaining Radical? Organizational Predictors of Rape Crisis Centers' Social Change Initiatives,\\" American Journal of Community Psychology 26, no. 3 (1998), 477. Many RCCs, rather than being freestanding collectives, are incorporated into the mainstream organizations that they once worked against, such as hospitals or other social services agencies. These trends are related to the political climate and also the availability of government money to fund their activities.Martin, 112. Despite the fact that RCCs now more closely resemble mainstream organizations, they still occupy an important place in the anti-rape movement. When dealing with rape survivors, the fact that RCCs have no interest other than in providing emotional support and assistance to survivors distinguishes them from physicians who are primarily concerned with treating injuries, law enforcement officers who are primarily concerned with ascertaining facts, or prosecutors who primarily concerned with building a case. RCCs are further separated from mainstream organizations by their consistent efforts to reform how these organizations respond to rape, primarily through the provision of training in appropriate rape definitions and responses.Martin, 111-112. This cooperation between RCCs and mainstream organizations represents a shift in RCC strategies; they have moved from being outside critics of mainstream organizations to indoctrinating allies with them. A close relationship between RCCs and mainstream organizations leads to various opportunities and constraints that affect the quality of a community's responsiveness to rape. Among the opportunities are access to rape survivors that first approach mainstream organizations, the ability to teach mainstream organizations about rape, and the ability to develop responsive interorganizational protocols. Constraints include the inability to publicly criticize the unresponsiveness of mainstream organizations, an increased likelihood of cooptation to mainstream views, a shift of the focus toward survivors and away from social and political change, and a greater tolerance for mainstream unresponsiveness.Martin, 103. Depending on the particular RCC, the community in which is works, and its relationship to mainstream organizations, there will be different situations in terms of which opportunities or constraints present themselves. Nonetheless, this situation suggests a much-changed picture from the radical origins of the RCC. While RCCs still employ feminist discourse and engage in political activities, such as demonstrations and lobbying, they have largely lost the radical edge that once defined them.Campbell et al., 477. Communities with RCCs that are integrated into a network with mainstream organizations are the most responsive to rape survivors.Martin, 144-145. Each community has different resources, but some relevant mainstream organizations for such a network include hospitals, law enforcement, prosecutors, feminist groups, university rape awareness programs, mental health centers, and battered women's shelters. The most effective networks for fostering a community's responsiveness are those that are coordinated either by the RCC or the RCC in conjunction with the police.Martin, 161. Coordination by the RCC entails establishing the linkages between the various organizations in order to streamline the delivery of services to the rape survivor. Overly centralized networks are generally not as responsive as those that have more interaction between all members of the network.Martin, 159. Overall, RCCs provide a central role in managing a community's response to rape and foster increased communication among the various factions that deal with rape survivors.  Typical services offered  Each RCC is unique in the range of services it provides to both survivors and the community. Professionals employed by the RCC, many of whom hold an academic degree in women's studies, psychology, public health, social work, or another relevant discipline, provide these services. Volunteers are also essential to the provision of RCC services and are heavily utilized for a number of essential tasks.Martin, 114-115. Both RCC employees and volunteers are required to undergo a 40-hour training during which they learn a great deal about societal, legal, and cultural aspects of rape.Rebecca Campbell, Emotionally Involved: The Impact of Researching Rape (New York: Routledge, 2002), 153. =Survivor Services= *Crisis hotlines are 24-hour 7 day a week phone lines that are offered by almost every RCC. Rape survivors can call and receive crisis intervention counseling free of charge, which may entail comforting the survivor, dispelling common rape myths, explaining legal and medical options, or providing referrals for other useful resources. Volunteers often serve as crisis counselors for RCCs.Matthews, xv. *Counseling services, either short-term or long-term may be provided by RCCs to rape survivors in order to promote their psychological well being in the aftermath of a traumatic event.Campbell et al., 459. *Legal advocates may educate survivors about the legal process, assist them with getting protective orders against their assailant, and accompany survivors to meetings with the prosecutor or to their court date.Matthews, xv. The criminal justice system can be traumatic for some rape survivors and so legal advocates are present as a source of support.Martin, 72. RCCs are generally neutral in terms of encouraging survivors to take legal action against their assailants. *Medical advocates may educate survivors about forensic medical options and accompany survivors to the hospital to have a sexual assault evidentiary examination.Campbell, 152-153. While RCCs are generally neutral in terms of whether or not to proceed with the legal process, they often encourage all survivors to get this examination so that if they later decide to prosecute, they will have evidence to help build their case. *Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners (SAFE) are medical providers who have received special training to conduct sexual assault evidentiary exams for rape survivors. Historically these providers were nurses and referred to as SANEs (Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners), but nowadays it is recognized that physicians and physician assistants may perform the services. Not all, but many SAFE/SANE programs are coordinated by RCCs rather than hospitals. SAFE/SANEs are on call 24-hours a day and will arrive at the hospital emergency room within an hour of the rape survivor's arrival. In addition to the collection of forensic evidence, they also provide crisis intervention counseling, STI testing, drug testing if drug-facilitated rape is suspected, and emergency contraception.Rebecca Campbell, Stephanie M. Townsend, Susan M. Long, Kelly E. Kinnison, Emily M. Pulley, S. Bibiana Adams, and Sharon M. Wasco, \\"Services Provided by SANE Programs,\\" Research in Nursing & Health 29 (2006): 385-386.Linda Ledray, \\"Forensic Medical Evidence: The Contributions of the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE),\\" in Rape Investigation Handbook edited by John O. Savino and Brent E. Turvey (Elsevier, 2005), 119-146. =Community Services= *Education programs targeting various members of the community is commonplace among RCC activities. RCCs regularly go into schools, faith-based organizations, neighborhood associations, universities, and other places of social gathering to inform people about rape in their community, foster a feminist understanding of rape, dispel common myths about rape, and raise awareness about available services and resources.Martin, 105. *Training of law enforcement, health care providers, and attorneys has been an essential part of improving mainstream responsiveness to rape. RCCs use their expertise to develop programs that improve how rape survivors are treated in legal and medical settings. RCCs also often develop and train mainstream organizations in protocols that create a standard for their collaboration.Martin, 102. *Prevention programs undertaken by RCCs may be part of their educational programs, including teaching definitions of sexual violence, attempts to change survivor-blaming attitudes, engaging in role plays, fostering problem solving strategies, and even teaching self-defense to women so that they may fight off a potential assailant. Part of RCC efforts at prevention entail teaching women rape avoidance, i.e. behavioral strategies to reduce one's chances of getting raped.Stephanie Townsend and Rebecca Campbell, \\"Identifying Common Practices in Community-Based Rape Prevention Programs,\\" Journal of Prevention & Intervention in the Community 36, no. 1/2 (2008): 123. *Writing legislation for lawmakers is a means by which RCCs have been able to make important reforms and infuse rape laws with a feminist perspective. RCCs are in a better position to write such laws because lawmakers often lack experience with and knowledge of rape.Martin, 105. *Initiating projects is a way that RCCs can spearhead efforts to get more resources in their communities. RCCs are often seen as ideal candidates to undertake the process of mobilizing support for a particular issue, delegating tasks to various community stakeholders, and applying for funding. *Outreach programs advertise a Center's existence in the surrounding community. Fundraising and awareness campaigns aid communities in coming together to end sexual violence. In recent years RCCs have begun working on outreach projects with faith based communities, LGBTQ communities, and other groups of individuals who share a cultural identity. Some outreach projects specifically serve non-English speaking people in their respective communities. Funding RCCs may receive funding from a number of sources and funding can vary greatly for each RCC depending on its location, if it is affiliated with a host agency, and the type of host agency. RCCs housed in hospitals and county social service and health agencies generally have more funding than those situated in mental health centers, battered women's shelters, and legal-justice organizations.Martin, 112. The funding situation today has changed a great deal from that of the early 1970s when RCCs were just beginning to start up. Operating on small budgets, membership fees and donations from the community made up the majority of early RCC funds.Koss and Harvey, 138. Federal funding sources for sexual assault started to become available from the mid-1970s through the 1990s, which has had implications for how RCCs are organized. To be eligible for federal funding, RCCs have to demonstrate that they had support from the community, organizational stability, as well as the ability to maintain programs beyond initial funding. These funding requirements have been a major force pushing RCCs to become more professionalized and to model themselves on a social service agency structure.Koss and Harvey, 138. Some of the current major sources of federal funding available to support rape crisis centers are the Violence Against Women Act of 1994(VAWA), the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (VOCA) and the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant (PHHSBG). VAWA allocated $1.6 billion to states from 1994‚Äì2000, with about one third designated for survivors of sexual assault.Martin, 100. These funds are administered by the Office on Violence Against Women in the United States Department of Justice. VOCA, also administered by the Department of Justice, established a fund made up of fines paid by offenders. These funds are then allocated to organizations providing services to survivors, with priority going to those addressing sexual assault, spousal abuse, and child abuse. VOCA funds are also available for statewide programs that provide compensation to survivors.Bevacqua 168-169. The PHHSBG is administered by the CDC to fund a number of preventive health services and programs, such as those involving rape education and prevention.Martin, 99. While the bulk of PHHS funds go to chronic disease, sex offense represented 8.5% of the designated funds in 2010, totaling over $7 million.CDC , 2010 Overview - Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant (PHHSBG), https://www.cdc.gov/phhsblockgrant/funding/blockgrant10.htm Other federal sources that provide or have provided funding to RCCs are the National Institute of Mental Health's National Center for the Prevention of Rape, the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration, and the Department of Labor‚Äôs Comprehensive Employment and Training Act.Koss and Harvey, 138. In addition to federal funding, state or county funding, funding from other non- profit organizations, corporate funding, and private donations represent possible avenues for RCC financial support. Some states and counties have, for example, set up sexual assault funds through tax revenues as a means to express local support for the important services that RCCs provide to their communities.Martin, 152. Non-profits that administer grants for a number of social programs, such as the United Way of America, may fund RCCs or other organizations providing services for survivors of physical and sexual violence. Corporations have also stepped up to fund, or attempt to fund, RCCs. For example, the Playboy Foundation was among the most visible corporate donors for the women‚Äôs movement in the mid- to late-1970s, but many groups refused this funding for political and ideological reasons.Matthews, 58. RCCs also rely on the funds that they can generate themselves, through soliciting donations and fundraising efforts. As with many social service agencies, RCCs are virtually in a constant state of trying to secure funding so that they can maintain their program activities.

In c.1973 an electric multiple unit maintenance depot was constructed as part of the electrification of the Great Northern rail route. A new train-wash and additional maintenance building for Class 700 units has been constructed on the site of the old Coronation sidings, together with an underframe cleaning building alongside the current shed. Site history =1850 & 1866 GNR engine sheds= A two road dead ended shed was established by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) in 1850, on the east side of the station. The shed closed in 1866 when the nearby Wood Green shed had been built, and was later demolished; making way for expansion of Hornsey station. In 1866 another two road dead ended shed was established (\\"Wood Green shed\\"), ~1 km north of the station on the west side of the track adjacent to a new water works, and west of Wood Green common. The shed closed in 1899. =1899 GNR eight road engine shed= In 1899 an 8 track shed was constructed to the east of Hornsey station, together with a turntable, coal stage and water tank; the shed was connected via the Ferme Park sidings. The shed provided locos for shunting in the yard and nearby Ferme Park sidings, as well as goods workings across London to the south via Snow Hill tunnel. Hornsey locos shared suburban duties over the southern end of the GNR with locos from Kings Cross Top Shed. Under British Railways the facility received the shed code 34B. The depot's initial allocation was primarily GNR Class N1s, GNR Class N2s and GNR Class J13s. With the passing of steam, in 1961 the shed was converted for use with diesel traction, and continued in use until the early 1970s, closing in May 1971. The shed's duties were passed to nearby Finsbury Park diesel depot. In 1973 the shed was converted for use as an Overhead Line (OHL) maintenance depot, as part of the works for the Great Northern electrification. =1973 Great Northern electrification EMU depot= In the 1970s the site was extensively rebuilt; part of the Ferme Park sidings south of the shed were cleared, and a new Electric multiple unit depot constructed;Ordnance Survey. 1:10560; 1967-8. 1:10000; 1973-6, 1981-4, Hornsey EMU depot, 1975- the work was done as part of the Great Northern electrification; a new maintenance shed was constructed with six roads, each capable of holding an eight car train. At the same time the old loco shed was converted to use as an Overhead Line (OHL) maintenance depot, stabling an OHL repair train. After 1973 the depot code became HE. In 2008 First Capital Connect opened a 'Driver Training Academy' at the depot in 2008, equipped with British Rail Class 319 and Class 365 driving simulators. The simulators became operational in 2009. =Thameslink Class 700 maintenance depot= In 2009 Network Rail initiated plans to build a new EMU depot at Hornsey, as part of the Thameslink Programme. After consultations, revised plans for a smaller depot were submitted in 2011. The depot has been open since 2016. Modern facilities EMU maintenance building (left) and sidings.

Stillhouse Hollow Dam and the reservoir are both managed by the Fort Worth District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The reservoir was officially impounded in 1968, and serves to provide flood control for the communities downstream. The lake also functions as a water supply for several of the surrounding communities. Stillhouse Hollow Lake is a popular recreational destination. Stillhouse Hollow Lake is also commonly known as Stillhouse Hollow Reservoir. Due to the extraordinary drought condition in Central Texas, Stillhouse Hollow experienced the lowest ever recorded lake level in 2011, significantly exceeding its prior minimum of 610 ft set in 1989. At the close of 2011, the level of the lake stood at just over 605 ft. Fish populations Stillhouse Hollow Lake has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in Stillhouse Hollow Lake include largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, white bass, catfish, and crappie.

The pier is the home of the Cromer Lifeboat Station and the Pavilion Theatre. History There are records of a pier in Cromer back as far as 1391, although then it was in the form of a jetty. In the year 1582, Queen Elizabeth I, in a letter to the inhabitants of Cromer granted rights to export wheat, barley and malt with the proceeds to be used for the maintenance and well-being of the pier and the town of Cromer. In 1822, a long jetty was built (of cast iron, made by Hase of Saxthorpe) but this structure lasted just 24 years before it was totally destroyed in a storm. This jetty was replaced by another wooden structure but this time it was a little longer being . This jetty soon became very popular for promenading. A keeper was employed to keep order; there were strict rules applied including no smoking, and ladies were required to retire from the jetty by 9 PM. The last wooden jetty survived until 1897, when it was damaged beyond repair after a coal boat smashed into it. It was dismantled and the timber sold for ¬£40. For a period of time from this date Cromer was without a pier but to end this situation the \\"Pier Commissioners\\" planned to replace the old wood structure with a more fashionable structure. In 1902, the new pier was completed and opened to the public. This new pier was designed by Douglass and Arnott and the construction was carried out by Alfred Thorne. The new pier was long and had cost ¬£17,000 to build. In the early years the pier consisted of glass-screened shelters and a bandstand on the end of the pier. The shelters were roofed over in 1905 to form a pavilion; the bandstand was later replaced with a stage and proscenium arch. From 1907 this was used to accommodate the latest craze of roller-skating. The pier is owned and maintained by North Norfolk District Council which undertook responsibility for running and funding after the local government re-organisation of 1974. Since that time, the District Council have carried out a number of major repair and refurbishments, the most recent being completed in 2013. In March 2015, the pier was voted Pier of the Year 2015 by the National Piers Society.

Repairs included replacement of the metal main trusses and cross braces.EDP news report Retrieved 8 October 2012 The pier was damaged during the storm surge of 5 December 2013. However, the repair work just completed allowed the main structure to withstand the main force of the surge, although there was damage to parts of the walkway and other buildings. Decking boards were lifted with damage to the souvenir shop, the box office and the flooring of the Pavilion Theatre. The pier was closed to the public on safety grounds until repairs were completed, allowing the theatre to resume its Christmas show programme on 12 December 2013 and allowing public access to the pier, and the RNLI safe access to the lifeboat station at the pier-end.EDP item Retrieved 15 December 2013 An initial accessment of the damage to the pier made indicated repair costs would be in the tens of thousands of pounds, but within nine days this figure had escalated to the hundreds of thousands.

Biography Evans was born in Madras, India, in 1858 to English parents, Reverend E. J. and Caroline Taylor Evans. Educated in London, he received his bachelor of arts degree in London from Borough Road College. After receiving his degree, he became a teacher and Presbyterian minister. He then spent four years teaching at Earls Barton in England. He came to North America in 1883, where he initially lived in Canada for less than a year.Pittman, Kitty. \\"Evans, Arthur Grant, (1858-1928).\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. A previous citation indicates that Evans originally intended to work as a missionary among the Cherokee Indians. The Mills article states that in 1887, he was ordained as a Presbyterian minister, and began pastoring at a church in Oswego, Kansas and later at churches in Pendleton, Oregon and Leadville, Colorado. Neither source mentions a connection to the Cherokee Male Seminary or Robert L. Owen, nor do they indicate a rationale for Evans showing up in Muskogee in time to either be appointed to Kendall College or to marry his wife. Prior to becoming the president at Oklahoma University in 1908, he served as the president of Henry Kendall College in Muskogee, Oklahoma, for ten years. During his time at Kendall College, he was awarded a Doctor of Divinity (D. D.) degree. When Oklahoma became a state in 1907, the first governor, Charles N. Haskell, made several changes to the staff of the then territorial college. His most notable change was the firing of the university's first president, David Ross Boyd. Evans was Haskell's appointment for president of the university as Evans was also a Democrat and prohibitionist. Many people lost confidence in the new state university after the Oklahoma government fired President Boyd. Because of this, nearly 1,500 students went to out-of-state universities over the next few years. Following Dr. Boyd's dismissal in 1908, the campus enrollment declined nearly 20% and it declined another 11% between 1910 and 1911. Evans Hall anchors the southern end of the North Oval and is one of the oldest buildings on campus. Evans' tenure as university president was marked by some notable achievements, including the construction of the third administration building. That administration building built during his tenure, which is a classic example of the Collegiate Gothic architectural style of campus, was later renamed in Evans' honor. The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture called his reorganization of the university into colleges and schools as perhaps his most important accomplishment. The College of Fine Arts, the College of Engineering, and the College of Arts and Sciences were all started between 1908 and 1911. He promoted the expansion of the Oklahoma University School of Medicine and presided over its merger with the Epworth College of Medicine. Also, the School of Law, led by Julien Monnet, was established during his tenure. In 1909, Evans was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree. He retired as OU president in 1911. Julien Monnet, Dean of the School of Law, was named Interim President. In 1912, Stratton D. Brooks became the 3rd President of OU.\\"OU Chronological History.\\" Accessed August 17, 2018.

They are best known for their debut single \\"Torner√≤\\" which became an international no. one hit in 1975.  History  The group was founded by five musicians originating from Campania, Southern Italy. Originally called La Nuova Frontiera, the band initially performed in clubs and beach resorts in the Amalfi Coast. In 1974, during a concert in Nocera Inferiore, they caught the attention of Elio Palumbo who helped them sign a contract with the Italian label Yep Record in Rome. At that point, the band had changed the name to I Santo California. They released their debut single, \\"Torner√≤\\", at the end of 1974. A sentimental love ballad, \\"Torner√≤\\" was a major hit in Italy and Switzerland where it spent multiple weeks at no. one in 1975. In Switzerland, \\"Torner√≤\\" became the best-selling single of the year. It also peaked at number five in Germany and Austria. The band's debut album charted within the top twenty in Italy. The follow-up single, \\"Un angelo\\", peaked at no. two in the Italian charts and no. ten in Switzerland in the spring of 1976. The band continued the international success with \\"Dolce amore mio\\" which reached no. six in Italy and no. three in Switzerland. In 1977, I Santo California took part to the Sanremo Music Festival with the song \\"Monica\\", finishing third. The song quickly turned into another international hit for the band. In 1978, they scored their last top ten hit in Italy with \\"Manuela, amore!\\". After that, I Santo California's popularity decreased. The band continued to record and perform but struggled to maintain the same degree of commercial success. Following a break of fourteen years, in 1994 the band released a new album 1994 Per un mondo migliore.

History NER Class J21 No.65110 in ex-works condition at Heaton Shed, 1954 Ex-NER No.26500/BR Class ES1 at Heaton Shed Originally built by the North Eastern Railway to provide steam locomotives serving principally the extensive Heaton marshalling yards and freight traffic, but also a considerable proportion of main line and local passenger traffic from . The location meant that it provided motive power to the and steep Riverside Branch. Unliked by crews due to the need to pass through three tunnels and the resultant toxic smoke in their cabs, in 1905 it was electrified using 750 VDC technology, with power supplied via both overhead catenary and, within the tunnels, third-rail. Both of the BTH/Brush 640 hp (BR Class ES1) locomotives were based at Heaton, designed as a Bo-Bo with central cab. They worked from the shed until 1967. Coded 52B in the NE Region (Newcastle District) under British Railways, in 1954 it had an allocation of 95 locomotives, comprising:16x 4-6-2; 17x 2-6-2; 1x 4-4-0; 14x 2-6-0 (9 LNE + 5 LMS-type); 14x 0-6-0; 12x 2-6-2T; 1x 0-6-2T; 18x 0-6-0T; and 2x ES1's. Present After demolition and redevelopment to diesel traction in the 1960s by British Railways, today the depot is operated by Northern, and mostly houses stock operated by them and Grand Central. The depot code is HT. The basic allocation consists of Class 142 Class 156 and British Rail Class 158 diesel multiple units operated by Northern. Although not allocated to the depot, Class 91, Class 180 and Class 800 units, as well as HSTs may also be visible with Grand Central, TransPennine Express and London North Eastern Railway storing units and/or contracting out maintenance at this depot. Northern Class 158s, Class 144s and Class 150s also regularly visit Heaton for maintenance. Network Rail's New Measurement Train is allocated to Heaton, and returns there regularly for scheduled maintenance. Maintenance on its recording equipment is carried out at the Railway Technical Centre in Derby. Sewage and clean out Heaton is used by the main express operator of the East Coast Main Line to store stock overnight. In 2004‚Äì06, this led to a dispute between the RMT and then operator GNER. Legally in the UK, train operators are allowed to discharge of sewage per carriage per journey, onto the railtrack. Most Mk3 carriages have only holding tanks, not fully compliant toilet tanks. Further, Heaton then had no toilet clean-out facilities. However, in the 2000s both the RMT and politicians were concerned at the environmental impact of this legacy issue. In 2006 the RMT agreed waste tank and clean out developments at Heaton with GNER, plus new clean out procedures at all other depots, to solve an ongoing dispute over sewage spray. Access The depot is closed to the general public. Only those with an official pass can access the depot, or those attending the occasional open days organised by Northern. The nearest station, from which the depot can also be seen, is Chillingham Road Metro station, whilst the nearest mainline station is .

She is introduced as the matriarch figure of the Butcher family, Frank Butcher's (Mike Reid) elderly mother. She is portrayed as a battle-axe, tough and interfering. Her most notable storyline first aired in 1990, when the character is used to portray descent into Alzheimer's disease. Dor√© opted to leave the serial that same year; Mo was written out of the soap making her last appearance in November. Mo was killed off in 1992, but her death was not screened. Storylines =Backstory= Mo was born in Walthamstow in 1921. During her teenage years she married Chike Butcher who worked for London Transport. Chike got promoted to transport inspector at the age of forty-five, and Mo felt she had achieved status. They had two children, Frank (Mike Reid) and Joan (Mary Miller). Following Chike's death, Mo never remarried; she busied herself with caring for Frank's children, particularly when their mother June died in 1987. =1988‚Äì1990= Mo moves to Albert Square in September 1988 to be near Frank and his family. She disapproves of the way Frank is raising his teenage children Ricky (Sid Owen) and Diane (Sophie Lawrence) and immediately clashes with his fianc√©e Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement), bringing up her past reputation as a prostitute and threatening to put a halt to their impending marriage. During her time in Walford Mo has an array of jobs; she first works in the kitchens of The Queen Victoria, then on Arthur Fowler's (Bill Treacher) fruit and veg stall and then in Ali Osman's (Nejdet Salih) caf√©. However all her jobs come to an end due to her interference, causing her employers no end of grief. Fiercely loyal to her family, Mo sticks by her son through his financial woes and tries her best to help him out by offering Frank her late husband Chike's life insurance money. She is shown to be extremely fond of her favourite grandchild Janine (Rebecca Michael) and takes a hand in persuading Frank to bring her to Walford to live with him in 1989 (Janine had previously been living with Frank's eldest daughter Clare outside Walford). Despite being protective and doting on her family, Mo is not blinkered to their faults, even in a rare moment supporting Pat in her decision to put Janine in therapy when her behaviour becomes out of control. Mo eventually warms to Pat, seeing that Frank does love her, and arranges for them to be married in great East End style, complete with a horse and carriage, Pearly Kings, a street party and jellied eels. Her busybody attitude results in few friendships in Walford for Mo, but she becomes close to Marge Green (Pat Coombs), despite belittling her. Together they participate in the Walford Brownies, but Mo (a Brown Owl) is sacked for lying about her age. She also takes on the local council over the proposed closure of the community centre. In 1990, she becomes increasingly forgetful, and is eventually diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease after flooding the B&B;, setting fire to the house, and planning to visit her brother Sidney in Bexley Heath (having forgotten that Sidney had died years previously). Frank feels unable to look after her, and sent her to live with his sister Joan, who looks after Mo in Colchester until her death on New Year's Eve 1992. After Frank dies in 2008, his solicitor reads the will in The Vic and presents Janine with Mo's diary from 1990, which is left to her as per Frank's instructions. Creation and development 1988 was a year of change on-screen in EastEnders. Since the show's inception in 1985 and up until 1988, one of the soap's main focal points, The Queen Victoria (The Vic) public house, had been inhabited by the Watts family; however, actors Leslie Grantham and Anita Dobson who played landlords Den and Angie Watts resigned in 1988, meaning the soap's bosses had to find a new family to inhabit the Vic. Pat Wicks (Pam St Clement) and her boyfriend Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) were instilled as the new landlords, and along with Frank came his family, including his mother Mo (Edna Dor√©), who moved to Walford in September. Mo was portrayed as a battle-axe. Author Hilary Kingsley has described Mo as a \\"tough, interfering busybody with a will of iron and a face of stone [...] To her grandchildren she was always indulgent, but to Frank she was always the boss, a woman with a whim or iron.\\" Kingsley surmised that \\"only slowly did Walford begin to see a softer side to hard bitten old Mo\\". Kingsley described Mo as a woman who sought status, suggesting that she wished to be \\"Queen Bee\\" when she moved to Walford and regarded Frank's new wife Pat as \\"nothing more than a pushy interloper\\". Initial storylines centred upon clashes between Pat and Mo, with Frank trying to find a compromise between the bickering women in his life. Kingsley has commented that \\"gradually some sort of compromise was worked out and slowly Mo became more human.\\" In 1990, a topical storyline was aired in which Mo was given Alzheimer's disease. During the year, Mo was shown to grow increasingly more forgetful, and after tests, Frank was informed that Mo was suffering with dementia. The storyline was scripted to show the effects on a family when a parent/loved one suffers from Alzheimer's. By November that year, Mo was in advanced stages of mental deterioration. It was at this stage that the character was written out of EastEnders, Edna Dor√© having decided to end her contract. On-screen, Mo was sent to live with her daughter in Colchester, having convinced herself that Frank wanted to kill her. Writer Colin Brake has suggested that the storyline had to be curtailed earlier than they would have liked due to Dor√©'s desire to leave. Commenting on her time in the soap and the reasons for her departure in 1999, Dor√© said, \\"I shall always be grateful to EastEnders. It gave me recognition. It was a marvellous opportunity to be known everywhere, although it totally changes your life. For a while I couldn't even go shopping without being stopped. But compared with the theatre or film it was lacking in job satisfaction because it was so quick. I did it for a couple of years. I didn't want to stay so long that I wouldn't be considered for other parts.\\" Mo was killed off-screen in 1992, succumbing to Alzheimer's; her death was confirmed on-screen in the New Year's Eve episode of 1992. Dor√© was at a New Year's Eve party when she discovered her character's fate. She commented in 2001, \\"I was at a New Year's Eve party when someone came up to me and said, 'Have you seen, you've been killed off?' And I heaved a sigh of relief and had another drink. Still I can't complain. I had a good time at EastEnders and the one advantage of having been in a soap is that I get far better paid for my roles now.\\"  Reception  Edna Dor√©'s portrayal of Mo's descent into Alzheimer's has been described as \\"deeply moving\\" by John Millar of the Daily Record. Former executive producer of EastEnders, Michael Ferguson, has suggested that Mo suffering from Alzheimer's in 1990 gave people permission to talk about an illness \\"that had been almost too distressing to discuss in public before.\\" He alleged that viewers informed him that EastEnders had given them a shorthand \\"like Mo\\" to discuss Alzheimer's. According to writer Colin Brake, the storyline involving Mo and the unruly Brownies was intended to be fun, but references to Brownies behaving badly caused great offence to the Brownie movement, and an official complaint was made and upheld. The broadcasting commission said the EastEnders Brownie episodes \\"came near to parody,\\" were unfair to the Brownies and harmed the Girl Guides' image. The BBC had to make a public apology for the misinterpretation of the movement. Brake has suggested that the mishap was a \\"salutary lesson to those [...] in the script department to be very vigilant in ensuring, as far as possible, that no group or individual was offended by an unintentional slight in a script.\\" References EastEnders characters Television characters introduced in 1988 Female characters in television Fictional characters with dementia ","title":"Mo Butcher"},{"id":"5735853","text":"Freelancers Union is a non-profit organization in the United States of America. The organization provides advocacy, programming and curated insurance benefits for freelancers through partnerships. The union promotes information through monthly meetings. Freelancers Union current Executive Director & President is Rafael Espinal. https://www.freelancersunion.org/about/rafael- espinal/ The Freelancers Union should not be confused with a trade union, and is not affiliated with the AFL-CIO or any other organization that represents workers and negotiates on behalf of their members (workers).  Membership  Membership in Freelancers Union is more than 500,000 nationwide, with half in New York State. This includes people who work as freelancers, consultants, independent contractors, temps, part-timers, and contingent employees, and those who are otherwise self-employed. This segment of workers makes up one- third of the American workforce. Nearly 25,000 people have purchased insurance through the organization's former Freelancers Insurance Company. Founding Because they are employed in nontraditional arrangements, independent workers do not have access to employer-based health care insurance. To address this, Working Today, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, launched Freelancers Union in 2001. Sara Horowitz founded Working Today in New York City in 1995, in order to represent the needs and concerns of the growing independent workforce. Before founding Working Today ‚Äì Freelancers Union, Horowitz was a labor law attorney in private practice and a union organizer with SEIU 1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees Union. Freelancers Union has created a portable benefits delivery system, linking benefits to individuals rather than to employers, so independent workers can maintain benefits as they move from job to job and project to project. The organization also tries to increase the visibility of independent workers, bringing issues that concern freelancers to the attention of media and policy makers. From tax relief (independent workers bear a greater tax burden than traditional employees) to unemployment and worker‚Äôs compensation, Freelancers Union advocates for legal reform on these issues. Freelancers Union also provides its members with online tools, business management information, networking opportunities, group discount terms with various vendors or partners, and other assistance in working successfully as independents. Membership is free of charge, as is members' access to the union's meetings, tools and basic information. Members pay fees for certain events, seminars and other services, as well as premiums if they elect to buy health insurance through the union. History In 2003, a re-branding of Working Today‚Äôs Portable Benefits Network was launched. The new ‚Äúpilot‚Äù program, called The Freelancers Union, offers freelancers membership services like affordable health care, life insurance, and a forum for discussion on what freelancing is like in the current economy. Though freelancers could not officially unionize, the group worked to provide a ‚Äúcollective‚Äù platform for advocacy, and it was geared to appeal specifically to its namesake: freelancers. The updated Freelancers Union began to use \\"slogans to combine squishy ideals of teamwork, justice, and co- operation‚Äî'Organize and Mobilize:' 'Working for the Radical Notion of Fairness'‚Äîwith a Generation Y self-centeredness: 'There‚Äôs an I in Union,'\\" appealing directly to the modern freelance audience. Freelancers Insurance Company (FIC) was founded in 2008. To create the Freelancers Insurance Company, Ms. Horowitz needed to persuade investors to put up $17 million. The Rockefeller Foundation and others gave $7 million in grants, and additional foundations joined in, agreeing to lend the rest at a 3 percent interest rate.‚Äù FIC began offering health insurance to members of Freelancers Union on January 1, 2009. As a fully licensed insurance company in the state of New York, FIC sold a group insurance policy to Freelancers Union, thereby covering eligible members of Freelancers Union living in New York. FIC offered 5 health plan designs, including three copay-based designs and two high deductible plans. All plans were PPOs (including out of network coverage) using a nationwide network provided through BlueCross BlueShield. Freelancers could enroll in an FIC plan by first demonstrating to Freelancers Union that they met certain criteria ‚Äì continuing the same process that had been in place for years under Freelancers Union's Portable Benefits Network. A newly formed Political Action Committee made its political debut in September 2009. Canvassing potential candidates via questionnaire in order to find the right people to align and endorse. ‚ÄúWe started the PAC because if you want to change you have to be politically involved.\\" The ‚ÄúGet Paid, Not Played‚Äù Campaign was launched in October 2010 and marked the Freelancers Union‚Äôs latest effort to publicize the repercussions of late or lack of payment to freelancers. The World‚Äôs Longest Invoice campaign followed, a tandem effort to create publicity in order to pass the ‚ÄúFreelancer Payment Protection Act, which [gives] the self-employed many of the same remedies for non-payment that regular employees now have, including the right to file grievances with the state department of labor.\\" The Freelancers Union-funded medical clinics opened in 2013. The spaces were created to function ‚Äùas the first medical home and serve members of the Freelancers Union Insurance Company.\\" With yoga, iPads and no co-pays and deductibles, the 408 Jay Street clinic, housed in a renovated 6,000 square-foot building, offered same-day services, nutrition and cooking classes as well as text messaging communications from doctors. The Freelancers Union created the National Benefits Program that same year with a 2014 launch, a program providing ‚Äúa curated selection of health insurance options for freelancers across the country.\\" This new tool, the first of its kind, allowed freelancers to search by zip code for benefits such as ‚Äú401k plan, dental insurance, disability insurance, life insurance, liability insurance and health insurance that are available to independent workers in their area.\\" Health insurance was scheduled to become available via platform in all 50 states by ‚Äúthe November national enrollment period.\\" At the end of 2014, Freelancers Insurance Company ended offering insurance coverage. In 2016, Uber announced a new ‚Äúgroundbreaking agreement to bring needed supports to Uber drivers in New York City.\\" A new association, The Independent Driver‚Äôs Guild, ‚Äùwas created to ‚Äúpush for labor protections for the company‚Äôs independent contractors.‚Äù The Freelancers Union was chosen to ‚Äúadvise Uber on strategies for building a nationwide portable benefits platform for drivers, bringing safety net protections to tens of thousands of hardworking men and women.\\" Policy Sara Horowitz, Freelancers Union's founder, does not believe in a Canadian-style single-payer health care system, she said on WNYC's radio program, The Brian Lehrer Show. She believes that individuals should be able to buy insurance through groups like the Freelancers Union that would give them bargaining power with insurance companies. They should get assistance through vouchers or a refundable tax credit if they cannot afford it, she insists. Under federal labor laws, the Freelancers Union cannot engage in collective bargaining over wages or working conditions because it is not a certified union. The entertainment unions can today, because they were grandfathered in. Collective bargaining is a \\"moment in history\\", as Horowitz told Lehrer. Judging by listener phone calls, Lehrer suggested that the biggest problem freelancers had with the Freelancers Union (at the time, in 2007) was that they could not meet the organization's definition of freelancer, which requires that they work at least 20 hours a week in one of seven industries typically associated with independent workers.  Honors  In recognition of her efforts to create a self-sustaining organization of flexible workers, Sara Horowitz was awarded a John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Fellowship (\\"genius\\" grant) in 1999. In 2002, she was named as one of Esquire Magazine‚Äôs \\"Fifty Best & Brightest\\" and received a community development award from the New York Mayor‚Äôs Office. Working Today ‚Äì Freelancers Union was recognized in 2004-2006 as a leading social entrepreneur by Fast Company magazine.. In 2013, Horowitz became a member of the New York Federal Reserve board. Chosen for the unique constituency the Freelancers Union represents economically, ‚ÄúHorowitz was appointed in 2013 as a Class C director and in 2014 she began to serve as deputy chair. As of 2017 she is a \\"Class C Director Chair.\\" Horowitz is also recognized as one of the World Economic Forum‚Äôs 100 Global Leaders for Tomorrow, and was selected as one of the 2015 ‚ÄúPOLITICO 50\\", POLITICO magazine‚Äôs marquee annual list of thinkers, doers, and visionaries transforming American politics. She is also on the board of Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation, Emily K. Rafferty Designated Chair and Kathryn S. Wylde Redesignated Deputy Chair, and the recipient of the Eugene V. Debs Award for her contribution in building the labor movement for gig workers.  National Benefits Platform  Freelancers Union offers health insurance as a non-profit health insurance brokerage. In 2001, it created an infrastructure platform known as the Portable Benefits Network (PBN) which provides health insurance to independent workers at less than half the price of average HMO premiums in the individual market in New York City, as well as offers life and disability insurance, financial services, resources, and discounts. As of June 2006, nearly 12,000 independent workers receive benefits through the PBN and several thousand more advocacy members have registered to support its mission. In 2008, it replaced PBN with the Freelancers Insurance Company (a wholly owned for-profit company) to offer insurance to its members. With the PBN platform in place, the organization expanded, becoming a full service association for the independent workforce. In August 2006, Freelancers Union launched a web portal with new services available to freelancers that includes job postings, message boards, and member profiles. In 2014, Horowitz announced a rebranding of the PBN at the Clinton Global Initiative; PBN is now called The National Benefits Platform. Freelance Contract In 2017, the Freelancers Union launched the first standard freelance contract in collaboration with And Co. The contract is built around the Freelance Isn't Free Act, a New York City law passed to protect freelancers.  Criticism  Some traditional unionists say that Freelancers Union is an association, not a union, and so it will not be able to achieve significant gains for workers. Freelancers Union does not negotiate contracts with employers nor represent freelancers when they have grievances, and freelancers have no employee bargaining rights under the National Labor Relations Act. One of the main benefits that Freelancers Union provided for its members was health insurance, but it does not qualify for Obamacare. The cost of selling individual insurance requires more overhead than group insurance. \\"Policies that provide the exact same coverage to someone working for a large employer will cost more for an individual,\\" says the Center for American Progress's website for college students. \\"Even worse, insurers can pick and choose preexisting conditions and then deny coverage for those deemed too costly to cover.\\" A Center for American Progress fellow estimated the average difference in administrative costs alone to be $300 per year between individual and group insurance. The Freelancers Union acknowledges those problems with the open market but asserts that its large-group bargaining power, its captive insurance company's obligation to grant coverage, and its non-profit marketing role all serve as effective remedies. In January 2008, Freelancers Union was criticized by both its members and the press when its new Freelancers Insurance Company became the entity providing coverage to members. At that time, the Union dropped Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield in favor of a range of new options, mostly more expensive, with Anthem BC/BS remaining only as claims processing agent. Members then faced the complexity inherent in comparing the limits, exclusions, co-payments, co-insurance percentages, and annual and other deductibles of the various new options with those of the old plans. Throughout this process, some members were even inadvertently dropped altogether.

The depot code is RG. Location The depot was situated to the west of Reading station and to the north of Reading West station until 2012. It was located within the wye formed by the Great Western Main Line to the north, with the Reading to Basingstoke Line split into the curve from Reading West to Reading to the east, and the curve connecting Reading West to the westbound main line to the west. With the rebuilding of Reading Station and the remodelling of the track, the depot was moved from the wye to a brand new facility located on the other side (to the north) of the main running lines, next to the fields where the Reading Festival is held each year. This new depot opened in mid 2012 and is home to GWR's fleet of Class 165 and 166 Network Turbos. As part of the construction, the preliminary equipment for electrification of the Great Western Main Line was installed. It is intended that this new depot will also be able to handle Crossrail stock such as the Class 345 once it is delivered. With the introduction of Class 387's, the Depot will also be the home of the new Electrostar Fleet for GWR. The Depot will also be managed by GWR and Bombardier to carry out light maintenance/heavy maintenance and overhauling of the Electrostar fleet. The old depot was subsequently demolished apart from two Great Western Railway era water towers, one of which has been donated to the West Somerset Railway (WSR).

Thornaby TMD can be seen in the back of the picture Thornaby TMD was a railway Traction Maintenance Depot situated in Thornaby, England, latterly operated by DB Schenker. The depot was situated to the east of , on the northern side of the line to Middlesbrough. Background In the mid-1950s as part of British Railways modernisation plan, projects were developed to centralise the marshalling of goods wagons and the associated servicing of steam locomotives at the United Kingdoms largest freight hubs. Teesside had a number of marshalling yards servicing the coal mines and steel mills of Consett, West County Durham and North Yorkshire, as well as those for Middlesbrough Dock. The decision was hence taken to rationalise these to one yard, Tees Marshalling Yard on part of the site of the once electrified Erimus Marshalling Yard. Steam history Existing in the area were also four older steam sheds, which BR also planned to rationalise and close: *North of the River Tees: **Stockton (51E) **Haverton Hill (51G) near Port Clarence and the Tees Transporter Bridge *South of the River Tees: **Newport (51B) next to the once electrified Erimus marshalling yard **Middlesbrough (51D) located just east of the station BR began construction in 1957, building its last roundhouse for steam locomotives. Developed on a site for the shed and its associated facilities alone, it was equipped with: * diameter octagonal roundhouse, containing 22 covered sidings accessed via a turntable *A running shed with covered preparation sheds and wet ash pits *A repair shed with two wheeldrops, a blacksmith, coppersmith and machine shop *A mechanised coaling plant, capable of fuelling four locomotives simultaneously *A water tank with 15 distribution points, and a second turntable Thornaby Tees Yard under construction All the structures were made from pre-stressed and pre-formed concrete pieces, and when the shed opened in June 1958 with shed code (51L), the total construction had been completed for ¬£1.25million. On opening, the shed initially took over the allocations at Newport (depot code 51B) and Middlesbrough (51D). In June 1959 the depots at Stockton (51E) and Haverton Hill (51G) were closed and the bulk of their locomotives added to Thornaby's allocation. At this time the depot had the largest allocation of any single depot in the country, although Stratford (30A) had a larger allocation but shared with 6 sub-sheds.Conversation with shed foreman, March 1961. The depot was closed to steam in December 1964. TOPS history Under TOPS, the depot code was TE. The logo applied to the sides of Thornaby locomotives was a white Kingfisher. Apart from the ubiquitous Class 08 shunter, early diesel allocations included members of Class 03, Class 04, Class 17, Class 25 (from the first batch built at Darlington), Class 27 and Class 37. DB Schenker In the later years prior to closure, Thornaby TMD was home to Class 08/09, Class 37, Class 56, Class 60 and Class 66's. Following closure, the depot was used to store Class 08/09 and a number of Class 56s which fell victim to metal thefts. These were all removed and sent for scrap prior to demolition works commencing. The buildings were demolished between May and July 2011.

He left Galaxie 500 in April 1991 and founded the band Luna. Since Luna's breakup in 2005, Wareham has released albums with fellow Luna bandmate (and wife) Britta Phillips (see Dean and Britta). They also work as film composers, notably on the Noah Baumbach films The Squid and the Whale and Mistress America. He released a self-titled album in 2014 and reformed Luna in 2015.  Early life  Born in Wellington, New Zealand, Wareham is the son of John Wareham, a management consultant and author. His family moved to Sydney, Australia, before settling in New York City in 1977. Wareham attended the Dalton School in New York and Harvard University, graduating with a B.A. in social studies. He has three siblings, including Louise Wareham, a novelist. Galaxie 500 Guitarist Wareham, drummer Damon Krukowski and bassist Naomi Yang began playing together as Galaxie 500 in 1987, after their time as students at Harvard University. The band's name comes from a Ford car of the 1960s, the Ford Galaxie 500. Galaxie 500's records were released in the US and UK on the independent Rough Trade label and went out of print upon Rough Trade's demise. Galaxie 500's entire catalog, along with a box set including singles, EPs and rarities was reissued during the 1990s by Rykodisc. Galaxie 500 leveraged fairly minimal instrumental technique with intense atmospherics provided by producer Mark Kramer, and their distinctive sound bore an influence beyond the small audience for their independently released albums. The sound and the increasingly loyal audience grew with each release until Wareham quit the band in 1991. To mark twenty years since the release of the Galaxie 500 albums, Wareham embarked on his Dean Wareham Plays Galaxie 500 tour. Notably absent were Krukowski and Yang. Luna Luna was a dream pop/indie pop band Wareham formed in 1991 after the breakup of Galaxie 500, with Stanley Demeski and Justin Harwood (Demeski also in The Feelies and Harwood formerly of New Zealand band The Chills). The original lineup was expanded with the addition of guitarist Sean Eden for their second album, 1994's Bewitched. Lee Wall replaced Demeski on drums in time for 1997's Pup Tent, and Britta Phillips of Belltower (also known as the singing voice of animated character Jem) joined when bassist Justin Harwood departed in 2000. Phillips and Wareham eventually became romantically involved and married. They now release records under the moniker \\"Dean & Britta\\". In 1992, Wareham signed a demo deal with Elektra Records' A&R; VP Terry Tolkin and recorded a number of tracks with Mercury Rev drummer Jimmy Chambers. Some of these recordings were later released on the \\"Anesthesia\\" single on Tolkin's No.6 Records in the US and Mint Tea in the UK under the name Dean Wareham. Tolkin then signed Wareham to Elektra, who started pulling together a band. He first contacted Justin Harwood, whom Dean had met while Justin was playing with The Chills and they recruited drummer Byron Guthrie. The trio recorded some more demos (produced by Dave Fridmann) and played a couple of live dates augmented by Mercury Rev guitarist Grasshopper (Sean Mackowiak). Guthrie was then replaced by former Feelies drummer Stanley Demeski and this lineup recorded the first album Lunapark, produced by Fred Maher and released by Elektra under the name Luna2 to avoid confusion with a new-age musician who was already using the name Luna (later an agreement was reached which allowed the band to use the name Luna). In the summer of 1993 the band was the supporting act for the reformed Velvet Underground on their European tour after which they set about recording their second album. Bewitched was recorded in New York City and co-produced by the band with Victor Van-Vugt. Velvet Underground guitarist Sterling Morrison played guitar on two tracks. The album was released in 1994. Luna‚Äôs third album, Penthouse (1995), was named one of the essential of the 1990s by Rolling Stone magazine. Penthouse was co-produced by Mario Salvati and Pat McCarthy in New York, and features guests Tom Verlaine (Television) and Laetitia Sadier (Stereolab). While remaining on Elektra Records in the U.S., the band were signed to Beggar's Banquet for the rest of the world. In 1997, Lee Wall replaced Stanley Demeski on drums, and the band recorded Pup Tent, their fourth album for Elektra, produced by Pat McCarthy. In 1998, Luna recorded their fifth album, The Days of Our Nights, produced by Paul Kimble (Grant Lee Buffalo). The album was released in the U.S. on Jericho Records and on Beggar's Banquet internationally. In December 1999, Harwood retired to New Zealand, and was replaced on bass by Britta Phillips. The band released Luna Live! in 2000 on the Arena Rock label, and then signed to Jetset Records, for whom they recorded two more studio albums, Romantica (2002), co-produced by Gene Holder (DB‚Äôs) and Dave Fridmann (Mercury Rev), and Rendezvous (2004), produced by Bryce Goggin. The band announced plans to break up in 2004, and played a final concert at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City on 28 February 2005. However, in 2015 the band returned, toured the world and released new material in 2017 - the LP A Sentimental Education and the EP A Place of Greater Safety. Dean and Britta Dean & Britta is a musical duo consisting of Wareham and Britta Phillips, former Luna bassist. After Luna broke up in 2005, the pair spent the following year working on film scores, including one for Noah Baumbach's movie The Squid and the Whale, and promoting the documentary film of Luna's farewell tour Tell Me Do You Miss Me. They were married during the recording of their album Back Numbers, produced by Tony Visconti, and simplified their name to \\"Dean & Britta\\". Back Numbers was released on Rounder Records in February 2007, followed by a limited edition EP, \\"Words You Used To Say\\". Solo work Wareham released the EP, Emancipated Hearts, under his own name in late 2013, which was followed by the self-titled album Dean Wareham in March 2014. October 2018 saw the release of Dean Wareham Vs. Cheval Sombre - a collection of western-themed songs featuring Wareham and singer-songwriter Cheval Sombre.  Book  Wareham has written a memoir about his years in indie rock. The book recounts his experiences in music and otherwise, from high school in New York City in the 1970s through his years in Galaxie 500 and Luna and his divorce. Titled Black Postcards, it was published by Penguin Press in March, 2008.

Biography =Early life= Juan Jos√© Paso is the son of Domingo de Passo. Domingo left Spain and moved to Buenos Aires in 1750. He worked as a baker; Buenos Aires had a scarce production of bread at the time. Domingo got married with Mar√≠a Manuela Fern√°ndez Escand√≥n on March 8, 1755. Domingo became a vecino after his marriage. Their son Juan Jos√© Esteban Paso was born on January 2, 1758, and baptized five days later. The place of Paso's initial education is unknown, but it was not the Real Colegio San Carlos, as he is not among its recorded list of students.Tanzi, pp. 9-12 Paso studied at the University of C√≥rdoba and graduated in Theology in 1779. Back in Buenos Aires, he was named professor of Philosophy at the Colegio Real de San Carlos (Royal School of San Carlos). In 1783 he moved to the Upper Peru and studied law in the University of Chuquisaca; only to return to Buenos Aires as a lawyer in 1803. After the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata he pursued a political career as a revolutionary leader moved by the new national identity that was growing among the 'criollos'. Like many other nineteenth century Argentines prominent in public life, he was a freemason.The list includes Juan Bautista Alberdi, Manuel Alberti, Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, Miguel de Azcu√©naga, Antonio Gonz√°lez de Balcarce, Manuel Belgrano, Antonio Luis Beruti, Juan Jos√© Castelli, Domingo French, Gregorio Ar√°oz de Lamadrid, Francisco Narciso de Laprida , Juan Larrea, Juan Lavalle, Vicente L√≥pez y Planes, Bartolom√© Mitre, Mariano Moreno, Juan Jos√© Paso, Carlos Pellegrini, Gervasio Antonio de Posadas, Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, and Justo Jos√© de Urquiza; Jos√© de San Mart√≠n is known to have been a member of the Lautaro Lodge, but whether that lodge was truly masonic has been debated: =Juntas= Paso assisted with the Cabildo Abierto of May 22, 1810 and supported the faction that sought the dismissal of viceroy Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, convincing many others with a fervent speech. He participated in the creation of the First Junta (Primera Junta) government on May 25 and was named Secretary of the Junta along with Mariano Moreno, with whom he shared political points of view. He was sent by the Junta to Montevideo (today's Uruguay capital city) to spread the ideas of the revolution. Paso was also part of the First Triumvirate and the Second Triumvirate that ruled the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata (Argentina) between 1811 and 1814. During this period he participated in the Asamblea del a√±o XIII and was sent to Chile as a representative. But the negotiations with Chilean patriots failed and the Capitaincy of Chile refused to take part in the Union. =Congress of Tucum√°n= In 1815 Paso was named assistant to the Supreme Director and war consultant. He was later elected a representative to the Congress of Tucum√°n that declared the Argentine Independence on July 9, 1816. As Secretary to this Congress, Paso had the honor of reading the independence act. However, he was then imprisoned and charged of treason for supporting the monarchist faction that wanted a monarchy as government for the new nation. He was quickly released along with the other monarchist deputies. =Buenos Aires' legislature= Elected a member of the Buenos Aires Province Legislature in 1822, Paso later became president of that body. In 1824, he was again elected representative for the National Congress and supported the nomination of Bernardino Rivadavia as the first President of Argentina. He retired from politics in 1826 disgusted with the violent disagreements among the provinces that divided themselves between Unitarians and Federalists.

Toton TMD is bordered by Long Eaton and Sandiacre in Derbyshire and Toton in Nottinghamshire. The official depot code for Toton TMD is TO, previously shed code 18A. The disused section of Toton sidings is the proposed site for the East Midlands Hub station, on the Leeds branch of High Speed 2, Phase Two. History A classic mid-1980s shot of Toton, showing the Teesside Steelworks/Lackenby sidings ‚Äì Corby Steelworks train on the up main line headed by a British Rail Class 37, whilst a British Rail Class 56 leaves the North Yard with coal empties on the second down goods line The history of the development of Toton is highly associated with the history, development and decline of the coal industry in England. The Midland Railway had developed the Midland Main Line from the 1860s, and had a developing revenue from coal traffic from both the Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire coalfields to the power stations of the industrialised West Midlands. This traffic was added to by the fact that most towns also had their own gasworks, with coal delivered by rail to their own private sidings, and the rapidly developing domestic use of coal for heating and cooking. With need to marshall coal traffic, a location close to the strategically located Trent Junction became obvious, and hence the development of Toton as a railway yard from the late 19th century. The yards eventually spanned: the Old/New Banks; North Yard and Meadow; East & West Yard; Sandiacre Ballast Sidings. Coal traffic reached its peak through the yards post World War II in the 1950s, with over 1million wagons per year passing through what was then the largest marshalling yard in Europe, and the third largest in the world. Local traffic included coal and iron ore and steel from the nearby Stanton Ironworks. With the coming of the Beeching Axe, British Railways shelved all proposed development of any other marshalling yards, thereby increasing traffic through the yards further. This was the peak of Toton traffic. However, by the 1970s the yard was in decline. With the introduction of Merry-go-round trains direct from colliery to power station, and the decline in the use of domestic coal in favour of North Sea gas, rail traffic through the yards was diminishing quickly. The Down Side ceased hump shunting in 1978, followed by the Up Side in 1984. Many of the yards were lifted during the 1970s and 1980s, and in the late 1980s the yards were rationalised to the basic shape seen today. This was the era when Toton TMD was the home of Class 20, Class 56 and Class 58. Present =Toton TMD= Toton TMD, showing British Rail Class 60 and British Rail Class 66 on shed Since privatisation of the UK rail network, Toton TMD has been operated by EWS, now rebranded as DB Cargo UK. Nowadays, and mainly due to the rationalisation of rail freight by EWS the TMD is home to the Class 60 and Class 66 diesel locomotives. The older traction has been taken out of service by EWS/DBS and nearly 75% of the Class 60 fleet is in storage, many at Toton. Changes in the maintenance of locomotives have also meant that Toton is now the only TMD within DBS where heavy maintenance is carried out on locomotives. More recently a number of locos at Toton have been modified for use in France with EWS/DBS subsidiary Euro Cargo Rail. The traincrew depot has also declined as a result of the loss of traffic and now has a depot complement of 48 drivers (in 2010), which contrasts with the depot's complement on privatisation when around 170 drivers were based here. =Toton Marshalling Yards= Toton \\"Down\\" sidings High Speed 2 East Midlands Hub railway station. The changes in traffic flows have meant changes in the way freight is handled by the yards at Toton, primarily because the great majority of the trains now originate from south of the yards and therefore have to be propelled into the North Yard. Following the remodelling of the 1970s and 1980s there is no connection directly into Toton Yards from the south. From 2009 both the North Yard and the New Bank sidings became accessible from the south after the whole of the Toton area was re-signalled with a certain amount of remodelling also taking place. It is now also possible to depart south from the North Yard which, as its name would suggest, was designed for trains heading North. Toton lost the last of its domestic coal traffic in the mid-2000s, when GB Railfreight took over transport originating from Daw Mill Colliery from EWS. Now the main traffic is: *Domestic coal from Scotland via Milford *Coal imports from Immingham, Avonmouth and Liverpool docks for onward transit to Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station *Rail infrastructure services for Network Rail, and weekend ballast and engineering trains At 23:59 on 26 April 2009 the New Bank yard on the up side of the main lines (below the bank) was closed due to the economic situation and the associated decline in freight traffic. The mothballed yard will be used for storage of assets not currently in use, including locos (Class 60s) and wagons. References *Rail Atlas Great Britain & Ireland, S.K.

In the IIHF World Championships, he won the scoring title four times and was named the best forward three times. He was also named the most valuable player in the Soviet hockey league three times. Between 1964 and 1972, Firsov played 166 games for the national team. He scored 134 goals, and won three Olympic and eight world titles. Firsov played in HC CSKA Moscow. He eventually would become one of the best forwards in Soviet hockey. Despite this he would not participate in the 1972 Summit Series against Canada. Many believe this was a result of Anatoli Tarasov's exclusion from the coaching staff. In 1972, while still playing for CSKA Moscow, Firsov began working as an assistant coach for the club. Between 1976 and 77 he was the head coach of the Soviet junior team, which won a bronze medal at the 1977 World Championships. From 1977 and until his death he worked as a children's hockey coach. In 1989, Firsov was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies, running on a policy of improving health conditions and sporting facilities.On This Day: 1989: Millions of Russians go to the polls on BBC In 1998, he was inducted to the IIHF Hall of Fame.

The family consisted of three children. When Firsov was only one month old, his father was killed in action during World War II and thus, he was raised by a single mother. Growing up, Firsov's family experienced economic hardship. His mother worked at a kindergarten which was not a well paying job. Initially, Firsov did not play ice hockey. Instead, he played bandy which was more popular than ice hockey at the time in the Soviet Union. The two sports share many similarities. One of the biggest differences between bandy and ice hockey is that the former uses a ball while the latter uses a puck. Firsov first played bandy as a member of his backyard team. He was initially slotted in as a defenceman, a position that was usually reserved for undersized kids and kids with no equipment. During the summer, Firsov would play football which helped keep him in shape all year long. Due to the lack of money in the family, Firsov had to make his own stick and skates. His stick consisted of a shaft carved from a cherry tree and the blade of his stick was made from shaft bows which he acquired by stealing from horse yards at night. The sticks broke easily and Firsov had to make new ones regularly. Meanwhile, his skates were composed of a boot with a blade laced at the bottom with a string. Despite these setbacks, Firsov quickly became considered as one of the best young talents. At around 11 years old, he was playing against 16 year olds and at around 12 years old, he was playing against men that had served in the Army. It was not until Firsov was around 15 years old, that he learned about ice hockey. Firsov had a little difficulty with the different equipment at the beginning. Bandy sticks had a smaller blade compared to hockey sticks and Firsov felt that the larger blade interfered a little. However, Firsov credits the larger bandy fields for strengthening his endurance as he had to skate longer distances because bandy fields would be approximately 100m in length compared to hockey's 60m in length.

Organocadmium chemistry describes physical properties, synthesis, reactions and use of these compounds.Synthetic Methods of Organometallic and Inorganic Chemistry Vol 5, Copper, Silver, Gold, Zinc, Cadmium, and Mercury W.A. Herrmann Ed. Cadmium shares group 12 with zinc and mercury and their corresponding chemistries have much in common. Dimethylcadmium consists of linear molecules with C-Cd bond lengths of 213 pm. All organocadmium compounds are sensitive to air, light and moisture.  Synthesis Space-filling model of dimethylcadmium The first organocadmium compounds, dimethylcadmium, CH3-Cd-CH3, and diethylcadmium, CH3CH2-Cd-CH2CH3, were prepared in 1917 by Erich Krause. In general, they are prepared by transmetalation or by an exchange reaction between an organometallic reagent and a cadmium salt. One procedure for the synthesis of diethylcadmium is by the reaction of cadmium bromide with two equivalents of the Grignard reagent ethylmagnesium bromide in diethyl ether. A byproduct is magnesium bromide. Diethylcadmium is a colorless oil with melting point ‚àí21 ¬∞C. Diphenylcadmium can be prepared by the reaction of phenyllithium with cadmium bromide. Diphenylcadmium is a solid with a melting point of 174 ¬∞C. Reactions The synthetic utility of organocadmiums is limited. The alkyl groups in them are less nucleophilic than the organozincs due to the general increase in electronegativity going down group 12. This reduced reactivity is demonstrated in the conversion of acyl chlorides to ketones with these reagents. This reaction was discovered by Henry Gilman in 1936 and was used until less toxic cuprates were available. With other organometallic reagents such reaction would continue to the corresponding alcohol. A good example is the use of methyl cadmium in one of the steps leading to cholesterol total synthesis: :Organocadmium chemistry cholesterol synthesis Woodward Another example of the synthetic use of an organocadmium is the reaction of diisoamylcadmium with Œ≤-carbomethoxypropionyl chloride to methyl 4-keto-7-methyloctanoate without reacting further with the ketone group or the ester group.Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 3, p.601 (1955); Vol. 28, p.75 (1948) Article This selectivity exists provided that the reaction is carried out salt free. When the cadmium reagent is generated in situ from a cadmium salt, the presence of a halide salt makes the reagent much more reactive, even to ketones. The same salt effect can be observed with organozinc compounds. Dimethylcadmium is also used in the synthesis of colloidal nanocrystals although its toxic and volatile nature has led researchers to look elsewhere for cadmium precursors such as cadmium oxide.http://www.cchem.berkeley.edu/~pagrp/index.html Toxicity Cadmium compounds are considered to be toxic. Dimethylcadmium is toxic to the kidney, the liver, the central nervous system and the respiratory organs when inhaled. Cadmium compounds in general are considered to be carcinogen to humans by the IARC.http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100C/mono100C-8.pdf  See also  * Other chemistries of carbon with other group 12 elements: organozinc compounds and organomercury compounds.

Published in 1941 by Concordia Publishing House in St. Louis, Missouri, it was the LCMS' second official English-language hymnal, succeeding the 1912 Evangelical Lutheran Hymn-Book. Development of TLH began in 1929 as a collaborative effort of the churches of the Evangelical Lutheran Synodical Conference of North America and became the common hymnal for both the LCMS and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS). Containing 668 chorales, hymns, carols, and chants, plus the liturgy for the Common Service, Matins, Vespers, the propers, collects and prayers, the suffrages, canticles, psalms, and miscellaneous tables, TLH became an extremely popular and beloved worship resource in the Lutheran church in North America, and attempts to succeed it in more recent years have often met with strong resistance. The first attempt to replace TLH began in 1965, when the LCMS began work on the Lutheran Book of Worship and invited other Lutheran denominations in North America to participate in its creation. As a result of disagreement and compromise with the other churches involved in LBW's production, the LCMS objected to some of its content, and Lutheran Book of Worship was published in 1978 without the endorsement of the very church body that initiated its production. An LCMS revision of LBW was quickly published in 1982 under the title Lutheran Worship. Lutheran Worship (LW) was intended to replace TLH as the official hymnal of the LCMS; however, many congregations were still unsatisfied with the final product, leading them to continue using TLH. According to a 1999 survey by the LCMS' Commission on Worship, approximately 36% of the synod's congregations were still using TLH as their main hymnal, and even more were continuing to use it in combination with LW and/or other hymnals and hymnal supplements. An even newer hymnal, Lutheran Service Book (2006), has restored many of the former hymnal's features in the hope that more widespread use can be achieved. In the WELS, TLH was effectively replaced by Christian Worship: A Lutheran Hymnal in 1993, and few congregations continue to use it on a regular basis. The Lutheran Hymnal is commonly referred to by many to as the \\"Red hymnal,\\" in contrast with LW, the \\"Blue hymnal\\". However, the \\"Red hymnal\\" moniker is somewhat misleading. The initial editions of TLH were in fact bound in blue, and the hymnal has been simultaneously available in both red and blue cover versions for much of its history. Although the red cover version is now more common, many congregations' pew racks are filled with blue-covered copies of the \\"red\\" hymnal. Generally, members of these congregations refer to TLH simply as \\"the old hymnal\\". The widespread use of Lutheran Service Book (LSB)http://lsb.cph.org/ has begun the process of resolving the LCMS' hymnal controversy, as initial reviews have been generally quite favorable. Concordia Publishing House has announced that all TLH-related supplemental materials, including specialized accompaniment editions and the agenda, will go out of print when current supplies are depleted, but plans to continue to produce the pew edition for the foreseeable future. TLH remains an officially sanctioned hymnal of the synod, and it is unlikely that the synod will ever formally decommission it as an official hymnal. W.G.

History :See also: Flag of Romania, Coat of arms of Romania, Flag of Moldova, Coat of arms of Moldova. A princely standard was first attested under the rule of Prince Stephen the Great (late 15th century), depicting an or aurochs/wisent head (most likely alluding to the legends surrounding Moldavia's foundation by Drago»ô), flanked by stylised figures of the Sun and crescent Moon (or other symbols, such as the rosette and star) set against a gules (or possibly purpure) background; its obverse displayed the figure of Saint George slaying the Dragon. The depiction of the Battle of Baia (1476) in Johannes de Thurocz's Chronicle shows Moldavian troops carrying a pennant with the aurochs head on pales of unspecified colour. In 1574, Moldavian delegates to the coronation of Henry III of Poland are attested to have carried a blue banner with the aurochs head. Moldavia's fall under Ottoman Empire control, a process which was accelerated during the 16th century, saw a decline in flag usage; as princes became appointees of the Sultans, the usage of a sanjak as a mark of authority became widespread. In the coat of arms (either seal or blazon), the aurochs was initially a crest over a helmet and party per pale escutcheon, charged with either fleur-de-lis dexter and bars sinister (interpreted as being alternating vert and or) or the Patriarchal cross dexter (closely resembling the Cross of Lorraine in usual renditions) and fleur-de-lis sinister. In time reduced to the simple depiction of an aurochs head on escutcheon, it was featured alongside the arms of Wallachia and Transylvania on Michael the Brave's seal, as well as only alongside Wallachia's on various symbols favored by rulers such as Radu Mihnea and several Phanariotes (in the latter case, it was more often than not accompanied by the double-headed eagle of Byzantine tradition). The prevalent gules (or red) and or (yellow) display was replaced, towards the beginning of the 19th century, by variations on a red-blue theme. As such, when the Treaty of Adrianople allowed Wallachia and Moldavia a measure of sovereignty, Sultan Mahmud II awarded Moldavia a red over blue pennant to be used by its military, and Wallachia a yellow over blue one; Moldavia's pennant was similar to the version given recognition by Austria-Hungary as the Landesfarben of Bukovina (the latter was blue over red). During the Organic Statute rule of Mihail Sturdza, the pennant was replaced by a war flag/naval ensign and a civil ensign with a blue field and a red canton standing for Ottoman suzerainty (see Ottoman Flag). Grigore Alexandru Ghica was to include the color yellow, already present in the pan-Romanian horizontal tricolour favored by the 1848 revolutionaries, in the war flag's pattern. In 1858, the aurochs became the central theme of the most valuable stamp in Romanian postal history, the Cap de Bour. The aurochs head (dexter) and Wallachia's eagle (sinister) were included as emblems on the tricolour adopted by Alexandru Ioan Cuza after the union of the Danubian Principalities in 1859; the arms of Moldavia are nowadays represented in the coat of arms of Romania, as well as in that of the short-lived Moldavian Democratic Republic and present-day Moldova (having previously featured in the coat of arms of Bessarabia within the Russian Empire).

Belton Lake is a long, narrow, winding lake with many curves and coves. Belton Lake is a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reservoir on the Leon River in the Brazos River basin, 5 miles (8 km) northwest of Belton, Texas, United States. The lake extends into both Bell County and Coryell County. Belton Dam and the lake are both managed by the Fort Worth District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The reservoir was officially impounded in 1954, and serves to provide flood control and drinking water for Belton, Temple, and the surrounding communities. Belton Lake is a popular recreational destination. In the fall of 2018 Lake Belton was host to the annual ‚ÄúLonestar Throwdown‚Äù kayak fishing tournament. Teams from the North, South, Central, and West Texas regions battled it out for bragging rights and ultimately North Texas took home the coveted trophy. Belton Lake overflowed the spillway in 1991‚Äì1992 with the occurrence of two closely spaced 50 year floods. The area immediately below the spillway was heavily damaged by the floods. It was rebuilt and reconstituted as the Miller Springs Nature Center on October 26, 1993. It is run by the Miller Springs Alliance, a non profit group of volunteers and has nearly 11 miles of hiking and biking trails passing through upland, prairie, canyon and riparian habitats. Fish populations Belton Lake has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in Belton Lake include largemouth bass, Smallmouth bass , Striped Bass , Catfish , Bluegills , Minnows Recreational uses In addition to maintaining the dam that creates the reservoir, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers maintains recreational facilities at the lake, including Live Oak Ridge Park, Cedar Ridge Park, Winkler Park, White Flint Park, and Westcliff Park. Under the auspices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers the Miller Springs Alliance oversees the Miller Springs Nature Center located adjacent to Belton Dam. Boating and fishing are very popular.

Huw was introduced on 28 May 1996 and remained on- screen until 15 April 1999. Storylines Huw is an amiable Welshman from Pontarddulais, who is best friends with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman). They live in a squat in Albert Square, enjoying loud music and winding up Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Lenny and Huw also operate a pirate radio station from the premises for a while. Ian tries to get them evicted several times ‚Äî once calling the council to complain about noise pollution ‚Äî and Lenny and Huw do everything they can to annoy him further. During his time in Walford, Huw works in George Palmer (Paul Moriarty)'s nightclub as a barman, soon bought by Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), and in the caf√© as a waiter. In 1998 Huw develops a crush on Ruth Fowler (Caroline Paterson). Ruth sees him only as a platonic friend and unwittingly lets him get his hopes up for a relationship for a period of time. Huw eventually leaves the Square to live with Carrie Swann (Holly Atkins), an artist who is exhibiting her abstract art in the caf√©. Creation and development Actor Richard Elis was cast in the minor role of Huw for a period of three episodes in 1996; however, producers enjoyed the character and his contract was extended. Elis was an inexperienced actor and was sent to audition for the role while still in drama school at the Welsh College of Music and Drama. He was given two minutes on stage to impress London casting agents. His rendition of an extract impressed the EastEnders casting director, Jonathan McLeash, and he was asked to attend an audition in London. At the audition, Elis did a comedy monologue about a man working in a chip shop in Cardiff. Approximately four hours later, Elis was telephoned and told he'd been cast as Huw. Elis has described the experience as \\"mindblowing\\". Huw was the serial's first Welsh character, which pleased Elis as he was able to play the character with his native West Walian accent. Although the producers decided to make Huw Welsh, according to Elis they had not specifically been looking to hire a Welsh actor prior to his audition. Huw has been described as likable and a loveable lout. Discussing his first time on set, Elis said in 2010, \\"I don't think I really realised the enormity of it at the time as it all happened so quickly, I didn't have time to panic or worry about what I was letting myself in for. At the end of the day, I had literally just graduated from college and had no idea that I was going to be playing the role for any longer than three episodes so I suppose I didn't really have time to be nervous. One day I was a student about to leave college in Cardiff and then I'm on the set of EastEnders with Barbara Windsor [who plays Peggy Mitchell] showing me round [...] My first lines on the show were spoken to Tiffany Mitchell, played by Martine McCutcheon. I was working in the nightclub and she came in and said, 'What cocktails do you do?' and I said, 'I'm Huw, I will make anything you want' and threw a cocktail together. I thought I was only going to be in three episodes so wanted to make the most of every single line I got to say [...] Then within a few weeks I'm making bacon sandwiches and cups of tea in Ian Beale's cafe and mixing cocktails in the bar. It was bonkers.\\" Huw was introduced simultaneously with his friend and fellow squatter Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman). A recurring storyline in the serial concerned Huw and Lenny purposefully trying to antagonise Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Elis described the role as fun, and commented some of his most liked storylines in 2010: \\"Huw would constantly wind up Ian and so, consequently, it was a really fun role. Ian would get very irritated by it and Adam Woodyatt is a great actor so was able to really portray the fact that Huw was winding him up. [...] It was great fun, more fun because I got to play a Welshman but for me, as an actor just out of college, the whole experience was amazing. [...] And being the only Welsh accent on a London soap made me stand out more I suppose. I think being so obviously Welsh on the show made Huw stand out as a character.\\" According to Elis, producers required Huw to be overweight and Elis has claimed that he was asked not to lose weight while playing the role. It was reported in December 1998 that executive producer Matthew Robinson had axed Huw because the character was \\"going nowhere\\". However, Elis claimed in 2010 that he decided to leave the role in 1999 after three years playing Huw as he feared being typecast. Elis has commented, \\"My agent at the time told me that if you are in a soap for three years, it takes three years for the viewers to forget you, whereas if you are in one for five years, it takes another 10 years before they forget you. I just felt it was time to go. It was great to be on it but it was just a job to me.\\" Reception Huw has been described by Jane Simon of The People as a \\"token Welshman\\". Stuart Heritage from The Guardian recalled the character in 2011, suggesting that Huw's \\"only role was to say the name 'Ian Beale' in increasingly malevolent ways.\\" References External links * EastEnders characters Fictional Welsh people Television characters introduced in 1996 Male characters in television Fictional bartenders ","title":"Huw Edwards (EastEnders)"},{"id":"5736075","text":"He Is the Light is the 20th album by Al Green, released in 1985.

Nesbitt in the representation theory of finite groups. In modular representation theory, the Brauer‚ÄìNesbitt theorem on blocks of defect zero states that a character whose order is divisible by the highest power of a prime p dividing the order of a finite group remains irreducible when reduced mod p and vanishes on all elements whose order is divisible by p. Moreover, it belongs to a block of defect zero. A block of defect zero contains only one ordinary character and only one modular character. Another version states that if k is a field of characteristic zero, A is a k-algebra, V, W are semisimple A-modules which are finite dimensional over k, and TrV = TrW as elements of Homk(A,k), then V and W are isomorphic as A-modules.

It uses a client-server design and supports the sending and receiving of faxes as well as text pages, on any scale from low to very high volumes, if necessary making use of large numbers of modems. It is open-source, free software and can be used commercially without charge. History Sam Leffler, while working at Silicon Graphics (SGI), wrote a fax server for SGI's IRIX servers called FlexFAX and released it to the public in June 1991. Leffler and others worked for several years on FlexFAX, adding new features and porting the software to new platforms. In April 1995 FlexFAX was renamed HylaFAX with the 3.0pl0 release to avoid potential trademark issues. Following the 4.0pl0 release in September 1996, Leffler began to leave working on the project, which caused development to slow dramatically. He did release version 4.0pl1 in December; however, in February 1997 Sam officially handed maintainership of HylaFAX over to Matthias Apitz, who had previously been known for his maintainership of the SVR4 HylaFAX binary releases and the so-named \\"HylaFAQ\\". Some HylaFAX community members were frustrated that code releases and development work did not increase noticeably after the maintainership transition. Apitz did release HylaFAX 4.0pl2 a year later, in February 1998, and anticipated an eventual 4.0pl3. However, some community members were still unhappy with the slow development pace. In November 1998, Darren Nickerson, maintainer of the tpc.int network, and Robert Colquhoun led an attempt to revitalize HylaFAX development by the creation of hylafax.org, a central repository for HylaFAX development, downloads, documentation, mailing lists, etc. Colquhoun released a number of \\"rjc\\" versions before releasing 4.1beta1 in July 1999 and then 4.1beta2 in August. In early 2000, newcomer Lee Howard began assisting Nickerson to prepare the next release after development had once again slowed down. A lot of work went into the 4.1beta3 release in February 2001, and in July a non-beta 4.1 was finally released. Since that time releases (now numbered like 4.1.1, 4.1.2, and so forth) have been comparatively regular and the development pace has been relatively steady with releases occurring roughly every six months. In March 2002, Nickerson started iFAX, Inc., endeavoring to sell and commercialize HylaFAX in particular to enterprise customers. Thus iFAX began selling a proprietary product called HylaFAX Enterprise Edition which supported the proprietary interfacing of BrookTrout fax hardware. The development pace was still not fast enough for some, in particular Howard. And so after the 4.1.6 release in May 2003 the code repository was branched into a \\"4.1\\" legacy branch, to satisfy the conservative elements, and a \\"4.2\\" development branch to satisfy Howard. The development branch then began the largest period of code work since before Leffler released 4.0pl0. The Class 1 driver was endowed with ECM capability, fax batching support (sending multiple faxes in one call) was added, extended resolution support began, MMR and JBIG data compressions were supported, and color fax reception was supported all in a relatively short amount of time. This set of developments, and the subsequent stabilization of those features, made HylaFAX not only the best, most feature-rich open-source fax software available, but it also became easily the most feature-rich fax software of any kind that supported average, inexpensive off-the-shelf fax modems. After many years of disagreements between Howard and Nickerson regarding the direction and pace of the software development, Howard began developing HylaFAX at SourceForge.net in October 2005. That work later became known as HylaFAX+. Version numbers initially added another \\"dot\\" (like \\"4.3.0.11\\") and then simply changed outright to \\"5.0.0\\", \\"5.0.1\\", and so forth. HylaFAX development currently continues both at Sourceforge and at hylafax.org. The Sourceforge development aims to adopt and release new developments quickly and with little hassle, and so releases there are regular and frequent. The development at hylafax.org continues to be steady with releases occurring less frequently and without adopting all of the features found in HylaFAX+.

They were first suggested in 1881 by Eug√®ne Turpin, a French chemist. They are a mixture of liquid dinitrogen tetroxide serving as oxidizer with a suitable fuel, e.g. carbon disulfide, in the 3:2 volume ratio. Other fuel being used is nitrobenzene. Possible alternative fuels are e.g. nitrotoluene, gasoline, nitromethane, or halocarbons. Panclastites are shock-sensitive and difficult to handle, requiring their mixing immediately before use; also the dinitrogen tetroxide is highly corrosive and explodes in contact with some chemicals. Despite their brisance and detonation velocity being comparable with TNT, panclastites have virtually no use today. During World War I, due to shortages of other explosives, French used some panclastite-class mixtures, which they called anilites, in small aircraft bombs. The mixing of the chemicals was triggered by airflow spinning a propeller on the nose of the bomb after it was dropped, mixing the previously separated chemicals inside. The resulting mixture was so sensitive the bombs did not need a fuze to explode on impact. In the 1880s, Germans were testing torpedoes with panclastite warhead. Carbon disulfide and nitrogen tetroxide were stored in separate glass compartments, which were broken when the torpedo was launched and the chemicals mixed, and later were detonated by a contact fuse.

A chemical state is often defined as an \\"oxidation state\\" when referring to metal cations. When referring to organic materials, a chemical state is usually defined as a chemical group, which is a group of several elements bonded together. Material scientists, solid state physicists, analytical chemists, surface scientists and spectroscopists describe or characterize the chemical, physical and/or electronic nature of the surface or the bulk regions of a material as having or existing as one or more chemical states. Overview The chemical state set comprises and encompasses these subordinate groups and entities: chemical species, functional group, anion, cation, oxidation state, chemical compound and elemental forms of an element. This term or phrase is commonly used when interpreting data from analytical techniques such as: * Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) * Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS, EDX) * Infrared spectroscopy (IR, FT-IR, ATR) * Liquid chromatography (LC, HPLC) * Mass spectrometry (MS, ToF-SIMS, D-SIMS) * Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR, H-NMR, C-NMR, X-NMR) * Photoemission spectroscopy (PES, UPS) * Raman spectroscopy (FT-Raman) * Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) * X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, ESCA) * Wavelength dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (WDX, WDS) Significance The chemical state of a group of elements, can be similar to, but not identical to, the chemical state of another similar group of elements because the two groups have different ratios of the same elements and exhibit different chemical, electronic, and physical properties that can be detected by various spectroscopic techniques. A chemical state can exist on or inside the surface of a solid state material and can often, but not always, be isolated or separated from the other chemical species found on the surface of that material. Surface scientists, spectroscopists, chemical analysts, and material scientists frequently describe the chemical nature of the chemical species, functional group, anion, or cation detected on the surface and near the surface of a solid state material as its chemical state. To understand how a chemical state differs from an oxidation state, anion, or cation, compare sodium fluoride (NaF) to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon). Both contain fluorine, the most electronegative element, but only NaF dissolves in water to form separate ions, Na+ and F‚àí. The electronegativity of the fluorine strongly polarizes the electron density that exists between the carbon and the fluorine, but not enough to produce ions which would allow it to dissolve in the water. The carbon and fluorine in Teflon (PTFE) both have an electronic charge of zero since they form a covalent bond, but few scientists describe those elements as having an oxidation state of zero. On the other hand, many elements, in their pure form, are often described as existing with an oxidation state of zero. This is one of the attributes of nomenclature that has been upheld over the years.  Closely related nomenclature The chemical state of an element is often confused with its oxidation state. The chemical state of an element or a group of elements that has a non-zero ionic charge, e.g. (1+), (2+), (3+), (1-), (2-) (3-), is defined as the oxidation state of that element or group of elements. Elements or chemical groups that have an ionic charge can usually be dissolved to form ions in either water or another polar solvent. Such a compound or salt is described as an ionic compound with ionic bonds which means that, in effect, all of the electron density of one or more valence electrons has been transferred from the less electronegative group of elements to the more electronegative group of elements. In the case of a non-ionic compound the chemical bonds are non-ionic such meaning the compound will probably not dissolve in water or another polar solvent. Many non-ionic compounds have chemical bonds that share the electron density that binds them together. This type of chemical bond is either a non-polar covalent bond or a polar covalent bond. A functional group is very similar to a chemical species and a chemical group. A chemical group or chemical species exhibits a distinctive reaction behavior or a distinctive spectral signal when analyzed by various spectroscopic methods. These three groupings are often used to describe the groups of elements that exist within an organic molecule.  Examples of chemical names that describe the chemical state of a group of elements  The following list of neutral compounds, anions, cations, functional groups and chemical species is a partial list of the many groups of elements that can exhibit or have a unique \\"chemical state\\" while being part of the surface or the bulk of a solid state material.

The race currently offers a purse of $300,000.  History = Early beginnings = The race inaugurated in 1938 at Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood, California as the Hollywood Gold Cup. Hollywood Park Racetrack opened its doors on June 10, 1938, and Seabiscuit, under jockey George Woolf, won the $50,000 added race's inaugural running on July 16. The race was not run in 1942 or 1943, due to Hollywood Park being closed and used as an airplane parts storage depot during World War II. = Post World War II = In 1949, the Hollywood Gold Cup, as well as the entire 1949 meeting, was held at Santa Anita Park, due to a devastating fire at Hollywood Park on the night of May 5, 1949. Solidarity won the 1949 running on July 16. The Hollywood Park grandstand was rebuilt and the facility reopened in time for a two-part split 1950 season. The 1950 Hollywood Gold Cup, won by Noor, was held in the second part or Fall‚ÄìWinter part of the split, on December 9, 1950. The following summer, the race returned to its usual mid-July running and Citation, in his final race, won the Hollywood Gold Cup on July 14, 1951, becoming the first thoroughbred racehorse to hit the career earnings mark of one million dollars. = Modern Era= In 1980, Mary Lou Tuck became the first woman trainer to win the Hollywood Gold Cup with Go West Young Man. In 1999, the Blood-Horse magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century was published, and fourteen horses on the list had won the Hollywood Gold Cup: Citation, Affirmed, Round Table, Cigar, Swaps, Seabiscuit, Skip Away, Gallant Man, Challedon, Ack Ack, Native Diver, Noor, Two Lea and Exceller. In the 73rd running of the Hollywood Gold Cup in 2012, Chantal Sutherland, aboard Game On Dude, became the first female jockey to win the race. Game On Dude had also been Sutherland's mount in the previous year's running, finishing second by a nose to First Dude. The ride had given Sutherland the distinction of being the first female jockey to have a mount in the Hollywood Gold Cup. = Fillies or Mare winners = Only three fillies or mares have ever won the (Hollywood) Gold Cup. Happy Issue was the first in 1944, followed by Two Lea in 1952 and Princessnesian in 1968. = Change of venue = Following the closure of Hollywood Park, the race moved to Santa Anita Park in 2014 (where the race was run in 1949 because of a fire at Hollywood Park) and renamed the Gold Cup at Santa Anita Stakes. The event is a Breeders' Cup Classic \\"Win and You're In\\" qualifier. The event is one of the premier distance races on the West Coast of the United States, along with the Santa Anita Handicap from Santa Anita Park, and the Pacific Classic Stakes at Del Mar Racetrack. In 2020 the name of the event reverted to the Hollywood Gold Cup. =Race conditions= It was run as a handicap race until 1997, when it was switched to weight-for-age conditions. In 2005, the Gold Cup returned to the original handicap format.

Born in Moscow, Khazanov attended Moscow State University, where he received an M.A. in 1960. He earned a Ph.D. degree in 1966 and Dr.Sc. in 1976 from the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1990, he became Professor of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison; and at the moment he is the Ernest Gellner Professor of Anthropology (Emeritus). He is a Fellow of the British Academy, Corresponding Member of the UNESCO International Institute for the Study of Nomadic Civilizations, and Honorary Member of the Central Asian Studies Society; as well as the recipient of numerous grants and fellowships. Anatoly M. Khazanov started his professional career as an archaeologist specializing in the nomadic cultures of the Early Iron Age. In the second half of the 1960s he shifted to socio-cultural anthropology. From 1966-1985, his main fields of research were pastoral nomads and the origins of complex societies. His main argument that the nomads were never autarkic and therefore in economic, cultural, and political respects were dependent on their relations with the sedentary world, is shared now by the majority of experts in the field. On the other hand, Khazanov was trying as much as was possible under Soviet censorship, to demonstrate the fallacy of the Soviet Marxist concept of historical process. After his emigration in 1985 from the Soviet Union, Khazanov continued to study mobile pastoralists, paying particular attention to the role of nomads in world history and to the deficiences and shortcomings of their modernization process. He argued that various modernization projects have failed because they did not provide room for the sustained self-development of the pastoralists and denied their participation in decision-making. Since the beginning of the 1990s, Khazanov has also become known for his contribution to the study of ethnicity and nationalism, and transitions from communist rule. He was one of the first to argue that in many countries this transition does not guarantee an emergence of liberal democratic order. He also argued that, contrary to widespread opinion, globalization per se is unable to reduce nationalism and ethnic strife, which will remain a salient phenomenon in the foreseeable future. In the 2000s, Khazanov has also turned to the study of collective memory, collective representation, and other related issues; being particularly interested in their role in defining and redefining national and ethnic identities. Khazanov has written 6 monographs and around 200 articles. These include Nomads and the Outside World (Cambridge University Press, 1984; 2nd Edition University of Wisconsin Press, 1994), which has been translated into several languages; Soviet Nationality Policy During Perestroika (Delphic, 1991), and After the U.S.S.R.: Ethnicity, Nationalism, and Politics in the Commonwealth of Independent States (University of Wisconsin Press, 1995). He has also edited or co-edited 10 volumes of papers, including Pastoralism in the Levant: Archaeological Materials in the Anthropological Perspective (Prehistory Press, 1992) with Ofer Bar-Yosef, Changing Nomads in a Changing World (Sussex Academic Press, 1998) with Joseph Ginat, Nomads in the Sedentary World (Curzon Press, 2001) with Andr√© Wink, Perpetrators, Accomplices, and Victims in Twentieth Century Politics: Reckoning with the Past (Routledge, 2009) with Stanley Payne, and Who Owns the Stock?

It was the first shuttle bombing raid in the Second World War and the second use of a Master Bomber. In early June 1943, a Central Interpretation Unit photo interpreter (Claude Wavell) identified a stack of ribbed baskets (W√ºrzburg radar reflectors) at the Zeppelin Works. After Winston Churchill viewed the photos at RAF Medmenham on 14 June, No. 5 Group RAF received the surprise orders on 16 June to attack Friedrichshafen during the next full moon. On approach to the target, Wing Commander Gomm (No. 467 Squadron RAAF) assumed control of the operation when the aircraft of Group Captain Slee, the master bomber, developed trouble. The Main Force was ordered to bomb from rather than the planned due to heavy flak. In the first phase, the Pathfinder Force (PFF) and Wing Commander Gomm dropped Target Indicator bombs for the Main Force to aim at. In the second phase, as dust and smoke obscured the TIs, Gomm ordered the Main Force to use 'time-and-distance' bombing runs from a location on the Lake Constance shore along a measured distance to the target. The operation was successful. As well as damaging the radar factory, the bombers destroyed the unsuspected V-2 rocket production line also housed in the Zeppelin Works, so that Bellicose accidentally became the first Allied air strike against the German V-weapons programme. No Lancasters were lost. From Friedrichshafen the aircraft continued to the USAAF base at Maison Blanche (now Houari Boumediene Airport), Algeria. On 23‚Äì24 June, eight of the original force of sixty Lancasters remained in Algeria for repairs and the remaining 52 bombed the Italian naval base at La Spezia, damaging an \\"oil depot\\" and an \\"armaments store\\" and continued to Britain, again without loss. Background The Zeppelin shed, long by wide and high, had been built at Friedrichshafen- L√∂wenthal airfield (now Friedrichshafen Airport) in 1930‚Äì1931 and used by the Zeppelin company's last and largest airships, the LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, LZ 129 Hindenburg and LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II. After the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937 and the two Graf ships were broken up for scrap at Frankfurt in 1940, the vast hangar fell into disuse. In early 1943 it was dismantled and transported in sections on a specially laid track to a new location away in the industrial suburbs of Friedrichshafen, where it was reconstructed.Wilkinson 1991, pp.18‚Äì19. http://www.bodensee-airport.eu/en/the- company/flughafen-friedrichshafen-gmbh/portrait/history.php British aerial reconnaissance of southern Germany at this time was mainly carried out by de Havilland Mosquito PR IV and PR VIII aircraft of No. 540 Squadron RAF from RAF Benson, Oxfordshire.Sharp & Bowyer 1995, pp.127‚Äì130. The photographs were sent for assessment to the Central Interpretation Unit at Danesfield House, a 'large pseudo-Tudor mansion' near Medmenham, Buckinghamshire, from Benson.Millar 1974, pp.140‚Äì141, 145. At the beginning of June 1943, Squadron Leader Claude Wavell, head of G Section (Radar & Radio) at Medmenham, noticed stacks of ribbed metalwork lying outside the relocated Zeppelin shed in recent 'covers' of Friedrichshafen. The pattern of the stacks had changed between photographic sorties, implying activity, and Wavell identified the metalwork as parts for the distinctive lattice reflector dishes of Giant W√ºrzburg radar () sets.Downing 2011, p.260. The appearance and size of dishes had been known to British intelligence since 2 May 1942, when Flight Lieutenant A.E. 'Tony' Hill, in a Supermarine Spitfire PR IV of No.1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit from Benson, had taken low-level oblique pictures of a German radar station at Domburg on Walcheren Island, Belgium. The pictures showed two , pointed in different directions, so that the analysts got both a profile and a more full- face view. In the profile shot, a startled member was standing at the foot of the ladder to the control cabin behind the dish, giving scale to the picture.Jones 1978, p.227 and Plates 13b and 13c; Millar 1974, p.147. A previous oblique by Hill, taken on 15 December 1941, had shown an example of the original, much smaller set, with a sheet-metal dish, on a Normandy clifftop. This led to Operation Biting, the Bruneval Raid of 27‚Äì28 February 1942, in which C Company of 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment under Major (later Major-General) John Frost, parachuted from Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bombers of No. 51 Squadron RAF under Wing Commander Charles Pickard, stole the and brought it to England aboard Motor Gun Boat MGB 312 of the Royal Navy.Millar 1974, pp.13, 146‚Äì7, 167‚Äì181. In radar matters, Medmenham reported up to Dr R.V. Jones, Assistant Director of Intelligence (Science) at the Air Ministry. Jones's department, drawing on information from air reconnaissance, PoW interrogations, resistance agents in France and Belgium, Enigma cipher decrypts and the monitoring of radio traffic and radar signals by RAF ground stations and specially equipped bombers known as Ferrets, had built up a detailed knowledge of the German air-defence system.Millar 1974, pp.141‚Äì3; Jones 1978, pp.264‚Äì279. The was similar in signal to the original Bruneval , operating at 560 MHz, but it was more precise and longer-ranging due to its more powerful transmitter and its much larger reflector dish. By 1943, while the original was still in service with flak and searchlight batteries, the used the for ground-controlled interception, vectoring German night fighters on to British bombers. The were installed in pairs, as seen in Hill's Walcheren pictures, because one set tracked the bomber while the other tracked the fighter, until the fighter's airborne radar acquired the target.Price 1973, pp.19, 25, 29; Jones 1978, ibid. Jones mentioned the Friedrichshafen findings to Prime Minister Winston Churchill's chief scientific adviser, Lord Cherwell (Professor Frederick Lindemann), in whose Oxford laboratory Jones had once worked as a researcher. According to Wavell, Churchill visited Medmenham, viewed the Friedrichshafen covers and asked, \\"Have we been there yet?\\" Wavell said no; the RAF had not bombed Friedrichshafen. Cherwell had spoken to the Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal, and, with the Prime Minister's interest engaged, Operation Bellicose was ordered.Jones 1978, p.230; Millar 1974, p.41; Downing 2011, pp.260‚Äì261. Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, as Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief RAF Bomber Command, was in the midst of the Battle of the Ruhr, a campaign against the industrial conurbations of north-west Germany carried out from March to July 1943. These attacks, on targets only ninety minutes' flying time from Bomber Command bases, made use of the short spring and summer nights and also exploited the Oboe radar-ranging device, which enabled high-flying Mosquito bombers of No.8 Group (Pathfinder Force) to place their pyrotechnic Target Indicator (TI) bombs accurately.Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, pp.363‚Äì4. Reliant on signals from ground stations, Oboe was restricted by the curvature of the Earth to a range of from England.Price 1973, pp.39‚Äì40. Beyond Oboe range, the Pathfinders normally used a combination of visual methods and airborne ground-mapping H2S radar, with much less consistent results.Price 1973, p.40; Harris 2005, pp.166‚Äì7. Although Harris opposed 'precision' bombing as a general policy, in part because he felt it made bomber operations too predictable - \\"I do not believe in 'panacea' targets, e.g. oil, rubber, ball bearings. Specialising on one such means that the enemy concentrates all his defences\\" Harris to Lord Trenchard, 14 April 1943, quoted in Probert 2006, p.257.  Harris knew that his ‚Äòarea‚Äô bombing campaign against the Ruhr was incurring the same problem. \\"If I concentrated exclusively on north-west Germany for too long a time the enemy would shift his defences to that area, thereby economising in men and material and at the same time increasing our losses‚Ä¶ I had to take the earliest opportunity to carry out operations at greater range\\".Harris 2005, p.165. Since 10 June 1943, Harris had been under an Air Staff order known as the Pointblank Directive, which required him to give highest priority to targets associated with the German fighter force. This directive arose from the Combined Chiefs of Staff Conference in Washington, DC, in May.Probert 2006, pp.256‚Äì7. As Harris later wrote, \\"The 8th United States Army Air Force was to attack the principal airframe and other aircraft factories while my Command was to attack the industrial towns in which there was the largest number of aircraft component factories; most of these towns, as it happened, were further east or south than the Ruhr.\\" As a radar factory, the Zeppelin shed at Friedrichshafen was a valid and important Pointblank target, but an added attraction, in Harris's view, was its great distance from England: \\"A further reason for carrying out this rather elaborate operation was that it would help to spread the enemy‚Äôs defences; Friedrichshafen had every reason to consider itself safe from attack, especially in the summer months, and this unexpectedly deep penetration might well cause other places outside the more vulnerable areas to scream for defences\\".Harris 2005, p.166. Prelude =Plan= The obvious difficulty was that, with the target lying some 650 miles from Bomber Command's bases as the crow flies, or 800 miles by the best indirect tactical route, it was impossible for 200 mph bombers to fly there and back in darkness at midsummer. But the coast of North Africa was within the Lancaster's range and the USAAF agreed to receive the bombers at Blida and Maison Blanche, two American bases in Algeria. Although the Americans were not equipped to service Lancasters properly, they would at least be able to refuel and re-arm them. Harris's orders at this time required him to attack Italian targets when possible, as part of the government's policy to knock Italy out of the war, so he decided that the Friedrichshafen force would bomb the Italian naval base of La Spezia at dusk on the return flight to England.Harris 2005, ibid.; Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, p.417. Harris assigned the operation to Air Vice-Marshal the Hon. Ralph Cochrane‚Äôs No.5 Group. Harris had himself commanded 5 Group earlier in the war.Probert 2006, p.86. Under his immediate successor, Air Vice-Marshal John Slessor, it became the first bomber group to begin re-equipping with Lancasters; and under Air Vice-Marshal Alec Coryton Probert 2006, p.131. it had gained a reputation for daring low-level attacks. First came the Augsburg raid of 17 April 1942, when six Lancasters of No.44 Squadron and another six of No.97 Squadron - at that time the only two operational Lancaster squadrons - were dispatched in daylight to bomb the MAN factory producing diesel engines for U-boats, with the loss of seven aircraft from the dozen-strong force.Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, p.258. Next was Operation Robinson, the Le Creusot raid of 17 October 1942, when 94 Lancasters, led by Wing Commander Leonard Slee of No.49 Squadron, made a dusk attack on the Schneider-Creusot munitions complex in Burgundy, ingressing at treetop height from the Bay of Biscay and recovering to England in darkness, for the loss of only one aircraft. Reconnaissance pilot Tony Hill, whose pictures had done so much for British understanding of enemy radar, was shot down while attempting to take post-strike photographs of Le Creusot on 21 October. The Germans recovered him alive from the wreckage of the Spifire, and R.V. Jones, hearing this from the French Resistance, began to organise a rescue operation by special agents; but Hill died of his injuries before it could be put into effect.Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, p.317; Millar 1974, p.147. Cochrane, who took over 5 Group from Coryton in February 1943, soon oversaw Operation Chastise, the Dams Raid of 16/17 May, for which Harris ordered the creation of a special squadron, No.617 Squadron. The successful part of this operation - the attacks on the M√∂hne and Eder dams - had been controlled over VHF R/T by Wing Commander Guy Gibson. Cochrane decided to use the same method at Friedrichshafen and appointed Leonard Slee, by now a group captain, to lead the raid, with Wing Commander Cosme Lockwood Gomm of No. 467 Squadron RAAF as his deputy.Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, p.399. Although Cosme Gomm led a nominally Australian unit, he came from Brazil - his parents lived in S√£o Paulo - and only two of his crew were Australian.Chorley vol.iv 1996, p.269. =Time-and-distance bombing= Harris decided that Operation Bellicose should not be left to 5 Group alone and that the target should be marked by a small force of Pathfinder Lancasters from Air Vice-Marshal Don Bennett‚Äôs No.8 Group. This led to friction between Cochrane and Bennett. The historian Anthony Verrier, who interviewed both men in the 1960s, wrote that ‚Äòthe two Group commanders had a row - civil, but a row nonetheless - over the execution of the Friedrichshafen attack.‚ÄôVerrier 1974, pp.225-6. Cochrane wanted to use a new technique he was interested in, known as time-and-distance bombing. This required the crews to identify three landmarks lying in a straight line on the run-up to target. Between the first two landmarks the aircraft made a timed run to establish the true ground speed and wind drift. The navigator then calculated the time and heading from the third landmark to the bomb release point. Bombs were dropped blind.Middlebrook 2006, pp.50-51, 58. In principle, no marking was required. This addressed concerns over the accuracy of Pathfinder marking beyond Oboe range and also the problem that, even if the markers were on target, the dust and smoke of main-force bombing might obscure them.Verrier 1974, p.227. On the approach to Friedrichshafen the landmarks would be features of Lake Constance‚Äôs shore, which should be sufficiently distinct on a moon night. Since Harris was not allowing 5 Group a free hand, Cochrane and Bennett compromised. Picked Pathfinder crews would mark the target and would re-mark it throughout the attack. Cochrane‚Äôs main-force crews would bomb on the markers unless or until the raid controller decided that the markers were off-target or obscured, in which case time-and-distance bombing would be used.Bending 2006, p.60. The operation was now ‚Äòon call‚Äô for the next moon period, a matter of days away. On the morning of Wednesday 16 June, four Pathfinder crews of No.97 (Straits Settlements) Squadron at RAF Bourn, Cambridgeshire, were detailed to ‚Äòtake a week‚Äôs kit, and fly up to Scampton directly after lunch.‚Äô When one pilot asked why, his flight commander said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know. You‚Äôll get all the gen when you get there'.Bending 2006, ibid. This squadron, considered by Guy Gibson to be the best in Bomber Command,Gibson 2003, pp.181-182. had taken part in both the Augsburg and the Le Creusot raids and had transferred to the Pathfinders from 5 Group only in April.Bending 2006, p.47. Group Captain Slee had flown several trips with the squadron in summer 1942.Bending 2006, p.60. The four pilots whose crews were selected for Bellicose were Squadron Leader E.E. ‚ÄòRod‚Äô Rodley DFC, Flight Lieutenant J.H.J. ‚ÄòJohnnie‚Äô Sauvage DFC, Pilot Officer D.I. ‚ÄòJonah‚Äô Jones and Pilot Officer J.F. ‚ÄòJimmy‚Äô Munro RCAF. Rodley was on his second tour with the squadron and had flown on the Augsburg raid. Sauvage, a French volunteer from the Seychelles, was also highly experienced, having flown a previous tour on Handley Page Hampdens with No.44 Squadron.Bending 2006, pp.20-24, 48-9. Jones and Munro were on their first tour, but Munro had completed 28 operations and both he and Jones had recently been recommended for the Distinguished Flying Cross in recognition of their skill and tenacity.Bending 2006, pp.90, 65. At the 5 Group airfield at RAF Scampton, Lincolnshire, Slee gave the Pathfinders a preliminary briefing. He did not tell them the nature of the target, only that it was of special importance, that it was housed in the Zeppelin shed at Friedrichshafen and that it measured just 350 by 150 yards. (This would include the outside areas where Claude Wavell had identified the stacks of parts.) The Pathfinders would be marking for a force of 56 Lancaster crews selected from 5 Group's squadrons and the job required accuracy of ‚Äòthe highest order.‚Äô The marking tactics would be left to the Pathfinder captains themselves. Rodley recalled, ‚ÄòWe decided that the best way we could tackle this target would be to find a landmark on Lake Constance which we could pick up in night conditions, and make a timed run across the lake to find the Zeppelin sheds.‚Äô It was decided that Jones and Munro should aim to arrive one minute ahead of the others and at higher altitude. As they made landfall at Friedrichshafen they would begin dropping flares. Rodley and Sauvage, following on, would pick out the Zeppelin shed by flarelight and mark it with Target Indicator bombs. Rodley recalled that the TIs were to be ‚Äòalternate reds and greens, and when we got one on the roof of the sheds, we would broadcast to the Main Force to bomb the red or the green, as the case might be.‚Äô In fact it would be Slee or Gomm who made the call. Low flying would be needed to avoid detection en route to the target, so the Pathfinder crews flew low-level cross-country exercises that night and the next, visiting the giant airship sheds at RAF Cardington, Bedfordshire. On the night of 18 June, a dress rehearsal was held, with the Pathfinders illuminating and marking a target on the bombing range at RAF Wainfleet, on the Lincolnshire coast, for the 5 Group force. The crews were confined to camp when not flying and were forbidden to use the telephone.Bending 2006, pp.60-61. Group Captain Slee held the full briefing for the 25 Pathfinder and 5 Group crews based at Scampton on the morning of 19 June. The crews now learned almost the whole plan, including the surprise onward flight to North Africa and the assignment of a second, still undisclosed target for the return flight. Some crews managed to draw tropical kit from the stores: pith helmets, desert boots and khaki shirts and shorts. The weather was later predicted to be unsuitable at Friedrichshafen that night, so the operation was postponed for 24 hours.Bending 2006, p.61. However, 290 Halifaxes, Stirlings and Lancasters of 3, 4, 6 and 8 Groups carried out another attack on the Schneider works at Le Creusot. Instead of TIs, the Pathfinders dropped large numbers of flares. The main force was supposed to identify the target visually, but crews found it hard to see through the dazzle and smoke of so many flares. A fifth of the bombloads did hit the Schneider works, but residential areas were also heavily damaged.Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, pp.398-9. =Lake Constance= At its north-west end, Lake Constance is divided in two by a ten-mile spit of land with the German city of Konstanz at the tip, providing a good pinpoint.Bending 2006, pp.62, 89. From Konstanz, Friedrichshafen lies 15 miles due east across the water; it is set in a bay, and the bombers‚Äô track would take them directly over the near headland of the bay after 8 miles. At 12.5 miles, less than a minute from target, the bombers would cross the eastern shore at a shallow angle.The Times Atlas of the World, Concise Edition, London 1994, p.41. The same three reference points would serve for time-and-distance bombing by the main force. Attack =Outbound= On Sunday 20 June, Bomber Command ordered Bellicose to go ahead. Take-off was made in the usual radio silence from 21.45. The Pathfinder Lancasters were loaded to 2,000 lb over the current all-up limit of 63,000 lb, with a full fuel load of 2,154 gallons as well as oil, crew, machine-gun ammunition, flares, TIs and high explosive. In case anyone was shot down, every Pathfinder carried six 250 lb TIs - three red, three green - sixteen flares and eight 500 lb bombs.Bending 2006, p.61; Holmes 2002, p.79; http://www.97squadronassociation.co.uk/opbellicose.html The overload factor was a particular concern because Scampton still had uneven grass runways.Bowman 2014, pp.54-5. However, the bombers all cleared the hedge and lifted through the evening mist without trouble. The crews could see Lancasters climbing out of 5 Group's other bases to join the loose formation. The force headed west of London and turned south over Reading, Berkshire, for the headland of Selsey Bill on the Sussex coast, climbing all the time, as high as they could go, to make allowance for the flak defences of enemy-held Normandy. At Selsey Bill they circled to let the light fade before crossing the English Channel. They set course into a belt of thunderstorms. These were a danger, but only one aircraft encountered serious trouble, and that was the Master Bomber's. At present, Leonard Slee was station commander at RAF Dunholme Lodge and technically not an operational pilot, so he was riding as ‚Äòsecond dickey‚Äô in the flight engineer's seat aboard a 49 Squadron Lancaster. The skipper was Gerry Fawke, who would later become a flight commander with 617 Squadron.Jacobs 2017, pp.98-9; Brickhill 1983, p.215. Crossing the enemy coast blind, in dense thundercloud at 19,000 feet, Fawke had just begun losing height to get under the storm when the Lancaster was engaged by radar- predicted flak. The navigator, whose radio aids were out of action due to the storm's interference, said he was not sure where they were. It might be Caen, or else the strongly defended E-boat base at Le Havre. On board, to observe the Friedrichshafen flak defences, was 5 Group's army flak liaison officer, Major Mullock. He estimated that four four-gun batteries of heavy 88s were firing on this one aircraft. Gerry Fawke took evasive action, turning 30 degrees each way every eight seconds while switchbacking up and down 1,000 feet at a time, all on instruments. The bomber got through.Jacobs 2017, ibid.; Bowman 2014, p.56. Jimmy Munro of 97 Squadron, passing dead on track over the correct ingress point, the high-class seaside resort of Cabourg (‚ÄòBalbec‚Äô in Marcel Proust‚Äôs novels), between Caen and Le Havre, attracted some light flak, but it was out of range.Bending 2006, p.89. The force turned south-east, descending to 10,000 feet by the time they reached Orl√©ans. The worst of the weather behind them now, they swung east for the long straight run to Germany, still descending, down to 3,000 feet or below.Bowman 2014, p.55; Bending 2006, pp.61, 89. Although the German radar belt extended through eastern France to the Swiss frontier,Jones 1978, map p.278. extreme low flying was not considered necessary or advisable. Upland terrain restricted the enemy's radar coverage, and the heavily laden, slow-climbing bombers needed enough height in hand to cross the southern edge of the Vosges mountain range just before the Rhine. Not far short of the Vosges, at 45 minutes from target, Fawke's No.2 engine, the port inner, began emitting sparks. It may have been flak-damaged. Fawke shut it down and feathered the prop.Bowman 2014, p.56; Jacobs 2017, pp.99-100. In Doug Jones's Pathfinder aircraft, the bomb aimer, Flying Officer Tom Hodkinson, lying in the nose, called out the Rhine and, as the force crossed the river into Germany, north of Basel, Jones began climbing to attack height.Bowman 2014, p.55. The route curved around the northern border of neutral Switzerland towards Friedrichshafen. Fawke unfeathered his No.2 prop to turn the engine, because the port inner powered the Lancaster's Mark XIV bomb sight computer, but the engine then caught fire. Fawke jettisoned the bombload and dived to starboard, into Swiss airspace, so that the crew could bail out if need be, but the Graviner fire extinguisher system killed the fire and Fawke resumed course to target. Group Captain Slee did, however, break radio silence to tell Gomm to take command.Bowman 2014, p.56; Jacobs 2017, ibid. Jimmy Munro saw the Swiss illuminate several searchlights and fire a few warning flak shells, probably because of the master bomber's incursion. Munro kept going, pinpointed on the cape of Konstanz and circled to lose time. At H-Hour minus four minutes, he set off across the lake to Friedrichshafen. =Bombing= The town stayed dark. German flak and searchlight crews were disciplined and would not break the blackout for aircraft that might simply pass by. As Munro's Lancaster made landfall on the eastern shore at 12,000 feet, the bomb aimer, Sergeant Eric Suswain, hit the button to begin releasing the first batch of eight large reconnaissance flares. Moments later, over to port, another string of flares appeared from Doug Jones's aircraft. Without sight of each other since the Channel, both Illuminator crews had arrived exactly on time and target, almost in formation.Bending 2006, pp.89-90. Rod Rodley, a minute behind and slightly below, aimed his aircraft so that it would run between the two flare lanes. The buildings of Friedrichshafen appeared in the glow and Rodley's bomb aimer, Sergeant Rae, picked out the Zeppelin shed. From reconnaissance photographs and pilots‚Äô reports, Major Mullock had estimated that Friedrichshafen was defended by 16-20 heavy and 18-20 light flak guns and 25 searchlights, all within a 6-8 mile radius of the target.Bowman 2014, p.56. Harris considered these defences ‚Äòcomparatively light‚Äô. As the flares were laid, signalling imminent attack, the guns and searchlights sprang to life and opened up on the Pathfinders. Predicted flak burst so close to Munro's aircraft that the crew heard the shell fragments patter on the alloy skin. As the timer released Munro's last flare, one searchlight, then perhaps a dozen more, locked on to the Lancaster. Munro made a series of diving turns to escape and levelled off in the dark at 2,000 feet indicated. That was about 700 feet above the local terrain.Bending 2006, pp.62, 90 The approaching main force bombers were at 5,000 to 10,000 feet. Slee decided this was too low, given the strength of the enemy reaction, and he told Gomm to order the whole force to climb 5,000 feet higher.Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, p.399; Bending 2006, p.62; Bowman 2014, p.56. A loaded Lancaster at normal climb power, 2,650 rpm and +7 psi boost, would take 30 miles to do this,Air Ministry 1944, graph p.31. so the nearest crews, already turning for the bomb run over the lake, would need to use maximum climb power, 2,850 +9. Rodley and Sauvage ignored the order: they were already over Friedrichshafen, Rodley at 10,500 feet, Sauvage at 9,000. Rodley was busy with his bomb run, so intent on Rae's instructions that he hardly noticed the flak bursting all around him, except to correct for the buffets. As Rae let go the green TI, still well short of target to allow for the bomb's forward travel, the candles of a red marker, which could only have come from Sauvage's aircraft, cascaded on to the Zeppelin shed's roof and tumbled over the side. Rodley recalled, ‚ÄòI thought at the time that you couldn‚Äôt do better than that.‚Äô Bending 2006, p.62; http://www.97squadronassociation.co.uk.opbellicose.html Gomm, however, thought the red was a mile and a half east of the target. How either he, or the Pathfinders, could have mistaken the vast Zeppelin shed for any other structure in the area is not known. Moments later, Rodley's green TI burst over the town (the 97 Squadron record-book clerk would mistakenly record it as a red) and Gomm thought it was 400 yards east of target, more than a mile from Sauvage's red, even though Rodley thought he was aiming at the same thing as Sauvage. Gomm's aircraft now dropped flares and a green TI which Gomm claimed was on target; he said the Pathfinders asked for permission to back it, which was given. He reported that he ordered the main force to ‚Äòbomb visually‚Äô, implying that they had to identify the target themselves as at Le Creusot, despite the fact that he claimed the flare illumination was inadequate and the moonlight was dimmed by a thin sheet of cloud high up, but he may have meant that he ordered the crews to bomb his green. To add to the general confusion, Gomm's watch seems to have been set an hour ahead of everyone else's, or else he misremembered the time when debriefing. Gomm said the time was about 02.40, but Slee's crew and the Swiss people watching from across the lake made it 01.40, Double British Summer Time and West European Summer Time being the same.Bowman 2014, p.58; Bending 2006, p.66; http://www.bottesfordhistory.org.uk/content/topics/on-the-wings-of-the- morning-by-vincent-holyoak/chapter-11-shuttle-to-friedrichshaven The main force began bombing, the Pathfinders circling back over the lake to re- illuminate and re-mark the target. Munro had to fly a long circuit to regain lost height and made only one more run, this time releasing his eight high- explosive 500-pounders as well as flares. Suswain aimed the bombs at a green TI dropped by Rodley or Sauvage or Gomm and had the satisfaction of seeing them hit the target. The searchlights found the bomber again and Munro evaded with a diving turn.Bending 2006, p.90; http://www.97squadronassociation.co.uk/opbellicose.html Jones made four more runs. On one, watched by the Swiss across the water, he was coned by searchlights and made a shallow dive at near maximum speed (360 mph indicated), faster than the searchlight crews could follow. Now down below the marker aircraft, he had to abandon another run because at that height the shockwaves from the main force's bombs, particularly the 4,000 lb ‚Äòcookies‚Äô, made it impossible to keep the Lancaster steady. Sauvage's aircraft was hit by flak on its fourth run and took hydraulic damage, one of the undercarriage legs dropping partway.Bending 2006, pp.62, 66; Air Ministry 1944, p.28; Bowman 2014, p.58. The orbiting Pathfinders attracted most of the defenders‚Äô attention, and the main force was almost unscathed, except for a single 619 Squadron crew whose bomb aimer was killed by a flak fragment.Bending 2006, pp.62-3. Although the Pathfinders continued to re-mark, Gomm called for the remaining main-force crews to use time-and-distance bombing as the dust hid the markers. Rodley also considered that the bombing had become ‚Äòwild‚Äô by this time. Gomm thought the time-and-distance order was given at 02.47; everyone else thought it was an hour earlier.Bending 2006, p.62; Lawrence 1951, pp.142-3; http://www.97squadronassociation.co.uk/opbellicose.html; http://www.bottesfordhistory.org.uk/content/topics/on-the-wings-of-the- morning-by-vincent-holyoak/chapter-11-shuttle-to-friedrichshaven Watchers on the Swiss side of Lake Constance, who saw the upward spray of searchlights and flak shells, the falling flares and TIs, the flash of bomb impacts and the bright fires taking hold, reported a ‚Äòconcentrated attack on the selected target,‚Äô up to about 2.00am. Houses at the south end of the lake ten miles away were shaken by the explosions.Bending 2006, p.66. The last bombs went in at 01:58 and Slee, 13 minutes after arriving, announced that the attack was complete and all crews should leave the target area. By now only the master bombers and the Pathfinders were left. They turned south-east after the main force to cross the Central Eastern Alps of Austria, the snowy mountains looking blue in the moonlight. To clear the peaks it was necessary to climb to 14,000 feet in 60 miles. Gerry Fawke, Slee's pilot, had to do this on three engines with a heavy fuel load still aboard, which was not in the manual.Bowman 2014, p.57; Air Ministry 1944, p.34. Once past the edge of Swiss territory, the bombers tracked south-west for the Italian Lakes. German night fighter airfields, and ground radar stations, were mainly concentrated in a defensive line across north-east France, the Low Countries, north-west Germany and Denmark.Price 1973, pp.19, 37. When the RAF raiders were reported at Friedrichshafen, 300‚Äì400 miles away, the Luftwaffe controller decided to marshal his fighters over the bases of Florennes, near Charleroi, and Juvincourt, near Reims, to catch the bomber force on its return.Bowman 2014, p.58; Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, p.400. This was the logical course of action; but, as the fighters circled and waited, using up their fuel, the bombers were more than halfway to Africa. =Mediterranean crossing= Over the Apennine Mountains, then the Italian Riviera and the Mediterranean, the Lancaster force kept loose formation for protection as the sun came up. Italian fighters were a possible threat, and the Luftwaffe's Nachtjagdgeschwader 2 (2nd Night Fighter Wing) was based in Italy, but the bombers had descended to low altitude again and seemed to be undetected.Bending 2006, p.62; Middlebrook 2006, p.251. Off the Italian coast, Johnnie Sauvage and his crew saw Rod Rodley's Lancaster, just ahead of them, engulfed in a sudden red fireball. Rodley's flight engineer, Flight Sergeant Duffy, checked an inspection port and said the fire was in the bomb bay. Rodley realised that the vermilion glow was that of a red TI. The bomber was carrying a TI that the bomb aimer had fused from his switching panel but had not dropped, and, as the Lancaster descended, the barometric fuse had blown the bomb's tail off and ejected the pyrotechnic candles into the bomb bay. Rodley opened the bomb doors and Sauvage's crew saw the fireball fall away into the sea. But the explosion had damaged the hydraulic lines: Rodley could not close the bomb doors properly and the flaps were drooping.Bending 2006, p.63; Price 1973, p.44; Bowman 2014, p.57. =Maison Blanche= There was fog over the North African coast and the American controllers at Blida airfield refused to let the bombers land. The entire force found itself circling over Maison Blanche, where the visibility was better. They had now been airborne for ten hours and, despite flying slowly at minimum power settings since Italy, they were on the last of their fuel: most of the flight had been at low level in warm air, which increased the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines‚Äô fuel consumption. It was difficult to see how, under normal procedures, they could all be landed in time. The US flying control officer drove in a radio-equipped Willys MB jeep to the end of the runway, began firing flares from a Very pistol so that everyone could see where to land and radioed, ‚ÄòWell, all right, fellas, all come in, position yourselves and all come in as quick as you can.‚Äô Pilot Officer Arthur Spencer, Jimmy Munro's navigator, remembered the American adding, ‚ÄòFirst man to make home base wins!‚Äô Rod Rodley recalled, ‚ÄòAt one time, I saw one aircraft turning off at the end of the runway, one aircraft about three-quarters of the way down the runway, and one turning in on finals. I think we got about fifty aircraft down in ten minutes!‚Äô Bending 2006, p.63. Munro landed safely at 07.45, just after Doug Jones. Group Captain Slee, in Gerry Fawke's aircraft, landed at 07.52, Rod Rodley following at 07.55. Johnnie Sauvage, having reported his damaged undercarriage, was told to wait till last in case he blocked the runway. At 08.04, with fuel critical, he called, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre coming in!‚Äô He touched down on his one good wheel, but, as the bomber's weight settled, the other undercarriage leg collapsed and the Lancaster slewed off the runway at speed and spun around, raising clouds of desert dust, till it came to rest. The crew got out unhurt but the bomber was a write-off.http://www.97squadronassociation.co.uk/opbellicose.html ; Bending 2006, pp.63, 90; Bowman 2014, p.57. The crews spent the next couple of days at Maison Blanche. The Americans advised men without tropical kit not to go off base, despite the lure of shops selling fruit and wine not available in wartime Britain. Sauvage's wireless operator, Flight Sergeant Eddie Wheeler, ignored this instruction and was briefly detained by Algerian police who thought his blue RAF uniform looked German. Sauvage himself did have tropical kit, but there had been no time to add rank badges and, when he walked into the US officers‚Äô mess for a meal, one of the Americans accused him of not being an officer. Sauvage, in the French accent that made him so popular with the girls in the pubs of Cambridge, treated the American to an exhibition of colloquial English invective which only an officer would dare to use, and encountered no further problems.Bending 2006, pp.49, 63-4. =La Spezia raid= On 23 June the crews of the 52 undamaged and serviceable Lancasters were briefed for the return to England, with a dusk attack on La Spezia en route. The Rodley and Sauvage crews would remain behind until Rodley's Lancaster was sufficiently repaired to take Sauvage's crew home via Gibraltar. Several main-force crews, and the master bomber's, also had to wait for repairs. Munro and Jones were detailed to illuminate and mark La Spezia with their spare TIs and flares, and their Lancasters were also armed with eight 500 lb high-explosive bombs and six 500 lb incendiary containers each. Munro took off at 19.40 to open the attack, Jones at 19.55 to follow on. The weather over La Spezia was cloudless, but there was haze and the Italians seemed to put up a smoke screen. Although bomb impacts were not seen, both Pathfinder crews reported a very large explosion on the ground, possibly an oil-storage tank going up, at 23.45. The bomber force again dropped to low level across France and again the German night fighters failed to intercept. There were no losses. Jones reached Scampton at 04.09, Munro at 04.12, every 5 Group bomber also recovering safely. The two Pathfinder crews were greeted and debriefed by senior officers at Scampton, slept for a few hours and flew home to Bourn later that day.Bending 2006, p.64; Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, p.401; http://www.97squadronassociation.co.uk/opbellicose.html Aftermath =Analysis= On the day after the attack, a Mosquito photographed the target for Medmenham to assess the damage. The pictures showed that the roof of the great Zeppelin shed was intact but half of the northern wall had been blown out and the damage to the radar-antenna factory inside was likely to be severe. Two nearby factories, producing tank engines and gearboxes, had also been severely damaged. The raid had been a partial success. Later, with the aid of the bombing photographs, it was judged that only 9 per cent of the bomb loads had hit the small target area. Although 5 Group sought to claim that the Pathfinder marking was off, the Pathfinders noted that the off-target strikes were mostly to the north-east. The wind had been from the south-west and Slee's order to the main force to climb another 5,000 feet had lifted the bombers into a stronger wind. Most of the crews had not had time to assess the new drift and their bomb sights were wrongly set; 5 Group claimed that the crews using time-and-distance had bombed more accurately, but later experience with this technique would suggest that the margin of error was far too great for such a small target. The bombing was concentrated in the industrial area and casualties in Friedrichshafen were relatively light, with 44 people killed.Bending 2006, p.63; Lake 2002, p.65; Middlebrook 2006, pp.51, 60; Harris 2005, pp.182-183; Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, p.400. =Decorations= On 14 July, the DFCs already recommended for Jones and Munro were gazetted. On 17 August, Rodley and Sauvage were each awarded the Bar to the DFC for their actions at Friedrichshafen. Eric Suswain was awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal and later commissioned. Rodley and Sauvage would each be awarded the Distinguished Service Order on completing their Pathfinder tours in the autumn. John Duffy would be awarded the DFM, his citation particularly mentioning his prompt action when the TI exploded aboard Rodley's bomber.Bending 2006, pp.170, 172, 174, 175-176; http://www.97squadronassociation.co.uk/opbellicose.html =Subsequent operations= Schweinfurt‚ÄìRegensburg mission On 17 August, the US Eighth Air Force staged its first deep-penetration raids on Germany. To begin, 147 Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bombers in three combat wings made for the Messerschmitt Bf 109 production plant at Regensburg in Bavaria, a key Pointblank target. Three hours later, 230 B-17s in four combat wings set off for the ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt, important to aero-engine production. The Republic P-47 Thunderbolt escort fighters, despite carrying a 108-gallon drop tank each, had to turn back at the German border. As soon as they did, both bomber formations came under attack from relays of German fighters. Twenty-four of the Regensburg force and twenty-one of the Schweinfurt force were shot down. Conditions were clear over both targets and bombing was accurate, though in neither case was production interrupted for more than a week. The Regensburg force then adopted the Bellicose ‚Äòshuttle‚Äô tactic and flew on to North Africa without further loss, except for aircraft which ran out of fuel and had to ditch in the Med. Meanwhile, one more bomber of the Schweinfurt force was shot down by flak over the target, and another fourteen fell to fighter attacks on the return journey, until the Thunderbolts reappeared. A week later, the Regensburg force would return to England, attacking the Luftwaffe air base at Bordeaux along the way, but they left 55 bombers behind. Some had ditched in the Med; most had been abandoned as unrepairable at the North African airfields. Another three were lost on the return flight. Only 65 reached home base. In total the Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission cost 118 out of the 377 B-17s, a loss of 31 per cent.Price 1973, pp.66, 85-87. Peenem√ºnde Raid On the night of 17/18 August, again under a full moon, Bomber Command sent 597 aircraft, including Rodley's, Sauvage's and Munro's, to the German rocket research establishment on the Baltic Sea coast at Peenem√ºnde. The large-scale American operation earlier in the day was likely to have inflicted losses on German single- and twin-engined fighter units and to have drawn many fighters down to airfields in southern Germany to recover. Middlebrook 2006, p.64. To avoid any public panic at the threat of German secret weapons, crews were told that the target was another radar factory. Middlebrook 2006, p.77. This attack, Operation Hydra, was made possible largely by experience gained in Operation Bellicose. Again the raid was controlled by a Master Bomber, this time Group Captain John Searby, commander of No.83 Pathfinder Squadron. His task was complicated by the use of three aiming points in succession: the living quarters, the production works and the experimental works. Results were, as usual, mixed, but Searby's calm instructions more than once retrieved the situation. Most importantly he persuaded the early waves to stop bombing a misplaced TI on the Polish slave labour camp at Trassenheide to the south, though not before 500 slave workers were killed in just a few minutes.Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, pp.422-424; Searby 1988, pp.156-7. 5 Group attacked last, and Cochrane's crews were authorised to use time-and-distance if the Pathfinder markers were obscured or off-target. In their first range practice for this attack, 5 Group had averaged a 1,000-yard error using time-and-distance. At the second attempt they brought the error down to 300 yards. On the actual target, time-and- distance crews whose photographs could be plotted (many pictures just showed smoke) mostly bombed short or wide by up to a mile and a quarter, into the sea or open country, only three of them hitting the target area, the experimental works. Crews who bombed on the Pathfinder markers had mostly hit the wrong aiming point, the production works slightly further south, but they did at least hit something. Again 5 Group claimed that time-and-distance was more accurate, but the method would soon fall out of use.Middlebrook 2006, pp.60-61, 212-213. To distract the German night fighters, eight Mosquitos of the Pathfinders‚Äô No.139 (Jamaica) Squadron, now commanded by Leonard Slee, dropped TIs on Berlin to simulate the opening of a major attack. This ruse had not been tried before. The German controller, who had never heard of Peenem√ºnde, naturally assumed that the inbound main force was also headed for Berlin and marshalled his fighters over the capital. Some 30-35 fighters eventually flew to investigate the distant visible fires at Peenem√ºnde on their own initiative, shooting down 40 bombers at the tail end of the stream, a loss of 6.7% for Bomber Command.Middlebrook 2006, pp.109-111, 159, 210. This was considered acceptable for such an important target, when the moonlight conditions favoured the defence. The Germans, however, lost at least six fighters shot down by the bombers, a loss of 17-20% for the intercepting force, plus five or six more shot down away from the target area by prowling Beaufighters and Mosquitos of Fighter Command.Middlebrook 2006, pp.214-215. The raid was later estimated to have delayed the V-2 rocket programme by two months.Middlebrook 2006, p.222. Raid on Friedrichshafen, 27/28 April 1944 In the spring of 1944, the Air Ministry requested a further raid on Friedrichshafen, this time aimed at the tank engine and gearbox factories close to the Zeppelin shed. It was particularly important to disrupt German tank production in the lead-up to the Allied invasion of the Continent. The attack again required moonlight, which increased the hazard of interception, especially on such a long flight. On the night of 27/28 April, Bomber Command detailed 322 Lancasters and one Mosquito. The German night fighters arrived over the target during the raid and 18 Lancasters were shot down, 5.6% of the force. However, marking and bombing were accurate and the bombers delivered some 1,200 tons on target. Just under 100 acres of the town were destroyed including the ZF (Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen) gearbox factory, whose lost output could not be made good. German officials later told the United States Strategic Bombing Survey that this was the most effective air attack on German tank production during the war.Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, pp.500-501. The effect of Operation Bellicose on W√ºrzburg radar production was less clear-cut. Though Bomber Command estimated the factory 50% destroyed, it only produced the large reflector dishes, not the electronics, which were made by Telefunken in Ulm. But at the war's end Dr R.V. Jones learned from the Germans that Bellicose had caused the abandonment of the unsuspected V-2 production line in the Zeppelin shed, after only a few fuel tanks and fuselage sections had been produced.Jones 1978, p.348\\" When the RAF struck at Peenem√ºnde as well, V-2 production was concentrated at an underground factory known as Mittelwerk, near Nordhausen. Bomber Command attacked Nordhausen with 247 Lancasters and eight Mosquitos on 3 April 1945, targeting what the British believed to be a military depot, which was in fact the forced-labour camp serving Mittelwerk. A large but unknown number of the work prisoners were killed.Middlebrook & Everitt 2000, pp.690‚Äì691. Later careers Leonard Slee survived the war and retired from the RAF in the early 1950s after serving as British air attach√© in Brussels. Gerry Fawke took part in 617 Squadron's attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz and other high-priority targets. He survived the war. Cosme Gomm was killed in action with all but one of his crew on the Milan raid of 15/16 August 1943. He lies in St-Desir War Cemetery near Chartres, where his Lancaster, PO-Y for Yorker of 467 Squadron, ED998, was brought down by an enemy night fighter.Chorley 1996 vol.iv, p.269.

He survived the war and became a civil airline pilot, ending his career as a Boeing 747 captain with Olympic Airways.https://www.spink.com/lot/18002000511 Johnnie Sauvage survived the war and became an airline executive with British Eagle and later chairman of Thomson Travel Group, receiving the OBE in 1975 for services to the airline industry. He lived to be 100 years old. 'Obituary: Squadron Leader John Sauvage', Daily Telegraph, 22 April 2019. Doug ‚ÄòJonah‚Äô Jones, just nineteen at the time of Bellicose, survived the war. Jimmy Munro completed his Pathfinder tour of 45 operations and volunteered for a further tour of fifteen trips. He was killed in action on his 57th operation, the Berlin raid of 22/23 November 1943. The aircraft, 97 Squadron's OF-J for Johnnie, JB227, was lost without trace and the crew, including Johnnie Sauvage's bomb aimer from the Friedrichshafen raid, Flight Lieutenant Peter Burbridge DFC, and Doug Jones's navigator, Flight Lieutenant Jimmy Silk DFM, are commemorated on the Air Forces Memorial to the missing at Runnymede.Bending 2006, p.94; Bowman 2014, p.58; Chorley 1996 vol.iv, p.391.

The protein encoded by this gene, NT-3, is a neurotrophic factor in the NGF (Nerve Growth Factor) family of neurotrophins. It is a protein growth factor which has activity on certain neurons of the peripheral and central nervous system; it helps to support the survival and differentiation of existing neurons, and encourages the growth and differentiation of new neurons and synapses. NT-3 was the third neurotrophic factor to be characterized, after nerve growth factor (NGF) and BDNF (Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor). Function Although the vast majority of neurons in the mammalian brain are formed prenatally, parts of the adult brain retain the ability to grow new neurons from neural stem cells; a process known as neurogenesis. Neurotrophins are chemicals that help to stimulate and control neurogenesis. NT-3 is unique in the number of neurons it can potentially stimulate, given its ability to activate two of the receptor tyrosine kinase neurotrophin receptors (TrkC and TrkB ‚Äì see below). Mice born without the ability to make NT-3 have loss of proprioceptive and subsets of mechanoreceptive sensory neurons. Mechanism of action NT-3 binds three receptors on the surface of cells which are capable of responding to this growth factor: * TrkC (pronounced \\"Track C\\"), is apparently the \\"physiologic\\" receptor, in that it binds with greatest affinity to NT-3. * However, NT-3 is capable of binding and signaling through a TrkC- related receptors called TrkB. * Finally, NT-3 also binds a second-receptor type besides Trk receptors, called the LNGFR (for \\"low affinity nerve growth factor receptor). =High affinity receptors= TrkC is a receptor tyrosine kinase (meaning it mediates its actions by causing the addition of phosphate molecules on certain tyrosines in the cell, activating cellular signaling). As mentioned above, there are other related Trk receptors, TrkA and TrkB. Also as mentioned, there are other neurotrophic factors structurally related to NT-3: * NGF (for \\"Nerve Growth Factor\\") * BDNF (for \\"Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor\\") * NT-4 (for \\"Neurotrophin-4\\") While TrkB mediates the effects of BDNF, NT-4, and NT-3, TrkA binds and is activated by NGF, and TrkC binds and is activated only by NT-3. =Low affinity receptors= The other NT-3 receptor, the LNGFR, plays a somewhat less clear role. Some researchers have shown the LNGFR binds and serves as a \\"sink\\" for neurotrophins. The crystal structure of NT-3 shows that NT-3 forms a central homodimer around which two glycosylated p75 LNGFR molecules bind symmetrically. The symmetrical binding takes place along the NT-3 interfaces, resulting in a 2:2 ligand-receptor cluster in the center. Cells which express both the LNGFR and the Trk receptors might therefore have a greater activity ‚Äì since they have a higher \\"microconcentration\\" of the neurotrophin. It has also been shown, however, that the LNGFR may signal a cell to die via apoptosis ‚Äì so therefore cells expressing the LNGFR in the absence of Trk receptors may die rather than live in the presence of a neurotrophin.

Introduction Due a change in NZR's dieselisation strategy the original order for 21 DF class locomotives was changed to 42 DG class locomotives, being a half-sized version of the DF with only one cab instead of two, and a similar Bulldog nose. English Electric, as they did with many of their diesel locomotives of the 1950s-60s, did not assemble them at the Preston works, but allocated the final assembly of build numbers 2254/E7821-2273/E7840 (road no. 750-769) to Robert Stephenson & Hawthorn and build numbers 2274/D353-2295/D374 (road no. 770-791) to Vulcan Foundry, both English Electric plants. The South Island allocated locomotives were initially classified DH because they were fitted with adjustable bogies that allowed a higher maximum axle weight and tractive effort The DG and DH axle loading was . By adjusting the spring beams the DH adhesive weight increased to and the tractive effort to .  In service  The first regular outing by a DG class locomotive was that of DG 750 in August 1955 when it was sent with 88-seater railcar RM 100, an English Electric DF class locomotive, and a newly arrived Drewry DSB class shunting locomotive to the Wanganui Industrial Fair. Shortly after the class took over workings in the Wairarapa area following the completion of the Rimutaka Tunnel and also the Murupara Branch from the older DE class. These locomotives usually worked in multiple as they were relatively low-powered, although they did occasionally run on their own. With the arrival of enough DA class locomotives in the North Island, the DG locomotives from the North Island were transferred progressively south with the introduction of the rail ferry in 1962, with this process completed by 1976. As a result, the DH class locomotives were converted to DG class standards in 1968 and received the DG classification, allowing the DH classification to be re-used in 1978. With the introduction of DJ class locomotives from 1968 the class was usually relegated to \\"slave\\" status. The introduction of the new DF class further displaced the class. = Renumbering = The introduction of the Traffic Monitoring System (TMS) in 1979 saw the locomotives renumbered DG2007 - DG2497. Rebuilds In the late 1970s, the DG class was reaching the end of its designated working life with a litany of problems: * Mechanical and electrical failures were occurring on a regular basis. * The EE 6SKRT engine blocks were cracking due to premature wear. * Working conditions on the locomotives were known to be poor as well. There were no crew amenities, and the cabs were draughty. In an attempt to modernise the DG class and extend the working lives of the locomotives, Chief Mechanical Engineer Graham Alecock was requested to prepare a plan to equip the DG class locomotives with new cabs that would be more crew-friendly and improved equipment. The decision was taken to rebuild DG 760, then due for an overhaul at Hillside Workshops as the prototype for the rebuilds. The new cab was designed in-house by NZR, who then took the unusual step of contracting NZR's Westport Workshops to build them on Hillside's behalf. The cab itself was larger than the original DG cab, which required the low nose at the front to be shortened. The whole assembly had a pronounced box-like shape, with 45¬∞ angles to the cab roof and low nose. The new cab featured four windscreens to the original three, while the low nose had a larger doorway to access the new Westinghouse 26L air-brake equipment and also gave provision for a short walkway on either side of the nose. The small windows were the same as used on the DX class locomotives to improve standardisation on locomotives. Mechanically, the locomotive's front traction motor blower was shifted to a position above the main generator, while new thermostat valves were fitted in an attempt to prevent the overheating problems that had plagued the locomotives under load. The original Westinghouse A7EL brake system was replaced by the more modern 26L system, actuated by a new push-button console in the cab. The traction motors were also upgraded, while welding repairs were conducted on the 6SKRT engine blocks. Several blocks were later sent to the United States for repairs using the Metalock treatment; this was later deemed to be a failure as the blocks again cracked and the Metalock treatment was seen as a waste of money. The rebuilt locomotives also underwent several minor changes. Steps were fitted to the rear of the locomotives to allow access to the roof, external door handles and step-ladders were fitted to the middle set of engine-room doors, and an automated handbrake system was fitted. The locomotives also had front ladders fitted to allow access to the cab windows, some of which were integrated into the sheet metal profile edge from the locomotive frame to the leading headstock. Both horns were relocated to the front of the cab, although the rebuilt DG 760 had three - two forward facing on the cab front, with one behind the cab. DG 760 was released from Hillside in August 1978 and was placed into service as the first of an eventual ten rebuilds to be completed between 1978 and the end of the program in 1980. While the railway unions - the Locomotive Engineers Association and the EFCA - were pleased with the cab design which took into consideration their input from the early design phases, the locomotive was not as mechanically successful as it should have been. Traction motor and engine problems still occurred, as well as occasional electrical faults. The locomotives were put into service hauling freight trains on the Main South Line and occasionally the Midland Line. Although the new cabs were designed with the Otago Central Railway in mind, very few of the re-cabbed locomotives ever worked this line. Ten further DG class engines - nine built by Vulcan Foundry and one by RS&H;  were given \\"A-grade\\" overhauls to work as trailing B-units for the rebuilt locomotives. These locomotives did not receive new cabs, and as such were not to be driven in regular service. A number of other locomotives of this type also received the updated Westinghouse 26L brake system and NZR designed push-button control stand. The class continued to suffer from reliability issues brought about by electrical and mechanical failures, and were later prohibited from running in multiple with the Mitsubishi DJ and General Motors DF locomotives, although they did sometimes run with the DJ class past this time. It was decided to start withdrawing those locomotives that had not been overhauled to provide parts for those that had, and so the first to be withdrawn, DG 765, was withdrawn on the fact it had a good engine block.  Withdrawals  By 1983, most of the original-cabbed DG class had been withdrawn, while the re-cabbed locomotives continued in service until they either suffered a mechanical failure, required major repairs or were withdrawn serviceable and placed in storage. On 28 August 1983, NZR operated a 'Farewell to the DG Class' excursion between Christchurch and Arthur's Pass on the Midland line. Hauled by recabbed DG 2007 and 'slave' unit DG 2468, the first and last DG class locomotives respectively, the excursion marked the end of the original DG class in regular service. The following month, DG 2007 failed when it threw a con rod through the engine block and was placed in storage, while DG 2468 was sold to the fledgeling Weka Pass Railway shortly after. The Dunedin machinery dealers W. Rietveld Limited were contracted by New Zealand Railways in 1983 to scrap the re-cabbed DG class locomotives, which were then stored at Dunedin. These locomotives were largely unserviceable due to mechanical failures or had been laid up with the arrival of more modern motive power. Several of these locomotives had been lifted by NZR in order to gain access to their EE 525 traction motors, which had been sold to the National Federation of Railway Societies for distribution to other groups who owned DG class locomotives. Rietveld used the former sidings at Pelichet Bay to house the withdrawn locomotives while they were stripped of all useful parts. The hulks would then be forwarded to Sims-PMI for scrapping at their Dunedin premises. The first four locomotives to be moved to Pelichet Bay were numbers 2036, 2140, 2105, and 2347. They were followed several months later by numbers 2007, 2290, 2111 and 2439. The last two, DG 2128 and DG 2330, remained at Dunedin Locomotive Depot for a time after that as Rietveld hoped to sell them to an overseas concern. This did not eventuate, and the two locomotives were towed to Pelichet Bay for stripping - the last two re-cabbed DG class to exist. Several of the unique cabs from these locomotives were not scrapped but instead removed intact by Rietvelds, who in 2001 held several at their Abbotsford reclaim site, including that of DG 2007. The cab of DG 2140 was purchased by Darryl Bond, part-owner of DG 2376. Preservation DG 770 on the Weka Pass Railway. With the phasing out of the DG class in the early 1980s, several locomotives were purchased for preservation: *DG 770/DG 2232 was saved by the Weka Pass Railway in 1983. In 1988, the railway had their name painted to the rear of the cab door in place of its TMS number, although it retained their 'International Orange' livery. In 1995, the locomotive was taken out of service due to a due to a cracked bogie. A bogie from DG 783 was fully overhauled and fitted to 770. In 1997, the 'DG' was repainted into the traditional NZR red with larch yellow nose stripes on the nose of the locomotive (as it was introduced). It was taken out of service in 2014 so its four-cylinder air compressor could be replaced but has returned to service. The locomotive, along with 791, can be seen when fire bans are in place, or when A 428 is out of service. *DG 772/DG 2255 was saved by the Diesel Traction Group in 1983. In 1988, 772 was repainted into the traditional NZR red with larch yellow nose stripes on the nose of the locomotive (as it was introduced) for the Rail 125 celebrations, during which it hauled its first excursion train with DE 511 to Springfield and return. During the early 1990s, it also hauled a few more excursion including on the Otago Central Railway and on the Midland Line. In 1995, 772 was then placed on loan to the Weka Pass Railway to cover for their DG 770 while it was out of service for repairs. It was then placed into storage between the mid to late 1990s, the locomotive was placed into storage until 2002 when it was decided to overhaul the locomotive to current mainline standards. as part of this, the locomotive's Westinghouse A7EL brake system was replaced by the newer 26L system, and it was fitted with ditch lights, a VHF radio and an events recorder to allow it to run on the main line. The overhaul was completed in 2009, just in time of the 125th anniversary of the Otago Central Railway. Before it was sent south for the anniversary, the 'DG' was leased to the Weka Pass Railway for running-in purposes. The locomotive has run several excursions since then, as well it has been occasionally been seen running on the Ferrymead Railway at the Ferrymead Heritage Park. *DG 783/DG 2376 was saved by Roger Redward for his proposed Southern Rail museum in Prebbleton. In 1988, the NZR decided to re-possess all of Rogers collection held on NZR property as he had failed to make several rent payments. The locomotive was sold in 1988 to the Weka Pass Railway, who was at the time seeking spare parts to maintain their two locomotives, and had the locomotive trucked to their Waipara yard where it was gradually stripped of most of its useful parts. In 2005, Weka Pass decided to sell the remains of the locomotive with the condition that it was removed from Waipara after purchase. The locomotive was subsequently purchased by two railfans, Darryl Bond and Evan Batchelor, who had the derelict locomotive moved to the Ferrymead Heritage Park, where it was planned to restore the locomotive. The locomotives front bogie (fitted with the cracked bogie ex-DG 770) has since been repaired, the body largely de-rusted, and parts have been acquired to begin to restore the locomotive to service in the later International Orange livery, which the locomotive never carried in service. It is planned to be fitted with the new cab from DG 2140. In late 2013, the locomotive was moved to Oamaru. *DG 791/DG 2468 was also saved by the Weka Pass Railway in 1983. In 1988, the railway had their name painted to the rear of the cab door in place of its TMS number, although it retained their 'International Orange' livery. In 1997, the 'DG' was repainted into the traditional NZR red with larch yellow nose stripes on the nose of the locomotive (as it was introduced). The locomotive, along with 770, can be seen when fire bans are in place, or when A 428 is out of service. In addition: *DG 789/DG 2445 was considered to be added to the NZR's Heritage Fleet at the time. However, the locomotive had a cracked engine block, which did not fit with their policy of operating Heritage Fleet locomotives. Due to the extent of the cracking, it was decided to be uneconomic to repair, and so the locomotive was scrapped by Sims Pacific Metal Industries in Dunedin. *DG 790/DG 2451 was also saved by Roger Redward, but it was later scrapped after the locomotive became a casualty of a protracted dispute between himself and the NZR  Footnotes   References  = Bibliography =  External links * Diesel Traction Group DG class English Electric locomotives A1A-A1A locomotives Railway locomotives introduced in 1955 ","title":"New Zealand DG and DH class locomotive"},{"id":"5736282","text":"Proctor Lake is a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reservoir along the Leon River located in Comanche County in the U.S. state of Texas.

It adjoins the West Heath part of Hampstead Heath, and was formerly surmounted by a large house which was bombed during World War II. It is chiefly grassy parkland, but it also has a formal, beautifully tended, flower garden next to a duck pond with a small humpback bridge, a separate water garden, which leads onto a larger pond, and a small free zoo, recently renovated, mostly in one bloc but with a separate pen primarily for fallow deer. A butterfly house is open at certain times in summer. There are also tennis courts, a playground and croquet lawns. A restaurant stands at the top of the park, near the site of the original house. During the summer, children's activities are organised and through June and July there is live music on the bandstand on Sunday afternoons. Unlike most of Hampstead Heath, dogs must be kept on a lead in the park.

A conservative, Sour served in the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1972 to 1992. Background Sour was a son of Arthur W. Sour (1895‚Äì1972), a native of Gretna in Jefferson Parish, and the former Adele Elizabeth Diez (1897‚Äì1977), a native of Reserve in St. John the Baptist Parish. One of Sour's sisters, Louise Pasquier, the widow of Charles F. Pasquier, Sr., was among the founders of St. Joseph Catholic Church in Shreveport. Another sister, Adele Hoisington (1917-1945), named for her mother, was a former bank employee, who died with her husband, Earl L. Hoisington (1910-1945), in an automobile accident near Willard in Huron County in northern Ohio, while the couple was on their honeymoon. Adele and Earl Hoisington are interred at Forest Park East Cemetery in Shreveport. Sour graduated c. 1941 from C.E. Byrd High School in Shreveport and thereafter served in the United States Army during World War II, in which he was wounded in action. Running for the Louisiana legislature Sour first ran for the legislature in 1964 on the Charlton Lyons gubernatorial ticket, but he was defeated by Democrats in a multi-district race. In that same election, two Republican legislative candidates, Taylor O'Hearn and Morley Hudson, were elected, but Sour and two other Republicans were defeated, Billy Guin, later the last Shreveport public utilities commissioner, and Edd Fielder Calhoun (1931‚Äì2012), an insurance agent and civic figure originally from Oklahoma City. In 1968, Sour lost again in a race for the Louisiana House; all of the Caddo Parish Republican candidates were defeated that year except Owen Adams of Greenwood, a member of the parish police jury [county commission in other states].State of Louisiana, General election returns, February 6, 1968 Sour rebounded in 1972 to win a House seat, which he then held for twenty years. =Defeating Frank Fulco= When a single-member district plan took effect with the general election held on February 1, 1972, Sour, who was committed to the gubernatorial candidacy of fellow Republican Dave Treen of Jefferson Parish, upset Democrat Frank Fulco, a prot√©g√© of the Longs and a former member of the Share the Wealth Club, to win the first of his five terms in the legislature. Sour, in District 6, defeated Fulco, 5,564 (53.2 percent) to 4,886 (46.8 percent). Shreveport political observers said that Fulco had ignored his fellow Roman Catholic Sour, already a two-time loser for the legislature, and concentrated instead on lining up commitments to become the next Speaker of the House, a position which ultimately went to Fulco's fellow Democrat, E.L. \\"Bubba\\" Henry of Jonesboro in Jackson Parish. Other Republicans elected with Sour were B.F. O'Neal, Jr., of Shreveport, Clark Gaudin of Baton Rouge, and Charles D. Lancaster, Jr., of Metairie in Jefferson Parish. In 1975, when Sour was reelected, he had only four Republican colleagues, and one of those, A.J. McNamara of Jefferson Parish, had been elected as a Democrat but switched affiliation in 1977. In the October 24, 1987, nonpartisan blanket primary, Sour had a close call. He defeated Democrat Greg Barro, later a state senator, by only seventy-seven votes. Sour received 5,744 votes (50.3 percent) to Barro's 5,667 (49.7 percent). That election provided a warning to Sour, who was a leading conservative among Republicans in northwest Louisiana. Like his Louisiana legislative colleague Louis E. \\"Woody\\" Jenkins, Sour was a member of the Council for National Policy, a conservative alternative to the Council on Foreign Relations. The CNP, which meets in Washington, was begun by either Texas billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt or Virginia direct-mail operative Richard Viguerie as a potential balance to the CFR. CNP members included the late conservative spokespersons Phyllis Schlafly and Paul Weyrich. =Melissa Flournoy unseats Sour= In the October 19, 1991, nonpartisan blanket primary, when Edwin Washington Edwards was staging his fourth-term comeback as governor, Sour was upset by the Democrat Melissa Scott Flournoy (born 1961), 9,728 (58 percent) to 7,151 (42 percent). It was a high turnout election, and Sour got more raw votes that year than in any previous election. Yet he lost with a smaller percent of the ballots cast. Flournoy did not seek a second term in the Louisiana House but instead ran for the state senate in 1995 and was defeated by the Republican Max T. Malone of Shreveport. Death Services for Sour were held on January 12, 2000, at St. Joseph Catholic Church, of which he was a member, with Father Peter Mangum officiating. Sour's widow was the former Mary Margaret \\"Maggie\\" Hodge (April 11, 1928 - December 19, 2009), the daughter of Edwin and Nelle Hodge of Hodge in Jackson Parish. Mrs. Sour graduated from Ruston High School and Louisiana Tech University in Ruston in Lincoln Parish. She was a member of Noel Memorial United Methodist Church in Shreveport. Sour had two sons, Edwin William Sour (born 1950) and wife, Dora McMath Sour, and John Michael Sour (born 1953) and wife, Terri Brooks Sour; a daughter, Margaret Stacy Sour, all of Shreveport; four sisters, Ethel Lockard (1918-2000), Louise Pasquier (c. 1922-2017), Elizabeth Ann Harris McBride (1927-2013), and Delores Jaudon; a brother, John Robert Sour, and three grandchildren. Edwin Sour was formerly married to Margaret Mary Stagg, the younger daughter of the late Judge Tom Stagg of the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, based in Shreveport.

Most notably, he served as the sixth Governor of Oregon from 1878 to 1882 and Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court from 1888 to 1889. Background Thayer was born on a farm near Lima, New York, on July 15, 1827. He received a public education before studying law in college. He was admitted to the New York State Bar in 1851. He then practiced law with his brother in Buffalo and later Tonawanda. A mining boom in Idaho Territory caught Thayer's attention in 1860, prompting him to move west. He arrived in Corvallis, Oregon, in 1861, where he joined his brother and former U.S. Representative Andrew J. Thayer, at his law firm. In 1863, he would finally move to Idaho, setting up his own law firm in Lewiston. Political career in Idaho In 1866, three years after moving to Lewiston, Thayer was elected district attorney for the Third Judicial District of Idaho Territory. From 1866 until 1867, he moved to Boise to serve for a session of the Idaho Territory House of Representatives. He moved to Portland, Oregon, shortly after leaving the legislature. Early political career in Oregon Upon returning to Oregon, Thayer established a successful law firm in the city of East Portland. At this time, he became an active member of the Democratic Party. During the 1876 Hayes-Tilden Presidential Election dispute, Thayer was a member of the legal team which challenged the certification of J. W. Watts, a Republican elector for Rutherford B. Hayes. Although successful, this challenge did not help Samuel Tilden prevail in the Electoral College. Still appreciative of his assistance in the Watts Case, the Oregon State Democratic Party nominated Thayer for governor in 1878. Thayer would win narrowly over Republican Cornelius C. Beekman, by a margin of 59 votes. Governorship Thayer's time in office is remembered as a fiscally conservative, anti-corruption administration, which sought to make the state bureaucracy more efficient. The State Board of Equalization, land law reforms, and the establishment of a state mental hospital were initiated under his leadership. He would completely eliminate the state's debt while in office. Governor Thayer often spoke out about the state's finances. Highly criticized by Thayer was the process by which the state legislature based its budget appropriations. He called for revenue projections to be based on actual revenues, not what was anticipated as the legislature had often done in the past. He also refused to fund the completion of the State Capitol Building, stating that the building was too expensive and lavish for Oregon. His lasting legacy was reforming the Supreme Court of Oregon into its present incarnation by statute. Previously, Circuit Court judges served as justices of the Supreme Court. After the statute change, Supreme Court positions were made a separate, directly elected office. Chief Justice of the Oregon Supreme Court Thayer declined to run for a second term in the 1882 gubernatorial election. Instead, he successfully ran a campaign for justice of the Supreme Court in 1884, winning a six-year term on the bench. Justice Thayer remained on the bench until 1890, the last two years of that term serving as Chief Justice. Thayer died in Portland on October 15, 1899, with interment at Lone Fir Cemetery in that city.Political Graveyard: Lone Fir Cemetery References * Oregon State Library * Klooster, Karl.

The ecoregion covers the mountains of the northern Albertine Rift, and is home to distinct Afromontane forests with high biodiversity. Geography The high montane forests cover the western portions of Rwanda and Burundi, the eastern edge of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and portions of western Uganda and Tanzania. This area occupies the parallel Albertine Rift Mountains that enclose the western branch of the East African Rift. The mountain ranges include the Lendu Plateau of Uganda (the forest is almost completely cleared from here), and the Virunga Mountains and Rwenzori Mountains of Rwanda, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. At the highest elevations of the Rwenzori and Virunga ranges (above 3000 meters), the forests transition to the Afroalpine Rwenzori-Virunga montane moorlands ecoregion, including the high peaks of Mount Stanley and Mount Karisimbi. The highest peak in Burundi, Mount Heha however is in this ecoregion. =Urban areas and settlements= Developed and settled areas in the region include: * Uganda ‚Äî the market town of Fort Portal, base for watching chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, and hub for visiting the Ruwenzori mountains to the north. * Rwanda ‚Äî Ruhengeri (near the Volcanoes National Park, and the Lake Kivu towns of Gisenyi, Kibuye (for boats trips to Napoleon Island in the lake, and Cyangugu, base for watching primates in the Nyungwe Forest. * Democratic Republic of the Congo ‚Äî the Lake Kivu cities of Goma, opposite Gisenyi and the base for visiting Virunga National Park) and Bukavu, opposite Cyangugu and near the Kahuzi-Bi√©ga National Park, which is home to mountain gorillas but endangered due to the conflict in the region (see Second Congo War). * Burundi ‚Äî the northwestern towns of Cibitoke and flood-ravaged Bubanza, and the southern city of Bururi where Bururi Natural Reserve preserves some of the Afro-montane forest. Flora and fauna The mountain rainforests of the ecoregion have a cooler climate than the Congolian lowland forests or the savanna of Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi, and therefore are home to a rich variety of Afromontane flora and especially fauna. The Albertine Rift montane forests are included on the Global 200 conservation list. The rare mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei) survives only in this ecoregion as do the L'Hoest's monkey, and a subspecies of the Hamlyn's monkey ‚àí as well as many endemic species of butterflies and birds including: Grauer's warblers, Chapin's flycatchers, and the Rwenzori turaco. The Lendu Plateau clawed frog is endemic to that landform in the ecoregion. =Conservation= Much of the forest has already been cleared for agriculture or for logging, especially in densely populated Rwanda and Burundi, but large areas of forest still remains in forest reserves and at higher altitudes in the Virunga, Itombwe, and Rwenzori Ranges. The forest clearance is ongoing and is a major threat to the ecology of the region.

Abandoned playground on Paula Leji≈Üa street. Zolit≈´de () is mainly an apartment house neighbourhood (or microdistrict) located in the western part of Riga, the capital of Latvia. Zolit≈´de is a centrally planned estate, consisting mostly of prefabricated concrete block Brutalist style homes built in late Soviet times. Construction started in 1984, and was mostly halted in 1991, when Latvia obtained its independence from the USSR. Large parts of the population, as in similar neighbourhoods of Riga, are Russian speaking. Zolit≈´de had been a mixture of council housing and co- operative flats, but many properties have been privatised since the fall of the Soviet Union. History  In 1991 Latvia gained independence from the USSR, and due to the end of financing from Moscow most of the state funded construction projects were halted. Few new homes were built until after Latvia joined the EU in 2004, but construction halted again as the late-2000s financial crisis spread to Latvia. Due to the flow of investments and affordable housing credits from private parties, Riga had experienced a construction boom. Construction of newer parts of Zolit≈´de had begun, and 15 new apartment houses were planned, with some partly completed. Construction of detached houses had been noticed close to Zolit≈´de neighbourhood as well. As with most residential neighbourhoods of Riga, Zolit≈´de's infrastructure was in a dilapidated state. According to the \\"Riga Development Plan 2006‚Äì2018\\", the development of infrastructure, services and housing had been expected. This had been seen as means to provide growth to the community of Zolit≈´de. 1990s improvements included two markets and a number of shops. The late 2000s had seen some improvements to local road quality, as well as renovation of both public schools in the area, which had become available by Riga council's use of EU funds. The late 2000s and early 2010s had also seen an expansion of supermarket chains in the area, as well as foreclosure of the only police office in the estate. On 21 November 2013 a Maxima supermarket collapsed in Zolit≈´de, killing 54 people. Geography and transportation The proximity to Riga International Airport, the seaside resorts of J≈´rmala and contemporary architecture have made Zolit≈´de attractive for young families. Some residents commute to the city centre using state-owned electric railway, with two stations in the area, or using bus and minibus services. Etymology The area's name comes from the French word solitude, that means loneliness. It is believed that servicemen of Napoleon's army were parted from his company in this area, which later gave the area its name. An alternative version is that the word \\"solitude\\" referred to the loneliness in which landowners lived here due to the extremely high prices they demanded as rent for the working class or peasants. Prior to 1984, Zolit≈´de consisted of little more than fields, scant forest, swampy grounds and a small number of cottages. Streets  :Iela means street in Latvian Lƒ´nijas are small lanes, that are named after a locale where they are. Their names are made of name of the locale, word lane and a number. In a direct translation from Latvian lƒ´nija means line Since Riga is officially divided into 6 administrative regions, each of these regions has its own unofficial division. This division is actually how the city's neighbourhoods are called by their inhabitants. So Zolit≈´de is used to call the apartment block neighbourhoods, and not the private house sector surrounding it. Zolit≈´de is divided into 2 sectors by 5 perimeter roads: *Gramzdas iela *JƒÅ≈Üa Endzelƒ´na iela *Priedaines iela *Rostokas iela *Zolit≈´des iela Apart from those listed above, there are large streets inside the neighborhood: *Aleksandra Biezi≈Üa iela *Anni≈Ümui≈æas iela *Apuzes iela *Imantas 12., 13., 15.-18. lƒ´nija *Paula Leji≈Üa iela *Ruses iela The new part, that is currently under construction will also include: *Aug≈°zemes iela *Liedes iela *Skrƒ´nes iela External links *photographs of Zolit≈´de in winter Neighbourhoods in Riga ","title":"Zolit≈´de"},{"id":"5736419","text":"T2K (\\"Tokai to Kamioka\\") is a particle physics experiment studying the oscillations of the accelerator neutrinos. The experiment is conducted in Japan by the international cooperation of about 500 physicists and engineers with over 60 research institutions from several countries from Europe, Asia and North America and it is a recognized CERN experiment (RE13). T2K was the first experiment which observed the appearance of electron neutrinos in muon neutrino beam, it also provided the world best measurement of oscillation parameter Œ∏23 and a hint of a significant matter-antimatter asymmetry in neutrino oscillations. The measurement of the neutrino-antineutrino oscillation asymmetry may bring us closer to the explanation of the existence of our matter-dominated Universe. The intense beam of muon neutrinos is produced in the J-PARC facility (Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex) in Tokai on the east coast of Japan. The beam is directed towards the Super- Kamiokande far detector located 295 km away in the city of Hida, Gifu prefecture. The properties and composition of the neutrino flux are first measured by a system of near detectors located 280 m from the beam production place at the J-PARC site, and then again in the Super-Kamiokande detector. Comparison of the content of different neutrino flavours in these two locations allows measurement of the oscillations probability on the way between near and far detectors. Super-Kamiokande is able to detect interactions of both, muon and electron neutrinos, and thus measure the disappearance of muon neutrino flux, as well as electron neutrino appearance in the beam. Physics program T2K experiment was proposed in 2003 with the following measurement goals: * The discovery of the ‚Üí oscillations, and thus the confirmation that the last unknown mixing angle Œ∏13 is not zero. * Precise measurement of the oscillation parameters Œîm and Œ∏23 via muon neutrino disappearance studies. * Search for sterile neutrino oscillations, which could be observed as a deficit of neutral current neutrino interactions. * Measurements of various interaction cross-sections for different types of neutrinos and targets in an energy range of few GeV. Since the start of the data taking in 2010, the T2K experiment succeeded to provide a list of world- class results: * The confirmation of electron neutrino appearance in the muon neutrino beam (‚Üí), which was the first time when neutrinos produced in one flavour was explicitly observed in another flavour. * The most precise measurement of the Œ∏23 parameter. * The first significant constraint on the Œ¥CP parameter, responsible for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the neutrino sector. * Limits on a sterile neutrino oscillation parameters based on studies in the near ND280 and far Super-Kamiokande detectors. * Various cross- section measurements of electron and muon neutrino and antineutrino, including inclusive charged current (CC) interactions, CC interactions without pions and with single pion in the final state, coherent pion production, neutral current interactions, etc. on different targets such as carbon, water and iron. Future upgrades of T2K is expected to provide further constrain on the Œ¥CP phase by comparing oscillations of neutrinos to those of antineutrinos, as well as more precise measurements of Œîm and Œ∏23 parameters, and cross-section measurements which will extend our understanding of neutrino interactions and thus improve theoretical models used in neutrino generators. Neutrino beam Bird's-eye view of the entire facility Superconducting magnets under construction in 2008 to veer the proton beam to the direction of Kamioka Final stage of the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam T2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino beam produced at the J-PARC facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three accelerators: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR synchrotron (Main Ring). Protons collide with a graphite target, producing mesons, mainly pions and kaons, which are then focused by a set of three magnetic horns and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into and , forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into and , forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining hadrons and charged leptons are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector. =Off-axis beam= T2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis neutrino beam was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 degrees away from the Super-Kamiokande far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5¬∞ to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295 km is maximal for around 600 MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment. Near detectors The near detector complex is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors: * INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam, * ND280 detector located 2.5¬∞ away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector. * Wagasci-BabyMIND (WAter Grid SCIntillator Detector - prototype Magnetized Iron Neutrino Detector) is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5¬∞ off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy. =Signal readout= Except for the Time Projection Chambers in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is plastic scintillator. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by wavelength-shifting fibres and detected by Hamamatsu Multi-pixel photon counters located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles. =INGRID detector= The main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations. =ND280 detector= ND280 under construction. Exploded view of the ND280 detector. The ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux. ND280 is composed of the set of inner sub- detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket. The basket is surrounded by the electromagnetic calorimeter and a magnet recycled from the UA1 experiment producing 0.2 T uniform horizontal field and instrumented with scintillator planes constituting the Side Muon Range Detector. Pi-Zero detector Pi-Zero detector scheme. The Pi-Zero () Detector (P0D) contains 40 plastic scintillator module planes, which in the central part are interleaved with 2.8 cm thick bags fillable of water and thick brass sheets, and in two peripheral regions scintillator modules are sandwiched with lead sheets. By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande. The size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m √ó 2.2 m √ó 2.4 m (X√óY√óZ) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively. The main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral pions production in neutral current neutrino interactions on water: : + N ‚Üí + N‚Äô + This reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from decay can be mis- reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement. Time projection chambers Three time projection chambers (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout MicroMegas modules at both sides parallel to the cathode. TPCs are filled with argon-based drift gas under atmospheric pressure. Charged particles crossing TPC ionise the gas along their track. The ionisation electrons drift from the cathode to the sides of the TPC, where they are detected by the MicroMegas providing a 3D image of a path of the traversing charged particle. Y and Z coordinates are based on the position of the detected ionisation electrons on the MicroMegas modules, and X coordinate is based on the electrons drift time. In the magnetic field, the curvature of this path allows to determine charge and momentum of the particle, and the amount of the ionisation electrons per unit distance is used to identify particles based on the Bethe-Bloch formula. Fine-grained detectors Two fine-grained detectors (FGDs) are placed after the first and second TPCs. Together the FGDs and TPCs make up the tracker of ND280. The FGDs provide the active target mass for the neutrino interactions and are able to measure the short tracks of proton recoil. The first FGD is composed of scintillator layers only, while the second FGD is composed of alternating layers of scintillator and water. The second FGD is partially composed of water because the detector at Super-Kamiokande is water- based. Cross sections on carbon and on the water can be determined from a comparison of neutrino interactions in the two FGDs. Electromagnetic Calorimeter The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL) surrounds the inner detectors (P0D, TPCs, FGDs) and consists of scintillator layers sandwiched with lead absorber sheets. Its role is to detect neutral particles, especially photons, and measure their energy and direction, as well as to detect charged particles providing additional information relevant for their identification. Side Muon Range Detector The Side Muon Range Detector (SMRD) consists of scintillator modules which are inserted into the gaps in the magnet. The SMRD records muons escaping the inner parts of the detector at large angles with respect to the beam direction. It can also act as a trigger for cosmic rays. Finally, it can help identify beam interactions in the surrounding walls and in the magnet itself. =WAGASCI-Baby MIND= WAGASCI-Baby MIND is a new detector located next to the INGRID and ND280 detectors, devoted to neutrino interaction studies. It provided the first neutrino beam data using full detector setup during the 2019/2020 winter run. The WAGASCI-Baby MIND consists of several sub-detectors: * Two new water-scintillator detectors (WAGASCI, WAter-Grid-SCIntillator-Detector) that act as the main water targets and particle trackers. The 3D grid-like structure of scintillator bars creates hollow cavities filled with water (80% H2O + 20% CH). The acceptance is approximately constant in all directions. * One Proton Module, the same as in the INGRID detector, made of plain plastic scintillator (CH) bars, that acts as the main CH target and particle tracker. * Two WallMRD (Wall Muon Range Detector) that are non-magnetized muon spectrometers to detect side going muons. They are made of passive iron planes intertwined with active scintillator planes. * One Baby MIND (prototype Magnetized Iron Neutrino Detector) that is a magnetized muon spectrometer to detect forward-going muons. Baby MIND sports an original configuration of scintillation modules intertwined with magnetized ferrite modules like a sandwich. The modules can be rearranged easily to adapt the magnetic field to the particular needs of the experiment. The magnetic field is created only inside the ferrite so it is very power efficient compared to magnets that have to magnetize empty spaces around them like the ND280 one. However, the magnetic field is not homogeneous over the travel volume of the muons, and this poses a still open challenge for momentum reconstruction. All the active material in the detectors is made up of plastic scintillator and is read as explained in section Signal readout. The main goal of the WAGASCI-Baby MIND detector is a reduction of the systematic error in the T2K oscillation analysis, which will be achieved thanks to its complementarity with respect to the ND280 detector: * Different target material between ND280 (80% CH + 20% H2O) and SK (pure H2O) forces us to rely on cross-section models to disentangle the H2O cross-section estimate from the CH one. The fraction of water in WAGASCI water-scintillator modules is 80% enabling a measurement of the charged-current neutrino cross-section ratio between water (H2O) and plastic (CH) with 3% accuracy. * The new detector will provide measurements of various charged-current neutrino interaction channels with high precision, lower momentum threshold and full angular acceptance. These will constrain flux and cross-section models uncertainties for the particles produced at high angles. These assets will also facilitate detection of low momentum hadrons produced in the interaction of the neutrino with bounded states of 2 nucleons or through reinteractions inside the target nucleus of particles produced by the neutrino, and thus better modelling of such interactions in the far detector. * Location at the same distance of 280 meters from the graphite target as ND280 and INGRID detectors, but at a different off-axis angle of 1.5 degrees, causes that the energy spectrum of the neutrino beam is peaked around different energies for each of the off-axis angles corresponding to the detectors. Combination of measurements from these detectors will provide an improved constraint on the neutrino cross-sections as a function of their energy. Super-Kamiokande Detection of electrons and muons in the Super-Kamiokande detector. Super- Kamiokande detector is located 1000 m underground in the Mozumi Mine, under Mount Ikeno in the Kamioka area of Hida city. It is a stainless steel cylindrical tank of about 40 m height and diameter, filled with 50,000 tons of water and instrumented with around 13,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMT). It detects a cone of Cherenkov light emitted by charged particles moving in water faster than light in this medium. Its goal is to measure muons and electrons produced in charged current quasielastic interactions (CCQE) of and , respectively. Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic showers, observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged lepton produced in the CCQE interaction. In this way, and spectra are determined, leading to the measurement of the oscillation parameters relevant for muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance. History T2K is a successor of the KEK to Kamioka (K2K) experiment, which ran from 1999 till 2004. In the K2K experiment, an accelerator beam of muon neutrinos was produced at KEK facility in Tsukuba (Japan) and sent towards the Super-Kamiokande detector, located 250 km away. The K2K experiment results confirmed at the confidence level of 99.9985% (4.3 œÉ) the disappearance of the muon neutrinos and were consistent with the previous measurements of oscillation parameters measured by the Super-Kamiokande detector for atmospheric neutrinos. The construction of the neutrino beamline started in 2004 and it was successfully commissioned in 2009. Construction of the entire INGRID detector and majority of the ND280 detector (without barrel part of the electromagnetic calorimeter) was completed in 2009. The missing part of the calorimeter was installed in the fall of 2010. T2K far detector is the large Super-Kamiokande detector, which has been running since 1996 and studying proton lifetime and oscillations of atmospheric, solar and accelerator neutrinos. T2K experiment started to take neutrino data for a physics analysis in January 2010, initially with an incomplete ND280 detector, and starting from November 2010 with the full setup. The data taking was interrupted for one year by the Great Tohoku Earthquake in March 2011. The proton beam power, and thus the neutrino beam intensity, was constantly growing, reaching by February 2020 the power of 515 kW and a total number of accumulated protons on target of 3.64√ó1021 protons with 55% of data in neutrino-mode and 45% in antineutrino-mode. In April 2020, T2K collaboration published results strongly constraining the Œ¥CP phase. The results reject at 95% confidence the hypothesis of no CP violation (including the possibility of Œ¥CP equal to œÄ). The results also reject at the 3œÉ (99.7%) significance level almost half of the possible values of this parameter and give a strong hint that CP violation may be large in the neutrino sector.https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-52297058 Future plans The T2K experiment is expected to operate in the current form until the end of 2020. In 2021 a major upgrade of the neutrino beamline and the ND280 near detector will be performed. From 2022 till 2026 neutrino data will be taken within the second phase of the T2K experiment (T2K-II). In 2025, the successor of the T2K experiment will be launched, the Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) experiment, with the new, 250,000-ton water Cherenkov far detector - the Hyper-Kamiokande detector. The building of an additional Intermediate Water Cherenkov detector at a distance of around 2 km is also considered for the HK experiment. =T2K-II= The phase II of the T2K experiment is expected to start in 2022 and last until 2025 or 2026 following by the commencement of the HK experiment. The physics goals of T2K-II are a measurement of the oscillation parameters Œ∏23 and Œîm with a precision of 1.7¬∞ and 1%, respectively, as well as a confirmation at the level of 3 œÉ or more of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the neutrino sector in a wide range of possible true values of Œ¥CP  the parameter responsible for the CP (matter-antimatter) asymmetry. Achievement of these goals requires reduction of the statistical and systematic errors, and thus a significant upgrade of the beamline and the ND280 detector, as well as improvements in the software and analysis methods. Beam upgrade The beam upgrade plan requires one year long shut down of the J-PARC Main Ring accelerator in 2021, followed by a constant gradual increase of the proton beam power until the start of the HK experiment. The beam power should reach 750 kW in 2022 and then grow to 1.3 MW by 2029. In February 2020, the proton beam power reached 515 kW with 2.7x1014 protons per pulse and with 2.48 seconds between pulses (so-called repetition cycle). To reach 750 kW, the repetition cycle will be reduced to 1.32 s with 2.0x1014 protons per pulse, while for 1.3 MW the repetition cycle has to be further decreased to 1.16 s and the number of protons per pulse has to increase to 3.2x1014. In addition to increasing the primary proton beam power, the current in the horns focusing secondary particles (pions, kaons, etc.) with a chosen electric charge will also be increased from 250 kA to 320 kA. This will increase the amount of right-sign neutrinos (neutrinos in the neutrino mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by 10%, and reduce the amount of wrong-sign neutrinos (anti-neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by around 5-10%. Reduction of the repetition cycle will require a series of hardware upgrades, including a major upgrade of the Main Ring power supplies and a minor upgrade of the focusing horn power supplies, all of which will be installed during the long shutdown in 2021. Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the cooling capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the graphite target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water. ND280 Upgrade Scheme of the inner part of the ND280 detector after planned upgrade. The current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going leptons (muons and electrons), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting neutrino, as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles (pions, kaons, nucleons) were lost, may be mis- reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a bias in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and nuclear effects. Three main measures need to be taken to address these issues: * The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered. * High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination between backward from forward going tracks using timing information. * Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterised with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions. The Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub- detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below. =SuperFGD= The SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1 cm3 scintillating polystyrene cubes. The cubes are woven with a series of optical fibres designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the antineutrino energy. =HATPC= The High Angle Time Projection Chambers (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the MicroMegas modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of resistive material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs. =TOF= The six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of plastic scintillator layers designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the time of flight for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors. =Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics= The impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples. Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi- inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions. =Hyper-Kamiokande experiment= The successor of the T2K experiment, the Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment. The HK experiment is expected to start operation around the year 2027. Hyper- Kamiokande detector The Hyper-Kamiokande detector will be a water Cherenkov detector, 5 times larger (258 kton of water) than the Super- Kamiokande detector. It will be a cylinder of 74 meters diameter and 60 meter height with 40000 photomultiplier tubes of 50 cm diameter and 6700 photomultiplier tubes of 20 cm diameter. It will be located 8 km south from the Super-Kamiokande detector in the Tochibora mine, 650 meters under the peak of Nijuugo mountain, at the same off-axis angle (2.5¬∞) to the neutrino beam centre and in the same distance (295 km) from the beam production place at J-PARC. The start of the HK detector construction is planned for 2020 and the start of data collection is expected in 2027. Intermediate Water Cherenkov The Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) will be located at a distance of 0.7‚Äì2 km from the neutrino production place. It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20 cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1¬∞ to 4¬∞, and thus for different energy spectra. Combining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for sterile oscillation pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of electron neutrino interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle. It is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.

Common verbs in English that can function as light verbs are do, give, have, make, and take. Other names for light verb include delexical verb,The Collins Cobuild English Grammar, for instance, uses the term delexical verb instead of light verb. vector verb, explicator verb, thin verb, empty verb and semantically weak verb (a semantically weak verb is not to be confused with a weak verb of the Germanic weak inflection, however). While light verbs are similar to auxiliary verbs regarding their contribution of meaning to the clauses in which they appear, light verbs fail the diagnostics that identify auxiliary verbs and are therefore distinct from auxiliaries. Light verb constructionsA light verb construction is a multiword expression that combines a light verb with another word or phrase, such as a noun phrase or preposition. See S. Stevenson et al. (2004). challenge theories of compositionality because the words that form such constructions do not together qualify as constituents although the word combinations qualify as catenae. Examples Most light verb constructions in English include a noun and are sometimes called stretched verbs. Some light verb constructions also include a preposition, e.g. ::They _did_ the review of my paper first. ::Sam _did_ the cleaning yesterday. ::Who _got_ such intense criticism? ::Susan is _getting_ much support from her family. ::I am going to _have_ a nice nap. ::She _had_ a smoke. ::We _had_ a slow, boring conversation. ::Are you _giving_ a presentation at the conference? ::They _gave_ the kids a hard time. ::Who will _give_ you a hug? ::Who _made_ such a severe mistake? ::I _made_ the first request. ::Sam has _taken_ a shower. ::Why is Larry _taking_ a nap? ::We should _take_ a break soon. ::Have you _taken_ advantage of that opportunity. ::I haven't _taken_ that into consideration. The light verbs are underlined, and the words in bold together constitute the light verb constructions. Each of these constructions is the (primary part of the) main predicate of the sentence. Note that the determiner a is usually NOT part of the light verb construction. We know that it is not part of the light verb construction because it is variable, e.g. I took a long/the first/two/the best nap. The light verb contributes little content to its sentence; the main meaning resides with the noun in bold. Alternative constructions with full verbs Many light verb constructions are closely similar in meaning to a corresponding full verb, e.g. ::a. Sam did a revision of his paper. ‚Äì Light verb construction ::b. Sam revised his paper. -Full verb ::a. Larry wants to have a smoke. ‚Äì Light verb construction ::b. Larry wants to smoke. ‚Äì Full verb ::a. Jim made an important claim that.... ‚Äì Light verb construction ::b. Jim claimed that... ‚Äì Full verb ::a. Mary is taking a nap. ‚Äì Light verb construction ::b. Mary is napping. ‚Äì Full verb Alternative formulations such as these lead to the insight that light verb constructions are predicates just like the corresponding full verb alternatives. There can be, however, nuanced differences in meaning across these alternative formulations. The light verb constructions produce possibilities for modification that are less available with the corresponding full verb alternatives. Contrasted with auxiliary verbs and full verbs Many verbs that serve as light verbs can also serve as auxiliary verbs and/or full verbs depending on the context in which they appear. Light verbs are similar to auxiliary verbs insofar as they contribute mainly functional content (as opposed to semantic content) to the clauses in which they appear. Light verbs, however, are not auxiliary verbs, nor are they full verbs. Light verbs differ from auxiliary verbs in English insofar as they do not pass the syntactic tests that identify auxiliary verbs. The following examples illustrate that light verbs fail the inversion and negation diagnostics that identify auxiliary verbs: ::a. He did call Susan yesterday. ::b. Did he call Susan yesterday? ‚Äì The auxiliary did inverts with the subject. ::c. He did not call Susan yesterday. ‚Äì The auxiliary did can take not as a postdependent. ::a. He did the review of my paper yesterday. ::b. *Did he the review of my paper yesterday? ‚Äì The light verb did cannot invert with the subject. ::c. *He did not the review of my paper yesterday. ‚Äì The light verb did cannot take not as a postdependent. ::a. He has opened the window. ::b. Has he opened the window? ‚Äì The auxiliary has inverts with the subject. ::c. He has not opened the window. ‚Äì The auxiliary has takes not as a postdependent. ::a. She had a smoke. ::b. *Had she a smoke? ‚Äì The light verb had cannot invert with the subject. ::c. *She had not a smoke. ‚Äì The light verb had cannot take not as a postdependent. Light verbs differ from full verbs in that light verbs lack the semantic content that full verbs have. Full verbs are the core of a predicate, whereas light verbs form a predicate with another expression (often a noun) with full semantic content. This distinction is more difficult to illustrate, but it can be seen in the following examples involving reflexive pronouns: ::a. Jim1 took a picture of himself1. ‚Äì The light verb took requires the reflexive pronoun to appear. ::b. *Jim1 took a picture of him1. ‚Äì The light verb took prohibits the simple pronoun from appearing. ::a. Jim1 took a picture of himself1 to school. ‚Äì The full verb took allows the reflexive pronoun to appear. ::b. Jim1 took a picture of him1 to school. ‚Äì The full verb took allows the simple pronoun to appear. ::a. Sally1 gave a description of herself1. ‚Äì The light verb gave requires the reflexive pronoun to appear. ::b. *Sally1 gave a description of her1. ‚Äì The light verb gave prohibits the simple pronoun from appearing. ::a. Sally1 gave me a description of herself1. ‚Äì The full verb gave allows the reflexive pronoun to appear ::b. Sally1 gave me a description of her1. ‚Äì The full verb gave allows the simple pronoun to appear. The indices indicate coreference, i.e. the two coindexed words denote the same person. The reflexive pronoun must appear with the light verb, whereas the full verb allows the simple pronoun to appear as well. This distinction has to do with the extent of the predicate. The main predicate reaches down into the noun phrase when the light verb appears, whereas it excludes the noun phrase when the full verb is present. Compositionality in terms of catenae Light-verb constructions present the same difficulty associated with idiosyncratic expressions of every sort: the meaning is not compositional in a straightforward way. This fact is evident in the examples above, inasmuch as the words that constitute a light- verb construction often do not qualify as a constituent in any sense. These constructions do, however, form catenae (= chains).Concerning the status of constructions as catenae, see Osborne and Gro√ü (2012). This fact is illustrated with the following dependency grammar trees: ::Light verb trees 1 The words of each light-verb construction form a catena. In this regard, the words in green qualify as the main predicate of the clause each time. If an auxiliary verb is present (as in trees b and d), it is included in the main predicate because like the light verb, it contributes functional meaning only. In other languages Examples in other languages include the Yiddish geb in geb a helf (literally give a help, \\"help\\"); the French faire in faire semblant (lit. make seeming, \\"pretend\\"); the Hindi nikal paRA (lit. leave fall, \\"start to leave\\"); and the b«é construction in Chinese. See Hornstein et al. (2005:99f.). Light verbs are extremely common in modern Indo-Iranian languages, Japanese, Basque and other languages in which verb compounding is a primary mechanism for marking aspectual distinctions. Light verbs are also equivalent to inherent complement verbs in many Kwa languages, e.g. jo in jo foi \\"run\\" (Ga), tu in tu fo \\"advise\\" (Akan). = Australian Languages = A significant proportion of Australian Aboriginal languages have verbal systems involving light verbs. Many Australian inflecting-verb classes are closed classes and very few in membership. Thus, in order to express more intricate assertions, matrix verbs are combined with coverbal elements such as preverbs to form complex verbal predicates. In such instances, the matrix verb typically still bears all of the tense‚Äìaspect‚Äìmood inflection but contributes little to the sentence semantically (i.e. is more of a function word); as noted above, however, they are still distinct from traditional auxiliary verbs.  Bardi  One such Australian language with prevalent uses of light verbs is Bardi, a Nyulnyulan language spoken in the north of Australia. Although its inflecting-verb class is comparatively large with respect to some other Australian languages (~230 members), a number of these appear often as light verbs. Comprising the most frequent of these light verbs are the verb roots -ju- 'do/say' and -ma- 'put.' En example of the latter in use is: In a case such as the above, liyan 'heart' is the preverb containing most of the semantic content. Likewise with goo 'hit' in the following example:  Jingulu  Typically, in languages with coverb+light-verb predicates, these words must be directly adjacent; however, in extremely rare cases in languages such as Jingulu, there can be intervening elements between the semantically- rich preverb and the inflected matrix verb. See the following example where the subject ngaya appears between the preverb ambaya 'speak' and the inflected main verb nu 'do.' This rare but significant phenomenon provides evidence that, even in more heavily agglutinating languages like Jingulu wherein the main verb may not be morphologically independent from the preverb, these are in fact light verbs and not inflectional affixes. Diachronic considerations Light verbs are interesting to linguists from a variety of perspectives, including those of diachronic linguistics and computational linguistics. From the diachronic perspective, the light verb is said to have evolved from the \\"heavy\\" verb through semantic bleaching, a process in which the verb loses some or all of its original semantics. In this sense, the light verb is often viewed as part of a cline: :verb (heavy) ‚Üí light verb ‚Üí auxiliary verb ‚Üí clitic ‚Üí affix ‚Üí conjugation However, the light verb ‚Üí auxiliary path is disputed, since a) light verbs can remain stable for very long periods (cf. Butt and Lahiri (2013)https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Diachronic-Pertinacity-of-Light- Verbs-Butt-Lahiri/127d0f3598625f4bd32d24b0f63f12cd79aacf84, and b) since both light verbs and auxiliaries can exist in the same languages, descended from the same full lexical verb, but with different meanings. In computational linguistics, a serious challenge is that of identifying light verb constructions, which require marking light verbs.

It was released on June 27, 2006, on OCD International in the United States. The album revives the character of Dr. Octagon, who was killed off on Thornton's 1999 release First Come, First Served. Production for the album began in 2002 under the title The Resurrection of Dr. Octagon with producer Fanatik J. Thornton signed a contract with CMH Records to release the album. Following a contractual dispute, Fanatik J was released from the project. The album's production was completed by the One-Watt Sun production team based upon three completed vocal recordings and older unfinished recordings. Thornton had little involvement with the production of the album. He later stated that he liked the completed product, but that it hurt his musical reputation. The Return of Dr. Octagon initially received great reviews. The first single Aliens garnered the coveted Guardian Single of the Week in the U.K., and also was given a place among Wire Magazines top Hip Hop records of the year, but what followed were much more polarized reviews. The album did not chart. Much praise and criticism centered on the production, with HipHop Dx stating \\"This is Kool Keith's best album in years--arguably even better than his classic Octagonecologyst,\\" and Newsweek stating that \\"If this album surpasses its predecessor, full credit goes to the Berlin production trio One Watt Sun, who come off sounding like a cross between Parliament-Funkadelic and Kraftwerk.\\" Yet others felt that the production fit neither Thornton's lyrical style nor the Dr. Octagon character. Origins and recording Keith Thornton, best known by the stage name Kool Keith, released the album Dr. Octagonecologyst in 1996, under the name Dr. Octagon, produced by Dan \\"The Automator\\" Nakamura. Thornton later expressed some frustration with the \\"Dr. Octagon\\" nickname, saying, \\"Octagon wasn't my life...I've done a lot of things that were totally around different things other than Octagon. Are some people just afraid to venture off into my life and see that I do other things which are great? I think people stuck me with something.\\" In 1999, Thornton released the album First Come, First Served, which featured a track in which the newly introduced character Dr. Dooom murdered Dr. Octagon. Thornton had intended to move away from the Dr. Octagon character, but later decided to record another album under the Octagon name. In 2002, Thornton announced The Resurrection of Dr. Octagon, a proposed sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst that would reintroduce the character. Los Angeles- based producer Fanatik J was chosen to create the music for the album. Thornton himself took part in the production of early material for the project, playing bass, guitar, and keyboards on many of the tracks. Thornton signed a contract with CMH Records to release the album. On July 23, 2002, Rolling Stone reported that a new Dr. Octagon album would be released in February 2003. Explaining his choice of label, Thornton said, \\"I chose to go with somebody that [would] take this as a creative project, not a marketing project. Major labels tend to let inexperienced people oversee your projects. Your innovation goes down because they have [too much] input. You don't see anybody going into the studio to tell James Brown what to do. Even though he can adapt to certain things, nobody tells him how to sing. That's the way I feel about myself.\\" Preceding the production of the album, Thornton told Rolling Stone that \\"this album is fine-tuned with instruments, deeper and more spaced out. The last one was cool, but I didn't like it because it wasn't funky. When I don't work on a project, it's not that funky. When I do work on it, it's funky, and it has soul to it...I'm proud of my funky sounds right now.\\" Fanatik J was not named as the album's producer. Thornton stated that with Dr. Octagonecologyst, Thornton had given Nakamura his first successful album as a producer, and that with The Return of Dr. Octagon, he would \\"make another person and create another star.\\" As production on the album was underway, Thornton had a falling out with Fanatik J over contract rights. Thornton referred to Fanatik J as \\"greedy\\" and stated that \\"He went out of his level of producer's ranking. Maybe he thought he was an overnight Quincy Jones, that he was the Automator.\\" Fanatik J later engaged in a legal battle with CMH over contractual terms that did not give him input on remixes. Following Fanatik J's disputes with the label, CMH contacted San Francisco- based producer John Lindland and Melbourne-based producers Simon Walbrook and Ben Green to produce material for the album. Lindland, Walbrook and Green began creating material for the album under the billing of One-Watt Sun. Thornton was briefly involved with the project, recording vocals for three tracks: \\"Trees,\\" \\"Ants,\\" and \\"Aliens,\\" based upon rough sonic and lyrical themes created by the production team. After Thornton had a falling out with the label over contractual terms, he gave the label recordings he had made two years previously, consisting of Thornton rapping and goofing off, in order to complete his contract. The album was completed without his involvement. Music =Production= One-Watt Sun met at various points in Berlin, Prague, Melbourne, and Byron Bay to work on the album's music tracks with Pro Tools software. The music and structure of the vocal recordings were completed the following year. None of Fanatik J's production work appeared on the final album. According to Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown, One-Watt Sun's production incorporates elements of \\"pop, dirty blues, rock, and R&B;\\". Some critics felt that the album's production was inferior to that of Dr. Octagonecologyst. KutMasta Kurt, a frequent collaborator with Thornton, disliked the album's production, stating \\"The Dr. Octagon character was rapping over sounds that were dark and sinister, but they turned the album into this dancey electro- pop. A lot of it had this Euro-dance feel, and I was like, 'Wait a second, not only did they change the music, they changed it into something [to which] I couldn't relate.'\\" KutMasta Kurt also recounts a conversation with Thornton on a European flight in December 2006, in which Thornton stated that The Return of Dr. Octagon does not sound like a Dr. Octagon album. Thornton himself said that he liked the album's production, but that the album hurt his reputation as a musician. According to Thornton, \\"I'm not mad. But I don't repeat words when I rap. They cooked up some electronic stuff, you know, WORD! WORD! WORD! making me sound like triple people. It's interesting.\\" =Storyline and lyrical themes= Although Thornton's vocals were largely edited without his involvement, a background story for the album was created by the label and published in a series of eight segments, each revealing a new chapter and featuring an exclusive remix by the likes of Prefuse 73, Aesop Rock, Kid Loco, Spank Rock and others. The remixers appear in the story as \\"interpreters\\" hired to decipher the meaning of each remixed song, reportedly sent in a package to the offices of OCD. The story begins three weeks after OCD received the package. Still unable to decode its meaning, the record company receives a phone call from an unknown source, tracked to Los Angeles, New York, Australia and Saturn. The caller claims to have received the same package five years ago and that it had brought destruction and chaos upon his society, and warns that they are coming after Octagon. OCD then receives a message from a hacker identifying himself as Cassettes Won't Listen, who states that eight years ago, himself and five friends were abducted by aliens, tortured, cloned, and kept in isolation. The last survivor was killed by one of the clones, whom Cassettes Won't Listen then went underground to fight. Cassettes Won't Listen reveals that Dr. Octagon was imprisoned in the cell next to him, as \\"a prime candidate to study all things regarding grills, pills and bills\\". Octagon was cloned: his clones have been sent out to destroy the universe. Rob Sonic learns that the clones were created by a giant gorilla driving a pickup truck, who intends to steal the package to prevent the world from hearing Octagon's message, allowing him to destroy the Earth. The story concludes with the remixers and OCD's staff escaping with the package on Kid Loco's plane. An intern briefly sees a figure standing on OCD's rooftop, wearing a labcoat with a stethoscope around his neck, holding the head of \\"some black hairy creature\\" in his hand. PopMatters writer Michael Frauenhofer wrote that \\"Dr. Octagon‚Äôs lyrics on this album typically appear to be unconnected, but over the course of each track can be seen building around a general theme, be it conservation, societal conformity, American militarism, or, yes, his characteristic fascination with sex.\\" According to Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown, Dr. Octagon has matured and his focus has broadened since Dr. Octagonecologyst, in which the character focused largely on sex. Brown writes that Octagon is now \\"truly worried about the state of humankind, both physically and musically; in short, someone who could truly save the world\\". Brown also states that while the album focuses on science fiction and abstract themes, \\"there are also as many, if not more, songs about man's own behavior toward himself and his environment.\\" Frauenhofer referred to \\"Trees\\" as \\"a definite highlight\\" in which \\"the doctor drops his trademark off-kilter raps on, surprisingly, environmentalism.\\" Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan wrote that the song \\"Ants\\" compares \\"the humans infesting Earth to ants in a colony, enthused and disgusted at once\\". Frauenhofer, describing the song \\"Eat It,\\" wrote that Princess Superstar \\"constantly references sex\\" while Dr. Octagon \\"confusingly interjects with his complaints about how women only want to go out and talk and eat\\", but Frauenhofer states that the sexual content of the album's lyrics is not as explicit as previous Thornton albums, such as Sex Style. Dallas Observer writer Geoff Johnston described the song as being \\"as profane as one would hope for.\\" =Singles and music videos= \\"Aliens\\" was released as the first single from the album. A remix of \\"Aliens\\" by British drum and bass producer Sub Focus was chosen as compilation of the month in the May 2006 issue of Mixmag. Music videos were produced for the singles \\"Aliens\\" and \\"Trees\\", in which Thornton did not appear. The music video for \\"Trees\\" was produced as a public service announcement for MTV's \\"Break the Addiction\\" campaign, as well as a promo video for the album. Release OCD International was created as an imprint of CMH to release the material. On October 12, 2004, a bootleg consisting of material produced by Chilly Chill from the Lench Mob was released under the title Dr. Octagon Part 2 by Real Talk Records. It was discontinued by court order. On June 27, 2006, OCD International released One-Watt Sun's material under the title The Return of Dr. Octagon in the United States on compact disc, although the completed work more closely resembled a remix album than what Thornton had originally intended. In the United Kingdom, the CMH-completed album was released by Buttercuts Records on compact disc and vinyl. CMH distributor World's Fair promoted The Return of Dr. Octagon as the official sequel to Dr. Octagonecologyst, and claimed that Thornton would tour in support of the album. Early news stories reported by outlets such as The Guardian, MTV2, MySpace, Remix Magazine, and The Washington Post endorsed the label's claims. Internet rumors began to spread that the album had been released without Thornton's authorization via what turned out to be an unsubstantiated piece of journalism by David Downs. In August, Thornton performed under the Dr. Octagon billing, but did not promote the album. According to Thornton, \\"This ain't the record I did. It was totally new music. I was really pissed off about people wanting me to go out and tour and do these songs.\\" OCD originally intended to ship 50,000 units during the first year, but halted the plan due to the remarkably high volume of downloads received by the online remixes. In September, Thornton stated that he had not received royalties from CMH Records. According to Thornton, \\"I hope they're sending them. You have another interview if they don't send me a check. Honestly, with the next single, I want them to leave me a sparkling diamond.\\"  Reception  Metacritic, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the album a score of 61%, denoting generally favorable reviews. The album did not chart. The earliest reviews of the album, published by the LA Weekly and Newsweek, were positive. Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard wrote that \\"Octagon's verses often feel unfocused and random, but when he bears down he can be mesmerizing, channeling his quick-tongued rhymes with streetwise brassiness and cosmic vibrations.\\" Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown wrote that the album \\"doesn't always make a lot of sense, but that's the beauty of it. It's a kind of concept album that concentrates more on the actual overall sound than the concepts. Its elements are all on the very edge of control, which is both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time; if it works, it could bring us to where we've never been, protect us from what may be, but if it fails, it could kill us all.\\" Hip Hop DX reviewer B. Love wrote, \\"This is Kool Keith's best album in years‚Äîarguably even better than his classic Octagonecologyst‚Äîand marks a fine return to form for one of rap music's most distinctive and original talents.\\" Other reviews were mixed. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan wrote that \\"Keith himself is responsible for all of the album's good moments. Even when he's in unhinged- rant mode, Keith's imagery often remains lucid. And so the album's best song is \\"Ants,\\" where he comes off frantic but omnipotent...It's dense and fascinating stuff, a tantalizing glimpse of what might've happened if Keith hadn't treated the reemergence of his most popular persona like an easy payday.\\" PopMatters writer Michael Frauenhofer wrote that \\"The Return of Dr. Octagon is still better than anything Kool Keith's done in a little while, but apart from its best tracks, it's not close to the level of his finest work of the past, and it doesn't really build much on the legend of Dr. Octagon, which still rests most firmly on the good doctor's debut.\\" Negative reviews came from Billboard writer Ron Hart and Michael Pollock of Prefix magazine. Hart wrote that \\"Kool Keith has dropped nothing but disappointment and at an alarmingly steady rate.\\" Pollock wrote that \\"Despite all the stupid records he's put out before, The Return of Dr. Octagon is the first one that plunges wholly into self-parody. He's now a fully realized clown, a prop, a joke and, most disappointingly, a sub-par rapper whose forced ideas and personality obstacles have devolved into flimsy, uninspired character sketches.\\" Dan the Automator criticized the release, stating \\"That wasn't a Dr. Octagon record. Dr. Octagon is me, Kool Keith, and Q-Bert. The label didn't have the legal right to use the name, but I didn't want to get involved in a legal battle...Keith's my man, just trying to make a little bit of money.\\" KutMasta Kurt stated that Thornton was reluctant to perform songs from the album, because the lyrics did not fit the music. John Lindland, who coproduced the final album under the name One-Watt Sun, stated in defense of the album, \\"People say it's a fake. We don't have that feeling. We think that those are great tracks. It wasn't about remixing anything. They were our ideas, and Keith went on grooves that we sent to LA.\\" In response to Fanatik J's criticism of the album, One Watt Sun referred to him as being disgruntled as a result of the label discarding his music. According to Lindland, \\"If we were him, we'd have [a] beef too\\". Dr. Dooom 2, Thornton's 2008 follow-up to First Come, First Served, was produced in response to The Return of Dr. Octagon. According to Thornton, \\"I'm one of those artists that people take my music without my consent. People love to snatch my music and do things on their own. You got people that put me on beats I never rapped on. I just feel that it's a bad thing.\\" Track listing Personnel * Keith Matthew Thornton ‚Äì lyrics, vocals * Concetta Kirschner ‚Äì lyrics & vocals (track 14) * April McClellan ‚Äì vocals (track 5) * Dexter Fabay ‚Äì scratches (track 4) * Simon Walbrook ‚Äì producer, mixing * Ben Green ‚Äì producer (tracks: 1-10, 13-15), mixing * John Lindland ‚Äì songwriting * Mike Letho ‚Äì mixing * Nilesh \\"Nilz\\" Patel ‚Äì mastering * Tom√°≈° Soch≈Ørek ‚Äì additional mixing * Fran√ßois T√©taz ‚Äì additional mixing * Argee Geronca ‚Äì artwork design * Brent Wadden ‚Äì artwork design * Mario Campos ‚Äì artwork design * Michael Tullberg ‚Äì photography References External links * Official website * 2006 albums Kool Keith albums ","title":"The Return of Dr. Octagon"},{"id":"5736475","text":"Padaung is a river village in Homalin Township in Hkamti District in the Sagaing Region of northwestern Myanmar.

India In India, a census town is one which is not statutorily notified and administered as a town, but nevertheless whose population has attained urban characteristics. They are characterized by the following: * Population exceeds 5,000 * At least 75% of main male working population is employed outside the agricultural sector * Minimum population density of 400 persons per km2\\"New Census Towns Showcase New India\\", Mint. Examples of Indian census towns include Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh; Indranagar in Tripura, Begampur, Chandpara, Nandigram and Chittaranjan in West Bengal, Chevella in Telangana, Amini in Lakshadweep, Deolali in Maharashtra, Ghatshila in Purbi Singhbhum District of Jharkhand; and BGR Township (Bongaigaon Refinery Township) in Bongaigaon Urban Agglomeration, Assam; Pileru in Andhra Pradesh, Chikhli in Gujarat. = Census 2011 = The number of census towns (CTs) in India grew from 1,362 in 2001 to 3,894 in 2011. As per Pradhan (2013),Pradhan (2013) these CTs account for 30% of the urban growth in the last decade. Pradhan also notes that the largest increase in the number of CTs was in the states of West Bengal and Kerala.  Ministry of Urban Development Notification  The Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India, in May 2016 asked the 28 states in India to take action to start the process of recognizing CTs as urban areas. The argument given for this conversion was that a statutory Urban Local Body (ULB) is required to ensure planned development of these areas. In this notification, Rajiv Gauba, Secretary (Urban Development) notes: > The opportunity of planned urban development might get lost if unplanned > construction and ad hoc provisioning of infrastructure is allowed to take > place over a long time. Additionally, the Ministry, in the notification, has informed the states that they stand to gain from according statutory status to these towns. With a greater number of statutory towns, the states would be able to get more money from the Centre as per the 14th Finance Commission Report. Additionally, under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT), 50% weightage is given to the number of statutory towns in the state/UT to determine the allocation of funds to these states/UTs. Following this notification, Maharashtra state government converted 19 CTs in the state to statutory ULBs. These 19 CTs are in close proximity to the town of Pune and this conversion is expected to lessen the infrastructure and population pressures on the town. Ireland According to Ireland's Central Statistics Office, a census town by definition has a \\"cluster of fifty or more occupied dwellings, not having a legally defined boundary, in which within a distance of 800 metres there is a nucleus of either thirty occupied houses on both sides of the road or twenty occupied houses on one side of the Road\\". Census towns were distinct from municipal towns; the latter, which had legally defined boundaries and local government powers, were abolished by the Local Government Reform Act 2014.

The attack occurred only a few hours after the capture of Corporal Gilad Shalit that led to Operation Summer Rains. Background Eliyahu Pinchas Asheri (; February 2, 1988 ‚Äì June 25, 2006) was an Israeli student from the settlement of Itamar, in the northern West Bank. He was a student at the religious pre-army Mechina (preparatory program) \\"Elisha\\" in Neveh Tzuf. His father Yitro Asheri, originally from Adelaide, was converted by St Kilda's Rabbi Philip Heilbrunn in 1986. Yitro Asheri had moved from the Adelaide suburb of Glenelg to the Jewish centre of North Adelaide at the time of his conversion. About six months after his conversion he moved to Israel. He first settled in kibbutz Sde Eliyahu where he learned some Hebrew and later moved to a yeshiva headed by Rabbi Haim Druckman. The Asheri family were one of the founding members of Itamar and have lived there from 1991. Kidnapping and murder On Sunday, June 25, 2006, Eliyahu was kidnapped while on his way from Beitar Illit to Neveh Tzuf, northwest of Ramallah. On Tuesday, June 27, 2006, Eliyahu's father, Yitro Asheri, initially submitted a missing-person report about his son to the Ariel Police. According to Yitro he did not report his son's absence for two days because Eliyahu used to regularly disappear for extended periods in the past without keeping daily contact with his parents. Asheri was last seen on 9:00 pm Sunday night, after he left the home of a friend in Betar Illit and was hitchhiking near the French Hill intersection of Jerusalem by one of his classmates. Asheri's body was found on June 29th 2006 in an open field near the village of Beitunia In addition, on Tuesday, the Palestinian militant group Popular Resistance Committees initially announced that the group has kidnapped a Jewish settler in the West Bank. On Wednesday, June 28, Abu Abir, the spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees, stated that Asheri would be \\"butchered in front of TV cameras\\" if Israel did not suspend its Operation Summer Rains into the Gaza Strip, which took place is in response to the kidnapping of Israel Defense Forces (IDF) corporal Gilad Shalit. Later on that day the Popular Resistance Committees stated that Asheri was slain. Around 2:30 am on June 29, the IDF recovered the body of Asheri which had been buried in an open field near the village of Beitunia, not far from Ramallah. Asheri's body was later transferred to the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute for a forensic investigation. The forensic investigation revealed that Asheri he was shot to death by a bullet to the head from close range, possibly the same day in which he was abducted. The IDF had been led to the site by the Palestinian militant Wasam Abu Ragila, who was a prime suspect of the murder of Asheri, who had been arrested on Wednesday by the Israeli police anti-terror unit and IDF troops and who confessed in his investigation about his part in the kidnapping and murder of Asheri and gave specific details about the location of Asheri's body. Perpetrators The Popular Resistance Committees claimed responsibility for the attack and presented Asheri's ID card. A Shin Bet investigation revealed that the abduction was carried out by a Tanzim terror cell connected with the PRC in Ramallah on instruction from the PRC leadership in Gaza. Burial Three of the murderers hid in a Palestinian police station before being arrested by IDF forces. This aerial photo shows their location. Thousands attended Asheri's funeral which was held on the same day his body was found, during the afternoon hours on the Mount of Olives Jewish cemetery in Jerusalem. The Chief Sephardic Rabbi Shlomo Amar eulogized Asheri in his funeral.  Aftermath  On the morning hours of 4 July 2006, during a joint operation conducted by the IDF and the Israel Security Authorities, the three Tanzim militants whom murdered Eliyahu Asheri and whom were hiding in the a Palestinian Police headquarters building in Ramallah, were apprehended after a three-hour standoff. The three men were Bassam Shafik Atiya Ahtiya, Khamze Salah Taktuk, and I'iam Fuab Naaef Kamamju. All three were reported to be members of the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and had been serving in the security forces of the Palestinian Authority. On 1 January 2007 Kamamju was sentenced to two life sentences for the murder of Eliyahu Asheri.

History The canal was constructed in the 1820s when a cut, some 3.2 km (2 mi) long on the south shore of Lough Foyle near Ballykelly was made in the direction of Limavady. As well as serving as a drainage channel, it was used for navigation, carrying goods brought from the Londonderry port and shellfish and kelp from the sand banks along the shore of the lough. The inhabitants of Limavady appealed for the building of a canal from Lough Foyle to the town. John Killaly was commissioned to produce a survey, and estimated the cost of construction at ¬£12,000. Despite optimistic estimates of the volumes of traffic likely to use the waterway, plans for a horse-drawn tramway were proposed in the early 1830s, and the canal plan was quietly dropped.

I really landed in a world of very glamorous style, beautiful clothes, just the world of what international fashion was about. If this had never happened, then the rest of it wouldn't have happened.\\" Abboud became a buyer at Louis Boston at age 23. Over the course of twelve years, he served as buyer, merchandiser, and eventually coordinator of promotion and advertising. Abboud joined Ralph Lauren in 1981, eventually becoming associate director of menswear design. He launched his own label in spring 1987. In 1988, JA Apparel was created as a joint venture between Abboud and GFT (Gruppo Finanziario Tessile) USA. In 1991 Abboud worked with fashion director Peter Speliopoulos. Abboud was the first designer to win the CFDA award as Best Menswear Designer two years in a row. Many of Abboud's famous friends are also his customers, including American trumpeter and composer Wynton Marsalis, author and former TV news anchor Tom Brokaw, and former Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. Abboud sold his trademarks and name to JA Apparel for $65 million in 2000. The company was acquired by private-equity firm J.W. Childs Associates for $73 million in 2004, and Abboud left JA Apparel in 2005. Abboud launched a new line called Jaz in 2007.

Personal life Abboud married Lynn Weinstein on June 6, 1976. They have two daughters and reside in Bedford, New York. He frequently appeared on Don Imus's radio show and was a regular caller to the New York City radio station, WFAN, to discuss his beloved Boston Red Sox, the New York Yankees' rival. In 2002, he was the first fashion designer to throw out the opening pitch at Boston's Fenway Park for a Red Sox game. Abboud's mother and sister both succumbed to breast cancer. As a result, Abboud has become a breast cancer activist who designed a one-of-a-kind GMC Sierra vehicle to fundraise for a Concept:Cure charity event and has participated in many other charity events for breast cancer research. GM offered a Joseph Abboud Limited Edition Buick Regal GS and LS from 2001 to 2004, and a Joseph Abboud Limited Edition Buick Rendezvous for 2004 and 2005. Abboud was honored as one of five \\"Men for the Cure\\" by GQ magazine and General Motors' Concept:Cure during a breast cancer fund-raiser. Concept:Cure raised $2.6 million for breast cancer organizations. Abboud says he has a personal interest in curing breast cancer, because his mother and sister both died from the disease.

It is useful for selecting for organisms that use citrate as its main carbon and energy source. It is a defined, selective and differential medium that tests for an organism's ability to use citrate as a sole carbon source and ammonium ions as the sole nitrogen source. The medium contains Sodium Chloride Sodium Citrate Dipotassium Phosphate Magnesium Sulphate Bromothymol Blue It also contains bromothymol blue, a pH indicator. Bromothymol blue is green at pH below 6.9, and then turns blue at a pH of 7.6 or greater. Physical Format Although it could be used in other formats (e.g., Petri plates), Simmons' citrate agar is often used in slants. Interpretation Organisms growing on Simmons' citrate agar are capable of using citrate as the sole carbon source and they can metabolize the ammonium salt in the medium (serving as a sole nitrogen source for growthBrown, A. and Smith, K. Benson's Microbiological Applications, Laboratory Manual in General Microbiology. 13th Ed. 2015. Pg. 277.). Use of citrate results in the creation of carbonates and bicarbonates as byproducts. Organisms degrading citrate must also use the ammonium salts, producing ammonia,Brown, A. and Smith, K.

The increase in pH then causes color change in the bromothymol blue indicator, turning it blue. Under neutral conditions the medium remains a green color. The color change to blue is useful because growth on Simmons' citrate agar is often limited and would be hard to observe if it were not for the color change. Sometimes, it is possible to detect growth on the Simmons' citrate agar without the accompanying color change to blue. This should be scored as a negative for the citrate use test.https://catalog.hardydiagnostics.com/cp_prod/Content/hugo/SimmonsCitrateAgar.htm Bacteria such as Salmonella and Providencia develop on such mediums.

Space advertising is the use of advertising in outer space or related to space flight. While there have only been a few examples of successful marketing campaigns, there have been several proposals to advertise in space, some even planning to launch giant billboards visible from the Earth. Obtrusive space advertising is the term used for such ventures. Advertising in space has faced criticisms for contributing to the existing problem of space debris and \\"polluting\\" the view of space as seen from the ground. It is regulated by several international and national legislation, though as technology improves further regulation will likely be required to cover new forms of space advertising. While space advertising is limited by both contemporary regulation and technological capability, in popular culture, space advertising has taken a variety of forms and displays.  History Beginning in the 1990s, when space technology became more available for companies after the Space Race and the fall of the Soviet Union, space advertising became a point of interest for various organizations to use as a marketing tool. There have been numerous attempts at space advertising since then, including Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX launching of a Tesla car into orbit. A major advantage of space advertising over other Earth-bound methods is the sheer scale of reach. Millions of people across multiple countries can be exposed to an advert orbiting Earth. As such, space advertising can provide valuable advertising capabilities, though relatively high start-up costs have prohibited this from becoming a commonplace advert media. When considering the fact that companies are willing to spend millions for short Super Bowl commercials, the sheer benefits provided by space advertising are very enticing for companies for advertising purposes.  Attempts  The high cost of orbital spaceflight (millions per launch) has discouraged attempts in the past. Space exploration authorities have also been reluctant to cater to advertisers. For example, NASA's restrictive policy on its employees' endorsing of products required astronauts to refer to M&M;'s as \\"candy-coated\\" chocolates (although the current administrator of NASA, Jim Bridenstine, argues for revising this policy). = Successful attempts = Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster mounted on Falcon Heavy upper-stage; Earth in the background The number of successful projects is low, due to the high cost of orbital launch and of maintaining the advertisement over time. Considering that SpaceX's minimum cost for sending objects into space is already in the millions, there have not been many attempts, and fewer successful attempts. Out of the few successful attempts that have worked, even fewer companies have managed to gain the publicity that they desire; Elon Musk is one such exception in sending out his Tesla Roadster into space. Some of the successful attempts include, but are not limited to, the following list: *Tokyo Broadcasting System (1990) - Paid spaceflight where a journalist was sent into orbit with the company logo on space vehicle *Pepsi (1996) - Paid approximately US$5 million to have a cosmonaut float a replica of the company's soda can outside the Russian space station *Tnuva (1997) - Filming of a milk commercial in space for the Israeli company *Pizza Hut (2000) - Paid approximately US$1 million for a space ad that saw their logo painted on a rocket *Element 21 (2006) - Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin hit a golf ball from the ISS porch as part of a commercial with Element 21 *SpaceX (2018) - Sent a Tesla Roadster into orbit as the dummy payload for Falcon Heavy test flight *Rocket Lab (2019) - Sent a shiny object, the Humanity Star, into orbit =Failed attempts = Although the sheer number of attempts of space advertising is not significant, there have been several past failed attempts as companies and organizations around the world planned different projects and plans to launch some type of marketing ploy into space. Some of the failed attempts that have occurred in the past include, but are not limited to, the following list: * France (1987) - Project named \\"The Ring of Light\\" which involved the launch of an inflatable ring in space * Russian Space Program (1990s) - Russian space program that involved the launch of satellites designed to reflect and beam sunlight to polar regions on Earth * Space Marketing Inc. (1993) - Proposed launching a giant billboard into space * China (2018) - Proposed putting an artificial moon in space  UN Treaties and Government Acts  While space advertising is a relatively new concept, it is subject to a some international treaties and national policies either specifically on space advertising or space commercial activities. = UN treaties = *Outer Space Treaty (1966) sets principles of international space law. It determines that all States should have the right to freely explore the outer space. This treaty provides free access to space so space advertising is not subject to global prohibition. *Space Liability Convention (1972) rules that a State is fully liable for damages caused by space objects launched in its territory. Under this treaty, States are responsible for private launches for commercial purposes, including advertising. = Government acts = *51 U.S. Code 50911 regulates that no license will be issued and no launch will be permitted for activities that involve obtrusive space advertising. This prohibition does not apply to other forms of advertising, such as displaying logos. The display of logos is allowed in both launches with commercial licenses and launches with experiment permits. *US's National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is discussing on loosening its commercial restriction policy as a governmental agency. It is considering to sell the naming rights of its spacecraft for financial purposes. Loosening such restrictions might cause more brands to conduct space advertising. *In 2019, NASA opened International Space Station (ISS) for space advertising and other short-duration commercial activities conducted by private companies' crews. * In November 2016, Japan legislated a licensing system for private-sector companies' launching. This act aims to stimulate Japanese's commercial activities in space by supporting third-party liability insurance as well as channeling more liability onto launching companies to assure customers who pay the launchers. * Russia prohibits launches which contaminate the outer space and create unfavorable environmental changes. However, there is no explicit ban on space advertising despite the light pollution and debris it potentially creates.  Criticism  = Obstacles = There is also growing concern about the dangers that can be caused by launching more objects - including advertisements - in space. Placing more satellites in space could increase opportunities for collisions, as stated by John Crassidis, a professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at the University at Buffalo. He believes that the biggest issue will be how the additional satellites can potentially become space debris. An implication of the additional advertising satellites in space could contribute to the Kessler syndrome. Many other incidents of space collisions have occurred: * French satellite collision (1996) - First verified case of collision between artificial space objects that further contributed to space debris. * China's anti-satellite test (2007) - Contributed to more than 3,000 pieces of space debris. *Russian satellite (2009) - A Russian satellite that was no longer functioning collided with a functioning U.S. Iridium commercial satellite and contributed to more than 2,000 additional space debris. = Pollution = Aside from the danger that can be brought about with increasing space advertising, pollution is also another problem. A paper that was presented to the United Nations by International Astronomical Union stated that \\"Scattered light from sunlit spacecraft and space debris, and radio noise from communications satellites and global positioning systems in space, reach the entire surface of the Earth‚Äù. Furthermore, there is currently no international consensus on the best way to remove the space debris since space in the international territory and so the increase in space debris will also make space even more impenetrable because of the increased likelihood of collision which can deter future space missions.  In popular culture  Advertising in outer space or space flight has been featured in several science fiction books, films, video games, and television series, most frequently in the animated series Futurama. They are usually shown as a satire of commercialization. = Film = * In the 2008 computer-animated science fiction film WALL-E, the star liner spacecraft Axiom features a wide variety of advertisements for Buy n Large products. *Logo used by the Planet Express company in FuturamaIn the movie Hancock, the logo of the fictitious All-Heart charity is painted on the Moon by the title character. = Literature = * In Fredric Brown's 1945 short story, \\"Pi in the Sky,\\" an inventor rearranges the apparent positions of the stars to form an advertising slogan. * In Robert A.

Passing all the exams for a solicitor except for criminal law, he worked at his profession from 1868 to 1878, then turning to natural history and writing. He wrote his first article for The Field on 13 March 1869 and remained on the staff for fifty years, becoming editor of the Naturalist Department in 1871 and later editor of the Shooting Department. By 1920 he contributed 2,326 articles as well as 124 obituary notices, as well as \\"Answers to Correspondents\\" which he wrote on Natural History, Falconry, Angling and other issues. Natural history Harting edited The Zoologist from 1877 to 1896 and was considered an authority on British birds. He was Assistant Secretary and Librarian to the Linnean Society. He was a Fellow of the Linn√¶an Society; a life member of the Zoological Society; member of the British Ornithologists' Union and a corresponding member of the American Ornithologists Union. In 1880 he was awarded a Silver Medal by the Acclimatisation Society of France \\"for publications\\". In 1871 he was invited to join the Prince of Wales (King Edward VII) to India but declined as it required him to be away from work for long. Falconry Late in the 1870s Harting started the New Hawking Club to enable Londoners to observe falconry; the Old Hawking Club was in the Salisbury Plain which was too far away for most people. He bought peregrine falcons and gyrfalcons from John Barr who had worked for Sandys Dugmore as a professional falconer from 1874-1877, hired Barr as a falconer and obtained permission from Lord Rosebery to use Epsom Downs for hawking. He set up near the Grandstand of the racecourse and had a successful season in the autumn of 1878, but the birds died of the croaks in the winter, ending the venture. Harting compiled Bibliotheca Accipitraria over many years, and was one of the few men seen in London with a hawk on his fist. Death and legacy Harting died aged 86 on 16 January 1928 in Weybridge, Surrey, where he lived most of his life, and is buried in the Town Cemetery. His headstone reads: > Pray for the Soul of Elizabeth Maria wife of James Edmund Harting of > Weybridge, in the Co.[unty] of Surrey, who departed this life 25th Jan 1907. > Also of James Edmund Harting Died 16th, January 1928 Aged 85 Years . Also > Etheldreda Mary Harting Died 23rd, Jan 1942 Aged 71. He married Elizabeth Lynch, daughter of J. M. Lynch of Co. Kildare, Ireland, in 1868. There was a son, Hugh, and a daughter, Etheldreda, to the marriage. The Field's obituary states that: > J.E. Harting was modest and unassuming but he knew the value of knowledge, > and never hesitated to use the authority of his long experience... He made > very little money, for he worked for what he loved, because he loved it > first as a sportsman and a gentleman, and he expected fair treatment, which > he invariably extended to others.
