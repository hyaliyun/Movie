Along with the Baumberge and its foothills and the Haltern Hills they are among the few prominent elevations in the otherwise gently rolling M√ºnsterland (which lies at in the centre), the River Werse passes the ridge at 100 m to the east and the Lippe passing it at a height of 60 m near Hamm-Uentrop at some distance away from their highest point. In terms of natural regions the Beckum Hills belong to the Kernm√ºnsterland, being located in the southeast of that region.  Location  The Beckum Hills lie in the southeastern part of M√ºnsterland, mainly on the territory of the municipalities of Beckum (west), Wadersloh (southeast), Oelde (northeast) and Ennigerloh (northwest) - all in Warendorf district. Their extreme southwest lies in the municipality of Lippetal (Soest district). The ridge is in the shape of a horseshoe, open towards the west, surrounding the town of Beckum which lies west of its centre. The northern heights are lower than those to the east and south. The hills frame the Kernm√ºnsterland, lying southeast of its centre, falling gently towards the inside of the horseshoe, but dropping sharply to the surrounding plain on the outside.

From the centre of a basin near Beckum, which is open towards the west, the terrain ascends, especially to the south and east, but also to the north, initially gradually up to the highest elevations of the range. On the southern edge of the Beckum Basin the H√∂xberg Scarp (H√∂xbergstufe) rises to the hill of H√∂xberg (162.6 m) in the south and climbs up to the Mackenberg (174.4 m) in the east. On the far side of the ridge the land falls abruptly into the plain. Further out is the rather lower Stromberg Scarp (Strombergstufe) which falls just as steeply towards the outside and is named after the village of Stromberg northeast of Beckum. In the northeast of the Beckum Hills is the Dromberg Scarp (Drombergstufe), named after the Dromberg (< 100 m, east of Ennigerloh-Ostenfelde), which only rises around 20 m over the surrounding area. The steep outward-facing escarpments are often covered by rough pasture, otherwise the natural climax vegetation alternates between beech woods and oak/hornbeam woods. Crops are grown here except on the slopes and in the hollows, mainly wheat and oats.Beckumer Berge landscape fact file by the BfN The main mineral deposit is limestone, which is quarried in Beckum and Ennigerloh in large quantities and used by the cement industry in the area. Formerly, strontianite was also mined and used as a whitener for the sugar industry.  History  South of Beckum and roughly southeast of the Hermannsberg hill is the cultural monument of Germanenlager, site of a Germanic camp. North of the hill is another one on a Germanic burial site (Germanengr√§ber).  Streams  The Kollenbach, Lippbach and Siechenbach streams all rise in the Beckum Hills and unite as the Werse, which leaves the hills to the west before turning north and later flowing into the Ems. Streams flowing northwards (Axtbach) (north) or eastwards (e. g. the Fortbach, Linzelbach and Bergeler Bach) from the hills converge on the Ems, whilst those flowing south (Liese, Biesterbach, Br√∂ggelbach) empty into the Lippe.  Woods  The larger woods on the Beckum Hills are the Vellerner Brook, der Hohe Hagen near Neubeckum, the Bergeler Wald between Oelde and Stromberg and the woods on the Mackenberg and Diestedder Berg.

The May Revolution () was a week-long series of revolutionary events that took place from May 18 to May 25, 1810, in Buenos Aires. It started the Argentine War of Independence, and it is considered the birth of modern Argentina. Commemorations May 25 is a patriotic date in Argentina, known as First Patriotic Government, with the character of a national holiday. The holiday is set by law 21.329 and it is immovable, meaning it is celebrated exactly on May 25 regardless of day of the week.Law on general holidays and days off shift The Bicentennial of Argentina was celebrated in 2010. May 25 was designated as a patriotic date in 1813, but the Argentine Declaration of Independence provides an alternative national day. In the beginning, this added to the conflicts between Buenos Aires and the provinces during the Argentine Civil War, because the date in May related to Buenos Aires and the date of July 9 related to the whole country. As a result, the unitarian Bernardino Rivadavia canceled the celebration of July 9, and the federalist Juan Manuel de Rosas re-allowed it, but without giving up celebrations in May. By 1880, with the federalization of Buenos Aires, the local connotations were removed and the May Revolution was considered the birth of the nation. The date, as well as a generic image of the Buenos Aires Cabildo, are used in different variants to honor the May Revolution. Two of the most notable are the Avenida de Mayo and the Plaza de Mayo at Buenos Aires, near the location of the Cabildo. The Pir√°mide de Mayo was erected in the Plaza a year after the revolution, and was rebuilt to its present form in 1856. \\"May 25\\" (in Spanish, \\"Veinticinco de Mayo\\") is the name of several administrative divisions, cities, public spaces, and landforms of Argentina. There are departments of this name in the provinces of Chaco, Misiones, San Juan, Rio Negro, and Buenos Aires, the latter one holding the Veinticinco de Mayo city. The cities of Rosario (Santa Fe), Jun√≠n (Buenos Aires), and Resistencia (Chaco) have eponymous squares. The King George Island is under sovereignty claims of Argentina, Britain, and Chile, as part of the Argentine Antarctica, British Antarctic Territory, and Chilean Antarctic Territory, with Argentina naming it \\"Isla 25 de Mayo\\". A commemorative Cabildo is used on coins of 25 cents, and an image of the Sun of May appears on the 5-cent coin of the current Argentine Peso. An image of the Cabildo during the Revolution appeared on the back of the 5-peso banknote of the former Peso Moneda Nacional. In popular culture The May 25 anniversary is the subject of articles each year in children's magazines in Argentina, for example Billiken, and is described in textbooks used in primary schools. These publications often omit some aspects of the historical event, as their violence and political content might be considered inappropriate for minors, such as the arming of the population following the preparations for the second British invasion, or the class struggle between the Criollos and the Spanish peninsulares. Children's literature often portrays the revolution as an event devoid of violence that inevitably would have happened one way or another, and the emphasis is on secondary issues such as whether or not it rained that day, or whether the use of umbrellas was widespread or limited to a minority. At most, the system promotes debates such as whether or not umbrellas were required on those days of 1810, or discusses dichotomies based in the contradiction marked by the song \\"The Sun of the 25 comes rising\\" and the drawings of Billiken, the Simulcop and the Student's Textbook, which show a plaza clearly rainy. This is intended to reduce, intentionally or unintentionally, the process that would mark with fire our future as nation. Presented as archetypal of the revolution is the presence of various workers, including a mazamorreros delivering pies among the people in the plaza on May 25. School plays or TV numbers on the national holiday would include such recreated scenes. La Revoluci√≥n de Mayo. The Argentina Centennial led to the creation of many different works and representations. Chilean painter Pedro Subercaseaux created many related paintings after requests from √Ångel Carranza, such as Cabildo abierto del 22 de mayo de 1810; Mariano Moreno writing in his desk; the embrace of Maip√∫ between San Mart√≠n and Bernardo O'Higgins; and the first playing of the Argentine National Anthem. Such works would later become canonical images. The centennial led to the production of La Revoluci√≥n de Mayo, an early silent film, shot in 1909 by Mario Gallo; it premiered in 1910. It was the first Argentine fiction film done with professional actors.La Revoluci√≥n de Mayo (Mario Gallo, 1909) Among the songs inspired by the events of May is the \\"Candombe de 1810\\". The tango singer Carlos Gardel sang \\"El Sol del 25\\", with lyrics by Domingo Lombardi and James Rocca, and \\"Salve Patria\\", by Eugenio C√°rdenas and Guillermo Barbieri. Peter Berruti, meanwhile, created \\"Gavota de Mayo\\" with folk music. An analysis of the May revolution from the point of view of literary fiction is the 1987 novel La Revoluci√≥n es un Sue√±o Eterno (The Revolution is an Eternal Dream), by Andr√©s Rivera. The narrative is based on the fictional diaries of Juan Jos√© Castelli, who was tried for his conduct in the course of the disastrous First Alto Per√∫ campaign. Through the fictional account of a mortally ill Castelli, Rivera criticizes the official history and the nature of the revolution.Nelda Pilia de Assun√ß√£o, Aurora Ravina, M√≥nica Larra√±aga (1999).

Many related books were written close to it, such as 1810, Enigmas de la historia argentina, Hombres de Mayo, and Historias de corceles y de acero.

Taxonomy The fungus was described as new to science in 1976 by American mycologists Howard E. Bigelow, Orson K. Miller, Jr., and Harry D. Thiers. A subspecies with blue flesh, O. olivascens var. indigo, was described growing on live oak in Baja California, Mexico. Several Omphalotus species with similar bioluminescent properties occur worldwide, all of which are presumed poisonous. The best known are the North American jack o'lantern mushroom (O. olearius) and the tsukiyotake (O. japonicus (Kawam.) Kirchm. & O.K. Mill. (formerly known as Lampteromyces japonicus (Kawam.) Sing.), found in Japan and eastern Asia. Molecular analysis shows the jack-o'-Lantern to be most closely related the ghost fungus Omphalotus nidiformis. Miller notes that the colours and shades of the ghost fungus most closely resemble this species. Description To an untrained eye, O. olivascens appears similar to some chanterelles, but unlike the chanterelle, the jack-o'-lantern mushroom has true, blade-like gills (rather than ridges) and it can have olive coloration that chanterelles lack; also, Omphalotus species are saprotrophic, grow directly on wood, and are bioluminescent. Ecology A saprobe or parasite, O. nidiformis is nonspecific in its needs and is compatible with a wide variety of hosts. Omphalotus species cause a white rot by breaking down lignin in their tree hosts. Biochemistry The jack o'lantern mushroom is poisonous; while not lethal, consuming this mushroom leads to very severe cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. The toxic ingredient of many species of Omphalotus is a sesquiterpene compound known as illudin S. This, along with illudin M, have been identified in O. nidiformis. The two illudins are common to the genus Omphalotus and not found in any other basidiomycete mushroom.

A perceptual set, also called perceptual expectancy, is a predisposition to perceive things in a certain way. Perceptual sets occur in all the different senses. They can be long term, such as a special sensitivity to hearing one's own name in a crowded room, or short term, as in the ease with which hungry people notice the smell of food. A mental set is a framework for thinking about a problem. It can be shaped by habit or by desire. Mental sets can make it easy to solve a class of problem, but attachment to the wrong mental set can inhibit problem-solving and creativity. Perceptual Perception can be shaped by \\"top-down\\" processes such as drives and expectations. An effect of these factors is that people are particularly sensitive to perceive certain things, detecting them from weaker stimuli than otherwise. A simple demonstration of the effect involved very brief presentations of non-words such as \\"sael\\". Subjects who were told to expect words about animals read it as \\"seal\\", but others who were expecting boat-related words read it as \\"sail\\". Sets can be created by motivation and so can result in people interpreting ambiguous situations so that they see what they want to see. For instance, a person's experience of the events in a sports match can be biased if they strongly support one of the teams. In one experiment, students were allocated to pleasant or unpleasant tasks by a computer. They were told that either a number or a letter would flash on the screen to say whether they were going to taste an orange juice drink or an unpleasant-tasting health drink. In fact, an ambiguous figure was flashed on screen, which could either be read as the letter B or the number 13. When the letters were associated with the pleasant task, subjects were more likely to perceive a letter B, and when letters were associated with the unpleasant task they tended to perceive a number 13. Perceptual sets have been demonstrated in many social contexts. People who are primed to think of someone as \\"warm\\" are more likely to perceive a variety of positive characteristics in them, than if the word \\"warm\\" is replaced by \\"cold\\". When someone has a reputation for being funny, an audience are more likely to find them amusing. Individual's perceptual sets reflect their own personality traits. For example, people with an aggressive personality are quicker to correctly identify aggressive words or situations. Mental Mental sets are subconscious tendencies to approach a problem in a particular way, either helping or interfering in the discovery of a solution. They are shaped by past experiences, habits, and, most importantly, culture. These sets also exist as parts of our cognitive processes although they do not always enter consciousness. This is demonstrated in the way bookkeepers can balance their book without being aware of using addition or subtraction. An inappropriate mental set hampers the solution of straightforward problems. This could happen if the set contains a false assumption or a belief that is not correct. For example, when people are asked, \\"When a United States plane carrying Canadian passengers crashes in international waters, where should the survivors be buried?\\" the phrasing of the question suggests that it is a problem of international law. People who interpret the statement with this mental set will miss the fact that survivors would not need to be buried. A specific form of mental set is functional fixedness, in which someone fails to see the variety of uses to which an object can be put. An example would be someone who needs a weight but fails to use an easily available hammer because their mental set is to think of a hammer as for a specific purpose.

He produced reflections on drama about his work to develop Swahili literature that regarded the crisis of East Africa, specifically in the 70s. At a conference on the meta-languages of literary studies, he then published a study on Aristotle (1980) . Many of his colleagues began studies on his oeuvre after this publication, which focused on Kenyan and Tanzanian criticism expressed in Kiswahili.  Ebrahim Hussein Poetry Prize  The Ebrahim Hussein Poetry prize is an honor awarded annually to the winner of the poetry contest under the same name. The contest was created by Safarani Seushi \\"as per wish of the late Gerald Belkin (1940-2012).\\" Belkin was in the process of creating this award, to be named after \\"his friend and renowned filmmaker and playwright, Professor Ebrahim Hussein,\\" when he passed away. Belkin's goal in establishing this award and prize fund was foster the careers of more Swahili Poets = Ebrahim Hussein Fellowship = The Ebrahim Hussein Endowment for research in African expressive cultures was established in the College of Letters and Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 2003 thanks to the generosity of Robert M. Philipson, alumnus of the College of Letters and Science (PhD‚Äô89). The College will award up to $7500 each year to one or more full-time graduate students in L&S; to carry out research on African expressive cultures in Africa and/or archives outside of the United States. The research must lead to a PhD dissertation, an MA thesis, or a publishable-quality paper. Doctoral students may receive up to $7500 each; MA level students may receive up to $3750 each. Recent winners of the fellowship include Vincent Ogoti, a Kenyan Playwright.  The Shield of Tradition  Summary: Sesota, a serpent, terrorizes a village, so a young peasant is called upon to defeat Sesota. The peasant succeeds and the village rejoices. Over time, the evil the serpent brought grows again, causing the village to become more and more depraved. Eventually, Sesota returns, with no one to challenge him. Analysis: This is a retelling of a Swahili folkloric story, where Sesota is defeated by being trapped in a pot rather than killed and eventually returning. In the retelling, Sesota represents colonialism that the \\"peasant\\" desperately tries to fight. Hussein is speaking to how the remnants of colonialism still remain and that any amount of western influence on African culture brings back that evil. Through this, the retelling also shows that there's no \\"good vs. evil\\" like in traditional stories, but that the world is far more morally grey. One significant moment is when the village is celebrating after Sesota's death; names of a variety of famous African writers and artists are listed. Hussein seems to be criticizing his fellow artists, saying that their work only comes during moments of joy, rather than it being used to combat oppression.

This early success prompted him to seek a career in art. To gain experience, in 1919, he entered the Artists' Department in a small publishing house, Graham & Heslip Ltd., and for over five years illustrated countless booklets, and did figure sketches in black and white and colour.Theo Snoddy, Dictionary of 20th Century Irish Artists 1926‚Äì1936 ‚Äì The Belfast Telegraph and \\"Oscar\\" In May 1926, at the age of 21, Glenn saw his own strip cartoon called \\"Oscar\\" appear daily in the Belfast Telegraph. \\"Oscar\\" featured a little man with a long nose who wore the baggy trousers of the period known as Oxford bags.

The Close comprises buildings associated with the cathedral and the clergy which encircle the Cathedral. The Close grew up around the cathedral during medieval times and today some medieval buildings remain in the Close but the majority of buildings date from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Fortifications After raids from the Vikings during the 9th century, the Cathedral lost some of its power. Bishop Clinton fortified the Cathedral in the 12th century. A deep man-made ditch was dug on three sides and the south was defended naturally by Minster Pool. This fortification effectively created the Close. In 1299 Bishop Langton was licensed to wall the Close in stone and crenellate it. He also rebuilt the gates. The work was unfinished at his death in 1321. In 1322, during the crisis involving Thomas, Earl of Lancaster, the chapter under royal pressure ordered the immediate clearance of the ditch and the completion of the west tower of the south-east gate. The fortification comprised corner towers and interval towers along the wall. An octagonal tower at the north-east corner was incorporated in Langton's palace; its base still survives. At the south- east corner, there was a parapet along the top of the wall and a projecting turret, which survive as part of the later St. Mary's House. The south-west tower was recorded in 1312‚Äì13 and was shown on Speed's 1610 map of Lichfield; it had been demolished by 1661. The north-west tower had a statue of Bishop Walter, presumably Walter Langton, in the 1390s; the tower was evidently another Civil War casualty. Three interval towers were placed on the east wall, two of them incorporated in Langton's palace and the third on the site of the later Selwyn House. The Dean's Tower, so called in 1315, apparently stood on the west wall; it had been demolished by 1661. The gate built by Langton at the south-east corner of the Close had two towers. The eastern one, whose base was excavated in the late 1980s, was a half-octagon with 12-foot sides. The western tower was presumably of similar dimension. The gate had a portcullis in 1376. There was a drawbridge, still in existence in the earlier 18th century, which crossed the outflow of water from Minster Pool, and also a wicket for pedestrians. The gate was removed in the mid-18th century in order to improve access for coaches into the Close. A northward extension of the eastern tower was used as a porter's lodge in the early 17th century. After being damaged in the Civil War, it was rebuilt and in 1666 was assessed for tax on four hearths. By 1734 the porter or verger lived in a house at the west gate, and the former lodge was demolished between 1812 and 1836. The west gate was completed by the chapter in the time of Bishop Northburgh, 1322‚Äì58. It was in the form of a tall block with side windows. It was decorated with coats of arms, and there was a statue of the Virgin Mary by 1530. The gate was demolished in 1800 to make room for Newton's College. Traces of its stonework survive on the north side of the road from Beacon Street. A house, evidently at the north-west corner of the gate, was let in 1661 to James Barrow, a tailor. He converted a dungeon underneath the house into a cellar for his own use and was ordered by the chapter to dig another dungeon of the same size with a hole to provide light. In 1734 the house was occupied by the verger; it was rebuilt in 1835 and survives as no. 1 the Close. There is no evidence that the Close ditch ever contained water. It was dry in the 1590s, and evidently in the mid 1550s. By the mid-17th century it was called the Dimple or Dimble, a name meaning a deep hollow filled with trees or bushes. Notable buildings *Bishop's Palace ‚Äì In the north east corner built in 1687, replacing Langton's medieval palace which was destroyed during the Civil War. The building is now occupied by the Cathedral School. *The Deanery ‚Äì Lying north of the cathedral the Deanery was built in 1707 and is a fine example of the Queen Anne style of architecture. *Vicars Close ‚Äì In 1315 Bishop Langton gave the vicars land at the west end of the Close. The Vicars built their houses college style around two courtyards with a common hall at the west end of the central range. Vicars' Close is at the northern courtyard of the two and has four ranges of houses and a common hall. The houses were built c.1315‚Äì1500, with the common hall at the west end of the central range rebuilt in 1756 and No.5 in the west range rebuilt in 1764. The most complete row of medieval building is along the north side of Vicars' Close, where the timber framed houses are all of one bay; they are jettied to the south and have a tall chimney stack against their north wall. The buildings in the courtyard are all Grade II* listed buildings. *Erasmus Darwin House ‚Äì On the west side of the Close facing Beacon Street. The house was built in the 18th century and was the home of poet and physician Erasmus Darwin.

Manchester was late in commissioning a First World War memorial compared with most British towns and cities; the city council did not convene a war memorial committee until 1922. The committee quickly achieved its target of raising ¬£10,000 but finding a suitable location for the monument proved controversial. The preferred site in Albert Square would have required the removal and relocation of other statues and monuments, and was opposed by the city's artistic bodies. The next choice was Piccadilly Gardens, an area already identified for a possible art gallery and library; but in the interests of speedier delivery, the memorial committee settled on St Peter's Square. The area within the square had been had been purchased by the City Council in 1906, having been the site of the former St Peter's Church; whose sealed burial crypts remained with burials untouched and marked above ground by a memorial stone cross. Negotiations to remove these stalled so the construction of the cenotaph proceeded with the cross and burials in situ. Having picked a site, it was originally proposed to choose an architect by open competition, but the memorial committee was criticised in the local press when it reserved the right to overrule the judgement of the independent assessor. A sub-committee therefore approached Sir Edwin Lutyens directly, who produced, in a matter of weeks, a variation of his design for the Cenotaph in London. The memorial consists of a central cenotaph and a Stone of Remembrance flanked by twin obelisks, all features characteristic of Lutyens' works. Raised steps either side of the Stone of Remembrance provided east-facing tribunes for the colour party in memorial parades. The cenotaph is topped by an effigy of a fallen soldier and decorated with relief carvings of the imperial crown, Manchester's coat of arms and inscriptions commemorating the dead. The structures, based on classical architecture, use abstract, ecumenical shapes rather than overt religious symbolism. In submitting the design, Lutyens stated that he envisaged the crypts and cross as remaining in place; as the cenotaph could stand on the foundations of the former church tower and the cross would serve to \\"consecrate the site\\", while there would be no explicit religious symbolism on the cenotaph itself. The memorial was unveiled on 12 July 1924 by the Earl of Derby, assisted by Mrs Bingle, a local resident whose three sons had died in the war. It cost ¬£6,940 and the remaining funds were used to provide hospital beds. The Cenotaph on its present site; looking northwest In 2014, Manchester City Council dismantled the memorial and reconstructed it at the northeast corner of St Peter's Square next to Manchester Town Hall to make room for the expanded Metrolink tram network. It is a grade II* listed structure and in 2015, Historic England recognised Manchester Cenotaph as part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Virtually every village, town, or city erected some form of memorial to commemorate their dead. During the war, only London provided more recruits to the British Army than Manchester. The Manchester Regiment and the Lancashire Fusiliers, which largely recruited from the city and towns to the north, were swollen by pals battalions drawn from local employers, social groups, and neighbourhoods.O'Neil, pp. 17‚Äì18. By the end of the war, over 13,000 men of the Manchester Regiment, including more than 4,000 from the pals battalions and 13,600 Lancashire Fusiliers, had been killed. An estimated 22,000 Mancunians died and 55,000 were wounded.O'Neil, pp. 90‚Äì91. Commissioning The Rochdale Cenotaph, also by Lutyens, with the tower of Rochdale Town Hall in the background Many towns and cities began to erect war memorials after the armistice, but Manchester did not get underway until 1922. As a result of pressure from the local branch of the Royal British Legion, the city council convened a war memorial committee of 12 persons, chaired by the mayor and consisting of \\"Aldermen and Councillors [and] representative men connected with diÔ¨Äerent aspects of Manchester business, with the military forces and other sections of Manchester life\\", to explore options for commemoration.Skelton, p. 63. The committee limited the budget to ¬£10,000 and very rapidly raised this sum; donors being assured that local firms would benefit from the construction and resulting employment. Nonetheless, the letters pages of local newspapers featured several missives from ex-servicemen who felt that the cenotaph was a waste of money and that the funds would be better spent on the survivors and war widows, many of whom faced extreme hardship as a result of high levels of unemployment in the aftermath of the war.Carden-Coyne, pp. 116‚Äì117. For a civic memorial to the Great War, ¬£10,000 was relatively modest sum; the counterpart public appeal in Rochdale had raised nearly ¬£30,000, and the resulting Rochdale Cenotaph, then just completed, had cost ¬£12,611. The proprietor of the Daily Dispatch newspaper, Edward Hulton, offered to cover the entire cost of the Manchester memorial, but the committee declined, feeling that the funding should come from the people and city of Manchester. Subsequently, the committee resisted all suggestions that the memorial budget might be increased, or that the list of donors might be extended. Constitutionally, the memorial committee was a committee of the City Council, but acted throughout as having independent discretion and funds. Three potential sites were considered for the memorial: Albert Square, Piccadilly Gardens and St Peter's Square; St Ann's Square being ruled out as already containing the civic monument to the Boer War. With the support of the Royal British Legion, Albert Square emerged as the favourite. The site proved controversial as the Manchester Society of Architects and Manchester Art Foundation led objections to the removal and relocation of statues in the square, which would have been required to create a suitable space for the war memorial. King George V had consented to the relocation of the memorial to his German grandfather, Prince Albert, but objections persisted and the city architect estimated the cost of relocating the statues at ¬£8,400. The City Council rejected Albert Square in March 1923, and voted by 71 votes to 30 in favour of Piccadilly Gardens as the site for the monument. The City was already considering building an art gallery at Piccadilly on the space left after the old Manchester Royal Infirmary had been demolished, albeit that this was currently filled by temporary huts housing the books from Manchester Central Library. Siting the memorial on this land was welcomed by the Art Gallery Committee, who proceeded to commission designs for a memorial in the form of a 'Hall of Memory'; but would be contingent on also funding a new library. As nothing was yet decided on these wider schemes, any plans for the area would have delayed the war memorial project further and so in May 1923 the memorial committee, acting on its own initiative, disregarded the vote of the Council and switched attention to St Peter's Square.Hartwell (2004), p. 332.Skelton, pp. 63‚Äì64. The square was itself a controversial choice; both because it was then much the smallest of the three options, and also due to its being the location of the former St Peter's church, demolished in 1907. The statutory trustees appointed to administer the funds paid over by the city council for the deconsecrated site of the church had been required by the Manchester Churches Act of 1906 to erect and maintain a memorial cross on the site, as well as to protect the bodies of the dead still interred in vaults underneath; and they objected to the removal of both. The dispute was only partially resolved, as although the trustees consented to the construction of the cenotaph they refused to allow the removal of the cross while the burials remained in place. Accordingly, discussions proceeded with the Manchester diocese on the basis that the burials would need to be removed individually and reburied on separate plots in one of the City cemeteries; the cross being relocated to the grounds of Manchester Cathedral. But this would add considerable time and cost to the memorial project. Lutyens' Whitehall cenotaph in London More controversy surrounded the choice of architect. The Manchester Art Federation and other bodies petitioned the city council to hold an open competition, to which the Council agreed. The war memorial committee appointed Percy Worthington, a local architect, as the assessor for the competition but attracted severe criticism in the local press when it reserved to itself the right to veto Worthington's choice. After further debate, a subcommittee approached Sir Edwin Lutyens,Skelton, pp. 64‚Äì65. and the competition collapsed. Conveniently, Lutyens assured the committee in August 1923 that his design could accommodate the cross and crypts remaining in place, while clearly distinct; and so this whole issue was deferred until after the cenotaph had been completed and dedicated. =Architect= Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\", was amongst the most prominent designers of war memorials in Britain. Before the war, he had established his reputation designing country houses for wealthy patrons but the war had a profound effect on him and from 1917 onwards he dedicated much of his time to memorialising the casualties. The Stone of Remembrance that he designed in 1917 appears in all large Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) cemeteries and in several of his civic memorials, including Manchester's. His Cenotaph on Whitehall in London became the focus for national Remembrance Sunday commemorations and one of the most influential designs for war memorials in Britain. Manchester's cenotaph, a close replica, is one of seven in England based on it.Borg, pp. 74‚Äì75. Lutyens designed the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme, the largest British war memorial in the world, for the IWGC in 1928. Around the same time he designed his only other commission in Manchester, the Midland Bank at 100 King Street. Design Manchester's war memorial is a cenotaph, flanked by twin obelisks, and a Stone of Remembrance, all in Portland stone on a raised coved platform.Corke, p. 55. The memorial covers an area of approximately by .Boorman (2005), pp. 112‚Äì113. The cenotaph is high made from of Portland stone. The pylon is surmounted by a sculpture of an unknown soldier, partially covered by his greatcoat, lying on a catafalque. The pylon rises from the base in diminishing stages, narrowing as it rises. Below the catafalque, on the front and rear, are moulded swords and imperial crowns, and to the sides are Manchester's coat of arms surrounded by laurel wreaths. The cenotaph bears inscriptions below the coat of arms: \\"\\" (on the north-west side) and \\"\\" (on the south east).Wyke, pp. 130‚Äì132 Identical, high obelisks stand either side of the cenotaphBoorman (1988), pp. 123‚Äì124. and the Stone of Remembrance is set in front. The stone, a monolith in the shape of an altar, is long and subtly, aesthetically curved; it is devoid of decoration and inscribed, \\"\\".Ridley, p. 278.Skelton, p. 24. Lutyens' design, with flanking objects, recumbent figure and a Stone of Remembrance set in front of the cenotaph, is reminiscent of his earlier cenotaph in Southampton. While other First World War memorials feature sculpture or overt religious symbolism, Manchester's, like many of his memorials, uses abstract and ecumenical shapes inspired by classical architecture. Its effigy of the unknown soldier raised high on the pylon rather than at eye level is reminiscent of ancient tower tombs. The sculpture's position high above eye level gives the soldier anonymity, complementing the abstract shapes of the structures and allowing an onlooker to project an image of their own choosing onto it,Winter, pp. 102‚Äì104.Borg, p. 96.Amery et al., p. 148.King, p. 139. and distances the viewer from the fact of the death and focuses on an idealised sense of self-sacrifice.Carden-Coyne, p. 155. The Pevsner City Guide to Manchester described the cenotaph as one of the few impressive war memorials in Manchester but, in its original site at western end of St Peter's Square, lamented its cluttered setting and proximity to the overhead powerlines of the Metrolink tram system. The cenotaph, obelisks, and stone are features typical of Lutyens' war memorial work, although Manchester's is one of only two with flanking obelisks‚ÄîNorthampton's has a similar pair of obelisks flanking a Stone of Remembrance.Barnes, p. 118.Borg, p. 88.Brown, p. 175.

Power lines and platforms for the Metrolink tram system are visible beyond the garden of remembrance. St Peter's Square already housed a memorial cross by Temple Moore marking the location of the former St Peter's Church, which had been demolished in 1907. The statutory trustees had agreed with the British Legion in recommending Albert Square as the memorial site; nevertheless the Bishop of Manchester, ex-officio chairman of the trustees, had subsequently indicated approval to relocating the cross and burials from St Peters Square, should this be needed to accommodate the war memorial. A full meeting of the trustees did not, however, endorse him in this. Lutyens provisionally resolved the stand-off by stating that he was happy for the cross to be retained; and the issue was adjourned until after the cenotaph had been erected.Hartwell (2002), p. 202.Skelton, p. 65. Nevertheless, the impracticality of having a cross obscuring the view of the cenotaph for spectators became apparent at the dedication ceremony, and negotiations about relocating cross and burials recommenced; but the trustees remained reluctant and after further discussion Lutyens said he did not object to their remaining. According to Tim Skelton, author of Lutyens and the Great War (2008), \\"the heated discussions resulted in a compromise that clearly show[ed]\\" as Moore's cross \\"severely impinged on the setting of the memorial and appear[ed] to be an integral part of it\\". Despite the war memorial committee's promise that local labour would be used, the monument was built by Nine Elms Stone Masonry Works of London, resulting in a sense of betrayal in the local community. Having cost ¬£6,940, it was unveiled on 12 July 1924 by Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby. Derby's family had been involved in politics for generations, and he had held various public offices during the war including Secretary of State for War. He was assisted by Mrs Bingle, a local woman from Rylance Street, Ancoats, who lost three sons in the war. Two years earlier, Lord Derby had unveiled Lutyens' Rochdale Cenotaph, away.Carden-Coyne, p. 130. Mrs Bingle represented \\"the mothers and wives of Manchester who had made sacrifices greater than life itself\\". She wore the eight medals awarded to her sons: Sergeant Ernest Bingle aged 34 and Gunner Charles Bingle aged 27 of the Royal Garrison Artillery, and Corporal Nelson Bingle aged 21 of the Royal Engineers. All were killed in 1918‚ÄîNelson in March and Ernest and Charles in May.Simpson, pp. 104‚Äì105. The unveiling ceremony at Manchester took place in front of a large crowd and a guard of honour from the Manchester Regiment and ex-servicemen. The service was led by the Dean of Manchester, the Very Reverend Gough McCormick, and the Baptist minister Reverend John Edward Roberts of Union Chapel on Oxford Road. Several dignitaries gave speeches including the lord mayor and Lord Derby, who remarked that the memorial was not only a tribute to the dead but a warning as to the cost of war. After the unveiling, a procession of women laid flowers around the base of the memorial. The remainder of the ¬£10,000 raised by the war memorial committee was used to provide hospital beds for ex-servicemen and their families. The controversies that arose during the memorial's gestation largely disappeared after its unveiling; the Manchester City News praised the design for its \\"simplicity of forms and rhythmic beauty of proportion\\". A marble plaque, added nearby and dedicated to \\"\\", was removed during the Second World War. In 1949, the dates for World War II were added as inscriptions on the obelisks, and the surrounding area was laid out as a garden of remembrance designed by the city architect, L. C. Howitt. The steps and lawns of the garden of remembrance provided space for the Italian memorial plaque to be restored; and over subsequent years, further plaques were added later to commemorate the dead of the Korean War and other later conflicts. Nevertheless, by enclosing cross and cenotaph within a single space, the post- WWII memorial complex conflicted with Lutyens's intention that the cenotaph should be free of explicit religious associations. Marking the 75th Anniversary of the siege of Leningrad, a plaque commemorating the Red Army personnel who died liberating Europe in World War II was unveiled on 3 September 2020. The plaque reads: \\". =Relocation= The suitability of St Peter's Square re-emerged in 1925 during discussions about the proposed art gallery and consideration was given to moving the cenotaph to Piccadilly. Over the following century the square itself changed radically. In 1924 the square was small and, apart from the Midland Hotel most of the surrounding buildings were no more than four stories high; but then an entire block on the north side was cleared in the 1930s for the construction behind it of the Manchester Central Library; and then further blocks to the northeast were cleared in 1980 to open the square to the Manchester Town Hall Extension and the Collier Street facade of Manchester Town Hall. From 1992 St Peter's Square became the location of one of the main city centre stops for Manchester's Metrolink tram system; such that stanchions and overhead power lines increasingly intruded on the cenotaph, and platforms abutted directly onto the low wall around the post-WWII garden of remembrance. In March 2011, Manchester City Council began a public consultation on moving the cenotaph to an alternative site (within the 1980 extension of the square), to allow for further expansion of the tram network. The plans had a mixed reception. Some objections were made by the public but there was support from veterans, church, and heritage groups. The relocation was approved in 2012, and in January 2014 the cenotaph was dismantled before it was cleaned and restored. The burial crypts were to remain beneath the new tram-lines, and so were provided with a concrete lid, while the memorial cross, also cleaned and restored, was returned to its original position above the crypts. In 2014 the cenotaph was reconstructed in a new memorial garden on the opposite side of the square aligned with Manchester Town Hall's southern entrance. The city council commissioned conservation architects Stephen Levrant Heritage Architecture to manage the relocation and design the new setting which places the cenotaph, obelisks and stone on a plinth in an oval surrounded by a low wall. The garden opened to the public in September 2014. The cenotaph was damaged in the first week when skateboarders began using the area as a skatepark. Repair work costing ¬£4,000 started shortly afterwards, and extra security measures (including 24-hour CCTV) were put in place.

Listed status provides legal protection from demolition or modification; grade II is applied to about 92% of listed buildings of \\"special interest, warranting every effort to preserve them\\". It was upgraded in 1994 to grade II*, which is reserved for \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\" and applies to about 5.5% of listed buildings. In November 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Manchester Cenotaph was recognised as part of the \\"national collection\\" of Lutyens' war memorials.

At its peak, the store, which began life as a grocery, occupied a huge building at Summit Street and Adams downtown, maintained an annex store two blocks away, and a branch store in north Toledo. It was a unique Toledo experience, and a community center. The family-founded store changed hands several times before all locations closed by 1973. The original store building was destroyed by fire two years later. Early history The firm that would be known as Tiedtke's set up shop in 1894. Brothers Charles and Ernest Tiedtke, who grew up farming in what is today Toledo's east side, opened a grocery store at Summit and Monroe downtown (near present-day Fifth Third Field). With Toledo an important lake port, their primary business was lake traffic, delivering groceries and supplies to the freighters that would pass through on the Maumee River. Soon, business was brisk enough for them to expand and carry dry goods, as well as require a fleet of horse-and-buggies to handle the demand. The brothers would soon take on a partner, William A. Todd, who helped generate additional lake and marine accounts for the Tiedtke brothers. The business was briefly known as Tietke and Todd, but by 1898, Todd had gone. The Tiedtkes expanded the business further and by 1910, they had moved the business up Summit Street to the northeast corner of Adams, which it would occupy for the next six decades. With their core business food, they leased the upper floors of the building to firms selling furniture, housewares, clothing and shoes. The brothers also added a bakery, deli and restaurants. The concept was ahead of its time, a forerunner of what would be termed \\"one-stop shopping\\". Becoming a retail mecca Another reason behind the success of the business was its commitment to its employees and to customer service. Tiedtke's would eventually need a fleet of trucks to support the deliveries being made to customers all over Toledo. The brothers were known for the gratitude they showed their employees and were often very generous. Occasionally, an employee who was ill or experiencing financial difficulties would have his medical bills or mortgage paid off by the brothers, no questions asked. The brothers helped take marketing and sales to a new level by creating elaborate displays for fruits, and vegetables, and they created their own coffee blend, Parkwood Coffee. They would often set up the ventilation system to spread the fresh-brewed coffee aroma throughout the store, luring customers to the product. This was one of the first megastore groceries. The brothers purchased a tugboat and would sell and deliver to mariners as they went through the Maumee River on their way to the Great Lakes. Overhead trolleys in the store would move customer's change, product and receipts. The store front windows were white washed, and covered with advertisements, like a carnival side show. This was thought to cut down on the need to advertise. In 1925, the brothers sold the business to the Kobacker family, which owned the Boston Stores chain in Columbus, Ohio and Buffalo, New York. Jerome Kobacker and his son Marvin strove to preserve the Tiedtke's brand by continuing the brothers' policies, retaining their marketing philosophy and keeping the name. They bought out the leased businesses in the Summit Street building so that everything in the six-story building was sold by Tiedtke's, making the business a full-service department store and keeping groceries the center of the business plan.\\" Like most large American cities at the time, the center of Toledo's commerce was its downtown core, and thanks to public transportation and its strategic location on a main artery, Tiedtke's saw a lot of foot traffic from the 1930s through the 1950s. Tiedtke's was within walking distance to at least three other major Toledo department stores, Lasalle & Koch, Lamson Brothers and the Lion Store. Unlike the other three, which were more upscale, Tiedtke's was just as elegant, but catering more to the common man, selling top-quality goods at reasonable prices. The store would eventually cover the entire block, bounded by Summit, Adams and Water Streets. A large parking lot was laid out between the Water Street side of the store and the riverfront. Tiedtke's would eventually open an annex store just two blocks down Summit Street. As Toledo's suburbs developed, Tiedtke's opened a branch store at Greenwood Mall, an open-air shopping center on Toledo's north side. Decline and closure In 1961, the Kobackers sold Tiedtke's to the Detroit-based department chain Federal's. They, too, retained the Tiedtke's nameplate, but made a lot of other changes, such as altering the layout of the sales floors and deemphasizing the store's core grocery business. This, along with the ongoing flight of residents from the inner-city to the suburbs, caused sales at the store to decline. Nevertheless, the store continued to be a community center. Big and quirky events were part of its modus operandi. For example, it had a grand unveiling of a Wisconsin Cheddar; and in 1961 it brought in a real giant, Jakob Nacken to celebrate its \\"big event.\\" By the early 1970s, Tiedtke's closed its downtown annex store, and Federal's had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the summer of 1972. By then, though, it was too late. Management closed the main Summit Street store for good on September 2, 1972, with just three days notice to employees. The Tiedtke's location at Greenwood Mall hung on for another year, and it closed in 1973. A Montgomery Ward store would later occupy that space, while the downtown flagship store sat vacant and fell into disrepair. Fire and future of site On the evening of May 7, 1975, Toledo firefighters were called to the Tiedtke's building on a report of a fire breaking out in the structure. According to the May 8 edition of the Toledo Blade, the blaze grew to a three- alarmer within an hour. Flames towered hundreds of feet into the sky and could be seen for miles, also damaging a furniture store across Adams Street. A huge crowd gathered in the former Water Street parking lot to watch the blaze, and several times they tried to break through the cordon of police and firemen. The site was demolished and sat empty until an indoor mall, the Portside Festival Marketplace, opened on the site in 1984. The mall was unable to sustain itself at that location and it closed in 1990. Today, the site is occupied by the Imagination Station science museum, a hotel and Promenade Park, a huge riverfront space.

Captina Creek is an important creek to the region and home to about 56 species of fish. History In April 1774, the frontiersman Michael Cresap was accused of killing two Indians at the mouth of Captina Creek in revenge for the murder of a white trader earlier that month. He was later exonerated, but this and the subsequent Yellow Creek Massacre were the sole causes of Lord Dunmore's War.Albach, James R (1858), Annals of the West: embracing a concise account of principal events which have occurred in the Western States and Territories from the discovery of the Mississippi Valley to the Year Eighteen Hundred and Fifty-Seven compiled from the most authentic sources and published by James R. Albach; Pittsburgh: W.S. Haven, Book and Job Printer, pp 217-219. There is a plaque located inside a gazebo on the Powhatan Point village fair grounds dedicated to George Washington at the mouth of the creek. The plaque states that Washington had set camp for a night at the mouth of Captina creek while exploring the Ohio Valley. The gas industry has a heavy presence in Belmont County, and has caused several spills that may have damaged the ecosystem around Captina Creek. Ecology Captina Creek is home to some 56 known species of fish. The surrounding area is also home to many diverse plant life and rare and endangered species such as the bobcat and the Eastern Hellbender. Geography Captina Creek is located in the southeastern part of Ohio. The creek is paralleled by State Route 148, which runs from the mouth at the Ohio river, past the source near Barnesville.

A unit of the IRA's South Armagh Brigade fired an improvised mortar at the British Army base in Crossmaglen, County Armagh. The mortar round hit and shot down the helicopter, serial number ZD275, while it was hovering over the helipad. Three British soldiers and a Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) member were wounded.  Background  Since the 1970s, the IRA developed a series of home-made mortars. The goal was to produce devices to be used as \\"stand-off\\" weapons, capable of being launched from safe ranges upon police or military outposts and easy to conceal on dead-ground.Geraghty, p. 187 The different designs evolved in 1992 into the Mark 15 mortar, widely known as the \\"barrack buster\\". The mortar shell consisted of a one metre long metal propane cylinder with a diameter of 36 cm that contained around 70 kg of home-made explosives and with a range between 75 and 275 m. The cylinder was an adaptation of a commercial 'Kosangas' gas cylinder for heating and cooking gas used in rural areas in Ireland.Geraghty, p. 193 The first use of the \\"barrack buster\\" took place on 7 December 1992 against a joint RUC/British Army base in Ballygawley, County Tyrone.Ryder,p. 256The Irish Emigrant, 14 December 1992  The attack  IRA barrack buster mortar On the evening of 20 March 1994, a Lynx helicopter, serial number ZD275, was in the process of landing at the large British Army base at Crossmaglen. Meanwhile, an IRA unit had mounted a Mark 15 mortar on a tractor, concealed behind bales of hay. The tractor was parked 150 yards from the intended target, on waste ground. At 20:27, there was a sudden blackout across Crossmaglen's square and at the same time, a single mortar shell was lobbed into the barracks. The IRA had used the mains for the collapsing circuit of the firing pack, turning off the street's power supply and allowing the mortar's own battery to trigger the launcher. When the Lynx was hovering 100 feet over the helipad, the mortar round hit the aircraft on the tail's boom, which was severed from the fuselage. The machine spun out of control, but the pilot was able to crash-land the Lynx inside the base. A Grenadier Guards' patrol spotted a huge orange fireball from a mile away. Three members of the crew managed to get out with minor injuries, but a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary was trapped inside the blazing wreckage. The constable was rescued just before the fuel tanks and the ammunition started to explode. Author Toby Harnden described the incident as the most successful IRA operation against a helicopter in the course of the Troubles.Harnden, p. 398Geraghty, pp. 198‚Äì199English & Oppenheimer, p. 233  Aftermath  After the incident, the IRA and Sinn F√©in were criticised by the Social Democratic and Labour Party Member of the Parliament for the area Seamus Mallon, who said: John Fee, a local SDLP councillor who described the attack as \\"an act of lunacy\\", was later beaten by two men outside his home. The IRA denied responsibility.Geraghty, p. 199 Corporal Robert Tomlinson of the Royal Military Police was awarded the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service for his part in coming to the aid of the wounded constable and organising his medical evacuation. Corporal Wayne Cuckson of the Royal Logistic Corps was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for dragging the wounded constable out of the crashed aircraft. Cuckson, who reached the rank of Warrant Officer Class Two, died on 6 April 2011 in a crash while driving his motorcycle between Abingdon and Oxford.Abingdon crash victim was soldier. BBC News, 15 April 2011. There was a second mortar attack on a British military helicopter on 12 July 1994, at Newtownhamilton, when an RAF Puma carrying 12 soldiers crash- landed on a soccer pitch after being hit on its tail by another Mark 15 mortar launched from a tractor. The helicopter was lifting off from the local military base. No serious injuries were reported.IRA downs British Helicopter The Telegraph, 13 July 1994 The Puma sustained Category 3 or Category 4 damage on the RAF scale. After returning to service, the machine was definitively written off and scrapped after suffering another crash-landing in Germany on 15 February 1997.Air pictorial: journal of the Air League, Volumen 59, p. 196, 1997 The downing of two helicopters by mortar fire, along with the increasing sniper activity of the IRA, was both a morale and military blow to the British forces in south County Armagh.Harnden, p. 399  See also  * Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1990‚Äì99)  Notes  References  * English, Richard and Oppenheimer, A.

It was located on the northeast corner of North Kingshighway and West Pine boulevards. Built in 1904 to accommodate World's Fair visitors, it was subsequently known as the Ambassador Hotel, which was gutted by fire in 1971 and razed in 1973. Architecture The building was a U-shaped hotel, seven stories high, with bay windows around the wings. The hotel and annex originally offered 450 rooms, 300 of which had baths. History Over the years, the hotel was popular with baseball players, commonly providing accommodation for visiting players and as a hang out for drinking and socialising. It was at the hotel's bar that the Major League Baseball career of Larry McLean ended during a drunken encounter with his manager, John McGraw. After the St. Louis Society of the Archaeological Institute of America was founded on February 8, 1906, the organizational meetings and many early lectures were held at the hotel. It also hosted meetings of the American Philological Association. In addition, it was a meeting place for other societies, conventions and demonstrations, from a Violinist's Guild's Convention in June 1912 to art galleries and weddings. On January 4, 1917, notorious hotel master thief Ernest Le Ford was arrested at the Buckingham Hotel after successfully robbing over $50,000 (US$ in dollars) worth of jewels from lavish hotels in New York City.The New York Times, 4 January 1917 Renovated hotel building It was common for guests to live permanently at the hotel, including the hotel's president, Walter James Holbrook. Capitalist Ellis Wainwright died in the hotel in 1924, after living there as a recluse. After 1920, the hotel faced stiff competition from the Chase Hotel, just a block north, and declined in significance. In December 1927, a fire in the hotel's annex led to the death of seven people. The Buckingham Realty Company, which operated the hotel, fell into bankruptcy in 1928, and it sealed the fate of the Buckingham Hotel; the intermingled accounts of the Buckingham Hotel Property and the Buckingham Annex constituted part of the problem. Eventually acquired by the Royale Investment Company, the hotel was sold to attorney Morris Shenker in 1965. It was known as the Ambassador for many years until it was demolished in 1973, after a devastating fire two years earlier.

The first PrepCom occurred from July 12 to July 23, 2010 at the United Nations in New York City. The second PrepCom occurred from February 28 to March 4, 2011 also in New York City. A third meeting is scheduled for July, 2011. The preparatory committees were designed to prepare member states, international organizations and non- governmental organizations for the Arms Trade Treaty negotiation in 2012. The Preparatory Committees are intended to prepare delegates and non-governmental organizations for the eventual Arms Trade Treaty negotiations, and is concerned with logistical, procedural and thematic issues.  History  Countries in the United Nations have long been concerned about the lack of a global normative framework for guiding and governing international arms transfers. After years of international campaigning from individuals and states, the United Nations General Assembly voted in 2006 to negotiate an Arms Trade Treaty in 2012. When delegates of the United Nations decided that they would negotiate an Arms Trade Treaty in 2012, there emerged a sentiment to host a series of preparatory conferences for member states and civil society to arrange and organize the eventual negotiations. In order to do this, four preparatory committees (or ‚ÄúPrepComs‚Äù) were scheduled. The first PrepCom occurred from July 12 to July 23 in 2010 at the United Nations in New York City. The 2010 PrepCom featured an opening statement from the high representative for disarmament affairs. The eventual outcomes of the 2010 PrepCom were the establishment of an outline for a draft Treaty, draft preamble, draft goals and objectives and three papers from the Friends of the Chair on scope, parameters and implementation of the eventual Arms Trade Treaty. The third preparatory Committee will take place in July, 2011. In addition to the four Preparatory Committees, a Group of Governmental Experts was assembled to debate and discuss potential challenges facing an Arms Trade Treaty.  Participants  The second PrepCom was attended by member states of the United Nations, non-governmental organizations, and international organizations. These participants were tasked with addressing the potential scope and parameters for an Arms Trade Treaty. The PrepCom conference was held in the United Nations Building in New York City.  Preparatory Documents  The second PrepCom issued two definitive preparatory documents prior to the opening of the conference. Both a Provisional Agenda and a Provisional Programme of Work were issued and disseminated to PrepCom participants. These documents outlined the logistical timeline for the conference.  Statements and Outcomes  The second PrepCom had several key issues that it was tasked to address. Scope, criteria and parameters, and international cooperation and assistance were all given a full day of statements. The international organization Control Arms Coalition made a presentation. The chair, Roberto Garc√≠a Morit√°n, issued three papers on scope, criteria and parameters, and international cooperation and assistance; the chair also issued a draft paper.

It is adjacent to the Mechanics Bank Arena. History The Civic Auditorium was originally constructed in 1962, to attract the convention trade to the city. The first show at the auditorium was the Ice Capades, which was on November 20, 1962.Bailey, Richard. Heart of the Golden Empire. Windsor Publications, Inc. Woodland Hills, California: 1984. .

Encino, California: 1997. . Page 82-83. In addition to housing the communities‚Äô musical groups, such as the Bakersfield Symphony, it also contained a scenery loft and an orchestra pit, to facilitate Broadway musicals and ballets. By 1976, Bakersfield began plans for the facilities' first major expansion. The plan would include construction of a convention center, which would be intertwined with the existing theater. It would also include the construction of a hotel directly adjacent and connected to the theater. The convention center was completed in 1980, but budget problems would delay the hotel until 1993. The name was also changed to the Bakersfield Convention Center. In 1998, the facility was again modified. The parking lot, located east of the facility, was removed for the construction of the 10,000-seat sports arena. The combined complex was renamed the Centennial Garden and Convention Center. Incorporated in the design of the sports complex was a connection to the exhibit hall. This unique feature allows for the convention center to be used as a staging ground or warm-up facility for events being held in the arena. The entire complex was renamed seven years later, when the city signed a 10-year agreement with Rabobank, to name the complex the Rabobank Arena, Theater and Convention Center. Following the acquisition of Rabobank, N.A. by Mechanics Bank, the naming rights transferred to Mechanics Bank.

The species is solely known from the late Eocene, Chadronian stage, Florissant Formation deposits in Florissant, Colorado, USA. Anthidium scudderi is one of only four extinct species of mason bees known from the fossil record, and with Anthidium exhumatum, one of two species from the Florissant Formation. History and classification The species is known only a single fossil, the holotype, number \\"No. 2002\\", is a single specimen of indeterminate genus, originally part of the Samuel Hubbard Scudder collection as specimen \\"No. 11381\\". The additional specimen, along with the three A. exhumatum fossils are currently residing in the Museum of Comparative Zoology paleoentomology collections at Harvard University. A. scudderi was first studied by Theodore Cockerell with his 1906 type description being published in the journal Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology. The specific epithet \\"scudderi\\" was coined by Theodore Cockerell in honor of Samuel Scudder who collected the specimens at Florissant. Description The holotype of Anthidium scudderi, while incomplete, is approximately in length but is missing up to of the abdomen tip. The body length and width is noted to probably be larger than in life due to crushing during fossilization. Both the head and thorax are black with possible light patterning, with a large lighter patch on the vertex, the clypeus mostly light, and the mesothorax with two possible light stripes. Though not definitive the light stripes may have been a reddish. The abdomen in contrast is light in tone, possibly yellow in life, with the posterior edges of each segment darkening into a distinct stripe. There are indications of a possible subbasal band running along the abdomen in the subdorsal region. Due to preservation the antennae and legs are not visible in the specimen. The general coloration is similar to the modern Anthidium bernardinum, now a jr synonym of Anthidium placitum. The dark colored forewings of A. scudderi are in length and notably hairy in the basal region. The marginal cell of the wing is larger than in the related Anthidium exhumatum. Given the overall coloration and structure of the wings, both A. scudderi and A. exhumatum have been placed in the genus Anthidium.

While the Agronomy; Horticulture; Animal Husbandry; Industrial Arts and Drawing; and Bacteriology programs all came from the College of Applied Science the Botany; and Zoology and Entomology programs came from the College of Arts and Sciences. Thomas L. Martin was the first dean of the College of Biology and Agriculture.

Horticulture had also been formed as a department in 1920. In 1936 the Department of Landscape Architecture was formed which merged with Horticulture to form the Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture in 1942. In 1955 the same was shortened to just Horticulture which stayed as the name until the merger with the agronomy department. The Animal Husbandry Department was organized in 1920 as well.

She was a French teacher from 1966 to 1976. Tr√©panier became a political attach√© to legislator Jean-Pierre Saintonge in 1981. She was chosen as vice-president of the Quebec Liberal Party the following year and served in this capacity until 1985. Legislator and cabinet minister ;Bourassa government Tr√©panier was elected to the Quebec legislature in the 1985 provincial election, defeating Parti Qu√©b√©cois (PQ) incumbent Huguette Lachapelle in the Montreal division of Dorion. The Liberal Party won a majority government in this election, and Tr√©panier entered the legislature as a backbench supporter of Robert Bourassa's administration. From December 13, 1985, to March 3, 1989, she was the parliamentary assistant to the minister of municipal affairs. She was promoted to the provincial ministry on March 3, 1989, serving as the junior minister responsible for cultural communities and immigration.Benoit Aubin, \\"Ryan gets tough language post in Quebec's cabinet shuffle,\\" Globe and Mail, 4 March 1989, A8. She assisted Monique Gagnon-Tremblay, who held the full cabinet portfolio for these files.Don McPherson, \\"Cabinet shuffle makes a joke of war on pollution,\\" Montreal Gazette, 7 March 1989, B3. Tr√©panier was re- elected over PQ candidate Joseph Facal in the 1989 provincial election and was reassigned as the minister responsible for the status of women and minister responsible for the family on October 11, 1989. During ceremonies marking the fiftieth anniversary of women's suffrage in Quebec in April 1990, Tr√©panier said that the greatest challenge of modern Quebec women was to create a society where family and work were compatible. \\"What women need is day care, flexible work schedules, maternity leave, pay equity and a lot of vigilance because the gains we have made are very fragile,\\" she said.Andre Picard, \\"Celebration of Quebec suffrage marred by women's infighting,\\" Globe and Mail, 26 April 1990, A10. Later in the same year, she introduced a bill allowing parents to take thirty-four weeks of unpaid parental leave after the birth or adoption of a child; she described the bill as the first step toward paid parental leave.Rheal Seguin, \\"Parental leave extended,\\" Globe and Mail, 15 November 1990, A11. She also ensured passage of a bill requiring that all divorcing couples in Quebec equally split the value of most shared assets developed during their relationship.\\"Quebec makes divorcing couples share,\\" Globe and Mail, 27 December 1990, A8. Tr√©panier criticized the federal government of Brian Mulroney for cutting universal child care benefits and cancelling funding targeted to day care.Patricia Poirier, \\"Quebec raps Ottawa in family feud,\\" Globe and Mail, 14 April 1992, A7. She introduced legislation in April 1992 to guarantee mandatory child support payments in the event of a separation or divorce, create 7,500 new day care spaces in three years, and set aside $1.8 million for pilot projects to enhance family life. She also re- affirmed her support for Quebec's universal family allowance policy, intended to encourage couples to have more children, which was introduced shortly before she was appointed to cabinet.Rheal Seguin, \\"Quebec to pay child support,\\" Globe and Mail, 14 April 1992, A7. In late 1993, she introduced a new government policy document on women that proposed an employment equity law for all public sector and some private sector organizations with over one hundred employees. Some provincial groups representing women criticized the document as being for the most part vague and unspecific.Don Macdonald, \\"Groups assail Quebec's new policy on women,\\" Ottawa Citizen, 24 September 1993, A12. Tr√©panier was the minister responsible for the status women at the time of the √âcole Polytechnique massacre, in which lone gunman Marc Lepine shot and murdered fourteen women at the √âcole Polytechnique de Montr√©al. In common with other female members of Bourassa's cabinet, Tr√©panier cautioned against interpreting the massacre as anything other than the act of a single psychopathic individual.Robert McKenzie, \\"Ontario, Quebec see massacre differently,\\" Toronto Star, 12 December 1989, A21. ;Johnson government Tr√©panier supported Daniel Johnson's successful bid to succeed Robert Bourassa as leader of the Quebec Liberal Party and premier of Quebec in January 1994.\\"Bourassa's deputy won't seek top job,\\" Toronto Star, 30 September 1993, A17. When Johnson became premier on January 11, 1994, he appointed Tr√©panier to a full cabinet position as minister of revenue security. She also retained ministerial responsibility for the status of women and the family. In March 1994, Tr√©panier and employment minister Serge Marcil announced a $17.2 million program to assist persons on social assistance in starting up small businesses. Critics charged that it would be ineffective as it required recipients to provide two thousand dollars in cash or goods toward their project; some argued this was an unrealistic sum.Dorothy Guinan, \\"$17 million allotted to help poor start businesses,\\" Montreal Gazette, 23 March 1994, A6. Tr√©panier later announced the expansion of a program that encouraged social assistance recipients to accept temporary jobs for non-profit organizations.Elizabeth Thompson, \\"Quebec expands welfare-work program,\\" Montreal Gazette, 27 May 1994, A5. Tr√©panier also announced in March 1994 that Quebec would increase its monthly breastfeeding subsidy from $15 to $37.50, while simultaneously reducing funds for milk formula, in an effort to encourage more low-income women to nurse their infants. This decision received international attention.Clyde H. Farnsworth, \\"Montreal Journal; Quebec Bets on Subsidized Milk, Mother's Kind,\\" New York Times, 5 April 1994, p. 4. Farnsworth's article was also covered in other American newspapers. She was not a candidate in the 1994 provincial election and formally resigned from cabinet on September 26, 1994.

Career Hering served six tours of duty in Vietnam and elsewhere in Southeast Asia. Hering received the Distinguished Flying Cross, Bronze Star Medal, and Air Medal with eight Oak leaf clusters for his work in Vietnam flying helicopters. =Discharge= Hering served in the Vietnam War as part of the Air Rescue Service. Twenty-one years into his Air Force career, while serving as a Minuteman missile crewman and expecting a promotion to lieutenant colonel, he posed the following question during training at Vandenberg Air Force Base in late 1973, at a time when Richard Nixon was president:Rosenbaum, Ron. How the End Begins: The Road to a Nuclear World War III. Simon & Schuster. . The Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) specifies that, when the National Command Authority (NCA) issues an order to use nuclear weapons, the order will filter down the chain of command. Per the SIOP, decision-making is the responsibility of the NCA, not of officers lower in the chain of command, who are responsible for executing NCA decisions. To ensure no opportunity for execution by a rogue operator, the two-man rule requires that at each stage, two operators independently verify and agree that the order is valid. In the case of the Minuteman missile, this is done by comparing the authorization code in the launch order against the code in the Sealed Authenticator, a special sealed envelope which holds the code; if both operators agree that the code matches, the launch must be executed. In 1978, journalist Ron Rosenbaum wrote a 15,000-word article in Harper's Magazine about the nuclear command and control system in which he publicized the case of Hering. Rosenbaum later wrote that Hering's question exposed a flaw in the very foundation of this doctrine, and asked \\"What if [the president's] mind is deranged, disordered, even damagingly intoxicated? ... Can he launch despite displaying symptoms of imbalance? Is there anything to stop him?\\" Rosenbaum says that the answer is that launch would indeed be possible: to this day, the nuclear fail-safe protocols for executing commands are entirely concerned with the president's identity, not his sanity. The President alone authorizes a nuclear launch and the two-man rule does not apply to him. Hering was pulled from training and, unable to receive a reply to his satisfaction, requested reassignment to different duties. Instead, the Air Force issued an administrative discharge for \\"failure to demonstrate acceptable qualities of leadership\\". Hering appealed the discharge, and at the Air Force Board of Inquiry, the Air Force stated that knowing whether or not a launch order is lawful is beyond the executing officer's need to know. Hering replied: The Board of Inquiry ruled that Hering be discharged from the Air Force.\\"Air Force Panel Recommends Discharge of Major Who Challenged 'Failsafe' System\\". New York Times, January 13, 1975, p.16. After his discharge, Hering became at first a long-haul trucker, and then a counselor.Fowler, Wendell (March 24, 2014) \\"Never too late, never too old\\" seniorlifenewspapers.com (archived link) =Media= Hering was profiled in the Radiolab episode \\"Nukes\\". In the episode he refuted the characterization by General Russell E. Dougherty of his statements. According to Dougherty, Hering's assertions that he would readily turn keys (to launch the nuclear missiles) if so ordered had always been qualified by subjective conditions expressing his own judgment of the validity of the order. Hering insisted, on the contrary, that he had always expressed a commitment to follow orders, but that if he was not informed about the checks and balances of presidential decision making that he assumed had to exist, he would do so with a conflicted conscience. He said, \\"I think it's an affront to play the game if you don't have the 'need to know' for someone who's doing one of the most serious, grave jobs that there is in the armed forces.\\" References 1936 births Living people American air force personnel of the Vietnam War United States Air Force officers ","title":"Harold Hering"},{"id":"31298112","text":"5-Ethoxy-DMT (5-ethoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 5-EtO-DMT, O-ethylbufotenine) is a tryptamine derivative which has been previously synthesized as a chemical intermediate, but has not been studied to determine its pharmacology.TIHKAL #19 The widespread recreational use of N,N-dialkylated 5-methoxytryptamine derivatives including 5-MeO-DMT, 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT has led to concern that the 5-ethoxy homologs of these drugs could emerge as novel designer drugs, and consequently 5-EtO-DMT and other derivatives including 5-EtO-DET, 5-EtO-DPT, 5-EtO-DiPT, 5-EtO-DALT, 5-EtO-MPT, 5-EtO-MiPT, 5-EtO-EiPT, 5-EtO- MET and 5-EtO-EPT have been synthesized as analytical standards in order to facilitate future research into these compounds.

Her brother was Bogislaw X (1454-1523), who ruled the country for almost fifty years as a unified territory. Under Bogislaw X, Pomerania experienced a golden age: Szczecin was made the residence in 1491, the ducal administration was organised in a chancery, a well-regulated tax collection was introduced and peace and stability were maintained. For political reasons, the Duchy of Mecklenburg was anxious to see a merger with the House of Pomerania. Marriage and issue Sophie of Pomerania was the fianc√©e of John V, Duke of Mecklenburg, the brother of her later husband Magnus II of Mecklenburg. After John's death, Sophie went into a convent, and vowed perpetual chastity. But Magnus II was very attached to securing the border with Pomerania and therefore interested in a marriage with Sophie. He asked several priests for advice on how to set aside the vow, but this was in vain. He married Sophie on 29 May 1478 anyway, against the ecclesiastical laws. The pope did not sentence Magnus for this transgression; instead he awarded him the Golden Rose of Virtue, the highest ecclesiastical honors. On 3 April 1486 Sophie finally got dispensation from her vow, on the condition she provide three poor people annually with white woolen clothes in memory of the Virgin Mary. * Henry V, the Peaceable, (1479‚Äì1552), Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin; married three times. Firstly, on 12 December 1505, he married Ursula of Brandenburg, with whom he had issue. He married secondly, on 12 June 1513, Helen of the Palatinate, with whom he also had issue. Finally, he married Ursula of Saxe-Lauenburg, with whom he had no issue. * Dorothea of Mecklenburg (21 October 1480 ‚Äì 1 September 1537 in Ribnitz), Abbess in the Ribnitz monastery from 24 February 1498. * Sophie, (18 December 1481 ‚Äì 12 July 1503 in Torgau); married, on 1 March 1500, John the Steadfast of Saxony and had issue. * Eric II, (1483‚Äì1508), Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin * Anna of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, (1485‚Äì1525), Landgravine of Hesse; married firstly, on 20 October 1500, William II, Landgrave of Hesse, and had issue. Married secondly, on 7 September 1519, Otto of Solms-Laubach and had issue. * Catherine of Mecklenburg, (1487‚Äì1561), Duchess of Saxony; married, on 6 July 1512, Henry IV, Duke of Saxony, and had issue. * Albert VII, the Handsome (1486‚Äì1547), Duke of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow; married, on 17 January 1524, Anna of Brandenburg and had issue. Death Like her daughter Anna of Mecklenburg-Schwerin over two decades later, Sophie insisted on being buried far from home. Whereas all her relatives on the Mecklenburg side, including her husband, had been buried in Doberan Abbey, she chose the Dominican monastery in Wismar as the final resting place. Sophie's funeral was the first of the ducal house in Wismar and - apart from her sister Margaret, the widow of Balthasar, on 27 March 1526 - also the last. The bronze grave slab with the life-sized image of the Duchess resting on a Pomegranate blanket, first covered her tomb at the main altar of the church of the Black Monastery in Wismar until 1880. It was then moved to St. Mary's Church, also in Wismar, and after its destruction to the northern side chapel of the Nikolai Church, also in Wismar.

Aleksa Kastrioti controlled three villages.  Title  According to du Cange and some other authors, Konstantin was a vassal of Serbian despot Stefan Lazareviƒá appointed to position of Lord of Mat and Kastoria before he died in 1390. Some authors, including Du Cange and Philippe Labbe, emphasized that Konstantin Kastrioti had additional surname - Mazarek (). Jakob Philipp Fallmerayer referred to his second surname as Serbian. According to Venetian document discovered by Karl Hopf his title was Lord of Cer√ºja castle (). Hopf referred to Konstantin Kastrioti as protovestiar of Sina (Serina) near Durrazo. During Skanderbeg's Italian expedition at the age of twenty-two or twenty-three he was sent to Italy to command a contingent of troops in order to help Ferdinand I of Naples maintain his rule against the Angevins and their allies. Since Skanderbeg was busy with internal affairs in Albania, Constantine played a leading role in the Albanian expedition before his uncle's arrival. He served under Ferdinand who had been trying to regain his territory after it had been overrun by the Angevins and their supporters. Along with Constantine's cavalry, Francesco del Balzo, the Duke of Andria who had remained loyal to Ferdinand, managed to defeat Ercole d'Este, one of the pro-Angevin nobles in Gargano. From Gargano, they were then able to collect customs-duties of 30,000 ducats.

Along with other particle physics accelerators, scientists had been using the Synchrotron radiation produced by NINA for its unique properties. By 1975 over 50 scientists with affiliations to more than 16 institutions were at work on NINA exploiting this by product of the particle accelerator.

Singles from the album included \\"Sar Kiye Yeh Pahar\\" and \\"Aaj Mein Khud He Se\\". Release In 1992, the band came up with a follow-up album titled 2, released by Shalimar Recording Company. Maqsood realising that the band needed more exposure, advised that a music video to be shot. He himself took charge of the direction of the video for the song, \\"Sar Kiye Yeh Pahar\\", and handed it to the STN to be aired on their show. The video was played for a minute on the channel in their hour-long show and with not many new videos from competing artists, Maqsood's directorial d√©but was an instant success. This decision proved beneficial and \\"Sar Kiye Yeh Pahar\\" became a nationwide hit overnight. In its most primitive form, the video and the song created a phenomenon in the local music industry and the band scored hits after another, played shows and enjoyed the lifestyle of the post-80s pop stars. The hype was short-lived as the quartet decided to disband considering it as a mutual decision amongst all the members. Soon afterwards, as the band disappeared from the local pop music scene their video of \\"Sar Kiye Yeh Pahar\\" aired on MTV Asia and led the band to achieve success and worldwide fame. After disbanding, Maqsood joined an art school and later got himself a job in an advertising agency as the creative director, while Kapadia travelled to the Houston, Texas to continue his business studies.

He raised his family in this area which ultimately came to be known as Saldi. Approximately 200 years or seven generations following the founding of Saldi village, one of the cows of a herder named Petha Patel was found to be regularly offering her milk over one location under a Pimpal tree where the JALADHARI was ultimately found. In the Hindu tradition, worshipers of Shiva pay homage to the Shivling by pouring milk over a Shivling. Thus, the cow's offering of her milk at this site without any assistance, led to the people of Saldi to attribute this phenomenon to the presence of swayambhu Lord Shiva. Since then, the current site of Pimpleshwar Mahadev is considered to be very sacred by the pilgrims and villagers alike, and it has become famous throughout the state of Gujarat over the years. The first temple or shrine was put in place by Petha Patel of Saldi at this site dating back Hindu Year Sanvat 1143 ( approximately 924 years ago).

It runs along Four Mile Run from Benjamin Banneker Park in Falls Church to the Mount Vernon Trail near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where Four Mile Run empties into the Potomac River. The trail runs roughly parallel to parts of the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Trail as it follows Four Mile Run, sometimes on the other side of the stream.  History  The trail opened on September 4, 1967 as a four-mile, unpaved trail between Roosevelt Street and the Columbia Pike. In 1966, Arlington County was one of 12 urban areas to receive a grant from the Department of the Interior as a demonstration of urban trails, the first such grants ever given. The Four Mile Run Trail was the first of these trails built, making it the nation's first shared use path built with federal funds. Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall had created the program in hopes that it would build support for trails legislation he was supporting. That legislation later became the National Trail System Act of 1968. The trail was built adjacent to an existing hiking trail and the still extant W&OD; railroad tracks. In the following years, the trail was paved and expanded. By 1971, most sections of the trail were paved, but it still had many low-water crossings and cinder-surfaced sections. By 1977, the trail had been expanded south to I-95, where it crossed I-95 on the Shirlington Overpass which had been opened in 1972, and west of Broad Street in Falls Church (along the Washington & Old Dominion (W&OD;) right-of-way). By 1980 it went as far as Route 1. In 1980, as part of construction of seven bridges across Four Mile Run - Potomac Yard railroad bridges, Route 1 and the George Washington Parkway, the Army Corps of Engineers built an extension of the Four Mile Run Trail beneath them that connected the trail to the Mount Vernon Trail. Later that spring, more new sections of the trail opened, connecting it to the W&OD; Trail via the Shirlington Overpass. The work between the W&OD; trail and the Mt. Vernon trail was to include an underpass beneath I-95, but that wouldn't be completed for nearly 30 years. In 2009, a trail extension was completed near Shirlington that not only linked the end of the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad Trail with the Four Mile Run Trail, but also allowed trail users to pass under the Shirley Highway (Interstate 395) and West Glebe Road without having to ride on-street in Shirlington and Alexandria. A trail crossing had been promised at this location during construction of I-395 in the early 1970s.

It is one of the few independent groups in Saudi Arabia monitoring human rights,Saudi Arabia: Briefing on the Current Status of Human Rights and Reform, October 4, 2006 along with the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association, the Society for Development and Change and the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia. The HRFS was initiated as an organisation dedicated to protecting and defending human rights in Saudi Arabia according to Islamic teachings. The HRFS stands for applying the rule of law, freedoms of expression and association, and abolishing all discrimination in Saudi society on the basis of gender or religious beliefs. Founding and status In 2002, the Human Rights First Society (HRFS) was created and led by Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb whom applied to the Saudi government for legal recognition of the group. However, the application was denied. Although the HRFS was not granted governmental status, , it remained unrecognised, but was allowed by the government to exist informally. The Saudi Basic Law does not address freedom of association, and the government strictly limited this right in practice. The government prohibited the establishment of political parties or any group it considered as opposing the regime or challenging the King‚Äôs authority. All associations must therefore be licensed and comply with its rules and regulations. The HRFS have had no response to their request for a governmental license, however, they have continued to pursue their purpose. As the group is formally 'unlicensed', it remains unclear which group activities are permitted and which could draw punishment from the government. Furthermore, without a license the group may not raise any operating funds which consequently limits its activities. Despite this, now in 2016, the HRFS continues to operate independently as a non-government organisation and is still recognised by governmental organisations. Aims The aim of the HRFS is to ultimately defend and protect against human rights violations in Saudi Arabia. The HRFS believes in freedom of expression and association, as well as condemning all discrimination against gender or religious beliefs in Saudi Arabian society. The Human Rights First Society aims to monitor human rights violations and support victims of human rights violations, using \\"all peaceful means to advocate that the Saudi government respects and defends all human rights.\\" In fulfilling the role of the HRFS to protect the freedom of expression and association as well as condemning discrimination, the HRFS may release reports to Saudi officials as a recommendation. The reports essentially serve as a ‚Äòroad map‚Äô as to whether certain laws in Saudi are in violation of international human rights conventions or treaties, or that these laws, when they exist, are not respected by the Saudi authorities.\\"Unholy Trespass: How the Saudi Legal Code Violates International Law\\" Human Rights First Society - Saudi Arabia 2010 As well as making recommendations to officials, the HRFS may also welcome measures by government officials to create more accepted laws. Structure and leadership , Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb is the head of HRFS. al- Mugaiteeb is a leading human rights activist and the founder and president of the Human Rights First Society (Saudi Arabia). Despite being previously imprisoned for political activism and barred from travel, al-Mugaiteeb continues to condemn human rights abuses and speak out against discrimination. Although al-Mugaiteeb was denied a licence permitting his organisation to function as a government organisation, he continues to operate the HRFS in the Kingdom at his own risk and has done so since the introduction of the HRFS in 2002. =The Basic Law for Governing the Kingdom= The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Fahd Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud issued a Royal Decree embodying the Basic Law of Governance for Saudi Arabia. After taking into consideration the interests of the public and with a view to progress the State, the ‚ÄòBasic Law of Governance‚Äô came into force on 1 March 1992. The Basic Law of Governance is a constitution-like charter in accordance with the Salafi understanding of Sharia and does not override Islamic laws. Article 26 of the Basic Law of Governance holds that \\"The State shall protect human rights in accordance with the Sharia\\". Sharia is the religious legal system governing the members of the Islamic faith. This article is relevant for the purposes of the HRFS in which it will use all peaceful means to advocate that the Saudi government respects this article in situations where human rights violations may become evident. Statements and reports=Elections= The 2005 municipal elections were the first to be held in Saudi Arabia since the 1960s. In the elections, male citizens over the age of 21 were able to vote for half of the members of their municipal councils. On 11 October 2004, Prince Nayef bin Abd al-Aziz, the Saudi interior minister, announced to a Kuwaiti newspaper that women will not be able to run as candidates or vote in the elections. In response to this admission, Saudi election officials gave logistical concerns for this reasoning such as the lack of separate voting booths for women, and the fact women did not have identification cards. Hatoon al-Fassi felt that the fact the officials gave practical reasons for this non-participation rather than religious or gender reasons was a success for women's campaigning HRFS' head, Ibrahim al-Mugaiteeb, stated that the 2011 Saudi Arabian municipal elections would \\"be of very little significance\\" if they were held in a similar way to the 2005 municipal elections in that women would not be allowed to participate. He said that the minimum criteria for the elections should include all members being elected by the voters, women should participate, and the voting age should be decreased from 21 to 18\\". =2011 Saudi Arabian protests= Many protests over human rights took place in front of government ministry buildings in Saudi Arabia throughout 2011 and into 2012. Anti- government protests demanding release of prisoners held without charge or trial continued in various cities and protests demanding the Eastern province to have a constitution and legislature. Throughout the duration of the protests, a number of protesters were shot dead by Saudi authorities following chants aimed against the House of Saud and Minister of Interior, Nayef, calling them \\"terrorists\\", \\"butchers\\" and \\"criminal. On 24 March 2011, during the 2011 Saudi Arabian protests, HRFS said that 100 protestors remained under arrest following the 15‚Äì18 March protests in and near Qatif and that some had been tortured. Alongside the HRFS, the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) called for the ACPRA co-founder Mohammed Saleh al-Bejadi to be released following his arbitrary arrest in Buraidah on 21 March by the Internal Security Agency. The protests continued calling for the release of these prisoners, for the Peninsula Shield Force to be withdrawn from Bahrain, for equal representation in key offices and for reforms in political positions, as they feel marginalised. =Unholy Trespass Report= In working toward promoting and defending the rule of law, protecting freedoms of expression and association, and abolishing discrimination in Saudi society, the HRFS has compiled a report on the rule of law in Saudi Arabia and its impact on the freedoms of the Saudi people titled \\"Unholy Trespass: How the Saudi Legal Code Violates International Human Rights\\" (The Report). The report holds that many of the unwritten laws in Saudi Arabia are \\"enormously regressive\\" and \\"ultimately lethal\\" to human rights. A nation state has a legal obligation to abide by and to enact legislation cogent with the treaties it has ratified. Furthermore, pursuant to the law of treaties, a State that has signed but not ratified a treaty is obliged to refrain from \\"acts which would defeat the object and purpose\\" of that treaty. The report details the areas in which the Saudi Legal Code is a violation of Human Rights Law including: Surveillance and invasion of homes, criminalization of free speech and association, arbitrary arrest and prolonged detention, secretive and unfair trial proceedings, torture and capital punishment and denying women equal legal rights The report then discusses how those laws give the Saudi government broad powers to abuse the human rights of Saudi citizens, with particular attention given to the vulnerability of women, religious minorities, migrant workers and children Finally, the report demonstrates where the Saudi government fails to adhere to its own domestic laws in the practice of its treatment of Saudi citizens, violating human rights which it has itself professed to protect in its own law and which is protected under international law.

At his own request, he lived at an asylum there from May 1889 through May 1890 painting the gardens of the asylum and, when he had permission to venture outside its walls, nearby olive trees, cypresses and wheat fields. One painting, Olive Trees in a Mountainous Landscape, was a complement to The Starry Night. The olive tree paintings had special significance for van Gogh. A group in May 1889 represented life, the divine and the cycle of life while those from November 1889 arose out of his attempt to symbolize his feelings about Christ in Gethsemane. His paintings of olive pickers demonstrate the relationship between man and nature by depicting one of the cycles of life, harvesting or death. It is also an example of how individuals, through interaction with nature, can connect with the divine. Van Gogh found respite and relief in interaction with nature. When the series of olive tree paintings was made in 1889 he was subject to illness and emotional turmoil, yet the paintings are considered to be among his finest works. Saint-R√©my View of the Asylum and Chapel at Saint Remy, 1889 Collection of Elizabeth Taylor (F803) In May 1889, Van Gogh voluntarily entered the asylum of St. Paul near Saint-R√©my in Provence. There he had access to an adjacent cell he used as his studio. He was initially confined to the immediate asylum grounds and painted (without the window bars) the world he saw from his room, such as ivy covered trees, lilacs, and irises in the garden. As he ventured outside of the asylum walls, he painted the wheat fields, olive groves, and cypress trees in the surrounding countryside, which he saw as \\"characteristic of Provence.\\" Over the course of the year, he painted about 150 canvases. The imposed regimen of asylum life gave van Gogh a hard-won stability: \\"I feel happier here with my work than I could be outside. By staying here a good long time, I shall have learned regular habits and in the long run the result will be more order in my life.\\" While his time at Saint-R√©my forced him to manage his vices, such as coffee, alcohol, poor eating habits and periodic attempts to consume turpentine and paint, his stay was not ideal. He needed to obtain permission to leave the asylum grounds. The food was poor; he generally ate only bread and soup. His only apparent form of treatment were two-hour baths twice a week. During his year there, van Gogh had periodic attacks, possibly due to a form of epilepsy. By early 1890, when the attacks worsened, he concluded that his stay at the asylum was not helping him to recover, which led him to move to Auvers-sur-Oise just north of Paris in May 1890. Olive trees as a subject Painting the countryside, the surrounding fields, cypress trees and olive trees restored van Gogh's connection to nature through art. He completed at least 15 paintings in 1889 of \\"venerable, gnarled olive trees,\\" pervasive throughout southern France, of which he wrote: Olive Trees in Provence, France > The effect of daylight and the sky means there are endless subjects to be > found in olive trees. For myself I look for the contrasting effects in the > foliage, which changes with the tones of the sky. At times, when the tree > bares its pale blossoms and big blue flies, emerald fruit beetles and > cicadas in great numbers fly about, everything is immersed in pure blue. > Then, as the bronzer foliage takes on more mature tones, the sky is radiant > and streaked with green and orange, and then again, further into autumn, the > leaves take on violet tones something of the color of a ripe fig, and this > violet effect manifests itself most fully with the contrast of the large, > whitening sun within its pale halo of light lemon. Sometimes, too, after a > shower I've seen the whole sky pink and orange, which gave an exquisite > value and coloring to the silvery gray-greens. And among all this were > women, also pink, who were gathering the fruit. He found olive trees, representative of Provence, both \\"demanding and compelling.\\" He wrote to his brother Theo that he was \\"struggling to catch (the olive trees). They are old silver, sometimes with more blue in them, sometimes greenish, bronzed, fading white above a soil which is yellow, pink, violet tinted orange... very difficult.\\" He found that the \\"rustle of the olive grove has something very secret in it, and immensely old. It is too beautiful for us to dare to paint it or to be able to imagine it.\\" Spiritual significance As a young man, van Gogh considered pursuing ministry to serve working people. He studied for a time in the Netherlands but his zeal and self-imposed asceticism cost him a short-term position in lay ministry. He became somewhat embittered and rejected the church establishment, yet found a personal spirituality that was comforting and important to him. By 1879, he made a shift in the direction of his life and found he could express his \\"love of God and man\\" through painting. Van Gogh painted nature, the major subject for his works in the last 29 months of his life, to bring relief from his illnesses and emotional distress. Prior to this period he had rejected what he perceived as the narrow religion of his parents, and took an almost nihilistic stance, not unlike Nietzsche's, toward religion and God. It was among the blossoming trees, the olive orchards and fields that van Gogh most often found \\"profound meaning\\", because he saw in their cycles an analogy to human life. He wrote to Theo that death, happiness and unhappiness are \\"necessary and useful\\" and relative, declaring \\"Even faced with an illness that breaks me up and frightens me, that belief is unshaken.\\" Paul Gauguin, Christ in the Garden of Olives, 1889, Norton Museum of Art, West Palm Beach, Florida. Note the red hair of the Christ / Gauguin self-portrait, the color of which has been described as \\"supernaturally red\\", and directly evokes van Gogh.Margolis Maurer, Naomi. \\"The Pursuit of Spiritual Wisdom: Thought and Art of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin\\". Madison, NJ: Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1998. The autumn work was somewhat in reaction to the recent compositions of Christ in the Garden of Olives by his friends Paul Gauguin and √âmile Bernard. Frustrated by their work which he qualified with the words \\"nothing was observed\\", Van Gogh painted \\"in the groves, morning and evening during these clear, cold days, but in beautiful, bright sunshine\\" resulting in five canvases above the three he completed earlier in the year. He wrote to his brother, Theo, \\"What I have done is a rather hard and coarse reality beside their abstractions, but it will have a rustic quality and will smell of the earth.\\" Rather than attempting to recreate what the scene might have been like, he explained \\"one can express anguish without making reference to the actual Gethsemane, and... there is no need to portray figures from the Sermon on the Mount in order to express a gentle and comforting feeling.\\" He also commented: \\"I shall not paint a Christ in the Garden of Olives, but shall paint the olive harvest as one might see it today, and by giving the human figure its proper place in it, one might perhaps be reminded of it.\\"Silverman, Debora. Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Search for Sacred Art p.311 Retrieved May 9, 2011 Analysis=Artistic style= Van Gogh's early works were made with dull, gray colors. In Paris, he met leading French artists Edgar Degas, Georges Seurat and others who provided illuminating influences on the use of color and technique. His work, previously somber and dark, now \\"blazed with color.\\" Indeed, van Gogh's use of color became so dramatic that he was sometimes called an Expressionist. But it was southern France that provided an opportunity for him to express his \\"surging emotions.\\" Enlightened by the effects of its sun-drenched countryside, van Gogh reported that above all, his work \\"promises color\\". This is where he began development of his masterpieces. Van Gogh captured the colors and moods of the trees which varied dramatically by daylight and season. He began to use the color blue to represent the divine. In both The Starry Night and his olive tree paintings, van Gogh used the intense blue of the sky to symbolize the \\"divine and infinite presence\\" of Jesus. Seeking a \\"modern artistic language\\" to represent the divine, he sought a numinous quality in many of his olive tree paintings, such as by bathing olive trees, an emblem for Jesus, in \\"radiant gold light\\". Georges-Pierre Seurat, Bathers at Asni√®res, 1884, National Gallery, London, detail of water and grass. An example of use of Seurat's use of broken lines of color to bring light and form to paintings. Van Gogh used the Impressionist concept of broken color to give light to a work, innovatively drawing in color, giving the painting light and form, as he also did in his paintings of plowed fields, mountains, rocks, and heads and figures. The series is unified by a more refined approach, without the thick application of paint to which he was more accustomed. =Meaning= The National Gallery of Art summarizes this series: > In the olive trees ‚Äî in the expressive power of their ancient and gnarled > forms ‚Äî van Gogh found a manifestation of the spiritual force he believed > resided in all of nature. His brushstrokes make the soil and even the sky > seem alive with the same rustling motion as the leaves, stirred to a shimmer > by the Mediterranean wind. These strong individual dashes do not seem > painted so much as drawn onto the canvas with a heavily loaded brush. The > energy in their continuous rhythm communicates to us, in an almost physical > way, the living force that van Gogh found within the trees themselves, the > very spiritual force that he believed had shaped them. Skye Jethani, author of The Divine Commodity: Discovering a Faith Beyond Consumer Christianity, asserts that in many of his paintings, the olive tree series in particular, van Gogh conveys the redemptive quality of sorrow and that even in sorrow, there can be rejoicing. To quote van Gogh's sermon of 1876: > Sorrow is better than joy... for by the sadness of the countenance, the > heart is made better. Our nature is sorrowful, but for those who have learnt > and are learning to look at Jesus Christ, there will always be reason to > rejoice. It is a good word, that of St. Paul: as being sorrowful yet also > rejoicing. The paintings In his letters, van Gogh specified two groupings: three paintings made in June 1889 and five completed by late November 1889. There was also a painting in September, three olive picker paintings in December and a few others. Van Gogh made several drawings of olive trees when, as a precautionary safety measure, he did not have access to his paints. =Complement to The Starry Night= Of Olive Trees in a Mountainous Landscape in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), Vincent wrote his brother Theo: \\"I did a landscape with olive trees and also a new study of a starry sky,\\" calling this painting the daylight complement to the nocturnal, The Starry Night. His intention was to go beyond \\"the photographic and silly perfection of some painters\\" to an intensity born of color and linear rhythms. Within the painting, twisted green olive trees stand before the foothills of the Alps and underneath the sky with an \\"ectoplasmic\\" cloud. Later, when the pictures had dried, he sent both of them to Theo in Paris, noting: \\"The olive trees with the white cloud and the mountains behind, as well as the rise of the moon and the night effect, are exaggerations from the point of view of the general arrangement; the outlines are accentuated as in some old woodcuts.\\" =Olive pickers= Van Gogh painted three versions of women picking olives. The first (F654) he described as an on-the-spot study \\"in deeper tones from nature\\". The second painting (F655) is \\"the most resolved and stylized of the three,\\" intended for his sister and mother, is located at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The third, in the Chester Dale collection at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC (F656) he painted in his studio in December in a \\"very discreet color scheme\\". Although the subject of the painting is immediately clear, the first tree, like a stepping stone, leads the spectator into the scene. Here van Gogh was more concerned about emotional and spiritual reality than literal interpretation. The women harvest olives for sustenance. The way in which the trees seem to wrap around the women and the trees and the landscape are almost one, indicates an emotional bond and interdependence between nature and people. Another painting was made of olive pickers, this time a couple. Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum's Olive Grove with Two Olive Pickers (F587) was painted December, 1889. =Painted in May and June 1889= Van Gogh made four paintings in May and June 1889. The first, Couple Walking among Olive Trees in a Mountainous Landscape with Crescent Moon (F704) is located at the Museu de Arte de S√£o Paulo, S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Van Gogh identified three olive tree paintings made in June, the second month of his stay at the asylum. The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art's Olive Orchard (F715) was expressed by van Gogh in a letter of July 1889 as an orchard of olive trees with gray leaves, \\"their violet shadows lying on the sunny sand.\\" By contrast, the shadows accentuate the heat of the Proven√ßal sun. The \\"repetitive, rectangular brush strokes\\" convey an energy that heightens the emotional impact of this work. In November 2017, the remains of a dead grasshopper was discovered in the painting, presumed to have arrived already deceased while painting in the outdoors. Van Gogh Museum's Olive Trees: Bright Blue Sky (F709) of cool, blue daylight tones is similar to G√∂teborgs Museum of Art's Olive Grove, a study in warm autumn colors. The autumn toned painting met van Gogh's goal of achieving a \\"harsh and coarse\\" realism to his work. He presented the painting to his friend and doctor, Dr. Gachet, with whom he would be under care and supervision in Auvers-sur-Oise the following year. The Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum Olive Orchard (F585) was painted in June, 1889. =Painted in September, November and December 1889= The paintings made during this period were much the artistic result of van Gogh's reaction to the Gauguin and Bernard Gethsemane painting, as mentioned in the \\"Spiritual significance\\" section. The intense nature of National Gallery of Scotland's Olive Trees (F714) likely expresses Van Gogh's agitated state of mind when he completed this work, dramatic impact evidenced both through his brushstrokes and color use. Contrasting with his June olives with their blue-green color and coolness of tone, the vibrant oranges and yellows in Olive Trees with Yellow Sky and Sun (F710) evoke the fall season. Novelist Warren Keith Wright visited this painting at the Minneapolis Institute of Art over a 15-year period, transfixed by the painting, but unsure why. He came to realize that the fascination was that the painting represented two periods of time. The late-afternoon sun lies due west above the mountains. The shadows, though, slant from the left, or the southwest, where they would fall in autumn. Not only is the painting out of sync with time, it is also out of sync with the season. It \\"predicts its own future, reverts to its own past.\\" In November or December 1889 Van Gogh worked on Olive Orchard, MoMA (F708). Another painting from this time is Olive Grove: Orange Sky (F586) which resides at the G√∂teborgs Museum of Art, Gothenburg, Sweden. ReferencesBibliography * Du Quesne-van Gogh, E (1913).

Although Bowie had begun recording the album intending to feature new versions of some of his earliest pieces as well as three new songs, its sessions led him to Heathen (2002) and it was never released officially. Recording and production Bowie recorded the album Toy for release in 2001 or 2002. It was meant to feature some new songs and new versions of some of his lesser-known songs from the 1960s. Toy remains officially unreleased. In 2001, on his own site, Bowie participated on a virtual chat with fans and when one of them asked about the release of Toy, he replied: \\"I'm finding EMI/Virgin seem to have a lot of scheduling conflicts this year, which has put an awful lot on the back burner. Toy is finished and ready to go, and I will make an announcement as soon as I get a very real date. Meantime, I'm already started writing and recording for another album (untitled at the moment).

I shall be writing and recording throughout the summer, but daddyfying is really my priority at the moment.\\" Tony Visconti would later say that Bowie was 'hurt terribly' by the label's refusal to release Toy and as a result, Bowie left Virgin/EMI and announced in March 2002 that he had signed an agreement with Columbia Records to launch the new album Heathen via his own ISO label instead. Several of the Toy tracks were then released as single B-sides and Bowie announced his intention to \\"continue to release tracks as specials for CD singles so that not too much time goes on before they are available. Then, along with all the other tracks, gather them all up an release them as an album.\\" Pegg (2002): p. 310 Alternative versions \\"Liza Jane\\" was Bowie's debut single, released under the name Davie Jones with the King Bees. \\"You've Got a Habit of Leaving\\" was his third single, credited to Davy Jones but recorded with his then band the Lower Third. The original version of \\"Silly Boy Blue\\" appeared on Bowie's eponymous debut album, and several other versions of these songs were released during Bowie's early career including \\"I Dig Everything\\", \\"Baby Loves That Way\\", as collected on Early On (1964‚Äì1966), and \\"In the Heat of the Morning,\\" and \\"The London Boys\\", as collected on The Deram Anthology 1966‚Äì1968.

The song was written by the band's lead guitarist Ace Frehley and was released in 1974 on the band's eponymous debut album. The song is featured on many compilations released by the band. Live versions of the song were often extended for about two minutes due to Frehley's soloing. The song is considered one of the greatest drinking songs of all-time by many media sources. Guitar World listed \\"Cold Gin\\" as #7 on their list of greatest drinking songs. It is #14 on Liquor.com's list of top 15 drinking songs and it is ranked #32 of the 50 best drinking songs on TimeOut.com. Background \\"Cold Gin\\" is about a person suffering from poverty, loneliness, and alcoholism. However the song's meaning is widely misinterpreted to be about a struggling couple who uses alcohol to cope with a toxic relationship or about how cold gin affects the male sex drive, but thorough lyrical analysis shows this is not the case. Ace Frehley confirms what the song in about in his 2011 book No Regrets. Frehley said he wrote the song while he was in the subway. According to Frehley, the riff for the song was inspired by the song \\"Fire and Water\\" by English rock group Free.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wgm4B1idFxE Gene Simmons actually wrote the bridge, according to Frehley, though Simmons turned down a writing credit: \\"Back then, it was definitely more of a brotherhood. It didn't matter who got credit, the only thing that mattered was if the song was good\\".https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGrdZsZ5xJg The song was recorded in 1973 and was one of two songs from the band's debut album written by Frehley, the other being the album's instrumental, \\"Love Theme from KISS\\", which was written by the whole band. Although \\"Cold Gin\\" was never released as a single, it has remained a concert staple during the years. The studio version differs significantly from the demo version. In the demo, after the solo, Paul Stanley shouts \\"Whoa! Alright! C'mon!\\", but in the studio version, he shouts \\"Whoa yeah!\\". The second guitar solo was also cut and the outro was shortened. As Frehley was insecure about his singing ability, Simmons sang the song on the original studio version and in most live versions (despite the fact that Simmons is a teetotaler), although during the Alive/Worldwide Tour, Frehley would sing parts of the song. Frehley would provide the lead vocals when touring with his solo band. Live performances \\"Cold Gin\\" soon became a fan favorite, with the band performing it on subsequent tours (the song was also featured on Kiss's breakthrough album Alive!) but it would be dropped for the Love Gun Tour and the band did not play the song for three years, until the Unmasked Tour. The band once again dropped the song from the setlist for the Aerosmith/Kiss co-headlined Rocksimus Maximus Tour/World Domination Tour but returned it for the Kiss Alive/35 World Tour. Frehley performed \\"Cold Gin\\" during his solo tours, along with other Kiss songs. Appearances \\"Cold Gin\\" appeared on the following Kiss releases: *Kiss - original studio version *Alive! - live version of the song *The Originals - studio version *Double Platinum - studio version *Killers - studio version *Greatest Kiss - studio version *The Box Set - Alive! version *Gold - Alive! version *Kiss Chronicles: 3 Classic Albums - studio version *Kiss Alive! 1975‚Äì2000 - Alive! version - song was mistakenly credited to Stanley instead of Frehley *Kiss Alive 35 - live version *Ikons - studio version *Kiss Sonic Boom Over Europe - live version Covers *Chyme-Dyne's version appeared on the band's 1985 album Bad Luck With Fast Food *Death Angel covered the song on their 1988 album Frolic Through the Park. *Pantera and Skid Row performed the song together live while the bands were on tour in 1992.

Description A spider in a jar The up- island spider is said to be a dark brown spider with red eyes, sharing shape and markings with wolf spiders common in the United States. Its unusual feature is its size, by some reports spanning up to 8 inches with its legs splayed out. Some specimens are reported to be large and heavy enough to create audible footsteps in a quiet room. While capable of making strands of silk, evidently to aid mobility, the spider is not known to construct webs or nets. It hunts and pounces on prey like a wolf spider. Also, like a wolf spider, it carries its newly hatched young on its back. Habitat The up- island spider is known to inhabit only a small range above the narrow tidal isthmus that connects the northern and southern halves of the island of Islesboro, Maine. Islesboro residents believe that the center of the up-island spider population distribution is the area around a local church, leading to speculation that the spiders might have arrived on the island in a coffin. \\"Hearse house\\" spider is thought to be the oldest name for the spider because long ago they were found in the carriage houses where hearses were stored. There have been limited reports of sightings of these spiders down-island, but they appear to be smaller and not as common as those frequently seen up- island.

He was mainly associated with opera and vocal music. He also wrote a work on the leitmotifs in Richard Wagner's operas, and he was an authority on heraldry. Biography Aylmer Wilhelmy Buesst was born in 1883 in Melbourne, the son of William Augustus Buesst (1846‚Äì1935)The LaTrobe Journal, No. 80, Spring 2007 and Helen Violette Buesst (n√©e Pett). His brothers were Victor Augustine (1885-1960; a composer), and Tristan No√´l Marchand (1894-1982; a soldier, barrister and collector of Australiana). The Buesst family had migrated in the 1870s from Staffordshire in England, \\"buesst\\" being an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"stout\\". Nevertheless, his mother later pretended the name was German, and sometimes added an umlaut (B√ºesst) to make it appear so. He studied the violin in Melbourne, where he was celebrated as a prodigy. During the 1890s the visiting virtuoso Joseph Joachim noticed him, and took him to Breslau to study with him. He had further studies at the Breslau Conservatory, then with C√©sar Thomson in Brussels and August Wilhelmj in London. His music studies continued at the Leipzig Conservatory, including conducting studies with Arthur Nikisch. In 1911 he was invited to conduct the Hall√© Orchestra in Manchester, England. In 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, he was imprisoned in Strangeways Prison as an enemy alien in the belief that he was a German, since he spoke German fluently, had developed a German- sounding English accent from his years of study on the European continent, and had also adopted the umlaut when writing his surname. He enlisted the aid of a friend on the outside, Sir Gerald Woods Wollaston (a future Garter Principal King of Arms 1930-1944) in researching his ancestry, to prove that he was of purely English stock. Wollaston was able to secure his release after ten months. In the process, Wollaston had a Grant of Arms organised for Buesst. Ironically, due to his excellent German, Buesst (who had quickly dropped the umlaut) was then used in interrogating captured German officers and generally helping with translations throughout the remainder of the war. Despite being cleared of any German sympathies or family connections, he was not required anymore at the Hall√© due to the prevailing anti-German sentiment. He returned to Breslau, becoming Kapellmeister there. It was in Breslau that he became interested in heraldry himself, and started what would later become a vast collection of books and other material on European heraldry, including all the coats of arms of the Holy Roman Empire. His library was later donated to help found the collection of the Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies.Institute of Heraldic and Genealogical Studies Aylmer Buesst conducted the Moody-Manners Opera Company, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, then the Beecham Opera Company 1916-17 and 1919-20. He was a co-founder of the British National Opera Company (BNOC), which he conducted 1922-28. He married the soprano May Blyth in 1924.British National Opera Company His book Richard Wagner's The Nibelung's Ring: An Act By Act Guide to the Plot and Music was published in 1932, and had a second edition in 1952.Answers.com In 1933 he was appointed Assistant Music Director for the BBC until 1936.

This was the first complete opera recording ever made in England using the electric process.Presto Classical The principal singers were Heddle Nash, Justine Griffiths, Harold Williams, Buesst's wife May Blyth, and Marjorie Parry (then John Barbirolli's wife).

He is best known, however, for his tenures as the head football and men's basketball coach at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana. Prather coached the Demons' football team between 1913 and 1917, and again from 1919 through 1933. The 1918 season was canceled because of World War I. In 20 seasons as coach at NSU, Prather compiled an overall record of 80‚Äì55‚Äì15. Including his one season at SLII, his overall football record was 83‚Äì45‚Äì15. As the head basketball coach at NSU, Prather's tenure was very interrupted. He was the on-again, off-again coach seven different times. Basketball had not quite become as established as a sport as football in the United States, so he alternated many of the years with having no program at all. In his 35 total years as the school's coach, Prather accumulated an overall record of 473‚Äì169. He stepped down in 1950 to become Northwestern State University's president in 1951.

With Charles Bernstein, he founded PennSound in 2003; PennSound is a large archive of recordings of poets reading their own poetry. Filreis is also publisher of Jacket2 magazine and host of a monthly podcast series called \\"PoemTalk\\", a collaboration with the Poetry Foundation. Among his books are Stevens and the Actual World, Modernism from Right to Left, and Counter- revolution of the Word: The Conservative Attack on Modern Poetry, 1945-1960. Kelly Writers House In 1995, Filreis founded the Kelly Writers House, a non-profit, community organization dedicated to creative writing and the literary arts. The three-story cottage in the center of the University of Pennsylvania campus hosts a variety of programs and projects open to the public, including poetry readings, seminars, film screenings, lectures and art exhibits. Filreis also directs the Kelly Writers House Fellows Program, a program that brings different writers such as Edward Albee, Joan Didion and Art Spiegelman to the Writers House each year for interviews and readings that are broadcast live to a worldwide audience via webcast. Each year Filreis teaches a seminar in which students study the works of the visiting fellows. PennSound In 2003, Filreis and poet Charles Bernstein started PennSound, a website that serves as an archive of recordings of poets reading their own work. PennSound allows viewers of the site to listen to high quality MP3s of both individual poems and complete modern and historic readings from poets such as John Ashbery, Ezra Pound and Wallace Stevens. PennSound further aims to preserve recordings that could otherwise be at risk for deterioration if not converted from older recorded media. Teaching style In the late 1990s, Filreis became known as an experimenter in online learning. As a 2001 article in the Philadelphia Inquirer‚Äôs Sunday Magazine describes, students in Filreis‚Äôs classes prepare for discussions by using listservs and online social media to respond to videos, reading materials, and even cartoons compiled on websites Filreis creates for his classes. Filreis, who believes that real learning occurs through guided discussion and not through lectures, ‚Äúuses technology to free class time for discussion.‚Äù Since the early days of the internet Filreis has also managed three thematic websites: on modern American poetry, on representations of the Holocaust, and on the cultural cold war of the 1950s. The sites provide links to reference material, academic criticism, and primary sources related to each site‚Äôs respective subject matter.

His preferred position was full-forward but as St Kilda had Tony Lockett at the time his opportunities were limited. He finally broke into the seniors towards the end of the 1991 AFL season and played five games.AFL Tables: Tim Allen In the 1992 season he was selected more regularly and appeared in 17 of a possible 23 games. Allen, who was used in the ruck on occasions, received three Brownlow Medal votes for his 22 disposal effort in a win over Adelaide that year. He was traded to Hawthorn at the end of the season, in return for the 119th pick of the 1992 AFL Draft. In two seasons, he played just eleven games and nominated for the 1994 draft. Geelong secured him with pick 81 but with the club having appeared in two of the last three grand finals, it was always going to be difficult to make it into the seniors.

It is a sequel to the original Super Dodge Ball and features characters from Techn≈çs Japan's Kunio- kun series. It was also the final game developed by Techn≈çs before the company went out of business. Techn≈çs location tested a Japanese version in arcades, but since the company went bankrupt, this version was not released and the game was only given a limited US release from SNK. However, putting a US cart of this game into a Japanese system will show the Japanese version. In 2001, Mega Enterprise ported this game to the PC exclusively for a Korean release.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. The rules of the game are similar to that of the original arcade version of Super Dodge Ball. Two teams battle each other out, with each team restricted to their side of the court, attacking each other with a ball, until all the members of one team are all eliminated. This time, teams are composed of only three members: a captain and two teammates. When a character's vitality gauge runs out completely, instead of being eliminated completely from the match, they are moved to the opposing team's outfield, where they can still assist their remaining teammates by attacking them from within the opposing side of the court. The Power Shots in the game are now performed by inputting fighting game-style commands. The captains in each team have two Power Shots, a Counter Shot, a Special Pass, and a Super Power Shot that can only be performed when the team's power gauge is completely filled. The generic teammates only have one power shot each. The controls of the game changes depending on whether the player's team is in possession with the ball (offense) or without it (defense). During offense mode, the player can shoot the ball at the opposing team, pass it to a teammate, jump, or feint a shot. In defense mode, the player can try to catch an opponent's shot, crouch to avoid, jump, or provoke. Pressing the A and B simultaneously in defense mode will cause the player's current character to charge the power gauge (which is normally filled when the player performs Power Shots). When two members of opposing teams pick up the ball at the same, they will be prompted to press any button rapidly until one character overpowers the other and gets a free shot. In the single-player mode, the player starts out by choosing from one of seven teams and then face against the other teams. The tournament starts out at the player's home court against a Zako (small fry) team consisting of generic characters. Afterward, the player will face against the other six main teams. When the player defeats one of the main teams, they will be asked whether or not to accept the defeated team's captain in their team. If the player accepts, the defeated opponent will replace of the teammates besides the captain. The penultimate match will be a team consist exclusively of team captains, while the final match is against the computer-only character D.B.

The clinical condition it caused is known as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). SFTS is an emerging infectious disease that was first described in northeast and central China 2009 and now has also been discovered in Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Taiwan in 2015. SFTS has a fatality rate of 12% and as high as over 30% in some areas. The major clinical symptoms of SFTS are fever, vomiting, diarrhea, multiple organ failure, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), leukopenia (low white blood cell count) and elevated liver enzyme levels. Another outbreak occurred in East China in the early half of 2020 while the world was battling the COVID-19 global pandemic that seemed to originate in Wuhan, China. History In 2009 Xue-jie Yu and colleagues isolated the SFTS virus (SFTSV) from SFTS patients‚Äô blood. Genome The genome has been sequenced. There are three segments‚Äîlarge (L), medium (M) and small (S). Five proteins have been identified‚Äîan RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), a glycoprotein N (Gn), a glycoprotein C (Gc), a nuclear protein (NP) and a non structural protein (NSs). The L segment encodes the RNA polymerase with 2084 amino acid residues. The M segment encodes one open reading frame encoding 1073 amino acid precursors of glycoproteins (Gn and Gc). The S segment has 1746 nucleotides of ambisense RNA encoding two proteins, the N and NSs proteins. These lie in opposite orientations and are separated by a 54 nucleotide intergenic region. Evolution Five genotypes (A‚ÄìE) have been identified. Strains from China could be grouped into all five genotypes while isolates from South Korea lay in three (types A, D and E) and those from Japan only in one (type E). The virus appears to have originated in the Dabie Mountains in central China between 1918 and 1995. Among bunyaviruses, it appears to be more closely related to the Uukuniemi virus serogroup than to the Sandfly fever group. It is a member of the Bhanja virus serocomplex. Life cycle SFTSV is a tick-borne virus; it is not clear whether it can be transmitted by other blood-sucking arthropods. It can infect many mammalian hosts, including cats, mice, hedgehogs, weasels, brushtail possums and yaks. Humans appear to be accidental hosts, and play no essential role in the life cycle of SFTSV. SFTSV has been detected from the ixodid tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, Ixodes nipponensis, Amblyomma testudinarium and Rhipicephalus microplus. In addition to tick bite, SFTSV can be transmitted from person to person through contact with blood or mucus of an infected person. Epidemiology This virus has been found in the Chinese provinces of Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shandong. SFTS occurs in rural areas, from March to November, and a majority of cases are found from April to July. The virus has also been found in South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and Taiwan.

The team travels to Mogadishu, Somalia, and acquires the targeting device from pirate Ellyas Abshir (Kevin Daniels). They then travel to the Swiss Alps to obtain the killing agent, thorium. Volkoff manages to access the vault by winning a game of computer chess before a timer expires and triggers several turrets. Outside, Sarah and Casey detect Russian chatter and rush to Chuck's aid, only to become trapped by Vivian, who is not injured. When Volkoff asks his daughter to release him, she refuses, feeling deceived and abandoned by him. She takes the thorium and leaves everyone in the vault with armed plasma bombs which Volkoff deactivates with a portable EMP generator. At Castle, Volkoff says goodbye to Mary before being returned to custody. As Casey grows increasingly uncomfortable with Alex lying to her mother, he considers revealing himself to her mother. It is revealed that Sarah has money saved up in case her father is arrested again, and she tears the prenuptial agreement. Chuck later brings his own document, requiring that Sarah never suggest divorce, which she gladly signs. Chuck takes Mary's advice to tell Ellie the truth about his place in the CIA. However, when he goes to confess and first mentions their father's computer, Ellie lies to his face. At Volkoff Industries, Vivian is determined to find and kill \\"Agent X\\", the only person her father ever feared. Production \\"Chuck Versus the Family Volkoff\\" was directed by producer Robert Duncan McNeill, and was written by Nicholas Wootton and Amanda Kate Shuman. The episode is Shuman's first writing credit, as she had previously been only a writer's assistant. It originally aired in the United States on April 11, 2011, on NBC as the twentieth episode of Chuck fourth season and the 74th episode overall. In the episode, guest stars Linda Hamilton, Timothy Dalton, Lauren Cohan, and Mekenna Melvin reprise their recurring roles of Alexei Volkoff, Mary Elizabeth Bartowski, Vivian Volkoff, and Alex McHugh, respectively. The episode also features Kevin Daniels as Ellyas Abshir. In their respective reviews of the episode, HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall and Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club wrote of various ideas the episode's writers introduced. Sepinwall noted several developments in the relationships between characters of the series. Sepinwall wrote that after becoming roommates, Casey and Morgan have become \\"an old married couple\\", drinking orange juice in unison and bickering with mouths full of cereal. In an \\"emotional role reversal\\" from previous points in their relationship, Chuck tries to be \\"cool\\" about Sarah's prenuptial agreement, while Sarah panics at Chuck's lack of an emotional reaction. Casey's relationship with his daughter also develops to the point that he considers revealing himself to her mother. Both Sepinwall and McGee wrote that Vivian was designed to be Chuck's counterpart. The episode also marks the beginning of Alexei's path to redemption. IGN writer Eric Goldman criticized the scene where Chuck and Sarah meet with Vivian for its frequent use of quick zooms to increase tension, writing that it \\"just didn't feel like it was natural to this show's style.\\" =Cultural references= This episodes maintains the series' tendency to reference popular culture. While reading a volume of A Song of Ice and Fire, Chuck notes, \\"Eddard, you don't let your kids keep a direwolf. That's a terrible idea.\\" This episode aired the same week as Game of Thrones first premiered on HBO.Game of Thrones Chuck and Ellyas later play Uno for the thorium. Volkoff jokes that to mine said thorium, he had to wage war with natives and destroy their Hometree, only to reveal that he and the other prisoners had recently watched Avatar. Reception \\"Chuck Versus the Family Volkoff\\" continued Chuck steady decline in viewership, drawing 4.028 million viewers, a series low. It also had a 2.5/4 share among all households and 1.3/4 share among those aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. HitFix Senior Editor Alan Sepinwall wrote that \\"Timothy Dalton was everything we had come to expect from him in the part: scary and dangerous and then so much the funnier for the way he kept trying to work the steps and turn over a new leaf. The episode left [Alexei]'s sincerity up in the air for most of the hour - was he really serious about making amends, or just trying to distract Chuck from his latest evil plan? - but Volkoff is such a well-drawn character, and Dalton so talented and versatile, that the comedy worked either way... Vivian, on the other hand? I'd been iffy on her in her most recent appearance, and putting her on camera with [Alexei], even briefly, was just a reminder of how much less she brings to the table.\\" Ryan McGee of The A.V. Club gave the episode a A-. Though he praised Dalton's performance, McGee wrote, \\"The direct parallels between Chuck and Vivian haven't really panned out in the way the show initially envisioned it. Let's face it: These two aren't exactly Buffy and Faith in terms of being foils for one another. The show has never painted Chuck as ever potentially going to the dark side. It has used Casey and occasionally Sarah to serve that function at times, but never Chuck. At this point, he's as set in his moral code as possible. Had the Vivian storyline happened at the outset of his Intersect 2.0 days, perhaps the taste of power could have gone to his head, with Vivian as an example of the road not taken. As such, Vivian's existence largely serves to connect her to the larger spy world of the show, not draw a direct parallel to the support system that helped Chuck overcome any potential temptations.\\" Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8 out of 10, writing, \\"This Chuck got off to a shaky start. I don't know how to put my finger on it exactly, but the pacing felt off in the first third or so of the episode... Thankfully, things picked up considerably as the episode went along ‚Äì I'd say the turning point was the scene in which Chuck was sent in to meet with the pirates. The way Chuck's big announcement that he worked for Alexei Volkoff immediately led to a bunch of guns pulled on him was funny, as was not only Chuck asking to play Uno (for his life), but that the pirate did indeed have the game.\\" Carl Cortez of Assignment X, however, gave the episode a negative review, calling it \\"a painfully nonsense driven episode that's now grasping at straws in an attempt to round out the last part of the season with an adequate storyline.\\" ReferencesExternal links 2011 American television episodes Chuck (season 4) episodes ","title":"Chuck Versus the Family Volkoff"},{"id":"31299170","text":"Shiga Square, open to the public since 1983.

They go by a variety of names such as \\"mercados p√∫blicos\\" (public markets), \\"mercados municipales\\" (municipal markets) or even more often simply \\"mercados\\" (markets). These markets are distinct from others in that they are almost always housed in buildings owned and operated by the local government, with numerous stands inside rented by individual merchants, who usually sell produce and other basic food staples. This market developed in Mexico as a way to regulate pre Hispanic markets called tianguis. These tianguis markets remain in Mexico, with the most traditional held on certain days, put up and taken down the same day, much the way it was done in Mesoamerica. These fixed mercados can be found in any town of any size in Mexico. Often, they are accompanied one or more days per week by tianguis, which set up around the main building. However, the largest, best developed and most numerous fixed markets are in Mexico City, which has over 300, 80 of which are specialty markets dedicated to one or more classes of merchandise, such as gourmet food, plants, cut flowers, candy etc. Tlacolula, Oaxaca Traditional fixed markets and tianguis \\"Lo recorr√≠ por a√±os enteros, de mercado a mercado, porque M√©xico est√° en los mercados\\". (I went from market to market for years, because Mexico is in its markets.) - Pablo Neruda In every city, town or village in Mexico, there is a traditional market designed to meet basic needs. These can be called by different names. In municipal seats, the main market for the area is called the municipal market. In many areas of Mexico City, \\"mercados\\". Most reflect the area's culture and folklore and some are works of art. The municipal president of Tuxtla Guti√©rrez, Yassir V√°zquez was quoted saying that \\"Public markets are a live example of our culture\\" during a meeting of market merchants in the Chiapas capital. The meeting was part of efforts to improve and expand the system of these markets statewide. These traditional markets are a variation of tianguis, or open air markets, which have been an important part of commerce since pre Hispanic times. The difference is that traditional tianguis are held on specific days, with individual vendors setting up and taking down their stalls on the same day. Like tianguis, traditional fixed markets have stands occupied by various individual merchants, and tend to sell the same kinds of products: produce, groceries and other basic necessities. The difference is that the fixed markets operate every day, and individual stands are rented and occupied in much the same way as a store is. The fixed market has its origin in various attempts to replace tianguis with markets that can be better regulated. However, the tianguis were never replaced. Many tianguis, especially in rural areas, now operate in conjunction with the fixed markets to expand on variety of merchandise available. In addition to their permanent nature, another important aspect of mercados is that the maintenance and operating costs of the buildings are subsidized by or paid for by the government. Rent, when it is charged, is nominal. Around seventy five percent of these markets are located in middle and lower income neighborhoods. Twenty three percent are located in upper income neighborhoods and two percent in areas considered extremely poor. city of Guanajuato. The most complete anthropological study of how a Mexican fixed market operates was done by Bronislaw Malinowsky and Julio de la Fuente in the 1930s in the city of Oaxaca. The study focused on how the central market of the city worked with the rural communities of the surrounding area. It determined that, for the most part, the relationship had not changed much since before the Conquest in both its economic and social structure. In many areas, local markets, with the abundance of colors, odors, flavors and meanings, represent a synthesis of culture and history of a region, especially that related to commerce that community has with others, according to Amalia Attolina, ethnohistorian at the INAH. In many areas of the country, these traditional markets still constitute a meeting area and a form of social cohesion. Another indication of the market‚Äôs cultural continuity is the presence of shrines in almost all traditional markets. In Aztec times, these were to deities such as those related to commerce. Today, most are dedicated to the Virgin Mary or Christ. Mexico City has the most markets for its size but traditional markets are an important part of economy in most of the country. The State of Mexico has 652 such markets, 64.8% of which are in the eastern half of the state. This traditional form of commerce provides 65% of residents' foodstuffs even though other types of stores such as supermarkets have been growing. The city of Toluca has various markets including 16 de Septiembre, Miguel Hidalgo and Jose Mar√≠a Morelos y Pav√≥n and the largest, the Central de Abasto wholesale food market, the second largest in the country after its equal in Mexico City. Mexico City has the greatest number and variety of both tianguis and fixed markets. and important in the supply chain of basic foodstuffs. The city has 317 public markets with 70,000 vendors, and more than 1,000 tianguis along with 314 self-service stores such as supermarkets. The traditional fixed market model has been expanded to the food distribution at the wholesale level, with the Central de Abastos and La Nueva Viga seafood markets handing foodstuff with an approximate value of 90 billion pesos each year. Fish market in Ensenada, Baja California. These traditional markets have been under pressure since the 20th century by newer forms of retailing, such as supermarkets, chain stores and convenience stores. This is especially true in urban areas, with about eighty percent of all food sales in Mexico City now done in supermarkets and similar outlets. Traditional fixed markets remain most viable in small rural towns, where the social network is strongest and options are limited. The system of a fixed public or municipal market along with a weekly tianguis, is an important part of the economy and food distribution of rural areas. These are how most people in rural areas buy, sell, and sometimes trade to obtain necessities. However, the traditional markets still remain in many of the country‚Äôs largest cities. One factor in favor of these markets is that the difficulty of getting around by car in the city, increases demand for outlets close to home. Wholesale markets such as the Central de Abastos are most often the source of the products sold in other forms of commerce, such as corner stores. While supermarkets are considered modern and more sanitary, the traditional fixed market still offers better prices. In 2007 and 2008, sales in traditional markets and tianguis rose between 40 and 44 percent, with sales in lower socioeconomic areas rising between 50 and 53 percent. The most likely reason for this is the economic downturn, which forced families to economize. However, these traditional markets, especially in major cities, face serious problems. In the past thirty years, there has been no new construction of this type of market in Mexico City, and existing ones have fallen into disrepair. While most of these older markets have had upgrades in gas, electric and drainage, as well as fire extinguishers installed, sixty percent are in danger of fire due to faulty electrical wiring. Many have insect and rodent infestations. Many of these markets are in unsafe areas, with drug addicts, alcoholics, and delinquents. Tenancingo, State of Mexico. The operation of these markets has also declined. In Mexico City, about 65% of permits that merchants have to operate in these public markets have some sort of irregularity. None of these markets have adequate sanitary measures for meat. Meat and dairy products sold in tianguis and fixed markets are not regulated or inspected according to the Centro Universitario de Ciencias Exactas e Ingenier√≠as (CUCEI). Contaminants such as Salmonella and E. coli have been detected in products tested by this organization. Since 1997, Mexico City authorities have not carried out inspection in businesses selling groceries of any type in the city. Federal authorities only have jurisdiction in the states. Since these traditional fixed markets are filled with individual vendors, there are some disadvantages. One main disadvantage of the markets is that it is filled with small vendors, who cannot purchase in bulk like supermarkets. Another, is the inability to pay with anything other than cash. Not only are most vendors not able to take debit or credit cards, they also cannot receive a type of tax exempt food coupon called vales, which many workers receive with their regular salary. However, the Mexico City government in 2010 authorized their employees to use their \\"vales\\" at fixed public markets as a move to support this traditional retail outlet. Traditional fixed markets in the city have been steadily losing their client base. One reason for this is that many have moved out of inner cities where these markets are into the suburbs. Over fifty percent of those who do shop at these markets are over the age of thirty five, with younger and more affluent shoppers preferring supermarkets, which are generally cleaner and better maintained. Markets that have had supermarkets or other chain stores open nearby have seen sales drop as much as fifty percent. This has led to the abandonment of many fixed market stalls and about twenty percent of these markets in the Mexico City area have been abandoned altogether. Although still important, the percentage of foodstuffs sold through basic markets has declined to only about twenty percent in Mexico City. Of the 317 markets, 248 offer fresh produce. Many stands have been replaced by those selling prepared foods such as tortas, juices, unlicensed movies and music, and other items. Similar problems with empty stalls and lack of maintenance can be found in fixed markets from the north, such as in city of Durango where eighty percent of stands are empty and in the south, such as in M√©rida, Yucat√°n where number have been completely abandoned, and for much the same reason, competition from self-service stores and convenience stores. Major markets in Mexico Produce at the Central de Abasto in Mexico City These traditional fixed market, whether they are called mercados p√∫blicos, mercados municipales or simply mercados, operate essentially the same in the entire country. However, Mexico City has the greatest number and variety of both tianguis and fixed markets. The city has 312 traditional fixed markets with cover an areas of about 60,000 m2. The city's largest general retail traditional market is La Merced, located just east of the historic center of Mexico City. It was a tianguis for many years, before the federal government decided to build a permanent structure for it in the 19th century. By the mid twentieth century, it was the main wholesale market for the city. However, this market became too small to handle the wholesale volume for the growing city. The wholesale function was then moved to the Central de Abastos in Iztapalapa in 1982. However, La Merced remains the largest and one of the busiest in the city. The largest market in Mexico City is the Central de Abastos wholesale food market, which is located alongside the La Nueva Viga wholesale seafood market in the southeast of the city. The complex is located on a property that extends , with more than 2,000 businesses that sell principally fruit, vegetables, meat and some processed foods in a main building that covers . The Central de Abastos itself commercializes more than 30,000 tons of food products daily, representing 80% of the consumption of the 20 million people in the Mexico City metropolitan area. The La Nueva Viga seafood market next door alone handles about sixty percent of all that is consumed in the country of Mexico. This market commercializes 1,500 tons per day and was built in the 1990s to replace the older La Viga Market, although the latter still operates. The next largest market is the Mercado del Mar in Zapopan, Jalisco, which commercializes about ten percent of all the seafood sold in Mexico. The governor of the state of Baja California and the Comision Nacional de Acuacutura y Pesca (Conapesca) is working on a project to open a wholesale seafood market in the state to compete with the La Nueva Viga and Mercado del Mar markets. One reason to put such a market here is that the seas around the Baja California peninsula produces about 75% of the country's seafood. Mural at the Abelardo L. Rodr√≠guez Market Mexico City has about eighty specialty markets partially or fully dedicated to one or few classes of items. The San Juan Market in the historic center specialized in gourmet foods such as the best produce and expensive and unusual meats and cheeses. Mercado Jamaica was opened in 1957 on chinampa land along Canal de la Viga. It is best known for the sale of cut flowers and ornamental plants with a large section dedicated to produce. Mercado de Sonora sells dishes, live animals and party items, but it is best known for its sections dedicated to herbal medicines and the occult. La Lagunilla has a building dedicated to furniture and another to clothing. This market is also known for its Sunday antiques market. Other specialty markets include one dedicated to candy in Candelaria and an ornamental plant market in the ecological reserve in Xochimilco. A number of markets are considered historic places. The Abelardo L. Rodriguez Market is located in the historic center of Mexico City, just northeast of the main plaza, or Zocalo. It was built in 1934 as a prototype for a more modern marketplace and has a number of unusual features such as day care and an auditorium. However, the markets most distinctive feature is the approximately 1,450 square meters of wall and ceiling space covered in murals. These murals were painted by students of Diego Rivera and under his supervision. The works mostly reflect socialist themes, such as the exploitation of workers, peasants and miners, the fight against Nazism and fascism, and racial discrimination. Earthquakes, time, humidity and vandalism took their toll on the murals from the time they were painted. Restoration of the murals began in 2009. Most markets are located in middle and lower income neighborhoods. One exception is the Michoac√°n Market, located in one of the more prestigious neighborhoods of Mexico City, Colonia Condesa. It is located between Michoac√°n, Vicente Su√°rez and Tamaulipas streets where three colonias (official neighborhoods) intersect. It is the only mercado that provides services three, Colonia Condesa, Colonia Hip√≥dromo and Colonia Hip√≥dromo Condesa. These are residential neighborhoods, with some office buildings. They are considered cosmopolitan, with Art Deco and other architecture from the 1930s and 1940s, along with a number of modern structures. It is an upper income neighborhood although it has had problems associated with urban decay. While the market sells foodstuffs retail, most of its sales are to the many restaurants in the area and nearby. La Paz in the center of Tlalpan has been around for about 110 years. It has 161 stands with everything from food to clothes and some esoteric products. History of retail markets=Mesoamerican markets= Section of Diego Rivera mural showing a scene at the Tlatelolco market Mexican traditional fixed markets and a number of other business practices have their origin in pre Hispanic or Mesoamerican trade and markets. Archeological evidence has shown that the Olmecs were probably the first culture with a system of trading networks that spread over what is the center of Mexico. Later cultures with vast trading networks include the Teotihuacans and the Maya. Local products as well as those obtained from trading networks were distributed through local markets called \\"tianguis\\" (Nahuatl for \\"market\\"), generally set up on certain days. Mesoamerican markets were based on the trading of items, with certain very valuable items such as cacao beans serving as currency. This type of market consists of a number of stands set up by vendors, on a plaza, often designed for that purpose. Often these merchants as well as tradesmen and other business were grouped together by product or service. There were also specialized markets in certain products such as salt in Atenantitlan, dogs in Acolman and slaves in Azcapotzalco and Iztocan. The most active trading routes were along the Mexican Plateau centered on the Valley of Mexico, whose lakes make transportation of goods easier using boats. The largest Mesoamerican trade network and market system was developed by the Aztecs, who brought valuable goods from distant lands such as jade, cotton, cacao, and precious metals. The main plaza of Tenochtitlan, which roughly corresponds with the Zocalo, was the city‚Äôs main market at first. This became insufficient and after taking over Tlatelolco, the main market for the area was shifted to there, due to its easy access to lake and canal transportation though La Lagunilla, a small cove. The most important markets were located in Tenochtitlan, Tlatelolco, Azcapotzalco and Tacuba. The largest was Tlatelolco followed by Tenochtitlan, where not only commercial activity took place, but political activity as well. The Tlalteloco market drew between 20,000 and 25,000 people each day to buy and sell. Every five days, was \\"market day\\", drawing between 40,000 and 45,000 people as there would be a far greater variety of merchandise. These markets sold everything from basic foodstuffs, to slaves, to exotic items from distant lands to precious metals such as gold. In the past and the present, traditional Mexican markets reflect the local culture both in what they sell and in how they are sold. Many pre Hispanic elements survive to this day, relatively unchanged. A \\"tianguis\\" refers to a market of stalls set up for the day by vendors and taken down at night. More traditional tianguis are periodic, usually weekly, but tianguis in cities may be set up and taken down each day. Small businesses and trades can still be found grouped together in certain areas of cities and markets with specialties, such as Mercado de Sonora, still exist. Pre Hispanic markets has altars inside them for the gods, a practiced continued, but with altars usually to the Virgin Mary or Christ. While these practices are still strongest in former Mesoamerican areas, tianguis and other market practices can be found in various parts of the country. =Colonial period and establishment of fixed markets= Model of a colonial era market at the Museo Nacional del Virreinato in Tepotzotl√°n. Firewood and other basic needs at the Thursday weekly tianguis next to the municipal market of Villa de Zaachila, Oaxaca The Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire mostly did not change commerce patterns in Mesoamerica. Tenochtitlan, renamed Mexico City, remained the center of the economy, with traders bringing merchandise from all the same regions as before. Markets remained outdoor affairs, with individual temporary stalls set up in plazas. Cacao beans would remain as a form of currency until as late as the beginning of the 19th century. Within the Valley of Mexico, the lakes and canals remained the main way of getting goods, especially agricultural products to market in the city and would remain so until their drainage would make them disappear by the end of the 19th century. One exception was that the great Tlatelolco market never recovered from the conquest and disappeared, replaced by the Mercado de San Juan, which was first located in the area where the Palacio de Bellas Artes is now, and then moved to the main square of the rebuilt city, today called the Zocalo. The main changes brought to commerce by the Spanish initially was the introduction of the wheel, which expanded trade routes and the variety of products regional markets could offer, the introduction of coins and the introduction of crops, animals and other merchandise from Europe. The last made the biggest impact. As early as 1541, indigenous peoples were growing, selling and consuming crops such as radishes, lettuce, pomegranates, peaches, quince, apples and figs. Many craft technologies, such as glazed pottery were also produced and sold; however, the most prized items in colonial markets would be manufactured items from Spain. Another change was the introduction of new agricultural techniques, which diminished the amount of human labor needed. This would create an indigenous and mestizo class of tradesmen in carpentry, pottery, canoe making, locksmithing, ironworkers and much more. As in the markets of old, these new craftsmen would group together into certain sections of town. Carpenters, locksmiths and ironworkers were found on Tacuba Street, sheepskins were prepared and sold in La Palma neighborhood, tanners in San Hip√≥lito and San Sebasti√°n and potters were found on Santa Mar√≠a street. However, not all businesses grouped together. Tailors, bacon makers, shoemakers, bricklayers, bakers and bars selling pulque tended to disperse. What are now the traditional public retail markets found in Mexico were the result of efforts to regulate and replace tianguis with more modern forms of commerce. The first regulatory step came in 1580, when grain producers were prohibited from selling directly to the market. Instead, they were required to sell to the colonial government, which then stored the grains in large warehouses called p√≥sitos or alh√≥ndigas to sell to the general market. The establishment of the Zocalo as the main market square meant that commercial development in Mexico would begin here and then spread outward to the rest of the territory. This also meant that the square would be a crowded, chaotic mass of stalls, with various attempts to clear it over the colonial period, with little long term success. This is because despite all the attempts by civil and religious authorities to control the markets, the indigenous market never disappeared. By the end of the 16th century, a number of indigenous markets were permitted to set up, so that these people could sell their own products, especially in areas then far outside Mexico City such as Tacubaya. Eventually, they began to sell in the main plaza in Mexico City, weekly at first, then daily. Attempts to regulate the tianguis commerce in the Zocalo led to the establishment of several formal markets. However, these markets would never eliminate tianguis commerce in the plaza. The first formal market was the El Par√≠an in 1703, after a major fire in the city. It was originally established as a common market, with all of the Zocalo‚Äôs vendors inside. However, the building was not large enough, and the structure‚Äôs space requirements pushed remaining outside vendors into the areas belonging to the Cathedral and government building. This market then became space for the various guilds of the city to market their wares. By the end of the 18th century, it would become the market for the upper Spanish and Criollo classes, selling imported merchandise such as that brought be the Manila Galleon. This was the market's height. After this time, it would slowly decay until it was demolished in 1843. With the upscaling of the El Pari√°n market, vendors selling to commoners were pushed into two other markets, El Baratillo and El Volador. The El Baratillo was established in 1793, initially with the name of Cruz del Factor. It was on the Zocalo as well, and specialized in handcrafts, secondhand items and food to the lower classes. It was also known for the sale of stolen merchandise as well. Over time, this market would draw thieves and other delinquents and have a reputation for being dangerous. This market would eventually be moved to an area now called Tepito. The first market established off the Zocalo was the El Volador at the end of the 18th century where the Supreme Court of Mexico is now. It was the first market run similarly to traditional retail markets of today, and became the main market for the city after the El Pari√°n and El Baratillo disappeared. As the colonial period continued, more fixed markets and more regulated tianguis were established outside the Zocalo, including Santa Catarina and La Lagunilla. The Zocalo itself would have several commerce centers. These would include the Portales de Mercaderes, the Portales las Flores and Portales la Diputacion, stores affixed to several of the main buildings surrounding the Zocalo. However, the Zocalo would remain filled with vendors until the 20th century. At the end of the colonial era, markets and tianguis in the city were grouped into three categories. One corresponded to the area in and around the Zocalo. The second most important group of markets was on the periphery of the first group. There were groups of fixed stands made of wood in places such as the plazas of Santa Catarina M√°rtir, La Cruz del Factor and Las Vizca√≠nas. The third group consisted on non permanent stands even further away from the center of the city. These included the tianguis of Jes√∫s, La Cal, Santa Ana, Carbonero, Mixcalco and others. During the last century of colonial rule, \\"estanco\\" or government monopolies were established on the production and commercialization of certain products, such as tobacco, gunpowder, playing cards, cured hides, salt, mercury and ice (which was brought by mule cart from the Iztacc√≠huatl and Popocat√©petl volcanos). Traditional market practices for Mexico were established and best developed in Mexico City. After the Conquest, other areas in Mesoamerica continued their traditional commerce patterns, with Spanish authorities then regulating them and building fixed structures. In areas outside of Mesoamerica, such as Jalisco, there was no major pre Hispanic market system, so that of Mexico City would be transplanted in the new areas. Guadalajara's market history began on the plaza of the Teatro Degollado when the city‚Äôs general market was established in 1606, following the Mesoamerican tradition of \\"market day\\" every five days as a tianguis. After a fire in 1795, covered vending stalls called \\"portales\\" were built of adobe and stone for the market. Later a \\"Pari√°n\\" market, much like the one in Mexico City was established, with the portales demolished in 1855. Like in Mexico City, the various markets and merchants were often segregated by district, with soap producers in Zacoalco, boot makers in Sayula, chairs and tapestries in Atoyac and cheese in Tizap√°n. Following Mexico City, merchants adopted the fixed market system to make themselves more visible to the public. Modern markets were built in the city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries including Mercado Corona in 1891, Mercado Libertad or San Juan de Dios in 1896, Mercado Alcalde in 1897, Mercado Mexicaltzingo in 1900 and Mercado Sebasti√°n Allende in 1905. Some others were built later, such as Mercado Zalatitlan in 1920 and Mercado IV Centenario in 1941. However, this city would abandon the traditional market model fairly early in favor of supermarkets and chain stores. New such markets were not constructed again until the 1960s, and then only in new neighborhoods created by the growth of the metropolitan area. =Independence to the present= After the end of the Mexican War of Independence in 1821, the markets initially had momentum as restrictions against imports were lifted and other measures to free the market had a positive effect. However, for much of the 19th century, the country's political instability would hamper market development and food distribution, with most remaining sold in small tianguis with large, formal markets only in the largest cities. The economic situation began to stabilize in the latter 19th century, especially the last decades under the Porfirio D√≠az regime. This government took steps to begin to regulate and modernize the food distribution system by establishing official monopolies called tendajones or estanquillos. In 1844, a new building was constructed for the El Volador market. The market would be destroyed and terminated by fire in 1870. A number of major markets in Mexico City were either established or formalized during this time. In 1850, the new Mercado de San Juan, also called Iturbide, was inaugurated. The first permanent structure now known as La Merced was constructed between 1861 and 1880. This structure was built to house much of the commercial activity in the area, as well as absorb the vendors of El Volador, which had closed. At this time, the area was still along a major canal called La Viga, filled with docks to receive incoming merchandise to the city from Xochimilco, Chalco and Texcoco. By 1887, there were nine main markets in the capital. In the north, there were the Santa Catarina, Santa Ana and Guerrero markets; in the south, the Mercado de San Juan; in the east La Merced and San Lucas and in the west Dos de Abril and San Cosme. By the end of the century, these were joined by the La Lagunilla market in 1893, the Loreto Market in 1889, and Mart√≠nez de la Torre in 1895. At this time as well, more modern forms of commerce would begin to appear in Mexico, such as the establishment of department stores, led by Liverpool and Palacio de Hierro, which still exist. Mercado Ju√°rez was opened in 1912, the last major market to open before the Mexican Revolution brought market development to a halt. The war disrupted food production and distribution with the abandonment of haciendas, lack of manpower in the agricultural sector and the disruption of transportation systems. With the exception of the Abelardo L. Rodr√≠guez market in 1934, there were no new markets constructed in Mexico City, other than small ones for newly established neighborhoods in the growing city. Outside of Mexico City, formal markets were still be introduced to replace older tianguis. The installation of fixed structures to replace tianguis did not always go well. In Xalapa, Veracruz a new, modern and at the time, spacious market was built and promoted in the 1940s to replace the weekly market at the Plazuela del Carb√≥n. However, at first no one would go and shop there, making it a distinct failure. It took fifteen years of efforts to make the market accepted and profitable. In the 1950s, the government began to replace a number of markets, which were stalls made of wood and lam√≠nate, with modern buildings. During the presidency of Adolfo L√≥pez Mateos (1958-1964) eighty eight markets were constructed in Mexico City. Mercados sobre ruedas (markets on wheels) was a concept implemented in 1969, to give agricultural producers a means to sell directly to consumers. The idea was that an association of producers could seek permission to sell their produce in a particular spot on a particular day of the week. However, many of these associations became dominated by intermediaries rather than by the farmers themselves, as the producers could not spend many days selling their merchandise. Today, \\"mercados sobre ruedas\\" is used to refer to informal street vendors who sell in large groups but generally can be found every day in the same location, rather than on market days, such as tianguis. According to INEGI, about 23 percent of the population earns money in the informal economy, with includes the mercados sobre ruedas and tianguis. During the rest of the 20th century, commercialization patterns for food and other staples were strongly influenced by the United States, with the introduction of concepts such as supermarkets and convenience stores. The current retail situation in Mexican cities varies widely. On one end, there are a myriad of small corner stores (called mescel√°neas, expendios de abarrotes or tienditas) and on the other are major supermarket and department chains such as Comercial Mexicana, Wal Mart, Liverpool and others. These types of markets now account for eighty percent of food sales in Mexico City. The appearance of supermarkets has diminished the sales in many markets. For example, sales at the market in Colonia Industrial were cut by half when a supermarket opened nearby in 2009. Although mercados usually have better prices and fresher produce, the rundown conditions of many is one factor why many consumers prefer supermarkets.

It originally aired on NBC in the United States on March 24, 2011. In the episode, the parks department goes on a camping trip to think of a way to follow up on the harvest festival, but Leslie struggles to come up with an idea. Meanwhile, Chris returns to Pawnee as the new city manager, as Ann continues trying to cope with their recent break-up. The episode was written by Aisha Muharrar and directed by Rob Schrab. It marked the reappearance of Rob Lowe, who was originally expected to depart the show after the episode \\"Indianapolis\\" after a recurring guest role, but instead joined the regular cast. \\"Camping\\" featured guest appearances by Phil Reeves as outgoing city manager Paul and Annie O'Donnell as the owner of a bed and breakfast. Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rashida Jones said she liked the new storylines that had developed for Ann Perkins' character, preferring that she remain single than simply get back together with Chris. According to Nielsen Media Research, \\"Camping\\" was seen by 5.15 million household viewers, a 39 percent increase from the previous episode, \\"Harvest Festival\\". The episode received generally positive reviews, with several commentators praising Jones' performance and the new direction her character was taking. Plot During a press conference about the success of the recent Pawnee harvest festival, city manager Paul (Phil Reeves) suffers a massive heart attack. Chris (Rob Lowe) accepts an offer to work as acting city manager while Paul recovers from bypass surgery. Chris requests of Leslie (Amy Poehler) more large-scale ideas to generate revenue, placing pressure on her to follow up the harvest festival, so she organizes a camping trip for the parks department to discuss ideas. Ann (Rashida Jones) feels awkward now that Chris is back; the two previously dated, but Chris broke up with Ann in such a friendly manner that she did not initially realize it was a break-up. Leslie invites Ann to the camping trip to help her feel better. Nobody except Leslie really cares about the trip: Ron (Nick Offerman) just wants to fish, Ben (Adam Scott) failed to bring a tent, and Tom (Aziz Ansari) just wants to relax in his huge tent filled with luxury electronic items. Tom expresses confusion as to why Ben, a state auditor who had been helping with Pawnee's financial problems, has not returned to his old job at Indianapolis; Ben does not explain his reasons, but it is hinted he harbors romantic feelings for Leslie. Meanwhile, Andy (Chris Pratt) sets up a romantic tent for April (Aubrey Plaza) in the wrong campsite miles away, forcing him to trek through the wilderness to find everyone and leaving April miserable on the campsite without Andy. During brainstorming sessions, nobody produces any good ideas because they assume Leslie will think of one. However, she worriedly confides to Ann and Ben she cannot think of anything on the same level of the harvest festival. Chris pays a visit during his nightly jog, and Ann leaves with him so they can clear the air. Over dinner, Chris once again acts so optimistic while discussing the break-up that Ann thinks their relationship is back on and tries to kiss him, severely embarrassing her. Meanwhile, the camping trip proves unsuccessful and everybody decides to go home that night, but they are left without transportation because Tom and Ben have hooked all of their electronics to the van's battery, draining it. Everybody hikes to a strange bed and breakfast filled with cats and dolls called The Quiet Corn, run by a strict old lady named Elsa Clack (Annie O'Donnell). Andy arrives and rebuilds the romantic tent in the yard for a flattered April. Leslie tells Ron about her mental block, worrying she will never again reproduce an idea better than harvest festival. Ron, recognizing how burnt out she is, solves Leslie's problem by locking her in a bedroom and ordering her to get some sleep. With a rare full night's sleep energizing her, Leslie wakes up with numerous big ideas that are well received by Chris. Production Prior to the broadcast of \\"Camping\\", Rashida Jones (pictured) said she liked the new storylines that had developed for her character, Ann Perkins. \\"Camping\\" was written by Aisha Muharrar and directed by Rob Schrab. It featured a guest appearance by Phil Reeves, who has played Pawnee township manager Paul Iaresco in several episodes dating back to the first season episode \\"Canvassing\\". Paul's departure from that position is used as a means to reintroduce Rob Lowe's character, Chris Traeger. Lowe was originally expected to be a guest star departing from the show after the episode \\"Indianapolis\\". However, after his original string of episodes were filmed, Lowe was signed as a permanent Parks and Recreation cast member, prompting the writers to find a way to reintroduce the character to the series. \\"Camping\\" also featured a guest appearance by New York-based actress Annie O'Donnell as Elsa Clack, owner of The Quiet Corn. Prior to the episode's broadcast, Rashida Jones said she liked the new storylines that had developed for Ann Perkins' character, preferring that she remain single than simply get back together with Chris: \\"It was pretty embarrassing what Ann went through, so I think she kind of has to recover from that before anything else. And this is a good time for Ann to be single too, because she hasn't been single ever on the show. I think she needs to do that a little bit.\\" Shortly after \\"Camping\\" first aired, a fake website for the bed and breakfast business The Quiet Corn was put up on the official NBC website, advertising the fictional establishment's features, room amenities and meal services. During one scene in \\"Camping\\", Tom refers to one of the gadgets in his tent as DJ Roomba, an iPod music player attached to an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner. The gadget, built by Tom, was previously featured in the second-season episode \\"Sweetums\\". Cultural references Tom fills his tent with electronics and other extravagant items from Sky Mall, a chain of luxury item retail stores. He nicknames the tent \\"The Thunderdome\\", named after the gladiator arena in the action film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985). While watching TV inside his tent, Tom claims to be recording the Food Network show Cupcake Wars, the CBS police procedural drama NCIS: Los Angeles and the sixth season of the Bravo reality series Top Chef. Later, while pitching his idea for a Pawnee amphitheatre, Tom expresses hope it would entice performances from such rappers as Lil Wayne, Drake and Jay-Z. While searching for inspiration for an idea, Leslie reads from her dream journal and recalls a dream where she happily married ALF, the alien protagonist of a science fiction sitcom of the same name. Later, Leslie listens to the Len song \\"Steal My Sunshine\\", which she calls a one-hit wonder and compares to her own lack of ability to come up with a second idea. Ben cheers Leslie up and compliments her work ethic by calling her the \\"Energizer Bunny of city government.\\" During a later scene, Tom mockingly calls Ben the \\"white Urkel\\", a reference to the archetype nerd character Steve Urkel from the comedy series Family Matters. Donna can be seen reading a book called Your Erogenous Zones. The bed and breakfast owner plays Beethoven's \\"Ode to Joy\\" on a harpsichord. Reception=Ratings= In its original American broadcast, \\"Camping\\" was seen by an estimated 5.15 million household viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, with a 3.0 rating/5 share among all viewers and a 2.4 rating/7 share among viewers between ages 18 and 49. It constituted a 39 percent increase from the previous episode, \\"Harvest Festival\\", which was seen by 4.08 million household viewers, a low for the season. Parks and Recreation was defeated in its 9:30 p.m. timeslot by the ABC medical drama Grey's Anatomy, which was seen by an average 10.1 million households; the Fox crime drama Bones, which was seen by 8.78 million households; and CBS coverage of NCAA basketball, which was seen by 6.82 million household. In network television, it beat only a repeat of the CW Network drama Nikita, which drew 1.397 million households. =Reviews= \\"Camping\\" received generally positive reviews, with several commentators praising the performance of Rashida Jones and the new comedic direction her character was taking. Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com praised how the script featured the entire ensemble cast together, rather than in separate subplots like recent episodes. He also enjoyed the developments with Ann's character, claiming it gave Jones more opportunities to shine than past episodes. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said she particularly enjoyed the jokes involving Jerry's character, and said she enjoyed that Ann once again misinterpreted Chris, although she said the joke was predictable. Zap2it writer Rick Porter said the episode was not as funny as the previous episode, \\"Harvest Festival\\", but said \\"if this is what qualifies as a (slightly) down episode for the show, then that's the sign of a comedy that's hitting for a very high average\\". He particularly praised the \\"fantastic dynamic\\" that has developed between Rashida Jones and Rob Lowe. TV Squad writer Joel Keller said the camping trip was a good way to avoid making the show feel stale following \\"Harvest Festival\\", and that the outdoors setting created strong potential for character-driven jokes by putting them out of their elements. Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club praised the episode for highlighting each of its characters, all of whom he said were at their best except for April, who he said seemed out of place in the camping storyline. He also said he was glad Ann's recent breakup with Chris \\"has allowed her true colors to shine through\\". Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic called it a \\"tremendously enjoyable episode\\" and \\"mostly just a chance to sit back and spend time with these goofy, lovable individuals\\". He praised the new storyline for Ann Perkins, claiming it created more comedic potential for Jones. Matt Fowler of IGN praised the performance of Rashida Jones and Chris Pratt, and called Leslie's stress over failing to come up with a new idea a \\"great little story\\". Alan Sepinwall of HitFix said \\"Camping\\" was not as funny as previous third-season episodes but was still an enjoyable episode that he found more \\"slow and contemplative\\", which he found indicative of the fact that the series was still on a strong track. Steve Kandell of New York magazine compared it to the second-season episode \\"Hunting Trip\\", but said \\"Camping\\" was \\"somewhat more of a placeholder\\". Kandell compared the characters' pressure to meet the city's expectations to those the show faces now that they have been renewed for a fourth season. ChicagoNow writer Andy Daglas called it \\"a fun episode, but also one that felt like sort of a pause, a chance to reset the pins\\". He compared the pressure on Leslie to come up with an idea on the harvest festival to pressure on the show's writing staff to follow up on the harvest festival story arc. The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow called it funny and charming, but also a low point in the season following seven excellent episodes. He said it depended too much on the show's romantic relationships, which he feels are growing stale, although he praised Rashida Jones's performance and the focus on the strong platonic relationship between Leslie and Ron.

Berkeley Earth was founded in early 2010 (originally called the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature project) with the goal of addressing the major concerns from outside the scientific community regarding global warming and the instrumental temperature record. The project's stated aim was a \\"transparent approach, based on data analysis.\\" In February 2013, Berkeley Earth became an independent non-profit. In August 2013, Berkeley Earth was granted 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status by the US government. The primary product is air temperatures over land, but they also produce a global dataset resulting from a merge of their land data with HadSST. Berkeley Earth founder Richard A. Muller told The Guardian Berkeley Earth has been funded by unrestricted educational grants totaling () about $1,394,500. Large donors include Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Charles G. Koch Foundation, the Fund for Innovative Climate and Energy Research (FICER),FICER funding comes from Bill Gates personally, rather than via the Gates Foundation ‚Äì Fund for Innovative Climate and Energy Research and the William K. Bowes Jr. Foundation. The donors have no control over how Berkeley Earth conducts the research or what they publish. The team's preliminary findings, data sets and programs were published beginning in December 2012. The study addressed scientific concerns including urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of data selection bias. The Berkeley Earth group concluded that the warming trend is real, that over the past 50 years (between the decades of the 1950s and 2000s) the land surface warmed by 0.91¬±0.05 ¬∞C, and their results mirror those obtained from earlier studies carried out by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Hadley Centre, NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) Surface Temperature Analysis, and the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia. The study also found that the urban heat island effect and poor station quality did not bias the results obtained from these earlier studies.

Downey, Board Director Former President of the international subsidiary of Shell Oil; founder of Roxanna Oil; former President of Arco International *Jim Boettcher, Board Director; investments Initial results After completing the analysis of the full land temperature data set, consisting of more than 1.6 billion temperature measurements dating back to the 1800s from 15 sources around the world, and originated from more than 39,000 temperature stations worldwide, the group submitted four papers for peer-review and publication in scientific journals. The Berkeley Earth study did not assess temperature changes in the oceans, nor try to assess how much of the observed warming is due to human action. The Berkeley Earth team also released the preliminary findings to the public on October 20, 2011 in order to promote additional scrutiny. The data sets and programs used to analyze the information, and the papers undergoing peer review were also made available to the public. The Berkeley Earth study addressed scientific concerns raised by skeptics including urban heat island effect, poor station quality, and the risk of data selection bias. The team's initial conclusions are the following: *The urban heat island effect and poor station quality did not bias the results obtained from earlier studies carried out by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the Hadley Centre and NASA's GISS Surface Temperature Analysis. The team found that the urban heat island effect is locally large and real, but does not contribute significantly to the average land temperature rise, as the planet's urban regions amount to less than 1% of the land area. The study also found that while stations considered \\"poor\\" might be less accurate, they recorded the same average warming trend. *Global temperatures closely matched previous studies from NASA GISS, NOAA and the Hadley Centre, that have found global warming trends. The Berkeley Earth group estimates that over the past 50 years the land surface warmed by 0.911 ¬∞C, just 2% less than NOAA's estimate. The team scientific director stated that \\"...this confirms that these studies were done carefully and that potential biases identified by climate change sceptics did not seriously affect their conclusions.\\" *About 1/3 of temperature sites around the world with records of 70 years or longer reported cooling (including much of the United States and northern Europe). But 2/3 of the sites show warming. Individual temperature histories reported from a single location are frequently noisy and/or unreliable, and it is always necessary to compare and combine many records to understand the true pattern of global warming. *The Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) has played a larger role than previously thought. The El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is generally thought to be the main reason for inter-annual warming or cooling, but the Berkeley Earth team's analysis found that the global temperature correlates more closely with the state of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation index, which is a measure of sea surface temperature in the north Atlantic. The Berkeley Earth analysis uses a new methodology and was tested against much of the same data as NOAA and NASA. The group uses an algorithm that attaches an automatic weighting to every data point, according to its consistency with comparable readings. The team claims this approach allows the inclusion of outlandish readings without distorting the result and standard statistical techniques were used to remove outliers. The methodology also avoids traditional procedures that require long, continuous data segments, thus accommodating for short sequences, such as those provided by temporary weather stations. This innovation allowed the group to compile an earlier record than its predecessors, starting from 1800, but with a high degree of uncertainty because at the time there were only two weather stations in America, just a few in Europe and one in Asia. =Reactions= Given project leader Muller's well-publicised concerns regarding the quality of climate change research, other critics anticipated that the Berkeley Earth study would be a vindication of their stance. For example, when the study team was announced, Anthony Watts, a climate change denialist blogger who popularized several of the issues addressed by the Berkeley Earth group study, expressed full confidence in the team's methods: When the initial results were released, and found to support the existing consensus, the study was widely decried by deniers. Watts spoke to The New York Times, which wrote: \\"Mr. Watts ... contended that the study's methodology was flawed because it examined data over a 60-year period instead of the 30-year-one that was the basis for his research and some other peer-reviewed studies. He also noted that the report had not yet been peer- reviewed and cited spelling errors as proof of sloppiness.\\" Steven Mosher, a co-author of a book critical of climate scientists, also disapproved saying that the study still lacked transparency. He said: \\"I'm not happy until the code is released and released in a language that people can use freely.\\" (The code and dataset were by then available from the Berkeley Earth Data page.Berkeley Earth Data as updated 2011-10-21, Berkeley Earth: Data Overview (current)) Stephen McIntyre, editor of Climate Audit, a climato-skeptics blog, said that \\"the team deserves credit for going back to the primary data and doing the work\\" and even though he had not had an opportunity to read the papers in detail, he questioned the analyses of urban heating and weather station quality. By contrast, the study was well received by Muller's peers in climate science research. James Hansen, a leading climate scientist and head of NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies commented that he had not yet read the research papers but was glad Muller was looking at the issue. He said \\"It should help inform those who have honest scepticism about global warming.\\" Phil Jones the director of the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) at the University of East Anglia, said: \\"I look forward to reading the finalised paper once it has been reviewed and published. These initial findings are very encouraging and echo our own results and our conclusion that the impact of urban heat islands on the overall global temperature is minimal.\\" Michael Mann, director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University, commented that \\"...they get the same result that everyone else has gotten,\\" and \\"that said, I think it's at least useful to see that even a critic like Muller, when he takes an honest look, finds that climate science is robust.\\" Peter Thorne, from the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites in North Carolina and chair of the International Surface Temperature Initiative, said: \\"This takes a very distinct approach to the problem and comes up with the same answer, and that builds confidence that pre-existing estimates are in the right ballpark. There is very substantial value in having multiple groups looking at the same problem in different ways.\\" The ice core research scientist Eric Steig wrote at RealClimate.org that it was unsurprising that Berkeley Earth's results matched previous results so well: \\"Any of various simple statistical analyses of the freely available data ...show... that it was very very unlikely that the results would change\\". Expanded scope Since the publication of its papers in 2013, Berkeley Earth has broadened its scope. Berkeley Earth has three program areas of work: 1) further scientific investigations on the nature of climate change and extreme weather events, 2) an education and communications program, and 3) evaluation of mitigation efforts in developed and developing economies, with a focus on energy conservation and the use of natural gas as a bridging fuel.Berkeley Earth ScienceBerkeley Earth Education & Communications Berkeley Earth Mitigation July 2012 announcement In an op-ed published in The New York Times on 28 July 2012, Muller announced further findings from the project. He said their analysis showed that average global land temperatures had increased by in 250 years, with the increase in the last 50 years being , and it seemed likely that this increase was entirely due to human caused greenhouse gas emissions. His opening paragraph stated: He said that their findings were stronger than those shown in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. Their analysis, set out in five scientific papers now being subjected to scrutiny by others, had used statistical methods which Robert Rohde had developed and had paid particular attention to overcoming issues that skeptics had questioned, including the urban heat island effect, poor station quality, data selection and data adjustment. In the fifth paper which they now made public, they fitted the shape of the record to various forcings including volcanoes, solar activity and sunspots. They found that the shape best matched the curve of the calculated greenhouse effect from human caused greenhouse gas emissions. Muller said he still found \\"that much, if not most, of what is attributed to climate change is speculative, exaggerated or just plain wrong. I've analyzed some of the most alarmist claims, and my skepticism about them hasn't changed.\\" See also *Novim ‚Äì https://www.novim.org/projects/surface- temperature/ *Global warming controversy ReferencesExternal links *Berkeley Earth home page *Papers submitted for review (): #Berkeley Earth Temperature Averaging Process #Influence of Urban Heating on the Global Temperature Land Average #Earth Atmospheric Land Surface Temperature and Station Quality in the United States #Decadal Variations in the Global Atmospheric Land Temperatures University of California, Berkeley Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Climatological research institutes ","title":"Berkeley Earth"},{"id":"31299419","text":"Nigerians in Vietnam are mostly expatriates from Nigeria residing in Vietnam for business or economic purposes. They are part of a new wave of Nigerian emigrants going to non-traditional migration destinations such as Ethiopia, Ghana, and Mozambique rather than traditional favorites like Libya, the United Kingdom, or the United States. They refer to poor economic conditions in their homeland, including lack of electricity and public safety, as their primary motivations for emigration. Business and employment Many Africans, including Nigerians, run fashion shops in Tan Phu district, Ho Chi Minh City. Others are believed to have been attracted to the country by offers of contracts with Vietnamese football teams around 2006 and 2007, but were later replaced by Brazilian players and had their contracts terminated. Wages in the country are low, equivalent to just US$200/month even for a college graduate, meaning many of the migrants find it difficult to make a living. Community relations Vietnam is increasingly becoming an unwelcoming destination for Nigerian migrants. The Vietnamese government, concerned by alleged negative activities of Nigerian immigrants, reportedly imposed a blanket ban on Nigerian entry to Vietnam in February 2009. Nigerians in Vietnam have been involved in drug trafficking, fraud, scamming, cyber fraud and other illegal activities. The crackdown even applied to government officials and legitimate business people. The straw which broke the camel's back was reported to be the murder of a Nigerian citizen by one of his countrymen in HCMC. Vietnamese officials also summoned the Nigerian ambassador to register their complaints. Long-time foreign residents of Ho Chi Minh City speak of an increasing level of hostility towards foreigners compared to a few years ago, stoked by media reports of Nigerian crime. Nigerian residents for their part protest that many of the crimes are attributable to visitors from other West African nations, but that Vietnamese people and media lump them all together as \\"Nigerians\\". Community organizations In 2009, at the suggestion of Vietnamese immigration officials, Nigerian residents formed the Nigerian Union in Vietnam in an effort of self-policing, in order to improve the public image of Nigerians and represent legitimate Nigerian businesspeople effectively to the authorities.

In his June 20, 1942 report, Revier- Leutnant der Schutzpolizei Josef Frischmann, in charge of the guard unit on the train, wrote that \\"51 Jews capable of work\\" were removed from the transport at Lublin station. The train had departed Vienna on June 14, 1942, ostensibly for Izbica, but the remaining 949 people on board were delivered to their final destination in Sobibor. The precise number of those spared upon arrival in the Sobibor extermination camp is unknown, but there were occasional selections there, for forced labour in other camps and factories, amounting to a total of several thousand people. Many of those selected subsequently perished due to harsh conditions in the slave-labour details. A number of them were murdered after internal selections following transfers to Majdanek and Auschwitz, where people were also routinely murdered by hanging or shooting for arbitrary offences. Thousands of Jews initially selected for slave-labour were among those killed in the Lublin district during Aktion Erntefest and many were shot or succumbed on the death marches in the closing stages of the Nazi regime. However, some of the people selected at Sobibor ultimately survived beyond the total defeat and unconditional surrender of the Nazis in May 1945. On August 17, 1943, a survivor from Sabinov in Slovakia, who has remained anonymous, wrote a report in which he described his selection in Sobibor, together with approximately 100 men and 50 women, upon arrival. For slave-labour in the drainage works in the vicinity of Sobibor they were taken to Krych√≥w. He had arrived following the violent clearance, of deported Slovakian Jews and the few remaining Polish Jews, from the Rejowiec ghetto on August 9, 1942. He described that a few additional skilled workers, technicians, blacksmiths and watchmakers were separated upon arrival in Sobibor, as well. He further wrote that fire was visible in the night sky in the vicinity of Sobibor, and that the stench of burning hair permeated the air. Approximately 1,000 people were selected from the 34,313 named deportees who had been deported from the Netherlands via Westerbork to Sobibor between March 2 and July 20, 1943. Only 16 of them, 13 women and three men, survived. From the group of approximately 30 women selected from the train which left Westerbork with 1,015 people on March 10, 1943, 13 survived the various camps. Although they were split up after arrival in Lublin and returned to the Netherlands via different camps and routes, this was the largest single group of survivors from any one of the 19 trains which departed the Netherlands. Upon arrival they were separated from the other deportees and shortly afterwards taken by train to Lublin, where they spent the next months in various work details divided over Majdanek and the Alter Flugplatz camp, on the site of an airfield. Eventually Eleven of the women were transferred to Milej√≥w where they worked for a brief period in a Wehrmacht operated provisions factory, but were soon taken to Trawniki, with a larger group of men and women of mixed nationality, in the immediate aftermath of Aktion Erntefest in November 1943. Here their first assignment was assisting in body disposal and sorting the looted possessions of those murdered at the Trawniki camp. After body disposal had nearly been completed the remaining men were murdered, as well. Elias Isak Alex Cohen was the only survivor of the March 17, 1943 transport. He was taken to Majdanek with a group of approximately 35 people selected based on profession. His experiences include a period operating machinery in the ammunition factory in Skar≈ºysko-Kamienna where the poisonous materials and lack of protections decimated the forced-labourers. Jozef Wins was the only one to return to the Netherlands from the May 11 transport. He was among a group of 80 men taken to Dorohucza. Jules Schelvis was the sole survivor of the 3,006 people on the deportation train of June 1, 1943, He too was taken to Dorohucza, with a group of 80 other men. From the remaining 14 trains people were also selected but no one survived the Holocaust.Afwikkelingsbureau Concentratiekampen Sobibor (1946)Elia Aron Cohen, De Negentien Treinen naar SobiborThomas Blatt, The Forgotten RevoltJules Schelvis, De TransportlijstenJules Schelvis, Binnen de PoortenMirjam Blits, Auschwitz 13917Dutch Red Cross Sobibor (1947) (PDF)Onderzoek - Vernietigingskamp Sobibor NIOD Toegang 804 Aftermath With few exceptions the survivors lost immediate family and relatives who were murdered in the camp. They returned to their native towns and countries to find little comfort.Elie Aron Cohen,Human Behaviour in the Concentration CampMartin Bossenbroek, De Meelstreep (2001)The Long Shadow of Sobibor Several of the survivors almost immediately gave statements about their experiences. They have written about their personal experiences and published researched monographs on the history of the camp. These statements and publications continue to be used in historical research and were used in court cases against perpetrators. The survivors themselves also testified at trials such as the Sobibor Trial in Hagen and participated in the prosecution in the capacity of Nebenkl√§ger, co-claimant, under the German criminal law system. A right of which descendants of people murdered in Sobibor also availed themselves in the 2009 trial of Trawniki Wachmann Ivan Demjanjuk.Nebenklage Sobibor Victims of Sobibor  In contrast to this short lists of survivors, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum states that at least 167,000 people were murdered in the Sobibor extermination camp. The Dutch Sobibor Foundation lists a calculated total of 170,165 people and cites the H√∂fle Telegram among its sources, while noting that other estimates range up to 300,000. For practical reasons it is not possible to list all the thousands of people murdered at the camp. The operatives of the Nazi regime not only robbed Jews of their earthly possessions and their lives but attempted to eradicate all traces of their existence as they engaged in the genocidal policies of the Final Solution.

In 1872, it was a swing bridge across the marine inlet channel of the inner basin of the Careenage (Constitution River) at Carlisle Bay. The out moded steel structure was dismantled and rebuilt in 2005‚Äì2006 as a lifting bridge with the state-of the-art modern technology of an all-composite single-leaf bascule design. This design is a counterweighted bridge span that pivots upward, permitting pleasure craft to pass through an inlet channel. The bridge was built using fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP), which is lighter, long lasting and non-corrosive. There are two bridges in use in Bridgetown. The Charles Duncan O'Neal Bridge is large and modern in design, commencing from the street east of National Heroes Square, while Chamberlain Bridge is the more \\"decorative humpbacked bridge\\" built to replace the original swing bridge after the Great Hurricane with funds generated through the efforts of the then British Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain (1836‚Äì1914). Etymology The swing bridge replaced an old wooden bridge named ‚ÄúIndian Bridge,‚Äù which ushered development through the movement of small boats into the inner basin of the Careenage River. The bridge was later renamed after Joseph Chamberlain, who, as the British Colonial Secretary in the 1890s, was instrumental in shielding the West Indian sugar industry against stiff competition from Europe. He is also credited with allocation of large funds as grants and loans to subsist the economy of Barbados. The town was officially known as the \\"town of St. Michael\\", but was later renamed as Bridgetown after the bridge. Indeed, the town was known as Indian Bridgetown or Indian Town for some time after this bridge. History The history of this bridge is recorded by Warren Alleyne in his book Historic Bridgetown.Warren Alleyne, Historic Bridgetown (1978; St Michael, Barbados Government Information Service, 2003). According to Alleyne, a primitive bridge, built by the indigenous Arawak, was replaced in 1628 by the Wolverstone settlers. It was rebuilt in 1654 after its condition deteriorated. Subsequently, fires gutted the bridge and it had to be rebuilt again in 1668. The problem was compounded by a hurricane in 1675 and again in 1677. This constant disruption caused inconvenience to traffic and prompted the authorities to build another bridge. The second bridge was built by levying a tax on the slaves. By 1681, Bridgetown had two bridges: the west bridge, which was built at the same location as the Indian Bridge (the present lift bridge), and the east bridge, built at the present site of the O'Neal Bridge. The Commemorative Independence Arch ;18th century Floods in 1700 destroyed the west bridge, resulting in only one bridge remaining as a link between the two banks of the river. Fifty years later, in 1751, the second bridge was rebuilt but it also ended in disaster due to poor construction, which necessitated the authorities to prosecute the builders. This was followed by a bridge constructed in 1760 for pedestrians only. ;19th century In 1862, when Trafalgar Square (later renamed National Heroes Square) was gutted, a rebuilding exercise of the entire complex resulted in planning for a swing bridge also. Construction for the swing bridge started in 1865 but had to be dismantled as it did not conform to the approved design. This was followed by shipping over the metalwork manufactured in London in transportable sections, and assembling on site from both ends of the structure. This exercise also ended in controversy, as both ends could not be joined due to a gap. Eventually, the bridge was completed at a cost of 18,000 pounds which was then stated to be \\"a total mismanagement of public funds\\". The bridge was formally commissioned on April 18, 1872. A hurricane struck it in 1898, causing severe damage to the structure. It was refurbished with funds granted by the British Government under Joseph Chamberlain, the then Secretary of State for the Colonies. ;20th century It was re-commissioned on December 14, 1900, by Lady Hay, wife of Sir James Shaw Hay, then Governor of Barbados. The bridge was also named in honour of the Secretary of State for the Colonies, as the \\"Chamberlain Bridge\\". It functioned until 1984, when it was declared unfit for traffic and it gradually deteriorated. A commemorative arch commemorating the 21st anniversary of Barbados Independence was built in 1987 at the southern end of the bridge. This reduced the available width for the new swing bridge. ;21st century In 2005, it was decided to replace the old swing bridge with modern state-of-the art bridge technology. A plan was made to build the modern lifting bridge. It included dismantling the old swing bridge to make way for the new bridge, which was completed in 2006. The new lift bridge stretches from National Heroes Square to the other bank, permitting seagoing ships to dock in the inner basin of the river in the rebuilt Careenage. Geography The Carineege (outer basin) named by the \\"Bajans\\" as Constitution River Inner basin of the Constitution River The Arawak Indians, the original inhabitants of Barbados, built a wooden bridge, the Arawak Indian bridge, across the inlet channel named the Constitution River or the Careenage River. Later, this part of the city became the waterfront where fishing and other commercial boats operated. Careenage inlet takes its name from the process of careening, in which weight would be tied to a ship‚Äôs mast to upturn it, exposing the hull so that it could be cleaned and painted. However, a deep-water harbour replaced the original harbour. It is inferred that the draw bridge, which was constructed in 1872, was also built at the same location as the Arawak Indian bridge. The Constitution River is an arm of the bay where the Careenage marina was developed for ships to berth. The Careenege marina was the hub of all mercantile activity of Bridgetown till the new harbour at Bridgetown was built. Of the two bridges built across this river, the Chamberlain Bridge was built as a draw bridge to allow large ships to cruise through the inlet and its name is in honour of the Colonial Secretary who helped Barbados with financial assistance after the 1898 hurricane. While the importance of the Careenage River channel and the draw bridge across it was the nucleus of activity for inter-island trading vessels, its current use is mostly for operation of recreational crafts such as catamarans, yachts, fishing boats and so forth. Today, the bridge is used for pedestrians only and the boardwalk attached to the bridge stretches over the length of the wharf and used by pedestrians to get fine vistas of the town. Structure The stone arch bridge and the modern bascule-type lift bridge The lift bridge was designed by Faber Maunsell to replace the bridge built in 1872. Several designs were considered. Finally, a unique design using fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) composite known as the \\"space age material\\" was chosen. The basic composition of FRP is an engineered polymer or plastic with glass reinforcement with supplements of additives and core materials. The lightweight FRP material was found not only economical and strong but also durable, non-corrosive lightweight to suit the corrodible marine environment. It was designed to carry 7.5 tonne vehicular load with pedestrian loading. The lift bridge was designed as an all-composite double-leaf bascule bridge with custom design adopting ‚ÄúStrongwell's Composolite building panel system, Strongwell EXTREN structural shapes and a custom, heavy-duty building panel.‚Äù EXTREN square tubes of different sizes provided the attractive architectural railing on the sides. The bridge was built in 2005‚Äì2006. The engineer in charge of implementation was Kandiah Kuhendran, with builder Richard Edghill. The bridge measures in width and of single span of length and is about deep. It was manufactured in four segments and assembled at site with ‚Äúadhesive and Composolite toggles and 3-way connector.‚Äù Edghill, who built this bridge, said that \\"It's probably one of the first in the world using that material, for a national lift bridge.\\" The FRP composite is a technology provides, a lighter and stronger structure with long life. The lift bridge as built is contiguous to the two old stone arches, which have been refurbished adding to the aesthetics of the bridge which have also been now provided with night lighting arrangements making the bridge locale an attractive scenic place to visit. The two span coral stone masonry arch structure dating from 1861 adjoins the lift bridge. The bridge has a plaque of the Barbadian National Anthem.

The \\"uniques\\" are a superhero team working as a covert operation unit. Main actors are Arnaldo Andr√©, Mariano Mart√≠nez and Griselda Siciliani, the two main supervillains are played by Favio Posca and Carlos Belloso. Premise Unlike most productions by Pol-ka, Los √∫nicos is not a telenovela featuring common people or a vengeance plot. Instead, it is a crime fiction comedy with metafictional elements. As such, it avoids the usual constrains of the plots of the aforementioned genres. The plot is influenced by the X-Men film series, Heroes and Sky High. Nicol√°s Cabr√© makes a spin-off of the Sin C√≥digo telenovela, playing again his former character of \\"Axel Etcheverry\\". In the new plot, the \\"Nielsen Security\\" group has gone bankrupt, and Axel blames his former teammate Gabriel Nielsen for it. Nielsen (which was played by Adri√°n Suar, creator of both series) has appeared a number of times, as well as other characters and references to the former telenovela. Arnaldo Andr√© composed his character, an experimented leader managing a team, based over his own protective relations with relatives, and the ways TV producers try to motivate him to accept a work. He made a deliberate effort to avoid giving an authoritarian style to the character, to avoid comparisons with his former character at Valientes. Production The series has had cameos from notable Argentine actors, such as Esteban Prol, Eugenia Su√°rez, Carlos Baute and Anabela Ascar. Gonzalo Heredia, from the previous successful telenovela Malparida, played himself in a casual scene, with a brief cameo of Juana Viale, also from that telenovela. Osvaldo Laport will play again his former character of \\"Amador Heredia\\" from Soy Gitano. Miguel √Ångel Rodr√≠guez and Mart√≠n Bossi will play crime bosses, and Ana Mar√≠a Orozco will join the team. A fashion show will include the presence of P√≠a Slapka, acting as herself, and fashion designer Roberto Giordano. The series had a successful rating, with nearly 20 points. Plot The \\"Uniques\\" are actually one of several covert operation units of skilled or superpowered people working at different countries. Alfredo Monterrey organized many of those units, and the series is about the creation and organization of the Argentine branch. His recruits are Diego Rouvier, Axel Etcheverry, Mar√≠a Soledad Marini, Rub√©n Hagi, Rosario Ahumada, Violeta Morano and Hugo Albarrac√≠n. Mar√≠a has superhuman strength, Axel has an unbreakable skeleton, Rub√©n Hagi has indestructible skin, and Violeta Morano is precognitive.

Originating from an area of disturbed weather on June 19, several hundred miles south of Mexico, Beatriz gradually intensified. Gaining latitude, the system became increasingly organized and reached hurricane status on the evening of June 20\\\\. The following morning, Beatriz attained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) as it passed roughly 15 mi (20 km) of Mexico. Due to its interaction with land, the hurricane abruptly weakened hours later. Early on June 22, Beatriz dissipated over open waters. Prior to Beatriz's arrival in Mexico, hurricane watches and warnings were issued for coastal areas. Hundreds of shelters opened across the states of Colima and Guerrero. Heavy rains from the storm triggered significant flooding along the Sabana River in Acapulco, killing four people. However, the overall effects of Beatriz were limited and the rains were largely beneficial in mitigating a severe drought. Meteorological history On June 16, 2011, a trough situated off the southern coast of Guatemala showed signs of possible tropical cyclogenesis. Though located within an area favoring development, the system remained broad and disorganized as it moved slowly west-northwestward. Gradually, convection consolidated around an area of low pressure. On June 18, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued for the system as it was expected to develop into a tropical depression within 24 hours. On the following day, the low further developed and was declared Tropical Depression Two-E by the National Hurricane Center at 1500 UTC. Upon being declared, the depression was located about 335 mi (540 km) south- southeast of L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Mexico. However, after post-analysis, the depression had actually developed nine hours earlier. Maintaining a west- northwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge to the north, the depression was forecast to move into a favorable environment, characterized by low wind shear and sea surface temperatures up to . Three hours after classification, the depression strengthened Tropical Storm Beatriz, the second named storm of the season. Early on June 20, convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops (denoted by cloud-top temperatures below ) appearing on satellite imagery. A notable increase in southerly outflow also took place. As the subtropical ridge north of the storm weakened, Beatriz acquired a more northerly component to its track, bringing the center of the storm closer to Mexico. Convective bands gradually wrapped around the system throughout the day. During the afternoon hours of June 20, a hurricane hunter aircraft found Beatriz just below hurricane strength, and subsequently, the system was upgraded just a few hours later, while situated roughly 85 mi (140 km) southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. Early on June 21, a wide eye developed within the central dense overcast. In light of this, the National Hurricane Center estimated Beatriz to have attained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) along with a barometric pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg); however, it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of 105 mph (165 km/h) from the University of Wisconsin and the Satellite Analysis Branch. Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi (20 km) south-southeast of La Fortuna, Mexico. Centered just off the coast of Mexico, the system interacted with land and began weakening. Hours later, convection rapidly diminished as dry air became entrained in the circulation. In response to quick degradation of the system's structure, the NHC downgraded Beatriz to a tropical storm. Rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours, the storm no longer had a defined circulation. Lacking an organized center and deep convection, the final advisory was issued on Beatriz. The storm's remnants persisted for several more hours before dissipating roughly 175 mi (280 km) southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco. Preparations and impact TRMM image of Beatriz on June 19 Following the classification of Tropical Depression Two-E on June 19, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for coastal areas between Zihuatanejo and Manzanillo. A hurricane watch was also put in place from Tecp√°n de Galeana to Punta San Telmo. Later that day, the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning and the watch was extended westward to La Fortuna. As Beatriz continued to strengthen, the watches and warnings were extended westward to Cabo Corrientes on June 20. Early on June 21, the easternmost advisories were discontinued as Beatriz moved away. Later that morning, all watches and warnings were discontinued in light of Beatriz's rapid weakening. In Colima and Jalisco, residents were warned of heavy rains that could trigger flooding and mudslides. Schools across both states canceled classes for June 21\\\\. In Colima, 236 shelters were opened to the public. Additionally, the Mexican Navy was placed on standby for hurricane relief. A total of 980 temporary shelters were opened in Guerrero, many of which were in Acapulco, as many residents were expected to evacuate flood-prone area. An orange-level alert was issued for portions of Chiapas in light of potentially heavy rains. Throughout Western and Southwestern Mexico, the Servicio Meteorol√≥gico Nacional (National Weather Service) advised that all air and sea traffic be suspended until the passage of Beatriz. Across Guerrero, Beatriz produced heavy rain, peaking at in Copala, Guerrero. Several homes across the state were damaged, though none were destroyed. In Acapulco, 380 homes were inundated by flood waters, prompting evacuations in areas built in 1999 to relocate residents after Hurricane Pauline. Several landslides blocked off roads and a section of a roundabout was destroyed. In the community of Amatillo, three people were killed after being washed away by flood waters. Heavy rains from Beatriz caused the Sabana River to overflow its banks, placing 150 homes across 14 colonias under water. One person drowned in San Agust√≠n after falling in the swollen river. Twenty-seven colonias in and around the city lost power after muddy floodwaters entered a substation. Throughout Oaxaca, at least a dozen homes lost their roofs due to high winds. Portions of Colima, Chiapas, Michoac√°n and Jalisco experienced heavy rains; however, in many areas, the rain proved beneficial in mitigating a severe drought.

Aedan also had two grandsons and a great-grandson with Brittonic names,Bannerman, John. 1974. Studies in the History of Dalriada. Edinburgh: Scottish Academic Press. and it is likely that Artuir was the son of Aedan's Brittonic wife and a brother of Maithgemma. The Life of St. Columba mentions Artuir in a chapter between Aedan and Columba, where the saint predicts that Aedan's younger son, Eochaid Buide, will succeed instead of Aedan's chosen sons. Columba then predicts the deaths of Artuir, Eochaid Find, and Domangart while fighting their father's battles. Adomnan adds \\" Artuir and Echoid Find were slain a little while later, in the battle of Miathi mentioned above. Domangart was killed in a rout of battle in England\\", illustrating the fulfillment of Columba's prophecy. In the previous chapter, Adomnan portrayed Columba praying for Aedan's victory over the Miathi, indicating that the battle occurred before Columba's death in 596‚Äì7.  Artuir mac Aedan as King Arthur  Also, Artuir died at the battle of Miathi as a prince, not a king. This is congruent with three major sourcesHistoria Brittonum, The Annales Cambriae and Y Gododdin. about Arthur, where he was no king either, but a \\"dux bellorum\\".

The Battle of Miathi could be near their citadel at Dumyat Hill (\\"the fortress of the Miathi\\") that overlooks the river Allan. A bend in the river Allan would be rendered in Gaelic something like \\"Cam Allan\\", similarly to the tradition. It is possible that Artuir did contribute one place-name and perhaps the four battles on the River Dubglas in Linnuis, as recorded by the Historia Brittonum.Historia Brittonum, chap. 56 or 50 (Giles Compilation) On the Dalriada‚ÄìStrathclyde border, W. F. Skene located a hill named Ben Arthur near Loch Long, not far from Glen Douglas in Lennox. Leslie AlcockAlcock, L. 1989. p. 64‚Äì66 suggested this area as a possible location of the battles on the River Dubglas.

It is situated along Caves Road between Busselton and Dunsborough on Geographe Bay. At the 2016 census, Quindalup had a population of 1,336. The area was the site of one of the earliest timber industries in the state. Several timber mills were constructed in the area and the products were exported utilising a jetty that had been constructed on the coast in the 1860s. The first recorded use of the name was on a timber mill owned by Henry Yelverton and McGibbon. Land was reserved by the government in the 1870s and in 1899 local fishermen petitioned for a town to be declared along the beach front. Lots were surveyed the same year and the town was gazetted in 1899. The name is Aboriginal in origin and means place of the Quenda. The town was situated close to a shallow inlet, where the jetty was built, which was used to load timber sent up by a tramway, to boats that would ferry the timber to boats anchored a few kilometres offshore. The only parts of the original settlement that are left are slab cottage group, known as Harwoods Cottage, which was constructed and associated with the original timber mill. The cottage group is composed of a cottage, gaol, post office, telephone exchange and Customs House. The buildings were almost derelict until restorations planned in 1998, commenced in 2000 and the operation was opened for business in 2000 with accommodation opened in 2004.

Surprise attack On hearing the advent of the Muslims, the tribe was terrified, and the Arabs that accompanied them defected and fled for their lives. Abu Bakr was entrusted as the commander of the Muhajir's (Emigrants), and Sa‚Äòd bin ‚ÄòUbƒÅdah was the commander of the An·π£ar (Helpers). The two armies were stationed at a well called Al-Muraysƒ´', near the sea, a short distance from Mecca. They fought with bows and arrows for an hour, and then the Muslims advanced so rapidly, they surrounded the al-Mu·π£·π≠aliq and took the entire tribe as prisoners, with their families, herds and flock. The battle ended in full victory for the Muslims. (free online) 'Alƒ´ ibn Abƒ´ ·π¨ƒÅlib killed a few wounded Ban≈´ al-Mu·π£·π≠aliq; among whom were MƒÅlik and his son. Two hundred families were taken as captives, two hundred camels, five thousand sheep, goats, as well as a huge quantity of household goods which were captured as booty. The household goods were sold in an auction to the highest bidder. However, there is an accident during the battle where 'Ubadah ibn al-Samit unintentionally killed one of his Ansari clansmen, Hisham ibn Subabah by mistake since he thought Hisham was an enemy. Juwayrƒ´yah bint al-·∏§ƒÅrith, daughter of the Ban≈´ al- Mu·π£·π≠aliq chief was one of the captives, and agreed to marry Mu·∏•ammad in exchange for releasing 100 prisoners who converted to Islam, as compensation (according to the Muslim scholar Safiur Rahman al Mubarakpuri).Sunan Abu Dawud, Book 29, Number 3920 Altercation between the fighters on return to Medina The army remained at the well of Al-Muraysƒ´' for several days, during which an altercation ensued between the MuhƒÅjir and An·π£ƒÅr. One of the MuhƒÅjirs, named Jahja, attacked an AnsƒÅrƒ´, and the two groups immediately clashed, but the quarrel was broken up by Mu·∏•ammad. 'AbdullƒÅh ibn ‚ÄòUbayy, who was referred to as the head of the Hypocrites (al-MunƒÅfiq≈´n) by Muslim historians, was furious for the challenge which the Muslims showed towards the hostile plans and vicious intrigues woven behind closed doors, and swore \\"the most honourable will expel the meanest out of Madinah\\", and added: \\"They (the Muslims) have outnumbered and shared us our land. If you fatten your dog, it will eat you.\\" When that talk was reported to the Mu·∏•ammad, 'Umar asked for permission to have Ibn ‚ÄòUbayy killed. Muhammad turned down his proposal on the grounds that it was not becoming for a prophet to be accused of killing his people. 'AbdullƒÅh ibn Ubayy's son, who was also called 'AbdullƒÅh, was angry at his father for the disrespect he showed. When the army reached Madinah, he drew his sword against his father and barred his father's entry into the town until he had confessed and declared that he himself was the meanest of the citizens of Madinah and that Mu·∏•ammad was the most honourable of them. The son was ready to cut off his father's head and bring it to Mu·∏•ammad, if he so wished. He said, according to the Muslim Historian al-·π¨abarƒ´: According to the Sealed Nectar, Mu·∏•ammad did not punish AbdullƒÅh ibn Ubayy in the public interest.

In expressing the support of the MƒÅori Party, she noted \\"[t]his bill is another step in our collective pursuit of Treaty injustice... This bill was never just about the MƒÅori Party; it started with the leadership of the eight iwi who took an application to the Maori Land Court at the top of the South Island\\", referring to the Ngati Apa case. The bill passed by 63‚Äì56. It was supported by the National, the MƒÅori Party, and United Future, while the Labour, the Greens, ACT, the Progressive Party and Hone Harawira voted against it. This Act was the key reason for why Harawira left the MƒÅori Party. In a press statement released on 23 February 2011, in which Harawira announced he was leaving the MƒÅori Party, he stated \\"I did not lead the 2004 Foreshore and Seabed March from Te Rerenga Wairua to Parliament that gave birth to the MƒÅori Party, to see it destroyed by infighting 5 years later\\". Controversy Green Party co-leader Metiria Turei opposed the legislation and argued that it represented just \\"how much of a failure the Maori Party - National negotiations have been over trying to resolve the inherent injustices that were put in place by New Zealand First and Labour in 2004. Those injustices remain. The failed principles are still in place in this legislation... just as they were in 2004. It is a great disappointment.\\" The Act Party also opposed the legislation, and unsuccessfully attempted to delay the passage of the bill by lodging hundreds of questions with the Speaker. Waitangi Tribunal In 2020 the Waitangi Tribunal found the act breached the Treaty of Waitangi. The tribunal found the Act failed to provide adequate and timely information about the Crown engagement pathway for applicants, and that it had breached its Treaty Duty of active protection by not funding all reasonable costs incurred by the applicant.

Though, in the four cities of San Diego, Tijuana, Tecate, and Rosarito Beach, the automobile serves as most important means of transportation. The international metropolitan region maintains an intricate highway infrastructure. As a large metropolitan area in Western North America, many roadways, including Interstates, State Routes, and Mexican Federal Highways, hold a terminus in the area. These roads have grown accustomed to support the masses of the commuting populace within the international region and are constantly being expanded and/or renovated. Transportation is a crucial issue in the metropolitan area. The streets and highways of the region affect environmental health and have influence over the degree of regional connectivity. Binational discussions about coordinating public transportation across the border are currently underway. San Diego‚ÄìTijuana is the site of two major international airports and numerous regional airports. It is also the site of the Port of San Diego and miles from the nearby Port of Ensenada. Major highways The major freeways within the conurbation are Interstate 5, Interstate 8, Interstate 15, and Interstate 805 linking San Diego‚ÄìTijuana with regions from as far away as the Pacific Northwest, the Arizona Sun Corridor, and the Rocky Mountains; and Fed 1, Fed 2, and Fed 3 (and corresponding toll roads for highways 1 and 2) connecting the metropolitan region to Ensenada, Baja California Sur, and the Mexicali Valley. Interstate 5 and Fed 1 are critical to the North American Free Trade Agreement due to their confluence at the San Ysidro Port of Entry linking British Columbia, the West Coast of the United States and the Gold Coast of Baja California at the busiest port of entry in the world. In the Imperial and Mexicali valleys, both Interstate 8 and Fed 2 are connected by State Route 111 and from this junction lead to the coastal center at San Diego‚ÄìTijuana. This connection ultimately links the region to the Rio Grande Valley on the Gulf of Mexico. Within the metropolitan region, Interstate 805 is a freeway that links Tijuana to Del Mar, running through the South Bay cities of Chula Vista and National City. San Diego‚ÄìTijuana is linked to Ensenada by numerous ways. These include Fed 3 that runs from Tecate thru Valley of the Palms to the port city, and by way of Fed 1 and Fed 1D that run from Tijuana thru Rosarito Beach to the Cinderella of the Pacific. State Routes connect regions of the metropolitan region with other California agglomerations. State Route 79 connects to the Greater Los Angeles area and State Route 78 connects to the Imperial Valley. On a regional scale State Route 52 connects communities in northern San Diego. Routes connecting Ports of Entry larger San Diego county cities, include State Route 905 connecting the Otay Mesa Port of Entry with large South Bay cities. Others such as State Route 125 link South Bay with East County. Some routes are much more extensive connecting areas such as South Bay with those as far away as the Mountain Empire as State Route 94 does. =Interstates= I-5 looking south toward Downtown San Diego, January 2002.

Carnival Cruise Lines, Royal Caribbean Cruises, and Holland America Line are among nine cruise line companies to serve the region. The cruise ships have stops in Ensenada, to the south, and in Los Angeles and Long Beach, to the north. Marinas dot the coast line of San Diego‚ÄìTijuana. Nineteen currently exist in San Diego County. Air transport San Diego International and Tijuana International airports service the metropolitan area.

The game is available for Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360. It was developed by Behaviour Interactive and published by Electronic Arts and Paramount Digital Entertainment. Plot=Jenkins Cousins Homestead= One night 15 years before the events of the story, a meteorite crashes into a sand dune near the home of Beans, Rango's desert iguana girlfriend from the movie. The impact of the explosion scatters fragments everywhere. Beans' father walks up the hill and examines the crater, but he is taken in a flash of green light. The story then flashes forward 15 years later, where we see Rango - the chameleon protagonist from the movie - awaken on his roadrunner Excelsior riding into the town of Dirt. Rango walks into the saloon, but seconds later, Slim the turkey vulture walks in with a meteorite fragment in a fish can. Rango opens it, but this causes Slim to dematerialize in a flash of green light. As everyone marvels at what Rango has just done, he tells them about when his encounter with the rocks over the past 8 days. The first day, Rango and his girlfriend Beans walk through Dirt, and Beans tells Rango about new evidence she has gathered about the abandonment of her parents. Bad Bill the Gila monster attacks them, stealing Beans' saddle bag. Rango chases Bill down to Skeleton Creek, where it is revealed that Bill has allied himself with the Jenkins Cousins, a portion of the same gang that everyone thought Rango had killed prominent members of in the movie. Rango eventually tracks Bill down to the barber shop, where the Jenkins Gang has set up hideout. After a firefight, sunlight is reflected off some sunglasses and lights Excelsior's tail on fire, causing him to run past a firework, lighting the fuse. The firework crashes into the barber shop, completely obliterating it and killing any remaining members of the Jenkins Gang. Bill and Rango both survive, and Bill is carried away by a bat; Rango recovers a meteorite fragment from the wreckage. =Water Train= The next day, Spoons the Mouse alerts Rango that Bill is trying to hijack the water train. Rango rides on Excelsior and pursues Bill through the desert and catches up to the train, clambering onto it. After multiple gunfights, Rango makes the halfway point of the train, but a gopher comes riding in on a bat with a machine gun attached to it, and opens fire on one of the cars, which contains dynamite sticks, causing the train cars to start rapidly burning down. Rango outruns the fire and makes it to the last few cars. Rango eventually makes it to the coal box which contains cactus instead of coal, and where Bill is hiding, looking at a fish can. Rango corners Bill at gunpoint and retrieves the can, which contains another fragment, but Bill tosses a cluster of dynamite cartridges with the fuses already lit, and escapes on his bat. Rango notices Excelsior charging alongside the track, and jumps onto him as the train explodes. =Forbidden Mine= The next day, Rango teams up with Beans, who is convinced that rocks play a part in her father's disappearance 15 years ago, and both of them track down Bill to the Forbidden Mine, a supposedly haunted mine hidden in Dry Creek. The townsfolk claim that the haunted mine is on a plain, while Rango claims that it is hidden in majestic cliffs. Rango chases Bill into the mine, but is chased by a boulder that destroys the entrance to the mine. Beans later meets Rango at the entrance of Area 102, which is \\"twice as mysterious as Area 51.\\" They also find a sign that says \\"Andromeda 5,\\" and Beans is convinced that her father was in the area at some point. Bill runs into Andromeda 5, and Rango chases after him. Rango eventually finds himself in Andromeda 5, a mostly abandoned and destroyed town. Bill makes it to the bell tower and opens fire on Rango with a machine gun. After multiple gunfights, Rango eventually golfs beetles at the bell tower, hitting the roof of the bell tower, the support beams holding the platform up, and the bell itself, which comes crashing down on top of Bill, trapping him, and revealing the third rock to be inside the machine gun. Rango retrieves the rock and he and Beans leave Andromeda 5. =Giant's Land= Rango then tells everyone that the rocks are actually meteorite fragments. The next evening, Rango looks for a different form of investigatory assistance, and travels to an RV, where a man named Lars lives. Lars is obsessed with finding aliens and performing scientific experiments on them. Rango, realizing what Lars is, tries to escape being found by him, even going so far as to activate a radio, mariachi cuckoo clock, a singing fish mount, a television, and a camera to distract him. He finds several newspaper articles posted on Lars' walls, including the meteorite crash in the desert 15 years ago, and theories about men from Mars. The very evidence he needed, Rango tries to escape, but is found by a crazed Lars. Rango golfs beetles at Lars' head, knocking him out. Rango escapes the trailer park with no rock. =Rodent Clan= The next day, Rango and Beans walk through Dirt, but Bill arrives, punches Rango into unconsciousness, and kidnaps both of them. It is revealed that Bill has teamed up with the Six-Toed Rodent Clan. Rango wakes up in a multi-levelled maximum security prison, and realizes that his sidearm is missing. Rango escapes his cell by jumping out the window and climbing onto a lower level of the prison. He manages to retrieve his sidearm after the guard who held it gets crushed under a door by another guard whom Rango - upon retrieving the gun - kills. Beans is loaded onto a stagecoach which Rango sees exit the prison. By sunrise, Rango has killed most of the Rodent Clan, and opened the exit doors. He mounts Excelsior and pursues the stagecoach throughout the desert. Eventually, he catches up with the stagecoach, but Bill mounts a machine gun on the top, firing at Rango. During the firefight, Rango manages to obliterate the stagecoach, sending Bill, Beans, and bits of the stagecoach flying in all directions. Beans falls, but Rango catches her. As she lands in his arms, a green rock lands on her dress: the 4th meteorite fragment. =Return of Rattlesnake Jake= At this point in the present, Beans has entered the saloon to see Rango. Rango continues the story. The same day Rango rescued Beans, they make it back to town, but they hear a rattling sound near the cantina. The noise belongs to Rattlesnake Jake, the Western diamondback rattlesnake from the first movie. Jake had heard Rango's lies in the movie about himself being Rango's \\"brother\\", and terrorized the town and its villagers. He only stopped when Rango almost killed him at gunpoint, and left the town. Later on, Jake found out about Rango's \\"little plan\\", claiming that should anyone claim possession of the rocks, he should be the one, not Rango, so he returns to Dirt to obtain the rest of the rocks and kill Rango. A fierce showdown takes place at town square, and it continues to the outskirts. Rango knocks out Jake, and as he hits the ground and passes out, the 5th rock ejects out of his mouth. =Zombie Attack= The next day, Rango believes Mr. Black the Southern Black widow spider coffin-maker is using the rocks to power some \\"morally incorrect experiments\\". He enters Mr. Black's laboratory, and realizes what Mr. Black has been doing: taking corpses and genetically experimenting on them, eventually bringing them back to life, specifically the sheriffs. Rango - despite not being able to find Mr. Black - puts a stop to the experiments and takes the corpses back outside, only to find a massive horde of Zombies invading the town, which has been set on fire, and the water tower has been emptied. Too late to save the town, which has already been evacuated, Rango flees to the graveyard, where every corpse rises out of the graves. Rango protects the barrier of the graveyard from the rest of the town, and golfs explosive beetles at the zombies, killing every one of them. Bill flies by on a bat, but Rango - refusing to let Bill get away this time - calls on a bat of his own and pursues him. Bill is distracted and doesn't look where he's going, and he ends up getting struck by a station wagon driven by Lars, and ends up getting stuck on the windshield. Rango, who had witnessed this, flies away satisfied. =Nowhere and Back= While the townsfolk don't believe Rango's story of the zombie apocalypse, Rango finishes the story by talking about the events of the day before. Rango heads out to the desert to think, and heads west towards what the townsfolk claim to be the blue hills, but what Rango claims to be the salt flats. With intense heat from the sun bearing down on him, Rango collapses. Later, he reawakens next to an abandoned arcade machine, where multiple copies of his wind-up toy fish Mr. Timms float into. Rango eventually clambers onto the machine and accidentally steps on the activation button, which sucks him inside. He finds himself inside an 8-bit 3D graphics world, where he navigates himself to Mr. Timms, who tells him \\"Beans holds the key.\\" Rango rides Mr. Timms out of the arcade machine and back into the desert, where everything is now abnormal. Rango dismounts Mr. Timms and walks towards a vision of himself in the same clothes he was wearing before he became a cowboy. The vision tells Rango, \\"You know what you have to do.\\" Rango then blinks until the vision of himself isn't there, and then he passes out. Rango reawakens on Excelsior the next day, riding into Dirt. =Alien invasion= As everyone ponders what the phrase means, Rango reveals that Beans had a key around her neck, and that her father scattered the rocks. Realizing that the final rock is in the bank, they use the key to open a safe deposit box where the rock is. That night, they gather all 8 rocks, which then transform into a floating laser that starts vaporizing everyone. Mr. Black arrives and directs Rango and Beans to the clock tower, which is actually a rocket. They leave Earth's atmosphere and enter a large mothership near the planet. Emerging from the wreckage of the clock tower rocket, Beans runs off to find the others, with Rango following her. They open up a laser cell, revealing the cell's inhabitants to be Slim and Beans's father, revealed to be alive all along, but when Beans reveals that Rango reassembled the rocks, Beans's father is shocked because he thought nobody would find them in the places he hid the rocks, and that they should not have reassembled the rocks. Rango finds the main alien and defeats it by ejecting it from its weapon ball and crushing it under the heavy mass of the ball. Rango opens a separate spaceship so everyone can escape. Rango pilots the spaceship as the mothership is about to suck up Lars's trailer home. The spaceship ejects itself from the mothership just as Lars steps outside and shoots the mothership down with a shotgun. Rango crashes the spaceship into the town square, and welcomes Beans' father back home. Reception Rango: The Video Game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. While acknowledging its gameplay and other elements as commendable, the majority of critics noted the game's short play time and replay value as a major pitfall.

The trail travels near the sides of the stream with multiple bridges, some of which are only about a foot higher than the water. The trail consists of two sections that are separated by Lake Barcroft near Columbia Pike (Virginia State Route 244) in Fairfax County. The Alexandria portion of the trail is in length and travels northwest in Alexandria from Eisenhower Avenue at Cameron Run, next to Cameron Run Regional Park, to the Alexandria/Fairfax County boundary near the end of North Chambliss Street. The Fairfax County portion of the trail travels northwest between that boundary and Columbia Pike and is in length. A bridge over the Run in Alexandria that is located a short distance southeast of the boundary and Fairfax County's Glen Hills Park connects these two portions of the trail, which together comprise the trail's entire southern section. The northern section of the trail is in length and located entirely in Fairfax County. It has an asphalt surface in some places and a stonedust surface in others. History The Holmes Run Trail was first envisioned as a trail along the Holmes Run stream valley in the 1970s as part of the Cameron Run Valley flood control project that built Cameron Run Regional Park. The first 1.5 miles of the trail were built, from Cameron Run to the west end of Dora Kelly Nature Park as part of the Cameron Run project in the early 1980s. Fairfax County began work in 2006 to extend the trail 1.5 miles in Fairfax County from Glen Hills Park to Columbia Pike. That work was completed in 2007, but the two sections didn't connect as they were separated by Holmes Run. In 2012, Alexandria built a trail underpass below Eisenhower Avenue to connect Holmes Run to the Eisenhower Avenue Trail. In 2013 Alexandria built a low water crossing from Glen Hills Park to Dora Kelly Nature Park in the area of Chambliss Street, connecting the two southern sections of the trail. In November 2018, a trail bridge across Holmes Run was built by Alexandria to replace a low water crossing at N. Ripley Street. The trail section west of Lake Barcroft in Fairfax County was built prior to 2001. Trail route The paved southern section of the Holmes Run Trail begins near Cameron Run Regional Park and the Great Waves Waterpark in southwestern Alexandria.(1) (2) Coordinates of beginning of Holmes Run Trail: The trail connects near its beginning to the west end of the Eisenhower Avenue Trail, which travels east between Eisenhower Avenue and the north side of Cameron Run to the Hoffman Town Center and the Eisenhower Avenue station on Washington Metro's Blue Line.Coordinates of underpass connecting Eisenhower Avenue and Holmes Run Trails: An underpass beneath Eisenhower Avenue connects the Eisenhower Avenue and Holmes Run Trails. The Holmes Run Trail begins by traveling northwest from Eisenhower Avenue along the northeast side of Cameron Run, passing under the Blue Line and three railroad bridges that are separated by sections of Cameron Run Regional Park.Coordinates of Metro Blue Line bridge crossing over Holmes Run Trail: Coordinates of railroad bridges crossing over Holmes Run Trail: (1) (2) (3) The trail then enters the easternmost portion of Ben Brenman Park, where it passes the origin of Cameron Run at the confluence of Holmes Run and Backlick Run. The trail then travels northwest on the east side of Holmes Run within Ben Brenman Park, where it connects to a paved trail that crosses the Run.Coordinates of intersection of Holmes Run Trail and Backlick Run Trail: That trail travels west near the north side of Backlick Run through Ben Brenman Park and Cameron Station Linear Park to reach Armistead Boothe Park, which is adjacent to the Samuel W. Tucker Elementary School. After leaving its intersection with the Backlick Run trail, the Holmes Run Trail continues to travel northwest in Alexandria on the east side of the Run and passes under Duke Street.Coordinates of Duke Street Bridge over Holmes Run Trail: The trail then travels through Holmes Run Park, passing the Charles Beatley Bridge, which crosses the Run to connect the trail with North Pickett Street and Holmes Run Parkway.Coordinates of intersection of Holmes Run Trail and trail to Charles Beatley Bridge: The trail continues northwest through Brookvalley Park, where it crosses the Run to the stream's west side.Coordinates of Holmes Run Trail crossing Holmes Run south of North Van Dorn Street: The trail then travels next to the Run under North Van Dorn Street and the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway (Interstate 395).Coordinates of Interstate 395 bridge over Holmes Run Trail: The trail then crosses North Beauregard Street and returns to the east side of the Run.Coordinates of crossing of Holmes Run Trail and North Beauregard Street: Coordinates of crossing of Holmes Run Trail and Holmes Run north of North Beauregard Street: The trail then continues northwest through several wooded sections on the east side of the Run in Dora Kelley Nature Park until it reaches North Chambliss Street, where a bridge carries the trail over the Run to its west side.Coordinates of Holmes Run Trail bridge over Holmes Run east of North Chambliss Street: Shortly thereafter, the trail enters Fairfax County and travels through Glen Hills Park on the Run's west side. After leaving Glen Hills Park, the southern section of the trail continues northwest on the west side of the Run, passing to the east of the Parklawn Pool.Coordinates of Holmes Run Trail east of Parklawn Pool: The trail then crosses the Run five times in Holmes Run Stream Valley Park and Lillian Carey Park before it reaches its end on the east side of the Run.

Flooding Users of the trail need to know the weather conditions before entering the trail. Holmes Run is part of the Cameron Run/Holmes Run Watershed, and is used to help channel flood waters toward Cameron Run and the Potomac River. Because the trail travels near the level of the water, during and after rainstorms various parts may be submerged, especially on the section of trail that goes underneath Interstate 395.

It was co-written and directed by Mike Robe. Based on actual events that occurred in Emporia, Kansas, in 1983, the film tells the story of State Trooper John Rule (Carradine), who investigates what appears to be a traffic accident resulting in the death of a local minister's wife. His investigation leads him to believe foul play was involved. Much of the principal photography and filming occurred on location in Kansas, and some of the dialogue comes directly from court transcripts.KEITH CARRADINE STARS IN 'MURDER ORDAINED' - Page 2 - New York Times The film was subsequently released on VHS and DVD. The cast also includes Terry Kinney, M. Emmet Walsh, John Goodman and Johnny Galecki.Murder Ordained Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes The series received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Editing for a Miniseries or a Special (Single Camera Production).

Before long, the two are talking about fleeing Emporia together to establish his dream of a family counseling center in New Mexico. He even talks about the possibility of a lucrative television ministry. But there are two nagging problems: their respective spouses. In July 1983, the body of Sandra Bird (Annabella Price) is discovered floating beneath a bridge in what looks like a car accident. But state trooper John Rule (Keith Carradine) becomes suspicious about the lack of skid marks and blood stains on the bridge.

The station serves the Denver metropolitan area and is currently owned by the WAY-FM Network. Its studios are located in Longmont, and the transmitter is near Castle Rock. History The station was originally licensed to Colorado Springs as KRYT-FM, broadcasting a middle-of-the-road music format as the full-time companion to daytime-only KRYT-AM 1530 (now KCMN). Walton Stations purchased the station in 1978 and began broadcasting country music as KKCS-FM under Program Director Lee Reynolds. While in the country format, KKCS-FM was a major player in the Colorado Springs market until the station was purchased by Bustos Media for $16 million in 2005. Bustos Media's plans were to turn 101.9 into a Denver station by changing the city of license to Centennial, Colorado, and the transmitter location to the Monument Hill area. On December 2, 2005, the station moved to a Regional Mexican format, \\"La Gran D,\\" and switched call letters from KKCS-FM to KGDQ on December 8, 2005. With all those changes, 101.9 FM effectively left Colorado Springs to broadcast to the larger Denver market. On June 9, 2008, KGDQ abandoned Regional Mexican in favor of picking up the Smooth Jazz format that was dropped several months earlier by KJCD. Bustos Media CEO Amador Bustos told AllAccess.com, \\"We will put our improved 101.9 FM signal to its best use, by filling an evident music vacuum in the Denver metro with Smooth Jazz programming.\\" The call letters changed to KKHI, for \\"K-High,\\" the slogan used by a previous Denver smooth jazz station, KHIH. On April 30, 2010, it was announced on KKHI Operations Manager/Program Director Steve Hamilton's Facebook page that the current format will be moving to the station's website. As of May 1, 2010 101.9 was sold by Bustos Media to Way-FM Communications, who then replaced the Smooth Jazz format with a Contemporary Christian format, using programming from the WAY-FM Network. The station's programming can also be heard in Northern Colorado on KCWA.

These stones - often basalt rocks or erratic boulders - can be found in the centre of many major cities, as well as in remote villages. Sometimes they are enclosed within an ornamental wrought iron fence, with a gate that can only be unlocked by the local priest or elder. In some places, such as Kathmandu Valley or Pokhara Valley, the Nag Dhunga can be found on the premises of a shrine, or a small pagoda-like temple. These temples are often popular with tourists. The NƒÅga of Hindu mythology are serpent deities, and are the caretakers of lakes and water sources. Lord Shiva has a close association with the NƒÅga, and is often said to wear them as ornaments. The Nag Dhunga is a rock on which Lord Shiva once rested, identified as such by ancient Vedic priests, at a time when Brahmanism was spreading out from the Indian Subcontinent into the mountain regions of Nepal's Himalayas and to Mount Kailash in Tibet. People are usually very proud to have a Nag Dhunga in their vicinity. They have picnics in front of it during festivals and decorate it with vermilion powder, flowers and small amounts of cash, and often offer milk, beaten rice and fruit to the NƒÅga that live under or inside the Dhunga. If a large snake is seen around the Dhunga they consider it a manifestation of the NƒÅga. If people in Nepal frequently encounter a cobra or similar snake at a certain spot, for example at a crossing of paths or beneath a holy Peepal tree, then they worship the spot where they have seen it by offering milk and boiled eggs. They mark the spot with vermilion as a sign for other passers by that they are at a NƒÅga crossing. Others will follow suit and place small offerings and conduct a puja (prayer ceremony). Those who are careless and do not notice such a crossing and who urinate or defecate near it will be punished by disease and bad luck. This belief is deeply entrenched in rural populations all over Nepal. Many Nepalese villages and places have the word Nag, Naga or Dhunga added to their name. This always signifies that there is a sacred snake stone in their vicinity.

The first was Kerry Galusha in 2009, which included Moses. The team finished round robin with a 4-7 record. Moses would return to the 2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts playing third stones for Galusha. Looking to defeat the defending champions for a third consecutive year, the team would fail to do so.

It is a development of motivational interviewing and motivational therapy. It focuses on the treatment of alcohol and other substance addictions. The goal of the therapy is not to guide the patient through the recovery process, but to invoke inwardly motivated change. The method has two elements: initial assessment battery session, and two to four individual therapeutic sessions with a therapist. During the first session, the specialist stimulates discussion on the patient's experiences with substance abuse and elicits self-motivational statements by providing feedback to the initial assessment. The principles of MET are utilised to increase motivation and develop a plan for further change; coping strategies are also presented and talked over with the patient. Changes in the patient's behaviour are monitored and cessation strategies used are reviewed by the therapist in the subsequent sessions, where patients are encouraged to sustain abstinence and progress. Process Motivational enhancement therapy is a strategy of therapy that involves a variation of motivational interviewing to analyze feedback gained from client sessions. Motivational Interviewing was originated by William Miller and Stephen Rollnick based on their experiences treating problem drinkers. The idea of Motivational Interviewing is based on engaging the client to pursue a behavior change. The method revolves around goal making, with assistance from the counselor to help guide the client to that specific set goal. This concept of motivational interviewing later developed into motivational enhancement therapy. The goal of this therapy is to help lead the client to achieve the goals they have set for themselves. Its aim is to provide the client with the opportunity to develop a focus in their life, other than their addiction. Clients Addicts are one of the primary populations motivational enhancement therapy lends an aid to. The therapist works closely with the client to help create an inner willingness to fight their addiction. Unlike other therapy or counseling programs that offer a step-by-step process, MET focuses on creating an internally motivated change. A typical therapy session consists of an initial assessment, and two to four treatment sessions with the therapist. In the initial session, the therapist conducts a discussion about the client‚Äôs substance use. They encourage the use of self-motivational statements through Motivational Interviewing. It is in this first session where a plan for change is established between the therapist and client. The following sessions are based around achieving that plan. MET has become increasingly effective. As it is rooted in the idea of self-motivation, those who seek help genuinely want it. It is also known by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) to be one of the most cost-effective methods available. Key components There are 5 key components to motivational enhancement therapy: *Express empathy ‚Äì The trust between the client and therapist begins at the first meeting and establishes a sense of unity. *Develop discrepancy ‚Äì Clients discuss their personal goals with their therapist. The therapist recognizes the distance they will have to go to achieve those goals. *Avoid argument ‚Äì Arguments will not be initiated or engaged in. Therapists give the client positive responses rather than negative ones. *Rolling with resistance ‚Äì As resistance of some kind will exist, MET encourages that the therapist and client \\"roll with\\" these resistances. *Support self-efficacy ‚Äì Self-efficacy is defined as the way people view their own competence and achieve their own goals. Therapists encourage clients to realize they are capable of many things, including having the strength to give up alcohol. ReferencesSources * Miller, W. R.

The Dwarf was a best-seller in Korea and was also made into a feature film titled A Small Ball Shot by a Midget (1980) by director Lee Won-se.Han Books, Dwarf Launches a Little Ball, http://www.hanbooks.com/899515120x.html  Plot  The Dwarf is a work of social criticism which focuses on the forced redevelopment of Hangbook-dong (ÌñâÎ≥µÎèô) in Seoul in the 1970s, and the human costs that accompanied it. The Dwarf revolves around a literal ‚Äúlittle guy,‚Äù and his family and friends, and their changing economic and social relationships which are destroyed by Korean modernization. The book follows the dwarf‚Äôs stunted existence through nasty cityscapes. A short cast of characters cycles in and out of the stories in anachronistic order. The dwarf lives in the Felicity District in Eden Province. The District is chosen for redevelopment and the dwarf and his family are evicted. The dwarf eventually commits suicide in a factory smokestack while his family is sundered. Family members argue that society has misjudged the dwarf, by seeing his height and not his skills. This focus on literal measure is a subtle irony which references several aspects of modernization, including the necessities of measuring everything, regularizing the size of everything, and commodifying everything. At the time the novel was being written the Park government roamed the streets of Seoul, its fashion police literally measuring the hair-length of men and the skirt-length of women.Time Magazine, Fashion's New Attitude: http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/style_design/article/0,28804,1882059_1882224_1882208,00.html In the factories, meanwhile, standardization, routinization and the tyranny of the time clock erased human differences between workers when not actually erasing humanity.KTLIT, The Dwarf: http://www.ktlit.com/uncategorized/the- dwarf-by-cho-se-hui This scarring and diminution is not merely physical, it is social and economic as well.

Cho mixes a kaleidoscopic narrative, powerful use of modern scientific symbols, and a flat and direct tone. The interlocking narrative arcs and often disconcerting internal shifts in narrator or time frame are both supportive of the theme of the book and ultimately rewarding. The Dwarf was written between 1975 and 1978 as a series of loosely linked short stories published across several Korean magazines. In Korea these works were collected into A Dwarf Launches a Little Ball, which has been renamed The Dwarf for its English publication.

He became an archbishop in 1968 and from then until retirement held positions at the rank of apostolic delegate or apostolic nuncio in several countries, including almost twenty years in Mexico where he became a controversial figure. Early years Prigione was born in Castellazzo Bormida and ordained a priest on 18 May 1944. He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1951. He fulfilled assignments in Italy, Great Britain, the United States and Austria, and also served as a delegate at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna. Pope Paul VI appointed him Titular Archbishop of Lauriacum and Apostolic Nuncio to El Salvador and Guatemala on 27 August 1968. He received his episcopal consecration on 24 November 1968 from Cardinal Amleto Giovanni Cicognani. He was appointed Apostolic Delegate to Ghana and Nigeria (a single title) on 2 October 1973. On 29 April 1976, he was named Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Nigeria. Mexico years Pope Paul named him Apostolic Delegate to Mexico on 7 February 1978. Prigione played an important role in giving the Mexican episcopate a more conservative profile in line with Pope John Paul II's repression of liberation theology and reassertion of papal primacy. When Archbishop of Chihuahua Adalberto Almeida y Merino denounced electoral fraud in the 1986 gubernatorial elections, he announced the closing of churches in the diocese on July 20. Prigione moved to avert a replay of the Church-State conflict of the late 1920s.Vikram K. Chand, Mexico's Political Awakening. Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press 2001, p. 183. When Prigione arrived in Mexico the Holy See and the Mexican government did not have diplomatic relations and the Church functioned in the country only because the government chose not to enforce much of its anti- religious law. Prigione was a key player in the change in attitude and policy of the Mexican government toward the Catholic Church. He was engaged in secret talks with the government in the month before the inauguration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari in December 1988. The Holy See and Mexico established diplomatic relations in September 1992 after lengthy negotiations and major changes to the stringent anti-clerical provisions of the Mexican Constitution of 1917 in December 1991.Chand, Mexico's Political Awakening, p. 197. During his visit to Mexico in May 1990 Pope John Paul had announced an upgrade of Prigione's status from apostolic delegate to permanent special envoy. He made Prigione Apostolic Nuncio to Mexico on 12 October 1992. In December 1993 and January 1994, Prigione met with secretly with two drug traffickers the government had identified as culpable in the assassination of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo in May 1993. He said he had not heard their confessions but that \\"As I am accustomed to do with people, I received them in private and listened to them ... I am obliged to keep secret that which people confide in me in private.\\" His actions fueled tensions with the government as some Catholic priests were being accused of supporting a rebel movement. He was sharply criticized by both political and church officials. The next year, when Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia of San Cristobal was accused of supporting the rebels, Mexico's bishops divided into opposing camps, some seeing the charge as scapegoating and the others, led by Prigione, distancing themselves and the Church from Ruiz. Last years He retired on 2 April 1997 with the appointment of Archbishop Justo Mullor Garc√≠a to succeed him as Nuncio to Mexico. He died on 27 May 2016 in the Diocese of Alessandria in Italy. His reputation in Mexico was largely political, and the Mexican press reflected this when reporting his death. El Universal mentioned the restoration of diplomatic ties, meeting with drug lords, and the cardinal's assassination, and called him \\"controversial\\". Proceso mentioned the drug lords and said Prigione had protected the sexual abuser Marcial Maciel. It weighed the positive diplomacy against his negative role in Mexico's internal affairs. It charged him with supporting the government against progressives in the Church and called his years in Mexico \\"a long period of ecclesiastical subjugation\\". It characterized the bishops whose appointments he championed as hard-liners and noted that one still survived, the Cardinal Archbishop of Mexico Norberto Rivera Carrera. When Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Rivera in December 2017, El Economist headlined its report: \\"Goodbye to Prigione's Princes\\". It said Prigione had united the Church with the government \\"to disrupt everything that smells of liberation theology and all pastoral work that brings the faithful closer to political participation or social organization\\".

The use of such technologies as a supplement to mainstream therapies for mental disorders is an emerging mental health treatment field which, it is argued, could improve the accessibility, effectiveness and affordability of mental health care. Mental health technologies used by professionals as an adjunct to mainstream clinical practices include email, SMS, virtual reality, computer programs, blogs, social networks, the telephone, video conferencing, computer games, instant messaging and podcasts.  Specific technologies  Traditional methods of helping people with a mental health problem have been to use approaches such as medication, counselling, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), exercise and a healthy diet. New technology can also be used in conjunction with traditional methods. = PC devices = TED speaker Jane McGanigall's website Games For Change includes a health category, which presents many mental health games improving and education games. Additionally, her own game, Super Better for PC, IOS and Android is also meant for mental health improvement. = Virtual reality = Rizzo et al. have used virtual reality (VR) (simulated real environments through digital media) to successfully treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The VR system offers a sense of realism in a safe environment. By gradually exposing the person to their fear with a Virtual Environment the patient becomes accustomed to the trigger of their problem to an extent that it no longer becomes an issue. This form of treatment has also been applied to other mental health problems such as phobias (where anxiety is triggered by a certain situation). For example, fear of flying or arachnophobia (fear of spiders). Computer games have also been used to provide therapy for adolescents. Many adolescents are reluctant to have therapy and a computer game is a fun, anonymous and accessible way to receive therapeutic advice. An example of a computer game that provides such therapy is SPARX, which has notably been shown to be about as effective as face-to-face therapy in a clinical trial. = Mobile devices = Relatively new technology such as mobile phones have also been used to help people with mental health problems by providing timely information. As technology improves, it may soon be possible for mobile phones or other devices to sense when sufferers are changing state (e.g. entering a manic or a deeply depressed phase), for instance by noticing a change in voice pattern or usage frequency, or facial tension. It may also become possible to measure physical evidence of levels of distress and suffering, such as changes in hormones or adrenalin in blood, and changes in brain activity. Apps may also be able to predict high stress situations, based on location, time, activity (e.g. purchasing of alcohol) and nearby presence of high risk people. The technology could then send calming messages to sufferers, automatically alert carers and even automatically administer meds. There are different technologies that are used in the mental health field over the past 30 years. \\"Mobile devices like cell phones, smartphones, and tablets are giving the public, doctors, and researchers new ways to access help, monitor progress, and increase understanding of mental wellbeing. New technology can also be packaged into an extremely sophisticated app for smartphones or tablets. Such apps might use the device‚Äôs built-in sensors to collect information on a user‚Äôs typical behavior patterns. If the app detects a change in behavior, it may provide a signal that help is needed before a crisis occurs\\" (Technology and the Future of Mental Health Treatment, n.d.). This connects to Quan-Haase reading about surveillance. The use of a mobile app that knows people behavior has private information about the people who use it. The people are being watched by the app creator or company. Functional view argues that societies, in order to operate effectively, require some element of security and safety. To achieve these goals, personal information in surveillance are only for a degree, not of kind. ‚ÄúThis form of surveillance is harmless since third-party companies are primarily interested in aggregate data and will use this information for the purpose of developing and marketing better products, which will benefit consumers in the long run‚Äù (Quan-Haase, 2016, p. 222-223). There are many pros of using mental health app such as it is convenience, lower cost, and 24-hour service. Technology companies are developing mobile-based artificial intelligence chatbot applications that use evidence-based techniques, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), to provide early intervention to support mental health and emotional well-being challenges. Artificial intelligence (AI) text-based conversational applications delivered securely and privately over mobile devices have the ability to scale globally and offer contextual and always-available support. A recent real world data evaluation study, published in the open access journal JMIR mHealth & uHealth, that used an AI- based emotionally intelligent mobile chatbot app, Wysa, identified a significantly higher average improvement in symptoms of depression and a higher proportion of positive in-app experience among the more engaged users of the app as compared to the less engaged users. On 15 June 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first video game treatment, a game for children aged 8‚Äì12 with certain types of ADHD called EndeavorRx. It can be downloaded with a prescription onto a mobile device, and is intended for use in tandem with other treatments. Patients play it for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week, over a month-long treatment plan. = Technology and cognitive behavioral therapy = The development of mobile phone apps using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has a increasing research area. Using the idea of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) apps, self-rated mental health (SRMH) situations can be implemented into these apps and used as information before seeing a professional. Recent research done with self-rated mental health (SRMH) involves survey research which is conducted by with a question that asks respondents to rate their overall mental or emotional health from poor to excellent. The research found with SRMH showed that 62% of people with a mental health problem rated themselves as having positive mental health. The respondents who rated their mental health as good when compared to those with poor mental health, had 30% lower odds of having a mental health problem at a follow-up. This research showcased that without treatment, people with a mental health problem did better if they perceived their mental health in a positive way by declaring a good overall mental or emotional health. While studies have investigated the clinical efficacy of remote-, internet- and chatbot-based therapy, there are other factors, such as enjoyment and smoothness, that are important for evaluating therapy sessions. Research published in 2019 reported a comparative study of therapy sessions following the interaction of 10 participants with human therapists versus a chatbot (simulated using a Wizard of Oz protocol), finding evidence to suggest that when compared against a human therapist control, participants find chatbot- provided therapy less useful, less enjoyable, and their conversations less smooth (a key dimension of a positively-regarded therapy session).

The term is used primarily in a political and cultural context. \\"Ukrainophilia\\" and \\"Ukrainophile\\" are the terms used to denote pro-Ukrainian sentiments, usually in politics and literature. Ukrainophilia was severely persecuted by the imperial Russian government. Ukrainian-language books and theater were banned.  History of Ukrainophilia  Ukrainophilia arose as a movement in Poland in the first half of the 19th century, among Polish writers of the so-called \\"Ukrainian school\\" and later among ethnic Poles in Ukraine, who wrote poems and songs in the Ukrainian language. The Ukrainophile movement also developed among ethnic Ukrainian intellectuals in the Russian Empire and Galicia in the second half of the 19th century. Ukrainophiles sought to preserve and develop the Ukrainian language, literature and culture. They called for the introduction of the Ukrainian language in Ukrainian schools and the autonomy from the Russian Empire, that would allow for national self-determination of Ukrainians and free development of Ukrainian culture. Ukrainophilia in the 19th century included various degrees of intensity, from the simple love of one's people all the way to passionate nationalism and independence. The Ukrainophile movement in Russian literature led to the publishing of books and textbooks in the Ukrainian language. Ukrainophile intellectuals published a number of journals: Osnova in St. Petersburg (1861‚Äì62), Chernigovskiy Listok, Samostaine Slovo, Hromadnytsia, Pomyinytsia. They also sought to popularize the Ukrainian language by publishing pamphlets in Ukrainian. Ukrainophiles of the Russian Empire also created a network of Ukrainophile organizations, the most important of which were in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, Poltava and Odessa, which actively sought to organize Ukrainian-language instruction in schools. After the Russian Empire crushed the Polish uprising of 1863, the Russian government put intense pressure on the Ukrainophile movement (Valuyev Circular in 1863, Ems Ukaz in 1876), but the movement continued flaring up, especially in early 1870s and late 1880s. After the movement was repressed, most of its members turned their attention away from political organizing to literary work, such as creating Ukrainian dictionaries, writing Ukrainian books, developing the discipline of Ukrainian studies. During the Soviet period the Ukrainophile movement was characterized as a \\"burgeois-national\\" movement.  Ukrainophilia today  Ukrainophilia exists among the Ukrainian diaspora in Russia, North America and elsewhere. =Azerbaijan= The population of the Caucasian nation of Azerbaijan has a very positive attitude towards the Ukrainian people and independent Ukraine was one of the first countries that Azerbaijan established relations with. =Canada= Canada has shown many Ukrainophile tendencies, owing in part to a large Ukrainian diaspora. Canada, for example, was the first nation in the world to recognize national independence of modern Ukraine.Ukraine and Russia: The Post-Soviet Transition by Roman Solchanyk, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2000, (page 100) Canadian Yearbook of International Law, Vol 30, 1992, University of British Columbia Press, 1993, (page 371) Russia, Ukraine, and the Breakup of the Soviet Union by Roman Szporluk, Hoover Institution Press, 2000, (page 355 =Israel= In the 1990s many Jewish people emigrated from the former Soviet states, especially from Ukraine, to Israel. Jewish Ukrainians had lived in Ukraine for centuries, having partially assimilated, intermarried and adopted the culture of the people that they lived among. Even today many Ukrainian Jews in Israel feel a sense of connection to and pride with Ukraine, and are still influenced by Ukrainian culture, language and food. =Poland= Some European nations are also quite Ukrainophilic today, especially those that supported Ukraine's sovereignty. Modern Poland could be an example, as it has become one of Ukraine's closest allies and trade partners in the European Union. Poland was also one of the first countries in the world to recognize the national independence of Ukraine (the first being Canada) in 1991. Despite this, Ukrainophobia and anti- Ukrainian stereotypes prevail in Polish society. Prior to World War II, the Second Polish Republic restricted rights of people who declared Ukrainian nationality, belonged to the Eastern Orthodox Church and inhabited the Eastern Borderlands.

Sarcomeres are added in parallel, as for example occurs in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the heart, concentric hypertrophy is related to increased pressure overload of the heart, often due to hypertension and/or aortic stenosis. The consequence is a decrease in ventricular compliance and diastolic dysfunction, followed eventually by ventricular failure and systolic dysfunction. Laplace's law for a sphere states wall stress (T) is proportionate to the product of the transmural pressure (P) and cavitary radius (r) and inversely proportionate to wall thickness (W): In response to the pressure overload left ventricular wall thickness markedly increases‚Äîwhile the cavitary radius remains relatively unchanged.

The species is solely known from the late Eocene, Chadronian stage, Florissant Formation deposits in Florissant, Colorado, USA. Anthidium exhumatum is one of only four extinct species of mason bees known from the fossil record, and with Anthidium scudderi, one of two species from the Florissant Formation. History and classification The species is known only from three fossils, the holotype and an additional fossil not designated a type specimen. The holotype, number \\"No. 2003\\", is a single male specimen consisting of part and counterpart fossils, originally part of the Samuel Hubbard Scudder collection as specimens \\"No. 13,709\\" and \\"No. 11,388\\". The additional specimen, \\"No.8444\\", is a female; all three fossils are currently residing in Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology paleoentomology collections. A. exhumatum was first studied by Theodore Cockerell, who published the type description in the Bulletin of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, 1906. The derivation and meaning of the specific epithet exhumatum (\\"dug up\\") was not specified by Cockerell in the type description. Description The holotype of Anthidium exhumatum is in length, however the body length is noted to probably be larger than in life due to crushing during fossilization. Both the head and thorax are a uniform dark coloration and were black in life and the mesothorax is rough in texture. The abdomen on contrast possesses large pale reddish bands which have no darkening along the margins and no spots visible. The female specimen, \\"No. 8444\\" had more strongly banded abdomen than that of the holotype male. The tip of the abdomen in the male is broadly rounded, a large section of which is occupied by the genitalia. The hind legs display flattened tarsi and the tibia have distinct and abundantly hairy scopa. The wings are clear with pale colored vein structure. The marginal cell of the wing is smaller than in the related Anthidium scudderi. Given the overall the coloration and structure of the wings, both A. exhumatum and A. scudderi have been placed in the genus Anthidium.

It infests potatoes and a number of other commercially important crops. Distribution Macrosiphum euphorbiae originated in North America but it has spread to the temperate parts of Europe and Asia and is found in all areas in which potatoes are grown. Description The wingless female potato aphid is green or occasionally pink, often with a darker dorsal stripe. It has a pear-shaped body reaching about four millimetres long. The antennae are dark at the joints between the segments and are longer than the body. They are set on outward facing tubercles. The legs are longer than in other aphids, pale green but darker at the apices. The siphunculi are pale coloured, cylindrical with dark tips and operculi, and are about one third the length of the body. The tail is sword-shaped and bears 6 to 12 hairs and is much shorter than the siphunculi. The winged female has a uniform darker coloured body and appendages and has a green abdomen. The nymphs are like miniature versions of the adults and go through several moults in the course of about ten days. The green biotype is most often found on the lower, older leaves of potato plants whereas the pink biotype had no such preference. The numerical predominance of the green biotype was greater on older plants. Biology Female potato aphids overwinter as eggs on weeds, the sprouts of potatoes in storage and on lettuce under glass. They usually emerge in April and begin feeding on perennial weeds, preferring plants in the family Chenopodiaceae. In May or early June, they migrate to potato, cabbage, tomato and others crops where they feed on shoots, the lower side of leaves, buds and flowers, often on the lower parts of the plant. They are highly polyphagous, feeding on over two hundred species in more than twenty plant families, but their preference is for plants in the family Solanaceae. The female produces up to seventy young by parthenogenesis over the course of three to six weeks and there may be ten generations over the summer. The optimum temperature for population increase is 68 ¬∞F.Barlow, C. A. 1962. The Influence of Temperature on the Growth of Experimental Populations of Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and Macrosiphium euphorbiae (Thomas) (Aphididae). Can. J. Zool. 40: 146-156. When populations build up, winged individuals are produced and fly off to infest new host plants. The production of winged individuals is also dependent on the day length, the temperature, the parent type (winged or wingless) and the generation.MacGillivray, M. E. and G. B. Anderson. 1964. The Effect of Photoperiod and Temperature on the Production of Gamic and Agamic Forms in Macrosiphium euphorbiae (Thomas). Can. J. Zool. 42: 491-510. The aphids migrate back to primary hosts in August and overwinter as eggs on weeds. In North America they are heavily parasitized by the braconid wasp Aphidius nigripes, which lays its eggs in the aphid nymphs, and these are eventually killed by the wasp larvae developing inside them. Management Various factors influence aphid populations. High temperatures or heavy rainfall may reduce infestations and the numbers are naturally controlled by predators, parasites and pathogens.Walker, G. P., L. R. Nault, and D.E. Simonet. 1984. Natural Mortality Factors Acting on Potato Aphid (Macrosiphum euphorbiae) Populations in Processing-Tomato Fields in Ohio. Environ. Entomol. 13(3): 724-732. Some plant varieties are more resistant to attack than others. In a study on tomatoes, it was shown that the aphids preferred smooth to hairy leaves and that susceptible tomato plants had higher sucrose, lower quinic acid and higher alanine and tyrosine levels.Quiros, C. F., M. A. Stevens, C. M. Rick, M. L. Kok-Yokomi. 1977. Resistance in Tomato to the Pink Form of the Potato Aphid In lettuce, butterhead varieties are mostly moderately to highly resistant to the aphid whereas crisphead varieties are susceptible.Reinink, K and F. L. Dieleman. 1989. Resistance in Lettuce to the Leaf Aphids Macrosiphum euphorbiae and Uroleucon sonchi. Ann. Appl. Biol. 115(3): 489-498. If numbers of aphids are sufficiently high, chemical control can be attempted using insecticidal soaps. This is not always effective because the aphids usually congregate on the underside of lower leaves where they are difficult to reach with sprays.Koehler, C. S., L. W. Barclay and T. M.

Following the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the Indian government initiated a program to triple the ICG force, assets and infrastructure. Both the Navy and the government recognized that the increased intake of ICG cadets would further tax the already- stretched INA facilities. This provided an added impetus for the Union Council of Ministers to approve the establishment of the ICGA in 2009. The search for a site for the academy started in earnest in 2010. Various sites were considered for the academy, the primary criterion being ample space on the coastal waterfront. The Government of Kerala was keen to host the site in the state. Consequently, the then Minister for Industries and Commerce of Kerala, , prevailed upon the Kerala Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (KINFRA) to transfer some of its unutilized land in the coastal town of Azhikkal to the ICG for the academy.

It is located about south of INA, Ezhimala, and the two maritime academies were expected to share some training infrastructure in the Kerala backwaters. But the project was dropped in 2019 following the denial of environment and CRZ (Coastal Regulation Zone) clearances by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) since the project site at Azhikkal fell within the CRZ-1(A) area where no construction is permissible.

Answers.com, Web, March 25, 2011. was a circle of Canadian modernist writers formed in the mid-1920s at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec. The Group included Leon Edel, John Glassco, A. M. Klein, Leo Kennedy, F. R. Scott, and A. J. M. Smith, most of whom attended McGill as undergraduates. The group championed the theory and practice of modernist poetry over the Victorian- style versification, exemplified by the Confederation Poets, that predominated in Canadian poetry at the time. The Montreal Group is associated with the rise of the \\"little magazines\\", which published contemporary innovative prose and poetry in the style of British and American modernism, and later works from Europe's aesthetic and decadent movements. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica credits the group and its members with having \\"precipitated a renaissance of Canadian poetry during the 1920s and ‚Äô30s ... They encouraged an emulation of the realistic themes, metaphysical complexity, and techniques of the U.S. and British poets Ezra Pound, T.S. Eliot, and W.H. Auden that resulted in an Expressionist, Modernist, and often Imagist poetry reflective of the values of an urban and cosmopolitan civilization.\\"\\"Montreal group,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Britannica.com. Web, March 25, 2011. History In the 1920s, most Canadian poetry was similar to that of English poets of the Victorian era. This style had been popularized around the time of Confederation by Charles G. D. Roberts, Bliss Carman, Archibald Lampman and Duncan Campbell Scott, and continued to prevail among Canadian poets until the early 1940s. Some Canadians, though, were writing modernist poetry: W. W. E. Ross, R. G. Everson,\\"Ronald Gilmour Everson\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia Raymond Knister, and Dorothy Livesay were each individually publishing Imagist poetry in free verse in American and English literary publications.Ken Norris, \\"The Beginnings of Canadian Modernism,\\" Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews, No. 11 (Fall/Winter, 1982), Canadian Poetry, UWO.ca, Web, March 25, 2011. Over time these poets became known as the Montreal Group. They founded a number of \\"little magazines\\" which gave Canadian modernists the opportunity to publish in their own country. As Louis Dudek and Michael Gnarowski were to write four decades later, in The Making of Modern Poetry in Canada (1967): =McGill Daily Literary Supplement= This first publication began as a weekly supplement to the McGill Daily, the university undergraduate society's newspaper, and was edited by Allan Latham, A. P. R. Coulborn, and A. J. M. Smith. It included poems, articles, and book reviews. When Scott submitted a translation of \\"an old French chanson\\", Smith printed it, and subsequently invited Scott to serve on the editorial board. The Literary Supplement contained no advertising, and after a time the students' society stopped funding it; Smith and Scott closed the Supplement and began work on an independent publication to replace it. =McGill Fortnightly Review= On November 21, 1925 the McGill Fortnightly Review published its first issue and branded itself and \\"independent journal devoted to purely literary, artistic and scientific matter.\\" The editorial board was A. P. R. Coulborn, A. B. Latham, F. R. Scott, A. J. M and managing editor Leon Edel; the manager was Montreal businessman Lou Schwartz. The journal was one of the first to publish modernist poetry and critical opinion in Canada,Marlene Alt, \\"Smith, Arthur James Marshall,\\" Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig, 2015. and was considered as rebellious in tone. The journal published the work of Leo Kennedy;Geoff Hancock, \\"McGill Fortnightly Review - (1925 ‚Äì 7),\\" Encyclopedia of Literature, JRank.org. Web, March 25, 2011. A. M. Klein's one submission was turn down because it included the word \\"soul\\", which the editors considered old-fashioned.Zailig Pollock, \\"A. M. Klein Biography - (1909‚Äì72),\\" Encyclopedia of Literature, 8117. JRank.org, Web, March 26, 2011. The name came from that bastion of Victorian tradition, the Fortnightly Review; and the first issue praised a talk Bliss Carman had given at McGill. By issue three, in which Smith offered readers an analysis of The Waste Land, the new biweekly was focused directly on the introduction of Modernism into Canadian poetry. The publication regularly criticized the Canadian Authors' Association, which the editors saw as promoting the \\"quasi-Victorian\\" verse of the times. For example, the journal's second issue derided the CAA's promotion of a Canadian \\"Book Week\\", arguing that the association should focus on the development of excellence in Canadian literature rather than the promotion of existing books regardless of quality. F. R. Scott's satirical poem ‚ÄòThe Canadian authors meet‚Äô, which claimed that the association encouraged amateurism, appeared in the last issue of the journal in 1927. The McGill Fortnightly Review published many articles and editorials about Modernism, a well as a variety of modernistic poetry. In his editorials, Smith argued that Canadian poets must go beyond the traditional poetry of Bliss Carman, Archibald Lampman, Duncan Campbell Scott, and Charles G. D. Roberts, and open themselves to contemporary forms, such as free verse, imagistic treatment, displacement, and complex poetic structure. He also urged writers to dispense with the \\"Victorian mannerisms\\" which were in common use at the time. American journalist H. L. Mencken was a major influence on the Group's prose style. Publisher Louis Schwartz, contributed an article to The McGill Fortnightly Review in which he calls Mencken \\"the creator of a new sort of writing ... Americanese of a racy bumptiousness so vivacious and interesting that he is eagerly followed by a large number of people. ... Mencken is essentially a young man's critic, violent and destructive.\\"Patricia Morley, \\"The Young Turks: A Biographer's Comment,\\" Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews No. 11 (Fall/Winter 1972), UWO, Web, April 9, 2011. The MFR provided a space for modernists to ply their craft, to learn from and teach each other. Years later, Edel wrote that \\"The McGill Fortnightly drew to it other young writers ‚Äì among them A. M. Klein, Leo Kennedy, and Leon Edel ‚Äì on whom, as well as on Scott, Smith had an enduring influence.\\"Leon Edel, \\"A.J.M. Smith Biography\\", Encyclopedia of Literature, 8711. JRank.org, Web, March 17, 2011. The writers who contributed to the publication gained editorial experience and direction, and eventually formed a new literary movement, the McGill group, consisting originally of Scott, Smith and Leo Kennedy. =Canadian Mercury= Founded in 1928, short- lived The Canadian Mercury was the first independent periodical produced by the Montreal Group. Its editorial board consisted of Jean Burton, F. R. Scott, Leo Kennedy and Felix Walter.\\" Publication was financed by Louis Schwartz, and the resulting financial security left the board free to pursue its literary agenda. Smith and Edel, doing graduate work in Edinburgh and Paris respectively, continued to contribute by mail. Unlike the McGill-affiliated publications, the Mercury solicited contributions from a wider group of Canadian writers, and was targeted to readers beyond the Montreal area. The first issue, published in December 1928, featured an essay on \\"The National Literature Problem in Canada\\" by Canadian institution Stephen Leacock. The editors continued their campaign to publish contemporary poetry and literary criticism to counter the prevailing Romantic tradition in Canada. The Canadian Mercury 's contributors represented a transitional style, as the beginnings of Canadian modernist poetry began to emerge.Alan Richards, \\"Between Tradition and Counter-Tradition: The Poems of A.J.M. Smith and F.R. Scott in The Canadian Mercury (1928-29),\\" Studies in Canadian Literature / √âtudes en litt√©rature canadienne, Volume 30, Number 1 (2005), UNB.ca. Web, March 26, 2011. The Mercury continued the modernist program begun in the Review. Attacks on the CAA continued, such as Leo Kennedy's polemic, \\"The Future of Canadian Literature,\\" in which he accused the Association of promoting \\"archaic transplanted Victorianisms. He urged young writers to look instead to the examples of Joyce, Hemingway, Shaw, Pound and Aldous Huxley in creating the future of Canadian literature. In the Mercury's final issue, Scott reviewed Bliss Carman's new book, Wild Garden (published posthumously; Carmen had died earlier in 1929), finding not one decent poem in the book. The Canadian Mercury folded in the wake of the economic Crash of 1929. =The McGilliad= This little-known successor McGill publication was founded in 1930 and ran until 1931. It was edited first by co-founder Klein, and then by Klein's friend, co-founder David Lewis (who would later lead Canada's socialist New Democratic Party). The publication's name was an obvious pun on the classic epic The Iliad - privately, Klein called it the \\"McGill Yid\\" (a pun on his and Lewis's Yiddish heritage).Joyce Boro, \\"Klein, Abraham Moses (1909-71),\\" Encyclopedia of Modern Jewish Culture, Volume 1, Bookrags.com, Web, March 27, 2011. Under Klein's editorship the McGilliad carried the first published poem by then high school student Irving Layton.Bronwyn Chester, \\"Small Magazines, Big Influence,\\" McGill Reporter, March 11, 1999, McGill.ca, Web, March 27, 2011. Under Lewis the magazine became more political: It published editorials about his anti-communist views, though the December 1930 issue included his article expressing approval of the Russian Revolution and calling for a greater understanding of the Soviet Union. =New Provinces= In the late 1920s, several of the group's core members left Montreal: Smith, Glassco, Edel, and Kennedy; however, four of the poets,(Smith, Kennedy, Klein, and Scott) came together in 1931 to begin the creation of an anthology, New Provinces: Poems by Several Authors. In 1934 they invited Toronto poets E. J. Pratt and Robert Finch to participate. The result, published in May 1936, was an anthology which epitomized modernist poetry in Canada.\\"William H. New, \\"McGill Movement,\\" Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2002), 729. Google Books, Web, March 25, 2011. For a Preface, Smith wrote a modernist manifesto that declared Canadian poetry to be dead.W.J. Keith, \\"How New was New Provinces?,\\" Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews, No. 4 (Fall/Winter, 1979). Web, March 16, 2011. The Preface was not used. (It was incorporated into the reprinted edition in 1976.)Michael Gnarowski, \\"New Provinces: Poems of Several Authors,\\" Canadian Encyclopedia (Hurtig: Edmonton, 1988), 1479. Leon Edel later declared, \\"The poems in New provinces had an impact on Canadian verse far beyond any prefatorial pronouncements: in its implicit call for new findings and new attitudes in Canadian writing, it might be likened to the effect of the Wordsworth-Coleridge Lyrical ballads in 1798 on the Romantics.... The effect of New provinces was that it established the ‚ÄòMontreal Group‚Äô as the Canadian avant-garde of its time.\\" =Preview= The Montreal literary magazine Preview was founded by F. R. Scott\\"Francis Reginald Scott,\\" Gale Encyclopedia of Biography, Answers.com, Web, March 27, 2011. and Montreal poet Patrick Anderson in March 1942; A. M. Klein and P. K. Page also became part of the editorial group.George Woodcock, \\"Northern Review,\\" Canadian Encyclopedia (Edmonton: Hurtig, 1988), 1515. Preview continued the cosmopolitan editorial policies of the McGill Fortnightly Review Its contributors showed the influence of the English poets of the 1930s.\\" In 1942, another Montreal literary magazine, First Statement was founded by Montreal poet John Sutherland), after Preview had rejected some of his poetry. In his magazine he criticized the Montreal Group as \\"too exclusive in their demand for cosmopolitan sophistication, too ready to denounce the provincial in favour of anything new from far away.\\" By this time, the Montreal Group had achieved its purposes of creating acceptance in Canada for the tenets of modernism, of encouraging Canadian poets to include elements of modernism in their work, and of developing venues for those who did so to publish their work. Many poets contributed to both Preview and First Statement; by 1945, when the two magazines merged to become Northern Review, the Group was no longer actively promoting modernism. Principles The McGill Group came together with the aim of modernizing Canadian poetry, by encouraging the inclusion of imagism and symbolism, which were already being used by poets from outside Canada, including William Butler Yeats, T. S. Eliot, H.D., Wallace Stevens, E. E. cummings and Marianne Moore. They promoted the responsibility of the poet to comment on Canadian society through realistic expression, wit and irony, rather than just lyrical descriptive passages. =Cosmopolitanism= The Smith group drew its models and its teachings from world literature. Like the Confederation Poets, the members of the Montreal Group were cosmopolitans. Although members of the Group sometimes criticized the \\"Maple Leaf school\\" of poets for being wholly dependent on an imported tradition, some detractors pointed out that they themselves usually found their influences outside Canada. =Symbolism= Smith, in a bid to set the tone for a new type of poetry, wrote about symbolism in the second issue of MFR. His essay, \\"Symbolism in Poetry,\\" argued for the need for symbolism in modern poetry, and explaining the theory and history of its use. Smith quotes Yeats, who describes the use of symbolism as 'a casting out of descriptions of nature for the sake of nature, of the moral law for the sake of the moral law, a casting out of all anecdotes and of that brooding over scientific opinion ... and of that vehemence that would make us do or not do certain things.' =Imagism= The Imagism espoused by the Montreal modernists was no different from the Imagists they took them from. In his Rejected Preface to New Provinces, Smith's discussion about the poets' attempt to \\"get rid of the facile word, the stereotyped phrase and the mechanical rhythm ...\\" and \\"to combine colloquialism and rhetoric. ...\\" was built on ideas from F. S. Flint's 1913 manifesto. Smith went on to give a definition of imagism: \\"The imagist seeks with perfect objectivity and impersonality to recreate a thing or arrest an experience as precisely and vividly and simply as possible.\\"D.M.R. Bentley, \\"Not of Things Only, but of Thought: Notes on A. J. M. Smith's Imagistic Poems\\", Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews, No. 11 (Fall/Winter 1982), UWO.ca, Web, March 28, 2011. Smith wrote a number of \\"Imagist poems\\" to illustrate the theory, the best known of which is \\"The Lonely Land\\". Some later critics noted that these poems didn't incorporate imagism as expressed by Pound and Hulme, but instead adapted imagist ideas in new ways, combining the imported practices to Canadian culture and environment. =Determinism= In Volume II No. 4 of the MFR, Smith wrote an article arguing \\"that the new poetry 'must be the result of the impingement of modern conditions upon the personality and temperament of the poet' ... whatever the poet's response to modern civilization, Smith rightly saw 'the peculiar conditions of the time [as having] forced them all to seek a new and more direct expression, to perfect a finer technique.' Smith saw the experimentation in the forms of the arts that was so prevalent in the 1910s and 1920s not as something that stemmed out of a conscious choice on the part of writers, but as a condition 'forced' upon them.\\" =Anti-Canadianism= The Montreal Group's publications rarely had anything favourable to say about the work of Canadian writers outside of their own group, and the editors often declined to read or review it. Leo Kennedy told biographer Patricia Morley in the 1970s: \\"We despised them unbeknownst, and you can quote me.\\" Or as Scott later put it, \\"it was all through us. There was the general feeling that practically all poetry ‚Äì particularly Canadian poetry ‚Äì was hardly worth looking at, that something new had to be found, new methods of expression.\\"Anne Burke, Critical Introduction , \\"Some Annotated Letters of A.J.M. Smith and Raymond Knister,\\" Canadian Poetry: Studies/Documents/Reviews, Number 11 (Fall/Winter 1982), UWO, Web, March 26, 2011. Other modernist Canadian writers, though sometimes published in the group's magazines, were never saluted or even acknowledged in its editorials. It was not until the 1940s that Smith, who at the time described Canadian literary works as backward when compared to international poetry, repudiated his stance, which he blamed on youthful ignorance. He acknowledged the work of some of his Canadian contemporaries, including W. W. E. Ross and Dorothy Livesay, and also admitted that \\"Lampman, Roberts and Carman had written some very fine poetry.\\" Legacy By the mid-1920s modernism was already firmly entrenched in both British and American literature, and would eventually have come to Canada one way or another with or without the Montreal Group. Still, the members of the Group were among the first Canadian writers to embrace its tenets, worked hard to facilitate its acceptance among Canadian writers, and went on to become well-recognized as 20th century modernist poets.Dean Irvine, \\"Montreal Group,\\" Encyclopedia of Canadian History, JRank.org. Web, March 15, 2011. Members of the group have gone on to win a Pulitzer Prize (Edel), five Governor General's Awards (Scott [2], Glassco, Klein, and Smith), three Lorne Pierce Medals (Klein, Scott, and Smith), and a National Book Award (Edel). According to the Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada, \\"the McGill group changed the standard for writing poetry in Canada, and its sense of the function of the poet and the demands of poetic craft continued to influence the writing of poetry in Canada until the end of the 20th century.\\" References=Books= * Stevens, Peter ed.
