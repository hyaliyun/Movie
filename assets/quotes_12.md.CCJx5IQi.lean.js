Mexican poet Amado Nervo wrote \\"La Raza de Bronce\\" (\\"The Bronze Race\\") as an elegiac poem in honor of former president Benito Ju√°rez in 1902. Bolivian indigenista writer Alcides Arguedas used the term in his 1919 work, La Raza de Bronce, a study of the natives of the Andean Altiplano. It was later used by Mexican luminary Jos√© Vasconcelos in La Raza C√≥smica (1925). The term was revived in the 1960s by Chicano ethnic group MEChA to refer to Hispanics in the United States and the people in Mexico as a unified \\"race\\", similar to the black and white races. In this sense it is largely synonymous to the notion of the Chicano nation.

Early life He was born to Jonetta Kelker, a nurse, and Robert Kelly, a pathologist. He has 3 sisters. His parents divorced when he was 7 years old, and he moved in with his dad. At 11, when his father remarried, Kelker-Kelly, \\"jealous\\" of this new love, moved back with his mother. Three months later his dad died at 42 from a heart attack. Kelker- Kelly attended Wichita Collegiate School in Wichita, Kansas from 1977‚Äì80, where he was active in the theatre and had major roles in several plays, including Rusty in Guys and Dolls, Bill Sikes in Oliver! and Sir Lionel in Camelot. He briefly attended the University of Kansas but decided to forgo college in favor of pursuing his acting career. In 1988, he married Linda Rattner; the couple divorced in 1992. After dating actress Miriam Parrish for years, the couple married in 1997. The same year he left Los Angeles and his acting career briefly behind. He earned a certification in airframe and powerplant mechanics. From 2002-03 he was an acting teacher at the Pioneer Valley Performing Arts Charter Public School in South Hadley, Massachusetts. Kelker-Kelly became a professional pilot, working in that field from 2003-15. He is type rated in the GIV, LR60, LR45, CE560 and CE500. He is still an active pilot and teaches people how to fly. Career Kelker made his acting debut in 1987 as Sam Fowler on the soap opera Another World, a role he originally played from 1987-90. The character of Sam was involved in a front- burner story with socialite Amanda Cory. In 1992, Kelker-Kelly was chosen to portray Bo Brady, an established role on Days of Our Lives that was being vacated by the creator of the role, actor Peter Reckell.

Massachusetts retained the northern bank of Merrimack River and the towns of Salisbury and Haverhill were added to Essex County.

It is located on the eastern edge of the city's Financial District (east of Yonge Street) in the St. Lawrence neighbourhood, wedged between Front Street and Wellington Street in Downtown Toronto, where they join up to form a triangular intersection. Completed in 1892, the red-brick edifice was an early example of a prominent flatiron building. The Gooderham Building is the focal point of one of Toronto's most iconic vistas: looking west down Front Street towards the building's prominent rounded corner, framed on the sides by the heritage commercial blocks along Front Street, and with the skyscrapers of the Financial District towering in the background. The CN Tower is also visible from certain angles behind Brookfield Place. This vista frequently appears in imagery of the city. History The Gooderham Building, c. 1895. The previous building on the site was shorter, but in the same shape, and it was called the Coffin Block. The current building was designed by architect David Roberts Jr. and originally cost $18,000 to construct for distiller George Gooderham Sr. (1830‚Äì1905),Dean Beeby, ‚ÄúGOODERHAM, GEORGE,‚Äù in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 13, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003‚Äì, accessed October 11, 2015. a son of the Gooderham and Worts distillery's founder, William Gooderham. The building served as the office of the Gooderham and Worts distillery until 1952, and it was sold by the Gooderham family in 1957. Bought in 1975 and saved (and partially restored) by David Walsh and Robert Phillips, further restoration took place in 1998 by owners Michael and Anne Tippin. The building was designated a historic site under the Ontario Heritage Act in 1975, then the Ontario Heritage Foundation attained a Heritage Easement in 1977. It was subsequently owned and managed by the Woodcliffe Corporation. On 12 October 2011, the Woodcliffe Corporation announced that it would be selling the building. Previously, the building had sold for $10.1 million in 2005, and for $2.2 million in 1999.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/toronto/torontos-iconic- flatiron-building-up-for-sale/article2198680/ The building is currently owned and managed by The Commercial Realty Group. Architecture and art The Flatiron Mural by Derek Michael Besant is located at the back wall of the building. The Gooderham Building is well-known both for its narrow wedge shape and for the mural on its back wall. The Flatiron Mural by renowned Canadian artist Derek Michael Besant uses a trompe l'oeil effect to not only make the wall appear to have more windows than it does, but to also give it a more mobile effect by having its edges 'fluttering' away where they are not 'tacked' down. It is a picture of the Perkins Building, which is located directly across the street. The building has a Romanesque cornice and frieze above the arched windows on the 4th floor. The main entrance located on Wellington Street makes use of a French Gothic archway. The foundation is made of sandstone. The steep copper roof has eight gable dormers: four on the south facade and four on the north facade. With its linear pattern of fenestration distributed equally on all floors, it conveys a light feeling of a corporate office building. The Gooderham Building is set on a high foundation that reaches half a storey above the ground. These days, it is still being used as an office building. The 1st floor uses rectangular sliding windows on the south side, but it has fixed windows on the north side. Conversely, on the 2nd floor, it uses fixed windows on the south side and rectangular sliders on the north side. On the 3rd, 4th and 5th floors, the Gooderham Building has single- hung and arch-hung windows. The Gooderham Building has three entrances. Two of the entrances lead to the pub in the basement known as The Flatiron and Firkin. Entrance doors are in pairs, and have wooden frames for windows. The pub in the basement has a large patio around the south side of the building. Entrances for the pub are located in the basement and the 1st floor on the Front Street side. There is no public access to the pub from the building. The entrance for the Flatiron Building is located on the north side, and is made up of fanciful pinnacle dormers and arch frames with French Gothic styling. Berczy Park Berczy Park is a small park situated behind the Gooderham Building. Berczy Park is a small park located behind the Gooderham Building at Front Street and Wellington Street in Toronto.

Thereafter, a tree-lined city park was added and renovations, completed in 2017, added a large three- tier fountain designed by Montreal landscape architect Claude Cormier.

Dulce de leche is Spanish for \\"candy [made] of milk\\". Dulce de Leche is similar to \\"manjar de leche\\" (or just \\"manjar\\"), the difference being that manjar is thicker, less sweet, and darker in colour. Preparation and uses Muffins with dulce de leche sauce The most basic recipe calls for slowly simmering milk and sugar, stirring almost constantly. Once the mixture thickens and turns the color of caramel it is done. At this point, one must be careful not to burn it. Another method calls for letting a gallon of milk stand in room temperature for an entire 24 hours. The gasses will spoil the milk and what is left is curd and whey. This is then boiled, causing the solids to flow to the top. The solids are removed and sugar is added. This mixture is stirred until it becomes hard, after which it is removed from the heat and left to cool. After it cools, it is broken up for consumption. Out of a gallon, this method yields about two cups. Other ingredients such as vanilla may be added for flavor. Much of the water in the milk evaporates and the mix thickens; the resulting dulce de leche is usually about a sixth of the volume of the milk used. The transformation that occurs in preparation is caused by a combination of two common browning reactions called caramelization and the Maillard reaction. A homemade form of dulce de leche sometimes is made by boiling an unopened can of sweetened condensed milk for two to three hours (or 30 to 45 minutes in a pressure cooker), particularly by those living in countries where it cannot be bought ready-made. This results in a product that is much sweeter than the slow-boiled kind. This method could be dangerous, and should not be done on a stove: if the pot is allowed to boil dry, the can will overheat and explode. Dulce de leche can be eaten alone or used to flavor candies or other sweet foods, such as cakes, churros, cookies (see alfajor), waffles, cr√®me caramel (known as flan in Spanish-speaking regions and pudim in Portuguese- speaking ones), and ice creams; it is also a popular spread on crepes (panqueques) and toast, while the French confiture de lait is commonly served with fromage blanc.

Historical group Henry Clay, one of the most important members of the War Hawks or leader of the war hawks. The term \\"war hawk\\" was coined in 1792 and was often used to ridicule politicians who favored a pro-war policy in peacetime. Historian Donald R. Hickey found 129 uses of the term in American newspapers before late 1811, mostly from Federalists warning against Republican foreign policy. Some antiwar Republicans used it, such as Virginia Congressman John Randolph of Roanoke.Donald R. Hickey, \\"War Hawks\\": Using Newspapers to Trace a Phrase, 1792-1812\\" Journal of Military History (2014) 78#2 pp 725-740.

However, most historians use the term to describe about one or two dozen members of the Twelfth Congress. The leader of this faction was Speaker of the House Henry Clay of Kentucky. John C. Calhoun of South Carolina was another notable War Hawk. Both of these men became major players in American politics for decades. Other men traditionally identified as War Hawks include Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky, William Lowndes of South Carolina, Langdon Cheves of South Carolina, Felix Grundy of Tennessee, and William W. Bibb of Georgia. President James Madison set the legislative agenda for Congress, providing committees in the House of Representatives with policy recommendations to be introduced as bills on the House floor. Variations of the term In modern American usage \\"hawk\\" refers to a fierce advocate for a cause or policy, such as \\"deficit hawk\\" or \\"privacy hawk\\". It may also refer to a person or political leader who favors a strong or aggressive military policy, though not necessarily outright war. The term has also been expanded into \\"chicken hawk\\", referring to a war hawk who avoided military service. The term \\"liberal hawk\\" is a derivation of the traditional phrase, in the sense that it denotes an individual with \\"socially liberal\\" inclinations coupled with an aggressive outlook on foreign policy.

Drafted at the University of California Santa Barbara, it is a blueprint for the inception of Chicana/o studies programs in colleges and universities throughout the US.El Plan de Santa Barbara; a Chicano Plan for Higher Education, 1 February 2013, La Causa Publications. The Chicano Coordinating Council expresses political mobilization to be dependent upon political consciousness, thus the institution of education is targeted as the platform to raise political conscious amongst Chicanos and spur higher learning to political action. The Plan proposes a curriculum in Chicano studies, the role of community control in Chicano education and the necessity of Chicano political independence. The document was a framework for educational and curriculum goals for the Chicano movements within the institution of education, while being the foundation for the Chicano student group Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztl√°n (MEChA). The plan itself begins with a manifesto which calls for a renaissance and a \\"quest for cultural expression and freedom\\" and continues by pushing back against racist power structures and assimilation and a push toward the importance of community and pride in Chicanismo. The manifesto asks the colleges and universities within state of California to act in the following areas: :1. Admission and recruitment of Chicano students, faculty, administrators, and staff; :2. A curriculum program and an academic major relevant to the Chicano cultural and historical experience; :3. Support and tutorial programs; :4. Research programs; :5. Publications programs; and :6. Community, cultural, and social action programs. Finally, it calls for students, faculty, employees and the community to come together as \\"central and decisive designers and administrators of these programs\\". Following the manifesto, the document lays out a plan for organizing Chicano programs; recruitment and admissions, support programs, curriculum, political action, the outline of the degrees offered including a Bachelor of Arts and an associate degree, and proposed courses including those for Chicano history, contemporary politics of the Southwest, and Mexican American sociology. The document closes with an outline of a Barrio Center program which aims to reach out to students outside of the colleges and universities in regards to dissemination of college entrance information, community engagement and the presence of on-going research proposed by Chicano scholars. Throughout the plan are pictures of those in the Chicano movement as well as art drawn by members of MEChA. This manifesto was adopted in April 1969.  Critical Response  Indigenous history and traditional myths were used in the Chicano movement to create a nationalist political identity based on reclaiming cultures and histories.They were also purposed to imagine Aztl√°n, the mythical homeland for Chicana/o people, as both a physical place and a nexus for change in educational and academic communities. The concept of Aztl√°n is given a home in higher education, as those who created this plan were ‚Äústudents, faculty, administrators, and community delegates representing‚Ä¶La Alta California, Aztl√°n.‚ÄùEl Plan de Santa Barbara; a Chicano Plan for Higher Education (PDF). This text includes myriad references to ‚ÄúLa Raza de Aztl√°n‚Äù and indigenous ways of knowing across subjects. Proposed curricula include indigenous histories of science, sociology, architecture, and music, among many other subjects. Because of this, some argue that the Chicano movement was exemplified and institutionalized through projects like El Plan de Santa B√°rbara. Imagining the future of education is described as a matter of social justice for Chicana/o authors, as it is a way for them to imagine a world outside of colonial constructs. Thus, professors, students, and administrators from UC Santa Barbara and Chicana/o Studies departments across the country reference El Plan de Santa B√°rbara as a key player in the institutionalization of Chicano ideology and its recognition across the Southwest and within the academic community. Given the context of Chicana/o exclusion in academia, this plan is described as an explicit call for equity.  Critiques  Despite the emphasis on equality in higher education curricula, the androcentrism and heteronormativity of the Chicano movement is recognized and critiqued as a site for future improvement in which a diverse Chicana/o population can be included. Academics of Chicana/o Studies argue that the exclusion of women and the LGBT community in Chicano manifestos such as El Plan de Santa B√°rbara and El Plan Espiritual de Aztl√°n embody the limitations of the future this movement was working towards, as it was exclusionary. Chicana feminism is explained as a response to the limitations of texts like El Plan de Santa B√°rbara, such that Chicana feminists had to work to reassert overlooked identities in contemporary and future discussions of Chicana/o movements for social change. UC Santa Barbara‚Äôs Office of Public Affairs and Communications maintains that the work of the movement is still in progress, and professors argue that, while El Plan has solidified the presence of Chicana/o Studies in higher education, further implementation of the original plan‚Äôs true intentions of community-building will lead to more inclusive representation of Chicana/o students.

It was adopted by the First National Chicano Liberation Youth Conference, a March 1969 convention hosted by Rodolfo Gonzales's Crusade for Justice in Denver, Colorado. Background In 1848 the Mexican-American War created the Xicano with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo on Feb 2, of that year. In a land colonized by three European nations (Spain, France and the United States), the original occupants of these lands began to rebuild their own national identity, an identity focused on ancient ties to the occupied Americas and indigeneity. Ernesto Mireles says, ‚ÄúFor the portion of the Xicano/a community engaged in resistance writing, the necessities of survival under colonial rule have overshadowed Aztl√°n and its mythology for centuries.‚Äù The tie to the land known as Aztlan (Southwest United States, Northern Mexico) had emerged in the contemporary Xicano Movement as a pre- Cuauhtemoc trope and gives claim of this occupied territory to Xicano and Indigenous peoples. Beginning with the Chicano power movement of the 1960s and 70s the Xicano re-emerged as indigenous and no longer a foreigner of their own land. The Xicano power movement of the 1960s and 1970s was a continuation of the centuries-old question surrounding the natural inheritance of indigenous people and national identity. This conversation around Indigenous national liberation and the expulsion of foreign invaders has a long history over the past 500 years. The Provisional Directorate of the Plan of San Diego, Texas written in 1915 states, ‚Äúwe will arise in arms against the government, and country of the United Stated of North America, one as all and all as one, proclaiming the liberty of the individuals of the black race and its independence of yankee tyranny which has held us in iniquitous slavery since remote times‚Äù. This plan was written as the battle of the west started to come to a close and the settling was almost done. This is one declaration of a sovereignty prior to the plan de Aztlan by a formerly sovereign people that continues the discussion of natural inheritance.  National liberation  El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan is about national liberation. Aztlan is only good to build power for the Xicano Movement. As Corky Gonzalez quotes, ‚ÄùThe publication of a revolutionary paper is equal to the taking of a city. The proclamation of a political plan is the same as the bloodiest combat. . . they form equal parts of a rebellion and are inherent in it. . . I have never seen, nor will I ever see a revolution without the propagation of ideas as a preliminary, and the shedding of blood, as the inevitable means of deciding the outcome‚ÄùRodolfo ‚ÄúCorky‚Äù Gonzalez series, box 10, Special Collections and Archives in Denver Public Library Cultural and political mobilization is the goal of this document. The idea of Aztlan has survived numerous conquests and hundreds of years of settler-colonial oppression which means the tie to land and indigeneity is the engine to mobilization. The goal of national mobilization is to create a nation a return to history. Declaring full sovereignty of the south west from the settler nation of America. The revolutionary caucus of the 1969 Chicano Youth Conference states, ‚ÄúWe, a non- conquered people living in a conquered land, come together hoping that a plan of liberation, a concrete revolutionary program acceptable to the entire southwest, will from this conference. Subjected to a system that has denied our human dignity, our rights are also being denied under a constitution which we had no part in formulating but more fundamentally the rights protected under the Guadalupe-Hidalgo treaty which grants the right to cultural autonomy have been violated. For 144 years we have been trying to peacefully coexist yet no peace has come to our communities. Revolution is the only means available to us. We owe no allegiance, no respect, to any of the laws of this racist country. Our liberation struggle is a war of Survival.‚Äù The Revolutionary caucus is calling for action such as described in El Plan Espiritual de Aztlan. They are calling for the complete succession of Xicano and Indigenous land from a nation that does not recognize them as fully human. Succession only works with the complete national sovereignty of a people and fully removed for the structure created to oppress the Indigenous / Xicano. The creation of a new national identity and the creation of a nation. It is laid out by Gonzalez as, ‚ÄúLa Crusada Para La Justicia exists as an expression of some members of La Raza consciously creating social systems that are parallel to and independent of the anglo systems imposed by war, annexation, and conquest. It offers a wide range of services: education, counseling, legal, medical, and financial: it focuses as a center for art, music, and drama: it builds barrio identity, political power, economic muscle.‚Äù This statement offers Xicanos / Xicanas a basis of what to accomplish and how to build power for the Xicano / Indigenous communities. Aztlan is firmly the idea of indigeneity and natural inheritance to a land stolen by occupying power. Aztlan gives the Xicano / Indigenous community power to build national liberation movement. Rodolfo Gonzalez writes, ‚ÄúAztlan, a mythical land of the Aztecs? Aztlan an abstract illusion of a Nation? Aztlan a common denominator that la gente de La Raza, the mestizo, the Chicano can agree upon is not based on a phantasma of romantic delusions it is conceived on the foundations of history and the reality of its existence can and will be proven by law; not a law based on political courts of injustice and cold anglo legalities, but based on human fact and historical inheritance.‚Äù Aztlan may be to build power, and this power is based on historical facts and rightness. The land of the Mexica, Dine, Hopi, Apache, Yaqui, Yavapai, and many more.  Organizational goals  This list of organizational goals is pulled directly from the El Plan de Aztlan document itself. \\"1. UNITY in the thinking of our people concerning the barrios, the pueblo, the campo, the land, the poor, the middle class, the professional-all committed to the liberation of La Raza. 2\\\\. ECONOMY: economic control of our lives and our communities can only come about by driving the exploiter out of our communities, our pueblos, and our lands and by controlling and developing our own talents, sweat, and resources. Cultural background and values which ignore materialism and embrace humanism will contribute to the act of cooperative buying and the distribution of resources and production to sustain an economic base for healthy growth and development Lands rightfully ours will be fought for and defended. Land and realty ownership will be acquired by the community for the people's welfare. Economic ties of responsibility must be secured by nationalism and the Chicano defense units. 3\\\\. EDUCATION must be relative to our people, i.e., history, culture, bilingual education, contributions, etc. Community control of our schools, our teachers, our administrators, our counselors, and our programs. 4\\\\. INSTITUTIONS shall serve our people by providing the service necessary for a full life and their welfare on the basis of restitution, not handouts or beggar's crumbs. Restitution for past economic slavery, political exploitation, ethnic and cultural psychological destruction and denial of civil and human rights. Institutions in our community which do not serve the people have no place in the community. The institutions belong to the people. 5\\\\. SELF-DEFENSE of the community must rely on the combined strength of the people. The front line defense will come from the barrios, the campos, the pueblos, and the ranchitos. Their involvement as protectors of their people will be given respect and dignity. They in turn offer their responsibility and their lives for their people. Those who place themselves in the front ranks for their people do so out of love and carnalismo. Those institutions which are fattened by our brothers to provide employment and political pork barrels for the gringo will do so only as acts of liberation and for La Causa. For the very young there will no longer be acts of juvenile delinquency, but revolutionary acts. 6\\\\. CULTURAL values of our people strengthen our identity and the moral backbone of the movement. Our culture unites and educates the family of La Raza towards liberation with one heart and one mind. We must insure that our writers, poets, musicians, and artists produce literature and art that is appealing to our people and relates to our revolutionary culture. Our cultural values of life, family, and home will serve as a powerful weapon to defeat the gringo dollar value system and encourage the process of love and brotherhood. 7\\\\. POLITICAL LIBERATION can only come through independent action on our part, since the two-party system is the same animal with two heads that feed from the same trough. Where we are a majority, we will control; where we are a minority, we will represent a pressure group; nationally, we will represent one party: La Familia de La Raza!\\" Origin and adoption During the conference, a young poet named Alurista, born in Mexico but raised in San Diego, took the stage. To a captivated audience, he read the words, > In the spirit of a new people that is conscious not only of its proud > historical heritage but also of the brutal \\"gringo\\" invasion of our > territories, we, the Chicano inhabitants and civilizers of the northern land > of Aztlan from whence came our forefathers, reclaiming the land of their > birth and consecrating the determination of our people of the sun, declare > that the call of our blood is our power, our responsibility, and our > inevitable destiny. The poem, El Plan Espiritual de Aztl√°n, became the title of the manifesto, and the poem became its preamble. Alurista went on to become the \\"poet laureate of Aztl√°n\\".

The Nicholas Tower, now the second tallest building in Trinidad and Tobago, is under construction to the right of the image. Eric Williams Plaza, also known as the Eric Williams Financial Complex, located on Independence Square, Port of Spain, consists of two of the tallest buildings in Trinidad and Tobago, as well as in the English-speaking Caribbean. It consists of a pair of skyscrapers 22 stories high and 302 ft (92 m) tall, locally known as the \\"Twin Towers\\". Construction on the complex started in 1979 and ended in 1986. The complex was officially opened on March 29, 1986. The architect who managed the construction was Anthony C. Lewis Partnership. The Eric Williams Plaza was named after Eric Williams, the first prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago. The first tower houses the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago while the second tower houses the Ministry of Finance. The first tower's official name is Eric Williams Financial Tower and the second tower's official name is the Central Bank Tower. The building surrounding the towers is the old Central Bank. The old Central Bank building has gold and currency vaults, administrative areas, an auditorium and a concert hall. It is one of the finest facilities in the country. It is also part of the complex. Both towers contain building security, communications, and life-safety systems. The towers have an earthquake resistant design. The cross braces and core walls in both towers are designed to take earthquake forces with the former taking 15% of the forces and the latter taking 85%. Additionally, great care was taken in the detailing of the reinforcement. The thickness of the basement under each tower is 25'. The pile cap under each tower is a cellular raft which is a combination of 9' √ó 6' beams and an 18\\" slab. Water storage for the complex is located in the basements of the towers. The building is located on the Brian Lara Promenade, Independence Square (formerly Marine Square) in downtown Port of Spain. It was the tallest building in Trinidad and Tobago until the Nicholas Tower was constructed by businessman Issa Nicholas. From 1993 to January 1999, the office of the Prime Minister was housed here; in 1999 it was returned to the Whitehall. Central Bank Auditorium The Central Bank Auditorium constructed in 1986 still stands as one of the finest facilities of its type in the country. The facility was constructed not only to serve the Bank's needs, but also as a civic contribution aimed at enhancing the performing arts in Trinidad and Tobago. The Auditorium is located at the South-East corner of the Central Bank building. It has a seating capacity for 400 and provides computerised lighting and sound controls. The Auditorium also boasts of an infra-red listening system designed to facilitate the hearing impaired. The Lights The lighting system comprises some of the top brand names in the world of theatrical lighting. An ETC Expression 3 Lighting Console is at the head of the system with an array of lighting fixtures by manufacturers such as Colortran, Altman, Rainbow, Clay Paky and ETC Source Fours, High End. A 96 dimmer per circuit system exists. These circuits are distributed along the balcony rail, side ports, forestage grid and deck. The Sound The Central Bank Auditorium is at the forefront of the industry, being the only theatre in the country with a Digital Audio Workstation composed of Digidesign and MacIntosh systems. Two Tascam DM24 Digital Consoles head the list of highly professional audio equipment used at the Auditorium. The Auditorium also has an array of microphones, tape machines and amplifiers. The Auditorium also boasts of an Infra-Red Listening System designed to facilitate the hearing impaired. The Dressing Rooms Refurbishing of the Dressing Room area has recently been completed, with a more modern layout and comfort to performers. Performances onstage can be monitored in both the Dressing Rooms and Green Room areas via ideally located video and audio monitors. Intercom service is also provided in these areas.

The eccentric owner of the Wonka Chocolate Factory, he has been portrayed by Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp in film. Appearances  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  In Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Wonka has hidden five Golden Tickets inside his chocolate bars. The finders are rewarded with a tour of his factory, each accompanied by an adult of their choice, and a lifetime supply of chocolate. The children are unaware, though, that the tour is also a competition to test their moral character. As the tour proceeds, four of the children are eliminated, leaving Charlie Bucket the winner. At this point, Wonka reveals that the real prize is the factory itself, as he needs someone to take it over and look after the Oompa-Loompas who work there once he retires. In 1971, the film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder as the title character, the Oompa Loompas were orange-skinned with green wigs and interestingly-styled hair. Their eyebrows were bushy and white, making for a stark contrast to their citrus-colored skin.  Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator  Wonka goes aboard the Great Glass Elevator with Charlie and his family and links up with the Space Hotel USA. The Space Hotel tracks the Elevator down back to Wonka's factory. Wonka then goes with Charlie and his family to the White House in the United States.  Adaptations   Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory  Willy Wonka (portrayed by Gene Wilder) has hidden five Golden Tickets amongst his famous Wonka Bars. The finders of these special tickets will be given a full tour of his tightly guarded candy factory, as well as a lifetime supply of chocolate. During the tour, Wonka tempts each of the bad children to disobey his orders with something related to their individual character flaws. One by one, each child disappears from the tour, until eventually Charlie Bucket is the only remaining child. However, Charlie and Grandpa Joe have also succumbed to temptation by this time and sampled Fizzy Lifting Drinks, Mr. Wonka's experimental line of beverages that gives the drinker the power to float temporarily. The drinks, still too strong, brought Charlie and Grandpa Joe close to death. Wonka informs Charlie that the tour is over, abruptly dismisses him and Grandpa Joe, and disappears into his office without mentioning the promised grand prize of a lifetime supply of chocolate. They both go into Wonka's office to confront him. Grandpa Joe asks about the prize, but Wonka tells him that Charlie will not receive it because he broke the rules, angrily referring to the forfeiture clause of the contract that the ticket holders signed at the start of the tour. Charlie's drinking of the Fizzy Lifting Drinks amounted to theft, so he violated the contract and gets nothing. Wonka then dismisses them with a furious, \\"Good day, sir!\\" Grandpa Joe angrily berates him for destroying his grandson's hopes, but Wonka is unmoved and angrily dismisses him again. Grandpa Joe vows to get revenge on Wonka by selling the Everlasting Gobstopper to Slugworth (Wonka's main rival), but Charlie decides to return the Gobstopper to Wonka's desk. Wonka joyfully tells him that he has passed his test, reinstates his grand prize, apologizes for putting Charlie through the ordeal, and reveals that Slugworth, who had been spying on the kids, was actually his own employee in disguise. The trio enter the Great Glass Elevator, which goes high into the sky as Wonka reveals that the grand prize is really the entire factory and business, which Charlie will get when Wonka retires, and in the meantime Charlie and his whole family will move into the factory. Wonka reminds Charlie not to forget what happened to the man who got everything that he ever wanted: \\"He lived happily ever after.\\"  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  Willy Wonka (portrayed by Johnny Depp as an adult and by Blair Dunlop in his youth), the owner of a famous chocolate factory. Due to problems concerning industrial espionage, he has fired all his employees, among them Charlie's Grandpa Joe, and barred all public access to his factory for years. Wonka announces a contest in which five Golden tickets have been hidden under the wrappers of Wonka Bars throughout the world. The finders will each receive a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of chocolate; in addition, one winner will receive a special prize at the end of the tour. Charlie is the last to find a ticket. On the day of the tour, Wonka greets the winners and the adults accompanying them at the factory gates and leads them through the compound. One by one, all of the children except Charlie succumb to temptations offered by Wonka and are removed from the tour. Wonka offers Charlie a chance to live and work with him in the factory, explaining that the purpose of the contest was to find a successor to take over as owner once he retires. However, Wonka expects Charlie to leave his family forever, seeing family as a hindrance to a chocolatier's creative freedom. Wonka's attitude stems from his own childhood, in which his dentist father, Dr. Wilbur Wonka, forbade him to eat any candy and made him wear a large, cumbersome set of braces in order to keep his teeth in good condition. Wonka secretly sampled some candy one day and was instantly enthralled, running away from home in order to pursue a career in making it. When he returned home years later, he found that Wilbur had moved the entire house to an unknown location. Charlie rejects the offer, prompting Wonka to fall into a deep depression that saps his creativity and causes his business to suffer. With Charlie's help, Wonka locates Wilbur and finds that the latter is genuinely proud of him, having saved every news clipping of Wonka's success. The two reconcile, and Wonka invites the entire Bucket family to live in the factory. Gobstopper In a trailer for the faux horror film Gobstopper, Willy Wonka (portrayed by Christopher Lloyd) is a psychotic serial killer who lured a group of teenagers into his factory to use them as a secret ingredient for his products, and attempts to murder them with the help of a couple of cannibalistic Oompa-Loompas. He previously tried to kill Slugworth and trapped him in the factory. 2013 musical adaptation In 2013, an adaptation of the novel was produced in Theatre Royal Drury Lane starting on 25 June 2013. Willy Wonka in this production was originated by Douglas Hodge. In the play, Wonka decides to open his factory to five children whom can find one of five Golden Tickets hidden in the wrappers of Wonka Bars. The play begins with Charlie in a large trash pile looking for items that are \\"almost nearly perfect\\". He later goes home and we see the Golden Ticket winners on an oversized television with actors inside it. Once all the tickets have been won, Willy Wonka invites the children into his factory, where he then tempts each of them with a weakness. Finally, only Charlie is left.

The main storyline is largely taken verbatim from the 1971 film, and thus Wonka (voiced by JP Karliak) is portrayed largely the same as in that adaptation. During the tour, Wonka becomes suspicious that one of the guests has smuggled a cat into the factory after seeing bits of fur left by Tom, who along with Jerry had previously been adopted by Charlie, and snuck into the factory in an attempt to stop what they believe to be Slugworth plotting to steal it from Wonka. Wonka eventually notices Tom and Jerry's presence, and accuses Charlie of smuggling them into the factory (along with his theft of the Fizzy Lifting Drinks) in order to justify denying him the lifetime's supply of chocolate, though this also turns out to be part of the same test that Charlie was put through. Additionally, this version confirms that Wonka and \\"Slugworth\\" had intended from the very start to make Charlie the next owner of the factory, something that is left ambiguous by the other versions of the story. Concept and creation 2005 film adaptation A person cosplaying as Willy Wonka, as depicted in the 2005 film Early on in the production of the 2005 film, Nicolas Cage was under discussions for portraying Willy Wonka, but lost interest. Warner Bros. president Alan F. Horn wanted Tom Shadyac to direct Jim Carrey as Willy Wonka, believing the duo could make Charlie and the Chocolate Factory relevant to mainstream audiences, but Roald Dahl's widow Liccy Dahl opposed this. After Tim Burton was hired as director in May 2003, Burton immediately thought of Johnny Depp for the role of Willy Wonka, who joined the following August for his fourth collaboration with the director. Burton and screenwriter John August worked together in creating Wilbur Wonka, Willy's domineering dentist father. \\"You want a little bit of the flavor of why Wonka is the way he is,\\" Burton reasoned. \\"Otherwise, what is he? He's just a weird guy.\\" Warner Bros. and Burton held differences over the characterization of Willy Wonka. The studio wanted to make Willy Wonka the idyllic father figure Charlie Bucket had longed for his entire life. Burton believed that Wonka would not be a good father, finding the character similar to a recluse. \\"In some ways,\\" Burton protested, \\"he's more screwed up than the kids.\\" Johnny Depp was the only actor that Burton had considered for the role. He signed on without reading the script, under the intention of going with a completely different approach than what Gene Wilder did in the 1971 film adaptation. \\"Regardless of what one thinks of that film,\\" Depp explained, \\"Gene Wilder's persona, his character, stands out.\\" Depp stated on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that he based the character on what he believed an \\"incredibly stoned\\" George W. Bush would act like. Comparisons were drawn between Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson, due to Wonka's more childish demeanour. Burton joked, \\"Here's the deal. There's a big difference: Michael Jackson likes children, Willy Wonka can't stand them. To me that's a huge difference in the whole persona thing.\\" Depp explained that the similarities with Jackson never even occurred to him. \\"I say if there was anyone you'd want to compare Wonka to it would be a Howard Hughes, almost. Reclusive, germaphobe, controlling.\\" Burton agreed with the Hughes similarities, and additionally supplied Charles Foster Kane in Citizen Kane as inspiration. \\"Somebody who was brilliant but then was traumatized and then retreats into their own world.\\" Depp wanted to sport prosthetic makeup for the part and have a long, elongated nose, but Burton believed that it would be too outrageous. Critical analysis Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka was well received and remains one of his best-known roles.

It dominated Hong Kong box office sales from the 1970s to 1980sChu, Yingchi. [2003] (2003). Hong Kong Cinema: Coloniser, Motherland and Self. Routledge. and played a major role in introducing Hong Kong films to the Western market, especially those by Bruce Lee (Concord Production Inc.), Jackie Chan, and Sammo Hung. History Notable names in the company include its founders, the veteran film producers Raymond Chow () and Leonard Ho (). Chow and Ho were executives with Hong Kong's top studio Shaw Brothers but left in 1970 to form their own studio. They succeeded by taking a different approach from the highly centralised Shaw model. Golden Harvest contracted with independent producers and gave talent more generous pay and greater creative freedom. Some filmmakers and actors from Shaw Brothers defected. But what really put the company on the map was a 1971 deal with soon-to-be martial arts superstar Bruce Lee with the film The Big Boss, after he had turned down the low-paying standard contract offered him by the Shaws. In 1973, Golden Harvest entered into a pioneering co-production with Hollywood for the English-language Bruce Lee film, Enter the Dragon (), a worldwide hit made with the Warner Brothers studio and Concord Production Inc. Following Lee's death, Golden Harvest found success with the Hui Brothers' comedies such as Games Gamblers Play (1974), The Last Message (1975), The Private Eyes (1976), The Contract (1978) and Security Unlimited (1981). Golden Harvest supplanted Shaw Brothers as Hong Kong's dominant studio by the end of the 1970s and retained that position into the 1990s. Its greatest asset for years was that from the 1980s until very recently, it produced almost all of the films of Jackie Chan. Golden Harvest has also produced a number of films with Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Golden Harvest also produced The Cannonball Run and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles trilogy in the United States. In 1992, Golden Village, a 50:50 joint venture between Golden Harvest and Village Roadshow of Australia was set up to develop and operate modern, multiplex cinemas in Singapore. In 1993, Golden Harvest sold its film library to Star TV. Golden Harvest was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1994. Golden Harvest's activity has declined since the death of Leonard Ho in 1998. In 2003, they withdrew from film-making to concentrate on film financing, distribution, and cinema management in Hong Kong and in Mainland China. In 2004, Li Ka-shing and EMI became shareholders of the company. In 2007, Raymond Chow sold the company to Chinese businessman Wu Kebo, who owns the China-based Orange Sky Entertainment Group. In early 2009, Golden Harvest merged with Orange Sky and was renamed Orange Sky Golden Harvest (). From 2009 to 2011 it was operated by Kelvin Wu King Shiu who become the CEO of the company. At that time Golden Harvest announced their relaunch and previewed a new trailer set for movies in 2010. In October 2017, Golden Harvest acquired the other 50% stake of Golden Harvest from its joint venture partner, Village Roadshow, and therefore having full ownership of Golden Village. This was after a prior bid by Singapore- based media mini-conglomerate MM2 Asia to acquire the Village Roadshow stake in June 2017, as Village Roadshow failed to secure the approval of Golden Harvest. It is unknown whether the Village name will be dropped from Golden Village as a result of the acquisition. Cinemas Harbour City Orange Sky Golden Harvest has cinemas not only in Hong Kong, but also in Mainland China, Taiwan, and Singapore. Most of these are joint ventures. Golden Village, now fully owned by Orange Sky Golden Harvest, was a former joint venture with Village Roadshow responsible for the operation of Gold Class cinemas and Asia's first multiplex. In Malaysia, the group was instrumental in the formation of the country's two largest cinema chains: Golden Screen Cinemas, a joint venture with Malaysia's PPB Group who bought out Golden Harvest's stake for full ownership, and TGV Cinemas (formerly Tanjong Golden Village), a joint venture with Tanjong of Malaysia and Village Roadshow of Australia, the former having bought out the remaining stakes for full ownership.

Life and career Vesta Victoria was born Victoria Lawrence at 8 Ebenezer Place in Leeds, Yorkshire on 26 November 1873. Her parents, Joe and Emma (n√©e Thompson), were themselves entertainers, and she made her stage debut aged six weeks in one of her father's sketches. Billed as \\"Baby Victoria\\" until nearly ten years of age, she was \\"Little Victoria\\" by her first London appearance in 1883. The painter Walter Sickert (1860‚Äì1942) made a portrait of her performing ‚Äì Vesta Victoria at the Old Bedford ‚Äì in about 1890. Though Yorkshire-born, Vesta assumed a Cockney stage persona. Her singing career escalated in 1892 when \\"Daddy Wouldn't Buy Me a Bow Wow\\" became a huge hit. She sang it first at South London Palace, a music hall in Lambeth, and to high success on her first trip to the United States in 1892, when she appeared for eight weeks at Tony Pastor's theatre in New York City. Vesta married twice, both marriages producing a daughter. She was married to music hall manager Frederick Wallace McAvoy from 1894 to 1904. They had a daughter, Irene. The marriage ended in divorce, owing to the fact that McAvoy was a cruel, abusive and adulterous husband. In 1912, Vesta announced in New York that she was married to William Terry. In 1913, the couple had a daughter, Iris. But the 1912 \\"marriage\\" may have been invented, as English records show that Vesta and William Terry were married in Wandsworth in 1920. In any event, the marriage ended in 1926, when Vesta filed for divorce on the grounds of \\"Ill-usage and association with other women\\". One of the most highly paid vaudeville stars, Vesta bought a considerable amount of property in America. By the 1920s, she is estimated to have been worth around ¬£3.25 million ‚Äì the equivalent in 2014 of around ¬£975 million. She retired after World War I, but re-recorded many of her hits in 1931 in a series of Old-Time Medleys, and performed at the Royal Variety Show of 1932. She also appeared in a number of films in the 1930s. Unlike younger music hall contemporaries Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel, Victoria remained principally a live performer in England instead of becoming a full-time film performer in the USA; next to nothing remains of what film work she did. Walter Sickert's sketch for Vesta Victoria at the Old Bedford (The Met) Vesta died of breast cancer in Hampstead, north London, on 7 April 1951.England & Wales Deaths 1837‚Äì2007 Vol. 5C page 735 She did not leave a will, and at probate her estate was valued at ¬£15,631.17s. 5d. The large fortune she amassed by the 1920s is thought to have been lost in the interim partly to the scheming of handsome young men, and partly as a result of the news-making robbery of her famous jewellery collection. She was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, where a lilac tree (no longer in existence) was planted in her memory. Legacy Dr Carol Morley argues that Vesta's characterisations of downtrodden women laughing off problems were, in their time, an influence on the development of the emerging musical form of the blues. By 1906, Vesta's fame in America was then such that one of San Francisco's main roads was renamed Vesta Victoria Avenue in her honour; the city was grateful that she performed numerous benefit concerts for the relief of sufferers in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Actress Helen Fraser toured her one-woman show Vesta, based on Vesta Victoria's life and work, in the 1990s, playing over 90 performances in the UK and across America.

The treaty is divided into 17 articles. It established the Great Sioux Reservation including ownership of the Black Hills, and set aside additional lands as \\"unceded Indian territory\\" in areas of South Dakota, Wyoming, and Nebraska, and possibly Montana. It established that the US government would hold authority to punish not only white settlers who committed crimes against the tribes but also tribe members who committed crimes and were to be delivered to the government, rather than to face charges in tribal courts. It stipulated that the government would abandon forts along the Bozeman Trail and included a number of provisions designed to encourage a transition to farming and to move the tribes \\"closer to the white man's way of life.\\" The treaty protected specified rights of third parties not partaking in the negotiations and effectively ended Red Cloud's War. That provision did not include the Ponca, who were not a party to the treaty and so had no opportunity to object when the American treaty negotiators ‚Äúinadvertently‚Äù broke a separate treaty with the Ponca by unlawfully selling the entirety of the Ponca Reservation to the Lakota, pursuant to Article II of this treaty. The United States never intervened to return the Ponca land. Instead, the Lakota claimed the Ponca land as their own and set about attacking and demanding tribute from the Ponca until 1876, when US President Ulysses S. Grant chose to resolve the situation by unilaterally ordering the Ponca removed to the Indian Territory. The removal, known as the Ponca Trail of Tears, was carried out by force the following year and resulted in over 200 deaths. The treaty was negotiated by members of the government- appointed Indian Peace Commission and signed between April and November 1868 at and near Fort Laramie, in the Wyoming Territory, with the final signatories being Red Cloud himself and others who accompanied him. Animosities over the agreement arose quickly, with neither side fully honoring the terms. Open war again broke out in 1876, and the US government unilaterally annexed native land protected under the treaty in 1877. The treaty formed the basis of the 1980 Supreme Court case, United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians, in which the court ruled that tribal lands covered under the treaty had been taken illegally by the US government, and the tribe was owed compensation plus interest. As of 2018 this amounted to more than $1 billion. The Sioux have refused the payment, demanding instead the return of their land. Background 1851 Fort Laramie territories. Later and at different times, each tribe would enter into new treaties with the US. The result was an often- changing patchwork of bigger and smaller parts of the initial allocations, newly established reservations, and former tribal land turned into new US territory. The bold outline shows the 1851 Sioux treaty area. The first Treaty of Fort Laramie, signed in 1851, attempted to resolve disputes between tribes and the US Government, as well as among tribes themselves, in the modern areas of Montana, Wyoming, Nebraska, and North and South Dakota. It set out that the tribes would make peace among one another, allow for certain outside access to their lands (for activities such as travelling, surveying, and the construction of some government outposts and roads), and that tribes would be responsible for wrongs committed by their people. In return, the US Government would offer protection to the tribes, and pay an annuity of $50,000 per year. No land covered by the treaty was claimed by the US at the time of signing. The five ‚Äúrespective territories‚Äù of the participating tribes ‚Äì Sioux, Arapaho and Cheyenne, Crow, Assiniboine, Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan ‚Äì were defined. North of the Sioux, the Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan held a joint territory. The territory of the Crows extended westward from that of their traditional enemies in the Sioux tribe. The Powder River divided the two lands. When the Senate reduced the annuity to 10 years from originally 50, all tribes except the Crow accepted the cut. Nevertheless, the treaty was recognized as being in force. The 1851 treaty had a number of shortcomings which contributed to the deterioration of relations, and subsequent violence over the next several years. From an inter-tribal view, the lack of any ‚Äúenforcement provisions‚Äù protecting the 1851 boundaries proved a drawback for the Crow and the Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan. The federal government never kept its obligation to protect tribal resources and hunting grounds, and only made a single payment toward the annuity. Although the federal government operated via representative democracy, the tribes did so through consensus, and although local chiefs signed the treaty as representatives, they had limited power to control others who themselves had not consented to the terms. Finally, the discovery of gold in the west, and the construction of the Union Pacific Railroad, led to substantially increased travel through the area, largely outside the 1851 Sioux territory. This increasingly led to clashes between the tribes, settlers, and the US government, and eventually open war between the Sioux (and the Cheyenne and Arapaho refugees from the Sand Creek massacre in Colorado, 1864) and the whites in 1866. Map 2. Map showing the major battles of Red Cloud's War, along with major treaty boundaries. During Red Cloud‚Äôs War, the Sioux defeated the US Army on the same plains on which they previously defeated the Crow. In 1868, the US and the Sioux entered into negotiations regarding the western Powder River area, although neither held the treaty rights to the land. None of the other tribes signing the 1851 treaty engaged in battle with the US soldiers,Kennedy, Michael (1961): The Assiniboine. Norman. and most allied the Army. With the 1851 intertribal peace soon broken, the Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan called for US military support against raiding Sioux Indians in 1855. By summer 1862, the three tribes had abandoned all their permanent villages of earth lodges in the treaty territory south of the Missouri, which was now under Sioux control, and lived together in Like-a-Fishhook Village north of the river.Serial 1220, 38th Congress, 2nd Session, Vol. 5, House Executive Document No. 1. In the mid-1850s, the western Sioux bands crossed the Powder River and entered the Crow treaty territory. Sioux chief Red Cloud organized a war party against a Crow camp at the mouth of Rosebud River in 1856. Despite the Crows fighting \\"... large-scale battles with invading Sioux\\" near present-day Wyola in Montana, the Sioux had taken over the western Powder River area by 1860.Serial 1308, 40th Congress, 1st Session, Vol. 1, Senate Executive Document No. 13. In 1866 the United States Department of the Interior called on tribes to negotiate safe passage through the Bozeman Trail, while the United States Department of War moved Henry B. Carrington, along with a column of 700 men into the Powder River Basin, sparking Red Cloud's War. However, most of the wagon track to the city of Bozeman ‚Äúcrossed land guaranteed to the Crows under the 1851 treaty‚Äù ‚Äú... the Sioux attacked the United States anyway, claiming the Yellowstone was now their land.‚Äù Red Cloud‚Äôs war ‚Äú... appeared to be a great Sioux war to protect their land. And it was ‚Äì but the Sioux had only recently conquered this land from other tribes and now defending the territory both from other tribes‚Äù and the passing through of whites.Utley, Robert M.: ‚ÄúThe Bozeman Trail before John Bozeman: A Busy Land.‚Äù Montana, the Magazine of Western History. Vo. 53 (Sommer 2003), No. 2, pp. 20-31. During the war, the Crows sided with the soldiers in the isolated garrisons. Crow warrior Wolf Bow urged the Army to, ‚ÄúPut the Sioux Indians in their own country, and keep them from troubling us.‚Äù After losing resolve to continue the war, following defeat in the Fetterman Fight, sustained guerrilla warfare by the Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho, exorbitant rates for freight through the area, and difficulty finding contractors to work the rail lines, the US Government, organized the Indian Peace Commission to negotiate an end to ongoing hostilities. A peace counsel chosen by the government arrived on April 19, 1868, at Fort Laramie, in what would later become the state of Wyoming. The outcome would be the second treat of Fort Laramie Treaty, signed in 1868. Articles The treaty was laid out in a series of 17 articles: Article I Pawnee with annuities owed the Sioux, after the Massacre Canyon battle in Nebraska on August 5, 1873. The Pawnee received $9,000. Article one called for the cessation of hostilities, stating \\"all war between the parties to this agreement shall for ever cease.\\" If crimes were committed by \\"bad men\\" among white settlers, the government agreed to arrest and punish the offenders, and reimburse any losses suffered by injured parties. The tribes agreed to turn over criminals among them, any \\"bad men among the Indians,\\" to the government for trial and punishment, and to reimburse any losses suffered by injured parties. If any Sioux committed ‚Äúa wrong or depredation upon the person or property on any one, white, black, or Indians‚Äù the US could pay damages taken from the annuities owed the tribes. These terms effectively relinquished the authority of the tribes to punish crimes committed against them by white settlers. Similar provisions appeared in nine such treaties with various tribes. In practice, the \\"bad men among the whites\\" clause was seldom enforced. The first plaintiff to win a trial case on the provision did so in 2009, based on the 1868 Fort Laramie treaty. In 1873, the US exercised the right to withhold annuities and compensate for Sioux wrongs against anyone, including Indians. After a massacre on a moving Pawnee camp during a legal Sioux hunting expedition in Nebraska, the Sioux ‚Äúwere made to pay reparations for the loss of life, meat, hides, equipment, and horses stolen...‚Äù The Pawnee received $9,000.‚ÄùIndian Office Documents on Sioux-Pawnee Battle.‚Äù Nebraska History. Vol. 16 (1935), No. 3, pp. 147-155. Article II US National Archives Article two of the treaty changed the boundaries for tribal land and established the Great Sioux Reservation, to include areas of present day South Dakota west of the Missouri River, including the Black Hills. This was set aside for the \\"absolute and undisturbed use and occupation of the Indians\\". In total, it allocated about 25% of the Dakota Territory as it existed at the time. It made the total tribal lands smaller, and moved them further eastward. This was to \\"take away access to the prime buffalo herds that occupied the area and encourage the Sioux to become farmers.\\" The government agreed that no parties, other than those authorized by the treaty, would be allowed to \\"pass over, settle upon, or reside in the territory\\". According to one source writing on article two, \\"What remained unstated in the treaty, but would have been obvious to Sherman and his men, is that land not placed in the reservation was to be considered United States property, and not Indian territory.\\" As in 1851, the US recognized most of the land north of the Sioux reservation as Indian territory of the Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan. In addition, the US still recognized the 1851 Crow claim to the Indian territory west of the Powder. The Crow and the US came to an agreement about this expanse on May 7, 1868. With the reservation border following ‚Äúthe northern line of Nebraska‚Äù, the Peace Commission ceded to the Sioux the little Ponca reservation, which had already been guaranteed the Ponca in multiple treaties with the government. ‚ÄúNo one has ever been able to explain‚Äù this blunder, which was nonetheless enforced by the government, irrespective of their earlier agreements. Article III Article three provided for allotments of up to of tillable land to be set aside for farming by members of the tribes. By 1871, 200 farms of and 200 farms of had been established including 80 homes. By 1877, this had risen to 153 homes \\"50 of which had shingle roofs and most had board floors\\" according to an 1876 report by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Article IV The government agreed to build a number of buildings on the reservation: * Warehouse * Store-room * Agency building * Physician residence * Carpenter residence * Farmer residence * Blacksmith residence * Miller residence * Engineer residence * School house * Saw mill Article four also provided for the establishment of an agency on the reservation for the purpose of government administration. In practice, five were constructed and two more later added. These original five were composed of the Grand River Agency (Later Standing Rock), Cheyenne River Agency, Whetstone Agency, Crow Creek Agency, and Lower Brul√© Agency. Another would later be set up on the White River, and again on the North Platte River, but would later be moved to also be on the White. Articles V through X The government agreed that the agent for the Bureau of Indian Affairs shall keep his office open to complaints, which he will investigate and forward to the Commissioner. The decision of the Commissioner, subject to review by the Secretary of the Interior, \\"shall be binding on the parties\\". Article six laid out provisions for members of the tribes to take legal individual ownership of previously commonly held land, up to for the heads of families, and for any adult who was not the head of a family. This land then \\"may be occupied and held in the exclusive possession of the person selecting it, and of his family, so long as he or they may continue to cultivate it.\\" Article seven addressed education for those aged six to 16, in order, as the treaty states, to \\"insure the civilization of the Indians entering into this treaty\\". The tribes agreed to compel both male and females to attend school, and the government agreed to provide a schoolhouse and teacher for every 30 students who could be made to attend. In article eight, the government agreed to provide seeds, tools, and training for any of the residents who selected tracts of land, and agreed to farm them. This was to be in the amount of up to $100 dollars worth for the first year, and up to $25 worth for the second and third years. These were one of a number of provisions of the treaty designed to encourage farming, rather than hunting, and move the tribes \\"closer to the white man's way of life.\\" After 10 years the government may withdraw the individuals from article 13, but if so, will provide $10,000 annually \\"devoted to the education of said Indians ... as will best promote the education and moral improvement of said tribes.\\" These are to be managed by a local Indian agent under the Commissioner of Indian Affairs. Article 10 provided for an allotment of clothes, and food, in addition to one \\"good American cow\\" and two oxen for each lodge or family who moved to the reservation. It further provided for an annual payment over 30 years of $10 for each person who hunted, and $20 for those who farmed, to be used by the Secretary of the Interior for the \\"purchase of such articles as from time to time the condition and necessities of the Indians may indicate to be proper.\\" Article XI One of the signature pages from the treaty, including X marks for the tribal leaders, as a substitute for signed names Article 11 included several provisions stating the tribes agreed to withdraw opposition to the construction of railroads (mentioned three times), military posts and roads, and will not attack or capture white settlers or their property. The same guarantee protected third parties defined as ‚Äúpersons friendly‚Äù with the United States. The government agreed to reimburse the tribes for damages caused in the construction of works on the reservation, in the amount assessed by \\"three disinterested commissioners\\" appointed by the President. It guaranteed the tribes access to the area to the north and west of the Black Hills as hunting grounds, \\"so long as the buffalo may range thereon in such numbers as to justify the chase.\\" As one source examined the treaty language with regard to \\"so long as the buffalo may range\\", the tribes considered this language to be a perpetual guarantee, because \\"they could not envision a day when buffalo would not roam the plains\\"; however: > The concept was clear enough to the commissioners ‚Ä¶ [who] well knew that > hide hunters, with Sherman‚Äôs blessing, were already beginning the slaughter > that would eventually drive the Indians to complete dependence on the > government for their existence. Despite Sioux promises of undisturbed construction of railroads and no attacks, more than 10 surveying crew members, US Army Indian scouts and soldiers were killed in 1872 and 1873. Because of the Sioux massacre on the Pawnee in southern Nebraska during a hunting expedition in 1873, the US banned such hunts outside the reservation. Thus, the US decision nullified a part of Article XI. Article XII Article 12 required the agreement of \\"three- fourths of all the adult male Indians\\" for a treaty with the tribes to \\"be of any validity\\". Hedren reflected on article 12 writing that the provision indicated the government \\"already anticipated a time when different needs would demand the abrogation of the treaty terms.\\" These provisions have since been controversial, because subsequent treaties amending that of 1868 did not include the required agreement of three-fourths of adult males, and so under the terms of 1868, are invalid. Articles XIII through XV The government agreed to furnish the tribes with a \\"physician, teachers, carpenter, miller, engineer, farmer, and blacksmiths\\". The government agreed to provide $100 in prizes for those who \\"in the judgment of the agent may grow the most valuable crops for the respective year.\\" Once the promised buildings were constructed, the tribes agreed to regard the reservation as their \\"permanent home\\" and make \\"no permanent settlement elsewhere\\". Article XVI Fort Laramie Treaty (1851). Definition of Crow territory west of Powder River enlarged Article 16 stated that country north of the North Platte River and east of the summits of the Big Horn Mountains would be \\"unceded Indian territory\\" that no white settlers could occupy without the consent of the tribes. This included of land outside the reservation which were previously set aside by the 1851 treaty, as well as around an additional . As part of this, the government agreed to close the forts associated with the Bozeman Trail. Article 16 did not however, address issues related to important hunting grounds north and northwest of the reservation. The Arikara, Hidatsa and Mandan held the treaty right to the bigger part of those hunting grounds according to the 1851 treaty. With the 1868 treaty, the Sioux ceded land to the US directly north of the reservation. This article proclaims the shift of the Indian title to the land east of the summits of the Big Horn Mountains to Powder River (the combat zone of Red Cloud‚Äôs War). In 1851, the US had acknowledged the claim of the Crow to this area. Following defeat, the Peace Commission recognized it as ‚Äúunceded Indian territory‚Äù held by the Sioux. The US Government could only dispose of Crow treaty territory, because it held parallel negotiations with the Crow tribe. The talks ended on May 7, 1868. The Crows accepted to give up large tracts of land to the US and settle on a reservation in the heart of the 1851 territory. It was possible for the Peace Commission to allow the Sioux to hunt on the Republican Fork in Nebraska (200 miles south of the Sioux reservation) along with others, because the US held the title to this river area. The Cheyenne and Arapaho had ceded the western part of the Republican Fork in 1861 in a more-or-less well-understood treaty.Weist, Tom (1984): A History of the Cheyenne People. Billings.Serial 4015, 56th Congress, 1st Session, pp. 824-825. The US had bought the eastern part of the Republican Fork from the Pawnee in 1833. The Pawnee held a treaty right to hunt in their ceded territory. In 1873, the Massacre Canyon battle took place here. Article XVII The treaty, as agreed to \\"shall be construed as abrogating and annulling all treaties and agreements heretofore entered into.\\" Signing Over the course of 192 days ending November 6, the treaty was signed by a total of 156 Sioux, and 25 Arapaho, in addition to the commissioners, and an additional 34 signatories as witnesses. Although the commissioners signed the document on April 29 along with the Brul√©, the party broke up in May, with only two remaining at Fort Laramie to conclude talks there, before traveling up the Missouri River to gather additional signatures from tribes elsewhere. Throughout this process, no further amendments were made to the terms. As one writer phrased it, \\"the commissioners essentially cycled Sioux in and out of Fort Laramie ... seeking only the formality of the chiefs' marks and forgoing true agreement in the spirit that the Indians understood it.\\" Following initial negotiations, those from the Peace Commission did not discuss the conditions of the treaty to subsequent tribes who arrived over the following months to sign. Rather, the treaty was read aloud, and it was permitted \\"some time for the chiefs to speak\\" before \\"instructing them to place their marks on the prepared document.\\" As the source continues: > These tribes had little interest in or understanding of what had taken place > at the Fort Laramie councils. They wanted the whites out of their country > and would fight as long as necessary. The process of abandoning the forts associated with the Bozeman Trail, as part of the conditions agreed to, proved to be a long process, and was stalled by difficulty arranging the sale of the goods from the fort to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Fort C.F. Smith was not emptied until July 29. Fort Phil Kearny and Fort Reno were not emptied until August 1. Once abandoned, Red Cloud and his followers, who had been monitoring the activities of the troops rode down and burned what remained. The peace commission dissolved on October 10 after presenting its report to Congress, which among other things, recommended the government \\"cease to recognize the Indian tribes as domestic dependent nations,\\" and that no further \\"treaties shall be made with any Indian tribe.\\" William Dye, the commander at Fort Laramie was left to represent the commission, and met with Red Cloud, who was among the last to sign the treaty on November 6. The government remained unwilling to negotiate the terms further, and after two days, Red Cloud is reported to have \\"washed his hands with the dust of the floor\\" and signed, formally ending the war. The US Senate ratified the treaty on February 16, 1869. Signatories Notable signatories presented in the order they signed are as follows. Two exceptions are included. Henderson was a commissioner, but did not sign the treaty.

Others would later complain that the treaty contained complex language that was not well explained in order to avoid arousing suspicion. Yet others would not fully learn the terms of the agreement until 1870, when Red Cloud returned from a trip to Washington D.C. The treaty overall, and in comparison with the 1851 agreement, represented a departure from earlier considerations of tribal customs, and demonstrated instead the government's \\"more heavy-handed position with regard to tribal nations, and ... desire to assimilate the Sioux into American property arrangements and social customs.\\" According to one source, \\"animosities over the treaty arose almost immediately\\" when a group of Miniconjou were informed they were no longer welcome to trade at Fort Laramie, being south of their newly established territory. This was notwithstanding that the treaty did not make any stipulation that the tribes could not travel outside their land, only that they would not permanently occupy outside land. The only travel expressly forbidden by the treaty was that of white settlers onto the reservation. Although a treaty between the US and the Sioux, it had profound effect on the Crow tribe, since it held the title to some of the territories set aside in the new treaty. By entering the peace talks ‚Äú... the government had in effect betrayed the Crows, who had willingly helped the army to hold the [Bozeman Trail] posts ...‚Äù. When the Sioux Indians had stopped the advance of the US in 1868, they quickly resumed their ‚Äúown program of expansions‚Äù into the adjoining Indian territories. Although all parties took and gave, the Sioux and their allies once again threatened the homeland of some of the Indian nations around them. Attacks on the Crows and the Shoshones were ‚Äúfrequent, both by the Northern Cheyennes and by the Arapahos, as well as the Sioux, and by parties made up from all three tribes‚Äù. The Crows reported Sioux Indians in the Bighorn area from 1871. This eastern part of the Crow reservation was taken over a few years later by the Sioux in quest of buffalo. When a force of Sioux warriors confronted a Crow reservation camp at Pryor Creek in 1873 throughout a whole day, Crow chief Blackfoot called for decisive actions against the Indian intruders by the US. In 1876, the Crows (and the Eastern Shoshones) fought alongside the Army at the Rosebud. They scouted for Custer against the Sioux, ‚Äúwho were now in the old Crow country‚Äù. Both the tribes and the government chose to ignore portions of the treaty, or to \\"comply only as long as conditions met their favor,\\" and between 1869 and 1876, at least seven separate skirmishes occurred within the vicinity of Fort Laramie. Prior to the Black Hills expedition, Army sources mention attacks in Montana north of the Yellowstone and north of the Sioux reservation in North Dakota carried out by unidentified groups of Sioux. Large war parties of Sioux Indians left their reservation to attack distant Indian enemies near Like-a-Fishhook Village. The first talks of actions against the Sioux arose. In his 1873 report, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs advocated, ‚Äúthat those [Sioux] Indians roaming west of the Dakota line be forced by the military to come in to the Great Sioux Reservation.‚Äù The government eventually broke the terms of the treaty following the Black Hills Gold Rush and an expedition into the area by George Armstrong Custer in 1874, and failed to prevent white settlers from moving onto tribal lands. Rising tensions eventually led again to open conflict in the Great Sioux War of 1876. The 1868 treaty would be modified three times by the US Congress between 1876 and 1889, each time taking more land originally granted, including unilaterally seizing the Black Hills in 1877. United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians On June 30, 1980, the US Supreme Court ruled that the government had illegally taken land in the Black Hills granted by the 1868 treaty, by unlawfully abrogating article two of the agreement during negotiations in 1876, while failing to achieve the signatures of two- thirds the adult male population required to do so. It upheld an award of $15.5 million for the market value of the land in 1877, along with 103 years worth of interest at 5 percent, for an additional $105 million. The Lakota Sioux, however, have refused to accept payment and instead continue to demand the return of the territory from the United States. the Sioux interest on the money has compounded to over 1 billion dollars. Commemoration Marking the 150th anniversary of the treaty, the South Dakota Legislature passed Senate Resolution 1, reaffirming the legitimacy of the treaty, and according to the original text, illustrating to the federal government that the Sioux are \\"still here\\" and are \\"seeking a future of forward-looking, positive relationships with full respect for the sovereign status of Native American nations confirmed by the treaty.\\" On March 11, 2018, the Governor of Wyoming, Matt Mead signed a similar bill into law, calling on \\"the federal government to uphold its federal trust responsibilities,\\" and calling for a permanent display of the original treaty, on file with the National Archives and Records Administration, in the Wyoming Legislature.

In various incarnations, they played in three different independent baseball leagues (leagues unaffiliated with Major League Baseball) from 2002‚Äì2010. They played their games at Pelican Park.http://www.pnj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009904240326 The initial incarnations Pelicans began play in 2002 as charter members of the new, independent Southeastern League. The league folded after the 2003 season, and team owner Quint Studer purchased a franchise in the Central Baseball League, moving the Pelicans to the new organization. When the CBL folded in 2004 the Pelicans joined the new American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. They won the Southeastern League championship in 2002. In 2010 Studer sold his American Association franchise to a group in Amarillo, Texas as part of a move to bring Class Double-A affiliated baseball to Pensacola. The franchise became the Amarillo Sox for the 2011 season; the new team, the Pensacola Blue Wahoos, began play in 2012.http://www.pnj.com/article/20110102/SPORTS/101020315/PNJ-s-top-10-sports- stories-of-2010http://jacksonville.com/sports/baseball/2011-01-13/story/andy- barkett-be-new-jacksonville-suns-manager History Independent leagues The Pensacola Pelicans were incorporated in 2002, when the Southeastern League decided to place a team in the Pensacola area. Midway through the 2002 season, Quint Studer and his wife Rishy Studer bought the team from the league and was approved under the Commissioner James Gamble. The 2002 season was a very successful one for the Pelicans; they had the league's best record and won the championship in an extra-innings victory against the Montgomery Wings. The 2003 season was also successful, with the Pelicans once again claiming the league's best record, but losing to the Baton Rouge Riverbats in the championship series. Before the 2004 season, the affiliated Orlando Rays of the Southern League moved to Montgomery, Alabama, the location of a key Southeastern League franchise. Unable to compete with an affiliated baseball club in one of its cities, the Southeastern League folded, and the Pelicans were left without a league in which to play. In order to join the Central Baseball League for the 2004 season, Pelicans owner Studer purchased the rights to the Springfield Ozark Mountain Ducks franchise, and the Pelicans took that team's spot in the league. Former major league standout Bernie Carbo was the team's manager and he was aided by former major leaguer Pedro Borbon as pitching coach. The CBL folded in 2005 and the Pelicans joined the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball after the 2005 season, and named Kash Beauchamp as manager. After leading the Pelicans to a 39-57 season, Beauchamp was released of his managerial duties. The Pelicans were led by Mac Seibert in 2007 and 2008, finishing 39-56 in '07 and 43-53 in '08. Seibert left after his second year to take a job in the New York Mets organization. The Pelicans won the South Division in 2009, making the championship round before losing to the Lincoln Saltdogs in 5 games. Southern League In 2010 Studer orchestrated a complicated series of purchases and moves to bring affiliated Class Double-A baseball to Pensacola. First, he sold his American Association franchise to a group in Amarillo, Texas, where they became the Amarillo Sox, now known as the Amarillo Thunderheads. Then, he purchased the Carolina Mudcats, a Southern League team from Zebulon, North Carolina. To settle the deal, however, he had to facilitate the move of the Kinston Indians to Zebulon, where they took up the Mudcats name. Additionally, as Pensacola is within the franchise territory of the Mobile BayBears, he had to compensate that team. The arrangements cost Studer a total of $2 million. It was initially reported that Studer's team would take up the Pelicans name, but it was later announced a new name would be chosen by fan contest.http://www.pnj.com/article/20110504/SPORTS/105040330/Time-vote- Pensacola-s-new-team-name?odyssey=mod%7Cnewswell%7Ctext%7CFRONTPAGE%7Cp Per said contest, the team was named the Pensacola Blue Wahoos; they began play in the Southern League in 2012.

Ordered by the Weimar government for the Reichsmarine, she was laid down at the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel in February 1929 and completed by April 1933. Originally classified as an armored ship (Panzerschiff) by the Reichsmarine, in February 1940 the Germans reclassified the remaining two ships of this class as heavy cruisers. In 1940, she was renamed L√ºtzow, after the heavy cruiser was handed over to the Soviet Union. The ship saw significant action with the Kriegsmarine, including several non- intervention patrols in the Spanish Civil War, during which she was attacked by Republican bombers. At the outbreak of World War II, she was cruising the North Atlantic, prepared to attack Allied merchant traffic. Bad weather hampered her efforts, and she sank or captured only a handful of vessels before returning to Germany. She then participated in Operation Weser√ºbung, the invasion of Norway. Damaged at the Battle of Dr√∏bak Sound, she was recalled to Germany for repairs. While en route, she was torpedoed and seriously damaged by a British submarine. Repairs were completed by March 1941, and L√ºtzow returned to Norway to join the forces arrayed against Allied shipping to the Soviet Union. She ran aground during a planned attack on convoy PQ 17, which necessitated another return to Germany for repairs. She next saw action at the Battle of the Barents Sea with the heavy cruiser , which ended with a failure to destroy the convoy JW 51B. Engine problems forced a series of repairs culminating in a complete overhaul at the end of 1943, after which the ship remained in the Baltic. Sunk in shallow waters in the Kaiserfahrt in April 1945 by Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers, L√ºtzow was used as a gun battery to support German troops fighting the Soviet Army until 4 May 1945, when she was disabled by her crew. Raised by the Soviet Navy in 1947, she was subsequently sunk as a target in the Baltic.  Design  US Navy recognition drawing of Deutschland Deutschland was long overall and had a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ship had a design displacement of and a full load displacement of , though the ship was officially stated to be within the limit of the Treaty of Versailles. Deutschland was powered by four sets of MAN 9-cylinder double-acting two-stroke diesel engines. The ship's top speed was , at . At a cruising speed of , the ship could steam for . As designed, her standard complement consisted of 33 officers and 586 enlisted men, though after 1935 this was significantly increased to 30 officers and 921‚Äì1,040 sailors. Deutschlands primary armament was six SK C/28 guns mounted in two triple gun turrets, one forward and one aft of the superstructure. The ship carried a secondary battery of eight SK C/28 guns in single turrets grouped amidships. Her anti-aircraft battery originally consisted of three L/45 guns, though in 1935 these were replaced with six 8.8 cm L/78 guns. In 1940, the 8.8 cm guns were removed, and six L/65 guns, four guns, and ten guns were installed in their place. By the end of the war, her anti-aircraft battery had again been reorganized, consisting of six guns, ten 3.7 cm guns, and twenty- eight 2 cm guns. The ship also carried a pair of quadruple deck-mounted torpedo launchers placed on her stern. The ship was equipped with two Arado Ar 196 seaplanes and one catapult. Deutschlands armored belt was thick; her upper deck was thick while the main armored deck was thick. The main battery turrets had thick faces and 80 mm thick sides. Radar initially consisted of a FMG G(gO) \\"Seetakt\\" set; in 1942, a FuMO 26 set was also installed.  History  Deutschland at her launch Deutschland was ordered by the Reichsmarine from the Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel as Ersatz Preussen, a replacement for the old battleship . Her keel was laid on 5 February 1929, under construction number 219. The ship was launched on 19 May 1931; at her launching, she was christened by German Chancellor Heinrich Br√ºning. The ship accidentally started sliding down the slipway while Br√ºning was giving his christening speech. After the completion of fitting out work, initial sea trials began in November 1932. The ship was commissioned into the Reichsmarine on 1 April 1933. Deutschland spent the majority of 1933 and 1934 conducting training maneuvers; early speed trials in May 1933 indicated that a top speed of was preferable, but the ship comfortably reached on speed trials in June. Trials were completed by December 1933, and the ship was ready for active service with the fleet. The ship also made a series of goodwill visits to foreign ports, including visits to Gothenburg, Sweden, and in October 1934, a formal state visit to Edinburgh, Scotland. In April 1934, Adolf Hitler visited the ship; he reportedly toured the ship alone, speaking informally with crewmen. The ship conducted a series of long-distance training voyages into the Atlantic in 1935. In March 1935, she sailed as far as the Caribbean and South American waters. After returning to Germany, she went into dock for routine maintenance work, as well as installation of additional equipment. She had her aircraft catapult installed in this period, and was provided with two Heinkel He 60 floatplanes. Deutschland participated in fleet maneuvers in German waters in early 1936. She was joined by her newly commissioned sister ship for a cruise into the mid-Atlantic, which included a stop in Madeira.  Spanish Civil War  Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Deutschland and Admiral Scheer were deployed to the Spanish coast on 23 July 1936 to conduct non-intervention patrols off the Republican-held coast of Spain. During the deployment, her gun turrets were painted with large black, white, and red bands to aid in identification from the air and indicate her neutral status. Her duties during the deployment included evacuating refugees fleeing from the fighting, protecting German ships carrying supplies for Francisco Franco's Nationalists, and gathering intelligence for the Nationalists. Deutschland on non-intervention patrol in 1938 In May 1937, the ship was docked in the port of Palma on the island of Majorca, along with several other neutral warships, including vessels from the British and Italian navies. The port was attacked by Republican aircraft, though anti-aircraft fire from the warships drove them off. The torpedo boats and escorted Deutschland to the island of Ibiza on 24 May. While moored in port there, she was again attacked by Republican bombers; a pair of Soviet-built SB-2 bombers, secretly flown by Soviet Air Force pilots, bombed the ship. Two bombs struck the ship; the first penetrated the upper deck near the bridge and exploded above the main armored deck while the second hit near the third starboard 15 cm gun, causing serious fires below decks. The attack killed 31 German sailors and wounded 74. Deutschland quickly weighed anchor and left port. She rendezvoused with Admiral Scheer to take on additional doctors before proceeding to Gibraltar where the dead were buried with full military honors. Ten days later, however, Hitler ordered the men be exhumed and returned for burial in Germany. The ship's wounded men were also evacuated in Gibraltar for treatment. Hitler, furious over the attack, ordered Admiral Scheer to bombard the port of Almer√≠a in retaliation for the so-called \\"Deutschland incident\\". Stalin subsequently issued orders that further attacks on German and Italian warships were strictly prohibited. Deutschland spent the majority of 1938 and 1939 conducting training maneuvers with the rest of the fleet and making goodwill visits to various foreign ports. She made an official visit to Spain following the Nationalist victory in the Spanish Civil War 1939. The ship participated in a major fleet exercise into the Atlantic with her sister , the light cruisers , , and , and several destroyers, U-boats, and support vessels.  World War II  Deutschland, before the outbreak of war On 24 August 1939, a week before the German invasion of Poland, Deutschland set sail from Wilhelmshaven, bound for a position south of Greenland. Here, she would be ready to attack Allied merchant traffic in the event of a general war following the attack on Poland. The supply ship was assigned to support Deutschland during the operation. Deutschland was ordered to strictly observe prize rules, which required raiders to stop and search ships for contraband before sinking them, and to ensure that their crews are safely evacuated. The ship was also ordered to avoid combat with even inferior naval forces, as commerce disruption was the primary objective. Hitler hoped to secure a negotiated peace with Britain and France after he overran Poland, and he therefore did not authorize Deutschland to begin her raiding mission against British and French shipping until 26 September. By this time, Deutschland had moved south to hunt in the Bermuda-Azores sea lane. On 5 October, she found and sank the British transport ship Stonegate, though not before the freighter was able to send a distress signal informing vessels in the area of Deutschlands presence. She then turned north to the Halifax route, where on 9 October, she encountered the American ship . The freighter was found to be carrying contraband, and so was seized. A prize crew was dispatched to the ship; they took the ship with the original crew held prisoner to Germany via Murmansk. The ship was seized by Norway when she anchored in Haugesund, however, and control of the ship was returned to the original crew. Meanwhile, on 14 October, Deutschland encountered and sank the Norwegian transport Lorentz W Hansen, of some . The same day, she stopped the neutral Danish steamer Kongsdal, though when it became apparent that she was headed for a neutral port, the prisoners from Lorentz W Hansen were placed aboard her and she was allowed to proceed. Kongsdal later reported the encounter to the British Royal Navy and confirmed Deutschland as the raider operating in the North Atlantic. Severe weather in the North Atlantic hampered Deutschlands raiding mission, though she did tie down several British warships assigned to track her down. The French Force de Raid, centered on the battleship , was occupied with protecting convoys around Britain to prevent them from being attacked by Deutschland. In early November, the Naval High Command recalled Deutschland; she passed through the Denmark Strait on 15 November and anchored in Gotenhafen on the 17th. In the course of her raiding mission, she sank only two vessels and captured a third. In 1940, the ship underwent a major overhaul, during which a raked clipper bow was installed to improve the sea- keeping qualities of the ship. At this time, she was re-rated as a heavy cruiser and renamed L√ºtzow. Hitler himself made the decision to rename the ship, recognizing that the sinking of a warship, always possible, was a propaganda disaster if it bore the name of its country. Admiral Erich Raeder, the commander in chief of the Kriegsmarine, also hoped that renaming the ship would confuse Allied intelligence; the was designated for sale to the Soviet Navy, and it was hoped that the use of her name for Deutschland would hide the transaction. The refit took until March 1940, after which it was intended to send the ship on another commerce-raiding operation into the South Atlantic. In April, however, she was assigned to forces participating in the invasion of Norway. = Operation Weser√ºbung = L√ºtzow off Norway in April 1940 L√ºtzow was assigned to Group 5, alongside the new heavy cruiser and the light cruiser under the command of Konteradmiral Oskar Kummetz. Kummetz flew his flag in Bl√ºcher. Group 5 was tasked with capturing Oslo, the capital of Norway, and transported a force of 2,000 mountain troops from the Wehrmacht. L√ºtzow embarked over 400 of the soldiers for the voyage to Norway. The force left Germany on 8 April and passed through the Kattegat. While en route, the British submarine attacked the flotilla; her torpedoes missed, and German torpedo boats drove the submarine off. Shortly before midnight on the night of 8 April, Group 5, with Bl√ºcher in the lead, passed the outer ring of Norwegian coastal batteries. L√ºtzow followed directly behind the flagship, with Emden astern. Heavy fog and neutrality requirements, which required the Norwegians to fire warning shots, permitted the Germans to avoid damage. The Norwegians, including those manning the guns at the Oscarsborg Fortress were on alert, however. Steaming into the Oslofjord at a speed of , the Germans came into range of the Norwegian guns; the 28 cm, 15 cm and 57 mm guns opened fire on the invaders. During the ensuing Battle of Dr√∏bak Sound, Bl√ºcher was hit by many shells and two torpedoes. She quickly capsized and sank with the loss of approximately 1,000 sailors and soldiers. L√ºtzow was hit three times by 15 cm shells from Oscarsborg's Kop√•s battery, causing significant damage. L√ºtzow in Kiel after being torpedoed on her way back from Norway. L√ºtzows forward gun turret was hit by one of the 15 cm rounds, which disabled the center gun and damaged the right barrel. Four men were wounded. A second shell struck the ship's deck and penetrated the upper and main armored decks; starting a fire in the cruiser's hospital and operating theater, killing two soldiers and severely wounding six others. A third struck her superstructure behind the port-side aircraft crane. One of the aircraft on board was damaged, and four gunners were killed by the third shell. The ship was only able to fire her secondary battery in return. The heavy damage forced L√ºtzow and the rest of the squadron to reverse course and exit the fjord. She eventually landed her troop complement in Verle Bay, after which she used her operational 28 cm guns to provide fire support. By the afternoon of 9 April, most of the Norwegian fortresses had been captured and the commander of the remaining Norwegian forces opened negotiations for surrender. The delay had, however, allowed enough time for the Norwegian government and royal family to flee Oslo. The damage L√ºtzow sustained prompted the Kriegsmarine to order her to return to Germany for repairs. The rest of Group 5 remained in Norway, so L√ºtzow cruised at top speed to avoid submarines. Nevertheless, the British submarine attacked the ship on 11 April and scored a serious hit. The torpedo destroyed L√ºtzows stern, causing it to collapse and nearly fall off, and blew off her steering gear. Unable to steer, she was towed back to port and decommissioned for repairs, which lasted for nearly a year. During the attack on Norway, the ship suffered nineteen dead, and another fifteen were killed by the torpedo strike. Despite the setback, KzS August Thiele, L√ºtzows commander, was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his actions during the Battle of Dr√∏bak Sound, during which he took command of the task force after the loss of Bl√ºcher. L√ºtzow was recommissioned for service on 31 March 1941, after which the Kriegsmarine initially planned to send the ship on the commerce raiding operation planned the previous year. Her sister Admiral Scheer was to join L√ºtzow for the operation, and on 12 June she departed for Norway with an escort of destroyers. British torpedo bombers attacked the ship off Egersund and scored a single hit that disabled her electrical system and rendered the ship motionless. She took on a severe list to port and the port shaft was damaged. The crew effected emergency repairs that allowed her to return to Germany; repair work in Kiel took six months. By 10 May 1942, the ship was finally pronounced ready for action. = Deployment to Norway = L√ºtzow left Germany on 15 May 1942 for Norway; by 25 May she had joined Admiral Scheer in Bogen Bay. She was made the flagship of the now Vizeadmiral Kummetz, the commander of Kampfgruppe 2. Fuel shortages restricted operations, although L√ºtzow and Admiral Scheer were able to conduct limited battle training exercises. Kampfgruppe 2 was assigned to Operation R√∂sselsprung, a planned attack on the Allied convoy PQ 17, which was headed to the Soviet Union. On 3 July, the force left their anchorages, and in heavy fog L√ºtzow and three destroyers ran aground and suffered significant damage. The British detected the German departure and ordered the convoy to scatter. Aware that surprise had been lost, the Germans broke off the surface attack and turned the destruction of PQ 17 over to the U-boats and Luftwaffe. Twenty-four of the convoy's thirty-five transports were sunk. L√ºtzow returned to Germany for repairs, which took until the end of October. She began a brief set of trials starting on 30 October. She returned to Norway in early November with a destroyer escort, arriving in Narvik on the 12th. On 30 December, L√ºtzow, the heavy cruiser , and six destroyers left Narvik for Operation Regenbogen, an attack on convoy JW 51B, which was reported by German intelligence to be lightly escorted. Kummetz's plan was to divide his force in half; he would take Admiral Hipper and three destroyers north of the convoy to attack it and draw away the escorts. L√ºtzow and the remaining three destroyers would then attack the undefended convoy from the south. At 09:15 on the 31st, the British destroyer spotted the three destroyers screening for Admiral Hipper; the Germans opened fire first. Four of the other five destroyers escorting the convoy rushed to join the fight, while laid a smoke screen to cover the convoy. Kummetz then turned back north to draw the destroyers away. Captain Robert Sherbrooke, the British escort commander, left two destroyers to cover the convoy while he took the remaining four to pursue Admiral Hipper. L√ºtzow meanwhile steamed toward the convoy from the south, and at 11:42 she opened fire. The harsh conditions made accurate fire difficult; she ceased shooting by 12:03 without any hits. Rear Admiral Robert Burnett's Force R, centered on the cruisers and , standing by in distant support of the Allied convoy, raced to the scene. The cruisers engaged Admiral Hipper, which had been firing to port at the destroyer . Burnett's ships approached from Admiral Hippers starboard side and achieved complete surprise. L√ºtzow was then ordered to break off the attack on the convoy and reinforce Admiral Hipper. L√ºtzow inadvertently came alongside Sheffield and Jamaica, and after identifying them as hostile, engaged them, though her fire remained inaccurate. The British cruisers turned toward L√ºtzow and came under fire from both German cruisers. Burnett quickly decided to withdraw in the face of superior German firepower; his ships were armed with guns, while Admiral Hipper carried guns, and L√ºtzow had guns. = Operations in the Baltic = L√ºtzow, sunk in the Kaiserfahrt, on 26 April Hitler was furious over the failure to destroy the convoy, and ordered that all remaining German major warships be broken up for scrap. In protest, Raeder resigned; Hitler replaced him with Admiral Karl D√∂nitz, who persuaded Hitler to rescind the order to dismantle the surface ships of the Kriegsmarine. In March, L√ºtzow moved to Altafjord, where she experienced problems with her diesel engines. The propulsion system proved to be so unreliable that repairs in Germany were necessary. She briefly returned to Norway but by the end of September 1943, a thorough overhaul was required. The work was completed in Kiel by January 1944, after which she remained in the Baltic Sea to conduct training cruises for new naval personnel. On 13 April 1945, twenty-four RAF Avro Lancaster bombers attacked L√ºtzow and Prinz Eugen, without success due to cloud cover. The RAF failed again two days later, but on 16 April eighteen Lancasters from 617 (\\"Dambusters\\") squadron scored a hit and several near misses on L√ºtzow with Tallboy bombs in the Kaiserfahrt. Despite sinking, the water was shallow enough that her main deck was still above water, permitting her use as a stationary gun battery against advancing Soviet forces under control of Task Force Thiele. She continued in this role until 4 May, by which time she had expended her main battery ammunition. Her crew rigged scuttling charges to destroy the hull but a fire caused the explosives to detonate prematurely. The fate of L√ºtzow was long unclear, as with most of the ships seized by the Soviet Navy. According to the historians Erich Gr√∂ner and M. J. Whitley, the Soviet Navy raised the ship in September 1947 and broke her up for scrap in 1948‚Äì1949. The historians Hildebrand, R√∂hr and Steinmetz, in their book Die Deutschen Kriegsschiffe, state that she instead sank off Kolberg, claiming that the L√ºtzow broken up in the late 1940s was instead the Admiral Hipper-class L√ºtzow that had been sold to the Soviet Union in 1940. The historian Hans Georg Prager examined the Soviet archives in the early 2000s and discovered that L√ºtzow had been sunk in weapons tests, in the Baltic Sea off ≈öwinouj≈õcie in Poland (under German control and named Swinem√ºnde during the war), on 22 July 1947., pp. 108-112. In October 2020 an unexploded Tallboy bomb from the attack on L√ºtzow was found in the Piast Canal (Kaiserfahrt during the war). After evacuating approximately 750 people who lived nearby, an attempt was undertaken to deflagrate it with a remote- controlled device, but it exploded, without casualties.

He is principally notable for his accurate measure of the size of the Earth, based on a careful survey of one degree of latitude along the Paris Meridian. Geodesy Picard was the first person to measure the size of the Earth to a reasonable degree of accuracy in a survey conducted in 1669-70, for which he is honored with a pyramid at Juvisy-sur-Orge. Guided by Maurolycus's methodology and Snellius's mathematics for doing so, Picard achieved this by measuring one degree of latitude along the Paris Meridian using triangulation along thirteen triangles stretching from Paris to the clocktower of Sourdon, near Amiens. His measurements produced a result of 110.46 km for one degree of latitude, which gives a corresponding terrestrial radius of 6328.9 km. Isaac Newton was to use this value in his theory of universal gravitation. The polar radius has now been measured at just over 6357 km. This was an error only 0.44% less than the modern value. This was another example of advances in astronomy and its tools making possible advances in cartography. Instruments Picard was the first to attach a telescope with crosswires (developed by William Gascoigne) to a quadrant, and one of the first to use a micrometer screw on his instruments. The quadrant he used to determine the size of the Earth had a radius of 38 inches and was graduated to quarter- minutes. The sextant he used to find the meridian had a radius of six feet, and was equipped with a micrometer to enable minute adjustments. These equipment improvements made the margin of error only ten seconds, as opposed to Tycho Brahe's four minutes of error. This made his measurements 24 times as accurate. Other work In 1670‚Äì71, Picard travelled to the site of Tycho Brahe's Danish observatory, Uraniborg, in order to assess its longitude accurately so that Tycho's readings could be compared to others. Picard collaborated and corresponded with many scientists, including Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens, Ole R√∏mer, Rasmus Bartholin, Johann Hudde,Johann (or Jan) van Waveren Hudde (1628‚Äì1704), mayor of Amsterdam, mathematician, lens maker. See: * The Galileo Project * MacTutor Biography: Mathematics and even his main competitor, Giovanni Cassini, although Cassini was often less than willing to return the gesture. These correspondences led to Picard's contributions to areas of science outside the field of geodesy, such as the aberration of light he observed while in Uraniborg, or his discovery of mercurial phosphorescence upon his observance of the faint glowing of a barometer.\\"Experience faire √† l'Observatoire sur la Barometre simple touchant un nouveau Phenomene qu'on y a d√©couvert\\" (Experiment done at the [Paris] observatory on a simple barometer concerning a new phenomenon that was discovered there), Le Journal des S√ßavans [later: Journal des Savants ], page 112 (Paris edition) or page 126 (Amsterdam edition) (25 May 1676).

For further information, see: Barometric light. This discovery led to Newton's studies of light's visible spectrum. Picard also developed what became the standard method for measuring the right ascension of a celestial object.Picard did not conceive the method of measuring a celestial body's right ascension by recording the time at which the body crossed the observer‚Äôs meridian. According to French astronomer Camille Guillaume Bigourdan (1851-1932), the French astronomers Adrien Auzout (1622-1691) and Jacques Buot (or Buhot) (<1623-1678), the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), the Czech physician/astronomer Hagecius (1525-1600) had all suggested the method ; even the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus (190 B.C.E.-120 B.C.E.) had hinted at it. However, the method had never been put into practice because it required both a telescope in place of the traditional sight of a quadrant and a very accurate clock. Picard was the first astronomer to actually employ the method. [G. Bigourdan (1917) \\"Sur l'emplacement et les coordon√©es de l'Observatoire de la porte Montmartre\\" (On the site and coordinates of the observatory by the Montmartre gate), Comptes rendus, vol. 164, pages 537-543.] In October 1669, Picard sent, to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris, a report of his celestial observations during the preceding year, which included the observation of two bright stars, Regulus and Arcturus, while the sun was still in the sky. The report was recorded in the Registres des Proc√®s-verbaux de l‚ÄòAcad√©mie des Sciences. On reading the report, it becomes apparent that Picard had been using clocks to determine the right ascension of stars. French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier (1715-1799) records an extract of Picard‚Äôs report and then remarks: \\"Cette Observation est remarquable, √©tant ino√ºi qu'on e√ªt jamais pris la Hauteur M√©ridienne des Etoiles fixes non seulment en plein Soleil, mais pas m√™me encore dans la force du Cr√©puscle ; desorte qu'il est maintenant facile (continue M. Picard) de trouver imm√©diatement les Ascensions droites des Etoiles fixes non seulment par les Horloges √† Pendule, mais aussi par l'Observation du Vertical du Soleil au m√®me temps qu'on observera la hauteur M√©ridienne d'une Etoile fixe.\\" (This observation is remarkable, it being unheard of that one has ever taken the meridian altitude of fixed stars not only in full sun, but still not in the force of twilight; so it is now easy (continues Mr. Picard) to find immediately the right ascensions of the fixed stars not only by pendulum clocks but also by observation of the vertical of the sun at the same time that one observes the meridian altitude of a fixed star.) [Pierre-Charles Le Monnier, Histoire c√©leste, ou Recueil de toutes les observations astronomiques faites par ordre du Roi ‚Ä¶ (Paris, France: Briasson, 1741), page 40.] Wolf, Abraham, A History of Science, Technology, and Philosophy in the 16th and 17th Centuries, vol. 2 (London, England: George Allen and Unwin, 1950), page 172. In this method, the observer records the time at which the object crosses the observer's meridian. Picard made his observations using the precision pendulum clock that Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens had recently developed.

Portrayed by Harry Groener, he is the mayor of Sunnydale, a fictional town rife with vampires and demons in which the main character, Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) lives. The premise of the series is that Buffy is a Slayer, a young girl endowed with superhuman powers to fight evil, which she accomplishes with the help of a small group of friends and family, called the Scooby Gang. During the show's second season, it becomes apparent that local authorities are aware of the endemic evil in the town, and either ignore it or are complicit in making it worse. The third season reveals that the Mayor is behind this conspiracy to hide and worsen Sunnydale's supernatural phenomena, as part of his century-long plot to take over the world, making him the season's primary villain, or Big Bad. His genial demeanor, promotion of family values, casual phobia of germs, and dislike of swearing belie his evil nature. The series regularly employs monsters and elements of horror to symbolize real problems,Wilcox, p. 18. and the abuse of power in relation to the forces of darkness is a repeated theme throughout the series, as well as in its spin-off Angel.South, p. 66. This season also marks Buffy's and her friends' last year in high school, and introduces a long- running character named Faith (Eliza Dushku), who is also a Slayer. After many months of fighting alongside Buffy and being under the authority of Buffy's Watcher, Giles, Faith becomes estranged from Buffy and aligns herself with the Mayor, who both employs her as an assassin and becomes a father figure to her while preparing to become a powerful demon that will destroy the town. Creation and casting In planning for the third season, series creator Joss Whedon and the team of writers for the show sought to explore the issues of the abuse of power, and the choices people in or with power make.Whedon, Joss (2008). Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Third Season; \\"Interview with Joss Whedon 'Bad Girls' and 'Consequences'\\" Featurette. [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Veteran stage actor Harry Groener was cast in the role of the Mayor of Sunnydale, the embodiment of a quintessential American politician. In the second season, it becomes clear that the authorities at Sunnydale High School ‚Äî under which a portal to hell called a Hellmouth is situated ‚Äî are aware of the perpetual influence of evil at the school and have been reporting events to the Mayor's office.Kaveny, p. 22‚Äì23. While there are scenes in season two which indicate that the Mayor is a fear-inspiring figure, he is not seen until the third season. Series writer Jane Espenson credited Groener's performance and his chemistry with co-star Eliza Dushku with propelling his character to greater importance and making their relationship a central focus of the season.Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Third Season; \\"Third Season Overview\\" Featurette (2008). [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. The writers created the blue collar Slayer Faith (Eliza Dushku) as an anti-Buffy: a young woman given extraordinary physical powers with no moral foundation. Whereas Buffy has had a stable family life up until her parents' divorce two years earlier, Faith does not know her father, and it is revealed that her mother was an alcoholic who beat Faith, before her death. She has been surviving on her own since her original Watcher, someone who teaches her about the demons and monsters she will face, was tortured and killed shortly before Faith's arrival in Sunnydale.Holder, et al, pp. 86‚Äì88. Groener loved the part and was impressed with the writing. As a stage actor used to having rehearsal time to prepare for a role, he found himself often with little time for rehearsal in the environment of television production; actors sometimes get their lines the night before and must memorize them, then spend time on set learning how to block shots for cameras. Consequently, Groener said he did not have much time to rehearse and prepare for the role of the Mayor. He was surprised to see how involved Joss Whedon was in preparing scripts: sometimes Whedon would rewrite lines on set. Groener said, \\"Poor Joss. Here is a man who I think never sleeps. He never, ever sleeps and of course he was writing and directing the last two episodes, and there were times when we would simply get a synopsis the night before...and while they're setting everything up and getting everything ready to shoot the next scene, Joss is over in a corner writing the scene that's going to happen after that. It can be kind of nuts! But it all gets done. That's the magic of it.\\"Holder, et al, pp. 299‚Äì305. Establishment Wilkins is first alluded to in the second season's third episode, \\"School Hard\\", in a conversation between Principal Snyder and Police Chief Monroe, who agree to cover up the vampire attack which took place during the episode, and report the incident to the mayor. Similar conversations occurred between the two characters on a couple more instances throughout the season, most notably in episode 19, \\"I Only Have Eyes For You\\". The Mayor's backstory is revealed throughout Season 3. Richard Wilkins III is also Richard Wilkins I and II; and he has been in office for over a century, pretending to be his own son in order to disguise his immortality, and maintaining his long life and political power by paying tribute to an array of demons who live in or under Sunnydale. He has been aware of Buffy's presence in the town from the very beginning and has kept tabs on her through Sunnydale High School's Principal Snyder (Armin Shimerman). Buffy and the rest of the town - except for a small group of his aides - are unaware of the Mayor's dark nature.Holder, et al, pp. 100‚Äì102. The script for the third season's fifth episode \\"Homecoming\\", where audiences are first introduced to the mayor, describes him as a man who \\"couldn't be more unassuming ... one feels that this man has not raised his voice in years, and although he is mild enough in demeanor, one hopes he won't.\\" In the previous episode, Faith arrives in Sunnydale, as does a vampire named Mr. Trick (K. Todd Freeman), who tries to kill both Faith and Buffy. When this is unsuccessful, he attempts to kill both Slayers again‚Äîfor fun‚Äîin \\"Homecoming\\", billing it as \\"Slayerfest\\" and charging a fee to those who have come to hunt the two. Impressed with his initiative, the Mayor invites Mr. Trick to work for him.Holder, et al, pp. 98‚Äì99.Stafford, pp. 190‚Äì192. Mr. Trick's first assignment is to distract the entire town so four infants can be taken from the hospital to serve as a sacrifice to a demon in \\"Band Candy\\". Buffy and the Scooby Gang thwart the Mayor's plans; their successful interference signals to the Mayor that Buffy's efficiency as a fighter of evil will have long-ranging consequences for him. He tells Mr. Trick to keep an eye on her. The Mayor carries out his evil schemes while exhibiting a paradoxical \\"fifties sitcom-dad demeanor\\". He dislikes swearing and disallows its use in his presence. He asserts that he is a family man; a specifically conservative politician who espouses family values. Inside his office cabinet he keeps a variety of skulls, shrunken heads, weapons, and other evil objects alongside a box of hand wipes, which he uses frequently in between dispensing \\"goofily prudish advice\\" tainted with dark threats.South, pp. 256‚Äì257. His phobia of germs was an homage to Buffy producer David Greenwalt, who exhibits similar positive enthusiasm while often wiping his hands with wet towelettes.Whedon, Joss (2008). Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Third Season; \\"Interview with Joss Whedon 'Enemies' and 'Earshot'\\" Featurette. [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Groener's acting was praised by author Nikki Stafford, who writes that he \\"is consistently wonderful in this role, one that would have been very difficult for many actors to maintain\\". Likewise, Jane Espenson remarked that Groener played the part exhibiting a \\"wonderful innocent glee\\" towards evil that she thought was \\"delightful\\". Groener stated that when he tried to play the Mayor too dark or evil, Joss Whedon or other directors would ask him to tone it down, take it easy and make the part \\"real nice\\". In contrast to the series' previous villains and monsters, the Mayor's evil hides behind a mask of humanity. Groener enjoyed this, saying \\"You don't have to be Snidely Whiplash to be evil. Look at Ted Bundy.\\" The Mayor's unassuming appearance, pleasure in such harmless activities as miniature golf and reading The Family Circus, and his quirky mysophobia are a part of the season's exploration of moral ambiguity.Jowett, pp. 168‚Äì171. Conflict with Buffy and relationship with Faith During the episodes which reveal the Mayor's true nature, Faith's darker nature also begins to appear. She shows herself to be purely motivated by pleasure, even enjoying to excess her fighting as a Slayer, but unreliable regarding the duties associated with that role. Her character tests ethics more than any other on the series, highlighting the repeated theme of the role of free will in the struggle between good and evil. Her reaction to killing demons and vampires is \\"positively joyful\\" contrasting with Buffy's frequent admissions that she considers her responsibilities an imposition on her life‚Äîalthough she is committed to her duty. In the early part of the season, Faith's actions aid the cause of good, but her motivations are ambiguous. She never reveals, other than the pleasure she receives, why she fights evil.South, pp. 13‚Äì19. Faith, Buffy, and the Mayor come into conflict during \\"Bad Girls\\", an episode in which Buffy allows herself to break rules and ignore responsibility. Needing to distract the Slayers so that he can be assured of the privacy required to complete an important ritual, the Mayor ensures they learn of a cult of vampires loyal to a demon named Balthazar, knowing they will be fully engaged in defeating him, giving the Mayor time to enact a ritual required as part of his preparation to become a demon (referred to as his Ascension). Its outcome is his invulnerability for the next 100 days, illustrated when he allows one of Balthazar's minions to slice his head in two so it can mend itself.Holder, et al, pp. 172‚Äì174. In their efforts to track and defeat Balthazar and his cohorts, Buffy and Faith flirt with lawlessness, breaking into a store and stealing weapons, then escaping police custody to complete their mission. The Deputy Mayor, who has begun to show a reluctance to participate in the Mayor's plans and is keeping track of the Slayers, follows them to warn them of Mr. Trick and the Mayor's intention to have them killed. In the heat of fighting, Faith accidentally stakes and kills the Deputy Mayor, believing him to be a vampire. While Buffy feels terrible guilt for being a part of the Deputy Mayor's death, Faith claims not to, and resents Buffy for continuing to speak of it in \\"Consequences\\". Faith tells Buffy's Watcher Giles (Anthony Head) that it was Buffy who killed the Deputy Mayor; he does not believe her and she is taken into custody to be dealt with by the Watchers' Council. She escapes and tries to leave town, only to be stopped by Buffy. Mr. Trick appears on the scene to try to kill them both, and Faith saves Buffy by killing Mr. Trick. She then goes to the Mayor's office and offers him her services,Holder, et al, pp. 175‚Äì176. but continues to pretend to be fighting on Buffy's side. Eventually her alliance with the Mayor is exposed and she is revealed as Buffy's enemy. The Mayor puts Faith up in a large, fully furnished apartment, buys her clothes, a video game system, and an expensive knife. He nurtures her, giving her a sense of belonging after her rift with the Scoobies, asking only in return she kill people when required. Faith has no problem with this arrangement and enjoys the lifestyle. Buffy writer Marti Noxon states that villains who seek out love and social connections to counter their loneliness are complex and interesting to write. The Mayor shows absolute confidence in Faith's abilities and she in turn is validated by him. Among the characters who know them both, the Mayor is the only one who never compares Faith to Buffy. When Faith calls him her \\"sugar daddy\\", he gently scolds her, reminding her that he is a \\"family man\\". According to author Lorna Jowett, his rejection of any sexual element in their relationship makes their bond stronger. Faith's experience with sex has left her apathetic about her partners, but when the Mayor demands loyalty, she is able to give it. His affection for Faith is genuine; like Faith, he has no living family, his wife having died of old age. The Mayor, according to Harry Groener, is a lonely father figure who \\"loves unconditionally\\". In series writer Doug Petrie's opinion, the Mayor is well- matched to Faith, who Petrie sees as \\"the loneliest person in Sunnydale\\" who \\"desperately needs a father\\". Eliza Dushku states that one of Faith's major life battles is constructing a viable self-esteem, which the Mayor never challenges, but his evil amplifies the \\"crazy\\" aspect of her nature. Whedon declared Faith the writing team's first \\"really human monster\\". The Mayor intends Faith to inherit his evil empire, and shows unabashed pride in her achievements. Their tenderness with each other, according to Whedon, is a \\"beautiful counterpoint\\" to the violence and evil they wreak on the town. Demise The Mayor plans his Ascension to demon form to coincide with Sunnydale High School's graduation day. In \\"Choices\\", the Mayor must complete another ritual involving a box full of grotesquely large insects which will, after he ingests them, imbue him with greater power. Faith retrieves the box for him, which Buffy then steals in order to prevent this important ritual from occurring. In the process, Buffy's best friend Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) is captured by Faith, and the Mayor meets Buffy for the first time when they exchange Willow for the box. During the confrontation, the Mayor pointedly asks questions about the viability of Buffy's relationship with Angel (David Boreanaz), a vampire who has been re-ensouled and who fights alongside Buffy. Although Buffy and Angel have been trying to avoid acknowledging the difficulties involved with continuing a relationship that can make neither of them happy, the Mayor's fatherly questions about their future and his comparison to his own experience of watching his wife Edna Mae die at an old age while he remained youthful, becomes a factor which forces them to admit that the relationship should end.Stafford, pp. 210‚Äì212. Buffy and Angel mutually but sadly concede they cannot be happy together in the next episode but they continue to work toward the goal of defeating the Mayor's plan. The two-part season finale \\"Graduation Day\\" reveals that the Mayor will be the keynote speaker at Sunnydale High's commencement ceremony, where he will be able to feed on the students after his transformation. On orders from the Mayor, Faith murders a geologist who has uncovered evidence of a previously ascended demon, then shoots Angel with a poisoned arrow to distract Buffy and the Scoobies, who have to care for, and try to save, Angel. When they learn that the only antidote to the poison is the blood of a Slayer, Buffy tries to capture Faith in order to use her blood to cure Angel. During the fight to do so, Buffy stabs Faith with the knife given to her by the Mayor; Faith escapes, but her injuries put her into the hospital, comatose. Buffy then offers her own blood to Angel, who feeds on her, then takes her to the hospital after he recovers. There, the Mayor is poignantly grieving for Faith. He discovers Buffy in the next room and tries to smother her, but is stopped by Angel.Holder, et al, pp. 187‚Äì191.Stafford, pp. 212‚Äì215. In a redemptive turn, Faith comes to Buffy in a dream to tell her how to defeat the Mayor, saying \\"Want to know the deal? Human weakness. It never goes away. Even his.\\" The knife the Mayor gave to Faith then flashes in the palm of Buffy's hand.Wilcox and Lavery, pp. 167‚Äì168. A fully recovered Buffy and the Scoobies enlist the graduating students of Sunnydale High, outfitting them with weapons to attack immediately after the Mayor's transformation, after learning his invulnerability will end once he is in demon form. The Mayor gives a speech about changes, growing up and moving on, mirroring the loose ends created by the series and the season.Whedon, Joss (2008). Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Complete Third Season; \\"Interview with Joss Whedon 'Graduation Day'\\" Featurette. [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. A solar eclipse occurs during his speech, signaling the start of the Ascension. He transforms into an enormous snake- like demon, and devours the universally loathed Principal Snyder when the latter admonished him for disrupting the event. While Angel and the Scoobies fight the Mayor's force of vampires, Buffy taunts the now-transformed Mayor with Faith's knife and runs into the school. The Mayor follows her to the library, which is rigged with explosives, killing him and destroying the school with a series of explosions.  Influence  Author Lorna Jowett considers the Mayor a classic villain, similar to the first season's vampire Master. Although the Mayor's appearance is not as frightening as the Master's, both are heads of hierarchies and symbols of patriarchy whose names are their titles. Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox calls the Mayor ‚Äî particularly after his transformation ‚Äî \\"Mr. Patriarchal Phallus of 1999\\".Wilcox, pp. 41‚Äì42. Faith's relationship to the Mayor in many ways mirrors Buffy's relationship to her Watcher, Giles, who is Buffy's father figure.Jowett, pp. 83‚Äì90. Doug Petrie characterizes Faith as \\"Buffy's evil twin\\", who gets to do what Buffy would like to do, but cannot because Buffy is moral and not as \\"free-spirited\\" as Faith, according to Whedon. Through the Mayor's effort to nurture his relationship with Faith she becomes his subordinate, despite her assertions to Buffy that she is independent. Her motivation to kill the geologist is never more complicated than, \\"The boss wants you dead\\", which she tells him just before stabbing him to death. Unlike Giles' mentoring of Buffy, in which he encourages her to make her own decisions despite what she is ordered to do by the similarly patriarchal Watcher's Council, Faith complies with everything the Mayor wants, creating \\"unquestioning service of the power structure for the sake of approval, comfort, and support of the father\\". In contrast, Buffy soon stops taking orders from the Watchers' Council.Wilcox and Lavery, pp. 13‚Äì14. Jowett writes, \\"The Mayor is ultimately a 'bad' father because he holds the status quo: like the Master before him, he is a powerful patriarch who wants to maintain his position at the top, and the children of such parents will never be able to grow up.\\" Faith does not die from her injuries, but returns in the fourth season in \\"This Year's Girl\\". While still in her coma, she dreams of a pleasant picnic with the Mayor, who picks up a small snake that has slithered onto the blanket and tells it that it does not belong there. The dream-picnic is interrupted by Buffy who stabs him to death. Faith awakens in the hospital to discover that the Mayor has in fact died and left her a video and a device that will allow her to switch bodies with Buffy.Holden, et al pp. 233‚Äì235.Stafford, pp. 233‚Äì235.Wilcox and Lavery, pp. 173‚Äì174. After Buffy recovers her own body, Faith goes to Angel in Los Angeles, turns herself in to the police and goes to prison, later emerging to begin her redemption on Angel. She returns to Sunnydale in season seven, not only to help Buffy and the Scoobies, but to perform in a position of leadership. In season seven the Mayor also returns as one of the faces of the First Evil in \\"Lessons\\" and \\"Touched\\".Ruditis, pp. 167‚Äì170, 227‚Äì229.

It is connected to Vashon Island by an isthmus built by local homeowners in 1913. Before construction of the isthmus, the island was connected to Vashon only during low tide. The island is rural with large areas of farmland, forest, and relatively undeveloped shoreline. Currently, environmental issues on the island are under considerable scrutiny. Maury Island was named in 1841 during the Wilkes Expedition in honor of William Lewis Maury, who between 1863 and 1864 raided Union ships on behalf of the Confederacy and is buried in Caroline County, Virginia. It was the site of the Maury Island incident, an unusual case of an alleged encounter with a UFO. Point Robinson Light is located on Point Robinson, the easternmost point on Maury Island. Dockton was once the site of a dry dock as well as a salmon cannery. Maury and Vashon Islands are home to the Vashon-Maury Island Community Council. In the 1940s, Vashon had a chamber of commerce that acted more like a community council than a traditional chamber. By the 1950s, the precursor to today's community council was organized and called itself the \\"Civic Assembly.\\" Today, the Community Council is charged with working to preserve the rural nature of Vashon and Maury Islands. Maury Island was also the center of controversy between the locals and Glacier Northwest, a company that supplies ready-mixed concrete owned by the Taiheiyo Cement Company of Japan. The company intended a 300-fold expansion of their existing gravel mine on the island, which was previously permitted to extract up to 20,000 tons per year. With the expansion, the company would have gained the capability to extract up to 40,000 tons per day. The opposition group made up of local islanders was known as Preserve Our Islands and staunchly advocated gathering more information before continuing mining operations on the island. The affected shoreline is located within the state's only existing aquatic preserve for notably diverse marine ecosystems. Opponents of the mine disputed many of the claims made by Glacier Northwest and alleged that the project will severely impact sensitive shoreline habitat . On December 30, 2010 King County bought the property and took possession of the land, including the keys to the property gate. The council adopted King County Executive Dow Constantine's proposed purchase and sale of the property on December 6, including the adoption of his financing package. The King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks will now work with the community to improve the property for public open space, while restoring the ecological habitat for wildlife. The mile of shoreline that is part of the purchase is the longest undeveloped stretch of shore in King County, and will be a critical part of the region's wildlife habitat for fish, birds and Puget Sound marine life.

In the 800 metres he won silver, after American Mal Whitfield's gold. Wint missed a probable third medal when he pulled a muscle in the 4 √ó 400 metres relay final. In Helsinki in 1952 he was part of the historic team setting the world record while capturing the gold in the 4 √ó 400 metres relay. He also won silver in the 800 metres, again coming second to Mal Whitfield. Wint ran his final race in 1953 at Wembley Stadium, finished his internship, and graduated as a doctor.

He is best remembered as a co-founder of the radical US-weekly newspaper the National Guardian. Later Belfrage was referenced as a Soviet agent in the US intelligence Venona project, although it appears that he had been working for British Security Co- ordination as a double-agent.Article in The Financial Times, Cedric Belfrage - sixth man Soviet spy who hid in plain sight. By Sam Jones, Defence and Security Editor, 21 August 2015 Early years Cedric Henning Belfrage was born in Marylebone, London, on 8 November 1904, the son of a physician.Cedric Belfrage and James Aronson, Something to Guard: The Stormy Life of the National Guardian, 1948-1967. New York: Columbia University Press, 1978; pg. 4. He was educated at Gresham's School, before going up to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, staying in the same room that Christopher Marlowe had in the sixteenth century. While still a student at Cambridge, Belfrage began his writing career as a film critic, publishing his first article in Kinematograph Weekly in 1924. In 1927 he went to Hollywood, where he was hired by the New York Sun and Film Weekly as a correspondent. Belfrage returned to London in 1930 as Sam Goldwyn's press agent. Returning to Hollywood, he became politically active, joining the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League and co-editing a left-wing literary magazine called The Clipper. He decided to make the United States his home and took out first papers for citizenship in 1937, although he failed to complete the process within the statutory seven-year time limit.Belfrage and Aronson, p. 7. Belfrage joined the Communist Party USA in 1937, but withdrew his membership a few months later. Thereafter, he maintained a friendly but critical relationship as a so-called \\"fellow traveler\\" outside of party membership and discipline, recalling in his 1978 memoir that for \\"temperamentally argumentative\\" adherents of socialism such as himself, such status as a \\"non-Communist, non-anti-Communist...suited us better.\\"Belfrage and Aronson, p. 8. Despite his non-membership in the American Communist Party, Belfrage remained a believer that that organisation functioned as \\"the core of the radical movement.\\" Second World War During the Second World War, Belfrage worked in the British Security Coordination for the Western hemisphere. After the fall of Nazi Germany, he was appointed as a \\"press control officer\\" in the Anglo-American Psychological Warfare Division and was dispatched to Germany to help reorganize that nation's newspapers. He and his associates requisitioned buildings, equipment, and supplies for a new \\"democratic\\" German press and oversaw a purge of Nazi collaborators from the new German newspaper industry.Belfrage and Aronson, pp. 1-2. It was while Belfrage was in Frankfurt working to establish the Frankfurter Rundschau ‚Äì a new daily ‚Äì that he met James Aronson, a veteran newspaper reporter and editor from Boston who shared Belfrage's radical politics.Belfrage and Aronson, Something to Guard, pg. 4. Aronson was attached to Belfrage and together the pair helped to establish new newspapers in Heidelberg, Kassel, Stuttgart, and Bremen, developing a friendship and forging vague plans to launch a new radical newspaper in the United States following the end of the war. Belfrage was soon discharged from the Army and returned to the United States, however, and nothing immediately came of the pair's plans. Aronson returned to a job with the then-liberal New York Post in April 1946, moving later that year to a new job with The New York Times.Belfrage and Aronson, p. 9. National Guardian The National Guardian was established by Belfrage, James Aronson, and John T. McManus in 1948 in conjunction with the Henry Wallace for President campaign. In 1948, Belfrage co-founded, together with James Aronson and John T. McManus, a radical weekly newspaper called the National Guardian. He would remain affiliated with the publication ‚Äì renamed The Guardian in 1967 ‚Äì until late in the 1960s. Later years At the height of McCarthyism, Belfrage was summoned in 1953 to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). In 1955, he was deported back to England. His wife, Molly Castle, had already been deported by that time. He traveled to Cuba in 1961. In 1962, he traveled throughout South America, finally settling in Cuernavaca, Mexico. Belfrage returned to the US for the first time in 1973, touring around the country with to promote his new book, The American Inquisition. He later debuted as a Spanish-English translator, notably for the Latin American author Eduardo Galeano. He was commissioned by Monthly Review Press to translate Galeano's Open Veins of Latin America. Belfrage continued to write extensively until his last years. Intelligence allegations According to FBI files, Belfrage was questioned by the FBI in 1947 about his involvement with the Communist Party. The interview covered his relations with CPUSA General Secretary Earl Browder, Jacob Golos, V. J. Jerome, and surveillances and documents about Scotland Yard and the Vichy Government of France.John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, Venona: Decoding Soviet Espionage in America. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009; pp. 109‚Äì111, 312. See also John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev, Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009; pp. 191 and 581, footnote 89. In her 1951 memoir Out of Bondage, Elizabeth Bentley (who had reported to Golos) recounted Belfrage's interactions with Golos. In 1995, intercepts decrypted by Venona ‚Äì a project between the US and British intelligence services to decipher Soviet messages ‚Äì were made public. United States intelligence has alleged that Unnamed Codename Number 9 (UNC/9) was Belfrage. Venona also had a cover name \\"Charlie\\" that was not identified by the FBI. The 1948 Gorsky Memo, found in Soviet Archives, identifies Belfrage as having a covert relationship with Soviet intelligence as a member of the \\"Sound\\" and \\"Myrna\\" groups. Seven Venona decrpyts reference UNC/9 in passing conversations between Belfrage's bureau chief and Winston Churchill on to the Soviets. Belfrage is referenced in the following Venona decrypts, 592 KGB New York to Moscow, 29 April 1943; 725 KGB New York to Moscow, 19 May 1943, p. 1 725, KGB New York to Moscow, 19 May 1943, p. 2, 810 KGB New York to Moscow, 29 May 1943, p. 1, 810 KGB New York to Moscow, 29 May 1943, p. 2, 952 KGB New York to Moscow, 21 June 1943, p. 1, 952 KGB New York to Moscow, 21 June 1943, p. 2, 974 KGB New York to Moscow, 22 June 1943, p. 1, 974 KGB New York to Moscow, 22 June 1943, p. 2, 1430 KGB New York to Moscow, 2 September 1943, 1452 KGB New York to Moscow, 8 September 1943, p. 1, 1452 KGB New York to Moscow, 8 September 1943, p. 2\\\\. During the period in question, the United States and the Soviet Union were wartime allies while at the same time the Soviet Union maintained a spy network of American citizens who passed US secrets to the Soviets.Harvey Klehr, John Earl Haynes, and Fredrikh I. Firsov, The Secret World of American Communism, New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995, p. 233. Personal life He and his wife, Molly Castle, had two children; Sally and Nicolas. He also had a child, Anne Hertz (Zribi), with partner Anne-Marie Hertz. Cedric was the younger brother of actor and BBC newsreader Bruce Belfrage (1900‚Äì1974). Cedric's uncle was Bryan Powley, the actor who began his career in the era of Silent film. Death Cedric Belfrage died on 21 June 1990 in Mexico, aged 85. Modern media and allegations of spying In August 2015, Christopher Andrew, professor of modern history at Cambridge and official historian of MI5 accessed documents released from the UK National Archive which confirmed that Belfrage worked for the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) during the war and also spied for the Soviet Union. The Financial Times described Belfrage as \\"a 'sixth man' to stand alongside the notorious Cambridge Five spy ring.\\" Other UK print, TV and radio media carried the story. On 17 September 2015 a BBC Radio Four documentary \\"The Hollywood Spy\\" examined Christopher Andrew's allegations, but also put forward information by historian John Simkin that Belfrage was working for British Security Co-ordination as a double-agent, which would explain why he handed information to the Soviets.

Negotiations over more than a week were concluded on October 26, 1758, at a ceremony held in Easton, Pennsylvania between the British colonial governors of the provinces of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and representatives of 13 Indian nations, including the Iroquois, who sent chiefs of three of their nations to ensure their continued domination of their Ohio Country region; the eastern and western Lenape (Delaware), represented by two chiefs and headmen; Shawnee and others. More than 500 Native Americans attended the outdoor ceremony, after lengthy negotiations to bring peace to the regions of Pennsylvania, New Jersey and the Ohio Country.Burton Kummerow,\\"Treaty of Easton gives sides new hope for peace\\", THE TRIBUNE-REVIEW, 19 Oct 2008, accessed 19 Mar 2010 Conrad Weiser served as an interpreter and arbitrator for the British colonial governments. Charles Thomson served as secretary and advisor to Teedyuscung, who was referred to as King of the Delawares. The negotiations were held to hopefully resolve conflicts created by The Walking Purchase of 1737, which had lasting effects on the relationships between the Native Americans and the colonists. Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Benjamin Chew, Esq. attended the negotiations of the Treaty of Easton and documented the proceedings in his Journal of a Journey to Easton.Konkle, Burton Alva. (1932). Benjamin Chew 1722-1810: Head of the Pennsylvania judiciary system under colony and commonwealth. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. p. 87. Charles Thomson also wrote about the Easton treaty negotiations in 1759 in a work entitled An Enquiry into the Causes of the Alienation of the Delaware and Shawanese Indians from the British Interest, which blamed the war on the proprietors (i.e. the sons of William Penn). The treaty specified that the Native American nations would not fight on the side of the French against the British in the current war. In return, Pennsylvania returned large blocks of land which the Iroquois had ceded a few years before; the British colonial governors promised to recognize Iroquois and other tribes' rights to their hunting grounds in the Ohio River valley; and to refrain from establishing colonial settlements west of the Allegheny Mountains after the conclusion of the war. This clause of the treaty contributed to the Crown's subsequent Proclamation of 1763, by which it attempted to reserve territory west of the Appalachians for Native Americans and prohibit European-American advancement into the area. In addition, colonial governor William Denny of Pennsylvania agreed to negotiate directly with the Lenape-Delaware again without Iroquois intervention and marked the agreement by rekindling a \\"council fire.\\" The conference concluded on October 26, 1758 and in November, Governor Denny announced to the Pennsylvania Assembly that \\"a general peace was secured at Easton.\\"Konkle, 1932, p. 87. By the treaty, the Lenape ceded all remaining claims to land within the Province of New Jersey for the sum of one thousand Spanish dollars. They received payment immediately.

Incident and immediate aftermath Most of what is speculated comes from a report by Kenneth Arnold, an aviator who had claimed to see several UFOs in the area around that time, in the first UFO sightings ever recorded in the modern era. Crisman and Dahl claimed to Arnold that they were harbor patrolmen on a workboat near Maury Island and that they saw six doughnut-shaped objects in the sky. According to Crisman and Dahl, one of the objects dropped a substance that resembled lava or \\"white metal\\" onto their boat, breaking a worker's arm and killing a dog. Dahl also claimed he was later approached by a man in a dark suit and told not to talk about the incident. While even the claim that Crisman and Dahl were harbor patrolmen is now believed to be false, Arnold was convinced by their story and contacted an Air Force intelligence officer, who flew in along with another from California. The officers concluded the metal objects were aluminum and not of interest. They did not reveal this to Arnold, however, to avoid embarrassing him. The officers then died in a crash on their way back to California. The FBI then proceeded to investigate this case, and concluded that Crisman and Dahl's sightings were a hoax. In their files, they noted that Dahl stated that \\"if questioned by the authorities he was going to say it was a hoax because he did not want any further trouble over the matter.\\" The files also detail a few alternate stories communicated by Crisman and Dahl to local newspapers and other media outlets, and conclude that they had contacted a variety of publications \\"in the hope of building up their story through publicity to a point where they could make a profitable deal with Fantasy Magazine, Chicago, Illinois.\\"\\"https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2016/dec/05/fbis-real-x- files-documents-strange-connection-bet/ Legacy Raymond A. Palmer, who is often credited with inventing the concept of the UFO, began Fate Magazine in 1948 with a cover story by Arnold on his investigation of the Maury incident as well as his nearby alleged UFO sightings. The pair also wrote the book The Coming of the Saucers. The story was later retold in Gray Barker's 1956 book \\"They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers,\\" which helped to popularize the image of \\"Men In Black\\" in mainstream culture. An account also appeared in the debunked Majestic 12 documents, which claim that the metal fragments were part of a nuclear reactor and that they were subsequently turned over to the CIA. Craig Glenday also cited the Maury Island Incident, along with the Arnold sightings, in his 1999 book The UFO Investigator's Handbook as a notable UFO incident surrounding Mount Rainier, which he described as a \\"UFO laborator[y].\\" Dahl's story was told in the 2014 short film The Maury Island Incident.

Originating in antiquity, it is a feature of Byzantine and Neoclassical architecture. It is also known as an ≈ìil-de-boeuf from the French, or simply a \\"bull's-eye\\". Classical example The oculus was used by the Ancient Romans, one of the finest examples being that in the dome of the Pantheon. Open to the weather, it allows rain to enter and fall to the floor, where it is carried away through drains. Though the opening looks small, it actually has a diameter of , allowing it to light the building. Byzantine architecture The oculus was widely used in the architecture of the Byzantine Empire. It was applied to buildings in Syria in the 5th and 6th centuries and again in the 10th century. In Constantinople's Myrelaion Church (c. 920), there are two oculi above the stringcourse on both lateral facades. Neoclassical revival Early examples of the oculus in Renaissance architecture can be seen in Florence Cathedral, in the nave clerestory and topping the crowns of the arcade arches. Since the revival of dome construction beginning in the Italian Renaissance, open oculi have been replaced by light-transmitting cupolas and other round windows, openings, and skylights. They can be seen in the pediments of Palladio's Villa Rotonda, though not in the dome. Use of oculus windows became more popular in Baroque architecture. Widely used by Neo-Palladian architects including Colen Campbell, one can be seen in the dome of Thomas Jefferson's Rotunda at the University of Virginia.

Enix's U.S. subsidiary published the American release, Dragon Warrior II, for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990. Dragon Quest II is set one hundred years after the events of the first game. The game's story centers on the prince of Midenhall, who is ordered to stop an evil wizard named Hargon after Hargon destroys Moonbrooke Castle. On his adventure, he is accompanied by his two cousins, the prince of Cannock and the princess of Moonbrooke. Dragon Quest II expands on the first game by having a larger party, more areas to explore, multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, and a sailing ship. The game's successor, Dragon Quest III, follows the ancestor of the main characters, the legendary hero Erdrick; and the three games are collectively called \\"Erdrick Saga Trilogy\\". Planning began a month before the original Dragon Quest was released. One major goal was the development of a more exciting combat system, which was inspired by similar multi-character party systems such as the one found in Wizardry. The artwork that was used as the basis for the characters and monsters was painted by Akira Toriyama and then translated into pixel art. The game was hit with delays due to game balance, which were only fully corrected in the early sections of the game. This, combined with a staff that included students not familiar with the coding and debugging process, pushed back the release by a month. The developers also had many ideas that had to be discarded due to the technical limitations of the Famicom system, though some were later incorporated into subsequent remakes and the game's sequel, Dragon Quest III. Dragon Quest II was successful in Japan; the original Famicom version shipped 2.4 million copies. Later, the game was remade for the Super Famicom and the Game Boy Color and combined with the original Dragon Quest game in a release entitled Dragon Quest I & II. A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan on June 26, 2014 and worldwide on October 9, 2014, as Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line. The game was praised for improving on almost all aspects of the original, including having better graphics, having a larger world to explore, and more characters to participate in a more dynamic combat system. Dragon Quest II is known as one of the most difficult Dragon Quest games, especially in its late game, and retained that reputation even in later ports to other platforms that made the game somewhat more forgiving.  Gameplay  The party wanders in a castle. Dragon Quest II is a role-playing video game. It allows the player to control more than one character, each of whom has their own characteristics, and it is the first game in the Dragon Quest series to do so.Editors of Nintendo Power: Nintendo Power September/October, 1990; issue 16 (in English). Nintendo of America, Tokuma Shoten Publishing, 67. The game introduced a party system where, instead of beginning the game with an entire party as was common in previous computer RPGs, the player begins the game with only one character and gradually recruits more party members during the course of the game. The player controls his or her characters as they move in the game world. They can search treasure chests, talk and trade with villagers, equip themselves with weapons and armor, and cast spells. While wandering fields, towers, caves, seas, and dungeons, the player randomly encounters monsters, after which the game shifts to battle mode. The game's battle mode introduces groups of monsters, which is an upgrade from the one-on-one battles of Dragon Quest. In the battle mode, the player gives orders to the characters on how to fight the monsters. Once the player defeats all of the monsters, the characters gain experience points and gold. The experience points raise the characters' experience levels. This improves the characters' attributes, and they may also learn new spells. To win, the player must fight monsters to improve the characters' experience levels and get gold to buy better weapons and armor. Eventually, the player's characters become strong enough to make it to the next town or dungeon. This repeats until the player reaches the final boss and defeats him. However, the gameplay is not necessarily linear, especially after the player gets the boat. Exploration is a key component of the game. The game offers a few spots to save the game. In most of the towns, talking to a king or minister saves the game. In the American version, which incorporated a battery for saved games rather than the password system of the original, talking to the king also allows for the deletion and moving of saved games. Dragon Quest II is noted for greatly expanding upon the gameplay of the previous game, Dragon Quest. The game is the first in the series to feature multiple heroes and enemies in a battle, as well as a sailing ship. It also allowed the player to land the ship anywhere, making it possible to explore the entire game world in an open-ended manner. It included other new gameplay features such as weapons which cast spells when used in battles.(1990) Nintendo, Enix America Corporation Licensed Nintendo of America Inc.

The game also expanded the inventory management system of its predecessor by giving each character an individual inventory that holds up to eight items, placing a greater emphasis on conservative item management between the characters. Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line was also the first Dragon Quest game to include a game of chance (played with Lottery Tickets that the player finds), and was also the first Dragon Quest game to use multiple key types and to include travel doors (warp gates).  Plot  Dragon Quest II is set one hundred years after Dragon Quest. The story begins with an attack upon Moonbrooke Castle by the wizard Hargon, who seeks to summon the demon Malroth to destroy the world. A wounded soldier escaped the battle and fled to the kingdom of Midenhall, where he informs the king of the attack before he dies. The king then commands his son, who is a descendant of Erdrick (known as Loto in Japanese translations and some later localizations), to defeat Hargon.Editors of Nintendo Power: Nintendo Power September/October, 1990; issue 16 (in English). Nintendo of America, Tokuma Shoten Publishing, 66. The Prince begins his quest alone, but is later joined by two cousins: the Prince of Cannock and the Princess of Moonbrooke. After finding the Prince of Cannock, who began a similar journey at the same time as the Prince of Midenhall, they restore the Princess of Moonbrooke to her human form, having been transformed into a dog during Hargon's assault on Moonbrooke Castle, which was reduced to ruins. As the trio quest to find and defeat Hargon, they secure a ship that allows them to travel across oceans to reach new continents, including Alefgard, which is where Dragon Quest took place. There they meet the grandson of Dragonlord, the villain from the previous game, who gives the party valuable information. He tells them that by collecting the five crests hidden around the world, the party can create the Charm of Rubiss, allowing them to defeat Hargon and his illusions. After obtaining the Charm of Rubiss, the party travels to Hargon's castle in the ice-covered plateau of Rhone and confronts Hargon in his throne room. Hargon is defeated, but he offers himself to Malroth and the demon emerges to destroy the heroes. Together, the three heroes slay Malroth and return to Midenhall, where the Prince is named the new king.  Development  Like other main games in the Dragon Quest series, Yuji Horii wrote the story for Dragon Quest II, Akira Toriyama did the artwork, and Koichi Sugiyama composed the music. Co-creator Koichi Nakamura, Chunsoft's president, directed the game and did half of the programming. Planning for Dragon Quest II began in April 1986, a month before the release of the original Dragon Quest. With the system and memory map decided, they started development in early July. At the beginning of development, producer Yukinobu Chida asked director and programmer Koichi Nakamura for a definite release date, and he offhandedly set one. Then the development team was divided into two groups, with one designing the story, as well as the monsters, and one doing the programming. The initial deadline was set for early November, but the game ultimately suffered a small delay. The development team had finished programming almost everything by the time of the initial release and believed the game could be released by the end of that year. (Translation is available) In the Japanese magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump, published on November 11, 1986, it was announced that the game would be released in late December.Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump issue 50 in 1986, released on 11 November 1986. However, the developers found that the game was too difficult, so it was delayed for a month to adjust the balance. They had to finish the final version in mid-December, which they did, and then rushed to deliver to Nintendo to make the physical game cartridges. The game was released on January 26, 1987. The developers believed that Dragon Quests one-vs-one combat system was \\"tedious\\" and too simple, and that the leveling system was \\"boring\\", so they decided to have Dragon Quest II use a party system with players controlling multiple characters. In another game from the time entitled Wizardry, players can control a party of up to six characters directly; Nakamura saw this, liked the idea, and wanted to do something similar. Due to technical restrictions, they decided to use only three characters; the Famicom video game system supports the display of up to eight sprites side by side, and one game character used two units in a direction, so it was possible for up to three characters to talk with a non-playable character (NPC). Yuji Horii believed many players would play Dragon Quest II without first playing Dragon Quest, and thus had players search for the other party members. During development, the staff discussed the idea of deprecating the \\"stair\\" command of the predecessor several times. Nakamura has stated that the Cave of Rhone found in the game is inspired by a classic trick to exit mazes, that of always moving forward while sticking to the right-hand side wall to avoid traps. In the story group, monsters were the first thing designed. The monsters' names, skills, and personalities were decided first, after which they were drawn by artist Akira Toriyama. Yuji Horii allowed Toriyama to paint full drawings rather than directly create the pixel art that would be shown in the game. The artwork was then converted into computer graphics; as Toriyama was unfamiliar with computer graphics technology, other staff took charge of this. Many new monsters needed to be designed to make the game feel real, and the process was laborious for Toriyama. But he has also said that, compared to the manga comics he was used to, he enjoyed painting more, so on balance the experience was positive. Yuji Horii stated that for his process, like other manga and film creators, he quickly outlines the story's plot in his mind. With regard to map design, a blank map was used to create the physical shape of the place, like a castle, cave, or tower, and then the key elements and story were created together afterwards. The scenarios were mainly written by his friend Hiroshi Miyaoka. Compared with write lines in writing paper and design map in graph paper, staff wrote both two in 5 mm graph papers of A4, as they felt that's easy for organizing; their manuscript thickness is 15 cm. Compared with its predecessor, the game was more advanced in nearly all technological aspects. Koichi Nakamura programmed with several students, but since it was his first time working with a team, he didn't know how to delegate work or communicate his goals. Since the students were unfamiliar with the coding process, they did not know how to debug or to keep track of whose code it came from, so Nakamura had to do it himself, which caused delays. In programming, they did the maps first. Then they worked on characters, including numbered characters in maps for assigned lines, and designed the NPC's moving route. The next step was programming the items, while the final step was setting the monsters data and converting Toriyama's artwork. This work was completed by the end of October. Due to the aforementioned balance issues, the game was initially very difficult, especially in the later stages. Nakamura had written a program that simulated every single combat that he used to adjust the game's setting for character leveling and the strength of enemies players would encounter. This program failed to account for larger monster groups, however, which fell outside the model and caused the game to be very difficult. Further more, enemies leveling and weapons power were designed by area, but Koichi Nakamura didn't think over the boat, so if players get the boat to some land might be quickly defeated. The developers realized there was a balance problem and did some modifications, such as limiting the number of enemies in Midenhall to groups of three, and moving the Cannock Castle closer to Midenhall Castle. Due to a lack of cartridge space, many ideas were abandoned during development, such as an alternate ending that the Lorasia Prince is assassinated by the Prince of Cannock's sister if he dies in the final battle. Some elements were later used in remakes or sequels: a subplot about the Prince of Cannock being cursed was added to the Super Famicom remake and later remakes.Special Goods of Famicom & Super Famicom Dragon Quest I¬∑II¬∑III Also, the Promontory of Olivia in Dragon Quest III was initially an idea for Dragon Quest II. The game cartridge's ROM capacity is 1 Mbit, but only about 10 bytes of free space remains in final products.First Print Bonus of Etrian Mystery Dungeon. p. 42  1990 North American localization  The North American release of the game as Dragon Warrior II was created by Enix themselves and published in 1990. Unlike the original Japanese Famicom version, which used passwords for saving, the NES version used an internal battery backup instead to record the player's progress. The storyline introduction in Moonbrooke is presented exclusively in Dragon Warrior II. In the Japanese original, the game starts right with the injured soldier from Moonbrooke entering Midenhall castle, seeking help from its king.Narration (first line of game translated): One day, a single wounded soldier arrived after a long struggle at Lorasia Castle. The dialogue of the American localization often used (intentionally) archaic English vocabulary, among other differences from the Japanese version. Like Dragon Warrior, the American version of Dragon Warrior II was censored in some aspects; for example, it used a ghost-like sprite instead of the original defeated character's coffin with cross sprite.  Music  Koichi Sugiyama composed and directed the music for the game. The first album of Dragon Quest II, Suite Dragon Quest II ~Gods of the Evil Spirits~, was released in February 1987. It covers ten orchestra version soundtracks with a twenty-five minute \\"original sound story\\"; this suite was performed by the Tokyo Strings Ensemble. Some of the tracks are classical and some are jazz. On August 20, 1987, the first \\"Family Classic Concert\\" was held. In this concert, Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest II's music was performed by the Tokyo Strings Ensemble. Later in October 1987, the concert recording was released as symphonic suite CD under title Dragon Quest in Concert. Music of Dragon Quest II were also released as a piano CD, a Drama CD and several Symphonic Suite albums. Dragon Quest II's musics were also collected in music compilations, like Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest Best Selection Vol.1 ~Roto~ (1997), Dragon Quest Game Music Super Collection Vol. 1‚Äì3 (2001‚Äì2002), Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest Complete CD-Box (2003) and Symphonic Suite Dragon Quest Scene-Separated I~IX (2011). \\"Only Lonely Boy\\", the background music in the game's name and password input interface, was arranged as a vocal promotional song and released as a single by Anna Makino named ‚ÄúLove Song Sagashite‚Äù. Since the original Dragon Quest opened with a pop song, Sugiyama decided to use this song to make the games stylistically connected. This music is also used for Japan professional baseball team Chiba Lotte Marines' fight song. The song that is played when wandering the fields of Dragon Quest, \\"Unknown World\\", is also played when the Hero is in that area. The ending theme \\"My Road, My Journey\\" is also the ending song of related anime Dragon Quest: Dai's Great Adventure.  Remakes  Dragon Quest II was ported to MSX computers in February 1988, but the ported version had many issues like choppy scrolling, black-surround characters titles, poor graphics, along with sluggish combat and menus. The MSX2 ported version was released in May 1988 in Japan. On December 18, 1993, Dragon Quest II was remade and combined with Dragon Quest as part of Dragon Quest I & II for the Super Famicom, which used Dragon Quest V's engine. Besides enhanced in graphics and sound, gameplay was also improved. The Super Famicom remake features an improved enemy targeting system: if an enemy is defeated before a character who was assigned to attack can perform its attack move, the character will attack another enemy rather than do nothing like in the Famicom version. And like its successors, players can find stat-improving items from pots or dressers. The Super Famicom remake was only released in Japan. In 1999, Dragon Quest I & II was released for Game Boy Color; the game is also compatible with Game Boy. A year later, it was localized in America as Dragon Warrior I & II. This remake is similar to the Super Famicom version, but with 8-bit graphics. Compared with the NES version, it featured better graphics and was less difficult. The remake also provided a quick-save function to allow players save and load game anywhere unless they reset the Game Boy. In the Game Boy Color localization, the main characters' and towns' names were retranslated to be similar to the original Japanese names: legendary hero \\"Erdrick\\" was retranslated as \\"Loto\\", and the castle name \\"Midenhall\\" was re-dubbed \\"Lorasia\\". The original translation had a lot of errors, and Enix changed the names to help fix that. Dragon Quest II was remade for Japanese NTT DoCoMo brand cell phones in 2005. The remakes size was four times bigger than the original Dragon Quest port, and since phone capacity was limited, the game was divided into two parts. The first part was pre-installed in cell phones and the second part could be downloaded for free. The world map was provided by a pre-installed PDF file. In 2006 Japanese mobile companies BREW and SoftBank also started selling the game on their mobile platforms. Both the Famicom and Super Famicom versions of this game, along with Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest III, were re-released under the Dragon Quest 25th Anniversary Collection compilation for the Wii in Japan on September 15, 2011. The Wii compilation featured interruptive save functions for each games. The compilation also included original copies of the strategy guides for the games, along with original artwork and material on the games' development. Square Enix announced the first eight Dragon Quest titles would be re-released on Android and iOS in Japan. This Dragon Quest II was based on the previous cell phone version while optimized for smartphones and was released on June 26, 2014 in Japan. An English version was released on October 9, 2014 under the title Dragon Quest II: Luminaries of the Legendary Line. Square Enix registed this trademark in Japan in 2013, and in United States in early 2014.  Other media  Several guide books were published: the first was published by Shueisha in February 1987, the second by Tokuma Shoten in July 1987, and the third by game publisher Enix in 1988 as an \\"official guide book\\". Similar to other early main games in the series, Dragon Quest II was novelized and adapted to game books. The Dragon Quest II Novel was written by Hideo Takayashiki and published in 1989; it was reprinted in 1991 and 2000. The Dragon Quest II Game Book series was also published in 1989.  Reception and legacy   Sales  The Famicom version sold approximately 2.4 million copies in Japan. Together, both the Super Famicom and Game Boy Color remakes shipped in excess of 1.92 million copies worldwide. The Japan Mobile version was downloaded more than one million times. The game was included in a 2011 compilation called Dragon Quest Collection for the Wii, which sold 403,953 copies.  Reception  Dragon Quest II received both critical and financial success in Japan. Readers of ' gave it a score of 28.02 out of 30, and named it the best overall cartridge game of the year. In 2006, readers of Famitsu magazine voted the game the 17th best video game of all time. The game is generally known for fixing problems found in the first game, including improvements such as allowing parties of three characters, having a larger world, better graphics, and the ability to carry more items. Other noted improvements were keys that can be used multiple times and new strategic elements introduced because of larger parties and larger groups of enemies. The game's music is often praised, despite its limited 8-bit capabilities. Considered a classic for the RPG genre, the game is regarded as praiseworthy. Japanese reviews highlighted the Famicom version's difficulty, stemming from issues such as the many traps in the Cave of Rhone, and the final boss's ability to cast a \\"Healall\\" spell, and this has led to some critics calling the game \\"the most difficult Dragon Quest\\". After Dragon Quest III released, director Koichi Nakamura said \\"In result, Dragon Quest II received favourable from everybody, but as me creator's side, I feel that I did about only half what I wanted to do.\\" Remakes of Dragon Quest II were also successful and well received. Famitsu awarded the Japanese Super Famicom remake a 35/40. The Game Boy Color remake got a 30/40 from Famitsu, and the U.S. version, Dragon Warrior I & II, received fairly high marks, including an 8.0 out of 10 from IGN, a 9.6 out of 10 from GameSpot, and 8 out of 10 from Nintendo Power. It also received the RPGamer's Game Boy Color Award of the Year for 2000.  Other media  The release of Dragon Quest II also promoted sales of the original Dragon Quest, and with the success of Dragon Quest II, the series became a Japanese cultural phenomenon. The sequel to Dragon Quest II, Dragon Quest III: The Seeds of Salvation, was released in 1988 in Japan. It serves as a prequel to the first two games and follows the ancestor of the main characters, the legendary hero Erdrick; the three games are collectively called \\"Erdrick Saga Trilogy\\". Also with the success of the Game Boy Color remake, Enix released a Game Boy Color Dragon Warrior III in 2001, which was based on the Japan-only Super Famicom update of the original Dragon Quest III. The world of Dragon Quest II was later used as the setting of Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart on the Game Boy Advance.

Rockhall.com. Retrieved 15 June 2017. is an English musician well known for being the drummer for The Animals. Having served as the band's drummer at its inception in 1963, he is the only original bandmember playing in the current incarnation of The Animals. His tenures with the band are 1963‚Äì1966, 1975‚Äì1976, 1983 and 1992‚Äìpresent. Early life John Steel was the youngest of four children. He attended Gateshead Grammar School. As a child, he and his siblings took piano lessons, though only Steel would go on to have a career in music. Growing up, Steel was exposed to records from Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Fats Waller and Sid Phillips. Career 1957‚Äì1966 Steel started his career as a musician while still in school around 1957. He met the future lead singer of the Animals, Eric Burdon, while they were studying together at the Newcastle College of Art and Industrial Design. His first instrument was the trumpet, and this was his primary instrument in the first group where he and Burdon played together. Steel's musical influences initially came from traditional jazz, but he later drew influence from modern jazz. When he transitioned to drums, Steel admired jazz drummers such as Elvin Jones and Art Blakey. They switched from jazz to embrace the new rock 'n' roll explosion. In March 1959, Steel met Alan Price at a church hop in Byker, Newcastle, and with Hilton Valentine (guitar) and Chas Chandler (bass) formed a band; by 1960 the Alan Price Combo had acquired a reputation in Newcastle. Burdon joined in 1962 from a band called the Pagans, and the Animals were born. Steel went on to play and record with them until February 1966. His last charted single with the group was \\"Inside Looking Out\\". 1966‚Äìpresent Subsequently, Steel returned to Newcastle and became a businessman, while also working in former bandmate Chas Chandler's management and publishing organisations. In 1971, Chandler introduced him to the band Eggs over Easy, with whom he played as they started the pub rock music genre. Over the years Steel has remained active as a part-time local drummer and has joined several Animals' reunion incarnations. Steel has toured since 1993 as the drummer with variations of the Animals line-up including Hilton Valentine, Dave Rowberry, Zoot Money and Mick Gallagher. In 1993, Hilton Valentine formed \\"Animals II\\", which was joined by John Steel in 1994 and Dave Rowberry in 1999. Other members of this version of the band include Steve Hutchinson, Steve Dawson and Martin Bland. From 1999 until Valentine's departure in 2001, the band toured as the Animals. After Valentine left this Animals incarnation in 2001, Steel and Rowberry continued on as \\"Animals and Friends\\", with Peter Barton, Jim Rodford and John Williamson, joined on occasion by ex-\\"New Animals\\" bassist Danny McCulloch.Steve King, History of The Animals; History of British Blues, 2015. Retrieved 10 March 2017. When Rowberry died in 2003, he was replaced by Mickey Gallagher (who had briefly replaced Alan Price in 1965). Animals and Friends continues to perform today, and frequently plays engagements on a Color Line ship that travels between Scandinavia and (Germany). In 2003, Steel provided an invited review of Sick of Being Me, a novel by Sean Egan, a novelist and journalist with a number of publications relating to the music industry. The novel concerned the challenges to a struggling musician in the 1990s.Steel expressed his views of the novel as follows: \\"Sean Egan tells a dark and dirty tale about the world of rock and roll: the sleazy, desperate bottom of the Rockpile where the people who don't 'make it' live. The central character Paul finds he has a natural ability as guitarist but he doesn't get the breaks. Given a chaotic upbringing by his dysfunctional, penniless parents, his ambition to make it as a musician too soon brings him into contact with hard drugs. He quickly becomes addicted to heroin, a smack habit which creates a battleground of his need to score and his need to play.\\". Review particulars of Sick of Being Me; Amazon.com. Retrieved 15 June 2017. \\"New Animals\\" guitarist Vic Briggs also contributed a review of the novel. Ownership of Animals name In 2008, an adjudicator determined that John Steel owned \\"The Animals\\" name in Britain, by virtue of a trademark registration Steel had made in relation to the name. Eric Burdon had objected to the trademark registration, arguing that Burdon personally embodied any goodwill associated with the Animals name. Burdon's argument was rejected, in part based on the fact that he had billed himself as \\"Eric Burdon and the Animals\\" as early as 1967, thus separating the goodwill associated with his own name from that of the band. In 2013 Eric Burdon won an appeal, making him the owner of the Animals name.

Cutter, a wheelchair-user and Vietnam War veteran was one of the county's most well-liked citizens. Despite being somewhat childish and awkward at times, he was very popular with the ladies, particularly schoolteacher Bobbi Harlow. His aging mother, who visited on December 9, 1982, still called him 'Pumpkin'.http://www.platypuscomix.net/otherpeople/halfof8213.html Cutter also was a good friend to many of the animal characters of Bloom County, often role-playing Star Trek with them (using his wheelchair as the \\"Enterpoop\\"): in the reboot, they engage in Star Wars roleplay (aboard the recumbently configured Aluminum Falcon). Cutter claims he was injured outside Quang-Tri in 1969, in a booby-trapped tunnel. He says that three of his buddies risked their lives to save him. Because he was inside a tunnel, he probably was a tunnel rat during the war. In one story arc, he and Opus the Penguin were lost at sea (after Oliver Wendell Jones had converted Cutter's wheelchair into a helium balloon) while attempting to cause havoc at the South African embassy in Washington, D.C. (their goal was to turn the South African ambassador black). Having blown off course and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, Cutter was captured by a Soviet submarine and held as a spy. Opus developed amnesia during the incident and found his way back to the Bloom Boardinghouse, and told everyone what had happened once his memory returned. Eventually Cutter was traded for Bill the Cat, who had apparently been moonlighting as a spy. He appeared much less often after that. In one Sunday strip, it is revealed that \\"Cutter John's\\" true name is Cutter Jeff. He prefers to be called Cutter John, though. Cutter John is one of Breathed's oldest characters, first appearing in The Academia Waltz. (In those days his name was given as \\"Saigon John\\" and his war injury is described as taking a shot (presumably friendly fire) while smoking a bong (improvised from his M16) with a North Vietnamese soldier, making his tunnel rat story presumably a retcon.) His more familiar name is most likely a reference to Trapper John McIntyre from M*A*S*H. While a major character in the first half of Bloom County 's nine-year run, his role was reduced to only occasional cameos for the remainder of that strip and its immediate spin-off, Outland. In the commentary in one of the Bloom County collections, Breathed observed that he dropped Cutter John from the strip because it was too artistically challenging and \\"frustrating\\" to draw someone sitting down in every panel of the comic. According to Breathed, a wheelchair- using fan of the strip, upon hearing this observation, said Breathed \\"ought to try sitting in a wheelchair [himself] for real frustration\\". In the revival Bloom County strips, Cutter John has been seen standing with the aid of forearm crutches. His sole appearance in Breathed's last strip, Opus, comes in a one-panel cameo, alongside Bill the Cat, Michael Binkley, Milo Bloom, and Oliver Wendell Jones, when Steve Dallas \\"flashes back\\" and sees them shortly before going to see Opus in the Animal Shelter in the strip's final storyline. This makes Cutter the second character (after Dallas) to appear in all four of Breathed's comics.

Performed in a group, the Bihu dancers are usually young men and women, and the dancing style is characterized by brisk steps, and rapid hand movements. The traditional costume of dancers is colorful and centred round the red colour theme, signifying joy and vigour.  History The origins of the dance form is unclear, however, the folk dance tradition has always been very significant in the culture of Assam's diverse ethnic groups, such as Deoris, Sonowal Kacharis, Chutias, Boros, Misings, Rabhas, Moran and Borahis, among others.\\"[T]he tradition of Bihu is not solely restricted to the Assamese community, but is prevalent among various tribes living in Assam. The Mising community in Assam celebrates a festival called Ali-ai-lrigang, a parallel form of the Bohag Bihu.\\" According to scholars, the Bihu dance has its origin in ancient fertility cults that was associated with increasing the fertility of the demographic as well as the land.\\" The Bihu dances and other ritualised activities are regarded as important by the people in order to increase the fertility of the land.\\" Traditionally, local farming communities performed the dance outdoors, in fields, groves, forests or on the banks of rivers, especially under the fig tree.\\"In earlier times the Bihu dance, a major symbol of Assamese identity, was performed under fig trees (Ficus) [4] and occasionally under other trees, notably the mango (Mangifera indica) and j√£mu (Eugenia jambolana). The seed of the fig fruit is very small, but in that seed lies the enormous tree of the future. mall, but in that seed lies the enormous tree of the future. Hence, the choice of site for the Bihu dance was linked to the fertility rites associated with it.\\" The earliest depiction of Bihu dance is found in the 9th century sculptures found in the Tezpur and Darrang districts of Assam. Bihu is mentioned in the inscriptions of the 14th century Chutia King Lakshminaryan as well.  Description Bihu dance, Assam The dance begins with the performers, young men and women, slowly walking into the performance space. The men then start playing musical instruments, like drums (particularly the double-headed dhol), horn-pipes and flutes, while the women place their hands above their hips with their palms facing outwards, forming an inverted triangular shape. The women then start to slowly move in tune with the music by swaying, while bending slightly forward from the waist. Gradually, they open up the shoulders and place their legs slightly apart, adopting the main posture used in the Bihu dance. Meanwhile, the music played by the men picks up in temp and intensity, leading women to thrust forward their breasts and pelvis, alternatively, to the tune. Some variations include men and women forming lines that face one other by holding each other's neck or waist, with more advanced sequences of the dance including men and women pairing up at the center of the performance area and dancing in a manner that imitates copulation.  Cultural and social importance  Assamese Bihu dance with traditional Japi of Assam. The Bihu dance takes its name from the Bohag Bihu festival (also called Rangali Bihu), the national festival of Assam., which celebrates the Assamese New Year. The festival takes place during mid- April and the Bihu dance is meant to celebrate and emulate the seasonal spirit, celebrating fertility and passion. Bihu is performed by groups of young men and women and in earlier times it served principally as a courtship dance. The Bihu dance's association with fertility refers to both human fertility, through the erotic nature of the dance, as well as to the fertility of nature, meaning the celebration of spring and the welcoming of the life- giving spring rain. The use of instruments such as drums and horn-pipes is believed to replicate the sound of rain and thunder, as a way of invoking actual precipitation. Historically, there is evidence that the Bihu dance was looked down upon in Assamese society, especially during colonial times, because of the sexually-charged nature of the performance., which clashed with the Victorian views that were dominant at the time among British colonists. Presently, the Bihu dance continues to play an important role and is a cultural emblem in the modern‚Äìday Assamese society, becoming a symbol of the Assamese cultural identity. While prior to independence, it has been chiefly a rural phenomenon, the dance has managed to make to remain relevant in the face of increasing urbanization, with the practice being adopted in the region's urban centers. The first time that the Bihu dance was performed on a stage was in 1962, part of a cultural event that took place in Guwahati.

Although Protestantism is required to be the religion of the monarch of New Zealand, the country itself, unlike the United Kingdom, has no established church, and freedom of religion has been protected since the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.At the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, Governor Hobson affirmed, in response to a question from Catholic Bishop Pompallier, \\"the several faiths (beliefs) of England, of the Wesleyans, of Rome, and also MƒÅori custom shall alike be protected\\". Although this was not added to the written text, it is sometimes referred to as the \\"Fourth Article\\". Just under half of New Zealand's population belong, at least nominally, to Christian denominations but there are a range of views on the extent to which Christianity affects New Zealand politics. Chart of New Zealand Christian political history as of 2014, showing mergers, splits and renamings During the nineteenth century, many church-oriented bodies sponsored and fostered several of the original European settlement-ventures in the period 1840‚Äì1850, notably the settlements of Otago (1848, Free Church of Scotland) and Canterbury (1850, Church of England) ‚Äì and many evangelicals, fundamentalists and conservative Catholics see Christianity as underlying New Zealand's entire political system. On the other hand, a notable politician of the late 19th century, Sir Robert Stout, had a considerable reputation as a freethinker and many dismiss the effects of Christianity, saying that New Zealand society has always had a largely secular character. Christianity has never had an explicit role in the major political parties, and the religious elements in these parties have taken varying forms, and cannot easily be classified as a single movement. MƒÅori Christianity, particularly the Ratana movement has often been of importance, with an historic alliance between it and the Labour Party signed in 1936, and many other parties now vying for their support, but this is generally regarded as a political rather than religious matter. In the 1990s a series of Christian political parties such as Christian Heritage, the Christian Democrats, the Christian Coalition and Destiny New Zealand arose out of a Christian conservative strand in the 1970s and 1980s, mostly in reaction to a perceived decline of social standards; but none reached 5% of the vote in any election.  Before the 1970s: debates over prohibition and capital punishment  Before the establishment of major specifically Christian parties in the 1970s, evangelical or fundamentalist Christianity had had little specific effect on mainstream New Zealand politics in society. While the Baptist Union endeavoured to get alcohol-prohibition policies passed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Catholic Church urged its members to vote against such laws, concerned that the measures would outlaw wine for the Eucharist. A referendum on prohibition took place in 1919, but the return of demobilised New Zealand soldiers from World War I defeated the measure. Evangelical and Catholic New Zealanders did not respond as corporate institutions to the debates on capital punishment in New Zealand in the thirties, forties and fifties, but individual laypeople and clergy did make their opposition heard. The Anglican Church of New Zealand became more forthright in its opposition to the death penalty, and as the largest Christian denomination in New Zealand, it made its presence felt.  Christianity within mainstream political parties  Neither the Labour Party nor the National Party, the two traditional dominant mainstream political parties in New Zealand since the 1930s, represent explicitly religious traditions. Nevertheless, both parties have occasionally contained people who saw their political mission in religious terms. A number of early politicians, both in Labour and in National, saw their respective political ideologies as an extension of \\"Christian values\\". In the early Labour Party a significant sub-set of the party promoted what one might call \\"Christian socialism\\", New Zealand's first Labour Prime Minister Michael Joseph Savage is said to have personified Labour's \\"Applied Christianity.\\" Labour won an overwhelming victory by presenting itself as the party of practical Christian compassion, in contrast to the \\"anti-family\\" depression-era coalition government. It was in this context that Savage ‚Äì who would later return to his Roman Catholic roots ‚Äì described Labour's Social Security Act (1938), intended to afford security for all New Zealanders 'from cradle to grave', as ‚Äòapplied Christianity‚Äô. John Stenhouse. 'Religion and society ‚Äì Religion and politics', Te Ara ‚Äì the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 23-Mar-2011. A number of early Labour politicians had Christian backgrounds. One of the first leaders of the Labour Party, HE Holland (1919‚Äì1933), had been a street preacher with the Salvation Army in Australia prior to his migration to New Zealand.Barry Gustafson, 'Rise of the Labour Party', New Zealand's Heritage, 6:2117-18. Savage's successor, Peter Fraser (1940‚Äì49), reflected in his personal life on the lasting impact of his Scottish Presbyterian upbringing, and the next leader, Walter Nash, was \\"an avowed Christian strongly committed to the Anglican Church.\\"GA Wood, \\"Church and State in the Furthest Reach of Western Christianity\\", in John Stenhouse (ed.) Christianity, Modernity and Culture (Adelaide: ATF Press, 2005), 226‚Äì27. Subsequent Labour Party leaders also had church backgrounds. Arnold Nordmeyer, the leader of the Labour Party in opposition from 1963 to 1965, was an ordained Presbyterian minister. David Lange, (Prime Minister 1984‚Äì1989) was Methodist,'David Lange: New Zealand's Prime Minister', Third Way, Feb 1986, p. 11. while Norman Kirk (Prime Minister 1972‚Äì74) was raised by devout members of The Salvation Army.Margaret Hayward, 'Norman Kirk's Early Life: Defining Experiences', in Margaret Clark (ed.) Three Labour Leaders: Nordmeyer, Kirk, Rowling (Palmerston North: Dunmore Press, 2001), 95; Michael Bassett. 'Kirk, Norman Eric ‚Äì Biography', from the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography. Te Ara ‚Äì the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 1-Sep-10 Such church connections are also present in the National Party. For example, Keith Holyoake (Prime Minister 1957, 1960‚Äì72), was \\"brought up in a strict Open Brethren environment\\", and in later years was an irregular attender of the Presbyterian church. John Marshall (deputy Prime Minister 1957, 1960‚Äì72; Prime Minister 1972) was active in the Presbyterian church,GA Wood, \\"Church and State in the Furthest Reach of Western Christianity\\", in John Stenhouse (ed.) Christianity, Modernity and Culture (Adelaide: ATF Press, 2005), n. 75, p. 227. while RD Muldoon (Prime Minister 1975‚Äì84) was raised as a Baptist and continued as a church member until he married and became an Anglican like his wife TheaBarry Gustafson, His way: a biography of Robert Muldoon (Auckland: AUP, 2000), 32. The National Party, the ostensibly more socially conservative of the two \\"major\\" traditional parties, apparently received increasing proportional support from religiously identifiable voters between 2002 and 2005. See figures in R. Miller, Politics and Government of New Zealand, 4th ed. 2006; and on the NZ Election Study website. Also, the Ratana movement has some influence in New Zealand politics (see MƒÅori Christianity, below). In , however, religion has not usually formed a major component of either Labour or National platforms - and three of the last four Prime Ministers have described themselves as agnostic.Young, A. \\"Insults get personal between Clark and Brash\\", New Zealand Herald, 16 March 2004. Retrieved 25 July 2017.  Evangelical political activism: anti-abortion activism in the 1970s  Beginning in the 1970s a significant increase in activism by New Zealand evangelical and conservative Catholic-based organisations occurred. Much of this opposed reforms undertaken by governments. In the 1970s and 1980s, two significant campaigns opposed the liberalisation of abortion-rules and the legalisation of homosexual acts. Perhaps surprisingly, members of the generally conservative National Party (George Gair and Venn Young, respectively) championed each of these legislative measures. Organizations such as the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child (SPUC- now Voice for Life) and the Society for the Promotion of Community Standards (SPCS) served as a focus for Christian conservatism. Eventually, the conservatives won their initial battles against homosexual law reform, but lost their ongoing battle over abortion during the late seventies and early eighties. For more about the history of the New Zealand abortion- debate, see abortion in New Zealand. Liberal Protestant activism: 1981‚Äì2001 Mainline Protestant churches became involved with ending sporting contacts with South Africa during the apartheid era (c. 1948‚Äì1994), culminating when many liberal Protestants and Catholics participated in mass protests against the New Zealand Rugby Football Union's 1981 Springbok Tour of New Zealand. Shortly afterward, many of the same liberal Christians participated in the peace movement of the 1980s, which resulted in New Zealand becoming a declared nuclear free zone in 1987. During the New Zealand National Party governments of the 1990s, these liberal Christians became involved in organising against New Right cutbacks to social-welfare benefits (cutbacks supported by the New Zealand Business Roundtable, ACT New Zealand and similar organisations). Evangelical political activism: 1980s: Moral Activism By the early 1980s, the Christian evangelical revival of the 1960s had developed into a social movement that utilized community and political action in response to \\"moral\\" issues. These developments were influenced by the emergence of a vocal Christian Right in the Reagan-era United States, represented by figures such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson and groups such as the Moral Majority and Christian Coalition. As with their American counterparts, these conservative evangelicals opposed homosexuality, abortion, feminism, sex education, and supported traditional family and moral values. Opposition by conservative elements within mainstream denominations towards a perceived \\"liberal trend\\" led to a decline in church membership by 7 percent between 1976 and 1981. By contrast, church membership at more conservative denominations like the Pentecostal churches rose by 127 percent during that period. In March 1985, Labour's Fran Wilde introduced a new homosexual law reform bill. This became a moral issue for New Zealand religious conservatives to rally against. Two National member of parliaments, Graeme Lee and Norman Jones, organised a petition against the bill; and three Labour MPs Geoff Braybrooke, Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan, and Allan Wallbank supported their campaign. A number of activists from the United States provided advice. At about the same time, the Coalition of Concerned Citizens (CCC) formed, using the motto \\"For God, Family and Country\\", while many liberal Anglicans and Methodists formed a \\"Christians for Homosexual Law Reform\\" network to counter their efforts. The campaign against homosexual law reform eventually failed, however, and the bill became law in 1986. Like their American counterparts, conservative evangelical movements in New Zealand also tended to be strongly anti-Communist. One such activist Barbara Faithfull, founder of the pressure group CREDO, alleged that Soviet Communists were using sex education, abortion, and homosexuality to undermine the \\"moral fabric\\" of Western civilization.Jesson, Allanah, and Spoonley, p. 95 Some conservative evangelical elements like Faithfull and the Coalition of Concerned Citizens also joined forces with other right-wing groups in alleging that there was a conspiracy by Communist groups like the pro-Moscow Socialist Unity Party (SUP) to infiltrate the Labour Party, the trade unions, and exploit various popular issues like the anti-Springbok tour protests, the MƒÅori biculturalism, and the anti-nuclear movement.Jesson, Allanah, and Spoonley, pg. 90‚Äì108 In response to perceived Communist influence within these popular causes, some conservative Christian elements like the CCC and former‚ÄìCommunist‚Äìturned‚Äìright-wing pundit Geoff McDonald supported maintaining ties with South Africa and preserving the ANZUS security alliance with the United States and Australia.\\"South Africa‚ÄîWhat is the Truth?,\\" Coalition Courier 5, no.2 (June/July 1990), pg. 4; Geoff McDonald, The Kiwis Fight Back (Christchurch: Raven Press, 1986), pg. 204-11. The CCC and another evangelical advocacy group the Concerned Parents Association (CPA) also criticized the introduction of MƒÅori biculturalism and multiculturalism into the education system as 'anti-Christian' for allegedly promoting alternative religious beliefs. The CPA and Geoff McDonald also criticized the National Council of Churches in NZ for allegedly creating a sense of guilt among White New Zealanders by highlighting historic issues like Maori land confiscations during the New Zealand Wars. Several conservative evangelical periodicals like Coalition Courier, Family Alert and Challenge Weekly were used to disseminate these ideas. During the 1987 general election, conservative Christian elements including the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children (SPUC), Women for Life and the Coalition of Concerned Citizens tried to infiltrate the National Party by running conservative Christian individuals as candidates. Conservative Christian groups and periodicals like the Coalition Courier and Challenge Weekly also attacked the Labour government's policies towards peace education, sex education, abortion, and Maori biculturalism. However, they met little success in this effort and the National Party leadership responded by quietly centralizing its candidate selection procedures. Increased evangelical political activism did, however, set the stage for the emergence of several evangelical Christian political parties during the next twenty-five years (see below).Allan Davidson, p. 186. Evangelical parties A number of New Zealand evangelical Christian political parties emerged in times: *Christian Heritage Party (1989‚Äì2006) *Christian Democrat Party (1995‚Äì1998) *Destiny New Zealand (2007‚Äì10) *Family Party (2007‚Äì10) *Vision New Zealand (2019‚Äì) (initially to be Coalition NZ)  Before the Christian Coalition  Many members of the Reformed Churches of New Zealand became involved in founding the Christian Heritage Party, and a model had existed in the Netherlands since 1922, the Political Reformed Party or SGP (Dutch). As Dirk Vanderpyl noted in his denominational history of the Reformed Churches, Trust and Obey (1994), the SGP, ChristenUnie and other Reformed fundamentalist-based political parties were involved in \\"testimonial party\\" politics within the Dutch Parliament, based more on principle than concrete political objectives. The Christian Heritage Party formed in 1989. The driving force behind its creation, Bill van Rij, had had previous involvement in the Coalition of Concerned Citizens. Van Rij took direct inspiration from the Christian Heritage Party of Canada, and believed that a similar party could have success in New Zealand. In January 1988, van Rij and several friends established a steering committee for a new political party based on the Canadian model. In February, a meeting in Christchurch confirmed the plan, and John Allen, a former National Party candidate, became de facto interim leader. By 20 July 1989, a sufficient number of people had gathered for the party to launch officially. The party took a strict biblical line, and strongly condemned things such as abortion, pornography, and the perceived erosion of marriage and the family. Shortly after the party's official launch, the Reverend Graham Capill gained appointment as leader, a position he would hold for the next fourteen years. Religious conservatives gave a mixed reaction to the formation of the Christian Heritage Party. Some groups, such as SPUC, welcomed the party. Others, however, believed that an independent Christian conservative party would not succeed, or worse, would split the conservative vote. Graeme Lee, a National member of parliament who had fought against homosexual law-reform, did not support the new party, seeing fighting for Christian values within the National Party as more effective. One controversial issue associated with the Christian Heritage Party centred on the party's rigidly \\"confessional\\" nature. Under this policy, all members of the party had to declare themselves as Christians. The Christian Heritage Party saw this requirement as only natural, and as a guarantee of the party's ideological purity. Other Christian activists, however, particularly those with more moderate views, believed that confessionalism unnecessarily restricted the support base of the party. Instead, they advocated a party \\"based on Christian values\\", rather than a \\"Christians only\\" party. The non- confessionalists claimed that anyone, even if not followers of the Christian religion, could see the benefits of Christian values to society. As for the Christian Democrats, they had a relatively broader base. In New Zealand, the New Life Churches (some of which were then known as \\"New Life Centres\\") had a history of recent anti-abortion, anti-feminist and anti-gay activism, particularly in Christchurch, from the mid-seventies onward. Like Lee, many had joined the National Party, only to become disillusioned as it rejected social conservatism in favour of a more pluralist model as it sought to reach out to urban liberals. Brett Knowles documented and analysed the New Life Churches and their denominational history in 1999. Graeme Lee, the National MP, opposed confessionalism, believing that a party which followed this doctrine would never gain sufficient support. For this reason, among others, Lee, when invited, refused to join the new Christian Heritage Party. Lee had disliked the idea of having a separate Christian or Christian-based party at all, believing that remaining with National could prove more effective. In 1993, however, Lee had fallen out with the National Party's leadership, mainly due to losing his ministerial role in a Cabinet reshuffle. Lee's demotion, combined with his belief that National had started to become gradually more and more liberal, had prompted him to plan a departure. At this point Christian Heritage contacted Lee and invited him to join the party. According to some accounts, Lee actually received an offer of leadership. The negotiations between Lee and Christian Heritage eventually broke down, however. The issue of confessionalism, which Lee continued to oppose, remained a major sticking-point. Lee eventually pulled out of the talks, and in 1994, established his own group, known as the United Progressive Party. The prospect of two competing Christian parties alarmed many Christian conservative activists, and repeated attempts took place to get the two sides talking once again, but the issue of confessionalism (as well as several other policy differences that had emerged) made this difficult. In November, however, talks re-opened, partly at the urging of Bill van Rij. It seemed obvious to both sides that co-operation would bring mutual benefits ‚Äî Lee had the advantage of a current Parliamentary seat, while the Christian Heritage Party had the advantage of superior organisation and a \\"grass-roots\\" network. Policy-issues once again proved difficult, but on 20 December 1994 a proposed agreement finally emerged. The proposal, which needed ratification by both Christian Heritage and the United Progressives, would have seen both parties dissolved, with a new united, non-confessional party set up in their place. Lee reportedly endorsed the plan, and believed that it would succeed. Graham Capill, of Christian Heritage, showed less enthusiasm. Later, a Christian Heritage Party convention rejected the proposal, although it did offer an alliance which would have seen the parties contest the election together. Lee, deeply disappointed at the rejection, refused the alliance. Van Rij also expressed disappointment with the decision. On 17 May 1995, Lee re-launched his party, calling it the Christian Democrat Party. (The Christian Heritage Party complained to the Electoral Commission that the name too closely resembled their own, but the commission rejected thiscomplaint.). The launch of the party generated considerable attention in the media. Lee also received considerable publicity for his attacks on the \\"Death with Dignity\\" bill, an attempt by dissident National MP Michael Laws to legalise euthanasia.  The Christian Coalition  Occasional attempts at talks between Christian Heritage and the Christian Democrats continued during the early part of 1995, but these proved generally ineffectual. Towards the end of 1995, however, pressure for a united front began to increase substantially. Bill van Rij became particularly prominent in this effort, as did a number of Christian associations which threatened to withhold their endorsement. At the instigation of Murray Smith, an Executive Member with Christian Democrats, more talks took place, and eventually decided an alliance possible, with everything split exactly equally between the two parties. The joint party list would alternate between the Christian Democrats and Christian Heritage, beginning with Lee (as a sitting MP) in first place and Capill in second. While the two parties would campaign together, they would function separately in Parliament. The new Christian Coalition launched on 29 March 1996. It received considerable public attention, and prospered in opinion-polls. The coalition issued its manifesto in September, though ‚Äî due to an inability to resolve certain differences between the two parties ‚Äî the manifesto lacked a degree of detail. The Christian Heritage Party expressed a certain amount of dissatisfaction over the manifesto, which it considered \\"too moderate\\". Lee and the Christian Democrats, however, strongly believed moderation crucial to electoral success, and that Christian Heritage's more extreme policies would alienate many voters. Even with Lee's attempt at moderation, however, the party's more controversial views tended to receive the most media attention, and many criticised the coalition as \\"extremist\\". In the 1996 election itself, the Christian Coalition gained 4.33% of the vote. This fell short of the 5% necessary for proportional representation under the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) system, and none of the party's electorate candidates won a seat. As many polls had once shown the coalition as passing the 5% threshold, this result led to disappointment in some circles. Considerable acrimony ensued between Christian Heritage and the Christian Democrats, with both believing that the other had caused the loss. Christian Heritage generally believed that the Christian Democrats had \\"watered down\\" the coalition's message in the name of political pragmatism, surrendering the moral high ground and giving up the party's clear focus. The Christian Democrats, on the other hand, said that Christian Heritage's extremism and unwillingness to compromise had led to the defeat. Each side essentially blamed the other for dragging the coalition down. In May 1997, the Christian Coalition dissolved, and its constituent parties went their separate ways. Shortly afterwards, Bill van Rij left Christian Heritage and joined the Christian Democrats, blaming Capill for the collapse of the Coalition. A number of other senior Christian Heritage members, led by a former Deputy Leader, Geoff Hounsell, also resigned; and the party expelled others. Ex-members joined the Christian Democrats following an unsuccessful attempt to have Christian Heritage agree to a merger with Christian Democrats. After the Christian Coalition = Christian Heritage = The Christian Heritage Party remained somewhat bitter about the collapse of the Christian Coalition. While considerable tension had existed between Christian Heritage and the Christian Democrats, Graham Capill apparently believed a resolution possible. After the Christian Democrats left, however, Christian Heritage re-affirmed all its traditional policies, including those that had seemed too extreme for the Coalition. Christian Heritage stood Ewen McQueen as its candidate in the 1998 Taranaki-King Country byelection. McQueen out-polled candidates for the larger New Zealand First and Green parties. Six months before the 1999 general election, Frank Grover, leader of the Liberal Party, a component of the Alliance, defected to Christian Heritage, giving it one seat in Parliament. Grover had won election as an Alliance list MP in 1996. High-profile broadcaster Philip Sherry also joined the party in 1999 and stood in the number 2 position on the party list. Christian Heritage gained 2.4% of the vote in the 1999 election, well short of the threshold for entering Parliament, although enough to make it easily the largest party outside parliament. In the 2002 general election, Australian political consultant David Elliot, a prominent campaigner against republicanism in Australia, became the campaign manager for Christian Heritage. A strategy developed of focusing on a single electorate, Wairarapa, whereby Christian Heritage could gain entry to parliament and bypass the 5% requirement. However, the result proved disappointing ‚Äì the party gained only 1.4% of the vote, and its Wairarapa candidate, deputy leader Merepeka Raukawa- Tait, came third. Christian Heritage's support defected to United Future New Zealand, a merger of Future New Zealand (a successor to the Christian Democrats) and Peter Dunne's United New Zealand, which had occurred in 2000. In 2003, Capill stepped down as party leader and Ewen McQueen succeeded him. The party renamed itself Christian Heritage New Zealand (CHNZ). In 2005 a court convicted former leader Capill for the repeated rape and sexual violation of a girl aged eight, and jailed him for nine years. The new Christian Heritage leadership condemned Capill's conduct. On 3 October 2006, ex-CHNZ Leader Ewen McQueen announced that Christian Heritage would disband to allow \\"new things to arise in Christian politics in New Zealand\\". Former Christian Heritage Leader, Ewen McQueen announced that the hypothetical new party would \\"make a strong and clear stand for the importance of family life, the primacy of marriage and the sanctity of human life.\\" McQueen later joined the New Zealand National Party and unsuccessfully stood for the nomination for the Epsom electorate in 2011. debate continued over whether Christian Heritage ever amounted to anything more than a \\"testimonial party\\". As noted above, this model of politics refers to a particular model of partisan 'politics of principle' that eschews pragmatic political objectives. If this is the case, then there are certain implications. As the Netherlands has a demographically based electoral system, this means that the testimonial party model could rely on Reformed fundamentalist constituencies in Zeeland, Veluwe and parts of Overijssel, the Dutch \\"Bible Belt.\\" However, New Zealand's Mixed Member Proportional electoral system imposes a five percent threshold before a party that has no constituency seat representation can be represented within the New Zealand Parliament, as does its own German model. As CHNZ never cleared that threshold, it may therefore be seen as an imported 'testimonial party' model that did not work in a foreign political context or electoral system. By contrast, United Future New Zealand worked that same electoral system well. However, Christian Heritage's constitution seemed to rule out Christian Heritage functioning as a purely \\"testimonial party\\". While it allowed as an objective of the party to \\"promote and uphold biblical principles\\", the constitution went on to state that the party had as a goal to \\"gain seats in parliament so that it can have a direct influence on legislation, policy, and the governing of New Zealand.\\" = Christian Democrats, Future NZ, and the Kiwi Party = The Christian Democrats, by contrast, took a considerably different path. Not long after the Christian Coalition fell apart, Graeme Lee announced that he would step down as leader of the party. He had contemplated retiring for some time, and had already determined that if the Coalition failed he would make his exit from politics. For some considerable period of time the party remained with Lee as temporary leader, as no satisfactory new candidate had emerged. Eventually Anthony Walton became its new leader. Under Walton, the Christian Democrats went further down the non-confessional path, removing all explicit references to Christianity from their party platform. The party adopted the name \\"Future New Zealand\\" (rejecting \\"Future Vision\\" as a proposed alternative), and positioned itself as a \\"values-based\\" rather than as a religion-based party. Future New Zealand contested the 1999 general election but gained only 1.1% of the party vote. The party considered becoming an apolitical lobby-group, but led by its General Secretary, Murray Smith, who had instigated discussions with Peter Dunne, the leader of United New Zealand and the holder of a \\"safe\\" constituency seat, the party decided to explore a coalition with United New Zealand instead. Following further discussions with United, the two parties entered into a coalition to contest the 2002 general election under the name United Future New Zealand. The group gained 6.7% of the party vote, giving it eight seats. In 2003 the two parties merged. For a time there was debate as to whether to classify the resultant group as a Christian party, but the party's rejection of that label appears to have clarified matters. According to United Future, the party does indeed have a grounding in traditional values, but remains open to anyone who shares those values, not merely to Christians. In the 2005 general election, United Future's support slump to 2.67%, leaving it with only three MPs. The precise reasons for this remain difficult to identify, but it appears that many former Christian supporters of United Future cast their votes for the National Party in the 2005 election. In 2006‚Äì2007, Peter Dunne decided to vote in favour of a bill banning parental corporal punishment of children, while his surviving party caucus-members, Gordon Copeland and Judy Turner voted against it. As a result of Dunne's exercise of his right to a conscience vote over this issue, Gordon Copeland seceded from the United Future caucus. Copeland and former UFNZ List MP Larry Baldock announced their intention to re-form an independent Future New Zealand party (renamed the Kiwi Party on 25 January 2008). Baldock has said that over one hundred former UFNZ board members and candidates joined them. However, UFNZ President Denise Krum contested Baldock's assertion over resignations. According to its website, Future New Zealand enrolling the five hundred party-members required for registration under the Electoral Act 1993. It remains unclear whether these figures represent former disgruntled FNZ members who had quit after the merger with United, or new supporters, possibly from the disintegrated Christian Heritage New Zealand. In the event, the 2008 general election was a disappointment for the Kiwi Party. They polled 11,658 votes in total, only 0.54% of the total party votes cast for all New Zealand political parties, and far short of the five-percent threshold required for list-only electoral representation. It even polled behind the avowedly satirical Bill and Ben Party. On 14 October 2011 the Kiwi Party announced that it would not be standing any candidates in the 2011 general election, and that several members had joined the Conservative Party and would be standing for it. On 8 February 2012 the Kiwi Party was de-registered as a political party under the Electoral Act 1993, at its own request and was disbanded. = Destiny New Zealand (2005‚Äì2007) and the Family Party (2007‚Äì2010) = In 2003 another Christian party was formed in New Zealand: Destiny New Zealand, based on the evangelical Destiny Church pastored by controversial figure Brian Tamaki. Bishop Tamaki claimed that Destiny would rule New Zealand by 2008, but in the 2005 general election the party only polled 0.6%, far short of the support required to enter Parliament. This was also far short of the over 2% support managed by the Christian Heritage Party in 1993 and 1999. In April 2007, Brian Tamaki and Samoan-born evangelical Christian and independent former Labour Party MP for Mangere Taito Phillip Field held talks about a possible rapprochement between Destiny New Zealand and Field's fledgling \\"Pacific Party\\". However, Field was under police investigation for allegedly questionable financial dealings. On 18 September 2007, Destiny New Zealand announced that it would de-register itself under the terms of the Electoral Act 1993 to allow the formation of a new composite evangelical/fundamentalist political party. This would have become an amalgam of Destiny New Zealand, Future New Zealand and Taito Phillip Field, if the latter survived the criminal investigations. Richard Lewis and Gordon Copeland would have become joint leaders of the new fundamentalist party. However, reports emerged that Copeland and Future New Zealand had refused to work with Lewis, and had sought to marginalise Brian Tamaki's influence in the proposed new party. This led to recriminations from the National Advisory Committee established to advance this process, including former UFNZ MP Paul Adams and a representative of Field. Richard Lewis and Paul Adams became co-leaders of the Family Party, which hoped to harness Pacific Island immigrant evangelicals in Mangere, South Auckland, who traditionally vote for the Labour Party. Jerry Filipaina stood as their Mangere candidate in the 2008 general election, running against Taito Phillip Field who had formed the New Zealand Pacific Party. The Family Party's hopes proved futile, winning 999 votes in Mangere and coming fourth. Labour's William Sio retook the seat for his party from Taito Phillip Field by 7126 votes. Altogether, the Family Party accumulated only 8176 (0.35%) of total party votes cast in New Zealand, and disbanded in 2010. The New Zealand Pacific Party polled only 8640 (0.37 percent) of the total party votes cast, and did not win another anchoring constituency seat, it lacked representation in the 49th New Zealand Parliament. In September 2011, Taito Philip Field was found guilty of bribery and corruption charges and sentenced to six years imprisonment. =New Conservative Party (2011‚Äì )= The Conservative Party was founded in 2011 by property manager Colin Craig. Although it is not a religious or Christian party, it retains some Christian input. However, party CEO and Epsom candidate Christine Rankin is a Buddhist. The Conservative Party polled 2.65% of the vote in 2011. The party had a stronger showing in 2014, polling 3.97%. In mid-2015, the Conservative Party imploded after the party's founder and main backer Colin Craig resigned following allegations of an inappropriate relationship towards his former press secretary Rachel MacGregor. The scandal led to the resignation of the party's entire board and caused the Conservatives' poll rankings to drop to 0.3% in the Newshub-Reid Research survey in September 2017. The scandal was complicated by infighting within the party between Craig and rival John Stringer and an exchange of lawsuits between Craig, fellow party member John Stringer, New Zealand Taxpayers' Union executive director Jordan Williams, and the right wing blogger Cameron Slater. Following the resignation of Craig, Leighton Baker was elected as the Conservative Party's new leader in September 2015. During the 2017 general election, the Conservatives fielded 27 electoral candidates and 12 party list candidates. Despite the loss of Craig's financial resources, the party managed to rebuild some of its membership. Due to the party's low poll ratings, the Conservatives did not make the cut for the minor parties' debate and were only allocated $52,000 in broadcasting by the New Zealand Electoral Commission. The Conservatives performed poorly during the 2017 election, gaining only 0.2% of the party vote (6,253) and failing to win a seat in Parliament. In November 2017, the Conservatives revamped themselves as the New Conservative Party. The party is led by Leighton Baker and Elliot Ikilei. Besides campaigning on free speech issues and conservative family values, the New Conservatives have advocated citizens' initiated referenda and opposed the United Nations' Global Compact for Migration, the decriminalisation of abortion and euthanasia. At the New Zealand general election 2020, the New Conservatives managed to secure 35,594 votes. Although this was a significant improvement on its polling at the previous New Zealand election in 2017, its total voter share was 1.5%. This fell short of the five percent party list only threshold for representation within the New Zealand Parliament under New Zealand's Mixed Member Proportional electoral system https://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2020_preliminary/electorate- details-72.html =Vision New Zealand (2019‚Äì )= In 2019, a new Christian party called Vision New Zealand was launched under the leadership of Hannah Tamaki, the wife of Destiny Church leader Bishop Brian Tamaki. The party has so far received most attention for its anti-Muslim and anti-Asian views. It has advocated banning the construction of mosques, temples and other foreign buildings of worship, reducing immigration including refugees, and opposing the United Nations' Global Compact for Migration. On October 17, 2020, the Vision New Zealand Party secured 2775 votes at the New Zealand general election 2020. This comprised 0.2% of all votes cast during that election and fell significantly short of the five percent threshold for party list only representation under the Mixed Member Proportional electoral system which has existed in New Zealand since 1996. https://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2020_preliminary/electorate- details-72.html =ONE Party (2020‚Äì )= In June 2020, another Christian party called ONE Party was launched under the leadership of Stephanie Harawira and Edward Shanly. The ONE Party says that it wants to promote a Christian voice in Parliament. The One Party opposes abortion, transgender medical and counselling treatments, and supports Israel. On October 17, 2020, the One Party secured 6470 votes, which comprised 0.3% of the total votes cast at the New Zealand general election 2020. This fell perceptibly short of the five percent threshold for party list only representation within the New Zealand Parliament under New Zealand's Mixed Member Proportional electoral system https://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2020_preliminary/electorate- details-72.html  MƒÅori Christianity  The first significant specifically Christian political party activity in New Zealand came at the behest of the Ratana movement. The Ratana Church, established by MƒÅori spiritual leader Tahupotiki Wiremu Ratana in 1925, gained particularly strong support from MƒÅori of lower socio-economic status. The Ratana movement actively participated in the world of politics, and the first Ratana Member of Parliament gained election in a 1932 by-election. In Parliament, the Ratana movement co-operated closely with the Labour Party, the rising force in New Zealand politics in the 1930s. In the 1935 elections, Ratana won two of the four of the MƒÅori seats, and shortly afterwards, allied itself with the Labour Party, which had won the election. The Labour Party and the Ratana movement have remained closely allied since this point, although the alliance has grown strained at times, and both National and the Maori Party also vie for their support. Piri Wiri Tua Movement In years at least one independent attempt has occurred to bring the Ratana religion to politics ‚Äî the Piri Wiri Tua party, although not part of the Ratana Church, has strong roots in Ratanadom.

He is sometimes described as a 'shepherd' or as a storm god, and as a son of the sky-god Anu. He is sometimes called b√™lu ≈°adƒ´ or b√™l ≈°ad√™, 'lord of the mountain'; d√∫r-hur-sag-g√° sikil-a- ke, 'He who dwells on the pure mountain'; and kur-za-gan ti-[la], 'who inhabits the shining mountain'. In Cappadocian Zinƒçirli inscriptions he is called √¨-li a-bi-a, 'the god of my father'.The Targum from the Beginnings: \\"Tablet 1.\\" Retrieved on September 12, 2010 Accordingly, it has been suggested by L. R. Bailey (1968) and Jean Ouelette (1969), that this B√™l ≈†ad√™ might be the same as the Biblical ‚Äôƒíl ≈†addƒÅi who is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the \\"Priestly source\\" of narrative, according to the documentary hypothesis. B√™l ≈†ad√™ could also have become the fertility-god 'Ba'al', possibly adopted by the Canaanites, a rival and enemy of the Hebrew God YHWH, and famously combatted by the Hebrew prophet Elijah. Amurru also has storm-god features. Like Adad, Amurru bears the epithet ramƒÅn 'thunderer', and he is even called bƒÅriqu 'hurler of the thunderbolt' and Adad ≈°a a-bu-be 'Adad of the deluge'. Yet his iconography is distinct from that of Adad, and he sometimes appears alongside Adad with a baton of power or throwstick, while Adad bears a conventional thunderbolt. Wife Amurru's wife is usually the goddess A≈°ratum (see Asherah) who in northwest Semitic tradition and Hittite tradition appears as wife of the god El which suggests that Amurru may indeed have been a variation of that god. If Amurru was identical with ƒíl, it would explain why so few Amorite names are compounded with the name Amurru, but so many are compounded with Il; that is, with El. Another tradition about Amurru's wife (or one of Amurru's wives) gives her name as Belit-Sheri, 'Lady of the Desert'. A third tradition appears in a Sumerian poem in pastoral style, which relates how the god Martu came to marry AdgÃÉar-kidug the daughter of the god Numushda of the city of Inab. It contains a speech expressing urbanite Sumerian disgust at uncivilized, nomadic Amurru life which AdgÃÉar- kidug ignores, responding only: \\"I will marry Martu!\\".

Examples include the plane, the lateral surface of a cylinder or cone, a conical surface with elliptical directrix, the right conoid, the helicoid, and the tangent developable of a smooth curve in space. A ruled surface can be described as the set of points swept by a moving straight line. For example, a cone is formed by keeping one point of a line fixed whilst moving another point along a circle. A surface is doubly ruled if through every one of its points there are two distinct lines that lie on the surface. The hyperbolic paraboloid and the hyperboloid of one sheet are doubly ruled surfaces. The plane is the only surface which contains at least three distinct lines through each of its points . The properties of being ruled or doubly ruled are preserved by projective maps, and therefore are concepts of projective geometry. In algebraic geometry ruled surfaces are sometimes considered to be surfaces in affine or projective space over a field, but they are also sometimes considered as abstract algebraic surfaces without an embedding into affine or projective space, in which case \\"straight line\\" is understood to mean an affine or projective line.  Definition and parametric representation  Ruled surface generated by two B√©zier curves as directrices (red, green) A two dimensional differentiable manifold is called ruled surface, if it is the union of a one parametric family of lines. The lines of this family are the generators of the ruled surface. A ruled surface can be described by a parametric representation of the form * (CR) \\\\quad \\\\mathbf x(u,v)= {\\\\color{red}\\\\mathbf c(u)} + v\\\\;{\\\\color{blue}\\\\mathbf r(u)}\\\\ ,\\\\ v\\\\in \\\\R \\\\ , . Any curve \\\\;v\\\\mapsto \\\\mathbf x(u_0,v)\\\\; with fixed parameter u=u_0 is a generator (line) and the curve \\\\; u\\\\mapsto \\\\mathbf c(u) \\\\; is the directrix of the representation. The vectors \\\\; \\\\mathbf r(u) e \\\\bf 0\\\\; describe the directions of the generators. The directrix may collapse to a point (in case of a cone, see example below). Alternatively the ruled surface (CR) can be described by * (CD) \\\\quad \\\\mathbf x(u,v)= (1-v)\\\\;{\\\\color{red}\\\\mathbf c(u)} + v\\\\; {\\\\color{green}\\\\mathbf d(u)}\\\\ with the second directrix \\\\; \\\\mathbf d(u)= \\\\mathbf c(u) + \\\\mathbf r(u)\\\\;. Alternatively, one can start with two non intersecting curves \\\\mathbf c(u), \\\\mathbf d(u) as directrices, and get by (CD) a ruled surface with line directions \\\\; \\\\mathbf r(u)= \\\\mathbf d(u) - \\\\mathbf c(u)\\\\ . For the generation of a ruled surface by two directrices (or one directrix and the vectors of line directions) not only the geometric shape of these curves are essential but also the special parametric representations of them influence the shape of the ruled surface (see examples a), d)). For theoretical investigations representation (CR) is more advantageous, because the parameter v appears only once.  Examples  cylinder, cone a) Right circular cylinder: \\\\ x^2+y^2=a^2\\\\ : : \\\\mathbf x(u,v)=(a\\\\cos u,a\\\\sin u,v)^T :::= {\\\\color{red}(a\\\\cos u,a\\\\sin u,0)^T}\\\\; +\\\\; v\\\\;{\\\\color{blue}(0,0,1)^T} :::= (1-v)\\\\;{\\\\color{red}(a\\\\cos u,a\\\\sin u,0)^T}\\\\; + \\\\; v\\\\;{\\\\color{green}(a\\\\cos u,a\\\\sin u,1)^T} \\\\ . with :\\\\mathbf c(u) =(a\\\\cos u,a\\\\sin u,0)^T\\\\ , \\\\ \\\\mathbf r(u)=(0,0,1)^T \\\\ , \\\\ \\\\mathbf d(u)= (a\\\\cos u,a\\\\sin u,1)^T \\\\ . b) Right circular cone: \\\\ x^2+y^2=z^2\\\\ : : \\\\mathbf x(u,v)=(\\\\cos u,\\\\sin u,1)^T\\\\; +\\\\; v\\\\;(\\\\cos u,\\\\sin u,1)^T :::= (1-v)\\\\;(\\\\cos u,\\\\sin u,1)^T\\\\; + \\\\; v\\\\;(2\\\\cos u,2\\\\sin u,2)^T . with \\\\quad \\\\mathbf c(u) =(\\\\cos u,\\\\sin u,1)^T\\\\; = \\\\; \\\\mathbf r(u) \\\\ , \\\\quad \\\\mathbf d(u)= (2\\\\cos u,2\\\\sin u,2)^T \\\\ . In this case one could have used the apex as the directrix, i.e.: \\\\ \\\\mathbf c(u) = (0,0,0)^T\\\\ and \\\\ \\\\mathbf r(u)=(\\\\cos u,\\\\sin u,1)^T\\\\ as the line directions. For any cone one can choose the apex as the directrix. This case shows: The directrix of a ruled surface may degenerate to a point. helicoid c) Helicoid: :\\\\mathbf x(u,v)=\\\\;(v\\\\cos u,v\\\\sin u, ku)^T\\\\; ::: = \\\\; (0,0,ku)^T \\\\; +\\\\; v\\\\;(\\\\cos u, \\\\sin u,0)^T\\\\ ::: = \\\\; (1-v)\\\\;(0,0,ku)^T \\\\; + \\\\; v\\\\; (\\\\cos u,\\\\sin u, ku)^T \\\\ . The directrix \\\\ \\\\mathbf c(u) =(0,0,ku)^T\\\\; is the z-axis, the line directions are \\\\; \\\\mathbf r(u) =\\\\ (\\\\cos u, \\\\sin u,0)^T \\\\; and the second directrix \\\\ \\\\mathbf d(u)=(\\\\cos u,\\\\sin u, ku)^T \\\\ is a helix. The helicoid is a special case of the ruled generalized helicoids. d) Cylinder, cone and hyperboloids: hyperboloid of one sheet for \\\\varphi=63^\\\\circ The parametric representation :\\\\mathbf x(u,v)= (1-v)\\\\;(\\\\cos (u-\\\\varphi),\\\\sin (u-\\\\varphi),-1)^T\\\\; + \\\\; v\\\\;(\\\\cos (u+\\\\varphi),\\\\sin(u+\\\\varphi),1)^T has two horizontal circles as directrices. The additional parameter \\\\varphi allows to vary the parametric representations of the circles. For : \\\\varphi=0 \\\\ one gets the cylinder x^2+y^2=1, for : \\\\varphi=\\\\pi/2 \\\\ one gets the cone x^2+y^2=z^2 and for : 0<\\\\varphi<\\\\pi/2 \\\\ one gets a hyperboloid of one sheet with equation \\\\ \\\\tfrac{x^2+y^2}{a^2}-\\\\tfrac{z^2}{c^2}=1 \\\\ and the semi axes \\\\ a=\\\\cos\\\\varphi\\\\;,\\\\; c=\\\\cot\\\\varphi. A hyperboloid of one sheet is a doubly ruled surface. Hyperbolic paraboloid e) Hyperbolic paraboloid: If the two directrices in (CD) are the lines : \\\\mathbf c(u) =(1-u)\\\\mathbf a_1 + u\\\\mathbf a_2, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf d(u)=(1-u)\\\\mathbf b_1 + u\\\\mathbf b_2 one gets :\\\\mathbf x(u,v)=(1-v)\\\\big((1-u)\\\\mathbf a_1 + u\\\\mathbf a_2\\\\big)\\\\ +\\\\ v\\\\big((1-u)\\\\mathbf b_1 + u\\\\mathbf b_2\\\\big)\\\\ , which is the hyperbolic paraboloid that interpolates the 4 points \\\\ \\\\mathbf a_1,\\\\;\\\\mathbf a_2,\\\\;\\\\mathbf b_1,\\\\;\\\\mathbf b_2\\\\ bilinearly.G. Farin: Curves and Surfaces for Computer Aided Geometric Design, Academic Press, 1990, , p. 250 Obviously the ruled surface is a doubly ruled surface, because any point lies on two lines of the surface.

Hence the given realization of a M√∂bius strip is not developable. But there exist developable M√∂bius strips.W. Wunderlich: √úber ein abwickelbares M√∂biusband, Monatshefte f√ºr Mathematik 66, 1962, S. 276-289.  Tangent planes, developable surfaces  For the considerations below any necessary derivative is supposed to exist. For the determination of the normal vector at a point one needs the partial derivatives of the representation \\\\quad \\\\mathbf x(u,v)= \\\\mathbf c(u) + v\\\\;\\\\mathbf r(u) : :\\\\mathbf x_u= \\\\mathbf \\\\dot c(u)+ v\\\\;\\\\mathbf \\\\dot r(u)\\\\ ,\\\\quad \\\\mathbf x_v= \\\\;\\\\mathbf r(u) Hence the normal vector is *\\\\mathbf n= \\\\mathbf x_u \\\\times \\\\mathbf x_v = \\\\mathbf \\\\dot c\\\\times \\\\mathbf r + v( \\\\mathbf \\\\dot r \\\\times \\\\mathbf r) \\\\ . Because of \\\\mathbf n \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf r = 0 (A mixed product with two equal vectors is always 0 !), vector \\\\mathbf r (u_0) is a tangent vector at any point \\\\mathbf x(u_0,v). The tangent planes along this line are all the same, if \\\\mathbf \\\\dot r \\\\times \\\\mathbf r is a multiple of \\\\mathbf \\\\dot c\\\\times \\\\mathbf r . This is possible only, if the three vectors \\\\mathbf \\\\dot c\\\\; ,\\\\; \\\\mathbf \\\\dot r\\\\;,\\\\; \\\\mathbf r\\\\ lie in a plane, i.e. they are linear dependent. The linear dependency of three vectors can be checked using the determinant of these vectors: *The tangent planes along the line \\\\mathbf x(u_0,v)= \\\\mathbf c(u_0) + v\\\\;\\\\mathbf r(u_0) are equal, if :: \\\\det(\\\\mathbf \\\\dot c(u_0)\\\\;,\\\\;\\\\mathbf \\\\dot r(u_0)\\\\;, \\\\;\\\\mathbf r(u_0)) \\\\; = \\\\; 0 \\\\ . The importance of this determinant condition shows the following statement: *A ruled surface \\\\quad \\\\mathbf x(u,v)= \\\\mathbf c(u) + v\\\\;\\\\mathbf r(u) is developable into a plane, if for any point the Gauss curvature vanishes. This is exactly the case if :::\\\\det(\\\\mathbf \\\\dot c\\\\;,\\\\;\\\\mathbf \\\\dot r\\\\;, \\\\;\\\\mathbf r) \\\\; = \\\\; 0 \\\\quad :at any point is true.W. K√ºhnel: Differentialgeometrie, p. 58‚Äì60 The generators of any ruled surface coalesce with one family of its asymptotic lines. For developable surfaces they also form one family of its lines of curvature. It can be shown that any developable surface is a cone, a cylinder or a surface formed by all tangents of a space curve.G.

This immediately implies that there is a projective line on the surface through any given point, and this condition is now often used as the definition of a ruled surface: ruled surfaces are defined to be abstract projective surfaces satisfying this condition that there is a projective line through any point. This is equivalent to saying that they are birational to the product of a curve and a projective line. Sometimes a ruled surface is defined to be one satisfying the stronger condition that it has a fibration over a curve with fibers that are projective lines. This excludes the projective plane, which has a projective line though every point but cannot be written as such a fibration. Ruled surfaces appear in the Enriques classification of projective complex surfaces, because every algebraic surface of Kodaira dimension -\\\\infty is a ruled surface (or a projective plane, if one uses the restrictive definition of ruled surface). Every minimal projective ruled surface other than the projective plane is the projective bundle of a 2-dimensional vector bundle over some curve. The ruled surfaces with base curve of genus 0 are the Hirzebruch surfaces. Ruled surfaces in architecture Doubly ruled surfaces are the inspiration for curved hyperboloid structures that can be built with a latticework of straight elements, namely: * Hyperbolic paraboloids, such as saddle roofs. * Hyperboloids of one sheet, such as cooling towers and some trash bins. The RM-81 Agena rocket engine employed straight cooling channels that were laid out in a ruled surface to form the throat of the nozzle section.

It is the feast day of Nicholas of Myra with particular regard to his reputation as a bringer of gifts. In the European countries of Germany and Poland, boys have traditionally dressed as bishops and begged alms for the poor. In Ukraine, children wait for St. Nicholas to come and to put a present under their pillows provided that the children were good during the year. Children who behaved badly may expect to find a twig or a piece of coal under their pillows. In the Netherlands, Dutch children put out a clog filled with hay and a carrot for Saint Nicholas' horse. On Saint Nicholas Day, gifts are tagged with personal humorous rhymes written by the sender. In the United States, one custom associated with Saint Nicholas Day is children leaving their shoes in the foyer on Saint Nicholas Eve in hope that Saint Nicholas will place some coins on the soles. The American Santa Claus, as well as the British Father Christmas, derive from Saint Nicholas. \\"Santa Claus\\" is itself derived in part from the Dutch Sinterklaas, the saint's name in that language. However, the gift giving associated with these descendant figures is associated with Christmas Day rather than Saint Nicholas Day itself.Saint Nicholas saved three children lost in the countryside. These children were kidnapped by butcher before being saved by Saint Nicholas and returned to their parents. European people celebrate Christmas from 5-25 December. The U.S., however, doesn't publicly celebrate Saint Nicholas' Day. Traditions by continent Europe = Balkans = A modern metal icon of St. Nicholas by the Bulgarian artist Georgi 'Chapa' Chapkanov. Gilbert House, Stanley, Falkland Islands. 2006 Christmas stamp, Ukraine, showing St. Nicholas and children Among Albanians, Saint Nicholas is known as Shen'Koll√´ and is venerated by most Catholic families, even those from villages that are devoted to other saints. The Feast of Saint Nicholas is celebrated on the evening before 6 December, known as Shen'Kolli i Dimnit (Saint Nicholas of Winter), as well as on the commemoration of the interring of his bones in Bari, the evening before 9 May, known as Shen'Kolli i Majit (Saint Nicholas of May). Albanian Catholics often swear by Saint Nicholas, saying \\"Pasha Shejnti Shen'Kollin!\\" (\\"May I see Holy Saint Nicholas!\\"), indicating the importance of this saint in Albanian culture, especially among the Albanians of Mal√´sia. On the eve of his feast day, Albanians will light a candle and abstain from meat, preparing a feast of roasted lamb and pork, to be served to guests after midnight. Guests will greet each other, saying, \\"Nata e Shen'Kollit ju nihmoft√´!\\" (\\"May the Night of Saint Nicholas help you!\\") and other such blessings. The bones of Albania's greatest hero, George Kastrioti, were also interred in the Church of Saint Nicholas in Lezha, Albania, upon his death.A Dictionary of Albanian Religion, Mythology, and Folk Culture, Robert Elsie NYU Press, 2001, p. 189 In Greece, Saint Nicholas does not carry an especial association with gift-giving, as this tradition is carried over to St. Basil of Caesarea, celebrated on New Year's Day. St. Nicholas is the protector of sailors, he is considered the patron saint of the Greek Navy, military and merchant alike, and his day is marked by festivities aboard all ships and boats, at sea and in port. It is also associated with the preceding feasts of St. Barbara (4 December), St. Savvas (5 December), and the following feast of St. Anne (9 December); all these are often collectively called the \\" Nikolob√°rbara\\", and are considered a succession of days that heralds the onset of truly wintry cold weather in the country. Therefore, by tradition, homes should have already been laid with carpets, removed for the warm season, by St. Andrew's Day (30 November), a week ahead of the Nikolob√°rbara. In Serbia, and among the Serb people living across the world, Saint Nicholas is the most widely celebrated family patron saint, celebrated as the feast day (Slava) of Nikoljdan. Since Nikoljdan always falls in the fasting period preceding Christmas, it is celebrated according to the Eastern Orthodox fasting rules (\\"Post\\"). Fasting refers in this context to the eating of a restricted diet for reasons of religion. This entails the complete avoidance of animal-sourced food products (meat, milk, dairy products, and eggs). Fish may be eaten on certain days In Bulgaria, Saint Nicholas Day is celebrated on 6 December as Nikulden. Families invite relatives, sponsors, and neighbors for a meal of fish (usually ribnik, a carp wrapped in dough) and two loaves of ceremonial bread, all of which are blessed at church or at home. The host wafts incense over the table, then lifts and breaks the bread. Bulgarians also observe 6 December as the name day for those with the names Nikola, Nikolay, Kolyo, Nikolina, Neno, Nenka, Nikoleta and Nina. =Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg and Lower Rhineland (Germany)= Sinterklaas in the Netherlands in 2007 In the Netherlands, the primary occasion for gift-giving is 5 December, when his feast day is celebrated. In Belgium they celebrate Sinterklaas on the morning of 6 December. In the days leading up to 5 or 6 December (starting when Saint Nicholas has arrived by steamboat around mid-November), young children put their shoes in front of the chimneys and sing Sinterklaas songs. Often they put a carrot or some hay in their shoes, as a gift to St. Nicholas' horse. In recent years the horse has been named Schimmel or Amerigo in the Netherlands and Slecht Weer Vandaag (bad weather today) in Flanders. The next morning they find a small present in their shoes, ranging from sweets to marbles or some other small toy. On the evening of 5 December, Sinterklaas impersonators (often parents or close by family) bring presents to children who have behaved well (or not; they often both receive presents) in the past year. In practice, just as with Santa Claus, all children receive gifts without distinction. This is often done by placing a bag filled with presents outside the house or living room, after which a neighbor or parent bangs on the door or window, pretending to be Sinterklaas assistant. Another option is to hire or ask someone to dress up as Sinterklaas and deliver the presents personally. Sinterklaas wears a bishop's robes including a red cape and mitre and is assisted by many mischievous helpers, called 'Zwarte Pieten' (\\"Black Petes\\") or \\"P√®re Fouettard\\" in the French-speaking part of Belgium, with black faces and colourful Moorish dress, dating back two centuries. In the past, it was said that the Zwarte Pieten took all the naughty children, put them into sacks, and Sinterklaas took them with him to Spain (it is believed that Sinterklaas comes from Spain, where he returns after 5 December), in order to scare the children. Therefore, many Sinterklaas songs still allude to a watching Zwarte Piet and a judging Sinterklaas. Recently, there has been a recurrent discussion about the perceived politically incorrect nature of Zwarte Piet. In particular Dutch citizens with backgrounds from Suriname might feel offended by the Dutch slavery history connected to this emblem and regard the representation of Zwarte Piet as racist. Others state that the black skin color of Zwarte Piet originates in his profession as a chimney sweep, hence the delivery of packages through the chimney. In recent years, Christmas, along with Santa Claus, has been pushed by shopkeepers as another gift-giving festival, with some success; although, especially for young children, Saint Nicholas Eve is still much more important than Christmas. The rise of Father Christmas (known in Dutch as de Kerstman) is often cited as an example of globalization and Americanisation.Dekker, Roodenburg & Rooijakkers (redd.): Volkscultuur. Een inleiding in de Nederlandse ethnology, Uitgeverij SUN, Nijmegen, 2000: pp. 213‚Äì14 On the Frisian islands (Waddeneilanden), the Sinterklaas feast has developed independently into traditions very different from the one on the mainland.http://www.stichtingtoverbal.nl/nl/artikelen/folklore/sundrums/ In Luxembourg, Kleeschen is accompanied by the Houseker a frightening helper wearing a brown monk's habit. =Eastern Europe= In Slovenia, Miklav≈æ (Sveti Miklav≈æ) and in Croatia, Nikolaus (Sveti Nikola) who visits on Saint Nicholas day (Nikolinje in Croatia and \\"Miklav≈æevanje\\" in Slovenia) brings gifts to children commending them for their good behavior over the past year and exhorting them to continue in the same manner in the year to come. If they fail to do so they will receive a visit from \\"Parkelj\\" or Krampus who traditionally leaves a rod, an instrument their parents will use to discipline them. Mikul√°s in Eƒçka (Vojvodina ‚Äì Serbia) brings joy to children in 2010. In Hungary, Croatia, Ukraine and Romania, children typically leave their boots on the windowsill on the evening of 5 December. By next morning Nikolaus (Szent Mikl√≥s traditionally but more commonly known as Mikul√°s in Hungary or Mo≈ü Nicolae (Sf√¢ntul Nicolae) in Romania) and in Ukraine Svyatyy Mykolay leaves candy and gifts if they have been good, or a rod (Hungarian: virg√°cs, Romanian: nuielu≈ü«é) if they have been bad (most children end up getting small gifts, but also a small rod). In Hungary and Croatia he is often accompanied by the Krampusz, the frightening helper who is out to take away the bad ones. In Slovenia, Saint Nikolaus (Miklav≈æ) is accompanied by an angel and a devil (parkelj) corresponding to the Austrian Krampus. In Ukraine, St Nicholas (Mykolay) visits good children during the night () and puts presents under the pillow. For the naughty children Mykolay brings a rod (Rizka) so parents can use it to discipline them. Usually Mykolay is accompanied by an Angel (Janhol) and a Devil (Chort). =France= Saint Nicholas originates primarily in Alsace, Nord-Pas-de-Calais (French Flanders), Champagne, Franche-Comt√© and in Lorraine, where he is patron. A little donkey carries baskets filled with children's gifts, biscuits and sweets. The whole family gets ready for the saint's arrival on 6 December, with grandparents telling stories of the saint. The most popular one (also the subject of a popular French children's song) is of three children who wandered away and got lost. Cold and hungry, a wicked butcher lured them into his shop where he killed them and salted them away in a large tub. Through St. Nicolas' help the boys were revived and returned to their families, earning him a reputation as protector of children. The evil butcher has followed St. Nicolas in penance ever since as P√®re Fouettard. In France, statues and paintings often portray this event, showing the saint with children in a barrel. Bakeries and home kitchens are hives of activity as spiced gingerbread biscuits and mannala (a brioche shaped like the saint) are baked. In schools, children learn songs and poems and create arts and crafts about St. Nicolas, while in nursery schools, a man portraying St. Nicolas gives away chocolates and sometimes little presents. He is sometimes accompanied by an actor playing P√®re Fouettard, who, like his German counterpart Krampus, carries switches to threaten the children who fear he will advise St. Nicolas to pass them by on his gift-giving rounds. =Central Europe= St. Nicholas and his companions in Haunzenbergers√∂ll, Bavaria (1986) In Northern Germany, Sankt Nikolaus is usually celebrated on a small scale. Many children put a boot called Nikolaus-Stiefel (Nikolaus boot) outside the front door on the night of 5 December. St. Nicholas fills the boot with gifts and sweets overnight, and at the same time checks up on the children to see if they were good, polite and helpful the last year. If they were not, they will have a stick (eine Rute) in their boots instead. Nicholas is often portrayed in Bavarian folklore as being accompanied by Knecht Ruprecht who inquires of the children if they have been saying their prayers, and if not, he shakes his bag of ashes at them, or beats them with a stick. Sometimes a Nikolaus impersonator also visits the children at school or in their homes and asks them if they have been good (sometimes ostensibly checking his golden book for their record), handing out presents on the basis of their behavior. This has become more lenient in recent decades, and this task is often taken over by the Weihnachtsmann (Father Christmas). In more Catholic regions, St. Nikolaus is dressed very much like a bishop, rides on a horse, and is welcomed at public places by large crowds. He has a long beard, and loves children, except when they have been naughty. This tradition has been kept alive annually. In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Mikul√°≈°and in Poland Miko≈Çaj is often also accompanied by an angel (andƒõl / anjel / anio≈Ç / anhel) who acts as a counterweight to the ominous devil or Knecht Ruprecht (ƒçert/czart). Additionally, in Czech Republic, Poland and in Slovakia children find the candy and small gifts under the pillow, in their shoes or behind the window the evening of 5 December or the morning of 6 December. In Austria, Bavaria and Tyrol (Austro-Bavarian regions), St. Nicholas is accompanied by Krampus, represented as a beast-like creature, generally demonic in appearance. Krampus is thought to punish children during the Yule season who had misbehaved, and to capture particularly naughty children in his sack and carry them away to his lair. The creature has roots in Germanic folklore; however, its influence has spread far beyond German borders, in Austria, southern Bavaria, South Tyrol, northern Friuli, Hungary, Slovenia, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Croatia. 5 December is Krampus Night or Krampusnacht, in which the hairy devil appears on the streets. Traditionally young men dress up as the Krampus during the first week of December, particularly on the evening of 5 December (the eve of Saint Nicholas day on many church calendars), and roam the streets frightening children with rusty chains and bells. Sometimes accompanying St. Nicholas and sometimes on his own, Krampus visits homes and businesses. The Saint usually appears in the Eastern Rite vestments of a bishop, and he carries a ceremonial staff. Nicholas dispenses gifts, while Krampus supplies coal and the ruten bundles. (Video Krampuslauf Lienz 2010) Krampus is featured on holiday greeting cards called Krampuskarten. There are many names for Krampus, as well as many regional variations in portrayal and celebration. Krampus parade in P√∂rtschach am W√∂rthersee (2013) Nikolaus-Umzug in Fribourg, Switzerland (2009) In Swiss folklore, St. Nicholas is known as Samichlaus (like Dutch Sinterklaas a corruption of the name of St. Nicholas). He is accompanied by the Schmutzli a frightening helper wearing a brown monk's habit. The Christmas gift-bringer is not Samichlaus, but the Christchindli. =Italy= St. Nicholas (San Nicola) is the patron of the city of Bari, where it is believed he is buried. Its deeply felt celebration is called the Festa di San Nicola, held on 7‚Äì9 May. In particular on 8 May the relics of the saint are carried on a boat on the sea in front of the city with many boats following (Festa a mare). As Saint Nicholas is said to protect children and virgins, on 6 December there is a ritual called the Rito delle nubili: unmarried women wishing to find a husband can attend to an early-morning Mass, in which they have to turn around a column 7 times. A similar tradition is currently observed in Sassari, where during the day of Saint Nicholas, patron of the city, gifts are given to young women who need help to get married. In the provinces of Trieste, Udine, Belluno, Bari (Terlizzi and Molfetta), South Tyrol, Trentino and in the eastern part of the Province of Treviso, St. Nicholas (San Niccol√≤) is celebrated with gifts given to children on the morning of 6 December and with a fair called Fiera di San Niccol√≤ during the first weeks of December. Depending on the cultural background, in some families this celebration is more important than Christmas. Like in Austria, in South Tyrol Saint Nicholas comes with krampuses. Instead, in Val Canale (Udine) Saint Nicholas comes to chase the krampuses: after a parade of krampuses running after people, Saint Nicholas comes on a chariot and give gifts to children (Video \\"San Nicol√≤ caccia i Krampus a Tarvisio\\" 6.12.2010) =Malta= In Suhuan, St. Nicholas (, less commonly San Niklaw) is the patron saint of the town of Siƒ°ƒ°iewi where his feast is celebrated on the last Sunday in June. The parish church, dedicated to the saint, was built between 1676 and 1693. It was designed by the Maltese architect, Lorenzo Gaf√†, with the portico and naves being added by Nicola Zammit in the latter half of the 19th century. The ruins of a former parish church are still visible and have recently undergone restoration. =Portugal= In one city (Guimar√£es) in Portugal, St. Nicholas (S√£o Nicolau) has been celebrated since the Middle Ages as the patron saint of high-school students, in the so-called Nicolinas, a group of festivities that occur from 29 November to 7 December each year. In the rest of Portugal this is not celebrated. =Orthodox Slavic countries= Celebration of Slavic cakes, grain and wine A depiction of Saint Nicholas and his companions visiting children Nikoljdan (; ; ; ) is the patron saint day (Krsna Slava, or Krsno ime, a Serb tradition) of Saint Nicholas, celebrated on December 6 (Gregorian calendar, December 19 on Julian). Since the feast of Saint Nicholas always falls in the fasting period preceding the Christmas, the feast is celebrated according to the Eastern Orthodox Church fasting rules (\\"Post\\"). Fasting refers in this context to the eating of a restricted diet (no animal products or dairy products etc.), such as fish (see Eastern Orthodox fasting). =Spain= St. Nicholas (\\"San Nicol√°s\\") is the patron of the University of Valladolid, one of the medieval universities of Spain, and Alicante city. Middle East =Lebanon= Saint Nicholas is celebrated by all the Christian communities in Lebanon: Catholic, Greek Orthodox, and Armenian. Many places, churches, convents, and schools are named in honor of Saint Nicholas, such as Escalier Saint-Nicolas des Arts, Saint Nicolas Garden, and Saint Nicolas Greek Orthodox Cathedral. Palestine Saint Nicholas Church, Beit Jala Saint Nicholas is the patron saint of Beit Jala, a town west of Bethlehem where the saint spent four years of his life on pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Every 19 December (6 December in the Julian Calendar), a solemn Divine Liturgy is held in the Orthodox Church of St. Nicholas, and is usually followed by parades, exhibitions, and other activities. Palestinians of all denominations come to Beit Jala and participate in the prayers and celebrations. North America Saint Nicholas Society While feasts of Saint Nicholas are not observed nationally, cities with strong German influences like Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Evansville, Indiana; Cincinnati, Ohio; Fredericksburg, Texas; Newport News, Virginia; St. Louis, Missouri; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania celebrate St. Nick's Day on a scale similar to the German custom.Meg Kissinger, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel 1999, \\"St. Nick's Day can be a nice little surprise\\" Although not as widespread as in other countries, some people in the United States celebrate a separate St Nicholas Day by putting their shoes outside their bedroom doors or hanging an empty stocking by the fireplace on the evening of 5 December. St Nicholas then comes during the night. On the morning of 6 December, those people will find their shoes/stockings filled with gifts and sugary treats. Widespread adoption of the tradition has spread among the German, Polish, Belgian and Dutch communities throughout the United States. Americans who celebrate Saint Nicholas Day generally also celebrate Christmas Day (December 25) as a separate holiday. Some of the traditions and rituals of Christmas, such as leaving out a shoe or stocking to be filled, are similar to the traditions of Saint Nicholas Day.

The mosque is located in the city of Djenn√©, Mali, on the flood plain of the Bani River. The first mosque on the site was built around the 13th century, but the current structure dates from 1907. As well as being the centre of the community of Djenn√©, it is one of the most famous landmarks in Africa. Along with the \\"Old Towns of Djenn√©\\" it was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.  History  The first mosque The ruins of the original mosque with only a section of the original wall remaining, as seen in a French postcard of 1900 The actual date of construction of the first mosque in Djenn√© is unknown, but dates as early as 1200 and as late as 1330 have been suggested. The earliest document mentioning the mosque is Abd al-Sadi's Tarikh al-Sudan which gives the early history, presumably from the oral tradition as it existed in the mid-seventeenth century. The Tarikh states that a Sultan Kunburu became a Muslim and had his palace pulled down and the site turned into a mosque. He built another palace for himself near the mosque on the east side.\\"When the sultan became a Muslim. he had his palace pulled down and the site turned into a mosque dedicated to God Most High. This is the present congregational mosque. He built another palace for himself and his household near the mosque on the east side.\\" His immediate successor built the towers of the mosque while the following Sultan built the surrounding wall.\\"When Sultan Kunburu died ‚Äì may God Most High have mercy on him ‚Äì he was succeeded by the sultan who built the towers (abraj) of the congregational mosque. He in turn was succeeded by the sultan who built the wall which surrounds that mosque.\\" There is no other written information on the Great Mosque until the French explorer Ren√© Cailli√© visited Djenn√© in 1828 years after it had been allowed to fall into ruin, and wrote \\"In Jenn√© is a mosque built of earth, surmounted by two massive but not high towers; it is rudely constructed, though very large. It is abandoned to thousands of swallows, which build their nests in it. This occasions a very disagreeable smell, to avoid which, the custom of saying prayers in a small outer court has become common.\\" Seku Amadu's mosque Seku Amadu's mosque from the southwest as it looked in 1895. From F√©lix Dubois' Tombouctou la Myst√©rieuse. Ten years before Ren√© Cailli√©'s visit, the Fulani leader Seku Amadu had launched his jihad and conquered the town. Seku Amadu appears to have disapproved of the existing mosque and allowed it to fall into disrepair. This would have been the building that Cailli√© saw. Seku Amadu had also closed all the small neighbourhood mosques. Between 1834 and 1836, Seku Amadu built a new mosque to the east of the existing mosque on the site of the former palace. The new mosque was a large, low building lacking any towers or ornamentation.Engraving from photo in French forces led by Louis Archinard captured Djenn√© in April 1893. Soon after, the French journalist F√©lix Dubois visited the town and described the ruins of the original mosque. At the time of his visit, the interior of the ruined mosque was being used as a cemetery. In his 1897 book, Tombouctou la Myst√©rieuse (Timbuktu the mysterious), Dubois provides a plan and a drawing as to how he imagined the mosque looked before being abandoned. Present mosque In 1906, the French administration in the town arranged for the original mosque to be rebuilt and at the same time for a school to be constructed on the site of Seku Amadu's mosque. The rebuilding was completed in 1907 using forced labour under the direction of Ismaila Traor√©, head of Djenn√©'s guild of masons. From photographs taken at the time, it appears the position of at least some of the outer walls follows those of the original mosque but it is unclear as to whether the columns supporting the roof kept to the previous arrangement. What was almost certainly novel in the rebuilt mosque was the symmetric arrangement of three large towers in the qibla wall. There has been debate as to what extent the design of the rebuilt mosque was subject to French influence. The current mosque, photographed in 2003, behind the town's market Dubois revisited Djenn√© in 1910 and was shocked by the new building. He believed that the French colonial administration were responsible for the design and wrote that it looked like a cross between a hedgehog and a church organ. He thought that the cones made the building resemble a baroque temple dedicated to the god of suppositories.; Dubois's French text is quoted in By contrast, Jean-Louis Bourgeois has argued that the French had little influence except perhaps for the internal arches and that the design is \\"basically African.\\" French ethnologist Michel Leiris, in his account of travelling through Mali in 1931, states that the new mosque is indeed the work of Europeans. He also says that local people were so unhappy with the new building that they refused to clean it, only doing so when threatened with prison. The terrace in front of the eastern wall includes two tombs. The larger tomb to the south contains the remains of Almany Isma√Øla, an important imam of the 18th century. Early in the French colonial period, a pond located on the eastern side of the mosque was filled with earth to create the open area that is now used for the weekly market. Electrical wiring and indoor plumbing have been added to many mosques in Mali. In some cases, the original surfaces of a mosque have even been tiled over, destroying its historical appearance and in some cases compromising the building's structural integrity. While the Great Mosque has been equipped with a loudspeaker system, the citizens of Djenn√© have resisted modernization in favor of the building's historical integrity. Many historical preservationists have praised the community's preservation effort, and interest in this aspect of the building grew in the 1990s. In 1996, Vogue magazine held a fashion shoot inside the mosque. Vogue's pictures of scantily-dressed women outraged local opinion, and as a result, non-Muslims have been banned from entering the mosque ever since. The Mosque is seen in the 2005 film Sahara.  Design  View of the Great Mosque from the northeast as it looked in 1910. From F√©lix Dubois' Notre beau Niger. The walls of the Great Mosque are made of sun-baked earth bricks (called ferey), and sand and earth based mortar, and are coated with a plaster which gives the building its smooth, sculpted look. The walls of the building are decorated with bundles of rodier palm (Borassus aethiopum) sticks, called toron, that project about from the surface. The toron also serve as readymade scaffolding for the annual repairs. Ceramic half-pipes also extend from the roofline and direct rain water from the roof away from the walls.. A short illustrated article in English by the same author is: . The mosque is built on a platform measuring about that is raised by above the level of the marketplace. The platform prevents damage to the mosque when the Bani River floods. It is accessed by six sets of stairs, each decorated with pinnacles. The main entrance is on the northern side of the building. The outer walls of the Great Mosque are not precisely orthogonal to one another so that the plan of the building has a noticeable trapezoidal outline.; Figure 7.2 is a plan of the mosque. The prayer wall or qibla of the Great Mosque faces east towards Mecca and overlooks the city marketplace. The qibla is dominated by three large, box-like towers or minarets jutting out from the main wall. The central tower is around 16 meters in height. The cone shaped spires or pinnacles at the top of each minaret are topped with ostrich eggs. The eastern wall is about a meter (3 ft) in thickness and is strengthened on the exterior by eighteen pilaster like buttresses, each of which is topped by a pinnacle. The corners are formed by rectangular shaped buttresses decorated with toron and topped by pinnacles. The prayer hall, measuring about , occupies the eastern half of the mosque behind the qibla wall. The mud- covered, rodier-palm roof is supported by nine interior walls running north‚Äìsouth which are pierced by pointed arches that reach up almost to the roof.. A photograph by Amir-Massoud Anoushfar showing the arches in the prayer hall is available on the ArchNet site This design creates a forest of ninety massive rectangular pillars that span the interior prayer hall and severely reduce the field of view. The small, irregularly-positioned windows on the north and south walls allow little natural light to reach the interior of the hall. The floor is composed of sandy earth. rodier palm sticks embedded in the walls of the Great Mosque are used for decoration and serve as scaffolding for annual repairs. In the prayer hall, each of the three towers in the qibla wall has a niche or mihrab. The imam conducts the prayers from the mihrab in the larger central tower. A narrow opening in the ceiling of the central mihrab connects with a small room situated above roof level in the tower. In earlier times, a crier would repeat the words of the imam to people in the town. To the right of the mihrab in the central tower is a second niche, the pulpit or minbar, from which the imam preaches his Friday sermon. The towers in the qibla wall do not contain stairs linking the prayer hall with the roof. Instead there are two square towers housing stairs leading to the roof. One set of stairs is located at the south western corner of the prayer hall while the other set, situated near the main entrance on the northern side, is only accessible from the exterior of the mosque. Small vents in the roof are topped with removable inverted kiln-fired bowls, which when removed allow hot air to rise out of the building and so ventilate the interior. The interior courtyard to the west of the prayer hall, measuring , is surrounded on three sides by galleries. The walls of the galleries facing the courtyard are punctuated by arched openings. The western gallery is reserved for use by women. Though it benefits from regular maintenance, since the facade's construction in 1907 only small changes have been made to the design. Rather than a single central niche, the mirhab tower originally had a pair of large recesses echoing the form of the entrance arches in the north wall. The mosque also had many fewer toron with none on the corner buttresses., includes a picture of the new mosque as it looked in 1910; , reproduces Dubois's picture; , includes a photograph taken before 1914. reproduces the 1911 Dubois picture and is available online. It is evident from published photographs that two additional rows of toron were added to the walls in the early 1990s.  Cultural significance  The main entrance is in the north wall The entire community of Djenn√© takes an active role in the mosque's maintenance via a unique annual festival. This includes music and food, but has the primary objective of repairing the damage inflicted on the mosque in the past year (mostly erosion caused by the annual rains and cracks caused by changes in temperature and humidity). In the days leading up to the festival, the plaster is prepared in pits. It requires several days to cure but needs to be periodically stirred, a task usually falling to young boys who play in the mixture, thus stirring up the contents. Men climb onto the mosque's built-in scaffolding and ladders made of palm wood and smear the plaster over the face of the mosque. Another group of men carries the plaster from the pits to the workmen on the mosque. A race is held at the beginning of the festival to see who will be the first to deliver the plaster to the mosque. Women and girls carry water to the pits before the festival and to the workmen on the mosque during it. Members of Djenn√©'s masons guild direct the work, while elderly members of the community, who have already participated in the festival many times, sit in a place of honor in the market square watching the proceedings. In 1930, an inexact replica of the Djenn√© Mosque was built in the town of Fr√©jus in southern France. The imitation, the ', was built in cement and painted in red ochre to resemble the colour of the original. It was intended to serve as a mosque for the Tirailleurs s√©n√©galais, the West African colonial troops in the French Army who were posted to the region during the winter. 1930 replica of the mosque in the French commune of Fr√©jus The original mosque presided over one of the most important Islamic learning centers in Africa during the Middle Ages, with thousands of students coming to study the Quran in Djenn√©'s madrassas. The historic areas of Djenn√©, including the Great Mosque, were designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988. While there are many mosques that are older than its current incarnation, the Great Mosque remains the most prominent symbol of both the city of Djenn√© and the nation of Mali. On 20 January 2006 the sight of a team of men hacking at the roof of the mosque sparked a riot in the town. The team were inspecting the roof as part of a restoration project financed by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture. The men quickly disappeared to avoid being lynched. In the mosque the mob ripped out the ventilation fans that had been presented by the US Embassy at the time of the Iraq War and then went on a rampage through the town. The crowd ransacked the Cultural Mission, the mayor's home, destroyed the car belonging to the imam's younger brother and damaged three cars belonging to the Imam himself. The local police were overwhelmed and had to call in reinforcements from Mopti. One man died during the disturbances. On Thursday 5 November 2009, the upper section of the southern large tower of the qibla wall collapsed after 75 mm (3 in.) of rain had fallen in a 24-hour period.; The Aga Khan Trust for Culture funded the rebuilding of the tower. The mosque features on the coat of arms of Mali.  3D documentation with laser-scanning  The 3D documentation of the Djenn√© Mosque was carried out in 2005 using terrestrial laser-scanning. This formed part of the Zamani Project that aims to document cultural heritage sites in 3D to create a record for future generations.

Early life Ding Ling and husband Hu Yepin in 1926 Ding Ling was born into a gentry family in Linli, Hunan province. Her father died when Ding was three. Ding Ling's mother, who raised her children alone while becoming an educator, was Ding's role model, and she would later write an unfinished novel, titled Mother, which described her mother's experiences. Following her mother's example, Ding Ling became an activist at an early age. Ding Ling fled to Shanghai in 1920 in repudiation of traditional Chinese family practices by refusing to marry her cousin who had been chosen to become her husband. She rejected the commonly accepted view that parents as the source of the child's body are its owners, and she ardently asserted that she owned and controlled her own body. Ding Ling was influenced by progressive teachers at the People's Girls School, and by her association with modern writers such as Shen Congwen and the left-wing poet Hu Yepin, whom she married in 1925. She began writing stories around this time, most famously Miss Sophia's Diary, published in 1927, in which a young woman describes her unhappiness with her life and confused romantic and sexual feelings. In 1931, Hu Yepin was executed in Shanghai by the Kuomintang government for his association with the Communists. In March 1932 she joined the Chinese Communist Party, and almost all of her fiction after this time was in support of its goals. She was active in the League of Left-Wing Writers. Political persecution Ding Ling, 1930s Active in the Communist revolutionary cause, she was placed under house arrest in Shanghai by the Kuomintang for a three- year period from 1933 to 1936. She escaped, and made her way to the Communist base of Yan'an. There she became one of the most influential figures in Yan'an cultural circles, serving as director of the Chinese Literature and Arts Association and editing a newspaper literary supplement. Ding Ling struggled with the idea that revolutionary needs, defined by the party, should come before art. She objected to the gender standards at work in Yan'an. In 1942 she wrote an article in a party newspaper, titled Thoughts on March 8, questioning the party's commitment to change popular attitudes towards women. She satirized male double standards concerning women, saying they were ridiculed if they focused on household duties, but also became the target of gossip and rumors if they remained unmarried and worked in the public sphere. She also criticized male cadres use of divorce provisions to rid themselves of unwanted wives. Her article was condemned by Mao Zedong and the party leadership, and she was forced to retract her views and undergo a public self- confession. Her main work in these years was the novel The Sun Shines Over Sanggan River, which she completed in 1948. It followed the complex results of land reform on a rural village. It was awarded the Stalin prize for Literature in 1951, and is considered one of the best examples of socialist-realist fiction. It did not, however, address gender issues. Always a political activist, in 1957 she was denounced as a \\"rightist\\", purged from the party, and her fiction and essays were banned. She spent five years in jail during the Cultural Revolution and was sentenced to do manual labor on a farm for twelve years before being \\"rehabilitated\\" in 1978. In her introduction to Miss Sophie's Diary And Other Stories, Ding Ling explains her indebtedness to the writers of other cultures: > I can say that if I have not been influenced by Western literature I would > probably not have been able to write fiction, or at any rate not the kind of > fiction in this collection. It is obvious that my earliest stories followed > the path of Western realism... A little later, as the Chinese revolution > developed, my fiction changed with the needs of the age and of the Chinese > people... Literature ought to join minds together... turning ignorance into > mutual understanding. Time, place and institutions cannot separate it from > the friends it wins... And in 1957, a time of spiritual suffering for me, I > found consolation in reading much Latin American and African literature. Later years A few years before her death, she was allowed to travel to the United States where she was a guest at the University of Iowa's International Writing Program. Ding Ling and her husband Chen Ming visited Canada in 1981 for 10 days, meeting with Canadian writers Margaret Laurence, Adele Weisman, and Geoff Hancock; and even Canada's first female Lieutenant Governor, Pearl McGonigal for the province of Manitoba. Ding Ling died in Beijing on March 4, 1986. She authored more than three hundred works. After her \\"rehabilitation\\" many of her previously banned books such as her novel The Sun Shines Over The Sanggan River were republished and translated into numerous languages. Some of her short works, spanning a fifty-year period, are collected in I Myself Am A Woman: Selected Writings Of Ding Ling.

The traditional form of puppet theatre art can be found in Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia, wherein a dramatic story is told through shadows thrown by puppets and sometimes combined with human characters. The art form celebrates Indonesian culture and artistic talent; its origins are traced to the spread of Hinduism in the medieval era and the arrival of leather-based puppet arts called thalubomalata from southern India. Wayang refers to the entire dramatic show. Sometimes the leather puppet itself is referred to as wayang. Performances of shadow puppet theatre are accompanied by a gamelan orchestra in Java, and by gender wayang in Bali. The dramatic stories depict mythologies, such as episodes from the Hindu epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, as well as local adaptations of cultural legends. Traditionally, a wayang is played out in a ritualized midnight-to-dawn show by a dalang, an artist and spiritual leader; people watch the show from both sides of the screen. UNESCO designated wayang kulit, a shadow puppet theatre and the best known of the Indonesian wayang, as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity on 7 November 2003. In return for the acknowledgment, UNESCO required Indonesians to preserve the tradition. Wayang has also been a significant historical art form in Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos.  Etymology  The term wayang is the Javanese word for \\"shadow\\"Mair, Victor H. Painting and Performance: Picture Recitation and Its Indian Genesis. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988. p. 58. or \\"imagination\\". The word's equivalent in Indonesian is bayang. In modern daily Javanese and Indonesian vocabulary, wayang can refer to the puppet itself or the whole puppet theatre performance.  History  Wayang shadow-puppet (Bali, early 20th century) Wayang is the traditional shadow puppet theatre in Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. There is no evidence that wayang existed in ancient Indonesia. The earliest evidence is from the late 1st millennium CE, in medieval-era texts and archeological sites. The origins of wayang are unclear, and three competing theories have been proposed: *Indian origin: this is the generally favored theory, since Hinduism and Buddhism arrived on the Indonesian islands in the early centuries of the 1st millennium, and along with theology, the peoples of Indonesia and Indian subcontinent exchanged culture, architecture and traded goods. Puppet arts and dramatic plays have been documented in ancient Indian texts, dated to the last centuries of the 1st millennium BCE and the early centuries of the common era. Further, the coastal region of Southern India (Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) which most interacted with Indonesian islands has had an intricate, leather-based puppet art called tholu bommalata, which shares many elements with wayang. Some characters such as the Vidusaka in Sanskrit drama and Semar in wayang are very similar. Indian mythologies and characters from the Hindu epics feature in many of the major plays performed, all of which suggest possible Indian origins, or at least an influence in the pre-Islamic period of Indonesian history. Jivan Pani states that wayang developed from two arts of Odisha in Eastern India, the Ravana Chhaya puppet theatre and the Chhau dance. *Indigenous origin: the word wayang is not found in Indian languages, but is Javanese. Similarly, some of the other technical terms used in the wayang kulit found in Java and Bali are based on local languages, even when the play overlaps with Buddhist or Hindu mythologies. This suggests, state some scholars such as Hazeu, that wayang has indigenous roots. *Chinese origin: the least popular theory, it is based on the evidence that puppet arts based on animism existed in ancient China (1000 CE) and it may have been the \\"place of origin of all Asian shadow theatre\\", according to Brandon. Regardless of its origins, states Brandon, wayang developed and matured into a Javanese phenomenon. There is no true contemporary puppet shadow artwork in either China or India that has the sophistication, depth and creativity expressed in wayang. Development A wayang show in Bali, Indonesia, presenting a play from the Ramayana The oldest known record that probably concerns wayang is from the 9th century. Around 860 CE an Old Javanese (Kawi) charter issued by Maharaja Sri Lokapala mentions three sorts of performers: atapukan, aringgit, and abanol. Ringgit is described in an 11th-century Javanese poem as a leather shadow figure. An inscription dated 930 CE says, si Galigi mawayang (\\"Sir Galigi played wayang\\"). It seems certain features of traditional puppet theatre have survived from that time. Galigi was an itinerant performer who was requested to perform for a special royal occasion. At that event he performed a story about the hero Bhima from the Mahabharata. Mpu Kanwa, the poet of Airlangga's court of Kahuripan kingdom, writes in 1035 CE in his kakawin Arjunawiwaha: \\"santo·π£√¢hƒïlƒïtan kƒïlir sira sak√™ng sang hyang JagatkƒÅra·πáa\\", which means, \\"He is steadfast and just a wayang screen away from the 'Mover of the World'.\\" Kelir is the Javanese word for the wayang screen, the verse eloquently comparing actual life to a wayang performance where the almighty JagatkƒÅra·πáa (the mover of the world) as the ultimate dalang (puppet master) is just a thin screen away from mortals. This reference to wayang as shadow plays suggested that wayang performance was already familiar in Airlangga's court and wayang tradition had been established in Java, perhaps earlier. An inscription from this period also mentions some occupations as awayang and aringgit. Wayang kulit is a unique form of theatre employing light and shadow. The puppets are crafted from buffalo hide and mounted on bamboo sticks. When held up behind a piece of white cloth, with an electric bulb or an oil lamp as the light source, shadows are cast on the screen. The plays are typically based on romantic tales and religious legends, especially adaptations of the classic Indian epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. Some of the plays are also based on local happenings or other local secular stories. A dalang performing wayang kulit in Java, circa 1890 Artist The dalang, sometimes referred to as dhalang or kawi dalang, is the puppeteer behind the performance. It is he who sits behind the screen, sings and narrates the dialogues of different characters of the story. With a traditional orchestra in the background to provide a resonant melody and its conventional rhythm, the dalang modulates his voice to create suspense, thus heightening the drama. Invariably, the play climaxes with the triumph of good over evil. The dalang is highly respected in Indonesian culture for his knowledge, art and as a spiritual person capable of bringing to life the spiritual stories in the religious epics. The figures of the wayang are also present in the paintings of that time, for example, the roof murals of the courtroom in Klungkung, Bali. They are still present in traditional Balinese painting today. The figures are painted, flat (5 to at most 15 mm ‚Äî about half an inch ‚Äî thick) woodcarvings with movable arms. The head is solidly attached to the body. Wayang klitik can be used to perform puppet plays either during the day or at night. This type of wayang is relatively rare. Wayang today is both the most ancient and the most popular form of puppet theatre in the world. Hundreds of people will stay up all night long to watch the superstar performers, dalang, who command extravagant fees and are international celebrities. Some of the most famous dalang in recent history are Ki Nartosabdho, Ki Anom Suroto, Ki Asep Sunandar Sunarya, Ki Sugino, and Ki Manteb Sudarsono. Styles  Wayang kulit  Irawan's Wedding, mid-20th century, University of Hawaii Dept. of Theater and Dance Wayang kulit are without a doubt the best known of the Indonesian wayang. Kulit means \\"skin\\", and refers to the leather construction of the puppets that are carefully chiselled with fine tools, supported with carefully shaped buffalo horn handles and control rods, and painted in beautiful hues, including gold. The stories are usually drawn from the Hindu epics the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. There is a family of characters in Javanese wayang called punokawan; they are sometimes referred to as \\"clown-servants\\" because they normally are associated with the story's hero, and provide humorous and philosophical interludes. Semar is actually the god of love, who has consented to live on earth to help humans. He has three sons: Gareng (the oldest), Petruk, and Bagong (the youngest son). These characters did not originate in the Hindu epics, but were added later.Eckersley. M. (ed.) 2009. Drama from the Rim: Asian Pacific Drama Book. Drama Victoria. Melbourne. 2009. (p. 15) They provide something akin to a political cabaret, dealing with gossip and contemporary affairs. The puppet figures themselves vary from place to place. In Central Java, the city of Surakarta (Solo) and city of Yogyakarta have the best-known wayang traditions, and the most commonly imitated style of puppets. Regional styles of shadow puppets can also be found in Temanggung, West Java, Banyumas, Cirebon, Semarang, and East Java. Bali's wayang are more compact and naturalistic figures, and Lombok has figures representing real people. Often modern-world objects as bicycles, automobiles, airplanes and ships will be added for comic effect, but for the most part the traditional puppet designs have changed little in the last 300 years. Historically, the performance consisted of shadows cast by an oil lamp onto a cotton screen. Today, the source of light used in wayang performance in Java is most often a halogen electric light, while Bali still uses the traditional firelight. Some modern forms of wayang such as wayang sandosa (from Bahasa Indonesia, since it uses the national language of Indonesian instead of Javanese) created in the Art Academy at Surakarta (STSI) employ theatrical spotlights, colored lights, contemporary music, and other innovations. Making a wayang kulit figure that is suitable for a performance involves hand work that takes several weeks, with the artists working together in groups. They start from master models (typically on paper) which are traced out onto skin or parchment, providing the figures with an outline and with indications of any holes that will need to be cut (such as for the mouth or eyes). The figures are then smoothed, usually with a glass bottle, and primed. The structure is inspected and eventually the details are worked through. A further smoothing follows before individual painting, which is undertaken by yet another craftsman. Finally, the movable parts (upper arms, lower arms with hands and the associated sticks for manipulation) mounted on the body, which has a central staff by which it is held. A crew makes up to ten figures at a time, typically completing that number over the course of a week. However, there is not strong continuing demand for the top skills of wayang craftspersons and the relatively few experts still skilled at the art sometimes find it difficult to earn a satisfactory income.Simon Sudarman, 'Sagio: Striving to preserve wayang', The Jakarta Post, 11 September 2012. The painting of less expensive puppets is handled expediently with a spray technique, using templates, and with a different person handling each color. Less expensive puppets, often sold to children during performances, are sometimes made on cardboard instead of leather.  Wayang golek  Cepot, a Sundanese Punokawan, in wayang golek form Wayang golek (Sundanese: ) are three-dimensional wooden rod puppets that are operated from below by a wooden rod that runs through the body to the head, and by sticks connected to the hands. The construction of the puppets contributes to their versatility, expressiveness and aptitude for imitating human dance. Today, wayang golek is mainly associated with the Sundanese culture of West Java. In Central Java, the wooden wayang is also known as wayang menak, which originated from Kudus, Central Java. Little is known for certain about the history of wayang golek, but scholars have speculated that it most likely originated in China and arrived in Java sometime in the 17th century. Some of the oldest traditions of wayang golek are from the north coast of Java in what is called the pasisir region. This is home to some of the oldest Muslim kingdoms in Java and it is likely that the wayang golek grew in popularity through telling the wayang menak stories of Amir Hamza, the uncle of Muhammad. These stories are still widely performed in Kabumen, Tegal, and Jepara as wayang golek menak, and in Cirebon, wayang golek cepak. Legends about the origins of the wayang golek attribute their invention to the Muslim saint Wali Sunan Kudus, who used the medium to proselytize Muslim values. In the 18th century, the tradition moved into the mountainous region of Priangan, West Java, where it eventually was used to tell stories of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata in a tradition now called wayang golek purwa, which can be found in Bandung, Bogor and Jakarta. The adoption of Javanese Mataram kejawen culture by Sundanese aristocrats was probably the remnant of Mataram influence over the Priangan region during the expansive reign of Sultan Agung. While the main characters from the Ramayana and Mahabharata are similar to wayang kulit purwa versions from Central Java, some punakawan (servants or jesters) were rendered in Sundanese names and characteristics, such as Cepot or Astrajingga as Bagong, and Dawala or Udel as Petruk. Wayang golek purwa has become the most popular form of wayang golek today.  Wayang wong  Pandava and Krishna in a wayang wong performance Wayang wong, also known as wayang orang (literally \\"human wayang\\"), is a type of Javanese theatrical performance wherein human characters imitate the movements of a puppet show. The show also integrates dance by the human characters into the dramatic performance. It typically shows episodes of the Ramayana or the Mahabharata.  Wayang gedog or Wayang topeng  Studio portrait of wayang topeng actors Wayang gedog theatrical performances take themes from the Panji cycle of stories from the kingdom of Janggala. The players wear masks known as wayang topeng or wayang gedog. The word gedog comes from kedok which, like topeng, means \\"mask\\". Wayang gedog centers on a love story about Princess Candra Kirana of Kediri and Raden Panji Asmarabangun, the legendary crown prince of Janggala. Candra Kirana was the incarnation of Dewi Ratih (the Hindu goddess of love) and Panji was an incarnation of Kamajaya (the Hindu god of love). Kirana's story has been given the title Smaradahana (\\"The fire of love\\"). At the end of the complicated story they finally marry and bring forth a son named Raja Putra. Originally, wayang wong was performed only as an aristocratic entertainment in the palaces of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. In the course of time, it spread to become a popular and folk form as well.  Wayang karucil or wayang klitik  Wayang klitik image of Batara Guru Wayang klitik figures occupy a middle ground between the figures of wayang golek and wayang kulit. They are constructed similarly to wayang kulit figures, but from thin pieces of wood instead of leather, and, like wayang kulit figures, are used as shadow puppets. A further similarity is that they are the same smaller size as wayang kulit figures. However, wood is more subject to breakage than leather. During battle scenes, wayang klitik figures often sustain considerable damage, much to the amusement of the public, but in a country in which before 1970 there were no adequate glues available, breakage generally meant an expensive, newly made figure. On this basis the wayang klitik figures, which are to appear in plays where they have to endure battle scenes, have leather arms. The name of these figures is onomotopaeic, from the sound klitik-klitik that these figures make when worked by the dalang. Wayang klitik figures come originally from eastern Java, where one still finds workshops turning them out. They are less costly to produce than wayang kulit figures. The origin of the stories involved in these puppet plays comes from the kingdoms of eastern Java: Jenggala, Kediri and Majapahit. From Jenggala and Kediri come the stories of Raden Panji and Cindelaras, which tells of the adventures of a pair of village youngsters with their fighting cocks. The Damarwulan presents the stories of a hero from Majapahit. Damarwulan is a clever chap, who with courage, aptitude, intelligence and the assistance of his young lover Anjasmara makes a surprise attack on the neighboring kingdom and brings down Minakjinggo, an Adipati (viceroy) of Blambangan and mighty enemy of Majapahit's beautiful queen Sri Ratu Kencanawungu. As a reward, Damarwulan is married to Kencanawungu and becomes king of Majapahit; he also takes Lady Anjasmara as a second wife. This story is full of love affairs and battles and is very popular with the public. The dalang is liable to incorporate the latest local gossip and quarrels and work them into the play as comedy.  Wayang beber  Wayang beber depiction of a battle Wayang glass painting depiction of Bharatayudha battle Wayang beber relies on scroll-painted presentations of the stories being told.Ganug Nugroho Adil, \\"Joko Sri Yono: Preserving 'wayang beber'\\", The Jakarta Post, 27 March 2012. Wayang beber has strong similarities to narratives in the form of illustrated ballads that were common at annual fairs in medieval and early modern Europe. They have also been subject to the same fate‚Äîthey have nearly vanished, although there are still some groups of artists who support wayang beber in places such as Surakarta (Solo) in Central Java.Ganug Nugroho Adil, 'The metamorphosis of \\"Wayang Beber\\"', The Jakarta Post, 19 April 2013. Chinese visitors to Java during the 15th century described a storyteller who unrolled scrolls and told stories that made the audience laugh or cry. A few scrolls of images remain from those times, found today in museums. There are two sets, hand-painted on hand-made bark cloth, that are still owned by families who have inherited them from many generations ago, in Pacitan and Wonogiri, both villages in Central Java. Performances, mostly in small open- sided pavilions or auditoriums, take place according to the following pattern: The dalang gives a sign, the small gamelan orchestra with drummer and a few knobbed gongs and a musician with a rebab (a violin-like instrument held vertically) begins to play, and the dalang unrolls the first scroll of the story. Then, speaking and singing, he narrates the episode in more detail. In this manner, in the course of the evening he unrolls several scrolls one at a time. Each scene in the scrolls represents a story or part of a story. The content of the story typically stems from the Panji romances which are semi- historical legends set in the 12th‚Äì13th century East Javanese kingdoms of Jenggala, Daha and Kediri, and also in Bali.Ganug Nugroho Adil, \\"Sinhanto: A wayang master craftsman\\", The Jakarta Post, 22 June 2012.  Wayang and new themes  The historically popular wayang kulit typically is based on the Hindu epics the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. In the 1960s, the Christian missionary effort adopted the art form to create wayang wahyu. The Javanese Jesuit Brother Timotheus L. Wignyosubroto used the show to communicate to the Javanese and other Indonesians the teachings of the Bible and of the Catholic Church in a manner accessible to the audience. Similarly, wayang sadat has deployed wayang for the religious teachings of Islam, while wayang pancasila has used it as a medium for national politics. Characters Java, Indonesia, presenting a puppet figure of wayang Wayang characters are derived from several group of stories and settings. The most popular and the most ancient is wayang purwa, whose story and characters were derived from the Indian Hindu epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata, set in the ancient kingdoms of Hastinapura, Ayodhya and Alengkapura (Lanka). Another group of characters are derived from the Panji cycle, natively developed in Java during the Kediri Kingdom; these stories are set in the twin Javanese kingdoms of Janggala and Panjalu (Kediri). Wayang purwa Wayang purwa (Javanese for \\"ancient\\" or \\"original\\" wayang) refer to wayang that are based on the stories of Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. They are usually performed as wayang kulit, wayang golek, and wayang wong dance dramas.Inna Solomonik. \\"Wayang Purwa Puppets: The Language of the Silhouette\\", Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, 136 (1980), no: 4, Leiden, pp. 482‚Äì497.

Menak stories have been performed in the islands of Java and Lombok in the Indonesian archipelago for several hundred years. They are predominantly performed in Java as golek, or wooden rod-puppets, but also can be found on Lombok as the shadow puppet tradition, Wayang Sasak.Petersen, Robert S. \\"The Island in the Middle: The Domains of Wayang Golek Menak, The Rod Puppetry of Central Java. In Theatre Survey 34.2. The wayang golek menak tradition most likely originated along the north coast of Java under Chinese Muslim influences and spread East and South and is now most commonly found in the South coastal region of Kabumen and Yogyakarta.Sindhu Jotaryono.

Jakarta, Lontar Foundation, 1999. The word menak is a Javanese honorific title that is given to people who are recognized at court for their exemplary character even though they are not nobly born. Jayengrana is just such a character who inspires allegiance and devotion through his selfless modesty and his devotion to a monotheistic faith called the \\"Religion of Abraham.\\" Jayengrana and his numerous followers do battle with the pagan faiths that threaten their peaceable realm of Koparman. The chief instigator of trouble is Pati Bestak, counselor to the King Nuresewan, who goads pagan kings to capture Jayengrana's wife Dewi Munninggar. The pagan Kings eventually fail to capture her and either submit to Jayengrana and renounce their pagan faith or die swiftly in combat. The literary figure of Amir Hamzah is loosely based on the historic person of Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib who was the paternal uncle of Muhammad. Hamzah was a fierce warrior who fought alongside Muhammad and died in the battle of Uhud in 624 CE. the literary tradition traveled from Persia to India and from then on to Southeast Asia where the court poet Yasadipura I (1729-1802) set down the epic in the Javanese language in the Serat Menak.Pigeaud, Th. G. \\"The Romance of Amir Hamzah in Java.\\" In Binkisan Budi: Een Bundel Opstellen Voor P. S. Van Ronkel: A. W. Sijthoff's Uitgeversmaatschappij N.V., Leiden, 1950.

Japan occupied the territory in February 1943. The French never regained it after World War II; the Republic of China occupied the territory following the surrender of Japan and France formally retroceded it with the Chungking Convention of 18 August 1945. The territory did not experience the rapid growth in population that other parts of coastal China experienced, rising from 189,000 in the early 20th century to just 209,000 in 1935.Priestly 1967: 441 Industries included shipping and coal mining.  Geography  The leased territory was situated in Guangdong Province (Kwangtung Province) on the east side of the Leizhou Peninsula (), north of Hainan, around a bay then called Kwangchowan, now called the Port of Zhanjiang. The bay forms the estuary of the Maxie River (Chinese: , ). The Maxie is navigable as far as inland even by large warships. The territory ceded to France included the islands lying in the bay, which enclosed an area 29 km long by 10 km wide and a minimum water depth of 10 metres. The islands were recognized at the time as an admirable natural defense, the main islands being Donghai Dao. On the smaller Naozhou Island farther to the southeast, a lighthouse was constructed. The limits of the concession inland were fixed in November 1899; on the left bank of the Maxie, France gained from Gaozhou prefecture (Kow Chow Fu) a strip of territory by , and on the right bank a strip by from Leizhou prefecture (Lei Chow Fu). The total land area of the leased territory was . The city of Fort-Bayard (Zhanjiang) was developed as a port.  History   Establishment of French rule and early development  Fort-Bayard circa 1910 Kwangchow Wan was leased by China to France for 99 years, or until 1997 (as the British did in Hong Kong's New Territories and the Germans in the Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory) according to the Treaty of 29 May 1898, ratified by China on 5 January 1900. The colony was described as \\"commercially unimportant but strategically located\\"; most of France's energies went into their administration of the mainland of French Indochina, and their main concern in China was the protection of Roman Catholic missionaries, rather than the promotion of trade. Kwangchow Wan, while not a constituent part of Indochina, was effectively placed under the authority of the French Resident Superior in Tonkin (itself under the Governor General of French Indochina, also in Hanoi); the French Resident was represented locally by Administrators.Olson 1991: 349 In addition to the territory acquired, France was given the right to connect the bay by railway with the city and harbour situated on the west side of the peninsula; however, when they attempted to take possession of the land to build the railway, forces of the provincial government offered armed resistance. As a result, France demanded and obtained exclusive mining rights in the three adjoining prefectures. The return of the leased territory to China was promised by France at the Washington Naval Conference of 1921‚Äì1922 but this plan was in fact never realised.Escarra 1929: 9 By 1931, the population of Kwangchow Wan had reached 206,000, giving the colony a population density of 245 persons per km2; virtually all were Chinese, and only 266 French citizens and four other Europeans were recorded as living there. Industries included shipping and coal mining. The port was also popular with smugglers; prior to the 1928 cancellation of the American ban on export of commercial airplanes, Kwangchow Wan was also used as a stop for Cantonese smugglers transporting military aircraft purchased in Manila to China,Xu 2001: 21 and US records mention at least one drug smuggler who picked up opium and Chinese emigrants to be smuggled into the United States from there.Anslinger 1953: 141  World War II  Landing of Japanese troops in Kwangchow Wan in February 1943 As an adjunct of French Indochina, Kwangchow Wan generally endured the same fate as Indochina proper during World War II. Even before the signing of the 30 August 1940 accord with Japan in which France recognized the ‚Äúprivileged status of Japanese interests in the Far East‚Äù and which constituted the first step of the Japanese military occupation of Indochina, a small detachment of Japanese marines had landed at Fort-Bayard without opposition in early July and set up a control and observation post in the harbor.Matot, p. 193. However, as in French Indochina proper, the civilian administration of the territory was to remain in the hands of official of Vichy France following the Fall of France; in November 1941, Governor General Jean Decoux, newly appointed by Marshal P√©tain, made an official visit to Kwangchow Wan.Matot, p. 194. In mid-February 1943, the Japanese, after having informed the Vichy government that they needed to strengthen the defence of Kwangchow Wan Bay, unilaterally landed more troops and occupied the airport and all other strategic locations in the Territory. From then on, Kwanchow Wan was de facto under full military Japanese occupation and the French civilian administration was gradually reduced to a mere fa√ßade. The Administrator resigned in disgust and Adrien Roques, a local pro-Vichy militant, was appointed to replace him.Matot, p. 204. In May of the same year, Roques signed a convention with the local Japanese military authorities in which the French authorities promised to cooperate fully with the Japanese. On 10 March 1945, the Japanese, following up on their sudden attack on French garrisons throughout Indochina the night before, disarmed and imprisoned the small French colonial garrison in Fort- Bayard.Matot, p. 209-210. Just prior to the Japanese surrender which ended World War II, the National Revolutionary Army, having recaptured Liuzhou, Guilin, and Taizhou, as well as Lashio and Mandalay in Burma, was planning to launch a large-scale assault on Kwangchow Wan; however, due to the end of the war, the assault never materialised.Handel 1990: 242 On 18 August 1945 in Chongqing, while the Japanese were still occupying Kwangchow Wan following the surrender, a French diplomat and Kuo Chang Wu, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China, signed the Convention between the Provisional Government of the French Republic and the National Government of China for the retrocession of the Leased Territory of Kouang-Tch√©ou-Wan. Almost immediately after the last Japanese occupation troops had left the territory in late September, representatives of the French and the Chinese governments went to Fort-Bayard to proceed to the transfer of authority; the French flag was lowered for the last time on 20 November 1945.Matot, p. 214-217. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, Kwangchow Wan was often used as a stopover on an escape route for civilians fleeing Hong Kong and trying to make their way to Free China; Patrick Yu, a prominent trial lawyer, recalled in his memoirs how a Japanese military officer helped him to escape in this way.Yu 2000: 38 However, the escape route was closed when the Japanese occupied the area in February 1943.Olson 1991: 349‚Äì350  French cultural and economic influence  A French-language school, √âcole Franco-Chinoise de Kouang-Tch√©ou-Wan, as well as a branch of the Banque de l'Indochine, were set up in Fort-Bayard.Le Papier Colonial In addition, a Roman Catholic church constructed during the colonial period is still preserved today.Li 2001 In Popular Culture: Kouang-Tcheou-Wan appears in Book II (1929‚Äì1930) of the series of novels 'In the Shadow of the Fallen' (TOCYP).

History Soon after establishment in 1948, the emerging state of Israel found itself lacking in both food and foreign currency. In just three and a half years, the Jewish population of Israel had doubled, increased by nearly 700,000 immigrants. (See also Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries). Consequently, the Israeli government instigated measures to control and oversee distribution of necessary resources to ensure equal and ample rations for all Israeli citizens. In addition to the problems with the provision of food, national austerity was also required because the state was lacking in foreign currency reserves. Export revenues covered less than a third of the cost of imports, and less than half of the consequent deficit was covered by the Jewish loan system known as Magbiyot (, lit. Collections). Most financing was obtained from foreign banks and gas companies, which, as 1951 drew to an end, refused to expand the available credit. In order to supervise austerity, the prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, ordered the establishment of the Ministry of Rationing and Supply (, Misrad HaKitzuv VeHaAspaka), headed by Dov Yosef. A Wonder Pot (right), a top-of-the-stove baking utensil invented during the austerity period to help homemakers bake cakes and casseroles without an oven. At first this rationing was set for staple foods alone‚Äîoil, sugar and margarine, for instance‚Äîbut it was later expanded to furniture and footwear. Each month, each citizen would get food coupons worth 6 Israeli pounds, and each family was allotted a given amount of foodstuffs. The diet chosen, fashioned after that used in the United Kingdom during World War II, allowed a meager 1,600 calories a day for Israeli citizens, with additional calories for children, the elderly, and pregnant women. 1956 Ministry price notification poster placed inside a local grocery store in Kfar Saba. The enforcement of austerity required the establishment of a bureaucracy of quite some proportions, which nonetheless proved ineffective in preventing the emergence of a black market in which rationed products‚Äîoften smuggled from the countryside‚Äîwere sold at higher prices. To counter this, the government established in September 1950 the Office for Fighting the Black Market (, Mate LeMilhama BaShuk HaShahor), whose goal it was to combat the forming of such a market. Yet despite the increased supervision, and the specially summoned courts, all such attempts at suppression proved ineffective. End of austerity In 1952 the reparations agreement was signed with West Germany, compensating the Jewish state for confiscation of Jewish property during the Holocaust. The resulting influx of foreign capital was a huge boost to the state's struggling economy, and led to the cancellation of most restrictions in 1953. In 1956, the list of rationed goods was narrowed to just fifteen goods, and it shrank to eleven in 1958. Shortly afterwards, it was abolished for all goods except jam, sugar and coffee. In 1959, rationing was abolished altogether. Economically, austerity proved a failure, mostly due to the enormous government deficit, covered by bank loans, creating an increase in the amount of money use. Throughout austerity unemployment remained high, and inflation grew as of 1951. Yet austerity did have its advantages ‚Äì living standards were preserved at tolerable levels, while the resources saved were made available to feed and clothe and shelter the entire population adequately, while at the same time integrating and successfully resettling over 700,000 Jewish refugees from European, Arab, and Muslim lands.

It can be contrasted with commercial fishing, which is fishing for profit, or subsistence fishing, which is fishing for survival. The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod, reel, line, hooks and any one of a wide range of baits. Other devices, commonly referred to as terminal tackle, are also used to affect or complement the presentation of the bait to the targeted fish. Some examples of terminal tackle include weights, floats, and swivels. Lures are frequently used in place of bait. Some hobbyists make handmade tackle themselves, including plastic lures and artificial flies. The practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is known as angling. Big-game fishing is conducted from boats to catch large open-water species such as tuna, sharks and marlin. Noodling and trout tickling are also recreational activities. History Sketch of Juliana Berners, author of the earliest essay on recreational fishing. The early evolution of fishing as recreation is not clear, but there is anecdotal evidence for fly fishing in Japan as early as the ninth century BCE,Herd, Andrew (2003) The Fly. Medlar Press. and in Europe Claudius Aelianus (175‚Äì235 CE) describes fly fishing in his work On the Nature of Animals.\\"A Macedonian way of catching fish... They fasten red (crimson red) wool round a hook, and fix on to the wool two feathers which grow under a cock‚Äôs wattles, and which in colour are like wax. Their rod is six feet long, and their line is the same length. Then they throw their snare, and the fish, attracted and maddened by the colour, comes straight at it...\\" McCully, CB (2000) The Language of Fly- Fishing Taylor & Francis, pp. 76_78. . For the early Japanese and Macedonians, however, fly fishing was likely to have been a means of survival, rather than recreation. It is possible that antecedents of recreational fly fishing arrived in England with the Norman conquest of 1066. Although the point in history where fishing could first be said to be recreational is not clear,Schullery, Paul Fly fishing History: Beginnings: Aelian Lives it is clear that recreational fishing had fully arrived with the publication of The Compleat Angler. The earliest English essay on recreational fishing was published in 1496, shortly after the invention of the printing press. The authorship of this was attributed to Dame Juliana Berners, the prioress of the Benedictine Sopwell Nunnery. The essay was titled Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle,Berners, Dame Juliana (1496) A treatyse of fysshynge wyth an Angle (transcription by Risa S. Bear). and was published in the second Boke of Saint Albans, a treatise on hawking, hunting, and heraldry. These were major interests of the nobility, and the publisher, Wynkyn de Worde, was concerned that the book should be kept from those who were not gentlemen, since their immoderation in angling might \\"utterly destroy it\\".Cowx, I G (2002) Handbook of Fish Biology and Fisheries, Chapter 17: Recreational fishing. Blackwell Publishing. During the 16th century the work was much read, and was reprinted many times. Treatyse includes detailed information on fishing waters, the construction of rods and lines, and the use of natural baits and artificial flies. It also includes modern concerns about conservation and angler etiquette.Berners, Dame Juliana. (2008). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved June 20, 2008, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online The earliest English poetical treatise on Angling by John Dennys, said to have been a fishing companion of Shakespeare, was published in 1613, The Secrets of Angling. Footnotes of the work, written by Dennys' editor, William Lawson, make the first mention of the phrase to 'cast a fly': \\"The trout gives the most gentlemanly and readiest sport of all, if you fish with an artificial fly, a line twice your rod's length of three hairs' thickness... and if you have learnt the cast of the fly.\\" In a US context, The Outdoor Industry Association, states that fishing participation has continued its 11-year upward trajectory, adding 300,000 participants and reaching its highest number of participants since 2007. At the same time,the participation rate dipped slightly by 0.1%, bringing the fishing rate to 16.4%. This was due to the increasing population of the United States. The \\"Leaky Bucket\\" illustrates the annual churn of fishing participants, or those people joining/ rejoining the activity and those quitting in a given year. From 2017 to 2018, there was significant churn in fishing participation. While 9.1 million people stopped fishing, 9.4 million started. All of this change led to a fairly high churn rate of 18.5%, but also resulted in a net gain of 300,000 fishing participants. In 2018 participants spent a collective 883 million days fishing, averaging 17.9 annual fishing days per person. These average outing were done by an average of 2.1% over the past 3 years. Development Izaak Walton's Compleat Angler, published in 1653 helped popularize fly fishing as a sport. Woodcut by Louis Rhead Recreational fishing took a great leap forward after the English Civil War, where a newly found interest in the activity left its mark on the many books and treatises that were written on the subject at the time. The renowned officer in the Parliamentary army, Robert Venables, published in 1662 The Experienced Angler, or Angling improved, being a general discourse of angling, imparting many of the aptest ways and choicest experiments for the taking of most sorts of fish in pond or river. Another Civil War veteran to enthusiastically take up fishing, was Richard Franck. He was the first to describe salmon fishing in Scotland, and both in that and trout-fishing with artificial fly he was a practical angler. He was the first angler to name the burbot, and commended the salmon of the River Thames. Compleat Angler was written by Izaak Walton in 1653 (although Walton continued to add to it for a quarter of a century) and described the fishing in the Derbyshire Wye. It was a celebration of the art and spirit of fishing in prose and verse; 6 verses were quoted from John Dennys's earlier work. A second part to the book was added by Walton's friend Charles Cotton. More than 300 editions of The Compleat Angler have been published. The pastoral discourse was enriched with country fishing folklore, songs and poems, recipes and anecdotes, moral meditations, and quotes from classic literature. The central character, Piscator, champions the art of angling, but with an air of tranquility also relishes the pleasures of friendship, verse and song, and good food and drink.Walton, Izaak. (2008). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved June 20, 2008, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online Royal Warrant from the 1760s. Cotton's additions completed the instruction in fly fishing and advised on the making of artificial flies where he listed sixty five varieties. Charles Kirby designed an improved fishing hook in 1655 that remains relatively unchanged to this day. He went on to invent the Kirby bend, a distinctive hook with an offset point, still commonly used today. During the 18th century, the fishing industry became commercialized - rods and tackle were sold at the haberdashers store. After the Great Fire of London in 1666, artisans moved to Redditch which became a centre of production of fishing related products from the 1730s. Onesimus Ustonson established his trading shop in 1761, and his establishment remained as a market leader for the next century. He received a Royal Warrant from three successive monarchs starting with King George IV. Some have credited Onesimus with the invention of the multiplying winch, although he was certainly the first to advertise its sale. Early multiplying reels were wide and had a small diameter, and their gears, made of brass, often wore down after extensive use. His earliest advertisement in the form of a trading card date from 1768 and was entitled To all lovers of angling. A full list of the tackles he sold included artificial flies, and 'the best sort of multiplying brass winches both stop and plain'. The commercialization of the industry came at a time of expanded interest in fishing as a recreational hobby for members of the aristocracy. Expansion British fly-fishing continued to develop in the 19th century, with the emergence of fly fishing clubs, along with the appearance of several books on the subject of fly tying and fly fishing techniques. Alfred Ronalds took up the sport of fly fishing, learning the craft on the rivers Trent, Blythe and Dove. On the River Blythe, near what is today Creswell Green, Ronalds constructed a bankside fishing hut designed primarily as an observatory of trout behaviour in the river. From this hut, and elsewhere on his home rivers, Ronalds conducted experiments and formulated the ideas that eventually were published in The Fly-fisher's Entomology in 1836. The Fly- fisher's Entomology by Alfred Ronalds had a great influence on the development of fly fishing when it was first published in 1836. He combined his knowledge of fly fishing with his skill as an engraver and printer, to lavish his work with 20 colour plates. It was the first comprehensive work related to the entomology associated with fly fishing and most fly-fishing historians credit Ronalds with setting a literature standard in 1836 that is still followed today. Describing methods, techniques and, most importantly, artificial flies, in a meaningful way for the angler and illustrating them in colour is a method of presentation that can be seen in most fly-fishing literature today. By the mid to late 19th century, expanding leisure opportunities for the middle and lower classes began to have its effect on fly fishing, which steadily grew in mass appeal. The expansion of the railway network in Britain allowed the less affluent for the first time to take weekend trips to the seaside or to rivers for fishing. Richer hobbyists ventured further abroad. The large rivers of Norway replete with large stocks of salmon began to attract fishers from England in large numbers in the middle of the century - Jones's guide to Norway, and salmon-fisher's pocket companion, published in 1848, was written by Frederic Tolfrey and was a popular guide to the country. In southern England, dry-fly fishing acquired an elitist reputation as the only acceptable method of fishing the slower, clearer rivers of the south such as the River Test and the other chalk streams concentrated in Hampshire, Surrey, Dorset and Berkshire (see Southern England Chalk Formation for the geological specifics). The weeds found in these rivers tend to grow very close to the surface, and it was felt necessary to develop new techniques that would keep the fly and the line on the surface of the stream. These became the foundation of all later dry-fly developments. However, there was nothing to prevent the successful employment of wet flies on these chalk streams, as G. E. M. Skues proved with his nymph and wet fly techniques. To the horror of dry-fly purists, Skues later wrote two books, Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream, and The Way of a Trout with a Fly, which greatly influenced the development of wet fly fishing. In northern England and Scotland, many anglers also favored wet-fly fishing, where the technique was more popular and widely practiced than in southern England. One of Scotland's leading proponents of the wet fly in the early-to- mid 19th century was W.C. Stewart, who published \\"The Practical Angler\\" in 1857. From The Speckled Brook Trout by Louis Rhead (1902) In the United States, attitudes toward methods of fly fishing were not nearly as rigidly defined, and both dry- and wet-fly fishing were soon adapted to the conditions of the country. Fly anglers there, are thought to be the first anglers to have used artificial lures for bass fishing. After pressing into service the fly patterns and tackle designed for trout and salmon to catch largemouth and smallmouth bass, they began to adapt these patterns into specific bass flies. Fly anglers seeking bass developed the spinner/fly lure and bass popper fly, which are still used today.Waterman, Charles F., Black Bass and the Fly Rod, Stackpole Books (1993) In the late 19th century, American anglers, such as Theodore Gordon, in the Catskill Mountains of New York began using fly tackle to fish the region's brook trout-rich streams such as the Beaverkill and Willowemoc Creek. Many of these early American fly anglers also developed new fly patterns and wrote extensively about their sport, increasing the popularity of fly fishing in the region and in the United States as a whole. Albert Bigelow Paine, a New England author, wrote about fly fishing in The Tent Dwellers, a book about a three-week trip he and a friend took to central Nova Scotia in 1908. Participation in fly fishing peaked in the early 1920s in the eastern states of Maine and Vermont and in the Midwest in the spring creeks of Wisconsin. Along with deep sea fishing, Ernest Hemingway did much to popularize fly fishing through his works of fiction, including The Sun Also Rises. Big-game fishing started as a sport after the invention of the motorized boat. In 1898, Dr. Charles Frederick Holder, a marine biologist and early conservationist, pioneered this sport and went on to publish many articles and books on the subject noted for their combination of accurate scientific detail with exciting narratives. One method of growing popularity is kayak fishing. Kayaks are stealthy and allow anglers to reach areas not fishable from land or by conventional boat.Null, Scott and Mcbride, Joel (2007) Kayak Fishing: The Ultimate Guide.Heliconia Press. In addition, fishing from kayaks is regarded by some as an effort to level the playing field, to a degree, with their quarry and/or to challenge their angling abilities further by bringing an additional level of complexity to their sport.  Sport fishing  Sport fishing methods vary according to the area fished, the species targeted, the personal strategies of the angler, and the resources available. It ranges from the aristocraticHorrox R and Ormrod WM (2006) A social history of England, 1200-1500 Cambridge University Press, pp 278‚Äì9. . art of fly fishing elaborated in Great Britain,A fly fishing history to the high-tech methods used to chase marlin and tuna. Sport fishing is usually done with hook, line, rod and reel rather than with nets or other aids. Among the most common offshore salt water game fish are marlin, tuna, sailfish, shark, and mackerel.Dunn, Bob (2000) Saltwater Game Fishes of the World. Australian Fishing Network. In North America, freshwater fish include trout, bass, pike, catfish, walleye and muskellunge. The smallest fish are called panfish, because they can fit whole in a normal cooking pan. Examples are perch and sunfish (Centrarchidae). In the past, sport fishers, even if they did not eat their catch, almost always killed them to bring them to shore to be weighed or for preservation as trophies. In order to protect recreational fisheriesCatch And Release Fishing sport fishermen now often catch and release, and sometimes tag and release, which involves fitting the fish with identity tags, recording vital statistics, and sending a record to a government agency. Fishing techniques Recreational fishing techniques include hand gathering, spearfishing, netting, angling and trapping. Most recreational fishers use a fishing rod with a fishing line and a hook at the end of the line. The rod may be equipped with a reel so the line can be reeled in, and some form of bait or a lure attached to the hook. Fly fishing is a special form of rod fishing in which the reel is attached to the back end of the rod, and heavy line is cast with a complex, repetitive whipping motion to deliver the ultra light artificial fly to its target. Another less common technique is bowfishing using a regular bow or a crossbow. The \\"arrow\\" is a modified bolt with barbs at the tip, connected to a fishing line so the fish can be retrieved. Some crossbows are fitted with a reel. The effective use of fishing techniques often depends on knowledge about the fish and their behaviour including migration, foraging and habitat.Keegan, William F (1986) The Optimal Foraging Analysis of Horticultural Production American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 88, No. 1., pp. 92-107.Fishing On! Media (2013) - \\"Fishing Tips and Techniques\\" Although there is certainly an element of \\"luck\\" to fishing, a recent science-based synthesis article reveals that fish capture is a complex function of three interdependent key processes: an individual fish's internal state, its encounter with the gear, and the characteristics of the encountered gear (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/faf.12219/full). Fishing tackle Fishing tackle is the equipment used by fishers. Almost any equipment or gear used for fishing can be called fishing tackle. Some examples are hooks, lines, sinkers, floats, rods, reels, baits, lures, spears, nets, gaffs, traps, waders and tackle boxes. Tackle that is attached to the end of a fishing line is called terminal tackle. This includes hooks, sinkers, floats, leaders, swivels, split rings and wire, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises to attach spinner blades to fishing lures. The line, hook, bait and other fishing tackle arranged together form a fishing rig. Fishing tackle can be contrasted with fishing techniques. Fishing tackle refers to the physical equipment that is used when fishing, whereas fishing techniques refers to the ways the tackle is used when fishing. Rules and regulations Recreational fishing has conventions, rules, licensing restrictions and laws that limit the way in which fish may be caught. The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) makes and oversees a set of voluntary guidelines. Typically, these prohibit the use of nets and the catching of fish with hooks not in the mouth. Enforceable regulations are put in place by governments to ensure sustainable practice amongst anglers. For example, in the Republic of Ireland, the Central Fisheries Board oversees the implementation of all angling regulations, which include controls on angling lures, baits and number of hooks permissible, as well as licensing requirements and other conservation-based restrictions.Fishing in Ireland Central Fisheries Board Website Regulations notwithstanding, voluntary catch and release fishing as a means of protecting and sustaining game species has become an increasingly common practice among conservation-minded recreational anglers. Policy makers have largely ignored the recreational fishing sector but there is now a framework for better engagement to ensure that recreational fisheries receive the same attention as commercial fisheries. In many places they have their rules in an \\"anglers' handbook\\". Each year the handbook is updated and new rules such as catch and release, areas to fish and limits on fish can be found. Fish logs Some recreational anglers keep a log of the fish they catch, and submit trophy-sized fish to independent record keeping bodies. In the Republic of Ireland, the Irish Specimen Fish Committee verifies and publicizes the capture of trophy fish caught with rod and line by anglers in Ireland, both in freshwater and at sea. The committee also ratifies Irish record rod caught fish. It uses a set of 'fair play' regulations to ensure fish are caught in accordance with accepted angling norms.ISFC Trophy Fish Website Irish Specimen Fish Committee Competitions Recreational fishing competitions (tournaments) are a recent innovation in which fishermen compete for prizes based on the total weight of a given species of fish caught within a predetermined time. This sport evolved from local fishing contests into large competitive circuits, especially in North America. Competitors are most often professional fishermen who are supported by commercial endorsements. Other competitions are based purely on length with mandatory catch and release. Either longest fish or total length is documented with a camera and a mandatory sticker or unique item, a practice used since it is hard to weigh a living fish accurately in a boat. Sport fishing competitions involve individuals if the fishing occurs from land, and usually teams if conducted from boats, as well as specified times and areas for catching fish. A score is awarded for each fish caught. The points awarded depend on the fish's weight and species. Occasionally a score is divided by the strength of the fishing line used, yielding more points to those who use thinner, weaker line. In tag and release competitions, a flat score is awarded per fish species caught, divided by the line strength. Usually sport fishing competitions award a prize to the boat or team with the most points earned.Sportfishing in America - American Sportfishing Association In Australia, a self-administered standard for the environmental assessment of tournament fishing has been proposed as an alternative and possible pathway to the ISO 14001 international standard.A Standard for National Environmental Assessment of Tournament Fishing, 2009, RecFish Australia. The standard assesses environmental, social, economic, and public risk factors. Tournament organizers may apply for voluntary certification.NEATFish (An environmental assessment for tournament fishing) In some US states, fishery agencies and competition organizers create their own codes of practice.Recfish Research Australia. Retrieved 26 June 2010. Industry The recreational fishing industry consists of enterprises such as the manufacture and retailing of fishing tackle, the design and building of recreational fishing boats, and the provision of fishing boats for charter and guided fishing trips. \\"Pay to fish\\" enterprises provide anglers with controlled access to stocked lakes, ponds, or canals. These provide fishing opportunities outside of the permitted seasons and quotas applied to public waters. In the United Kingdom, commercial fisheries of this sort charge access fees. In North America, establishments usually charge for the fish caught, by length or by weight, rather than for access to the site although some establishments charge both types of fees. Recreational fishing is a multibillion-dollar industry.Angling Retains its Mainstream Appeal and Broad Economic Impact-American Sportfishing Association In the United States in 2014, about 11 million recreational saltwater fishers generated $58 billion in sales impacts. By contrast, commercial fishing generated $141 billion in sales impacts.National Marine Fisheries Service (2014) ‚ÄúFisheries Economics of the United States 2012‚Äù pages 6 and 8, NOAA Technical Memorandum NMFS-F/SPO-13.

He was later appointed to the Mayag√ºez city council as a representative. His responsibilities included watching over the well being of the slaves in his district and the management of public funds. Ruiz Belvis became involved in politics and took up the cause of abolitionism in the island. When Ruiz Belvis returned to Madrid in 1865, he represented the abolitionist cause to the Cortes Generales. Although his ideas were considered dangerous by the Spanish rulers for their threat to the existing order, he helped begin the movement that would eventually lead to the liberation of the slaves in the remaining Spanish Colonies in Latin America.

Until 1899, more than 800 hired foreign experts continued to be employed by the government, and many others were employed privately. Their occupation varied, ranging from high salaried government advisors, college professors and instructor, to ordinary salaried technicians. Along the process of the opening of the country, the Tokugawa Shogunate government first hired, German diplomat Philipp Franz von Siebold as diplomatic advisor, Dutch naval engineer Hendrik Hardes for Nagasaki Arsenal and Willem Johan Cornelis ridder Huijssen van Kattendijke for Nagasaki Naval School, French naval engineer Fran√ßois L√©once Verny for Yokosuka Arsenal, and British civil engineer Richard Henry Brunton. Most of the O-yatoi was appointed through government approval with two or three years contract, and took their responsibility properly in Japan, except some cases.Hardy's Case, The Japan Weekly Mail, January 4 1875. As the Public Works hired almost 40% of the total number of the O-yatois, the main goal in hiring the O-yatois was to obtain transfers of technology and advice on systems and cultural ways. Therefore, young Japanese officers gradually took over the post of the O-yatoi after they completed training and education at the Imperial College, Tokyo, the Imperial College of Engineering or studying abroad.

Campion's screenplay is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Susanna Moore. The film focuses on an English teacher who becomes personally entangled with a detective investigating a series of gruesome murders in her Manhattan neighborhood. The film received a limited release on October 22, 2003 in the United States, and was subsequently given a wide release on Halloween that year in the United States and United Kingdom. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Plot Frannie Avery, an introverted writer and English teacher in New York City, meets one of her students, Cornelius, at a local pub to talk about their coursework. Cornelius propounds a theory that John Wayne Gacy may not have been guilty of his murderous crimes, later suggesting that 'desire' was responsible. During the meeting, she heads to the bathroom in the basement. In the darkened basement hallway, she witnesses a woman performing oral sex on a man. Stunned, she momentarily observes the scene but, due to the lack of light, is only able to discern a 3 of spades tattoo on the man's wrist. Periodically as she travels the subway, Frannie reads posters of poetic quotations in the carriages, which seem to have bearing on her own life story. Several days later, Detective Giovanni Malloy questions Frannie as he investigates the gruesome murder of a young woman, whose severed limb was found in Frannie's garden. They flirt despite the grisly nature of their introduction, and meet at the same bar later. Frannie is alternately thrilled and frightened by the detective's sexual aggressiveness, even as she grows more disillusioned with the sexist attitudes and crude behavior of other men, including the detective's partner, Richard Rodriguez. Even as Malloy defends his partner, who can no longer carry a gun because he threatened his wife after she destroyed one of his awards when she caught him \\"having sex with a fat chick,\\" he promises he will do anything Frannie wants except hit her. After questioning his 3 of spades tattoo, which he says identifies him as a member of a secret club, she sheepishly leaves the bar abruptly. On a dark street, she is assaulted by a masked stranger while walking home. The stranger takes her bag, including her wallet. During her escape, she runs into the path of a taxi, which hits her, knocks her down, and causes superficial injuries. Upon arriving at her apartment, she phones Malloy, asking him to come over. After a while, the two have passionate sex and she is taken aback by his sexual prowess. She tells him her mother's romanticised story of how she became engaged to her father after he proposed to her while ice-skating. She realises a charm is missing from her bracelet and Malloy suggests it probably fell off during the West Broadway attack. The next day, Frannie confides about the sexual encounter to her free-spirited half-sister, Pauline, who lives above a strip club. After Malloy tells Frannie that she and the first victim were in the same bar the night of the murder, and that she might have seen the murderer, she begins to suspect that Malloy may actually be the killer, especially after a second victim is found dismembered in a washing machine at a school laundry. Later, she accompanies Malloy to a woodsy spot along a river, where he scares her by shooting at garbage bags floating on the surface, then tells her she should learn how to shoot. She surprises herself by taking aim and shooting well. Meanwhile, Cornelius has been taken in for police questioning on suspicion of the murders, due to his handing in a term paper on serial killers illustrated in blood. Upon returning to her apartment, Frannie is confronted by her former boyfriend, John, with whom she has ended a relationship and who has told her he has been having panic attacks. Later, Cornelius comes to the apartment, displaying a bruised eye, which he blames on police interrogators. While there, he attempts to rape her -- an attack that is interrupted by Detective Rodriguez, who states that he was sent by Malloy to check on her. Cornelius swiftly leaves. She goes to Pauline's apartment, which she finds unlocked and in disarray. In the bathroom, which is covered in blood, she finds Pauline's severed head in a plastic bag in the sink. Traumatized, Frannie is briefly questioned by Malloy at the police station and then is driven home by a female uniformed police officer. After entering the apartment, she gets drunk. Malloy shows up later and reveals that the killer's 'signature' is leaving a ring on the finger of his victims. They begin to flirt and she handcuffs him to a pipe before making love to him. After sex, Frannie discovers that he had a key to Pauline's apartment. She searches for the handcuff keys in his jacket and finds the missing charm. He claims he found it at the scene of her assault and planned to return it to her but she is suspicious. She finally confronts Malloy about his tattoo, as well as her suspicion that he is a serial killer, responsible for the string of murders. She flees the apartment, leaving Malloy handcuffed. She has Malloy's jacket in hand and is met by Rodriguez outside. He tells her they need to talk and persuades her to get into his unmarked police car. As the two discuss what has transpired, Rodriguez drives Frannie to the Little Red Lighthouse below the George Washington Bridge, commenting that he likes to go fishing there. She tells him that the location reminds her of a book she teaches, To the Lighthouse. While the two talk, Frannie notices Rodriguez has the same 3 of spades tattoo on his wrist as Malloy. Rodriguez claims that he and Malloy got identical tattoos after their first big bust together. Realizing it is actually Rodriguez ‚Äî not Malloy ‚Äî who is the killer, Frannie fears she is to be his next victim. Rodriquez realises Frannie knows he is the killer, but holds out a ring on the end of his knife, saying 'Will you marry me?\\" Donning Malloy's jacket, which contains his gun, Frannie holds Rodriguez at gunpoint before shooting him once. He attempts to strangle her, but she manages to fire the gun again, killing him. She walks, bloodied, back to her apartment and lies down with the exhausted Malloy, who is still cuffed to the pipe where she left him. Cast Production Nicole Kidman and Jane Campion spent five years developing the film. This is Kidman's producing debut. Kidman was originally cast as Frannie, but dropped out because she was getting a divorce and needed more time with her children. This film was executive produced by Effie T. Brown, in association with Sony Screen Gems and Pathe International. Box office In the Cut grossed $1,666,830 at the box office in Australia. The total worldwide gross of In the Cut was $23,726,793. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a score of 32% based on reviews from 173 critics and an average rating of 4.86/10; the consensus reads: \\"Jane Campion takes a stab at subverting the psycho-sexual thriller genre with In the Cut, but gets tangled in her own abstraction.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 46 out of 100 based on reviews from 38 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". CinemaScore gave it a rating of \\"F\\" based on surveys from general audiences; , it is one of only 19 films to receive such a rating. Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote: \\"Beautifully crafted and highlighted by an arresting change-of-pace [performance] by Meg Ryan as an English teacher erotically awakened by a homicide detective. But the story's unpalatable narrative holes and dramatic missteps will hold sway over the pic's better qualities.\\" Noel Murray of The A.V. Club wrote: \\"Though the oppressive artiness makes the early scenes fairly ridiculous, the director's odd methods add rare tension to the climax, as it becomes evident that the finale won't be so predictable in Campion's hands.\\" In the Cut was among the films discussed favorably by Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek in The Pervert's Guide to Cinema (2006). Film critic David Thomson has also called it a masterpiece, and, in his book Moments That Made the Movies, hails it as \\"one of the great films of the twenty-first century.\\" References External links 2003 films 2000s erotic thriller films 2000s feminist films 2000s serial killer films 2003 independent films 2000s mystery thriller films 2003 psychological thriller films American films American erotic thriller films American independent films American mystery thriller films American psychological thriller films Australian films Australian erotic thriller films Australian independent films Australian mystery thriller films English-language films British serial killer films British films Erotic mystery films Erotic romance films Films about educators American serial killer films Films about sexuality Films about writers Films based on American novels Films based on mystery novels Films directed by Jane Campion Films produced by Nicole Kidman Films scored by Hilmar √ñrn Hilmarsson Films set in New York City Films shot in New York City Screen Gems films ","title":"In the Cut (film)"},{"id":"705271","text":"Mount Woolley is a mountain in Alberta, Canada, located in the Sunwapta River Valley of Jasper National Park, 1¬Ω km south of Diadem Peak and is part of Winston Churchill Range of the Canadian Rockies.

Woolley, a former football player, climbed extensively with Collie during his 1898 and 1902 expeditions into the Canadian Rockies. The first ascent was made in 1925 by a Japanese team consisting of S. Hashimoto, H. Hatano, T. Hayakawa, Y. Maki, Y. Mita and N. Okabe. They were guided by Hans Fuhrer, H. Kohler and J. Weber. Geology Mount Woolley is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Woolley is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

It is owned by Gaming and Leisure Properties and operated by Penn National Gaming, and is a franchise of Hilton's DoubleTree chain. It offers 1,467 rooms, a gaming floor, and of convention and exhibit space. This location, the Tropicana ‚Äì Las Vegas Boulevard intersection, has the most hotel rooms of any intersection in the world. Pedestrians are not allowed to cross at street level. Instead, the Tropicana is linked by overhead pedestrian bridges to its neighboring casinos: to the north across Tropicana Avenue, the MGM Grand, and to the west across the Strip, the Excalibur. History The leaded-glass ceiling of the Tropicana casino before the 2011 renovation. In 1955, Ben Jaffe, an executive of the Fontainebleau Miami Beach, came to Las Vegas and bought a 40-acre parcel at the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Bond Road (now Tropicana Avenue). Jaffe aimed to build the finest hotel in Las Vegas, featuring a Cuban ambience, with four room themes for guests to choose from: French Provincial, Far East, Italian Renaissance, and Drexel. Construction ran over schedule and over budget, due in part to competition for labor with the under-construction Stardust down the road. Jaffe had to sell his interest in the Fontainebleau to complete the project, which finally opened in April 1957. Jaffe first leased the property to his associate, Phil Kastel. The Gaming Control Board raised suspicions over Kastel's links to organized crime, which were confirmed in May when a note bearing a Tropicana earnings figure was found in the possession of mobster Frank Costello. Jaffe next turned to J. Kell Housells, owner of the Las Vegas Club. By 1959, Housells bought out Jaffe's interest, gaining a majority share in the Tropicana. The Tropicana Country Club opened in 1961 on of land, across the street from the hotel. In the early 1970s, the Tropicana fared poorly from competition with larger hotels like Caesars Palace and the Las Vegas Hilton. Houssels sold out in 1968 to Trans-Texas Airways. Deil Gustafson, a Minnesota financier, bought the Tropicana in 1972. He undertook an expansion plan, but ran into financing difficulties. Edward and Fred Doumani took over management on an emergency basis in 1974 after investing $1 million into the property. Mitzi Stauffer Briggs, heir to the Stauffer Chemical fortune, bought a majority interest in the Tropicana in 1975. Briggs began construction of the 22-floor Tiffany Tower in 1977. The Tropicana became the target of a mob skimming operation in 1978. Joe Agosto, the owner of the casino's Folies Bergere show, oversaw the siphoning of money from the cashier cage to the Kansas City crime family. The scheme was exposed in 1979 by an FBI investigation into hidden mob interests in Las Vegas casinos. Briggs and Gustafson faced revocation of their gaming licenses because they had allowed Agosto to manage the casino without a license. They had little choice but to sell the Tropicana. Hotel chain Ramada Inns purchased the business in December 1979, along with the 50% share of the property's real estate that had been owned by the Doumanis. A 21-story Island Tower was constructed in 1986. Ramada spun off its gaming properties, including the Tropicana, in 1989 as Aztar Corporation. The Tropicana's country club was closed in 1990 after being sold to MGM Grand Inc. to become part of the site of the new MGM Grand casino. In 2002, Aztar consolidated ownership of the Tropicana by buying the remaining 50% interest in the land and buildings from the Jaffe family for $117.5 million. Aztar was acquired by Columbia Sussex in January 2007. A $2-billion renovation of the Tropicana was announced, planned to be completed in 2010, making it the largest resort casino in the world. The existing Paradise and Island towers would have received both interior and exterior renovations, and four new towers would have been built on the property, one of which would be branded as a separate hotel. The plans included a casino, five hotel towers totaling 10,000 rooms, and a sprawling retail promenade. Other amenities included spas and fitness centers; more than 20 restaurants and lounges; a 1,500-seat entertainment venue for big-name headliners; and a water‚Äìride attraction. All improvements to the property were put on hold because of the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, and became moot when Columbia Sussex's gaming arm filed for bankruptcy in 2008. The Tropicana, which had a $440 million secured loan against it, was bought from the bankrupt company in July 2009 by its creditors, led by Canadian private equity firm Onex Corporation and former MGM Mirage CEO Alex Yemenidjian, who took over as CEO. The remainder of Columbia Sussex's gaming business, reorganized under new ownership as Tropicana Entertainment Inc., promptly sued the Las Vegas property, demanding royalties for use of the Tropicana name. The case was eventually settled, with the Tropicana Las Vegas receiving exclusive rights to use the name in the Las Vegas region, royalty-free. In August 2009, Yemenidjian announced a $165-million plan to renovate the property around a South Beach theme, to be done in several phases. The first phase would renovate the Tropicana's back office facilities, with completion planned for the end of 2009. The second phase would renovate the conference facilities, rooms, and common areas, with construction to finish at the end of August 2010. The third phase, including a Nikki Beach Night Club and Nikki Beach multimillion-dollar pool renovation was planned to be completed by April 2011. On November 9, 2010, Tropicana imploded a wing which contained rooms adjacent to Tropicana Avenue. The rooms were the resort's oldest, dating back to 1957. The section was removed to make room for a second entrance to the property and open up space for additional parking. In February 2011, the Tropicana opened a new sports book, operated by Cantor Gaming. In 2012, the Tropicana announced an affiliation with DoubleTree by Hilton. In August 2015, Penn National Gaming purchased the Tropicana for $360 million. In December 2016, as part of Penn's Interactive Division, the Tropicana created an online experience for customers to play. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Penn faced the prospect of financial issues brought on by resort closures. As a result, Penn sold the land occupied by the Tropicana to its spin-off company, Gaming and Leisure Properties. Penn sold the land for $337.5 million in rent credits, and the sale was finalized in April 2020. Penn will continue to operate the Tropicana for another two years, or until the resort and land are sold.

Amenities and entertainment Shows The largest venue at the property is the 1,100-seat Legends in Concert Theater, which features the Prince tribute show Purple Reign (since 2017) and the celebrity impersonator revue Legends in Concert (since 2019). The venue opened in 1973 as the Superstar Theater. It was renamed as the Tiffany Theatre in 1975. In 2011, it became the Gladys Knight Theater when the singer began a residency at the venue. It was renamed as the Tropicana Theater later that year, after Knight's departure, and then to its current name in 2019. Other productions at the theater have included magician Rick Thomas (1997-2005); magician Dirk Arthur (2005‚Äì10); singer Wayne Newton (2009‚Äì10); percussion group Recycled Percussion (2010‚Äì12); a live production of Dancing with the Stars (2012); Mamma Mia!, the Broadway musical based on the songs of ABBA (2014); Raiding the Rock Vault, a musical featuring classic rock songs (2014‚Äì16); illusionist Jan Rouven (2014‚Äì16); and illusionist David Goldrake (2017‚Äì18). A showroom on the Tropicana's mezzanine level is occupied by the Laugh Factory, a comedy club offering two nightly stand-up comedy shows, as well as nightly performances by impressionist Rich Little and comic magician Murray Sawchuck. The space opened in 1988 as Rodney's Place, a comedy club associated with Rodney Dangerfield, which closed after six months. It then operated as the Comedy Stop from 1990 to 2009. The venue next became the Bobby Slayton Room, offering regular shows by the comedian and several other performers. It then opened as Brad Garrett's Comedy Club in 2010.

From 1959, the Tropicana hosted the Folies Berg√©re Show, the longest running revue theater show in Las Vegas. It closed down March 27, 2009, shortly before its 50th anniversary. Dave Brubeck's 1966 live album, Jackpot!, was recorded at the Tropicana. Attractions From 1999 to 2005, the Tropicana was the home of the Casino Legends Hall of Fame. The facility displayed artifacts and memorabilia from hundreds of casinos, and held induction ceremonies to honor notable Las Vegas entertainers and gaming industry figures. It was quickly replaced by the Las Vegas Historic Museum, which then closed in 2006. An exhibit space at the Tropicana hosted \\"Titanic: The Artifact Exhibition\\" beginning in 2005. It was joined in 2006 by \\"Bodies: The Exhibition\\", a display of preserved human bodies. The two exhibits, both produced by Premier Exhibitions, closed in 2008 to move to the Luxor. They were replaced in March 2011 by the Las Vegas Mob Experience, an attraction describing the rise and fall of organized crime in Las Vegas, featuring mob artifacts, holograms of famed gangsters such as Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, and live actors. After being plagued by technical problems, litigation, and low ticket sales, and going through a bankruptcy and partial closure, the exhibit became known as the Mob Attraction Las Vegas in March 2012. It closed in November 2013. Dining Celebrity chef Robert Irvine opened his restaurant at the Tropicana, Robert Irvine's Public House, in July 2017. Other dining options include the Italian restaurant Bacio and Oakville Steakhouse. Other amenities Other amenities at the property include boutique stores; a swimming pool with tropical landscaping, waterfalls and an outdoor bar; and a wedding chapel. The Tropicana also contains the resort office for Virgin Holidays.

The Big River separates the massif of the mountain from the Bogong High Plains to the south. From the nearby town of Mount Beauty to its summit, Mount Bogong rises more than , thus making it one of the highest peaks in Australia not only in terms of its elevation above sea level, but also in terms of actual base-to-summit prominence. Mount Bogong is a popular backcountry skiing mountain through winter but only has snow for the mid winter-spring months. It is around by road and walking track or direct to Mount Beauty. Falls Creek and Mount Hotham ski resorts are also nearby. Camping is relatively safe below the treeline but the summit ridgeline is very exposed. Emergency shelter is also available at Bivouac Hut on the Staircase Spur, and at Cleve Cole, above Camp Creek on the broad ridge to the south of the summit, and Michell's Hut on the Eskdale Spur. Etymology In the Australian Aboriginal Waywurru and Dhudhuroa languages, the mountain is named Warkwoolowler, meaning the mountain where Aboriginal people collected the boo.gong fly. Additionally, in the Dhudhuroa language the word Bugung means the brown moth, referring to Agrotis infusa. While \\"Bogong\\" in the local Aboriginal language is believed to mean bigfella. Flora and fauna The lower slopes of Mount Bogong are covered with tall forests of Alpine Ash (Eucalyptus delegatensis) to an altitude of about . From to , woodland and open woodland of Snow Gum (Eucalyptus pauciflora) dominate, and above , the vegetation consists of alpine shrubland, grassland and herbfield. Animals that live on Mount Bogong have all found some way to adapt to the environment which is very harsh. For example, bogong moths gregariously aestivate in caves throughout the mountain to avoid desiccation.Common, I. F. B. (1954). \\"A study of the ecology of the adult bogong moth, Agrotis infusa (Boisd) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), with special reference to its behaviour during migration and aestivation\\". Australian Journal of Zoology. 2 (2): 223‚Äì263. Other animals that live on Mount Bogong include the pygmy possum, smoky mouse, broad toothed rat, powerful owl, spotted tree frog and she-oak skink. Much of the mountain, especially the northern side, was badly burnt in the 2003 Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires. History Mount Bogong towers above the Kiewa River valley and is of great significance to the local traditional owners. Parks Victoria states that \\"Many Aboriginal people have a remarkably rich history of Aboriginal use in the Victorian Alps and a vast knowledge of the cultural sites, oral history and ancestral stories that relate to the alpine region of Victoria. Throughout the many seasons each year, Aboriginal groups would come from as far away as the coast and south west slopes, to meet with the tribes of the mountains for intertribal ceremonies and feasting on Bogong Moths. During these festivities they would exchange cultural objects and materials for tools\\". According to Eddie Kneebone, an indigenous historian, \\"the Yiatmathong (people) controlled the Kiewa and Mitta Mitta valleys, they also had control of the Alpine region on the Victorian side. Their southernmost boundary extended to Hotham and ran along the highest ridge line of the Alps in an east-west direction. Because Mount Bogong fell within the Yiatmathong territory, permission had to be gained from them by the other tribes participating in the summer feast. Once this was done, the tribes would spend summer in the cooler climate of the mountains feasting on the protein rich Bogong moth\\". Kneebone claims that prior to climbing Mount Bogong and the Bogong High Plains, the tribes would gather by the Murray River at Mungabarreena (near modern Albury). After ceremonies, initiations, marriages, trading, settling of disputes, and renewing of alliances and friendships, the groups would walk from Albury to the mountain region to feed on the protein-rich Bogong moths. Following European settlement, indigenous groups were decimated and survivors were placed onto settlements, often far from the traditional lands. Indigenous visitation to Mount Bogong is generally understood to have finished by the mid19 century. While there was cattle grazing for some time, it was the walkers and then skiers who became the next group to visit the mountain in large numbers. In August 1936 Mick Hull, Howard Michell and Cleve Cole attempted the first winter crossing of the Bogong High Plains. The group became lost in blizzard conditions and Cole died of hypothermia soon after he and Mick Hull were discovered by a rescue party raised by Michell. Cole was buried on 22 August at the Cheltenham Pioneer Cemetery. The hut commemorating Cole's life was completed in 1938, and has served as the hub of back-country skiing and bushwalking exploration of the Bogong area since. Accommodation at the hut is free on a first-in-first-served basis, although donations to The Bogong Club are welcomed. Parks Victoria advises skiers and walkers to carry an alpine-capable tent, and not to rely on accommodation in the huts. Cole's death illustrates the danger of Mount Bogong and of the Victorian Alps in general. The mountains are geologically old and worn. Their low altitude and flattish, rounded tops make for easy skiing and walking, but descent of their steep sides in whiteout conditions can be perilous. Ascent routes Mount Bogong in the spring There are many routes up Mount Bogong for hikers, including (clockwise from north west) Staircase Spur, Eskdale Spur, Granite Flat Spur, Long Spur, Duane Spur, and Quartz Ridge. All involve a climb of more than from the saddle or creek at the base of these spurs. The two main walking trails lead to the summit. The Staircase and Eskdale Spur can both be accessed from a trail that begins at Mountain Creek Picnic Area. It is also possible to access Camp Creek Gap on the Eskdale Spur in a 4WD vehicle along Eskdale Spur Track from Trappers Gap. Both trails are of moderate difficulty. Starting from the picnic area, the Staircase is a return trip, normally taking 6‚Äì9 hours return, while the Eskdale Spur is a return trip, normally taking 8‚Äì11 hours return. The Staircase Spur is a difficult ascent due to its steep slopes. From the base of the staircase it is to the summit. Halfway up the staircase is Bivouac Hut which sits about from the summit on a small flat section, it offers emergency refuge, camp sites and a resting spot before heading to the summit. The Eskdale spur may provide a slightly easier option up to the summit of Bogong if you have a 4WD, although if you walk up from Mountain Creek, it is just a longer way to do the same ascent. With a 4WD you can drive from the bottom of the Staircase Spur at Mountain Creek, through to Camp Creek Gap, from where it is about 2.5 hrs walk to the summit of Bogong, and this is the easiest winter access, although occasionally the 4WD track is covered with snow. Just over halfway up the Eskdale Spur is Michell Hut, which burnt down during the 2003 bushfires but was later rebuilt. Michell Hut provides emergency refuge, toilet, camp sites and a resting area before the final climb up to where the Eskdale meets Granite Flat Spur at the treeline, where there is also a good, but exposed campsite. Granite Flat Spur also provides access to the summit. It can be accessed by 4WD either from Eskdale, or by continuing on from Camp Creek Gap around the 4WD track, which is only possible outside of winter. An hour beyond Camp Creek Gap by 4WD will get you to the end of the 4WD track, from which it takes about 1.5 hrs walk to the summit (i.e. it is no quicker than walking up the Eskdale, but you walk less, and drive further). Above the treeline, both the Staircase and Eskdale Spurs are very exposed, particularly in winter, and they may \\"ice up\\" after about 4pm, making progress dangerous.

It was owned and operated by MGM Mirage. It was part of the Holiday Inn hotel chain until it was acquired by MGM in 2000. It was built before the era of the mega-casinos, and with 653 rooms was relatively small compared to many properties in its vicinity. The Boardwalk was located in between the Bellagio and the Monte Carlo and across from the Paris, Aladdin and MGM Grand. The hotel's Coney Island theme could be seen in its facade with an original 1906 parachute jump ride and a faux wooden roller coaster. The hotel was composed of three distinct buildings all built at different times. The newest building was the sixteen-story tower built in 1996. History The Boardwalk began as a 138-room Holiday Inn hotel, planned for opening in August 1965. The hotel included a restaurant, cocktail lounge, and meeting space with a capacity for 100 people. The hotel, located at 3740 South Las Vegas Boulevard, was designed by architect Homer Rissman and was completed in 1966. The hotel first opened with a six-floor tower, ultimately known as the Steeplechase tower. In March 1966, employees of the Holiday Inn, who were represented by the Culinary Workers Union, began picketing in front of the hotel, alleging that they did not receive wages and conditions that were standard for the area. Holiday Inn denied the claim, stating that wages and conditions were equal to or above local standards. The union ultimately lost its fight. A second hotel tower, eventually known as the Luna Park tower, opened in 1968. Norbert Jansen, former owner of Pioneer Club, opened a gift shop, Holiday Gifts, at the hotel in 1972. In October 1975, the hotel's innkeeper died in a fire that was believed to have been started by a cigarette. The fire was confined to the innkeeper's room on the fifth floor, and caused approximately $40,000 in damage. Guests of the fifth floor were evacuated, and approximately 10 were treated for smoke inhalation. Later that month, the Holiday Inn received approval from the Clark County Commission for a 10-story, 300-room expansion. The hotel was located on . In December 1977, the Nevada Gaming Control Board voted against Avis Jansen's plan to install 15 slot machines at the gift shop, then known as Holiday Gifts South. She had been rejected due to the fact that her husband Norbert was the landlord of the business; he had previously been convicted of tax evasion in the 1960s, and was also involved in a company that filed bankruptcy. The gift shop soon began operating a casino on the site known as Slot Joynt. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the hotel was known as Holiday Inn South and Holiday Inn South Strip, differentiating it from other Holiday Inn hotels in the city. The hotel was renamed as the Viscount in 1985. Boardwalk (1989‚Äì2006) In 1989, under the management of Jansen, the hotel and casino were branded Boardwalk Hotel & Casino (alternately, Holiday Inn Casino Boardwalk, or Boardwalk Holiday Inn). Boardwalk became a public corporation (Boardwalk Casino, Inc.) in 1994. The carnival facade was built the following year and a 15-floor, 451-room tower was finished in 1996. In 1996, Jacobs Entertainment made a $9 million investment in the Boardwalk. In December 1997, Mirage Resorts agreed to purchase the Boardwalk and three adjacent parcels for $135 million. The $105 million Boardwalk sale was approved by the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission in June 1998. At the time, the Holiday Inn Boardwalk included 650 employees, 653 rooms and a casino. Minor improvements were planned for the Boardwalk, with no immediate plans to replace it. A decision to expand or replace the Boardwalk was expected within three or four years. When MGM Mirage took ownership in 2000, the Holiday Inn name was dropped. The hotel and casino closed on January 9, 2006, and the main hotel tower was imploded on May 9, 2006. The property is now the location of Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas at CityCenter.

Diadem Peak is essentially the high point of a ridge leading down from the slightly higher Mount Woolley (). This peak was the first 11,000er north of the Columbia Icefield to be climbed and one of the few peaks in the Canadian Rockies to be climbed before 1900. The mountain was named in 1898 by the first ascent team of J. Norman Collie, Hugh Stutfield and Hermann Woolley. Upon reaching the summit, they discovered a crown (diadem) of snow about high covering the almost flat layer of rocks on top.  Climbing history  Diadem Peak (right) and Mount Woolley (left), from Parker Ridge In the summer of 1898, J. Norman Collie, Hugh Stutfield and Herman Woolley, had made their way up Woolley Creek and initially had their sights on reaching the top of Mount Woolley by climbing the icefield that separates Mt. Woolley from Diadem Peak. However, after a brief downpour which forced them to seek shelter among some rocks, they had just begun preparing the rope for ascending the icefield when a large collapse of ice from the summit made them switch their objective to Diadem Peak. The party ascended the southeast ridge along loose shale and ice, eventually finding a small rock rib that took them to the summit on August 25. Collie recorded an initial elevation of using a mercurial barometer. With the use of crampons, the difficulties of the southeast ridge route are reduced by following a shallow snow gully up much of the way.Corbett, pp. 52-53 In 1962, William Buckingham and Bill Hooker, ascended Diadem Peak by what is now known as the South Ridge route. This route initially traverses loose rock ledges to reach a snow/ice couloir which is followed until the glacier levels off and is no longer fractured. Traversing left across rock to the glacier, the route follows the glacier up to the Woolley-Diadem col where Diadem's summit is reached after an easy ascent up the ridge. Jim Elzinga and Jeff Marshall made the first ascent up a mixed route on the North face of Diadem in July 1981. This route is known as \\"Humble Horse\\" (IV, 5.7, W4). Geology Mushroom Peak (left) and Diadem Peak (right) seen from the Icefields Parkway Diadem Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Diadem Peak is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

It is owned and operated by MGM Resorts International. Excalibur, named for the mythical sword of King Arthur, uses the Medieval theme in several ways. Its facade is a stylized image of a castle (see also: List of castles in the United States). Until 2007, a wizard-like figure representing Merlin looked out from a high turret (since replaced by a figure advertising Dick's Last Resort). Excalibur is situated at the Tropicana ‚Äì Las Vegas Boulevard intersection. The hotel is linked by overhead pedestrian bridges to neighboring casinos to the north (New York-New York, across Tropicana Avenue) and to the east (Tropicana, across the Strip). A free tram connects Excalibur to its sister MGM Resorts International properties to the south, Luxor and Mandalay Bay. History The land on which the Excalibur sits was originally the proposed site of the Xanadu Resort envisioned in 1975. The 1,730 room Asian-tropical themed resort would have been the first mega resort in Las Vegas. The project was never built when the developers could not secure a deal with the county on the sewer infrastructure such a large project would have required. Circus Circus Enterprises constructed Excalibur which opened on June 19, 1990, as the largest hotel in the world, with more than 4,000 rooms covering over 70 acres. As of 2016 it is the seventh-largest hotel (by total number of rooms) in Las Vegas, and the eleventh-largest hotel worldwide. MGM Resorts International purchased the property in 2005. Excalibur was designed in line with the \\"theme resort\\" strategy popular among some casino operators during the 1990s, which included the traditional Las Vegas gaming experience coupled with family-oriented elements. However, since 2006 most of the medieval themed statues and scenery have been removed as part of a four-year renovation and modernization project. As of 2010, few of the themed wall murals still remained as Excalibur was updated to include more modern and understated elements, including contemporary furniture and flat-screen plasma TVs in 2,000 renovated guest rooms. On March 21, 2003, Josh Ford of Los Angeles hit the largest Megabucks Jackpot to date of US$39.7 million at Excalibur. Facilities and attractions Decorative Work at Excalibur Hotel & Casino The gaming area at Excalibur consists of table games and more than 1,200 slot machines. In addition to casino space, the Excalibur resort includes a renovated pool area, a spa and fitness center, eight restaurants and a food court, the Chapel at Excalibur, and the Octane Lounge & The Lounge with live music on the weekends, and an arcade. In May 1999, the casino partnered with World Championship Wrestling to open the WCW Nitro Grill, which was the first professional wrestling themed restaurant and nightclub in the United States; the restaurant was frequently visited by numerous professional wrestlers. WCW Nitro Grill operated for 16 months before closing in September 2000 due in part to WCW's financial problems; the restaurant's current space would later be occupied by a Dick's Last Resort location, where it remains to this day. Excalibur is home to three permanent shows: the all-male revue Thunder From Down Under, The Australian Bee Gees Show, a tribute to the Bee Gees and the medieval themed dinner show Tournament of Kings. Thunder From Down Under moved to Excalibur in July 2001 and since then has received recognition as one of the best all-male strip shows in Las Vegas. In 2006, the performance space was renamed the \\"Thunder From Down Under Showroom\\" in honor of the troupe. Tournament of Kings is a medieval jousting tournament performed with 12 breeds of horses and 32 cast members in a 925-seat amphitheater called King Arthur's Arena. The show includes a banquet feast served by a costumed serf or wench and is meant to be eaten without utensils. Tournament of Kings debuted along with the opening of Excalibur in 1990. Dick's Last Resort restaurant opened at Excalibur in June 2007. Dick's is known for its unusual dining experience in which servers purposefully act obnoxious towards guests. Employee \\"Taco\\" is considered Dick's mascot and entertains guests with his own version of the Bellagio fountain show using water dispensers behind the bar. Excalibur's food court housed one of the few McDonald's in the world to vend Pepsi instead of Coke until the restaurant closed in early 2016. The fun dungeon is an arcade from which you can access the Tournament of Kings arena, and also includes a laser tag arena. In 1993, the Excalibur introduced a new attraction featuring a 71 foot animatronic dragon fighting with Merlin in the moat of the castle. Every day between 6 p.m. and midnight, visitors could watch the mechanical puppets designed by Alvaro Villa's AVG Entertainment. The hourly show, which had been awarded the \\"Worst Attraction\\" accolade by Las Vegas Review Journal twice, was discontinued in 2004. In popular culture Excalibur has been featured in several video game and television productions since opening in 1990. Excalibur itself, or a hotel resembling Excalibur, makes appearances in the video games Driver 2 and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. In television productions, Excalibur was the setting for a stunt on the Las Vegas edition of Fear Factor and was featured in an episode of South Park called \\"It Hits the Fan\\". Also, season six of Top Chef contestant Jennifer used Excalibur as the inspiration for one of her meals. The mobile game Fate/Grand Order's 2019 summer event is set in Las Vegas and takes place at a fictional casino modeled after Excalibur called \\"Camelot & Co.\\", run by Merlin and Altria, the series' gender-flipped version of King Arthur.

History Monte Carlo (1996‚Äì2018) =Construction and opening= Park MGM is located on part of the former site of the Dunes casino and golf course. Mirage Resorts purchased the Dunes in 1992 and closed it in January 1993. In May 1994, Mirage and Gold Strike Resorts announced a joint venture to build a $250-million casino targeted at budget-conscious visitors, on of the Dunes site. Ground was broken for the hotel in March 1995. Circus Circus Enterprises acquired Gold Strike in June 1995 and took over its role of managing the project. Gold Strike had hoped to name the project as the Grand Victoria, the same name as the casino being developed by the company in Illinois, but that idea was discarded because of potential confusion with the MGM Grand. \\"Victoria\\" and \\"Victoria Bay\\" were reported as likely names for the property. Details about the property were revealed in July 1995, including that it would be named the Monte Carlo and feature Belle √âpoque architecture, based on the Monte Carlo Casino in Monaco. The Monte Carlo opened to the public at midnight on June 21, 1996, following an invitation-only pre-opening celebration, including a fireworks show. The project ultimately cost $344 million to build. =2008 fire= On January 25, 2008, at 10:57 AM, a three- alarm fire was reported on the exterior of the top six floors and roof of the casino. Portions of the hotel facade's Exterior Insulation Finishing System burned with some debris falling and starting smaller secondary fires on ledges three floors below. The fire was fully contained an hour after it began. It was an exterior fire, although there was water damage to parts of several floors. The Hotel & Casino reopened to guests on February 15, 2008. MGM Mirage officials put the total losses due to fire damage and loss of business at just under $100 million. Fire investigators interviewed witnesses and investigated the scene, and determined the likely cause of the fire was the improper cutting and welding operations by contractors who were installing a steel catwalk.  Park Theater (2016-present)  The 5,200-seat Park Theater at the Monte Carlo was built and opened on December 17, 2016. The theater has had residencies by Ricky Martin (All In) and Cher (Classic Cher). The theater will be holding a 2 year residency by Lady Gaga from 28 December 2018 until further notice called Enigma as well as the first concert residency by Janet Jackson beginning in May 2019 titled Janet Jackson: Metamorphosis. Park MGM (2018‚Äìpresent) In June 2016, MGM announced a joint venture with Sydell Group that the Monte Carlo would be renovated and rebranded as the Park MGM, named after the adjacent dining and entertainment district, The Park, that opened in April 2016, and the NoMad Hotel would occupy the top floors. It will feature the new Eataly restaurant. Both hotels began construction at the end of 2016, with completion planned for 2018. The property was officially renamed Park MGM on May 9, 2018. In September 2020, MGM Resorts announced that both the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas would reopen on 30 September as Las Vegas‚Äôs first ever fully smoke-free casino resort, after closing due to the Coronavirus pandemic in March 2020.

It is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment and has a 95,263 square-foot casino with over 1,700 slot machines. The theme is the city of Paris; it includes a half scale, tall replica of the Eiffel Tower,https://skyscrapercenter.com/building/eiffel-tower-paris-las-vegas/14040 a sign in the shape of the Montgolfier balloon, a two-thirds size Arc de Triomphe, a replica of La Fontaine des Mers, and a 1,200-seat theatre called Le Th√©√¢tre des Arts. The front of the hotel suggests the Louvre, Mus√©e d'Orsay, and Paris Opera House. The Paris is linked via a promenade to its sister property, Bally's Las Vegas, through which it is linked to the Las Vegas Monorail at the Bally's & Paris station. History In May 1995, Bally Entertainment, owner of the adjacent Bally's Las Vegas, announced the project at a shareholders meeting. Paris was designed by architectural companies Leidenfrost/Horowitz & Assoc., Bergman, Walls & Assoc. and MBH Architects. The design architect of the project was Bergman Walls Associates. Herbert Horowitz, Partner of Leidenfrost/Horowitz & Assoc., was executive architect and signed all plans. Bally broke ground for the Paris Las Vegas on April 18, 1997, and construction began in May on the parcel. It was built at an estimated cost of $760 million. Original plans for the Eiffel Tower called for a full-scale replica, however that would have interfered with the nearby McCarran Airport and designers therefore reduced it to approximately 1:2 scale. The hotel is 33 stories tall. A unique architectural aspect of the Paris is that the back legs of its Eiffel Tower actually come down through the ceiling into the casino floor. Paris Las Vegas opened on September 1, 1999, with fireworks being shot from the Eiffel Tower. French actress Catherine Deneuve flipped a switch, turning on all of Paris' lights, including the various crystal chandeliers in the main lobby. On January 31, 2007, Paris Las Vegas premiered its new show The Producers, headlined by David Hasselhoff. There were reports of friction between the show's producers and Hasselhoff and he announced he would leave May 6 due to other commitments. The Producers refocused on Max, played by Tony Danza. Danza came on as the celebrity actor for the show until The Producers closed on February 9, 2008. Barry Manilow headlined at the Paris from March 6, 2010, to December, 2012. To counter the 2008‚Äì2009 economic downturn, Harrah's focused on marketing its properties to specific segments of the population; as a result Paris is being marketed heavily towards gay and lesbian travelers. Beginning in 2010, a series of improvement projects were started that would see some removal of the Parisian theme. The French greeters around the property began to be phased out, and in early 2010 a major remodel project was started at the front entrance. The project debuted in Spring 2011 and included a new nightclub called 'Chateau' and the largest Sugar Factory store on the Strip. It was announced in early December 2010 that the hotel's famous steakhouse Les Artisies would close at the end of January 2011 to make way for Gordon Ramsay Steak, which opened in June 2011. The Chateau nightclub opened in early March, 2011. The nightclub overlooks the Strip and spans more than in a two-story, outdoor setting. Outside is a terrace overlooking the Strip with VIP cabanas and three additional bars. During the day, the terrace serves as a beer garden and restaurant, opening at 10 a.m. In 2015, Hexx Kitchen & Bar and Hexx Chocolate & Confexxions was opened in the space formerly occupied by the Sugar Factory. Hexx was the first \\"bean-to-bar\\" chocolate maker in Nevada. In 2016, Beer Park by Budweiser opened on a 10,000-square-foot (930 m¬≤) deck overlooking the Las Vegas Strip. It is Las Vegas' first rooftop bar and grill.

He was known as Mississippi's \\"Great Commoner.\\" Biography James Z. George was born in Monroe County, Georgia, but moved to Noxubee County, Mississippi at age eight when his widowed mother remarried, and two years later, to Carroll County, Mississippi, where he received his education in the common schools.Thomas H. Somorville, \\"A Sketch of the Supreme Court of Mississippi\\", in Horace W. Fuller, ed., The Green Bag, Vol. XI (1899), p. 513. He served as a private in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War under Colonel Jefferson Davis, and participated in the Battle of Monterey. On his return, George read law and was admitted to the bar. In 1854 he became a reporter of the Supreme Court of Mississippi and, over the next 20 years, George prepared a 10-volume digest of its cases. As a member of the Mississippi Secession Convention, George signed the Secession Ordinance. A Confederate colonel of the 5th Mississippi Cavalry during the Civil War, he was captured twice and spent two years in a prisoner of war camp, where he conducted a law course for his fellow captives. After the war, he returned to Mississippi and resumed the practice of law. In 1879 he was appointed to the Supreme Court of Mississippi and immediately was chosen chief justice by his colleagues. From 1881 until his death, George represented Mississippi in the United States Senate, where he was recognized for his skills in debate, helped frame the future Sherman Anti-Trust Act, introduced the bill for agricultural college experiment stations, and encouraged the establishment of the Department of Agriculture. Alarmed by the proposed Lodge Bill, which would have provided for federal supervision of elections, he campaigned in Mississippi for a constitutional convention in order to legally disenfranchise African-Americans, without resorting to violence, fraud, and other extralegal measures that had been used prior. He was a major figure during the Mississippi Constitutional Convention of 1890 itself, leading a hardline faction promoting the disenfranchisement of blacks without disenfranchising whites (as opposed to those who wanted to apply property and educational requirements to whites and blacks equally), and successfully defended the constitution before the Senate and the Supreme Court.Ogden, Frederic D.

His 1971 book Journeys Out of the Body is credited with popularizing the term \\"out-of-body experience\\". Monroe achieved worldwide recognition as an explorer of human consciousness and out-of-body experiences. His research, beginning in the 1950s, produced evidence that specific sound patterns have identifiable, beneficial effects on our capabilities. For example, certain combinations of frequencies appeared to enhance alertness; others to induce sleep; and still others to evoke expanded states of consciousness. Assisted by specialists in psychology, medicine, biochemistry, psychiatry, electrical engineering, physics, and education, Monroe developed Hemi-Sync, a patented audio technology that is claimed to facilitate enhanced performance.Monroe, Robert A (1977) \\"Journeys Out of the Body\\", Anchor Press, Russell Ronald (2007) \\"The Journey of Robert Monroe: From Out-Of-Body Explorer to Consciousness Pioneer\\", Hampton Roads Publishing, Stockton Bayard (1989) \\"Catapult: The Biography of Robert A.

He grew up in Lexington, Kentucky, and Columbus, Ohio; his mother, Georgia Helen Jordan Monroe, was a non-practicing medical doctor and cellist and piano player. His father, Robert Emmett Monroe, was a college professor of Romance Languages who led summer tours to Europe. Monroe had two older sisters, Dorothy and Peggy, and a younger brother, Emmett, who became a medical doctor. According to his third book Ultimate Journey,Ultimate Journey, published 1994 by Doubleday he dropped out of Ohio State University in his sophomore year due to a hospital stay for a facial burn that caused him to fall behind in his studies. During almost a year away from college, a desire to find work led him to become a hobo who rode freight trains. He returned to Ohio State to graduate after having studied pre-med, English, engineering, and journalism. He had an early fascination with flying and music and had great mechanical aptitude. He displayed some ability to read music by age four without having studied the subject, perhaps by listening to his mother and sisters playing piano. He married Jeanette, a graduate student and daughter of a lawyer, in 1937, and divorced her in 1938 or 1939. He married Mary Ashworth, a divorcee with a daughter Maria, in 1950 or 1951. They had Bob's only biological child together, daughter Laurie. They divorced in 1968. He then married Nancy Penn Honeycutt, a divorcee with four children. They remained married until her death from breast cancer on August 15, 1992. Monroe developed ulcers in young adulthood and so was classified 4F (unfit for service) during World War II. He spent the war years working for a manufacturing company that designed a flight-simulator prototype. He wrote for an aviation column in Argosy magazine and was given a job with the National Aeronautic Association (NAA), for whom he produced a weekly radio show called \\"Scramble!\\", the primary purpose of which was to interest youth in aviation. In 1953 Mr. Monroe formed RAM Enterprises, a corporation that produced network radio programs, as many as 28 programs monthly, principally in dramatic and popular quiz shows. In 1956 the firm created a Research and Development division to study the effects of various sound patterns on human consciousness, including the sleep state. Monroe was especially attracted to the concept of sleep-learning. This was a natural direction to take, applying to this new area the audio production methods used in the firm's commercial activity. The purpose was to find more constructive uses for such knowledge than was ordinarily available, and the results of this research have become internationally known. First out-of- body experiences According to his own account, while experimenting with sleep-learning in 1958 Monroe experienced an unusual phenomenon, which he described as sensations of paralysis and vibration accompanied by a bright light that appeared to be shining on him from a shallow angle. Monroe went on to say that this occurred another nine times over the next six weeks, culminating in his first out-of-body experience (OBE). Monroe recorded his account in his 1971 book Journeys Out of the Body and went on to become a prominent researcher in the field of human consciousness. Monroe later authored two more books on his experiments with OBE, Far Journeys (1985) and Ultimate Journey (1994). The Monroe Institute In 1962 the company moved to Virginia, and a few years later changed the corporate name to Monroe Industries. In this location it became active in radio station ownership, cable television, and later in the production and sale of audio cassettes. These cassettes were practical expressions of the discoveries made in the earlier and ongoing corporate research program. In 1985 the company officially changed its name, once again, to Interstate Industries, Inc. This reflected Monroe's analogy of how the use of Hemi-Sync serves as a ramp from the \\"local road\\" to the \\"interstate\\" in allowing people to go \\"full steam ahead\\" in the exploration of consciousness, avoiding all of the stops and starts. The research subsidiary was divested and established as an independent non-profit organization, The Monroe Institute, later in 1985. Interstate Industries, Inc. remains a privately held company, now doing business as Monroe Products. Monroe's leadership of the entire program of development was supported for more than 50 years by many specialists who continue their participation to this day. His daughter, Laurie Monroe, continued her father's research into consciousness and the mind's potential until her death in 2006. Under the current direction of another of Monroe's daughters, Maria Monroe Whitehead, Monroe's stepson, A. J. Honeycutt, and Teresa West, president of Monroe Products, the company's objective is to continue to expand the Hemi-Sync line of products and their benefits into markets worldwide. The Monroe Institute (TMI) is a nonprofit education and research organization devoted to the exploration of human consciousness, based in Faber, Virginia, United States.The Monroe Institute Upwards of 20,000 people are estimated to have attended TMI's residential Gateway program during its first thirty years,R. Russell, Journey of Robert Monroe: From Out of Body Explorer to Consciousness Pioneer, Deep Books, July 2007, p105. with consumers of the audio industry founded on its research running into millions.R.C. Filimon, Beneficial Subliminal Music: Binaural Beats, Hemi-Sync and Metamusic, Proceedings of the 11th WSEAS international conference on Acoustics & music: theory & applications, 2010, p106 Currently, many tens of thousands of people have experienced the residential programs developed by the Monroe Institute at TMI's campus in Virginia as well as across the US and the world, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cyprus, England, France, Germany, Japan, Romania, and Spain. TMI claims a policy of no dogma or bias with respect to belief system, religion, political or social stance. Monroe founded TMI after he started having what he called \\"out of body experiences\\", now also commonly referred to as OBEs. The institute is housed in several buildings on of land south of Charlottesville, Virginia, USA. One of its activities includes teaching various techniques, based on audio-guidance processes, in order to expand consciousness and explore areas of consciousness not normally available in the waking state. In 1978, the U.S. military evaluated TMI and arranged to send officers there for OBE training.Gondola Wish Assessment Report, 902d Military Intelligence Group, 25 August 1978. In 1983, it sent additional officers.Remote Viewers: The Secret History of America's Psychic Spies, Jim Schnabel, 1997, p292-3. INSCOM log for August 1983 to January 1984 Research Controlled studies of the Institute's technology suggest that it is effective as an analgesic supplement and can reduce hospital discharge times.\\"The Effect of Hemispheric Synchronization on Intraoperative Analgesia\\", Lewis, Osborn & Roth, Anesthesia & Analgesia, Vol 98 2, February 2004, p533-536\\"Hemispheric Synchronized Sounds and Perioperative Analgesic Requirements\\", Dabu-Bondoc, Vadivelu, Benson, Perret & Kain, Anesthesia & Analgesia, Vol 110 1, January 2010, p208-210 The Institute has an affiliated professional membership, and also publishes scientific papers on a subset of its own studies of altered states of consciousness.\\"Accessing Anomalous States of Consciousness with a Binaural Beat Technology\\", F Holmes Atwater, Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol 1, No 3, 1997, p263-274 In its in-house laboratory, these states or focus levels are typically induced by delivering Hemi-Sync signals to subjects performing relaxation procedures inside a shielded, sense-depriving isolation tank. Progression through states is detected and monitored by measurement of peripheral skin temperature, galvanic skin response and DC skin potential voltage. Coverage In 1994, a front- page article in the Wall Street Journal reported confirmation from the former director of the Intelligence and Security Command of the U.S. Army sending personnel to the institute. It also stated the opinion of the head of the Zen Buddhist temple in Vancouver British Columbia that \\"Gateway students can reach meditation states in a week that took [me] 30 years of sitting\\".Bob Ortega, \\"Research institute shows people a way out of their bodies\\", The Wall Street Journal, September 20, 1994, pp. A1, A8. A reporter for The Hook, weekly newspaper for Charlottesville, Virginia, who visited The Monroe Institute said, \\"...with a few exceptions, the only 'normal' people with whom I could fully identify were the trainers, who seemed remarkably well-grounded for people whose day-to-day experiences include astral projection and disembodied spirits\\".Stephen Barling, \\"Cosmic degrees: Out of body at the Monroe Institute\\". The Hook. February 13, 2003. The reporter also concluded that \\"there is something significant being developed at the Institute. Whether it's just a brilliant guided meditation complete with trance-inducing stereoscopic sound, or a doorway to a world of spirit entities, I cannot say\\". Hemi- Sync In 1975, Monroe registered the first of several patentsUS Patent 3884218: \\"Method of inducing and maintaining various stages of sleep in the human being\\"US Patent 5213562: \\"Method of inducing mental, emotional and physical states of consciousness, including specific mental activity, in human beings\\"US Patent 5356368: \\"Method of and apparatus for inducing desired states of consciousness\\" concerning audio techniques designed to stimulate brain functions until the left and right hemispheres became synchronized. Monroe held that this state, dubbed Hemi-Sync (hemispherical synchronization), could be used to promote mental well-being or to trigger an altered state of consciousness. Monroe's concept was based on an earlier hypothesis known as binaural beats and has since been expanded upon a commercial basis by the self-help industry.Sheikh, Anees A.(2003) \\"Healing Images: The Role Of Imagination in Health\\", Baywood Publishing, Hemi-Sync is a trademarked brand name for a patented process used to create audio patterns containing binaural beats, which are commercialized in the form of audio CDs. Interstate Industries Inc., created by Hemi-Sync founder Robert Monroe, is the owner of the Hemi-Sync technology. Hemi-Sync is short for Hemispheric Synchronization, also known as brainwave synchronization. Monroe indicated that the technique synchronizes the two hemispheres of one's brain, thereby creating a 'frequency-following response' designed to evoke certain effects. Hemi-Sync has been used for many purposes, including relaxation and sleep induction, learning and memory aids, helping those with physical and mental difficulties, and reaching altered states of consciousness through the use of sound. The technique involves using sound waves to entrain brain waves. Wearing headphones, Monroe claimed that brains respond by producing a third sound (called binaural beats) that encouraged various brainwave activity changes.\\"\\". The Effects of Hemi-Sync on Electrocortical Activity, Sadigh and Kozicky In 2002, a University of Virginia presentation at the Society for Psychophysiologial Research examined Monroe's claim. The presentation demonstrated that EEG changes did not occur when the standard electromagnetic headphones of Monroe's setup were replaced by air conduction headphones, which were connected to a remote transducer by rubber tubes. This suggests that the basis for the entrainment effects is electromagnetic rather than acoustical.Chandra Stone, Phyllis Thomas, Dennis McClain-Furmanski, & James E. Horton (2002). \\"EEG oscillations and binaural beat as compared with electromagnetic headphones and air-conduction headphones\\", Psychophysiology vol 39, pp. S80 Replicated, double-blind, randomized trials on anesthetized patients have found Hemi-Sync effective as a partial replacement for fentanyl during surgery. A similar study found it ineffective at replacing propofol however.

Featuring what was described at the time as the \\"standard Australian wheelbase of 111 inches\\", it was intended to provide the company with a genuine rival to large local models like the Ford Falcon, the Holden Kingswood, and the Chrysler Valiant. But, due to the first real fuel crisis and demand far exceeding the supply, Leyland rushed the assembly process with the first of the P76s to come off the assembly line, resulting in poor build quality and some reliability problems. The combination of the rushed assembly, fuel crisis and strikes at the component manufacturers' factories, resulted in the Leyland P76 being labelled a lemon, despite receiving the Wheels magazine Car of the Year in 1973. By 1974, sales of the P76 had slumped and BMC decided to end the production of the P76. Although the P76 has been labelled a lemon in Australian motoring history, it is viewed by some as an iconic Australian car and has a loyal following. In 1969, Leyland Australia was given the go-ahead to build a large car for Australia. At the time of the car's launch, it was reported that Leyland Australia had an accumulated deficit equivalent to ¬£8.6 million, and had borrowed the same amount again in order to fund the development of the P76. The P76 was designed and built from scratch with a fund of only A$20m. This was also a decade of serious financial and operational challenges for the parent company back in Britain. Commercial success for this car was therefore seen as crucial to the survival of Leyland in Australia. Launched in 1973, the P76 was nicknamed \\"the wedge\\", on account of its shape, with a large boot, able to easily hold a 44 gallon drum. Although station wagon and \\"Force 7\\" coup√© versions were designed, these never went into mass production. Naming the P76 The name of the P76 derived from the car's codename while in development (Project 76). The official line was that the P76 was an original Australian designed and built Large Family Car, with no overseas counterpart and that P76 stood for \\"Project 1976\\". The Rover SD1 (released in 1976) shared several engineering features with the P76 -- including MacPherson strut front suspension, the aluminium V8 engine and a live rear axle. The P76 itself was, however, out of production by 1976. An alternative theory is that P76 were simply the first three digits of Lord Stokes' National Service number (Donald Stokes was Chairman of British Leyland at the time). Automotive forebears Before the P76, Leyland Australia and its corporate predecessor BMC (Australia) had not fielded a direct competitor in large-car sector, which then dominated the Australian car market. The P76 was intended to provide that competitor. Previously, BMC and Leyland had tried to compete in this market segment with the 1958 Morris Marshal (a rebadged Austin A95); the 1962 Austin Freeway and Wolseley 24/80 (the Freeway was an Austin A60 with Riley 4/72 tail lights, a unique full width grille and a 2.4-litre 6-cylinder version of the 1622 cc B-series engine; the Wolseley was a 6-cylinder version of the Wolseley 16/60); and the 1971 Austin \\"X6\\" Tasman and Kimberley (facelifted Austin 1800s with the 6-cylinder 2.2-litre E-series engine). Each of these cars was a compromise, and the motoring public largely rejected as challengers to the dominant local models. Nonetheless, the Freeway, 24/80 and the X6 each developed a loyal following. Design and engineering The shape was penned by Giovanni Michelotti. The entry-level P76 featured an enlarged 2663cc 121 bhp (83kW)https://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/leyland_p76_technical_specifications  12May2020 version of the 6-cylinder engine from the smaller Austin Kimberley and Austin Tasman. The top-of-the-line 192 bhp (143kW)https://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/leyland_p76_technical_specifications  12May2020 aluminium 4416 cc V8 unit was unique to the P76, and was a derivative of the ex-Buick V8 that was powering the Rover 3500. Leyland Australia cited a weight advantage approaching for the P76, most of which was attributed to the lighter weight of the aluminium engine block when compared to the cast iron blocks (with bigger displacements) of the V8s from Chrysler, Holden and Ford. It was hoped that the weight advantage would feed through into superior fuel economy and extended tyre life. Nevertheless, the car was a full-size car in Australian terms, for which class leading boot/trunk capacity was claimed. Leyland P76 with 44 gallon drum in the boot. Safety equipment preceded the forthcoming Australian Design Rules, and featured front discs as standard on all models, recessed door handles and full-length side intrusion reinforcements on all doors. Transmissions for the car were all bought in from Borg-Warner Australia who were already also supplying transmissions to Ford and Chrysler. Notwithstanding the advertising slogan (\\"Anything but average\\")Brisbane TV 1973 - Leyland P76 \\"Anything But Average\\" (Australia)http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/insidethecollection/2013/06/its-40-years- since-the-leyland-p76-car/ the P76's engineering followed conventional lines. It did offer a combination of features which were advanced in this category in Australia at the time: rack and pinion steering, power-assisted disc brakes, MacPherson strut front suspension, front hinged bonnet, glued-in windscreen and concealed windscreen wipers, as well as the familiar Australian-made Borg Warner gearboxes (including 3 speed column shift) and a live rear axle. Particular attention was paid to structural rigidity, a British Leyland engineering strength. This goal was aided by a conscious effort to reduce the number of panels needed to build the car's body -- a remarkably low 215, reportedly only 5 more than for a Mini. At the time P76 production ceased, Leyland was developing a V6 version to replace the E6 variant. The V6 was derived from the 4.4-litre P76 V8, with the two rear cylinders chopped off. Performance in the marketplace Despite the V8 model winning Wheels magazine's Car of the Year for 1973, sales of the P76 were adversely affected by a variety of issues: component manufacturers' strikes limiting parts availability, production problems at Leyland Australia's plant in Zetland all restricted supply of the car; the release of P76 coincided with the first Oil Crisis, when fuel prices increased dramatically. As a result, demand for all larger cars subsided. Hence, notwithstanding generally favourable press and public reaction to the car, sales did not reach expectations. British Leyland announced plans to sell P76 in the UK. However, production ceased before these plans could come to fruition. Leyland P76 Targa Florio The car achieved success in the 1974 World Cup Rally- winning the Targa Florio section and placing 13th overall. Leyland Australia celebrated this victory by releasing a limited edition Targa Florio model: the V8 Super with Limited slip Diff, sports wheels and steering wheel, as well as special paintwork, including side stripes. Gerry Crown and Matt Bryson won the Classic Category of the 2013 Peking to Paris Endurance Rally in their Leyland P76 with a time of 237:30:10 Gerry Crown and Matt Bryson also finished Second on the 2015 Road to Mandalay classic car rally, winning the Malaysian Cup for being the fastest car. Unreleased P76 derivatives Leyland Force 7 Leyland Force 7 Leyland P76 wagon prototype Although development had started much earlier - the Force 7 coup√© was announced in 1974 but eventually only 10 pre-production coup√©s survived. By the time of the factory closure in 1974, one Force 7 was already in England for secret testing, Leyland Australia kept one example and finally donated that coup√© to an Australian museum with some other components of the P76 production line and the remaining eight coup√©s were offered for sale to private buyers in an auction after the factory had closed. The handbooks had even been printed and were offered for mail order sale by the auctioneers. There was to have been a base six-cylinder Force 7, a more powerful Force 7V with the V8 unit, and a range-topping Tour de Force. All the surviving cars are the \\"mid\\" range Force 7V. It was unusual in that it had full seating for five adults and a large rear hatchback, the first of its kind produced in Australia. It shared few body panels with the sedan. At the time of launch, the company announced the intention of introducing a station wagon/estate version later that same year, and at least three, prototype station wagons (estate cars), which shared much of the sedan's structure and body panels but with more upright rear door frames, were built: one was broken up by Leyland Australia for examination of the body strength, one was crash tested by Ford Australia for Leyland to gain part of the registration certification and the last and only surviving example was eventually used as a factory hack until it was sold at the same auction as the Force 7s as part of a pair of cars which included the last car made. The wagon and the \\"last\\" car remain in private collections and the wagon is currently undergoing basic restoration. All of the coup√©s sold at auction did not have registration compliance plates fitted to them as final registration testing and approval had not been completed on either station wagon or coupe bodies. Currently - in 2018 all 10 coup√©s and the single wagon survive. New Zealand and the end of the line The Leyland plant at Zetland closed in October 1974, and production of the P76 ceased, although CKD (completely-knocked-down) assembly continued in Petone, New Zealand, in exchange for NZ-assembled Rover P6s that were shipped to Australia. In New Zealand the P76 was successfully sold in V8 form only in Deluxe, Super and Executive forms all the way until August 1976. Other P76s were imported into NZ as complete cars. NZ-built P76s can be identified by a 'Z' stamped onto the chassis plate immediately after the 076 model designation - i.e. 076Z. After production ended surplus stock spare V8s were sold off by local distributor NZ Motor Corporation and were popular as boat engines. Leyland Australia produced some 56 or more Force 7 coup√©s, the majority of these were crushed at the factory to enhance the value of the 8 that were auctioned off in 1975. Leyland Australia auctioned off the last eight Force 7 coup√© prototypes to the public; these all still exist and are owned and indeed regularly driven by their private owners. Another car, an Omega Navy one with white trim, was sent to Britain and was used by Lord Stokes for some time; this was later sold to a private collector, who in the last two years sold the car to a New Zealand collector, which is where it resides now. One is at the National Motor Museum, Birdwood in South Australia which is on permanent loan from Leyland Australia. A smaller medium-sized car, was also intended called the \\"P82\\". Styling for this car became a competition between Michelotti and Leyland Australia's own internal design department. In 1982 - claims were made in some motoring papers that Leyland in Britain had decided on Michelotti's version but at the time the ex-head of Leyland Australia's design department was unaware of such a decision. This car was intended to replace the Morris Marina in Australia but only one prototype car and styling mockups were ever produced. At least two experimental V6 engines were made, with one being based on a cut-down Rover V8 at about 2.6 L and another based on the actual P76 V8 motor at about 3.3 L. Concepted as a high volume/profit car ‚Äì the P82 was designed to have many body styles placed over the same basic structure and was intended to be offered in 4, V6 and V8 forms dependent on body style. After the Australian plant closed, the prototype car was reported to have been sent to Rover in Britain for examination before being destroyed. Just before the plant closure in 1974 and its subsequent takeover by the Australian military, Leyland Australia's styling department were still working on the P82 styling, and one single 1/5 scale clay model survives of the P82 in the sedan \\"short front and rear\\" variant. P76 today The P76 continues to have a loyal following of owners who have great enthusiasm for the car. There are at least seven P76 owners clubs in Australia and New Zealand. The New Zealand P76 Owners' Club was founded in 1983. After production of the P76 ceased, Leyland Australia limited its local production to the Mini and Mini Moke, both produced at Enfield, along with commercial vehicles and buses.

It is packaged with the Super NES Mouse peripheral. The game was developed by Nintendo Research & Development 1 and Intelligent Systems.  The program  According to the manual, two parts of Mario Paint are meant to familiarize the user with the SNES mouse: the title screen, where users can click on each of the logo text for \\"surprise[s]\\" to occur and a fly-swatting mini-game named Gnat Attack, where the player swats 100 insects before fighting a boss named King Watinga. The mini-game lasts three levels, and after they are completed, the game starts over with the enemies swarming in and attacking at faster speed. Content creation features of the program include a drawing board, \\"Animation Land,\\" a music composition feature, and a coloring book. Collages can be saved at a time in the program to be loaded at later usage of the software or recorded to VCR. In the coloring book, the user can color-in and edit four pre-made black-and-white drawings, including one featuring Yoshi and Mario, another featuring various animals, a greeting card, and a underwater scene. The \\"drawing board\\" feature is where original paintings can be created. A user can choose from 15 colors and 75 patterns. After choosing one of these colors or palettes, the user can draw with a pen (small, medium, or large) and airbrush; fill in a closed area the selected texture with the \\"paint brush\\" tool; and create perfectly- straight lines, rectangles, and circles that is the color or pattern (either fully colored-in, with just an outline, or with a spray-canned outline). Parts of a drawing can be copied, pasted, and moved to other areas, rotated vertically and horizontally, or erased via pens of six various sizes. An entire painting can also be erased via nine unique visual effects. Animation Land involves the use of these tools for creating multiple frames, and allows for the creation of four, six, and/or nine-frame animations; elements of one frame can be copied to others for smooth animations to be created. If a character is being animated, the animation box can be set on a background and move throughout it in a \\"path\\" recorded by using the mouse in the \\"path lever\\" feature. In the animation and drawing features, stamps can be added to each painting and frame, which 120 existing ones included in the software. There is a stamp editor that, via a large tile grid, allows the user can create new stamps or edit existing ones, with the same 15 colors for the drawing section usable in the stamp editor. Up to 15 user-made stamps can be saved to a \\"personal stamp database.\\" There are also text stamps, such as English, Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji characters, that can be added and changed in size and color. The music composition tool allows users to write pieces either in common time or triple time. There are 15 instruments samples to use that are notated with different icons, including eight melodic sounds (a piano represented by Mario's head, a bell sound indicated by a power star, a trumpet represented by a fire flower, a Gameboy sound represented by an icon of the handheld console, a horn section sample represented by a goose, a guitar sound symbolized by a jet, and an organ represented by a car), three percussion sounds (a bass drum displayed by a mushroom, a wooden block presented by a ship, and a bass pluck represented by a heart), and five sound effects of Yoshi's zip, a dog bark, a cat meow, a pig oink, and a baby hiccup. The icons are added to a treble clef, and notes that can be added are limited to a range from the B below middle C to high G. Additionally, since no flats or sharps can be added, pieces are restricted to notes of the C Major/A Minor scale. Other limitations include composing only in quarter notes, a maximum number of three notes on a beat, and a maximum number of measures a song can last (for 4/4 songs, it's 24 bars, and for 3/4 songs, it's 32). Pieces made in the composition tool can be played in the animation and coloring booking modes. Reception  Contemporaneous  Mario Paints possible age appeal and amount of features were discussed in reviews. While Nintendo Power and GamePro suggested that it had enough features and interactive elements to fascinate a person of any age with \\"even a remote interest\\" in artistic ventures, other reviews, even from critics who enjoyed the program, suggested the program's limitations made its novelty wear thin to those past its young target demographic and made its high price tag unjustifiable. Total!s Steve 'Misery argued that the limitations were inexcusable for a title on a console that can have 250 colors on a screen at a time, stereo audio, and have a ton of graphics change in a instant. Additionally, he was annoyed that the program \\"goes completely overboard in one area, and then misses others out completely,\\" such as the lack of a zoom feature despite there being eight flashy ways to erase a painting. Cons with the program brought up in reviews include long saving times, \\"impossible\\" fine-detailing, and the fact that only collage can be saved at a time. Mario Paint was honored by the Parents' Choice Award, a non-profit organization recognizing children's educational entertainment.  Retrospective  Mario Paint is one of the Super NES's best selling games at 2.3 million copies. Calling Mario Paint \\"perhaps the most ingenious and inspired idea Nintendo ever came up with for a product\\", AllGame rated it 5 out of 5 stars. Honest Gamers stated, \\"It has very little flaws, if any, is very addictive, and even a child can use it. The games never get old and none of it ever gets tedious. It is one of the best games for the SNES.\\" Josh Despain of Defunct Games, however, opined that while it was a \\"bold and unconventional move\\" for Nintendo to release a Mario product that wasn't a game, thus being a \\"unique piece of video game history,\\" it's was nothing more than just another \\"simplistic\\" paint program, only with a Mario theme. In 2006, it was rated the 162nd best game made on a Nintendo system in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list.. In 2014, IGN ranked it as the 105th best Nintendo game in its list of \\"The Top 125 Nintendo Games of All Time\\". IGN editor Peer Schneider cited the game's \\"smart and playful interface\\" as a \\"game changer\\" and commented that \\"It effectively erased the barriers between creating and playing, making it one of the most memorable and unique games to ever be released on a console.\\" US Gamer calls Mario Paint \\"an era-appropriate solution to graphics programs on expensive PCs\\" which is \\"at least somewhat responsible for our modern era of 2D indie throwback games\\". It says, \\"Every single element ... is engineered to make the act of creation fun in and of itself, even if you're just aimlessly doodling.\\" Legacy Mouse and pad that was packaged with the game. =In video games= Prominent video game developers have cited Mario Paint as an inspiration. Masahito Hatakeyama, one of the designers of 2009's WarioWare D.I.Y. for Nintendo DS, cites Mario Paints drawing and music creation tools as inspiration for the drawing and music creation tools in D.I.Y., while several staff members of the development team cited it as the game that taught them the joy of developing video games. WarioWare D.I.Y. allows players to record notes via the DS microphone, and apply noises and animals sounds to them, similar to Mario Paint's music creation. WarioWare D.I.Y. uses a paint program based upon the idea of Mario Paint when the player makes a comic or graphics for their custom microgame. When \\"Mario Paint\\" is entered as the name for a microgame or comic, the Mario Paint theme will play. Some of Mario Paints sound effects and musical instruments appear in this game. Another counterpart appears in 2004's WarioWare: Touched! as Wario Paint, allowing the player to use the Nintendo DS stylus to color various characters in the game. \\"Totaka's Song\\" can be played with the toy Turntable in the Toy Room. The fly-swatting game makes an additional appearance in the preceding game, WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$. The Wii Photo Channel features editing functionality similar to Mario Paint, and includes several of the special erasers. Takashi Tezuka, producer of Super Mario Maker for Wii U, stated that he \\"was inspired to bring the fun of Mario Paint into this course editor to make something fun and creative for people to enjoy\\". It includes the interactive title screen Easter eggs and the fly swatting minigame. US Gamer called Mario Paint an essential part of \\"the road to Super Mario Maker\\". A member of the sound staff of Mario Paint, Hirokazu Tanaka, later worked on EarthBound, where some of Mario Paints sound effects and instrument patches appear. A remixed Mario Paint song medley can be played in the Miiverse stage in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. =In movies= The first episode of Homestar Runner in 1996 was animated using Mario Paint. A primitive introduction video made with Mario Paint can be found in the museum of the site. A later short in the series, \\"Strong Bad is a Bad Guy\\", was made using Mario Paint. = Composer = Since the early 2010s, there has been an online culture of users on forums, Discord, and YouTube creating original songs and covers with not only Mario Paints composition feature but also programs replicating it, including Mario Paint Composer and Advanced Mario Composer. Mario Paint covers that have garnered coverage from the press included jeonghoon95's rendition of Daft Punk's \\"Get Lucky\\" a cover of Nicholas Britell's theme for the HBO series Succession (2018‚Äìpresent), and axelrod777's cover of the Bob-omb Battlefield level music of Super Mario 64 (1996). Successors A downloadable version was released in Japan via the Satellaview broadcast service in 1997. Titled , this version was modified to use a standard controller without the need of a mouse device. A sequel to Mario Paint was titled Mario Paint 64 in development, and then released in 1999 as the Japan-exclusive Mario Artist: Paint Studio launch game for the 64DD. Nintendo had commissioned the joint developer Software Creations, who described the game's original 1995 design idea as \\"a sequel to Mario Paint in 3D for the N64\\". Paint Studio has been described by IGN and Nintendo World Report respectively, as being Mario Paint \\"direct follow-up\\" and \\"spiritual successor\\". Likewise bundled with its system's mouse, Paint Studio includes minigames such as a fly swatting game reminiscent of that in Mario Paint.

Mesaoria Geography The Mesaoria is the name given to the broad tract of plain which extends across the island from the Bay of Famagusta in the east to that of Morphou in the west, which is a length of 96 km, with a breadth varying from 16 to 32 km. The streams which traverse it are mere winter torrents, which descend from the southern chain but scarcely reach the sea. The Pedias (Pediaeus) and lalias (Yialias, Idalias) lose most of their flood waters in the marshes about Salamis, near the Bay of Famagusta. The Pedias rises near Machaira and passes close to Nicosia, indeed flowed through it before the river was diverted by the Venetians. The lalias rises very near the source of the Pedias, passes through Nisou, Dali (the ancient Idalion) and Pyroi, and traverses the Mesaoria in a direction more or less parallel with the Pedias. A smaller but more constant streams is the Cares (Clarios), which flows from the slopes of Troodos into the Bay of Morphou. A Handbook of Cyprus, by Sir J. T. Hutchinson, London 1907, publ.Edward Stanford. Page 2 The Mesaoria plain is bounded on the east and west by the Mediterranean Sea, on the south by the Troodos mountains and on the north by the Kyrenia mountains (Pentadaktylos). It has an area of approximately 1000 km¬≤ (390 mi¬≤). It rises to an altitude of 325 m (1066 ft), with an average elevation of perhaps 100 m (330 ft). There are a number of rivers and other water courses crossing this plain, but none of them have water year round. The Alluvial Plains of the centre of the island are for the most part the product of successive rain-storms and floods which have brought down from the mountains immense quantities of light debris which has been spread over the lower lands, principally by human agency exerted in the system of colmatage, which has been practised from time immemorial. This has resulted in the general raising of the land surface and incidentally in the natural reclamation of many acres of land in the lower parts of the Mesaoria, which once were arms of the sea.Hutchinson. Page 3 The word \\"Mesaoria\\" (sometimes spelled \\"Mesarya\\"), means \\"between the mountains\\" in Greek. For the most part, the Mesaoria is a flat, bare plain, with few trees except for those planted as windbreaks. It is the agricultural heartland of Cyprus, but it depends completely on winter rainfall and irrigation for its water, which limits production. It is also the most settled region on the island, containing dozens of villages and many of the largest towns, including the capital, Nicosia. Due to deforestation, much of the Mesaoria is covered with \\"Kafkalla\\", which is a local term referring to calcium carbonate that has been compacted into a hardpan. The only plants that grow well on this surface are quickly eaten by grazing animals, which has greatly exacerbated soil erosion. The plain which has a subtropical semi-arid climate, can be uncomfortably hot in the summer, with temperatures of 40¬∞C being common. The rainfall on the plain is significantly lower than in the mountains, but in recent years a number of dams and irrigation systems have been constructed to capture the mountain runoff. History Twenty million years ago Cyprus was actually two islands, which were the predecessors of the Kyrenia and Troodos mountain ranges. Approximately one million years ago, the Mesaoria plain arose, resulting in the current island of Cyprus. At various times, changing levels of the Mediterranean sea covered and exposed the plain; it has been in its present form since the end of the Pleistocene. The Mesaoria plain shows evidence of cultivation dating from the neolithic. In classical times the entire center of the island was covered by dense forests. Most of these were cut down in the middle of the 1st century BC to provide wood for the Ptolemaic navy. Additionally, much wood was harvested to provide energy for the extraction of copper. However, as recently as the late sixteenth century there were still significant stands of trees on the plain. Today, the only remaining forested areas are on the surrounding mountains, particularly the Troodos range. As evidenced by a papal document in 1196, the eastern region of Mesaoria had become settled with a dense network of villages by the 12th century. The plain served as the island's prime agricultural region. A single line of railway of 2 ft 6in gauge was constructed the full length of the plain, from Famagusta to Nicosia (36 miles) and then to Karavostasi, on the Bay of Morphou (a further 34 miles). Work was begun in 1904 and Nicosia the capital was connected on 21 October 1905.Hutchinson. Page 93 The line was closed in 1951.Cyprus Narrow Gauge. By Hugh Ballantyne (2007). Middleton Press.

It has a straight trunk with rough, fibrous to stringy bark on the lower half of the trunk, smooth white bark above, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and fifteen, white flowers and barrel-shaped or hemispherical fruit.flower budsfruitbark Description Eucalyptus delegatensis is a tree that typically grows to a height of , sometimes to , and forms a lignotuber. The bark is rough, grey to black, fibrous or stringy on the lower half of the trunk, smooth white to greyish above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, the same glossy green to bluish green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in groups of between seven and fifteen in leaf axils on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on a pedicel long. Mature buds are oval to club-shaped, green to yellow or red, long and wide with a conical or rounded operculum with a small point on the tip. Flowering occurs between December and March and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped to hemispherical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level or enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus delegatensis was first formally described in 1900 by Richard Thomas Baker from a specimen collected by William Baeuerlen, (previously known as Wilhelm B√§uerlen) on \\"Delegate Mountain\\". The description was published in Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales. The specific epithet (delegatensis) refers to the type location. In 1985 Douglas John Boland described two subspecies and the names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus delegatensis R.T.Baker subsp. delegatensis that has broadly lance-shaped juvenile leaves and is found in New South Wales and Victoria; * Eucalyptus delegatensis subsp. tasmaniensis Boland that has more or less round juvenile leaves with a short \\"drip-tip\\" and only grows in Tasmania. Distribution and habitat Alpine ash is widespread and often dominant in grassy or wet subalpine forest, in deep fertile soil, often on slopes, and commonly forms pure stands. In New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory it is found south from the Brindabella Range and in Victoria it occurs at altitudes between east of Mount Macedon. Subspecies tasmaniensis is endemic to Tasmania.

On August 24, 2010, Cassidy released the 5-track EP Face 2 Face, with the promotional single \\"Face 2 Face\\". On November 16, 2010, Cassidy's fourth studio album, C.A.S.H. (Cass A Straight Hustla) was released. On its first week it had sold about 5,200 copies, much lower than his previous studio albums. \\"Drumma Bass\\" was the only official single from the album. 2012‚Äìpresent: Mr. Hip-Hop and Da Science On May 21, 2012, Cassidy hosted a release party for his mixtape Mayhem Music. On July 8, 2012, he released the mixtape Mayhem Music: AP3. After fellow Philly rapper Meek Mill said he would battle Cassidy, which Cassidy later said he would accept if the money was right. They participated in a \\"twitter beef\\" after which Cassidy released \\"The Diary of a Hustla\\" which was originally thought to be a diss towards Meek. This was later refuted by Cassidy. They both were asking for $100,000 each for the battle to take place. However, after Meek Mill dissed Cassidy's song \\"Condom Style\\" (a remake of Psy's \\"Gangnam Style\\") Cassidy released a song titled \\"Me, Myself & iPhone\\" where he took shots at Meek Mill. Afterwards, Meek Mill responded with the diss track \\"Repo\\" which Mill later said would be the final diss record he would release against Cassidy. Cassidy later said the feud was not personal, saying it was all in the spirit of hip hop. On January 6, 2013 Cassidy released a 10-minute-long diss response titled \\"Raid\\". On October 6th, Cassidy released his album Da Science. Other ventures In 2007, Cassidy signed a deal as the \\"new face\\" for Lot 29's fall clothing line. In 2009, Cassidy appeared in the comedy film, Next Day Air. In late 2012, Cassidy remade South Korean singer Psy's international hit single \\"Gangnam Style, re-titling it \\"Condom Style\\". The remake reportedly earned Cassidy an endorsement deal with Trojan. In 2013, Cassidy released a biography titled Behind B.A.R.S: The Authorized Biography of Cassidy. In late 2014, Cassidy returned to battle rap by battling Los Angeles-based veteran Dizaster, on December 6, 2014 at Filmon.com's \\"Ether\\" event. Personal life Murder case On April 15, 2005 three men, including Cassidy, armed with .45, .40 and 9mm caliber pistols, and an AK-47 assault rifle, fired on three unarmed men during an argument that occurred in the West Oak Lane neighborhood in Northwest Philadelphia. Desmond Hawkins was killed by a shot in the back. Hawkins' two other friends were treated at hospitals for gunshot wounds and released. On June 9, a warrant was issued for Cassidy's arrest on charges of murder, attempted murder, reckless endangerment, aggravated assault, conspiracy and weapons possession. Cassidy surrendered to Philadelphia police on the afternoon of June 17. At his arraignment on Saturday, June 18, he was denied bail, and sent to Philadelphia's Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility, a high-security prison, where he would serve his time during the trial and after he was sentenced. Cassidy's murder case took a turn when the primary witness withdrew his confession. This resulted in the judge stating that Cassidy would stand trial for third-degree murder. On August 16, 2005, Municipal Judge Marsha Neifield ruled that prosecutors had sufficient evidence to charge Cassidy with third-degree murder, attempted murder and weapons offenses. This was later overturned to the original, first degree charge - negating the possibility of parole. On January 25, 2006 Cassidy was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, two counts of aggravated assault and possession of an instrument of crime for his involvement in the shooting. He was sentenced to 11 to 23 months in prison plus probation and was credited with the 7 months he had already served. Cassidy was released from Pennsylvania's Curran- Fromhold Correctional Facility on March 2, 2006 after serving eight months.Murder Case Cassidy talks about his arrest and time in prison in the 2011 film Rhyme and Punishment, which documents various hip-hop artists who have done county jail or state/federal prison time.

Schieffer is the founder and President of Envoy International, a consulting firm that provides a wide range of services to clients with international interest.http://texascentral.com/the-project/#the-team Schieffer is also a keynote speaker on international issues, trade, the global economy, leadership, and organizational management. Schieffer is a friend and former business partner of President George W. Bush. He is the younger brother of Bob Schieffer, a former CBS News reporter and host of Face the Nation. Schieffer and his wife, Susanne, reside in Fort Worth, Texas. Early life and education John Thomas (Tom) Schieffer was born in Fort Worth, the youngest child of the late John E. Schieffer and the former Gladys Payne, both originally from Austin. His father was the managing partner of a construction company. His mother stayed home to rear the children. In addition to his brother, Bob, Schieffer has a sister, Sharon Schieffer Mayes, who became a high school principal at Keller High School at a time when only two percent of the principals in Texas' largest high schools were women. She also had a successful career as an administrator in the Keller Independent School District. Schieffer grew up in Fort Worth attending public schools and graduated from Arlington Heights High School in 1966. He attended the University of Texas at Austin, receiving a B.A. degree in 1970 in government and earned a master's degree in international relations in 1972. His master's thesis was entitled, \\"An Examination of the Nuclear Weapons Debate in India\\". The thesis correctly predicted that India would explode a nuclear device in 1974 and pursue the acquisition of nuclear weapons as the result of the security threat presented by China. Early political career While in college, Schieffer worked in the offices of State Senator Don Kennard and Governor John Connally. Schieffer ran in the 1972 Democratic primary against incumbent Speaker Pro-Tem Tommy Shannon, who was involved in the statewide Sharpstown scandal. After leading the primary and winning the run-off, Schieffer was nominated by Democrats to run at age 24. He won the general election that fall, winning county wide with more than 60% of the vote while Democratic Presidential candidate George McGovern received just over 30% in the state. Sworn in at age 25, Schieffer was one of the youngest members of the class of 1972. The first piece of legislation Schieffer passed was a bill renaming the State Finance Building the Lyndon B. Johnson State Office Building. Johnson, whom Schieffer admired greatly for passing the landmark civil rights bills of 1964, 1965 and 1968, had died in January 1973. During his first session, Schieffer successfully argued for funding the Fort Worth State School - a mental health facility - receiving the editorial kudos of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram for having \\"earned his spurs\\" as an effective legislator in Austin. Re-elected with over 60% of the vote in the 1974 general election (he had no opposition in the Democratic primary), Schieffer was named Chairman of the Local and Consent Calendars Committee in his second term, a position he retained in his third term as well. Schieffer was the lead author on the bill that established the first Presidential primary in Texas. He was also the lead author on the bill that restricted the catch of redfish along the Texas coast, a measure that conservationists and wildlife enthusiasts had sought for years. Schieffer also co-authored legislation that closed a loophole on child care facilities that wanted to operate without meeting state standards. The first two terms Schieffer was in the legislature, Tarrant County state representatives were elected countywide. After the Legislature passed a single member district plan, he was elected to a third term from a single member district. In January 1978, a federal court overturned the existing single member district plan and redrew the lines. Schieffer, who retained only one precinct out of his old district, carried every precinct in the Democratic primary but narrowly lost his seat to Republican Bob Ware in the general election. Schieffer remained active in Democratic Party politics, supporting candidates like Senator Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., Governor Mark White, and Congressman Pete Geren. Legal career After losing his legislative seat, Schieffer returned to course work at The University of Texas law school. At the time, Texas law allowed legislators who had served three terms to take the State Bar exam a year early if they had taken two years of course work at an accredited law school. Schieffer completed his two years and passed the state bar exam. He was admitted to the practice of law on October 31, 1979, and became a corporate lawyer in Fort Worth, specializing in the oil and gas industry. Civic and board experiences In civic matters, Schieffer was appointed a Trustee of the Tarrant County Junior College (now Tarrant County College) and was elected to a full term without opposition. Schieffer served as a board member of the Texas Commerce Bank in Fort Worth and as an advisory board member to the bank when it was later acquired by JPMorgan Chase. In addition, Schieffer served on the board of Drew Industries, a New York Stock Exchange-listed company. Always interested in educational issues, Schieffer has served on the boards of the Winston School in Dallas, the Tarrant County Community College Foundation, the Dallas County Community College Foundation, and the Penrose Foundation, which provides college scholarships for Hispanic students. Schieffer also served on the Texas Rangers Foundation Board and was active with his wife Susanne in Habitat for Humanity, the Food Bank of Tarrant County, and the Dallas Can Academy. Schieffer currently serves on a number of national and International Boards. He is a member of the International High Speed Rail Association Board headquartered in Japan; the International Advisory Board of the Mansfield Foundation in Washington; the Council of American Ambassadors Board in Washington; the honorary board of the Japan America Society of Dallas-Fort Worth, and is an honorary counselor of the US- Japan Council. He was elected a member of the American Academy of Diplomacy in 2016. Texas Rangers baseball club Schieffer's success in his law practice and business career allowed him to join an investment group led by George W. Bush and Edward W. (Rusty) Rose that bought the Texas Rangers baseball club on April 21, 1989. Having begun as only an investor in the group, Bush and Rose asked Schieffer to be the Partner-In-Charge of Ballpark Development in July 1990. Schieffer toured ballparks around America and successfully negotiated a public-private partnership with the City of Arlington, which became a model for cooperation between cities and private entities in development projects. The Rangers and the City of Arlington announced a new stadium deal in October 1990. An election was held in January 1991, which sought the approval of Arlington voters. More people voted in that special election than had voted in the combined Democratic and Republican primaries the year before. The citizens of Arlington approved the agreement by a 65% - 35% margin. The turnout remains the largest in Arlington's history for a special election. The Ballpark in Arlington was opened in 1994 on time and on budget. It received rave reviews from fans inside and outside of Arlington. After passage of the referendum in January 1991, Schieffer was named President of the Rangers and served in that position longer than any other individual has. When George W. Bush became governor in 1995, Schieffer was named to succeed Bush as the team's Co- Managing General Partner along with Rusty Rose. The franchise won its first division title in 1996. They won the division again in 1998 and 1999. The Bush-Rose partnership sold the franchise in 1998 to Dallas investor Tom Hicks. Under the terms of the sale, Schieffer was required to stay as President of the Club for an additional year. Schieffer resigned as President of the Rangers in April 1999. While Schieffer was President of the Rangers, he also served as President of the J. Thomas Schieffer Management Company and the Pablo Operating Company, two entities that managed investments and oil and gas properties for clients. On August 23, 2014, Schieffer was inducted into the Texas Rangers Hall of Fame for his contributions to the franchise.http://texas.rangers.mlb.com/news/article/tex/tom-schieffer-to-be- inducted-into-rangers-hall-of-fame?ymd=20140520&content;_id=76113102 Ambassador of the United States to Australia In April 2001, President Bush asked Schieffer to become the Ambassador of the United States to Australia. He accepted and presented his credentials in Canberra on August 23, 2001, as the 22nd representative of the U.S. president. His two immediate predecessors had been Directors-General of the U.S. Foreign Service, although it has been noted that Australian governments sometimes value a U.S. Ambassador's personal links to the President currently in office. Returning to America to attend the first summit between Prime Minister John Howard and President Bush on September 10, 2001, Schieffer was in Washington on September 11, 2001, when the September 11 attacks occurred. Returning to Australia on September 12 with the Prime Minister on board Air Force Two, Schieffer and the White House worked with the Prime Minister and the Australian government to invoke the ANZUS treaty for the first time in its 50-year history so that Australia could come to the aid of the United States as a result of the terrorists' attack. Subsequently, Schieffer attended five more war time summits with the President and Australian Prime Minister in the next three and a half years as Australia helped America in Afghanistan and Iraq. During his tenure in Canberra, he coordinated closely with the Government of Australia on efforts to fight global terrorism and helped to deepen cooperation on rebuilding efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. During Schieffer's tenure in Australia, the United States also negotiated a free-trade agreement with Australia and significantly deepened the intelligence ties between the two countries. In his report to the State Department, the Inspector General said that Schieffer had exhibited extraordinary leadership and organizational skills in leading the American Embassy in Canberra. The Inspector General said he had examined 83 embassies around the world and had found none that would compare. Later, the State Department recognized the business plan for the Embassy organized by Schieffer as one of the three best in the world. After Bush's victory in the November 2004 presidential election, Schieffer announced that he would not be serving another term in Canberra. He returned to the United States at the end of 2004, although he did not formally resign as ambassador until April 1, 2005. Ambassador of the United States to Japan Based upon his work in Australia, then-Secretary of State Colin Powell and Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage recommended to President Bush that Ambassador Schieffer be moved to Japan to replace the retiring former Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker as ambassador. Schieffer became one of only three non-career appointees to serve in both the first and second terms of the Bush administration as an Ambassador. On April 1, 2005, Schieffer was sworn in as the 22nd Ambassador of the United States to Japan, having been confirmed by the United States Senate unanimously for the second time. During his tenure in Japan, Schieffer was again cited by the office of the Inspector General for an exemplary job of leading and managing the 1000-plus personnel embassy. He was also intimately involved in negotiating the most far-reaching reorganization of the U.S.-Japan alliance since the signing of the Security Agreement in 1960. The U.S.-Japan alliance has been and continues to be the linchpin of both countries' security in Asia and the Pacific. Under the terms of the new agreement, Japan agreed to provide billions of dollars in assistance to the United States to help modernize U.S. facilities in Japan. Schieffer was also instrumental in strengthening the intelligence ties between the two countries. Heavily involved in the six-party talks, which centered on North Korea's attempts to become a nuclear weapons state, Schieffer was also praised by both Japan and U.S. officials for diplomatic skills throughout the talks. Schieffer was praised by Japan and U.S. human rights groups for keeping the issue of the abduction of Japanese citizens by North Korean intelligence agents before negotiators. During his time in Japan, Schieffer attended five more summits with the U.S. President and three Japanese Prime Ministers including the 2008 G-8 Summit in Hokkaido. He departed this post on January 20, 2009. Honors In November 2013, the Emperor of Japan awarded Schieffer the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun,http://www.us.emb- japan.go.jp/english/html/pressreleases/2013/order-of-the-rising- sun-2013-schieffer.html the highest honor that can be bestowed on a foreigner to recognize his significant contributions in promoting friendly relations and understanding between the United States and Japan. Schieffer was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia, the highest award that can be presented to a foreigner by the Australian government, for his work in strengthening the Australian American Alliance. After ending his almost eight year diplomatic career, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates awarded Schieffer the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service, the highest civilian award The Pentagon has to offer, for his work in strengthening the US - Japan Alliance. The Federal Bureau of Investigation honored him for his efforts to combat the international scourge of child pornography. The Director of National Intelligence awarded him the National Intelligence Reform Medal. The Central Intelligence Agency presented him with the Donovan Award. The Defense Intelligence Agency presented him with the Director's Award Medal. The National Security Agency presented him the Director's Distinguished Service Medal. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency presented him its Medallion for Excellence. All of the medals and awards presented to Schieffer by members of the intelligence community were for his work in strengthening and reforming the intelligence cooperation between the United States and Australia, and the United States and Japan. Family Schieffer is married to Susanne Silber Schieffer, who is originally from San Antonio. She is a graduate of The University of Texas at Austin. She was the Director of a small state agency before they were married. Afterward, she was Director of Project Business for Junior Achievement in Fort Worth, a non-profit organization, committed to fostering free-enterprise principles in young people. With the birth of their son Paul, she chose to remain at home. Paul Schieffer graduated in 2007 from St. John's College in Annapolis, Maryland, and is presently pursuing a career as a sound consultant. Paul and his wife, Ali, reside in Spain. Gubernatorial candidacy On March 2, 2009, Tom Schieffer announced that he was forming an exploratory committee to consider seeking the Democratic nomination for Governor of Texas in 2010. In June, Schieffer formally announced his candidacy. His campaign stressed the importance of improving education in a fast, globalizing world to enhance the future competitiveness of Texas. Despite raising over $1 million for his campaign, Schieffer withdrew from the race on November 23, 2009, citing an inability to raise enough cash to fund an effective campaign. He urged Houston Mayor Bill White to enter the race instead. White announced his candidacy for governor on December 4, 2009. He would win the Democratic nomination but lose the general election to incumbent Rick Perry. Los Angeles Dodgers On April 25, 2011, Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig, who had taken over operations of the struggling Los Angeles Dodgers franchise, announced that he was appointing Schieffer to monitor the club's business and financial operations. Schieffer's oversight of the franchise ended when the Dodgers filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on June 27, 2011.Bankruptcy forces monitors out of Dodger Stadium See also *List of United States political appointments that crossed party lines References Sources *Tom Schieffer for Governor *Department of State *Source Watch *Embassy Row *Council of American Ambassadors *Australian Politics.com * 1947 births Living people People from Fort Worth, Texas University of Texas at Austin College of Liberal Arts alumni Japan‚ÄìUnited States relations Ambassadors of the United States to Australia Ambassadors of the United States to Japan Foreign relations of Japan Texas Democrats Texas Rangers executives Major League Baseball team presidents Major League Baseball executives Members of the Texas House of Representatives Honorary Officers of the Order of Australia Grand Cordons of the Order of the Rising Sun Los Angeles Dodgers executives ","title":"Tom Schieffer"},{"id":"705396","text":"Dongola ( '), also spelled Dunqulah, is the capital of the state of Northern Sudan, on the banks of the Nile, and a former Latin Catholic bishopric (14th century). It should not be confused with Old Dongola, an ancient city located 80 km upstream on the opposite bank.  Etymology  The word Dongola comes from the Nubian word \\"Do√±qal\\" which means red brick, as most buildings were made of bricks, thus provoking one of ancient Nubia's biggest industries. A more modern use of the word is to describe a strong and hard bulwark, that being so Dongola is often called \\"the Resident of a large Nile castle\\". When Khedive Ismail Pasha made it the center of his army during the invasion of Sudan in 1821https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ismail-Pasha, Dongola was a ‚Äúshou√±a‚Äù, meaning a center in which taxes and tithe money represented in the crops, grains, and beasts were collected before being sent to the Sultan of Funj in Sennar who ruled the region. He called it \\"Aorita\\", which is a Turkish-Egyptian military term that means the military division or the headquarters of the military division, and the people misrepresented the word to \\"Al-Urdy\\" and then finally to \\"Al-Ardi\\", which became a title for Dongola.  History  Dongola was a province of Upper Nubia on both sides of the Nile, and the city was a centre for Nubian civilization, as manifested by its many archaeological remains from the Makurian and Islamic periods. Dongolawis originate from early indigenous Nubian Sub Saharan African inhabitants with many taking pride in their mostly non mixed ancestry; although always faced with criticism this helped preserve the Nilo Saharan Dongolawi Nubian language (known as Rutana ), however, cultural preferences are slowly changing. The remains of the revered Baqt Treaty are to be found in Dongola. The province of Dongola was part of the Makuria kingdom, which later became part of Egypt after Muhammad Ali Pasha ordered the invasion and occupation of Sudan in 1820; after which it was designated as a seat of a pasha. Its first governor was Abidin Bey. Modern Dongola was established in early 1812 after Nubian Mamluks escaped massacres envisioned Muhammed Ali Pasha. In 1821 however, Muhammad Ali's forces, led by his son Ismail Pasha, successfully conquered Dongola where he set up an army base named Al-A'oritah , thus forcing Mamluks and the indigenous to move to Shendi Map showing the British advance upon Dongola Dongola was the scene of a victory by General Herbert Kitchener over the indigenous Mahdist Muslim tribes in 1899 who later turned it into a british- egyptian army base with the objective of collecting and storing weapons, gear and resources. Dongola was a considered an all time base for sending campaign reports to Britain, and the first English press release was issued in the name of Dongola Star, with news of the British-Egyptian army in Sudan. Kitcheners forces have been known for extreme brutality, killing over 15,000 in the Battle of Omdurman before conquering Dongola, and later on proceeded killing the wounded, raising the overall death toll to over 50,000. Dongola Road and Dongola Avenue in the Bishopston area of Bristol were named after this event; as was Dongola Road in Tottenham, North London which runs next to Kitchener Road. There is also a Dongola Road in Jersey (Channel Islands). Dongola, Illinois, in the United States, was established in the 1850s, and named for Dongola.  Ecclesiastical history  Dongola Market The Latin Catholic Diocese of Dongola was established in 1330 and suppressed in 1350.

As the lead tank maneuvered to pass by the man, he repeatedly shifted his position in order to obstruct the tank's attempted path around him. The incident was filmed and smuggled out to a worldwide audience. Internationally, it is considered one of the most iconic images of all time.Pitts, Joe. \\"Tiananmen Anniversary\\" Inside China, the image and the accompanying events are subject to heavy state censorship. There is no reliable information about the identity or fate of the man; the story of what happened to the tank crew is also unknown. At least one witness has stated that \\"Tank Man\\" was not the only person who had opposed the tanks during the protest. Shao Jiang, who was a student leader, said: \\"I witnessed a lot of the people standing up, blocking the tanks.\\" Those interviewed include photographer Stuart Franklin with Magnum for TIME, who was on the 5th floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel. Tank Man is unique in that he is the only one who was photographed and recorded on video. The Incident The incident took place at the northeast edge of Tiananmen Square, along Chang'an Avenue, shortly after noon on June 5, 1989, the day after the Chinese government's violent crackdown on the Tiananmen protests. \\"Tank Man\\" stood in the middle of the wide avenue, directly in the path of a column of approaching Type 59 tanks. Stuart Franklin, who was on assignment for Time magazine, told the New York Times, \\"At some point, shots were fired and the tanks carried on down the road toward us, leaving Tiananmen Square behind, until blocked by a lone protester.\\" He wore a white shirt and black trousers, and he held two shopping bags. As the tanks came to a stop, the man gestured towards the tanks with one of the bags. In response, the lead tank attempted to drive around the man, but the man repeatedly stepped into the path of the tank in a show of nonviolent action. After repeatedly attempting to go around rather than crush the man, the lead tank stopped its engines, and the armored vehicles behind it seemed to follow suit. There was a short pause with the man and the tanks having reached a quiet, still impasse. Having successfully brought the column to a halt, the man climbed onto the hull of the buttoned-up lead tank and, after briefly stopping at the driver's hatch, appeared in video footage of the incident to call into various ports in the tank's turret. He then climbed atop the turret and seemed to have a short conversation with a crew member at the gunner's hatch. After ending the conversation, the man descended from the tank. The tank commander briefly emerged from his hatch, and the tanks restarted their engines, ready to continue on. At that point, the man, who was still standing within a meter or two from the side of the lead tank, leapt in front of the vehicle once again and quickly re-established the man‚Äìtank standoff. Video footage shows two figures in blue pulling the man away and disappearing with him into a nearby crowd; the tanks continued on their way. Eyewitnesses are unsure who pulled him aside. Charlie Cole, who was there for Newsweek, said it was the Chinese government PSB (the police), while Jan Wong, who was there for The Globe and Mail, thought that the men who pulled him away were concerned bystanders. In April 1998, Time included the \\"Unknown Rebel\\" in a feature titled \\"Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century\\". In November 2016, Time included the photograph by Jeff Widener in \\"Time 100: The Most Influential Images of All Time\\". Identity and fate Little is publicly known of the man's identity or that of the commander of the lead tank. Shortly after the incident, the British tabloid Sunday Express named him as \\"Wang Weilin\\" (), a 19-year-old student who was later charged with \\"political hooliganism\\" and \\"attempting to subvert members of the People's Liberation Army.\\" However, this claim has been rejected by internal Communist Party of China documents, which reported that they could not find the man, according to the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights. One party member was quoted as saying, \\"We can't find him. We got his name from journalists. We have checked through computers but can't find him among the dead or among those in prison.\\" Numerous theories have sprung up as to the man's identity and current whereabouts. There are several conflicting stories about what happened to him after the demonstration. In a speech to the President's Club in 1999, Bruce Herschensohn, former deputy special assistant to President Richard Nixon, alleged that he was executed 14 days later; other sources alleged he was executed by firing squad a few months after the Tiananmen Square protests. In Red China Blues: My Long March from Mao to Now, Jan Wong writes that she believes from her interactions with the government press that they have \\"no idea who he was either\\" and that he is still alive somewhere on the mainland. Another theory is that he escaped to Taiwan and remains employed there as an archaeologist in the National Palace Museum. This was first reported by the Yonhap news agency in South Korea. The Chinese government has made few statements about the incident or the people involved. In a 1990 interview with Barbara Walters, then-CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin was asked what became of the man. Jiang first stated (through an interpreter), \\"I can't confirm whether this young man you mentioned was arrested or not,\\" and then replied in English, \\"I think never killed\\". The government also argued that the incident evidenced the \\"humanity\\" of the country's military. In a 2000 interview with Mike Wallace, Zemin said, \\"He was never arrested.\\" He then stated, \\"I don't know where he is now.\\" He also emphasized that the tank stopped and did not run the young man over. International notability and censorship alt=A wide street blocked off by white guardrails with a large tree at the left in front of it and part of a brick building on the right in the rear. At the extreme left is an intersection with traffic lights A PBS interview of six experts noted that the memory of the Tiananmen Square protests appears to have faded in China, especially among younger Chinese people, due to government censorship. Images of the protest on the Internet have been censored in China. When undergraduate students at Peking University, which was at the center of the incident, were shown copies of the iconic photograph 16 years afterwards, they were \\"genuinely mystified\\". One of the students said that the image was \\"artwork\\". It is noted in the documentary Frontline: The Tank Man that he whispered to the student next to him \\"89\\". It has been suggested that the \\"Unknown Rebel\\", if still alive, would have never made himself known as he may have been unaware of his international recognition due to the Chinese media suppression of events relating to the government protests. At and after the events in the square, the PSB treated members of the international press roughly, confiscating and destroying all the film they could find, and forced the signing of confessions to offences such as photography during martial law, punishable by long imprisonment. Photographic versions Five photographers (one of whom did not share his material for 20 years) managed to capture the event on film that was later confiscated by the PSB. On June 4, 2009, the fifth photographer released an image of the scene taken from ground level. The widest coverage of the event and one of the best-known photographs of the event appearing in both Time and Life magazines, was documented by Stuart Franklin. He was on the same balcony as Charlie Cole, and his roll of film was smuggled out of the country by a French student, concealed in a box of tea. The most-used photograph of the event was taken by Jeff Widener of the Associated Press, from a sixth-floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel, about away from the scene. The image was taken using a Nikon FE2 camera through a Nikkor 400mm 5.6 ED-IF lens and TC-301 teleconverter. Circumstances were against the photographer who recalled that the picture was almost not taken. Widener was injured, suffering from the flu and running out of film. A friend (by the name of Kirk) hastily obtained a roll of Fuji 100 ASA color negative film, allowing him to make the shot. Though he was concerned that his shots were no good, his image was syndicated to many newspapers around the world and was said to have appeared on the front page of all European papers. He was also nominated for the Pulitzer prize but did not win. Nevertheless, his photograph has widely been known as one of the most iconic photographs of all time. Wider shot by Stuart Franklin showing column of tanks approaching Tank Man, who is shown near the lower-left corner. Charlie Cole, working for Newsweek and on the same balcony as Stuart Franklin, hid his roll of film containing Tank Man in a Beijing Hotel toilet, sacrificing an unused roll of film and undeveloped images of wounded protesters after the PSB raided his room, destroyed the two aforementioned rolls of film and forced him to sign a confession to photography during martial law, an imprisonable offence. Cole was able to retrieve the roll and have it sent to Newsweek. He was awarded the 1990 World Press Photo of the Year and the picture was featured in Life \\"100 Photographs That Changed the World\\" in 2003. On June 4, 2009, in connection with the 20th anniversary of the protests, Associated Press reporter Terril Jones revealed a photo he had taken showing the Tank Man from ground level, a different angle from all of the other known photos of the Tank Man. Jones wrote that he was not aware of what he had captured until a month later when printing his photos. Arthur Tsang Hin Wah of Reuters took several shots from room 1111 of the Beijing Hotel, but only the shot of Tank Man climbing the tank was chosen. It was not until several hours later that the photo of the man standing in front of the tank was finally chosen. When the staff noticed Widener's work, they re-checked Tsang's negative to see if it was of the same moment as Widener's. On March 20, 2013, in an interview by the Hong Kong Press Photographers Association (HKPPA), Tsang told the story and added further detail. He told HKPPA that on the night of June 3, 1989, he was beaten by students while taking photos and was bleeding. A foreign photographer accompanying him suddenly said, \\"I am not gonna die for your country,\\" and left. Tsang returned to the hotel. When he decided to go out again, the public security stopped him, so he stayed in his room, stood next to the window and eventually witnessed the Tank Man and took several shots of the event. In addition to the photography, video footage of the scene was recorded and transmitted across the globe. Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) cameraman Willie Phua, CNN cameraman Jonathan Schaer and NBC cameraman Tony Wasserman appear to be the only television cameramen who captured the scene.Willie Phua on Australia Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) 7.30 Report. ABC. November 29, 1996. ABC correspondents Max Uechtritz and Peter Cave were the journalists reporting from the balcony. After seeing Chinese tanks crush vehicles and people on June 3, many journalists and photographers believed the protests had already reached their peak, causing many to leave the area before the \\"tank man\\" incident occurred.Photojournalist on Tiananmen Square tank standoff. CNN. May 19, 2001. Legacy Electro-industrial band Skinny Puppy recorded and released song \\"Tin Omen\\" as a reference to the protests. In late 1989, it was released on their album Rabies with lyrics noting \\"non-violent rebellion\\", \\"tanks arrive\\", \\"tell the world what's going on\\" and \\"keep the camera alive\\". The 1994 music video for \\"Refuse/Resist\\" by the thrash/death metal band Sepultura features brief footage of the Tank Man. The Tank Man is the subject of the song \\"The Tiananmen Man\\" (1996) by the American heavy metal band Nevermore. In the 1999 Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song \\"Stand and Be Counted\\", from the album Looking Forward, David Crosby sings of his gratitude to Tank Man, whose photograph he has had framed and mounted. In Tom Clancy's 2000 novel The Bear and the Dragon, the Chinese authorities are said to have apprehended and executed Tank Man, then billed his surviving family for the cost of the pistol round expended to shoot him in the back of the head. A similar scene is depicted in the music video for \\"Club Foot\\" (2004) by the English rock band Kasabian. A fictionalized version of the fates of both the Tank Man and a soldier in the tank is told in Lucy Kirkwood's 2013 play Chimerica, which premiered at the Almeida Theatre from May 20, 2013 to July 6, 2013. On June 4, 2013, Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblog, blocked terms whose English translations are \\"today\\", \\"tonight\\", \\"June 4\\", and \\"big yellow duck\\". If these were searched for, a message appeared stating that, in accordance with relevant laws, statutes, and policies, the results of the search could not be shown. The censorship occurred because a photoshopped version of Tank Man, in which rubber ducks replaced the tanks, had been circulating around Twitter‚Äîa reference to Florentijn Hofman's Rubber Duck sculpture, which at that time was floating in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour. In April 2019 Leica Camera released an advert depicting photographers in intense political climates, including 1989 China. The five minute short ends with a photographer shooting from a hotel window, the Tank Man image reflected in his lens, despite the fact that the original photograph was taken with a Nikon camera. Following censorship of the Leica brand on Sina Weibo, Leica revoked the advert and sought to distance themselves from it.

History Chinese-style minaret of the Great Mosque of Xi'an, one of China's oldest mosques. The Silk Road, which was a series of extensive inland trade routes that spread all over the Mediterranean to East Asia, was used since 1000 BC and continued to be used for millennia. During this large period of time, most of the traders were Muslim and moved towards the East. Not only did these traders bring their goods, they also carried with them their culture and beliefs to East Asia. Islam was one of the many religions that gradually began to spread across the Silk Road during the \\"7th to the 10th centuries through war, trade and diplomatic exchanges.\\"Dru C. Gladney wrote Tang dynasty The Huaisheng Mosque's construction is attributed to the Prophet Muhammad's second cousin, Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas. According to Chinese Muslims' traditional accounts, Islam was first introduced to China in 616‚Äì18 AD by the Sahaba (companions) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad: Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas, Sayid, Wahab ibn Abu Kabcha and another Sahaba.Dru C.

The introduction of Islam mainly happened through two routes: From the southeast following an established path to Canton and from the northwest through the Silk Road. Sa\`ad ibn Abi Waqqas, along with three Sahabas, namely Suhayla Abuarja, Uwais al- Qarani and Hassan ibn Thabit, returned to China from Arabia in 637 by the Yunan-Manipur-Chittagong route, then reached Arabia by sea.Maazars in China- www.aulia-e-hind.com/dargah/Intl/Chin Some sources date the introduction of Islam in China to 650 AD, the third sojourn of Sa\`d ibn Abi Waqqas, when he was sent as an official envoy to Emperor Gaozong during Caliph Uthman's reign.Abul-Fazl Ezzati, 1994, The Spread of Islam, Tehran: Ahlul Bayt World Assembly Publications, pp. 300,303, 333. Emperor Gaozong, the Tang emperor who is said to have received the envoy then ordered the construction of the Memorial mosque in Canton, the first mosque in the country, in memory of Muhammad. While modern secular historians tend to say that there is no evidence for WaqqƒÅs himself ever coming to China, they do believe that Muslim diplomats and merchants came to Tang China within a few decades from the beginning of the Muslim Era. Guang Ta minaret, Huaisheng Mosque, Guangzhou, China. According to tradition, the mosque was founded in 627. The minaret was built in the 10th century. Photograph by Felice Beato, April 1860. The early Tang dynasty had a cosmopolitan culture, with intensive contacts with Central Asia and significant communities of (originally non-Muslim) Central and Western Asian merchants resident in Chinese cities, which helped the introduction of Islam. The first major Muslim settlements in China consisted of Arab and Persian merchants, with comparatively well-established, even if somewhat segregated, mercantile Muslim communities existing in the port cities of Guangzhou, Quanzhou and Hangzhou on China's southeastern seaboard, as well as in the interior centers such as Chang'an, Kaifeng and Yangzhou during the Tang and especially Song eras. It is recorded in 758, Arab and Persian pirates who probably had their base in a port on the island of Hainan, sacked Guangzhou, causing some of the trade to divert to Northern Vietnam and the Chaozhou area, near the Fujian border. In the year 760 in Yangzhou, rebels killed foreigners, mostly Arab and Persian merchants targeted for their wealth, in the Yangzhou massacre. Similarly, around 879, rebels killed around 120,000‚Äì200,000 mostly Arab and Persian foreigners in Guanzhou in the Guangzhou massacre. It is believed that the profile of Muslims as traders led to the government ignoring Muslims in the 845 Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution, even though it virtually extinguished Zoroastrianism and Nestorian Christianity in China.Original from the University of CaliforniaOriginal from Princeton University In the year 751, the Abbasid empire defeated the Tang Dynasty at the Battle of Talas, marking the end of Tang westward expansion and resulted in Muslim control of Transoxiana for the next 400 years. Song dynasty Puhaddin Mausoleum complex in Yangzhou By the time of the Song dynasty, Muslims had come to play a major role in the import/export industry. The office of Director General of Shipping was consistently held by a Muslim during this period. In 1070, the Song emperor Shenzong invited 5,300 Muslim men from Bukhara, to settle in China in order to create a buffer zone between the Chinese and the Liao empire in the northeast. Later on these men were settled between the Sung capital of Kaifeng and Yenching (modern day Beijing). They were led by Prince Amir Sayyid \\"So-fei-er\\" (his Chinese name) who was called the \\"father\\" of the Muslim community in China. Prior to him Islam was named by the Tang and Song Chinese as Dashi fa (\\"law of the Arabs\\").; Tashi or Dashi is the Chinese rendering of Tazi‚Äîthe name the Persians used for the Arabs He renamed it to Huihui Jiao (\\"the Religion of the Huihui\\").Hagras reported that \\"In 1080, another group of more than 10,000 Arab men and women are said to have arrived in China on horsebacks to join Sofeier. These people settled in all provinces\\". Pu Shougeng, a Muslim foreign trader, stands out in his work to help the Yuan conquer Southern China, the last outpost of Song power.In 1276, Song loyalists launched a resistance to Mongol efforts to take over Fuzhou. The Yuanshih (Yuan dynasty official history) records that Pu Shougeng \\"abandoned the Song cause and rejected the emperor...by the end of the year, Quanzhou submitted to the Mongols.\\"In abandoning the Song cause, Pu Shougeng mobilized troops from the community of foreign residents,who massacred the Song emperor's relatives and Song loyalists.Pu Shougeng and his troops acted without the help of the Mongol army. Pu Shougeng himself was lavishly rewarded by the Mongols. He was appointed military commissioner for Fujian and Guangdong. =Tombs of Imam Asim and Mazaar of Zafar Sadiq= The tombs of Sa-Ke-Zu and Wu-Ko-Shun at Mount Lingshan, Quanzhou \\"On the foothills of Mount Lingshan are the tombs of two of the four companions that Prophet Muhammad sent eastwards to preach Islam. Known as the \\"Holy Tombs,\\" they house the companions Sa-Ke-Zu and Wu-Ko-Shun‚Äîtheir Chinese names, of course. The other two companions went to Guangzhou and Yangzhou.\\" The Imam Asim, also spelt Hashim, is said to have been one of the first Islamic missionaries in the region of China. He was a man of c.1000 CE in Hotan. The shrine site includes the reputed tomb of the Imam, a mosque, and several related tombs. There is also a mazaar of Imam Zafar Sadiq. Yuan dynasty Hamada Hagras in which he recorded \\"With China unified under Yuan dynasty, traders were free to traverse China freely. The Mongols aware of the impact of trade were keen to improve Chinese infrastructure to ensure the flow of goods. One major project was the repair and inauguration of Chinese Grand Canal that linked Khanbalik (Beijing) in the north with Hangzhou on the coast in the south‚Äêeast. Ningbo's location on the central coast and at the end of the Canal was the motive of the mercantile development of the east coast of China. The Grand Canal was an important station helped the spread of Islam in the cities of China's east coast; Muslim merchants travel to the north along the canal, which made the banks of the channel regions become key areas for the spread of Islam eastern China.\\" During the Mongol-founded Yuan dynasty (1271‚Äì1368), large numbers of Muslims settled in China. The Mongols, a minority in China, gave foreign immigrants, such as Christians, Muslims and Jews from West Asia an elevated status over the native Han Chinese as part of their governing strategy, thus giving Muslims a heavy influence. Mongols recruited and forcibly relocated hundreds of thousands of Muslim immigrants from Western and Central Asia to help them administer their rapidly expanding empire. The Mongols used Arab, Persian and Buddhist Uyghur administrators, generically known as semu [Ëâ≤ÁõÆ] (\\"various eye color\\") to act as officers of taxation and finance. Muslims headed many corporations in China in the early Yuan period. Muslim scholars were brought to work on calendar making and astronomy. The architect Yeheidie'erding (Amir al-Din) learned from Han architecture and helped to design the construction of the capital of the Yuan Dynasty, Dadu, otherwise known as Khanbaliq or Khanbaligh, the predecessor of present-day Beijing. The term Hui originated from the Mandarin \\"Huihui,\\" a term first used in the Yuan dynasty to describe Arab, Persian and Central Asian residents in China. Many of the Muslim traders and soldiers eventually settled down in China and married Chinese wives. This gave rise to the Hui Muslims, meaning Chinese-speaking Muslims. Jinan Great Southern Mosque was completed during the reign of Tem√ºr Khan, Emperor Chengzong of Yuan. At the same time the Mongols imported Central Asians to work as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to work as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara of Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands. The Yuan dynasty \\"Han people\\" classification included Koreans, Bohais, Jurchens and Khitans and they are included in statistics of intermarriage between Semu and \\"Han people\\". Semu and Han intermarried with Mongols. The Haluhu (ÂìàÂâåÈ≤Å) Semu married Koreans, Uighurs Tangwu, Mongols and Han during Yuan rule. Tibetan, Qincha, Uighur, Hui Hui and Han intermarried with Korean women during the Yuan dynasty. Korean women married Indian, Uyghur and Turkic Semu men. This intermarriage of Korean women and Semu men was extensive in China during the Yuan dynasty. A rich merchant from the Ma'bar Sultanate, Abu Ali (P'aehali) Â≠õÂìàÈáå (or Â∏ÉÂìàÁàæ, Buhaer), was associated closely with the Ma'bar royal family. After falling out with them, he moved to Yuan dynasty China and received a Korean woman as his wife and a job from the Mongol Emperor, the woman was formerly Ê°ëÂì• Sangha's wife and her father was Ëî°‰ªÅÊèÜ Ï±ÑÏÜ°ÎÖÑ Ch'ae In'gyu during the reign of Âø†ÁÉà Chungnyeol of Goryeo, recorded in the Dongguk Tonggam, Goryeosa and ÁïôÂ§¢ÁÇé Liu Mengyan's ‰∏≠‰ø∫ÈõÜ Zhong'anji.SEN, TANSEN. 2006. ‚ÄúThe Yuan Khanate and India: Cross-cultural Diplomacy in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries‚Äù. Asia Major 19 (1/2). Academia Sinica: 317. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41649921 . Genghis Khan and his successors forbade Islamic practices like halal butchering, as well as other restrictions. Muslims had to slaughter sheep in secret. Genghis Khan outright called Muslims and Jews \\"slaves\\", and demanded that they follow the Mongol method of eating rather than the halal method. Circumcision was also forbidden. Jews were affected by these laws and forbidden by the Mongols to eat Kosher. Towards the end of the Yuan dynasty, corruption and persecution became so severe that Muslim generals joined the Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. The founder of the Ming dynasty, Hongwu Emperor, led Muslim generals like Lan Yu against the Mongols, whom they defeated in combat. As he made more achievements, Lan Yu became more arrogant, self-indulgent and unbridled. He started abusing his power and status and behaved violently and recklessly, sometimes even showing disrespect towards the emperor. Once, after he seized land from peasants in Dongchang (Êù±Êòå), an official questioned him on his actions, but Lan Yu drove the official away in anger. In another incident, after Lan Yu returned from a campaign in the north, he arrived at Xifeng Pass (ÂñúÂ≥∞Èóú), where the guards denied him entry as it was already late at night, but Lan led his men to force his way through. When he was away at war, Lan Yu sometimes also demoted officers at his own will and defied orders, to the extent of going to battle without permission. During his appointment as the Crown Prince's Tutor, Lan Yu was unhappy that his post was lower than the dukes of Song and Ying, so he exclaimed, \\"Am I not fit to be the Imperial Tutor (Â§™Â∏´)?\\"[3] Some Muslim communities had a name in Chinese which meant \\"baracks\\" or \\"thanks,\\" which many Hui Muslims claim comes from the gratitude which Chinese people have towards them for their role in defeating the Mongols. The Muslims in the semu class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Rebellion, but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding. Ming dynasty File:ËÉ°Â§ßÊµ∑.jpgHu Dahai was a Chinese Muslim general of the Hongwu Emperor. File:Admiral Zhenghe.jpgChinese Muslim explorer and admiral, Zheng He. Weizhou Grand Mosque, constructed during the Ming dynasty Both Mongol and Central Asian Semu Muslim women and men of both sexes were required by Ming Code to marry Han Chinese after the first Ming Emperor Hongwu passed the law in Article 122. During the following Ming dynasty, Muslims continued to be influential around government circles. Six of Ming dynasty founder Hongwu Emperor's most trusted generals are said to have been Muslim, including Lan Yu who, in 1388, led a strong imperial Ming army out of the Great Wall and won a decisive victory over the Mongols in Mongolia, effectively ending the Mongol dream to re-conquer China. During the war fighting the Mongols, among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's armies was the Hui Muslim Feng Sheng. Zhu Yuanzhang also wrote a praise of Islam, The Hundred-word Eulogy. It was recorded that \\"His Majesty ordered to have mosques built in Xijing and Nanjing [the capital cities], and in southern Yunnan, Fujian and Guangdong. His Majesty also personally wrote baizizan [a eulogy] in praise of the Prophet's virtues.\\" Additionally, the Yongle Emperor hired Zheng He, perhaps the most famous Chinese of Muslim birth although at least in later life not a Muslim himself, to lead seven expeditions to the Indian Ocean from 1405 and 1433. However, during the Ming Dynasty, new immigration to China from Muslim countries was restricted in an increasingly isolationist nation. The Muslims in China who were descended from earlier immigration began to assimilate by speaking Chinese and by adopting Chinese names and culture. Mosque architecture began to follow traditional Chinese architecture. This era, sometimes considered the Golden Age of Islam in China, also saw Nanjing become an important center of Islamic study. Korean (Kory≈è) women's beauty was highly commended and viewed by the Ming Zhengde Emperor's Muslim advisor. Around 1376 the 30-year-old Chinese merchant Lin Nu visited Ormuz in Persia, converted to Islam and married a Semu girl (‚ÄúÂ®∂Ëâ≤ÁõÆÂ•≥‚Äù) (either a Persian or an Arab girl) and brought her back to Quanzhou in Fujian. Giraffe brought to China, by Zheng He's Treasure Fleet. Zheng He's 7th voyage Muslims in Ming dynasty Beijing were given relative freedom by the Chinese, with no restrictions placed on their religious practices or freedom of worship and being normal citizens in Beijing. In contrast to the freedom granted to Muslims, followers of Tibetan Buddhism and Catholicism suffered from restrictions and censure in Beijing. The Ming policy towards the Islamic religion was tolerant, while their racial policy towards ethnic minorities was of integration through forced marriage. Muslims were allowed to practice Islam, but if they were members of other ethnic groups they were required by law to intermarry, so Hui had to marry Han since they were different ethnic groups, with the Han often converting to Islam. Integration was mandated through intermarriage by Ming law, ethnic minorities had to marry people of other ethnic groups. The Chinese during the Ming dynasty also tried to force foreigners like the Hui into marrying Chinese women. Marriage between upper class Han Chinese and Hui Muslims was low, since upper class Han Chinese men would both refuse to marry Muslim women, and forbid their daughters from marrying Muslim men, since they did not want to convert due to their upper class status. Only low and mean status Han Chinese men would convert if they wanted to marry a Hui woman. Ming law allowed Han Chinese men and women to not have to marry Hui, and only marry each other, while Hui men and women were required to marry a spouse not of their race. The Hongwu Emperor decreed the building of multiple mosques throughout China in many locations. A Nanjing mosque was built by the Xuande Emperor. Weizhou Grand Mosque, considered as one of the most beautiful, was constructed during the Ming dynasty. An anti pig slaughter edict led to speculation that the Zhengde Emperor adopted Islam due to his use of Muslim eunuchs who commissioned the production of porcelain with Persian and Arabic inscriptions in white and blue color. Muslim eunuchs contributed money in 1496 to repairing Niujie Mosque. Central Asian women were provided to the Zhengde Emperor by a Muslim guard and Sayyid Hussein from Hami. The guard was Yu Yung and the women were Uighur. It is unknown who really was behind the anti-pig slaughter edict. The speculation of him becoming a Muslim is remembered alongside his excessive and debauched behavior along with his concubines of foreign origin. Muslim Central Asian girls were favored by Zhengde like how Korean girls were favored by Xuande. A Uighur concubine was kept by Zhengde. Foreign origin Uighur and Mongol women were favored by the Zhengde emperor. Tatar (Mongol) and Central Asian women were bedded by Zhengde. Zhengde received Central Asian Muslim Semu women from his Muslim guard Yu Yong, and Ni'ergan was the name of one of his Muslim concubines. When the Qing dynasty invaded the Ming dynasty in 1644, Muslim Ming loyalists led by Muslim leaders Milayin, Ding Guodong and Ma Shouying led a revolt in 1646 against the Qing during the Milayin rebellion in order to drive the Qing out and restore the Ming Prince of Yanchang Zhu Shichuan to the throne as the emperor. The Muslim Ming loyalists were crushed by the Qing with 100,000 of them, including Milayin and Ding Guodong killed. Qing dynasty Depiction of a Central Asian Muslim from Altishahr, during the Qing dynasty Chinese Muslims during the 1800s by Julien-L√©opold Boilly The Qing dynasty (1644‚Äì1911) witnessed multiple revolts. The Qing rulers belonged to the Manchu, a minority in China. When the Qing dynasty replaced the Ming dynasty starting in 1644, Muslim Ming loyalists in Gansu led by Muslim leaders Milayin and Ding Guodong led a revolt in 1646 against the Qing during the Milayin rebellion in order to drive the Qing out and restore the Ming Prince of Yanchang Zhu Shichuan to the throne as the emperor. The Muslim Ming loyalists were supported by Hami's Sultan Sa'id Baba and his son Prince Turumtay. The Muslim Ming loyalists were joined by Tibetans and Han Chinese in the revolt. After fierce fighting, and negotiations, a peace agreement was agreed on in 1649, and Milayan and Ding nominally pledged allegiance to the Qing and were given ranks as members of the Qing military. When other Ming loyalists in southern China made a resurgence and the Qing were forced to withdraw their forces from Gansu to fight them, Milayan and Ding once again took up arms and rebelled against the Qing. The Muslim Ming loyalists were then crushed by the Qing with 100,000 of them, including Milayin, Ding Guodong, and Turumtay killed in battle. The Confucian Hui Muslim scholar Ma Zhu (1640-1710) served with the Southern Ming loyalists against the Qing. Zhu Yu'ai, the Ming Prince Gui was accompanied by Hui refugees when he fled from Huguang to the Burmese border in Yunnan and as a mark of their defiance against the Qing and loyalty to the Ming, they changed their surname to Ming. In Guangzhou, the national monuments known as \\"The Muslim's Loyal Trio\\" are the tombs of Ming loyalist Muslims who were martyred while fighting in battle against the Qing in the Manchu conquest of China in Guangzhou.Ring & Salkin & La Boda 1996 , p. 306. The Ming Muslim loyalists were called \\"jiaomen sanzhong \\"Three defenders of the faith\\". In the Jahriyya revolt sectarian violence between two suborders of the Naqshbandi Sufis, the Jahriyya Sufi Muslims and their rivals, the Khafiyya Sufi Muslims, led to a Jahriyya Sufi Muslim rebellion which the Qing dynasty in China crushed with the help of the Khafiyya Sufi Muslims. The Ush rebellion in 1765 by Uyghurs against the Manchus occurred after Uyghur women were gang raped by the servants and son of Manchu official Su-cheng. It was said that Ush Muslims had long wanted to sleep on [Sucheng and son's] hides and eat their flesh. because of the rape of Uyghur Muslim women for months by the Manchu official Sucheng and his son. The Manchu Emperor ordered that the Uyghur rebel town be massacred, the Qing forces enslaved all the Uyghur children and women and slaughtered the Uyghur men. Manchu soldiers and Manchu officials regularly having sex with or raping Uyghur women caused massive hatred and anger by Uyghur Muslims to Manchu rule. The invasion by Jahangir Khoja was preceded by another Manchu official, Binjing who raped a Muslim daughter of the Kokan aqsaqal from 1818‚Äì1820. The Qing sought to cover up the rape of Uyghur women by Manchus to prevent anger against their rule from spreading among the Uyghurs. The Manchu official Shuxing'a started an anti-Muslim massacre which led to the Panthay Rebellion. Shuxing'a developed a deep hatred of Muslims after an incident where he was stripped naked and nearly lynched by a mob of Muslims. He ordered several Muslim rebels to be slow sliced to death. Dali, the capital of the Pingnan Sultanate in Yunnan, 1873 The Muslim revolt in the northwest occurred due to violent and bloody infighting between Muslim groups, the Gedimu, Khafiya and Jahriyya. The rebellion in Yunnan occurred because of repression by Qing officials, resulting in five bloody Hui rebellions, most notably the Panthay Rebellion, which occurred in Yunnan province from 1855 to 1873 and the Dungan revolt, which occurred mostly in Xinjiang, Shensi and Gansu, from 1862 to 1877. The Manchu government ordered the execution of all rebels, killing a million people in the Panthay rebellion, several million in the Dungan revolt. The Hui Muslim population of Beijing was unaffected by the Muslim rebels during the Dungan revolt. Elisabeth All√®s wrote that the relationship between Hui Muslim and Han peoples continued normally in the Henan area, with no ramifications or consequences from the Muslim rebellions of other areas. All√®s wrote \\"The major Muslim revolts in the middle of the nineteenth century which involved the Hui in Shaanxi, Gansu and Yunnan, as well as the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, do not seem to have had any direct effect on this region of the central plain.\\" However, many Muslims like Ma Zhan'ao, Ma Anliang, Dong Fuxiang, Ma Qianling and Ma Julung defected to the Qing dynasty side and helped the Qing general Zuo Zongtang exterminate the Muslim rebels. These Muslim generals belonged to the Khafiya sect, and they helped Qing massacre Jahariyya rebels. General Zuo moved the Han around Hezhou out of the area and relocated them as a reward for the Muslims there helping Qing kill other Muslim rebels. In 1895, another Dungan Revolt broke out, and loyalist Muslims like Dong Fuxiang, Ma Anliang, Ma Guoliang, Ma Fulu and Ma Fuxiang suppressed and massacred the rebel Muslims led by Ma Dahan, Ma Yonglin and Ma Wanfu. A Muslim army called the Kansu Braves led by General Dong Fuxiang fought for the Qing dynasty against the foreigners during the Boxer Rebellion. They included well known generals like Ma Anliang, Ma Fulu and Ma Fuxiang. In Yunnan, the Qing armies exterminated only the Muslims who had rebelled and spared Muslims who took no part in the uprising. Uyghurs in Turfan and Hami and their leaders like Emin Khoja allied with the Qing against Uyghurs in Altishahr. During the Qing dynasty, China enfeoffed (granted freehold property in exchange for pledged service) the rulers of Turpan, in eastern present-day Xinjiang and Hami (Kumul) as autonomous princes, while the rest of the Uyghurs in Altishahr (the Tarim Basin) were ruled by Begs. Uyghurs from Turpan and Hami were appointed by China as officials to rule over Uyghurs in the Tarim Basin. In addition to sending Han exiles convicted of crimes to Xinjiang to be slaves of Banner garrisons there, the Qing also practiced reverse exile, exiling Inner Asian (Mongol, Russian and Muslim criminals from Mongolia and Inner Asia) to China proper where they would serve as slaves in Han Banner garrisons in Guangzhou. Russian, Oirats and Muslims (Oros. Ulet. Hoise jergi weilengge niyalma) such as Yakov and Dmitri were exiled to the Han banner garrison in Guangzhou.Yongwei, MWLFZZ, FHA 03-0188-2740-032, QL 43.3.30 (April 26, 1778). In the 1780s after the Muslim rebellion in Gansu started by Zhang Wenqing ÂºµÊñáÊÖ∂ was defeated, Muslims like Ma Jinlu È¶¨ÈÄ≤Á•ø were exiled to the Han Banner garrison in Guangzhou to become slaves to Han Banner officers. ≈†ande ÂñÑÂæ∑ , MWLFZZ, FHA 03-0193-3238-046, QL 54.5.6 (May 30, 1789) and ≈†ande , MWLFZZ, FHA 03-0193-3248-028, QL 54.6.30 (August 20, 1789).

Republic of China 1939, Northwest China, Chinese Muslim fighters gather to fight against the Japanese Dead bodies of the Chinese Hui Muslim Ha family who were slaughtered and raped by the Japanese in Nanjing The Hui Muslim community was divided in its support for the 1911 Xinhai Revolution. The Hui Muslims of Shaanxi supported the revolutionaries and the Hui Muslims of Gansu supported the Qing. The native Hui Muslims (Mohammedans) of Xi'an (Shaanxi Province) joined the Han Chinese revolutionaries in slaughtering the entire 20,000 Manchu population of Xi'an. The native Hui Muslims of Gansu Province led by general Ma Anliang sided with the Qing and prepard to attack the anti-Qing revolutionaries of Xi'an City. Only some wealthy Manchus who were ransomed and Manchu females survived. Wealthy Han Chinese seized Manchu girls to become their slaves and poor Han Chinese troops seized young Manchu women to be their wives. Young pretty Manchu girls were also seized by Hui Muslims of Xi'an during the massacre and brought up as Muslims. After the fall of the Qing Dynasty, Sun Yat-sen, who established the Republic of China, immediately proclaimed that the country belonged equally to the Han, Man (Manchu), Meng (Mongol), Hui (Muslim),Currently, \\"Hui\\" in Chinese refers to both Islamic and ethnic Hui Chinese. Previously, however, \\"Hui\\" referred to Islam and all Chinese Muslims, particularly ethnic Hui and Uyghurs. Tsang (Tibetan) and Miao peoples. During the rule of the Kuomintang party, the Kuomintang appointed the Muslim warlords of the family known as the Ma clique as the Military Governors of the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu and Ningxia. Bai Chongxi was a Muslim General and Defence Minister of China during this time. During the Second Sino-Japanese war, the Japanese destroyed 220 mosques and killed countless Hui by April 1941. The Hui Muslim county of Dachang was subjected to slaughter by the Japanese. During the Rape of Nanking the Mosques in Nanjing were flowing with dead bodies after the Japanese slaughters. Japanese smeared Hui Mosques with pork fat, forcing Hui girls to serve as sex slaves and destroyed the cemeteries of the Hui. Many Hui, Turkic Salar, Dongxiang and Bonan Muslims fought in the war against Japan. In 1937, during the Battle of Beiping‚ÄìTianjin, the Chinese government received a telegram from Muslim General Ma Bufang of the Ma clique that he was prepared to bring the fight to the Japanese. Immediately after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, Ma Bufang arranged for a cavalry division under the Muslim General Ma Biao to be sent east to battle the Japanese. Ethnic Turkic Salar Muslims made up the majority of the first cavalry division which was sent by Ma Bufang. In the Kuomintang Islamic insurgency, Muslim Kuomintang National Revolutionary Army forces in Northwest China, in Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, as well as Yunnan, continued an unsuccessful insurgency against the communists from 1950 to 1958, after the general civil war was over. People's Republic of China An ethnic Hui family celebrating Eid ul-Fitr in Ningxia During the Cultural Revolution, mosques along with other religious buildings were often defaced, destroyed or closed and copies of the Quran were destroyed along with temples, churches, Buddhist and Daoist monasteries and cemeteries by the Red Guards. In 1975, in what would be known as the Shadian incident, there was a uprising among Hui in what was the only large scale ethnic rebellion during the Cultural Revolution.The conflict escalated when Communist leftists criticized the conservative Muslims and when those Muslims took control of local PLA barracks and arsenals in several counties, they made weapons by themselves, arming themselves against perceived outside oppression.This ultimately let the central government to conclude that the movement had become militarily rebellious In suppressing the rebellion, the PLA killed 1,600 Hui. Following the fall of the Gang of Four, apologies and reparations were made. During that time, the government also constantly accused Muslims and other religious groups of holding \\"superstitious beliefs\\" and promoting \\"anti-socialist trends\\".Israeli (2002), pg. 253 The government began to relax its policies towards Muslims in 1978. Eid al-Adha at Jiangwan Mosque, Shanghai Restrictions on religious freedoms imposed by the government can vary from region to region. In 1989, China banned a book titled \\"Xing Fengsu\\" (\\"Sexual Customs\\") which insulted Islam and placed its authors under arrest after protests in Lanzhou and Beijing by Chinese Hui Muslims, during which the Chinese police provided protection to the Hui Muslim protestors and the Chinese government organized public burnings of the book.Beijing Review, Volume 32 1989 , p. 13. In 2007, anticipating the coming \\"Year of the Pig\\" in the Chinese calendar, depictions of pigs were banned from CCTV \\"to avoid conflicts with Muslim minorities\\". This is believed to refer to China's population of 20 million Muslims (to whom pigs are considered \\"unclean\\"). Hui Muslims enjoy such freedoms, practising their religion, building Mosques at which their children attend, while Uyghurs in Xinjiang experienced strict controls. Since the 1980s, Islamic private schools (Sino-Arabic schools (‰∏≠ÈòøÂ≠∏Ê†°)) have been supported and permitted by the Chinese government among Muslim areas, only specifically excluding Xinjiang from allowing these schools because of separatist sentiment there. After secondary education is completed, Hui students are permitted to embark on religious studies under an Imam.ALL√àS & CH√âRIF-CHEBBI & HALFON 2003 , p. 14. Hui Muslims who are employed by the state are allowed to fast during Ramadan unlike Uyghurs in the same positions, the number of Hu√≠ going on Hajj was reported to be expanding in 2014 and Hui women are allowed to wear veils, while Uyghur women are discouraged from wearing them. Uyghurs find it difficult to get passports to go on Hajj. By 2013, repression of Uyghurs extended to disappearing dissidents and imposing life imprisonment sentences on academics for promoting Uyghur social interactions. In March 2014, the Chinese media estimated that there were around 300 Chinese Muslims active in ISIS territories.Mizokami, K. (2014, March 2). China Has an ISIS Problem. The Week Moving forward, the Chinese government stated in May 2015 that it would not tolerate any form of terrorism and would work to ‚Äúcombat terrorist forces, including ETIM, [to] safeguard global peace, security and stability.\\" In the five years to 2017, a 306 per cent increase in criminal arrests was seen in Xinjiang and the arrests there accounted for 21 per cent of the national total, despite the region contributing just 1.5 per cent of the population. The increase was seen as driven by the government's \\"Strike Hard\\" campaign. In 2017, driven by a 92 percent in security spending there that year, an estimated 227,882 criminal arrests were made in Xinjiang. In August 2018, the authorities were vigorously pursuing the suppression of mosques, including their widespread destruction, over Muslim protests. Also at that time, the growing of long beards and the wearing veils or Islamic robes, were banned. All vehicle owners were required to install GPS tracking devices. The Associated Press also reported in late November that Uighur families were required to allow local government officials to live in their homes as \\"relatives\\" in a \\"Pair Up and Become Family\\" campaign. While the official was living in a home, the residents were closely watched and not allowed to pray or wear religious clothing. Authorities said that the program was voluntary but Muslims who were interviewed by AP expressed concern that refusal to cooperate would lead to serious repercussions. =Re-education camps= In May 2018, it was reported that hundreds of thousands of Muslims were being detained in massive extra-judicial internment camps in Western Xinjiang. These were called \\"re-education\\" camps and later, \\"vocational training centres\\" by the government, intended for the \\"rehabilitation and redemption\\" to combat terrorism and religious extremism. The camps have been reportedly described as \\"Orwellian\\" and some Western journalists have made comparisons to Nazi concentration camps. On 31 August 2018, the United Nations committee called on the Chinese government to \\"end the practice of detention without lawful charge, trial and conviction\\", to release the detained persons, to provide specifics as to the number of interred individuals and the reasons for their detention and to investigate the allegations of \\"racial, ethnic and ethno-religious profiling\\". A BBC report quoted an unnamed Chinese official as saying that \\"Uighurs enjoyed full rights\\" but also admitting that \\"those deceived by religious extremism... shall be assisted by resettlement and re-education\\". The state-run tabloid Global Times also responded that the controls in Xinjiang were \\"intense\\", but not permanent. On 17 June 2020, President Donald Trump signed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, which authorizes the imposition of U.S. sanctions against Chinese government officials responsible for re-education camps. Sectarian tensions Hui-Uyghur tension Tensions between Hui Muslims and Uyghurs arise because Hui troops and officials often dominated the Uyghurs in the past, and crushed the Uyghurs' revolts. Xinjiang's Hui population increased by over 520 percent between 1940 and 1982, an average annual growth of 4.4 percent, while the Uyghur population only grew at 1.7 percent. This dramatic increase in Hui population led inevitably to significant tensions between the Hui and Uyghur populations. Many Hui Muslim civilians were killed by Uyghur rebellion troops in 1933 known as the Kizil massacre. During the 2009 rioting in Xinjiang that killed around 200 people, ‚ÄúKill the Han, kill the Hui.‚Äù is a common cry spread across social media among Uyghur extremists. Some Uyghurs in Kashgar remember that the Hui army at the Battle of Kashgar (1934) massacred 2,000 to 8,000 Uyghurs, which causes tension as more Hui moved into Kashgar from other parts of China. Some Hui criticize Uyghur separatism and generally do not want to get involved in conflict in other countries. Hui and Uyghur live separately, attending different mosques. The Uyghur militant organization East Turkestan Islamic Movement's magazine Islamic Turkistan has accused the Chinese \\"Muslim Brotherhood\\" (the Yihewani) of being responsible for the moderation of Hui Muslims and the lack of Hui joining jihadist groups in addition to blaming other things for the lack of Hui Jihadists, such as the fact that for more than 300 years Hui and Uyghurs have been enemies of each other, no separatist Islamist organizations among the Hui, the fact that the Hui view China as their home, and the fact that the \\"infidel Chinese\\" language is the language of the Hui. Hui Muslim drug dealers are accused by Uyghur Muslims of pushing heroin on Uyghurs. Heroin has been vended by Hui dealers. There is a typecast image in the public eye of heroin being the province of Hui dealers. Hui have been involved in the Golden Triangle drug area.  Hui sects  There have been many occurrences of violent sectarian fighting between different Hui sects. Sectarian fighting between Hui sects led to the Jahriyya rebellion in the 1780s and the 1895 revolt. After a hiatus after the People's Republic of China came to power, sectarian in fighting resumed in the 1990s in Ningxia between different sects. Several sects refuse to intermarry with each other. One Sufi sect circulated an anti-Salafi pamphlet in Arabic. Salafi movement, which is increasing in China due to fund from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, both are major backers of Salafism, had facilitated a number of Chinese Salafi mosques. Some Hui Salafists have joined Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Tibetan Muslims In Tibet, the majority of Muslims are Hui people. Hatred between Tibetans and Muslims stems from events during the Muslim warlord Ma Bufang's rule in Qinghai such as Ngolok rebellions (1917‚Äì49) and the Sino-Tibetan War, but in 1949 the Communists put an end to the violence between Tibetans and Muslims, however, new Tibetan-Muslim violence broke out after China engaged in liberalization. Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide. Muslims prayed in secret at home when in August 2008 the Tibetans burned the Mosque. The repression of Tibetan separatism by the Chinese government is supported by Hui Muslims. In addition, Chinese-speaking Hui have problems with Tibetan Hui (the Tibetan-speaking Kache minority of Muslims). The main Mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans and Chinese Hui Muslims were violently assaulted by Tibetan rioters in the 2008 Tibetan unrest. Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars alike ignore this and do not talk about sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims. The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 positively and it had the effect of galvanizing anti-Muslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an anti-Muslim boycott against Muslim owned businesses. Tibetan Buddhists propagate a false libel that Muslims cremate their Imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes, even though the Tibetans seem to be aware that Muslims practice burial and not cremation since they frequently clash against proposed Muslim cemeteries in their area. Since the Chinese government supports and backs up the Hui Muslims, the Tibetans deliberately attack the Hui Muslims as a way to demonstrate anti-government sentiment and because they have a background of sectarian violence against each other since Ma Bufang's rule due to their separate religions and ethnicity and Tibetans resent Hui economic domination.  People  Ethnic groups Muslim, Bonan children Muslims live in every region in China. The highest concentrations are found in the northwest provinces of Xinjiang, Gansu and Ningxia, with significant populations also found throughout Yunnan Province in Southwest China and Henan Province in Central China. Of China's 55 officially recognized minority peoples, ten groups are predominantly Muslim. The largest groups in descending order are Hui (9.8 million in year 2000 census or 48% of the officially tabulated number of Muslims), Uyghur (8.4 million, 41%), Kazakh (1.25 million, 6.1%), Dongxiang (514,000, 2.5%), Kyrgyz (144,000), Uzbeks (125,000), Salar (105,000), Tajik (41,000), Bonan (17,000) and Tatar (5,000). However, individual members of traditionally Muslim groups may profess other religions or none at all. Additionally, Tibetan Muslims are officially classified along with the Tibetan people. Muslims live predominantly in the areas that border Central Asia, Tibet and Mongolia, i.e. Xinjiang, Ningxia, Gansu and Qinghai, which is known as the \\"Quran Belt\\". Uyghur Muslims in a livestock market in Kashgar. Genetics The East Asian O3-M122 Y chromosome Haplogroup is found in large quantities in other Muslims close to the Hui like Dongxiang, Bo'an and Salar. The majority of Tibeto-Burmans, Han Chinese and Ningxia and Liaoning Hui share paternal Y chromosomes of East Asian origin which are unrelated to Middle Easterners and Europeans. In contrast to distant Middle Eastern and Europeans whom the Muslims of China are not related to, East Asians, Han Chinese and most of the Hui and Dongxiang of Linxia share more genes with each other. This indicates that native East Asian populations converted to Islam and were culturally assimilated to these ethnicities and that Chinese Muslim populations are mostly not descendants of foreigners as claimed by some accounts while only a small minority of them are. Number of Muslims in China 99 names of Allah, in Chinese Sini A 2009 study done by the Pew Research Center concluded there are 21,667,000 Muslims in China, accounting for 1.6% of the total population.\\"Mapping the Global Muslim Population.\\" Pew Research Center. October 2009. See pages 13 and 45. According to the CIA World Factbook, about 1‚Äì2% of the total population in China are Muslims. The 2000 census counts imply that there may be up to 20 million Muslims in China. According to the textbook, ‚ÄúReligions in the Modern World‚Äù, it states that the ‚Äúnumbers of followers of any one tradition are difficult to estimate and must in China as everywhere else rely on statistics compiled by the largest institutions, either those of the state ‚Äì which tend to underestimate ‚Äì or those of the religious institutions themselves ‚Äì which tend to overestimate. If we include all the population of those designated ‚Äònational‚Äô minorities with an Islamic heritage in the territory of China, then we can conclude that there are some 20 million Muslims in the People‚Äôs Republic of China.Counting up the number of people of traditionally Muslim nationalities who were enumerated in the 1990 census gives a total of 17.6 million, 96% of whom belong to just three nationalities: Hui 8.6 million, Uyghurs 7.2 million and Kazakhs 1.1 million. Other nationalities that are traditionally Muslim include Kyrghyz, Tajiks, Uzbeks, Tatars, Salar, Bonan and Dongxiang. See Dru C. Gladney, \\"Islam in China: Accommodation or Separatism?\\", Paper presented at Symposium on Islam in Southeast Asia and China, Hong Kong, 2002. Available at islamsymposium.cityu.edu.hk . The 2000 census reported a total of 20.3 million members of Muslim nationalities, of which again 96% belonged to just three groups: Hui 9.8 million, Uyghurs 8.4 million, and Kazakhs 1.25 million. According to SARA there are approximately 36,000 Islamic places of worship, more than 45,000 imams, and 10 Islamic schools in the country. Within the next two decades from 2011, Pew projects a slowing down of the Muslim population growth in China compared to previous years, with Muslim women in China having a 1.7 fertility rate. Many Hui Muslims voluntarily limit themselves to one child in China since their Imams preach to them about the benefits of population control, while the number of children Hui in different areas are allowed to have varies between one and three children. Chinese family planning policy allows minorities including Muslims to have up to two children in urban areas and three to four children in rural areas. An early historical estimate of the Muslim population of the then Qing Empire belongs to the Christian missionary Marshall Broomhall. In his book, published in 1910, he produced estimates for each province, based on the reports of missionaries working there, who had counted mosques, talked to mullahs, etc. Broomhall admits the inadequacy of the data for Xinjiang, estimating the Muslim population of Xinjiang (i.e., virtually the entire population of the province at the time) in the range from 1,000,000 (based on the total population number of 1,200,000 in the contemporary Statesman's Yearbook) to 2,400,000 (2 million \\"Turki\\", 200,000 \\"Hasak\\" and 200,000 \\"Tungan\\", as per George Hunter). He uses the estimates of 2,000,000 to 3,500,000 for Gansu (which then also included today's Ningxia and parts of Qinghai), 500,000 to 1,000,000 for Zhili (i.e., Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei), 300,000 to 1,000,000 for Yunnan and smaller numbers for other provinces, down to 1,000 in Fujian. For Mongolia (then, part of the Qing Empire) he takes an arbitrary range of 50,000 to 100,000. Quote: \\"No definite information has been received concerning Mongolia\\". Summing up, he arrives to the grand total of 4,727,000 to 9,821,000 Muslims throughout the Qing Empire of its last years, i.e. just over 1‚Äì2% of the entire country's estimated population of 426,045,305. The 1920 edition of New International Yearbook: A Compendium of the World's Progress gave the number \\"between 5,000,000 and 10,000,000\\" as the total number of Muslims in the Republic of China.  Religious practices  Islamic education in China Chinese Muslim students In the two decades up to 2006, a wide range of Islamic educational opportunities were developed to meet the needs of China's Muslim population. In addition to mosque schools, government Islamic colleges and independent Islamic colleges, more students went overseas to continue their studies at international Islamic universities in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran, Pakistan and Malaysia. Qƒ´ngzhƒìn (Ê∏ÖÁúü) is the Chinese term for certain Islamic institutions. Its literal meaning is \\"pure truth.\\" Muslim groups The vast majority of China's Muslims are Sunni Muslims. A notable feature of some Muslim communities in China is the presence of female imams. Islamic scholar Ma Tong recorded that the 6,781,500 Hui in China predominately followed the Orthodox form of Islam (58.2% were Gedimu, a non-Sufi mainstream tradition that opposed unorthodoxy and religious innovation), mainly adhering to the Hanafi Madh'hab. However a large minority of Hui are members of Sufi groups. According to Tong, 21% Yihewani, 10.9% Jahriyya, 7.2% Khuffiya, 1.4% Qadariyya and 0.7% Kubrawiyya. Shia Chinese Muslims are mostly Ismailis, including Tajiks of the Tashkurgan and Sarikul areas of Xinjiang. Chinese Muslims and the Hajj It is known that Admiral Zheng He (1371‚Äì1435) and his Muslim crews had made the journey to Mecca and performed the Hajj during one of the former's voyages to the western ocean between 1401‚Äì1433. Other Chinese Muslims may have made the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in the following centuries; however, there is little information on this. General Ma Lin made a Hajj to Mecca. General Ma Fuxiang along with Ma Linyi sponsored Imam Wang Jingzhai when he went on hajj to Mecca in 1921. Yihewani Imam Hu Songshan went on Hajj in 1925. Briefly during the Cultural Revolution, Chinese Muslims were not allowed to attend the Hajj and only did so through Pakistan, but this policy was reversed in 1979. Chinese Muslims now attend the Hajj in large numbers, typically in organized groups, with a record 10,700 Chinese Muslim pilgrims from all over the country making the Hajj in 2007.  Representative bodies  Islamic Association of China Headquarters of the Islamic Association of China in Beijing Established by the government, the Islamic Association of China claims to represent Chinese Muslims nationwide. At its inaugural meeting on May 11, 1953, in Beijing, representatives from 10 nationalities of the People's Republic of China were in attendance. The association was to be run by 16 Islamic religious leaders charged with making \\"a correct and authoritative interpretation\\" of Islamic creed and canon. Its brief is to compile and spread inspirational speeches and help imams \\"improve\\" themselves, and vet sermons made by clerics around the country. Some examples of the religious concessions granted to Muslims are: *Muslim communities are allowed separate cemeteries *Muslim couples may have their marriage consecrated by an Imam *Muslim workers are permitted holidays during major religious festivals *Chinese Muslims are also allowed to make the Hajj to Mecca, and more than 45,000 Chinese Muslims have done so in recent years.  Culture and heritage  The Niujie Mosque in Beijing Although contacts and previous conquests have occurred before, the Mongol conquest of the greater part of Eurasia in the 13th century permanently brought the extensive cultural traditions of China, central Asia and western Asia into a single empire, albeit one of separate khanates, for the first time in history. The intimate interaction that resulted is evident in the legacy of both traditions. In China, Islam influenced technology, sciences, philosophy and the arts. For example, the Chinese adopted much Islamic medical knowledge such as wound healing and urinalysis. However, the Chinese were not the only ones to benefit from the cultural exchanges of the Silk Road. Islam showed many influences from buddhist China in their new techniques in art, especially when humans began to be depicted in paintings which was thought to be forbidden in Islam. In terms of material culture, one finds decorative motifs from central Asian Islamic architecture and calligraphy and the marked halal impact on northern Chinese cuisine. Taking the Mongol Eurasian empire as a point of departure, the ethnogenesis of the Hui, or Sinophone Muslims, can also be charted through the emergence of distinctly Chinese Muslim traditions in architecture, food, epigraphy and Islamic written culture. This multifaceted cultural heritage continues to the present day.CHINA HERITAGE NEWSLETTER China Heritage Project, The Australian National University No. 5, March 2006 Military Muslims have often filled military positions, and many Muslims have joined the Chinese army. Muslims served extensively in the Chinese military, as both officials and soldiers. It was said that the Muslim Dongxiang and Salar were given to \\"eating rations\\", a reference to military service. Islamic architecture in China Id Kah Mosque In Chinese, a mosque is called qƒ´ngzhƒìn s√¨ (Ê∏ÖÁúüÂØ∫) or \\"pure truth temple.\\" The Huaisheng Mosque and Great Mosque of Xi'an (first established during the Tang era) and the Great Southern Mosque in Jinan, whose current buildings date from the Ming Dynasty, do not replicate many of the features often associated with traditional mosques. Instead, they follow traditional Chinese architecture. Mosques in western China incorporate more of the elements seen in mosques in other parts of the world. Western Chinese mosques were more likely to incorporate minarets and domes while eastern Chinese mosques were more likely to look like pagodas. An important feature in Chinese architecture is its emphasis on symmetry, which connotes a sense of grandeur; this applies to everything from palaces to mosques. One notable exception is in the design of gardens, which tends to be as asymmetrical as possible. Like Chinese scroll paintings, the principle underlying the garden's composition is to create enduring flow; to let the patron wander and enjoy the garden without prescription, as in nature herself. On the foothills of Mount Lingshan are the tombs of two of the four companions that Muhammad sent eastwards to preach Islam. Known as the \\"Holy Tombs,\\" they house the companions Sa-Ke-Zu and Wu-Ko-Shun‚Äîtheir Chinese names, of course. The other two companions went to Guangzhou and Yangzhou. Chinese buildings may be built with bricks, but wooden structures are the most common; these are more capable of withstanding earthquakes, but are vulnerable to fire. The roof of a typical Chinese building is curved; there are strict classifications of gable types, comparable with the classical orders of European columns. As in all regions the Chinese Islamic architecture reflects the local architecture in its style. China is renowned for its beautiful mosques, which resemble temples. However, in western China the mosques resemble those of the middle east, with tall, slender minarets, curvy arches and dome shaped roofs. In northwest China where the Chinese Hui have built their mosques, there is a combination of east and west. The mosques have flared Chinese-style roofs set in walled courtyards entered through archways with miniature domes and minarets. The first mosque was the Great Mosque of Xian or the Xian Mosque, which was created in the Tang Dynasty in the 7th century. Ningxia officials notified on 3 August 2018 that the Weizhou Grand Mosque will be forcibly demolished on Friday because it had not received the proper permits before construction. Officials in the town were saying the mosque had not been given proper building permits, because it is built in a Middle Eastern style and include numerous domes and minarets. The residents of Weizhou were alarmed each other by social media and finally stopped the mosque destruction by public demonstrations. According to a 2020 report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, since 2017, Chinese authorities have destroyed or damaged 16,000 mosques in Xinjiang ‚Äì 65% of the region's total. Halal food in China A halal butcher shop at Huxi Mosque in Shanghai Halal food has a long history in China. The arrival of Arabian and Persian merchants during the Tang and Song dynasties saw the introduction of the Muslim diet. Chinese Muslim cuisine adheres strictly to the Islamic dietary rules with mutton and lamb being the predominant ingredient. The advantage of Muslim cuisine in China is that it has inherited the diverse cooking methods of Chinese cuisine for example, braising, roasting, steaming, stewing and many more. Due to China's multicultural background Muslim cuisine retains its own style and characteristics according to regions. Due to the large Muslim population in Western China, many Chinese restaurants cater to Muslims or cater to the general public but are run by Muslims. In most major cities in China, there are small Islamic restaurants or food stalls typically run by migrants from Western China (e.g., Uyghurs), which offer inexpensive noodle soup. Lamb and mutton dishes are more commonly available than in other Chinese restaurants, due to the greater prevalence of these meats in the cuisine of western Chinese regions. Commercially prepared food can be certified Halal by approved agencies. In Chinese, halal is called qƒ´ngzhƒìnc√†i (Ê∏ÖÁúüËèú) or \\"pure truth food.\\" Beef and lamb slaughtered according to Islamic rituals is also commonly available in public markets, especially in North China. Such meat is sold by Muslim butchers, who operate independent stalls next to non-Muslim butchers. In October 2018, the government launched an official anti-halal policy, urging officials to suppress the \\"pan-halal tendency\\", seen as an encroachment by religion into secular life and a source of religious extremism. Calligraphy =Sini= Sini-style Arabic calligraphy of the first Shahada (La 'ilƒÅha 'illƒÅ AllƒÅh) at the Great Mosque of Xi'an Sini is a Chinese Islamic calligraphic form for the Arabic script. It can refer to any type of Chinese Islamic calligraphy, but is commonly used to refer to one with thick and tapered effects, much like Chinese calligraphy. It is used extensively in mosques in Eastern China and to a lesser extent in Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi. A famous Sini calligrapher is Hajji Noor Deen Mi Guangjiang. =Xiao'erjing= A Chinese-Arabic-Xiaoerjing dictionary from the early days of the People's Republic of China Xiao'erjing (also Xiao'erjin or Xiaojing) is the practice of writing Sinitic languages such as Mandarin (especially the Lanyin, Zhongyuan and Northeastern dialects) or the Dungan language in the Arabic script. It is used on occasion by many ethnic minorities who adhere to the Islamic faith in China (mostly the Hui, but also the Dongxiang and the Salar) and formerly by their Dungan descendants in Central Asia. Martial arts There is a long history of Muslim development and participation at the highest level of Chinese wushu. The Hui started and adapted many of the styles of wushu such as bajiquan, piguazhang and liuhequan. There were specific areas that were known to be centers of Muslim wushu, such as Cang County in Hebei Province. These traditional Hui martial arts were very distinct from the Turkic styles practiced in Xinjiang. Literature The Han Kitab was a collection of Chinese Islamic texts written by Chinese Muslim which synthesized Islam and Confucianism. It was written in the early 18th century during the Qing dynasty. Han is Chinese for Chinese and kitab (ketabu in Chinese) is Arabic for book. Liu Zhi wrote his Han Kitab in Nanjing in the early 18th century. The works of Wu Sunqie, Zhang Zhong and Wang Daiyu were also included in the Han Kitab. The Han Kitab was widely read and approved of by later Chinese Muslims such as Ma Qixi, Ma Fuxiang and Hu Songshan. They believed that Islam could be understood through Confucianism. Education A lot of Chinese students including male and females join International Islamic University, Islamabad to gain Islamic knowledge. For some Muslim groups in China, such as the Hui and Salar minorities, coeducation is frowned upon; for some groups such as Uyghurs, it is not. Women imams With the exception of China, the world has very few mosques directed by women. China is alone with having the position of Imam held by women.  Reeducation camps and Restricting religious freedom The Xinjiang re-education camps are officially called \\"Vocational Education and Training Centers\\" by the Chinese government. The re-education camps have been operated by the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Regional government since 2014. However, the efforts of the camps strongly intensified after a change of head for the region. The UN Human Rights Counsel has alleged that China has been actively harvesting organs from the prisoners of their re-education camps and selling them on the global market. Alongside the Uyghurs, other Muslim minorities have also been reported to be held in these re-education camps. As of 2019, 23 nations in the United Nations have signed a letter condemning China for the camps and asking them to close them. In October 2018, the BBC News published an investigative expos√© claiming based on satellite imagery and testimony that hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are being held without trial in internment camps in Xinjiang. On the other hand, the United States Department of Defense believes that around 1 million to 3 million people have been detained and put in the re-education camps. Some sources quoted in the article say ‚ÄúAs far as I know, the Chinese government wants to delete Uighur identity from the world.‚Äù The New York Times suggests that China has been successful in keeping countries quiet about the camps in Xinjiang due to its diplomatic and economic power, but when countries do decide to criticize the country, they do so in groups in hopes of lessening punishments from China.. On 28 April 2020, U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom issued ‚ÄúInternational Religious Freedom Annual Report 2020‚Äù . The Report states that ‚ÄúIndividuals have been sent to the camps for wearing long beards, refusing alcohol, or other behaviors authorities deem to be signs of ‚Äúreligious extremism.‚Äù Former detainees report that they suffered torture, rape, sterilization, and other abuses. In addition, nearly half a million Muslim children have been separated from their families and placed in boarding schools. During 2019, the camps increasingly transitioned from reeducation to forced labor as detainees were forced to work in cotton and textile factories. Outside the camps, the government continued to deploy officials to live with Muslim families and to report on any signs of ‚Äúextremist‚Äù religious behavior. Meanwhile, authorities in Xinjiang and other parts of China have destroyed or damaged thousands of mosques and removed Arabic-language signs from Muslim businesses. ‚Äù  Famous Muslims in China  Explorers *Zheng He, mariner and explorer. *Fei Xin, Zheng He's translator. *Ma Huan, a companion of Zheng He. *: * Generals from the Qing era: *: * Generals in the Republic of China: *: * Warlords of the Ma clique during the Republic of China era: *: * Generals from the 36th Division (National Revolutionary Army): *: * Du Wenxiu, Ma Hualong and Ma Zhan'ao, leaders of the Panthay Rebellion in Yunnan and the Muslim rebellion in northwestern China. * Ma Shenglin, great-uncle of Ma Shaowu and rebel during the Panthay Rebellion. * Ma Zhanshan, guerilla during the Second Sino-Japanese War. * Ma Xiao, General (Liu Wenhui). * Zuo Baogui (1837‚Äì1894), Qing Muslim general from Shandong who died while defending Pingyang, Korea, from the Japanese.A memorial to him was built.

It combines a simple sound module with a sequencer to record and store notation, along with controls aimed at encouraging the musician to improvise the music while it is playing. Despite the number in its name and the attention it received at its launch, the MC-303 has more in common with other MC prefixed synthesizers (such as the Roland MC-202), which contain built-in sequencers, than it does with the famous Roland TB-303. As the first Groovebox, the MC-303 was the first in a line of inexpensive products specifically targeted towards house DJs and amateur home musicians rather than professional producers. It was superseded by the Roland MC-505. It is the predecessor to the Roland D2, Roland MC-307, Roland MC-909 and the Roland MC-808. Features The key features of the MC-303 are: * Sound generator with 24 note - voice polyphony based on the structure model of Roland JV-80 synthesizer * 8-track sequencer (7 pitched instruments and 1 drum kit) * 8 part timbrality * 448 preset sounds and 12 drum kits (includes the Roland CR-78, TR-808, TR-606 & TR-909) * Reverb/delay and chorus/flanger effects * 300 onboard dance music variation patterns such as drumbeats and basslines * Recording length of up to 32 bars per pattern * Instant storage of up to 50 user patterns, 300 pattern variations and 10 songs * Storage space for up to approximately 14,000 notes * MIDI in and out connections (but no MIDI thru) Synthesizer/Sound Module The synthesizer built into the Roland MC-303 is a rompler which contains sounds largely drawn from classic Roland synths and drum machines such as the TB-303, TR-808 and TR-909 along with the Juno series and various other dance themed sounds such as pads, pianos, strings and vinyl scratches. The sounds can be manipulated with a low-pass filter, various modulation capabilities and some simple DSP effects. It doesn't have a sampler, although the instruction book contains instructions for getting it to control an external sampler. Sequencer The most important part of the MC-303 is its built-in pattern based 8 track sequencer. Each pattern can contain up to 32 bars. It can record and send MIDI data via the MIDI jacks on the rear panel, enabling its internal sequencer to control other sound modules, or its internal sound module to be controlled by an external sequencer. Although communication with other devices is possible, the main advantage to the MC-303 with its small form factor and all-in-one design is the ability to use it as a self-contained studio, albeit an amateur one. Featuring a micro-keyboard that can also be used as a drum sequencer, the MC-303 imitates the handling as well as the look and feel of other famous Roland synthesizers and drum machines such as the MC-202, TB-303, TR-808 and TR-909. Supply problems Roland apparently underestimated the demand for the new module with the result that many did not receive the modules until months after its launch. Criticisms One criticism made of the machine in various reviews, including the August 1996 issue of Sound on Sound magazine, was that the sound module was essentially limited to only playing built-in preset sounds, discouraging innovation. From a more technical perspective, a major concern was that any knob tweaks made during real time recording were not transmitted via MIDI. The number of preset patterns (mostly aimed for Trance and Techno music) outweighed the number of programmable user patterns which also discouraged innovation. Roland responded in part to these criticisms in its later grooveboxes by solving the MIDI problem, increasing the synthesis capabilities and user pattern storage and adding a sampler section.

Life He was born in Khalkhal in Ardabil province, Iran. He had lived in the Caucasus in the early 20th century and was introduced to Marxism during this period. He was a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. He was a founding member of the Communist Party of Iran (not to be confused with the Tudeh Party), established in 1920, in Rasht. He became a journalist and communist activist in the 1920s. In 1921, Pishevari served the Soviets as minister of the interior in the Persian Socialist Soviet Republic. He was arrested and imprisoned during nine years in the late 1930s and early 1940s by the government of Reza Shah Pahlavi for his communist ideas and activities. He was released from prison after Reza Shah was deposed by the Allies in 1941. He was the Tudeh Party of Iran candidate for the Majlis and was elected, but was denied entry by the rest of deputies. Of the 100 votes cast, his credentials were rejected 47‚Äì50. He then established the Azerbaijani Democratic Party with manifest material and organizational support from the USSR. Political career The Soviet Union founded the communist Azerbaijan People's Government in November 1945 during their occupation of Northern Iran, making Pishevari its leader. It seems however that the strong man of this government was Mohammed Biriya, Minister of Propaganda and head of a secret police trained by the NKVD. His government's actions, including organizing and arming local militias, disarming of regular Iranian military and police forces, setting up an independent judiciary based on the Soviet legal system, nationalising banks, levying taxes, land reform without ratification of the Majlis, using Azerbaijani as the official language and banning the usage of Persian, and setting up an alternative curriculum and educational system, were viewed with deep suspicion by the central government and other Iranians. Following an agreement reached between the governments of Iran and the USSR under intense American pressure, who viewed Pishevari's government as a not-too-subtle scheme by the USSR to partition Iran, Soviets removed their protection. Iranian armed forces, kept away from the provinces of Azerbaijan and Kurdistan by the Red Army presence since 1942, entered these provinces in November 1946. Pishevari's self-proclaimed government collapsed quickly, as many of the people welcomed the central government's troops. By December 1946, both Azarbaijan and Kurdistan were evacuated by the Soviet forces and the Iranian government re-established control over the USSR-occupied territories. It appeared as if Pishevari's government was becoming very unpopular, especially in larger cities where the merchants feared communism. After the collapse of this short-lived republic, he fled to Azerbaijan SSR and died in a car crash in Baku in 1947. Some historians speculate that he was killed by the KGB. To date, their claim has not been verified. His legacy is a matter of heated debate today. While many Iranians consider him as either a Soviet stooge or a traitor, he is considered a national hero for Azeri nationalists or a socialist revolutionary by the Iranian Left. It is now beyond doubt that he had the support of Joseph Stalin and the USSR in setting up his government. There is also no doubt that USSR indeed wanted to annex several provinces in northern Iran. Available sources show that Soviet territorial aspirations included provinces of Azerbaijan, Kurdistan, Gilan, Mazandaran, and Khorasan. What Pishevari intended to achieve and his role in the Soviet plans is a matter of debate though. Some scholars on the Left argue that he never intended to partition Iran and what he wanted was a gradual transformation of the whole country to a communist state. Those on the Right argue that the proclamations and directives issued by his person and his government leave no doubt that he intended to join his republic to the Azerbaijan SSR, and thus the Soviet Union.

They are described as an offshoot of the evolutionary process that created sentient life on Earth. The original instigators of this process, the alien Celestials, intended the Eternals to be the defenders of Earth, which leads to the inevitability of war against their destructive counterparts, the Deviants. The Eternals were created by Jack Kirby, and made their first appearance in The Eternals #1 (July 1976). The Eternals will debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with their own feature film Eternals, scheduled to release on November 5, 2021. Publication history In 1970, Jack Kirby left Marvel Comics to work at DC Comics, where he began the saga of the New Gods, an epic story involving mythological and science fiction concepts, and planned to have a definite ending. However, the saga was left incomplete after the cancellation of the titles. Kirby then began working on The Eternals when he returned to Marvel. The Eternals' saga was thematically similar to the New Gods', and the series was also eventually canceled without resolving many of its plots. Writers Roy Thomas and Mark Gruenwald used the Eternals in a Thor storyline that climaxed in Thor #301,Thor Annual #7 (1978) and Thor #291-301 (May 1979 - Nov. 1980) resolving those lingering plotlines. Subsequent to the Thor storyline, the Eternals (and the mythology connected to them) have appeared or been mentioned in numerous Marvel comics. In particular, the Celestials' experiment on humanity has been used to explain how certain humans can develop super-powers. The Titanians (created by Jim Starlin) and Uranians (created by Stan Lee)Marvel Boy #1 (Dec. 1950) were later retconned as being Eternals as well. The Eternals returned for a 12-issue miniseries in 1985 under writer Peter B. Gillis and penciler Sal Buscema.Eternals (Marvel, 1985 series) at the Grand Comics Database.

Fictional history When the Celestials visited Earth one million years ago and performed genetic experiments on early proto-humanity, they created two divergent races: the long-lived Eternals, and the genetically unstable and monstrously grotesque Deviants. These experiments also led to the capacity for super-powered mutations in humans. They also performed this experiment on other planets (such as the Kree and Skrull homeworlds) with similar results. Despite looking human, Eternals are much longer-lived (but were not originally fully immortal) and that kept them from having much contact with their human cousins. Eternals have a low birth rate; they can interbreed with humans but the result is always a normal human (although Joey Athena, son of Thena and a normal human seems to have become an Eternal with long lived properties and powers).Eternals Volume 4 Issue 9 Despite this, the Eternals have in general protected the human race, especially from the Deviants, with whom they've always had an enmity. The Eternals also developed advanced technology. Long ago, a civil war broke out amongst the Eternals over whether to conquer the other races, with one faction led by Kronos and the other by his warlike brother, Uranos. Kronos's side prevailed, and Uranos and his defeated faction left Earth and journeyed to Uranus where they built a colony. Some of Uranos's group soon tried to return to Earth to re-kindle the war, but they were attacked by a passing Kree ship and forced to land on Saturn's moon Titan. There they built another colony. (Experiments performed by Kree scientists on a captured Eternal led them to go to Earth and perform their own genetic experiments on a group of humans, thus creating the Inhumans.) One day, Kronos's experiments in cosmic energy caused a catastrophic release of energy throughout the Eternals' city, Titanos, destroying it, activating latent genes in the Eternals, and disintegrating the scientist's body. The Eternals now found they could channel large quantities of cosmic energy themselves, granting them near-godlike power. The accident left Kronos in an immaterial state, so a new leader had to be chosen. For the first time, the Eternals merged into a single being, the Uni-Mind, to decide which of Kronos's sons, Zuras or A'lars should be the new leader. Zuras was chosen to be the Prime Eternal, and A'lars chose to leave Earth to avoid causing another civil war, and journeyed to Titan. There he found that a war (allegedly caused by the Dragon of the Moon) had erupted on Titan and wiped out all but one member, a woman named Sui-San. A'lars fell in love with her, and in time they repopulated Titan. Due to the mix of activated genes from A'lars and unactivated ones from Sui-San, these new Titanian Eternals are not as powerful or immortal as Terran Eternals, but are more powerful and longer-lived than the earlier pre-civil war Titanian Eternals. While Zuras ruled, three new Eternal cities were built. The first was Olympia, located in the mountains of Greece, near the main portal between the Earth dimension and the Olympians' home dimension, which led many ancient Greeks to confuse some of the godlike Eternals with members of the Olympian pantheon. Eventually, an agreement was reached with the gods where some Eternals, such as Thena, would impersonate the Olympians before their worshipers. The other two Eternal cities were Polaria (located in Siberia) and Oceana (in the Pacific). 18,000 years ago, the Celestials returned to Earth. The Deviants attacked them, but the Celestials counterattacked, resulting in the sinking of Mu and Atlantis, and much worldwide havoc. The Eternals helped rescue many humans. An Eternal named Valkin was entrusted by the Celestials with an artifact of great power for safekeeping. At some point during the early centuries, Ikaris and the Eternals came into conflict with the immortal mutant, Apocalypse. This conflict ended when Ikaris and the Eternals defeated him. Ikaris believed Apocalypse was dead. 1,000 years ago, the Asgardian god Thor encountered some Eternals, but the encounter was erased from his mind, to prevent him from learning about the Celestials, who were about to return to Earth. An Eternal named Ajak became the Celestials' spokesperson, and put himself to sleep when the Celestials left, to wait for their return 1,000 years later to judge humanity. During the early 20th century, a human scientist made contact with the Uranian Eternals and was taken to live with them along with his young son, who would later become Marvel Boy.Marvel Boy #1 (Dec. 1950) The Uranians were eventually killed by Deathurge.Quasar #2 (November 1989) After World War II, some Eternals allied with humans and Deviants to form the Damocles Foundation, which tried to create a new breed of superhuman to rule Earth.X-Force #79 (1998) Some Eternals, such as Makkari, were also active as superheroes, or living amongst humans, keeping their true nature hidden. The Eternals also helped to move the Inhumans' city to the Himalayas to keep it hidden. At some point, Thanos of the Eternals of Titan nearly destroyed their colony, but they rebuilt it, and would help Earth's heroes to oppose him on several occasions. Modern Age In recent times, Ikaris meet the archaeologist Daniel Damian and his daughter Margo, and accompanied them into a old Eternal city in the Andes, where he awakened Ajak. Ajak began the process to receive the Celestials. These movements alerted the Deviants, who decided to attack New York and to provoke fear in the humans against the coming celestials.Eternals Vol. 1 #1-4. Marvel Comics. When the Celestials returned to judge the worthiness of their creations a few years ago, the Eternals found themselves clashing with the Deviants again, and decided to publicly reveal their existence to humanity. Eternals Vol. 1 #5-10. Marvel Comics. Zuras feared what would happen if the Celestials judged unfavorably. They encountered Thor again, and were attacked by Thor's father Odin and the Olympian gods, who tried to prevent their interfering with the gods' plans to attack the Celestials. Eventually, the Eternals decided to help the gods and formed a Uni-Mind to assist the Destroyer's assault on the Celestials.Thor Vol. 1 #284-301. Marvel Comics. They were forced to dissolve back into Eternals by the Celestials, and the shock of the attack killed Zuras. Before his spirit fully left the material plane, he instructed his daughter Thena to take his people to explore space. Since then, the Eternals have helped Earth's heroes, particularly the Avengers, against several menaces. They also discovered the existence of the Titanian Eternals.Avengers Vol. 1 #246-248. Marvel Comics. Some time later, the Deviant's aristocracy, led by Brother Tode, attacked Olympia, kidnapping the Eternals and intending to disintegrate them. The hero Iron Man (James Rhodes) rescued the Eternals and helped them defeat the deviants. Then the Eternals transformed the deviant's aristocracy into a synthetic cube, killing them. Iron Man Annual Vol. 1 #6. Marvel Comics. The Eternals formed a Unimind to discuss their future on earth, after which most of the Eternals (led by Valkin), went to the stars. But a handful ‚Äì those most heavily involved in Earthly affairs ‚Äì remained behind on Earth.Avengers Vol. 1 #248. Marvel Comics. Thena came to lead the remaining Eternals but she wasn't very respected by her subjects.Eternals Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics. With the ascensi√≥n of Priestlord Ghaur as leader of the Deviants, the Eternals joined the Avengers in defeating him after he absorbed the power of a Celestial and tried to gain godhood. Meanwhile Ikaris questioned Thena for her poor choices as leader of the Eternals. She was subtly being controlled by a brain mine put in her by Kro. After a special ceremony, Ikaris succeded her as leader of the Earth's Eternals. The lover of Ikaris, Margo Damian, was captured by Ghaur's minions and was killed as a result of a deviant experiment on her.Eternals Vol. 2 #1-12. Marvel Comics. After the death of his daughter, Daniel Damian decided to take revenge against the Deviants and the Eternals. With the help of ancient Eternal machines, he forged a prophecy to incite war between the two races and transformed Ajak in a murderous monster. When his plan was discovered by the Eternals, Ajak reverted to his original form and regretted the killings that he had committed, so he killed Damian and himself .Eternals:Herod Factor #1. (1991) Marvel Comics. The Eternals Gilgamesh Avengers Vol. 1 #299. Marvel Comics. and Sersi, briefly become part of the Superhero team Avengers.Avengers Vol. 1 #310. Marvel Comics. When Sersi became sick with the Mahd Wy'ry disease, a uncurable degenerating Eternal disease , Ikaris and other Eternals tried to bring her to Olympia and perform a rite of Cleansing. Sersi rejected the idea, on the basis that the ritual was designed to kill the infected Eternal, and solicited his family to perform the Gann Josin bond between her and her lover the Black Knight. Ikaris was furious and performed the bond without consent of the Knight. Avengers #361. (1993) Marvel Comics. Later Thena and other Eternals helped the Avengers in the battle against the Gatherers and Proctor, who was an alternate Black Knight and was who infect Sersi with the Mahd Wy'ry disease for spite.Avengers #374-375. (1994) Marvel Comics. The Eternals fought once more against Ghaur and the Deviants, with the help of the Heroes for Hire.Heroes for Hire Vol. 2 #5-7. (1997) Marvel Comics. Later they were at odds with Apocalypse and briefly posed as a superhero team called the New Breed. The New Eternals: Apocalypse Now #1. (2000) Marvel Comics. Memory loss and the Dreaming Celestial The Eternals began reappearing on Earth in Neil Gaiman's new take on the immortal beings. Most seamed to have no memory of their own history and abilities, except Ikaris, and few records of their previous appearances remain. The Eternal known as Sprite, angered at having to remain an eleven-year-old and unable to grow any further, managed to change reality, inducing collective amnesia in the Eternals as well as distorting their perceptions of history. He used a Unimind with the Dreaming Celestial and other unwilling eternals to achieve his desire, transforming himself in a mortal 11 years old kid.Eternals: vol.3 #5. (2006) Marvel Comics. This can possibly be seen as Gaiman's attempt to retcon some details of the characters; early stories as well as officially published statistics portrayed most of the current generation of Eternals ‚Äì such as Ikaris and Thena ‚Äì as being \\"only\\" several tens of thousands of years old but Gaiman's run describes them as being closer to a million years old. Makkari was working as a medicine intern, Sersi was planning to kickstart her party planner business. Meanwhile Thena was working as a weapons scientist in Stark Industries. She was also married and had a young son. Druig was apparently alive again and he was the Deputy minister of Vorozheika (a fictional post-soviet country). Ikaris contacted Makkari, but he didn't believe the eternal's words about the past and rejected him. Eternals: vol.3 #1. (2006) Marvel Comics. Then, Makkari meet Sersi again, become attracted to her and accompanied her to a party that she was organizing for Druig of Vorozheika. Thena assisted too. In the party, the amnesic eternals are attacked by mercenaries of another faction of Vorozheika government. The reunion of the four eternals triggered a recovery of their powers. Ikaris was captured by two deviants and they were experimenting in ways of destroy his body, until that they seemingly killed him with a particle accelerator. Eternals: vol.3 #2. (2006) Marvel Comics. However, Ikaris was resurrected by a special machine in the Antarctic base of the Eternals. With their returned powers, Druig took control of Vorozheika. Thena frees herself from the mercenaries that captured her and Makkari went to talk to Sprite, who now was a young celebrity. Sprite trapped the amnesic Eternal and told him his plans and the reasons why he did the reality changes.Eternals: vol.3 #3-4. (2006) Marvel Comics. It is uncovered that Ajak was revived too and that he was who contracted the two Deviants. He succeded in awaken an amnesic Zuras. The two Deviants manage to kidnap Sprite, and the trapped Makkari, using him to awaken the Dreaming Celestial, who was under the Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. Upon awakening, the Celestial decides to judge humanity. The Eternals ,now remembering their past, arrive to San Francisco, and realizing that they cannot stop the Celestial leave him be. Makkari is transformed by the Celestial in his spokesman. The Deviants called him Skadrach, and respected him, because the Dreaming Celestial is adored as their god.Sprite is killed by Zuras because of his actions and the rest of Eternals then embark on a quest to go and recruit the other members who have similarly forgotten their true selves due to Sprite's trickery.Eternals: vol.3 #5-7. (2006) Marvel Comics. The Dreaming Celestial told Makkari the reasons of the creation of the Eternals and Deviants, and help him in finding more Eternals. Ajak, jealous of Makkari's new function, manipulated Gilgamesh in killing Makkari. With help of Sersi, Makkari is reborn and the Dreaming Celestial stop a planning autodestruction.Eternals: vol.4 #1-7. (2008) Marvel Comics. Then the Eternals stopped the invasion of the Horde.Eternals vol.4 #8-9. (2008) Marvel Comics. With their numbers completed, and the new information given by the Dreaming Celestial, the Eternals formed another Unimind to decide what to do. They decided to hold themselves apart from the mortal world.Thor:The Deviants Saga #1-5. (2012) Marvel Comics. The Final Host When Celestials literally began \\"raining\\" down on Earth, the Avengers are forced to reunite again and just in time to see the arrival of the Final Host which is composed of Dark Celestials that are each physically unique and were the ones who easily took down their brethren.Avengers (vol. 8) #1 In an attempt to learn more about these new breed of Celestials, Iron Man and Doctor Strange travelled to the Mountains of Greece in order to try to get some answers from The Eternals. When Stark and Strange arrived, there were no signs of life to be found as almost all of the Eternals were dead, with Strange deducing that the wounds were self-inflicted. Only Ikaris was left barely alive and reveals that the Eternals were never meant to protect Humanity as they thought. Instead, they were actually created to \\"cultivate\\" them, as the Celestials saw the human population as a useful pathogen to act as antibodies against the Horde. This discovery drove all Eternals mad which either made them turn against each other or commit suicide. Ikaris is also able to reveal that the only way to prevent the Final Host from unleashing the Horde is the Uni-mind and sends a message into Stark's mind before the last Eternal died.Avengers (vol. 8) #4 Powers and abilities Due to the cosmic energy that suffuses an Eternal's body and the unbreakable mental hold they have over their physiological processes, the Eternals of Earth are effectively immortal. They live for millennia, do not fatigue from physical exertion, are immune to disease and poison, and are unaffected by environmental extremes of cold and heat. Most cannot be injured by conventional weaponry, and even if they somehow are, an Eternal can rapidly regenerate any damage as long as they are able to retain their mental hold over their bodies; this mental bond can be broken. In the 2006 series it was also stated that Eternals are able to absorb oxygen directly from water, and therefore cannot drown. In the same series, Ikaris was plunged into molten metal and experienced great pain, but no physical injury, which the Deviants attributed to a forcefield which protects Ikaris even when unconscious. It is unclear if all Eternals share this degree of protection. At one time, the official limit to the Eternals' durability was such that they could only be permanently destroyed by dispersing their bodies' molecules over a wide area.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Volume #1, Issue 4 This degree of extreme durability was revealed to have increased to a much greater degree; as demonstrated in the 2006 Eternals limited series,Eternals (2006) Issue #2 it is shown that even total molecular dispersal is insufficient to destroy an Eternal. As long as \\"The Machine\\" (a restoration device of Celestial origin; possibly the Earth itself)Eternals (2006), Issue #6 keeps running, any destroyed Eternal will eventually return, as was the case with Ikaris after he was completely vaporized by a particle accelerator as part of a series of \\"experiments\\" performed upon him by the Deviants. This same cosmic energy can be channeled for a number of superhuman abilities. All Eternals are potentially capable of: * Superhuman strength. The limits of their strength can be increased as a result of years of focusing some of their energy towards that purpose. * Projecting concussive blasts, heat, and/or blinding flashes of energy from their eyes and hands * Flight (and levitating others) * Reading/controlling minds * Generating illusions * Teleporting vast distances, though most Eternals prefer not to use this ability as many find it uncomfortable (and according to the 2006 series, it also greatly depletes their store of cosmic energy) * Transmuting objects, altering both their shape and composition. (The extent of this ability can vary from one Eternal to another.) * Forcefield generation providing invulnerability to harm. *In addition, groups of Eternals, as few as three at a time, can initiate a transformation into a gestalt being called the Uni- Mind, a vastly powerful psionic entity that contains the totality of the powers and abilities of all the beings that comprise it. Some Eternals choose to focus on a particular power in order to increase their effectiveness with it. Sersi, for example, has developed the power of transmutation further than any other Eternal. Additionally, some Eternals choose to focus their cosmic energies into other, non-standard abilities. Ikaris, for example, channels cosmic energy to greatly enhance his senses, while the Interloper uses his to generate fear in others, and Makkari uses his cosmic energies for superspeed. Limitations The recent retcon of the Eternals' origins and abilities introduces a significant limitation to their powers, and possibly to their free will, with numerous references to Eternals being \\"programmed\\" or \\"hardwired.\\" They cannot attack their Celestial \\"masters\\" for any reason, whether they make a conscious decision to do so, or are tricked into accidentally striking the beings.Eternals (2006), Issue #4\\"The Incredible Hercules\\" (2008) Issue #3 Any such attempt shuts down the body of the attacking Eternal, and is implied to be an automatic defense mechanism of the Celestials' armor.Eternals (2008), Issue #4 On one occasion, when the Eternals attempted to form a Uni-Mind with the intent of keeping the Dreaming Celestial asleep, they were immediately shut down and discorporated back into their original, individual forms before they could even form a non-aggressive plan of action.\\"Eternals\\" (2006), Issue #5 Eternals can seemingly also not leave the solar system. Furthermore, Eternals are compelled to attack and neutralize any being that attempts to engage any Celestial with hostile intent -- this compulsion extends even to the Dreaming Celestial, whom the Eternals were forced to defend even as they feared that the newly awakened Celestial would destroy all life on the planet. At least as presented in Gaiman's Volume 3, the Eternals are aware of their role on Earth, and the duties and constraints placed on them by the Celestials. Ikaris rather sardonically describes himself as \\"a humanoid-based repair and maintenance unit left behind by unknowable alien gods to make sure that the earth is still here and in good shape when they get back.\\" Zuras phrased the same concept more philosophically: \\"We are the Eternals. We are the court of last resort for humanity and for all living things on Earth. [...] We do not choose sides. Countries are lines in the sand, empires rise and fall. We are timeless. We will still be here tomorrow, and a hundred centuries from now.\\" Members Generations The Eternals are split between five different generationals groups: * First Generation Eternal (those born before the fall of Titanos): Arlok, Astron, Daina, Kronos/Chronos/Chronus, Master Elo, Oceanus, Shastra, Thyrio, Uranos. * Second Generation Eternal (those alive at the time of Chronus's experiment): Mentor (A'lars), Amaa, Cybele, Forgotten One/Gilgamesh, Helios, Perse, Rakar, Tulayn, Valkin, Virako, Zuras. *Third Generation Eternal (those born after Chronos's experiment but before the Second Host): Aginar, Ajak, Arex, Atlo, Domo, Ikaris, Interloper, Mara, Phastos, Sigmar, Thanos, Thena, Veron, Zarin. * Fourth Generation Eternal (those born after the coming of the Second Host, 20,000 years ago): Argos, Ceyote, Chi Demon, the Delphan brothers, Druig, Khoryphos, Makkari, Psykos, Sersi, Kingo Sunen, El Vampiro. * Fifth Generation Eternal (those born after the coming of the Third Host, 3,000 years ago): Aurelle, Sprite, Titanis. Antecedents *Arthur C. Clarke's book Childhood's End from 1953 provided large inspiration, including the idea of \\"Overlords\\" who control Earth's fate and will reveal themselves further after a 50-year waiting period, the idea of demons being humanity's memory of another species, and the \\"Overmind\\" concept which seems to influence the comic's \\"Uni-mind\\". *Erich von D√§niken's book Chariots of the Gods, a 1968 non-fiction best- seller, postulated the concept of alien gods as real. Kirby acknowledged in dialogue with fans of the Eternals that he owed some debt to D√§niken's book. *The Hurricane and Mercury, two characters of Timely Comics, the 1940s predecessor of Marvel, were retconned as being guises of the Eternal Makkari. *Thematically, the Eternals were similar to another Kirby creation, the New Gods ‚Äî another group of ancient godlike beings in an epic struggle with their opposites, with humanity caught in between. The Eternal The Eternal is a series from Marvel's MAX imprint written by Chuck Austen, based on an idea he had been working on for a while: \\"I pitched this back when I first started working at Marvel, but Joe Quesada was against doing it. He saw no future in this particular old Kirby concept.\\" Austen described the plot as involving \\"Ikaeden, the leader of the Eternals, who arrives on Earth at the dawn of man, and evolves humankind from homo-erectus so he can use them as slaves to mine raw materials for the Celestials, his bosses, basically,\\" as well as \\"Kurassus, who is the second-in-command of the mining mission, and who is determined to undermine Ikaeden and kill Ikaeden's precious slave-girl and son.\\" In an interview with Newsarama he gave an outline of his planned plot: Originally planned as an ongoing series, it was cancelled after six issues. Reception Reception of the series was mixed. Peter Sanderson calls it \\"a ghastly mini-series ... which utilized the names like 'Eternal' and 'Celestial' from Kirby‚Äôs series but otherwise had nothing to do with it.\\" Les Bowman on ICv2, replying to specific concerns about the sexual content, said that \\"[m]uch like the Rawhide Kid, Marvel's editorial staff has decided to completely wreck the heritage of a well liked character, or in the case of the Eternals, a group, by perverting it for the reason of free press coverage.\\" Reviews at Comics Bulletin were much more positive, with the one for the final issue saying that the cancellation of the title was \\"a damn shame because it was the only MAX series to live up to the billing of the imprint\\" and that \\"[i]If you want to read a 1980s EPIC style comic buy this issue and all the others that came before, I doubt there will ever be a trade.\\"  Eternals titles  The main Eternals titles include: *Eternals (vol. 1) #1‚Äì19 (written and penciled by Jack Kirby, July 1976 - Jan. 1978) *Eternals Annual #1 (written and penciled by Jack Kirby, 1977) *Thor Annual #7 (September 1978) *Thor (Vol.1 ) #284-301 (June 1979-September 1980) *What If #23-30 (October 1980-September 1981) *Iron Man Annual #6 (November 1983) *Avengers (Vol.1 ) #246-248 (August 1984- October 1984) *Eternals (vol. 2) #1‚Äì12 (limited series, Oct. 1985 - Sept. 1986) *Avengers (Vol.1 ) #308-310 (October 1989- November 1989) *Eternals: The Herod Factor (November 1991) *Avengers (Vol.1 ) #361, 374-375 (Abril 1993, May 1994 -June 1994 ) *Heroes for Hire (Vol.2 ) #4-7 (November 1997, January 1998) *The New Eternals: Apocalypse Now (also known as Eternals: The New Breed) #1 (Feb. 2001) *Eternals (vol. 3) #1‚Äì7 (written by Neil Gaiman, limited series, Jun. 2006 - Feb. 2007) *Eternals (vol 4.) #1‚Äì9, Annual #1 (August 2008 - March 2009) *Hulk (vol 3.) #49 (May 2012) *Thor:The Deviants Saga #2‚Äì5 (February 2012 - May 2012) *Avengers (vol 8.) #4 (September 2018) Others include: *The Eternal #1‚Äì6 (written by Chuck Austen, with pencils by Kev Walker and inks by Simon Coleby, Aug. 2003 - Jan. 2004)  Collected editions  A number of the series featuring the Eternals have been collected into trade paperbacks: *The Eternals (collects Eternals (vol. 1) #1-19 and Eternals Annual #1, 1976‚Äì1978, Marvel Omnibus hardback, 392 pages, July 2006, ) collected as a softcovers: **Volume 1 (collects Eternals (vol. 1) #1-11, softcover, 208 pages, July 2008, ) **Volume 2 (collects Eternals (vol. 1) #12-19 and Eternals Annual #1, softcover, 188 pages, October 2008, ) *Thor: The Eternals Saga: ** Volume 1 (collects Thor Annual #7 and Thor #283-291, softcover, 208 pages, October 2006, ) ** Volume 2 (collects Thor #292-301, softcover, 216 pages, April 2007, ) *Eternals (collects Eternals (vol. 3) #1-7, 2006, softcover, 256 pages, Marvel Comics, July 2008, , March 2007, Panini Comics, , hardcover, 256 pages, May 2007, , April 2007, ) *Eternals: **Volume 1: To Slay A God (collects Eternals (vol. 4) #1-6, softcover, 184 pages, March 2009, ) **Volume 2: Manifest Destiny (collects Eternals (vol. 4) #7-9 and Eternals Annual, softcover, 104 pages, September 2009, ) Awards *2007: Nominated for \\"Best Archival Collection/Project--Comic Books\\" Eisner Award, for Marvel Omnibus collection In other media Film In April 2018, Kevin Feige announced that a film based on the Eternals was being developed for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with a focus on Ikaris and Sersi as its central characters.

The mountain is located on the island of Nordlandet on the western edge of the town of Kristiansund in Kristiansund Municipality in M√∏re og Romsdal county, Norway. Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget, which sits nearby, takes its name from the mountain. For a number of years, Kvernberget and the surrounding area have been popular for hiking and simple mountaineering activities, and the summit is Kristiansund's most popular hiking destination. From the summit, much of the Nordm√∏re district of M√∏re og Romsdal county may be seen in fair weather. A drinking water reservoir is located inside the mountain. Navigation By the early Middle Ages, there was already a need to navigate the ocean north of Nordm√∏re, a long time before 1742, the year Kristiansund became a town. The most important urban area of Nordm√∏re in the Middle Ages was the fishing village of Grip, an island in the ocean north of Kristiansund. For the fishermen in the area, it was important to find their regular fishing places, so they observed the land and used mountains such as Kvernberget and other landmarks to find their way. History Kvernberget seen from NV. L√∏wen√∏rn, a Danish mariner, described this part of the Norwegian coast in 1791-1803\\\\. He tells that Kvernberget was used by the navigators onboard ships just outside Trondheimsleia. He mentions all the mountains on shore: Skarven (on Tustna), Stemshesten, Magnillberget, Freikollen, Qu√¶rn-Bierget (an old-fashioned way to spell Kvernberget), and Plak-Myssen. Name Kvernberget seen from the island Grip. A hand-mill was a tool nearly everyone knew in the Middle Ages. The name Kvernberget is probably a thousand years old, and refers to the mountain's resemblance to a medieval Quern-stone of a form which is still used in North Africa today. Fishermen working in the sea off of the island and fishing village of Grip navigated by the mountain, which they named after the tool they had at home, the hand mill for grinding corn to flour. A lot of mountains along the Norwegian shore are obviously named because they look like something. Bj√∏nnahaugen (the bears hill), on Nordlandet in Kristiansund, looks like a sleeping bear. On Aver√∏ya, west of Kristiansund, is a mountain that is called Bremsneshatten, which is thought to look like a hat. L√∏wen√∏rn calls it Plak-Myssen (a kind of seal), in the Middle Ages it was probably Brimill. The mountain looks like the head of a seal sticking out of the seabed.

These supernatural beings in Slavic religion come in various forms, and the same name of any single being can be spelled or transliterated differently according to language and transliteration system.  Vila  Vilas (Le Villi, 1906) as represented by Bartolomeo Giuliano. Vila (pl. Vily) are another type of supernatural beings, already identified as Nymphs by the Greek historian Procopius; their name comes from the same root as the name of Veles. They are described as beautiful, eternally young, dressed in white, with eyes flashing like thunders, and provided with wings. They live in the clouds, in mountain woods or in the waters. They are well- disposed towards men, and they are able to turn themselves into horses, wolves, snakes, falcons and swans. The cult of the Vilas was still practised among South Slavs in the early twentieth century, with offerings of fruits and flowers in caves, cakes near wells, and ribbons hanged to the branches of trees. Rusalka In Slavic mythology, Rusalka is a water nymph, a female spirit who lives in rivers. In most versions, rusalka is an unquiet being who is no longer alive, associated with the unclean spirit (Nav) and dangerous. According to Dmitry Zelenin, people who die violently and before their time, such as young women who commit suicide because they have been jilted by their lovers, or unmarried women who are pregnant out of wedlock, must live out their designated time on earth as a spirit. Another theory is that rusalki are the female spirits of the unclean dead; this includes suicides, unbaptised babies, and those who die without last rites. (Under this theory, male unclean dead were said to become vodianoi.) Vodianoi, Vodn√≠k Vodyanoy by Ivan Bilibin, 1934 The vodianoi is a male water spirit of Slavic origin. The Czech and Slovak equivalent is called a vodn√≠k, Polish is a wodnik, while Russian is vodianoy. A South Slavic equivalent is vodenjak. He is viewed to be particularly malevolent, existing almost exclusively to drown swimmers who have angered him by their boldness. Reports of his appearance vary; some tales define him as a naked old man, bloated and hairy, covered in slime, covered in scales, or simply as an old peasant with a red shirt and beard. He is also reported to have the ability to transform into a fish. The vodianoi lives in deep pools, often by a mill, and is said to be the spirit of unclean male dead (this definition includes those who have committed suicide, unbaptized children, and those who die without last rites). As previously stated, the vodianoi would drown those who angered him with boasts or insults. However, there was no certain protection, as the spirit was particularly capricious. Peasants feared the vodianoi and would often attempt to get rid of the spirit or, failing that, appease him. The only people who were generally safe from the vodianoi's anger were millers and fishermen. Millers in particular were viewed to be so close to the vodianoi that they often became seen as sorcerous figures. This may be influenced by the belief that millers yearly drown a drunk passerby as an offering to the vodianoi. Fishermen were somewhat less suspect, offering only the first of their catch with an incantation. If a vodianoi favored a fisherman, he would herd fish into the nets.Ivanits, Linda. Russian Folk Belief. M.E. Sharpe, Inc: New York, 1989. Bereginya Bereginyas (Russian), Berehynias (Ukrainian) or Brzeginias (Polish) are obscure fairies mentioned in \\"The Lay of St. Gregory the Theologian of the Idols\\", which has been preserved in a 15th-century Novgorod manuscript. \\"The Lay\\" is a compilation of translations from Greek sources studded with comments by a 12th-century Kievan monk. The text, which seems to have been considerably revised by later scribes, does mention \\"vampires and bereginyas\\" as the earliest creatures worshipped by the Slavs, even before the cult of Perun was introduced in their lands. No detail about \\"bereginyas\\" are given, affording a large field for speculations of every kind. Boris Rybakov connects the term with the Slavic word for \\"riverbank\\" and reasons that the term referred to Slavic mermaids, although, unlike rusalkas, they were benevolent in nature.Boris Rybakov.

The scholar identifies the worship of vampires and bereginyas as a form of \\"dualistic animism\\" practiced by the Slavs in the most ancient period of their history. According to him, the term was replaced by \\"rusalka\\" in most areas, surviving into the 20th century only in the Russian North. After the publication of Rybakov's research, the \\"bereginya\\" has become a popular concept with Slavic neo-pagans who conceive of it as a powerful pagan goddess rather than a mere water sprite. Modern fiction The Winternight trilogy, by Katherine Arden, is inspired by Slavic mythology and includes many characters, such as the Domovoi, the Rusalka and other beings. In Edward Fallon's second book in his Linger series of novels, Trail of the Beast, a rusalka taunts a trio hunting a serial killer. C. J. Cherryh has written three novels, Rusalka, Chernevog and Yvgenie, set in a world inspired by Russian folktales that feature, amongst others, rusalka, vodianoi, and leshyi. In Changes, a novel in the Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher, the fairy Toot-Toot, a Polevoi, is enraged when he is mistakenly called a Domovoi by Sanya, the Russian Knight of the Cross. The videogame Quest For Glory IV: Shadows of Darkness, set in the Slavic countryside of a fictional east-European valley, features several Slavic fairies, including the Rusalka, Domovoi, and Leshy. Catherynne Valente's novel Deathless is set in a fantasy version of Stalinist Russia and features vila, rusalka, leshy, and other Slavic fairies. Dorothy Dreyer's Reaper's Rite series depicts Vila as magical beings of half-faery, half-witch origin. In J. K. Rowling's novel Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Veela are the mascots of the Bulgarian Quidditch Team at the World Cup. Fleur Delacour's grandmother was a Veela and Fleur's wand contains a strand of veela hair. Piers Anthony's Xanth novels include a few Vily, as nature spirits bound to a tree (similar to a dryad) with powers of shapeshifting and cleansing or poisoning water, and extremely quick to anger. Andrzej Sapkowski's Wied≈∫min series as well as the Witcher video games based on it are set in a medieval Slavic fantasy world. Many of the monsters are taken directly from or inspired by Slavic mythology, such as the rusalka, the striga, and the vodyanoi.  Mythical characters, spirits, and creatures  As is common in folklore, there is no standard set of characteristics, or names, and spirits or magical creatures are referred to by many names, often identifying their function or the place or environment of their activity.

It was produced by the Roland Corporation from 1974 to 1990. Background A tape echo device records incoming audio to a loop of magnetic tape, then replays the continuous loop over the playback head before it is erased again by new incoming audio. The first commercial echo unit was the EchoSonic which had its own amplification and a delicate tape mechanism that required frequent attention. The design was further perfected in the Echoplex with adjustable echo delay. It provided a reliable and much smaller, portable package that could be used with any amplifier. In the late 1960s Ikutaro Kakehashi, later the founder of the Roland Corporation, built a tape echo using a short tape loop based on the design of the Echoplex and the EchoSonic; his Ace Tone EC-1 Echo Chamber was the first of a number of models. In 1973, then operating under the Roland brand, Kakehashi introduced the Roland Echo Chamber RE-100 and RE-200, the latter with an added spring reverb. Kakehashi's breakthrough development came in 1974 with the RE-101 and RE-201 Space Echo units, which used the standard 1/4\\" tape of the open-reel variety, but made as one, continuous loop. It uses no reels of any kind; the tape is transported via a capstan drive. The tape loop is contained in a loose, constantly moving jumble in the tape chamber (also known as the tape tank) under a plastic panel which protects the tape and keeps it from getting tangled. The design resulted in lower levels of noise, wow, and flutter, and cut down on tape wear. Replacement tapes were sold as well, named RT-1L.Roland RE-501 Owners Manual, page 4 There are several control dials on the device that alter such aspects as tape speed, repeat pattern (an 11-position rotary switch), one instrument and two microphone inputs, a single analog backlit VU meter for all three inputs, wet/dry mix for both echo and reverb, and intensity (number of repeats), that can be adjusted to a user's liking; and bass/treble controls to EQ the sound of the repeats (not the dry signal), as well as dry and effected \\"Echo\\" output jacks with a switch for output setting (-10, -20, -35db levels.) Used as a delay/echo, the Roland RE-201 is said to produce a potentially unpredictable delay that is warm and gritty sounding. It is also capable of producing a large variety of its own sound effects, even without an input signal (by turning the intensity control to maximum and allowing the unit to self-regenerate, or self-oscillate, while manipulating the tape speed and other controls). In 2010 Roland's guitar effects company, Boss Corporation, introduced a digital modeling pedal of the space echo, the RE-20. Other Roland tape echo units RE-100 The Roland RE-100 Echo Chamber was one of the earliest models of tape delay that Roland produced being released in 1973. Roland had previously been releasing tape delays under the name Ace Tone, these units included the Ace Tone EC-1 (Echo Chamber 1). The Roland RE-100 was released alongside the Roland RE-200 which had the added addition of a spring reverb.Roland RE-100 & RE-200 Operation Manual, page 4 The RE-100 was similar in styling to the later Roland tape delay units, house in a similar black wooden casing. The front panel had a mode selector dial with six different delay settings. For repeat sounds settings 1-3 were used and for more of a 'swelling' sound settings 4-6 could be selected. There were controls for intensity which when turned clockwise would increase the number of echoes. The repeat rate control was used for adjusting the repeat times of the echoes. Controls were also available for the echo volume, this would decide how much effected signal would be heard along with the original signal. There were two controls for the tone of the output signal, these were simple bass and treble controls. The difference that these early units had from later models was the standby switch. This switch controlled the tape movement. When the lever was pushed upwards the tape began moving to activate the echo sound. When the echo was not needed the switch was pushed downwards, the idea of the standby switch was to assure longer lives of the tape heads and the tape itself. RE-200 The Roland RE-200 was released with the addition of a spring reverb. This was the main difference between the RE-100 and the RE-200. The RE-200 was similar in styling to the later Roland tape delay units, house in a similar black wooden casing. The front panel had a mode selector dial with eleven different effect settings. For repeat sounds settings 1-4 were used and settings 5-11 were used for repeat and spring reverb effects. There were controls for intensity which when turned clockwise would increase the number of echoes. The repeat rate control was used for adjusting the repeat times of the echoes. Controls were also available for the echo volume, this would decide how much effected signal would be heard along with the original signal.

This switch controlled the tape movement. When the lever was pushed upwards the tape began moving to activate the echo sound. When the echo was not needed the switch was pushed downwards, the idea of the standby switch was to assure longer lives of the tape heads and the tape itself. The RE-100 and RE-200 were soon replaced by the Roland RE-101 and the Roland RE-201.Roland RE-201 Operation Manual Roland RE-101 (right bottom) and RE-150 (right top) RE-101 The RE-101 was released alongside the Roland RE-201 as part of the second ‚ÄòRE‚Äô range. It replaced the earlier Roland RE-100 model and included improvements to build and quality. It was the basic model of the second range and did not include a spring reverb like the RE-201.Roland RE-101 Owners Manual, page 2 Features included a new free running system that minimized noise, wow and flutter when the internal tape loop was running, this increased the tape life by 6-15 times (up to 300 hours of use). Other new improvements included lower noise levels that improved the sound quality. RE-150 The main differences in the RE-150 compared with the RE 101 are the following: Two playback heads: According to this, the options of the rotary switch are different also, the first three (\\"repeat\\") options are: 1) first head 2) second head, 3) both heads. The three remaining (\\"single\\") options are the same but not affected by the Intensity control. Two outputs: a direct and an echo only output. When only direct output is connected, it gives out dry+echo signal. When both are connected, the direct output gives only the dry signal, the echo only the echo signal, offering this way more options for channeling the signals. RE-301 The Roland RE-301 was a regular RE-201 Space Echo with three additional features: sound on sound recording, allowing it to be used as a looper as well as an echo; an analog chorus circuit; and the ability to control the repeat rate externally by control voltage via foot pedal.Roland RE-301 Owners Manual, page 5 A notable user is guitarist Brian Setzer, for the slapback sound sought after in rockabilly. RE-501 / SRE-555 Roland RE-501 Chorus Echo. The Roland RE-501 was the last tape effect that Roland produced as the introduction of digital delay and reverb was quickly replacing the older style tape effects. It included a newer orange and black livery that fit in with the new range of Roland Rack products, such as the Roland SVC-350 vocoder. Roland also released a rackmount version of the RE-501 known as the SRE-555. The RE-501 was built using Roland's free running tape system that minimized wow and flutter and extended the life of the tape for more than 300 hours of use. It included dual outputs for a three dimensional sound. The outputs included unbalanced, and for the first time, balanced XLR outputs putting it into the professional range of studio effects.Roland RE-501 Owners Manual New to the 501 and 555 was the chorus effect.

Although he initially fought on the side of the English Parliament, he later became a senior officer in the Scottish Army, fighting against Cromwell. He lived at Menstrie Castle, in Menstrie, Clackmannanshire, central Scotland, which he had purchased in 1649. Action in the Civil War James Holborne led a brigade of infantry in the Parliamentarian army of the Earl of Essex at the first Battle of Newbury in 1643. He was with Sir William Waller's army at the Battle of Cropredy Bridge on 29 June 1644. At Stowe St Mary, near Tavistock, in January 1645, Sydenham House, a large Elizabethan mansion on the banks of the River Lyd, then being garrisoned for the King, was taken by Colonel Holborne. In April that year, Holborne was offered command of a regiment of foot in the New Model Army, but like several prominent Scottish and Presbyterian officers, he declined. Holborne was a Major General by 1645, when he was nominated, with the Earl of Leven, and Lord Kirkcudbright, as a deputation from the Convention of Estates, the most powerful party in Scotland at that time, to open negotiations with Oliver Cromwell, whose army was then at Berwick. On 4 October 1648 Cromwell made his first visit to Edinburgh. The Lord Kirkcudbright and Major General Holborne conducted him into the city, where he was lodged in the Earl of Moray's house in the Canongate. By the autumn of 1650, James Holborne was fighting against Cromwell at the Battle of Dunbar. After the defeat of the Covenanting army by Cromwell at Dunbar, Charles II had been crowned by Argyll at Scone in Scotland, assuming personal command of the Scottish army, he managed to restrain Cromwell at Stirling for a month. Cromwell tried to turn the Scottish flank by sending a force under Colonel Overton into Fife. To defeat this attempt, Charles sent forward a contingent under two officers, Brown and James Holborne of Menstrie, with twelve hundred horse and fifteen hundred infantry, and on Sunday 20 July a battle took place on the north shore of the Forth at Inverkeithing. In that encounter, Holborne showed himself uncertain of his new allegiance. At the beginning of the battle Holborne fled with his cavalry, and although Brown, with a small force of infantry under Sir Hector Maclean and Sir George Buchanan fought bravely, they were defeated, the army being 'cut to pieces'. Major General Holborne later arrived at Ardvreck Castle, Sutherland, as escort for James Graham, Marquis of Montrose, who was held captive by Neil Macleod after his defeat at Carbisdale, to be led to Edinburgh by a troop of horse by order of General David Leslie to meet his judges and his death on 4 May 1650. On 5 May, Montrose thus begun his long and humiliating captive journey, and on 6 May, Major General Holborne took shelter at Skibo Castle, the home of the dowager Lady Gray. Lady Gray, being loyal to the King, requested Montrose to be seated next to her at dinner. Major General Holborne insisted on a strict military order to affairs, and placed the Marquis between himself and another officer. With this breach of etiquette, the Lady Gray flew into a violent rage, and seizing upon a leg of roasted mutton by the shank she confronted the Major General with \\"such a notable blow on his head, knocking him of his seat.\\" The officers took alarm, expecting an attempt to rescue their prisoner. Lady Gray promptly reminded them that they were her guests and as such, as gentleman they should accommodate themselves to such an adjustment of place at her table, as she considered to be correct. Order having been restored, mutton replaced to the table, every possible civility was thereafter directed by all present toward the Marquis. On 7 May, Montrose was ferried across Dornoch Firth to Tain, where General David Leslie took personal command of the procession. Montrose was led down the east coast of Scotland on the long journey toward Edinburgh, where he was met at the town‚Äôs Watergate and the sentence of hanging, drawing and quartering was pronounced. Family Major General Holborne was a relation of Sir Robert Holborne, the attorney general of King James I. A \\"James Holburn\\" is recorded as having married Helen Millar on 29 July 1680 at Muthill, Perthshire in Scotland. A reference in the International Genealogical Index records a second marriage, to Margaret Gordon, which took place on 30 August 1682 at Monimail, Fife. Holborne's son, also named James, was admitted as advocate on 23 November 1714, becoming thereafter an Examiner in the Exchequer. This James was married at first to Janet Inglis of Cramond, and later to Jean, the daughter of Alexander Spital of Leuchat. His son, another James, was created a baronet in 1706, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. Among the descendants of Major General Holburne are Sir Alexander Holburn, 3rd Baronet, Vice-Admiral Sir Francis Holburne, and Thomas William Holborne, founder of the Holburne Museum of Art in Bath, all of whom served in the Royal Navy.

From a background in the commercial world, he became well-connected, and rose to public office and a prominent position in Parliament. After an early interest in radical politics, he built a career in chancery cases, and then turned to amelioration of the British criminal law. Early life Romilly was born in Frith Street, Soho, London, the second son of Peter Romilly, a watchmaker and jeweller, and his wife Margaret Garnault, daughter of Aim√© Garnault, another jeweller. He was largely self-educated. Romilly had Sir Samuel Fludyer, 1st Baronet as godfather and first cousin once removed, and prospects for entering his business; but Sir Samuel died in 1768, followed by his brother Sir Thomas in 1769, and the opportunity fell away . He served for a time in his father's shop. He became a good classical scholar, and was conversant with French literature. The family was Huguenot, and spoke French at home. They attended the French Protestant Chapel in Soho, where John (Jean) Roget from Geneva was pastor. Roget introduced Romilly to the works of Jean Jacques Rousseau, and he became a follower. Romilly was articled in 1773 to William Michael Lally, a chancery solicitor. Lally worked in the Six Clerks office of the Court of Chancery. Romilly after five years turned down the possibility of purchasing his post there. Legal career In 1778 Romilly decided on a career as barrister, and entered Gray's Inn. He was a pupil of Jeffries Spranger, an equity draughtsman. Called to the bar in 1783, he went the Midland circuit, but was mostly occupied with chancery practice. His practice at the chancery bar grew, and in 1800 he was made a King's Counsel. In 1805 he was appointed chancellor of the county palatine of Durham. Travels and associations, radical period Memoirs of Sir Samuel Romilly, 1840 First continental tour In the legal vacation of 1781, Romilly made a tour in France and Switzerland. He had the family connection with Geneva, through John Roget, now his brother-in-law. Roget, who died in 1783, moved back there for his health, and Romilly brought out the young Peter Mark Roget to be reunited with his parents. In Geneva Romilly also met Pierre √âtienne Louis Dumont. Staying for a period with David Chauvet, one of the progressive group of local politicians, Romilly met also the like-minded Etienne Clavi√®re, Jacques-Antoine Douveray and Etienne Reybaz. A friend from the Paris leg of this visit was Marguerite Madeleine Delessert (1767‚Äì1839), later Madame Gautier. She had had Rousseau as a family friend, her mother being Madeleine Catherine Boy de La Tour who married Etienne Delessert (1735‚Äì1816). She became the wife of the Genevan banker Jean-Antoine Gautier (1756‚Äì1800), who moved to Paris. Romilly stayed at the Delessert home in Passy. Second continental tour In 1783, immediately after being called to the bar, Romilly made a second tour. This time he was accompanied in France by John Baynes, and met Benjamin Franklin at Passy, to whom Baynes had an introduction from John Jebb. In Lausanne he met the Abb√© Raynal. In the meantime, the failed Geneva Revolution of 1782 had occurred. Romilly was introduced in 1784 to Honor√© Mirabeau, by the Genevan writer Fran√ßois d'Ivernois, as his Memoirs state; Halevy says it was through Thomas Brand Hollis. D'Ivernois and Dumont formed part of the group of the revolution's leaders who by then were exiles in London. Mirabeau saw him daily for a long time. Bowood circle The Marquess of Lansdowne, to 1784 William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne and Prime Minister in 1782‚Äì3, invited Romilly to Bowood House, around 1784‚Äì5. He had heard Romilly's name from Mirabeau, had read the pamphlet A Fragment on the Constitutional Power and Duty of Juries upon Trials for Libels by Romilly, and was interested in Dumont. In what has been called the Bowood circle, Jeremy Bentham, with whom Romilly was acquainted, became a friend, and he had much to do with Benjamin Vaughan, another friend. French Revolution and its era In 1789 Romilly visited Paris, and studied the course of the French Revolution there, also visiting the dungeon at Vincennes where Mirabeau had been confined. When Mirabeau became a political leader, it was to Romilly that he applied for an account of the procedure used in the House of Commons of Great Britain. He left France with less optimism about the politics of the Revolution. Romilly's abilities were recognized by the Whig party. The Marquess of Lansdowne offered him in 1792 the parliamentary seat of , which Romilly turned down. In July 1793 he defended Birmingham booksellers who had sold Tom Paine's works, despite thinking Paine was lacking in arguments; and in August of that year attended the sedition trial of Thomas Muir, which he regarded as shocking. By the end of 1793 Romilly had concluded that French revolutionary politics amounted to \\"barbarism\\". He explained in 1794 to his correspondent Madame Gautier that \\"public events\\" had brought about his change of views. In August 1797 he secured the acquittal of the radical John Binns. During the Peace of Amiens, Romilly was in Paris. He visited the Palais Bourbon, where the Legislative Assembly met, with Bentham. Political career In 1806, on the accession of the Ministry of All the Talents to office, Romilly was offered the post of Solicitor General, although he had never sat in the House of Commons. He accepted, was knighted, and was brought into parliament for Queenborough. He went out of office with the government, but remained in the House of Commons, sitting successively for Horsham, Wareham and Arundel. Romilly's reforming efforts made his reputation. In 1818, he was returned at the head of the poll for the city of Westminster. He had not much longer to live. Abolitionist Romilly was a vocal opponent of the slave trade. His interest came early in life, by the time of his meeting in 1783 with the Abb√© Raynal, whose Histoire des deux Indes he had read. He gave his support to William Wilberforce's abolition campaign. During the parliamentary debate on the Slave Trade Bill, Romilly paid tribute to Wilberforce, saying that his leadership had \\"preserved so many millions of his fellow creatures.\\" As he concluded his remarks, Romilly was greeted with a standing ovation by other Members of Parliament, a reaction that very rarely occurred in the House of Commons. Wilberforce himself sat with his head in his hands, tears streaming down his face. Legal reformer Romilly worked to reform the criminal law, under the influence of what is now called Classical criminology. He spent a dozen years of his life on the passage through Parliament of legislative reforms. He argued against the attitudes to punishments of Martin Madan and William Paley. The so-called Bloody Code of justice was, in his view, something that required reform, while, as he stated in his Memoirs, one effect of the French Revolution was to lessen the chances of Parliament passing the necessary legislation. The tide of opinion, however, was beginning to turn. In 1808, Romilly managed to repeal the Elizabethan statute which made it a capital offence to steal from the person. Successful prosecutions of pickpockets then rose. Charles Williams-Wynn, on the other hand, saw Romilly's background in equity law, and discrete bills, as inadequate. In 1809, three bills for repealing draconian statutes were thrown out by the House of Lords under the influence of Lord Ellenborough. Romilly saw further bills rejected; but in March 1812 he had repealed a statute of Elizabeth I making it a capital offence for a soldier or a mariner to beg without a pass from a magistrate or his commanding officer. In 1813 John William Ward found the approach too \\"philosophical\\". Romilly failed to pass a law which would have abolished corruption of blood for all crimes, but in the following year he tried again and succeeded (except for treason and murder). Also in 1814 he succeeded in abolishing hanging, drawing and quartering. Seeing a connection, Romilly also advocated prison reform in 1811. Here, however, reform in the direction proposed by Jeremy Bentham was thwarted.

Life He was the son of Judith Madan the poet, and Colonel Martin Madan, and was educated at Westminster School, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated in 1746. In 1748 he was called to the bar, and for some time lived a very uninhibited life. He was persuaded to change his ways on hearing a sermon by John Wesley. He took holy orders, and was appointed chaplain to the London Lock Hospital. He was closely connected with the Calvinistic Methodist movement supported by the Countess of Huntingdon, and from time to time acted as an itinerant preacher. He was a first cousin of the poet William Cowper, with whom he had some correspondence on religious matters. In 1767, much adverse comment was aroused by his support of his friend Thomas Haweis in a controversy arising out of the latter's possession of the living of All Saints Church, Aldwincle, Northamptonshire. Madan resigned his chaplainship and retired to Epsom. Works In 1760 Martin Madan published for the Lock Hospital a collection of Psalms and Hymns extracted from various Authors, and in 1769 supplemented it by the issue of A Collection of Psalms and Hymn Tunes, many of the tunes in which came into general use.James Moffatt, Handbook to the Church Hymnary, Oxford University Press, 1927, p. 404 In 1780, Madan raised a storm of opposition by the publication of his Thelyphthora, or A Treatise on Female Ruin, in which he advocated polygamy as the remedy for evils he deplored. His arguments were based mainly on scriptural authority; but his book caused many angry replies. Amongst them was 'Anti-Thelyphthora' by his first cousin, the poet William Cowper, which he published anonymously. A fictional account of this event can be read in The Winner of Sorrow, a 2005 novel about the poet by Brian Lynch. Nineteen attacks on Madan's treatise are catalogued by Falconer Madan in the Dictionary of National Biography.Among those, many of which were anonymous were: magazine articles by Samuel Badcock in the Monthly Review; ‚ÄòPolygamy Indefensible, two Sermons by John Smith of Nantwich,‚Äô 1780; ‚ÄòPolygamy Unscriptural, or two Dialogues, by John Towers,‚Äô 1780 (2nd edit. 1781); ‚ÄòWhispers for the Ear of the Author of ‚ÄúThelyphthora,‚Äù by E.

He is chiefly remembered as the French editor of the writings of the English philosopher and social reformer Jeremy Bentham. Early life Dumont was born in Geneva, where his family had been citizens of good repute from the days of Calvin. He was educated for the ministry at the Coll√®ge de Gen√®ve, and in 1781 was chosen one of the pastors of the city. Then politics suddenly turned the course of his life. He belonged to the liberals or democrats, and the triumph of the aristocratic party, through the interference of the courts of France and Sardinia, made continued residence in Geneva impossible, though he was not among the number of the proscribed. He went to join his mother and sisters in St Petersburg. In this he was probably influenced in part by the example of his townsman Pierre Lefort, the first tutor, minister, and general of the Tsar. At St Petersburg he was for eighteen months pastor of the French church. Move to England In 1785 he moved to London, Lord Shelburne, then a minister of state, having invited him to undertake the education of his sons. It was at the house of Lord Shelburne, now 1st marquess of Lansdowne, where he was treated as a friend or rather member of the family, that he became acquainted with many illustrious men, amongst others Fox, Sheridan, Lord Holland and Sir Samuel Romilly. With the last of these he formed a close and enduring friendship, which had an important influence on his life and pursuits. In 1788 Dumont visited Paris with Romilly. During a stay of two months in that city he had almost daily intercourse with Mirabeau, and a certain affinity of talents and pursuits led to an intimacy between two persons diametrically opposed to each other in habits and in character. Editing Bentham On his return from Paris Dumont made the acquaintance of Jeremy Bentham. Filled with admiration for Bentham's genius, Dumont made it one of the chief objects of his life not merely to translate Bentham into French, but to recast and edit his writings in a form suitable for the ordinary reading public. Dumont's editing was heavy-handed, but necessarily so. According to his own account, all the fundamental ideas and most of the illustrative material were already in Bentham's manuscripts; but his task was chiefly to abridge by striking out repeated matter, to supply lacunae, to secure uniformity of style, and to improve the French. Bentham's writing (whether in English or in French) was notoriously convoluted and impenetrable, and according to one reviewer, writing in 1817, \\"[i]t is indeed when he speaks by another‚Äôs lips, that he appears to most advantage; and it to the graces of style which Mr Dumont has given him that he owes the reputation which he has acquired, and which is, from that cause, much greater in foreign countries than in his own. ... [I]t is possible that, but for Dumont, Bentham‚Äôs reputation might never have emerged from obscurity.\\" In places, Dumont was also prepared to oversimplify Bentham's ideas, and indeed to contradict them, for example where he considered that Bentham had been over-critical of the British constitution, or had expressed religious scepticism. The following works of Bentham were published under Dumont's editorship: *Trait√© de legislation civile et p√©nale (1802) *Th√©orie des peines et des recompenses (1811) *Tactique des assembl√©es legislatives (1815) *Trait√© des preuves judiciaires (1823) *De l'organization judiciaire et de la codification (1828) French Revolution In the summer of 1789 Dumont went to Paris. The object of the journey was to obtain through Jacques Necker, who had just returned to office, an unrestricted restoration of Genevese liberty, by cancelling the treaty of guarantee between France and Switzerland, which prevented the republic from enacting new laws without the consent of the parties to this treaty. The proceedings and negotiations to which this mission gave rise necessarily brought Dumont into connection with most of the leading men in the Constituent Assembly, and made him an interested spectator, sometimes even a participator, indirectly, in the events of the French Revolution. The same cause also led him to renew his acquaintance with Mirabeau, whom he found occupied with his duties as a deputy, and with the composition of his journal, the Courrier de Provence. For a time Dumont took an active and very efficient part in the conduct of this journal, supplying it with reports as well as original articles, and also furnishing Mirabeau with speeches to be delivered or rather read in the assembly, as related in his highly instructive and interesting posthumous work entitled Souvenirs sur Mirabeau (1832). In fact his friend George Wilson used to relate that one day, when they were dining together at a table d'h√¥te at Versailles, he saw Dumont engaged in writing the most celebrated paragraph of Mirabeau's address to the king for the removal of the troops. He also reported such of Mirabeau's speeches as he did not write, embellishing them from his own stores, which were inexhaustible. But this co- operation soon came to an end; for, being attacked in pamphlets as one of Mirabeau's writers, he felt hurt at the notoriety thus given to his name in connection with a man occupying Mirabeau's peculiar position, and returned to England in 1791. In 1791, Dumont along with the Marquis de Condorcet, Thomas Paine, and Jacques-Pierre Brissot published a brief newspaper promoting republicanism. Later life In 1801 Dumont travelled over various parts of Europe with Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 3rd Marquess of Lansdowne, and on his return settled down to the editorship of Bentham's works. In 1814 the restoration of Geneva to independence induced him to return there, and he soon became leader of the supreme council. He devoted particular attention to the City's judicial and penal systems, and many improvements on both are due to him. Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was an admirer of his, declaring that \\"Dumont...is a moderate liberal, just as all rational people are and ought to be, and as I myself am.\\" Dumont died at Milan while on an autumn tour on 29 September 1829.

The historic stone and brick building was opened on 31 August of that year. The late 1970s saw extensive upgrading of the school facilities under Principal Allan Stanley- Smith, including construction of the Ruth Beare Hall in 1976 named after Ruth Beare who taught at the school from 1937 to 1944 and 1947 to 1975. The Church of the Epiphany, Epiphany Place, Crafers has played a prominent role in the life of the district since it was built in 1878 on land donated by Henry Scott. It has a splendid music tradition, a lively choir and one of the finest pipe-organs in South Australia. The Church of the Epiphany is a favourite church for many couples for their marriage service. View of the Crafers Interchange For many years Crafers was well known for being the start point of the South Eastern Freeway linking Adelaide with the town of Murray Bridge, and to the Princes Highway leading to Melbourne. It wasn't until 2000 that the Heysen Tunnels project was completed to extend the freeway to Glen Osmond on the outskirts of Adelaide. Prior to the tunnel opening, the winding road from Adelaide to Glen Osmond via Eagle On The Hill was frequently the scene of horrific vehicle accidents, often involving semi-trailers. The Mount Lofty Botanic Garden is nestled in the hills behind Crafers. The gardens, opened in 1977, include an extensive mix of European and Australian native plants and are at their finest in the spring months. On 16 February 1983, Crafers was hard hit by the Ash Wednesday bushfires. Many homes adjacent to bushland on the western side of the suburb were destroyed as the fire came roaring out of Cleland Conservation Park, and the devastation would have been much worse if a change in weather had not occurred right when the township of Crafers itself was being threatened. A memorial on Mount Lofty Summit is dedicated to those in the Adelaide Hills who lost their lives that day. Crafers is under the administration of the Adelaide Hills Council, and is in the state electoral district of Bragg and the federal electorate of Mayo. Crafers West is in the state electoral district of Heysen. Transport Crafers is well served by Adelaide Metro bus services throughout the day, every day.

After graduating from a secondary school he went to Novosibirsk, where he entered the Faculty of Pediatrics of the Institute of Medicine. Markin started athletics only at age 19 in the athletics section by the institute, coached by Aleksandr Bukhasheyev. He remained quite unknown until the Moscow Olympic Games. On 27 April 1980, in Sochi, Markin ran a new personal best in the one lap event of 46.96 seconds. In early July Markin ran 45.34 at the Central Lenin Stadium. In the Olympic final on July 30, Markin was only fifth at the halfway mark and as the final straight opened he was still three metres behind the leader Frank Schaffer of East Germany. But with a very strong finish Markin won with a European record and world season best 44.60 (still the Russian national record over 400 m). Markin captured his second gold in the 4 √ó 400 m relay when, as an anchor, he outran the winner of the 400 metre hurdles, East German Volker Beck. After a break from sports to complete his studies in medicine, Markin returned at the European Championships in 1982, where he won two bronze medals (400 m and 4 √ó 400 m relay). At the inaugural World Championships in Helsinki Markin, the only Soviet competing in the individual 400 metres (as the rest were concentrating on the relay), was knocked out of the final in an extremely close photo finish by eventual bronze medalist Sunder Nix of the United States. However, he finished on a high note as in the last event of the Championships, the 4 √ó 400 m relay, the Soviets won an unexpected gold. West Germany already lost their winning chances on the first leg as Erwin Skamrahl (who had broken Markin's European record just three weeks earlier) gave up more than ten meters to Sergey Lovachov; the other main favorites, United States, hung with the Soviets for two and a half legs until Willie Smith tumbled and fell, leaving Markin an easy job to anchor home a USSR victory. Markin decided to retire after hearing the Soviet decision to boycott the 1984 Summer Olympics.

On 26 July 1953, the barracks was the site of an armed attack by a small group of revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro. The attack failed and the surviving revolutionaries were imprisoned. This armed attack is widely accepted as the beginning of the Cuban Revolution. The date on which the attack took place, 26 July, was adopted by Castro as the name for his revolutionary movement (Movimiento 26 Julio or M 26-7) which eventually toppled the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista on 12 January 1959. Preparation Almost all of Fidel Castro's followers were Partido Ortodoxo Youth rank and file of the lower middle class or working class. Only four of the 160 rebels were university graduates and most had only a primary education. Of the 137 insurgents whose ages are known, the average age was 26, the same as that of Fidel Castro. Nine rebels were in their teens, 96 were in their twenties, 27 in their thirties, and five over 40. The Afro-Cuban composition of the group was limited to two blacks and 12 mulattos, partly because most biracial Cubans identified with Batista, who was of mixed blood. Castro avoided recruiting among intellectuals, who were more apt to challenge his ideas.. After Batista's military coup on 10 March 1952, Fidel Castro and his group began to train young men to engage in the struggle, along with other anti-Batista groups, against an illegitimate government. Castro claimed that they trained 1,200 men within a few months, training at the University of Havana and at firing ranges in Havana, disguising themselves as businessmen interested in hunting and clay pigeon shooting. The weapons included forty 12- and 16-gauge shotguns, thirty- five Mosberg and Remington .22 rifles, sixty handguns of various models, a malfunctioning .45 caliber submachine gun, twenty-four rifles of different caliber, including eight Model 1898 Krag-J√∏rgensen rifles, a .30-06 Model 1903 Springfield rifle, three sawed-off 1892 .44-caliber Winchester rifles, and a .30 caliber M1 Garand rifle with a folding metal stock.. Fidel Castro decided that army uniforms were needed for the Moncada attack. He discussed this with Calabazar cell leader Pedro Trigo Lopez (es), who suggested approaching his relative Florentino Fernandez Leon, a 26-year-old military hospital orderly in Jaimanitas. Fernandez agreed and received $200 to purchase surplus uniforms, weapons, and ammunition. He then pilfered from the military hospital laundry most of the blue uniforms needed to attire the rebels.. The night before the attack, the men gathered at a farm in Siboney, where they learned what the objective was. The plan was to secure the barracks and gain possession of the weapons stored within, and to use the building's army communications equipment to spread false messages for several hours to confuse the military. In the meantime, the weapons would be removed and hidden throughout the city to use in the continuing struggle, and Santiago's radio station would be taken to broadcast the speeches of Eduardo Chib√°s, in order to mobilize the public with the ultimate aim of bringing down the Batista government. The men left the farm at 4:45 am on 26 July 1953, planning to attack at dawn. The date of the attack was specifically chosen because the fiestas in Santiago are held on 25 July.. The Attack On 26 July 1953, at 5:00 am, Fidel Castro led a group of 135 rebels (with an additional 24 intending to take the barracks at Bayamo), including his brother Ra√∫l,. in an attack on the second largest military garrison; commanded by Colonel Alberto del Rio Chaviano. The group formed a 16-automobile caravan in order to give the appearance of being a delegation headed by a high-ranking officer sent from western Cuba. Their plan was that a first group of 20 men led by Abel Santamar√≠a would take the civilian hospital at the rear of the barracks, a second group of five men led by L√©ster Rodr√≠guez would take the Audiencia Building (Palacio de Justicia),. and a third group of 90 men, led by Castro, would take the barracks, including the radio transmitter within it. The attack began poorly. The caravan of automobiles became separated by the time it arrived at the barracks, and the car carrying the guerillas' heavy weapons got lost. Furthermore, many of the rebels who would have taken part in the attack were left behind for a lack of weapons. In Castro's autobiography, he claims that he drove his car into a group of soldiers at the gate who had realized an attack was in progress. The men in the cars behind him jumped out of their cars, believing they were inside the barracks, and the alarm was sounded before the barracks had been infiltrated. According to Castro, this was the fatal mistake in the operation.. The net result of these events was the rebels being outnumbered more than 10 to 1. Fifteen soldiers and three policemen were killed and 23 soldiers and five policemen wounded during the attack. Nine rebels were killed in combat and 11 wounded, four of them by friendly fire.. (According to Fidel Castro five were killed in the fighting, and 56 were executed later by the Batista regime.). Eighteen rebels captured in the Civil Hospital were immediately executed in the Moncada small-arms target range within two hours after the attack. Their corpses were strewn throughout the garrison to simulate death in combat.. Thirty-four fleeing rebels captured during the next three days were murdered after admitting their participation. A handful of rebels, including Fidel Castro, escaped into the nearby countryside but were apprehended shortly thereafter.  Trial  The Santiago de Cuba Urgency Tribunal indicted 122 defendants in Case 37 of 1953 to stand trial for 26 July insurrection. Fifty-one of the 99 rebel survivors who were captured were remanded for trial. Six indicted rebels remained hiding. The other 65 defendants implicated throughout the island were mostly political leaders and opposition activists not involved in the rebellion. Fifteen of them, including deposed President Carlos Prio Socarras, Aureliano Sanchez Arango, Jose Pardo Llada, and Communist leader Blas Roca, were underground or in exile and never went to court.. The trial in the Santiago de Cuba Palace of Justice began on 21 September 1953 and ended on 6 October 1953, after eleven sessions. The Cuban Civil Code of Justice, based on the Napoleonic Code practiced in Europe and Latin America, has the verdict determined by a panel of three judges rather than by a jury of peers as under \\"common law\\" in the U.S. and Great Britain. In accordance, after the accused heard the charges against them, they were called to testify on their own behalf. The defendants were represented by 24 attorneys. Fidel Castro assumed his own defense and lied under oath to avoid implicating rebels on trial. During the questioning of rebel witnesses, Castro raised accusations of the murder of prisoners by the military. In consequence, Moncada chief Col. Alberto del Rio Chaviano, impeded Castro from returning to court by claiming that he could not attend due to illness. The tribunal then separated Castro from the proceedings and granted him a separate trial. Nineteen rebels were found not guilty based on lack of evidence and their false testimony. Confessed leaders Ra√∫l Castro, Oscar Alcalde, Pedro Miret, and Ernesto Tizol received 13-year prison sentences. Twenty other rebels received 10-year sentences. Rebels Manuel Lorenzo, Eduardo Rodriguez, and Orlando Cortez Gallardo, who refused to participate in the attack at the last moment, got three-year sentences. Dr Melba Hernandez Rodriguez del Rey and Haydee Santamaria were given seven-month sentences since it was never proven that they handled weapons.. Castro, a qualified lawyer, used his time in prison to prepare a speech entitled \\"History Will Absolve Me\\", which he learned by heart and delivered during his sentencing; he received a 15-year sentence. A carbon copy of the speech was smuggled page by page out of court by the stenographer, who leaked it to a friend from 26 July attack, Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a, and later published it. Aftermath In memory of the attacks (in Cienfuegos). Two years later, in 1955, a group of prisoners' mothers launched a campaign to free Castro and the other rebels imprisoned with him. As popular support for the rebels and opposition to Batista's rule mounted, a group of political leaders, editors, and intellectuals signed a public appeal demanding liberty for the political prisoners. That year, the Cuban Congress passed a bill granting general amnesty to political prisoners. After being signed by Batista, the thirty imprisoned rebels were freed. They served 22 months in prison.. The battle damage to the Moncada Barracks was quickly repaired by the military. After the revolution, the fortress was converted into a school on January 28, 1960. Three weeks earlier, Fidel Castro personally drove the bulldozer that demolished the crenelated outer walls. In 1978, Castro ordered the massive perimeter walls rebuilt and converted half of the main building into July 26 Historical Museum.

On January 1, 1638 it was deemed that a coat of arms was necessary \\"for the greater honor and splendor of that Countrey and the people therein inhabiting.\\" The Original Arms of the Newfoundland granted by Sir John Borough Garter Principal King of Arms, 1637. The original grant describes the arms as follows: > I have accordingly for the purpose before recited devised sett forth and > contrived the Armes & Ensignes hereafter described. That is to say Gules a > Grosse Argent In the first Quarter of the Escocheon a Lyon Passant gardant > Crowned Or In the second an Unicorne passant of the second armed maned and > unguled of the third gorged with a Crowne whereunto is affixed a chaine > passing between his fore leggs and reflexed over his back of the last.

Not long after receiving this grant, a civil war broke out in England. Kirke was a Royalist and on the losing side of the war. Kirke was arrested and died in The Clink in Southwark around the end of January 1654 and the coat of arms granted him was forgotten. It was not used for over 200 years and it appears its existence was unknown to both the Newfoundland and United Kingdom authorities. Instead, the colony used as its Great Seal both the Royal coat of arms and a design which was approved in 1820 and which incorporated a badge depicting the figure of Mercury, the classical god of commerce, presenting to Britannia a fisherman who, kneeling attitude, is offering the harvest of the sea. Below this, the Latin words \\"Haec Tibi Dona Fero\\" meaning \\"These gifts I bring thee\\" appear, and written around the circumference of the seal is \\"Sigillum Terrae Novae Insulae\\" meaning \\"Seal of the Island of Terra Nova\\". In 1893, D.W. Prowse published A History of Newfoundland, in which he printed a copy of the Newfoundland arms. Prowse erroneously attributed the armorial bearings to John Guy, and described the image as the arms of the \\"London and Bristol Company for Colonising Newfoundland\\". The Newfoundland Post Office perpetuated his error by issuing a 1910 two-cent stamp depicting the arms and included attribution to the London and Bristol Company, which financed Guy's colonization attempt. Following the First World War, the Imperial War Graves Commission requested to know which arms should be used on memorials in French cathedrals commemorating Newfoundland and Labrador's involvement. Newfoundland's High Commissioner in England, Sir Edgar Bowring began the search, but it was successor Captain Victor Gordon received confirmation from the College of Arms in London that the Kirke coat of arms belonged to Newfoundland. In 1928 the government of the Dominion of Newfoundland officially adopted this coat of arms. It has been in use ever since, despite the changes in Newfoundland and Labrador's status from Dominion to a colony run by the Commission of Government in 1934, and subsequently to a province of Canada in 1949. The Coat of Arms Act (RSNL 1990, chapter C-20, as amended) provides the current legal authority for the use of the arms. Symbolism Crest :An elk appears standing on a wreath of gold and red to represent Newfoundland's wildlife. Escutcheon :Two silver unicorns and two gold lions occupy opposing quadrants of the shield. This part of the Coat of Arms recalls the royal beasts which appear on the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. The lion represents England and the unicorn represents Scotland. Compartment :A mossy knoll. Supporters :The two supporters are fanciful interpretations of the Beothuk, an Indigenous group from the island of Newfoundland. Motto :Quaerite prime Regnum Dei, quoting Matthew 6:33 from the Bible, \\"Seek ye first the kingdom of God\\". Redesign Starting in the 2010s, the coat of arms has been criticized for its portrayal of indigenous peoples. In 2016, Indigenous artist Jordan Bennett produced a newly commissioned artwork \\"tamiow tle‚Äôowin\\" for the \\"With Secrecy and Despatch\\" exhibition at the Campbelltown Art Centre, Campbelltown, NSW, Australia. The piece focuses on the Newfoundland and Labrador coat of arms and is, according to the artist's statement, \\"a commentary on the exotification, exploitation, and commodification of Indigenous cultures.\\" In 2018, the Newfoundland and Labrador government confirmed its plan to redesign the province's coat of arms, in response to the province's Indigenous Peoples Commission's call for changes in the name of reconciliation. Randy Edmunds, MHA for Labrador's Torngat Mountains and parliamentary secretary for Indigenous Affairs, noted at the same time that elk are not native to Newfoundland and Labrador, and suggested it be replaced with a caribou. News of a potential redesign spawned media polls and tongue-in-cheek suggestions. It also spurred a satirical response from Indigenous newspaper columnist and Qalipu First Nation Councilor Andy Barker: See also *Symbols of Newfoundland and Labrador *Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador *Canadian heraldry *National symbols of Canada *List of Canadian provincial and territorial symbols *Heraldry References  External links  *Coat of arms and flag of Newfoundland and Labrador Online Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges *Coat of arms description. *Coat of arms description. *tamiow tle‚Äôowin indigenous commentary as part of the \\"With Secrecy and Despatch\\" exhibition, Campbelltown Art Centre, Campbelltown, NSW, Australia, Provincial symbols of Newfoundland and Labrador Newfoundland and Labrador Newfoundland and Labrador Newfoundland and Labrador Newfoundland and Labrador Newfoundland and Labrador Newfoundland and Labrador 1638 establishments in Canada ","title":"Coat of arms of Newfoundland and Labrador"},{"id":"705546","text":"A kidnapper is a person who performs a kidnapping.

It is calculated based on an analysis of the horse's pedigree. Interest in determining which sires of race horses transmit raw speed, and which sires transmit stamina (defined as the ability to successfully compete at longer distances) to their progeny dates back to the early 20th century, when a French researcher, Lt. Col. J. J. Vullier, published a study on the subject (called Dosage), which was subsequently modified by an Italian breeding expert, Dr. Franco Varola, in two books he authored, entitled Typology Of The Race Horse and The Functional Development Of The Thoroughbred. However, these observations attracted little interest from the general public until 1981, when Daily Racing Form breeding columnist Leon Rasmussen published a new version of Dosage developed by an American scientist and horse owner, Steven A. Roman, Ph.D., in his analysis of the upcoming Kentucky Derby for that year. The new approach, which was more accessible to owners, breeders and handicappers and was supported by solid statistical data, rapidly caught on, and the term \\"Dosage Index\\" has been a fixture in the lexicon of horse racing ever since. The details of Dosage methodology have been summarized in Dr. Roman's book entitled Dosage: Pedigree & Performance published in 2002. The index itself is compiled by noting the presence of certain influential sires, known as chefs-de-race (French for \\"chiefs of racing\\", or, more esoterically, \\"masters of the breed\\") in the first four generations of a horse's pedigree. Based on what distances the progeny of the sires so designated excelled in during their racing careers (the distance preferences displayed by the sires themselves while racing being irrelevant), each chef-de-race (the list released in the early 1980s identified 120 such sires, and 85 more have been added ) is placed in one or two of the following categories, or \\"aptitudinal groups\\": Brilliant, Intermediate, Classic, Solid or Professional, with \\"Brilliant\\" indicating that the sire's progeny fared best at very short distances and \\"Professional\\" denoting a propensity for very long races on the part of the sire's offspring, the other three categories ranking along the same continuum in the aforementioned order. If a chef-de-race is placed in two different aptitudinal groups, in no case can the two groups be more than two positions apart; for example, Classic-Solid or Brilliant-Classic are permissible, but Brilliant- Solid, Intermediate-Professional and Brilliant-Professional are not. If a horse's sire is on the chef-de-race list, it counts 16 points for the group to which the sire belongs (or eight in each of two categories if the sire was placed in two groups); a grandsire counts eight points, a great-grandsire four, and a great-great-grandsire two (female progenitors do not count directly, but if any of their sires etc. are on the chef-de-race list points would accrue via such sires). This results in a Dosage Profile consisting of five separate figures, listed in order of Brilliant-Intermediate-Classic- Solid-Professional. Secretariat, the 1973 Triple Crown winner, for example, had a Dosage Profile of 20-14-7-9-0. To arrive at the Dosage Index, the first two figures plus one-half the value of the third figure are added together, and then divided by one-half of the third figure plus the sum of the last two figures. In this case, it would be 37.5 (20 + 14+ 3.5) divided by 12.5 (3.5 + 9 + 0), giving Secretariat a Dosage Index of exactly 3.00 (the figure almost always being expressed with two places to the right of the decimal point and rounded to the nearest 0.01). A second mathematical value, called the Center of Distribution, can also be computed from the Dosage Profile. To determine this value, the number of Brilliant points in the profile is doubled, and added to the number of Intermediate points; from this is then subtracted the number of Solid points and twice the number of Professional points. The result is then divided by the total number of points in the entire profile, including the Classic points. In Secretariat's case, this would work out as 54 (40 + 14) minus 9 (9 + 0) divided by 50 (20 + 14 + 7 + 9 + 0), yielding a Center of Distribution of 0.90 (the figure nearly always being rounded to the nearest 100th of a point, as with the Dosage Index). High Dosage Index (and Center of Distribution) figures are associated with a tendency to perform best over shorter distances, while low numbers signify an inherent preference for longer races. The median Dosage Index of contemporary North American thoroughbreds is estimated at 2.40 (the average figure being impossible to calculate because some horses have a Dosage Index of \\"infinity,\\" a scenario which arises when a horse has only Brilliant and/or Intermediate chef-de-race influences in its Dosage Profile). The average Center of Distribution for modern-day North American race horses is believed to be approximately 0.70 (both Dosage Index and Center of Distribution figures tend to be lower for European thoroughbreds because in Europe the races are longer on aggregate and European breeders thus place greater emphasis on breeding their horses for stamina rather than speed). Retroactive research conducted at the time the term \\"Dosage Index\\" first became common knowledge revealed that at that time no horse having a Dosage Index of higher than 4.00 had won the Kentucky Derby since at least 1929 (a year chosen because by then the number of available of chefs-de-race on which to base the figures was thought to have reached a critical mass), and that over the same period only one Belmont Stakes winner (Damascus in 1967) had such a Dosage figure. It was also determined at that time that few horses with no chef-de-race influences in the two most stamina-laden groups, Solid and Professional, had won major races at distances of miles or longer even if the horse had a sufficient Classic presence in its pedigree to keep the Dosage Index from being over 4.00 (when Affirmed won the Triple Crown in 1978, for instance, he became the first horse with no Solid or Professional points in his Dosage Profile to win either the Kentucky Derby or the Belmont Stakes since the 1930s). In recent years, however, several horses with no Solid or Professional chefs-de-race in the first four generations of their pedigrees‚Äîand indeed, a few with Dosage Indexes of above 4.00‚Äîhave managed to win the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes, highlighting the issue of increasing speed and decreasing stamina in contemporary American thoroughbred pedigrees. For example, 1999 Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet had a Dosage Index of 6.02, while 2005 Kentucky Derby winner Giacomo has a Dosage Index of 4.33 and no Solid or Professional points in his Dosage Profile. Triple Crown winner American Pharoah has a Dosage Index of 4.33. As a result of these \\"anomalies,\\" the theory's usefulness has been questioned by some, at least with regard to the Kentucky Derby. The system's defenders, however, point out that in recent times a large proportion of U.S.-bred horses with low Dosage figures have been sent to race in foreign countries where the distances of races are longer, resulting in most horses competing in the Kentucky Derby and similar American races having relatively high Dosage numbers and/or lacking Solid or Professional chef-de-race representation. Yet the statistical foundation of Dosage remains compelling and the theory accurately differentiates Thoroughbred pedigree type for large populations of horses competitively performing over a range of distances, track surfaces and ages.

The heliport, once owned by Westland and then Harrods, is a very small site, making use of a jetty to provide a helipad for take-off and landing, and onshore parking for three to four aircraft, depending upon their size. The heliport provides landing, parking and refuelling services between 08:00 and 21:00 (flights are permitted between 07:00 and 23:00), albeit parking is normally restricted to smaller helicopter categories. A Sikorsky S-76 landing at London Heliport. Battersea Railway Bridge is seen in the background. Flight conditions and procedures at the heliport prescribe a circuit height above the Thames, in an extended figure- of-eight over the water, to seek to minimise noise pollution for residents in the area and to constrain flight operations to over the river, away from the built-up area. Ground running of rotors is restricted to a maximum of five minutes for the same reason. In 2003 London Heliport was acquired by Weston Homes. In 2012 it was bought by the Reuben Brothers, who also own Oxford Airport, for ¬£35 million. Edmiston announced in August 2019 that they would be taking over the title sponsorship of the heliport with a restyling of the interior & exterior areas as well as repainting the helicopter landing apron.

Accidents and incidents On 16 January 2013 a helicopter diverting to London Heliport in adverse weather collided with a construction crane and then crashed into the street, killing the pilot and one person on the ground. This was the first fatal helicopter crash anywhere near the heliport since records began in 1976. London Heliport has a fully licensed rescue and firefighting service who are on duty for all aircraft movements at the port as well as providing an emergency response to any helicopter incident within the London area. The Heliports Fire Service also conducts regular training alongside their colleagues in the London Fire Brigade and RNLI and offer training in helicopter emergencies to any emergency service.

The series is known for its fast-paced gameplay, 3D visual design running on the full resolution of the game's console, and its association with electronic dance music (mainly techno and trance) as well as its continuous collaboration with electronic artists (The Chemical Brothers, Leftfield, CoLD SToRAGE, Kraftwerk, Orbital, DJ Fresh, Noisia and others). The series is notable for its distinctive graphic design identity, provided by The Designers Republic for the first three games. The concept of Wipeout was first discussed during a pub conversation, when a Psygnosis staff member, Jim Bowers, envisioned an idea of creating a futuristic racing game which featured anti-gravity ships. Some elements of the game were inspired by Matrix Marauders, an Amiga game released by the Liverpudlian studio in 1990. A beta version of Wipeout appeared in the cult film Hackers, in which the game was being played by the protagonists in a nightclub. The game's appearance in the film led to Sony purchasing the studio in the following months after its release. The Wipeout franchise has been well received by critics, with Wipeout 2097 in particular being listed as among the PlayStation's best games. Wipeout 2048 was the last game to be developed by Studio Liverpool prior to their closure in August 2012. The series was later revived, with Wipeout Omega Collection released in 2017. Gameplay A screenshot from Wipeout HD. The series revolves around players piloting anti-gravity ships through futuristic race environments. The Wipeout games are a series of futuristic racers which involve players piloting anti-gravity ships through various forms of races. The series is known for its extreme speed, range of electronic dance music soundtracks, and consequential difficulty. Power-ups come in the form of offensive or defensive weaponry, ranging from machine guns, missiles, mines and rockets to energy shields, autopilots, and turbo boosts. These power-ups are usually collected by flying over coloured X-shaped pads on race tracks. Chevron-shaped speed pads also feature prominently on race tracks: once flown over, the player's ship receives a momentary boost. Every ship featured in a game is owned by a different racing team, although the number of teams and ships will vary throughout the games. Each ship has different characteristics: for example, ships will vary in handling, thrust, top speed, shield strength, and occasionally firepower. Every ship is equipped with a compulsory shield that absorbs damage sustained during a race; energy is lost whenever the player's ship collides or is hit by weapon fire. If damage is sustained after the shield's depletion, the ship in question will explode and the pilot is consequently eliminated from the race. The games' campaign modes usually consist of single races, time trials, and tournaments. * Standard single races involve the player competing against opponents to finish first and win a gold medal. As scoring is podium-based, silver and bronze medals are awarded for second and third place, respectively. * Tournaments typically contain four or eight single races each; points are scored based on position for each race, and the pilot who accumulates the most points wins. * Time trials and speed laps have the player obtaining the fastest time on a track in either a predetermined number of laps or an individual lap, respectively. * \\"Zone\\" mode has been featured in every game since Wipeout Fusion and revolves around survival as the player automatically accelerates to extreme speeds. The mode will only end upon the destruction of the player's ship. * \\"Eliminator\\" mode was introduced in Wipeout 3 and centres around pilots gaining points for damaging competitors and finishing laps. * \\"Combat\\" mode is a slight variation of Eliminator and appears only in Wipeout 2048. The difference between the two is that in Combat, energy is restored through item absorption as opposed to completing a lap. Games Wipeout Wipeout (stylised as wipEout\\") is a futuristic racing video game developed and published by Psygnosis. It is the first game in the series and was originally released for the PlayStation and PCs running MS-DOS in 1995, and for the Sega Saturn the following year. It was also a launch title for the PlayStation in Europe and North America. Set in the year 2052, players compete in the F3600 anti-gravity racing league, piloting one of a selection of craft in races on several different tracks around the world. Unique at the time for its futuristic setting, Wipeout featured music from well-known techno artists such as CoLD SToRAGE, Leftfield, The Chemical Brothers and Orbital. A prototype version of the game appeared in the teen cult film Hackers (1995), in which both protagonists were playing the game in a nightclub. A marketing campaign created and launched by Keith Hopwood and graphic design studio The Designers Republic included an infamous promotional poster featuring a bloodstained Radio 1 DJ Sara Cox, which was speculated by some of representing a drug overdose. Wipeout 2097 Wipeout 2097 (stylised wipE'out\\"2097; released as Wipeout XL in North America) is the second game of the franchise and is a direct sequel to the original game. It was first released worldwide in 1996 for the PlayStation, and for the Sega Saturn in the following year. Set in the year 2097, the game revolves around players racing in the F5000 anti-gravity racing league. The game was first unveiled to the public in the form of a pre-alpha demo at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May 1996. Music was mostly recorded from Psygnosis's in- house music team, CoLD SToRAGE, for versions released outside the PlayStation. Wipeout 64 Wipeout 64 is the third instalment of the series and is the only Wipeout title not to be released on a Sony console. It was released exclusively for the Nintendo 64 in November 1998 for North America, and later in 1999 for Europe. The game is set one year after the events of Wipeout 2097 and shares the same anti-gravity racing league. Wipeout 64 reuses most of the race tracks featured in the previous games, albeit with mirrored layouts and different locations. Wipeout 3 Wipeout 3 (stylised as wip3out in Europe and Japan) is the fourth title in the franchise and was first released in September 1999 for the PlayStation, where players race in the F7200 league. An enhanced edition entitled Wipeout 3 Special Edition was released exclusively in Europe on 14 July 2000; featuring minor changes to gameplay, such as different craft physics, auto-loading of saves and artificial intelligence bug fixes. As with the first two games, Psygnosis once again hired The Designers Republic to assist in development. The Sheffield-based company, known for its underground techno album covers, provided \\"visual candy\\" to Wipeout 3s graphics, designing the game's icons, billboards, and colour schemes. The game also featured music from Propellerheads, and with The Chemical Brothers and Orbital, returning from the first Wipeout. Psygnosis selected DJ Sasha to serve as the game's music director. Wipeout Fusion Wipeout Fusion (stylised as wipEout fusion) is the fifth instalment of the series and was first released on the PlayStation 2 in 2002. The game was the first to be developed by the newly renamed Sony Studio Liverpool. It is set in the year 2160 and revolves around players competing in the corrupt F9000 anti-gravity racing league. After the success of the previous games, the development team wanted to target Wipeout Fusion at an \\"older, savvier crowd\\" by making it stand out from the F-Zero series, which some critics had often compared it to. Wipeout Pure Wipeout Pure (stylised as wipE'out p·π≥re) is the sixth game in the series and was released simultaneously with the launch of the PlayStation Portable in 2005. The game takes place in the year 2197, exactly 100 years after Wipeout 2097, and centres around players competing in the FX300 anti-gravity racing league. Development of the game started in August 2003 and lasted until early 2005. Throughout production, the Liverpudlian studio created new user interfaces and other algorithms that helped speed up the development process in time for the PlayStation Portable's launch. The game was notable for showcasing the PlayStation Portable's graphical capabilities, and marked the first time a Wipeout game featured downloadable content‚Äîan aspect which had the potential to draw in more revenue for Studio Liverpool. Wipeout Pulse Wipeout Pulse (stylised as wipEout pulse) is the seventh instalment and was first released for the PlayStation Portable in 2007. A port for the PlayStation 2 was released exclusively in Europe in June 2009, featuring enhanced graphics and all of the game's downloadable content. The game takes place one year after the events of Wipeout Pure and has players compete in the FX400 anti-gravity racing league. Development of the game was centred around focusing on the feedback left by fans on the previous game, with many fans complaining of Wipeout Pures difficulty, thus prompting Studio Liverpool to improve on aspects where they had thought they failed. The game features sixteen licensed music tracks from techno artists, including Kraftwerk, DJ Fresh, and Skream. Wipeout HD Wipeout HD (stylised as WipEout HD) is the eighth title in the franchise and is the first to be released on the PS3 via PlayStation Network worldwide in 2008, although a retail version was later released exclusively in Europe the next year. A major expansion pack titled Wipeout HD Fury was released worldwide via the PlayStation Network worldwide in July 2009. This time, players compete in the FX350 anti-gravity racing league, set a year prior to the FX400 league, featuring a handful of race tracks from Wipeout Pure and Wipeout Pulse (although all content has been upgraded to render 1080p visuals in 60 frames per second). According to the game's director, the team made the decision to release the game as a PlayStation Store exclusive title before development in order to stress that downloadable content did not have to be focused on \\"small games\\". Wipeout HDs expansion pack, Fury, received controversy over its in- game advertising, with many players complaining of extended loading times, as well as consternation about advertising being retroactively added into a game that had already been paid for. The advertisements were removed soon after several complaints were made by players. The game was also chosen as a free PlayStation Store offering as part of Sony's \\"Welcome Back\\" program due to the 2011 PlayStation Network outage. Wipeout 2048 Wipeout 2048 is the ninth and final game in the series to be developed by Studio Liverpool prior to their closure in August 2012. The game was released as a launch title for the PlayStation Vita in early 2012 and centres around players competing in the Anti-Gravity Racing Championships. It is set in the year 2048 and acts as a prequel to the first Wipeout game, therefore including Street racing. Wipeout 2048 was developed alongside the PlayStation Vita console itself, and acted as a \\"testbed\\" for the device. When the staff of the Liverpudlian studio were given development kits for what was then dubbed a \\"Next Generation Portable\\", a group was set up within the team to brainstorm ideas. Among these included the proposal of a touchscreen device, which was not yet conceived by Sony at the time, and two analogue sticks‚Äîboth features eventually made it onto the console.  Wipeout Omega Collection  Wipeout Omega Collection (stylised as WipE'out OMEGA COLLECTION) is a remaster of the previous two titles in the Wipeout series: Wipeout HD (with its Wipeout HD Fury expansion) and Wipeout 2048. Wipeout HD itself contained content from Wipeout Pure and Wipeout Pulse. The game was developed by Clever Beans, EPOS Game Studios, and XDev. Wipeout Omega Collection was announced in December 2016 and released in June 2017. It was designed to be run at 1080p on the PlayStation 4 and 4K on the PlayStation 4 Pro, both at 60 frames per second. Development All games in the Wipeout franchise were developed by Sony Studio Liverpool. The conceptualisation of Wipeout revolved around Psygnosis designer Nick Burcombe's idea of creating a racing game using the same types of anti-gravity vehicles from his experience with Powerdrome, a title first released on the Atari ST in 1988. The game's futuristic vehicle designs were based on Matrix Marauders, a 1994 Amiga 3D grid-based strategy game whose concept was developed by fellow Psygnosis employee Jim Bowers. The name \\"Wipeout\\" was decided upon during a pub conversation, and was inspired by the instrumental song Wipe Out by The Surfaris. After the beta version of Wipeout appeared in the cult film Hackers, Sony expressed interest in Psygnosis on the basis of the \\"impressive work\\" they had produced with 3D graphics. In September 1995, Sony purchased the Liverpool-based company outright. Subsequent development of Wipeout 2097 spanned seven months, and a nightclub tour in conjunction with Red Bull was set up in order to help advertise the game. The game's art, in-game branding, and packaging were made by Sheffield-based The Designers Republic. For the development of Wipeout 3, Psygnosis once again hired The Designers Republic to assist in development. Lead artist Nicky Westcott wanted to make the game to look like a \\"believable future\\" in order to retain a believable sensibility. Wipeout 3 was also the first game to benefit from the PlayStation's analogue sticks, which were used to offer smoother control of the player's craft. Pre- production of Wipeout Pure began in August 2003 and full production commenced in October of that year. The team received development kits of the then- upcoming PlayStation Portable the following year, and was made aware that Wipeout Pure was going to be a launch title for that console. During development, Studio Liverpool created user interfaces and custom plugins for 3D computer graphics software entirely from scratch in order to help speed up the process. Wipeout HD was first announced during E3 2007, and was revealed to be a downloadable-only title. The game's director, Tony Buckley, said in a retrospective interview that the studio made the decision to release the game as a PlayStation Store exclusive title before development. There was a significant delay when reports emerged that the game's Zone Mode had failed epilepsy testing, and that it would have to be redesigned before it could be released. Wipeout 2048 was developed in parallel with the PlayStation Vita itself, and had acted as a \\"testbed\\" for the console. The development of the game influenced the design of the console itself; staff from the Liverpudlian studio were sent to brainstorm ideas to senior management at Sony. Among these ideas included the proposal of a touchscreen device‚Äîwhich was not yet conceived at the time‚Äîas well as the inclusion of two sticks. On 8 August 2012, Sony officially shut down Studio Liverpool as part of an effort to focus on alternative investment plans. At the time of their closure, the studio was working on a future Wipeout title for the PlayStation 4, which was reported to have been in development for 12 to 18 months. Reception The Wipeout series has been well received by critics. Its fast-paced gameplay, high-quality visuals, and prominent techno soundtracks have been cited as hallmarks of the series. Upon release, the first Wipeout game was widely praised for its electronica soundtrack, originality, and outstanding visuals; however, a critic at the time questioned its longevity and potential to hold a long lifespan in comparison to Super Mario Kart. In retrospect, Wipeout was described as being synonymous with Sony's debut gaming hardware and as an early showcase for 3D graphics in console gaming. The game also increased awareness of the underground techno community in England, as it was one of the first games to include licensed music. The second instalment of the series, Wipeout 2097, was released to critical acclaim. Reviewers unanimously commended its innovation, graphics, and unique blend of techno music. IGN ranked it as the 13th best PlayStation game of all time in 2002, and The Official PlayStation Magazine named it as the fifth best in 1997. In addition, Wipeout 2097 also ranks as the fourth best PlayStation game of all time at GameRankings. Wipeout 64 received generally positive reviews, with some critics asserting that it was a superior game to F-Zero X in regards to graphics, atmosphere, and track design, though others noted that it did not reach the standards of its predecessor, Wipeout 2097. The fourth instalment of the series, Wipeout 3, was positively received upon release; critics lauded the graphics, fast-paced gameplay, and music, although many reviews felt that the game's steep learning curve was a major fault. Wipeout Fusion was more negatively received by critics; the graphics received mixed responses, with one reviewer saying that it looked like an \\"early first generation PS2 game\\", despite another opining that the visuals had improved over all of its predecessors. At the time of Wipeout Fusions release in 2001, critics recognised the fact that techno music was an integral part of the series. Wipeout Pure and Wipeout Pulse both received very positive reviews upon release, with critics praising their visual effects, attention to detail, and track design. Wipeout HD, along with its Fury expansion pack, also received very positive reviews, with many critics agreeing that it offered the best visual representation of any Wipeout game due to it being upscaled in full 1080p and rendered in 60 frames per second. It was nominated for the \\"Outstanding Achievement in Sound Design\\" category in the 12th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards and was also nominated under the racing category for the 28th Golden Joystick Awards. The final instalment in the franchise to be developed by Studio Liverpool, Wipeout 2048, received generally positive reviews despite it being the lowest ranked game overall. Critics cohesively commended the graphics and visuals, and also regarded it as a showcase for the PlayStation Vita's power.

Origins  MOS Burger in Singapore The company name is styled in all caps: MOS Burger. However, originally the company was a spinoff of Atsushi Sakurada's previous company, Merchandising Organizing System. Later, the company began to use playful English phrases in point-of-purchase marketing materials to explain the name, including \\"MOSt delicious burger\\", before it finally settled on the backronym \\"Mountain, Ocean, Sun\\". Sakurada worked in Los Angeles at an investment company in the early 1960s, and during that time, he frequented the Los Angeles chili burger chain Original Tommy's. Wanting to strike out on his own after returning to Japan he decided to adapt the cook-to-order hamburger concept used by Original Tommy's. He also developed the MOS rice burger as an alternative to the hamburger. In April 2011, MOS Burger opened its first store at Sunnybank Plaza, in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. As of May 2016, the company has six stores in Australia.  Products   MOS Rice Burger  The MOS Rice Burger uses a bun made of rice mixed with barley and millet. Rice was first used as a bun in 1987, when the restaurant served the Tsukune Rice Burger, filled with ground chicken and daikon, and seasoned with soy sauce. The MOS Rice Burger has been imitated by the Taiwanese division of McDonald's,Taipei Times where the rice bun was pan-seared, but it remains a MOS-exclusive item in Japan and other markets.

Early life He was the second son of the botanist John Lindley, born at Acton Green, London. From his mother's side, he was descended from Sir Edward Coke. He was educated at University College School, and studied for a time at University College London. Legal career He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1850, and began practice in the Court of Chancery. In 1855 he published An Introduction to the Study of Jurisprudence, consisting of a translation of the general part of Thibaut's System des Pandekten Rechts, with copious notes. In 1860 he published in two volumes his Treatise on the Law of Partnership, including its Application to Joint Stock and other Companies, and in 1862 a supplement including the Companies Act 1862. This work has since been developed into two textbooks well known to lawyers as Lindley on Companies and Lindley on Partnership. Among his pupils were Francis William Maclean, later Chief Justice of Bengal, and Frederick Pollock. He took silk in February 1872. In 1874 he was elected a bencher of the Middle Temple, of which he was treasurer in 1894. Judicial career In 1875, he was appointed to be a Serjeant-at-law and a Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, the appointment of a chancery barrister to a common-law court being justified by the fusion of common law and equity then shortly to be brought about, in theory at all events, by the Judicature Acts. In 1875, he was knighted. In 1880 he became a justice of the Queen's Bench and in 1881 he was raised to be a Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal and was sworn of the Privy Council. In 1897, Lord Justice Lindley succeeded Lord Esher as Master of the Rolls, and in 1900 he was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary with a life peerage and the title of Baron Lindley, of East Carleton in the County of Norfolk. He resigned the judicial post in 1905. Prior to the 1875 reforms, the appointment of serjeants-at-law had already declined, but common law judges could only be appointed from amongst the serjeants-at-law, so it was customary for any appointee who was not yet a serjeant to be appointed a serjeant immediately prior to being appointed a judge. As the requirement for common law judges to be serjeants was abolished shortly after, Lord Lindley became the last serjeant-at-law appointed, and the last judge to wear the serjeant's coif, or rather the black patch representing it, on the judicial wig. Mount Lindley in Antarctica is named after him. Family He married Sarah Katharine, daughter of Edward John Teale of Leeds, on 5 Aug 1858. He died at home in East Carleton, near Norwich, in 1921. They had nine children, including diplomat Sir Francis Oswald Lindley and the army officer Major- General John Lindley. Coat of arms Writing Lord Lindley published two notable works, Lindley on Companies and Lindley on Partnership. The latter is still published today, as Lindley and Banks on Partnership, now in its 20th edition (2017).

The Ces√†ro sum is defined as the limit, as n tends to infinity, of the sequence of arithmetic means of the first n partial sums of the series. This special case of a matrix summability method is named for the Italian analyst Ernesto Ces√†ro (1859‚Äì1906). The term summation can be misleading, as some statements and proofs regarding Ces√†ro summation can be said to implicate the Eilenberg‚ÄìMazur swindle. For example, it is commonly applied to Grandi's series with the conclusion that the sum of that series is 1/2.  Definition  Let (a_n)_{n=1}^\\\\infty be a sequence, and let :s_k = a_1 + \\\\cdots + a_k= \\\\sum_{n=1}^k a_n be its th partial sum. The sequence is called Ces√†ro summable, with Ces√†ro sum , if, as tends to infinity, the arithmetic mean of its first n partial sums tends to : :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{k=1}^n s_k = A. The value of the resulting limit is called the Ces√†ro sum of the series \\\\textstyle\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n. If this series is convergent, then it is Ces√†ro summable and its Ces√†ro sum is the usual sum. Examples First example Let for . That is, (a_n)_{n=0}^\\\\infty is the sequence :(1, -1, 1, -1, \\\\ldots). Let denote the series :G = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_n = 1-1+1-1+1-\\\\cdots The series is known as Grandi's series. Let (s_k)_{k=0}^\\\\infty denote the sequence of partial sums of : :\\\\begin{align} s_k &= \\\\sum_{n=0}^k a_n \\\\\\\\\\\\ (s_k) &= (1, 0, 1, 0, \\\\ldots). \\\\end{align} This sequence of partial sums does not converge, so the series is divergent. However, Ces√†ro summable. Let (t_n)_{n=1}^\\\\infty be the sequence of arithmetic means of the first partial sums: :\\\\begin{align} t_n &= \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} s_k \\\\\\\\\\\\ (t_n) &= \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{1}, \\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\frac{2}{3}, \\\\frac{2}{4}, \\\\frac{3}{5}, \\\\frac{3}{6}, \\\\frac{4}{7}, \\\\frac{4}{8}, \\\\ldots\\\\right). \\\\end{align} Then :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} t_n = 1/2, and therefore, the Ces√†ro sum of the series is . Second example As another example, let for . That is, (a_n)_{n=1}^\\\\infty is the sequence :(1, 2, 3, 4, \\\\ldots). Let now denote the series :G = \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n = 1+2+3+4+\\\\cdots Then the sequence of partial sums (s_k)_{k=1}^\\\\infty is :(1, 3, 6, 10, \\\\ldots). Since the sequence of partial sums grows without bound, the series diverges to infinity. The sequence of means of partial sums of G is :\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{1}, \\\\frac{4}{2}, \\\\frac{10}{3}, \\\\frac{20}{4}, \\\\ldots\\\\right). This sequence diverges to infinity as well, so is Ces√†ro summable. In fact, for any sequence which diverges to (positive or negative) infinity, the Ces√†ro method also leads to a sequence that diverges likewise, and hence such a series is not Ces√†ro summable.  summation In 1890, Ernesto Ces√†ro stated a broader family of summation methods which have since been called for non-negative integers . The method is just ordinary summation, and is Ces√†ro summation as described above. The higher-order methods can be described as follows: given a series , define the quantities :\\\\begin{align} A_n^{-1}&=a_n \\\\\\\\\\\\ A_n^\\\\alpha&=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n A_k^{\\\\alpha-1} \\\\end{align} (where the upper indices do not denote exponents) and define to be for the series . Then the sum of is denoted by and has the value :(\\\\mathrm{C},\\\\alpha)\\\\text{-}\\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty a_j=\\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\frac{A_n^\\\\alpha}{E_n^\\\\alpha} if it exists . This description represents an -times iterated application of the initial summation method and can be restated as :(\\\\mathrm{C},\\\\alpha)\\\\text{-}\\\\sum_{j=0}^\\\\infty a_j = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to\\\\infty} \\\\sum_{j=0}^n \\\\frac{\\\\binom{n}{j}}{\\\\binom{n+\\\\alpha}{j}} a_j. Even more generally, for , let be implicitly given by the coefficients of the series :\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty A_n^\\\\alpha x^n=\\\\frac{\\\\displaystyle{\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty a_nx^n}}{(1-x)^{1+\\\\alpha}}, and as above. In particular, are the binomial coefficients of power . Then the sum of is defined as above. If has a sum, then it also has a sum for every , and the sums agree; furthermore we have if (see little- notation).  Ces√†ro summability of an integral  Let . The integral \\\\textstyle\\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(x)\\\\,dx is summable if :\\\\lim_{\\\\lambda\\\\to\\\\infty}\\\\int_0^\\\\lambda\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{x}{\\\\lambda}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha f(x)\\\\, dx exists and is finite . The value of this limit, should it exist, is the sum of the integral. Analogously to the case of the sum of a series, if , the result is convergence of the improper integral. In the case , convergence is equivalent to the existence of the limit :\\\\lim_{\\\\lambda\\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}\\\\int_0^\\\\lambda \\\\int_0^x f(y)\\\\, dy\\\\,dx which is the limit of means of the partial integrals. As is the case with series, if an integral is summable for some value of , then it is also summable for all , and the value of the resulting limit is the same.

The site covers a total area of . Phase 1 of the building was opened during the weekend of the 26‚Äì28 November 2004 and phase 2 opened on 22 January 2009 with an inaugural concert. The centre has hosted performances of opera, ballet, contemporary dance, theatre comedy, and musicals. The Wales Millennium Centre comprises one large theatre and two smaller halls with shops, bars and restaurants. It houses the national orchestra and opera, dance, theatre and literature companies, a total of eight arts organisations in residence. The main theatre, the Donald Gordon Theatre, has 1,897 seats, the BBC Hoddinott Hall 350 and the Weston Studio Theatre 250. In 2001 Lord Rowe-Beddoe was appointed chairman of Wales Millennium Centre, a company limited by guarantee. Board members include Sir Michael Checkland.  Background   The failed Cardiff Bay Opera House project Site of the proposed Cardiff Bay Opera House and later Wales Millennium Centre in the open space in the middle of the image The Wales Millennium Centre replaced an earlier project for the site, the Cardiff Bay Opera House, a plan supported by the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation to construct a permanent home for the Welsh National Opera. The project failed to win financial support from the Millennium Commission, the body which distributed funds from the UK National Lottery. An international design competition attracted 268 international applicants, and was won by Iraq-born architect Zaha Hadid. Her avant-garde design was so radical that she and a selection of other applicants were asked to submit revised designs for a second round of competition‚Äîwhich she again won with \\"a sleek and dazzling complex of sharp lines and surfaces that she compared to an 'inverted necklace'\\". In December 1995, the Millennium Commission decided against lottery-money funding for the project. It was suggested that the bid failed because of \\"the unpopular Conservative government's fear of controversy,\\" favouring the funding of projects perceived as more populist, such as the Millennium Stadium.Review by Raymund Ryan of at Metropolis in Review, April 1988  Origins of Wales Millennium Centre  After the Cardiff Bay Opera House project was rejected, a new project was conceived that included more than opera and was felt to be a better reflection of Welsh culture. The change of name symbolised this, but the project still had to overcome many hurdles. Funding from the Welsh Assembly and Millennium Commission took years to obtain. Cardiff Council had to buy the land after the previous owners, Grosvenor Waterside (Associated British Ports property division) threatened to build a retail centre there due to the delays. Further boosts were given by large donations from South African businessman Donald Gordon and a loan from the international bank, HSBC. The GB¬£20 million donation from Donald Gordon was split evenly between the Royal Opera House and Wales Millennium Centre and was spread over five years. This is believed to be the largest single private donation ever made to the arts in the UK.  Phase 1 ‚Äì Donald Gordon Theatre and Weston Studio Theatre  In addition to the two main theatres of the Donald Gordon Theatre and Weston Studio Theatre, the phase 1 of the Wales Millennium Centre also has six function rooms: the Victor Salvi Room, the David Morgan Room, the Sony Room, the Seligman Room, the Japan Room, and the Lloyds Enterprise Suite. The Urdd Gobaith Cymru has a hostel with accommodations for 153 people overnight in en-suite bedrooms, called the Urdd City Sleepover. It also has performance and teaching space in the Urdd Hall/Theatre, with 153 retractable seats. The Blue Room The building also includes rehearsal rooms, orchestral facilities for the Welsh National Opera, dance studios for Diversions, called The Dance House, and the Blue Room, with seating for up to 100. The Glanfa Stage The foyer has three bars; the Penderyn Awen Foyer Bar on level 2, the Horizons Foyer Bar on level 4, and the Stones Foyer Bar on level 5. ffresh restaurant is also situated in the foyer, along with Crema, which is a coffee shop, Hufen, which is an Ice cream parlour and One, which is a wine bar. Free performances also take place during the day in the foyer on the Glanfa Stage.  Design and construction  During construction of phase 1 The WMC was designed by Jonathan Adams, of local practice Percy Thomas Architects (taken over by Capita Group in 2004Gates, C. PFI fells Welsh giant Building Design, Issue 1630, 18 June 2004, p.1), with Arup Acoustics providing the acoustic design and Arup as building engineer. His first concept drawings were made in early 1998, by 1999 his design was starting to look more like the building it is today. Construction began on 25 February 2002, the main contractor being Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd and Kelsey Roofing Industries Ltd being the roofing contractor. Carr and Angier were the theatre consultants. Other contractors included Stent (foundations), Swansea Institute of Higher Education, now part of University of Wales Trinity Saint David (glass), GH James Cyf (stonemasonry), Rimex (stainless steel), Alfred McAlpine (slate), Coed Cymru (wood), Ann Catrin Evans (door furniture), Amber Hiscott (etchings on glass walls). The architect's concept of the building was a building that expressed \\"Welshness\\" and was instantly recognisable. The building was designed to reflect the many different parts of Wales with local Welsh materials that dominate its history: slate, metal, wood and glass. All the materials used come from Wales; the WMC was built from 1,350 tonnes of Welsh slate, 300,000 concrete blocks, and a million metres of electric cable. Slate Slate: Multi-coloured layers of slate The exterior of the building is clad in multi-coloured slate collected from Welsh slate quarries. Narrow windows are built into the layers of slate to give the impression of rock; strata they depict the different stone layers in sea cliffs. The purple slate came from the Penrhyn Quarry, the blue from Cwt y Bugail Quarry, the green from the Nantlle Valley, the grey from Llechwedd quarry, and the black from the Corris Quarry. > I always loved going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there > looked like a building anyway. A building capable of withstanding the > roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they > look. I wondered if it would be possible to make a building which had the > same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that I needed a lot of > stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it > takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the > historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that > no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two > hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was > thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind... > ‚Äîarchitect Jonathan Adams Metal The WMC's main feature, the bronze coloured dome which covers the Donald Gordon Theatre, is clad in steel that was treated with copper oxide. It was designed to withstand the weather conditions on the Cardiff Bay waterfront and will look increasingly better with age. The architect, Jonathan Adams, decided not to use copper and aluminium as they would both change colour with age and weather conditions. > We all know that steel making has been important to south Wales, just as > slate making has changed the landscape of the north. We have to use a > special type of steel that won't go rusty near to the salt-laden, maritime > air of Cardiff Bay. This stainless steel will be made near to Pontypool. For > the Wales Millennium Centre I thought it was important that the materials > should have a \\"natural\\" texture, and that they should be instantly > recognisable to anyone seeing them, even from a distance. For this reason I > felt it was important that the steel of the shell should have the rough > grain and the riveted pattern that we think of as more typical of old > industrial structures, such as those that used to be commonplace around the > landscape of the industrial south. ‚Äîarchitect Jonathan Adams Wood Wood: Used on the balconies in the foyer Both inside and outside the building, including the main Donald Gordon Theatre, the balconies and the rear of the building, is dominated by bands of hardwood lining the walls. > Like the exterior of the building, the principal internal spaces are > designed to make the best use of natural materials in their natural state. > The structure and detail of the concourse galleries echo the form of the > exterior, with the curving strata formed in native hardwoods. Oak, ash, > beech, sycamore, alder, birch, chestnut and cherry woods from renewable > sources in mid-Wales will be used together in proportions that reflect their > relative availability from the forest. The design of the concourse galleries > is intended to evoke the image of the edge of the forest, partly as a > counterpoint to the coastal nature of the exterior, and partly because the > edge of the forest in folklore and mythology represents a line between the > real world and the magical world, a line which resembles the front edge of > the theatre stage. The form of trees is created by the interweaving > curvature of the gallery edges, and by the random positioning of the > supporting columns. ‚Äîarchitect Jonathan Adams Glass Glass: Bands of glass from the inside Glass was used to incorporate into the bands of slate. The glass is thick and was cut and installed by the Architectural Glass Department at Swansea Institute of Higher Education. Glass is not used in the contemporary British architectural style of the glass curtain. Jonathan Adams said, \\"The glass veins in the external walls of the Wales Millennium Centre make use of conventional glass in a unique way: the sheets of glass are stacked together and fused in a kiln to form solid blocks.\\" Calligraphy Calligraphy: Wales Millennium Centre illuminated at night Inscribed on the front of the dome, above the main entrance, are two poetic lines, written by Welsh poet Gwyneth Lewis in the Welsh and English languages. The lettering is formed by windows in the upstairs bar areas and is internally illuminated at night. > The idea of this monumental inscription comes from Roman classical > architecture. The Romans brought Christianity to these islands, along with > the custom of engraving stone. The form of the Celtic cross embodies the > cross-fertilisation of indigenous and Roman cultures, from which the Welsh > nation first emerged. The monumental inscription is a familiar feature of > Roman architecture. The inscription over the entrance of the Wales > Millennium Centre is a revival of this classical tradition, and also a > recognition of the formative influence of Roman culture upon our nation. > We're lucky to have two languages; one that we share with half the world and > one which belongs just to us. Words in songs, stories and poems have helped > to make Wales the proud country that it is. ‚Äîarchitect Jonathan Adams Gwyneth Lewis said of the inscription: > I wanted the words to reflect the architecture of the building. Its copper > dome reminded me of the furnaces from Wales's industrial heritage and also > Ceridwen's cauldron, from which the early poet Taliesin received his > inspiration ('awen'). Awen suggests both poetic inspiration and the general > creative vision by which people and societies form their aspirations. [...] > It was important to me that the English words on the building should not > simply be a translation of the Welsh, that they should have their own > message. The strata of the slate frontage of the Wales Millennium Centre > reminded me of the horizons just beyond Penarth Head. The sea has, > traditionally, been for Cardiff the means by which the Welsh export their > best to the world and the route by which the world comes to Cardiff. The > stones inside the theatre literally sing with opera, musicals and orchestral > music, and I wanted to convey the sense of an international space created by > the art of music. ‚ÄîGwyneth Lewis \\"In These Stones Horizons Sing\\" is also an orchestral work, which was composed by Karl Jenkins, and commissioned by the Wales Millennium Centre for the opening of the Wales Milliennium Centre.  Opening weekend ceremony  The building was officially opened on the weekend of the 26, 27 and 28 November 2004. The ceremony was organised by Bryn Terfel, the creative director of the whole opening weekend. Day 1 ‚Äì 26 November 2004 Plaque to commemorate the opening of the Wales Millennium Centre The day started with a speech from Lord Rowe-Beddoe, chairman of Wales Millennium Centre, who declared to the crowd that the proceedings were under way. This was followed by a speech from Rhodri Morgan, the First Minister, who stressed that the new arts centre belonged to the whole nation, that it was for all of the people of Wales and not just for the elite. The building was opened by Janet Thickpenny, a young mother from Barry, who was chosen because her 40th birthday coincided with that of the opening day. A human chain delivered the symbolic key, designed and cast by Ann Catrin Evans, to Janet with a fanfare from the National Youth Brass Band of Wales to a Karl Jenkins specially commissioned work In These Stones Horizons Sing and the Wales Millennium Centre was open. The evening celebrations began with Cymru for the World, which celebrated the achievements of five leading Welsh artists; Gwyneth Jones, Shirley Bassey, Si√¢n Phillips, Alun Hoddinott and Richard Burton, represented by his daughter Kate Burton. This included tributes from Robert Hardy, Jonathan Pryce, Derek Jacobi, Nana Mouskouri, Catrin Finch, Ruth Madoc and Ian McKellen. The concert was directed by Ken Caswell and conducted by David Charles Abell. Bryn Terfel started off with a short speech and introduced the Wales Millennium Centre singers and dancers, who in hard hats and donkey jackets sang and danced the story of the construction of the building. They were later joined by all 322 participants in a chorus, including Gwyn Hughes Jones, Bryn Terfel and Dennis O'Neill sang a duet from Pearl Fishers. Diversions performed a new ballet based on one of Alun Hoddinott's works. The Welsh National Opera performed the final scene of Beethoven's Fidelio in their new home. The evening ranged across all musical types from popular to classical. Day 2 ‚Äì 27 November 2004 The second day was an open door for the public to explore the building with a continuous stream of people filling through the building from early morning until the fireworks display out in the Roald Dahl Plass. Day 3 ‚Äì 28 November 2004 The final day of the opening weekend began with the arrival of Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, and the Prince of Wales who met First Minister Rhodri Morgan and Lord Rowe-Beddoe, and marked the event by unveiling a plaque. A key was presented to Queen Elizabeth II by Richard Burton's granddaughter, Charlotte Frances Ritchie. Philip Madoc, Si√¢n Phillips, Gaby Roslin, Michael Ball, Charlotte Church, Catrin Finch and Only Men Aloud! were among the artists that entertained the audience during the first act. The second act was opened by the Welsh National Opera and later the Kirov Ballet and Cirque √âloize entertained the audience. Bryn Terfel ended the celebrations.  Phase 2 (C Bay) ‚Äì BBC Hoddinott Hall  BBC Hoddinott Hall Phase 2 of the Wales Millennium Centre is home to the BBC National Orchestra of Wales (BBC NOW) and the BBC National Chorus of Wales. BBC NOW moved from Studio 1 at Broadcasting House in Llandaff, which the orchestra had outgrown since the late 1960s. Phase 2 opened on 22 January 2009 with an inaugural concert performed by the BBC NOW and conducted by Thierry Fischer. Phase 2 includes the 350 seater BBC Hoddinott Hall (), also known simply as Hoddinott Hall, which is named after the late Welsh classical composer Alun Hoddinott CBE (11 August 1929 ‚Äì 12 March 2008), and the Grace Williams Studio, which is named after another Welsh composer, Grace Williams (19 February 1906 ‚Äì 10 February 1977), and is used as a centre for education and outreach work. Phase 2 also has space for practice rooms, a music library, backstage facilities, it also provides a four-storey office space for Wales Millennium Centre and the Arts Council of Wales. Design and construction The original plans for the WMC were that it would have a concert hall, however the final design of phase 1 did not include one. Space had been left, though, for a concert hall to be built in the future when phase 1 of the WMC was opened in 2004, and construction on phase 2 was then due to begin early in 2005. However, construction of phase 2 did not actually begin until April 2007. Phase 2 was designed to fit into the WMC's curved slate frontage, with an upper part constructed from timber. The entrance to the BBC Hoddinott Hall from within the Wales Millennium Centre Phase 2 of the WMC was designed by the then newly qualified Tim Green and Keith Vince of Capita Architecture, formerly called Capita Percy Thomas and now part of Capita Symonds, with Arup Acoustics again providing the acoustic design. The main contractor was again Sir Robert McAlpine Ltd, with MJN Colston Ltd responsible for the design and installation of all the mechanical, electrical and public health services in the building. Other subcontractors on the project included URS Corporation, Davis Langdon and Hulley & Kirkwood. Tim Green said of the building that the exterior of the building was designed to be in keeping with the existing Wales Millennium Centre, while the interior had a theme all its own. \\"The concept behind the design of the interior of Hoddinott Hall was that of a traditional Welsh chapel.\\" \\"The timber treatment at low level is very reminiscent of Victorian chapels and the masonry above. The stonework you would normally get in a stone chapel has been replaced by concrete.\\" During the design and construction period, the project name for phase 2 was C Bay. Construction of phase 2 began in April 2007, and ended when the keys to the building were handed over at an official ceremony in September 2008, and the beginning of the fitting out of the BBC Hoddinott Hall by BBC Wales. Opening Festival To commemorate the opening of the BBC Hoddinott Hall an inaugural concert took place on 22 January 2009. It was part of the Opening Festival which took place between 22 January and 1 February 2009. The concert was performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and was conducted by Thierry Fischer. The concert included the world premiere of St Vitus in the Kettle by Simon Holt, the orchestra's composer in association, who took over from Michael Berkeley. The BBC Hoddinott Hall was officially opened by the Prince of Wales on 31 January 2009, where he unveiled a plaque.  Resident organisations  The rear of the building with offices of the National Dance Company Wales, Urdd and Literature Wales (left) and Arts Council of Wales (right)) The Wales Millennium Centre is home to nine arts organisations: * Literature Wales ‚Äì The Welsh National Literature Promotion Agency and Society For Writers * National Dance Company Wales ‚Äì previously known as Diversions ‚Äì the Dance Company of Wales * Hijinx Theatre ‚Äì a theatre company that promotes community work, aiming to bring together people of all ages * Touch Trust ‚Äì providing educational touch and movement therapies to people with profound disabilities and autism * T≈∑ Cerdd ‚Äì music information centre for amateur and professional musicians, including the Welsh Music Information Centre, Welsh Amateur Music Federation, National Youth Arts Wales and Cyfansoddwyr Cymru (Composers of Wales) * Urdd Gobaith Cymru (The Welsh League of Youth) ‚Äì the Welsh language youth movement * Welsh National Opera ‚Äì an international touring opera company * BBC National Orchestra of Wales ‚Äì The only professional national symphony orchestra for Wales * Arts Council of Wales ‚Äì The body responsible for funding and developing the arts in Wales  Corporate financing and rebranding  The total cost of phase 1 of the project was ¬£106.2 million. The National Lottery Millennium Fund provided ¬£31.7 million, a further ¬£37 million came from The National Assembly for Wales and ¬£10.4 million was donated by the Arts Council of Wales. In addition a private investor, South African businessman Donald Gordon donated ¬£20 million to be shared equally between the Royal Opera House and the Wales Millennium Centre. WMC also received a ¬£13.5 million loan from HSBC. The remaining funds for the project came from a major sponsorship deal with the Principality Building Society. The Weston Studio is named after the Garfield Weston Foundation which funds the Glanfa Stage, and is located on Level 1 of the building. The organisation has many corporations and public bodies who provide sponsorship to WMC. The National Assembly for Wales announced on 6 November 2007 that it was to pay off the outstanding loan of ¬£13.5 million from HSBC and also increase the annual funding. From April 2008, the National Assembly for Wales have given a grant to the Wales Millennium Centre with ¬£3.5 million per annum for 3 years. This would only repay the capital debt and not any ongoing operating loss as the organisation remains profitable. The money used to pay the debt came from unallocated funds from the Assembly's previous budget and it was said by the Minister for Heritage, Rhodri Glyn Thomas, that the new money allocation would not come at the expense of other art projects from other parts of Wales. The cost of phase 2 of the project was approximately ¬£18 million, however the BBC does not own the building, they have leased it for 25 years from the Lime Property Fund, which is a subsidiary of Aviva Investors. The building was built by Concert Bay Ltd, which is a subsidiary of Sir Robert McAlpine Enterprises Ltd who co-funded the scheme along with Lime Property Fund. In November 2006, Wales Millennium Centre announced that they would begin a two phase rebranding project. The project was won by a local Cardiff company, Sweet. The first phase of the project involved a new corporate logo, the second phase included the complete redesign of other marketing tools, such as brochures and advertisements.  In popular culture  Doctor Who and Torchwood WMC has made numerous appearances in film and television including Doctor Who, whose modern era is produced locally by BBC Wales. It has appeared seven times to date: as itself from outside in the episode \\"Boom Town\\", its marquee momentarily at the end of the episode \\"Bad Wolf\\", its lobby as a hospital lobby in the far future in the episode \\"New Earth\\", and again in \\"The Girl Who Waited\\",. It also appeared briefly in the episodes \\"Utopia\\" and \\"The Stolen Earth\\", and also in the final episode of series 3, \\"Last of the Time Lords\\". The spin-off series Torchwood, has its headquarters, known as \\"The Hub\\", set underneath the Water Tower, Roald Dahl Plass, with the Wales Millennium Centre's frontage featuring heavily through the show. Jones Jones Jones On 3 November 2006, a record breaking attempt to gather the most people with the same surname, Jones, took place at WMC under the show banner Jones Jones Jones, filmed for television by S4C. The record was broken with 1,224 Joneses filling the Donald Gordon Theatre. The previous record was set in Sweden in 2004 when 583 people gathered who had the same surname of Norberg. Gavin & Stacey Episode 1 of the second series of BBC TV show Gavin & Stacey was filmed in the Wales Millennium Centre. The centre was supposed to be an airport.

The gameplay involves building an empire. Emphasis is placed upon economic and technological development, as well as a range of non-military routes to supremacy. The earliest 4X games borrowed ideas from board games and 1970s text-based computer games. The first 4X computer games were turn-based, but real-time 4X games are not uncommon. Many 4X computer games were published in the mid-1990s, but were later outsold by other types of strategy games. Sid Meier's Civilization is an important example from this formative era, and popularized the level of detail that later became a staple of the genre. In the new millennium, several 4X releases have become critically and commercially successful. In the board (and card) game domain, 4X is less of a distinct genre, in part because of the practical constraints of components and playing time. The Civilization board game that gave rise to Sid Meier's Civilization computer game, for instance, has no exploration and no extermination. Unless extermination is targeted at non- player entities, it tends to be either nearly impossible (because of play balance mechanisms, since player elimination is usually considered an undesirable feature) or certainly unachievable (because victory conditions are triggered before extermination can be completed) in board games. Definition 4X computer games such as Master of Orion II let empires explore the map, expanding by founding new colonies and exploiting their resources. The game can be won either by becoming an elected leader of the galaxy or by exterminating all opponents. The term \\"4X\\" originates from a 1993 preview of Master of Orion in Computer Gaming World by game writer Alan Emrich where he rated the game \\"XXXX\\" as a pun on the XXX rating for pornography. The four Xs were an abbreviation for \\"EXplore, EXpand, EXploit and EXterminate\\". Since then, others have adopted the term to describe games of similar scope and design. By February 1994 another author in the magazine said that Command Adventures: Starship \\"only pays lip service to the four X's\\", and other game commentators adopted the \\"4X\\" label to describe a game genre with specific gameplay conventions: * Explore means players send scouts across a map to reveal surrounding territories. * Expand means players claim new territory by creating new settlements, or sometimes by extending the influence of existing settlements. * Exploit means players gather and use resources in areas they control, and improve the efficiency of that usage. * Exterminate means attacking and eliminating rival players. Since in some games all territory is eventually claimed, eliminating a rival's presence may be the only way to achieve further expansion. These four elements of gameplay have been described as the four phases of a 4X computer game session. These phases often overlap with each other and vary in length depending on the game design. For example, the Space Empires series and Galactic Civilizations II: Dark Avatar have a long expansion phase, because players must make large investments in research to explore and expand into every area. Modern definition In modern-day usage, 4X games are different from other strategy games such as Command & Conquer by their greater complexity and scale, and their complex use of diplomacy. Reviewers have also said that 4X games feature a range of diplomatic options, and that they are well known for their large detailed empires and complex gameplay. In particular, 4X games offer detailed control over an empire's economy, while other computer strategy games simplify this in favor of combat-focused gameplay. Game design 4X computer and board games are a subgenre of strategy-based games, and include both turn-based and real- time strategy titles. The gameplay involves building an empire, which takes place in a setting such as Earth, a fantasy world, or in space. Each player takes control of a different civilization or race with unique characteristics and strengths. Most 4X games represent these racial differences with a collection of economic and military bonuses. Research and technology 4X games typically feature a technology tree, which represents a series of advancements that players can unlock to gain new units, buildings, and other capabilities. Technology trees in 4X games are typically larger than in other strategy games, featuring a larger selection of choices. Empires must generate research resources and invest them in new technology. In 4X games, the main prerequisite for researching an advanced technology is knowledge of earlier technology. This is in contrast to non-4X real-time strategy games, where technological progress is achieved by building structures that grant access to more advanced structures and units. Research is important in 4X games because technological progress is an engine for conquest. Battles are often won by superior military technology or greater numbers, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. In contrast, military upgrades in non-4X games are sometimes small enough that technologically basic units remain important throughout the game. Combat Combat is an important part of 4X gameplay, because 4X games allow a player to win by exterminating all rival players, or by conquering a threshold amount of the game's universe. Some 4X games, such as Galactic Civilizations, resolve battles automatically, whenever two units from warring sides meet. This is in contrast to other 4X games, such as Master of Orion, that allow players to manage battles on a tactical battle screen. Even in 4X games with more detailed control over battles, victory is usually determined by superior numbers and technology, with battle tactics playing a smaller part. 4X games differ from other combat-focused strategy games by putting more emphasis on research and economics. Researching new technology will grant access to new combat units. Some 4X games even allow players to research different unit components. This is more typical of space 4X games, where players may assemble a ship from a variety of engines, shields, and weaponry. Peaceful competition 4X games allow rival players to engage in diplomacy. While some strategy games may offer shared victory and team play, diplomatic relations tend to be restricted to a binary choice between an ally or enemy. 4X games often allow more complex diplomatic relations between competitors who are not on the same team. Aside from making allies and enemies, players are also able to trade resources and information with rivals. In addition to victory through conquest, 4X games often offer peaceful victory conditions or goals that involve no extermination of rival players (although war may still be a necessary by-product of reaching said goal). For example, a 4X game may offer victory to a player who achieves a certain score or the highest score after a certain number of turns. Many 4X games award victory to the first player to master an advanced technology, accumulate a large amount of culture, or complete an awe-inspiring achievement. Several 4X games award \\"diplomatic victory\\" to anyone who can win an election decided by their rival players, or maintain peace for a specified number of turns. Galactic Civilizations has a diplomatic victory which involves having alliances with at least four factions, with no factions outside of one's alliance; there are two ways to accomplish this: ally with all factions, or ally with at least the minimum number of factions and destroy the rest. Complexity 4X games are known for their complex gameplay and strategic depth. Gameplay usually takes priority over elaborate graphics. Whereas other strategy games focus on combat, 4X games also offer more detailed control over diplomacy, economics, and research; creating opportunities for diverse strategies. This also challenges the player to manage several strategies simultaneously, and plan for long-term objectives. To experience a detailed model of a large empire, 4X games are designed with a complex set of game rules. For example, the player's productivity may be limited by pollution. Players may need to balance a budget, such as managing debt, or paying down maintenance costs. 4X games often model political challenges such as civil disorder, or a senate that can oust the player's political party or force them to make peace. FreeCol is typical of 4X games where there is a separate interface for managing each settlement. Such complexity requires players to manage a larger amount of information than other strategy games. Game designers often organize empire management into different interface screens and modes, such as a separate screen for diplomacy, managing individual settlements, and managing battle tactics. Sometimes systems are intricate enough to resemble a minigame. This is in contrast to most real-time strategy games. Dune II, which arguably established the conventions for the real-time strategy genre, was fundamentally designed to be a \\"flat interface\\", with no additional screens. Gameplay Since 4X games involve managing a large, detailed empire, game sessions usually last longer than other strategy games. Game sessions may require several hours of play-time, which can be particularly problematic for multiplayer matches. For example, a small-scale game in Sins of a Solar Empire can last longer than twelve hours. However, fans of the genre often expect and embrace these long game sessions; Emrich wrote that \\"when the various parts are properly designed, other X's seem to follow. Words like EXcite, EXperiment and EXcuses (to one's significant others)\\". Turn-based 4X games typically divide these sessions into hundreds of turns of gameplay. Because of repetitive actions and long-playing times, 4X games have been criticized for excessive micromanagement. In early stages of a game this is usually not a problem, but later in a game directing an empire's numerous settlements can demand several minutes to play a single turn. This increases playing-times, which are a particular burden in multiplayer games. 4X games began to offer AI governors that automate the micromanagement of a colony's build orders, but players criticized these governors for making poor decisions. In response, developers have tried other approaches to reduce micromanagement, and some approaches have been more well received than others. Commentators generally agree that Galactic Civilizations succeeds, which GamingNexus.com attributes to the game's use of programmable governors. Sins of a Solar Empire was designed to reduce the incentives for micromanagement, and reviewers found that the game's interface made empire management more elegant. On the other hand, Master of Orion III reduced micromanagement by limiting complete player control over their empire. History Origin Sid Meier, the creator of the Civilization series of 4X games Early 4X games were influenced by board games and text-based computer games from the 1970s. Cosmic Balance II, Andromeda Conquest and Reach for the Stars were published in 1983, and are now seen retrospectively as 4X games. Although Andromeda Conquest was only a simple game of empire expansion, Reach for the Stars introduced the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and conquest. In 1991, Sid Meier released Civilization and popularized the level of detail that has become common in the genre. Sid Meier's Civilization was influenced by board games such as Risk and the Avalon Hill board game also called Civilization. A notable similarity between the Civilization computer game and board game is the importance of diplomacy and technological advancement. Sid Meier's Civilization was also influenced by personal computer games such as the city management game SimCity and the wargame Empire. Civilization became widely successful and influenced many 4X games to come; Computer Gaming World compared its importance to computer gaming to that of the wheel. Armada 2525 was also released in 1991 and was cited by the Chicago Tribune as the best space game of the year. A sequel, Armada 2526 was released in 2009. In 1991, two highly influential space games were released. VGA Planets was released for the PC, while Spaceward Ho! was released on the Macintosh. Although 4X space games were ultimately more influenced by the complexity of VGA Planets, Spaceward Ho! earned praise for its relatively simple yet challenging game design. Spaceward Ho! is notable for its similarity to the 1993 game Master of Orion, with its simple yet deep gameplay. Master of Orion also drew upon earlier 4X games such as Reach for the Stars, and is considered a classic game that sets a new standard for the genre. In a preview of Master of Orion, Emrich coined the term \\"XXXX\\" to describe the emerging genre. Eventually, the \\"4X\\" label was adopted by the game industry, and is now applied to several earlier game releases. Peak Following the success of Civilization and Master of Orion, other developers began releasing their own 4X games. In 1994, Stardock launched its first version of the Galactic Civilizations series for OS/2, and the long-standing Space Empires series began as shareware. Ascendancy and Stars! were released in 1995, and both continued the genre's emphasis on strategic depth and empire management. Meanwhile, the Civilization and Master of Orion franchises expanded their market with versions for the Macintosh. Sid Meier's team also produced Colonization in 1994 and Civilization II in 1996, while Simtex released Master of Orion in 1993, Master of Magic in 1994 and Master of Orion II in 1996. By the late 1990s, real-time strategy games began outselling turn-based games. As they surged in popularity, major 4X developers fell into difficulties. Sid Meier's Firaxis Games released Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri in 1999 to critical acclaim, but the game fell short of commercial expectations. Civilization III encountered development problems followed by a rushed release in 2001. Despite the excitement over Master of Orion III, its release in 2003 was met with criticism for its lack of player control, poor interface, and weak AI. Game publishers eventually became risk-averse to financing the development of 4X games. Real-time hybrid 4X Eventually real-time 4X games were released, such as Imperium Galactica in 1997, Starships Unlimited in 2001, and Sword of the Stars in 2006, featuring a combination of turn-based strategy and real- time tactical combat. The blend of 4X and real-time strategy gameplay led Ironclad Games to market their 2008 release Sins of a Solar Empire as a \\"RT4X\\" game. This combination of features earned the game a mention as one of the top games from 2008, including GameSpot's award for best strategy game, and IGN's award for best PC game. Cross-fertilization between board games and video games continued. For example, some aspects of Master of Orion III were drawn from the first edition of the board game Twilight Imperium. Even Sins of a Solar Empire was inspired by the idea of adapting the board game Buck Rogers Battle for the 25th Century into a real-time video game. Going in the opposite direction, Eagle Games made a board game adaptation of Sid Meier's Civilization in 2002, completely different from the board game that had inspired the computer game in the first place. Recent history In 2003, Stardock released a remake of Galactic Civilizations, which was praised by reviewers who saw the game as a replacement for the Master of Orion series. In 2004 the Creative Assembly released the critically acclaimed Rome: Total War, which has spawned many sequels. Civilization IV was released at the end of 2005 and was considered the PC game of the year according to several reviewers, including GameSpot and GameSpy. It is now considered one of the greatest computer games in history, having been ranked the second-best PC game of all time by IGN. By 2008, the Civilization series had sold over eight million copies, followed the release of Civilization Revolution for game consoles soon after, Civilization V in 2010 and Civilization VI in 2016. Meanwhile, Stardock released Galactic Civilizations II, which was considered the sixth-best PC game of 2006 by GameSpy. Additionally, French developer Amplitude Studios released both Endless Space and Endless Legend. These successes have led Stardock's Brad Wardell to assert that 4X games have excellent growth potential, particularly among less hardcore players. This is in addition to the loyal base of 4X gamers who have supported free software releases such as Freeciv, FreeCol, Freeorion, Golden Age of Civilizations, and C-evo.

It lies 150 meters below the ruins of the third-largest castle in the Czech Republic, Hukvaldy Castle, and is the birthplace of the composer Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek. The castle has been rebuilt at least five times over the last 700 years, evolving from a small early gothic castle to a baroque fortress. It was first built between 1260 and 1270 by Mr. Frank from P≈ô√≠bor. He was the son of the colonizer Arnold from the Huckeswagen family. When it functioned as a defensive structure, the castle was never taken; which is likely because of its location and its massive fortress. The oldest part is an oval with many walls and a tall slim tower in the front. Above the ditch and entrance to the castle there is a dwelling building on the other side of the structure. After 1469, the castle was completely rebuilt by Bishop Tas of Boskovice. In 1762, there was a fire in the castle and it was completely destroyed. In the 20th century, the castle was abandoned and it fell into ruins. Several repairs have been done, but the castle is still undergoing restoration. The best-preserved structure is St. Andrew's chapel; where many concerts take place due to its excellent acoustics. Weddings also take place in the chapel.

Primus played an important role in the presentation of African dance to American audiences. Early in her career she saw the need to promote African dance as an art form worthy of study and performance. Primus' work was a reaction to myths of savagery and the lack of knowledge about African people. It was an effort to guide the Western world to view African dance as an important and dignified statement about another way of life. Background Born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, Pearl Primus was two years old when she moved with her parents, Edward Primus and Emily Jackson, to New York City in 1921.Gloria Grant Roberson, \\"Primus, Pearl Eileen\\", The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives. Encyclopedia.com.\\"Pearl Primus\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. In 1940, Primus received her bachelor's degree from Hunter College in biology and pre-medical science. As a graduate student in biology, she realized her dreams of becoming a medical researcher would be unfulfilled, due to racial discrimination at the time that imposed limitations on jobs in the science field for people of color. Because of society's limitations, Primus was unable to find a job as a laboratory technician and she could not fund herself through medical school, so she picked up odd jobs. Eventually Primus sought help from the National Youth Administration and they gave her a job working backstage in the wardrobe department for America Dances. Once a spot became available for a dancer, Primus was hired as an understudy, thus beginning her first theatrical experience. Pearl discovered her innate gift for movement, and she was quickly recognized for her abilities. Within a year, Primus auditioned and won a scholarship for the New Dance Group, a left-wing school and performance company located on the Lower East Side of New York City. Career Primus began her formal study of dance with the New Dance Group in 1941, she was the group's first black student. She trained under the group's founders, Jane Dudley, Sophie Maslow, and William Bates. Through this organization, Primus not only gained a foundation for her contemporary technique, but she learned about artistic activism. The New Dance Group's motto was ‚Äúdance is a weapon of the class struggle‚Äù, they instilled the belief that dance is a conscious art and those who view it should be impacted. The organization trained dancers like Primus to be aware of the political and social climate of their time. Primus‚Äô exposure to this newfound form of activism encouraged the themes of social protest found in her works. Primus continued to develop her modern dance foundation with several pioneers such Martha Graham, Charles Weidman, Ismay Andrews, and Asadata Dafora. Amongst these influencers, Dafora's influence on Primus has been largely ignored by historians and unmentioned by Primus. However, Marcia Ethel Heard notes that he instilled a sense of African pride in his students and asserts that he taught Primus about African dance and culture. Dafora began a movement of African cultural pride which provided Primus with collaborators and piqued public interest in her work. Primus explored African culture and dance by consulting family, books, articles, pictures, and museums. After six months of thorough research, she completed her first major composition entitled African Ceremonial. This piece served as an introduction to her swelling interest in Black heritage. She based the dance on a legend from the Belgian Congo, about a priest who performed a fertility ritual until he collapsed and vanished. This thoroughly researched composition was presented along with Strange Fruit, Rock Daniel, and Hard Time Blues, at her debut performance on February 14, 1943, at the 92nd Street YMHA. Her performance was so outstanding that John Martin, a major dance critic from the New York Times stated that \\"she was entitled to a company of her own.\\" John Martin admired her stage presence, energy, and technique. He described her as a remarkable and distinguished artist.Primus choreographed \\"The Negro Speaks of Rivers\\" by Langston Hughes (here, photographed by Carl Van Vechten in 1936) After gaining much praise, Primus‚Äô next performances began in April 1943, as an entertainer at the famous racially integrated night club, Cafe Society Downtown. For 10 months her energy and emotion commanded the stage, along with her stunning five-foot-high jumps. She continued to amaze audiences when she performed at the Negro Freedom Rally, in June 1943, at Madison Square Garden before an audience of 20,000 people. Primus studied under Martha Graham (here, photographed by Yousuf Karsh in 1948) In December 1943, Primus appeared as in Dafora's African Dance Festival at Carnegie Hall before Eleanor Roosevelt and Mary McLeod Bethune. Within the same month, Primus, who was primarily a solo artist, recruited other dances and formed the Primus Company. The company performed in concerts at the Roxy Theatre. African Ceremonial was re-envisioned for the group's performance. At that time, Primus' African choreography could be termed interpretive, based on the research she conducted and her perception of her findings. Primus would choreograph based on imagining the movement of something she observed, such as an African sculpture. Over time Primus developed an interest in the way dance represented the lives of people in a culture. Primus was also intrigued by the relationship between the African- slave diaspora and different types of cultural dances. With an enlarged range of interest, Primus began to conduct some field studies. In the summer of 1944, Primus visited the Deep South to research the culture and dances of Southern blacks. She posed as a migrant worker with the aim ‚Äúto know [her] own people where they are suffering the most. She observed and participated in the daily lives of black impoverished sharecroppers. Primus fully engulfed herself in the experience by attending over seventy churches and picking cotton with the sharecroppers. After her field research, Primus was able to establish new choreography while continuously developing some of her former innovative works. Primus made her Broadway debut on October 4, 1944, at the Bealson Theatre. Here she performed a work that was choreographed to Langston Hughes‚Äô poem ‚ÄúNegro Speaks of Rivers‚Äù. The poem addressed the inequalities and injustices imposed on the black community, while introducing comparisons between the ancestry of Black people to the four main rivers in the Middle East. Primus‚Äô dance to this poem boldly acknowledged the strength and wisdom of African Americans through periods of freedom and enslavement. In 1945 she continued to develop Strange Fruit (1945) one of the pieces she debuted in 1943. This dance was based on the poem by Lewis Allan about a lynching. When analyzing the dance, one can see that the performer is portraying a female character's reaction after witnessing a lynching. Many viewers wondered about the race of the anguished woman, but Primus declared that the woman was a member of the lynch mob. ‚ÄúThe dance begins as the last person begins to leave the lynching ground and the horror of what she has seen grips her, and she has to do a smooth, fast roll away from that burning flesh.‚Äù Primus depicts the aftermath of the lynching through the remorse of the woman, after she realized the horrible nature of the act. The intention of this piece introduces the idea that even a lynch mob can show penitence. Primus‚Äô work continued to push boundaries as she re-developed another one of her debut pieces, Hard Time Blues (1945). She choreographed this dance to a song by folk singer Josh White. The choreography for this piece, which was made in protest of sharecropping, truly represented Primus‚Äô movement style. This piece was embellished with athletic jumps that defied gravity and amazed audiences. But Primus explained that jumping does not always symbolize joy. In this case, her powerful jumping symbolized the defiance, desperation, and anger of the sharecroppers which she experienced first-hand during her field studies. Primus believed that when observing the jumps in the choreography, it was important to pay attention to ‚Äúthe shape the body takes in the air‚Äù. For Hard Time Blues, the shape of the body was a predictor of the emotional state of the poor sharecroppers. In 1946, Primus continued her journey on Broadway was invited to appear in the revival of the Broadway production Showboat, choreographed by Helen Tamiris. Then, she was asked to choreograph a Broadway production called Calypso whose title became Caribbean Carnival. She also appeared at the Chicago Theatre in the 1947 revival of the Emperor Jones in the \\"Witch Doctor\\" role that Hemsley Winfield made famous. Charles S. Johnson funded research into dance in Africa by Primus In 1947 Primus joined Jacob's Pillow and began her own program in which she reprised some of her works such as Hard Time Blues. In her program she also presented Three Spirituals entitled ‚ÄúMotherless Child‚Äù, ‚ÄúGoin‚Äô to tell God all my Trouble‚Äù, and ‚ÄúIn the Great Gettin‚Äô-up Mornin‚Äô.‚Äù These pieces were rooted in Primus‚Äô experience with black southern culture. This cannon of Negro spirituals, also referred to as ‚Äúsorrow songs‚Äù branched from slave culture, which at the time was a prominent source of inspiration for many contemporary dance artists. Following this show and many subsequent recitals, Primus toured the nation with The Primus Company. While on the university and college circuit, Primus performed at Fisk University in 1948, where Dr. Charles S. Johnson, a member of Rosenwald Foundation board, was president. He was so impressed with the power of her interpretive African dances that he asked her when she had last visited Africa. She replied that she had never done so. She then became the last recipient of the major Rosenwald fellowships and received the most amount of money ($4000) ever given. After receiving this funding, Primus originally proposed to develop a dance project based on James Weldon Johnsons work \\"God's Trombones. But instead she decided to conduct an 18-month research and study tour of the Gold Coast, Angola, Cameroons, Liberia, Senegal and the Belgian Congo. On December 5, 1948, dancer Pearl Primus closed a successful return engagement at the Caf√© Society nightclub in New York City before heading off to Africa. Primus was so well accepted in the communities in her study tour that she was told that the ancestral spirit of an African dancer had manifested in her. The Oni and people of Ife, Nigeria, felt that she was so much a part of their community that they initiated her into their commonwealth and affectionately conferred on her the title \\"Omowale\\" ‚Äî the child who has returned home.During her travels in the villages of Africa, Primus was declared a man so that she could learn the dances only assigned to males. She mastered dances like Bushasche a war dance and Fanga which were common to African cultural life. When Primus returned to America, she took the knowledge she gained in Africa and staged pieces for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre. In 1974, Primus staged Fanga created in 1949 which was a Liberian dance of welcome that quickly made its way into Primus's iconic repertoire. She also staged The Wedding created in 1961. These pieces were based on the African rituals Primus experienced during her travels. Primus took these traditionally long rituals, dramatized them, made them shorter, and preserved the foundation of the movement . Primus learned a plethora in Africa, but she was still eager to further her academic knowledge, Primus received her PhD in anthropology from NYU in 1978. In 1979, she and her husband Percival Borde, who she met during her research in Trinidad, founded the Pearl Primus \\"Dance Language Institute\\" in New Rochelle, New York, where they offered classes that blended African-American, Caribbean, and African dance forms with modern dance and ballet techniques. They also established a performance group was called \\"Earth Theatre\\". As an artist/ educator, Primus taught at a number of universities during her career including NYU, Hunter College, the State University of New York at Purchase, the College of New Rochelle, Iona College, the State University of New York at Buffalo, Howard University, the Five Colleges consortium in Massachusetts. She also taught at New Rochelle High School, assisting with cultural presentations.\\"Dance As A Language\\", Dance: A Tribute to Pearl E. Primus. As an anthropologist, she conducted cultural projects in Europe, Africa and America for such organizations as the Ford Foundation, US Office of Education, New York University, Universalist Unitarian Service Committee, Julius Rosenwald Foundation, New York State Office of Education, and the Council for the Arts in Westchester. Legacy Pioneer of African dance in the United States Primus' sojourn to West Africa has proven invaluable to students of African dance. She learned more about African dance, its function and meaning than had any other American before her. Primus was known as a griot, the voice of cultures in which dance is embedded. She was able to codify the technical details of many of the African dances through the notation system she evolved and was also able to view and to salvage some \\"still existent gems of dances before they faded into general decadence.\\"Primus, from the Schomburg Library: Primus File, 1949 She has been unselfish in sharing the knowledge she has gained with others. The significance of Primus' African research and choreography lies in her presentation of a dance history which embraces ethnic unity, the establishment of an articulate foundation for influencing future practitioners of African dance, the presentation of African dance forms into a disciplined expression, and the enrichment of American theater through the performance of African dance. Additionally, Primus and the late Percival Borde, her husband and partner, conducted research with the Liberian Konama Kende Performing Arts Center to establish a performing arts center, and with a Rebekah Harkness Foundation grant to organize and direct dance performances in several counties during the period of 1959 to 1962. Primus and Borde taught African dance artists how to make their indigenous dances theatrically entertaining and acceptable to the western world, and also arranged projects between African countries such as Senegal, Gambia, Guinea and the United States Government to bring touring companies to this country. Choreography approach and style Primus' approach to developing a movement language and to creating dance works parallels that of Graham, Holm, Weidman, Agnes de Mille and others who are considered to be pioneers of American modern dance. These artists searched literature, used music of contemporary composers, glorified regional idiosyncrasies and looked to varied ethnic groups for potential sources of creative material. Primus, however, found her creative impetus in the cultural heritage of the African American. She gained a lot of information from her family who enlightened her about their West Indian roots and African lineage. The stories and memories told to young Pearl, established a cultural and historical heritage for her and laid the foundation for her creative works. Primus‚Äô extensive field studies in the South and in Africa was also a key resource for her. She made sure to preserve the traditional forms of expression that she observed. In this way she differed from other dance groups who altered the African dances that they incorporated into their movements. Her view of ‚Äúdance as a form of life‚Äù supported her decision to keep her choreography real and authentic. Pearl fused spirituals, jazz and blues and then coupling these music forms with the literacy works of black writers, Primus' choreographic voice ‚Äî though strong ‚Äî resonated primarily for and to the black community. Her many works ‚ÄòStrange Fruit‚Äô, ‚ÄòNegro Speaks of Rivers‚Äô, ‚ÄòHard Time Blues‚Äô, and more spoke on very socially important topics. Her creative endeavors in political and social change makes Primus arguably one of the most political choreographers of her time because of her awareness of the issues of African Americans, particularly during the period between World War I and II. Primus was a powerhouse dancer, whose emotions, exuberance, and five-foot-high athletic jumps wowed every audience she performed for. Margret Lloyd describes Pearls movement in her performance of Hard Time Blues, ‚ÄúPearl takes a running jump, lands in an upper corner and sits there, unconcernedly paddling the air with her legs. She does it repeatedly, from one side of the stage, then the other, apparently unaware of the involuntary gasps from the audience‚Ä¶‚Äù. Primus‚Äô athleticism made her choreography awe-striking. She preserved traditional movements but added her own style which includes modified pelvic rotations and rhythmic variations. As she moved Primus carried intensity and displayed passion while simultaneously bringing awareness to social issues. Primus' strong belief that rich choreographic material lay in abundance in the root experiences of a people has been picked up and echoed in the rhythm and themes of Alvin Ailey, Donald McKayle, Talley Beatty, Dianne McIntyre, Elo Pomare and others. Her work has also been reimagined and recycled into different versions by contemporary artists. Many choreographers, such as Jawolle Willa Jo Zollar, created projects inspired by Primus‚Äô work. Primus choreography which included bent knees, the isolation and articulation of body parts, and rhythmically percussive movement, can be observed in the movement of Zollar and many others. These similarities show that Primus‚Äô style, themes, and body type promoted the display of Black culture within the dance community. Personal life and death Primus married the dancer, drummer, and choreographer Percival Borde in 1954, and began a collaboration that ended only with his death in 1979. In 1959, the year Primus received an M.A. in education from New York University, she traveled to Liberia, where she worked with the National Dance Company there to create Fanga, an interpretation of a traditional Liberian invocation to the earth and sky. Primus believed in sound research. Her meticulous search of libraries and museums and her use of living source materials established her as a dance scholar. Pearl Primus focused on matters such as oppression, racial prejudice, and violence. Her efforts were also subsidized by the United States government who encouraged African-American artistic endeavors. Primus died from diabetes at her home in New Rochelle, New York on October 29, 1994. Recognition In 1991, President George H. W. Bush honored Primus with the National Medal of Arts. She was the recipient of numerous other honors including: The cherished Liberian Government Decoration, \\"Star of Africa\\"; The Scroll of Honor from the National Council of Negro Women; The Pioneer of Dance Award from the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre; Membership in Phi Beta Kappa; an honorary doctorate from Spelman College; the first Balasaraswati/ Joy Ann Dewey Beinecke Chair for Distinguished Teaching at the American Dance Festival; The National Culture Award from the New York State Federation of Foreign Language Teachers; Commendation from the White House Conference on Children and Youth.

The series was written by Jim Starlin, and drawn by Ron Lim. The storyline is a continuation of events involving resurrected Starlin-character Thanos,Silver Surfer vol. 3, #34 (Feb. 1990) featured in the title Silver Surfer.Silver Surfer vol. 3, #34 - 43 (Feb. - Nov. 1990) The storyline leads directly into three consecutive limited series, The Infinity Gauntlet, The Infinity War, and Infinity Crusade. Plot summary Recently resurrected by Death in order to wipe out half of the population of the universe, the Titan Thanos discovers the true nature of the six Infinity Gems after gazing into Death's Infinity Well. Convincing Death that possession of the gems will aid him tremendously in his quest, he gains her permission to seek them out from the cosmic entities that currently possess them. In Part One of the Thanos Quest, Thanos first travels to the Nexus of Reality where the \\"concept being\\" known as the In-Betweener is being imprisoned by Lord Chaos and Master Order; after freeing him from the sphere in which he is being incarcerated, Thanos forcibly takes the Soul Gem from the In-Betweener, whose powers are useless at the heart of the realm of Chaos and Order. Thanos next seeks out the Champion of the Universe on a planet called Tamarata, where he has been testing his combat prowess against the planet's numerous armies. Challenging him to single combat, Thanos tricks the Champion into destroying the planet and stranding himself in space. He then offers the Champion transportation to the nearest planet in exchange for the Champion's Power Gem, to which the Champion agrees, believing that the gem has never functioned, but not realizing that he has tapped into its power reserves subconsciously. Thanos upholds his part of the bargain, but jettisons the Champion into the unnamed planet's atmosphere, leaving him to plummet to the planet's surface. His reasoning is that he had never promised the Champion a \\"soft landing.\\" Thanos's next target is the Gardener, who has been in possession of the Time Gem and has used its powers to create a garden of unparalleled beauty. After a short and seemingly peaceful discussion, the Gardener attempts to use the power of his gem to strangle Thanos in various items of vegetation; using the Power Gem, Thanos breaks free and turns the Gardener's creations against him before taking the gem. In Part Two, Thanos contacts the Collector, with whom he has apparently had an amicable past and who has been monitoring his activities since Thanos's encounter with the Champion. Thanos informs the Collector that he will soon be coming into possession of a treasure so rare that the Collector will gladly part with his gem in trade for it. Thanos then seeks out the Runner, who has been using the Space Gem in order to make himself the fastest being in existence. After the Runner destroys Thanos's craft, Thanos reveals to him that he has discovered the true nature of the Infinity Gems; that they are, in fact, the physical remnants of a godlike being that existed before the creation of our universe, and who committed a form of cosmic suicide out of loneliness. He then uses the Time gem taken from the Gardener to turn the Runner first into an extremely old and decrepit man, and then into an infant. With the infant Runner in hand, he teleports back to the Collector's ship and proceeds to trade the Runner for the Collector's gem, which Thanos demonstrates to the astonished Collector has the ability to control reality. The Collector begs Thanos to leave, which he does... but only after allowing the Runner to revert to his normal age and form to take out his anger on the Collector. Thanos's final target is the Grandmaster, a consummate games-man. With the final gem, the Mind Gem, imprisoned in a random teleportation device that will only deactivate with his death, he informs Thanos that he cannot have the gem until he bests him in a game of his choosing. The two then compete in a virtual reality combat game, which Thanos seems to win until it is shown that the Grandmaster had sabotaged Thanos's weaponry. However, Thanos then reveals that the body with which the Grandmaster had been competing was merely a robotic clone of Thanos; its destruction being inconsequential, the real Thanos proceeds to destroy the gaming equipment, killing the Grandmaster and freeing the Mind Gem. Thanos returns to Death's sanctum with the six Infinity Gems in his possession, boasting of his achievement and his new-found status as Death's equal. Death congratulates his accomplishment, though still speaks to him through her various minions. When Thanos demands that Death address him personally as her mate, she points out to him, again through her minions, with his newly achieved status of omnipotence, Thanos is not her equal, but her superior, and that it would therefore not be fitting for her to address him directly. Thanos destroys the minion in a fit of anger and stalks from Death's throne room, trying to comprehend his miscalculation, and finally wondering, while shedding a tear, how becoming a god could prove such a hollow victory.The Thanos Quest #1 - 2 (Sep. - Oct. 1990) Collected editions The series has been reprinted a number of times, first in a 2000 one-shot and then as part of the Rebirth of Thanos trade paperback which brought together all the pre-Infinity Gauntlet issues dealing with Thanos's return: *Silver Surfer: Rebirth Of Thanos (collects Silver Surfer #34-38, The Thanos Quest mini-series, and \\"The Final Flower!\\" from Logan's Run #6, 224 pages, April 2006, ) In other media Some elements of the comic were later loosely adapted in Avengers: Infinity War.

It is formulated as the integral of air density along the light ray. As it penetrates the atmosphere, light is attenuated by scattering and absorption; the thicker atmosphere through which it passes, the greater the attenuation. Consequently, celestial bodies when nearer the horizon appear less bright than when nearer the zenith. This attenuation, known as atmospheric extinction, is described quantitatively by the Beer‚ÄìLambert law. \\"Air mass\\" normally indicates relative air mass, the ratio of absolute air masses (as defined above) at oblique incidence relative to that at zenith. So, by definition, the relative air mass at the zenith is 1. Air mass increases as the angle between the source and the zenith increases, reaching a value of approximately 38 at the horizon. Air mass can be less than one at an elevation greater than sea level; however, most closed-form expressions for air mass do not include the effects of the observer's elevation, so adjustment must usually be accomplished by other means. Tables of air mass have been published by numerous authors, including Bemporad (1904), Allen (1976), Allen‚Äôs air mass table was an abbreviated compilation of values from earlier sources, primarily Bemporad (1904). and Kasten and Young (1989).  Definition  The absolute air mass is defined as: :\\\\sigma = \\\\int \\\\rho \\\\, \\\\mathrm d s \\\\,. where \\\\rho is volumetric density of air. Thus \\\\sigma is a type of oblique column density. In the vertical direction, the absolute air mass at zenith is: :\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{zen} = \\\\int \\\\rho \\\\, \\\\mathrm d z So \\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{zen} is a type of vertical column density. Finally, the relative air mass is: :X = \\\\frac \\\\sigma {\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{zen}} Assuming air density is uniform allows removing it out of the integrals. The absolute air mass then simplifies to a product: :\\\\sigma = \\\\bar\\\\rho s where \\\\bar\\\\rho=\\\\mathrm{const.} is the average density and the arc length s of the oblique and zenith light paths are: :s = \\\\int \\\\, \\\\mathrm d s :s_\\\\mathrm{zen} = \\\\int \\\\, \\\\mathrm d z In the corresponding simplified relative air mass, the average density cancels out in the fraction, leading to the ratio of path lengths: :X = \\\\frac s {s_\\\\mathrm{zen}} \\\\,. Further simplifications are often made, assuming straight-line propagation (neglecting ray bending), as discussed below. Calculation Plots of air mass using various formulas. Background The angle of a celestial body with the zenith is the zenith angle (in astronomy, commonly referred to as the zenith distance). A body‚Äôs angular position can also be given in terms of altitude, the angle above the geometric horizon; the altitude h and the zenith angle z are thus related by :h = 90^\\\\circ - z \\\\,. Atmospheric refraction causes light entering the atmosphere to follow an approximately circular path that is slightly longer than the geometric path. Air mass must take into account the longer path (Young 1994). Additionally, refraction causes a celestial body to appear higher above the horizon than it actually is; at the horizon, the difference between the true zenith angle and the apparent zenith angle is approximately 34 minutes of arc. Most air mass formulas are based on the apparent zenith angle, but some are based on the true zenith angle, so it is important to ensure that the correct value is used, especially near the horizon. At very high zenith angles, air mass is strongly dependent on local atmospheric conditions, including temperature, pressure, and especially the temperature gradient near the ground. In addition low-altitude extinction is strongly affected by the aerosol concentration and its vertical distribution. Many authors have cautioned that accurate calculation of air mass near the horizon is all but impossible. Plane-parallel atmosphere When the zenith angle is small to moderate, a good approximation is given by assuming a homogeneous plane-parallel atmosphere (i.e., one in which density is constant and Earth‚Äôs curvature is ignored). The air mass X then is simply the secant of the zenith angle z: :X = \\\\sec\\\\, z \\\\,. At a zenith angle of 60¬∞, the air mass is approximately 2. However, because the Earth is not flat, this formula is only usable for zenith angles up to about 60¬∞ to 75¬∞, depending on accuracy requirements. At greater zenith angles, the accuracy degrades rapidly, with X = \\\\sec\\\\, z becoming infinite at the horizon; the horizon air mass in the more- realistic spherical atmosphere is usually less than 40. Interpolative formulas Many formulas have been developed to fit tabular values of air mass; one by Young and Irvine (1967) included a simple corrective term: :X = \\\\sec\\\\,z_\\\\mathrm t \\\\, \\\\left [ 1 - 0.0012 \\\\,(\\\\sec^2 z_\\\\mathrm t - 1) \\\\right ] \\\\,, where z_\\\\mathrm t is the true zenith angle. This gives usable results up to approximately 80¬∞, but the accuracy degrades rapidly at greater zenith angles. The calculated air mass reaches a maximum of 11.13 at 86.6¬∞, becomes zero at 88¬∞, and approaches negative infinity at the horizon. The plot of this formula on the accompanying graph includes a correction for atmospheric refraction so that the calculated air mass is for apparent rather than true zenith angle. Hardie (1962) introduced a polynomial in \\\\sec\\\\,z - 1: :X = \\\\sec\\\\,z \\\\,-\\\\, 0.0018167 \\\\,(\\\\sec\\\\,z \\\\,-\\\\, 1) \\\\,-\\\\, 0.002875 \\\\,(\\\\sec\\\\,z \\\\,-\\\\, 1)^2 \\\\,-\\\\, 0.0008083 \\\\,(\\\\sec\\\\,z \\\\,-\\\\, 1)^3 \\\\, which gives usable results for zenith angles of up to perhaps 85¬∞. As with the previous formula, the calculated air mass reaches a maximum, and then approaches negative infinity at the horizon. Rozenberg (1966) suggested :X = \\\\left (\\\\cos\\\\,z + 0.025 e^{-11 \\\\cos\\\\, z} \\\\right )^{-1} \\\\,, which gives reasonable results for high zenith angles, with a horizon air mass of 40. Kasten and Young (1989) developed The Kasten and Young formula was originally given in terms of altitude \\\\gamma as :X = \\\\frac{1} { \\\\sin\\\\, \\\\gamma + 0.50572 \\\\,(\\\\gamma + 6.07995^\\\\circ )^{-1.6364}}\\\\;; in this article, it is given in terms of zenith angle for consistency with the other formulas. :X = \\\\frac{1} { \\\\cos\\\\, z + 0.50572 \\\\,(6.07995^\\\\circ + 90^\\\\circ - z)^{-1.6364}} \\\\,, which gives reasonable results for zenith angles of up to 90¬∞, with an air mass of approximately 38 at the horizon. Here the second z term is in degrees. Young (1994) developed :X = \\\\frac { 1.002432\\\\, \\\\cos^2 z_\\\\mathrm t + 0.148386 \\\\, \\\\cos\\\\, z_\\\\mathrm t + 0.0096467 } { \\\\cos^3 z_\\\\mathrm t + 0.149864\\\\, \\\\cos^2 z_\\\\mathrm t + 0.0102963 \\\\, \\\\cos\\\\, z_\\\\mathrm t + 0.000303978 } \\\\, in terms of the true zenith angle z_\\\\mathrm t, for which he claimed a maximum error (at the horizon) of 0.0037 air mass. Pickering (2002) developed :X = \\\\frac{1} { \\\\sin (h + {244}/(165+47 h^{1.1}) ) } \\\\,, where h is apparent altitude (90^\\\\circ - z) in degrees. Pickering claimed his equation to have a tenth the error of Schaefer (1998) near the horizon. Pickering (2002) uses Garfinkel (1967) as the reference for accuracy. Atmospheric models Interpolative formulas attempt to provide a good fit to tabular values of air mass using minimal computational overhead. The tabular values, however, must be determined from measurements or atmospheric models that derive from geometrical and physical considerations of Earth and its atmosphere. =Nonrefracting spherical atmosphere= Atmospheric effects on optical transmission can be modelled as if the atmosphere is concentrated in approximately the lower 9 km. If atmospheric refraction is ignored, it can be shown from simple geometrical considerations (Schoenberg 1929, 173) that the path s of a light ray at zenith angle z through a radially symmetrical atmosphere of height y_{\\\\mathrm {atm}} above the Earth is given by : s = \\\\sqrt {R_\\\\mathrm {E}^2 \\\\cos^2 z + 2 R_\\\\mathrm {E} y_\\\\mathrm{atm} \\\\+ y_\\\\mathrm{atm}^2}  R_\\\\mathrm {E} \\\\cos\\\\, z \\\\, or alternatively, : s = \\\\sqrt {\\\\left ( R_\\\\mathrm {E} + y_\\\\mathrm{atm} \\\\right )^2  R_\\\\mathrm {E}^2 \\\\sin^2 z}  R_\\\\mathrm {E} \\\\cos\\\\, z \\\\, where R_\\\\mathrm E is the radius of the Earth. The relative air mass is then: : X = \\\\frac s {y_\\\\mathrm{atm}} = \\\\frac {R_\\\\mathrm {E}} {y_\\\\mathrm{atm}} \\\\sqrt {\\\\cos^2 z \\\\+ 2 \\\\frac {y_\\\\mathrm{atm}} {R_\\\\mathrm {E}} \\\\+ \\\\left ( \\\\frac {y_\\\\mathrm{atm}} {R_\\\\mathrm {E}} \\\\right )^2 }  \\\\frac {R_\\\\mathrm {E}} {y_\\\\mathrm{atm}} \\\\cos\\\\, z \\\\,. =Homogeneous atmosphere= If the atmosphere is homogeneous (i.e., density is constant), the atmospheric height y_{\\\\mathrm {atm}} follows from hydrostatic considerations as: :y_\\\\mathrm{atm} = \\\\frac {kT_0} {mg} \\\\,, where k is Boltzmann‚Äôs constant, T_0 is the sea-level temperature, m is the molecular mass of air, and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Although this is the same as the pressure scale height of an isothermal atmosphere, the implication is slightly different. In an isothermal atmosphere, 37% of the atmosphere is above the pressure scale height; in a homogeneous atmosphere, there is no atmosphere above the atmospheric height. Taking T_0 = 288.15 K, m = 28.9644√ó1.6605√ó10‚àí27 kg, and g = 9.80665 m/s2 gives y_\\\\mathrm{atm} ‚âà 8435 m. Using Earth‚Äôs mean radius of 6371 km, the sea-level air mass at the horizon is : X_\\\\mathrm{horiz} = \\\\sqrt {1 + 2 \\\\frac {R_\\\\mathrm {E}} {y_\\\\mathrm{atm}}} \\\\approx 38.87 \\\\,. The homogeneous spherical model slightly underestimates the rate of increase in air mass near the horizon; a reasonable overall fit to values determined from more rigorous models can be had by setting the air mass to match a value at a zenith angle less than 90¬∞. The air mass equation can be rearranged to give :\\\\frac {R_\\\\mathrm{E}} {y_\\\\mathrm{atm}} = \\\\frac {X^2 - 1} {2 \\\\left ( 1 - X \\\\cos z \\\\right )} \\\\,; matching Bemporad‚Äôs value of 19.787 at z = 88¬∞ gives R_\\\\mathrm{E} / y_\\\\mathrm{atm} ‚âà 631.01 and X_\\\\mathrm{horiz} ‚âà 35.54. With the same value for R_\\\\mathrm{E} as above, y_\\\\mathrm{atm} ‚âà 10,096 m. While a homogeneous atmosphere isn‚Äôt a physically realistic model, the approximation is reasonable as long as the scale height of the atmosphere is small compared to the radius of the planet. The model is usable (i.e., it does not diverge or go to zero) at all zenith angles, including those greater than 90¬∞ (see Homogeneous spherical atmosphere with elevated observer below). The model requires comparatively little computational overhead, and if high accuracy is not required, it gives reasonable results. Although acknowledging that an isothermal or polytropic atmosphere would have been more realistic, Janiczek and DeYoung (1987) used the homogeneous spherical model in calculating illumination from the Sun and Moon, with the implication that the slightly reduced accuracy was more than offset by the considerable reduction in computational overhead. However, for zenith angles less than 90¬∞, a better fit to accepted values of air mass can be had with several of the interpolative formulas. =Variable-density atmosphere= In a real atmosphere, density is not constant (it decreases with elevation above mean sea level. The absolute air mass for the geometrical light path discussed above, becomes, for a sea-level observer, : \\\\sigma = \\\\int_0^{y_\\\\mathrm{atm}} \\\\frac {\\\\rho \\\\, \\\\left ( R_\\\\mathrm {E} + y \\\\right ) \\\\mathrm d y} {\\\\sqrt {R_\\\\mathrm {E}^2 \\\\cos^2 z + 2 R_\\\\mathrm {E} y + y^2}} \\\\,. =Isothermal atmosphere= Several basic models for density variation with elevation are commonly used. The simplest, an isothermal atmosphere, gives :\\\\rho = \\\\rho_0 e^{-y / H} \\\\,, where \\\\rho_0 is the sea-level density and H is the pressure scale height. When the limits of integration are zero and infinity, and some high-order terms are dropped, this model yields (Young 1974, 147), : X \\\\approx \\\\sqrt { \\\\frac {\\\\pi R} {2 H}} \\\\exp {\\\\left ( \\\\frac {R \\\\cos^2 z} {2 H} \\\\right )} \\\\, \\\\mathrm {erfc} \\\\left ( \\\\sqrt {\\\\frac {R \\\\cos^2 z} {2 H}} \\\\right ) \\\\,. An approximate correction for refraction can be made by taking (Young 1974, 147) :R = 7/6 \\\\, R_\\\\mathrm E \\\\,, where R_\\\\mathrm E is the physical radius of the Earth. At the horizon, the approximate equation becomes :X_\\\\mathrm{horiz} \\\\approx \\\\sqrt { \\\\frac {\\\\pi R} {2 H}} \\\\,. Using a scale height of 8435 m, Earth‚Äôs mean radius of 6371 km, and including the correction for refraction, :X_\\\\mathrm{horiz} \\\\approx 37.20 \\\\,. =Polytropic atmosphere= The assumption of constant temperature is simplistic; a more realistic model is the polytropic atmosphere, for which :T = T_0 - \\\\alpha y \\\\,, where T_0 is the sea-level temperature and \\\\alpha is the temperature lapse rate. The density as a function of elevation is :\\\\rho = \\\\rho_0 \\\\left ( 1 - \\\\frac \\\\alpha T_0 y \\\\right )^{1 / (\\\\kappa - 1)} \\\\,, where \\\\kappa is the polytropic exponent (or polytropic index). The air mass integral for the polytropic model does not lend itself to a closed-form solution except at the zenith, so the integration usually is performed numerically. =Layered atmosphere= Earth‚Äôs atmosphere consists of multiple layers with different temperature and density characteristics; common atmospheric models include the International Standard Atmosphere and the US Standard Atmosphere. A good approximation for many purposes is a polytropic troposphere of 11 km height with a lapse rate of 6.5 K/km and an isothermal stratosphere of infinite height (Garfinkel 1967), which corresponds very closely to the first two layers of the International Standard Atmosphere. More layers can be used if greater accuracy is required.The notes for Reed Meyer‚Äôs air mass calculator describe an atmospheric model using eight layers and using polynomials rather than simple linear relations for temperature lapse rates. =Refracting radially symmetrical atmosphere= When atmospheric refraction is considered, ray tracing becomes necessary, and the absolute air mass integral becomes See Thomason, Herman, and Reagan (1983) for a derivation of the integral for a refracting atmosphere. : \\\\sigma = \\\\int_{r_\\\\mathrm{obs}}^{r_\\\\mathrm{atm}} \\\\frac {\\\\rho\\\\, \\\\mathrm d r} {\\\\sqrt { 1 - \\\\left ( \\\\frac {n_\\\\mathrm{obs}} n \\\\frac {r_\\\\mathrm{obs}} r \\\\right )^2 \\\\sin^2 z}} \\\\, where n_\\\\mathrm{obs} is the index of refraction of air at the observer‚Äôs elevation y_\\\\mathrm{obs} above sea level, n is the index of refraction at elevation y above sea level, r_\\\\mathrm{obs} = R_\\\\mathrm{E} + y_\\\\mathrm{obs}, r = R_\\\\mathrm{E} + y is the distance from the center of the Earth to a point at elevation y, and r_\\\\mathrm{atm} = R_\\\\mathrm{E} + y_\\\\mathrm{atm} is distance to the upper limit of the atmosphere at elevation y_\\\\mathrm{atm}. The index of refraction in terms of density is usually given to sufficient accuracy (Garfinkel 1967) by the Gladstone‚ÄìDale relation :\\\\frac {n - 1} {n_\\\\mathrm{obs} - 1} = \\\\frac {\\\\rho} {\\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{obs}} \\\\,. Rearrangement and substitution into the absolute air mass integral gives : \\\\sigma = \\\\int_{r_\\\\mathrm{obs}}^{r_\\\\mathrm{atm}} \\\\frac {\\\\rho\\\\, \\\\mathrm d r} {\\\\sqrt { 1 - \\\\left ( \\\\frac {n_\\\\mathrm{obs}} {1 + ( n_\\\\mathrm{obs} - 1 ) \\\\rho/\\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{obs}} \\\\right )^2 \\\\left ( \\\\frac {r_\\\\mathrm{obs}} r \\\\right )^2 \\\\sin^2 z}} \\\\,. The quantity n_\\\\mathrm{obs} - 1 is quite small; expanding the first term in parentheses, rearranging several times, and ignoring terms in (n_\\\\mathrm{obs} - 1)^2 after each rearrangement, gives (Kasten and Young 1989) : \\\\sigma = \\\\int_{r_\\\\mathrm{obs}}^{r_\\\\mathrm{atm}} \\\\frac {\\\\rho\\\\, \\\\mathrm d r} {\\\\sqrt { 1 - \\\\left [ 1 + 2 ( n_\\\\mathrm{obs} - 1 )(1 - \\\\frac \\\\rho {\\\\rho_\\\\mathrm{obs}} ) \\\\right ] \\\\left ( \\\\frac {r_\\\\mathrm{obs}} r \\\\right )^2 \\\\sin^2 z}} \\\\,. =Homogeneous spherical atmosphere with elevated observer= Air mass for elevated observer in homogeneous spherical atmosphere In the figure at right, an observer at O is at an elevation y_\\\\mathrm{obs} above sea level in a uniform radially symmetrical atmosphere of height y_\\\\mathrm{atm}. The path length of a light ray at zenith angle z is s; R_\\\\mathrm{E} is the radius of the Earth. Applying the law of cosines to triangle OAC, : \\\\begin{align} \\\\left(R_{E}+y_{atm}\\\\right)^{2} & =s^{2}+\\\\left(R_{E}+y_{obs}\\\\right)^{2}-2\\\\left(R_{E}+y_{obs}\\\\right)s \\\\cos\\\\left(180^{\\\\circ}-z\\\\right)\\\\\\\\\\\\ & =s^{2}+\\\\left(R_{E}+y_{obs}\\\\right)^{2}+2\\\\left(R_{E}+y_{obs}\\\\right)s\\\\cos z\\\\end{align} expanding the left- and right-hand sides, eliminating the common terms, and rearranging gives :{{s}^{2}}+2\\\\left( {{R}_{\\\\text{E}}}+{{y}_{\\\\text{obs}}} \\\\right)s\\\\cos z-2{{R}_{\\\\text{E}}}{{y}_{\\\\text{atm}}}-y_{\\\\text{atm}}^{2}+2{{R}_{\\\\text{E}}}{{y}_{\\\\text{obs}}}+y_{\\\\text{obs}}^{2}=0 \\\\,. Solving the quadratic for the path length s, factoring, and rearranging, :s=\\\\pm \\\\sqrt{{{\\\\left( {{R}_{\\\\text{E}}}+{{y}_{\\\\text{obs}}} \\\\right)}^{2}}{{\\\\cos }^{2}}z+2{{R}_{\\\\text{E}}}\\\\left( {{y}_{\\\\text{atm }}}-{{y}_{\\\\text{obs}}} \\\\right)+y_{\\\\text{atm}}^{2}-y_{\\\\text{obs}}^{2}}-({{R}_{\\\\text{E}}}+{{y}_{\\\\text{obs}}})\\\\cos z \\\\,. The negative sign of the radical gives a negative result, which is not physically meaningful. Using the positive sign, dividing by y_\\\\mathrm{atm}, and cancelling common terms and rearranging gives the relative air mass: :X=\\\\sqrt{{{\\\\left( \\\\frac+{{y}_{\\\\text{obs}}}}} \\\\right)}^{2}}{{\\\\cos }^{2}}z+\\\\frac{2{{R}_{\\\\text{E}}}}{y_{\\\\text{atm}}^{2}}\\\\left( {{y}_{\\\\text{atm}}}-{{y}_{\\\\text{obs}}} \\\\right)-{{\\\\left( \\\\frac}} \\\\right)}^{2}}+1}-\\\\frac+{{y}_{\\\\text{obs}}}}}\\\\cos z \\\\,. With the substitutions \\\\hat{r} = R_\\\\mathrm{E} / y_\\\\mathrm{atm} and \\\\hat{y} = y_\\\\mathrm{obs} / y_\\\\mathrm{atm}, this can be given as :X=\\\\sqrt{{{(\\\\hat{r}+\\\\hat{y})}^{2}}{{\\\\cos }^{2}}z + 2 \\\\hat{r} (1-\\\\hat{y}) - \\\\hat{y}^2 +1} \\\\; - \\\\; (\\\\hat{r}+\\\\hat{y})\\\\cos z \\\\,. When the observer‚Äôs elevation is zero, the air mass equation simplifies to :X=\\\\sqrt{{{\\\\left( \\\\frac}} \\\\right)}^{2}}{{\\\\cos }^{2}}z+\\\\frac{2{{R}_{\\\\text{E}}}}}+1}-\\\\frac}}\\\\cos z \\\\,. In the limit of grazing incidence, the absolute airmass equals the distance to the horizon. Furthermore, if the observer is elevated, the horizon zenith angle can be greater than 90¬∞. Maximum zenith angle for elevated observer in homogeneous spherical atmosphere Nonuniform distribution of attenuating species Atmospheric models that derive from hydrostatic considerations assume an atmosphere of constant composition and a single mechanism of extinction, which isn‚Äôt quite correct. There are three main sources of attenuation (Hayes and Latham 1975): Rayleigh scattering by air molecules, Mie scattering by aerosols, and molecular absorption (primarily by ozone). The relative contribution of each source varies with elevation above sea level, and the concentrations of aerosols and ozone cannot be derived simply from hydrostatic considerations. Rigorously, when the extinction coefficient depends on elevation, it must be determined as part of the air mass integral, as described by Thomason, Herman, and Reagan (1983). A compromise approach often is possible, however. Methods for separately calculating the extinction from each species using closed-form expressions are described in Schaefer (1993) and Schaefer (1998). The latter reference includes source code for a BASIC program to perform the calculations. Reasonably accurate calculation of extinction can sometimes be done by using one of the simple air mass formulas and separately determining extinction coefficients for each of the attenuating species (Green 1992, Pickering 2002).  Implications   Air mass and astronomy  Atmospheric transmittance across the electromagnetic spectrum. In optical astronomy, the air mass provides an indication of the deterioration of the observed image, not only as regards direct effects of spectral absorption, scattering and reduced brightness, but also an aggregation of visual aberrations, e.g. resulting from atmospheric turbulence, collectively referred to as the quality of the \\"seeing\\".Observing tips: air mass and differential refraction retrieved 15 May 2011. On bigger telescopes, such as the WHT (Wynne and Warsick 1988) and VLT (Avila, Rupprecht, and Becker 1997), the atmospheric dispersion can be so severe that it affects the pointing of the telescope to the target. In such cases an atmospheric dispersion compensator is used, which usually consists of two prisms. The Greenwood frequency and Fried parameter, both relevant for adaptive optics, depend on the air mass above them (or more specifically, on the zenith angle). In radio astronomy the air mass (which influences the optical path length) is not relevant. The lower layers of the atmosphere, modeled by the air mass, do not significantly impede radio waves, which are of much lower frequency than optical waves. Instead, some radio waves are affected by the ionosphere in the upper atmosphere. Newer aperture synthesis radio telescopes are especially affected by this as they ‚Äúsee‚Äù a much larger portion of the sky and thus the ionosphere. In fact, LOFAR needs to explicitly calibrate for these distorting effects (van der Tol and van der Veen 2007; de Vos, Gunst, and Nijboer 2009), but on the other hand can also study the ionosphere by instead measuring these distortions (Thid√© 2007).  Air mass and solar energy  Solar irradiance spectrum above atmosphere and at surface In some fields, such as solar energy and photovoltaics, air mass is indicated by the acronym AM; additionally, the value of the air mass is often given by appending its value to AM, so that AM1 indicates an air mass of 1, AM2 indicates an air mass of 2, and so on. The region above Earth's atmosphere, where there is no atmospheric attenuation of solar radiation, is considered to have \\"air mass zero\\" (AM0). Atmospheric attenuation of solar radiation is not the same for all wavelengths; consequently, passage through the atmosphere not only reduces intensity but also alters the spectral irradiance. Photovoltaic modules are commonly rated using spectral irradiance for an air mass of 1.5 (AM1.5); tables of these standard spectra are given in ASTM G 173-03. The extraterrestrial spectral irradiance (i.e., that for AM0) is given in ASTM E 490-00a. ASTM E 490-00a was reapproved without change in 2006. For many solar energy applications when high accuracy near the horizon is not required, air mass is commonly determined using the simple secant formula described in the section Plane- parallel atmosphere.

Astronomical imaging Observational astronomy Atmospheric optical phenomena ","title":"Air mass (astronomy)"},{"id":"705642","text":"Wellington is a small market town in rural Somerset, a county in the west of England, situated south west of Taunton in the Somerset West and Taunton district, near the border with Devon, which runs along the Blackdown Hills to the south of the town. The town has a population of 14,549, which includes the residents of the parish of Wellington Without, and the villages of Tone and Tonedale. Known as Weolingtun in the Anglo-Saxon period, its name had changed to Walintone by the time of the Domesday Book of 1086. Wellington became a town under a royal charter of 1215 and during the Middle Ages it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter. Major rebuilding took place following a fire in the town in 1731, after which it became a centre for cloth-making. Wellington gave its name to the first Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, who is commemorated by the nearby Wellington Monument. Following his victory at the Battle of Talavera in the Peninsular War, Arthur Wellesley was offered a peerage. The question was what title should he take. His brother, Richard Wellesley, Earl of Mornington, looked around and discovered that a manor in the parish of Wellington was available. It was also reasonably close to the family name. Because Arthur was still in Spain in command of the army fighting the French, Richard oversaw the purchase. By this process Arthur therefore became Marquess of Wellington. According to the book Wellington as Military Commander by Michael Glover, Arthur Wellesley first signed himself 'Wellington' on 16 September 1809. At the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, Arthur Wellesley was already further elevated to the peerage rank of the Duke of Wellington. At the time he became Ambassador to France, The London Gazette of 4 June 1814 refers to him as having that title but suggests that it was granted by warrant on 25 August 1812. The Grand Western Canal reached the town in 1835 and then the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1843. The town's own railway station survived until 1964. Wellington was home of Fox, Fowler and Company, which was the last commercial bank permitted to print their own sterling banknotes in England and Wales. In the 20th century closer links with Taunton meant that many of the residents of Wellington commuted there for work, and the M5 motorway enabled car journeys to be made more easily. Local industries, which now include an aerosol factory and bed manufacturers, are celebrated at the Wellington Museum in Fore street. Wellington is home to the independent Wellington School, and state-funded Court Fields School. It is also home to a range of cultural, sporting and religious sites including the 15th century Church of St John the Baptist. The capital city of New Zealand is named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, being recognised as having some influence in the company that founded the New Zealand town. The New Zealand capital therefore takes its name ultimately from the English town of Wellington in Somerset. History In a grant of between 899 and 909, Edward the Elder, gave the land then known as Weolingtun, which means \\"wealthy estate\\", along with West Buckland and Bishops Lydeard to Bishop Asser. This was in exchange for the monastery of Plympton in Devon. An alternative explanation for the origin of the name is \\"the settlement in the temple clearing\\". By the time of the Domesday Book of 1086, the name had changed to Walintone, and the estate was owned by Gisa (Bishop of Wells). The parish of Wellington was part of the Kilmersdon Hundred, A site at Longforth Farm near Tonedale has been identified as having Bronze Age occupation and, during excavations prior to the building of new homes, found to have been occupied by a 12th-14th century building with decorated floor tiles covering . A royal charter of 1215 gave Wellington its status as a town, and during the medieval period it grew as a centre for trade on the road from Bristol to Exeter, being laid out, with the church at the east end of town, in a similar manner to other towns of this era. In 1548, the manor was sold to Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, but reverted to the control of the bishops after his execution. By the end of the 16th century it had come under the protection of John Popham (judge) and his descendants who built a manor house which was destroyed during the English Civil War. Major rebuilding took place in the town following a fire in 1731. After this the town's importance grew as it became a centre for clothmaking across Somerset and Devon, its importance as trade centre enhanced by fires in Taunton and Tiverton. By the 1831 census, 258 people were recorded as cloth workers in Wellington. Arthur Wellesley took the title of his Marquessate in 1809 from this town of Wellington. Nearby Wellington Hill boasts a large, spotlit obelisk to his honour, the Wellington Monument. The Wellington Monument is a floodlit high triangular tower designated by English Heritage as a grade II* listed building. It was erected to celebrate the Duke of Wellington's victory at the Battle of Waterloo. The foundation stone was laid in 1817, on land belonging to the Duke, but, owing to funding problems, the monument was not completed until 1854. It is now owned by the National Trust, who announced plans to reclad the monument at a cost of ¬£4 million in 2009. Site of the Grand Western Canal In the 18th century turnpikes arrived in the area and then in the 19th communications improved with the building of the Grand Western Canal, which reached the town in 1835, and then the Bristol and Exeter Railway. Wellington station was opened when the line reached the town on 1 May 1843. It was a typical Brunel design but was rebuilt in 1932 when two loop lines were put in. This entailed the platforms being moved back to accommodate the widened lines. These platforms are clearly visible and a goods shed still stands on the east side of the line at the Taunton end of the station, although the station closed on 5 October 1964. Wellington was an important station as it stood at the foot of a steep incline. Banking locomotives were kept here, ready to assist heavy westbound trains up to Whiteball Tunnel. In the 20th century closer links with Taunton meant that many of the residents of Wellington commuted there for work, and the M5 motorway, which opened in sections in the 1960s and 1970s,Charlesworth, George (1984). A History of British Motorways. London: Thomas Telford Ltd. . enabled car journeys to be made more easily. Fox Fowler & Co. Bank Fox, Fowler Bank of Wellington ¬£5 Note Thomas Fox started the Fox, Fowler and Company bank in Wellington which rapidly expanded and ran successfully, until it merged with Lloyds Bank in 1927. It was the last private bank in England to issue its own notes and they were legal tender until 1964. There are nine notes left in circulation. The British Museum have another example on display. The bank established its Head Office at the old family house in Fore Street, Wellington (today the Lloyds Bank branch) - they opened branches at Taunton, Bridgwater, Weston-super-Mare, Torrington, Bideford, Barnstaple, Ilfracombe and South Molton. The original ¬£5 Note is on display at Tone Dale House - one of the last nine and possible the only one left uncancelled. Governance Wellington Fire Station Wellington has three tiers of local government at parish, district and county level. The present system dates from 1 April 1974 when the Local Government Act 1972 came into effect. The lowest tier is Wellington Town Council, formed as a successor parish to Wellington Urban District Council in 1974. The town council has 15 councillors, and is headed by a town mayor. For elections of town councillors, the town is divided into four wards: Wellington East (returning 4 councillors), Wellington North (4), Rockwell Green (3) and Wellington West (4). The political composition of the council in November 2009 was Liberal Democrats 7, Conservative Party 5 and Labour Party 3. The town council provides purely local services. An area to the south of the town falls within the civil parish of Wellington Without. The middle, or district, tier of administration is the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. The council is based in Taunton, and consists of 59 councillors. There are three electoral wards in Wellington (North, South and West). Five councillors are elected from wards in Wellington: two are Liberal Democrats, one Conservative, one Labour and one independent. The upper tier is Somerset County Council. Also based in Taunton, the council has 58 councillors, each elected for a single-member electoral division. Most of the town comprises the Wellington electoral division, with part falling in the mainly rural division of Blackdown & Wellington East. They are represented by one Labour and one Liberal Democrat councillor. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, the library, roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. For elections to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, Wellington forms part of the Taunton Deane constituency. The constituency elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Following the review of parliamentary representation in Somerset, the Boundary Commission for England has created a modified Taunton constituency with the name change Taunton Deane, to reflect the district name Geography Entrance to Wellington Park The town has many dependent villages including West Buckland, Langford Budville, Nynehead, Sampford Arundel and Sampford Moor. The formerly independent village of Rockwell Green, to the west of the town, has been incorporated into the town however there is still a green wedge of land in between them. Wellington Park was a gift from the Quaker Fox family to the town in 1903 as a memorial to the coronation of King Edward VII. The gardens were laid out by F.W. Meyer, who included a rock garden which used 80 tons of limestone from Westleigh quarry near Burlescombe. It is Grade II listed on the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. It was restored at a cost of ¬£412,827 which included a grant of ¬£296,500 from the Heritage Lottery Fund Public Parks Initiative. There are Local Nature Reserves at Wellington Basins on the western fringe of the town. It includes a small pond and boardwalk with a variety of wildlife habitats. The grassland, hedges and woodland are home to a varied flora and fauna including birds such as the grey wagtail, dipper and reed bunting. Five separate bat species have been recorded at the site. Swains Pond in the south of Wellington is another Local Nature Reserve, which used to be the site of orchards. It now includes a pond which provides a home for amphibians including the great crested newt, palmate newt and toads. Climate Wellington has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfb). Along with the rest of South West England, Wellington has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west. Demography The town has a population of 13,696. Large growth occurred during the 1970s when housing developments were built on the south side of the town. These were largely prompted by Wellington's proximity to Junction 26 of the M5 motorway. Economy Fore Street Wellington's main industry was wool-making and in November 2009, Deborah Meaden, best known from Dragons' Den a BBC television programme, invested in the Fox Brothers' Mill which produces wool cloth for Savile Row, designers and clients around the world. The Fox family established the mill in 1772. The Tonedale mill complex includes two listed buildings, some of which were still being used until 2000. The Prince's Regeneration Trust have been supporting the Tone Mill Regeneration Partnership in attempting to preserve and regenerate the area with a mixed development for commercial and residential use. It is included in the Heritage at Risk Register produced by English Heritage. The last Fox family house in Wellington Tone Dale House is still owned by Ben and Victoria Fox, Ben is the great- great-great-great-grandson of Thomas Fox. Tone Dale House (since 1996) is also now run as a thriving events and hire venue, for house parties, anniversaries, weddings and corporate events, through their company The Big House Co. Tone Dale House Local industries are celebrated at the Wellington Museum in Fore Street. Wellington was home of Fox, Fowler and Company, which was the last commercial bank permitted to print their own sterling banknotes in England and Wales. The town is still largely dependent on industry, along with the neighbouring towns Taunton and Bridgwater with manufacturing industries identified within the county economic strategy as key centres for further economic development, due to good transport links. Swallowfield plc benefited from the growth of own-brand products during the 1970s and now produces aerosol, cosmetic and toiletry products. It was founded in 1876 as Walter Gregory & Co Ltd who manufactured animal husbandry products. The company diversified and in 1950 produced the first commercial aerosols in the UK which were basically farm products, air fresheners and insecticides. Bed manufacturers Relyon employ some 400 people. The company started in 1858 as a wool merchant, Price Brothers and Co., but the business soon moved into manufacturing beds and in 1935 changed its name to Relyon Ltd. In 2001 it was acquired by Steinhoff International Holdings Ltd., a quoted South African group. Transport The goods shed and railway station site at Wellington The town was served by Wellington railway station on the Bristol and Exeter Railway from 1 May 1843 until 5 October 1964. It was here that extra locomotives were attached to heavy trains to help them up the incline to Whiteball Tunnel on their way south. The railway from Penzance to London, and also to Bristol and the North, continue to pass through the town, but no trains stop. The nearest railway stations are Taunton and Tiverton Parkway. A campaign was started to reopen the railway station in 2009. The town is close to junction 26 of the M5 motorway, which spent a year in the 1970s as a temporary terminal junction, whilst the motorway between junctions 26 and 27 was finished. The A38 is also still a very important link to Taunton. Education Wellington is home to a public school, Wellington School. It was founded in 1837 as an all-boys school. A solitary day girl was allowed to join the Sixth Form in 1972 and the following year Wellington became co- educational. The school opened a new junior school in 2000, having previously only catered for pupils aged 10 and over. In December 2007, the school commissioned its new multi-purpose examination hall and English Department adjacent to its Sports Centre. Notable alumni of Wellington School include actor David Suchet, chef Keith Floyd and peer Lord Archer. The main secondary school in the town is Court Fields School. The 11‚Äì16 school includes a sports complex, completed in early 2008. Religious sites Church of St John the Baptist, Wellington Despite its small size, Wellington has historically been notable for its profusion of churches of many different denominations, including a Quaker meeting house, the Grade I listed, 15th century Church of St John the Baptist, which includes a monument to John Popham, and the Roman Catholic Church of St John Fisher which was built in 1606 as Popham's Almshouses and converted into a Roman Catholic church 1936. Also there was a Presbyterian Independent Church. Culture Wellesley Cinema Wellington has its own amateur dramatic group, formed in the 1960s, called Wellington Arts Association, which holds productions both at Wellington Arts Centre and at the Wellesley Theatre. It includes the Genesis Youth Theatre Group, Operatic Society, Pantomime Group, Civic Players, Arcadians and the Spectrum Arts And Crafts. The Wellesley Cinema was built in 1937, in the traditional Art Deco style of that period. The auditorium seats 400 people on two levels and is run as an independent cinema. Wellington and District Camera Club meets in the New Science Block, Wellington School. The club is affiliated to the Western Counties Photographic Federation (W.C.P.F.) and also to Wellington Arts Association (W.A.A.). The town also has its own weekly newspaper, the Wellington Weekly News, which was first published in 1860. There is also a community website providing news and views about the town, Around Wellington. The town is home to Wellington Silver Band, a fourth section brass band. The band can trace its origins to 1887, when it was formed from the volunteer band of the 2nd Battalion, Prince Albert's Somersetshire Light Infantry. Wellington is twinned to the town of Immenstadt in Germany, the town of Lillebonne in France and Torres Vedras in Portugal. Sport Wellington Cricket Club have a ground off Courtland Road, and have two teams in the Somerset Cricket League. Wellington A.F.C. football Club was formed in 1892 and now play in the Western Football League. Wellington Bowmen is an archery club formed in 2001. It uses facilities at the rugby club and at Court Fields Community School. The Rugby club itself was founded in 1874. The first team plays in the Western Counties West League. The Grand National winning horse, Miinnehoma was prepared for his victory in the 1994 race by Martin Pipe at his Pond House Stables in the town.

The members are Alain Caron (bass guitar), Michel Cusson (guitar), and Paul Brochu (drums). The band won a number of Canadian awards during the 1980s.By 1989, international sales of UZEB's first eight recordings had exceeded 200,000 units, which the Encyclopedia of Music in Canada calls \\"an unprecedented figure for a Canadian jazz group\\".\\"UZEB,\\" Encyclopedia of Music in Canada. Web, Nov. 18, 2010. History UZEB was formed in 1976 in Drummondville, Quebec, when guitarist Michel Cusson and bassist Alain Caron started a jazz duo. The band originally named itself Eus√®be Jazz, their first concert (in Acton Vale, QC) being on the birthday of St-Eus√®be. This name was later shortened to UZEB. The band soon moved to Montreal. Drummer Paul Brochu joined Cusson and Caron in 1978. Until 1987, the band included a keyboardist: first Jean St-Jacques, followed by Stephan Montanaro (featured on the album Live in Bracknell), Sylvain Coutu, and then Michel Cyr. In the 1980s, UZEB had what was then a very technologically advanced MIDI system for its synthesizers. After 1987, UZEB became a trio consisting of Cusson, Caron, and Brochu. UZEB won Quebec F√©lix awards as group of the year in 1984 and 1989 (in competition with Quebec pop and rock bands). As well, the band won awards for jazz album of the year in 1983, 1984, 1986, and 1987. UZEB did Quebec-wide and several Canadian tours. In 1991 UZEB received the Oscar Peterson Lifetime Achievement Award, which was presented at the 1991 Montreal International Jazz Festival. UZEB played its first European concert in 1981 at the Bracknell (England) Jazz Festival. In 1983, UZEB appeared at the Festival de Jazz de Paris and recorded at the Olympia in Paris. UZEB also played in other European countries and in Southeast Asia (in 1990). However, UZEB rarely played concerts in the US. UZEB's most popular songs include \\"Junk Funk\\", \\"Smiles and Chuckles\\", \\"Mile 'O'\\", \\"60 rue des Lombards\\", \\"Spider\\", and \\"Uzeb Club\\". In 2017, the band reformed for a series of five concerts in Europe and fourteen in Quebec.

History Wellington School is situated to the south of the centre of the small town of Wellington. It was founded in 1837 as an all-boys school by Benjamin Frost (Headmaster 1837‚Äì1848). It was later purchased and run by Frost's wife and William Corner (Headmaster 1848‚Äì1879). The school first came into existence on its present site in 1837, as a private boys school. Girls were accepted in 1972. The school's arms consist of one quarter of the Duke of Wellington's arms, the dragons represent the County of Somerset and the open book represents learning. The school is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. The school opened a new junior school in 2000, having previously only catered for pupils aged 10 and over. This was renamed \\"Wellington Prep School\\" in 2015. In 2003 the Princess Royal opened the Princess Royal Sports Complex, a ¬£2.65 million indoor sports facility. Since September 2007, there have been no lessons on a Saturday. This has been replaced with activities that incorporate music, drama and sport as well as activities for the boarders. The Good Schools Guide, described Wellington School as \\"Friendly, purposeful and busy, it is a solid, well-managed school, neat but not glossy, giving its pupils a sound education and masses of high points in developmental experience.\\" Sports The school has rugby pitches, cricket squares, football pitches, an all-weather pitch, all-weather training areas, tennis courts, squash courts, climbing wall and an indoor swimming pool. Football was reintroduced in the 2003 school year. Hockey is the most prestigious sport at Wellington. Many students have gone on to represent the school in county and England hockey, national athletics, county and England fencing and county rugby. Music The school's music department, dedicated to the ex-headmaster George Corner, includes a recording studio, iMac suite, and percussion studio as well as many practice rooms and two classrooms. All 15 pianos in the department are by Steinway & Sons, accrediting the school as an 'All Steinway School', the first of its kind in England.http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/somerset/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8959000/8959818.stm Regular concerts are held throughout the school year, performance spaces include the department's 'Small Hall', the school's main hall (Great Hall) and the school chapel which is fitted with an electronic organ alongside a Steinway baby grand. Drama Drama is offered as part of the curriculum for all pupils in years 7-9 and can be taken as a choice at GCSE and A Level. Wellington boasts several highly celebrated actors amongst its alumni, including David Suchet who opened the school's dedicated drama studio in 2010. Chapel The School Chapel Built between 1928 and 1931 by C. H. Biddulph- Pinchard, the Grade II listed.http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-487378-wellington-school- war-memorial-chapel-we red brick building is dressed with stone and has a flat roof which is concealed behind a parapet. It is a rectangular single-cell chapel with a carved stone altar. The Chapel went through specialist restoration work in 2013 which involved the repainting of the ceiling among other maintenance tasks. This restoration was funded partly by the school's Old Wellingtonians' Association The east end of the building holds choir stalls and an organ loft over the entrance vestibule. The interior is highly decorated with finely carved wooden wall panels and elaborately decorated canopies made of molded plaster. The Church of England Chapel has a full-time Chaplain who prepares pupils for Confirmation annually. Though some assemblies and concerts are also held in the building, there are Sunday services throughout term time for boarders and members of the public; these involve regular performances by the school's chapel choir. There are also shorter services most days during the week with pupils attending on a house rota basis. The Chapel was built as a memorial to those who fell during the first world war. George Corner, the then headmaster, wrote to the Old Boys and asked for their support in the project. The 37 members of the Wellington School Community who gave their lives are listed on the walls of the Chapel. Each year a pupil from each boarding house remembers one former pupil specifically, researching how and where they died and a basket of flowers is laid in their memory. Confirmation and all the other occasional offices of the church are open to all members of the school community on request. Combined Cadet Force The school has a marching band and active Combined Cadet Force, founded in 1901. The Combined Cadet Force is open to senior school pupils, and has upwards of 170 cadets across the Royal Navy, Army and Air Force sections. The cadets learn military based skills such as drill, weapons handling, map and compass, battlecraft, climbing, abseiling and leadership development. There are various CCF camps, military training weekends and cadet competitions each year, during which the cadets go on field manoeuvres in order to apply the skills they have learned in a practical situation. Wellington School is unique in having three field exercises a year, each lasting three days and two nights. A full-time member of staff at Wellington School runs the CCF and acts as the senior officer. He is assisted by an experienced warrant officer. The cadets are required to present themselves for inspection by the masters in charge of each section on a weekly basis.

Early life  Lee Evans was born on February 25, 1947, in Madera, California. At the age of four, Evans moved to Fresno where he would attend Madison Elementary School for eight years. In his last year at Madison Elementary, he trained for his first race by racing his friends at school. Evans went to Central Union High School where he was classified in the C class for the 660 yd dash due to his height, weight, and age. Due to his mother contracting Valley Fever the Evans‚Äô family moved to San Jose, California, during Lee's sophomore year. While running for Overfelt High School, Evans was undefeated in his high school career, improving his 440-yard time from 48.2 in 1964 to 46.9 in 1965. Evans was granted the prestige of being a Fulbright Scholar. He attended San Jose State, where he was coached by Hall of Famer Lloyd (Bud) Winter. As a freshman, he won his first AAU championship in 440 yd (402.34 m) in 1966. He won the AAU title four years in a row (1966‚Äì1969) and again in 1972 and added the NCAA 400 m title in 1968.Lee Evans. USATF. Retrieved on July 15, 2015. His only defeat during that streak came at the hands of San Jose State teammate Tommie Smith. The two were so competitive, Winter could not let them practice together. Lee Evans achieved his first world record in 1966, as a member of the USA national team which broke the 4 √ó 400 m relay record at Los Angeles, the first team to better 3 minutes (2:59.6) for the event. The next year he broke the 4 x 220 yd (201.17 m) relay world record at Fresno in a time of 1:22.1. In 1967, Evans won the 400 metres at the Pan American Games, in an automatic time of 44.95, which (in the era of hand times) was the first bona fide automatic time to break 45 seconds.JC First sub-45 sec 400m. Run-down.com (August 23, 1947). Retrieved on 2015-07-15.  Olympics  Evans was an influential leader in regards to the black power movement. The Olympic Project for Human Rights began with black students protesting in order to have equal housing opportunities and was made into the black power movement after a Tommie Smith interview. Tommie Smith and John Carlos were the face of the movement, but Smith and Evans were the driving forces behind the movement. Carlos was said to have not even come to any of the meetings of the group, but when it came time to be in the spotlight he took his chance and claimed his spot in the history books. The black athletes of the 1968 Mexican Olympics chose not to protest the Olympics as a whole, instead they chose to protest by wearing an article of black clothing during every event in which they participated. Evans wanted the world to understand the way he felt about the Mexican Olympic Games but did not want to take away from the winners and the sports themselves. In regards to the South African Olympic Ban, Vince Matthews asked Evans what would happen after the verdict because of his position as OPHR organizer. Evans replied by saying that it was unclear as to what the International Olympic Committee would decide, but whatever the decision was the United States Olympic Team would stick together. Evans received death threats prior to and during the Olympics and claimed that had he not had these threats on his mind he probably could have run faster than he did, even though he broke a world record. Evans won the 1968 Olympic trials at Echo Summit, California with a world record 44.06 and demolished it in the Olympic final, winning in 43.86 seconds aged 21 years and 8 months, from which he still stands as the thirteenth best performer in history. Evans won a second gold as the anchorman on the 4 √ó 400 m relay team, setting another world record of 2:56.16. Both the times stood as a world record for almost twenty years (the relay, for almost 24 years). While accepting the relay Gold medal Evans, with fellow African-American medalists Larry James and Ron Freeman, received their medals wearing berets in imitation of the Black Panther Party.Lee Evans. NNDB (July 17, 2008). Retrieved on 2015-07-15. After winning the AAU 400 m titles in 1969 and 1972, Evans finished only fourth in the 1972 Olympic trials, but was named a member of the 4 √ó 400 m relay team once more. However, the United States couldn't field a team because Vincent Matthews and Wayne Collett were suspended by the IOC for a demonstration at a medal ceremony similar to the one staged by Tommie Smith and John Carlos in the previous Olympics.  Post Olympics  Evans became a professional after the 1972 season joining the International Track Association (ITA) tour. He had some success on the ITA tour notably setting a 600 m indoors world best at the first meet in Idaho State University's Minidome.Reid, Ron (March 12, 1973) \\"It Wasn't Small Potatoes In Pocatello\\", Sports Illustrated. The ITA folded in 1976 and Evans was reinstated as an amateur in 1980 and ran a 46.5 in one of his few appearances that year, at the age of thirty-three. Evans went on to head the national athletics programs in six different African Nations before accepting a position as head cross country/track & field coach at the University of South Alabama. Evans' college and amateur careers as well as his involvement in the Civil Rights Movement is chronicled in Frank Murphy's The Last Protest: Lee Evans in Mexico City. Evans was inducted into the United States National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1983.

Historically, the Chihuahua as developed in Mexico and the United States has displayed a \\"hole in the head\\". It is very common in the breed and historically was regarded as a mark of purity for this brachycephalic miniature dog breed. It is still mentioned in many Chihuahua breed standards, however, it is considered a fault in European countries because of concern that this might reflect underlying malformations such as hydrocephalus and ventriculomegaly, Chiari-like malformation and syringomyelia. Fontanelles are fibrous, membrane-covered gaps that lie between the skull bones and at the intersection of the cranial sutures. The cranial sutures are the junctions between cranial (or skull) bones. The fontanelles serve as the major sites of bone expansion during post- natal skull growth which accommodates the enlarging brain. The Chihuahua likely has a molera because of neuroparenchymal disproportion i.e. a proportionally big brain for the skull. This is likely because there is premature closure of the skull base cranial sutures (brachycephaly due to craniosynostosis). To accommodate the developing brain there is increased growth of the skull bone in a parallel plane giving the dog a characterised domed or \\"apple-headed\\" appearance. Explanation of often misquoted veterinary sources (Greene and Braund / Rivers and Walker) Many internet sources state incorrectly that there was a study on molera performed by Greene and Braund in 1989 which (paraphrasing) \\"did not find an connection between moleras and hydrocephalus in toy breeds such as the Chihuahua\\". There was no such study. This was an unreferenced statement, although it reflected clinical experience, and was made over 30 years ago in the 3rd edition of Ettinger's Veterinary Internal Medicine. This statement was not kept in subsequent editions and this tome is now being revised for the 9th edition. It is also incorrectly stated on multiple websites that there was \\"a separate study conducted by Dr. Walker and Dr. Rivers at the University of Minnesota that found no correlation between the presence or size of a molera and hydrocephalus\\". This is also incorrect. This study was entitled \\"Hydrocephalus in the Dog: Utility of Ultrasonography as an Alternate Diagnostic Imaging Technique\\" Rivers and Walter published in Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association in 1992. The question that this study actually addressed was whether ventricles and associated cerebrospinal fluid pathways could be investigated by ultrasound through the persistent bregmatic fontanelle (molera). There were 26 dogs in the study of which 6 had clinical hydrocephalous (i.e. were neurologically abnormal). Of the 6 dogs with clinical hydrocephalus (2 x chihuahua, 1 x poodle x, 1 x Pomeranian, 1 x Boston terrier and 1 x Yorkshire terrier), ultrasound through the molera was helpful in confirming the diagnosis of hydrocephalus noninvasively and provided information about dilation of the lateral, 3rd and cranial cerebral aqueduct. Ultrasound through the molera was also useful in revealing ventriculomegaly in 5 of 20 (supposedly) clinically normal dogs and these included Chihuahua (9 months old, mentation depressed), Lhasa Apso (5 weeks old), 2x Shih Tzu (3 and 5 weeks old) and Affenpinscher (9 weeks old ‚Äì and returned to breeder because dull).The remaining 15 dogs (14 shih tzu and 1 Lhasa Apso) had normal ventricle size according to this ultrasound study. 14/15 of the dogs in the study were 6 weeks old or less i.e. the study was predominantly in puppies not adult dogs. The older dog was a 5 year old Shih Tzu. In other words all the Chihuahua in this study were affected with hydrocephalus and molera; this study did not investigate presence or size of a molera and hydrocephalus.  References  Greene CE.

It is also known for the 1970 film adaptation by Bernardo Bertolucci. Plot summary Prologue In the prologue, the reader witnesses numerous formative events from a short period in Marcello's childhood. In the first, Marcello coldly kills several lizards in the yard between his home and the home of his neighbor and friend, Roberto. He tries to coax Roberto into offering approval of this behavior, and when Roberto doesn‚Äôt comply, they fight and Roberto leaves. Marcello later obtains a slingshot and fires a few stones through the ivy that covers the fence around Roberto's family's house, only to find that he has killed their family cat instead of Roberto. Marcello is mortified not so much by his actions but by what he perceives as the abnormality of his sentiments. Marcello also witnesses a fight between his parents that is later revealed to mark the beginning of his father's decline into mental illness. Marcello's mother and housemaid discover that his father has vandalized a photograph of Marcello and his mother by poking holes through their eyes and drawing streaks of blood on their faces. His father ultimately chases his mother around the house and attacks her in the bedroom, leaving Marcello torn between whether to rescue his mother or aid his father. It is revealed that Marcello's father often physically abuses the boy. The final section of the prologue covers Marcello's torment at the hands of his classmates, who use his somewhat effeminate appearance to question his gender. One day, five classmates follow Marcello home from school and try to force him to wear a skirt, but their attack is interrupted by a chauffeur who happens on the scene and offers to drive Marcello home. En route, the chauffeur appears to proposition Marcello, offering him a pistol in exchange for unspecified actions. The chauffeur, who reveals himself to be a former priest de-frocked for indecent behavior, ultimately stops himself before initiating any actions with Marcello and begs the boy to ignore him if he tries to speak to him again. Marcello doesn‚Äôt fully understand what is happening, and his desire for the pistol leads him to go with the chauffeur again a few days later. This time, the chauffeur, named Lino, locks himself in the room with Marcello and tells the boy that he won‚Äôt be able to escape the (still unspoken) abuse to come. During the struggle, Lino's gun comes loose and Marcello grabs it. When Lino tells Marcello to shoot him, he complies and flees out the window. Part I Part I opens with Marcello, now a state employee of the Italian Fascist government, looking through old newspaper clippings for information on the incident with Lino. He ultimately finds an obituary that blames the death on an accident during the cleaning of the gun. While Marcello does not feel true remorse, he does seek some absolution for this incident throughout the novel. A colleague of Marcello named Orlando asks Marcello to participate in a mission to Paris. A former professor of Marcello, named Quadri, is now an anti-fascist agitator, and the Italian government would like to infiltrate his organization. Marcello is also due to be married shortly to a woman named Giulia, and offers to take his honeymoon in Paris so that his presence there would not be suspicious to Quadri. Marcello also takes confession, despite his apparent atheism, as a prelude to the Catholic wedding his wife expects. He confesses to murdering Lino, and the priest indicates that he can seek absolution if he feels true remorse for his actions ‚Äì an emotion that Marcello does not appear capable of feeling. The section closes in the days leading up to Marcello's wedding, and we see his mother-in-law lavishing praise upon him, in stark contrast to his mother, who now lives alone in squalor. His father has been in an asylum for six years and suffers from the delusion that he is one of Mussolini's top aides. On the way to see his father, Marcello's mother gives him a wedding present but indicates that she won‚Äôt be attending the ceremony. Marcello and his mother make their monthly visit to his father, who neither recognizes them nor even acknowledges their presence. Part II Part II covers the honeymoon and the odd interpersonal relationships that unfold between Marcello, Giulia, Quadri, and Quadri's voluptuous young wife, Anna. En route to Paris, Marcello makes a scheduled stop at a brothel in a small, unnamed town in France, where he is to meet Agent Orlando for further instructions. At the brothel, Marcello is mistaken for a client, causing him some embarrassment before Orlando arrives to tell him that the new plan is to kill Quadri. Marcello needs simply to confirm Quadri's identity to Orlando to fulfill his duties. As he is leaving, Marcello realizes he has forgotten his hat, but when he goes to retrieve it, he finds Orlando with his arm around a prostitute to whom Marcello feels a strange attraction. Marcello experiences the same feeling when he and Giulia head to Quadri's apartment, as Anna reminds him in some ways of that prostitute, and Marcello tells himself that he is in love with Anna despite her apparent dislike for him. Anna allows Marcello to begin to seduce her, but always keeps him at arm's length, even telling him that she and Quadri are aware that he is a spy there in service of the Italian government. While Anna and Giulia head out shopping, Marcello is accosted by an old man who first mistakes him for a beggar, and then mistakes him for a homosexual or perhaps a prostitute, revisiting the humiliation of the incident with Lino on Marcello. When the old man refuses to take Marcello back to his hotel, Marcello pulls his gun and demands to be let out of the vehicle. Marcello's feelings for Anna intensify alongside a growing contempt for her when he sees her attempting to seduce Giulia and realizes that her interest in him is merely for show. Anna's pursuit of Giulia leads to an argument in a nightclub where Giulia tells Anna that she is not a lesbian and has no interest in an affair. At a dinner, Quadri asks Marcello to post a letter for him on his way back to Italy, as Quadri's activities are monitored and the letter might be intercepted otherwise. Marcello refuses, and Quadri takes this as a sign of solidarity, as Marcello could have taken the letter and turned it over to the authorities instead. However, Marcello does confirm Quadri's identity to Orlando, and on a trip to Savoy, Quadri ‚Äì as well as Anna, who left with him in response to Giulia's rejection ‚Äì is killed by Orlando and his men. Epilogue The epilogue briefly explores Marcello's conflicted responses to his role in the murders of Quadri and Lino, including his attempts to rationalize away his culpability. The epilogue takes place years later, on the night that Mussolini falls from power. Giulia reveals that she has long suspected that Marcello was involved in the murders, but her sorrow is more for their own safety than for Marcello's victims or his duplicity. The two go out for a drive and walk that evening, and while Giulia tries to convince Marcello to make love to her in a wooded area, a stranger arrives and calls to Marcello by name. Marcello is floored to see that it is Lino. Marcello shows real emotion for the first time in the book when he screams at Lino and blames him for ruining his life by taking his innocence. Lino defends himself by arguing that the loss of innocence is inevitable and is merely a part of the human experience. This speech leads Marcello to the beginning of acceptance of his own non-conformity. The novel's closing passage has Marcello, Giulia, and their daughter driving to the mountains to evade possible reprisals for Marcello's role with the government. En route, they drive into an air raid, and their car is strafed with bullets. Giulia and the daughter are killed in the first wave, and Marcello falls out of the car, wounded. Realizing his wife and daughter are dead, he waits for the second wave to return. The novel ends with Marcello hearing the plane's approach. Major themes Marcello spends the entire novel in a search for what he perceives to be a normal life - normal activities, a normal appearance, normal emotions, and so on. However, he confuses normality with conformity, and in his quest to conform, subjugates his already-repressed emotions. When the natural course of his life presents him with ethical dilemmas - the assignment to betray Professor Quadri, his attraction to women other than his wife - he is ill-prepared to deal with them. Moravia also intimates a connection between sexual repression and fascism. See also * The Garden of the Finzi-Continis - another Italian novel and film about life during Mussolini's regime.

The series was written by Jim Starlin and penciled by Ron Lim, Ian Laughlin, Al Milgrom and Jack Morelli. It is a sequel to The Infinity Gauntlet and The Infinity War, both from the same creative team. The series depicts the battle between Earth's superheroes and Adam Warlock's good side. Publication history The main story alternated between The Infinity Crusade #1-6, Warlock and the Infinity Watch #18-22, and Warlock Chronicles #1-5.

All of these titles were published between June and November 1993. Plot summary When hero Adam Warlock takes possession of the artifact the Infinity Gauntlet, he expels the good and evil aspects of his being to become a totally logical being, who can therefore use the Gauntlet wisely. This act not only freed the incarnation of his evil aspects, Warlock's old foe the Magus, but also created an incarnation of his good aspects, the Goddess. During the events of the Infinity War, the Goddess steals the five cosmic containment units (also known as Cosmic Cubes) collected by the Magus. She eventually collects a total of thirty, and uses these to form a \\"Cosmic Egg\\" capable of fulfilling wishes. Using the Egg to create a planet called Paradise Omega, the Goddess kidnaps and brainwashes many of Earth's superheroes to act as her army. The heroes chosen are susceptible, as they are either especially religious, mystically inclined, or have had a near-death experience. The characters, led by the heroine Moondragon, are told to defend the Goddess while she meditates on how to rid the universe of all evil. Heroes Mister Fantastic, the android Vision, and Iron Man investigate the disappearance of their allies and find Paradise Omega. They retreat when attacked by the brainwashed heroes, and contact Professor X, leader of the X-Men, who attempts to speak with Moondragon via telepathy. This results in a telepathic attack that leaves Professor X in a coma. The Titan Thanos is seen as a threat by the Goddess, and is her first target to be attacked, but is inexplicably saved by his enemy Adam Warlock. The Devil, Mephisto, offers his knowledge of the Goddess to Thanos and Warlock in exchange for one of the cosmic containment units, to which they agree. Armed with Mephisto's information, Warlock and Thanos plan to defeat the Goddess. Thanos gathers the heroes of Earth and the Silver Surfer, who, while initially serving the Goddess, has shaken off her control. The Surfer destroys Paradise Omega's defences, enabling the heroes to land and battle their friends in what becomes a battle to the death. Thanos, boosting his own telepathic powers with those of the comatose Professor X, attacks the Goddess at the moment she activates her plan. Rationalizing that evil will continue to exist while sentient life exists, the Goddess uses the Egg to rewrite existence so that the universe is completely without sentient life. This, however, proves to be an illusion created by Warlock moments before the Goddess acted to trick her, thus exposing her true goal to her army and depriving her of their loyalty - and the will needed to override the containment unit's safeguards against universal destruction. Caught off-guard, the Goddess is attacked simultaneously by Thanos, Warlock, and Professor X, the three striking her on the spiritual plane as the units cannot affect the soul, and she is absorbed into the Soul Gem. The heroes return to Earth, with their battle undone by the Cosmic Egg, before Thanos ordered it to destroy itself, to ensure that its power could never be used by another. Thanos takes a cosmic containment unit for Mephisto and then destroys Paradise Omega. Mephisto receives his payment but realizes the unit is non-functional, as he failed to specify that the artifact must work.Infinity Crusade #1 - 6 (June - Nov. 1993) Collected editions The series and several tie-ins are collected into two trade paperbacks: *Volume 1 (collects The Infinity Crusade #1 - 3, Warlock Chronicles #1-3, and Warlock and the Infinity Watch #18-19, 248 pages, December 2008, ) *Volume 2 (collects The Infinity Crusade #4 - 6, Warlock Chronicles #4-5, and Warlock and the Infinity Watch #20-22, 248 pages, February 2009, ) References External links Comics by Jim Starlin Crossover comics ","title":"The Infinity Crusade"},{"id":"705680","text":"Infinity Abyss is a six-issue comic book limited series published by Marvel Comics from August to October in 2002.

Plot summary The series centers on the Thanosi, five failed genetic experiments by the Titan Thanos, with each being a clone of his DNA and modelled on other beings, including the characters Professor X; Doctor Strange; Gladiator; Iron Man and Galactus. Obsessed with nihilism and a desire to end the universe, the five Thanosi ‚Äì called X; Mystic; Warrior; Armor and Omega ‚Äì attempt to kill the original Thanos by creating a black hole in space.

He was also a magnate, a royal official (starosta), a castellan, a member of the Polish nobility (szlachta), and the voivode (governor) of Sandomierz from 1625 until his death. He led many successful military campaigns against rebelling Cossacks and invading Tatars. From 1618 he held the rank of Field Crown Hetman before becoming the Grand Crown Hetman, the military commander second only to the King, in 1632. Koniecpolski's life was one of almost constant warfare. Before he had reached the age of 20, he had fought in the Dymitriads and the Moldavian Magnate Wars. Later, in 1620, he took part in the Battle of Cecora, during which he was captured by Ottoman forces. After his release in 1623, he defeated the Ottomans' Tatar vassals several times between 1624 and 1626. With inferior numbers, during the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War (1626‚Äì29), Koniecpolski stopped the Swedish forces of Gustavus Adolphus from conquering Prussia and Pomerania before the war was concluded with the Truce of Altmark. In 1634, he defeated a major Turkish invasion at Kamianets-Podilskyi (Kamieniec Podolski), in modern Ukraine, while in 1644, his victory against the Tatars at the Battle of Ochmat√≥w brought him international fame and recognition. Youth The details of Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski's birth are unclear. Various dates between 1590 and 1594 have been provided, and none of his biographers identify where he was born. What is known, though, is that his father, Aleksander Koniecpolski, was a wealthy magnate belonging to the szlachta (Polish nobility) and was also the voviode of Sieradz, and a staunch supporter of King Sigismund III of the Swedish House of Vasa. Koniecpolski's mother, Anna Sroczycka, was the daughter of Stanis≈Çaw Sroczycki, the voivode of Kamianets-Podilskyi, and had brought several large Podole estates into the Koniecpolski family upon her marriage to Aleksander. Stanis≈Çaw's brothers were Krzysztof, who held the court office of chorƒÖ≈ºy wielki koronny (Grand Standard-Bearer of the Crown) and was voivode of Be≈Çsk from 1641; Remigiusz, who was the bishop of Che≈Çm before his death in 1640; Jan, a castellan and the voivode of Sieradz; and Przedb√≥r who died in 1611. Although Koniecpolski had a stutter, when he was 15, through his father's influence in the royal court, he secured an appointment as starosta (mayor) of Wielu≈Ñ. In 1603 he began studying at the Krak√≥w Academy, and after several years he was sent to the royal court by his father so that he could continue his education in a more practical fashion. He is believed to have stayed there a year or two. He may also have undertaken a tour of Western Europe for several months, spending the majority of his time in France before returning to his family's estates. Early career: 1610‚Äì1626 The Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth at its greatest extent, 1648 From a young age Koniecpolski chose to follow a military career. In 1610, together with his brother Przedb√≥r, he took part in the Dymitriads against Muscovy, raising a group of 300 men to join the Army of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth at Smolensk. On 4 July 1610 he participated in the Battle of Klushino before joining the Siege of Smolensk where Przedb√≥r was crushed to death by the fortress' collapsing walls on 8 July 1611. After returning to his family mansion at Koniecpol with his brother's body, the following autumn Koniecpolski rejoined the army. Under the command of Grand Lithuanian Hetman Jan Karol Chodkiewicz, he took part in the effort to relieve and supply the besieged Polish forces in the Moscow Kremlin. During that time, he was entrusted by the Hetman with command of the right flank of the Polish forces. In 1612 Koniecpolski joined the wojsko kwarciane (regular Commonwealth army) in Ukraine under the command of Field Crown Hetman Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski, who greatly influenced his career. In 1614 he was entrusted with destroying rebellious regular units led by Jan Karwacki, and on 17 May, with Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski's son, Jan, he won the Battle of Rohatyn and captured Karwacki. In 1615 he married ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski's daughter Katarzyna (Catherine). Soon after the wedding, he received the official rank of podstoli koronny (Crown Master of the Pantry). Throughout 1615 and 1616 Koniecpolski gained further experience in Ukraine, fighting the Tatar hordes, but failed to destroy or capture any sizable enemy units. In 1616, Katarzyna died while giving birth to Koniecpolski's first son, Andrzej. The following year, Koniecpolski took part in the Moldavian Magnate Wars alongside ≈ªo≈Çkiewski, and stood against Iskender Pasha's powerful Turkish army. The conflict ended that year with a negotiated cease-fire. Following negotiations with the Cossacks in Olszanica, Koniecpolski reduced the Cossack register to 1,000, thereby limiting the number of positions that the Cossacks could hold in the Commonwealth military. He also banned raids on the Black Sea. Such raids, which pillaged wealthy Ottoman cities, contributed to the Cossacks' income but provoked retaliatory raids into Commonwealth territory. Hussars‚ÄîPolish heavy cavalry‚Äîat K≈Çuszyn In 1618, during a session of the Sejm‚Äîthe Commonwealth parliament‚ÄîKing Sigismund III Vasa granted the bu≈Çawa (ceremonial mace or baton) of Grand Crown Hetman to Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski and that of Field Crown Hetman to Koniecpolski, disregarding the opposition of magnate Krzysztof Zbaraski and his allies. Soon afterward, Koniecpolski was defeated by the Tatars near Orynin, where he committed the mistake of pursuing the enemy against overwhelming odds and barely made it out of the battle alive. In 1619, Koniecpolski married Krystyna Lubomirska, who gave birth to a son, Aleksander, the following year. That year Koniecpolski and ≈ª√≥lkiewski led an army to Moldova to protect Gaspar Graziani, an ally of the Commonwealth. The army numbered over 7,000 and included the private regiments of the Korecki, Zas≈Çawski, Kazanowski, Kalinowski and Potocki magnates. During the Battle of Cecora (≈¢u≈£ora) Koniecpolski commanded the right flank of the Commonwealth forces, which were defeated on 19 September by a combined force belonging to Iskender Pasha and Kantymir (Khan Temir). After retreating in good order, the army's morale fell and while Koniecpolski prevented the army's disintegration on 20‚Äì21 September, during the later stages of the retreat its resolve collapsed and the men ran for the river. In the ensuing battle, ≈ª√≥lkiewski was killed and Koniecpolski and many magnates including Samuel Korecki, Miko≈Çaj Stru≈õ, Miko≈Çaj Potocki, and Jan and ≈Åukasz ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski were taken captive. The prisoners were transported to Bia≈Çograd (Bilhorod), to Iskender Pasha, then to the Castle of Seven Towers at Constantinople, where they were held in the Black Tower. Polish-Ottoman relations stabilized in the wake of the Ottoman defeat at Khotyn in 1621, and in the spring of 1623 the prisoners returned to Poland after a diplomatic mission by Krzysztof Zbaraski purchased their freedom for 30,000 thalers. Castle of the Seven Towers, Constantinople, where Koniecpolski was imprisoned In the aftermath of the Battle of Khotyn, a treaty had been signed that aimed to prevent further border hostilities. While Khan Canibek Giray resolved to respect the treaty's provisions, Kantymir continued to raid the borderlands in an effort to usurp Canibek Giray's position. Following fresh raids by Kantymir's forces in June 1623, Koniecpolski was given command of local Commonwealth forces and ordered to stop the incursions. Early the following year, the Budjak horde, under Kantymir's command, attacked southern Poland. On 6 February, Koniecpolski intercepted one of the Budjak armies and destroyed it near Szma≈Ñkowice and Oryszkowce. Later that year, after Kantymir's forces crossed the border in early June, Koniecpolski inflicted a further defeat on him at the Battle of Martyn√≥w. Using a new strategy that employed light Cossack cavalry to drive Kantymir's forces towards fortified tabors where they were attacked by small arms and artillery, Koniecpolski forced the khan's troops to retreat in disarray. His victory was soon celebrated throughout the Commonwealth and, as a reward, Koniecpolski was granted 30,000 z≈Çoty by the Sejm. He was also appointed voivode of Sandomierz. In 1625, during the Zhmailo Uprising the Zaporozhian Cossacks, led by Marek Zhmaylo, rebelled. Joining forces with Shahin Giray, they attempted to form an alliance with Moscow. Reasoning that the Tatars had their share of trouble with the Porte and that Kantymir's Budjak horde would be unable to send major assistance, Koniecpolski gathered a 12,000-strong army of regular and private units to deal with the rebellion. He pledged fair treatment to all Cossacks loyal to the Commonwealth, and death to rebels. On 25 October 1625, near Kry≈Ç√≥w, he launch a cavalry attack against the Cossacks. His initial thrusts were stopped and the Cossacks fell back toward Lake Kurukove where they checked a secondary attack. As the tide of battle went against him, Koniecpolski's position was at one point described as \\"grave\\"; however, the conflict eventually ended in a negotiated cease-fire. This was formalized by the Treaty of Kurukove on 6 November under which the Cossack register was set at 6,000, and the Cossacks again promised to stop raiding the Black Sea shores and provoking the Tatars. In late January 1626 the Tatars invaded again. With an army estimated at between 15,000 and 20,000, they raided and pillaged territories as far north as the Podole Voivodeship, passing Ternopil and Terebovlia, while some advanced units reached the cities of Lutsk, Volodymyr-Volynskyi and Lviv. In response, Koniecpolski gathered some 13,000 troops and moved to intercept the Tatars, but they refused to engage. Eventually Koniecpolski defeated the rear guard of the main Tatar army, which crossed the borders with much treasure and slaves. Later that year, fearing a repeat invasion, Koniecpolski violated a Sejm resolution in recruiting and fielding an army of 8,000 against an expected Tatar second wave. During this time, Koniecpolski was aided in a number of battles by a highly capable officer, Bohdan Khmelnytsky; Khmelnytsky would also score a major victory over the Tatars later that year, after Koniecpolski had departed north to a new battlefield near the Baltic Sea. Fighting Gustavus Adolphus: 1626‚Äì1629 Koniecpolski's great adversary, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden In 1626 the southern threat to the Commonwealth was overshadowed by a northern one, as an incursion by Swedish forces reignited the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War. In June, Gustavus Adolphus, with a fleet of 125 ships and an army of over 14,000 men, approached the Polish coast and began collecting tariffs on trade passing through Gda≈Ñsk (Danzig). Having taken Pi≈Çawa and Braniewo, Swedish forces spread through Pomerania, taking Frombork, Tolkmicko, ElblƒÖg, Malbork, Gniew, Tczew and Starogard, while other Swedish forces landed near Puck‚Äîthe main port of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth fleet‚Äîand captured it. The major city of Gda≈Ñsk, however, refused to surrender even in the face of lightning Swedish advances. In a battle that took place between 22 and 30 September 1626 near the village of Gniew, Gustavus defeated a Polish army led by King Sigismund, who retreated and called for reinforcements from other parts of the country. In response, Koniecpolski was tasked with defending Royal Prussia against the Swedish incursion. He was delayed by the unstable situation in the south, though, and it was not until 1 October that he finally departed for Prussia. Koniecpolski's force of 4,200 light cavalry, 1,000 dragoons, and 1,000 infantry quickly moved to Prussia. Reinforced by other units, he had 9,000 men against the 20,000-strong Swedish force. Employing maneuver warfare, using small mobile units to strike at enemy communication lines and smaller units, he stopped the Swedish attack and forced Axel Oxenstierna into a defensive posture. Meanwhile, the Sejm agreed to raise money for the war. The situation of the Commonwealth forces, short of money and food, was difficult. Lithuanian forces were dealt a serious defeat near Koknese, Inflanty Voivodeship, in December 1626 and they subsequently retreated behind the Dvina River. The Swedes then planned to strike Koniecpolski from two directions: Oxenstierna, from the Vistula River, and Johann Streiff von Lawentstein and Maxymilian Teuffl, from Swedish-held Pomorze. The flooding of the Vistula, however, disrupted their plans and allowed Koniecpolski to intercept the enemy units advancing from Pomerania. On 2 April 1627 Koniecpolski managed to recapture Puck. He took Czarne (Hamersztyn) on 18 April and forced the Swedish forces to retreat into the city. A week later they surrendered, with many mercenaries and some Swedish abandoning their banners and insignia, and changing sides. As a result of the series of Swedish defeats in spring 1627, they lost all their strongholds on the west bank of the Vistula, and with those, their hopes for a quick and decisive victory. The situation also convinced the Elector of Brandenburg to declare his support for the Commonwealth, and afterwards the Lithuanian forces resumed their offensive in Livonia. Koniecpolski with a hetman's bu≈Çawa, portraited in a military encampment against a battle, National Museum in Warsaw On 17 May Gustavus landed with 8,000 reinforcements. On the night of 22‚Äì23 May, while crossing the Vistula near Kie≈ºmark and Danzig, Gustavus encountered Polish forces. Wounded in the hip, he was forced to retreat. Koniecpolski then decided to take back Gniew and devised a diversionary plan. Polish forces were sent to attempt to take back Braniewo, forcing Gustavus to relieve the siege; then Gustavus followed the retreating Polish army and laid siege to Orneta. Koniecpolski, who had foreseen this, responded with a sudden attack on Gniew, his primary objective, which he captured. Gustavus was reported to be impressed with the speed of Koniecpolski's reaction. Near Tczew, with about 7,800 men‚Äîincluding 2,500 cavalry and hussars, the Commonwealth's elite heavy cavalry‚ÄîKoniecpolski tried to stop the Swedish army from reaching Danzig. On 7‚Äì8 August, he encountered a Swedish force consisting of 10,000 men, which included 5,000 infantry, near the swamps of Mot≈Çawa. The Swedes wanted to provoke the Poles into attacking, then destroy them with infantry fire and artillery, but Koniecpolski decided against attacking. The Swedes then went on the attack with cavalry, but were unable to draw the Poles within range of their fire. The Swedish attacks dealt severe damage to the Polish cavalry but did not cripple the Polish army whose morale was kept high by Koniecpolski. The battle ended when Gustavus Adolphus was again wounded and the Swedes retreated. Koniecpolski now recognized the need to reform his army and strengthen the firepower of its infantry and artillery to match the Swedes'. The Swedes, on the other hand, had learned the arts of cavalry charges and mel√©e combat from the Poles. Overall the 1627 campaign had been favorable to the Commonwealth; Puck and Gniew had been retaken, Swedish plans had been thwarted, and the Swedish army had been weakened. The last major engagement of the year saw the surprising defeat of a Swedish flotilla by the small Polish Navy on 28 November 1627 at the Battle of Oliwa. In 1628 the Polish forces, short of funds, were forced to cease their offensive and go on the defensive. Gustavus Adolphus captured Kwidzy≈Ñ, Nowe and Brodnica. Koniecpolski counterattacked, putting his small forces to most efficient use‚Äîquick cavalry mel√©e attacks, combined with supporting infantry and artillery fire, guerrilla warfare, the use of engineers to raise fortifications, and clever use of terrain advantage. Despite his best efforts, he was hampered by insufficient funds. The Sejm increased funding for the war after the Battle of G√≥rzno, where Stanis≈Çaw \\"Rewera\\" Potocki was defeated. Austria sent the Commonwealth help in the form of forces under Field Marshal Johann Georg Arnheim. Arnheim, however, refused to take orders from Koniecpolski. Hetman Koniecpolski Frees Captives of the Tatars, by Henryk Rodakowski. (The original was lost in World War II.) The final battle took place on 27 June 1629 near Trzciana (or Trzcianka). The Swedes attacked toward GrudziƒÖdz, were halted, and retreated to Sztum and Malbork. Koniecpolski attacked the rear guard, which was led by Jan Wilhelm Reingraff, Count of Ren, and destroyed it. He also repelled a counterattack by Swedish raitars, who were pushed toward Pu≈Çkowice, where another counterattack was led by Gustavus Adolphus with 2,000 raitars. This counterattack was also fended off, and the Swedish forces were saved from total defeat by the last Swedish reserves, led by Field Marshal Herman Wrangel, who blocked the Polish attack. Gustavus Adolphus was wounded and barely escaped. Of the Swedes, 1,200 were killed, and Reingraff and several hundred others were captured. Polish losses were under 200 killed or injured. Poland did not follow up this victory politically or militarily. A cease-fire contracted at Stary Targ (the Truce of Altmark) on 26 October 1629 favored the Swedes, who received the right to tax Polish trade moving over the Baltic (3.5% of the value of goods), retained control of many cities in Royal Prussia, and were recognized as the dominant power on the southern Baltic coast. Koniecpolski exerted little influence on the negotiations, as he had been called back to Ukraine to crush a Tartar incursion. Grand Crown Hetman: 1630‚Äì1637 Treaty of Sztumska Wie≈õ (1635), painted 1640. Pictured are Bishop Jakub Zadzik, King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV, and Hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski. In 1630, the Cossack leader, Taras Fedorovych, executed the moderate Hryhoriy Chorny, and began a Cossack uprising, later dubbed the \\"Fedorovych Uprising\\". Soon afterwards he captured the fortress of Korsun. In an effort to restore the situation, Koniecpolski laid siege to Pereyaslav. Lacking artillery and infantry support, he could not breach its walls, but the Cossacks, needing supplies and having suffered heavy casualties, agreed to negotiate. The Treaty of Pereyaslav, signed in August 1630, it resuluted in. It granted liberal terms, including amnesty for the rebels. Koniecpolski, as usual, was for harsh punishment, but also argued that in the long run the Cossack situation was better remedied by more equitable treatment, including an increase in the Cossack register and the regular payment of wages. Still, he supported policies aimed at turning the Cossacks into serfs, which was one of the main causes of unrest in Ukraine; this, along with his decision to settle his soldiers' living expenses on the local populace instead of paying them wages, led to his extreme unpopularity in Ukraine. In 1632, a few months before his death, King Sigismund III Vasa awarded Koniecpolski the post of Grand Crown Hetman. It had stood vacant for 12 years, since the death of Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski; presumably King Sigismund had feared that Koniecpolski, if given the post earlier, would have become too powerful a magnate. After the King's death, Koniecpolski played a major role in directing the political affairs of the Commonwealth and in 1632 supported the election of Sigismund's son, W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV Vasa, as king. In return, a year after his election, King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV rewarded Koniecpolski with the office of Castellan of Krak√≥w, the most prestigious of the Commonwealth's district offices. Koniecpolski became an influential adviser to the new king, often encouraging him to direct Polish foreign policy against the Tartars. Koniecpolski also supported King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV's military reforms. Though generally seen as a supporter of the King, Koniecpolski opposed some of his plans aimed at increasing royal power in the Commonwealth and weakening the Golden Liberty of the nobility. Fortress of Kamianets-Podilskyi In 1633 Koniecpolski thwarted the Turks' attacks on the Commonwealth, defeating their forces on 4 July at Sasowy R√≥g. On 22 October that year, he repulsed a superior invading Ottoman force of over 20,000 at Kamianets-Podilskyi, his own forces numbering a mere 11,000. The Ottoman defeats and Koniecpolski's attitude persuaded the Turks to sign a new treaty on 19 August 1634. The treaty repeated the terms of the Treaty of Chocim of 1621 and ended the Ottoman‚ÄìCommonwealth War (1633‚Äì34). In 1635, in the short lived Sulima Uprising, after Cossacks under Ivan Sulyma captured and destroyed the Polish Kodak Fortress (near modern Dnipro), Koniecpolski led an expedition that retook the fort and punished the insurgents. Sulima was taken prisoner and executed. Later that year Koniecpolski returned to Pomerania to prepare for another war against Sweden, but it was rendered unnecessary by the Treaty of Sztumska Wie≈õ. Koniecpolski grasped the need to modernize the Commonwealth's military and worked with King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV to that end, including the recruitment of mercenaries experienced in western warfare, and further development of artillery (he supervised the construction of arsenals at Kudak, Bar and Kamieniec Podolski, and built forges on his Ukrainian estates). He was patron to many gifted artillery and engineering officers. He may also have sponsored cartographers such as William le Vasseur de Beauplan, who mapped Ukraine, and Sebastian Aders, who mapped Crimea. He also supported plans to create a Commonwealth Baltic Fleet. Last years: 1637‚Äì1645 Koniecpolski's effigy, Trinity Church, Koniecpol After 1637 Koniecpolski's declining health made him reliant on the younger Hetman Miko≈Çaj Potocki, who successfully crushed Cossack uprisings in 1637 and 1638, and a Tartar uprising in 1639. Koniecpolski's influence also protected the outlaw Samuel ≈Åaszcz, whom he saw as another able commander. One of Koniecpolski's greatest victories occurred during a winter 1644 campaign against Tatars. With a large army of some 19,000 soldiers (60% of them, magnates' private armies; Koniecpolski's own forces numbered 2,200) he dealt a crushing defeat to Toƒüay bey's forces near Ochmat√≥w on 30 January 1644. Many Tatars drowned near Sina Woda when the ice over the water gave way. The Battle of Ochmat√≥w, the Commonwealth's greatest victory over the Tatars in the first half of the 17th century, brought international fame to Koniecpolski, who had not only predicted the time and place of their attack but had destroyed their forces before they could deploy their usual tactic of splitting their main forces into multiple highly-mobile units (czambuls). The victory led King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV to consider an offensive war against the Turks. Koniecpolski supported a limited war against the Crimean Khanate but opposed the King's plan to wage war on the entire Ottoman Empire, believing it to be an unrealistic folly. Setting out his strategic views in a plan titled \\"Dyskurs o zniesieniu Tatarow krymskich i lidze z MoskwƒÖ\\" (Discourse on Destruction of the Crimean Tartars and on coalition with Moscow), Koniecpolski also strongly urged a coalition with Moscow for such a campaign. King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV continued to push for a crusade against Turkey, but it had little internal support and failed to achieve anything except to spread false hopes among the Cossacks, to whom he promised privileges and money in exchange for their participation. On 15 June 1645, Koniecpolski's wife, Krystyna, died. Koniecpolski remarried soon after, taking the hand of 16-year-old Zofia Opali≈Ñska, daughter of future Crown Marshal ≈Åukasz Opali≈Ñski, on 16 January 1646. The marriage was short lived, though, ending with Koniecpolski's death in Brody on 11 March 1646. Sources suggest that his new marriage was the cause of his death; Joachim Jerlicz wrote in his diary that Koniecpolski had overdosed on an aphrodisiac. His funeral was held in Brody on 30 April 1646. Wealth and influence Pidhirtsi Castle, built by Wilhelm Beauplan for Koniecpolski, 1635‚Äì40 Over the course of his life, Koniecpolski accumulated much wealth. Most of his possessions were in Ukraine, and he became Ukraine's unofficial ruler; some foreigners referred to him as \\"viceroy of Ukraine\\", though no such Commonwealth position ever existed. King W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV trusted him with most political decisions concerning this southeastern region of the Commonwealth. With the knowledge and support of the King, Koniecpolski sent and received diplomatic missions from Constantinople, carried out negotiations and signed treaties, and as the Grand Crown Hetman he directly controlled a substantial part of the Commonwealth's military. He had his own private army and an espionage network that stretched from Moscow to the Ottoman Empire. Koniecpolski inherited some seven or eight villages from his father. At his death, he owned 12 starostwo districts, with over 300 settlements, including dozens of towns, giving him yearly revenues of over 500,000 z≈Çoty. His holdings of land and serfs in western Ukraine were considerable; he owned 18,548 households in Bratslav. Koniecpolski invested much of his wealth in developing his Ukrainian estates, and supported settlement of underpopulated regions. He founded and sponsored the development of many towns and cities, including the town of Brody, which flourished with his investments, and became an important local commercial center. Koniecpolski fortified the town with a citadel and bastions in 1633 and set up workshops for producing Persian-type samite fabrics, carpets and rugs. He also constructed a fortified palace in Pidhirtsi (Podhorce) with beautiful Italian gardens. Like most magnates, Koniecpolski was a patron of the arts, sponsoring painters, sculptors, writers. He also founded many churches and sought to upgrade Brody's school to an academy. He sponsored the construction of the Koniecpolski Palace (now the Presidential Palace) in Warsaw, and military fortifications in Bar and Kudak. Regarded as a courteous and educated man, Koniecpolski participated in all the Sejm sessions that he could, though he rarely spoke publicly due to his stutter. He was widely respected and highly popular among his szlachta peers. See also *History of Poland (1569‚Äì1795) Notes a. The year of Koniecpolski's birth is not certain and several different dates are provided by historians. The earliest date mentioned is 1590, while 1594 is the latest. Leszek Podhorodecki, in his biography Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski ok. 1592‚Äì1646, states that 1591 is the date that is most commonly given by historians, noting that Encyclop√¶dia Britannica provides this date. Nevertheless, Podhorodecki chose to mark Koniecpolski's date of birth as circa 1592, based on the diary of Karol Ogier, a French courtier, who noted that in 1635 Koniecpolski was 43 years old. The date of 1593 or 1594 has also been proposed in historian W≈Çadys≈Çaw Czapli≈Ñski's Polski S≈Çownik Biograficzny. In discussing this possibility, Podhorodecki recognizes Czapli≈Ñski as \\"a great specialist of that era\\", while noting, though, that his work fails to justify this date. b. Podhorodecki gives slightly different estimates‚Äîjust over 15,000 (including low-quality Gda≈Ñsk infantry) against 21,000.

Such was the projected performance of the engine compared to contemporary designs that many developments of wartime Luftwaffe piston-engined aircraft designs were based on it, at least as an option. These included the entire Bomber B program, which looked to replace all existing Luftwaffe bombers with a new twin-engine design that was larger, faster and more heavily armed than any aircraft in their inventory. The design failed to mature even after years of intensive development and several major design changes. The Bomber B program failed along with it, leaving the Luftwaffe with hopelessly outdated designs during the second half of the war. Only a small number of 222s were built, less than 300. They never left the prototype phase, but the design nevertheless continued appearing on proposals for new Luftwaffe multi-engined designs long after most had given up hope it would ever work. Design and development Design work on the Jumo 222 started in 1937. The engine was configured with six inline cylinder banks spaced at equal angles around the crankcase, each bank having four cylinders. The engine looked like a radial due to the arrangement ‚Äî this was evident from a cross-sectional drawing of the original version, using a master connecting rod with five additional connecting rods pivoted from the master rod's crankpin end casting, as with a single-row radial. But the internal workings were designed to operate more like a V engine with each adjacent pair of cylinder banks, each with a crossflow head, and it was liquid-cooled like most inlines. Looking at a complete Jumo 222 from a \\"nose-on\\" view, the half-dozen cylinder banks were arranged at 60¬∞ equal angles from each other, such that neighbouring banks had their exhaust ports (at the \\"60¬∞, 180¬∞ & 300¬∞\\" spaces) and intake ports (at the \\"0¬∞, 120¬∞ & 240¬∞\\" spaces) facing each other, resulting in simpler \\"plumbing\\" from the rear-mounted supercharger and resulting in only three sets of exhaust headers. The trio of exhaust header sets would have been most likely present at the bottom of an engine nacelle, and on the upper quarters to either side (appearing like the exhausts for many Allied \\"upright\\" V-style aviation engines) for the shortest possible exhaust outlet routing. The four-cylinder-long multibank design resulted in a shorter engine than the Jumo 211, by roughly 80 cm/31 in,Comparison of Ju 88A and Ju 288 with Jumo 211 and 222 engines but larger cross-section nacelle design. Like the Ju 88, it could use an annular radiator to cool the 222's cylinders and motor oil. The Junkers Ju 288 intended to hide the radiators behind hollow ducted spinners with each of its four-blade propellers. Each cylinder had two intake valves and a single sodium-cooled exhaust valve ‚Äî a triple-valve configuration inherited from the first Jumo-series inverted V12 aviation engine, the Junkers Jumo 210 ‚Äî a high-pressure fuel injector between the intakes, and two spark plugs. With a bore and stroke of 135 mm (5.3 in), the original Jumo 222A/B engine design had a displacement of 46.4 L (2,831.5 in¬≥), in the same general displacement class as the Double Wasp American eighteen cylinder air-cooled radial of 1937‚Äì1940 origin. The 222A/B model was forced to run at a fairly low 6.5:1 compression ratio, the same ratio as used by the volume-produced Jumo 211C inverted-V12 from their firm. Such comparatively low compression ratios were the best possible ones given the low-octane fuels available in Germany, but by increasing the speed of the engine to 3,200 rpm, the 222 delivered 1,850 kW (2,500 hp) at takeoff. The only disappointing feature was the simple, single-stage two-speed supercharger, but even with this limitation, the engine still generated 1,641 kW (2,200 hp) at 5,000 m (16,400 ft). The dry weight was 1,088 kg (2,399 lb), only some 17 kg (39 lb) heavier than the air-cooled Double Wasp. Compared with the contemporary BMW 801 and Daimler-Benz DB 605, the 222 was a huge leap in performance. It had only slightly larger displacement than the 801's 41.8 L (2,550.8 in¬≥), and about 25% more than the 605's 35.7 L (2,178.5 in¬≥), but delivered considerably more power, 1,850 kW (2,500 hp) compared to 1,193 kW (1,600 hp) in the 801 and 1,119 kW (1,500 hp) in the 605. That represents 40 kW/L for the 222, while only 29 kW/L for the 801, and 31 kW/L for the 605. The power-to-weight ratio was 1.7 kW/kg (1.04 hp/lb) for the 222, whereas the 605 delivered 1.4 kW/kg (0.88 hp/lb), and the 801 1 kW/kg (0.60 hp/lb). The 222 also had similar exterior dimensions as these smaller engines, 1.16 m (3.81 ft) across compared to 1.27 m (4.17 ft) for the 801, and 2.4 m (7.9 ft) long compared to 2.3 m (7.5 ft) for the 605. A DB 610 \\"power system\\" for comparison with the Jumo 222 The comparison was even more favourable against other high-power engines under development. The cumbersome DB 606, the first-ever \\"high-output\\" powerplant developed in Germany, consisted of two DB 601's mounted to a single reduction gear case on their front ends, that delivered 1,790 kW (2,400 hp) with a weight of 1,515 kg (3,340 lb), and was 2.1 x 1.6 x 1.1 m (6.9 x 5.2 x 3.6 ft) in size. Their troubled use and deficient installation design in the He 177A, Germany's only heavy bomber aircraft to see production and front-line service, prompted Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring to derisively label them in the late summer of 1942 as \\"welded-together engines\\". Conversely, the RLM was excited by the possibilities of the much more compact Jumo 222's design features, and the X engine configuration, 24 cylinder DB 604, of similar weight and displacement to the 222A but with somewhat lower specific power output. The RLM based their entire Bomber B program on pairs of these engines, which would deliver a bomber with the warload of the He 177 and even better speed than the Ju 88, a truly universal design. A Junkers Ju 288 prototype powered by Jumo 222 engines, with ducted spinners and counter-rotating propellers. The first prototype engine ran on 24 April 1939, and was later air-tested on the nose- engine mount of a Ju 52. Production called for two primary models, the 222A and 222B, which differed only in the direction that they spun, intended to be used for left-hand (portside wing) and right-hand (starboard wing) engines on twin-engine designs. However, continued testing went poorly, and Junkers eventually decided it was best to stop development of these \\"Series I\\" engines and move onto a modified \\"Series II\\". The new 222A-2 and B-2 ran at a slightly slower rpm but had slightly larger cylinders of 140 mm/5.5 in bore (49.88 litres, 3043.86 in¬≥) for the same net performance, while the A-3 and B-3 used a different supercharger for better performance at higher altitudes. One A-3 and B-3 powerplant each were allegedly fitted to the ninth Junkers Ju 288 prototype airframe for flight tests. Both \\"uprated\\" models of the Jumo 222A/B versions continued to prove unreliable, and were fitted only experimentally. By late 1941, Junkers decided the best course of action was to make more radical changes to the design, and introduced the 222C and 222D models. With a new bore and stroke of 145x140 mm (5.7x5.5 in), the engine displacement increased a second time, to 55.5 L (3,386.8 in¬≥), just very slightly larger than the contemporary Wright Duplex Cyclone American 18-cylinder air-cooled radial engine, which at the time was having its own significant problems ironed out, partially from the use of combustible magnesium-alloy metal for its crankcase. Back at the original 3,200 rpm, the Jumo 222 C/D models could deliver just under 2,200 kW (3,000 hp) when they started running in the summer of 1942. However, the problems were not cured, and only a handful were built. The RLM had been waiting for three years at this point, and eventually gave up and had all designs based on it look for alternate engines. Later that year, they gave up on that as well, and cancelled the entire Bomber B program outright. Jumo 222 E built in 1944 Junkers still did not give up. Using the original 46.4 litre displacement A/B design, they added a new two-stage supercharger including a trio of aftercoolers, one per pair of neighboring cylinder banks for high-altitude use, producing the 222E and F-series. Although sea-level performance was unchanged, the engine was able to produce 1,439 kW (1,930 hp) at 9,000 m (29,530 ft). By this point it appeared that the problems were finally being worked out, but bombing of the Junkers Motorenwerke's headquarters factories in Dessau made production almost impossible. A final attempt for even higher altitude performance resulted in the turbocharged 222G and H, built only to the extent of a few testbed prototypes. The Jumo 222 was a massive and very costly failure. 289 examples of the Jumo 222's were built in total, none of which saw active service. It also served to seriously hamper Luftwaffe piston-engined designs from 1940 to 1942, while many personnel within the Luftwaffe's government-operated technology development offices (like Oberst Edgar Petersen's chain of several Erprobungsstelle installations) and German military aviation corporate engineering departments waited for the Jumo 222 to finally start working. Meanwhile, all calls for four-engine adaptations in place of twin-engine Jumo 222 powered designs were rejected because it was felt it would place too much strain on the German engine industry. In the end there was nothing to show for it, and late in the war the Luftwaffe was flying barely updated versions of their original pre-war designs.

The crankshaft, however, always ran uniformly to the right; the propeller running direction was varied only by different gears. Since the Junkers Jumo 222 has six cylinder banks, it is one of the so-called Hexagon engines. Other examples of hexagon engines are rare - for example, the 24-cylinder water-cooled Dobrynin VD-4K and the 12-cylinder air-cooled Curtiss H-1640 Chieftain. Analogously, there were also octagon engines such as the Bristol Hydra with eight cylinder banks.

Formally, the main roles of the PIDE were the border, immigration and emigration control and internal and external State security. Over time, it came to be known for its secret police activities. The agency that would later become the PIDE was established by the Decree-Law 22992 of August 1933, as the Surveillance and State Defense Police or PVDE. It resulted from the merger of two former agencies, the Portuguese International Police and the Political and Social Defense Police. PVDE was founded by Captain Agostinho Louren√ßo, who in 1956 would become the President of Interpol. The PVDE was transformed into the PIDE in 1945. PIDE was itself transformed into the Directorate-General of Security or DGS in 1968. After the 25 April 1974 Carnation Revolution, DGS was disbanded in Portugal, but continued to exist transitionally in the Portuguese overseas territories as the Military Information Police or PIM, being finally completely disbanded in 1975. Although the acronym PIDE was only formally used from 1945 to 1969, the set of successive secret polices that existed during the 40 years of the Estado Novo regime are commonly referred to as the PIDE. Historically, this set of police agencies is also often referred as PIDE/DGS, from the acronyms of its two last designations. It is referred to in this last way in article 293 of the Portuguese Constitution, which states its criminalization and judgment of its former officers. During its existence, the organization was known for its actions during the Spanish Civil War, its role as a political police, its counter-espionage activities during World War II and its counter-insurgency operations in the Portuguese Colonial War.25 de Abril Always, worldwithouttorture.org, retrieved 21 September 2015Portugal Intelligence Services, photius.com, retrieved 21 September 2015 History Background During the Portuguese First Republic and the following Ditadura Nacional regimes, the police services were reorganized several times, with the remote ancestors of PIDE appearing. In 1918, the police services were organized as an umbrella organization named Civic Police, which started to include two agencies that were the remote ancestors of the PIDE: the Preventive Police and the Emigration Police. The first agency was a secret police responsible for the State security. The Preventive Police would become the State Security Police in 1919, the Social Defense Police in April 1919, and the Preventive and State Security Police in October 1919. The Emigration Police was an agency responsible for the border and migration control, with a special focus in the fight against illegal emigration. After the 28 May 1926 coup d'√©tat and the establishment of the military Ditadura Nacional, the Preventive and State Security Police was disbanded. However, soon after, two similar agencies were created, the Lisbon Information Police and the Porto Information Police, respectively under the control of the civil governor of Lisbon and the civil governor of Porto. In 1928, the two agencies were merged into a single Information Police under the direct control of the Minister of the Interior. In the same year, the Portuguese International Police was created as a section of the Information Police, succeeding the former Emigration Police. In 1931, the Information Police was disbanded and the Portuguese International Police became autonomous, under the direct control of the Minister of the Interior. In 1932, the Political and Social Surveillance Section of the Portuguese International Police was created, with the same role of the former Information Police. With Salazar in office as prime minister, the Political and Social Surveillance Section became autonomous in January 1933, as the Political and Social Surveillance Police. The Portuguese International Police and the Political and Social Surveillance Police would merge in August 1933, as the PVDE. PVDE The origins of PIDE can be traced to 1933, the year of the inauguration of the Estado Novo. Under direct orders from Salazar himself, the Surveillance and State Defence (Pol√≠cia de Vigil√¢ncia e de Defesa do Estado) or PVDE was created, with two main sections: *Social and Political Defence Section, which was used to prevent and repress crimes of a political and social nature (see: Censorship) *International Section, which was used to control the entrance of immigrants, to expel undesirable immigrants and to take care of counter-espionage and/or international espionage. PVDE was founded and led by Captain Agostinho Louren√ßo. According to Professor Douglas Wheeler \\"an analysis of Lourenco's career suggest[s] strongly that British Intelligence Services' influence had an impact on the structure and activity of PVDE\\". Louren√ßo had earned a reputation with British observers, recorded in a confidential document generated at the British Embassy, which suggested a \\"pro-British\\" bias on his part. Louren√ßo always kept a good relationship with the MI6, which helped him to become the head of the international police organization Interpol in 1956. In 1936, the prison of Tarrafal was created in the Portuguese colony of Cape Verde. This camp, under the direct control of the PVDE, was the destination for those political prisoners considered dangerous by the regime. Among the first prisoners were the convicted sailors from the 1936 Naval Revolt. The sailors, affiliated with the Communist Party, had attempted to sail two Portuguese Navy ships out of Lisbon to join the Spanish Republican forces fighting in Spain. Throughout the more than 40 years of the Estado Novo, 32 people lost their lives in Tarrafal, which was known for its severe methods of torture. Also in 1936, with the beginning of the Spanish Civil War and in 1937 with the attempt against Salazar's life by anarchist terrorists, the PVDE started focusing its battle against communism and the underground Portuguese Communist Party. During this pre-World War II period, several Italian and German advisers came to Portugal to help the PVDE adopt a model similar to the Gestapo. During World War II, the PVDE experienced its most intense period of activity. Neutral Lisbon was the European center of espionage and one of the favourite exile destinations. Writers such as Ian Fleming (the creator of James Bond) were based there, while other prominent people such as the Duke of Windsor and the Spanish Royal Family were exiled in Estoril. German spies attempted to buy information on trans-Atlantic shipping to help their submarines fight the Battle of the Atlantic. The Spaniard Juan Pujol Garcia, better known as Codename Garbo, passed on misinformation to the Germans, hoping it would hasten the end of the Spanish State‚Äîhe was recruited by Britain as a double agent while in Lisbon. Conversely, William Colepaugh, an American traitor, was recruited as an agent by the Germans while his ship was in port in Lisbon‚Äîhe was subsequently landed by U-boat, , in Maine before being captured. In June 1943, a commercial airliner carrying the actor Leslie Howard was shot down over the Bay of Biscay by the Luftwaffe after taking off from Lisbon, possibly because German spies in Lisbon believed that Prime Minister Winston Churchill was on board. Several American reports called Lisbon \\"The Capital of Espionage\\". However, the PVDE always maintained a neutral stance towards foreign espionage activity, as long as no one intervened in Portuguese internal policies. PIDE Vila Algarve in November 2011, the former headquarters of PIDE in Mozambique, at Louren√ßo Marques (presently Maputo). In 1945, the PVDE was dissolved and replaced by the PIDE. Unlike its predecessor, which sought inspiration in the Gestapo, PIDE followed the Scotland Yard model. Receiving the same status as the Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria (criminal investigation police), it had full powers to investigate, detain, and arrest anyone who was thought to be plotting against the State. It had two main functions: *Administrative functions (which included those related to the migration services) *Criminal prevention and repression functions PIDE is considered by many authors as being one of the most functional and effective secret services in history. Using a wide network of covert cells, which were spread throughout Portugal and its overseas territories, PIDE had infiltrated agents into almost every underground movement, including the Portuguese Communist Party as well as the independence movements in Angola and Mozambique. The PIDE encouraged citizens - the so- called bufos (snitches) - to denounce suspicious activities, through the use of monetary and prestige incentives. This resulted in an extremely effective espionage service which was able to fully control almost every aspect of Portuguese daily life. The PIDE intensified its actions during the Portuguese Colonial War, creating a successful paramilitary unit called Flechas (Arrows). Yves Gu√©rin-S√©rac, a former officer of the French Army and founder of the OAS right-wing terrorist group during the Algerian War of Independence (1954‚Äì62), set up \\"Aginter Press\\" in Lisbon and participated with the PIDE in covert operations. DGS In 1969, Marcelo Caetano changed the name PIDE to DGS (Direc√ß√£o-Geral de Seguran√ßa, \\"General Security Directorate\\"). The death of Salazar and the subsequent ascension of Caetano brought some attempts at democratization, in order to avoid popular insurgency against censorship, the ongoing colonial war, and the general restriction of civil rights. This resulted in a decrease in the perceived level of violence used by the secret police and a consequent reduction in its effectiveness. End of PIDE/DGS The most dramatic moments of the 1974 Carnation Revolution occurred near the DGS headquarters at Ant√≥nio Maria Cardoso Street in Lisbon. Unidentified agents - desperate after being surrounded by rebellious troops and a throng of civilians - opened fire from the top of the building, killing four demonstrators. In turn, a DGS agent was also killed by the rebellious troops when trying to escape. These five people were the sole victims of the coup d'√©tat which brought down the dictatorship. This was the last strategic point to be occupied by the insurgents, thus leading to the escape of many of the agents and the destruction of most of the records. In the days following the revolution, most escaped to Spain or went underground. Many of the agents, including the director-general Silva Pais were, however, captured. Of those agents, 89 would latter escape from the Alcoentre penitentiary, in a massive and never well-explained prison break in June 1975. Some of the PIDE/DGS archives were reportedly handed over by the Portuguese Communist Party to Soviet agents. After being sanitized, the corporation continued its operations in the Portuguese colonies under the name of the Military Information Police (Pol√≠cia de Informa√ß√£o Militar). A commission was created for the extinction of the secret police. The remainder of the documents since 1990 are in the Torre do Tombo National Archive. They can be accessed, but the names of agents and informers are not disclosed. The only PIDE agents who faced trial were those responsible for the death of exiled opposition leader Humberto Delgado. They were tried in absentia and the case dragged on for several years. None of them served time in jail. The brutality of the PIDE/DGS is dramatised in the 2000 film April Captains, about the events of the day of the Carnation Revolution. Because of the memory of the abuses of the PIDE/DGS in supporting the regime, the establishment of a new civilian intelligence agency was delayed for more than a decade. However, following a terrorist attack on the Embassy of Turkey, the assassination of a Palestine Liberation Organization representative at a Socialist International conference in 1983, and a number of domestic terrorist attacks by isolated far-left and far-right groups, the Portuguese government became convinced of the need for a new intelligence agency. This led to the establishment of the Sistema de Informa√ß√µes da Rep√∫blica Portuguesa (SIRP, Intelligence System of the Portuguese Republic) in 1984.

Biography Salut au Monde (1936) was an original dance drama by Helen Tamiris for the Federal Dance Theatre, a division of the Federal Theatre Project Tamiris was born in New York City on April 23, 1902. She was a choreographer known for American themed works. Tamiris originally trained in ballet and musical theater/comedy. She spent time studying free movement at the Henry Street Settlement. She danced for three seasons with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet and the Bracale Opera Company before studying briefly with Michel Fokine and with a disciple of Isadora Duncan. In 1927, she made her premiere as a solo modern dancer and two years later formed her own school and company. Not only was she concerned with establishing modern dance as a viable art form, she also wanted to bring dance to a wider audience. Tamiris was married to modern dancer and choreographer Daniel Nagrin who wrote the book How to Dance Forever: Surviving Against the Odds. Tamiris and Nagrin directed the Tamiris-Nagrin Dance Company. Much of her known works deal with social issues like racism and war. She is best known for her suite of dances called Negro Spirituals which was created between 1928 and 1942. She choreographed eight Negro Spirituals, which were performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in April, 1939 with six other short dances, in a program shared with Hanya Holm. These Negro Spirituals protested against prejudice and discrimination against African American in America. How Long Brethren? (1937) was danced to Negro protest songs. This was a production of the Federal Dance Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) that explored the problems facing African-Americans (which was the first time that federal funds were utilized in a creation of American dance). Other dancers and choreographers who took part in the Federal Dance Project was Katherine Dunham, Doris Humphrey, Ruth Page, and Charles Weidman. How Long Brethren? won Dance Magazine's first award for group choreography. Tamiris was active in organizing the young artists through the Concert Dancers League, Dance Repertory Theatre, with contributions from Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey, and Charles Weidman, Dancers Emergency Association, and American Dance Association. She also played an integral role in establishing the Federal Dance Project under the WPA. Later, she became the director of the Federal Theatre Project under WPA. During the Depression she assisted many dancers with finding work and career opportunities. Helen Tamiris was Jewish and she choreographed some pieces with themes that reflected her heritage in this regard, such as Memoir (1959) and Women's Song (1960). Tamiris was also known for her contribution to musical theatre. During a period when jobs opportunities for dancers started to decrease, a number of ballet and modern dance choreographers, including Tamiris, began to work in musical theatre, musical comedies, and films. Tamiris was among the choreographers who won awards for their musical theatre choreography. Tamiris won an Antoinette Perry Award (Tony) for best choreography in Touch and Go (1949). Her other musical theatre choreography includes Adelante (1939), Annie Get Your Gun (1946), Up in Central Park (1947), Flahooley (1951), Carnival in Flanders (1953), Fanny (1954), and Plain and Fancy (1955). Tamiris believed that each dance must create its own expressive means and as such did not develop an individual style or technique. She was one of the first choreographers to use jazz and spiritual music to explore social themes via dance. Tamiris also made works based on American themes working in concert dance (including Walt Whitman Suite and Salut au Monde).

Color recovery does rely on software support which is provided by libraries such as PHIGS, PEXLib, Starbase and Xlib (although Xlib does not enable it by default). When using Color Recovery the data is sent to the driver as a 24-bit image. The driver will then dither the data (in most cases this can be done by the graphics hardware for maximum performance) which is stored in the framebuffer as an 8-bit image. On displaying that 8-bit image data, HP's color recovery technology produces in real time an approximation of the original 24-bit image based on the hints provided by the dithered data. The result is significantly better looking than dithering alone. According to the article in HP's journal, the technique could achieve up to 23 bits of color accuracy.

He served as Bishop of Lincoln 1621‚Äì1641, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal 1621‚Äì1625, and Archbishop of York 1641‚Äì1646. He was the last bishop to serve as lord chancellor. Early life John Williams, Bishop of Lincoln, and later Archbishop of York, was born in Conwy, Wales, the second son of Edmund Williams and Mary Wynn. At a time when many bishops came from rather humble backgrounds, Williams prided himself on belonging to an \\"ancient family\\". He attended Ruthin School before graduating from St John's College, Cambridge BA 1601, MA 1605, BD 1613, and DD 1616. He became a fellow in 1603 and was a University Proctor in 1611‚Äì12. He entered the clergy and he first impressed the king by a sermon he preached in 1610. He became the king's chaplain in 1617. Political career In 1620 he was made Dean of Westminster and was swiftly elevated by King James I to the Bishopric of Lincoln in 1621, as well as being made Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. Throughout his political career Williams was identified as a strong supporter of King James, who, it has been said, valued him as a man \\"who knew his mind and would do his bidding\\"Kenyon, J.P. The Stuart Constitution 2nd Edition Cambridge University Press 1986 p.77 and with whom personally he had much in common. He alienated the Prince of Wales, the future Charles I by disapproving of his ill-fated expedition with the Duke of Buckingham to Madrid. When James I died and was succeeded by Charles I in 1625, Williams was quickly removed from the office of Lord Chancellor, and was prevented from attending Parliament. Though Williams managed to survive Buckingham, who was assassinated in 1628, he remained out of favour; he incurred the enmity of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1633 and his powerful ally Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, both of whom had great influence with Charles I. Williams's liberal attitudes toward the Puritans led to a legal battle with the Court of the Star Chamber. Laud's biographer refers to the original charge against him, of revealing State secrets, as frivolous;Trevor-Roper, Hugh Archbishop Laud Phoenix Press Reissue 2000 p.326 but Williams, in his efforts to clear himself, laid himself open to a charge of subornation of perjury, which was proved, and he was suspended from his benefices in 1636, fined, and imprisoned in the Tower of London until 1640.Trevor-Roper p.330The trial is published at 3 Howell State Trials 709. The sentence was \\"That the bishop of Lincoln be fined in 3,000 [pounds] to the king, and 3,000 to the archbishop; to be imprisoned during the king's pleasure; and, to make submission.\\" 3 How.S.T. at 818‚Äì19. Laud had assumed that the conviction would force Williams' resignation as Bishop of Lincoln; but to his fury Williams refused to resign and no machinery existed to remove him.Trevor-Roper p.332 Until his imprisonment, Williams remained defiantly at his episcopal palace, Buckden, lavishing hospitality on his neighbours. In 1640 the Lords forced the King to release him, and Williams resumed his offices and tried to steer a course between the extreme wings of the Church. He showed little pity for either Laud or Strafford, supporting the impeachment of both men. In the case of Laud there is no evidence that he approved of Laud's eventual execution; but it was otherwise with Strafford. He fatally weakened Strafford's cause in the House of Lords by arguing successfully that the bishops should absent themselves in cases involving the death penalty,Wedgwood, C.V. Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford 1593-1641- a revaluation Phoenix Press Reissue 2000 p. 330 and later specifically urged the King not to spare Strafford's life, arguing that in his public role he was discharged from his private promise to that effect.Wedgwood p.377 He was re-imprisoned by Parliament in 1641, but was released on bail in 1642 and went to be with the King in Yorkshire, as well as be enthroned as Archbishop of York, a position to which he had been appointed the previous year. His stay in Yorkshire was brief, however, and he spent the last years of his life in his native north Wales, initially supporting the royalist cause, but eventually coming to an accommodation with the local parliamentarian commander in 1646. Death and legacy Archbishop Williams died of quinsy in 1650 whilst staying with his kinsfolk, the Wynns of Gwydir, and was buried at the parish church of Llandygai. He had repurchased the family estate, which passed to his nephew Sir Griffith Williams. Through his niece Elizabeth Dolben he was the grand-uncle of a later Archbishop of York, John Dolben.

The series was a continuation of the serial Loving, which ran from 1983 until 1995, and featured the surviving central characters of its final major story arc, which saw most of the show's characters fall victim to a serial killer. The characters that survived moved from Corinth, Pennsylvania to New York City and settled in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo. The show was co-created by Agnes Nixon, the creator of Loving, and the show's last pair of headwriters, Barbara Esensten and James Harmon Brown. The show won two Daytime Emmy Awards in 1996.Daytime Emmys Storylines While it was started by Loving creator Agnes Nixon, The City was different from other soaps of its day, as the city wasn't the main setting of the series: the loft and its surroundings took precedence, and the city was secondary. Also, the show was shot on videotape using the Film look process for its entire run (one of two soap operas ever to do so, All My Children also used the FilmLook processing from 2006 to 2010). One of the most daring storylines was one involving a transsexual. Photographer Bernardo had a one night stand with model Azure C. He went to the corner to get some orange juice when he saw a picture of Azure C. before the sex change operation. The modeling agency which they both worked had to do a lot of damage control. The storyline began to take off but was soon dropped, in part due to the subject matter, protests from transgender rights groups who felt that the storyline presented trans people as a source of mockery, and in part due to lackluster reaction to actress Carlotta Chang's performance. Azure and Bernardo reconciled and left town. Despite featuring several well-known actors, such as Morgan Fairchild and Debbi Morgan, the series failed to catch on. In an attempt to remind viewers of the well-received \\"Loving Murders\\" storyline from Loving, in mid-1996 the show had most of the characters stalked (and some murdered by) a killer known as The Masquerader who left notes saying \\"Happy Now\\". The killer was revealed to be Danny's girlfriend Molly Malone, whose sweet, perky behavior belied her true nature. Several months later, Lorraine, who had dazzled critics and fans in the final months of Loving, joined the show. She had left her long-lost love Charles (Angie's ex-husband) and took up with fellow middle-aged alcoholic Nick Rivers. Rivers shared a past with Sydney Chase and there were plans to team the two up (they had palpable chemistry a decade earlier in ABC's short-lived prime time soap Paper Dolls) but the plans never materialized. The end Morgan Fairchild had only signed a one-year contract and left when that contract expired in late 1996. ABC replaced her with Jane Elliot, who was very popular as the witchy Tracy Quartermaine on General Hospital (Elliot had previously helped produce Loving from 1994 to 1995). Four months prior to her arrival, Elliot reprised her role on General Hospital for the summer to cross over on The City in the fall. However, despite Elliot's addition to the show, ratings continued to be the lowest of any daytime soap opera and ABC pulled the plug. Two months after the show's finale, after airing classic episodes of ABC's other soaps (All My Children, One Life to Live, and General Hospital) in The City time slot, ABC would replace the show with Port Charles, which remained until October 2003. The show did provide happy endings for most of its characters but when they failed to get Morgan Fairchild to appear again as Sydney Chase, the show killed her off by the \\"Happy Now\\" killer. Daytime talk show The View used Sydney Chase's loft set from The City until its fifth season. Cast The original characters of the show included the survivors of the murder storyline on Loving, including Ally Alden (played by Laura Wright), Steffi Brewster (Amelia Heinle), Alex Masters (Randolph Mantooth), Angie Hubbard (Debbi Morgan), Tess Wilder (Catherine Hickland), Buck Huston (Philip Brown), Danny Roberts (Ted King), Jocelyn Roberts (Lisa Lo Cicero), Jacob Foster (Darnell Williams), Frankie Hubbard (Alimi Ballard), Richard Wilkins (Corey Page), and Tony Soleito (George Palermo). Among the original characters there were Zoey (Joni Allen), Nick Rivers (Roscoe Born), Joey Soleito (James Sioutis), Bernard Castro (Philip Anthony-Rodriguez), Sydney Chase (Morgan Fairchild), Azure C (Carlotta Chang), and Molly Malone (Melissa Dye). Angie Hubbard and her son Frankie were characters that originated in the early 1980s on All My Children, and were transplated to Loving in 1993. Thus, with the premiere of The City in 1995, Angie and Frankie became the first two individuals who have been regular characters on three ABC soap operas.The only other character appearing as a regular on three ABC soap operas is Skye Chandler, portrayed by actress Robin Christopher on All My Children, One Life to Live, and General Hospital.In July 2002, Frankie returned to All My Children, portrayed by Jason Olive, and departed in December of that year. In December 2007, Frankie once again returned, this time portrayed by Cornelius Smith, Jr. Angie reappeared on AMC the following month, portrayed once again by Debbi Morgan. Likewise, Angie's portrayer Debbi Morgan became the first actor to portray the same character as a regular on three different soap operas.Alimi Ballard did not portray Frankie on All My Children. Characters from Loving, Cooper Alden (Michael Weatherly) and Deborah Alden (Nancy Addison) made brief appearances at the start of the series. By 1996, several original cast members had already left the series, including Anthony-Rodriguez, Ballard, Chang, Dye, Fairchild, and Heinle. To refresh the cast, and substitute Fairchild's departure, the show welcomed Tracy Quartermaine (a General Hospital character, played by Jane Elliot) to the show. Other new characters included Dillon Quartermaine (also from GH, played by P.J. Aliseo), Jared Chase (Joel Fabiani), Carla Soleito (Amy Van Horne), Gino Soleito (Al Martino, Joseph Sirola) and Lorraine Hawkins (Maggie Rush) who was also on Loving towards the end of the show. Ratings history The City fared poorly from the beginning, ranking last out of 11 soaps and averaging a 2.2 rating for the majority of the 1995‚Äì96 television season (Loving had left the air averaging a 2.5 rating between the months of September and November 1995). The ratings dropped to 2.0 for the 1996‚Äì97 television season, and producers tried to gain viewers by crossing over Jane Elliot's popular General Hospital character Tracy Quartermaine, who first appeared in October 1996.12 Characters in Search of a Soap Opera The City ranked last out of 11 soap operas on the air as late as the final week of February 1997, even below newcomer Sunset Beach, but a stronger than expected finale month in March 1997, coupled with a slight ratings slide for newcomer Sunset Beach, saved The City from last place in the ratings for both of its two seasons on the air. After The City aired its final episode, ABC temporarily aired classic 30-minute episodes of All My Children, One Life to Live, and General Hospital in its place. Port Charles, which would debut in The City's timeslot in June 1997, would post a 2.6 rating for 1996‚Äì97, and would not fall below The City's lowest yearly rating until 2000‚Äì2001.

As its name suggests, the storyline usually revolves around the political intrigues of people whose lives are intertwined in Washington, D.C. Synopsis Capitol revolves around the Denning, Clegg, and McCandless families, who live in the fictional Washington, D.C., suburb of Jeffersonia. At the center of the drama are feuding matriarchs Clarissa Tyler McCandless (Constance Towers) and Myrna Clegg (Carolyn Jones; Marla Adams; Marj Dusay). Kindly and down-to-earth Clarissa and vituperative and vindictive Myrna are former best friends who in their youth had been rivals over the love of Baxter McCandless; in retaliation for Baxter falling for Clarissa and not her, scheming Myrna had spread lies about Clarissa's father, liberal Congressman Judson (Rory Calhoun), linking him to communists during the McCarthy era. Baxter has left Clarissa a widow, and Myrna is married to wealthy industrialist Sam Clegg (Robert Sampson; Richard Egan). The longstanding feud between the women is inflamed when Clarissa's war-hero son Tyler McCandless (David Mason Daniels; Dane Witherspoon) falls in love with Myrna's daughter, Julie Clegg (Kimberly Beck; Catherine Hickland). Despite Myrna's best efforts to destroy this match, they eventually marry. Also featured are Myrna's other children: Trey (Nicholas Walker), who is being groomed for the presidency; Brenda (Leslie Graves; Shannon Terhune; Ashley Laurence; Karen Kelly), and Jordy (Todd Curtis, Russell Todd). Despite their mother's scheming and conniving, Julie, Jordy and Brenda were not like Myrna whatsoever. Trey, a young congressman, however was ambitious and could be ruthless. He disliked Tyler and considered him to be a rival. Besides Tyler and her father, Judson, Clarissa's family includes sons Wally (Bill Beyers), a young man with a gambling problem, Thomas (Brian Robert Taylor; Michael Catlin), a doctor, and Matt (Shea Farrell; Christopher Durham), a handsome athlete. Also living with them for a time was Clarissa's niece, Gillian (Kelly Palzis). Meanwhile, Clarissa is in love with Senator Mark Denning (Ed Nelson) who is in an unhappy marriage with agoraphobic Paula (Julie Adams) and is the father of reporter Sloane Denning (Debrah Farentino). Clarissa later falls for Jarrett Morgan (Ron Harper), who turns out to be her presumed-dead husband Baxter. While the original focus was on the Romeo and Juliet style love story of Tyler and Julie, the bulk of the storyline quickly switched to Trey and Sloane whose 1984 wedding was filmed on location at the Jefferson Memorial. Trey's previous relationship with former prostitute Kelly Harper (Jane Daly; Jess Walton) produced a son, Scotty, and eventually caused Trey and Sloane to divorce. Julie and Tyler dealt with constant interference by Myrna as well as Julie's inability to have a child. Playboy Jordy had several serious romances, most notably with feisty Lizabeth Bachman (Tonja Walker) and sweet Leanne Foster (Christine Kellogg). Capitol was also notable for having a major handicapped character, Dr. Thomas McCandless, a successful surgeon in spite of having to walk with the help of crutches. Thomas was paired originally with the flirtatious Lizabeth who loved him in spite of also being attracted to Jordy. Later on, after Trey and Kelly broke up, Thomas became involved with Kelly, which involved him in another triangle with a member of the Clegg family. The Cleggs and McCandlesses became further tied together, to Myrna's chagrin, through the romance of Wally and Brenda. The older characters were busy in storylines as well, most notably Clarissa and Mark who had to deal with the psychotic Paula (Julie Adams) who pretended to be agoraphobic as she plotted to murder Clarissa, while Myrna had to struggle with the news that Matt McCandless's girlfriend, Amy Burke, was Sam's illegitimate daughter. Lana Wood, Natalie Wood's younger sister, was cast in the part, but the storyline was dropped after a little more than six months. The older character's pasts were explored more deeply when the wheelchair bound Jared Morgan (Ron Harper) was revealed to be Clarissa's supposedly deceased husband, Baxter. The performances of the older actors were honored with several Soap Opera Digest Nominations, but none of the cast were ever Emmy Nominated. Primetime TV veteran Marj Dusay took over the role of Myrna in April 1983 when Carolyn Jones became too ill to continue and her temporary substitute, Marla Adams, joined The Young and the Restless. Dusay was credited for helping to flesh out the character of the scheming Myrna to make her more multi-dimensional and would remain on the show through the remainder of the run. The casting of Jess Walton as Kelly Harper was also critically praised as the extremely complex Sloane returned to her old scheming nature in order to keep her marriage to Trey on solid ground. Veteran character actor Arthur Malet (\\"Young Frankenstein\\", \\"Heaven Can Wait\\") was cast as Kelly's older friend who had taken her in while she was pregnant with Scotty, and later on, Lola Falana was cast as an artist's representative who took an interest in Kelly's painting and aided her in pursuing a career as an artist. This storyline also cast Dark Shadows veteran Lara Parker as a distinguished gallery owner, but unfortunately, Falana's storyline was never developed beyond the hint of a mysterious past. With Washington D.C. having a large black population, soap critics complained that Capitol writers were not taking advantage of this fact to tell important stories, and Falana lasted less than a year. In 1983, Zed Diamond, portrayed by Bradley Lockerman, arrived in Washington. Diamond was a wealthy man of mystery. He was handsome and articulate but little was known about his past except rumors. He owned the successful restaurant Mario's, which the rich and powerful frequented. He also owned a local television station. He was polite and gracious to the patrons of his restaurant. But he could be dark and a deadly man of action when sufficiently provoked. He disliked Trey Clegg, whom he considered to be a gutless backstabber. He had no love for Myrna and Sam Clegg whom had mistreated his late mother. Zed's mother had been a maid at the Clegg mansion many years prior. The Clegg's had fired his mother, whom they wrongfully accused of stealing from them. This destroyed his mother's reputation making it impossible for her to find work. He was kind to Julie Clegg McCandless, whom he liked. He would have an affair with Sloane Denning Clegg. Sloane slept with Diamond for revenge when she discovered the long-term relationship between Trey and Kelly, that Trey had never mentioned prior to their marriage. Zed was also involved in storylines concerning his mysterious past which involved his relationship with the head of a powerful crime family and that man's daughter Jenny. The re-casting of Julie Clegg McCandless with Catherine Hickland was a plus, especially when the mysterious Zed Diamond appeared on the scene, shocked by her resemblance to his late wife, Jenny. Eventually, the character of Jenny was revealed to be alive, also played by Hickland, and gave her the opportunity to show off her chops playing a dangerous character, Jenny being revealed to have major psychological problems. When Jenny and Zed's storyline took off, Julie faded into the background, having gone off to find husband Tyler who was revealed to be involved in an off-screen affair. After Jenny's demise, Hickland remained off screen for several months, only returning as Julie, who had left Tyler, for the last few months of the show with basically no storyline of her own. Although a relationship between Julie and Zed Diamond was just beginning when the show was cancelled. Hickland would go on to several other soaps playing a variety of schemers as would Jess Walton, Constance Towers and Marj Dusay. At one point, Hickland, Towers and Dusay were dominating all of the ABC soaps as villainesses of very nefarious natures while Walton found great success on The Young and the Restless by taking over the role of Jill Foster. As with other soap operas in the mid 1980s, Capitol tried its hand with adventure storylines, pairing Sloane with Prince Ali (Peter Lochran), the potential King of Baraq, a fictional Islamic nation undergoing political strife. Much of the action took place outside the United States and while it paralleled much of what was going on in the real world, audiences began to drift away. Soap Opera Digest praised the Sloane and Ali pairing, naming their romantic moments as the best love scenes of 1986. In spite of that praise, the show was criticized for taking its storyline twists to bizarre extremes. Within short periods of time, Sam Clegg was revealed to have fathered Scotty, not Trey, and Mark Denning was revealed to be a traitor. This infuriated veteran actor Ed Nelson so much that he quit in disgust. Rory Calhoun had also departed the show, although he did sign a new contract shortly before the cancellation announcement, reappearing around the same time as Catherine Hickland. The last weeks of the show focused on Sloane's taking over as Queen of Baraq (Ali was presumed dead) and her efforts to hide from his enemies. Several new characters were introduced, the most memorable being Laureen Clegg (Janis Paige), Sam's first wife and Trey's real mother, who kept her identity secret and became Scotty's nanny. Sam, having become involved in an affair with the much younger Kate Wells (Cheryl Ann Wilson), found himself the victim of blackmail after breaking off with Kate as she had discovered the truth about Scotty's paternity. This led the show to present two cliff-hangers, Myrna's vowing of war after Sam at Kate's demand demanded a divorce, and Sloane's standing in front of a firing squad. Production CBS asked The Young and the Restless producer John Conboy to produce an equivalent in daytime during summer 1981 to compete with the more youth oriented ABC soap operas such as All My Children and General Hospital that were the top 2 rated daytime dramas at the time. Capitol became the first soap opera to be produced in Los Angeles since The Young and the Restless had begun in 1973. Capitol premiered on March 29, 1982 on CBS, replacing Search for Tomorrow in its timeslot after that show's producers, Procter & Gamble was rebuffed by CBS to move their show in its former timeslot, and when its contract with the network expired, Search For Tomorrow moved to NBC, running until the end of 1986. The show's title sequence during its early years showed aerial scenes of Washington, D.C. shot during the winter of 1980 to 1981. In the final year, a computerized sequence was instituted, illustrating glamour and sex in addition to the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial. Cancelation During most of its run the show had steady ratings and held on in the middle of the pack of the soaps. The storylines that were resolved beginning in the 1985‚Äì86 season, however, caused a rather steep fall in ratings. Not only was Scotty Harper revealed to have been fathered by Sam Clegg, Senator Mark Denning turned out to be a spy. Sloane was paired with an Arab prince, Prince Ali (Peter Lochran), which gave the opportunity for some exotic love scenes. With Clarissa not sure if the man she thought was Baxter was really her long presumed dead husband, the show veered further off track by revealing that Clarissa and Baxter's son, Matt, was really Prince Ali's long-lost brother, adopted by Baxter to prevent him from being killed. However, the addition of film and stage actress Janis Paige as Sam's long gone first wife Laureen was filled with potential that never got the chance to be explored. By early summer 1986, CBS had lost faith in Capitol and, needing a replacement, then- head of CBS Daytime, Michael Brockman requested proposals from industry writers and producers. Veteran producer Paul Rauch responded with an idea for a more satirical serial called Grosse Pointe about a wealthy and dysfunctional blue blood family from Grosse Pointe, while Ryan's Hope co-creator Claire Labine's proposed drama was titled Celebration that would revolve around a middle-class family in the suburbs of Cleveland that would be produced by Procter & Gamble. Her family-driven concept and traditional approach lacked the overt glamour of Capitol and fell more along the lines of As the World Turns or Another World, but would include a modern 80s twist to keep the show current. Ultimately, however, neither Rauch's nor Labine's concepts would make it to the air. That December, CBS announced that Capitol would be cancelled, with its final episode airing in March 1987. Premiering in its place would be Bill and Lee Phillip Bell's new production, a sister show to their very popular The Young and the Restless called The Bold and the Beautiful. Accommodating the successor soap opera's launch meant accelerating production on Capitol's remaining episodes, so the last two months' shows were taped in the span of a month. Conboy and head writer James Lipton brought the soap's saga to a loose ending with a cliffhanger series finale which left Sam being blackmailed by his lover Kate into asking Myrna for a divorce, and Sloane placed in front of a firing squad in the Middle Eastern kingdom of her lover, King Ali. Cast During its run, Capitol featured several well-known veteran actors of the stage and screen in contract roles, including Richard Egan, Carolyn Jones, Rory Calhoun, Constance Towers and Julie Adams. In the show's earlier years, singer Lola Falana played wealthy entertainment mogul Charity Blake, and Natalie Wood's sister Lana Wood played Fran Burke. In 1986, country music singer Tammy Wynette made appearances as hairstylist-turned-singer Darlene Stankowski. Stage veteran and Oscar nominee Beah Richards had a short term role around the same time. In the show's last month, Broadway and movie veteran Janis Paige played Sam's first wife, Laureen, who was Trey's mother. *Carolyn Jones as Myrna Clegg #1 (1982‚Äì1983) *Marla Adams as Myrna Clegg #2 (1983) *Marj Dusay as Myrna Clegg #3 (1983‚Äì1987) *Teri Hatcher as Angelica Stimac Clegg (1986‚Äì1987) *Robert Sampson as Samuel Clegg II #1 (1982) *Richard Egan as Samuel Clegg II #2 (1982‚Äì1987) *Tonja Walker as Lizbeth Bachman (1982‚Äì1984) *Kimberly Beck-Hilton as Julie Clegg #1 (1982‚Äì1983) *Catherine Hickland as Julie Clegg McCandless #2 (1983‚Äì1987) *Nicholas Walker as Trey Clegg *Todd Curtis as Jordy Clegg *Leslie Graves as Brenda Clegg #1 (1982‚Äì1984) *Shannon Terhune as Brenda Clegg #2 (1984) *Ashley Laurence as Brenda Clegg #3 (1984‚Äì1985) *Karen Kelly as Brenda Clegg #4 (1985‚Äì1987) *Constance Towers as Clarissa McCandless *Bradley Lockerman as Zed Diamond (1983-1987) *David Mason Daniels as Tyler McCandless #1 (1982‚Äì1985) *Dane Witherspoon as Tyler McCandless #2 (1985‚Äì1986) *Kelly Preston as Gillian McCandless (1982) *Bill Beyers as Wallace \\"Wally\\" McCandless *Brian Robert Taylor as Thomas McCandless #1 (1982‚Äì1983) *Jane Daly as Shelly Granger (1982-1983) *Rory Calhoun as Judge Judson Tyler *Burke Byrnes as Dr. Franklin *Ed Nelson as Senator Mark Denning *Michael Catlin as Thomas McCandless #2 (1983‚Äì1987) *Shea Farrell as Matt McCandless #1 (1982) *Christopher Durham as Matt McCandless #2 (1982‚Äì1984) *Tawny Kitaen as Meredith Ross #1 (unknown) *Ginger Alden as Meredith Ross #2 (1986-1987) *Tammy Wynette as Darlene Stankowski (1986‚Äì1987) *Billy Warlock as Ricky Driscoll (1984‚Äì1985) *Jess Walton as Kelly Harper (1984‚Äì1987) *Debrah Farentino as Sloane Denning (1982‚Äì1987) *Julie Parrish as Maggie Brady *Rodney Saulsberry as Jeff Johnson (1982‚Äì1983) Main crew * Peggy O'Shea * Craig Carlson * Granville Burgess * Richard Camp * Peggy Sloane * John Sedlak * Steve Hayes * John William Corrington * Joyce Corrington * Shirley Hartman * Susan Goldberg * David Carren * Carly Cady * Stephen Karpf * Elinor Karpf Scheduling/ratings On June 8, 1981, CBS moved Search for Tomorrow, daytime television's longest- tenured soap and a fixture for nearly 30 years at 12:30 PM/11:30 AM Central, to the 2:30/1:30 PM timeslot between As the World Turns and Guiding Light in order to accommodate the hit serial The Young and the Restless. Procter & Gamble, who owned Search for Tomorrow, urged CBS to return the show to its former slot. The network refused, and when their contract with CBS expired, P&G; sold Search for Tomorrow to NBC Daytime and the show premiered there on March 29, 1982. CBS replaced Search for Tomorrow with Capitol in its timeslot, scheduled against the last halves of NBC's Another World and ABC's One Life to Live, the latter of which dominated the ratings at the time. Capitol debuted on CBS in 1982 in 8th place in the ratings, roughly the same as Search for Tomorrow had done. Capitol remained in the middle of the ratings pack throughout its five-year run ranking between 7th and 9th, with its best ratings points of 6.4 achieved in the 1983-1984 television season, in which it ranked 8th. In 1985, ratings fell slightly from a 5.8 to a 5.1, prompting some CBS affiliates to drop the show. CBS subsequently canceled the show and replaced it with The Bold and the Beautiful on March 23, 1987. However, CBS put The Bold and the Beautiful in the 1:30/12:30 timeslot, bumping As the World Turns to 2/1. The Bold and the Beautiful became both CBS' and America's second-highest rated soap opera, but its ratings never surpassed Capitol ratings peak.

The original specification was written by BEA Systems, Microsoft, IBM, and Tibco and in March, 2003 and subsequently refined over the next two years. The February, 2005 version was submitted to the OASIS Web Services Reliable Exchange (WS-RX) Technical Committee in June of that year. The resulting WS-ReliableMessaging 1.1 was approved as an OASIS Standard on June 14, 2007, and v1.2 was approved on February 2, 2009. Prior to WS-ReliableMessaging, OASIS produced a competing standard (WS-Reliability) that was supported by a coalition of vendors; namely Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, Oracle Corporation, Progress Software, and Sun Microsystems. Most of these vendors now also support the WS-ReliableMessaging specification. Reliable Messaging Model right An Application Source (AS) wishes to reliably send messages to an Application Destination (AD) over an unreliable infrastructure. To accomplish this, they make use of a Reliable Messaging Source (RMS) and a Reliable Messaging Destination (RMD). The AS sends a message to the RMS. The RMS uses the WS-ReliableMessaging (WS-RM) protocol to transmit the message to the RMD. The RMD delivers the message to the AD. If the RMS cannot transmit the message to the RMD for some reason, it must raise an exception or otherwise indicate to the AS that the message was not transmitted. The AS and RMS may be implemented within the same process space or they may be separate components. Similarly, the AD and RMD may exist within the same process space or they may be separate components. The important thing to keep in mind is that the WS-RM specification only deals with the contents and behavior of messages as they appear \\"on the wire\\". How messages are sent from the AS to the RMS, how they are delivered from the RMD to the AD, whether messages are persisted on-disk or held in memory, etc.; none of these considerations are part of the WS-RM specification. The WS-RM protocol defines and supports a number of Delivery Assurances. These are: ;AtLeastOnce: Each message will be delivered to the AD at least once. If a message cannot be delivered, an error must be raised by the RMS and/or the RMD. Messages may be delivered to the AD more than once (i.e. the AD may get duplicate messages). ;AtMostOnce: Each message will be delivered to the AD at most once. Messages might not be delivered to the AD, but the AD will never get duplicate messages. ;ExactlyOnce: Each message will be delivered to the AD exactly once. If a message cannot be delivered, an error must be raised by the RMS and/or the RMD. The AD will never get duplicate messages. ;InOrder: Messages will be delivered from the RMD to the AD in the order that they are sent from the AS to the RMS. This assurance can be combined with any of the above assurances. Composable Architecture WS-ReliableMessaging uses the extensibility model of SOAP and WSDL. WS-ReliableMessaging does not define all the features required for a complete messaging solution. WS-ReliableMessaging is a building block that is used in conjunction with other Web Services specifications and application-specific protocols to build a complete messaging solution. Criticism This article attempts to make the case that reliability is not needed at the message level, but required at the business level.

Intersection cohomology was used to prove the Kazhdan‚ÄìLusztig conjectures and the Riemann‚ÄìHilbert correspondence. It is closely related to L2 cohomology. Goresky‚ÄìMacPherson approach The homology groups of a compact, oriented, connected, n-dimensional manifold X have a fundamental property called Poincar√© duality: there is a perfect pairing : H_i(X,\\\\Q) \\\\times H_{n-i}(X,\\\\Q) \\\\to H_0(X,\\\\Q) \\\\cong \\\\Q. Classically-- going back, for instance, to Henri Poincar√©--this duality was understood in terms of intersection theory. An element of :H_j(X) is represented by a j-dimensional cycle. If an i-dimensional and an (n-i)-dimensional cycle are in general position, then their intersection is a finite collection of points. Using the orientation of X one may assign to each of these points a sign; in other words intersection yields a 0-dimensional cycle. One may prove that the homology class of this cycle depends only on the homology classes of the original i- and (n-i)-dimensional cycles; one may furthermore prove that this pairing is perfect. When X has singularities--that is, when the space has places that do not look like \\\\R^n--these ideas break down. For example, it is no longer possible to make sense of the notion of \\"general position\\" for cycles. Goresky and MacPherson introduced a class of \\"allowable\\" cycles for which general position does make sense. They introduced an equivalence relation for allowable cycles (where only \\"allowable boundaries\\" are equivalent to zero), and called the group :IH_i(X) of i-dimensional allowable cycles modulo this equivalence relation \\"intersection homology\\". They furthermore showed that the intersection of an i- and an (n-i)-dimensional allowable cycle gives an (ordinary) zero-cycle whose homology class is well- defined. Stratifications Intersection homology was originally defined on suitable spaces with a stratification, though the groups often turn out to be independent of the choice of stratification. There are many different definitions of stratified spaces. A convenient one for intersection homology is an n-dimensional topological pseudomanifold. This is a (paracompact, Hausdorff) space X that has a filtration : \\\\emptyset = X_{-1} \\\\subset X_0 \\\\subset X_1 \\\\subset \\\\cdots \\\\subset X_n = X of X by closed subspaces such that: *For each i and for each point x of X_i \\\\setminus X_{i-1}, there exists a neighborhood U \\\\subset X of x in X, a compact (n-i-1)-dimensional stratified space L, and a filtration-preserving homeomorphism U \\\\cong \\\\R^i \\\\times CL. Here CL is the open cone on L. *X_{n-1} = X_{n-2}. *X\\\\setminus X_{n-1} is dense in X. If X is a topological pseudomanifold, the i-dimensional stratum of X is the space X_i \\\\setminus X_{i-1}. Examples: *If X is an n-dimensional simplicial complex such that every simplex is contained in an n-simplex and n‚àí1 simplex is contained in exactly two n-simplexes, then the underlying space of X is a topological pseudomanifold. *If X is any complex quasi-projective variety (possibly with singularities) then its underlying space is a topological pseudomanifold, with all strata of even dimension. Perversities Intersection homology groups I^\\\\mathbf{p}H_i(X) depend on a choice of perversity \\\\mathbf{p}, which measures how far cycles are allowed to deviate from transversality. (The origin of the name \\"perversity\\" was explained by .) A perversity \\\\mathbf{p} is a function :\\\\mathbf{p}\\\\colon\\\\Z_{\\\\geq 2} \\\\to \\\\Z from integers \\\\geq 2 to the integers such that *\\\\mathbf{p}(2) = 0. *\\\\mathbf{p}(k+1) - \\\\mathbf{p}(k) \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}. The second condition is used to show invariance of intersection homology groups under change of stratification. The complementary perversity \\\\mathbf{q} of \\\\mathbf{p} is the one with :\\\\mathbf{p}(k)+\\\\mathbf{q}(k)=k-2. Intersection homology groups of complementary dimension and complementary perversity are dually paired. = Examples of perversities = *The minimal perversity has p(k) = 0. Its complement is the maximal perversity with q(k)=k-2. *The (lower) middle perversity m is defined by m(k)=[(k-2)/2], the integer part of (k-2)/2. Its complement is the upper middle perversity, with values [(k-1)/2]. If the perversity is not specified, then one usually means the lower middle perversity. If a space can be stratified with all strata of even dimension (for example, any complex variety) then the intersection homology groups are independent of the values of the perversity on odd integers, so the upper and lower middle perversities are equivalent. Singular intersection homology Fix a topological pseudomanifold X of dimension n with some stratification, and a perversity p. A map œÉ from the standard i-simplex \\\\Delta^i to X (a singular simplex) is called allowable if :\\\\sigma^{-1} \\\\left (X_{n-k}\\\\setminus X_{n-k-1} \\\\right) is contained in the i-k+p(k) skeleton of \\\\Delta^i. The complex I^p(X) is a subcomplex of the complex of singular chains on X that consists of all singular chains such that both the chain and its boundary are linear combinations of allowable singular simplexes. The singular intersection homology groups (with perversity p) :I^pH_i(X) are the homology groups of this complex. If X has a triangulation compatible with the stratification, then simplicial intersection homology groups can be defined in a similar way, and are naturally isomorphic to the singular intersection homology groups. The intersection homology groups are independent of the choice of stratification of X. If X is a topological manifold, then the intersection homology groups (for any perversity) are the same as the usual homology groups. Small resolutions A resolution of singularities :f:X\\\\to Y of a complex variety Y is called a small resolution if for every r > 0, the space of points of Y where the fiber has dimension r is of codimension greater than 2r. Roughly speaking, this means that most fibers are small. In this case the morphism induces an isomorphism from the (intersection) homology of X to the intersection homology of Y (with the middle perversity). There is a variety with two different small resolutions that have different ring structures on their cohomology, showing that there is in general no natural ring structure on intersection (co)homology. Sheaf theory Deligne's formula for intersection cohomology states that :I^pH_{n-i}(X) = I^pH^i(X) = H^{i}_c(IC_p(X)) where IC_p(X) is a certain complex of constructible sheaves on X (considered as an element of the derived category, so the cohomology on the right means the hypercohomology of the complex). The complex IC_p(X) is given by starting with the constant sheaf on the open set X\\\\setminus X_{n-2} and repeatedly extending it to larger open sets X\\\\setminus X_{n-k} and then truncating it in the derived category; more precisely it is given by Deligne's formula :IC_p(X) = \\\\tau_{\\\\le p(n)-n}Ri_{n*}\\\\tau_{\\\\le p(n-1)-n}Ri_{n-1*}\\\\cdots\\\\tau_{\\\\le p(2)-n}Ri_{2*} \\\\Complex_{X\\\\setminus X_{n-2}} where \\\\tau_{\\\\le p} is a truncation functor in the derived category, i_k is the inclusion of X\\\\setminus X_{n-k} into X\\\\setminus X_{n-k-1}, and \\\\Complex_{X\\\\setminus X_{n-2}} is the constant sheaf on X\\\\setminus X_{n-2}.Warning: there is more than one convention for the way that the perversity enters Deligne's construction: the numbers p(k)-n are sometimes written as p(k). By replacing the constant sheaf on X\\\\setminus X_{n-2} with a local system, one can use Deligne's formula to define intersection cohomology with coefficients in a local system.  Examples  Given a smooth elliptic curve X \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{CP}^2 defined by a cubic homogeneous polynomial fpg 281-282, such as x^3 + y^3 + z^3, the affine cone > \\\\mathbb{V}(f) \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{C}^3 has an isolated singularity at the origin since f(0) = 0 and all partial derivatives \\\\partial_if(0) = 0 vanish. This is because it is homogeneous of degree 3, and the derivatives are homogeneous of degree 2. Setting U = \\\\mathbb{V}(f) -\\\\\\\\{0\\\\\\\\} and i:U \\\\to X the inclusion map, the intersection complex IC_{\\\\mathbb{V}(f)} is given as > \\\\tau_{\\\\leq 1} \\\\mathbf{R}f_*\\\\mathbb{Q}_U This can be computed explicitly by looking at the stalks of the cohomology. At p \\\\in \\\\mathbb{V}(f) where p eq 0 the derived pushforward is the identity map on a smooth point, hence the only possible cohomology is concentrated in degree 0. For p = 0 the cohomology is more interesting since > \\\\mathbf{R}^if_*\\\\mathbb{Q}_U_{p=0} = \\\\underset{ V \\\\subset U }\\\\text{colim} > H^i(V; \\\\mathbb{Q}) for V where the closure of i(V) contains the origin. Since any V can be refined by considering the intersection of an open disk in \\\\mathbb{C}^3 with U, we can just compute the cohomology of H^i(U;\\\\mathbb{Q}). This can be done by observing U is a \\\\mathbb{C}^* bundle over the elliptic curve E, the hyperplane bundle, and the Wang sequence gives the cohomology groups > \\\\begin{matrix} H^0(U;\\\\mathbb{Q})\\\\cong H^0(E;\\\\mathbb{Q}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ > H^1(U;\\\\mathbb{Q})\\\\cong H^1(E;\\\\mathbb{Q}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ H^2(U;\\\\mathbb{Q})\\\\cong > H^1(E;\\\\mathbb{Q}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ H^3(U;\\\\mathbb{Q})\\\\cong H^2(E;\\\\mathbb{Q}) \\\\\\\\\\\\ > \\\\end{matrix} hence the cohomology sheaves at the stalk p=0 are > \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\mathcal{H}^2(\\\\mathbf{R}^2f_*\\\\mathbb{Q}_U_{p=0}) & = & > \\\\mathbb{Q}_{p=0} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\mathcal{H}^1(\\\\mathbf{R}^2f_*\\\\mathbb{Q}_U_{p=0}) & = & > \\\\mathbb{Q}_{p=0}^{\\\\oplus 2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ > \\\\mathcal{H}^0(\\\\mathbf{R}^2f_*\\\\mathbb{Q}_U_{p=0}) & = & \\\\mathbb{Q}_{p=0} > \\\\end{matrix} truncating this gives the nontrivial cohomology sheaves \\\\mathcal{H}^0,\\\\mathcal{H}^1, hence the intersection cohomology sheaf is > IC_{\\\\mathbb{V}(f)} = \\\\mathbb{Q}_{\\\\mathbb{V}(f)}\\\\oplus \\\\mathbb{Q}_{p=0}[-1] The last decomposition follows from the Decomposition theorem. Properties of the complex IC(X) The complex ICp(X) has the following properties *On the complement of some closed set of codimension 2, we have :H^i(j_x^* IC_p) is 0 for i + m ‚â† 0, and for i = ‚àím the groups form the constant local system C *H^i(j_x^* IC_p) is 0 for i + m < 0 *If i > 0 then H^{-i}(j_x^* IC_p) is zero except on a set of codimension at least a for the smallest a with p(a) ‚â• m ‚àí i *If i > 0 then H^{-i}(j_x^! IC_p) is zero except on a set of codimension at least a for the smallest a with q(a) ‚â• (i) As usual, q is the complementary perversity to p. Moreover, the complex is uniquely characterized by these conditions, up to isomorphism in the derived category. The conditions do not depend on the choice of stratification, so this shows that intersection cohomology does not depend on the choice of stratification either. Verdier duality takes ICp to ICq shifted by n = dim(X) in the derived category.

It was recorded from late 1994 to early 1995, and released on July 21, 1995, through Kill Rock Stars, his first album on the label. It was preceded by the single \\"Needle in the Hay\\", released in early January 1995.  Background  After being impressed by Smith, Mary Lou Lord invited him to tour with her, and helped him to sign to Kill Rock Stars.  Content  The album is of a similar musical style to Roman Candle in its minimalist, acoustic folk sound. Smith mostly appears alone on his acoustic guitar, although he is occasionally backed up by the odd musical instrument, such as a harmonica and drums. Rolling Stone wrote of the album, \\"the music burrows, digging up gems of structure, melody and lyrical vividness that belie his na√Øve delivery [...] the sound is hummable pop, slowed and drugged, with tricky but unshowy guitar work driving the melodies forward\\". The album's lyrics contain many references to drug use, which Smith claimed were merely metaphorical. The album cover, depicting cut-out figures falling from buildings as if they were committing suicide, features a photograph by J.J. Gonson, who also photographed the cover for Roman Candle. The song \\"Clementine\\" is a reworking of the 19th century American western folk ballad \\"Oh My Darling, Clementine\\", which Smith would reference again in a later song, \\"Sweet Adeline\\", released in 1998 on XO. Smith wrote this song about a close friend, Clementine Hudson, who joined him on some lo-fi home recordings in his early career before pursuing a career in accountancy. The song \\"Christian Brothers\\" was also performed with Heatmiser in a full-band arrangement, recorded around the same time as the version featured on Elliott Smith; Heatmiser's version was released on the soundtrack of Heaven Adores You, a 2014 documentary about Smith's life and music. Thematically, Smith said that he \\"personally can't get more dark\\" than his self-titled album.  Release  \\"Needle in the Hay\\", the album's only single, was released in early January 1995. Elliott Smith was released on July 21, 1995, through Kill Rock Stars, making it his first full-length album on the label. In contrast to Roman Candle, Elliott Smith was \\"promoted heavily\\", with posters of Smith appearing in the windows of record stores across the Northwest District of Portland, Oregon, where Smith lived at the time. The album will be reissued in an remastered and expanded 25th anniversary edition on August 28, 2020. The release will also feature a live album, Live at Umbra Penumbra, a 1994 performance at a Portland caf√©, thought to be the earliest-known live recording of Smith performing as a solo artist. As part of the anniversary edition, J.J. Gonson, the artist behind the Elliott Smith album cover, is releasing a 52-page coffee table book with handwritten lyrics, words from Smith's peers about the album's creation, and a series of previously unseen photographs. Gonson is also releasing a series of photo prints of Smith, one per month through August 2020, available for purchase through Morrison Hotel Gallery. Of the reissue, Kill Rock Stars co-founder Slim Moon said:  Reception  While not believed to have been reviewed by many, if any, critics at the time of its release, Elliott Smith has been critically well-received retrospectively. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote \\"Elliott Smith contains the blueprint for his later successes, and more importantly, it's a fully-realized work itself.\\" Trouser Press described it as \\"bleak, almost uncomfortably unsparing and yet tragically beautiful\\", and that \\"the songs, melodies, arrangements and production are all stronger and more fully realized than those on Roman Candle\\".  Legacy  Pitchfork rated \\"Needle in the Hay\\" as the twenty-seventh best song of the 1990s. \\"Christian Brothers\\" has been covered by Queens of the Stone Age, with frontman Josh Homme emphasizing how much he loves the song. Rolling Stone magazine described Smith as \\"ferociously talented\\", and the music as \\"some of the loveliest songs about the dissolution of a soul ever written [...] hypnotic and terribly, unrelentingly sad\\".

He was nicknamed \\"Carlsson p√• taket\\" (\\"Carlsson on the roof\\" in reference to the children's book character) as well as Mr. Saab (due to his public relations work for the company). Early life Carlsson was born in Trollh√§ttan. Erik Carlsson married Pat Moss on 9 July 1963Mr Saab, The Tale of Erik Carlsson \\"on the roof\\", page 9. in London. Pat was also a famous rally driver and younger sister of Stirling Moss. On December 1, 1969 they had a daughter, Susie Carlsson, who was later to become successful in show jumping. Saab car history Because the early Saabs in which he competed were seriously underpowered and with the tuned two-strokers it was necessary to keep the revs up, he had to maintain a high speed while cornering and practiced left-foot braking to perfection. Rally career Carlsson's replica 1963 Monte Carlo rally car at Link√∂ping, on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of Saab in 1997 In 1965 Pat Moss and Erik Carlsson wrote a book: The Art and Technique of Driving (published by Heinemann, London, selling for 25 shillings). This book was translated into Dutch, German, Japanese and Spanish. The expression \\"Carlsson on the roof\\" originated from the children's story Karlsson p√• taket by Astrid Lindgren, in which a Karlsson character lived on the roof of an apartment building. The name was given to Carlsson as a result of his habit of occasionally rolling a rally car onto its roof. In the Safari Rally, he even rolled the car intentionally, to escape from a mud pool. When journalists later doubted his story, he proved it by rolling the car again. The Ford factory team then tried the same stunt with their Ford Cortina, causing more damage to the car than had occurred during the entire rally. Carlsson has done a number of unusual things during his rally career. During one rally in the United Kingdom, he needed a spare part and happened to find a brand new Saab 96 on a parking lot. He and the mechanic quickly started disassembling the car when the rather upset owner discovered them. The co-driver managed to defuse the situation by explaining that Carlsson was a factory driver for Saab and the owner would be given a new car. In the end Carlsson could keep driving and they remained friends and still exchange Christmas cards. At the time, rally regulations often stipulated penalties for damage to the car at the finish. Towards the end of the rally, Carlsson's car had acquired dents to both the front fender and one door, so to avoid the penalty points they stopped and switched the door and bumper with the support car. Then it looked a bit suspicious to have a clean door and fender while the rest of the car was covered in mud and dust. As they had no water they used the spare gasoline to wash off the car. Reporters covering the event were impressed that they had had the time to wash the car before arriving at the rally finish. After the finishing festivities, Carlsson looked out the window from his hotel room and saw the support car parked outside: clean, but with a dirty door and fender, still with the starting number visible in the dust. Erik Carlsson and Sonett III, 2005 SOC, Essen, Germany. Carlsson started the 1959 Rally of Portugal leading the European championship. His closest competitor was Paul Coltelloni, a works Citro√´n team driver, but to prevent Carlsson from winning, Citro√´n had bought Coltelloni an Alfa Romeo. As the event passed through Spain, the blue Saab Carlsson was sharing with British Rally Champion John Sprinzel began suffering from a grabbing front brake. Cresting the brow of a hill in the gathering dusk at over , the crew spotted a closed railway level crossing only yards in front of them. Heavy braking caused the car to spin and roll over into the barrier, where they narrowly avoided being hit by the passing train. Despite this incident, and the subsequent electrical problems it caused, they finished third and it was enough to finish fourth for Carlsson to win the championship. However, shortly before the prize ceremony, they were told they would be given a 25-point penalty for their car having white competition numbers on a black background, instead of the other way around. Still, 25 penalty points only pushed them down to 4th place, so the European championship would be safe. It was only at the prize ceremony itself that they discovered that they had been given an additional 25-point penalty, putting them in eighth position. When they asked why, they were told they had been given 25 penalty points per door.Spritely Years (Patrick Stephens, 1994) by John Sprinzel and Tom Coulthard. In the 1966 Coupe des Alpes Carlsson drove an almost-competitive car, a Saab Sonett II. The two-stroke engine had been bored to 940 cc compared to the 841 of the standard model and it gave at most . The final drive was geared down so the top speed was only , but could be reached from standstill in eight seconds. The car was capable of holding station with the Porsche 904. But they ran into problems with the spark plugs. Frequent spark plug changes were not unusual for tuned two-stroke engines, but it used up spark plugs at an unusual rate and soon they had run out of spare spark plugs and had to give up. Sabotage was suspected and the gasoline was sent to Saab for analysis, where they found that it had been contaminated with a foreign substance. In the 1961 German Rally the DKW team started a rumour that he was using an illicit four-speed gearbox in his Saab 96 (the standard car only had three gears). They disassembled the gearbox, but found no fourth gear. It turned out that Carlsson had fooled them by dipping the clutch in third gear to make it sound like a four speed.Octane: Carlsson‚Äôs half-century In 2010, Carlsson was among the first four inductees into the Rally Hall of Fame, along with Rauno Aaltonen, Paddy Hopkirk and Timo M√§kinen. Carlsson died on 27 May 2015.

Overview The WSRP specification defines a web service interface for interacting with presentation-oriented web services. Initial work was produced through the joint efforts of the Web Services for Interactive Applications (WSIA) and Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) OASIS Technical Committees. With the approval of WSRP v1 as an OASIS standard in September, 2003, these two technical committees merged and continued the work as the Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) OASIS Technical Committee. Scenarios that motivate WSRP functionality include: * content hosts, such as portal servers, providing portlets as presentation-oriented web services that can be used by aggregation engines; * content aggregators, such as portal servers, consuming presentation-oriented web services provided by portal or non-portal content providers and integrating them into a portal framework. Implementation The WSRP specification does not make any statements as to implementation. Java's portlet specification, JSR 168, and WSRP are not competing technologies. JSR 168 may be used to define a portlet, and WSRP may be used to define a portlet's operations to remote containers. JSR 168 portlets and WSRP may be used together to define a portlet and to provide remote operations. Similarly, .NET portlets may be created for use with WSRP. Interoperability between JSR 168 and .NET WSRP implementations has been demonstrated. There are several WSRP implementations to assist developers: * The Oracle WebCenter provides a standards based implementation of WSRP 1.0 and 2.0 producer and consumers. * The IBM WebSphere Portal provides an implementation of WSRP 1.0 and 2.0 producer and consumers. * Up to version 7.0 the Liferay Portal / DXP provides an implementation of WSRP 1.0 and 2.0 producer and consumers available in both its commercial Enterprise Edition and open source Community Edition. * Microsoft provides a WSRP producer and consumer WebPart for SharePoint 2007, but only a WSRP consumer WebPart for SharePoint 2010 and SharePoint 2013. * The OpenPortal WSRP project's goal is to create a high quality, enterprise- class WSRP v1 and v2 producer and consumer with an associated developer community. * The GateIn Portal project (JBoss & eXo Platform), provides an implementation of both WSRP v1 and v2 (as of GateIn 3.1.0), producer and consumer using GateIn and GateIn Portlet Container. * Apache WSRP4J was an Apache Incubator subproject spearheaded by IBM with the stated goal of \\"kick starting the broad adoption\\" of WSRP. WSRP4J was designed to assist in the development and deployment of WSRP v1 services. WSRP4J was in incubator status, primarily due to patent concerns revolving around the WSRP specification. Given WSRP4J's incubator status, the project did not produce formal releases. The project has been terminated in 2010. The first release, WSRP v1, provided a limited interoperability platform. Further versions of WSRP v1 were abandoned so that effort could be concentrated on WSRP v2. WSRP v2 augments the initial standard with cross-portlet coordination and access management features. This major update to the standard permits a more useful integration of multiple content sources, regardless of whether they are local or remote, into a new web application. In addition, WSRP v2 supports Web 2.0 technologies, such as AJAX and REST, without requiring them. WSRP v2 was approved by OASIS on April 1, 2008.

In radio a dummy antenna is connected to the output of a radio transmitter and electrically simulates an antenna, to allow the transmitter to be adjusted and tested without radiating radio waves. In audio systems, a dummy load is connected to the output of an amplifier to electrically simulate a loudspeaker, allowing the amplifier to be tested without producing sound. Load banks are connected to electrical power supplies to simulate the supply's intended electrical load for testing purposes. Radio Microwave dummy load designed to attach to waveguide. In radio this device is also known as a dummy antenna or a radio frequency termination. It is a device, usually a resistor, used in place of an antenna to aid in testing a radio transmitter. It is substituted for the antenna while adjusting the transmitter, so that no radio waves are radiated ( although, as no dummy load is an ideal dummy load, some radiation will occur.), so that the transmitter does not interfere with other radio transmitters during the adjustments. If a transmitter is tested without a load attached to its output terminals such as an antenna or a dummy load, the power will be reflected back into the transmitter, often overheating and damaging it. Also, if a transmitter is adjusted without a load, it will operate differently as compared with a load, and the adjustments may be incorrect. The dummy load ordinarily should be a pure resistance; the amount of resistance should be the same as the impedance of the antenna or transmission line that is used with the transmitter (usually 50 Œ© or 75 Œ©). The radio energy that is absorbed by the dummy load is converted to heat. A dummy load must be chosen or designed to tolerate the amount of power that can be delivered by the transmitter. Typically it consists of a resistor attached to some type of heat sink to dissipate the power from the transmitter. The ideal dummy load provides a standing wave ratio (SWR) of 1:1 at the given impedance. Veterinarian-grade mineral oil, an inexpensive source for mineral oil, is frequently used by amateur radio operators as coolant in RF dummy loads. Audio Four heavy duty dummy loads used at an amplifier shootout When testing audio amplifiers, it is common to replace the loudspeaker with a dummy load, so that the amplifier's handling of large power levels can be tested without actually producing intense sound. The simplest is a resistor bank to simulate the voice coil's resistance. For loudspeaker simulation, a more complex network is more accurate, however, as actual loudspeakers are reactive and non-linear. There are many designs for loudspeaker simulators, which emphasize different characteristics of the actual speaker, such as the voice coil's inductance, mechanical suspension compliance, and cone mass. Power supplies There are also dummy loads for power supplies, known as load banks. These may be used, for example, for factory and in-service testing of standby generators. A load bank may be used to stabilize a power system in case of loss of load, for example, on an isolated wind or mini-hydro plant. An electronic load (or e-load) is a device or assembly that simulates loading on an electronic circuit. It is used as substitute for a conventional ohmic load resistor. Electronic loads with 800W and 4200W from H√∂cherl & Hackl As counterpart to a current source, the electronic load is a current sink. When loading a current source with a fixed resistor one can set one determined load current by the connected load resistor. The characteristic of the electronic load is that the load current can be set and varied in a defined range. The load current is regulated electronically. The electronic load consumes electric energy and in most cases transforms it into heat. Fans or water-cooled elements are used as coolers. Under certain conditions, energy-recycling into the public power supply system is also possible. Electronic loads are used in diverse applications, particularly for the test of power supplies, batteries, solar and fuel cells, generators. AC loads are used to test transformers, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) or onboard power supplies. The equipment and power spectrum of such electronic loads begins with simplest circuits consisting in general of a potentiometer for current setting and a transistor circuit for power transforming. Further developed electronic loads supply several operating modes, in most cases constant current, voltage, power and resistance. Nowadays, the equipment may be controlled by a PLC or remotely by a PC. Settings and measured values such as input voltage and actual load current are indicated on a display.

The Collector was the first Elder to appear, and featured in Avengers #28 (May 1966), but the idea that he was a member of a group known as the Elders was not introduced until Avengers #174 (August 1978). Fictional history The Elders of the Universe are the last survivors of otherwise extinct races. Each discovered that they had potentially infinite lifespans, dependent on maintaining the will to continue living. They are thus known for their personal obsessions (such as collecting, contests of strategy or strength, and various fields of study), each of which is pursued fanatically. While the characters are not truly cosmic entities, all have achieved some cosmic level of power and knowledge related to their particular pursuit. The first encounter with the heroes of Earth occurs when the Collector came to Earth seeking to expand his collection.Avengers #28 (May 1966). Marvel Comics. Later, the Grandmaster created the supervillain team the Squadron Sinister as pawns to battle the champions of the time-traveling Kang the Conqueror, the superhero team the Avengers.Avengers #69‚Äì71 (Oct.‚ÄìDec. 1969). Marvel COmics. Although thwarted, the Grandmaster and his fellow Elders take an interest in Earth, and the Collector has two separate encounters with the Avengers, the second ending with his murder by the entity Korvac.Avengers #119 (Jan. 1974) and 173‚Äì174 (July‚ÄìAug. 1978). Marvel Comics. The Grandmaster also tricks the entity Death into playing a contest‚Äîagain involving many of Earth's heroes‚Äîthat he deliberately loses to resurrect the Collector.Contest of Champions #1‚Äì3 (June‚ÄìAug. 1982). Marvel Comics. The Grandmaster usurps control of Death's realm, and after a battle between the Avengers and the Grandmaster's champions‚Äîthe Legion of the Unliving‚Äîis tricked by the Avengers. An angered Death then prevents the Elders from ever entering her realm, which effectively makes them immortal and is the Grandmaster's true goal.Avengers Annual #16 (Dec. 1987). Marvel Comics. The Elder known as the Champion of the Universe has a brief encounter with many of Earth's strongest heroes and challenged them to a boxing match. While he did have them use his personal gym to prepare, the Champion of the Universe had to disqualify Namor when he refused to stoop to training and Doc Samson who the Champion declared to not be a worthy opponent. The day of the boxing match came around as the Champion of the Universe faces off against his opponents. After disqualifying Thor, Hulk, and Wonder Man for different reasons and defeating Colossus and Sasquatch in hand-to-hand combat by knockout, he faces Benjamin Grimm of the Fantastic Four. Eventually realizing that the outmatched Grimm will never submit under any circumstances, the Champion concedes the match and offers Grimm his respect.Marvel Two-In-One Annual #7 (Jan. 1982). Marvel Comics. A group of eleven Elders later join forces and meet on Ego the Living Planet (who is also regarded as an Elder) in an effort to kill the cosmic entity Galactus, which would cause the concepts Eternity and Death to become unbalanced and end the universe. The Elders believe since they are now immortal they would be the only beings in the universe to survive and would be supreme beings in the new universe. The plan, however, is thwarted by Galactus' Heralds the Silver Surfer and Nova. Galactus captures and consumes five of the Elders (Champion, Collector, Gardener, Grandmaster and Runner), but three other Elders (Astronomer, Possessor and Trader) are sucked into a black hole and pass through it into a mystical universe. Two Elders avoid the wrath of Galactus and his hunger, The Contemplater and the Obliterator. Both meet with each other being seemingly the last known surviving Elders and plot their revenge against the universe.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #1‚Äì10 (July 1987‚ÄìApr. 1988). Marvel Comics. Despite this setback, the eight Elders continue their plot against Galactus. While the five Elders within Galactus inflict a fatal case of \\"cosmic indigestion\\" upon him, the three Elders in the mystical realm conspire with the cosmic entity the In-Betweener to restore him in exchange for him returning them to their home reality and his promise to kill Galactus. Using the Silver Surfer, Mister Fantastic, and the Invisible Woman (whom Galactus had sent in search of the Infinity Gems), the In-Betweener is restored and he brings the Elders back to their own reality. Once there, the In-Betweener attempts to kill Galactus but discovers that he cannot do so. When he announces his intention to hurl Galactus into the black hole instead, the three Elders, who wanted to rescue their brother Elders from within Galactus, threaten him with the other five Infinity Gems to stop him. The In- Betweener responds by summoning Death and forcing her to negate them despite her vow. As a result, the Astronomer, the Trader and the Possessor and his Runestaff are apparently disintegrated. The ship carrying Galactus is then thrown into the black hole and passes through to the mystical realm where the In-Betweeners's creators, Master Order and Lord Chaos, force the five Elders within Galactus to exit his body, restoring the world-devourer. During the subsequent battle between Galactus and the In-Betweener, the quintet are eventually persuaded to help Galactus defeat his foe.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #15‚Äì18 (Sept.‚ÄìDec. 1988). Marvel Comics. Moments later, the five Elders use their Infinity Gems to instantaneously travel very far away from Galactus and his vengeance.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #19 (Jan. 1989). Marvel Comics. Another Elder, the Contemplator, allies with the space-pirate Captain Reptyl against the Silver Surfer, but is betrayed and apparently killed.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #12 (June 1988). Marvel Comics. The Contemplator is revealed to have survived‚Äîas a disembodied head‚Äîand goes on to attempt to rule the Kree Empire, but is seemingly destroyed by the peace-loving alien Cotati.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #20 (Feb. 1989); 25‚Äì27 (July‚ÄìSep. 1989) and 29‚Äì31 (Nov.‚ÄìDec. 1989). Marvel Comics. The five Elders that were previously consumed by Galactus (Champion, Collector, Gardener, Grandmaster, and Runner) are targeted by the Titan Thanos because they possess the Infinity Gems. The character humiliates each in turn (the Gardener is murdered) and captures the Gems.Thanos Quest #1‚Äì2 (Sep.‚ÄìOct. 1990). Marvel Comics. The Elder the Runner has an encounter with the hero Quasar during which the time being Eon describes the Runner as one of \\"the thousand or so Elders I'm aware of.\\"Quasar #17 (Dec. 1990). Marvel Comics. Quasar also later confronts the Obliterator, the Possessor, and previously unknown Elders the Explorer, the Judicator and the Caregiver. It is also revealed that the Contemplator killed by Reptyl was in fact a Skrull, and not the true Contemplator.Quasar #47‚Äì48 (Jun.‚ÄìJul. 1993). Marvel Comics. The Grandmaster reappears and creates a new version of the Squadron Sinister. Courtesy of a phenomenon known as the Wellspring of Power‚Äîan interdimensional source of superhuman abilities‚Äîthe Grandmaster increases the Squadron Sinister's powers and they battle the superhero team the New Thunderbolts. The Grandmaster is defeated by Baron Helmut Zemo, and the Squadron Sinister scatter and escape.New Thunderbolts #15‚Äì16 (Jan.‚ÄìFeb. 2006). Marvel Comics.Thunderbolts #102‚Äì108 (July 2006‚ÄìJan. 2007). Marvel Comics. Champion has an encounter with the heroine She-Hulk and aids her foe Titania by giving her the Power Gem, currently in his possession.She-Hulk vol. 3, #7‚Äì12 (Nov. 2004‚ÄìApr. 2005). Marvel Comics. The Astronomer, Champion, Grandmaster, Judicator, and Runner traveled to the planet Godthab Omega, and witnessed the arrival of the Annihilation Wave.Annihilation: Ronan #3 (August 2006). Marvel Comics. After Battleworld is destroyed at the conclusion of \\"Secret Wars,\\" the Elders examine the planet's remains, and find them to be teeming with Power Primordial in the form of an \\"Iso-Sphere\\". Their inability to come to a mutually beneficial agreement regarding ownership of the Iso-Sphere prompts the Elders into holding a winner-takes-all Contest of Champions which all but the Grandmaster and Collector are eventually eliminated from. During the \\"No Surrender\\" arc, it was revealed that one Elder of the Universe originally went by the name of Grandmaster before being defeated by En Dwi-Gast and banished from the Earth-616 reality. Because of the Multiverse being rebuilt, this Elder of the Universe returned where he took the name of Challenger and assembled his version of the Black Order to go up against Grandmaster and his Lethal Legion.Avengers #679. Marvel Comics. The \\"Empyre\\" storyline introduced an Elder of the Universe called the Profiteer.Empyre: Fantastic Four #0. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities Each Elder of the Universe possesses a fraction of what is referred to as the Power Primordial, remnants of the primordial energies of the Big Bang that still permeate the universe.Silver Surfer vol. 3, #5 (Nov. 1987). Marvel Comics. The Power Primordial can be used to produce a wide range of effects, including augmentation of physical attributes (strength, durability, speed), molecular restructuring, creation of force fields, teleportation and numerous other abilities. Some Elders have incorporated this power into their singular obsessions and developed its potential in themselves (i.e. Champion, Runner) while others have to varying degrees mixed that power with tools or resources their obsessions afforded them (i.e. Contemplator, Grandmaster, Obliterator) or even largely ignored it as irrelevant or detrimental to their pursuits (i.e. Gardener, Collector). Each Elder has developed skills related to their particular field of interest over a lifespan measured in billions of years. In their particular fields of endeavor (i.e. Grandmaster in strategy, Caregiver in medicine), they have essentially unrivaled superhuman levels of talent and expertise.

Nelson was dissatisfied with his performance, and insulted him in front of witnesses. A few days later, Davis demanded a public apology, but instead the two officers argued noisily and physically, concluding in Davis mortally wounding Nelson with a pistol. Davis avoided conviction, due to the shortage of experienced commanders in the Union Army, but the incident hampered his chances for promotion. He served as a corps commander under William Tecumseh Sherman during his March to the Sea in 1864. After the war, Davis was the first commander of the Department of Alaska from 1867 to 1870, and assumed field command during the Modoc War of 1872‚Äì1873. Early life Marker denoting Davis' birth near Memphis, Indiana Davis was born in Clark County, Indiana, near present-day Memphis, Indiana.Jefferson Columbus Davis Collection, Rare Books and Manuscripts, Indiana State Library He was born to William Davis, Jr. (1800‚Äì1879) and Mary Drummond-Davis (1801‚Äì1881), the oldest of their eight children. His father was a farmer. His parents came from Kentucky, and like many of the time including President Abraham Lincoln's family, moved to Indiana. Early military career When Davis was 19 years old, in June 1847, he joined the 3rd Indiana Volunteers. He enlisted as a soldier during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Through the war, he received promotions through the rank of sergeant. He received a commission as a second lieutenant, in the First U.S. Artillery, in June 1848. He received the promotion for bravery at Buena Vista. He joined the 1st Artillery in October 1848 at Fort McHenry, outside of Baltimore, Maryland. He later moved south to Fort Washington, Maryland, just outside Washington DC, and again to the coast of Mississippi. He was promoted again to first lieutenant in February 1852 and was transferred to Florida in 1853 and on to Fortress Monroe in Virginia. In 1857, he was stationed again in Fort McHenry moving to Florida in 1858. In the summer of 1858, he received a transfer to Fort Moultrie, South Carolina. Fort Moultrie was located near Fort Sumter and Charleston, South Carolina. He remained in South Carolina until Fort Sumter was evacuated at the beginning of the Civil War, in 1861. Civil War When the war began in April 1861, Davis was an officer in the garrison at Fort Sumter when it was bombarded by Confederate forces. The following month he was promoted to captain and given the task of raising a regiment in Indiana. Additionally, he was given responsibility over the commissary and supply. He requested assignment as a regimental commander, growing bored with his garrison duties. After the death of Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon and the loss at Wilson's Creek, his request was gratefully accepted. His experience as a regular in the federal army made him a rare commodity, and he was given command of the 22nd Indiana Infantry, receiving a promotion to colonel. Missouri By the end of August, Davis received orders to succeed Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant as commander of forces in northwestern Missouri. His headquarters were in Jefferson City, Missouri, with approximately 16,000 Confederate troops nearby. General Fremont had great concerns that the Confederate troops, commanded by Generals McCullough and Sterling Price, would set their eyes on St. Louis as a potential target. Davis's command grew quickly, starting at 12,000 at the beginning of September and expanding to 18,000 to 20,000 by the end of the month. Initially, Davis spent time building fortifications to fend off possible attack on the capital city. Once his defensive plan had been completed, he planned an offensive campaign, but materiel was refused to Davis. That may have contributed to losing the Battle of Lexington. In December 1861, he took command of the 3rd Division, Army of the Southwest. He pursued Confederate troops through southern Missouri, as they retreated toward and into Arkansas. In March 1862, his division attacked the Confederates at the Battle of Pea Ridge. Davis's distinguished service at Pea Ridge was rewarded in May 1862, and he received a field promotion commensurate with his command of a Division Commander, brevetted to Brigadier General. At the Siege of Corinth, he commanded the 4th Division, Army of the Mississippi. Leave authorized In the late summer of 1862, Davis became ill, probably caused by exhaustion. He wrote to his commander, General Rosecrans, requesting a few weeks' leave. Davis stated, \\"After twenty-one months of arduous service.... I find myself compelled by physical weakness and exhaustion to ask... for a few weeks' respite from duty....\\" On August 12, 1862, the Army of Mississippi issued General Rosecrans' response in Special Order No. 208, authorizing General Davis 20 days of convalescence. Davis headed for home in Indiana to rest and recuperate. While Davis was on leave, the state of affairs in Kentucky became quite precarious. The Army of the Ohio, commanded by Brigadier General Don Carlos Buell, was taking aim on Chattanooga, Tennessee. Three hundred miles of railway lines lay between Louisville and Chattanooga, and Confederate forces were making constant work tearing up the tracks. The railroads provided the needed supplies to Union troops on the move and so Buell was forced to split his forces and to send General William \\"Bull\\" Nelson back north to Kentucky to take charge of the area. When Nelson arrived in Louisville, he found Major General Horatio G. Wright had been sent by the President to take control, putting Buell second in command. In late August, two Confederate armies, under the command of Major General Edmund Kirby Smith and General Braxton Bragg, moved into Kentucky and Tennessee on the offensive to drive Union forces from Kentucky. Smith's Army of East Tennessee had approximately 19,000 men and Bragg's Army of Tennessee had approximately 35,000. On August 23, 1862, Confederate cavalry met and defeated Union troops at the Battle of Big Hill. That was only a prelude to the bigger battle ahead; on August 29, 1862, portions of Smith's army met an equal portion of Nelson's force that numbered between 6,000 and 7,000. The two-day Battle of Richmond, ending on August 30, was an overwhelming Confederate victory in all aspects: Union casualties numbered over 5,000, compared to the 750 Confederate casualties, and considerable ground was lost, including Richmond; Lexington; and the state capital, Frankfort. Further loss at the battle occurred with the capture of Brigadier General Mahlon D. Manson and the wounding of General Nelson, injured in the neck, who was forced to retreat back to Louisville to prepare for the presumed assault. The Confederates were now in a position to aim northward to take the fight to the enemy. Louisville Davis was quite aware of the circumstances in the neighboring state to the south; Smith was able to strike at Cincinnati, Ohio, Bragg and/or Smith at Louisville. Davis, still on convalescence, reported to General Wright, whose headquarters were in Cincinnati to offer his services. Wright ordered Davis to report to Nelson. In Louisville, Davis was put in charge of organizing and arming its citizens, preparing for its defense. Nelson was quite an imposing figure over Davis. William Nelson got his nickname, \\"Bull,\\" in no small part to his stature. Nelson was 300 pounds and six feet two inches and was described as being \\"in the prime of life, in perfect health.\\" Davis was quite small in comparison, measuring five feet nine inches and reportedly only 125 pounds. =Dismissal from Louisville= right In September 22, two days after Davis received his initial orders from Nelson, he was summoned to the Galt House, where Nelson had made his headquarters. Nelson inquired on how the recruitment was going and how many men had been mustered. Davis replied that he did not know. As Nelson asked his questions and received only short answers that Davis was unaware of any specifics, Nelson became enraged and expelled Davis from Louisville. General James Barnet Fry, described as a close friend of Davis, was present and later of the events surrounding the death of Nelson. Fry states: > Davis arose and remarked, in a cool, deliberate manner: \\"General Nelson, I > am a regular soldier, and I demand the treatment due to me as a general > officer.\\" Davis then stepped across to the door of the Medical Director's > room, both doors being open... and said: \\"Dr Irwin, I wish you to be a > witness to this conversation.\\" At the same time Nelson said: \\"Yes, doctor, I > want you to remember this.\\" Davis then said to Nelson: \\"I demand from you > the courtesy due to my rank.\\" Nelson replied: \\"I will treat you as you > deserve. You have disappointed me; you have been unfaithful to the trust > which I reposed in you, and I shall relieve you at once. You are relieved > from duty here and you will proceed to Cincinnati and report to General > Wright.\\" Davis said: \\"You have no authority to order me.\\" Nelson turned > toward the Adjutant-General and said: \\"Captain, if General Davis does not > leave the city by nine o'clock tonight, give instructions to the Provost- > Marshal to see that he shall be put across the Ohio River.\\" =Reassigned to Louisville= Davis made his way to Cincinnati and reported to General Wright within a few days. Within the same week, Buell returned to Louisville and took command from Nelson. Wright then felt that with Buell in command at Louisville, there was no need to keep Davis from Louisville, where his leadership was desperately needed and so sent Davis back to there. Davis arrived in Louisville in the afternoon on Sunday, September 28, and reported to the Galt House early the next morning, at breakfast time. The Galt House continued to serve as the command's headquarters for both Buell and Nelson. That, like on most other mornings, was the meeting place for many of the most prominent military and civil leaders. When Davis arrived and looked around the room, he saw many familiar faces and joined Oliver P. Morton, Indiana's governor. =Killing of Nelson= Union General Jefferson C. Davis at the Galt House in Louisville, Kentucky, on September 29, 1862 A short time later, General Nelson entered the hotel and went to the front desk. Davis approached Nelson, asking for an apology for the offense that Nelson had previously made. Nelson dismissed Davis and said, \\"Go away you damned puppy, I don't want anything to do with you!\\" Davis took in his hand a registration card and, while he confronted Nelson, took his anger out on the card, first by gripping it and then by wadding it up into a small ball, which he took and flipped into Nelson's face. Nelson stepped forward and slapped Davis with the back of his hand in the face. Nelson then looked at the governor and asked, \\"Did you come here, sir, to see me insulted?\\" Morton said, \\"No sir.\\" Then, Nelson turned and left for his room. That set the events in motion. Davis asked a friend from the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War if he had a pistol, which he did not. He then asked another friend, Thomas W. Gibson, from whom he got a pistol. Immediately, Davis went down the corridor towards Nelson's office, where he was now standing. He aimed the pistol at Nelson and fired. The bullet hit Nelson in the chest and tore a small hole in the heart, mortally wounding the large man. Nelson still had the strength to make his way to the hotel stairs and to climb a floor before he collapsed. By then, a crowd started to gather around him and carried Nelson to a nearby room, laying him on the floor. The hotel proprietor, Silas F. Miller, came rushing into the room to find Nelson lying on the floor. Nelson asked of Miller, \\"Send for a clergyman; I wish to be baptized. I have been basely murdered.\\" Reverend J. Talbot was called, who responded, as well as a doctor. Several people came to see Nelson, including Reverend Talbot, Surgeon Murry, General Crittenden and General Fry. The shooting had occurred at 8:00 am, and by 8:30, Nelson was dead. =Arrest and release= Davis did not leave the vicinity of Nelson. He did not run or evade capture. He was simply taken into military custody by Fry and confined to an upper room in the Galt House. Davis attested to Fry what had happened. Fry wrote that while Davis was improperly treated for a man of his rank, Davis never pursued any legal recourse, which there was available to him. Fry attested that Davis was quite forthcoming and even included the fact that it was he who flipped a paper-wad in the face of Nelson. Davis wanted to confront Nelson publicly and wanted Nelson's disrespect to be witnessed. What Davis had not accounted for was Nelson's physical assault. Everything then spiraled out of control. Many in close confidence with Nelson wanted to see quick justice with regards to Davis. There were even a few, including General William Terrill, who wanted to see Davis hanged on the spot. Even Buell weighed in by saying that Davis' conduct was inexcusable. Fry stated that Buell regarded the actions as \\"a gross violation of military discipline.\\" Buell went on to telegraph General Henry Halleck, General in Chief of all Armies: It was Major General Horatio G. Wright who came to Davis's aid by securing his release and returning him to duty. Davis avoided conviction for the murder because there was a need for experienced field commanders in the Union Army. Fry stated in his journal of Wright's comments, > Davis appealed to me, and I notified him that he should no longer consider > himself in arrest.... I was satisfied that Davis acted purely on the > defensive in the unfortunate affair, and I presumed that Buell held very > similar views, as he took no action in the matter after placing him in > arrest. Davis was released from custody on October 13, 1862. Military regulations required charges to be formally made against the accused within 45 days of the arrest. The charges never came possibly because larger events, such as the launching of Buell's campaign in Kentucky five days later, overshadowed the Davis-Nelson affair. =Aftermath= There was no trial or any significant confinement since it appears that Davis was staying at the Galt House without guard, as based partly on Wright's statement. Davis simply walked away and returned to duty as if nothing had ever happened. Western Campaign Gen. Davis (behind General William T. Sherman, with hand in coat) with the staff of Sherman Davis was a capable commander, but because of the murder of Nelson, he never received a full promotion higher than brigadier general of volunteers. He, however, received a brevet promotion to major general of volunteers on August 8, 1864 for his service at the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, and he was appointed commanding officer of the XIV Corps during the Atlanta Campaign, which he retained until the end of the war. He received a brevet promotion to brigadier general in the regular army on March 20, 1865. During Sherman's March to the Sea, Davis's actions during the Ebenezer Creek passing and ruthlessness toward former slaves have caused his legacy to be clouded in continued controversy. As Sherman's army proceeded toward Savannah, Georgia, on December 9, 1864, Davis ordered a pontoon bridge removed before the African-American refugees, who were following his corps, could cross the creek. Several hundred were captured by the Confederate cavalry or drowned in the creek while they attempted to escape. Postbellum career Department of Alaska After the Civil War, Davis continued service with the army, becoming colonel of the 23rd Infantry Regiment in July 1866. He was the first commander of the Department of Alaska and establish led a fort at Sitka on October 29, 1867. from March 18, 1868, to June 1, 1870. He ordered Russian residents of Sitka, Alaska, to leave their homes since he maintained that they were needed for Americans. Modoc War Davis gained fame when he assumed command of the US forces in California and Oregon during the Modoc War of 1872‚Äì1873, after General Edward Canby and Reverend Eleazer Thomas had been assassinated during peace talks. Davis's presence in the field restored the soldiers' confidence after their recent setbacks against the Modoc. Davis's campaign resulted in the Battle of Dry Lake (May 10, 1873) and the eventual surrender of notable leaders, such as Hooker Jim and Captain Jack. 1877 general strike During the 1877 St. Louis general strike, Davis arrived in St. Louis, commanding 300 men and two Gatling guns, to crush the strikers who controlled the city (the St. Louis Commune) for several days. Death Davis died in Chicago, Illinois, on November 30, 1879. He is buried in Crown Hill Cemetery, Indianapolis, Indiana.

Biography  Jules was born in Paris. Marie Belloc Lowndes, in the second volume of her autobiography Where Love and Friendship Dwelt (1943), made claims regarding his paternity. He was reportedly ashamed of and did not talk about it. Lowndes did not say who his mother was. In his early years he worked for the Ministry of Finance (1825‚Äì1828), and was an active journalist. From 1826 to 1830 he opposed the policies of Charles X of France in Le Globe. At the revolution of 1830 he signed the protestation of the journalists on 28 July 1830. After 1830, he contributed to different newspapers, Le Constitutionnel, Le National and Le Courrier fran√ßais until 1833, when he gave up politics in order to devote himself to the history of ancient philosophy, undertaking a translation of Aristotle, which occupied him the greater part of his life. The reputation he gained from this work won him the chair of ancient philosophy at the Coll√®ge de France (1838) and a seat at the Academy of Moral and Political Science (1839). After the revolution of 1848 he was elected as a republican deputy from the d√©partement of Seine-et-Oise. He was named by the Minister of Public Instruction, Carnot, head of the commission preparing the draft for the education reforms. However, after Carnot's resignation and replacement by Alfred de Falloux, the commission was dissolved. Nevertheless, Barth√©l√©my- Saint-Hilaire deposed to the National Assembly the report and the propositions written by the commission, which were ignored. After the May 1849 legislative election, won by the conservative Parti de l'Ordre, he was however re-elected and named again as a member of the parliamentary commission on education. During three years, he thus played an important role during the debates leading to the adoption of the Falloux Laws in 1850‚Äì1851, which greatly increased the clergy's influence on education, to the dismay of Republicans such as Saint-Hilaire. He was obliged to withdraw after the December 1851 coup d'√©tat of Louis Napoleon. In 1855 he went as member of the international commission to Egypt to report on the possibility of the proposed Suez canal, and by the articles which he wrote he contributed largely to making the project popular in France. Elected deputy again in 1869, he joined the opposition to the Second Empire, and in 1871, as a member of the Centre gauche parliamentary group, bent all his efforts to the election of Thiers as President of the Republic, acting afterwards as his secretary. Appointed senator for life in 1875, he took his place among the moderate republicans (aka Opportunist Republicans), and from 23 September 1880 to 14 November 1881 was minister of foreign affairs in the cabinet of Jules Ferry. The most important event of his administration was the annexation of Tunis under the form of a French protectorate, which he actively promoted. In 1882 the village of St. Hilaire, Minnesota, in the United States, was named in his honor.Upham, Warren (2001). Minnesota Place Names, A Geographical Encyclopedia, Third Edition. MHS Press (), pp. 436-437. He died in Paris in 1895. His principal works, besides the translation of Aristotle and a number of studies connected with the same subject, are Des V√©das (1854), Du Bouddhisme (1856) and Mahomet et le Coran (1865).

Bush (born August 24, 1963) is an American heavy metal vocalist and songwriter. He came to prominence in the 1980s as the lead singer and lyricist of Armored Saint, a traditional heavy metal band from Los Angeles, California. In 1992, he joined the thrash metal band Anthrax, with whom he remained until 2005 and briefly rejoined in 2009‚Äì2010. Bush has also been active with the reformed Armored Saint intermittently from 1999 to the present. Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic praised Bush's \\"remarkable voice\\" while authors Howie Abrams and Sacha Jenkins ranked him as the eighth best vocalist in the genre.Erik Piepenburg (March 29, 2013) [Who Are the Best Voices in the History of Metal?] New York Times Blog, accessed 11 July 2019 Career They started at Wilson High School, Los Angeles (auditorium) in 1979. In 1984 John had a cameo appearance in the Huey Lewis and the News video \\"The Heart of Rock & Roll\\" at the 1:38 mark (exiting from the limo). 1982‚Äì1992, 1999‚Äìpresent: Armored Saint Bush with Armored Saint in 2006 Since their formation in 1982, Armored Saint has released six full-length albums, one EP, a live album, a greatest hits compilation and two DVDs, all with John Bush on vocals. In the early 1980s, Bush was invited by Metallica to join them as lead singer. Even after the release of Kill 'Em All, Metallica vocalist James Hetfield felt unsure about his singing abilities. Hetfield wanted to concentrate on his guitar and personally asked John Bush to join Metallica. Bush was the only vocalist that the band considered as a potential frontman. He turned down the offer as he wanted to stay with Armored Saint. Bush states that part of his loyalty to Armored Saint came from the band being made up of his closest childhood friends. In 1990, original Armored Saint guitarist Dave Prichard died of leukemia during the recording of Symbol of Salvation. Jeff Duncan replaced Prichard and the band finished the recording of Symbol of Salvation, going out on tour afterwards. Despite rave reviews from the metal press, the band decided that they just didn't want to continue without Prichard, and amicably disbanded. In 1999, whilst Bush was a member of Anthrax, Bush got together with Armored Saint bassist Joey Vera. Together they decided to bring back the Symbol of Salvation lineup for an Armored Saint reunion. The resultant album Revelation was released in 2000 and a short tour followed. The following year, Armored Saint released a collection of demos, live tracks and other rarities in the two disc package Nod to the Old School. They have since released two more studio albums, La Raza in 2010, and Win Hands Down in 2015. 1992‚Äì2005, 2009‚Äì2010: Anthrax Following the 1992 dissolution of Armored Saint, Bush received a call from Scott Ian of Anthrax, who offered Bush the chance to fill the spot left behind by singer Joey Belladonna, who had been fired from the band. Bush accepted and joined the band, adding alternative rock sensibilities. Anthrax recorded Sound of White Noise, Stomp 442, & Volume 8: The Threat Is Real with Bush in the 90s before entering a temporary hiatus during 1999. Despite Bush's reunion with Armored Saint during that same year, Bush remained a member of Anthrax. Returning to the band, Bush recorded vocals for his fourth album with the band, the critically acclaimed We've Come for You All in 2003. The successful WCFYA tour was documented with a live album/DVD titled Music of Mass Destruction. In 2004, Anthrax released The Greater of Two Evils, a re-recording of several of the band's more popular songs from the pre-Bush era with the then-current lineup. In early 2005, Anthrax issued a press release stating that the band's Among the Living lineup was reuniting. Anthrax stated that Bush had not been fired, but with Joey Belladonna's return and talk of a new album in the works, it was unclear if Bush would record with them again. However, Joey Belladonna's exit from Anthrax in January 2007 fueled reports that Bush would return. However, Anthrax chose to recruit a new vocalist, Dan Nelson. In June 2007, John Bush stated during an interview that he was not bitter about the split with Anthrax, revealing that they had asked him to take part in the reunion tour, which would have seen him and Belladonna splitting vocal duties, but that he turned it down because \\"it just wasn't right\\" for him. He was later approached again by the band to re-join following Belladonna's exit, which he again turned down, explaining: \\"I couldn't go back and say, 'Here I am...' It would be like coming in with my tail between my legs, and that's not right for me. I just couldn't do that. It just didn't feel right to do that. It was about soul, your gut. How does that feel? Does it feel right? Good enough. Sold. Answer.\\" In August 2009, after Anthrax parted ways with their replacement singer Dan Nelson, Bush rejoined his former bandmates in Anthrax for a live performance on August 1, 2009, at the Sonisphere Festival in Knebworth, England. Following this performance, there were many calls for him to return full-time. John Bush also performed with Anthrax at the Loud Park '09 Festival in Japan on October 17, 2009, followed by five concerts on the Soundwave tour in Australia in February 2010. On December 14, 2009, it was announced that the \\"Big Four\\" Thrash bands would play in Poland and Czech Republic during the following year, among several other shows during the Sonisphere festival. It was expected that Anthrax would continue with Bush, but the other members ultimately chose to reunite with Joey Belladonna, as Bush was not up for recommitting to the group full-time. The band has since toured and recorded again with Joey Belladonna.

Dan Spitz has an issue with the band [...] he feels like he hasn't been paid by the band. And the dude made seven records with Anthrax.

The name \\"Washoe\\" or \\"Washo\\" (as preferred by themselves) is derived from the autonym Waashiw (wa¬∑≈°iw or w√°:≈°iw) in the Washo language or from Wa≈°i≈°iw (wa≈°√≠:≈°iw), the plural form of wa≈°iw. Territory Washoe people have lived in the Great Basin and the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains for at least the last 6,000 years,Pritzker 246 some say up to 9,000 years. Prior to contact with Europeans, the territory of the Washoe people centered around Lake Tahoe (; Washo: d√° îaw / da îaw / Da ow ‚Äì \\"the lake\\"; or dew î√°:ga îa /daw îa:ga îa / Da ow aga ‚Äì \\"edge of the lake\\") and was roughly bounded by the southern shore of Honey Lake in the north, the West Walker River, Topaz Lake, and Sonora Pass in the south, the Sierra Nevada crest in the west, and the Pine Nut Mountains and Virginia Range in the east. Beside Lake Tahoe the Washoe utilized the upper ranges of the Carson (d√°:bal k'il√° îam), Truckee (dabay√≥duwe î), and West Walker rivers to the east as well the Sierra Valley (a site of extensive freshwater marshes filled with cattails, bulrushes and alkaline flats that drain into the Middle Fork Feather River) to the north. The Washoe would generally spend the summer in the Sierra Nevada, especially at Lake Tahoe; the fall in the ranges to the east; and the winter and spring in the valleys between them. Washoe Lake (c'√≥ îya î d√° îaw) was named after them. The Washoe/Washo were loosely organized into three (in some sources four) regional groups speaking slightly different dialects, which in turn were divided in groups (cooperating extending families for the seasonal hunt and living together in winter camps) and in nuclear families. The regional group was determined by where people had a winter camp: * Welmelti (\\"Northerners\\" or \\"Northern Washoe People\\") * Pauwalu / Powalu (\\"Easterners\\" or \\"Central Washoe People\\") * Hungalelti (\\"Southerners\\" or \\"Southern Washoe People\\") and, * Tanalelti (\\"Westerners\\" or \\"Western Washoe People\\") Since the western part of the Washo territory was in the mountains and subject to heavy snows, few people wintered there so very few were organized into the western group. History Washoe woman Washoe people are the only Great Basin tribe whose language is not Numic, so they are believed to have inhabited the region prior to neighboring tribes. The Kings Beach Complex that emerged about 500 CE around Lake Tahoe and the northern Sierra Nevadas are regarded as early Washoe culture. The Martis complex may have overlapped with the Kings Beach culture, and Martis pit houses gave way to conical bark slab houses of historic Washoe culture.D'Azevedo 466 The Washoe people and the neighboring Northern Paiute people were culturally and linguistically very different, and these two tribes were sometimes in conflict. Washoe people may have made contact with Spanish explorers in the early 19th century, but the Washoe did not sustain contact with people of European culture until the 1848 California Gold Rush. Washoe resistance to incursions on their lands proved futile, and the last armed conflict with the Washoes and non-Indians was the Potato War of 1857, when starving Washoes were killed for gathering potatoes from a European-American farm near Honey Lake in California.D'Azevedo 494 Loss of the valley hunting grounds to farms and the pi√±on pine groves to feed Virginia City's demand for lumber and charcoal drove most Washoe to dependency on jobs on white ranches and farms and in cities. The areas where they settled became known as Indian colonies. Culture Louisa Keyser (Dat So La Lee), Washoe basketweaver Pi√±on pine nuts gathered in the fall provided much of the food eaten in the winter. Roots, seeds, berries and game provided much of the food eaten during the rest of the year. The Washoe people were also deeply knowledgeable about their land and where resources were plentiful. This included an understanding of the seasonal cycles of both plants and animals. Wa≈°iw people were also dependent on fishing at Lake Tahoe and the surrounding streams. Fishing was a huge part of Wa≈°iw life; and each family had its own fishing grounds, until contact with Western civilization led to commercial fishing in the area, destroying another important resource for the Wa≈°iw.Dangberg 1968, d'Azevedo 1986, Nevers 1976 The Pine Nut Dance and girls' puberty rites remain very important ceremonies.Pritzker, 246, 248 The Wa≈°iw people once relied on medicine men and their innate knowledge of medicinal plants and ceremonies. Much of this knowledge and activity has been lost due to contact with the Western world. Washoe culture was based mostly on the legends that carried the explanation of different areas of life. The legends were handed over from one generation to another by storytelling and were told to younger generations to teach them basic things about Washoe's way of living. Children could get to know about gathering techniques, medicine preparation, and the legends were meant to teach them how to appreciate the land they were living in and give them a better understanding of Washoe's lifestyle. Children were raised in the environment which recognized family as the most valued thing. The whole Washoe life was concentrated on cooperation and unity, and older tribe members needed to convey their knowledge to the younger so the tribe culture would survive. Everyone in the family had his own role in everyday activities like fishing, gathering or hunting which helped Washoe people with doing everyday life tasks more efficiently.  Life cycle  The area of residence of Washoe people let them obtain food from three different ways: fishing, gathering, and hunting. Since each way required having special skills and knowledge people were usually trained in one field to reduce the possibility of failing the tasks they were responsible for. Therefore, the Washoe tribe's life was dependent on the actual environment possibilities. Also, scarcity of sources would not let the tribe perform every way at once, therefore the Washoe lifestyle was divided into three periods: \\"the fishing year\\", \\"the gathering year\\" and \\"the hunting year\\". * \\"Fishing year\\" ‚Äì which came after the period of starvation, started in early spring as the snow in the mountains started to melt. At that time, some tribe members (mainly young men, boys, and sometimes unmarried women) left the winter camps and moved toward the Lake Tahoe to start the fishing season. By doing this they could save the leftovers from food reserves for people that had stayed in winter camps. They used caves and natural shelters as protection from the cold along with loin clothes and blankets made from rabbit skin to keep themselves warm. They fished for whitefish which some of them they consumed and some they carried back to winter camps so their folks could eat and gather strength for the return trip to the lake, which happened when it got warmer. It was the family's decision when to leave the winter camps and go to Lake Tahoe and it depended on the condition and age of family members (family with infants or older people tend to leave the camps later than fitter members of the tribe. The whole Washoe tribe should have been returned to the Lake Tahoe shores by the beginning of June. Almost every tribe member was involved in fishing when the season came. The Washoe used the lake resources to the fullest and caught as many fish they could. They had learned how to preserve the fish drying it on the sun and made the food reserves for the future. * \\"Gathering year\\" ‚Äì could have been performed all year, but different ways of acquiring were used and the different type and amounts of food were provided. During winter the Washoe ate mostly the food they had gathered before the winter season started because very little vegetables could be found. As the spring came, more and more food became available. However, the food was limited over the place it was found and it could only feed a certain number of people, so tribe split up in smaller groups and went to look for food in different ways. The gathering was usually performed by women while men practiced fishing at the lake or hunting. * \\"Hunting year\\" ‚Äì started when the first animals appeared at the beginning of the spring. It was only men's activity, so boys were trained from the youngest age. The Washoe tribe hunt for bigger animals like deer, bears or antelope as well as smaller ones: rabbits, birds, squirrels. The different techniques and times of hunting were adjusted for different types of animals. Fall was the richest in food season of the year as all ways of obtaining the food could have been performed. The winter period was the time of starvation as the stocks of food run out quickly and almost no food could have been obtained over the coldest months of the year. However, Washoe people learned how to survive the hardest time of the year by learning how to use the resources the land had given them. They knew they needed to keep the balance as each way of obtaining food was equally crucial for these people to survive. Language The Washoe / Wa≈°iw language or W√°:≈°iw  î√≠tlu (today: Wa≈°iw Wagayay) has been regarded as a language isolate,\\"Washoe Indian Tribe History.\\" Access Genealogy. Retrieved 11 May 2010. However, it is sometimes tentatively regarded as part of the controversial Hokan language family.Pritzker 220 The language is written in the Latin script. The Wa≈°iw language is now considered a moribund language as only a handful of fluent elder speakers use the language. There has been a recent revival of the language and culture within the Tribe. \\"Wa≈°iw Wagayay Ma≈ãal\\" (the \\"house where Wa≈°iw is spoken\\") was the first attempt by the Wa≈°iw people to renew their language for the future generations. The tribe currently relies on the tribal Cultural Resource Department to provide language classes to the community. However, there has recently been a pedagogical shift within the tribe, and the youth have become the focal point of language and culture programs.  Washoe Tribe and Lake Tahoe  The Washoe people are considered to be the indigenous inhabitants of Lake Tahoe area, occupying the lake and surround lands for thousands of years. As the native inhabitants, they believe that they have the best knowledge of how the land should be maintained, and consider themselves to be the proper caretakers of the Lake Tahoe area, which has been a center Washoe tribes yearly cultural gatherings, where most traditional events took place. In 2002, The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources officially granted custody to the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California over the land around the Lake Tahoe area for cultural purposes.

The colony in Reno, Nevada, which also had a substantial Paiute and Shoshoni population, gained separate recognition as the Reno‚ÄìSparks Indian Colony. There is evidence that some Washoe settled in the southwest region of Montana.

When Wolfensohn took over at the World Bank in 1995, he viewed himself as a spiritual successor to a former World Bank chief, Robert McNamara. He was born in Sydney, Australia, and is a graduate of the University of Sydney and Harvard Business School; he was also an Olympic fencer. He worked for various companies in Britain and the United States before forming his own investment firm.

He served two terms as President of the World Bank on the nomination of U.S. President Bill Clinton, and has since held various positions with charitable organisations. Early life and education Wolfensohn was born on 1 December 1933 in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. His father Hyman (known as Bill) was born in London to Austrian- Jewish immigrants, while his mother Dora was born in Belgium to Polish parents. His father was a \\"highly intelligent but failed businessman\\" who had previously worked for the Rothschild banking family. Wolfensohn's parents arrived in Australia in 1928. He was named after James Armand de Rothschild, his father's former employer, whose birthday he shared. Wolfensohn grew up in a two-bedroom flat in Edgecliff. His father struggled financially, and in his autobiography, A Global Life, he described how monetary insecurity was a fact of life from childhood and explained that he was always looking for a cushion to protect himself from it.

The character first appeared in The Avengers #69. The Grandmaster is one of the ageless Elders of the Universe and has mastered most civilizations' games of skill and chance. Different media appearances depict him as the brother of the Collector. Jeff Goldblum portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and in a cameo during the closing credits of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017). Publication history The Grandmaster first appeared in The Avengers #69 (October 1969). The character was created by Roy Thomas and Sal Buscema. Fictional character biography Although his exact origin is unknown, he is one of the oldest living beings in the universe, coming from one of the first intelligent races to evolve after the Big Bang. He once possessed the Mind Gem, one of the six Infinity Gems, but he lost it to Thanos.Thanos Quest #2. Marvel Comics. He is a cosmic game player whose preferred game is pitting two opposing teams against each other. He has used the Squadron Sinister, Daredevil, the Defenders, the East and West Coast Avengers, Malibu Comics's Ultraforce, and DC Comics' Justice League of America. In his first appearance, the Grandmaster played a game against Kang the Conqueror for the power to resurrect Ravonna or destroy Kang's planet, using the Avengers and Squadron Sinister as pawns. However, Kang's efforts failed due to the intervention of the Black Knight meaning that the Avengers did not technically win their fight, causing Kang to sacrifice the power to resurrect Ravonna for the power to kill the Avengers, with this attempt failing again when the Grandmaster's gift literally gave Kang the power to kill only the Avengers rather than the currently-unaffiliated Black Knight.Avengers #69-71. Marvel Comics. He next used the Defenders as pawns in a game against the Prime Mover.Giant-Size Defenders #3. Marvel Comics. The Grandmaster later challenged Death to a game of strategy, with the power to resurrect his fellow Elder the Collector as prize. A large collection of Earth heroes were used as pawns by both sides of the game; the Grandmaster promised that, if he won, he would never again use Earth's heroes as his pawns. The Grandmaster won, only to learn the resurrection power could only be used if someone else died in the resurrectee's place. Nonetheless, the Grandmaster felt the game would be incomplete unless the power was used, noting \\"Never, in a thousand games on a thousand worlds, have I quit the table ere the game was through!\\" Death suggested he use the heroes' lives instead, but, unwilling to break his promise to never again manipulate them, he instead sacrificed his own life to resurrect the Collector.Contest of Champions #1-3. Marvel Comics. The Grandmaster returned from beyond his grave to plague the East and West Coast Avengers during one of their annual games of baseball, reasoning that, since he was dead, he was free from his vow to leave Earth's heroes in peace. After he and the Collector tricked the teams into battling each other, the Grandmaster succeeded in his true plan: to capture Lady Death and usurp her powers. He forced the Avengers to participate in a competition with the Legion of the Unliving in order to stop a series of powerful bombs, the fate being all of creation. Captain America and Hawkeye were the only two heroes to survive; the rest of the Avengers were slain, only to instantly join the Legion. As the Grandmaster was preparing to force the pair to fight the Legion again, Hawkeye convinced him to lay it all on the line with one last game of pure chance. Hawkeye held one arrow in each fist, the tips hidden in his hands. Grandmaster would win if he chose the one with Hawkeye's last arrowhead. The one he picked was headless (Hawkeye admits to Captain America that he had cheated: he quickly snapped off the arrowhead as the Grandmaster chose the correct arrow), and his distraction allowed Lady Death to escape her bonds and banish the Grandmaster from her realm ‚Äî in other words, making them effectively immortal.Avengers Annual #16 (1987). Marvel Comics. As a reward, she returned the deceased Avengers to life. This incident is what led Death to ban the Elders from dying, confirmed by the Grandmaster in the issue's final panels, just before he expresses interest in the Avengers' renewed baseball game.Avengers West Coast #2; Avengers Annual #16. Marvel Comics. He and a group of ten other Elders then conspired to kill Galactus and restart the universe; they felt that being banned from Death's realm would make them the sole survivors to continue their obsessions in a whole new universe.Silver Surfer Vol. 2 #4. Marvel Comics. The Grandmaster battled Galactus and the Silver Surfer,Silver Surfer Vol. 2 #9. Marvel Comics. and was one of the five Elders captured and consumed by Galactus.Silver Surfer Vol. 2 #10. Marvel Comics. The devoured Elders caused Galactus \\"cosmic indigestion\\" from within until they were forced out of him by Master Order and Lord Chaos.Silver Surfer Vol. 2 #17. Marvel Comics. When the Silver Surfer asked the five Elders to aid them in helping Galactus to defeat the In-Betweener the Grandmaster refused because it would nullify a solemn wager the Elders had made so the Champion physically restrained him until the battle was over.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #18. Marvel Comics. Moments later, the five Elders used their Infinity Gems to instantaneously travel very far away from Galactus and his vengeance.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #19. Marvel Comics. The Grandmaster traveled to the Ultraverse to collect the Infinity Gems that were in Loki's possession. Both decide to make a competition for the possession of gems, pitting the Avengers against Ultraforce. However both lost the gems to the entity Nemesis.Avengers / Ultraforce #1 (1995). Marvel Comics. In 2004 the Grandmaster organized the meeting of the Avengers and the Justice League in an attempt to save the Marvel Universe from the DC Comics villain Krona, when Krona came to the Marvel Universe seeking answers about the origin of creation. In an attempt to save his universe, Grandmaster challenged Krona to a game for the identity of a being in the Marvel Universe who had lived through the Big Bang by pitting the Avengers and the JLA against each other in a 'scavenger hunt' for twelve items of power- with Krona choosing the Avengers as his team-, only for Krona to turn on the Grandmaster when he lost due to Captain America helping Batman gain the Cosmic Cube. Although Krona's anti-energy powers were able to easily defeat both the Grandmaster and Galactus, the Grandmaster revealed the game was a trick and was able to use the items gathered to merge the two universes and trap Krona in their 'junction point'. However Krona accelerated the process, with the intention of destroying both universes and learning their secrets. The Phantom Stranger guided the two teams to the Grandmaster, who showed them the truth of reality, then died. However the Grandmaster was restored to life when reality was returned to normal, and it was revealed he had been playing a game with the New God Metron.JLA/Avengers#1-4. Marvel Comics. The Grandmaster later recreated his Squadron Sinister, with new incarnations of members Doctor Spectrum and Hyperion, to contend against Baron Helmut Zemo's Thunderbolts. He has been using this Squadron to destroy several sources of extra-dimensional energy, known collectively as the \\"Universal Wellspring\\", apparently to prevent Zemo from controlling them. The Grandmaster was dispersed by Zemo in a battle for the final Wellspring.Thunderbolts #106. Marvel Comics. In Thunderbolts #108 he was restored and battled Zemo for control of Earth, however using all the power of Earth that had been loaned to him by Earth's superhumans, Zemo was able to take his powers away. Zemo then shot the Grandmaster in the head seemingly killing him.Thunderbolts #108. Marvel Comics. The Grandmaster returns, promising the Hulk the revival of his long-lost love, Jarella (though this has been thought in the past to be beyond his powers), if he participates in a battle to the death with a team of his choice. The Hulk chooses Doctor Strange, Namor, and the Silver Surfer. However, the Grandmaster takes them from different points in time (specifically, moments when their greatest loves were lost to them), and sets them against a team gathered by the Collector called the Offenders (which is composed of Red Hulk, Baron Mordo, Tiger Shark, and Terrax). This again causes conflict with Galactus.Hulk #10 (2009). Marvel Comics. Upon the conclusion of this battle the Grandmaster is apparently slain by the Red Hulk, and the Collector quits, simply leaving Hulk with Jarella's lifeless body.Hulk #12 (June 2009). Marvel Comics. The Grandmaster returns, with a more childish attitude. He has developed romantic feelings towards the X-Man heroine Dazzler. To that end, he stages a roller derby pitting her and two friends against dozens of super-villains. This angers Dazzler, because romance does not involve putting the person you care about in seemingly deadly danger.X-Men: To Serve and Protect #4 (Feb 2011). Marvel Comics. Eight months after the \\"Secret Wars\\" storyline as part of the \\"All-New, All-Different Marvel,\\" the Grandmaster competes against Collector on Battlerealm (a location which is made up of what's left of Battleworld) in a new Contest of Champions with the prize being an artifact called the Iso-Sphere.Contest of Champions Vol. 2 #1. Marvel Comics. During the \\"No Surrender\\" arc, Grandmaster forms his version of the Lethal Legion to go up against Challenger's Black Order in a contest that involves Pyramoids.Avengers #675. Marvel Comics. It is later revealed that Voyager is Grandmaster's daughter who he used in his plans to claim the Pyramoids.Avengers #684. Marvel Comics. His plan was finally defeated when Living Lightning confronted the Grandmaster and provoked him into a game of poker, with Santos subsequently raising the stakes of the game until he reached a point where the stakes were that the loser would have all memory of their accomplishments wiped from the memories of all who knew of them. Faced with this potential loss, the Grandmaster folded despite his ignorance of Santos's hand, as he could not bear to lose everything like that, whereas Santos accepted that being an Avenger meant doing the right thing because it was the right thing to do rather than because you would be remembered for it.Avengers #689. Marvel Comics. During the \\"Empyre\\" storyline, Grandmaster is revealed to have a sister called the Profiteer, another Elder of the Universe.Empyre: Fantastic Four #0. Marvel Comics. Powers and abilities The Grandmaster has been described as manipulating the so-called \\"power primordial\\", radiation left over from the Big Bang,Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Master Edition and is one of the most powerful Elders of the Universe. However, his power is considerably below that of Galactus and the In-Betweener.Silver Surfer vol. 3 #18; Hulk #12 (2009). Marvel Comics. It has been implied that the Grandmaster can, and in some cases has, used highly advanced technology to augment his abilities and perform feats that might be normally beyond him. While the extent of this is unknown, it is known that the Grandmaster has access and mastery of technology far beyond human comprehension. The Grandmaster possesses a cosmic life force which renders him virtually immortal, including immunity to aging, disease, poison, and imperviousness to conventional injury through regeneration of any damage. He can survive and travel in space unaided and without food, drink, or air. He can utilize his cosmic life force for a variety of effects, including levitation, the projection of blasts of cosmic energy, teleportation across space and time and alternate dimensions, adjusting his size, control time to interact with beings moving at superhuman speed, or transformation and rearrangement of matter on a planetary scale. Perhaps his most fearsome ability is his power over life and death. The Grandmaster can \\"will\\" the death of another being. It is unknown if he can will the death of another virtual immortal being. He can also \\"resurrect\\" another being no matter how badly injured or heal a person on the verge of death. He cannot resurrect another virtually immortal being powered by \\"cosmic life force\\" like himself or anyone who has died past a certain time point. Lastly, he can temporarily bestow these powers upon another being. Currently, due to his machinations against Death, he and the other Elders cannot die. He has a highly developed superhuman intellect, with vast knowledge and comprehension of games and game theory far beyond present-day Earth, as well as encyclopedic knowledge of thousands of exotic games played throughout the universe. He can calculate diverse low information probabilities within a tenth of a second and remember countless rules and data. He also possesses certain extra-sensory abilities of mental perception beyond those currently known which enable him to sense things about his surroundings not detectable by normal senses, and maintains a psychic link with the highly advanced computers of his base world, which extend and enhance his mental abilities. The Grandmaster has access to various exotic extraterrestrial devices as needed, including starships.

Educated at Northern Quebec mission schools, Adams became an electrician, and eventually owned a number of businesses in different industries around Canada. Adams served for two terms as the chairman of the Rankin Inlet hamlet council, and in 1970 became a member of the Northwest Territories Territorial Council (now the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories). In spring 1977, Pierre Trudeau, the then Prime Minister of Canada, decided that an Inuk should be appointed to the Senate and dispatched Warren Allmand, the Minister for Northern Affairs, to interview potential candidates. Adams was not excited about joining the Senate upon being asked by Allmand - in fact, he joked that he did not even know what the Senate was, asking the Minister, \\"What's the Senate?\\" However, upon being advised of a Senator's annual salary of approximately C$60,000, far more than Adams' electrician's pay of $7,500 a year, he seized the opportunity. Adams was appointed as a Senator for the Northwest Territories by Jules L√©ger, the then Governor General of Canada, on the advice of the Prime Minister on April 5, 1977, and is a member of the Liberal Party.Senator Willie Adams retired on June 22, 2009. Adams took an intense interest in the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, and upon the creation of the territory of Nunavut in 1999 became a Senator for that territory. In 2009, he left the Senate upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 75. At that time, he was the longest-serving current member of the Canadian Senate, and had served over 32 years in Parliament without ever having faced an election campaign, as Canadian Senators are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister, not elected.  Business ventures  By 1997, Adams had founded several businesses, including Kudlik Electric Ltd., Kudlik Construction Ltd., Rankin Inlet's Nanuq Inn and Ottawa's Umingmak Expediting Ltd. Adams is also president of Polar Bear Cave Investments, a company that owned the Nanuq Inn until its closure in 2003. As of 2009, Adams' company still owed approximately C$350,000 in unpaid interest to the Nunavut Business Credit Corporation, a Crown corporation. The initial loan was taken out to fund the opening of the Nanuq Inn. According to Adams, the Corporation was considering writing off the debt prior to its headquarters' relocation from Cape Dorset to Iqaluit.  Personal life  Adams married his wife, Mary, in the late 1970s. The pair met when the latter travelled to the Northwest Territories to find work as a home economist. The couple have an adult son, Isaac. Adams did not know his father, Nelson, until the two met in Fredericton, New Brunswick, in 1997. Nelson had lived in the north for five years as one of five Newfoundlanders employed by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1931, and had not returned since. Despite the elder Adams having been convinced that the high-profile Willie was his son since 1977, when he read about the younger Adams' appointment to the Senate, he made no attempt to contact him, thinking that \\"he has his own life.\\" Through family connections, the pair reunited in 1997.

It entailed losing not only one's life, property and hereditary titles, but typically also the right to pass them on to one's heirs. Both men and women condemned of capital crimes could be attainted. Attainder by confession resulted from a guilty plea at the bar before judges or before the coroner in sanctuary. Attainder by verdict resulted from conviction by jury. Attainder by process resulted from a legislative act outlawing a fugitive. The last form is obsolete in England (and prohibited in the United States), and the other forms have been abolished. Middle Ages and the Renaissance Richard of York, attainted by Margaret of Anjou Medieval and Renaissance English monarchs used acts of attainder to deprive nobles of their lands and often their lives. Once attainted, the descendants of the noble could no longer inherit his lands or income. Attainder essentially amounted to the legal death of the attainted's family. Monarchs typically used attainders against political enemies and those who posed potential threats to the king's position and security. The attainder eliminated any advantage the noble would have in a court of law; nobles were exempt from many of the techniques used to try commoners, including torture. Likewise, in many cases of attainder, the king could coerce the parliament into approving the attainder and there would be a lower or non-existent burden of proof (evidence) than there would be in court. Prior to the Tudors, most rulers reversed their attainders in return for promises of loyalty. For example, Henry VI reversed all 21 attainders, Edward IV 86 of 120, and Richard III 99 of 100. However, this changed with Henry VII, as described below. Regnants who used attainder include: * Margaret of Anjou: her attainder of Richard of York led him to invade England and attempt to seize the throne after the Battle of Northampton, which led to the penultimate phases of the War of the Roses. * Edward IV of England: used attainder after killing his brother, George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence for high treason. This allowed Richard III of England to rightfully inherit the throne when he claimed that Edward IV's sons were illegitimate. * Henry VII: initially attainted men after he ascended the throne. He used the threat of attainder as a means to keep the few nobles who survived the War of the Roses in line. Often, however, he would penalize them with exorbitant fees and fines, or force them to have bonds which would be forfeit unless they exhibited good behaviour (his goal was to reduce the number of nobles with private armies of retainers.) Henry VII attainted 138 men, of whom he reversed only 46 attainders, and some of these were conditional. * Henry VIII: compelled parliament to attaint many nobles during his lifetime, including magnates with major land holdings, and any magnates whom he came to mistrust. Examples include: **Anne Boleyn: Before her execution, she was stripped of her title, and her marriage was annulled. ** Catherine Howard: Henry VIII had an Act of Attainder passed against Catherine Howard, which made it treason for a woman with an unchaste reputation to marry the king. ** Edward Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, one of the wealthiest magnates in England, whom Henry had executed on flimsy charges in 1521. ** Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury: One of the last surviving noble Plantagenets of senior line. ** Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey: The poet son of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk. **Thomas Cromwell: former Principal Secretary to Henry VIII, who was arrested at a Privy Council meeting in 1540, and charged with treason, executed on the grounds of an Attainder * Charles I: subsequent to the failed impeachment of his former Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, was attainted during the political crisis of 1640 -1641. The Bill of Attainder, having passed the depleted House of Commons and House of Lords, was enacted by Charles I as a concession to his political opponents. During his reign, the Long Parliament of 1641 passed an Act of Attainder against William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury who was beheaded in 1645. * Charles II: Although deceased by the time of the Restoration, the regicides John Bradshaw, Oliver Cromwell, Henry Ireton and Thomas Pride were served with a Bill of Attainder on 15 May 1660 backdated to 1 January 1649 (NS). * William III: ** James, III and VIII, the Old Pretender, 1702 * George II of Great Britain, following the Jacobite rising of 1745: **Attainder of Earl of Kellie and others Act 1746 Once attainted, nobles were considered commoners, and as such, could be subjected to the same treatments, including torture and methods of execution. For example, commoners could be burned at the stake, whereas nobles could not. Often, nobles would refer to the act of being attainted (and then executed) as the person's \\"destruction\\". Passage in Parliament In the Westminster system, a bill of attainder is a bill passed by Parliament to attaint persons who are accused of high treason, or, in rare cases, a lesser crime. A person attainted need not have been convicted of treason in a court of law; in fact, the attainder process is a method of declaring a person a fugitive. A rumour circulated that a bill of attainder against Thomas Jefferson occurred in 1774 because of his authorship of A Summary View of the Rights of British America. A bill of attainder was last passed in Britain in 1798, against Lord Edward FitzGerald. Attainders by confession, verdict and process were abolished in the United Kingdom by the Forfeiture Act 1870 (33 & 34 Vict., c.23). Section 9 of Article One of the United States Constitution provides that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed by Congress.U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 9, ¬∂ 3. The following section forbids states from passing them.U.S. Constitution, Art. I, Sec. 10, ¬∂ 1. Corruption of blood Corruption of blood is one of the consequences of attainder. The descendants of an attainted person could not inherit either from the attainted person (whose property had been forfeited by the attainder) or from their other relatives through him. For example, if a person is executed for a crime leaving innocent children, the property of the criminal is forfeited to the crown and will not pass to the children. When the criminal's innocent father outlives his son, the property inherited by the criminal from the father cannot be inherited by the criminal's children either: it will be distributed among other family members. The United States Constitution prohibits corruption of blood as a punishment for treason,U.S. Constitution, Art. III, Sec. 3, ¬∂ 2. and when Congress passed the first federal crime bill in 1790, it prohibited corruption of blood as a punishment for any federal crime. In England and Wales, corruption of blood was abolished by the Corruption of Blood Act 1814.

Active from 1898 until her death, she had a literary reputation for combining exciting incidents with psychological interest. Three of her works were adapted for the screen: The Lodger (1913 novel; numerous film adaptations), Letty Lynton (1931 novel; 1932 film adaptation), and The Story of Ivy (1927 novel; 1947 film adaptation). Additionally, The Lodger was adapted as a 1940 radio drama and 1960 opera. Personal life Cover of The Chink in the Armour Born in Marylebone, London and raised in La Celle-Saint-Cloud, France, Belloc was the only daughter of French barrister Louis Belloc and English feminist Bessie Parkes. Her younger brother was Hilaire Belloc, whom she wrote of in her last work, The Young Hilaire Belloc (published posthumously in 1956). Belloc's paternal grandfather was the French painter Jean-Hilaire Belloc, and her maternal great-great- grandfather was the theologian/philosopher Joseph Priestley.

It stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. This was the last cinematography credit for Mikael Salomon before he moved on to a directing career, and the music score was done by John Williams. It was screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival. Cruise and Kidman play Irish immigrants seeking their fortune in 1890s America, eventually taking part in the Land Run of 1893. This was Cyril Cusack's final film before his death the following year. Plot In Ireland in 1892, Joseph Donnelly's father dies, but comes back to life for a few moments to tell Joseph to not give up his dream of owning his own land someday. His family home is burned down by his landlord Daniel Christie's men because of unpaid rent. Joseph tries killing Daniel, but he injures himself in the process and is nursed back to health by Nora Christie and her daughter, Shannon, intending to hang him. Joseph meets Shannon, who plans to run away from home and travel to America, as there is land being given away for free there. She offers to take Joseph with her as her servant, because a woman can't travel alone without being questioned. But he refuses so he can duel Christie's foreman, Stephen Chase, who set fire to the Donnelly home. Christie meets Joseph before the duel and tells him that he had nothing do with Joseph's family's eviction because the land is managed by Chase. The duel begins, but Shannon rescues Joseph. Together on a ship bound for America, Shannon meets Mr. McGuire, who tells her and Joseph about free land being given away in Oklahoma, but they have to travel a thousand miles and race it like everyone else. Shannon divulges that her collection of silver spoons will cover all expenses to get them to Oklahoma, and McGuire offers to help her find a shop to sell them to once they arrive. Upon arriving, McGuire is shot, and Shannon's spoons fall out of his clothing which are stolen by passersby. Joseph rescues her but not the spoons. Soon they are introduced to Mike Kelly, a Boston ward boss, and an Irish immigrant himself. Kelly finds Joseph and Shannon jobs and a room to rent in a brothel, which they must share. To avoid scandal, Joseph says that Shannon is his sister. As they share the room, Joseph and Shannon become attracted to each other. Joseph becomes a regular in bare-knuckle boxing matches at Boss Kelly's club to make extra cash. Back in Ireland, the Christies' house is burned down by angry tenants in the Irish Land War, so they emigrate to America. Joseph discovers that Shannon has gone to Kelly's club to dance burlesque. The Irish men surrounding the couple beg him to fight for $200, which would get them to Oklahoma. Joseph agrees and is winning until he notices one of his backers groping Shannon. Joseph pushes through the crowd to free her, but is pushed back into the ring where his foot accidentally \\"toes\\" the line, and he is defeated by a sucker punch. In retaliation for the hundreds of dollars Joseph has cost Kelly and his friends, Joseph is thrown out of the club. Joseph returns to their room in the brothel to find Kelly and his thugs taking the money he and Shannon saved, and Joseph and Shannon are thrown out into the streets, homeless. Cold and famished, the pair stay in a seemingly abandoned and luxurious house. The owners of the house return and chase them away, shooting Shannon in the back. Joseph, knowing the Christies are looking for her in Boston, brings Shannon to the home where they're staying. Deciding Shannon will be better cared for by them, Joseph leaves, despite his obvious feelings for her. Joseph heads west to the Ozarks, and finds work laying train track. He sees a wagon train out the door of his boxcar. Knowing it is headed for the Oklahoma land rush, Joseph abandons the railroad and joins the wagon train, arriving in time for the Land Run of 1893. Joseph finds Shannon, Chase, and the Christies already in Oklahoma. Chase, having seen Joseph talking to Shannon, threatens to kill him if he goes near Shannon again. Joseph buys a horse for the land rush, but it dies in a few hours, and is forced to ride an unruly horse he manages to tame. He discovers that Chase has cheated by illegally inspecting the territory before the race, and is headed for the extremely desirable land he found. Joseph quickly outpaces everybody and catches up with Shannon and Chase. Joseph is ready to plant his claim flag, but Chase rushes on horseback at Joseph. A fight breaks out, with Joseph falling and crushed by the horse. Shannon runs to his side and rejects Chase when he questions her actions. Joseph professes his love for Shannon and dies in her arms, but like his father, comes back to life fully revived when Shannon reciprocates Joseph's love. They both drive the land stake into the ground and claim their prize land together. Cast Production Pre-production began in late April 1991. The film was shot in Montana for business reasons, but the Oklahoma Historical Society was involved in its production. Imagine Production Co. toured the areas around Montana for a week. They visited different areas before selecting Billings, Montana. Ron Howard, whose film Backdraft was in the stages of being released in theatres at the time, arrived in Billings to begin groundwork for the film. One site outside of town was a 12,000-acre ranch, which was going to be used to film the Oklahoma Land Rush scene. More than a hundred extras were used, as well as a dozen area actors for small speaking parts. Working titles for the film included The Irish Story and An Irish Story. Principal photography began in Montana on May 28, 1991. After several weeks of preparation, the cast and crew filmed the Oklahoma Land Rush scene on July 7, 1991. Eight hundred riders and extras, nine hundred horses, mule, oxen, and two hundred wagons were used on a quarter mile wide set. Nine cameras were used to film the action sequences. During the filming of the scene four people broke bones and one horse died. Cruise's boxing match was filmed at the Billings Depot. Local area residents were used as extras for the sequence. American Humane reported that \\"The production company not only met American Humane's Guidelines, but went that extra mile to ensure both the physical and mental well-being of the animals.\\" After filming wrapped in Billings, the cast and crew traveled to Dublin, Ireland, to complete filming. Ardmore Studios in Wicklow was used to film interior sequences, and the streets of Boston were filmed in Dublin city. They spent two months there, and production was completed on September 26, 1991. It was the first film shot in Panavision Super 70 and the first film to be shot in 70mm in a decade since Tron (1982). The Arriflex 765 camera was also used, as the camera was capable of 100 frames per second which was used for slow-motion shots during the Oklahoma land rush scene. Soundtrack The music to Far and Away was composed and conducted by composer John Williams. The score, a mixture of traditional Irish instrumentation and conventional orchestra, prominently featured performances by the Irish musical group The Chieftains and a revision of the song \\"Book of Days\\" composed and performed by Enya.

Science fiction author Arthur C. Clarke wrote three laws of prediction. Economic forecasting * In 1987, Ravi Batra predicted an economic depression in his best-selling book, The Great Depression of 1990. He subsequently wrote other books on surviving economic upheaval. * In 1996, economist Alan Greenspan famously stated that there was irrational exuberance in the stock market on Dec 5, 1996, and indeed, may well have contributed to it as a result of his policies as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. His warning went unheeded and the stock market continued to boom in the late 1990s until the stock market downturn of 2000 and 2001, when it became evident that the warning had been correct. * The Great Recession of 2007, arguably the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s, was not foreseen by most forecasters. The failure to forecast the \\"Great Recession\\" was coupled with the inability to accurately estimate its impact. For example, Kit Wei Zheng, a former government scholar at Citi, argued Singapore would experience \\"the most severe recession in Singapore‚Äôs history\\". In the end, he was spectacularly wrong, the economy grew in 2009 by 3.1% and in 2010, expanded 15.2% growth rate. Scientific prediction * The existence of Neptune was predicted through mathematical modelling based on Sir Isaac Newton's Law of gravity * Radio waves were predicted by James Clerk Maxwell * Final anthropic principle - highly contentious prediction bordering on philosophy * Antimatter was predicted by Paul Dirac on the basis of his formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics. * The Higgs boson, an elementary particle, was predicted by Peter Higgs based on a theoretical model in 1964 and its existence was confirmed in 2012. Political prediction * Unipolarity was predicted by Fichte on the basis of his analysis of the challenge of Napoleon and by K'ang Yu-wei on the basis of the macro-historical trend and global closure. * The Cold War was predicted by Alexis de Tocqueville on the basis of the expansion of Russia and America. * World Wars were predicted by K'ang Yu-wei and George Vacher de Lapouge on the basis of the macro-historical trend and global closure. * American unipolarity was predicted by George Vacher de Lapouge on the basis of combination of macro-historical trend, global closure and racial theory and by H. G. Wells on the basis of the development level. * The dissolution of the USSR was predicted by Emmanuel Todd on the basis of economic and national factors. Futurism * Doomsday equation (1960): Heinz von Foerster extrapolated historical population data to predict an infinite human population for 2026. * Future Shock (1970) by Alvin Toffler considered change moving too fast for humans to cope. * Engines of Creation (1986) by K. Eric Drexler which involves molecular nanotechnology changing the world, and introduces the grey goo scenario. * The End of History and the Last Man (1992, by Francis Fukuyama) heralded the arrival of the \\"end point of mankind's ideological evolution and the universalization of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government.\\" Its thesis has since been disavowed by its author. * The Clash of Civilizations by Samuel P. Huntington, published in Foreign Affairs, Volume 72, Number 3, Summer 1993 and later expanded into a book, states \\"the fundamental source of conflict in this new world will not be primarily ideological or primarily economic. The great divisions among humankind and the dominating source of conflict will be cultural. Nation states will remain the most powerful actors in world affairs, but the principal conflicts of global politics will occur between nations and groups of different civilizations. The clash of civilizations will dominate global politics. The fault lines between civilizations will be the battle lines of the future.\\" * The Coming Technological Singularity (1993, by Vernor Vinge) - a prediction of imminent acceleration of progress caused by increasing speed of computers and developments in AI. * An Illustrated Speculative Timeline of Future Technology and Social Change (1993-2008, by J.R. Mooneyham)How advances in technology may reshape humanity an illustrated speculative timeline of future technology and social change at www.jrmooneyham.com * Ray Kurzweil is concerned with the idea of the singularity and many more optimistic technological and transhumanist predictions. * \\"Why the future doesn't need us\\" (April 2000) - an essay warning about the dangers of robotics, genetic engineering, and nanotechnology to humanity. The essay has achieved wide exposure because of Bill Joy's prominence. * Arthur C. Clarke: * Tomorrow Now: Imagining the Next 50 Years by Bruce Sterling in 2002. A popular science approach on futurology, reflecting technology, politics and culture of the next 50 years. * Our Final Hour by Martin Rees in 2003. The book presents the notion that the Earth and human survival are in far greater danger from the potential effects of modern technology than is commonly realised; hence the 21st century may be a critical moment in history when humanity's fate is decided. Rees gained controversy, and notoriety, by estimating that the probability of extinction before AD 2100 is around 50%. This is based on the possibility of malign or accidental release of destructive technology and has gained some attention, as he is a well-regarded astronomer. * Dark Age Ahead by Jane Jacobs in 2004. As it implies the book warns of a pessimistic future, in this case caused by a decay in science, community, and education. Religious prophecy * Apocalyptic literature * Bah√°'√≠ prophecies * Bible prophecy * Christian messianic prophecies * Destiny * Divination * False prophet * List of dates predicted for apocalyptic events * List of messiah claimants * List of people claimed to be Jesus * List of prophecies of Joseph Smith * Postdiction * Predictions and claims for the Second Coming of Christ * Prophecy * Teleology * Unfulfilled Christian religious predictions * Unfulfilled Watch Tower Society predictions Utopias and dystopias * Marquis de Condorcet published his utopian vision of social progress and the perfectibility of man Esquisse d'un Tableau Historique des Progres de l'Espirit Humain (The Future Progress of the Human Mind) in 1794 * William Godwin published his utopian work Enquiry concerning Political Justice in 1793, with later editions in 1796 and 1798. * An Essay on the Principle of Population by Thomas Malthus in 1798 started the fears of a Malthusian catastrophe where overpopulation returns people to mere subsistence. * Looking Backward: 2000-1887 was written by Edward Bellamy in 1888. The novel imagined that by 2000, the United States would be a socialist utopia, with far shorter work weeks for menial laborers and far greater leisure time for all workers. His novel predicted things such as skyscrapers, debit cards, and a device used to hear and view concerts in the home that resembles a modern television. * The Population Bomb by Paul R.

The book extrapolates the reality of contemporary Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany. The main protagonist is Winston Smith, whose job involves supporting the historical revisionism and propaganda of the political regime. Many original concepts from the book, such as doublethink, thought crime and newspeak have since entered popular consciousness. * Foundation series by Isaac Asimov. The new science of psychohistory can simulate history and extrapolate the present into the future. * The author H.G. Wells wrote several works predicting future scientific advances and often exploring the problems that technology causes humanity. He was especially adept at predicting the future role of airplanes in warfare. His 1901 book, Anticipations imagined trains, cars, sexual freedom, and eugenics. In The World Set Free, published in 1914, he eerily predicted the creation of the atom bomb. His 1933 work, Shape of Things to Come, foresaw the extensive use of aerial bombardment in warfare. This was later adapted into the widely seen and critically important Alexander Korda science fiction film Things to Come. * Paris in the Twentieth Century is a science fiction novel by Jules Verne written in 1863 that features detailed descriptions of a world of glass skyscrapers, high-speed trains, automobiles, calculators, and a worldwide communications network. It was not published in Verne's lifetime, and was only discovered by his great- grandson in 1989. It was published in 1994. * Make Room!

In the existential fallacy, one presupposes that a class has members when one is not supposed to do so; i.e., when one should not assume existential import. Not to be confused with the 'Affirming the consequent', which states \\"A causes B; B, therefore A\\". One example would be: \\"Every unicorn definitely has a horn on its forehead\\". It does not imply that there are any unicorns at all in the world, and thus it cannot be assumed that, if the statement were true, somewhere there is a unicorn in the world (with a horn on its forehead). The statement, if assumed true, implies only that if there were any unicorns, each would definitely have a horn on its forehead. Overview An existential fallacy is committed in a medieval categorical syllogism because it has two universal premises and a particular conclusion with no assumption that at least one member of the class exists, an assumption which is not established by the premises. In modern logic, the presupposition that a class has members is seen as unacceptable. In 1905, Bertrand Russell wrote an essay entitled \\"The Existential Import of Proposition\\", in which he called this Boolean approach \\"Peano's interpretation\\". The fallacy does not occur in enthymemes, where hidden premises required to make the syllogism valid assume the existence of at least one member of the class. Examples * All trespassers will be prosecuted. * Therefore, some of those prosecuted will have trespassed. This is a fallacy because the first statement does not require the existence of any actual trespassers (stating only what would happen in the event that some do exist), and therefore does not prove the existence of any. Note that this is a fallacy whether or not anyone has trespassed.

She has primarily played roles in daytime soap operas.  Career  Stuart got her start on The Doctors as lab technician Toni Ferra, a role she played from 1971 to 1976. Her character was involved in a triangle with Dr. Mike Powers and Dr. Alan Stewart. She followed up her work on The Doctors originating the role of Dr. Gina Dante Lansing on rival soap General Hospital (1977-1978) where she was reunited with her former \\"The Doctors\\" co-star Gerald Gordon who played her brother, Dr. Mark Dante. In 1981, she filled in for Maeve Kinkead on Guiding Light as Vanessa Chamberlain while Kinkead was on maternity leave. It was during this time that Vanessa was a prime suspect in the murder of Diane Ballard. This was Stuart's first time playing a schemer on the soaps, and led to playing other sophisticated trouble-makers on practically every New York based soap. \\"Another World\\"  Stuart is best known for her role as Donna Love Hudson on Another World, which she played from January 1983 to November 1986 and again from February 1989 to the show's final episode in June 1999. The role of Donna Love was originally written as a very complex society snob (resembling Iris Cory), interfering in the love life of her brother Peter (by succeeding in busting up his relationship with the divorced Sally Frame and then conspiring against her former friend, Cecile de Poulignac) and dating Iris's ex-husband, Bay City mayor Brian Bancroft. At first a supporting character, Donna was slowly made a lead as she became involved in a triangle with ex-husband Carl Hutchins and flashy novelist Felicia Gallant. Her storyline became more complex when it was revealed that not only was her sister Marley really her illegitimate daughter, but she'd also given birth to Marley's twin, Victoria, as well. As Stuart became more popular, a major romance was created for her with Michael Hudson (Kale Browne) who was Victoria and Marley's father. The Michael/Donna pairing remains one of the show's top supercouples. When Stuart left the show in 1986, the role of Donna was recast with Philece Sampler, who had previously played Renee Dumonde DiMera Banning Marshall on Days of Our Lives in the early 1980s. The recast however was panned by soap periodicals and after two years, Sampler's contract was terminated when Stuart expressed interest in returning to Another World. Her return was highlighted by her being asked to be a part of the show's 25th- anniversary Soap Opera Digest cover. Stuart took medical sabbaticals from her role as Donna in 1990 and 1993, during which former GL and Another World co- star Sofia Landon briefly played the role. In the early 1990s, Donna began a May‚ÄìDecember romance with Matthew Cory (Matt Crane), which proved to be very popular. As the 1990s went on, however, the character was written in such a way that longtime viewers no longer recognized Donna. Stuart was quoted in Soap Opera Digest after Another World's cancellation as saying that if the show had not been canceled in 1999, she would have left the role due to her disapproval regarding her character's direction. When Michael Hudson was killed off in 1997, Donna's behavior became particularly bizarre with the character blaming her daughter Victoria for causing Michael's death. After the show's cancellation, Stuart and several other cast members played their characters on the soap opera As the World Turns in an attempt to lure fans of Another World to watch that program (also a Procter & Gamble soap). Stuart's appearance was initially to have lasted for two episodes in order to help introduce the character of Jake McKinnon to the show, but she ended up recurring on the show for almost three years as Donna paid Jake occasional visits after the death of his wife Victoria. Her final appearance in April 2002 took place when Jake was suddenly killed off, with Marley (Ellen Wheeler) and Donna taking Jake and Victoria's children back to Bay City with them. After \\"Another World\\"  In April 2002 Stuart filled in for former Another World co-star Linda Dano as Rae Cummings on One Life to Live while Dano was on sick leave. Immediately following this, Stuart began the role of Mary Smythe (Greenlee's neglectful and self-centered mother) on All My Children where she played opposite former Another World castmate Mark Pinter. She is one of the few actors to have appeared on three soaps in one calendar year. Originally meant to be written in for only a short stint, the character became integral in a plotline in which Mary revealed that Jackson Montgomery was Greenlee's natural father, making her the latest in the long line of rivals to that show's reigning queen, Erica Kane. Mary had a brief romance with Adam Chandler before disappearing off the canvas in 2005. She returned to the show for two episodes in 2009. In 2010, Stuart debuted on the internet based soap opera Gotham. Stuart attended the 2012 Oscars and the 2013 Emmys with James Cromwell. Personal life Stuart married actor James Cromwell on January 1, 2014, at the home of her former Another World co-star Charles Keating.

Life and career Gelfand moved from New York City to Hollywood, Florida with his family in 1972. Alan \\"Ollie\\" Gelfand started skateboarding in 1974 after his father bought him his first skateboard. In 1976 he won the South Florida Skateboard Championships. That same year the first concrete skateboard parks began to appear in the United States with the first being Skateboard City just up the coast in Port Orange, Florida. In 1977 Hollywood would get its own park called Skateboard USA and it would be here that Gelfand would get his first notice in the skate press. His first published photograph was taken by Craig Snyder, a fellow Hollywood skater and photographer. It would be another Hollywood skater by the name of Scott Goodman who would give Gelfand his nickname of \\"Ollie\\" and who would name Gelfand's accidental aerial lipslide an Ollie Pop. Skateboard USA with its imperfect walls was atypical of the first-generation skate parks and it was the over-vertical sections of the park which played a significant role in Gelfand's development of the Ollie Pop. In late 1977 California pro Stacy Peralta visited the Solid Surf Skate Park in Fort Lauderdale where he met Gelfand and observed with some disbelief his no-handed maneuver. By 1978 the Ollie Air was born, known today simply as the ollie. After Peralta formed Powell Peralta with George Powell, Gelfand was recruited as the first member of the new team by Stacey Peralta. This team later became known as the Bones Brigade and came to include other Florida skaters of the 70s such as Mike McGill, inventor of the 540 aerial or \\"McTwist\\" in 1984, and Rodney Mullen who during the 1980s helped foster the ollie for use on flat ground. Tony Hawk would be another Bones Brigade member to benefit from the ollie. On vert he used the maneuver as a way to achieve higher air when doing tricks. By the mid-1980s Alan Ollie Gelfand maneuver had transformed trick skating in its three disciplines of vert, freestyle and street. Most skateboard tricks today in street skating are now based on this maneuver. In the late 1990s ollie became an official entry in the Oxford English Dictionary but the origin was listed as unknown. After Alan's ex-wife Sharon Gelfand, Sharon Israel at the time, submitted enough citations that proved Alan Gelfand was the first person to ollie, the Oxford English Dictionary in February 2004 rectified the listing giving Alan \\"Ollie\\" Gelfand credit as the name and originator behind the 1976 maneuver. In July 2006 the Merriam-Webster followed suit adding Gelfand and his ollie to its dictionary. Later years Gelfand stopped skateboarding in 1981 because of knee injuries, general burn-out, and the shutdown of most U.S. skate parks during the previous year. During the 1980s Gelfand turned to racing cars, driving Volkswagens, and winning many of the Sports Car Club of America SCCA races. In 1987 Gelfand won the World Karting Association or WKA Grand National Championship. From there he went on to win many 6 hr and 12 hr the hardest race of all 24-hour races driving VW's. Ollie custom-built in a shop called \\"Ollieprep\\". In 2001 Gelfand raced in the IMSA Grand Am Cup behind the wheel of a 2000 model Porsche 986 . Gelfand continued racing for another year with visits to winners circle in several national competitions. In 2001 Gelfand returned to skateboarding. In 2002, he built the most perfect bowl could in Hollywood, Florida called Olliewood which features a 48-foot bowl built by the Team Pain crew. He also owns the largest dealer alternative for service of German Vehicles and SUVs called German Car Depot (Name changed from VW DEPOT then to V DEPOT in 2009) In 2015, he purchased Foreign Car of Hollywood and now offers service for all German cars in Hollywood Florida.

Biography Early years Lester Iradell Horton was born in Indianapolis, Indiana on January 23, 1906. His parents were Iradell and Pollyanna Horton. His interest in dance was stimulated by his fascination with American Indian culture after watching tribal dances in a Wild West show. He studied the Iroquois and Red River Indians, and Penobscot and Ojibwa tribes.Dorathi Bock Pierre, \\"From Primitive to Modern,\\" American Dancer (October, 1937), p.36 He studied ballet for two years with a local teacher in Indianapolis, Theo Hewes. At that time he also took classes at the Herron Art Institute and worked with the Indianapolis Little Theater. Seeing a performance of the Denishawn company had a great impact on him. Horton arrived in California in 1929 to perform The Song of Hiawatha, a dance-pageant by Clara Bates based on Longfellow's poem, at the Argus Bowl, a natural amphitheater in Eagle Rock. He took a job with the sculptress Kathleen Stubergh, with whom he remained close for his lifetime. They produced wax figures and Horton painted faces on the window mannequins.Warren, Larry. Dance Perspectives 31 Autumn, 1967. He chose to work in California instead of New York City, which was considered the center of modern dance at the time. Career In 1931, Horton created his first solo concert choreography, Kootenai War Dance. That same year he was invited to perform this dance along with a new choreography Voodoo Ceremonial at the Los Angeles Olympics. His success garnered an invitation to perform at the Paramount Theatre on the same bill as Judy Garland and the Garland sisters for a two-week run. In 1932, Lester Horton formed his own dance company called the Lester Horton Dancers. That company evolved into what was briefly known as the Lester Horton California Ballets (1934) and then the Horton Dance Group (1934). The Horton Dance Group, billed in its film appearances as the Lester Horton Dancers, lasted until early 1944. Later, Horton attempted to develop a company on the East Coast for dancer Sonia Shaw, but Shaw's husband stopped underwriting the venture and the company collapsed before it could give any public performances.Larry Warren, \\"Starting from Indiana,\\" Dance Perspectives 31 (Autumn 1967): 7, 13, 18. After a brief hiatus, Horton formed the Dance Theater of Los Angeles with his longtime leading dancer, Bella Lewitzky; their partnership ended when Lewitzky left in 1950. Horton's final company continued until 1960 under the direction of Frank Eng. In order to finance his school and various dance companies, Horton choreographed a number of Hollywood musicals, beginning with Moonlight in Havana (1942). Many of the films, like the Maria Montez vehicle White Savage (1943), were Universal productions, which could not rival the budgetary extravagance of MGM or Fox, though many were in Technicolor; the most notable was Arthur Lubin's Phantom of the Opera (1943). Horton's dancers also frequently worked at clubs, including the Folies Berg√®re in New York and Earl Carroll Theatre and Restaurant in Los Angeles. Horton's best-known works, which he called \\"choreodramas,\\" are Salome (which occupied Horton for nearly two decadesRichard Bizot, \\"Lester Horton's \\"Salome\\", 1934-1953 and After,\\" Dance Research Journal 16.1 (1984): 35.) and The Beloved. Dance Theater made only one appearance in New York, during the last year of Horton's life. The troupe was scheduled to perform at the reputation-making theater of the Young Men's and young Women's Hebrew Association on East Ninety-second street in New York City. Upon arriving the troupe discovered the venue did not provide publicity and so the performance was largely unknown and not well attended. Only about 300 people showed for the Saturday night performance and only about 200 tickets were sold for the Sunday matinee. This netted the company a total of 100 dollars. All but one of the reviews were good. _Alvin Ailey: A Life In Dance_ , Jennifer Dunning,(1996): 64. One magazine praised the \\"superb dancers\\" but complained that \\"one technical and effective stunt follows another with hardly ever any sustained choreographic continuity.\\"\\"Lester Horton Dance Theatre,\\" Dance Observer 20.4 (June‚ÄìJuly 1953): 89. There was not enough money to return home from New York and Horton had doubts about the company's financial ability to attend Jacob's Pillow later that summer. Horton's agent wired Horton the money to get the troupe home. At the time, Horton was drinking heavily and was emotionally and physically ill. Upon returning to Los Angeles he moved into a house on Mulholland Drive where he was attended to by his parents and friends. Determined to perform at the Jacob's Pillow festival, the group travelled to the Berkshires by car. The show was a success, though Horton could not afford to accompany the troupe to the festival. _Alvin Ailey: A Life In Dance_ , Jennifer Dunning,(1996): 65. Riding on their success at the festival, the troupe was asked to open for Johnny Desmond in the Fall; they were so popular that they were invited back for another two-week engagement. Horton died of a heart attack at his home on November 2, 1953. Alvin Ailey briefly ran the company following Horton's death, but eventually moved to New York City, where in 1969 the Horton Technique became standard training for students at the Alvin Ailey American Dance Center Since Horton's death, his dance technique and choreography have become widely known and practiced. Horton's legacy has survived through the www.lhdt.org Lester Horton Dance Theater Foundation, Inc., which is dedicated to preserving and promoting Horton's contributions as a dancer, choreographer, and educator. Also, various dance companies such as the Joyce Trisler Danscompany focus on Horton's technique,\\",Joyce Trisler Danscompany Accessed 1-5-2008. as well as the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre and School. Horton choreographed the following films: * Moonlight in Havana, 1942 (Universal Pictures) * Rhythm of the Islands, 1943 (Universal Pictures) * White Savage, 1943 (Universal Pictures) * Phantom of the Opera, 1943 (Universal Pictures) * The Climax, 1944 (Universal Pictures) * Salome, Where She Danced, 1945 (Universal Pictures) * That Night With You, 1945 (Universal Pictures) * Frisco Sal, 1945 (Universal Pictures) * Shady Lady, 1945 (Universal Pictures) * Tangier, 1946 (Universal Pictures) * Siren of Atlantis, 1948 (United Artists Release) * Bagdad, 1949 (Universal- International) * South Sea Woman, 1953 (Warner Brothers) * 3-D Follies, 1953 (R.K.O) Horton trained a number of significant mid-twentieth century dancers: * Alvin Ailey * Eleanor Brooks * Janet Collins * Rudi Gernreich * Carmen de Lavallade * Bella Lewitzky * James Mitchell * Carl Ratcliff * Jeri Faubion Salkin * Joyce Trisler * James Truitte * William Dale Jennings Other figures who emerged from Horton's school and company include actress Lelia Goldoni and Sondra Kerr Blake. The founder of the Mattachine Society, Harry Hay, had a daughter who took classes at the dance theater. Janet Collins, a twenty year old ballet student (who would go on to be the first African American dancer to perform full-time with the Metropolitan Opera in New York) was one of the students approached by Horton to perform in exchange for free classes. Collins enthusiastically agreed, and yet admitted to Horton that she knew \\"nothing about modern dance.\\" Horton told her not to worry‚Äîhe would teach her. Technique Horton developed his own approach to dance that incorporated diverse elements including Native American Folk Dance, Japanese arm gestures, Javanese and Balinese isolations for the upper body, particularly the eyes, head and hands. Horton also included Afro-Caribbean elements, like hip circles. Contemporary stretching based on Horton Technique Horton's dance technique, which is now commonly known as Horton Technique, has no style, per se. The technique emphasizes a whole body, anatomical approach to dance that includes flexibility, strength, coordination and body and spatial awareness to enable unrestricted, dramatic freedom of expression. \\"I am sincerely trying now to create a dance technique based entirely upon corrective exercises, created with a knowledge of human anatomy; a technique which will correct physical faults and prepare a dancer for any type of dancing he may wish to follow; a technique having all the basic movements which govern the actions of the body; combined with a knowledge of the origin of movement and a sense of artistic design.\\" -Lester Horton, in a letter to Dorathi Bock Pierre, \\"From Primitive to Modern,\\" American Dancer (October 1937) References Further reading * Barnes, Clive.

Sightings often placed their swarms in numbers far larger than any other locust species, with one famous sighting in 1875 estimated at in size (greater than the area of California), weighing 27.5 million tons and consisting of some 12.5 trillion insects, the greatest concentration of animals ever speculatively guessed, according to Guinness World Records. Less than 30 years later, the species was apparently extinct. The last recorded sighting of a live specimen was in 1902 in southern Canada.Canada's History, October‚ÄìNovember 2015, pages 43-44 Because a creature so ubiquitous was not expected to become extinct, very few samples were ever collected (though a few preserved remains have been found in Grasshopper Glacier, Montana). A second species of North American locust, the High Plains locust (Dissosteira longipennis) reached plague proportions in the 1930s but is now very rare, leaving North America as the only continent without a major locust species, apart from Antarctica. Taxonomy A 1902 illustration The species name was formally published with the Latin binomial Caloptenus spretus in 1866 by B.D. Walsh as named by \\"Mr. Uhler, without describing it,\\" adding that \\"The name 'spretus' means 'despised', and refers apparently to its having been hitherto despised or overlooked by Entomologists\\". Walsh does not provide a description of the species, except for female wing length, as well as some aspects of biology, ecology, and control. Some entomologists credit the authority for the binomial Caloptenus spretus to C. Thomas, but fails on the Principle of Priority. The treatment under the genus Melanoplus began in 1878 in publications by S. H. Scudder who pointed out the difference between the genus Caloptenus that he noted as being more correctly spelled Calliptenus and Melanoplus. Although the name \\"Rocky Mountain locust\\" was thought to have been given to this species following recovery of specimens washing off from Rocky Mountains glaciers in recent years, particularly from the Grasshopper Glacier, the name was given to the species, while it was still extant, after it had been established that the true habitat and breeding site of the species is high on the Rocky Mountains. The species is reported to have descended from the Rocky Mountains to the prairie in large numbers only in certain years, particularly in dry seasons, following westward wind currents. Outbreaks usually lasted two consecutive years. Although a great number of eggs were laid on the prairie during outbreak years, individuals hatched from these eggs usually did not thrive, a condition that has been attributed to the lack of adaptation of this species to prairie habitats. and references therein A 2004 molecular phylogenetic study that used mitochondrial DNA from specimens obtained from museums and fragments preserved in frozen glacial deposits confirms the placement in the genus Melanoplus and the distinctiveness as a species (ie not a migratory form of an extant species). It also identified the closest living relative as Melanoplus bruneri rather than Melanoplus sanguinipes as had been earlier surmised. Distribution and habitat Illustration of egg-laying by females (1877) The Rocky Mountain locust occurred in the Rocky Mountains and in most of the prairie areas, though they existed on both sides of the Rocky Mountains. Breeding in sandy areas and thriving in hot and dry conditions, they were often guaranteed a good food supply by prairie plants which concentrate sugars in their stalks in times of drought. Movement of the locusts was probably assisted by a low-level jet stream that persists through much of central North America. Extinction Rocky Mountain locusts caused farm damage in Maine from 1743 to 1756 and Vermont in 1797‚Äì1798. The locusts became more of a problem in the 19th century, as farming expanded westward into the grasshoppers' favored habitat. Outbreaks of varying severity emerged in 1828, 1838, 1846, and 1855, affecting areas throughout the West. Plagues visited Minnesota in 1856‚Äì1857 and again in 1865, and Nebraska suffered repeated infestations between 1856 and 1874. The last major swarms of Rocky Mountain locust were between 1873 and 1877, when the locust caused $200 million in crop damage in Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and other states. One farmer reported that the locusts seemed \\"like a great white cloud, like a snowstorm, blocking out the sun like vapor\\". The locusts ate not only the grass and valuable crops, but also leather, wood, sheep's wool, and‚Äîin extreme cases‚Äîeven clothes off peoples' backs. As the swarms worsened, farmers attempted to control them using gunpowder, fires (sometimes dug in trenches to burn as many of the locusts as possible), smearing them with \\"hopperdozers\\", a type of plow device pulled behind horses that had a shield that knocked jumping locusts into a pan of liquid poison or fuel, even sucking them into vacuum cleaner‚Äìlike contraptions, but all of these were ultimately ineffective in stopping the hordes. Charles Valentine Riley, a Missouri entomologist, came up with a recipe for locusts seasoned with salt and pepper and pan-fried in butter. The recipe sold, but some stated that they \\"would just as soon starve as eat those horrible creatures\\". Farmers finally responded in force to the swarm's destruction; an 1877 Nebraska law said that anyone between the ages of 16 and 60 had to work at least two days eliminating locusts at hatching time or face a $10 fine. That same year Missouri offered a bounty of $1 a bushel for locusts collected in March, 50 cents a bushel in April, 25 cents in May, and 10 cents in June. Other Great Plains states made similar bounty offers. In the 1880s farmers had recovered sufficiently from their locust woes to be able to send carloads of corn to flood victims in Ohio. They also switched to such resilient crops as winter wheat, which matured in the early summer, before locusts were able to migrate. These new agricultural practices effectively reduced the threat of locusts and greatly contributed to the species' downfall. It has been hypothesized that plowing and irrigation by settlers as well as trampling by cattle and other farm animals near streams and rivers in the Rocky Mountains destroyed their eggs in the areas they permanently lived, which ultimately caused their demise. For example, reports from this era suggest that farmers killed over 150 egg cases per square inch while plowing, harrowing or flooding. It appeared that this species lived and reproduced in the prairie only temporarily during swarming years, with each generation being smaller than the previous one and swarming ever further from the Rocky Mountains, while the permanent breeding grounds of this species seemed to be restricted to an area somewhere between 3 and 3,000 square miles of sandy soils near streams and rivers in the Rockies, which coincided with arable and pastoral lands exploited by settlers. Because locusts are a form of grasshopper that appear when grasshopper populations reach high densities, it was theorized that M. spretus might not be extinct, that \\"solitary phase\\" individuals of a migratory grasshopper might be able to turn into the Rocky Mountain locust given the right environmental conditions; however, breeding experiments using many grasshopper species in high-density environments failed to invoke the famous insect. The status of M. spretus as a distinct species was confirmed by a 2004 DNA analysis of North American species of the genus Melanoplus. Melanoplus spretus was formally declared extinct by the IUCN in 2014. In literature A fictionalized description of the devastation created by Rocky Mountain locusts in the 1870s can be found in the 1937 novel On the Banks of Plum Creek by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Her description was based on actual incidents in western Minnesota during the summers of 1874 and 1875 as the locusts destroyed her family's wheat crop. Another vivid portrayal of the depredations of the locust can be found in Ole Edvart R√∏lvaag's Giants in the Earth, based in part on his own experiences and those of his wife's family.

She was a dancer, choreographer, and above all, a dance educator. Connection with Mary Wigman Born as Johanna Eckert, Holm was drawn to music and drama at an early age, she attended the Institution of Emile Jacques-Dalcroze throughout her childhood and young adult life. At the age of 28, she saw the German expressionist Mary Wigman perform, and decided to continue her dance career at the Wigman School in Dresden where she soon became a member of the company. Mary Wigman and Hanya Holm shared a special bond through movement. Egyptian Dance was said to be the first time Wigman realized the artistic impression Holm was capable of. She had the creative will and ability to shape a choreographic vision into reality. Wigman invited Holm to teach, co-direct the Dresden School, and in her recognition of the opportunity that opening a school in New York could offer the world of dance, eventually sent Holm to launch a Wigman branch in New York City (on September 26, 1931). The initial letters of certification and agreement from Wigman to Holm about the migration over to America to direct the school were found in her house after her death in 1992. These letters were published in Dance, Business, and Politics: Letters from Mary Wigman to Hanya Holm. In the letters the salary was laid out making sure that the transfer would continue to support her son, Klaus, who stayed in Germany, and the letter of agreement signed by both parties \\"promises to apply all her strength to the advancement of the New York Wigman School and to conduct the work according to Mary Wigman's ideas ... as well as to see that the M.W. philosophy of dance is implemented faithfully within and outside the New York Wigman School in every possible way\\". Holm was not only capable of rising to the challenge of representing the Wigman name and teaching philosophy, she also helped to shape the school and build an influence of her own. Due to the rise of fascism and a need to distance the school from German ties, it became known as the Hanya Holm Studio (1936‚Äì1967). Holm Technique and Choreography Holm had a unique form of technique that shaped generations of dancers and choreographers including Alwin Nikolais, Mary Anthony, Valerie Bettis, Don Redlich, Alfred Brooks, Liz Aggiss and Glen Tetley. Her technique stressed the importance of pulse, planes, floor patterns, aerial design, direction, and spatial dimensions. Holm's movement emphasized the freedom and flowing quality of the torso and back, but remained based on universal principles of physics for motion. Holm trained through improvisation so, a specific movement vocabulary or phrasing that could be carried on through classes does not exist; instead her focus was about learning through discovery. Choreographically her movement focused on the body's relation to space and emotion, which was an extension of Wigman and Rudolf Laban. She worked on movement that projected into space. Holm's stylistic idea was about \\"absolute dance\\" without pantomime or dramatic overtones. Attention to conveying an idea in her choreography was more important than the dancers' technical ability. Holm would say, \\"I want to see a sign of passion. I want to see the raw if struggling to express itself. A work must have blood.\\" Invited by dance director Martha Hill, Holm was one of the founding artists at Bennington College in 1934 along with Martha Graham, Charles Weidman, and Doris Humphrey, who came to be some of the most influential modern dancers of their time: \\"The Big Four\\". The American Dance Festival (ADF) arose from Bennington College. This was an opportunity for modern dancers to come together to take class and present new works. Holm's first major work, Trend, (1937) dealt with social criticism and incorporated Ausdruckstanz and American techniques. In 1941, she started a Center of Dance in Colorado Springs where she had summer courses and was able to perfect her creative exploration technique. In 1948, she choreographed for Broadway: Ballet Ballads and Kiss Me, Kate which led to twelve other musicals. Holm's dance work Metropolitan Daily was the first modern dance composition to be televised on NBC, and her Labanotation score for Kiss Me, Kate (1948) was the first choreography to be copyrighted in the United States. She also choreographed Out of This World (1950), My Darlin' Aida (1952), The Golden Apple (1954), My Fair Lady (1956), Camelot (1960), and Anya (1965).She also directed a 1960s television musical adaptation of Pinocchio. Holm choreographed extensively in the fields of concert dance and musical theatre. Other works by Holm include: Tragic Exodus, They Too Are Exiles, Dance Of Work and Play and Dance Sonata Holm as a Dance Educator Hanya Holm's approach to teaching was to liberate each individual to define a technical style of his or her own that should express their inner personality and give freedom to explore. She would tell her students, \\"You have a perfect right to branch out, if you have the stuff in you, if you discover your own richness, if you have something to say.\\" Holm's philosophy of teaching was how to find the essence of dance and understand where the movement comes from in the body that way it is a natural response in the dancer's body. She brought weltanschauung to her dance teaching. Holm was strict; she expected greatness from her students which would come from a willingness to work hard. It was her thought that if you worked hard and truly wanted it, you would achieve the desired outcome. Holm had an extremely keen eye, she had the ability to look at something and verbalize what she wanted using elaborate imagery and analogies. She used her technique class as a preparation for her improvisation and composition classes. These classes were where the students could expand and experiment on the skills that were presented in class, making the movement innate in their bodies. A large amount of Holm's choreography came from the improv and comp classes. Hanya Holm taught anatomy, Dalcroze eurhythmics, improvisation, and Labanotation at her school. She taught at Colorado College, Mills College, University of Wisconsin, Alwin Nikolais School, and was the Head of Dance Department in New York's Musical Theatre Academy. After 1974, she taught at the Juilliard School (Martha Hill, director) in New York. In 1988, a documentary of her life Hanya: Portrait of a Pioneer narrated by Julie Andrews and Alfred Drake, and featuring interviews with Holm, Nikolais, Murray Louis, and others, was released by Dance Horizons. Family & Death Her son was Broadway lighting designer Klaus Holm. She and her son are interred in Hanover Township, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. Her husband was a German sculptor who, when Hitler came to power, sided with the Reich, effectively ending his marriage to Holm. Holm has been honored by the National Dance Association, in 1976, with the Heritage Award for her contributions to dance education. She was inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 1988. Holm died at the age of 99 of natural causes on November 3, 1992 in New York City, USA.

She is considered one of the most important figures in the history of modern dance.Rainer Metzger (2007), Berlin in the Twenties: Art and Culture 1918-33, London, p. 160. She became one of the most iconic figures of Weimar German culture and her work was hailed for bringing the deepest of existential experiences to the stage. Life Portrait of Mary Wigman dancing by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner Karoline Sophie Marie Wiegmann was born in Hanover, Germany. She came to dance comparatively late after seeing three students of √âmile Jaques-Dalcroze, who aimed to approach music through movement using three equally-important elements: solf√®ge, improvisation and his own system of movements, eurhythmics.Mead, V. H. (1996). \\"More than Mere Movement ‚Äì Dalcroze Eurhythmics.\\" Music Educators Journal, 82(4), 38‚Äì41. Wigman enrolled in the Jaques-Dalcroze's school in Dresden in 1911. Another key early experience was a solo concert by Grete Wiesenthal. The Jaques-Dalcroze school's practice made dance secondary to music, so Wigman decided to take her interests elsewhere. In 1913, she was introduced to Rudolf Laban and Courtney Neilson in Ascona, Switzerland. She enrolled in one of Rudolf Laban's summer courses and was instructed in his technique. Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman Following their lead, she worked upon a technique based in contrasts of movement; expansion and contraction, pulling and pushing. She continued with the Laban school through the Switzerland summer sessions and the Munich winter sessions until 1919Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman. During these years and through the First World War, she worked as Laban's assistant in Leipzig. After her departure from the Laban school, she retreated to the mountains of Switzerland to develop her expressionist style. She named her new dance style \\"New German Dance,\\" using the word new to express the break from traditional classical ballet. She wanted her dance to be an expression of human's desires, passions, and inspirations.Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman She was deeply interested in the relationship between humans and the cosmos, and she wanted to give life to the individual forces surrounding humans. She wanted to create a technique that did not need codification, but rather, it arose out of visual interpretations of the desires of human being. In her mind, any movement could be considered dance if it is expressing a true feeling. Her technique and choreography often consisted of \\"sliding, bouncing, vibrating, falling/dropping, and tensions.\\" Mary Wigman.

Two years later, in 1920, she was offered the post of ballet mistress at the Dresden State Opera, but, after taking up residence in a hotel in Dresden and beginning to teach dance classes while awaiting her appointment, she learned that the position had been awarded to someone else.Newhall (2009), p. 28. In 1919, Wigman performed her first solo concert in a professional setting in Berlin, Hanover, and Bremen. These concerts were not well received by the public, but she continued to perform. Later that year, she received high praise from audiences in Hamburg, Zurich, and Dresden, and her name became known. By the mid-1920s, her name was associated in Germany with \\"Ausdruckstanz,\\" which translates to Expressionist Dance.Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary- wigman In 1920-21,Prof. Dr. Karl Toepfer, Prof. Dr. Peter Reichel, Dr. Gabriele Postuwka, Frank-Manuel Peter, Dr. Yvonne Hardt, Dr. Thomas Kupsch, Cathleen B√ºrgelt, Muriel Favre, Heide Lazarus (2003) Selection of documents about The Wigman School, Dresden, from the period of 1924 to 1937 , Deutsches Tanzarchiv, K√∂ln (German Dance Archives, Cologne), SK Stiftung Kultur (SK Culture Foundation) Wigman started her own dance school, which became known as \\"Dresden Central School\\" or simply \\"Mary Wigman-Schule\\", a centre of new, expressionist dance. This school became the center of German modern dance. The rivalry and competition between her new school and the old schools of dance in Dresden emerged, especially with the Palucca School of Dance. Mary Wigman, dance studio, West Berlin 1959 Her students and collaborators from Europe included Yvonne Georgi, Hanya Holm, Harald Kreutzberg, Gret Palucca, Margarethe Wallmann, Inge Weiss, and Meta Vidmar who, in 1930, established the first school of modern dance in Slovenia. She formed a dance troupe as well, which toured the world beginning in 1923. Mary Wigman toured the United States in 1930 with her company of dancers, as well as 1931 and 1933. A school was founded by her disciples in New York City in 1931. Her choreography inspired communist dance troupes in the 1930s in New York CityJohn Martain, \\"Workers League in Group Dances\\", The New York Times, 24 December 1934. Her work in the United States is credited to her protegee Hanya Holm, and then to Hanya's students Alwin Nikolais and Joanne Woodbury. Another student and protegee of Wigman's, Margret Dietz, taught in America from 1953-72. During this time, her style was characterized by critics as \\"tense, introspective, and somber,\\" yet there was always an element of \\"radiance found even in her darkest compositions.\\" Other Dresden schools were founded in other areas of Germany, and Hanya Holm even set up one in the United States. Her style of movement and training was even utilized in German public schools. She was officially honored for her accomplishments in the early 1930s by the German government.Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman The \\"Mary Wigman-Schule\\" existed from 1920 until 1942. However, when World War II began, the Nazis in Germany viewed her as a leftist, and they considered her dances to be degenerate. The Nazis put an end to her school, but allowed her to teach in Leipzig during the war.Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman The \\"Mary Wigman-Schule\\" continued to operate under Nazi rule in World War II, following that she obey the rule of government and fire all the Jewish dancers from her schools in Germany. What had been the Mary Wigman-Schule was started again after the war by Dore Hoyer. Hoyer and the school created a Dances for K√§the Kollwitz which they performed in Dresden in 1946. Wigman continued to teach in Leipzig until 1949. From 1950 until her death in 1973, she taught at her newly opened school in West Berlin, which became a place where modern dancers from all over the world could unite and share ideas. Her last public performance took place in 1953.Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary- wigman  Nazism in Coexistence with Wigman's Work  Amidst the fall of the Weimar Republic, Wigman‚Äôs contributions to modern dance existed within the umbrella of Nazism and the rejection of structured dance (ballet) in favor of ‚Äúfreer‚Äù movements. Marion Kant writes in ‚ÄúDance is a Race Question: The Dance politics of the Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda‚Äù that Wigman‚Äôs dance style became a means through which Nazi ideologies were propagated. Describing Nazi perceptions of art, records of the Propaganda Ministry in the Federal Archives ‚Äúembody an ideology to which dance became subject,‚Äù as Ausdruckstanz, or the new German Dance, arose as a widely accepted art form due to Nazi leaders‚Äô beliefs that dance would benefit the movement. Document 4 in Kant‚Äôs work features a letter from Fritz B√∂hme to Geobbels, which articulates how the ‚ÄúGerman artistic dance ‚Ä¶ must not be allowed to be neglected as an art form‚Äù and must ‚Äúfunction‚Ä¶ as a constructive and formative force, as the guardian of racial values, and as a shield against the flood of confusing foreign postures alien to the German character and German stance‚Äù (72, 197-8). Wigman and her colleagues‚Äô modern dance styles were therefore deemed a means by which the German people could be shielded by outside influence and purified. A note from Ministerial Councilor von Keudell to the Reich Ministry for Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda also recognized Wigman‚Äôs school as a one of the ‚Äúfour model schools of German art dance‚Äù (200). Ultimately, these records reveal how Wigman‚Äôs work fit into the narrative of Nazism and how the fall of the Weimar Republic allowed for Wigman‚Äôs success, yielding to the acceptance of ‚Äúfree‚Äù dance as Nazi propaganda. Wigman‚Äôs work, as well as the work of other similar creators in Germany, also contributed to dance as a gateway for fascist community- building. Susan Manning writes in ‚ÄúModern Dance in the Third Reich, Redux‚Äù that ‚Äúmodern dancers conflated and confused their ideal of the Tanzgemeinschaft (‚Äòdance community‚Äô) with the fascist ideal of Volksgemeinschaft (‚Äò[Aryan] community‚Äô)‚Äù (5) . German dance environments therefore indirectly supported budding Nazi communities. Manning cites another work by Kant, ‚ÄúDeath and the Maiden: Mary Wigman in the Weimar Republic,‚Äù in which Kant examines many writings by Wigman in the early years of the rise of Nazism in Germany. Here, Wigman seemed to express support for ‚Äúthe conservative and right-wing nationalists‚Ä¶ who would bring down the Republic,‚Äù which Manning claims was instrumental in ‚Äúbringing Volkish thought into the mainstream of Weimar politics‚Äù (7). Modern dance therefore became a hallmark of German unification, with Wigman‚Äôs art heading the establishment of Volkish communities through dance. Whether Wigman‚Äôs contributions to Nazism and its rise were intentional or unintentional is a matter of dispute, as Manning recognizes that ‚ÄúMary Wigman could [have]‚Ä¶ opposed Nazi cultural policy, without recognizing that her own belief‚Ä¶ reinforced the Nazi position‚Äù (14). Yet, despite Wigman‚Äôs personal attitudes toward the Nazi Party, her work undoubtedly coexisted and even fit within Nazi ideals of Aryan freedom, community, and identity. Productions Mary Wigman studio, West Berlin West Berlin 1959 Wigman gave her first public performance in Munich in February 1914, performing two of her own dances, including one called Lento and the first version of Hexentanz (Witch Dance),Newhall (2009), p. 22. which later became one of her most important works. Levin, Gaby (8 March 2016)\\"The German Choreographer Who Danced Too Close to the Nazis\\", haaretz.com; retrieved 22 February 2017. While recovering from her nervous breakdown, in 1918, Wigman wrote the choreography for her first group composition, Die sieben T√§nze des Lebens (The Seven Dances of Life), which premiered several year later, in 1921.Newhall (2009), pp. 115‚Äì116. After that her career and influence began in earnest. In 1925 the Italian financier Riccardo Gualino invited Wigman to Turin to perform in his private theater and in his newly opened Teatro di Torino. She had several years' success on the concert stage. Wigman's dances were often accompanied by world music and non-Western instrumentation, such as fifes and primarily percussion, bells, including the gongs and drums from India, Thailand, Africa, and China, contrasted with silence. In later years, she used composers' talents to create music to accompany her choreography, and many choreographers began to use this tactic.Mary Wigman Facts. (2010). http://biography.yourdictionary.com/mary-wigman She would often employ masks in her pieces, influenced again by non-western/tribal dance. She did not use typical costumes associated with ballet. The subject matters included in her pieces were heavy, such as the death and desperation that was surrounding the war. However, she did not choreograph to represent the happenings of the war; she danced to outwardly convey the feelings that people were experiencing in this hard time. Mary Wigman.

Ted Post, who also directed Eastwood in the television series Rawhide and the feature film Hang 'Em High, directed this second installment in the Dirty Harry film series. The screenplay was written by John Milius (who provided an uncredited rewrite for the original film) and Michael Cimino. The film score was once again composed by Lalo Schifrin. This film features early appearances by David Soul, Tim Matheson and Robert Urich. Plot Mobster Carmine Ricca (Richard Devon) drives away from court in his limousine after being acquitted of a mass murder on a legal technicality. However, while his limousine is on an isolated road, Ricca and his three associates are pulled over by an SFPD motorcycle cop and murdered. Inspector Harry Callahan (Eastwood) visits the crime scene alongside his partner Earlington \\"Early\\" Smith (Perry), despite the fact that the two of them are supposed to be on stakeout duty. Callahan trades barbs with their superior, Lieutenant Neil Briggs (Holbrook). After he and Early stumble upon and foil an attempt to hijack an airliner, Callahan meets rookie cops Phil Sweet (Matheson), John Davis (Soul), Alan \\"Red\\" Astrachan (Niven), and Mike Grimes (Urich) while practicing at an indoor firing range. Callahan learns from Sweet that he (and though not directly stated it is presumed the others as well) is an ex- Airborne Ranger and Special Forces veteran after loaning his gun to the rookie, being very impressed by the rookies' marksmanship. Sometime after, a motorcycle cop slaughters a mobster's pool party using a satchel charge and a submachine gun. As Callahan and Early deal with an attempted armed robbery of a store, a pimp (Popwell) murders a prostitute (Avery) who was withholding money from him. The next day, the pimp is killed off by a patrolman he attempted to bribe. While investigating the scene, Callahan deduces what occurred and realizes that the culprit is a cop. He assumes it to be his old friend Charlie McCoy (Ryan), who has become despondent and suicidal after leaving his wife, Carol (White). Later, the motorcycle cop murders drug kingpin Lou Guzman (Pellow) using a Colt Python equipped with a silencer. However, Guzman is under surveillance and Callahan's old partner, Frank DiGiorgio (Mitchum), sees McCoy dump his motorcycle outside Guzman's apartment just before the murders. The motorcycle cop, revealed to be Davis, encounters McCoy in the parking garage and kills him to eliminate a potential witness. Harry learns of McCoy's death while presenting his suspicions to Briggs. At an annual shooting competition, a puzzled DiGiorgio tells Callahan that Davis was the first officer to arrive after the murders of Guzman and McCoy. Callahan borrows Davis' Colt and purposely embeds a slug in a range wall. He later retrieves the slug to have ballistics confirm it to match the bullets from the Guzman murder. Callahan begins to suspect that a secret death squad within the SFPD is responsible for the killings. Briggs ignores his suspicions and insists that mob killer Frank Palancio (Giorgio) is behind the deaths. Callahan persuades Briggs to loan him Davis and Sweet as back up for a raid on Palancio's office. However, Palancio and his gang are tipped off via a phone call. When the cops arrive, Sweet attempts to enforce authority but is killed by Palancio, resulting in a shootout between the police and Palancio's men. Palancio attempts to escape but Callahan jumps on the hood of his car, causing a crash. A search of Palancio's office turns up nothing and only raises Callahan's suspicions further, but an infuriated Briggs puts him under suspension. After returning home, Callahan finds Davis, Astrachan and Grimes waiting for him in his garage, presenting him with a veiled ultimatum to join their organization; Callahan refuses. While checking his mailbox, Callahan discovers a bomb left by the vigilantes and manages to defuse it, but a second bomb kills Early as Callahan phones to warn him. Callahan calls Briggs and shows him the bomb, only to learn that Briggs is the leader of the death squad. Briggs cites the traditions of frontier justice and summary executions, expressing disappointment for Callahan's refusal to join forces. At gunpoint, Briggs orders Callahan to drive to an undisclosed location while being followed by Grimes. Callahan distracts Briggs by sideswiping a bus and knocks him unconscious. Grimes gives chase and shoots out the car's rear windshield before Callahan runs him over. Davis and Astrachan appear, causing Callahan to flee onto an old aircraft carrier in a shipbreaker's yard. As they stalk Callahan through the darkened ship, Astrachan wastes his ammunition and Callahan beats him to death. Callahan runs onto the top deck and starts up Astrachan's motorcycle, leading Davis in a series of jumps between ships before the two run out of deck space. Callahan skids to a stop while Davis falls to his death in San Francisco Bay. Callahan makes his way back to the car, which Briggs commandeers at gunpoint. Briggs states his intent to frame Callahan for the murders rather than kill him. As Callahan backs away from the car, he surreptitiously activates the timer on the mailbox bomb and tosses it in the back seat. Briggs is driving off when the bomb detonates, killing him, after which Callahan proclaims, \\"A man's got to know his limitations.\\" Cast * Clint Eastwood as SFPD Homicide Inspector Harry Callahan * Hal Holbrook as SFPD Homicide Lt.

Eastwood specifically wanted to convey that, despite the 1971 film's perceived politics, Harry was not a complete vigilante. David Soul, Tim Matheson, Robert Urich and Kip Niven were cast as the young vigilante cops.McGilligan (1999), p.234 Milius was a gun aficionado and political conservative and the film would extensively feature gun shooting in practice, competition, and on the job. Given this strong theme in the film, the title was soon changed from Vigilance to Magnum Force in deference to the .44 Magnum that Harry liked to use. Milius thought it was important to remind the audiences of the original film by incorporating the line \\"Do ya feel lucky?\\" repeated in the opening credits. With Milius committed to filming Dillinger, Michael Cimino was later hired to revise the script, overseen by Ted Post, who was to direct. According to Milius, his script did not contain any of the final action sequences (the car chase and climax on the aircraft carriers). His was a \\"simple script\\".John Milius commentary on Magnum Force Deluxe Edition DVD The addition of the character Sunny was done at the suggestion of Eastwood, who reportedly received letters from women asking for \\"a female to hit on Harry\\" (not the other way around). Milius later said he did not like the film and wished Don Siegel had directed it, as originally intended:  Directing  Eastwood himself was initially offered the role of director, but declined. Ted Post, who had previously directed Eastwood in Rawhide and Hang 'Em High, was hired. Buddy Van Horn was the second unit director. Both Eastwood and Van Horn would go on to direct the final two entries in the series, Sudden Impact and The Dead Pool respectively. Filming Frank Stanley was hired as cinematographer. Filming commenced in late April 1973. During filming Eastwood encountered numerous disputes with Post over who was calling the shots in directing the film, and Eastwood refused to authorize two important scenes directed by Post in the film because of time and expenses; one of them was at the climax to the film with a long shot of Eastwood on his motorcycle as he confronts the rogue cops.McGilligan (1999), p.235 As with many of his films, Eastwood was intent on shooting it as smoothly as possible, often refusing to do retakes over certain scenes. Post later remarked: \\"A lot of the things he said were based on pure, selfish ignorance, and showed that he was the man who controlled the power. By Magnum Force Clint's ego began applying for statehood\\". Post remained bitter with Eastwood for many years and claims disagreements over the filming affected his career afterwards.McGilligan (1999), p.236 According to second unit director of photography Rexford Metz, \\"Eastwood would not take the time to perfect a situation. If you've got seventy percent of a shot worked out, that's sufficient for him, because he knows his audience will accept it.\\" Effect The film would launch a number of careers, including David Soul (Starsky & Hutch television series), Robert Urich (S.W.A.T., Vega$ and Spenser for Hire) and Tim Matheson (Animal House and Fletch). Future Three's Company TV star Suzanne Somers can be seen as the topless blonde at the mobster's pool party. Controversy The film received negative publicity in 1974 when it was discovered that the scene where the prostitute is killed with drain cleaner had allegedly inspired the infamous Hi-Fi murders, with the two killers believing the method would be as efficient as it was portrayed in the film. The killers said that they were looking for a unique murder method when they stumbled upon the film, and had they not seen the movie, would have chosen a method from another film. The drain cleaner reference was repeated in at least three other films, including Lethal Weapon (1987), Heathers (1989) and Urban Legend (1998). According to scriptwriter John Milius, this drain cleaner scene was never meant to be filmed, but was only mentioned in his original script. Release Box office In the film's opening week, it grossed $6,871,011 from 401 theatres.Munn, p. 142 In the United States, the film made a total of $44,680,473, making it more successful than the first film and the sixth highest-grossing film of 1973. Theatrical rentals were $19.4 million.\\"All-time Film Rental Champs\\", Variety, 7 January 1976 p 20 Reception The New York Times critics such as Nora Sayre criticized the conflicting moral themes of the film and Frank Rich believed it \\"was the same old stuff\\". Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote, \\"The problem with 'Magnum Force' is that this new side of Harry‚Äîhis antivigilantism‚Äîis never made believable in the context of his continuing tendency to brandish his .44 Magnum revolver as if it were his phallus.

Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 29. Pauline Kael, a harsh critic of Eastwood for many years, mocked his performance as Dirty Harry, commenting that, \\"He isn't an actor, so one could hardly call him a bad actor. He'd have to do something before we could consider him bad at it. And acting isn't required of him in Magnum Force.\\" Gary Arnold of The Washington Post was positive, praising the film as \\"an ingenious and exciting crime thriller\\" with \\"a less self-righteous message\\" than the original Dirty Harry.Arnold, Gary (January 1, 1974). \\"Magnum Force\\". The Washington Post. C1. Gary Crowdus wrote in Cin√©aste, \\"We are left with the comforting assurance that when we need him, Harry (and all the cops like him who do the 'dirty' jobs no one else wants) will be there protecting us from the lunatic fringes of both Left and Right. Sure, Harry may be a little trigger-happy but at least he shoots the right people.

It was originally released in the UK in April 1968 by CBS Records. The album was recorded between June and August 1967. The sessions took place at Abbey Road Studios and Olympic Studios in London. It was received indifferently on release. A single from the album, \\"Time of the Season\\", became a surprise hit in the United States in early 1969. The album gradually achieved fame and has since become one of the most acclaimed albums of the 1960s. It was ranked 100th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.The RS 500 Greatest Albums of All Time : Rolling Stone. In 2020, the album was ranked 243rd on Rolling Stone's revised list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. It was voted number 637 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. Recording and production Odessey and Oracle was recorded after the Zombies signed a recording contract with the UK CBS label. They began work on the album in June 1967. Nine of the twelve songs were recorded at Abbey Road. \\"Friends of Mine\\" was recorded on 1 June, \\"A Rose for Emily\\" was started on 1 June and completed on 10 July (take 5 reduction of take 3), \\"This Will Be Our Year\\" was recorded on 2 June (take 4) and 15 August (horn overdub), \\"Hung Up on a Dream\\" was recorded on 10‚Äì11 July (take 7 reduction of take 3), and \\"Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)\\" was recorded on 20 July (take 1). The Abbey Road sessions used the same Studer four track machine used on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. In late July, when Abbey Road was unavailable, the Zombies temporarily shifted base to Olympic Studios where they recorded \\"Beechwood Park\\", \\"Maybe After He's Gone\\" and \\"I Want Her, She Wants Me\\". They returned to Abbey Road in mid-August to record \\"Care of Cell 44\\" (take 5 reduction of take 4) and \\"Brief Candles\\" (take 10 reduction of take 9) on 16‚Äì17 August and \\"Time of the Season\\" (August, date unknown). The sessions ended in November and the final track to be recorded was \\"Changes\\" (take 5) on 7 November 1967.Zombie Heaven booklet pages 35-36, 49-52, released on Big Beat in 1997 Because the album was recorded to a deadline and tight budget, the Zombies worked quickly in the studio, having rehearsed rigorously beforehand. This meant that there would be no outtakes or unused songs recorded during the sessions. Cello and Mellotron parts were added to \\"A Rose for Emily\\" but left out at the final mixing stage. Colin Blunstone and Paul Atkinson felt disillusioned and tempers flared during the recording of \\"Time of the Season\\". Blunstone was not at all keen on the song. When writer Rod Argent insisted that he sing it a certain way, Blunstone's patience snapped and he effectively told Argent to sing it himself. Blunstone finally sang the vocal as required. Argent and Chris White mixed the album down into mono, but when they delivered the master to CBS, they were informed that a stereo mix was required. The recording budget having been spent, Argent and White used their own money to pay for the stereo mix. One major problem arose when it came time to mix \\"This Will Be Our Year\\" into stereo. Record producer Ken Jones had dubbed live horn parts directly onto the mono mix. With the horns not having been recorded on the multi-track beforehand, a \\"re- channeled\\" stereo mix had to be made of the mono master of this track. The stereo album mix was completed on 1 January 1968. Morale within the band was at a low point at the end of the recording. Two singles, \\"Care of Cell 44\\" and \\"Friends of Mine\\", had been unsuccessful, and the band had a declining demand for live appearances, so after a final gig in mid-December 1967, the band split up. Album sleeve The album sleeve contains a short text by Argent quoting William Shakespeare's The Tempest. The misspelling of \\"odyssey\\" in the title was the result of a mistake by the designer of the LP cover, Terry Quirk (a friend of White's). The band tried to cover this up at the time of release by claiming the misspelling was intentional. Release history Odessey and Oracle was released in the UK on 19 April 1968. Clive Davis, the head of CBS in the US, initially decided not to release the album. However, the US Columbia label had released the single \\"Care Of Cell 44\\" on 21 November 1967 to complete indifference. CBS staff producer Al Kooper had picked up a copy of the album during a trip to London, and when he returned to America and played the album he loved it. He believed it contained three hit singles. At the urging of Kooper the US division of CBS was eventually persuaded to release the album on the little known Date Records subsidiary label in June. Date released \\"Butcher's Tale (Western Front 1914)\\" as a single in the US, feeling that the song's anti-war theme would resonate with record-buyers due to the Vietnam War. The next single, \\"Time of the Season,\\" slowly gained popularity before finally hitting big on the US charts in March 1969. After the song became a hit, Date re-released Odessey and Oracle with severely cropped artwork. This time the album charted, reaching number 95 in the US. By then Rod Argent and Chris White were busy with their new band, Argent. Other versions For the 1997 Zombie Heaven box-set, \\"This Will Be Our Year\\" was given a full stereo mix, albeit minus the horns. This was made possible because the Zombies owned the multi track masters, which are in the possession of Chris White. Alternate mixes of \\"A Rose for Emily\\", featuring discarded overdubs of cello and Mellotron, appear on Zombie Heaven and the 30th anniversary release of the album. Reunion performances Because the band split before the album was released, they never performed any of the songs onstage. However, due to the surprise success of \\"Time of the Season\\", several \\"fake\\" versions of the Zombies were created by unscrupulous promoters in 1969 to cash in on public demand to see and hear the band. The original five-piece line-up reformed briefly in 1997 for the launch party of the Zombie Heaven boxset. They performed \\"She's Not There\\" and \\"Time of the Season\\" at London's Jazz Caf√©. In 2001, Blunstone and Argent resurrected the Zombies as a recording and touring unit with ex-Argent bass guitarist Jim Rodford, his son Steve Rodford on drums and Keith Airey on guitar. The Blunstone-Argent lineup toured for several years, performing a number of songs from the album. There was one final reunion of the original five members in 2004 at a benefit gig for Paul Atkinson, and though Atkinson was very ill, he insisted on performing with them. Atkinson died later that year. In March 2008, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the album's release, the four surviving members performed Odessey and Oracle in its entirety for three shows at the Shepherd's Bush Empire in London. They were joined by Keith Airey, Darian Sahanaja and various friends. The Zombies were insistent on recreating the sound as authentically as possible, hence the extra singers, Sahanaja filling in keyboard and Mellotron parts via use of a Memotron, and Argent himself playing an original mellotron on a couple of numbers. Argent also tracked down a Victorian pump organ dating from 1896 so they could recreate White's \\"Butcher's Tale\\", the original organ having long since been given away or sold by White. The 40th anniversary concerts were sold out and critically acclaimed. One of the shows was recorded, filmed, and released on CD and DVD as Odessey and Oracle (Revisited). The reunion was so successful that they decided to reprise the show on a short four-date British tour in April 2009, playing in Glasgow, Bristol, Manchester, and ending on 25 April at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, which Argent stated would be the very last time the album would be performed on stage, at least until the songs are reverted to public domain. This ended up not being true as the surviving members once again reunited to perform the album in its entirety across America in 2015. In 2016, the band announced that they would do a final tour to commemorate the album's 50th anniversary the following year. In addition, they are also planning a coffee- table book about the making of the album. In 2019, the surviving original members performed the album in its entirety on a string of dates supporting Brian Wilson, including a stop at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles on September 12 and one at the Beacon Theater in New York City on September 26, 2019.https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/brian-wilson-zombies-north- american-tour-dates-832033/ Reception While the album was received indifferently upon its release, it has since gone on to gain a cult following and become a critically respected album. In their retrospective review, Bruce Eder of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, calling it \\"one of the flukiest (and best) albums of the 1960s, and one of the most enduring long- players to come out of the entire British psychedelic boom\\". BBC Music wrote \\"To this day it remains a word-of-mouth obscurity. But by those who know it's held in such regard that the remaining living members of the band are to perform it in its entirety this year, on the fortieth anniversary of its release.\\" treblezine.com wrote \\"Odessey and Oracle, even by today's standards, is impossible to top.\\" Legacy *Paul Weller of The Jam has often named the album as one of his all-time favourites, citing in particular its \\"autumnal\\" sound.

Both songs were also included on Pitchfork Media's list of the \\"200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s\\".

In South Korea, the LJ Torana was produced locally as the Chevrolet 1700 (ÏãúÎ≥¥Î†à 1700, 1972‚Äì1978) and Saehan Camina (ÏÉàÌïú Ïπ¥ÎØ∏ÎÇò, 1976‚Äì1978). Changing tack in Australian motor sport, Holden released the LC Torana GTR XU-1 in 1970, with performance-enhanced drivetrain and handling. From this time through to the release of the Holden Commodore, the Torana remained Holden's most successful sports/performance vehicle, with many victories garnered in rallying and circuit racing. The introduction of the VB Commodore in 1978 was preceded by the arrival of the updated UC Torana/Sunbird twins, but with no sports versions or V8 engine options. The Torana was subsequently discontinued in 1979, followed by the four-cylinder Sunbird in 1980.  First generation   HB  Introduced in May 1967 to replace the HA series Vauxhall Viva in the Australian market, the first Torana model was a mildly facelifted HB series Vauxhall Viva. It featured a two-door body, 12-inch (305-mm) wheels, and a 56-bhp 1.2-litre four-cylinder engine mated to a four-speed gearbox. A Borg-Warner Model 35 three-speed automatic transmission was optional. Drum brakes were fitted front and rear, with power-assisted front disc brakes optional. In terms of styling, the only points of visual difference between Viva and Torana were in the grille and headlamps, the wheel trims, and the badging - otherwise it was very much a straight-forward exercise in badge engineering. Holden's HB Torana sedan was retailed in three model specifications : Torana, Torana S, and Torana SL ... these models effectively mirrored the concurrent larger HR Holden sedans with their three-tiered specification of Standard, Special, and Premier. Holden Torana (HB) S 2-door A 'sports' option package was released in October 1967, called the 'Brabham' Torana, named in honour of the well-respected Australian race-car driver, Sir Jack Brabham, who at the time was the reigning F1 World Champion and Australian of the Year for 1966. The Brabham Torana's engine featured twin CD Zenith-Stromberg carburettors fitted with individual sports air cleaners. Together with a low-restriction exhaust system, power was boosted to . The Brabham option (available only with manual transmission on Torana S or Torana SL) also included wider wheel rims and red-wall tyres, power-assisted front disc brakes, black body accents, and subtle 'Brabham' identification badges attached to the leading edges of the front fenders and to the rear boot lid. In early 1968, a \\"Series 70\\" engine option - equivalent to the ‚Äò90‚Äô option for the British Vauxhall Viva - was added. This engine had a higher compression ratio and higher-lift camshaft (adapted from the Brabham option engine) and a single CD Zenith-Stromberg carburettor, which boosted output to . Power- assisted front disc brakes were standardised with this engine, whilst availability of the automatic transmission option shifted exclusively to the \\"Series 70\\" engine option (no longer available with the standard engine). In September 1968, the '69 Torana' was released, sometimes called the HB Series II. This featured locally made body panels, replacing the imported bodies of the original HB. The model lineup now included a four-door sedan - some media claimed this design was developed in Australia, with four-door bodies shipped back to the UK to be constructed and sold as the Viva saloon. However, the Vauxpedia website, after extensive research with Vauxhall, maintains that the four-door was designed in England, to compete with Ford‚Äôs four-door Escort, and both Holden and Vauxhall made their own body panels for their respective Torana and Viva versions. A collapsible steering column was now fitted, together with a new recessed instrument cluster, new indicator switch, and new steering wheel borrowed from the contemporary full-sized Holden HK-series. These local components replaced the previously imported Vauxhall items. A consequence of using these local components was the loss of the stalk-operated headlight dip switch and horn. The dip switch ended up on the floor, as was the case for full-sized Holdens. Dual-circuit brakes were now standard on all models, though power-assisted front disc brakes were still optional with the standard engine. The Brabham Torana became an independent model in its own right - (option XS5) based upon the Torana S two-door sedan - complete with bold specific 'Brabham Torana' badging front and rear and on the flanks, and new black accent body decoration. Its interior specification included a sports steering wheel (from the contemporary Holden HK Monaro GTS) and uniquely comprehensive dash instrumentation with tachometer and three supplementary gauges. The HB Torana continued until late 1969. Total production was 16,318 with imported panels and 20,243 with the locally manufactured bodies.  Second generation   LC  The next generation of Holden Torana, the LC- series, appeared in October 1969 and was made available with a range of a four-cylinder or six-cylinder engines. The inline six had a capacity of 138 cu in (badged as the '2250'); a 161 cu in engine (badged as the '2600') was optional. The six-cylinder cars had a longer wheelbase (100 inches against the of four-cylinder models),Norm Darwin, 100 years of GM in Australia, 2002, page 276 a more aggressively styled and longer nose to accommodate the larger engines, and offered a choice of three-speed or four-speed manual transmissions or the new locally GM-manufactured 'Trimatic' three-speed automatic transmission. The LC Torana scored Wheels magazine's Car of the Year award for 1969. The four-cylinder engine was initially of 1,159 cc, and offered either . The more powerful Brabham Torana engine was not carried over to the LC-series and the model itself was also discontinued. In July 1971, a bigger overhead cam 1.6-litre engine with was added; this engine was also sourced from Vauxhall in the UK. The 1600 OHC engine option also included a strengthened gearbox. Body styles were based upon the previous HB-series, but the new six-cylinder cars were of a significantly different external appearance. All LC Toranas shared a new body shape rear of the 'B' pillar, but shared windscreen and front doors carried over from the HB-series; further to this, all LC four-cylinder cars carried over HB body panels forward of the 'A' pillar. The LC-series was available in two-door and four-door versions of base (four-cylinder only), S, or SL specification, as well as a two-door sports model called the GTR. The new Torana GTR effectively replaced the previous series' Brabham Torana, but raised the performance level significantly with its uniquely specified '2600S' six-cylinder engine. As for general features, a three-person front bench seat became available as an option for four-door S and SL six-cylinder models. Later in production (July 1971), the 161-ci engine was replaced with a larger 173-ci version (badged as the '2850') which also made it into the last of the LC GTR cars as the '2850S'. In August 1970, the first ultra-performance Torana, the GTR XU-1, was developed by Holden along with Harry Firth of the Holden Dealer Team for competition in popular Series Production touring car racing within Australia, as well as in off-road rallying and unique rallycross events. However, the highlight purpose of the Torana GTR XU-1 was to keep the Holden brand competitive against the larger and more powerful Ford Falcon GT-HO in the Hardie-Ferodo 500 (Bathurst) endurance race that some consider to be the jewel in the crown of Australian motorsport. The LC Torana GTR XU-1 was equipped with a 160-bhp, 186-cu in (3-litre) six-cylinder engine, fitted with three Zenith-Stromberg CD-150 carburettors, cast-iron headers, a performance cylinder head and camshaft, and the heavy-duty Australian-designed four-speed manual gearboxes (available in a number of different ratios) replacing the weaker Opel units. This car also featured an underbody front chassis air dam, a rear bobtail spoiler, wider steel wheel rims, and front disc brakes as standard equipment. The Torana GTR XU-1 proved to be a strong performer on both the road and track due to its favourable power/weight ratio. It soon gained popularity in Australian motor sport and successfully replaced the V8 Monaro GTS 350 as Holden's frontline track race car in 1970, winning many touring car and rally events, but for the famed Bathurst race which Ford won in 1970 and 1971 with its XW Phase Two and XY Phase Three Falcon GT-HOs, respectively. Holden built a total of 74,627 LC Toranas.Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1986, page 114 File:1971 Holden Torana (LC) Deluxe 1200 4-door sedan (2015-07-15) 02.jpgHolden LC Torana Deluxe 1200 4-door File:1970 LC Torana 4 Cylinder.jpgHolden LC Torana SL four-cylinder 2-door File:Holden Torana LC S (16276113181).jpgHolden LC Torana S 2600 4-door File:1970 LC Indy Orange.JPGHolden LC Torana GTR File:Holden LC Torana GTR XU-1.jpgHolden LC Torana GTR XU-1  LJ  In February 1972, the facelifted LJ Torana was introduced with the six-cylinder models now visually associated with the larger Holden HQ series. Many mechanical components were carried over from the LC-series, with some changes to the choice of engines. The four-cylinder Torana retained its 1200 and 1600 engines, but was now also available with a 1300cc unit. The base two-door car was now simply called the Torana 1200, while the 1300 engine equipped the Torana Deluxe model in either two-door or four-door form. The optional 1600 OHC engine was later in the year to be increased in capacity, badged as the 1760 OHC. Otherwise, the 2250 and 2850 engines carried over into the revised six-cylinder Torana models, and the 3300 engine (known as the 202 in the HQ range) was adopted as the engine for the LJ Torana GTR sedan. Gearbox choices remained the same across the range. A race-bred version of the 3300 engine was also fitted to the LJ Torana GTR XU-1, producing well over . By now the XU-1 was equipped with the 202-ci engine and larger CD-175 Zenith-Stromberg triple carburettors, as well as a new close-ratio four-speed Australian-made transmission (which was available as an option on the standard GTR). Also available on the 'Bathurst Special' was an even closer-ratio gearbox and the taller (reduced from 3.36:1 to 3.08:1) rear axle final drive ratio from the standard GTR which increased top speed to 135mph. This gave the nimble XU-1 the power boost it needed to seriously challenge the powerful Ford Falcon GTHO Phase III, which had won the 1971 Hardie-Ferodo 500 production-car endurance race held annually at Bathurst. In the somewhat wet 1972 Hardie-Ferodo 500, the lightweight HDT Torana GTR XU-1 was able to finally claim victory against the heavyweight GT-HO, driven solo for by Peter Brock. This would be the start of the 'Peter Perfect'/Torana legend, and the first of five Bathurst wins for the Torana in its colourful 10-year racing career at Bathurst. The Holden Dealer Team also developed a , 308ci V8-powered version of the GTR XU-1, often erroneously referred to as the GTR XU-2. The V8 Torana did race in Sports Sedan racing in the hands of Brock and Colin Bond, and was extensively road tested by HDT boss Harry Firth and young team engineer/driver Larry Perkins, but the car never made it past the prototype stage. This was due to the 'supercar scare' of 1972, which involved vast political pressure being placed upon Holden, Ford, and Chrysler to abandon their proposed specially built 'Bathurst Supercars', such as the V8 GTR XU-1. This was the result of a media frenzy that was reporting against these soon-to-be released \\"bullets on wheels\\" available to the general public. In effect, all three manufacturers (Holden, Ford and Chrysler) bowed to this pressure, and Holden postponed its introduction of a V8 Torana for two years until the release of the larger LH series Torana in 1974. A total of 81,813 LJ Toranas were built by Holden in Australia, with some exported to New Zealand, but only in six-cylinder form, likely due to the similar four-cylinder Vauxhall Viva HC range being sold there, as well. The 2850SL model, with bucket seats and four-speed floor shift or Trimatic three-speed automatic, was also shipped to New Zealand in CKD kit form for local assembly from 1973, becoming the first Kiwi-built Torana. = South Korea = The LJ Torana formed the basis of the Chevrolet 1700 in South Korea, produced by GM Korea between September 1972 and 1976. Unlike the Torana, the 1700 was also available as a five-door station wagon. Powered by a 1698-cc four-cylinder engine, the 1700 sold poorly in the Korean market with only 8105 units produced; the car was perceived to suffer from high fuel consumption. The suspension was also seen as unsuitable for Korean roads. Due to poor Chevrolet 1700 sales, the car was revised as the Camina in 1976 (General Motors Korea was sold to Saehan Motors in 1976 after management troubles). However, the Chevrolet version continued to sell alongside it until both models were discontinued in 1978. A smaller 1492-cc engine was fitted to deliver better fuel economy than its Hyundai and Kia competitors, but sales did not recover with only 992 cars sold in two years. The 1.5-liter engine offered , enough for a top speed of for the sedan. The station wagon, which retained the 1700 engine, was now called the Saehan Caravan (ÏÉàÌïú Ï∫¨ÎùºÎ∞ò); 966 of these were sold from January 1976 until March 1979. An ambulance version arrived in April 1976. The 1700 and Camina replacement, the 1977 Saehan Gemini, was a development of the Isuzu Gemini (sold in Australia as the Holden Gemini).

To fill the gap before the March 1975 release of the four-cylinder GM world T-car Holden Gemini, the short-wheelbase four-cylinder (1.3- and 1.8-litre) LJ models were given a basic facelift incorporating a body-colour plastic-moulded front grille assembly and revamped rear light lenses. This car was released in February 1974 on the Australian market only, in both two- and four-door forms, as the TA Torana. It was only produced for 11 months with a total production run of 11,304 units.Norm Darwin, 100 years of GM in Australia, 2002, page 281  Third generation   LH  March 1974 had the first completely new Torana body, with the arrival of the larger mid-sized LH series, produced in four-door sedan style only. Despite the larger external size, the car was relatively cramped by mid-1970s standards. It resembled other GM products of its generation, notably the Opel Ascona and particularly in overall size and profile, the FE series Vauxhall Victor. It was unique in that, following the addition of a four-cylinder option in May 1974, the same body style was available with a choice of inline-four, inline-six, or V8 engines, specifically, 1.9-litre Opel four, 2.85- and 3.3-litre Holden 'red' sixes, and 4.2- and 5.0-litre Holden V8s. Low-compression versions of the fours and sixes were also available for export markets. Exports to the Philippines also occurred, where it was sold as the \\"Holden 1900\\".Holden 1900 brochure cover ‚Äì Philippines market, www.flickr.com. Retrieved 14 October 2014 The 5.0-litre engine was reserved for the sporting LH Torana SL/R 5000 sedan. A special build derivative of the SL/R 5000 was the Bathurst-intended 'L34 Option', of which only 263 were built, with a higher-compression engine with stouter components for more power and durability in competition use. The most notable external feature of the L34 was the bolt-on wheel arch extensions, designed to accommodate the larger racing rims and tyres. The L34 option, which was first seen in 1975, proved to be fast and successful, yet fragile, in Australian touring car racing. It was eventually superseded by the evolutionary A9X option made available in the LX Torana series in 1977. The A9X was delivered with a standard 5.0, but used the L34 motor in races which was developed by Repco for the LH SL/R 5000 H.O. L34. The A9X version of the Torana had a larger 10-bolt Salisbury differential with disc brakes and had the option of the Borg Warner Super T10 four-speed. Hardly any cars were delivered with Super T10 option, so in effect the immortalized A9X was a pretty stock car with a better differential and suspension. The LH Torana in L34 form won the Bathurst 1000 touring car race with Peter Brock and Brian Sampson in 1975 and with Bob Morris and John Fitzpatrick in 1976, with the L34 motor being fitted to the A9X, so in effect winning with that car, as well. According to Holden Dealer Team boss Harry Firth, Holden chose to have the V8 engine in the SL/R 5000 developed by Repco on their dyno which led to massive oil surge problems on the race track and had a number of teams, including the HDT, suffer numerous engine failures in both testing and races in 1974. Firth believed that using the same V8 engine he had developed for the stillborn V8 GTR XU-1 would have solved this problem, as the HDT had already cured the oil problems, but Holden ignored his warnings.

Overall, a total of 70,184 LH Toranas were built. A few special models of the LH were built, the somewhat sporting Plus 4 and G-Pak models. The Plus 4 arrived in September 1974 and was an attempt to move a few more of the slow-selling four-cylinder models. The G-Pak, first seen in February 1975, received the 3.3-litre inline- six. Both came with a four-speed manual, sporting instrumentation, and disc brakes in front. New Zealand assembly got off to a troubled start. General Motors New Zealand, which still had a wide four-cylinder Vauxhall Viva/Magnum line on sale, had planned a 2850 six 'S' model with bench front seat and three-speed column manual shift and the 3300SL with bucket seats and four- speed manual or three-speed Trimatic floor shift.The New Zealand government, though, imposed a 60% sales tax (a post-first oil crisis measure) on cars with engines over two litres just as GM launched the LH in mid-'74, and only a few of each were built. The LH was then withdrawn temporarily and relaunched some months later with the Opel 1.9-litre I4 and floor-shift manual or automatic (SL only) gearboxes. Six-cylinder Toranas would never again be built in New Zealand and were only very rare imports after this. GM New Zealand also built local version of the Australian Plus 4 'sports' special edition, but the changes were only cosmetic - bright paint colours, special wheel trims, black stripes and all-black interior trim.  LX  The mildly facelifted LX series arrived in February 1976. Cosmetically, the most obvious changes were to replace the LH's rectangular headlights with round headlights, side window surrounds were changed from body colour to black, and the front Holden badge was enlarged. A two-door hatchback body was introduced as an alternative to the four-door sedan, although the 1,897-cc Opel unit was not offered in the new body style. Soon after its introduction, in July 1976 the LX was subjected to performance-reducing engine modifications to comply with new ADR27A emission regulations. Power outputs (from now on specified in kilowatts, as part of Australia's metrication programme) changed as: * 173/2.85: from to * 202/3.3: from to * 253/4.2: from to * 308/5.0: from to = LX Sunbird = When the LX Torana was introduced, it featured a choice of four-, six-, and eight-cylinder engines. In November 1976Holden Torana LX Technical Specifications at www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au. Retrieved 26 November 2010 the four-cylinder Torana was revised and relaunched as the Holden LX Sunbird.The Holden Heritage - Eight Edition Reflecting the new emissions rules, power from the Opel-sourced engine was down from . From this point, all four-cylinder models were marketed as Sunbirds and the six- or eight-cylinder models as Toranas. The original LX series Sunbird was a single-trim range, with four-speed manual and three-speed automatic transmissions. There were minor trim differences compared to the Torana, notably the grille (with vertical bars) and distinctive chrome wheel covers. It was marketed as a four- door sedan and as a three-door hatchback, unlike the short-lived four-cylinder LX Torana.Holden Sunbird sales brochure T232 of March 1978 The introduction of Sunbird also coincided with the first attempt by Holden to add a handling package to its range of cars. The introduction of 'radial-tuned suspension' (RTS) began with the LX Sunbird sedan and hatchback and then the LX Torana.

This 'A9X Option' was available on the 5.0-litre V8-powered SLR 5000 sedan and SS hatchback models.Australia Muscle Car, Issue 35, page 52 The A9X visually resembled the L34-optioned LH model, but with the addition of a rear-facing bonnet scoop designed to increase airflow into the engine bay (carburettor) to produce maximum power in motor racing applications. The A9X package varied from the old L34 in road form in that whilst the engine was not modified, the A9X nevertheless had some special mechanical features such as rear disc brakes, heavy-duty axles, and a heavy- duty '10 bolt' differential. After being rushed into Group C touring car racing, Peter Brock gave the A9X a dream debut by winning the 1977 Hang Ten 400 at Sandown. However, after he put his Torana on pole position, the A9X ultimately lost its debut Bathurst race in 1977 to the Ford Falcons of Allan Moffat and Colin Bond. The A9X package was soon refined and proved dominant during the following two seasons of touring-car racing in Australia. Drivers Peter Brock and Bob Morris were victorious in the 1978 and 1979 Australian Touring Car Championships, respectively, and A9Xs shared by Peter Brock and Jim Richards won the 1978 and 1979 Bathurst 1000s. In a show of the A9X's superiority, Brock and Richards won the 1979 race by a record six laps, with Brock setting the touring-car lap record on the last lap of the race. Overall, a total of 65,977 LX Toranas were produced by Holden. An A9X recently sold at auction for $500,000.  UC  The introduction of the UC Torana in March 1978 occasioned the demise of V8 power and the cessation of the sporting SL/R variant in the Torana range of cars. The UC series featured a significantly modernised frontal appearance and a completely new interior dash layout. Torana was now rationalised to a choice of two equipment levels and two six- cylinder engines, the 2.85-litre and the 3.3-litre. A 'Deluxe Pack' was an option that allowed the UC Torana SL to compete with Ford's TE Cortina Ghia, which comprised laminated windscreen, tinted side and rear windows, intermittent wipers, radio/cassette player, cloth trim, sports instrumentation, and bumper overriders. While the V8 was discontinued in the UC, a factory sanctioned dealer option of a turbo was offered. This was called the UC SL/T. These were mainly ordered through Suttons in NSW, but one is known to have been ordered through Zupps in Queensland. These were produced in a mini production run of five cars and only 33 were built. Only one is known to exist today that was ordered through Zupps. Holden Sunbird (UC) sedan Holden Torana (UC) SL hatchback The Holden Sunbird was also updated to UC specifications and continued to sell well as a 1.9-litre four-cylinder car, sharing its body architecture with the UC Torana sedan and hatchback. The UC Sunbird expanded into three trim levels: base (manual only), SL, and SL/E. It did very well in New Zealand, where it was assembled, particularly in fleets, where it competed with the Ford Cortina and a variety of Japanese models. SL/E trim was also available in New Zealand. The UCs had square headlamps and a smoother front end. LX and early UC Sunbirds were fitted with a 1.9-litre Opel engine. Later UC models had the locally produced 1,892-cc Starfire Four engine that was also installed into the Australian-produced versions of the Toyota Corona and in four-cylinder versions of the Holden Commodore. . This sluggish motor was simply a crudely cut-down version of the long-running Holden six- cylinder engine. The hatchbacks were deleted in 1979, leaving only the sedans for the 1980 model year. The last Sunbird was built in September 1980.Aussie Cars, 1987 The Sunbird was replaced initially by a four-cylinder version of the Holden Commodore, before the arrival of its natural, albeit smaller, successor, the Holden Camira, from 1982. At one point, design consideration was given to a five-door hatchback version of the UC Torana, which had a similar side profile to the Rover SD1 and rode an extended wheelbase. The idea never got past the clay-modelling stage, probably in most part due to the impending introduction of the GM V-Car, the Commodore. After release of the VB Commodore in November 1978, it soon became clear to GM-H that the Torana was too similar in size when compared to the more modern Holden Commodore. As a result, the UC Torana was soon dropped from the Holden range in 1979. The UC Sunbird continued through 1980 with a new, locally manufactured 1.9-litre Starfire engine (based on the 2.85-litre six) replacing the imported Opel unit. For a while at least, talk of further extending the Torana/Sunbird's production life beyond 1980 occurred, with a facelifted 'UD' model, of which prototype models of the sedan and hatchback were actually built - featuring frontal styling similar to the Opel Ascona B. However, due to the car itself being outdated when compared to the new Japanese opposition (notably the Chrysler Sigma, Datsun Bluebird, and Mazda 626), Holden decided on an easier route by simply introducing the Starfire engine into the VC-series of Commodore sedans and wagons. Ultimately, the title of four-cylinder mid-sized Holden was taken over in 1982 by the Camira, Holden's version of GM's front- wheel drive 'J-Car'. However, the Starfire engine did remain available for another two years in the VH-series Holden Commodore, and continued to be fitted to the VK-series in New Zealand. Just over 55,000 UC series Toranas and Sunbirds were produced.Tony Davis, Aussie Cars, 1986, page 152  Torana concept cars   Torana GTR-X  The Torana GTR-X was designed during the era of the LC series, and was seriously considered for production in the early 1970s. The GTR-X had a wedge-shaped fibreglass body featuring a hatchback rear access, and the prototype cars had LC Torana GTR XU-1 mechanical components. The GTR-X looks similar to iconic sports cars of the 1970s, such as the Maserati Khamsin, Ferrari 308 GT4, Lotus Esprit, and Mazda RX-7. It weighed and has a top speed of . The Torana GTR-X in production would have been the first Holden car to be factory fitted with four-wheel disc brakes. When Holden released a promotional brochure about the GTR-X, they said, \\"Its long, sleek hood is accentuated by a low, wedge-shaped grille. The body line sweeps up at the rear to an elevated tail light assembly. Simplicity is the keynote. It is achieved by concealed headlights, sharp windshield rake, recessed parking and turning lights, and flush petrol filler access and door handles. Front and rear bumpers assume the contour of the body. To identify the car, the GTR-X identification is contained within a crisp black and orange stripe running parallel to the rocker panel\\". The Torana GTR-X was highly developed by Holden from concept, and though brochures, photography and promotional films were produced to show how serious they were in putting the car into production, the company was ultimately unable to justify the high cost of committing itself to production given the size of the Australian population then. The only existing complete prototype GTR-X car has been recently restored back to its original white paint finish and remains on public display at the Salmon Street offices of Holden in Melbourne, Victoria. This car, originally white as pictured, was painted silver in the mid '70s. It had UC Torana SL/E wheels fitted and a few other cosmetic changes (bonnet badge, etc.) in an attempt by Holden to move the car with the times and \\"restore it\\". During this period, it toured motor museums around the country, including the National Motor Museum at Birdwood in South Australia. In 2003, the car was returned to its original build condition (white) by Car Shine in Melbourne, prior to being shipped to the US to the General Motors Technical Center at Michigan for the celebration of automotive design spanning the past 75 years. One other preproduction GTR-X is in the hands of a former long-time Holden employee, along with the body mold jig to make more fibreglass bodies. Whether this car will ever be finished is unknown due to the age of the owner. The picture of this orange car can be seen in Norm Darwin's book release of the Torana, but the name and location of the owner is kept secret to prevent possible theft.  Torana Mystere  In 1977, Recaro built a concept car for the 1977 Sydney Motor Show; the vehicle was based on a Holden Torana LX SS Hatchback. Appearing on the front cover of the October 1977 Modern Motor magazine, the concept was put together by the Recaro Australia managing director David Bones and marketing director Robin Luck (a former editor of Modern Motor). The vehicle was designed and built by Arcadipane Automotive (Peter Arcadipane), featuring a 'Monza' style front end coupled with a rear end that had been shortened by some 355 mm and was powered by a 308-cu in V8 backed up by an M21 four-speed manual transmission. The plan was to release the vehicle once two key issues were ironed out, those being; confirmation of GMH's backing for mechanical warranty and getting the cost of the vehicle below $15,000. In addition to the body modifications, the key unique feature of the vehicle was its interior. Recaro commissioned a special tanner in West Germany to produce sufficient hides to upholster all seats in a unique green colour that was to be a feature of the car's paintwork (however, the cost of this full leather interior formed a significant challenge in meeting the $15,000 target). Only one Mystere was produced. The vehicle has survived and is owned by an enthusiast in Melbourne.  Torana TT36  In 2004, Holden released a luminous, hot pink or \\"ManGenta\\" medium-sized, rear- drive concept car called the Torana TT36 (Twin Turbo; 3.6-litre V6). The project was originally named XP54, reflecting the acronym 'eXperimental Project' and coded 54 in recognition of Holden's so-called Studio 54 design workshop in the outer suburbs of Melbourne. The model was said to debut a new platform for General Motors and previewed the look of the 2006 VE Commodore. By applying twin KO4 Warner turbochargers, an air-to-air intercooler, and variable valve actuation to its Alloytec 190, then dropping the compression to 9.0:1, Holden engineers were able to deliver a power peak of and no less than 480Nm of torque, with 90% available from just 1600 rpm. The prototype first visited the National Motor Museum at Birdwood in the Adelaide Hills in early 2008 and has returned on several occasions, most recently in September 2019.

The term derives from Laconia, the part of the Peloponnesus where the Spartans lived. Admirers of the Spartans typically praise their valour and success in war, their \\"laconic\\" austerity and self-restraint, their aristocratic and virtuous ways, the stable order of their political life, and their constitution, with its tripartite mixed government. Ancient Laconophilia started to appear as early as the 5th century BC, and even contributed a new verb to (literally: to act like a Laconian). Praise of the Spartan city-state persisted within classical literature ever afterward, and surfaced again during the Renaissance. Ancient Laconophilia  Athens In ancient Athens, Laconism began as a current of thought and feeling after the Persian Wars. Some, like Cimon, son of Miltiades, believed that Athens should ally with Sparta against the Persian Empire. Cimon persuaded the Athenians to send soldiers to aid Sparta, when the helots (serfs of the Spartans) revolted and fortified Mount Ithome. The Spartans sent the Athenians home again with thanks, lest democratic Athenian ideas influence the helots or the perioeci.Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War I.102; De Ste. Croix (1972) 76; Plutarch Cimon 16.1ff. Some Athenians, especially those who disliked commerce, preferred a closed society and the rule of the few. They believed that the Spartan constitution was superior to their own. Some even went so far as to imitate Spartan manners by going around Athens long-haired and unwashed, like the Spartiates.Aristophanes, Birds 1281; Plato Comicus Fragmenta 132 (PCG); Epilycus Fragmenta 4 (PCG). Plato's Republic, which is set in the 5th century BC, gives credibility to this claim by having Socrates opine that the Spartan or Cretan type of political regime is the favorite of \\"the many\\".Republic VIII, 544c. A group of extreme Laconising oligarchs, known as the Thirty Tyrants, seized power in Athens in 404 BC and held it for eleven months, assisted by a Spartan army. Their rule, however, was quickly overthrown, and democracy was reinstated.See the article on the Thirty Tyrants for references. In 371 BC, the Spartans were defeated in the Battle of Leuctra. As a result of that defeat, Sparta's allies revolted and the helots of Messenia were freed. Afterward, the Spartan economy became less able to support professional soldiers, and inequalities between supposedly equal citizens increased. As a result, the reputation of Sparta, either as a military success or as a guide in domestic affairs, diminished substantially. Philosophers Lycurgus of Sparta, legendary founder of the city's constitution Laconophiles nevertheless remained among the philosophers. Some of the young men who followed Socrates had been Laconophiles. Socrates himself is portrayed as praising the laws of Sparta and Crete.Schofield (2006) 38-39; Dawson (1992) 58-59, 61, 74, 103-104; Cartledge The Socratics Sparta (1999); Plato, Crito 52e. Critias, a companion of Socrates, helped bring about the oligarchic rule of the Thirty Tyrants, who were supported by Sparta. Xenophon, another disciple of Socrates, fought for the Spartans against Athens. Plato also, in his writings, seems to prefer a Spartan-type regime over a democratic one.See his dialogue the Laws. Aristotle regarded the kind of laws adopted by Crete and Sparta as especially apt to produce virtuous and law-abiding citizens, although he also criticises the Cretans and Spartans themselves as incompetent and corrupt, and built on a culture of war.Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics 1102a7-11. Greek philosophy, therefore, inherited a tradition of praising Spartan law. This was only reinforced when Agis IV and Cleomenes III attempted to \\"restore the ancestral constitution\\" at Sparta, which no man then living had experienced. This attempt ended with the collapse of the institutions of Lycurgus, and one Nabis established a tyranny in Laconia.For (some) references, see the article on Agis IV. In later centuries, Greek philosophers, especially Platonists, often described Sparta as an ideal state, strong, brave, and free from the corruptions of commerce and money. These descriptions, of which Plutarch's is the most complete, vary in many details.See for example: Plutarch Lycurgus; Plutarch Instituta Laconica GreekEnglishEnglish. Many scholars have attempted to reconstruct which parts of these utopias the classical Spartans actually practised, which parts Cleomenes, and which later classical authors invented.Most notably: Ollier (1933); Tigerstedt (1965-72). It became fashionable for the Romans to visit Lacedaemon and see the rites of Artemis Orthia, as a sort of tourist attraction ‚Äì the nearest Greece had to offer to gladiatorial games.Cicero Tusculanae Disputationes II.34. LatinEnglish  Contrary views  Even in ancient cultures, Laconophilia was a tendency, not an absolute. None of the contemporaries of the Lycurgan Constitution praised Sparta without reservations, except the Spartans themselves. Herodotus of Dorian Halicarnassus, consistently portrays the Spartans, except when actually facing battle, as rustic, hesitant, uncooperative, corrupt, and na√Øve. Plato had Socrates argue that a state which really followed the simple life would not need a warrior class; one which was luxurious and aggressive would need a group of philosophers, like Plato himself, to guide and deceive the guardians. Even Xenophon's encomium of the Constitution of the Lacedaemonians is not unalloyed praise.Xenophon Constitution of the Lacedaemonians http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Xen.+Const.+Lac.+14&fromdoc;=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0210 14.1] Aristotle criticises the Spartans in his Politics: the helots keep rebelling; the Spartan women are luxurious; the magistrates (and especially the ephors) are irresponsible; reaching decisions by the loudest yell in the apella is silly; the wealth of the citizens is unequal (so that too many are losing the resources necessary to be a citizen and a hoplite); and the Spartiates let each other evade taxes, so the city is poor and the individual citizens are greedy. Above all, the Spartans know no other arts than war, so in peace they are incompetent and corrupt. The Cretan institutions, he says, are even worse.Aristotle Politics 1269a-1271b Even after the collapse, and idealisation, of Sparta, Polybius wrote, \\"My object, then, in this digression is to make it manifest by actual facts that, for guarding their own country with absolute safety, and for preserving their own freedom, the legislation of Lycurgus was entirely sufficient; and _for those who are content with these objects_ we must concede that there neither exists nor ever has existed a constitution and civil order preferable to that of Sparta.\\"Polybius Histories VI, 50; I,6 Modern Laconophilia Admiration of Sparta continued in the Renaissance. Niccol√≤ Machiavelli agreed that Sparta was noteworthy for its long and static existence, but nevertheless asserted that, for virt√π and glory, Rome was much preferable (Discourses). The Elizabethan English constitutionalist John Aylmer compared the mixed government of Tudor England with the Spartan republic, stating that \\"Lacedaemonia [meaning Sparta], [was] the noblest and best city governed that ever was\\". He commended it as a model for England. The Swiss-French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau contrasted Sparta favourably with Athens in his Discourse on the Arts and Sciences, arguing that its austere constitution was preferable to the more cultured nature of Athenian life. Samuel Adams expressed a disappointment that the American republic was failing to meet his ideal of a \\"Christian Sparta\\".http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch18s14.html Alexander Hamilton mocked the Laconophilia of his era as unrealistic: > We may preach till we are tired of the theme, the necessity of > disinterestedness in republics, without making a single proselyte. The > virtuous declaimer will neither persuade himself nor any other person to be > content with a double mess of porridge, instead of a reasonable stipend for > his services. We might as soon reconcile ourselves to the Spartan community > of goods and wives, to their iron coin, their long beards, or their Black > soup. There is a total dissimulation in the circumstances, as well as the > manners, of society among us; and it is as ridiculous to seek for models in > the simple ages of Greece and Rome, as it would be to go in quest of them > among the Hottentots and Laplanders.University of Chicago Laconophilia increased in importance during the nineteenth century. The development of the English Public Schools was influenced by the schooling of Spartan children,Spartans and Stoics with stiff upper lips as were Ivy League American universities. Sparta was also used as a model of social purity by Revolutionary and Napoleonic France. Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek stated that \\"all modern egalitarian radicals, from Rousseau to the Jacobins‚Ä¶imagined the republican France as a new Sparta\\".  Early Zionism  Early Zionists, and particularly the founders of Kibbutz movement in Israel, had been influenced by Spartan ideals, and drew on the Spartan model in particular when disparaging the materialistic values they associated with the diaspora communities they had left.Land and Power: The Zionist Resort to Force, 1881‚Äì1948, By Anita Shapira, Stanford University Press 1999, 300Kafka and Cultural Zionism: Dates in Palestine By Iris Bruce, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2007, page 170The Making of Israeli Militarism, By Uri Ben-Eliezer, Indiana University Press, 1998 Tabenkin, for example, a founding father of the Kibbutz and the Palmach, was greatly influenced by ancient Sparta. He prescribed that \\"fighters' education should begin from the nursery\\", that children should from kindergarten age be taken to \\"spend nights in the mountains and valleys\\", taught to fight, and educated for war.The Making of Israeli Militarism, By Uri Ben-Eliezer, Indiana University Press, 1998, page 63 Racial Laconophilia =Karl M√ºller= Karl M√ºller A new element was introduced into Laconophilia by Karl Otfried M√ºller, who linked Spartan ideals to the supposed racial superiority of the Dorians, the ethnic sub-group of the Greeks to which the Spartans belonged. While the Greek Laconophiles like Plutarch had praised the Spartans, they did not extend this admiration to the Dorians as a whole. Plutarch argued that the founder of their constitution, Lycurgus, had inherited corrupt Dorian institutions. Argos, the traditional enemy of Sparta, was also a Dorian state; so were Corinth, Rhodes, and Syracuse, three of the most commercial states in Greece. In 1824, however, M√ºller wrote Die Dorier, a history of the Dorian \\"race\\". It has been described as a \\"thousand-page fantasia\\", which portrays the Dorians as a heroic and noble race who expanded into Greece from the north. He used the new disciplines of comparative linguistics and source-criticism to argue that the Dorians represented a distinct ethno-linguistic group whose original culture could be isolated from later influences. He linked the origin of the Dorians to the mythic Myrmidons of the Trojan war, and their leader Achilles. =Nazi Laconophilia= M√ºller's emphasis on the northern origins and racial qualities of the Spartans later fed into the development of Nordicism, the theory of the superiority of a North European Master Race. Later German writers regularly portrayed the Spartans as a model for the modern Prussian state, which also emphasised military self-discipline. It was a short step from this to argue that the Prussians and the Spartans were originally of the same race. Frank H. Hankins summarises views of the American Nordicist Madison Grant, writing in 1916: > Sparta is pictured as particularly Nordic on account of the purity of its > Dorian stock, while Athens is more of a mixture. Sparta thus exhibited the > military efficiency, the thorough organization and the patriotic sacrifice > of the individual to the state characteristic of Nordics everywhere and > exemplified in modern Prussia, while Athens exhibited the intellectual > brilliancy, the instability, the extreme individualism, the tendency to > treason and conspiracy so characteristic of populations having a large > Mediterranean element.Hankins, Frank, The Racial Basis of Civilization, > Knopff, 1926 These arguments were repeated by Nazi race theorists such as Hans F. K. G√ºnther and Alfred Rosenberg. Adolf Hitler particularly praised the Spartans, recommending in 1928 that Germany should imitate them by limiting \\"the number allowed to live\\". He added that \\"The Spartans were once capable of such a wise measure... The subjugation of 350,000 Helots by 6,000 Spartans was only possible because of the racial superiority of the Spartans.\\" The Spartans had created \\"the first racialist state.\\"Hitler, Pol Pot, and Hutu Power: Distinguishing Themes of Genocidal Ideology Professor Ben Kiernan, Holocaust and the United Nations Discussion Paper Following the invasion of the USSR, Hitler insisted that the Slavs should be treated like the helots under the Spartans: \\"They [the Spartans] came as conquerors, and they took everything\\", and so should the Germans. A Nazi officer specified that \\"the Germans would have to assume the position of the Spartiates, while... the Russians were the Helots.\\" Contemporary Laconophilia Modern Laconophilia has been present in popular culture, particularly with reference to the Battle of Thermopylae, as portrayed in films such as The 300 Spartans. It is also evident in the graphic novel 300 and the film derived from it. In the modern world, the adjective \\"spartan\\" is used to imply simplicity, frugality, or avoidance of luxury and comfort.Webster Dictionary http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/Spartan Because of their reputation for physical prowess, the name \\"Spartans\\" has been adopted by teams in several sports. Michigan State University adopted \\"Spartans\\" as their collegiate team identity in 1925. In addition to the Michigan State Spartans, other teams include the San Jose State Spartans, Norfolk State Spartans, and others. Soccer clubs include Sparta Prague (Czech Republic), Spartans (Scotland), ƒ¶amrun Spartans (Malta) and Sparta Rotterdam (Netherlands). See also *Philhellenism References Bibliography *Cartledge, P.

The Music Center's other halls include the Mark Taper Forum, Ahmanson Theatre, and Walt Disney Concert Hall. Since the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and Los Angeles Master Chorale have moved to the newly constructed and adjacent Disney Hall which opened in October 2003, the Pavilion is home of the Los Angeles Opera and Glorya Kaufman Presents Dance at the Music Center. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences held its annual Academy Awards in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion from 1969 to 1987, 1990, 1992 to 1994, 1996, and 1999. History The Pavilion has 3,156 seats spread over four tiers, with chandeliers, wide curving stairways and rich d√©cor.The Music Center, Venue rentals The auditorium's sections are the Orchestra (divided in Premiere Orchestra, Center Orchestra, Main Orchestra and Orchestra Ring), Circle (divided in Grand Circle and Founders Circle), Loge (divide in Front Loge and Rear Loge), as well as Balcony (divided in Front Balcony and Rear Balcony). Construction started on March 9, 1962, and it was dedicated September 27, 1964. The Pavilion was named for Dorothy Buffum Chandler who \\"led (the) effort to build a suitable home for the Los Angeles Philharmonic and rejuvenate the performing arts in Los Angeles. The result was Mrs. Chandler‚Äôs crowning achievement, the Music Center of Los Angeles County. Her tenacious nine-year campaign on behalf of the Music Center produced more than $19 million in private donations\\" noted Albert Greenstein in 1999. The building was designed by architect Welton Becket. The project was an example of his firm's approach of total design, in which he managed all aspects including design, construction, fixtures, and interior finishes to achieve a coherent whole. In order to receive approval for construction from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, Mrs. Chandler promised Kenneth Hahn that the building would be open free for the public for one day a year. The result was the Los Angeles County Holiday Celebration, a Christmas Eve tradition sponsored by the Board of Supervisors. The program is broadcast on KCET-TV and an edited version of the prior year's show is syndicated to public television stations via PBS. The opening concert was held on December 6, 1964 with Zubin Mehta conducting the Los Angeles Philharmonic with soloist Jascha Heifetz. The program included Fanfare by Richard Strauss, American Festival Overture by William Schuman, Roman Festivals by Ottorino Respighi, Beethoven's Violin Concerto. The stage as seen from the balcony at the 62nd Academy Awards in 1990. The Los Angeles Master Chorale, under Music Director Roger Wagner, was the other founding resident company at the Pavilion. Before creation of the Los Angeles Opera company, the New York City Opera came regularly on tour and performed in the Pavilion. One such tour, in 1967, consisted of two performances of Madama Butterfly, one of La Traviata, and two of Ginastera's Don Rodrigo, each with Pl√°cido Domingo singing the main tenor role. The hall's acoustics were controversial during the period the Los Angeles Philharmonic made the pavilion its home. Problems varied depending on the listening location, with the orchestra sounding too loud in some places and too muffled in others. Abe Meltzer, chief consulting acoustician, stated in 1986 that the basic issue was that the Pavilion was a multi-purpose room, rather than one tailored to orchestral concerts. The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion is featured in the 2008 video game Midnight Club: Los Angeles. The site was used as the location for an avant-garde perfume ad directed by Spike Jonze. Annual Holiday Celebration Since 1964, a Christmas Eve tradition for the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion is the annual free Holiday Celebration funded by Los Angeles County. It use to be six hours (from 3 pm to 9 pm) of music and dance by groups from all around Los Angeles county, However, due to financial cuts in the county budgets, the celebration was cut in half to three hours, limiting the performers to no more than two or three musical numbers each. Also, because of the overcrowds, the audience members have to arrive three hours earlier, where they have to wear colored wristbands in order to gain admission. The performances now last from 2pm to 5pm, without any intermissions. The performances are also broadcast on the KCET public television station with a one-hour version broadcast on PBS since 2002.
