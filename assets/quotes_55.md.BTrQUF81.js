Forming as the nineteenth named storm of the season, Doksuri developed as a weak tropical depression over to the east of Visayas on September 10. Meteorological history During September 9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring on a tropical disturbance that had developed about 836 km (519 mi) west-northwest of the province of Eastern Samar.http://ftp.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/wd20vxt/hwrf-init/decks/bwp212017.dat During the next day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression.https://www.webcitation.org/6tPDwn36b?url=http://gwydir.demon.co.uk/advisories/WWJP25-RJTD_201709101800.htm Six hours later, the JMA started to issue advisories on the depression when it had winds of 55 km/h (35 mph). On 21:00 UTC of September 11, the JTWC followed suit, giving the designation of 21W. The JMA upgraded 21W to a tropical storm during September 12, giving the name Doksuri, the nineteenth named storm of the annual typhoon season. By September 13, robust convection had persisted near its low-level circulation center (LLCC) along with deep convective banding and a depicted \\"ragged\\" microwave eye feature. This prompted the JTWC to classify Doksuri as a tropical storm. About six hours later, Doksuri's LLCC became well-defined, and Doksuri strengthened into a severe tropical storm from the JMA. By September 14, strong convection was found to the south of its LLCC as convective banding began to wrap into a nascent eye. Doksuri strengthened into a Category 1-equivalent typhoon. Around this time, Doksuri was already located in an area of low vertical wind shear along with warm sea- surface temperatures of about 30‚Äì31 ¬∞C (86‚Äì87.8 ¬∞F). The JMA followed suit on upgrading Doksuri to a typhoon on 12:00 UTC of the same day. With a slowly- developing eye with constant convection around its LLCC, Doksuri strengthened into a Category 2-equivalent typhoon.

Shortly after when PAGASA began monitoring on the system, they already raised a Storm Signal Warning #1 over in the Southern Luzon portion, including provinces of Camarines Sur and Aurora on September 11. Hours later, Signal Warning #1 was expanded to as west as Metro Manila, as north as Pangasinan and La Union, while every province in Central Luzon (Region III) was in that area. Moreover, local government units declared class suspensions to many places, especially in the capital region and the province of Bulacan for Tuesday, September 12. Domestics flights were already canceled from the Ninoy Aquino International Airport while bus trips were canceled in the Quezon-Aurora area. After the storm, on September 13, officials in the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) had warned residents to refrain from doing outdoor activities over in mountainous areas, especially in Benguet, for possibilities of landslides. Laguna was one of the provinces that got hit hard by the storm as the city was placed under a state of calamity after it had \\"too much rainfall\\" that produced further flash floods and landslides. Malaca√±ang had provided ‚Ç±650 million (US$12.8 million) worth of relief goods and funds for victims while the Department of Health (DoH) had offered ‚Ç±20 million (US$393,000) of supplies for provinces from Cagayan Valley (Region II) down to Bicol (Region V). Over in the Quezon province, three buses and a car were stranded in flooded streets and the 25 passengers in one bus were rescued later that day. Quezon officials deployed rescue boats and military trucks the rescue efforts while the Philippine Army's 2nd Infantry Division has deployed a rescue team in Calabarzon. About 1,857 families or 7,549 people were staying in 116 evacuation centers over in Laguna and Quezon. At least 2,103 families or 8,794 persons were affected in 109 barangays in the regions of Central Luzon, Metro Manila and the Calabarzon. The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) allocated a total of ‚Ç±577.8 million (US$11.3 million) as standby funds for affected families while 18,000 food packs were prepositioned. According to the NDRRMC, a total of 22 people were dead with 4 missing, while damage nationwide were at ‚Ç±267 million (US$5.24 million). Vietnam Typhoon Doksuri was the tenth storm to affect Vietnam and considered it as the \\"most powerful storm in a decade\\". As early as September 13, authorities over the northern and central provinces banned from going to sea. Vietnam was placed under a red warning, which stands for \\"very high\\" risks. Waves as high as 32 ft (10 m) were predicted offshore. Coastal provinces, therefore, announced plans to shut down beaches and ban fishing by September 14. The Red Cross Society has sent missions to Ha Tinh and Quang Binh and mobilized forces to support people in storm-hit areas during September 15. About 1,500 villagers were evacuated over in the Thua Thien-Hue province due to water erosion. In Vietnam's capital city of Hanoi, 33 flights were canceled, while Vietnam Railways canceled seven passenger trains and five cargo trains in the Ha Tinh and Quang Binh provinces. About 80,000 people have evacuated over in Central Vietnam. Doksuri brought wind gusts of up to 135 km/h (82 mph), which cut power and affected a total of 1.5 million people, although the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) measured gusts of up to 160 km/h (102 mph). The provinces of Thanh H√≥a up to Quang Ngai saw total precipitation of 100‚Äì200 mm (3.9-7.8 in), with some reports of high as 300 mm (11.8 in), along with gusts of up to 80‚Äì100 km/h (45-65 mph). Water erosion affected 700 meters of sea dike in a village in Thuan An. Seven fishing vessels and 183 small boats sank while 10 small irrigation dams were damaged. 220 small boats were washed away over in the provinces of Nam Dinh and Quang Ngai. In agriculture, Doksuri affected 4,473 hectares of rice with an additional 8,277 hectares for other crops, as well as 16,108 hectares of aquaculture. Overall, 13,000 hectares of perennial crops were damaged, mostly over in the Quang Binh and Quang Tri provinces. The storm also damaged a total of 10 km of highways and 17.9 km of local roads. A total of 23,968 houses had damaged roofs, especially from the Ha Tinh province.http://tuoitre.vn/do-son-cat-hai-chim-trong-bien- nuoc-vi-bao-so-10-20170915190325928.htm During September 16, Vietnam Electricity resumed power only to seriously affected areas such as Dong Hoi, Quang Binh and Nghe An. On September 17, the Vietnam Red Cross (VRC) offered aid of about ‚Ç´1.5 billion (US$66,000) to six provinces that were hit by the typhoon. Moreover, the Coca-Cola company of Vietnam sent 24,000 water bottles to residents of in the Quang Binh province. Around the same time, 31,000 soldiers and police were mobilized to help residents in hard-hit provinces. By September 19, a total of 1.3 million households had been supplied with electricity again. On the same day, the FLC Group provide a relief of ‚Ç´9 billion (US$396,000) to Nghe An, Ha Tinh and Quang Binh for the recovery of Doksuri. In all,12 people were reported to be dead during the typhoon, along with 215 injury and 4 missing. Total damages from the typhoon reached ‚Ç´16.36 trillion (US$720 million). Quang Binh and Ha Tinh were the worst hit provinces, which lost a total of ‚Ç´13.86 trillion (US$610 million). Vietnam Electricity suffered a loss of ‚Ç´215 billion (US$9.46 million), while damage on the health sector reached ‚Ç´50 billion (US$2.2 million). Other areas Despite making landfall in Indochina, Doksuri affected Hainan and total economic losses were estimated to be CNY100 million (US$15.3 million). Flooding triggered by the storm in Laos killed one person and total damage reached ‚Ç≠55.5 billion (US$6.68 million).http://www.vientianetimes.org.la/FreeContent/FreeConten_Ministry_222.htm See also *Typhoon Dan (1989) *Tropical Storm Lekima (2007) *Typhoon Wutip (2013) * Tropical Depression Winnie *Typhoon Ketsana (2009) similar path and intensity References External links *JMA General Information of Typhoon Doksuri (1719) from Digital Typhoon *21W.DOKSURI from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory 2017 Pacific typhoon season 2017 disasters in the Philippines Typhoons in the Philippines Typhoons in Vietnam 2017 disasters in Vietnam Doksuri ","title":"Typhoon Doksuri (2017)"},{"id":"55251966","text":"DNA encryption is the process of hiding or perplexing genetic information by a computational method in order to improve genetic privacy in DNA sequencing processes. The human genome is complex and long, but it is very possible to interpret important, and identifying, information from smaller variabilities, rather than reading the entire genome. A whole human genome is a string of 3.2 billion base paired nucleotides - the building blocks of life -, but between individuals, the genetic variation differs only by 0.5%, an important 0.5% that accounts for all of human diversity, the pathology of different diseases, and ancestral story. Emerging strategies incorporate different methods, such as randomization algorithms and cryptographic approaches, to de-identify the genetic sequence from the individual, and fundamentally, isolate only the necessary information while protecting the rest of the genome from unnecessary inquiry. The priority now is to ascertain which methods are robust, and how policy should ensure the ongoing protection of genetic privacy.  History  In 2003, the National Human Genome Research Institute and its affiliated partners successfully sequenced the first whole human genome, a project that took just under $3 billion to complete. Four years later, James Watson ‚Äì one of the co-discoverers of the structure of DNA ‚Äì was able to sequence his genome for less than $1.5 million. As genetic sequencing technologies have proliferated, streamlined and become adapted to clinical means, they can now provide incredible insight into individual genetic identities at a much lower cost, with biotech competitors vying for the title of the $1,000 genome. Genetic material can now be extracted from a person's saliva, hair, skin, blood, or other sources, sequenced, digitized, stored, and used for numerous purposes. Whenever data is digitized and stored, there is the possibility of privacy breaches. While modern whole genome sequencing technology has allowed for unprecedented access and understanding of the human genome, and excitement for the potentialities of personalized medicine, it has also generated serious conversation about the ethics and privacy risks that accompany this process of uncovering an individual's essential instructions of being: their DNA sequence.  Research  Genetic sequencing is a pivotal component of producing scientific knowledge about disease origins, disease prevention, and developing meaningful therapeutic interventions. Much of research utilizes large-group DNA samples or aggregate genome-wide datasets to compare and identify genes associated with particular diseases or phenotypes; therefore, there is much opposition to restricting genome database accessibility and much support for fortifying such wide-scale research. For example, if an informed consent clause were to be enforced for all genetics research, existing genetic databases could not be reused for new studies - all datasets would either need to be destroyed at the end of every study or all participants would need to re-authorize permissions with each new study. As genetic datasets can be extrapolated to closely related family members, this adds another dimension of required consent in the research process. This fundamentally raises the question of whether or not these restrictions are necessary privacy protections or a hindrance to scientific progress.  Clinical Use  In medicine, genetic sequencing is not only important for traditional uses, such as paternity tests, but also for facilitating ease in diagnosis and treatment. Personalized medicine has been heralded as the future of healthcare, as whole genome sequencing have provided the possibility personalizing treatment to individual expression and experience of disease. As pharmacology and drug development are based on population studies, current treatments are normalized to whole populations statistics, which might reduce treatment efficacy for individuals, as everyone's response to a disease and to drug therapy is uniquely bound to their genetic predispositions. Already, genetic sequencing has expedited prognostic counseling in monogenic diseases that requires rapid, differential diagnosis in neonatal care. However, the often blurred distinction between medical usage and research usage can complicate how privacy between these two realms are handled, as they often require different levels of consent and leverage different policy.  Commercial Use  Even in the consumer market, people have flocked to Ancestry.com and 23andMe to discover their heritage and elucidate their genotypes. As the nature of consumer transactions allows for these electronic click wrap models to bypass traditional forms of consent in research and healthcare, consumers may not completely comprehend the implications of having their genetic sequence digitized and stored. Furthermore, corporate privacy policies often operate outside the realm of federal jurisdiction, exposing consumers to informational risks, both in terms of their genetic privacy and their self-disclosed consumer profile, including self-disclosed family history, health status, race, ethnicity, social networks, and much more. Simply having databases invites potential privacy risks, as data storage inherently entails the possibility of data breaches and governmental solicitation of datasets. 23andMe have already received four requests from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to access consumer datasets and although those requests were denied, this reveals a similar conundrum as the FBI‚ÄìApple encryption dispute.  Policy  As an individual's genomic sequence can reveal telling medical information about themselves, and their family members, privacy proponents believe that there should be certain protections in place to ultimately protect the privacy and identity of the user from possible discrimination by insurance companies or employers, the major concern voiced. There have been instances in which genetic discrimination has occurred, often revealing how science can be misinterpreted by non-experts. In 1970, African- Americans were denied insurance coverage or charged higher premiums because they were known carriers of sickle-cell anemia, but as carriers, they do not have any medical problems themselves, and this carrier advantage actually confers resistance against malaria. The legitimacy of these policies has been challenged by scientists who condemn this attitude of genetic determinism, that genotype wholly determines phenotype. Environmental factors, differential development patterns, and the field of epigenetics would argue gene expression is much more complex and genes are not a diagnosis, nor a reliable diagnosis, of an individual's medical future. Incipient legislations have manifested in response to genetic exceptionalism, the heightened scrutiny expected of genomics research, such as the 2008 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) in the United States; however, in many cases, the scope and accountability of formal legislation is rather uncertain, as the science seems to be proceeding at a much more rapid pace than the law, and specialized ethics committees have had to fill this necessary niche. Much of the criticism targets how policy fundamentally lacks an understanding of technical issues involved in genome sequencing and fails to address how in the event of a data breach, an individual's personal genome can not be replaced, complicating privacy protection even further. As computational genomics is such a technical field, the translation of expert language to policy is difficult - let alone translation to laymen language -, presenting a certain barrier to public perception about the capabilities of current genomic sequencing technologies which, ultimately, makes the discourse about protecting genetic privacy without impeding scientific advancement an even more difficult one to have. Across the world, each country has unique healthcare and research frameworks that produce different policy needs ‚Äì genetic privacy policy is further complicated when considering international collaborations on genetic research or international biobanks, databases that store biological samples and DNA information. Furthermore, research and healthcare are not the only fields that require formal jurisdiction; other areas of concern include the genetic privacy of those in the criminal justice system and those who engage with private consumer-based genomic sequencing.  Forensic Science  = England and Wales = 91% of the largest forensic DNA database in the world, the National Criminal Intelligence DNA Database (NDNAD), contains DNA information from residents of England and Wales. The NDNAD stores genetic information of criminally convicted individuals, those who were charged but acquitted of a recordable offence, those who were arrested but never charged with a recordable offense, and those who are under counterterrorism control. Of the 5.5 million people in the database, which represents 10% of the total population, 1.2 million have never been convicted of a crime. The European Court of Human Rights decided, in the case of S and Marper v United Kingdom (2008), that the government must present sufficient justification for differential treatment of DNA profiles of those in the criminal justice system compared to that of non-convicted individuals; essentially, there must be no abuse of retained biological materials and DNA-information. The decision highlighted several existing issues with the current system that poses privacy risks for the individuals involved: the storage of personal information with genetic information, the storage of DNA profiles with the inherent capacity to determine genetic relationships, and fundamentally, the act of storing of cellular samples and DNA profiles produces opportunities for privacy risks. As a result, the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 was created to ensure proper use of collected DNA materials and regulate their storage and destruction. However, many problems still persist, as samples can still be retained indefinitely in databases, regardless of whether or not the affected individual was convicted ‚Äì and even the samples of juvenile delinquents. Critics have argued that this long-term retention could lead to stigmatization of affected individuals and inhibit their re-integration into society and also, are subject to misuse by discriminatory behavior innate to the criminal justice system. = Germany = In 1990, the Federal Supreme Court of Germany and the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany decided that sections of the German Code of Criminal Procedure provided justifiable legal basis for the use of genetic fingerprinting in identifying criminals and absolving innocents. The decisions, however, lacked specific details on how biological materials can be obtained and how genetic fingerprinting can be utilized; only regulations of blood tests and physical examinations were explicitly outlined. In 1998, the German Parliament authorized the establishment of a national DNA database, due to mounting pressure to prevent cases of sexual abuse and homicides involving children. This decision rendered as constitutional and supported by a compelling public interest by the Federal Constitutional Court in 2001, despite some criticism that the right of informational self- determination was violated. The court did mandate that DNA information and samples must be supported by evidence that the individual can commit a similar crime in the future. To address the legal uncertainty, the Act on Forensic DNA Analysis of 2005 introduced provisions that included exact and limited legal grounds for the use of DNA based information in criminal proceedings. Some sections order that DNA samples may only be used if they are necessary to accelerate the investigation, eliminate suspects, and a court must order genetic fingerprinting. Since its implementation, there has been a monthly addition of 8000 new sets to the database, bringing into question the necessity of such wide scale data collection and whether or not the wording of the provisions provided effective privacy protection. A recent controversial decision by the German government expanded the range of familial searching by DNA dragnet to identify genetic relatives of sexual and violent perpetrators ‚Äì an action that was previously deemed as having no legal basis by the Federal Supreme Court of Germany in 2012. = South Korea = The National Forensic Service of South Korea and the Public Prosecution Authority of South Korea established separate DNA analysis departments in 1991, despite initial public criticism that the data collection was enacted without considering the informational privacy of subjects involved, a criticism that turned to support with a series of high-profile cases. In 2006, a proposed bill by the General Assembly on the collection and operationalization of DNA information outlined crime categories for the storage, the control, and the destruction of DNA samples and DNA information. However, the bill failed to pass as it could not translate into any significant change in actual practice. The incomprehensive crime categories included were only applicable in obtaining biological information without an individual's consent, and the protocol to destroy collected samples were unclear, exposing them to misuse. The DNA Information Act of 2009 attempted to resolve these weaknesses, including provisions that stated biologically sensitive information may only be collected from convicted individuals, confined suspects, and crime scenes. Genetic fingerprinting was made permissible for specific crimes, including arson, murder, kidnapping, rape or sexual molestation, trespass upon residence at night for stealing, larceny, and burglary, and numerous other violent crimes. The act also required a written warrant for acquiring samples from convicted criminals or suspects if the concerned individuals do not give written consent. All samples must be destroyed in a timely manner if the concerned individual is proclaimed innocent, acquitted, their prosecution is dismissed, and upon their death. Importantly, if collected samples are used to ascertain individuals at the crime scene, the DNA information must be destroyed upon successful identification. However, there are still several flaws and criticisms to this legislation, in terms of clarifying the presumption of innocence, the rather trivial enforcement of sample destruction (only 2.03% of samples are deleted annually) and requisite of a written warrant (99.6% of samples are obtained without a warrant), and there is still much debate about whether or not this legislations violates the right of informational self-determination.  Biobanks  = United States = In the United States, biobanks are primarily under the jurisdiction of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule and the Federal Policy for Protection of Human Subjects (Common Rule). As neither of these rules was conceived with the intention of regulating biobanks and the decentralized levels of regulation, there have been many challenges in their application and enforcement, and federal law fails to directly tackle international policy and how data can be shared outside of the EU-US Safe Harbor Agreement. An area that needs clarification is how federal and state laws are differentially and specifically applied to different biobanks, researchers, or projects, a situation further complicated by the fact that most biobanks are part of larger entities, or in collaboration with other institutions, confusing the line public and private interests. About 80% of all biobanks have internal oversight boards that regulate data collection, usage, and distribution. There are three basic access models applied to the accessibility of biobank samples and data: open access (unrestricted to anyone), tiered access (some restrictions to access dependent on the nature of the project), or controlled access (tightly controlled access). GINA provisions prohibit health insurers from requiring genetic testing or requesting genetic information for enrollment purposes and prohibit employers from requesting genetic testing or genetic information for any type of employment assessment,(hiring, promotion, termination). However, insurers can request genetic information to determine coverage of a specific procedure. Some groups are also excluded from following GINA's provisions, including insurers and employers of federal government employees, military, and employers with fewer than 15 employees. = China = China has a widespread network of hospitals and research institutes. It is currently undergoing a plan to create a more cohesive framework for data sharing among existing biobanks, which was previously under the jurisdiction of overlapping and confusing regulatory laws. Many biobanks operate under independently, or within a network of other networks, with the most prominent being the Shanghai Biobank network. Under this main network, guidelines detail specific de-identification policies and explicitly endorse broad consent. Recently, the Chinese Constitution has formally recognized individual privacy as a distinct and independent constitutional right, and therefore, legislators have begun developing a Draft Ordinance on Human Genetics Resources to organize national laws on biobanking management measures, legal liability, and punishment for violations. International data sharing will be even more strictly regulated under these federal laws. = Australia = Biobanks in Australia are mainly under the regulation of healthcare privacy guidelines and human research ethics committees ‚Äì no formal biobank legislation exists but international data sharing is widely permitted. The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) develops guidelines for and funds many of these institutions. There is discussion towards broad consent for biobanking.  Consumer Genetic Testing  Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy advocate, found that existing legislation does not have formal jurisdiction in ensuring consumer privacy where DNA information is concerned. Genetic information stored by consumer businesses are not protected by the HIPAA; therefore, these companies can share genetic information with third parties, conditions contingent upon their own privacy statements. Most genetic testing companies only share anonymized, aggregated data with users‚Äô consent. Ancestry.com and 23andMe do sell such data to research institutions and other organizations, and can ask for a case-by-case consent to release non- anonymized data to other parties, including employers or insurers. 23andMe even issues a warning that re-identification may take place and is possible. If a consumer explicitly refuses research use or requests for their data to be destroyed, 23andMe is still allowed to use their consumer identifying and behavioral information, such as browsing patterns and geographical location, for other marketing services.  Areas of Concern  Many computational experts have developed, and are developing, more secure systems of genomics sequencing to protect the future of this field from misguided jurisdiction, wrongful application of genetics data, and above all, the genetic privacy of individuals. There are currently four major areas of genetics research in which privacy-preserving technologies are being developed for:  String searching and comparison  Paternity tests, genetic compatibility tests, and ancestry testing are all types of medical tools that rely on string searching and comparison algorithms. Simply, this is a needle-in-a-haystack approach, in which a dataset is searched for a matching ‚Äústring‚Äù, the sequence or pattern of interest. As these types of testing have become more common, and adapted to consumer genomic models, such as smartphone apps or trendy DNA tests, current privacy securing methods are focused on fortifying this process and protecting both healthcare and private usage.  Aggregate data release  The modern age of big data and large scale genomic testing necessitates processing systems that minimize privacy risks when releasing aggregate genomic data, which essentially means ensuring that individual data cannot be discerned within a genomic database. This differential privacy approach is a simple evaluation of the security of a genomic database and many researchers provide \\"checks\\" on the stringency of existing infrastructures.  Alignment of raw genomic data  One of the most important developments in the field of genomics is the capacity for read mapping, in which millions of short sequences can be aligned to a reference DNA sequence in order to process large datasets efficiently. As this high-capacity process is often divided up between public and private computing environments, there is a lot of associated risk and stages where genetic privacy is particularly vulnerable; therefore, current studies focus on how to provide secure operations within two different data domains without sacrificing efficiency and accuracy.  Clinical use  With the advent of high throughput genomic technology allowing unprecedented access to genetic information, personalized medicine is gaining momentum as the promised future of healthcare, rendering secure genomic testing models as imperative for the progress of medicine. Particularly, concerns voice how this process will involve multiparty engagement and access to data. The distinction between genetic sequencing for medicine and research purposes is a contentious one, and furthermore, anytime healthcare is involved in a discussion, the dimension of patient privacy must be considered, as it may conflict or complement genetic privacy.  Encryption Methods   Secure read mapping  Sensitive read mapping is essential to genomics research, as read mapping is not only important for DNA sequencing, but also for identifying target regulatory molecules in RNA-Seq. A solution proposes splitting read mapping into two tasks on a hybridized computing operation: the exact matching of reads using keyed hash values can be conducted on a public cloud and the alignment of reads can be conducted on a private cloud. As only keyed hash values are exposed to public scrutiny, the privacy of the original sequence is preserved. However, as alignment processes tends to be high volume and work intensive, most sequencing schemes still functionally require third party computing operations, which reintroduce privacy risks in the public cloud domain.  Secure string searching  Numerous genetic screening tests rely on string searching and have become commonplace in healthcare; therefore, the privacy of such methodologies have been an important area of development. One protocol hides the position and size of partial substrings, allowing one party (the researcher or physician) with the digitized genome and a second party (research subject or patient) with sole propriety of his or her DNA marker to conduct secure genetic tests. Only the researcher or the physician knows the conclusion of the string searching and comparison scheme and neither party can access other information, ensuring privacy preservation.  Secure genome query  The basis of personalized medicine and preventative healthcare is establishing genetic compatibility by comparing an individual's genome against known variations to estimate susceptibility to diseases, such as breast cancer or diabetes, to evaluate pharmacogenomics, and to query biological relationships among individuals. For disease risk tests, studies have proposed a privacy preserving technique that utilizes homomorphic encryption and secure integer comparison, and suggests storing and processing sensitive data in an encrypted form. To ensure privacy, the storage and processing unit (SPU) stores all the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) as real SNPs - the observed SNPs in the patient - with redundant content from set of potential SNPs. Another solution developed three protocols to secure calculating edit distance using intersections of Yao's Garbled Circuit and a banded alignment algorithm. The major drawback of this solution is its inability of performing large scale computations while retaining accuracy.  Secure genome-wide association studies  Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are important in locating specific variations in genome sequences that lead to disease. Privacy preserving algorithms that identify SNPs significantly associated with diseases are based on introducing random noise to aggregate statistics to protect individual privacy. In another study, the nature of linkage disequilibrium is utilized in selecting the most useful datasets while maximizing protection of patient privacy with injected noise; however, it may lack effective disease association capabilities. Critics of these methods note that a substantial amount of noise is required to satisfy differential privacy for a small ratio of SNPs, an impracticality in conducting efficient research.  Authenticated encryption storage  The nature of genomic sequences requires a specific encryption tool to protect against low complexity (repetitive content) attacks and KPA (Known-plaintext attack), given several expected symbols. Cryfa uses packing (reducing the storage size), a shuffling mechanism (randomizing the symbol positions), and the AES cipher (Advanced Encryption Standard) to securely store FASTA, FASTQ, VCF, SAM and BAM files with authenticated encryption.

His method is, alternatively, both to refuse to look (the killings, made familiar and even banal by their endless cinematic representation, are not depicted) and to look harder than anyone else.\\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-02-05/features/8701090926_1_ed- gein-camera-cinematic By focusing his camera on the sunny tennis courts and barren fields of each setting, Benning indicts the psychological role that each environment (and its inhabitants) might have played in the murders as much as he might the murderers themselves.

It follows the rise and fall of the Telemachus family as its members, each with his or her own unique telekinetic or clairvoyant ability, navigate lives filled with frustrations, hilarity and intrigue. Background Spoonbenders is Daryl Gregory's seventh novel and was inspired by Uri Geller and others who, in the 1970s, appeared on popular television shows claiming to have psychic powers. The title of the book comes from Geller's stage trick of bending spoons. Gregory, who grew up in Chicago, Illinois and now lives in Oakland, California, wanted to write a book that was neither science fiction or fantasy like his previous books. To research the book, Gregory participated in a spoon bending seminar in Los Angeles, California. He attributed the bending more to strength than psychic ability. \\"It just struck me that it's the saddest of the psychic powers. Does anyone really need bent cutlery? There's something about the small scale of it. They're not changing the world. They're just bending spoons.\\" Still, he told a reporter of Californian newspaper The Mercury News of his writing process, \\"I'm never really happy until something weird intrudes\\". Gregory, describes himself as \\"really boring and a skeptic about this stuff\\". He reminds readers at the end of Spoonbenders that \\"None of it's real, folks.\\" Overview Spoonbenders follows the lives of a \\"somewhat dysfunctional and often hilarious\\" Telemachus family. The main characters include: Teddy Telemachus, the patriarch (a con man), Maureen, his wife (a powerful psychic), their three children Irene (a human lie detector), Frankie (a telekinetic), and Buddy (a person who can foretell the future), and Matty, Irene's son who can travel outside his body when sexually aroused by thoughts of his cousin Mary Alice (nicknamed Malice). The story line of Spoonbenders moves back and forth between the 1960s, when Teddy and Maureen meet in a classified ESP study, and the 1990s, when their three children are coping with life and the death of their mother. In the early days, the Telemachus family toured as a group showing off their superpowers. This early success is thwarted when they participate on a television show and are debunked, James Randi style, and discredited. As adult children, Irene, Frankie, and Buddy are struggling to cope. Irene's lie detecting abilities have ruined her relationships, Frankie's telekinesis, rather than help him, has gotten him in trouble with the mob with a get rich scheme, and Buddy's \\"memory of the future\\" has left him verbally paralyzed (he does not want to upset the future) and digging holes in his father's backyard. Irene's 14-year- old son, Matty, too, develops out-of-body experiences while spying on his step-cousin, Mary Alice, and masturbating. Along with threats from the mob, the family is being investigated by a government agent who had worked with Maureen years earlier. Reception The novel was nominated for the 2018 Nebula award. Spoonbenders has received positive reviews from critics who describe it as an unexpectedly funny, charming, touching, and \\"fascinating glimpse\\" into the lives of people who believe they have psychic powers: a magical magic trick of sorts. Gary K. Wolfe, of the Chicago Tribune, wrote: \\"Gregory makes excellent use of the comic potential of hapless superpowers and sets up some intriguing mysteries, but mostly the novel is a celebration of family love and self-protection.\\" The New York Times reviewer, Manual Gonzales, while favorable to the book overall, found the story lacking in a few places when Gregory \\"sped through moments that should linger\\" and \\"left loose ends untied\\". He noted that Maureen McKinnon's storyline could have been developed further. While Amal El-Mohtar of NPR found Matty's behavior toward his step-cousin \\"sleazy and not endearing\\", Gonzales mentioned that Mary Alice (Malice), \\"spends most of the novel gothy and removed\\" and then shows up in the final act of the book sympathetic, forgiving, and willing to \\"help Matty project\\".

(1986) He was the project-leader of the exhibition Initatief 86 which took place in the St. Pieters Abbey and the Museum of Contemporary Art of Ghent in 1986. This was an exhibition on Belgian art for which Kasper K√∂nig, Jan Hoet, Jean-Hubert Martin and Gosse Oosterhof made the selection.

The exhibition contained about 80 artworks, was complex and layered so that the different interrelations between the artworks became almost endless. Bart Cassiman was the project-leader of the section Contemporary Visual Art of Antwerp 93, European Capital of Culture. For this temporary organization he realized three major projects which differed in terms of intent and content. For the Middelheim Museum he invited ten artists (Per Kirkeby, Richard Deacon, Panamarenko, Thomas Sch√ºtte, Juan Mu√±oz, Matt Mullican, Bernd Lohaus, Harald Klingelh√∂ller, Didier Vermeiren, Isa Genzken) to make a work, which was bought by Antwerp 93 for the permanent collection. They were placed on Middelheim Low, which became by doing so the section of contemporary art of the museum. A section invented by Cassiman and realized with the support of Bob Cools (The Mayor), Eric Antonis (the intendant of Antwerp 93) and Hans Nieuwdorp (the director of the Art Historical Museums of the City of Antwerp). This project became known as New Sculptures. alt= For the first time, the Royal Museum of Fine Arts hosted contemporary artists who gave form to entwining of remembrance and imagination in the creative process.

Amongst others in Geneva he participated at the symposium ' (25-26 February 1989, Centre d‚Äôart contemporain) and in Stuttgart at A new spirit in curating (25-26 January 1992, K√ºnstlerhaus). He was a member of the studygroup which prepared the symposium Writing about art (1991, Van Abbe Museum, Eindhoven). At the occasion of the publication Art, gallery, exhibition. The gallery as a vehicle for art, edited by gallery Andriesse and De Balie, Amsterdam, he took part in the symposiums organized in Amsterdam (7 September 1996), Rotterdam (8 September 1996) and Antwerp (8 October 1996). In Brussels (25-26 October 1996) he participated at the colloquium Art et commande publics, organized by Encore Bruxelles.  The Absent Museum  alt= From 1989 until 2000 he was responsible for the BACOB bank collection of contemporary art. The collection contained at the end about 180 works of around 40 different international artists, a.o. Stan Douglas, Franz West, Herbert Brandl, Lili Dujourie, Cristina Iglesias, Thomas Sch√ºtte, Harald Klingelh√∂ller, Allan McCollum, Narcisse Tordoir, Helmut Dorner, Luc Tuymans, Jan Fabre, Bazilebustamante, Jean-Marc Bustamante, Thierry De Cordier, James Welling, Juan Mu√±oz, Jan Vercruysse, Mitja Tu≈°ek, Gert Verhoeven, Stephen Wilks, Dianne Hagen, Jan Van Imschoot, Robert Suermondt, Carla Klein, Niek Kemps, Alicia Framis, Isa Genzken, Ebru √ñzse√ßen, Gregor Schneider, Valerie Mannaerts, Bjarne Melgaard, Mike Kelley, Carlos Amorales, Miroslav Balka. Due to a severe illness Bart Cassiman was forced to stop all his professional activities at the end of the nineties. Without any doubt one can say that he was one of the most active and energized persons of the artworld between the mid-eighties and the end of the nineties. With colleagues such as Saskia Bos, Ulrich Loock, Julian Heynen, Dennis Zacharopoulos and a few others he was responsible for the visualization of a generation by making exhibitions and writing texts and convincing many museums and collectors to buy their works. The bank for which he collected more than a decade bought as a result of his engagement and advise the well-known Vanderborght building in the heart of Brussels, at the end of the nineties. Everything was prepared to open the first private (corporate) museum on this scale in Western Europe. The opening was planned for the spring of 2002. But because the engine of this whole operation fell silent the project died a quiet dead. Big parts of the collection were sold and so stays the capital of Europe deprived of an urgently needed Museum of Contemporary Art‚Ä¶  References   Further reading  Bart Cassiman (1984)  Primary sources * Cassiman, Bart; Martin, Jean-Hubert; K√∂nig, Kasper; Oosterhof, Gosse; Hoet, Jan.

Background Raised in Antu County, Jilin, Jiang Tao played basketball at an early age but always had a predilection to football, later entering the Jilin Institute of Physical Education and becoming one of coach Zhang Yuanqing's favorite players. Competing in the Under-17 National Football Championship with his school, he steered them to a 9th-place finish out of 32 teams. Jiang's father was a government official and his mother ran a grocery. On November 16 2001, the Jilin Institute of Physical education was visited by a deputation from Sinchi FC to recruit players. Enticed by the idea of playing abroad and studying at the same time, Jiang agreed to go and his family providentially had the wherewithal to pay for the stint, which costed over 100,000 yuan. Sinchi FC Originally in the third team, the defender was promoted to the clubs Prime League and S.League teams by 2004, starting to feature in official matches. On 10 March 2004, while in an evening training session Jiang was struck by lightning and collapsed. The 18-year old was pronounced dead by medical personnel 10 minutes after the incident. As a tribute, all the S.League fixtures that week were started with one minute's silence beforehand and his family were given a solatium of 600000 yuan by the Football Association of Singapore. The Singapore government also launched a fundraiser to support Jiang's parents and all the money generated from Sinchi FC's game tickets that week were given to them. The former player's body was cremated on 15 March 2004.

Cytokines are a family of secreted proteins that function in inflammatory and immunoregulatory processes. The protein encoded by this gene binds to several chemokine receptors, including chemokine binding protein 2 and chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5). CCR5 is a co-receptor for HIV, and binding of this protein to CCR5 inhibits HIV entry.

It is currently a part of the operating fleet at the Steamtown National Historic Site in Scranton, Pennsylvania for use on excursion trains. History During the first 19 years of its existence, the 26 worked at the Baldwin Locomotive Works plant in Eddystone, Pennsylvania. Painted in Baldwin's standard olive green with aluminum trim and lettering livery, the 26 labored hauling raw materials and completed locomotives around the plant with at least two other identical sister locomotives (numbers 21 and 24). Other locomotives of this design were built for the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, Lehigh and New England Railroad, and General Steel Castings. Following the end of World War II, the 26 was purchased by the Jackson Iron and Steel Company of Jackson, Ohio, becoming their number 3 in 1948.https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/steamtown/shs2a.htm While working at JI&S;, the locomotive's career is relatively unknown, but the locomotive's career is known to have lasted unusually late for a steam locomotive in revenue service, before being retired in the 1970s.https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/steamtown/shs2a.htm In 1979, the locomotive was purchased by Jerry Jacobson who saved the locomotive from scrap with only hours to spare; the scrapper hired to cut up the locomotive already had his gear in the enginehouse in preparation to dismantle the locomotive. Preservation In 1983, Jacobson had the locomotive moved from Jackson, first to Grand Rapids, Ohio, then to the Mad River & NKP Railroad Museum in Bellevue, Ohio where it was painted as Nickel Plate Road 17. Three years later in 1986, Jacobson traded the switcher with the Steamtown Foundation of Scranton, Pennsylvania for their ex Canadian National 4-6-0 No. 1551.https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/steamtown/shs2a.htm Later that same year, Steamtown was taken over by the National Park Service becoming Steamtown National Historic Site. The locomotive arrived at Scranton in January 1990 and was renumbered back to Baldwin Locomotive Works 26. After arriving at Steamtown, the 26 erroneously painted black with white lettering albeit in the same style as her original Baldwin Locomotive Works livery. Prior to the official opening of Steamtown National Historic Site, the 26 frequently ferried passengers between the temporary visitors center and the former Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad roundhouse and turntable complex then undergoing renovations to become the permanent visitors center, museum, and locomotive storage and servicing facility for the park. Following the completion of the museum complex in June 1995, 26 ceremonially \\"cut\\" a ribbon laid across one of the yard tracks during the official opening ceremony. Rebuild and Return to Service Following the official opening of the park, the 26 became the primary power on Steamtown's short Scranton Limited trains between the museum complex and just beyond the former DL&W; Scranton station. She also ran the \\"Nay Aug Gorge Limited\\", which travels past the former DL&W; Scranton station, and stops on the outskirts of the city just before the Nay Aug tunnel at Nay Aug Park. She also occasionally ran trips to Carbondale, Pennsylvania. In 1999, the 26 entered Steamtown's shops for its FRA-mandated 5-year inspection where it was discovered that the entire inner firebox, and portions of the boiler were in imminent need of replacement. Park management decided to rebuild the 26 and the locomotive was completely disassembled. During the disassembly process, it was discovered that the locomotive's frame was bent. The ensuing overhaul, which lasted 17 years, saw the rebuilding of the locomotive's running gear, replacement of the firebox, straightening of the frame, re-boring of the cylinders, and other various preventative maintenance.https://www.nps.gov/stea/planyourvisit/blw26.htm While the 26 was down for rebuild, Steamtown was forced to use its two mainline locomotives, Canadian National 3254 and Canadian Pacific 2317, to substitute for the switcher, this ate into the flue time of both locomotives, particularly the 2317, whose flue time expired in 2010. 3254 became the park's only operable steam locomotive during the 2011 and 2012 seasons; however near the end of the 2012 season, 3254 was discovered to have serious frame issues, which necessitated an early retirement of the locomotive.

Standing tall in the center of Francis Quadrangle and at the south end of the Avenue of the Columns, they are the remains of the portico of Academic Hall. Along with Jesse Hall, they are one of the most photographed sites in Missouri. The Columns have been at the center of many traditions and events including graduations, concerts, pranks, weddings, and protests. Mizzou's school song mentions the columns, and they have been the setting for a work of fiction. They are a contributing structure to the Francis Quadrangle National Historic District. The columns underwent preservation work in 2017. History Academic Hall was constructed in 1840‚Äì1843 as the first building of the University of Missouri and the first public university building west of the Mississippi River. Accountant and architect Stephen Hills, who also designed the first Missouri State Capitol Building, designed the hall. The hall's columns were made from limestone drums from the Hinkson Creek Valley south of the campus. When Academic Hall burned to the ground in 1892, the columns remained standing. In the next few months after the fire, many people thought that the Columns were an eyesore that blocked the view of the new buildings (Red Campus) being constructed on the Quadrangle. Some even worried that they were structurally unsound and a safety hazard. In August 1893, the Board of Curators issued a resolution that called for the Columns to be demolished \\"as soon as convenient\\". A local newspaper reported that Gideon F. Rothwell had ordered two mule teams to pull down and remove the Columns. Jerry S. Dorsey, a leading Columbia citizen, led a protest against their removal, saying that \\"the Columns could not be pulled down by a herd of elephants\\". Rothwell replied that the columns were coming down \\"even if he had to dynamite them.\\" Dorsey obtained a judicial writ that halted the immediate destruction of the Columns, and an architect said they would be structurally sound. The protest from Columbia citizens and the reassurance that the Columns did not pose a safety hazard led Rothwell and the other curators to have a change of heart in December 1893, and the Columns remain. In 2017, the columns underwent a major preservation effort. In the 2017 fall semester, the University of Missouri offered a class called \\"The Geology of the Columns\\". Traditions At the beginning of the academic year, freshmen participate in Tiger Walk to symbolize their move from the wider community to the university by walking through the columns. Tap Day occurs under the columns, when the schools secret societies announce their new members. Appearances in art and literature A mural of James S. Rollins and the Columns is located in the office of the Missouri Governor in the Missouri State Capitol. They are also featured in a monumental stained-glass window titled Missouri at Peace located in the Missouri House Chamber.

This outbreak of violence occurred in the Sasanian Empire under Yazdegerd II. Prior to discussing the martyrdoms of 446 it gives a short account of the history of the region. The History extends back as far as such mythological and semi-mythological characters as Sargon of Akkad, Nimrod, Ninus, and Belos. It presents a confused account of the history's origins, mixing history and mythology. The persecution which makes up the core of the History of Karka came as a part of Yezdgard II's efforts to ensure obedience among his aristocrats, and his demands included participation in religious observances that Christians were forbidden to participate in. As a result, the persecution fell on aristocratic Christians, rather than specifically upon clergy or members of the general population. The aim was not so much to destroy Christianity as it was to enforce loyalty among the nobility.

On September 15, 2017, Stockley was found not guilty of first-degree murder, and protests erupted in St. Louis. Incident Smith was previously convicted for drug distribution and unlawful possession of a firearm, and was out on probation for a theft charge at the time of the incident. Police officer Stockley and his partner have stated they saw Smith engaged in a drug deal. Dashcam footage from their police cruiser recorded Smith reversing his car into their vehicle twice before driving off. A car chase lasting three minutes ensued, ending when Stockley's partner, on Stockley's recommendation, rammed Smith's car. Stockley was recorded during the chase as saying \\"going to kill this motherfucker, don‚Äôt you know it\\". After the car was stopped, Stockley and his partner, Brian Bianchi, approached Smith's vehicle at West Florissant and Acme Avenues in north St. Louis. Witnesses testified and dashcam footage showed that Stockley yelled at Smith through the driver side window of Smith's vehicle to open the door. Stockley testified that Smith did not comply but rather appeared to be reaching around the interior of his vehicle in search of something which Stockley believed to be a gun. Stockley testified that Smith's demeanor suddenly changed, which Stockley believed indicated that Smith had found the alleged gun. Stockley then opened fire through the window and shot five times, killing Smith. The judge's ruling in subsequent criminal case found that the \\"[a]fter Smith is removed from the Buick, Stockley gets in on the driver's side;...The evidence at trial was that Stockley got into the car to search for a weapon, and Stockley testified that he found a handgun tucked between the seat and center console.\\" Page 17 of the ruling by Judge Timothy J. Wilson in State of Missouri v. Jason Stockley, Missouri Circuit Court, 22nd Judicial Circuit, September 15, 2017, as published on web site of the Belleville News- Democrat, retrieved September 29, 2017. In 2013 the St. Louis police board settled a wrongful death suit with Smith's survivors for $900,000. Criminal charges and trial Jason Stockley was charged by St. Louis City prosecutors with first-degree murder in May 2016. He was arrested at his home in Houston, Texas. During the trial, the prosecution had argued that the revolver found in Smith's car had been planted by Stockley to justify the shooting. However, in his ruling, St. Louis Circuit Judge Timothy Wilson said the prosecution's argument was not supported by the evidence. DNA experts testified that the gun recovered had no trace of Smith's DNA on it, and Stockley's DNA was present. The only DNA found on the gun in Smith‚Äôs car had a profile similar to Stockley‚Äôs, but, as the prosecution said, that does not conclusively prove that Smith did not touch the gun. Judge Wilson stated he found it difficult to believe the gun was concealed and planted by Stockley given the entire incident was on video and Stockley was not wearing a jacket. Wilson also noted Smith's DNA was found on the heroin in the car and that during his 28 years on the bench \\"an urban heroin dealer not in possession of a firearm would be an anomaly.\\" Before this case, the judge had \\"ruled both for and against police during his 28 years on the bench.\\" Defense lawyers and prosecutors interviewed by the Associated Press described him as \\"objective and well-respected\\". Protests Prior to the verdict, a group of clergy publicly stated that an acquittal would result in \\"mass disruption\\" in the city. Missouri Governor Eric Greitens, who was openly critical of his predecessor Jay Nixon's response to the Ferguson unrest, preemptively activated the Missouri National Guard and scheduled 12 hour shifts for the St. Louis Municipal Police. On September 15, 2017 protests erupted when Stockley was found not guilty of murder. Some of the protests turned violent. After declaring the protests an \\"unlawful assembly\\", police officers were pelted with water bottles and rocks. Protesters also descended upon mayor Lyda Krewson's home, and threw bricks at and vandalized it. Police deployed tear gas to break up the crowd and two officers were injured by bricks thrown by protesters. Over the night, ten police officers were injured and thirty-two protesters were arrested. Protesters in attendance reported not hearing an order of dispersal before tear gas, and an estimated 250 people who took shelter in a nearby synagogue described being \\"held hostage\\" under threat of arrest. The next day, the band U2 and singer Ed Sheeran both cancelled their weekend concerts in St. Louis out of safety concerns over ongoing protests. Protests during this day were largely peaceful, as demonstrators marched through two nearby shopping malls and into the streets. However, a small group of protesters at the Delmar Loop in St. Louis refused to disperse after the police asked them to leave. These protesters broke windows and threw objects at the police, who arrested nine people. Protests continued on September 17 in the late afternoon, beginning outside the St. Louis police department, and demonstrators marched through the streets. In the night, event organizers told the protesters to go home, though a few dozen continued protesting. After a police officer made two arrests near the police department, the crowd confronted the police line and broke windows. Police response to protests was criticized as unconstitutional and excessive force by the American Civil Liberties Union following a video release of law enforcement officers chanting \\"Whose streets? Our streets\\" after kettling several people downtown. In a press conference, interim police chief O'Toole described the kettling incident positively, saying that \\"police owned tonight.\\" Mayor Lyda Krewson expressed gratitude to the police and cancelled town halls that were scheduled through the following week.

The city of Springfield donated the golf course to the government. Adjacent to the 160-acre property was the Pythian Home of Missouri built by the Knights of Pythias. The Army, using an order of immediate possession, bought the \\"castle\\" from the Knights of Pythias for $40,625 which was half of its assessed value. The castle was renovated and converted into the Enlisted Men's Service Club. The army built a ballroom, bowling alley and gymnasium inside of the building. Part of the basement of the castle was converted into a prison for Italian and German prisoners who required medical care. Construction of the hospital was overseen by Major Michael Grimaldi, constructing quartermaster, at a cost of almost two million dollars. Construction of the facilities was completed in four months. The commander of the post was Colonel George B. Foster Jr. who declared on May 15, 1941 that it should be a \\"hospital with a soul.\\" The hospital got its name from former Surgeon General Robert Maitland O‚ÄôReilly.

The Germans lost the Siege of Tsingtao, and the Michael Jebsen was scuttled in Jiaozhou Bay in November 1914 to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy. Nevertheless, the Japanese refloated the ship. On July 16, 1915, they rechristened the ship K≈çsh≈´ (ËÜ†Â∑û), Japanese for \\"Jiaozhou\\", where it had been taken from. K≈çsh≈´ served as a simple cargo ship for the duration of the war. K≈çsh≈´ was refitted to have surveying equipment in 1921, and formally had its classification changed to survey ship in 1922. From 1921 to 1926, the K≈çsh≈´ surveyed the South Seas, where the Japanese Empire had acquired a number of islands taken from the Germans and been given a League of Nations mandate to rule them as part of the South Seas Mandate. On April 1, 1940, the ship was dismantled due to its old age and removed from service.  Oddities  This photograph of the Marshall Islands, likely with K≈çsh≈´ in the background, was originally published in the travel guide Umi no seimeisen: Waga nannyou no sugata At some point in the service of K≈çsh≈´ during the late 1920s or early 1930s, it likely visited Jaluit Harbor in Japan's South Seas Mandate for the Marshall Islands. A photograph of Jaluit Harbor shows a ship flying the Japanese flag in the background and K≈çsh≈´ written on the ship, although several ships had this somewhere in its name. This would normally not be terribly interesting, but the identity of the ship in the photograph became a dispute after the airing of Amelia Earhart: The Lost Evidence, which claimed the ship was the K≈çsh≈´ Maru, a military ship that had been sent to capture Amelia Earhart, and that the photograph had likely been taken in 1937 or 1938. Japanese blogger Kota Yamano, who discredited a number of other claims the documentary made, said he believed the ship in the photograph to be the old survey ship K≈çsh≈´ instead; other analysts believed that the photograph, based on other clues, likely was taken in the late 1920s or early 1930s.

She inherited her titles from her uncle, Charles de Brimeu, Count of Meghem, when he died in 1572, becoming the Countess of Meghem. Her second marriage in 1580 to Charles III, Prince of Chimay, elevated her to the rank of Princess.  Life   Family and early life  Princess Marie de Brimeu of Chimay was the niece of Charles de Brimeu, Count of Meghem (1556‚Äì1572). He was her paternal uncle and she inherited his titles when he died without direct descendants. She thus became, among other titles, Countess of Meghem. She was born in 1550 in Megen (Meghem), a small town on the river Meuse, in the Duchy of Brabant, Habsburg Netherlands (it is now in the province of North Brabant, the Netherlands). She was the younger daughter of George de Brimeu, Lord of Quierieu (d. c. 1572), Charles' younger brother, by his second wife, Anna van Walthausen; her older sister was Marguerite de Brimeu. She spent much of her early life in Mechelen, where her family had a large house behind the cloth hall. From her early life she developed an interest in gardens and plants, and in February 1571 sent a letter and plant material from Antwerp to the botanist Carolus Clusius in Mechelen, whom she had recently met there, suggesting that she had already established a garden in Antwerp. Another botanist, Matthaeus Lobelius, also refers to her Antwerp garden.  Marriages  Her first marriage, shortly before the end of January 1572, in Megen, was to Lancelot de Berlaymont, Lord of Beauraing (c.1550‚Äì1578), second son of Charles de Berlaymont, who styled himself Count of Meghem in his wife's right. His father was an important public figure in the Netherlands, being a counsellor of Margaret of Parma, Governor of the Netherlands (1559‚Äì1567). As a fellow Catholic, he supported the Spanish Habsburgs in their struggle against the northern insurgents following the Dutch revolt of 1568. From 1570 he fought as a captain in a number of campaigns, and he was made governor of the fortress of Charlemont at Givet. In 1578 both he and his father died during the siege of Philippeville. She had two children from this marriage, both of whom died in infancy. Following her first husband's death, she adopted Calvinism, but remarried into another Catholic noble family, this time of higher rank. On 3 September 1580, in Aachen, she married Charles III de Cro√ø (1560‚Äì1612), Prince of Chimay, at 20 years old ten years her junior. She persuaded her husband to convert to Protestantism. On 12 June 1582, the couple were forced to flee from Li√®ge, due to persecution of Protestants, eventually reaching the Protestant stronghold of Sedan, where they found refuge with Fran√ßoise de Bourbon, sister of Charlotte de Bourbon, William I of Orange's wife. It was at Sedan that Charles formally adopted Protestantism. From there the couple moved to Calais, Vlissingen and finally Antwerp, where they joined William I. Marie de Brimeu separated from her husband in 1584, when he returned to Catholicism. When they separated the States General on 13 September 1584 ruled that she had the rights to all her possessions, but this led to lengthy legal proceedings. From 1584 she resided in a number of Dutch cities, including Middelburg, Delft, Utrecht, Leiden and The Hague. She led a very independent life as a wealthy woman, even though her estranged husband unsuccessfully attempted to poison her in 1586. She found herself in good standing with the Earl of Leicester, whom Elizabeth I appointed as Governor General of the United Provinces of the Netherlands (1585‚Äì1587), and his followers, including Anna Walburgis van Nieuwenaer.  Single life  She spent much of her time on hunting and cultivated her gardens and special plants. Her family position placed her in the highest circle of the nobility of Southern Netherlands, but spent much of her life in the Northern Netherlands. In 1593, the States General requested that she move to The Hague to be closer to the court. Efforts continued to achieve a reconciliation between her and her husband, and an agreement was reached in 1600, by which she returned to the south, settling in Li√®ge, where she also established a garden. Her last years were spent in ill health, and despite frequenting spas she died in Li√®ge in 1605 at the age of 55, and was buried at the church in Megen.  Life and times  Marie de Brumeu was born into a French-speaking aristocratic Catholic family, the house of Meghem, in the Duchy of Brabant, which was one of the Seventeen Provinces of the Habsburg Netherlands. Her family had been faithful adherents of the Dukes of Burgundy who had been the rulers of the Duchy, and at the time of her birth, the Duke was Charles II (Emperor Charles V). Before she reached adulthood, Phillip II had succeeded his father and the Netherlands had become plunged into turmoil in the Dutch Revolt. Calvinism was gaining ground, and the authorities were becoming increasingly repressive, introducing a local inquisition. Shortly after her second marriage, the northern provinces declared independence as the Dutch Republic (1581‚Äì1795) and the Duchy of Brabant was split between the two sides, with Megen in the new Protestant republic. Her life and work took place during a tumultuous time in the Low Countries, the Eighty Years War (1568‚Äì1648), but also a time of great intellectual development in the world of botany, referred to as a botanical Renaissance. Botany also provided one of the few areas at the time where men and women could both participate, and women could be acknowledged as experts.  Work  She was known for her contributions to botany and horticulture, and was a member of the scientific network of Carolus Clusius from her acquaintance with him in Mechelen in the 1570s. Their correspondence, of which 27 letters to him have been preserved, forms a valuable source of information concerning the knowledge of botany at that time. Despite the difference in their social status, Marie de Brimeu was Clusius' closest and almost lifelong woman friend, and she reminded him that Justus Lipsius had called him \\"the father of all the beautiful gardens in this country\\". She developed an expertise in horticulture and creating gardens that attracted great interest throughout both the Southern and Northern Netherlands, and was an example of the intellectual and humanist philosophies in the Dutch Republic at that time, in which beauty could be appreciated for its own sake. In 1590, when she moved to Leiden, she lived in a house next to the Hortus Botanicus of Leiden University, where Clusius would take up his position as prefect and professor in 1593. In addition to Clusius, she formed associations with other scholars such as Lipsius and many likeminded noblewomen, including her sister, Louise de Coligny (widow of William I), Madame Brederode, Madame Matenesse, Madame DeFresne and Anne de Lalaing, widow of Willem de Hertaing, Seigneur de Marquette. Several of these women were also correspondents of Clusius, sharing an interest in botany regardless of religious difference. She used her influence at the court and in Leiden University circles, among other things, to provide Clusius with an appointment in Leiden. In her Leiden garden, she cultivated different types of tulips and other exotic plants. After she moved away from Leiden, she continued her correspondence with Clusius and they exchanged plants. Her work was noted by other botanists, such as Matthaeus Lobelius, who refers to her in his Cruydtboeck (1581) as one of the more important Flemish tulip growers. Lobelius provided her with a catalogue from which she could order plants from Britain. Her diplomatic and political life involved her in the Dutch revolt after her first marriage.  Legacy  The flower genus Brimeura was named after her by Richard Anthony Salisbury in 1866.

The band originally intended to release their second album on this date, but pushed its release back.  Reception  Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic gave a positive review, saying, \\"After delaying their anticipated sophomore LP -- which was expected in late 2017 -- American pop trio Echosmith instead released the EP Inside a Dream. Issued as an appetizer to tide over their fans, the seven-song release is an interesting, though not entirely surprising, departure from the early, more guitar-based style found on their debut, Talking Dreams. Here, the Sierota siblings -- Sydney, Noah, and Graham -- push synth-pop to the fore, creating a blend that sounds like 1989-era Taylor Swift fronting the 2017 incarnations of PVRIS or MisterWives. ... As a preview of potential things to come, Inside a Dream offers just the right amount to satisfy and to build anticipation for a full-length effort that should mark a new and refreshing direction for the group.\\" Variety writer Taryn Nobil said the EP's music \\"sticks to the band's catchy pop pastiche while highlighting a shiny layer of dance-ability.\\" OrbitPop raised the question of what the band was actually doing, saying, \\"For one, the EP is far longer than most EPs at seven songs and in the EP Echosmith celebrates their ability to create a cohesive album, proving that the art of the album is not dead quite yet. There has been speculation that singles will overtake the popularity of creating an album that tells a cohesive story, but in listening to 'Inside a Dream' it‚Äôs clear that it‚Äôs not a lost art at all.\\"  EP announcement  Originally, Echosmith's upcoming sophomore album was set to be released on this date, but the band announced over their social media networks that the full-length album's release would be pushed to spring 2018. Instead, they would release a 7-song EP in its stead, stating, \\"... we've been overrun with inspiration lately and have more we would like to add to the album.\\" They also postponed the Inside a Dream Tour to coincide with the full album's - at the time - tentative release date of March 30, 2018.

Nu was a speaker at the Institute of Noetic Sciences International Conference in July 2017 in Oakland, California.  PSI-Posium  In 2015, Nu held a unique three-day conference in Las Vegas called PSI-Posium, in which the position of magic from both the perspective of illusion and reality was discussed and contemplated at length. John B. Alexander, Ph.D., wrote of the conference, \\"The common theme for the weekend was that real magic is not only possible, it occurs regularly and it is up to the individual to recognize it when it happens. ... Adroit and superbly skilled in their craft, organizers and participants alike both demonstrated established ingenuity and contemplated taking their performances to a higher level. There were a few card tricks shown that entailed either forces or considerable digital dexterity that require a high degree of proficiency. But true to the premise of the seminar it was also indicated that there are times in which neither are required because the operator does get a mental signal. Psychokinesis is one of the more contentious topics in the world of magic. Most stage magicians and scientists claim that mind over matter is simply impossible. They generally discounted offhand demonstrations of 'spoon bending' or psychokinesis metal bending (PKMB). Based on the accomplishments of Uri Geller, aerospace engineer, Jack Houck, developed a process by which regular people could engage in such an experience and called it a PK Party. Rather than watching a performance groups could try it themselves. Displayed at PSI Posium were items that bent totally devoid of physical force by naive subject (non-magicians). A critical point is creating a belief that these things can happen - then they often do. Yes, there are numerous tricks and they can look very authentic. But sometimes, and only on occasion, do macro-psychokinetic event happen that defy explanation.\\"  Bibliography  Books by Nu, sold as nonfiction * State of Mind: The Man Who Knows Reveals The Secrets of Mind Over Matter!

The six variations are nominally on a French ariette, \\"H√©las, j'ai perdu mon amant\\" (\\"Alas, I have lost my lover\\") by Antoine Alban√®se, an Italian-born French singer and composer. However, it appears that Mozart misnamed the melody used, which was actually entitled \\"Au bord d'une fontaine\\" (\\"By the edge of a fountain\\"). The NMA points out that no French tune bearing the title \\"H√©las, j'ai perdu mon amant\\" ever existed. The melody also existed far earlier in France than Alban√®se's version, since at least the sixteenth century. It is thought to have been written for Mozart's aristocratic piano student, Marie Karoline, Countess Thiennes de Rumbeke.

The illustration also appeared in Harper's Weekly and the Illustrated London News. Mouat claimed that Grant's picture depicted the \\"mild, gentle, and benevolent\\" expression perfectly. John Andaman or Jack Andaman (captured January 1858 and returned in the same year) was the name given to an Andaman native (or Mincopie as then termed) who was taken captive aboard a British navy ship near Interview Island on a survey of the Andaman Islands under Frederic J. Mouat. He was taken to Calcutta and returned to the place of his capture when ill health began to torment him. It has been suggested that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle described Tonga, an Andamanese native character, in his 1890 novel The Sign of Four based on Mouat's description of John Andaman.  Context and capture In 1858, a British survey was undertaken to identify a suitable penal colony to deal with the large numbers of prisoners taken in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The Andaman Islands were chosen. Although the islands had been surveyed by Robert Hyde Colebrooke and Archibald Blair in the past, it had not been permanently settled by the British. The survey aboard the Pluto began in November 1857 and was led by Frederic J. Mouat, George Playfair and Lieutenant J.A. Heathcote. The team also included French photographer Oscar Mallitte. When the group landed on Interview Island (Long Reef Island), they had judged to be a safe and friendly island on the accounts of J.H. Quigley titled Wanderings in the Islands of Interview, (Andaman), Little and Great Coco (1850). Mouat had asked Quigley if he would be interested to join the mission but he had refused. Quigley had reported the islanders to be very friendly and had written fantastic accounts of tigers, deer and fabulous plants which later led Mouat to make comparisons of the author with Baron Munchausen. While ashore, the team was attacked by the natives armed with arrows. They made a rapid exit and a second armed navy cutter moved in to keep the natives away. Heathcote was injured by an arrow to the thigh and in defence Mouat was forced to shoot a man he called the \\"chief\\". The natives finally pulled back but not before at least three were killed of which two of the bodies were taken aboard the navy boat. One of the natives, a strong swimmer, had managed to get quite close to the boat and when offered a strap and rope, he took it and came aboard. The crew called him \\"Jack\\" and the captive found company in Neptune, the dog aboard the ship, an animal he was unfamiliar with. Calcutta In Calcutta, they found that John Andaman recognized none of the words in the vocabulary of the Andamanese compiled by R.H. Colebrooke. He imitated well and learnt to dress (to the point that he began to be ashamed of nudity, his original state), wash and always behaved with propriety. When shown a photograph of himself, he laughed and turned it around to see if his back was seen as well. Lady Canning wrote that he was \\"gentle and tractable and imitates everything and is amused at everything from a glass of water upwards\\". Pictures of John Andaman appeared in many places including the Illustrated London News. Careful anthropological measurements were taken of John and published in the journals of various scholarly journals. Mouat had photos of the two dead natives taken (and a copy went to Alexander von Humboldt who confirmed their racial classification as \\"Negrilloes\\") and their skulls were preserved and taken with him to London where they were studied and described by Professor Richard Owen in 1863. As for John Andaman, the government report stated:  Repatriation  John suffered in Calcutta and frequently took ill. He had cholera and then a lung infection leading to a decision by the Governor General to have him sent back from where he had been taken. There had been hope that he would spread the message of his captors' kindness among the natives with whom the British had failed to make any peace. Nothing was heard again about John. Fifty copies of the photographs taken by Oscar Mallitte both on the journey to the Andamans as well as at Calcutta were made and these were thought to have been lost until one set was discovered in 2005 by a new curator appointed to the Queen's Collection at Windsor Castle. The set includes three photos of John Andaman including one in which he is dressed in a navy uniform. In his novel The Sign of Four (1890), Sir Arthur Conan Doyle uses deprecating language that has been considered to be very similar to that used by Mouat to describe the character Tonga, an Andamanese. Doctor Watson reads a description of the Andamans from the Imperial Gazetteer of India of 1881 by W.W. Hunter which is in turn based on descriptions by others. The description quoted by Doyle reads: References  External links  * Photograph of John Andaman by Oscar Mallitte in the Royal Collection Ethnology Cultural politics Ethnological show business ","title":"John Andaman"},{"id":"55256229","text":"Sree Narayana College, Cherthala, is a general degree college located in Cherthala, Alappuzha district, Kerala.

She was the third woman in New Zealand to be admitted to the bar to practise law as a barrister and solicitor. Hemus also held positions with the National Council of Women of New Zealand and was a prominent member of the Auckland Theosophical Society.  Early life  Hemus was born in Auckland on 11 November 1876, to Charles Hemus (a photographer) and Gertrude Evangeline Edger (a sister of Kate Edger, the first woman New Zealand to earn a university degree in New Zealand). Both her parents were immigrants from England and highly involved in theosophy. Their family home in Ponsonby was a centre for discussion and educational groups. Hemus was educated at Ponsonby College, passing the matriculation examination in 1893 and the Senior Civil Servants Examination in 1895. She also studied shorthand with the Auckland Shorthand Writers' Association. Hemus went on to study law at Auckland University College.  Career  In 1898 she became an articled clerk with Christopher James Parr, a sole practitioner. She was the first woman in Auckland to hold such a position. She later moved to work with the firm Neumegen and Elliott. Hemus was admitted as a barrister and solicitor on 15 February 1907. At some point she left Neumegen's firm and opened a sole practitioner's office. Hemus was treasurer of the Auckland branch of the National Council of Women for most of the 1930s, and held the position of branch President from 1938 to 1941. In 1940, in her role as President, she sent a letter to Justice Minister HGR Mason, recommending the appointment of women associates in Magistrates' Courts for domestic proceedings. Hemus also served as treasurer for the New Zealand executive of the Theosophical Society. She often spoke at the Theosophical Society public lectures, on topics such as \\"The Power of Thought\\", \\"Justice or Mercy, Which?\\", \\"The change that we call death\\", and \\"Prohibition: Some points of view\\". She was instrumental in the establishment of the Vasanta Garden School, which opened in Epsom in 1919, and was based on theosophical ideas of education. She continued as President of the Vasanta Garden School Trust Board during the 1930s.

Over 160 people were arrested during the first three days of demonstrations, with largely peaceful protests. There has been significant criticism around the police and governmental response to protests, resulting in lawsuits from the ACLU. Timeline of events September 15 Police at 2017 St. Louis protests Eye wash station for protesters Roughly 200-300 demonstrators assembled in downtown St. Louis near the city courthouse. The protests were mostly peaceful. Police used pepper spray to drive back protesters on at least two occasions: after protesters responded angrily to the approach of buses filled with police in tactical armor (riot gear), and after individuals mounted an abandoned police vehicle and damaged its windshield. Demonstrations later moved to the Central West End neighborhood, where they swelled to over 1,000 people. They were peaceful until about 9:45 pm, after protesters made their way to the home of mayor Lyda Krewson. Despite urgings from demonstration leaders, at least one protester put a rock through the mayor's window. The mayor is believed not to have been home. Although most demonstrators dispersed immediately, police deployed pepper spray and tear gas, driving back remaining demonstrators and onlookers through the Central West End's commercial area. There, angered protesters damaged several businesses. A total of 33 people, 32 of whom were local, were arrested and charged with crimes ranging from peace disturbance to destruction of property. The US Justice Department announced that no federal investigation will take place.http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/doj-shifts-from- collaborative-reform-doctrine-toward-trump-s- law/article_c3b1daa7-7dbb-5607-82d8-55ff0660460d.html September 16 On the afternoon of September 16, protesters marched through a shopping center in the St. Louis suburb of Des Peres and blocked a road.

September 23 Protesters marched through the Saint Louis Galleria in Richmond Heights before St. Louis County Police said it ordered the demonstrators to disperse. Police made 22 arrests. One officer and two protesters were injured during the incident. Some protesters alleged that the police did not give the dispersal order. September 29 A group of protesters attending a baseball game between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Milwaukee Brewers at Busch Stadium unfurled a banner which depicted a cardinal, to match St. Louis‚Äô baseball mascot, with #ExpectUs written across the bird's jersey and the bird holding a ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù sign, and read at the bottom \\"Stop Killing Us.\\" The protesters were removed from the stadium by police.

However, after dark, many agitators began to destroy property and assault police officers.\\" The mayor herself earlier stated, \\"I am sobered by this outcome.

I encourage St. Louisans to show each other compassion, to recognize that we all have different experiences and backgrounds and that we all come to this with real feelings and experiences.\\" Missouri Governor Eric Greitens warned protesters they could be arrested for property damage if further violence occurred. He issued a strong condemnation Saturday night in a Facebook post stating, \\"In the past, our leaders let people break windows, loot, start fires. They let them do it. Not this time. Tonight, the police arrested the vandals. At this moment, they're all sitting in a jail cell. They're gonna wake up and face felony charges. These aren‚Äôt protesters, these are criminals.

Meadows is a boundary rider for Triple M's Australian Football League (AFL) coverage, and was a presenter and commentator across the Fox Sports network for nine years, covering Australian rules football, cricket and basketball. She also co-hosted the short-lived revamp of the Nine Network program The Footy Show in 2019. Early life and education Meadows was born and raised in Collie, Western Australia, and supports the Fremantle Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). She has two older brothers: Ross, who played hockey for Australia, and Ian, an actor best known for his role on Home and Away. Meadows studied journalism at Curtin University and completed a diploma in broadcasting at the West Australian Academy of Performing Arts. She also studied in the United States at the University of Tennessee on a student exchange program. Career Meadows began her career as the weekend sports producer at Perth radio station 6PR in 2006 before spending four years at the Seven Network as a sports reporter on Today Tonight. She was a panel member on the Network Ten program Before the Game, alongside Andrew Maher, Mick Molloy, Dave Hughes and Anthony Lehmann, in the program's final year in 2013, and has also appeared on the association football-themed comedy show Santo, Sam and Ed's Total Football and the game show Have You Been Paying Attention?. In January 2016, Meadows recorded an interview on the ABC program 7.30 regarding inappropriate comments made by Jamaican cricketer Chris Gayle towards her and fellow sports reporter Mel McLaughlin (who worked for Network Ten at the time). In March 2017, Meadows spoke out against Herald Sun chief football writer and fellow Fox Footy presenter Mark Robinson about an article he wrote describing premiership co-captain Erin Phillips kissing her wife at that year's AFL Women's awards ceremony as \\"a touch sensual for a number of men\\". In 2017, she joined Fox Footy's inaugural AFL Women's commentary team, and also joined Triple M for its coverages of AFL and cricket, as well as Fox Sports for its National Basketball League (NBL) coverage for the 2017‚Äì18 NBL season. Meadows hosted the Fox Sports program Game Day Live, where she spoke to Australian sportspeople from a variety of sports, and the Fox Footy program AFL Tonight, where she spoke to players and other personalities involved in the AFL. In 2018, she also began co-hosting the Fox Footy program On the Mark, alongside Sarah Jones and Kelli Underwood. In February 2019, the Herald Sun reported that Meadows was in talks with the Nine Network to become the female co-host of the revamped AFL Footy Show, which she would juggle with her usual Fox Footy commitments. She was confirmed as co-host in March 2019, reuniting with Anthony Lehmann from their work on Before the Game. However, the show was cancelled just seven episodes into the new season following weeks of poor ratings. In October 2019, Fox Sports parted ways with Meadows due to alleged cost-cutting, which came as a surprise to media and fans alike; Foxtel boss Patrick Delany defended the decision by saying, \\"We have plenty of women on the network and from time to time people go [...] people don‚Äôt have jobs for life\\". In January 2020, Meadows rejoined the Nine Network for its coverage of the 2020 Brisbane International and 2020 Australian Open as a court announcer and post-match interviewer. Later that month, she joined ESPN Australia for its coverage of the Super Bowl LIV in Miami.

Racist Anonymous applies the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous with a modification on Step 1: it says, \\"I have come to admit that I am powerless over my addiction to racism in ways I am unable to recognize fully, let alone manage,\\" (\\"Racists Anonymous\\") as compared to the \\"We admitted we were powerless over alcohol--that our lives had become unmanageable\\" of AA.

Becker and Carl Becker Jr.) (1919 ‚Äì January 30, 2013) was an American luthier and restorer, known for restoring the ‚ÄúLady Blunt‚Äù 1721 Stradivarius violin. He had the reputation of ‚Äúone of America's finest violin makers‚Äù and ‚Äúthe dean of American violin-making‚Äù. Carl F. Becker was a founding member of both the International Association of Violin and Bow Makers (Entente Internationale des Luthiers et Archetiers) and the American Federation of Violin and Bowmakers. Several important American luthiers trained under his guidance including Peter Beare, Eric Benning (of Benning Violins), Charles Rufino, Sebastian Zens and Samuel Zygmuntowicz.  Biography  Carl F. Becker was born in the family of Carl G. Becker in 1919 in Chicago. He started apprenticing with his father at age 16, while still at school, making cello ribs. After graduating from high school in 1937 he worked for William Lewis & Son Co. under his father‚Äôs supervision. In 1941 Carl Becker was called into the military service and joined United States Air Force where became a trainer of other pilots, finishing his military career at the rank of Major. After World War II ended, he continued the family tradition of violin-making. From 1946 to 1968 Carl Jr. worked with his father for William Lewis & Son. The Strad magazine reports that the couple made their first ‚ÄúCarl Becker and Son‚Äù violin in 1948 however it wasn‚Äôt until the 1968 when they opened their own shop in a multi-level building on Belmont St. in Chicago that served as the family's shop as well as their home. Their shop was offering new instruments, valuable old Italian instruments as well as repair and restoration services. With the few exceptions, all ‚ÄúCarl Becker and Son‚Äù violins constructed between 1946 and 1975 were made jointly by father and son who divided the labor (Carl Sr. was responsible for the arching, while Carl Jr. did the carving of neck and scroll). Together they made over 500 instruments. After the death of his father in 1975 Carl Jr. made by himself only 13 instruments. Much of his violin-making happened at the secluded cabin in Wisconsin by Lake Pickerel, where he worked in a studio over the garage and practiced muskie fishing. His time in Chicago was devoted to repairing and restoring violins. During 1970 and 1971 Carl Becker Jr. restored the famous ‚ÄúLady Blunt‚Äù 1721 Stradivarius violin for Tarisio Auctions. Shortly after that, the violin sold at an auction for the record amount of $201 000. Carl F. Becker's children, Jennifer and Paul, continued the family tradition of violin making. Jennifer started her first violin in 1966, at age 11 and completed it at age 15. In 1970 (at the age of 16) she joined the company full-time. In 1978 she moved to Minneapolis and started her own violin making business. Paul Becker joined the company in 1971 at the age of 14. He is the current owner of ‚ÄúCarl Becker and Son‚Äù. Carl Becker died on January 2013 at the age of 93.

Early life  Law was born in Burntisland, Fife, Scotland on 23 October 1870, to Catharine Morton and her husband William Law, a commercial traveller. Her sister Mary Blythe Law was born in 1873. In the early 1880s Law moved to New Zealand with her mother and sister. Law assisted her mother who ran a ladies' seminary in Remuera. Law studied piano under Professor Carl Gustav Schmitt, and violin under Herr Von Zimmerman, and became a music teacher herself. She won the Amateur Opera Club's scholarship in harmony. She went to England to continue her studies, and became a licentiate of the Royal Academy of Music, London. She returned to New Zealand to teach.  Career  Law was a music teacher in Auckland and Devonport. In 1902 Law gained a part-time position working as a music teacher at the Jubilee Institute for the Blind, where her sister already worked. The Institute was the first organisation in New Zealand to provide education services for the visually impaired, and included residential care, education, and skills training, to enable blind people to increase their independence. Law taught the piano and used braille to help her students study and pass their examinations, producing several high-quality musicians. Musical performances played a crucial part in raising funds for the Institute, particularly during the depression. The existing Institute band was all-male, and Law was instrumental in forming a corresponding girls orchestra, which performed regularly between 1929 and 1939.

It was written and produced by Labrinth, with additional production from Nathaniel Ledwidge. The song was released through Syco Music on 15 September 2017. It was featured in an Apple Watch Series 3 commercial prior to its release. Background The song was adopted in an Apple Watch Series 3 commercial, titled \\"Roll\\", which was debuted during an Apple event on 12 September 2017. However, viewers were unable to identify the song, as audio-recognizing apps, including Shazam, failed to recognize the song. After a series of speculation on social media, Labrinth revealed that it is his song, as well as one of those from his forthcoming album. Labrinth told Billboard: \\"I feel like I have music to share with the world so I'm so ready to make it to that international level so that's pretty much where I'm at right now, and it feels like all the opportunities that are lined up are based on that. So I'm just mega-excited about sharing what I've been creating for such a while.\\" On the album, an alternate version of the song appears, titled \\"Misbehaving - The Misfit Version \\". Critical reception Anna Tingley of Billboard felt the song's \\"heavy, upbeat, synthesized beat\\" and \\"Labrinth's crafty lyrics\\" fits the commercial, as it narrates \\"the reckless behavior of the commercial's characters\\". She predicts that being featured in an Apple commercial \\"may prove a formative step that launches him into international stardom\\". Jon Pareles of The New York Times called it \\"a zany four-minute romp\\", praising Labrinth for combining funk, soul, reggae, trap and electro timelessly in the song.

It stars Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen as four friends who read Fifty Shades of Grey as part of their monthly book club, and subsequently begin to change how they view their personal relationships. The film was released on May 18, 2018, by Paramount Pictures, and received mixed reviews from critics, but the performances of the film's cast were widely praised and it was a box office success, grossing over $104 million worldwide against its $14 million budget. Plot Four women have attended a monthly book club for 30 years, bonding over the suggested literature, and have become very good friends. Vivian, who owns and builds hotels, runs into Arthur, a man whose marriage proposal she turned down 40 years before. They begin a flirtation, but Vivian has always refused to settle down because she enjoys her independence. Diane is recently widowed, and her daughters would like her to move closer to them in Arizona because they perceive her to be in danger because she's living alone. Sharon is a federal judge who's been single since she divorced her son's father over 15 years ago. Carol has a successful marriage to Bruce, who has recently retired, but they have recently lacked intimacy. One day, they read Fifty Shades of Grey and are turned on by the content. Viewing it as a wake-up call, they decide to expand their lives and chase pleasures that have eluded them. While flying to visit her daughters in Arizona, Diane meets Mitchell and they strike up a relationship, though Diane is hesitant because of how recently her husband died and because she hasn't dated in decades. Vivian spends more time with Arthur, but her fear of commitment makes her keep him at a distance. Carol is frustrated with her husband's refusal to have sex with her, and by reading the book she realizes they are missing something. Sharon starts an online dating account to start dating again. They continue to read Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed in their book club, while trying to figure out how to solve their problems. Diane's daughters continue to pressure her to move to Arizona but she doesn't want to leave her friends. She sneaks away to see Mitchell, and when her daughters can't reach her, they send the police out to find her. On discovering her at Mitchell's, they insist that she move into the basement of one of their homes, essentially ending her relationship with Mitchell. Eventually, Diane tells her daughters that though she is older, she doesn't need to be under surveillance. She packs up her belongings and leaves for Mitchell's, where they resume their relationship. Arthur asks Vivian to commit to being in a relationship and she declines, despite Arthur's assurances that he wants her to continue being independent. Soon after Arthur leaves for the airport, Vivian realizes she's made a mistake and tries to go after him. She misses his airplane, but when she returns to her hotel, she finds Arthur waiting for her and they rekindle their relationship. Carol, frustrated that Bruce is refusing to have sex with her, tries various ways to entice him, but he's completely oblivious. Eventually she spikes his beer with erectile dysfunction medication in his drink, but he becomes angry because that is not what's causing the problem, and they continue to not have sex. Bruce admits that he's been stressed because he retired, and doesn't know what to do with himself. They eventually reconcile after dancing together in a fund-raising talent show. After a few dates with men she meets online, Sharon decides that it isn't for her. She gives a speech at her son's engagement party, where she realizes that everyone deserves to be in love and happy. She opens her online dating account again, in the hopes of finding someone.

In the late 17th century the castle was demolished and used for the building of Woodhouselee, which has also since disappeared. Structure The castle was on a high rock. Only three cellars and a ruined wing remain of an L-plan tower. The remaining structure is long by wide over the walls, and high inside. A small structure on the site is believed to have been a kitchen. Tradition The ghost of Lady Hamilton, dressed in white, and searching for her baby, is said to haunt the ruins.

The club operates four senior men's teams, a colts side as well as a full range of junior teams (ages 6‚Äì17). The men's 1st XV currently plays in Midlands 2 West (North). History Walsall RFC was formed in 1922. Historically part of Staffordshire they were first members of the North Midlands Rugby Football Union before joining the Staffordshire Rugby Union as it became established in the 1960s. In the 1970s and early 1980s Walsall would become one the most successful clubs in Staffordshire rugby winning the inaugural Staffordshire Senior Cup during the 1976‚Äì77 season and would go on to win the cup 5 times in the first 10 years of the competition. The advent of league rugby in 1987‚Äì88 saw Walsall placed in Courage Midlands 1, which was the top division of the region, ranked at tier 5 of the English rugby union system. The club did not stay in this division for long and in 1988‚Äì89 they finished as champions and gained promotion to the national leagues, to what was then known as Area League North (now National League 2 North). The 1990s were a chaotic time in the English league system due to RFU restructuring and this was both to Walsall's benefit and detriment as they yo-yoed between the divisions, dropping to division 5 in 1993‚Äì94, all the way up to division 3 (the highest level in the club's history) by 1996‚Äì97, before settling back into division 4 by the turn of the century. They would also re-establish themselves back at the top of the local game with another 3 victories in the Staffordshire Senior Cup during this period. Having spent the greater part of the past decade in the national leagues, the 2000‚Äì01 season would be a difficult one for the club. Walsall struggled through the campaign finishing 11th out of the 14 teams in National Division 3 North. Usually, this would have been enough to have kept them safe but an outbreak of foot and mouth caused havoc in the far north of the country, affecting the most northerly sides, Aspatria and Tynedale, who finished in the bottom two positions, with both sides only playing 18 games apiece, six short of the Midlands side. This led to the RFU re-thinking relegation with this in mind, and after taking early season form into account, they decided that Walsall would go down along with Aspatria. Although Walsall started the 21st century well, winning three Staffordshire Senior Cup titles in a row between 2000 and 2003 (11 wins overall), they were unable to make a return to the national leagues, with the 2001‚Äì02 season being the closet when they made the promotion playoffs but were ultimately well beaten by northern side Hull Ionians. In more recent times the club has struggled with two relegations in 2006‚Äì07 and 2015‚Äì16 seeing them falling to their lowest ever league position playing in tier 7 (Midlands 2 West (North)).

After that, he was promoted to Light flyweight and won IBF Pan Pacific Light flyweight title by wins over Lester Abutan, a Filipino boxer on April 22, 2016 at 7th Infantry Division, Amphoe Mae Rim, Chiang Mai province. On November 26, 2016 he challenge IBF Junior flyweight interim champion as he is a ranked #3 with Milan Melindo, a Filipino boxer who is a ranked #6 at Cebu Coliseum, Cebu City, Cebu, Philippines. But it appears that he was defeated by a unanimous decision 117‚Äì111, 115‚Äì113, 115‚Äì113 at the end of the final round. On October 15, 2017 he faced Felix Alvarado, a Nicaraguan boxer at Puerto Salvador Allende, Managua in the eliminator fight for the winner to challenge IBF Junior flyweight against Milan Melindo. He is the first Thai boxer to fight here in 49 years, after Chartchai Chionoi vs. Rat√≥n Mojica in 1968. But it appears that he was Alvarado's punches unilaterally, he was knocked down in the late first round and in the third round he was right hook until finally knocked out.

Often matches interrupted by weather would use reserve days, bowl outs, or be replayed on another date, but if logistics did not allow these, the ARR method would be used. The ARR method was used from the start of one-day cricket in the 1950s and 1960s until it was replaced by the Most Productive Overs method in 1991. Calculation If an interruption means that the team batting second loses some of their overs, their target score is adjusted as follows. : \\\\text{Team 2's new target }=\\\\text{ (Team 1's Average Run Rate achieved} \\\\times \\\\text{Overs available to Team 2)} + 1. This means that Team 2 just has to match the average run rate achieved by Team 1 in the overs it has available. For example, if Team 1 made 250 in their 50 overs, which is an ARR of 5 runs per over, and Team 2's innings is reduced to 25 overs, Team 2's new target is (5 x 25) + 1 = 126. This formula can alternatively be written as: :\\\\text{Team 2's new target } = \\\\left({\\\\text{Team 1's total} \\\\times \\\\frac{\\\\text{Overs available to Team 2}}{\\\\text{Overs used by Team 1}}} \\\\right)+1. In other words, the target is reduced in proportion to the loss in overs. Using the same example as above, with this formula the new target for Team 2 is (250 x 25/50) + 1 = 126. Criticisms The ARR method frequently alters the balance of the match, usually in favour of the team batting second (Team 2). There are four intrinsic flaws in the method: * Firstly, it is easier to maintain a given run rate for a reduced number of overs: since less care needs to be taken to preserve wickets, an adjusted target is easier to achieve. * Secondly, the method takes no consideration of wickets lost, but simply reflected how quickly they were scoring when the match was interrupted. This means if Team 2 were 126‚Äì9 from 25 overs in reply to a score of 250 from 50 overs, they would be declared the winner. *Thirdly, there is no compensation to Team 1 if they unexpectedly lose some of their final overs which they were expecting to be able to score from. *Fourthly, if Team 2's innings is interrupted, the current match situation is irrelevant in the calculation of the new target, meaning the balance of the match will be changed. Two subsequent modifications were used: increasing the required run rate by 0.5% for each over lost, and calculating the target using the run rate after excluding maiden overs, with the target given by the next highest integer. While these modifications reduced Team 2's advantage, the second also effectively penalised Team 2 for good bowling, and they failed to address the intrinsic flaws of the method. Notable matches decided by ARR *England v Sri Lanka in the 1987 Cricket World Cup. After England scored 296 from 50 overs, rain reduced Sri Lanka's innings to 45 overs, giving them a revised target of 267 (296 x 45/50 = 266.4). Sri Lanka finished at 158-8. : In this match, the later Duckworth- Lewis-Stern method would have reset Sri Lanka's target to 282. * In the third final of the 1988-89 World Series Cup, Australia scored 226 from 38 overs. Chasing 227 to win, West Indies were 47‚àí2 after 6.4 overs when rain stopped play for 85 minutes. At this point they needed 180 runs from 31.2 overs (a required RR of 5.74). When play restarted, West Indies' innings was reduced to 18 overs, giving a revised target of 108 (226 x 18/38 = 107.1), so they needed 61 runs from 11.2 overs (a required RR of 5.38). The West Indies won the match (and the competition) with 4.4 overs remaining and eight wickets in hand.3rd Final, 1988/89 Benson and Hedges World Series Cup :This revised target gave the West Indies a major advantage as it significantly reduced the number of overs they needed to maintain a given run rate, and reduced the required run rate. Australian fans booed this conclusion, and the Average Run Rate was criticised by the media and Australian captain Allan Border, which led to Australia developing the Most Productive Overs method. In this match, the later Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method would have increased the West Indies' target to 232 (to take into account a two-hour rain delay during Australia's innings), and then revised the target to 139 after the second interruption.

Early life  Rohini Devasher received her MA in printmaking from the Winchester School of Art in the UK and her BFA in Painting from the College of Art in New Delhi. She was also the recipient of the Inlaks Fine Arts Award twice in the years 2007 and 2008. She was further granted the Sarai Associate Fellowship in 2009, instituted by the Centre for Study of Developing Societies, Delhi. Rohini is also a member of the Amateur Astronomers Association of Delhi (AAAD) in 1997. In 2012, she was invited to a four-month residency this year at the Max Planck Institute in Berlin, where she worked alongside leading research scientists exploring similar themes of astronomy and science.  Career   Early years  Rohini Devasher worked at the India Habitat Centre prior to her M.A. in the UK and returned to work at the Khoj International Artists‚Äô Association between 2005 and 2010. In 2009, Devasher opened her first solo ‚ÄòBreed‚Äô at Project 88 in Mumbai. The exhibition consisted of digital prints, drawings and videos. Devasher's works explored the possibilities contained within nature, where organisms are born, breed and multiply. Her other exhibitions include Deep Time that opened at Khoj International Artists‚Äô Association and Project 88 in Mumbai. In 2012, Devasher participated in the inaugural Kochi Muziris Biennale curated by Krishnamachari Bose and Riyas Komu. In Aspinwall House, the main venue of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale Rohini Devasher‚Äôs seven- channel video work, Parts Unknown was installed. Devasher chose to create fictive landscapes up north in Ladakh, at the site of the Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO) in Hanle, one of the world‚Äôs highest sites for optical, infrared and gamma-ray telescopes, that draws astronomers as much for the severe terrain as for the dramatic skies.  Speculations from the Field  Speculations from the field opened at the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Byculla (E) and was curated by Tasneem Zakaria Mehta, the director of the museum, and Himanshu Kadam, senior assistant curator. The show explores existentialist themes by looking at the place of humans in the universe, and the idea of time interacting with the museum‚Äôs collection of fossils from the Jurassic Period. The exhibition is a meditation on the intersection of deep sciences, geology and astronomy, art and perception. In the exhibition, Devasher also worked with the museum‚Äôs Philip‚Äôs Planisphere, made with embossed and gilded leather, from the early 20th century. The planisphere shows all the principal stars, and their position during every hour of the year. She has mapped the sky above the museum from the present to an imaginary future almost 20,000 years from the current year through 20 prints.  Awards  In 2014, Devasher was named the Forbes Contemporary Artist of the Year. She was previously nominated and later announces as the Art India Skoda Breakthrough Artist award in 2012.

Keith alleged that Jews had a 'dual code; conduct towards their fellows is based on amity, that to all outside their circle is based on enmity. The use of the dual code is the mark of an evolving race.' Keith, op cit, 1948, p 373 # The Indian caste system. #The dhimmi status imposed on non-muslims in areas submitted to islamic law. Keith, op cit, 1948 # Peter Corning cites: Shia versus Sunni, Catholic versus Protestant, the American Civil War and World War One as further examples of this 'syndrome'. Peter Corning, 'A Dangerous Division', Psychology Today, 28/4/2012 Disruption The amity-enmity complex maintains 'tribal spirit' and thus unity, of the community, 'as long as personal contact between its members is possible.' If the community grows beyond this limitation, then disruption, swarming and disintegration occur. Modern mass communication enables communities 'of 100 million' to remain intact. Keith, op cit, 1948 Cyclical effect Keith expressed regret that this phenomenon, which explains so much, had not become common knowledge: \\"[W]e eternally experience the misery... of each new manifestation of the complex, then invent some new 'ism' to categorise this behavior as an evil, dealing with a common behavioural trait piecemeal [instead of] finally grasping and understanding the phenomenon.\\"Arthur Keith, A New Theory of Human Evolution, 1948.  Modern examples of tribal instinct Colleges, sports teams, churches, trades unions, female fashions and political parties enable people to exhibit tribal loyalty within large, mass-communicating nations. 'In politics we have to take sides.' But all these 'petty manifestations' are cast aside in time of war. Bismarck, Abraham Lincoln and Lloyd George are cited as statesmen who knew how to exploit the tribal spirit for political ends. In later works According to Peter Bowler, Peter J Bowler, 'Evolution :The History of an Idea', University of California, 2003, p345 Konrad Lorenz, Robert Ardrey and Desmond Morris were successors to Keith in promoting the 'anthropology of aggression' theory. Ardrey pointed out that similar behavior can be observed in most primates, especially baboons and chimps.Robert Ardrey, African Genesis, Fontana, 1969, pp. 85-89. \\"Nationalism as such is no more than a human expression of the animal drive to maintain and defend a territory... the mentality of the single Germanic tribe under Hitler differed in no way from that of early man or late baboon.\\"Robert Ardrey, African Genesis, Fontana, 1969, p. 188. The amity- enmity complex is a serious obstacle to world peace and world government, and may even lead to nuclear holocaust: \\"How can we get along without war?... if we fail to get along without war, the future will be as lacking in human problems as it will be remarkably lacking in men.\\"Robert Ardrey, African Genesis, Fontana, 1969, p. 362. Desmond MorrisDesmond Morris, The Human Zoo, Cape, 1969, chapter one: Tribes and Supertribes; chapter four: Ingroups and Outgroups makes a prescriptive point: \\"We must try to step outside our groups and look down on human battlefields with the unbiased eye of a hovering Martian.\\" And he warns that \\"the truly violent species all appear to have exterminated themselves, a lesson we should not overlook.\\" The inherited aggression of the amity-enmity rivalry between communities is rationalized under a \\"persistent cloak of ideology... a matter of ideals, moral principles, social philosophies or religious beliefs.... [O]nly an immense amount of intellectual restraint will save the situation.\\"Desmond Morris, The Human Zoo, Cape, 1969, chap. four. After World War Two, a debate about the place of instinct and learning (the nature-versus-nurture debate) has occurred. According to Steven Pinker, the \\"bitter lessons of lynchings, world wars, and the Holocaust\\" have caused \\"prevailing theories of mind\\" to be \\"refashioned to make racism and sexism as untenable as possible. The doctrine of the blank slate became entrenched in intellectual life.\\"Steven Pinker, The Blank Slate, 2002, pp. 16-17. Pinker makes the point that \\"conflicts of interest are inherent to the human condition.\\" Man is a product of nature, as much as malarial mosquitoes; both \\"are doing exactly what evolution designed them to do, even if the outcome makes people suffer... [We] cannot call their behavior pathological... [T]he belief that violence is an aberration is dangerous.\\"Steven Pinker, The Blank Slate, 2002, pp. 313-14. Objections to the theory Research by Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall raised awareness of a gentler side to the great apes in opposition to the 'anthropology of aggression' theory, but 'both sides of the debate were working with limited models of ape behaviour'.

He was a member of the Acad√©mie Charles-Cros.  Biography  After studying plastic arts at the √âcole Duperr√© in Paris, and having devoted himself for several years to painting, Daniel Caux became known in the late 1960s as a specialist in new jazz trends, new American musical avant-garde, world music and marginalities of all kinds. From 1969 to 1975, he wrote in Combat, Jazz Hot, and held the musical section of the magazine L' Art vivant. From 1974 to 1976, he wrote a series of articles on Arab music in Charlie Mensuel and, from 1975 to 1979, he became a contributor to the daily Le Monde. An organizer of musical events, in 1970 he brought the \\"Nuits de la Fondation Maeght\\", devoted that year to the United States, on the side of the great outsiders of the \\"free jazz\\" of American Blacks, the saxophonist Albert AylerAlbert Ayler Interview with Daniel Caux for France Culture, July 27, 1970 and, for the first time outside the United States, the great orchestra of Sun Ra. On the \\"underground\\" side of white contemporary music, he revealed the specific character of the minimal music current with the Th√©√¢tre de la musique √©ternelle of La Monte Young and the long repetitive variations of Terry Riley. He was at the origin of the coming to Paris of other important composers of this movement: Steve Reich in 1971 at the Th√©√¢tre de la musique and, within the framework of the Festival d'automne, Phil Glass in 1973, Robert Ashley and the \\"Sonic Arts Union\\" in 1974. He participated in the artistic direction of the label Shandar, created by Chantal Darcy. The Shandar catalogue, which was entitled \\"Tomorrow's music today\\", includes Albert Ayler, Sun Ra and Cecil Taylor as well as the known American minimalists Terry Riley, Steve Reich, Phil Glass, and also several records of French musicians (Intercommunal Music Fran√ßois Tusques ‚Äì Intercommunal Music on Discogs by Fran√ßois Tusques, the duet ' by Vincent Le Masne and Bertrand Porquet, Obsolete by Dashiell Hedayat with the group Gong). A radio man, Daniel Caux directed, during thirty years from 1970 to 1999, numerous musical programs on France Culture and France Musique. In 1971, he travelled through Kabylia and in 1972, in the region of Oran, where he recorded traditional musics of Algeria. He visited many times the Maghreb countries, Egypt and the United States (East Coast and West Coast). Under the name Un nouveau courant (\\"a new current\\"), he organized for France Culture, at the youth Biennial of the Mus√©e d'art moderne de la ville de Paris, two series of concerts in 1980 that shed light on a musical approach deviated from the minimalist music that can be described as \\"postmodern\\" with, among others, the English Gavin Bryars and Michael Nyman, and the Californians Harold Budd and Daniel Lentz. In 1982, with the great orchestra of the American celestial tramp in the Black Forest, Moondog and the \\"Penguin Cafe Orchestra\\" of London. At the request of Patrice Ch√©reau, he set up, with , in 1984 and 1985 at the Th√©√¢tre Nanterre-Amandiers, the twenty-five concerts that made up the Journ√©es de musiques arabes. Daniel Caux's efforts in favor of the \\"postmodernern\\" musical trend continued in Paris at the Th√©√¢tre de la Ville with the cycle D'autres musiques (\\"other musics\\") which allowed the Estonian composer Arvo P√§rt to be discovered in 1986, and welcomed, until 1989, many outstanding musicians such as the Americans Jon Hassell, Michael Galasso and Glenn Branca. In 1995, after devoting several radio broadcasts to the American composer Harry Partch, with whom he had a correspondence in the early 1970s with a view to organize a concert in France, he could finally realize this twenty-five-year-old project at the \\"Festival America\\" of Lille. The instruments built by Harry Partch were played there - for the first time in France - by Dean Drummond's \\"Newband\\". For twenty years, from 1970 to 1990, Daniel Caux was a lecturer at the Paris 8 University (in Vincennes, then Saint-Denis). In the 1980s and 1990s, he wrote in art press and Le Nouvel Observateur and participated in numerous collective publications. In the wake of his interest in research in electronic music, the repetitiveness of minimalist music and the obsessive nature of traditional trance music, he turned in the mid-1990s, into the defender of techno music on which he wrote in various publications, in particular in the special issue of Art Press: Techno, anatomie des cultures √©lectroniques published in 1998. For France Culture, he directed in February 1999 \\"Hypnomixotechno\\", the first series of in-depth radio programs devoted in France to this musical phenomenon . In 1994, Daniel Caux was musical curator of the exhibition Hors limite (off limit) at the Centre Georges Pompidou. For the celebration of the year 2000 in France, he was musical curator of the great exhibition Beaut√© in Avignon (with, among others, an electronic environment through the Palais des Papes in Avignon by the Canadian composer and DJ Richie Hawtin). For three years, from 1999 to 2002, he served as music advisor at the head of France Culture. Daniel Caux died Saturday 12 July 2008 in Paris. In the promotion of 14 July 2008, Daniel Caux was posthumously nominated as Officer of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.

Adultery Adultery: Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Maldives, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen. Apostasy and blasphemy Apostasy means renouncing/abandoning/leaving one's religion for another religion (known as conversion) or irreligion (known as deconversion or disaffiliation, including to stances such as atheism, agnosticism and freethought). In the 21st century, this is considered a crime only for Muslims, in a limited number of countries and territories (25 as of 2014 according to Pew Research Center, all of which were located in Africa or Asia), about ten of whom have the death penalty on it, while the other jurisdictions may inflict less severe punishments such as imprisonment, a fine or loss of some civil rights (in Jordan all civil rights), notably one's marriage and child custody. Converting a Muslim to another religion or irreligion is sometimes also criminalised as being an 'accomplice to apostasy'. Apostasy is not known to be a crime (let alone a capital crime) for adherents of any other religion in any country in the 21st century. Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) includes the 'freedom to change [one's] religion or belief', therefore any obstruction of apostasy is considered a human rights violation in international law. Blasphemy means insult, defamation or desecration/sacrilege of something that or someone who is deemed holy in one or more religions. Unlike apostasy, the religious status of the person suspected/accused of blasphemy is generally regarded as irrelevant; for example, a Muslim may be accused of 'blaspheming' a thing or person deemed holy by some Christians (or Christian organisation or authority), and vice versa, even if that thing or person is not 'holy' to the suspect. In the 21st century, blasphemy is much more widely criminalised than apostasy, in jurisdictions around the world, and is influenced by several religions including Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and Judaism. As of July 2020, blasphemy could be punished by the death penalty in eight countries, all of which were Muslim-majority countries. In some jurisdictions influenced by Sharia (Islamic law), apostasy and blasphemy are closely linked offences. 'Apostasy', or 'public expression of apostasy', is sometimes considered a form/'evidence' of 'blasphemy' and is then prosecuted as such, even though 'apostasy' itself may not be a crime (example: Pakistan). Likewise, 'blasphemy' is sometimes considered a form/'evidence' of 'apostasy' and is then prosecuted as such, even though 'blasphemy' itself may not be a (capital) crime (example: Qatar). Furthermore, apostasy and blasphemy tend to be closely legally linked to atheism. Formally, being an atheist (or otherwise non- religious person) itself is not an offence in any country, but in practice it is difficult to be an atheist without being able to become an atheist (which is legally impossible for Muslims in many countries, some of which impose capital punishment) or while needing to keep it a secret to everyone that one is an atheist. Therefore, although there is a technical difference between becoming an atheist (a form of apostasy), being an atheist (atheism), and expressing that one is an atheist (which is considered a form of 'blasphemy' by some), some commentators frame the legal situation such that 'being an atheist is punishable by death' or that 'atheism is punishable by the death penalty' in some countries.  Apostasy  As of July 2020, apostasy by Muslims (ridda) carries the death penalty in the following countries: Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, the Maldives, Mauritania, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia (implicitly), the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Malaysia's states Kelantan and Terengganu mandate the death penalty for apostasy, but federal law prohibits execution for this purpose, and so, it is never implemented in practice. Likewise in Nigeria, some northern states have adopted Sharia law, although execution for apostasy would violate the Federal Constitution, and it's therefore unclear whether death sentences are actually carried out. * Afghanistan: 'According to the Article 1 of the Penal Code, crimes of Hudud and Qisas including apostasy are inflicted in accordance with the Hanafi Jurisprudence of Sharia law, which includes death punishment for non-believers and apostates.' * Algeria: 'Since 2006, proselytizing by non-Muslims has been illegal and carries a fine of up to EUR 10,000 and a maximum of five years in prison and non-Muslim missionary groups are only allowed to conduct humanitarian activities. Distribution of materials which may ‚Äúshake the faith‚Äù of a Muslim or ‚Äúundermine the Islamic faith‚Äù is also prohibited. Apostasy is not expressly penalized, but draws consequences partially in the family law. Prior to the 2005 amendments, family law stated that if it is established that either spouse is an ‚Äúapostate‚Äù from Islam, the marriage will be declared null and void (Article 32). The term ‚Äúapostate‚Äù was removed with the amendments, however those determined as such still cannot receive any inheritance (Article 138).' * Brunei: Section 112(1) of the 2013 Syariah (Sharia) Penal Code (fully implemented in 2019) makes a Muslim who declares himself non-Muslim punishable by death, or with imprisonment for a term not exceeding thirty years and corporal punishment, depending on the type of evidence. If a Sharia Court is satisfied that the accused has repented, the Court must order an acquittal. * Iran: Apostasy is not explicitly defined in Iran's civil or criminal legislation, but 'according to Article 167 of the constitution: 'The judge is bound to endeavor to judge each case on the basis of the codified law. In case of the absence of any such law, he has to deliver his judgment on the basis of authoritative Islamic sources and authentic fatwa.' And Sharia law has been used to punish Muslim apostates with the death penalty. In 1989, Hossein Soodmand, who converted from Islam to Christianity and was a pastor of the Assemblies of God, was executed for apostasy. The last time anyone was reportedly executed for apostasy in Iran was in 1990. State laws on apostasy in Malaysia. Criminal offences include 'apostasy', 'attempted apostasy' and being an 'accomplice to the apostasy' of someone else (i.e. converting another person). * Malaysia: Apostasy is not a federal crime. Islamic apostasy laws differ from state to state. Malaysia's states Kelantan and Terengganu mandate the death penalty for apostasy, but federal law prohibits execution for this purpose, and so, it is never implemented in practice. The maximum punishment any state can currently convict a Muslim apostate to is 3 years imprisonment. * Maldives: 'While many religious ‚Äòcrimes‚Äô are not individually spelled out under the penal code, wide berth is given for the prosecution of ‚Äòhudud‚Äò crimes under Sharia law. The penal code grants judges discretion to impose Sharia penalties, including apostasy and blasphemy.' In June 2010, Mohammed Nazim who had publicly declared himself a former Muslim, was arrested by police and given religious counselling by the Islamic Ministry in prison to repent or be executed; Nazim repented and was released. * Mauritania: 'In 2018, Mauritania enacted a law which makes the death sentence for apostasy compulsory.' * Nigeria: 'The Nigerian Constitution protects freedom of religion and allows religious conversion. Section 10 of the constitution states, ‚ÄòThe Government of the Federation of a State shall not adopt any religion as State Religion.‚Äô However, sections 275‚Äì279 of the Constitution give constituent states the power to establish their own Sharia courts on civil matters. Abiding by Sharia law is required for Muslims in some states but optional in others and enforcement differs by state. Rulings and procedures are sometimes difficult to find.' Although the states of Nigeria have a degree of autonomy to adopt their own laws, the first paragraph of the Federal Constitution stipulates that any law inconsistent with the provisions of the constitution shall be void. The Sharia penal code does contradict the Constitution, yet the federal government has not made a move to restore this breach of the constitutional order, letting the northern Muslim-dominated states have their way and not protecting the constitutional rights of citizens violated by Sharia. It is unclear whether any of the 12 northern states that have adopted some Sharia legislation are carrying out the death penalty, which would violate the Federal Constitution. * Qatar: 'Converting to another religion from Islam is considered apostasy and remains a capital offence in Qatar' (Article 1.1 of Law 11 of 2004). 'A blasphemy accusation could be taken as evidence of apostasy' (rather than the other way around). 'However since 1971 no punishment for apostasy has been recorded.' On its own, blasphemy carries the maximum penalty of imprisonment. * Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia has no penal code, the Sharia function as the law of the land. 'Apostasy is criminalized and mandates a death penalty. The criminal accusation of ‚Äúapostasy‚Äù is sometimes deployed against people (including writers, activists, artists, or lawyers) who show any serious sign of pushing at the outer boundaries of freedom of expression, or who are critical of the religious authorities, and whose views (rightly or wrongly) are termed ‚Äúatheist‚Äù or as ‚Äúinsulting to religion‚Äù. These laws are actively utilized.' Blasphemy (conceived as 'a deviation from Sunni Islam') is frequently considered a form of apostasy and may be prosecuted as such (contrary to other jurisdictions, where apostasy is sometimes considered a form/evidence of blasphemy). In a 2012 incident, Saudi authorities detained two men and charged them with apostasy for adopting the Ahmadiyya interpretation of Islam. * Somalia: 'The 2012 provisional federal constitution of Somalia does not explicitly prohibit apostasy, but does state that Sharia law comes before federal law.' (2012 Federal constitution 'Article 2: State and Religion. (3) No law can be enacted that is not compliant with the general principles and objectives of Shari'ah.') Since execution for apostasy is the regular punishment in Sharia law, it is presumed that apostasy in Somalia carries the death penalty. In addition, the federal constitution (Article 2), the Somaliland constitution (Article 5.1), and the Puntland constitution (Article 6) all prohibit the propagation of any other religion than Islam, and the latter two also explicitly prohibit Muslim apostasy (Somaliland constitution 'Article 33: Freedom of Belief 1. Every person shall have the right to freedom of belief, and shall not be compelled to adopt another belief. Islamic Sharia does not accept that a Muslim person can renounce his beliefs.'; Puntland constitution 'Article 24: Freedom of Faith. 1. No one can be forced to a faith; different from his/her believes. 2. The Muslim person does not have the right to convert from the Islamic faith.'), though the punishment is not clear. * United Arab Emirates: 'All citizens of the UAE are deemed to be Muslims. Conversion to other religions (and by implication, advocacy of atheism) is forbidden and the legal punishment for conversion from Islam is death (Article 1 and 66 of the Penal Code), although there have been no known prosecutions or legal punishments for apostasy in court.' * Yemen: 'The act of ‚Äúapostasy‚Äù is punishable by death. Under Yemeni law ‚Äúdenouncing Islam‚Äù or any blasphemy conviction may constitute evidence of ‚Äúapostasy‚Äù. While the rate of capital punishment in Yemen is very high, the government does not enforce the death penalty for apostasy in practice: the law allows those charged with apostasy three opportunities to repent, which absolves them from the death penalty. It is unclear whether a moratorium is in place or whether an ‚Äúapostate‚Äù who refused to repent would face the death penalty. Family law prohibits marriage between a Muslim and an apostate; by law, apostates have no parental or child- custody rights.'  Blasphemy  As of July 2020, blasphemy can be punished by death in Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria (some northern states), Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Somalia (al-Shabaab-controlled areas). *Afghanistan: Blasphemy law in Afghanistan is defined by the Penal Code of 1976, which addresses \\"Crimes Against Religions\\", but leaves the issue of blasphemy to Sharia. Sharia permits the authorities to treat blasphemy as a capital crime. The authorities can punish blasphemy with death if the blasphemy is committed by a male of sound mind over age 18 or by a female of sound mind over age 16. Anyone accused of blasphemy has three days to recant. If an accused does not recant, death by hanging may follow. *Brunei: Capital punishment in Brunei was introduced for blasphemy in April 2019, but under heavy international pressure, the sultan of Brunei announced a moratorium on the death penalty while defending the legislation overall. Various offences of the new Sharia-based penal code which could be framed as 'blasphemy' include 'Propagation of religion other than religion of Islam' (Article 209), printing, disseminating, importing, broadcasting, and distributing of publications deemed contrary to Sharia (Articles 213, 214 and 215), non- Muslims using 'Allah' as the name of their god (for example, Bruneian Christians), 'Contempt etc. of religious authority' (Article 230), 'Incitement to neglect religious duty' (Article 235), amongst other Hudud crimes. *Iran: The Islamic Republic of Iran has a penal code that is heavily influenced by Sharia. Amongst the religious offences that may be punished with execution are insulting the prophet Muhammad, and moharebeh, usually translated as 'enmity against God'. The regime periodically executes dozens of prisoners, usually by hanging, by merit of religious offences. In practice, many of the executions seem not so much aimed at nonbelievers or religious dissenters, but at punishing political protests against the theocratic government, which argues that any opposition to its divinely granted authority is opposition to Allah himself, and therefore blasphemous. However, a legal clause provides that if a suspect professes that the insult was a mistake or made in anger, the sentence may be converted to 74 lashes instead of hanging. *Mauritania: In 2018, Mauritania upgraded its punishment for blasphemy from imprisonment to death and made it compulsory; convicts were no longer given the option of repentance within three days to go free. *Nigeria: Blasphemy law in Nigeria allows a suspect to be condemned for blasphemy via the Customary system and the Sharia system. Although this prohibition against blasphemy in the Criminal Code and in Sharia is potentially unconstitutional, since the Federal Constitution's Section 38 entitles every Nigerian to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, and Section 39 gives every Nigerian the right to freedom of expression, death sentences for blasphemy are frequently carried out in some of the 12 northern states that have implemented Sharia, such as Kano State in 2015 and 2016. Moreover, five Muslim vigilantes who reportedly hacked a Christian woman to death for 'blaspheming the prophet Muhammad' on 2 June 2016 were all acquitted of murder by the Sharia court of Kano State. *Pakistan: Blasphemy in Pakistan is criminalised by Penal Code Articles 295 to 298. Only blasphemy under 295-C may be punished with the death penalty. It states: 'Use of derogatory remarks, etc., in respect of the Holy Prophet: Whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation or by any imputation, innuendo, or insinuation, directly or indirectly, defiles the sacred name of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, and shall also be liable to fine.'Pakistan Penal Code Chapter XV \\"Of Offences Relating to Religion\\" pp. 79‚Äì81. 'Apostasy' is sometimes considered 'evidence' of 'blasphemy' and is then prosecuted as such, even though 'apostasy' itself is not a crime in Pakistan. *Saudia Arabia: Blasphemy is conceived as 'a deviation from Sunni Islam' and therefore considered a form of apostasy, and may be prosecuted as such (contrary to other jurisdictions, where apostasy is sometimes considered a form/evidence of blasphemy). Because apostasy carries the death penalty, blasphemers are executed, usually by beheading or crucifixion. It is unclear whether blasphemy itself would be separately punishable if there was no prohibition on apostasy. *Somalia: Due to the ongoing Somali civil war, the militant group Al-Shabaab is able to impose the death penalty for blasphemy in the areas it controls. On the other hand, the 1963 Criminal Code, which applies in the rest of the country, at most punishes 'blasphemy' and 'defamation of Islam' by up to two years in prison. The 2012 provisional federal constitution of Somalia and the Puntland and Somaliland regional constitutions, despite acknowledging the freedom of expression, all prohibit the promotion/propagation of religion other than Islam, though the punishment that the internationally recognised government and regional governments would apply for it is not clear. Corruption Corruption: China, Cuba (minor's corruption), Indonesia (some acts of corruption which damage national economy/finances), Iran (corruption on Earth), Morocco, Thailand (bribery), Vietnam (bribery). Drug trafficking thumb Drug trafficking: Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei, China, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo (only in wartime), Egypt, India (option when second conviction for drug trafficking in quantities specified), Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Laos, Libya, Malaysia, Myanmar, North Korea, Oman, Qatar, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea, South Sudan (if aggravated circumstances), Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Taiwan, Thailand, United Arab Emirates, United States (only under certain conditions), Vietnam, Yemen. Espionage Espionage: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, China, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Palestine, Peru, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, South Korea, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, United States, Vietnam, Yemen. Fraud Fraud: China, Vietnam. Homosexuality and sodomy Laws regarding homosexuality Homosexuality and sodomy: Afghanistan, Brunei, Iran, Mauritania, Nigeria, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen. In July 2020, the sodomy law of Sudan, that previously punished gay men with up to 100 lashes for the first offence, five years in jail for the second and the death penalty the third time around, was abolished, with new legislation reducing the penalty to prison terms ranging from five years to life. Perjury Perjury causing the execution of an innocent person: Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Brunei, Central African Republic, Egypt, India, Iran (only in case of recidivism for capital sexual offences), Kuwait, Malaysia, Mauritania, Morocco, Myanmar, Niger, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, Singapore, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, United Arab Emirates, some U.S. States (California, Nebraska and Colorado), Yemen. Most U.S. states, as well as most countries around the world that retain the death penalty, would normally would consider perjury causing execution of an innocent person as murder and punish it the same way, often by death or life without parole. In Nebraska and Colorado, perjury causing execution of an innocent person is considered by law as an act of first-degree murder, punishable by death or life without parole, whereas in California, perjury causing execution of an innocent person is a separate offense, and is separated from any of its murder laws, and is also punishable by death or life without parole, whereas first-degree murder is punished by death, life without parole or 25 years to life in prison. Some countries, such as Morocco, Mauritania and the Central African Republic punish perjury by death when any person who is innocent has been sentenced to death for any reason. Even if such execution does not occur, perjury causing someone to be sentenced to death in itself is a death-eligible offense in these countries.

Currently, most industrial biotechnology expenditure in the UK is in the field of healthcare, and consequently the UK is the leader in Europe in the development of biopharmaceuticals, by some distance. History In 2015, the UK had around 225 main biotechnology companies, turning over around ¬£2.9bn.BBSRC Report July 2015 Exports accounted for around ¬£1.5bn of turnover. The UK has an estimated 5% share of the global market. In Europe, by patent applications submitted under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the UK is third, second to Germany and France but seventh in the world. Employment Around 8,800 people in the UK are directly employed in biotechnology, so it is not a labour-intensive industry. Other spending by British biotechnology companies supports around 11,000 other workers indirectly. The average income for a worker in the British industry is around ¬£48,000; in London, this is ¬£70,000. Employment is most found in London, South East England, North West England and Scotland. Research Around ¬£920m is spent on biotechnology research in the UK, around 4.5% of all private sector research and development. According to an OECD study, the UK is fourth in the world for expenditure on biotechnology research, after the USA, France and Switzerland. France spends around twice that of the UK on biotechnology. The expenditure on biotechnology research in the USA is far larger than any other country. The UK biotechnology industry leads in biopharmaceuticals research in Europe, well ahead of Switzerland and Germany, in terms of numbers of products being developed. Organisations Organisations that represent the British biotechnology industry are EuropaBio (Europe-wide in Brussels) and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) in Swindon. The National Centre for Biotechnology Education supports secondary schools. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) regulates biopharmaceuticals in the UK.

Its fossil remains were found in Egypt by Elwyn L. Simons and first formally described in 1987. It lived in the Oligocene (about 33 million years ago). It has been placed in its own family, Xenerodiopidae; the alternative view is that this family is synonymous with Ardeidae, the herons. Description The only known fossil remains of this animal are an incomplete beak (rostrum) and a left humerus, which allowed a reconstruction of its possible appearance. The dimensions had to be slightly larger than those of a current heron, and its appearance was relatively different due to the strange beak which was rather short, heavy and curved upwards, different from that of any other form of heron according to Rasmussen et al. The humerus was stout enough to suggests that this animal was of a robust structure. The lifestyle of this mysterious bird is not clear: the rostrum was very mobile and it seems that the animal was able to exercise a powerful bite. Taxonomy When first described in 1987 as Xenerodiops mycter, the species was placed in a new genus, Xenerodiops, and a new family, Xenerodiopidae. The genus name is formed from the Greek xenos, stranger, erodios, heron, and ops, here meaning resemblance. The species name mycter is from the Greek mykter, nose. Despite the scarcity of fossil remains, the describers considered this species to be related to the herons, family Ardeidae. At the time, herons were placed in the order Ciconiiformes, known to be paraphyletic. The order has since been split, with herons placed in Pelecaniformes. Ji≈ô√≠ Ml√≠kovsk√Ω compared X. mycter with Zeltornis ginsburgi, found in Miocene deposits in Libya. He considered that they might be the same species, although this could not be settled as they were described from different fossilized parts. However, he did synonymize the family Xenerodiopidae with Ardeidae, partly on the grounds that the unusually shaped rostrum was similar to those of other members of the subfamily Nycticoracinae. Distribution and habitat Xenerodiops mycter was found in Egypt, but may be the same species as one found in Libya. It lived in a tropical climate, surrounded by swamps.

It is a Grade II* listed building. History Nothing remains of the original church on the site which may have existed at the time of the Norman Conquest. The tower survives from the mid 15th century and the south aisle from 1532 to 1542. A Victorian restoration in 1867 included the rebuilding of the nave and chancel when the porch was added. The church was dedicated to St Salvyn, who is represented in the stained glass alongside St Francis and St George. The parish is part of the Exmoor benefice within the Diocese of Bath and Wells. Architecture The red sandstone building has slate roofs. It consists of a three-bay nave, four-bay south aisle with porch and a chancel. The three-stage west tower is supported by diagonal buttresses. It holds six bells the oldest of which cast by George Purdue in 1603. The interior has a Victorian stone reredos with a pannelled screen from 1923 forming the vestry. The fan-vaulted screen with the remains of friezes was originally made for St Audries Church in West Quantoxhead in the 15th century and moved to Exford and reassembled in 1929. The parish chest is from 1772. The organ was designed by Ninian Comper and presented to the church in 1924. In the churchyard there is the stump of a late 13th century stone cross.

Origins Born about 1370, he was the son of Sir Robert Chalons, of Challonsleigh in Plympton St Mary, and his wife Joan, elder daughter and coheiress of Sir John Beauchamp, of Ryme, and his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir John Whalesborough and his wife Joan Bodrugan. His father was a minor landowner in Devon who served Edward Courtenay, 3rd Earl of Devon. Career Initially he joined his father as an esquire of the Earl of Devon in 1384, and in 1387 was serving at sea in the fleet of Richard FitzAlan, 11th Earl of Arundel. Later that year he entered the service of Henry of Bolingbroke, Earl of Derby, and in 1390 went on his expedition to Prussia, fighting with the Teutonic Knights at Vilnius against the forces of the Grand Duke of Lithuania. Once back in England he married Blanche Waterton, daughter and coheiress of one of Henry's close associates, and in 1399 Henry, the day before the coronation, knighted him. The next year he was appointed a justice of the peace for Devon. In 1401 he was sent abroad on royal business and by 1402 was a Knight of the King's Chamber. In 1409 he served as High Sheriff of Devon. In 1415, with a small force, he joined the expedition of King Henry V to France and after its capture was part of the garrison of Harfleur. In 1420 he was elected member of the Parliament of England for Devon and for another term as Sheriff. He was again in Normandy, with the King, in 1421. After the King's death in 1422 he seems to have retired from royal service, being involved only in local government in Devon. His wife died in 1437 and he died on 6 February 1445, having outlived his sons. His heir was his grandson John, who died without children two years later. Monuments to both were in the Greyfriars church in London. His lands were then divided between the two children of his daughter Catherine. Landholdings From his father he inherited small properties in Devon, including Challonsleigh and the manors of Buckerell and Awliscombe, which yielded only about 5 pounds a year. On his marriage, Duke Henry awarded the couple an income of 20 marks (over 13 pounds) from the manor of Brecon. Once king, in 1399 Henry granted him the forfeited estates of Sir John Cary and of Sir Thomas Shelley. The Cary holdings included the castle and manor of Great Torrington, four and a half other manors and over 1,000 acres (400 hectares) of land in Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, together producing about 230 pounds a year. These were however gradually lost to legal and illegal challenges by Sir Robert Cary and associates so that by 1445 he held none. The Shelley properties in Middlesex he seems to have kept for some years. He also enjoyed grants by King Henry IV's nephew, John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter, who in 1420 gave him and his wife and their male heirs the manor of Flete Damarell in Holbeton, which in 1447 reverted to the Hollands. After the death of his father-in-law in 1409, he and his wife received 400 marks (267 pounds) as their share of his wealth, together with a part of the manor of Eaton Tregoes in Foy, Herefordshire. In Wiltshire he had an income from Upavon worth 60 pounds a year and property at Fonthill Gifford. Family In about 1393 he married Blanche, daughter and later coheiress of Sir Hugh Waterton and his first wife Ellen, daughter of a Lincolnshire landowner Robert Mowbray. A trusted member of the royal household, her father at the time was chamberlain to King Henry IV and her stepmother acted as guardian to the king's daughter Philippa. Blanche herself was granted an income by the crown in 1407, with an addition for life in 1410 after the death of her father. Their children were: :Thomas, whose history is unknown.Wrongly said in the Visitation to be the father of his niece Joan St Aubyn. :Henry, who is said to have married Margaret Clifton, and was survived by a son John, who died childless in 1447. :Elizabeth, who after 1412 married John Ferrers, of Churston Ferrers, but seems to have had no children. :Catherine (died 1420), who married John St Aubyn (died 1418), of Combe Raleigh. They left two daughters, who became heiresses to the Chalons lands on the death of their cousin John in 1447: ::Joan, who married first Otto Bodrugan, son of William II Bodrugan, and secondly William Dennis, with him having a daughter Alice who married John Bonville (died 1491). ::Margaret (born 1415), who married Reginald Tretherf, of Trethurffe in Ladock, and had a son John who married Elizabeth Courtenay, sister of Edward Courtenay, 1st Earl of Devon.

The name Trebor, which is ‚ÄúRobert‚Äù spelled backwards, was registered as a trademark four days after the end of World War I. On 18 April 1944, the factory in Katherine Road was hit by a German bomb. It bought Moffat toffee in 1959, and Jamesons Chocolates in 1960. By the end of the 1960s, the company was exporting to over fifty countries; 20% of its output from its three factories was exported.Times, 30 May 1966, page 17 The largest export market was the United States. Up to 1966, it had doubled its exports in four years. In the 1967 Birthday Honours, the Chairman John Marks (son of the founder, and who died in December 1980) was appointed a CBE for the company's exports; he was President from 1956 to 1959 of the Cocoa, Chocolate and Confectionery Alliance.

Early advertising for the Trebor Mints brand used the famous jingle \\"Trebor mints are a minty bit stronger\\". In January 1969, it bought the confectionery interests of Clarnico. In 1970, John Graham MarksJohn Marks (29 September 1930 ‚Äì 31 October 2012), the grandson of the company's founder, became chairman of the company, and owned the company with his brother Ian; the company was family run and also had a Christian paternalistic ethos. In 1981, the company discontinued night shifts, as it believed that night shifts were possibly damaging to family life. In December 1985, it bought Maynards for ¬£7.5m. In the middle of the 1980s, the company was the British market leader in branded mints and boiled sweets. Acquisition by Cadbury On Thursday 14 September 1989, Cadbury Schweppes bought the company for ¬£147m. The company was run as a subsidiary company of Cadbury. At the time, the company employed around 3,000. From 1 March 1990, the company was known as Trebor Bassett, a division of Cadbury. Production would eventually move to North Sheffield, off the A61. Structure Former original factory on Katherine Road (at Shaftesbury Road) in Forest Gate, pictured in January 2006 The company was headquartered in what was south-west Essex, in Woodford, Greater London. It initially had a factory at Forest Gate called the Trebor Works from 1935 between Upton Park tube station and East Ham tube station in what is now the London Borough of Newham,Former factory north of the former ground of West Ham United F.C. and west of Plashet. Its main headquarters were at Clayhall, next to the southern terminus (Junction 4 or Woodford Interchange) of the M11 on the Southend Road Industrial Estate on the A1400 (former A406 or North Circular Road). In 1939, a factory on a five acre site was opened on Brimington Road in Chesterfield, on the site of a former brewery next to Chesterfield railway station; the factory in Chesterfield closed in 2005. The Trebor Bassett national distribution centre was off the A6175 in Holmewood, North East Derbyshire, off the M1 Heath Interchange; this is now the NDC of Tangerine Confectionery. In 1978, a ¬£15m factory was opened in Colchester, which eventually closed in March 2000.

After winning the nomination, he was formally crowned the Democratic Party's nominee at the party's convention in Atlanta, Georgia on July 21, 1988. He lost the 1988 election to his Republican opponent George H. W. Bush, who was the sitting Vice President at the time. Dukakis won 10 states and the District of Columbia, receiving a total of 111 electoral votes compared to Bush's 426 (Dukakis would have received 112, but one faithless elector who was pledged to him voted for Bentsen for president and Dukakis for vice president instead out of protest). Dukakis received 46% of the popular vote to Bush's 54%. Many commentators blamed Dukakis' loss on the embarrassing photograph of him in a tank taken on September 13, 1988, which subsequently formed the basis of a successful Republican attack ad. Much of the blame was also laid on Dukakis' campaign, which was criticized for being poorly managed despite being well funded. He would have been the first Greek American President. Background Michael Dukakis was the 65th and 67th Governor of Massachusetts, from 1975 to 1979 and 1983 to 1991. His running mate, Lloyd Bentsen, was a senator from Texas and a member of the United States Senate Committee on Finance who had previously run for the Democratic nomination in 1976. Initial announcement On March 16, 1987, Dukakis, then the Governor of Massachusetts, gave what has become known as the \\"Marathon Speech\\" in Boston in which he hinted that he was running for President in next year's election. He formally announced that he would run in a speech given the following month. Previously, he had been urged to consider running for president by Mario Cuomo, who had dropped out the previous month. This made him the third declared Democratic candidate for the 1988 election, after Richard A. Gephardt and Bruce Babbitt. Dukakis soon received an outpouring of support from voters throughout the country, which reportedly resulted in him receiving more attention than even he had expected. Democratic Primaries By May 1988, Dukakis had become the Democratic Party's front-runner for their nomination in that year's election, thanks to his victories in the New York and Pennsylvania primaries. On June 7, 1988, Dukakis clinched the Democratic Party's nomination by winning all four of the party's last primaries against Jesse Jackson, the only other remaining Democratic candidate at the time. These victories gave Dukakis significantly more delegates than the 2,081 required to win the nomination. \\"Massachusetts Miracle\\" Dukakis' campaign was focused on his experience as Governor of Massachusetts, during which time Massachusetts had emerged from an economic depression and had become a \\"bastion of prosperity and full employment\\". Commentators had described this as the \\"Massachusetts Miracle\\", a term Bush dismissed as the \\"Massachusetts mirage\\". Running mate selection On July 12, 1988, Dukakis announced he had chosen Texas senator Lloyd Bentsen as his running mate, in the hopes of garnering more support in the South. Dukakis compared his pick to John F. Kennedy's pick of Lyndon B. Johnson as his running mate in the 1960 election. As a result, his ticket became known as the \\"Boston-Austin axis\\", as Bentsen himself described it. Shortly after Dukakis made the pick, a Time cover story dubbed Dukakis and Bentsen \\"the odd couple\\", and Richard Stengel noted in 1988 that Bentsen was \\"...more Bush‚Äôs twin than Dukakis‚Äô\\". Acceptance of the nomination After winning the primaries in 30 states against Jesse Jackson and Al Gore, Dukakis accepted the Democratic Party's nomination at the 1988 Democratic National Convention on July 21, 1988, where Governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton formally nominated Dukakis. Television advertising During the campaign, Dukakis was the target of several now-infamous attack ads by individuals supporting the Bush campaign, most infamously the \\"Willie Horton\\" ad produced by the pro-Bush National Security Political Action Committee. Although the Bush campaign disavowed the ad, it still played a major role in Dukakis' defeat. The Dukakis campaign was mired in confusion during the general election, as exemplified by \\"the Handlers\\", a series of unintentionally confusing commercials that the campaign produced and aired at a cost of $3 million. Dukakis also erred in not responding to the Horton attack until late in the campaign. Donna Brazile resignation On October 20, 1988, Donna Brazile resigned from her role as deputy field director for the Dukakis campaign after saying that Bush needed to \\"fess up\\" about a rumor that he had had an extramarital affair. Her comments were also disavowed by the campaign, and Dukakis personally apologized to Bush for them at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner that year. Polling A poll conducted on July 21 and 22 of 1988 found that Dukakis had expanded the size of his lead over Bush to 17 points, with 55% of voters surveyed saying they would prefer Dukakis to win, compared to 38% for Bush. His lead soon began to shrink, however. For example, on July 30, Dukakis criticized the Reagan administration's handling of ethical issues, to which President Reagan himself responded by describing Dukakis as an \\"invalid\\", after which his poll numbers dropped by 5 points overnight. By August 11, Dukakis' lead over Bush had shrunk to 7 points, and by August 24, Bush had gained a 4-point lead over Dukakis. Of the dramatic shift in Dukakis' poll numbers, Mervin Field said, \\"I have never seen anything like this, this kind of swing in favorability ratings, ever since I have seen polls, going back to 1936.\\" Later that year, after the second Bush-Dukakis debate occurred on October 13, Dukakis' numbers dropped by 7 points that night, largely due to his emotionless response to a question about whether he would support the death penalty for someone if they raped and murdered his wife, Kitty Dukakis.

Moving heat sources is a topic in transient heat transfer that is applicable to engineering problems, particularly welding engineering. In the early 20th Century, welding engineers began studying moving heat sources, both empirically and theoretically. Depending on welding parameters, plate geometry and material properties, the solution takes three different forms: semi-infinite, intermediate, or thin plate. The temperature distribution and cooling rates can be determined from theoretical solutions to the problem, allowing engineers to better understand the consequences of heat sources on weldability and end item performance.  Empirical Solutions  In the 1930s, Portevin and Seferian attempted to experimentally determine heat transfer characteristics in welding. They correlated the effects of several factors‚Äîmaterial properties, welding process, and part dimensions‚Äîon temperature distribution, by performing oxyacetylene (gas) and covered electrode (arc) welds on plates and bars of various profiles, and multiple materials, including steel, copper, and aluminum. Their work showed that arc welding temperature gradients were steeper and cooling rates were faster than those of gas welding, which were more sensitive to material thickness than those of arc welding. In addition to process, material properties, and dimensions, the authors noted that preheat played a role in temperature distribution. Claussen and Sparagen did not detail other attempts to determine temperature distribution in welding, because the variety of approaches employed by the investigators resulted in data that were not comparable. They did note that the data generally revealed the effect of weld process on heat affected zone (HAZ) width, with gas welding having the widest HAZ, bare electrode arc processes the narrowest, and covered electrode falling in the middle.  Theoretical Solutions  Until the mid-1930s, the study of the theory of heat transfer from a moving source was neglected, and temperature distribution due to moving heat sources could only be calculated approximately. In 1935, Daniel Rosenthal published the first literature applying the exact theory of heat flow from a moving source to arc welding. Rosenthal's theoretical model included several assumptions: * Material properties are constant, * The heat source is a point source, * The surface of the work piece does not lose heat to the atmosphere, * Heat created by the Joule effect is neglected Rosenthal's solution has been shown to agree well with measured results over a wide range of parameters, although with some scattering of data. The assumption of a point, line, or plane heat source leads to inaccuracy in the vicinity of the fusion zone (where temperature is within about 20% of the melting temperature) and prohibits predicting the shape of the weld pool. Following Rosenthal, researchers were able to approximate weld pool shape by assuming a Gaussian heat source defined by the equation: Q(x,y)= {q\\\\over 2\\\\pi\\\\sigma^2}e^{-{(x^2+y^2)\\\\over2\\\\sigma^2}} where: * Q = heat source, * q = net power input, * œÉ = distribution parameter. and later, other heat source distributions, such as semi-ellipsoidal and double ellipsoidal.  Governing Heat Transfer Problem  The governing equation for three-dimensional transient heat transfer in a solid of semi-infinite dimensions, no heat generation, and no surface losses is: \\\\lambda{\\\\partial^2\\\\theta\\\\over\\\\partial x^2}+\\\\lambda{\\\\partial^2\\\\theta\\\\over\\\\partial y^2}+\\\\lambda{\\\\partial^2\\\\theta\\\\over\\\\partial z^2} = {\\\\rho C}{\\\\partial\\\\theta\\\\over\\\\partial t} where: * Œ∏ = temperature, * x = direction parallel to weld travel, * y = direction in plane and perpendicular to weld travel, * z = through-thickness direction, * Œª = thermal conductivity, * œÅ = density, * t = time, * C = specific heat. In the case of a moving heat source applied to a plate that is so thin that temperature does not vary in the through-thickness dimension, the third term becomes zero, and the problem is two-dimensional conduction. The factors that determine whether temperature varies through the thickness include: * welding speed (increases thermal gradient in through thickness direction), * thermal diffusivity (decreases thermal gradient in through thickness direction), * thickness (increases thermal gradient in through thickness direction). The problem is further simplified by taking advantage of the quasi-stationary state in welding, where temperature distribution from the perspective of a coordinate system that moves with the heat source is constant in time. The through thickness direction and direction perpendicular to the direction of travel are unchanged in the moving coordinate system, but the direction parallel to travel is related to the longitudinal direction of the fixed coordinate system by the equation: w=x-Vt Moving coordinate system at time, t, traveling at speed, V, parallel to the x-direction of a fixed coordinate system. where: * w = moving coordinate system longitudinal direction, * V = weld feed speed, * x = fixed coordinate system longitudinal direction. A heat flux boundary condition attributed to Rosenthal is to consider the rate of energy (power) transferred from the arc to the plate as equal to the heat transferred outward from a cylinder with height equal to the plate thickness and an infinitely small radius at the origin: P=\\\\lim_{r \\\\to 0}-{\\\\partial\\\\theta \\\\over \\\\partial r}2\\\\pi r\\\\lambda h where: * P = power, * r = distance from point source, * h = plate thickness. Another boundary condition is that temperature remains constant at distances far from the point source. Because the boundary conditions and two- dimensional differential equation can be satisfied by a solution that is dependent on distance from the source, a cylindrical coordinate system is used, with: r=(w^2+y^2)^{1\\\\over2} The resulting cylindrical differential equation is: {\\\\partial^2\\\\varphi\\\\over\\\\partial r^2}+{1\\\\over r}{\\\\partial\\\\varphi\\\\over\\\\partial r} - {\\\\Bigl({V\\\\over 2\\\\kappa}\\\\Bigr)}^2\\\\varphi=0 where œÜ is a function that will be determined later.  Solution  Plots of modified Bessel functions of the second kind for orders 0, 1, and 2. The solution of the radial \\"quasi-stationary\\" equation is the modified Bessel function of the second kind and zeroth order: \\\\varphi=K_0\\\\Bigl({Vr\\\\over 2\\\\kappa}\\\\Bigl) Substituting œÜ into the equation Rosenthal assumed for the solution of the original differential equation: \\\\theta=\\\\theta_0+\\\\Biggl(\\\\frac{P}{2\\\\pi\\\\lambda h}\\\\Biggr)e^{\\\\Bigl(-\\\\frac{Vw}{2\\\\kappa}\\\\Bigr)}K_0\\\\Biggl(\\\\frac{Vr}{2\\\\kappa}\\\\Biggr)  Finite Element Analysis  Finite element analysis (FEA) eliminates the assumption of non-constant material properties, and allows the use of non- axisymmetric, three-dimensional heat sources such as ellipsoidal and double ellipsoidal distributions. The double ellipsoidal heat source distribution presented by Goldak is intended to be flexible, to be used to analyze deep or shallow welds, and asymmetric geometry. The Goldak model has been shown to agree well with experimental results on thick section submerged arc weld (SAW) on steel plate, partial penetration electron beam weld (EBW) on steel plate, and gas tungsten arc weld (GTAW) on thin austenitic stainless steel plate.  Applications  Solution of temperature distribution and cooling rate due to a moving heat source has several practical uses in welding engineering, including: * microstructure, * joint strength, * residual stress, * cold cracking, * size of HAZ, * distortion. which are dependent on cooling time through temperature ranges (800C - 500C and 400C - 150C) for steels, as well as time spent at elevated temperatures. Rosenthal's solution can be manipulated to determine critical cooling rates, and select optimal preheat and interpass temperatures. Goldak's method has been shown to more accurately calculate 800C - 500C cooling rate than Rosenthal's for Goldak's SAW and EBW experiments. Goldak's method has been shown to be comparable to Gaussian and semi-ellipsoidal FEM models of Hashemzadeh's GTAW expirment.

Description of Memorial The Memorial has three main elements which together physically represent the roles of Australian Peacekeepers ‚Äì military, police and civilians - in the service of international peace and security. The first element is the two black polished masonry Monoliths symbolizing the \\"opposing forces of conflict\\" while the passageway of golden light between them created by the backlit onyx stone represents the \\"light of hope for the future\\" through peace and security brought about by peacekeepers. The steps and passage between monoliths Through the passageway of light is the second element, the cobblestone Courtyard, a peaceful gathering space for personal reflection and ceremonial purposes. On the courtyard surface are bronze plaques inscribed with words describing the personal traits of Australian Peacekeepers progressing to the values, actions, activities and finally the objectives of international peacekeeping as the plaques advance across the courtyard in parallel with the path of travel from front to rear. At the rear, the peaceful ambiance of the courtyard is contained by the third element, a single massive black polished masonry Commemorative Beam denoting the strength and stability that results from peacekeeping activities. Bronze facings on the beam are inscribed with the United Nations and other international peacekeeping missions and campaigns in which Australian Peacekeepers have participated. Below the beam is a white concrete inclined plane surface with bronze fixings for placing commemorative wreaths or remembrance flowers. Crests displayed at the front of the Memorial are those of organisations under whose auspices Australian Peacekeepers have operated and at the side, organisations from which they have been drawn. Background Since 14 September 1947, when four Australian military observers began their mission in Indonesia to help monitor the ceasefire between The Netherlands and the independence forces of the fledgling state of Indonesia, there have been Australian military, police and civilians involved in peacekeeping missions somewhere around the world. Over 60,000 Australians have served in peacekeeping missions, some have been killed or died whilst overseas and many have been injured or traumatised by their experiences, and through them, their families have been adversely affected. The large number of the Australians returning from service with the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) prompted a number of people in the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Peacekeepers and Peacemaker Veterans Association to discuss and propose that a national memorial to peacekeepers be erected. The idea was supported by the then Chief of Army, soon to become Chief of Defence Force in 2002, General Peter Cosgrove, and the relevant federal government Ministers and Opposition spokespersons of the day. At the rear is a courtyard with words describing peacekeeping, and an area for floral and other tributes. Other veterans‚Äô associations within Australia soon joined the call to address the fact that there was no national memorial to provide a focus for remembrance and commemoration of peacekeepers. A few plaques were dotted around the country, but there were no individual memorials or a national memorial - such as the Peacekeeping Monument in Ottawa, the only one of its kind in the world at the time. Since then, a memorial to commemorate all peacekeepers would have died serving on UN peacekeeping missions has been erected on the North Lawn of the UN headquarters in New York. Formation of a project to build a national memorial In 2005 a committee was established, with representatives from the various veterans‚Äô associations of Australia, the Australian Defence Force, and the Australian Federal Police (representing both Federal and state police services ‚Äì state police officers serving on peacekeeping missions were and are transferred to the Australian Federal Police for the duration of the officer's deployment). The committee created the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Project, a formal not-for-profit organisation with limited liability, with the simple objective to erect a national peacekeeping memorial on Anzac Parade in Canberra. To the right on the plinth are logos representing the armed and civil (police) services who have been part of the peacekeeping forces deployed by Australia. To the left are plaques in English and Braille outline the purpose, symbolism, major donors, memorial contractors and the dedication of the memorial. The veterans‚Äô associations represented on the committee were: The Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL), the United Nations Association of Australia (UNAA), the Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans Association (APPVA) and the United Nations and Overseas Policing Association of Australia (UNOPAA) ‚Äì although at the time of the formation of the committee the UNOPAA was called the United Nations Policing Association of Australia. The committee elected Major General Tim Ford AO (retired) as its chairperson, who remained in the position throughout the life of the project and committee. Major General Ford not only had a distinguished career in the Australian Army but served as the Head of Mission for the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) in the years 1998-2000 before being appointed as Military Adviser to the Under Secretary General for Peacekeeping at UN Headquarters in New York, a post he held until September 2002. The committee also included a number of other people who had skills that would prove useful in achieving the aims of the project, including Mr Warren Lewis a civil engineer with long experience in project development in the construction industry in Australia. He became the committee's project development manager, leading the development of contractual documentation, supervising the selected architect and builder and acting as prime interlocutor with the National Capital Authority. The committee was also aided by a number of Australian companies who provided pro bono support rather than direct financial donation. The APMP was granted Donor Gift Recipient (charity) status by the federal government on several occasions (not continuously), allowing all donations above $2 to be claimed as a tax deduction by the donor. Design Competition In 2008 a competition was conducted, under the guidance of the NCA, to find a design for the memorial. The competition was open to any architectural practices operating within Australia, and the design brief was simple ‚Äì the memorial had to reflect Australia's involvement in peacekeeping, be architecturally notable and cost less than a defined ceiling value of $3M. In the first stage of the competition, fourteen submissions were received, from which four were selected as meriting further development. The four practices involved were asked to develop their designs to a level that would allow a competition jury, established by the APMP committee, to better assess their final appearance and to provide reasonable estimates for the cost of construction. On 19 December 2008, the winner of the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Design Competition was announced at Parliament House. The winner of the competition was Super Colossal, now Bennett and Trimble, an architectural practice based in Sydney. The APMP Committee was impressed by the visual simplicity of the design; its visual impact on its surroundings; its representation of the work of peacekeepers; its reflection of the Australian landscape and its relatively low cost. Design Development Program The design program, lead by the Architect with input from several Australian engineering consultants, commenced in January 2009 and progressed through the various stages of design development to the completion of \\"detailed design and documentation\\". A quantity surveyor was appointed by the APMP committee to produce a cost plan which was progressively updated throughout the design process. The completed \\"design package\\" was approved by the APMP committee in November 2009 and endorsed by the NCA in December after some changes were made to provide better access within the memorial to accommodate future NCA maintenance equipment. Construction Competition The APMP committee made the decision to limit the selection of a construction contractor to those which were well established within the Australian Capital Territory and its environs. The committee established a selection panel from within its membership, augmented by an independent architect providing pro bono support. During 2010 the selection panel conducted extensive interviews with four construction companies based in the Australian Capital Territory and all four were invited to submit proposals for the construction of the memorial in accordance with the \\"design package\\". Having assessed these proposals in detail, in November 2010 the panel selected Manteena Pty Ltd to develop a test prototype and to construct the Memorial itself. A contract was signed in January 2011. Manteena had already constructed several national memorials in Canberra, completed public landscaping projects and civil engineering works that involved an artistic element, and were very familiar with the Anzac Parade memorial environment. The Construction The time of selecting Manteena to build the memorial there had been insufficient funds raised to begin full construction. Nevertheless, sufficient funds were available to conduct a prototype program (or risk reduction program, which had been incorporated into the contract) to assess materials suitability, construction techniques and general functionality required to achieve the desired Memorial aesthetic as well as to identify and resolve any unforeseen construction problems that might occur during actual construction. The work included the construction of a full-scale section of a monolith and fa√ßade with backlighting; examples of bronze lettering for courtyard plaques and front steps; a section of the Commemorative beam; specialized formwork; and examples of cobblestone sets for the courtyard. This risk reduction program proved well worth the relatively small expense, and the detailed design drawings were duly modified and a revised cost plan produced by the quantity surveyor. On successful completion of the prototype program in September 2011, sufficient funds remained to procure long lead-time materials required for the construction. Those materials were the golden onyx stone panels of the backlit facade of each black monolith forming the \\"golden\\" passageway between the monoliths, and the stone to be used as cobblestone pavers on the surface of the courtyard. Golden onyx is not indigenous to Australia, and so had to be sourced from overseas. Eventually suitable onyx was sourced from a Mexican quarry which was shipped to Italy for final cutting and polishing of the stone panels and for toughened glass to be bonded to the face of each panel. The glass strengthens the stone panels and provides protection from both the weather and vandalism. The courtyard pavers were sourced from a quarry in Kanmantoo in South Australia after a nationwide search for suitable stone. Both the onyx/glass panels and courtyard pavers arrived in Canberra by August 2014. In September 2015, the federal government, through the Department of Defence, provided a major grant to the project which, whilst insufficient to complete the memorial, allowed the project team to modify the construction plan into a two-stage approach and begin work on the first stage. The first stage was the courtyard, lighting and the Commemorative Beam. In effect, this was all work except the construction of the two monoliths and the various bronze plaques and insignia. This change in approach necessitated modifying the construction drawings and program to accommodate a potentially extensive hiatus between the two stages and necessitated seeking revised approval from the NCA in February 2016. After some delay associated with the revised works approval, a new two-stage contract was prepared and signed with Manteena and work finally began on constructing the memorial in June 2016. Fund raising efforts were stepped up using the fact the memorial construction was underway as a \\"selling point\\". In February 2017, with stage 1 construction due for completion in May, the federal government decided to provide a further grant to cover the cost of the second stage of construction. This decision meant reverting to the original single stage design and further re-arranging the construction program with its attendant disruptions to sequencing of trades and supplies, etc.. Despite the disruption to the development plan, Manteena and its subcontractors were able to achieve \\"substantial completion\\" of the Memorial to enable dedication by the Governor General on the 70th Anniversary of Australian Peacekeeping on 14 September 2017. Project Funding After an initial burst of generosity by both Australian industry and the federal government, fundraising became very slow. The global financial crisis of 2007-2008 had a severe effect on the committee's ability to obtain donations. It had been hoped that the majority of the funds needed to complete the project would be provided by Australian industry, and defence industry in particular, however such support did not eventuate. The Australian community, like others around the world, felt the GFC for many years. Personal and commercial philanthropy focused on social and individual support programs rather than other endeavours such as the memorial. Nevertheless, there were some major donors to the Memorial, whose names are shown on a donor plaque at the site. The federal government eventually made three grants to the APMP; the first in 2006 as seed funding to get the project underway, the second in late 2015 which allowed construction work to begin (the first stage of a two staged approach), and a third in early 2017 which provided the remaining funds needed to complete the memorial. In total, the federal government provided 75% of the project's costs, Australian industry and veteran organisations 20% and individuals 5%. The total project cost was $4.1m (2018). Escalation over 12 years of inflation was kept to the barest minimum through cost reviews and detailed re-design effort to find more economical methods of construction or materials. Less than 3% of the funds raised were expended on project administration, fundraising and publicity. Dedication Ceremony The Australian Peacekeeping Memorial was dedicated by the Governor-General, His Excellency General Sir Peter Cosgrove AK MC, on 14 September 2017. The Governor-General's wife, Lady Lyn Cosgrove represented the families and friends of all Australian peacekeepers. The Minister for Veterans‚Äô Affairs, the Hon Dan Tehan MP; and the project's Patron-in-Chief, His Excellency General David Hurley AC, Governor of New South Wales, were guests of honour. 14 September is Peacekeeping Day in Australia, reflecting the day on which Australia's, and the United Nation's, first peacekeepers deployed in Indonesia in 1947. Therefore, the ceremony on 14 September 2018 was conducted to both dedicate the new national memorial and to commemorate 70 years of Australia's involvement in peacekeeping missions. The ceremony was attended by peacekeeping veterans and their families from around Australia, current peacekeepers both from Australia and other countries, a number of ambassadors to Australia, and members of the general public. As part of the dedication ceremony, the local aboriginal tribe, the Ngunnawal, was acknowledged as the first people of the land on which the memorial was built, and representatives of the Ngunnawal conducted a \\"welcome to country\\" ceremony. Ceremonies on site Between 2008 and 2016 ceremonies to mark Peacekeeping Day were held on the site of the future peacekeeping memorial. A temporary memorial (colloquially referred to as a \\"sandbag memorial\\") was erected on each occasion and a non-denominational service was conducted to remember and honour the service and sacrifice of Australian peacekeepers and their families. A catafalque party was provided by Australia's Federation Guard (including an officer of the Australian Federal Police), and a small band provided by the Royal Military College Duntroon, both elements of the Australian Defence Force. The ceremonies were well attended by veterans, federal and state politicians, senior officers and officials of the ADF, AFP and government departments, and foreign dignitaries. Each ceremony was organised by the APMP Committee. Ceremonies after the dedication of the memorial in 2017 will be organised by individual or collective veterans‚Äô associations, or any other group wishing to do so. No one association has oversight of the memorial. The approval of the National Capital Authority is required to hold any ceremony at the memorial, as is the case for all ceremonies at any of the memorials along Anzac Parade in Canberra. Long Term Maintenance Blank panels reserved for listing future deployments on the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial The National Capital Authority is responsible for the long term care and maintenance of the memorial. The NCA also has the responsibility to coordinate and arrange for changes made to the memorial's mission beam. For each new peacekeeping mission to which Australians are deployed a new mission plaque will be added, and the plaque for any current missions which are completed will be altered to reflect the year of completion. Peacekeeping Missions The peacekeeping memorial identifies all of the peacekeeping missions and peace operations in which Australia has participated. At the time of dedication of the memorial there had been 62 such missions.

After reunification she became the first member of a German parliament (Landtag) to be deprived of her parliamentary mandate on account of activities as an Informal collaborator for the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) in what was, at that time, East Germany. This, and successful legal challenges touching on her case, attracted attention across the nation.  Life  Almuth Beck was born in Sonneberg, a small and in some ways isolated town in the Thuringian hills to the south of Erfurt. When she was 4 war ended and the region found itself in the Soviet occupation zone, relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). She passed her school final exams and went on to study between 1958 and 1962 at the University of Jena, during which time, in 1961, she married. She emerged qualified as a school teacher of History and German: between 1962 and 1965 she taught at the secondary school in F√∂ritz (Sonneberg) where she was also a deputy school director. Between 1965 and 1990 she served as an advisor on labour law at the Education Department of the Sonneberg district council. Between 1970 and 1973 she completed a distance-learning study course at the Karl-Marx University (as it was then known) in Leipzig which resulted in a degree in Educational psychology. In 1957 she became a member of the ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) at a relatively young age. After 1990 it emerged from the work on Stasi files that in the context of her advisory work with the local education department she had signed a \\"Declaration of Duty\\" (\\"Verpflichtungserkl√§rung\\") for the Ministry for State Security, although she denied this. In 1990 she took a teaching job at the school in Mengersgereuth-H√§mmern, then working between 1992 and 1994 as an adult education teacher.  Politics  Regional elections took place on the same day as the general election, on 16 October 1994. Nationally the result was not encouraging for the former SED which had been relaunched, formally at the end of 1989, as the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) as part of a broader relaunch intended to prepare for a democratic future. In the states that had been East Germany (\\"neuen Bundesl√§nder\\") support for the PDS increased from the low-point of 1990, however, and in the regional election in Thuringia the party won nearly 17% of the votes cast, which translated into 17 seats in the 88 seat parliament (\\"Landtag\\"). (Under the German system parties receiving less than 5% of the overall vote receive no seats in the resulting parliament, which is why, for the PDS, 17% of the votes translated into more than 17% of the seats.) Beck was not one of those directly elected by a single electoral district (\\"constituency\\"), but her name was high enough up on the statewide party list submitted to the Thuringian voters for her to become one of 4 so-called \\"Direktmandaten\\" included in the 17 party representative elected as members of the parliament. In 1996 she became a member of the PDS regional party executive for Thuringia. Under ¬ß 1 paragraph 2 of the Thuringia Law on parliamentary representation (\\"Th√ºringer Abgeordnetengesetz\\") of 7 February 1991 it was stipulated that members of parliament found to have collaborated with the Ministry for State Security should lose their seats. During the first electoral term, which had run till 1994, this had been agreed between the political parties who had together applied to the Stasi Records Agency for a set of appropriate rules. During the second electoral term, which ran from 1994 till 1999, the PDS reversed their position and rejected the all-party agreement. On 18 May 1995, in defiance of the majority decision by the parliament (\\"Landtag\\"), and also in defiance of the wishes of individual members, three PDS parliamentarians launched a successful legal challenge in the Thuringian constitutional court. The three were Ursula Fischer, Konrad Scheringer and Almuth Beck. The court decided that there was no legal basis for the provision. A rule placed in the parliament's regulations as this one had been was insufficient. The parliament then reinstated the regulation with what it believed was the necessary legal underpinnings. On 29 April 1999 the parliament, invoking ¬ß 8 of the Thuringia Law on parliamentary representation, withdrew the parliamentary mandate of Almuth Beck, citing actions that made her \\"unworthy to be a member of the parliament\\" (\\"unw√ºrdig, dem Landtag anzugeh√∂ren\\"). That decision gave rise to a formal legal complaint from the PDS group in the chamber. The complaint was successful. The constitutional court ruled that the legislation in question had fallen outside the regional parliament's constitutional competence. The constitutional court did not involve itself in the actual issue of Almuth Beck's Stasi involvement. Having declared the law ineffective, the accuracy or otherwise of allegations arising from it was not an issue for consideration. Almuth Beck, having acknowledged that her signature appeared on the Stasi \\"Declaration of Duty\\" (\\"Verpflichtungserkl√§rung\\"), maintained that it was nothing more than a confidentiality agreement signed in the context of her dealings with the country's \\"secret services\\". Besides that, she asserted \\"I did no one any harm\\" (\\"Ich habe niemandem geschadet\\"). Nevertheless, unsympathetic press reports indicate the existence of numerous instances documented in Stasi archives where information provided by Beck on colleagues and contacts, especially in the teaching profession, during her years as a Stasi informer, would have been sufficient to damage or end professional careers. In the 1999 regional election the PDS increased the number of their seats to 21, becoming the second largest party in the chamber. Almuth Beck was not re-elected, however, and resigned from the chamber.

He won four of his nine races in a track career which lasted from July 1981 to September 1982. As a two-year-old he was undefeated in three starts including the Phoenix Stakes and the Champagne Stakes and was rated the best horse of his generation in Ireland. In the following year he won the Tetrarch Stakes and later finished third in both the Sussex Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. He was retired at the end of the year to become a breeding stallion but had no success as a sire of winners. Background Achieved was a \\"neat\\" chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze bred in Ireland by James Wigan. As a yearling he was sent to the Houghton sale at Newmarket and was bought for 162,000 guineas by Robert Sangster, who got the better of a bidding duel with Henry Candy. The colt was sent into training with Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. He was from the fifth crop of foals sired by Thatch, an American- bred, Irish-trained horse who won the St James's Palace Stakes, July Cup and Sussex Stakes in 1973. His dam Last Call showed modest racing ability but was a successful broodmare whose other foals included Final Straw (July Stakes, Champagne Stakes, Greenham Stakes) and the Britannia Stakes winner Final Chord. She was a distant descendant of the British broodmare Spicebox (foaled 1923) who was the female-line ancestor of numerous major winners including Herbager, Detroit, Zabeel and Gildoran. Racing career 1981: two-year- old season Achieved made a successful debut in July 1981, when he was an easy winner of a minor race over five furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse. He was immediately moved up to Group 1 class for the Phoenix Stakes over the same course and distance on 8 August and was made the 4/6 favourite. The field was not a strong one by Group 1 standards, with the best fancied of his six opponents being the minor winners The Primate and Shir Khan and the unraced filly Dance Empress. Ridden by Pat Eddery, he started slowly and had to barge his way through the field in the final furlong before catching The Primate on the line and winning by a short head. An enquiry by the racecourse stewards left the result unaltered and their decision was confirmed by the Turf Club after the connections of The Primate lodged a formal appeal. Although he was technically dropped in class for his next race, Achieved actually faced much stiffer opposition whe he was sent to England to contest the Group 2 Champagne Stakes over seven furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse in September. Ridden again by Eddery he started the 11/4 second choice in the betting behind the Gimcrack Stakes winner Full Extent in eight-runner field which also included Red Sunset (Coventry Stakes). After tracking the leaders Achieved went to the front a furlong and a half from the finish and fought off a challenge from the Guy Harwood-trained Hays to win by one and half lengths. The form of the race was boosted ten days later when Hays won the Mill Reef Stakes by three lengths. Achieved was expected to return to England for the Royal Lodge Stakes but sustained a minor injury and did not race again that year. In the official International Classification of two-year-olds for 1981 he was rated the best Irish juvenile and the eighth-best colt of his age in Europe. The independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 124, making him eight-pounds inferior to their best two-year-old Wind and Wuthering. 1982: three-year- old season At the start of the 1982 season Achieved was regarded as a serious contender for both the 2000 Guineas and The Derby. He began his campaign at the Curragh in April when he started odds-on favourite for the seven furlong Gladness Stakes but was beaten a short head by the four-year-old Kilian. Later that month he won the Tetrarch Stakes over the same course and distance but was not particularly impressive as he came home a length in front of Exhilarate. In the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket Racecourse on 1 May he started the 15/2 second favourite and kept on well without ever looking likely to win, finishing sixth of the twenty-six runners behind the French colt Zino. In the Irish 2,000 Guineas two weeks later he was partnered by George McGrath as Pat Eddery opted to ride Raconteur, the O'Brien stable's more fancied runner. Achieved finished sixth again, six and a half lengths behind the winner Dara Monarch but two lengths in front of Raconteur. After four races in six weeks, Achieved was rested until 28 July when he was matched against older horses in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. Wearing blinkers for the first time he produced probably his best effort of the season as he finished third to On The House and Sandhurst Prince, beaten just over a length by the winner with Bel Bolide in fourth and The Wonder in sixth. He ended his season in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot Racecourse in September in which he finished third behind Buzards Bay and Noalcoholic. The International Classification for 1982 saw Achieved rated on 81, making him the 19th best tree-year-old colt of the season in Europe, 13 pounds behind his stablemate Golden Fleece. Timeform rated him on 125, nine pounds behind their top-rated three-year-olds Assert and Green Forest. In their annual Racehorses of 1982 Timeforem commented that he might have had more success if he had been tried over longer distances. Stud record Achieved was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion at Winfields Farm in Kentucky where he stood at an initial fee of $12,500. He sired few foals and no Graded stakes race winners.

The Law on the Patriotic Auxiliary Service marks a significant stage towards Total War and, in the long run, in the development of German labor law. The law was a step towards the total militarization of the economy and the mobilization of all material and personnel resources in a quest to make Germany fit for industrial warfare. However, to maintain the support of the Reichstag and the loyalty of workers, the German government made numerous concessions to help avoid labor conflicts. Thus the law provided for a system of shop-level conciliation committees. In this way the state legally recognised the trade unions as equal negotiating partners with the employers. It also established the social partnerships between the economic associations of workers and employers. Thus both employee participation and trade union influence were expanded under the authority of the Reichstag. The Prussian general Wilhelm Groener, head of the newly formed Kriegsamt (equivalent to an Office for Economic Warfare), was responsible for implementing the law.

Together with her elder sister Magdalena, she was one of the earliest recognized female painters not only in Chile but in the whole of Latin America. She was also one of the first women to graduate from the Santiago School of Painting. Biography Born in Santiago in 1863, Mira was the daughter of the painter Gregorio Mira I√±iguez and his wife Mercedes Mena Alviz. Raised in a well-to-do environment, she was introduced to painting by her father who had studied under the French painter Raymond Monvoisin, the first director of the Chilean School of Painting. She went on to study under the school's third director Juan Mochi at a time when it was quite unusual for women to undertake formal art studies. In contrast to her sister who specialized in portrait painting, Aurora Mira concentrated on still-lifes, especially flowers and fruit. Chilean society was even more taken aback when the two sisters began to exhibit in the salon of the Museum of Fine Arts in 1884 under Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda's presidency. Competing with such established artists as Pedro Lira, Juan Francisco Gonz√°lez and Alfredo Valenzuela Puelma, Magdalena was awarded the Gold Medal while Aurora receive the Silver Medal.

NOVA is designed specifically for byte-addressable persistent memories and aims to provide high-performance, atomic file and metadata operations, and fault tolerance. To meet these goals NOVA combines several techniques found in other file systems. NOVA uses log structure, copy-on-write (COW), journaling, and log-structured metadata updates to provide strong atomicity guarantees, and it uses a combination replication, metadata checksums, and RAID 4 parity to protect data and metadata from media errors and software bugs. It also supports checkpoints to facilitate backups. Filesystem NOVA was developed at the University of California, San Diego, in the Non-Volatile Systems Laboratory of the Computer Science and Engineering Department. Patches were initially made available for version 4.12 of the Linux kernel. it is limited to x86-64 Linux, and not ready for merging with the upstream kernel. Log structure NOVA is primarily a log-structured file system, but it differs from other log-structured file systems in several respects. First, rather than using a single log for the entire file system, each inode has its own, dedicated log that records the updates to the inode. This allows for increased concurrency in file operations, since different threads can operate on inodes in parallel. Second, the logs do not contain file data, but only metadata updates, resulting in smaller logs. Third, the logs are not stored in physically contiguous memory. Instead, NOVA stores the logs in a linked list of 4 KB memory pages. NOVA uses the logs to provide atomicity for operations that affect a single file (e.g., writing to a file or modifying its metadata). To do this, NOVA writes a log entry to empty space past the end of the log and then atomically updates the inode's pointer to the log tail. Copy-on- write NOVA uses copy-on-write (COW) to update file data. When a program writes data to a file, NOVA allocates some unused memory pages to hold the data and writes the data into them. Then, it appends a log entry to the inode's log that points to the new pages and describes their logical location in the file. Since appending the log entry is atomic, the write is also atomic. Journaling Some file operations (e.g., moving a file from one directory to another) require modifying multiple inodes. To make these operations atomic, NOVA uses a simple journaling mechanisms. First, it writes the new log entries to ends of the inodes that the operation will affect, then it uses the journal to record the necessary updates to the inodes' log tail pointers. Next, it marks the journal as committed and applies the updates to the tail pointers. Metadata protection NOVA uses replication and checksums to provide protection against metadata corruption due to media errors and software bugs. Every metadata structure (e.g., inodes, superblocks, and log entries) contains a CRC32 checksum that allows NOVA to detect if structures contents have changed with its knowledge. NOVA also stores two copies of each data structure ‚Äì the \\"primary\\" and the \\"replica\\" ‚Äì and stores them far from one another in memory. Whenever NOVA accesses a metadata structure, it first recomputes the checksum on both the primary and the replica. If either check results in a mismatch, NOVA repairs the damage using the other copy. If neither checksum matches, then the structure is lost and NOVA returns an error. Data protection NOVA uses RAID 4 to protect file data. It divides each 4 KB page into 512-byte strips and stores a parity strip in a dedicated region of persistent memory. It also computes (and store a replica of) a CRC32 checksum for the eight data strips and the parity strip. When NOVA reads a page, it confirms the checksum on each strip. If one of the strips is corrupt, it tries to recover the strip using the parity bits. If no other strips have experienced data corruption, recovery will succeed. Otherwise, recovery fails, the contents of the page are lost, and NOVA returns an error.

The company was founded in 1996 as a consulting firm, and has since expanded its practice to become a public affairs company offering a range of services. DCI Group provides communications and advocacy services to clients including large US corporations, trade associations, non- profit organizations, educational institutions, and government organizations. Services include communication campaigns to solicit public action on legislative issues, including, it has been alleged, the creation of grass- roots fronts for corporate campaigns,. Specifically, see the infographic. and campaigns for clients on social media websites. DCI has been described as having \\"a knack for creating grassroots organizations and recruiting third party allies to advocate for a cause or an issue\\".Fraser P. Seitel, John Doorley, Rethinking Reputation: How PR Trumps Marketing and Advertising in the New Media World (St. Martin's Press 2012), p. 76. In 2006, DCI was described as a \\"Republican public relations firm\\" by ABC News, and in 2016 it was described as a \\"conservative public affairs powerhouse\\" by O'Dwyers although the firm has worked on both conservative and bipartisan causes, assisting LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign to build support for repealing the military's \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" policy for gay and lesbian personnel, supporting legislation regulating the fees that banks can charge retailers and other customers for using debit cards, and helping environmentalists to lobby against mining in northeastern Minnesota. Services DCI Group provides public relations, communications, government affairs and lobbying, and business consulting services. In addition, the firm develops and manages grassroots communications campaigns. The firm is structured into five areas of work: public relations, message development, DCI Digital, Field Force (the grassroots division), and Strategic Alliances (constituency relationships). DCI Group's main areas of expertise are in public relations and communications. In 2000, DCI Group began publishing an online magazine, Tech Central Station, \\"hosted\\" by James K. Glassman. In its original incarnation, TCS was primarily funded by sponsors, including some DCI clients, a fact reported in the Washington Monthly. The magazine reached a readership of around 100,000 per week by September 2006, when it was sold by DCI to its editor, Nick Shulz. History DCI Group was founded in 1996, by Tom Synhorst, Doug Goodyear and Tim Hyde, as a grassroots consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. and Phoenix, Arizona. Early work included organizing leadership seminars for corporate and political leaders, plus direct mail, telephone and grassroots communications. In the early 2000s, the firm launched its government affairs practice to provide advocacy services for clients, including companies such as AT&T; and institutions such as the University of Arizona. By 2005 the company had more than a hundred employees, and counted blue-chip and Fortune 50 companies among its clients. Notable clients have included Microsoft, VeriChip Corporation, Boeing, General Motors, and the U.S. Telecom Association. In addition to its client campaigns, DCI's digital team has carried out research into the use of social media. In early 2011 it released a report which compared the use of social media services such as Twitter and Facebook on a state-by-state basis. Notable work Early 2000s Several DCI partners and executives had roles advocating for George W. Bush in the 2000 United States presidential election.Michael J. Malbin, ed., The Election After Reform (2006), p. 87-88. Many of those same individuals similarly advocated for Bush's reelection in the 2004 United States presidential election, with DCI Group providing contractual services for the 2004 Republican National Convention. DCI's first overseas project came in 2002, when DCI Group was hired by Myanmar's military junta, following the release of political prisoners in the state, including Aung San Suu Kyi. DCI's work for the government included public relations efforts to improve the leadership's image in the U.S., raising the profile of more moderate officials and emphasizing its negotiations with Suu Kyi. According to media reports, the firm was paid $348,000 to represent the Myanmar government. DCI Group ended its contract with the Myanmar government in 2003. Also among DCI's earlier public relations campaigns was the 2006 launch of Aqua Sciences' water harvesting technology, which was named by Time magazine as one of its best inventions of 2006. DCI Group offers a number of different communications services, including corporate communication, crisis management, new media development and message development. The company was also retained by the LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign to build support for repealing the military's \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" policy related to gay and lesbian personnel. Also in 2006, authorship of a popular YouTube video parodying Al Gore's global warming documentary An Inconvenient Truth was alleged to have been traced back to DCI Group through routing information in e-mails from the author to the Wall Street Journal. The alleged production of the video by DCI Group led to critical coverage of the company in the media, due in part to its work for ExxonMobil. DCI Group did not admit or deny involvement with the video. In addition to its traditional public relations and communications work, it was asserted that the firm engaged in \\"astroturfing\\", i.e. the creation of front groups that serve corporate interests while posing as grassroots activists. This type of campaigning was alleged to be an early focus for the firm, which has continued to develop and manage such campaigns using such strategies as direct mail and social media. Late 2000s to early 2010s In 2008 it was reported that the company had done extensive work for federal mortgage company Freddie Mac, running a multi-state effort against Republican Senator Chuck Hagel's bill to tightly regulate the company. Freddie Mac acknowledged the hire, and DCI stated it had complied with \\"all applicable federal and state laws and regulations\\". In May 2008, DCI Group's Doug Goodyear and Doug Davenport resigned from the John McCain presidential campaign following media coverage that was critical of the company's past work for the Myanmar government. According to Goodyear, they resigned in order to prevent further distraction from McCain's campaign. In the late 2000s, DCI mobilized employees of the Education Management Corporation against a proposed regulation focused on for-profit colleges. It was one part of an overall industry effort that resulted in more than 90,000 comments being received by the Department of Education, more than for any previous rule. In 2011, the company produced a campaign for the Retail Industry Leaders Association, arranging for small business owners to meet with their senators and holding press events, as part of the organization's campaign supporting the Durbin Amendment regulating bank debit card transaction fees. DCI Group was recognized for its work on the effort, with Bloomberg News writing: \\"Within a few months, DCI Group, a Washington-based public affairs firm hired by the retailers, assembled an e-mail list of more than 20 million small-business owners. They arranged 23 meetings between merchants and senators or their aides and held press events in Tennessee, Ohio and Wisconsin -- home to senators on the Banking Committee\\". The Hill named the passage of the amendment the top lobbying victory of 2011. During that same period, when T. Boone Pickens sought to develop support for replacing coal and oil with natural gas as the primary fuel source in the United States, he engaged DCI Group to build support for the effort. Pickens turned to trusted counselor Jay Rosser for this effort, and Rosser \\"reached out to Tom Synhorst, managing partner and chairman of DCI Group\\". DCI \\"signed up on the spot after hearing Mr. Pickens's vision for the campaign\\", and Synhorst then \\"became the quarterback\\" and with Rosser, \\"assembled a powerhouse research, creative, public relations and online team\\". In the 2010s, the firm also assisted proponents of palm oil in countering negative views of the product, highlighting the importance of the crop to small farmers in the affected countries. In 2013, the Corporate Europe Observatory reported that DCI Group has also had close ties to the European Privacy Association, an EU lobby group. EDRi asserts that EPA has used the services of both DCI and an Italian lobbying firm, Competere, the staff of which \\"overlaps\\" with DCI Group. Mid-2010s to 2020 In 2015-16 in the negotiations regarding the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis, DCI reportedly worked with BlueMountain Capital, as well as the Raben Group and the 60 Plus Association in focusing opposition to Congressional approval of the bankruptcy option for the commonwealth. Following the election of Donald Trump, DCI, based on its history as an organizer of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shareholders, was brought into a coalition formed by investor John Paulson having the goal of bringing about investor-friendly changes to the national mortgage markets.Joe Light, \\"A winning bet on Trump\\", The Journal Times (November 24, 2016), p. A10. In 2018, DCI registered as a lobbyist on behalf of Process and Industrial Developments Ltd., an energy company that had successfully sued the Nigerian government for billions of dollars for work on a project in that country, and which sought to persuade the Nigerian government to honor the judgment awarded. In January 2020, it was reported that an environmental group had secured the services of DCI Group to help lobby against mining in northeastern Minnesota.

Background  The fire started on the second and upper floors of the madrasa building, which quickly spread throughout most of the building, preventing the only entrance which trapped the occupants from escaping. Many windows were also fitted with bolted grills that made it difficult for occupants to save themselves. Neighbouring witnesses reported that they were awaken at dawn by the cries of the students who were trapped inside the building and tried to save them but could not do so because the fire spread very quickly with many of them still trapped behind the metal window grills, adding that those who survived managed to escape by jumping directly to the ground while others through the building water pipelines. The fire was finally contained by the fire department at around 6:40 am.  Victims  Twenty three of the madrasa residents were killed in the incident, twenty one were students and two were teachers. Their names and ages are as follow: # Muhammad Danieal Md Amin, age 14 # Ahmad Rijal Mohammad Rodzi, 13 # Muhammad Hasrullah Ismaik, 14 # Muhammad Haikal Abdullah, 12 # Muhammad Aidil Aqmal Mohd Zamzuri, 10 # Muhammaf Fahmie Abdullah, 11 # Muhammad Afiq Haqimie Hairulizwan, 11 # Muhammad Aiman Ramzanudin, 12 # Azkar Dariemi F.

Initially, the firefighters thought it may be due to short circuit but after a full investigation and through CCTVs outside the building, several suspects were identified to have infiltrated the area at around 3:10 am. Through other CCTVs footage retrieved from five nearest petrol stations, the intruding suspects had earlier seen buying petrol at one of the station at 1:30 am in a Yamaha Lagenda motorcycle. Around seven suspects were identified by police to be involved and most of them were apprehended on 16 September and detained at Jinjang Police Station lock-up. Survivors were detained at the Ministry of Defence tent set outside the madrasa before being placed in secret premises around Keramat earlier on 15 September. The number of survivors were also kept confidential. Only the closest relatives are allowed to enter the premises to protect them from being approached by the public. Kuala Lumpur police chief Amar Singh concluded in a special press conference that the suspects were believed to have committed the crime out of revenge due to incidents of taunts among the students of the madrasa and the suspects. According to him, six out of seven suspects were tested positive for drugs and two of them had previous criminal records relating to the offence of rioting and stealing vehicles. All suspects are aged between 11 and 18 years old.  Reactions  The tragedy has gained considerable attentions among the government, the public as well as from media abroad. Al Jazeera described the incident as \\"the most devastating fire in Malaysia since the beginning of the year\\".  Government  The tragedy has been widely covered by leaders from both sides of the parties. Yang di-Pertuan Agong, Sultan Muhammad V and Prime Minister Najib Razak had visited the scene. Najib has sent condolences to all victims involved and urged all madrasa to comply with safety standards and regulations to ensure similar incidents do not recur in the future. Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Zahid Hamidi was the first to arrive at the scene in the afternoon after the incident. He mentioned the lack of control and training of madrasas that led to various incidents such as fires, torture and the opening of illegal madrasas as well the appointment of an ustaz without any legal certification or qualification. Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad expressed his disappointment as the incident seemed to indicate that no lesson was taken from a similar incident in 1989.

The family left Cuba in 1966 for Florida, where her father became a boat builder and her mother a factory worker. She graduated from Miami Central High School in 1969 and married Aldo Oliveros soon afterwards. The couple had two daughters.

It occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean as well as on both coasts of North America. It burrows in muddy sand from the mid-tidal zone downwards and conceals itself in crevices and under stones. Description Lineus sanguineus is an elongate worm with a slender body growing to a length of about . The head has the eversible proboscis typical of nemertean worms and four to six eyes on either side. In colour it varies from a bright reddish-brown to a more sombre medium brown, sometimes with up to twenty narrow paler bands, and the ventral part and the posterior portion are often paler than the rest of the body. It is very similar in appearance to Lineus ruber, but the eyes are set further back on the head and are more neatly arranged. Unlike L. ruber, when disturbed it coils up into a tangled ball, whereas L. ruber merely contracts, becoming shorter and stouter in the process. Distribution and habitat L. sanguineus occurs on the coasts of northwestern Europe, its range extending from Sweden southwards through the North Sea to the British Isles, Belgium and France. It is also recorded in North America, including in the Bay of Fundy, in Brandy Cove, in the Digdeguash Estuary and in the Gulf of Maine, as well as the Pacific coast. It is typically found burrowing in muddy sand, including blackish sediment with a high content of organic matter, under stones and rocks, in crevices and among coralline algae in the intertidal zone, from mid- beach downwards. There is some uncertainty about the precise range because of the lack of exact identification of specimens, especially those collected several decades ago. Biology This ribbon worm is a detritivore and grazer. It is rather fragile, and any attempt to collect it is likely to end with the worm breaking in pieces. However, it is able to regenerate itself from any fragment that is at least half as long as the worm's diameter; each piece can develop into a complete new worm in three to four weeks. In fact this appears to be a form of asexual reproduction, the worm dividing along pre-arranged fracture lines; tiny pieces may form cysts, with the new worms developing inside these.

The venture is a partnership with the African- American Clergy Medical Research Initiative, a group of clergy leaders in Baltimore. Research suggests that neuropsychiatric diagnoses are 20% more frequent in African-American communities than in communities of European ancestry.Jennifer Couzin-Frankel. New effort aims to study brain diseases in African-Americans. Science, March 22, 2019.Daniel R. Weinberger, Alvin C. Hathaway Sr. Research will support personalized medicine for African Americans. Baltimore Sun, March 21, 2019.In studies of brain disorders, individuals of African descent make up, on average, less than 5% of research cohorts. Lieber Institute Director Daniel R. Weinberger wrote that individuals of African ancestry must be included in research for brain illnesses. The African Ancestry Neuroscience Research Initiative will generate brain gene and protein expression profiles for people of African ancestry, a group that is greatly underrepresented in research examining the genetic causes of diseases. Lack of research involving African Americans is problematic because African Americans are 20% more likely to experience serious mental health problems than the general population and are about twice as likely to develop Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Suicide rates for African American children aged 5‚Äì11 are twice as high as comparable individuals of European ancestry even after controlling for socioeconomic factors.Daniel R.

Early and family life The son of Reuben Moore Walton and his wife, the former Mary Ann Harrison (1807-1879), Moses was named for his paternal grandfather, Moses Walton (1775-1847), who had been sheriff of Shenandoah County, as well as served in the both houses of the Virginia General Assembly.

It is a Grade II listed building. History Croydon's first town hall, which was located on the west side of the High Street, was initially intended as a market house and was completed in 1566: it was subsequently used as a town hall until it was demolished in 1807. The second town hall, which was built on the site of the first town hall, was designed by Samuel Pepys Cockerell in the classical style and completed in 1808; it was demolished as part of the town's High Street widening scheme in 1893. After civic leaders found that the town hall in the High Street was inadequate for their needs, they elected to construct a purpose-built town hall: they chose the site of Central Croydon railway station, which was redeveloped for council use in 1895, as part of a plan to install \\"Municipal Offices, Courts, a Police Station, Library and many other public purposes and yet leave a considerable margin of land which might be disposed of\\". The building, which was designed by Charles Henman in the Victorian style and built in red brick by Messrs. W.H. Lascelles & Co, was officially opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales on 19 May 1896. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with nine bays facing onto Katherine Street; the central section featured an arched porch on the ground floor; there was a large segmented window on the first floor and five narrow round headed windows on the second floor with the borough coat of arms above. A tall tower was erected adjacent to the west of the main building and to the west of that was Braithwaite Hall, with pitched roof and turret, and the corn exchange, with loggia. Braithwaite Hall was named after the Revd John Masterman Braithwaite (1846‚Äì1889), a former vicar of Croydon. Internally, the principal rooms were the council chamber, the mayor's parlour and the committee rooms. A statue of Queen Victoria, which was sculpted by Francis John Williamson, was erected outside the town hall in 1903. The building served as the headquarters of the County Borough of Croydon for much of the 20th century and went to become the local seat of government of the enlarged London Borough of Croydon on its formation in 1965. Council officers and their departments moved out to Taberner House, located to the south east of the town hall, in 1967. The whole building, including the council chamber, the mayor's parlour and committee rooms, was extensively renovated in the late-1980s and early 1990s. This enabled parts of the building which were not required for council meetings to be re-purposed as an arts venue known as the Croydon Clocktower in 1994. At the same time a new public library was established in a new structure behind the town hall and the old local studies library was converted for use as the new David Lean Cinema. Meanwhile, Braithwaite Hall continued to be made available for concerts, theatre and children's shows. After Taberner House became inefficient to operate, council officers and their departments moved to Bernard Weatherill House, located to the south of the town hall, in May 2013.

It is based on Steven Wilson's song Drive Home. The game was released for PlayStation 4 and Windows in August 2017. Plot Last Day of June is centred around a couple called Carl and June, who suffer a tragedy when a car accident takes June's life and leaves Carl in a wheelchair. One day, Carl touches one of June's paintings of people who had been present on the day of the accident and discovers that he can revisit their past memories. As Carl relives their memories, the characters can perform actions that change the sequence of events that led up to June's death. Carl manages to prevent the initial accident, but another event causes the car crash. He continues to change events multiple times, but each attempt still results in the accident by different circumstances. In the finale of the game, Carl realizes that he cannot change that someone dies that day, so he switches places with June, sacrificing himself instead, saving her and their unborn child. However, shortly before the end of the game, Carl finds a sketchbook made by June which lists attempts by her to save him, rather than the other way around. Nate Hohl of All Gamers proposes instead that wheelchair-bound Carl is June's fantasy and manifestation of grief, while the game's final revelation is her recovery. Gameplay Last Day of June is an adventure puzzle video game in third-person perspective. The player initially controls Carl who is on a date with June on the day leading up to their accident. Afterwards, the player controls Carl in their home at a later date and discovers that they can interact with June's paintings. This allows the player to take control of various characters from the day of the accident in an attempt to solve puzzles to alter the sequence of events that indirectly caused the accident. As the player fails to prevent June's death, new paintings and characters are unlocked to allow for an increasingly complex sequence of changes. Score Development and release Last Day of June was developed by Italian studio Ovosonico and published by 505 Games. The game was directed by Massimo Guarini. Guarini based Last Day of June on the song \\"Drive Home\\" by British musician Steven Wilson. Wilson himself was involved in composing music for the game. The game was announced in May 2017. It was released for PlayStation 4 and Windows on 31 August 2017. Reception Last Day of June was received favourably by critics. Eurogamer ranked it 33rd on their list of the \\"Top 50 Games of 2017\\", while Polygon ranked it 38th on their list of the 50 best games of 2017.

The Klexikon community of editors decides per consensus which articles should be created next so as to assure that the most important topics, school subjects and areas of interest of children are covered. Klexikon was supported by Wikimedia Germany in creating the concept of an online encyclopedia for children. The concept was then refined by cooperating with Technical University of Dortmund and Technical University of Cologne. Reception The German Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth considers the site a \\"useful\\" children's encyclopedia. According to the voluntary self control associtation of German television, Klexikon's advantage is that unlike Wikipedia it is specifically written for children. The Austrian School Portal wrote that Klexikon was a \\"great work of reference\\" which provided content that was specifically balanced for children. The Merz magazine noted that Klexikon was an online source of information with relatively reliable content, but criticised that articles did not provide any sources. This was contrary to the need of sensitising school children for marking secondary information as such.

The complex is located near Delsj√∂n in eastern Gothenburg, Sweden. The original buildings were constructed 1959‚Äì1961, but were demolished in 2011 to give place to a new building complex. The new building was subsequently opened in 2012. The complex also houses two full-size football pitches. Old Kamratg√•rden The western part of old Kamratg√•rden, including office and administration. Before Kamratg√•rden, IFK owned a clubhouse called \\"Lilla Sj√∂dala\\" located in Pixbo outside Gothenburg since 1946. The house was mostly used by the orienteering and athletics sections of IFK, and was sold in 1964. A more central location was sought, and in August 1959 IFK acquired a lease for of land near Delsj√∂n. The plans for this new centre included a full-size grass football pitch, athletics facilities, a clubhouse with changing rooms, a social room and sauna, to a cost of SEK 150,000. The building complex was officially opened on 1 October 1961, and expanded in 1964 with a large storehouse. A second football pitch (with dirt surface) was completed in 1968, allowing for football training at Kamratg√•rden during wintertime. During 1970‚Äì1976 additional changing rooms were added and floodlighting was added in 1975. The eastern part of old Kamratg√•rden, with kitchen and dining room. A kitchen facility, staff room and additional storehouses were built in 1984. The administrative staff of the club were not stationed at Kamratg√•rden until 1992, when a office building was added, before that the office and visiting address of IFK G√∂teborg was located on Drottninggatan in central Gothenburg.. A second grass pitch was added in 1994, and a year later an indoor hall (without heating) for seven-a-side football and training was completed some 500 metres from the main buildings. The indoor hall was destroyed by heavy snowfall in early 2010, but rebuilt and reopened in December 2010. These mentioned additions and further additions such as a gym and additional social rooms in 1996‚Äì1997, had increased the total floor area from the initial to by 2004. New Kamratg√•rden The east wing of Kamratg√•rden, fronted by Kamratstenen. When H√•kan Mild ended his playing career in 2005 and took over as director of sports for IFK G√∂teborg, he also initiated a discussion regarding the standards of Kamratg√•rden together with then club director Seppo Vaihela. All stand-alone additions and modifications over the years had not only decreased the aesthetics of Kamratg√•rden but also increased the cost of maintaining and keeping Kamratg√•rden in repair. As ideas started to realise, IFK took several offers from building contractors, settling on Sefa who also started sponsoring the club. The initial cost of SEK 35 million was decreased to around 30 million. Around 3 million of the cost was sponsored by individuals who bought a spot for their name on Kamratstenen (), a stone with a four-pointed star cross section, the symbol of Idrottsf√∂reningen Kamraterna. The names of all players reaching 200 matches for the club are also added to the star. Overview of Kamratg√•rden, the sports area is on the left and the administrative area on the right. The decision to build the new Kamratg√•rden was taken on 22 October 2010, and the old buildings were demolished in February 2011, just a few months shy of 50 years in existence. Construction was started on 12 February 2011 and finished in December the same year. New Kamratg√•rden was opened on 18 March 2012, without any time delay or additional costs accrued during the building process. Some 2,000 persons visited the opening which also featured the inauguration of Kamratstenen. The new two- floor building is divided into two areas. The administrative area has offices, meeting rooms, media room, reception, kitchen and dining room for 140 people. The sports area houses three changing rooms (one for the senior team, one for the youth team and one guest changing room), gym, bath, sauna, offices for coaching staff, a player's lounge and additional rooms. Due to weak finances, IFK G√∂teborg decided to sell Kamratg√•rden to an external partner in late 2015. The agreement released funds needed to secure the economy, while at the same time allowing IFK to rent the facilities without increased operating costs. IFK G√∂teborg also secured the rights to buy back the complex at any time the club wants to do so. IFK G√∂teborg was the first elite team in Sweden to install hybrid grass, with one of the two pitches at Kamratg√•rden changed to the new surface during the winter of 2016/2017. Starting in 2017, the under-19 and under-21 teams of the IFK G√∂teborg Academy play their matches on the new pitch.

Real or perceived threat in the environment elicits stress response in animals, which disrupts internal homeostasis. Physiological changes cause behavioural responses in animals, including: impairment of response inhibition and lack of motivation, as well as changes in social, sexual, aggression and nurture behaviour in animals. The extent of the impact is dependent upon the type and duration of the stress, as well as the animal's past experiences. Behavioural responses to prolonged stress can also be transferred across generations.  Overview  A stress, as defined to Walter Cannon (1871‚Äì1945), is any disturbance that imbalances the internal environment of an organism (i.e. their homeostasis). There are two major types of stressors that cause stress to animals: abiotic stressors and biotic stressors.Romero, L. M., & Wingfield, J. C. (2016). Tempests, poxes, predators, and people: stress in wild animals and how they cope. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Abiotic stressors are any ecological, geological, or climate changes that causes stress to the animal, such as increased temperatures and natural disasters. Biotic stressors are living things related complications that causes stress, such as dominance, pollution, infection, social pressures, and competition. Animals can respond with physiological responses, behavioural responses, psychological responses, or physical responses (fight-or-flight). Canon argued that there are two possible choices that an organism may choose when stress is encountered: fight responses or flight responses.  Behavioural responses  Behavioural responses to stress are evoked from some underlying complex physiological changes that arise consequently from stress.  Impairment of response inhibition and lack of motivation  According to a study conducted by Mika and his colleagues, prolonged stress in rats causes response inhibition. It was evident through their experiment that stressed rats had inhibited premature responses (decreased timing of intervals to food), along with decreased intrinsic motivation to initiate a response. They link the decreased motivation to the stress-associated reduction in incentive motivation, as presented by another study conducted by Kleen and his colleagues. Decreased motivation was also seen in a study conducted by Beery and Kaufer, where they explained that stressed rodents are less likely to be motivated to interact with one another.  Change in social behaviours  Beery and Kaufer noted that social withdrawal and general reduction in social interaction after an exposure to a stressor are evident in rodents. They argue that this is due to the underlying physiological changes that the rodent goes through in response to stress. For instance, the changes that occur to the hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal (HPA) hormonal axis is directly related to the changes in social behaviour. Social avoidance is another consequence of stress that can be seen in rodents. Rodents are more likely to avoid dominant rats and avoid social interactions amongst each other after the exposure to a stressor.  Sexual behaviours  Sexual interests change in many species when exposed to stressors. For instance, stressed male and female rats express inhibited mating behaviour, which is evident through the clear increase in the inhibitory hormone RF-amide. Another study suggests that masculine sexual behaviour in male rats is subject to changes in accordance to the type of stressors that the rats were subjected to. The female zebra finch's mating choice is determined by the stressors that they are exposed to early in life, which remain consistent throughout adulthood. A study about stress effects on female songbird‚Äôs response to sexual signal for mating indicated that the response to this specific signal can be impaired if the female is exposed to developmental stress. Behavioural changes as a result from developmental stress impairs neural responses to sexual signals, which reduces mating.  Aggressive behaviours and anti-predator responses  Stressed animals would choose to avoid a novel situation rather than confront it. Aggressive behaviour is associated with sex hormones, such as testosterone, and specific brain regions and systems, such as the medial preoptic nucleus, prefrontal cortex-dependent response inhibition, and anterior hypothalamus. Stress negatively impacts sex hormones, which results in an imbalance and reduction in aggression related hormones and function. Also, chronic stress results in prefrontal cortex-dependent response inhibition. This results in reduction in aggression, thus promoting anti-predator responses.  Prolonged stress reduces parental behaviour toward offspring  Prolonged stress alters parental behaviour toward offspring and promotes parental neglect. According to a study performed by Tilgar and associates, predation stress alters parents‚Äô behaviours, such as the reduction in provisioning rates, which negatively impacts the offspring‚Äôs performance. The hormones oxytocin and vasopressin are generally responsible for affiliative and pair-bonding behaviours in many species. Stress alters the level of both hormones, resulting in an abnormal behaviour from parents towards offspring. For instance, levels of oxytocin decrease as a result of prolonged stress, which has been shown to reduce pair-bonding behaviour and increase withdrawal behaviour. Prolactin is another important hormone that is associated with nurture by parents to offspring, and levels of this hormone can be altered as a result of stress. Reduced levels of prolactin as a result of stress decreases behaviours such as suckling, licking, and brooding.  Transgenerational responses Behavioural response to stress can be transmitted from parents to offspring. When an offspring observes the expression of behaviour such as fear in response to a stress stimulus, the same response would be elicited in the offspring when the stimulus is presented. Debeik and associates illustrated in rodents that fear is transferred from mother to infant in response to a certain odour stimulus. They further proved that the neural activity, such as the basal amygdala activity of the offspring‚Äôs brain, illustrated fear response.

The United States' National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) placed the magnitude at 4.3 and 4.8 . This moderate magnitude event resulted in a maximum MSK intensity of VII (Very strong) to VIII (Damaging). An independent investigation estimated the total losses at $160 million (US) while the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters estimated the total losses at 350 million. Between five and seven were killed, 52‚Äì70 were injured, and more than 1,000 were left homeless. Tectonic setting Tsblisi lies near the northern boundary of the complex zone of deformation associated with the continuing collision between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. To the north, the mountains of the Greater Caucasus are a result of active thrust tectonics, linking eastwards to the Apsheron sill. To the south, the Lesser Caucasus mountains are also a result of active thrust tectonics. The whole Caucasus region is affected by earthquakes, with the largest known being associated with the active front of the Greater Caucasus thrust belt, such as the 1991 Racha earthquake. Tblisi itself has relatively low seismicity, although there are historical records of damaging earthquakes, such as the event in 1896, which had an estimated intensity of VII (MSK), the strongest known earthquake to have affected Tblisi during historical times. Earthquake The earthquake was preceded by a series of foreshocks, of which the largest was M 3.5 on April 11. The mainshock had an estimated magnitude of 4.7 (ISC), 4.8 (ANSS), 4.5 , with an estimate hypocentral depth of 13.6 km (ISC), 10.0 km (ANSS), 5.0 km and 3.0 km. The mainshock produced higher intensity shaking than would normally be expected for an earthquake of that magnitude. The frequency was also unusually high (maximum 5 Hz) and the duration was short. The epicenter was located centrally within the city of Tblisi, something that had not been considered in earlier studies of potential seismic source zones. Damage The unusually high frequency of the shaking, combined with the short duration, meant that there was little damage to larger buildings or those built using reinforced concrete. The most affected buildings were, in contrast, low-rise brick or stone built, which were concentrated in the older part of the city. Buildings affected during the mainshock were further damaged by some of the aftershocks. A total of 18,000 households were badly affected, leaving 69,000 people homeless. There was also significant damage to some schools and hospitals. Between five and seven people died as a result of the earthquake and a further 52‚Äì70 were injured.

As of the late 2010s, Rozelle has spent over 30 years doing research heavily based on the agriculture, economics, and education of mainland China. Biography Scott Rozelle was born on a ranch located in Los Angeles, California in 1955 as a fifth- generation Californian. His father was an agricultural economist who owned a commercial agribusiness magazine that initially introduced agriculture to him. At the time, few high schools in the country could provide Chinese classes to students; however, since the U.S. government made efforts to enhance Chinese language education even before its diplomatic relations with China were re- established, Rozelle was able to learn Chinese at his own junior high school in 1966, at the age of 12. In 1974, Rozelle was completing his undergraduate studies at Cornell University but eventually stayed in Taiwan for three years through a student exchange program, although he originally planned to stay there for only three months. As China‚ÄìUnited States relations were being normalized in 1979, Rozelle received a B.S. degree from the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. While he was working toward his Masters at Cornell in 1982, Rozelle attempted to perform researches regarding \\"the system of contract labor in rural areas\\" in Shandong, China through applying for the fund by the United States National Science Foundation. Nevertheless, the plan was not successful and Rozelle ended up leaving school temporarily to work until about two years later, he was sent to China by Cornell as an instructor of Western economics upon receiving an invitation from Nanjing Agricultural University. Due to his strong interest in \\"poverty alleviation in rural areas\\", Rozelle picked hybrid rice production as the subject of his doctoral dissertation and acquired his Ph.D from the Department of Agricultural Economics of Cornell University in 1991. In 1995, with the joint effort from Jikun Huang, a Chinese agricultural economist he met during a meeting of the International Rice Research Institute in Manila, Philippines, Rozelle co-founded the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy that later became a part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China. He was also an assistant professor at the Food Research Institute at Stanford University through 1990 to 1997 and started serving as a professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the University of California, Davis since 1997. Since 2006, Rozelle has been a Helen Farnsworth Endowed Senior Fellow at both the Freeman Spogli Institute of International Studies and the Department of Economics at Stanford. Research  Rozelle knows Chinese well and his research is mostly associated with agricultural policies, economic institutions, and poverty and inequality in China. Over the years, Rozelle has published some 300 articles related to development problems of China, in journals such as the Journal of Economic Literature, Science, Nature, and The American Economic Review. Additionally, he has made efforts to improve the living condition of school-aged children, such as suggesting plans for nutrition and educational efficiency. Through his perennial research, Rozelle indicated that the education in China has downsides that reflect noticeable disadvantages of the poor people, given billions of yuan Chinese government spent on education systems would possibly \\"go to waste\\" if students are not in a proper health condition. Iron-deficiency anemia According to a report published by Chinese magazine Caixin in 2015, Rozelle's team collected data in regions such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia, and concluded that, in northwestern China, iron-deficiency anemia appeared to be common for nearly 40% of students in fourth and fifth grade, causing poor health condition to children in rural areas. During his visits to numerous villages, Rozelle noticed that food varieties such as steamed buns, noodles, and rice compromised a major portion of rural children's diet, whereas meat and fresh vegetables and fruit were pretty scarce. In response to situations like this, the Chinese government implemented a policy that would provide every child in poor areas with healthy lunches, at the cost of 3 to 4 yuan each. But Rozelle's team made the estimation that only two daily servings of fresh vegetables and meat costing 7 to 8 yuan each would suffice the amount of iron needed for those children, meaning a real effective solution could largely increase the demand for funds. A possible approach Rozelle put forth was helping them to fight against the anemia by introducing vitamin tablets ‚Äì the effect of which would not be optimal, but it would cost way less and help much more. Intestinal parasite In Guizhou and other regions in southern China where climates are similar, Rozelle discovered that intestinal parasites were affecting several million school-aged children. 50% of children in the areas being investigated suffered from at least one type of parasite, such as roundworm, hookworm, and whip worm. Rozelle's team filed relevant reports to local governments in 2010 in an attempt to highlight the seriousness, but the issue had not been resolved promptly, as Rozelle observed in another visit to Guizhou 3 years later that parasites still persisted. Even so, he did not give up proposing potential solutions by pointing out that one deworming tablet would cost 2 yuan and taking two every six months would be enough for a child to get rid of parasites in a timely manner. Nearsightedness Rozelle calculated that, on average, nearsightedness could be found on 30% of China's students aging from 10 to 12, yet he visited thousands of primary schools in the rural areas and found out that wearing glasses was not common at all, and only one or two out of one hundred middle school students had a pair of glasses. This led to further failure for the vision problems of 24% primary school students and 57% middle school students to be treated promptly, even though, Rozelle discovered, these students' academic performances were heavily affected by their vision.

He is a partner at McGuire Woods, where he chairs the Government Investigations Department and co-chairs the Appellate Team. Adams ran for Attorney General of Virginia in 2017 and received the Republican nomination, but was defeated in the general election by incumbent Democrat Mark Herring. Adams is a member of the Adams political family. Early and family life Adams is the youngest of four brothers. His grandfather, Rev. Theodore F. Adams (1898‚Äì1980),findagrave no. 15909757 led the First Baptist Church of Richmond (1936‚Äì1968), and the Baptist World Alliance (1955-1960). He was born into the prominent Adams family. After graduation from Midlothian High School, Adams attended the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) and became executive officer of the VMII Corps of Cadets. Adams graduated from VMI as a distinguished graduate with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1996. Military service and legal education After commissioning out of VMI as an ensign in the U.S. Navy, Adams served two tours of duty, from 1996 to 2000, including deployment to Iraq during the decade-long Operation Southern Watch. Adams lived in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, as well as Virginia Beach during his military service. Upon leaving the Navy in 2000, Adams attended the University of Virginia School of Law in Charlotteville, where he became managing editor of the law review. After graduation, he clerked for Judge David B. Sentelle of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2003‚Äì2004. After working at Hunton & Williams, LLP, he clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas at the United States Supreme Court in 2006‚Äì2007. Career Adams joined the Office of White House Counsel in 2007 as an associate counsel in the administration of President George W. Bush, and lived in Arlington, Virginia. He dealt with matters arising from the U.S. Department of Defense and U.S. State Department. In 2008, Adams returned to Richmond, serving as an assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. Among his cases, Adams prosecuted John W. Forbes, a former state finance secretary who pleaded guilty and in late 2010 was sentenced to serve 10 years in prison for diverting about $4 million of a $5 million grant from the state Tobacco Indemnification and Community Revitalization Commission (which had intended to improve literacy in Southside Virginia and southwestern Virginia) to shell companies he controlled and his personal benefit. In 2010 Adams joined McGuire Woods as a partner, and has conducted a private legal practice there since, other than his leave of absence during his Attorney General run. He heads the firm‚Äôs government investigations and white-collar litigation department and co-chairs the appellate team, where according to the Richmond Times Dispatch, most of his cases have concerned matters in states other than Virginia. His elder brother Theodore F. \\"Tray\\" Adams III works for McGuire Woods Consulting as senior vice president of state government relations. In 2013, Adams led the successful defense of a bank executive in a ten-week jury trial brought by the Department of Justice, while four other defendants were convicted. In 2014, Adams was appointed by the Fourth Circuit as amicus counsel in U.S. v. Williams, to defend the decision of a U.S. District Judge concerning certain provisions of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines with which both the U.S. Attorney's office and defendant disagreed (as ultimately did the appellate panel). Adams filed two successful briefs in cases in the United States Supreme Court opposing parts of the Affordable Care Act as inconsistent with the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. In 2014, representing 15 members of Congress, Adams filed an amicus brief concerning the law's contraception mandate, which the Supreme Court ultimately struck down in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. The following year Adams filed an amicus brief on behalf of an order of nuns in one of the cases consolidated in Zubik v. Burwell, which the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately sent down to the relevant appellate courts after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and further briefing. 2017 campaign for Attorney General of Virginia A Republican, Adams ran for Attorney General of Virginia against incumbent Democrat Mark Herring in 2017. He secured the Republican nomination after the initial frontrunner, Del. Rob Bell, withdrew from the race and Chuck Smith failed to qualify for the primary ballot. The Virginia State Bar organized a debate between the two attorney general candidates in Virginia Beach on June 19, 2017. Their final debate was hosted by the Loudoun Chamber of Commerce on October 20, 2017. Adams portrayed himself as a classic conservative. The majority of Adams' campaign funds were donated through the Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA). In March 2017, RAGA abandoned its previous agreement not to target the other party's incumbents in the general election. The Democratic Attorneys General group donated $1.75 million to Herring, thus becoming the largest donor to his campaign. Both candidates claimed to want to remove politics from the office, but by Labor Day Weekend, televised attack ads had begun. As the election neared and absentee voting began in Virginia, such ads increased. The Campus Election Engagement Project published a nonpartisan list of their respective campaign positions. Herring defeated Adams on Election Day, by a margin of 168,551 votes (6.6% of the total vote). Personal Adams and his wife Lisa have four sons.

In the following year he was beaten in his first two races and finished sixth in The Derby before emerging as one of the best colts of his generation in Europe with wins in the Irish Derby and the St Leger. He won the Alleged Stakes on his four-year-old debut but failed to win in eleven subsequent starts and was retired from racing at the end of 2019. Background Capri is a grey horse bred in Ireland by Lynch Bages Ltd & Camas Park Stud, breeding companies associated with the Coolmore Stud organisation. The colt was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. Like many Coolmore horses, the official details of his ownership have changed from race to race: he has sometimes been listed as being the property of Susan Magnier, while on other occasions he has been described as being owned by a partnership of Derrick Smith, Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier. The name \\"Capri\\" had previously been used for numerous other horses including a high-class stayer who won the Cumberland Lodge Stakes in 1998. He was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo is now one of the world's leading stallions and has been champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland eight times so far. His other progeny include Cape Blanco, Frankel, Golden Lilac, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found, Minding and Ruler of the World. Capri's dam Dialafara, from whom he inherited his grey colour, showed no racing ability, finishing last in her only race. She was a daughter of the Prix de Malleret winner Diamalina and a descendant of the British broodmare Padus (foaled 1955) who was the ancestor of many other major winners including Pampapaul, Arctic Owl and Victoire Pisa. Racing career 2016: two-year- old season Capri made his racecourse debut in maiden race over seven furlongs at the Curragh on 16 July and finished second of the thirteen runners, beaten half a length by Arcada. Two weeks later at Galway Races he started 2/7 favourite for a maiden over eight and a half furlongs and recorde his first success as he took the lead three furlongs from the finish and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and a half length from Rekindling. Seven days after his win at Galway the colt was stepped up in class for the Listed Canford Cliffs Stakes at Tipperary Racecourse and started 8/11 favourite against six opponents. Ridden as on his two previous starts by Seamie Heffernan he went to the front soon after the start and kept on well to win by two lengths. Ryan Moore took the ride when Capri reappeared in the Group 2 Beresford Stakes on heavy ground at the Curragh on 25 September. Starting the odds-on favourite in a six-runner field he raced in third place before taking the lead a furlong out and won by three quarters of a length from his stablemate Yucatan. Aidan O'Brien said of the winner \\"Capri is a nice moving horse and should prefer better ground\\". On his final appearance of the season Capri was sent to France and started favourite for the Group 1 Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud over 2000 metres on 30 October. He stayed on well in the straight without ever looking likely to win and finished third of the thirteen runners behind Waldgeist and Best Solution. His stablemate Wings of Eagles finished ninth. 2017: three- year-old season In his first race as a three-year-old, Capri contested the Group 3 Ballysax Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 8 April. After briefly struggling to obtain a clear run in the straight he was not given a hard ride by Heffernan and finished fourth behind Rekindling, Douglas Macarthur and Yucatan. The Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial over the same course and distance on 7 May resulted in a three-way photo-finish between the O'Brien stable's representatives as the front-running Douglas Macarthur beat Yucatan by a head with Capri a short head away in third. Capri was part of a five-horse O'Brien entry for the 2017 Epsom Derby on 3 June. Starting at odds of 16/1 he turned into the straight in eighth place and stayed on in the last quarter mile to finish sixth behind Wings of Eagles, Cliffs of Moher, Cracksman, Eminent and Benbatl beaten less than four lengths by the winner. On 1 July at the Curragh Capri, ridden by Heffernan, started at odds of 6/1 in a nine-runner field for the Iriah Derby. Wings of Eagles started favourite, while the other runners included Cracksman, Waldgeist and Douglas Macarthur. He raced in second place behind the pacemaker The Anvil before going to the front two furlongs out. He was strongly pressed in the closing stages but stayed on well under pressure to prevail by a neck and a short head from Cracksman and Wings of Eagles. After the race O'Brien said \\"I was always a great believer in this horse. Even after Epsom, Seamus wanted to come here and ride him. We know that he gets a mile and a half and we know that he's brave\\". Heffernan commented \\"This horse has been competing in very good races all year and the Curragh suited him. I was always comfortable in my position and we went a good gallop. He galloped all the way to the line. He stays well and tries hard... It's great that he looks like he's improving\\". The BBC's racing correspondent described the colt's performance as \\"thoroughly gutsy\\". After a break of two and a half months, Capri returned in the 241st running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 16 September. The race was described as \\"one of the best and most competitive Legers for years\\". Ridden by Ryan Moore (jockey) he was made the 3/1 favourite against ten opponents including Stradivarius, Crystal Ocean, Defoe, Coronet (Ribblesdale Stakes), Venice Beach (Chester Vase), Rekindling, Raheen House (Bahrain Trophy) and Douglas Macarthur. The Anvil again acted as a pacemaker for the O'Brien team and opened up a long lead with Capri settled in fourth. Capri moved up on the outside to take the lead early in the straight from Stradivarius who raced on the inside rail. In a closely contested finish Capri ran on well and won by half a length and a short head from Crystal Ocean and Stradivarius. He became the first Irish Derby winner to take the race since Nijinsky in 1970. After the race Moore said \\"I think it was a very good Leger... he's not done a lot wrong in his life. It was hard work but that didn‚Äôt bother him. It was a hard race but he didn‚Äôt look like a horse who had killed himself afterwards. Any of the first three would have been very worthy winners... he fought them off when he had to. He was very brave when the second came to me ‚Äì he has plenty of heart\\". On his final run of the year he contested the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Chantilly Racecourse but was never in contention and finished unplaced behind Enable. 2018: four-year-old season Capri began his third campaign in the Group 3 Alleged Stakes over ten furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 13 April and started the 7/4 favourite against four opponents headed by his stablemate Cliffs of Moher. Ridden by Ryan Moore he took the lead soon after the start and held on in the closing stages to win by a head from Cannonball. After an absence of five months the colt returned in the Prix Foy over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and finished fifth of the six runners behind Waldgeist. On 7 October Capri started a 25/1 outsider in his second attempt to win the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, and made a much stronger bid than he had done in 2017. After racing in second place he went to the front in the straight but was outpaced in the last 300 metres and finished fifth behind Enable, Sea of Class, Cloth of Stars and Waldgeist, beaten just over three lengths by the winner. Two weeks later the colt was dropped back in distance for the ten furlong Champion Stakes on soft ground at Ascot Racecourse and was strongly supported in the betting, going off the 4/1 third choice in an eight-runner field. After racing in second place he moved up to dispute the lead in the straight but was again outpaced in the closing stages and came home fourth behind Cracksman, Crystal Ocean and the Czech-trained outsider Subway Dancer. 2019: five-year-old season On his first run as a five-year-old Capri started 5/4 favourite for Group 3 Vintage Crop Stakes over fourteen furlongs at Navan Racecourse on 28 April but finished a well-beaten fifth of the nine runners behind the four-year-old gelding Master of Reality. He disappointed again at Leopardstown in the following month, coming home third to Twilight Payment when odds-on favourite for the Listed Levmoss Stakes. On 20 June at Royal Ascot the horse started a 16/1 outsider for the Gold Cup in which he was ridden by Donnacha O'Brien. He looked to be in contention early in the straight but faded in the closing stages to finish sixth, eight lengths behind the winner Stradivarius. After a break of over two months he returned in the Irish St Leger Trial Stakes at the Curragh and finished fourth behind his stablemate Southern France. In the Irish St Leger on 15 September he made no impression and came home last of the ten runners. Capri ended his track career in the British Champions Long Distance Cup on 19 October when he raced prominently before fading in the closing stages and finishing sixth behind Kew Gardens. Stud career In October 2019 it was announced that Capri had been retired from racing to become a National Hunt breeding stallion at Grange Stud in County Cork.

It is regarded as the worst natural disaster in recorded history to affect those islands and was also the deadliest Atlantic hurricane since Jeanne in 2004. The tenth-most-intense Atlantic hurricane on record and the most intense tropical cyclone worldwide in 2017, Maria was the thirteenth named storm, eighth consecutive hurricane, fourth major hurricane, second Category 5 hurricane, and deadliest storm of the hyperactive 2017 Atlantic hurricane season. At its peak, the hurricane caused catastrophic destruction and numerous fatalities across the northeastern Caribbean, compounding recovery efforts in the areas of the Leeward Islands already struck by Hurricane Irma. Total losses from the hurricane are estimated at upwards of $91.61 billion (2017 USD), mostly in Puerto Rico, ranking it as the third-costliest tropical cyclone on record. Originating from a tropical wave, Maria became a tropical storm on September 16, east of the Lesser Antilles. Highly favorable environmental conditions allowed the storm to undergo explosive intensification as it approached the island arc. The hurricane reached Category 5 strength on September 18 just before making landfall on Dominica, becoming the first Category 5 hurricane on record to strike the island. After weakening slightly due to crossing Dominica, Maria achieved its peak intensity over the eastern Caribbean with maximum sustained winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) and a pressure of 908 mbar (hPa; 26.81 inHg). On September 20, an eyewall replacement cycle took place, weakening Maria to a high-end Category 4 hurricane by the time it struck Puerto Rico. Interaction with land further weakened the hurricane, though it regained some strength as it moved northeast of the Bahamas. Moving slowly to the north, Maria gradually degraded and weakened to a tropical storm on September 28. Embedded in the westerlies, Maria accelerated toward the east and later east-northeast over the open Atlantic, becoming extratropical on September 30 and dissipating by October 2. Maria wrought catastrophic devastation to the entirety of Dominica, which suffered an island-wide communication blackout. Much of the housing stock and infrastructure were left beyond repair, while the island's lush vegetation was practically eradicated. The islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique endured widespread flooding, damaged roofs, and uprooted trees. Puerto Rico also suffered catastrophic damage and a major humanitarian crisis; most of the island's population suffered from flooding and a lack of resources, compounded by the slow relief process. The storm caused the worst electrical blackout in US history, and in June 2018, thousands of homes and businesses were still without power. Maria was the third consecutive major hurricane to threaten the Leeward Islands in two weeks, after Irma had made landfall in several of the islands two weeks prior and Hurricane Jose passed dangerously close shortly afterward, bringing tropical storm force winds to Barbuda. On August 28, 2018 (almost a year after the hurricane), Puerto Rico revised its official tally of 64 killed in the hurricane up to 2,975, making the total death toll 3,059: an estimated 2,975 were killed in Puerto Rico, 65 in Dominica, 5 in the Dominican Republic, 4 in Guadeloupe, 4 in the contiguous United States, 3 in the United States Virgin Islands, and 3 in Haiti. Maria is the deadliest hurricane in Dominica since the 1834 Padre Ru√≠z hurricane and the deadliest in Puerto Rico since the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane. The death toll in Puerto Rico was initially reported as 64 by Puerto Rican authorities but revised after several studies estimated between 1,400 and 5,740 deaths were attributable to the storm. The official estimate of 2,975 is based on a study commissioned by the governor of Puerto Rico, where researchers at George Washington University developed statistical models of excess mortality attributable to Maria, including both direct and indirect fatalities. Researchers attribute the discrepancy with the initial death count to \\"lack of awareness of appropriate death certification practices after a natural disaster\\" among physicians reporting deaths to vital statistic agencies. Meteorological history Maria originated from a tropical wave that left the western coast of Africa on September 12. Gradual organization occurred as it progressed westward across the tropical Atlantic under the influence of a mid-level ridge that was located to the system's north, and by 12:00 UTC on September 16, it had developed into Tropical Depression Fifteen, as deep convection consolidated and developed into curved bands wrapping into an increasingly-defined center of circulation. At that time, it was located about east of Barbados. Favorable conditions along the system's path consisting of warm sea surface temperatures of , low wind shear, and abundant moisture aloft allowed the disturbance to consolidate and become Tropical Storm Maria 6 hours later, after satellite images had indicated that the low- level circulation of the wave had become well-defined. Maria gradually strengthened, and by late on September 17, although the center had temporarily become exposed, a convective burst over the center enabled it to become a hurricane. Shortly afterward, explosive intensification occurred, with Maria nearly doubling its winds from 85 mph (140 km/h)‚Äîa Category 1 hurricane, to 165 mph (270 km/h)‚Äîa Category 5 hurricane, in just 24 hours, by which time it was located just 15 mi (25 km) east-southeast of Dominica late on September 18; the rate of intensification that occurred has been exceeded only a few times in the Atlantic since records began. Maria made landfall in Dominica at 01:15 UTC on September 19, becoming the first Category 5 hurricane on record to strike the island nation. Maria making landfall as a Category 5 hurricane on Dominica on September 19 Entering the Caribbean Sea, Maria weakened slightly to a Category 4 hurricane due to land interaction with the island of Dominica, however it quickly restrengthened to a Category 5 hurricane and attained its peak intensity with winds of 175 mph (280 km/h) and a pressure of 908 mbar (hPa; 26.81 inHg) at 03:00 UTC on September 20 while southeast of Puerto Rico; this ranks it as the tenth-most intense Atlantic hurricane since reliable records began. An eyewall replacement cycle caused Maria weaken to Category 4 strength before it made landfall near Yabucoa, Puerto Rico at 10:15 UTC (6:15am local time) that day with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h)‚Äîthe most intense to strike on the island since the 1928 San Felipe Segundo hurricane. Maria weakened significantly while traversing Puerto Rico, but was able to restrengthen to a major hurricane once it emerged over the Atlantic later that afternoon, eventually attaining a secondary peak intensity with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) on September 22, while north of Hispaniola. Maria then began fluctuating in intensity for the next few days as the eye periodically appeared and disappeared, while slowly nearing the East Coast of the United States, although southwesterly wind shear gradually weakened the hurricane. By September 25, it passed over cooler sea surface temperatures that had been left behind by Hurricane Jose a week prior, causing its inner core to collapse and the structure of the storm to change significantly. On September 28, a trough that was beginning to emerge off the Northeastern United States swung Maria eastward out to sea, while also weakening to a tropical storm. Periodic bursts of convection near the center managed to maintain Maria's intensity as it accelerated east-northeast across the northern Atlantic Ocean, but interaction with an encroaching frontal zone ultimately resulted in the storm becoming an extratropical cyclone on September 30, which continued east- northeastward, before dissipating on October 2. Preparations The U.S. Navy helps evacuate military personnel from the U.S. Virgin Islands, ahead of Hurricane Maria. Upon the initiation of the National Hurricane Center (NHC)'s first advisories for the system that would become Tropical Storm Maria on the morning of September 16, the government of France issued tropical storm watches for the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe, while St. Lucia issued a tropical storm watch for its citizens, and the government of Barbados issued a similar watch for Dominica. Barbados would later that day declare a tropical storm watch for its citizens and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. The government of Antigua and Barbuda issued Hurricane watches for the islands of Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Montserrat by the time of the NHC's second advisory which declared Maria a tropical storm. The Dominican Republic activated the International Charter on Space and Major Disasters for humanitarian satellite coverage on the 20th. Puerto Rico Prior to both Hurricanes Irma and Maria, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA), already struggling with increasing debt, had seen budget cuts imposed by PROMESA as well as the loss of 30 percent of its work force since 2012. With the median age of PREPA power plants at 44 years, an aging infrastructure across the island made the electric grid more susceptible to damage from storms. Inadequate safety mechanisms also plagued Puerto Rico's electric company, and local newspapers frequently reported on its poor maintenance and outdated control systems. According to the non-profit environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, the island's water system was already in substandard conditions prior to hurricanes Irma and Maria. The NRDC reported that seventy percent of the island had water that did not meet the standards of the 1974 Safe Drinking Water Act. Still recovering from Hurricane Irma two weeks prior, approximately 80,000 remained without power as Maria approached. FEMA's Caribbean Distribution Center warehouse, its only emergency stockpile in the islands, is located on Puerto Rico. By September 15, 2017, 83% of the items there, including 90% of the water and all of the tarps and cots, had been deployed for post-Irma relief, mostly to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Maria arrived before supplies were replenished. Evacuation orders were issued in Puerto Rico in advance of Maria, and officials announced that 450 shelters would open in the afternoon of September 18. By September 19, 2017, at least 2,000 people in Puerto Rico had sought shelter. Using anonymous aggregate cell phone tracking data provided by Google from users that opted to share location data, researchers reported that travel from Puerto Rico increased 20% the day before the hurricane made landfall. Puerto Rican travelers often chose to go to Orlando, Miami, New York City, and Atlanta. Internally, there was an influx of people into San Juan. Mainland United States As Maria approached the coast of North Carolina and threatened to bring tropical storm conditions, a storm surge warning was issued for the coast between Ocracoke Inlet and Cape Hatteras, while a storm surge watch was issued for the Pamlico Sound, the lower Neuse River, and the Alligator River on the morning of September 26. A state of emergency was declared by officials in Dare and Hyde counties, while visitors were ordered to evacuate Hatteras and Ocracoke islands. Ferry service between Ocracoke and Cedar Island was suspended the evening of September 25, and remained suspended on September 26 and 27, due to rough seas, while ferry service between Ocracoke and Hatteras Island was suspended on September 26 and 27. The port in Morehead City was closed by the United States Coast Guard on the morning of September 26. Schools in Dare County closed on September 26 and 27, while schools in Carteret and Tyrrell counties, along with Ocracoke Island, dismissed early on September 26, in anticipation of high winds. Schools in Currituck County were closed on September 27, due to high winds.

The Hewanorra and George F. L. Charles airports of Saint Lucia respectively recorded 4.33 in (110 mm) and 3.1 in (80 mm) of rain, though even higher quantities fell elsewhere on the island. Scattered rock slides, landslides and uprooted trees caused minor damage and blocked some roads. Several districts experienced localized blackouts due to downed or damaged power lines. The agricultural sector, especially the banana industry, suffered losses from the winds. Heavy rainfall amounting to 3‚Äì5 in (75‚Äì125 mm) caused scattered flooding across Barbados; in Christ Church, the flood waters trapped residents from the neighborhood of Goodland in their homes and inundated the business streets of Saint Lawrence Gap. Maria stirred up rough seas that flooded coastal sidewalks in Bridgetown and damaged boats as operators had difficulties securing their vessels. High winds triggered an island-wide power outage and downed a coconut tree onto a residence in Saint Joseph. Passing 30 mi (50 km) off the northern shorelines, Maria brought torrential rainfall and strong gusts to Martinique but spared the island of its hurricane-force windfield, which at the time extended 25 mi (35 km) around the eye. The commune of Le Marigot recorded 6.7 inches (170 mm) of rain over a 24-hour period. By September 19, Maria had knocked out power to 70,000 households, about 40% of the population. Water service was cut to 50,000 customers, especially in the communes of Le Morne-Rouge and Gros-Morne. Numerous roads and streets, especially along the northern coast, were impassible due to rock slides, fallen trees and toppled power poles. Streets in Fort-de-France were inundated. In the seaside commune of Le Carbet, rough seas washed ashore large rocks and demolished some coastal structures, while some boats were blown over along the bay of the commune of Sch≈ìlcher. Martinique's agricultural sector suffered considerable losses: about 70% of banana crops sustained wind damage, with nearly every tree downed along the northern coast. There were no deaths on the island, although four people were injured in the hurricane‚Äîtwo seriously and two lightly. Agricultural loss were estimated at ‚Ç¨35 million (US$42 million). Dominica Rainfall ahead of the hurricane caused several landslides in Dominica, as water levels across the island began to rise by the afternoon of September 18. Maria made landfall at 21:15 AST that day (1:15 UTC, September 19) as a Category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 km/h). These winds, the most extreme to ever impact the island, damaged the roof of practically every home‚Äîincluding the official residence of Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, who required rescue when his home began to flood. Downing all cellular, radio and internet services, Maria effectively cut Dominica off from the outside world; the situation there remained unclear for a couple of days after the hurricane's passage. Skerrit called the devastation \\"mind boggling\\" before going offline, and indicated immediate priority was to rescue survivors rather than assess damage. Initial ham radio reports from the capital of Roseau on September 19 indicated \\"total devastation,\\" with half the city flooded, cars stranded, and stretches of residential area \\"flattened\\". An aerial view of part of Roseau, revealing widespread damage to roofs. Flash floods clogged roads with debris‚Äîvegetative and structural‚Äîand mud. The next morning, the first aerial footage of Dominica elucidated the scope of the destruction. Maria left the mountainous country blanketed in a field of debris: Rows of houses along the entirety of the coastline were rendered uninhabitable, as widespread floods and landslides littered neighborhoods with the structural remnants. The hurricane also inflicted extensive damage to roads and public buildings, such as schools, stores and churches, and affected all of Dominica's 73,000 residents in some form or way. The air control towers and terminal buildings of the Canefield and Douglas Charles airports were severely damaged, although the runways remained relatively intact and open to emergency landings. The disaster affected all of the island's 53 health facilities, including the badly damaged primary hospital, compromising the safety of many patients. A road in the Roseau area is littered with structural debris, damaged vegetation and downed power poles and lines. The infrastructure of Roseau was left in ruins; practically every power pole and line was downed, and the main road was reduced to fragments of flooded asphalt. The winds stripped the public library of its roof panels and demolished all but one wall of the Baptist church. To the south of Roseau, riverside flooding and numerous landslides impacted the town of Pointe Michel, destroying about 80% of its structures and causing most of the deaths in the country. Outside the capital area, the worst of the destruction was concentrated around the east coast and rural areas, where collapsed roads and bridges isolated many villages. The port and fishing town of Marigot, Saint Andrew Parish, was 80% damaged. Settlements in Saint David Parish, such as Castle Bruce, Good Hope and Grand Fond, had been practically eradicated; many homes hung off cliffs or decoupled from their foundations. In Rosalie, rushing waters gushed over the village's bridge and damaged facilities in its bay area. Throughout Saint Patrick Parish, the extreme winds ripped through roofs and scorched the vegetation. Buildings in Grand Bay, the parish's main settlement, experienced total roof failure or were otherwise structurally compromised. Many houses in La Plaine caved in or slid into rivers, and its single bridge was broken. Overall, the hurricane damaged the roofs of as much as 98% of the island's buildings, including those serving as shelters; half of the houses had their frames destroyed. Its ferocious winds defoliated nearly all vegetation, splintering or uprooting thousands of trees and decimating the island's lush rainforests. The agricultural sector, a vital source of income for the country, was completely wiped out: 100% of banana and tuber plantations was lost, as well as vast amounts of livestock and farm equipment. In Maria's wake, Dominica's population suffered from an island-wide water shortage due to uprooted pipes. The Assessment Capacities Project estimates that the hurricane has caused EC$3.69 billion (US$1.37 billion) in losses across the island, which is equal to 226 percent of its 2016 GDP. As of April 12, 2019, there are 65 fatalities confirmed across the island, including 34 who are missing and presumed to be dead. Guadeloupe Numerous trees fell across Guadeloupe, clogging roadways with debris. Blustery conditions spread over Guadeloupe as Maria tracked to the south of the archipelago, which endured hours of unabating hurricane-force winds. The strongest winds blew along the southern coastlines of Basse-Terre Island: Gourbeyre observed a peak wind speed of 101 mph (162 km/h), while winds up north in nearby Baillif reached 92 mph (148 km/h). Along those regions, the hurricane kicked up extremely rough seas with 20 ft (6 m) waves. The combination of rough seas and winds was responsible for widespread structural damage and flooding throughout the archipelago, especially from Pointe-√†-Pitre, along Grand-Terre Island's southwestern coast, to Petit-Bourg and the southern coasts on Basse-Terre Island. Aside from wind-related effects, rainfall from Maria was also significant. In just a day, the hurricane dropped nearly a month's worth of rainfall at some important locations: Pointe-√†-Pitre recorded a 24-hour total of 7.5 inches (191 mm), while the capital of Basse-Terre measured 6.4 in (163 mm). Even greater quantities fell at higher elevations of Basse Terre Island, with a maximum total of 18.07 in (459 mm) measured at the mountainous locality of Matouba, Saint-Claude. Throughout the archipelago, the hurricane left 40% of the population (80,000 households) without power and 25% of landline users without service. The islands of Marie-Galante, La D√©sirade and especially Les Saintes bore the brunt of the winds, which caused heavy damage to structures and nature alike and cut the islands off from their surroundings for several days. Homes on Terre-de-Haut Island of Les Saintes were flooded or lost their roofs. On the mainland, sections of Pointe-√†-Pitre stood under more than 3.3 feet (1 m) of water, and the city's hospital sustained significant damage. The Basse- Terre region suffered severe damage to nearly 100% of its banana crops, comprising a total area of more than 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares); farmers described the destruction to their plantations as \\"complete annihilation\\". Beyond their impact on farmland, the strong winds ravaged much of the island's vegetation: fallen trees and branches covered practically every major road and were responsible for one death. Another person was killed upon being swept out to sea. Two people disappeared at sea after their vessel capsized offshore La D√©sirade, east of mainland Grande-Terre, and they are presumed to be dead afterwards. Damage from Maria across Guadeloupe amounted to at least ‚Ç¨100 million (US$120 million). United States Virgin Islands Two weeks after Hurricane Irma hit St. Thomas and St. John as a Category 5 hurricane, Hurricane Maria's weaker outer eyewall was reported by the National Hurricane Center to have crossed Saint Croix while the hurricane was at Category 5 intensity. Sustained winds at the Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge on St. Croix reached and gusted to . Damage was most extensive in the town of Frederiksted, on the west end of St. Croix, as well as along the southern shoreline, leaving 3 dead. Weather stations on St. Croix recorded 10and 20 inches of rain from the hurricane, and estimates for St. John and St. Thomas were somewhat less. The hurricane killed two people, both in their homes: one person drowned and another was trapped by a mudslide. A third person had a fatal heart attack during the hurricane. The hurricane caused severe damage to St. Croix. It took almost a year for peer to be restored to most residents. President Donald Trump declared a major disaster in the U.S. Virgin Islands one day after Maria hit. The move freed up federal funding for people on the island of St. Croix. After both hurricanes, the office of V.I. congresswoman Stacey Plaskett stated that 90% of buildings in the Virgin Islands were damaged or destroyed and 13,000 of those buildings had lost their roofs. The Luis Hospital suffered roof damage and flooding, but remained operational. Impact in the Greater Antilles and the United States Puerto Rico High amounts of rain fell on the island of Puerto Rico in less than 48 hours. The map shows estimated totals and exact totals where available. The storm made landfall on Puerto Rico on Wednesday, September 20, near the Yabucoa municipality at 10:15 UTC (6:15 a.m. local time) as a high-end Category 4 hurricane with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h). A sustained wind of with a gust to was reported in San Juan, immediately prior to the hurricane making landfall on the island. After landfall, wind gusts of were reported at Yabucoa Harbor and at Camp Santiago. In addition, heavy rainfall occurred throughout the territory, peaking at 37.9 inches (962.7 mm) in Caguas. The eyewall replacement cycle that caused Mar√≠a to weaken to Category 4 strength also caused the eye to triple in size as the diameter expanded prior to landfall. This change in size caused the area exposed to high-intensity winds on the island to be far greater. Widespread flooding affected San Juan, waist-deep in some areas, and numerous structures lost their roof. The coastal La Perla neighborhood of San Juan was largely destroyed. Cata√±o saw extensive damage, with the Juana Matos neighborhood estimated to be 80-percent destroyed. The primary airport in San Juan, the Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport, was slated to reopen on September 22. Storm surge and flash flooding‚Äîstemming from flood gate releases at La Plata Lake Dam‚Äîconverged on the town of Toa Baja, trapping thousands of residents. Survivors indicate that flood waters rose at least in 30 minutes, with flood waters reaching a depth of in some areas. More than 2,000 people were rescued once military relief reached the town 24 hours after the storm. At least eight people died from the flooding, while many were unaccounted for. Thousands of homes suffered varying degrees of damage while large swaths of vegetation were shredded by the hurricane's violent winds. On September 24, Puerto Rico's Governor Ricardo Rossell√≥ estimated that the damage from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico was probably over the $8 billion damage figure from Hurricane Georges. Approximately 80 percent of the territory's agriculture was lost due to the hurricane, with agricultural losses estimated at $780 million. The hurricane completely destroyed the island's power grid, leaving all 3.4 million residents without electricity. Governor Rossell√≥ stated that it could take months to restore power in some locations, with San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz estimating that some areas would remain without power for four to six months. Communication networks were crippled across the island. Ninety-five percent of cell networks were down, with 48 of the island's 78 counties networks being completely inoperable. Eighty-five percent of above-ground phone and internet cables were knocked out. Only twelve radio stations, namely WAPA 680 AM, WPAB 550 AM & WISO 1260 AM of Ponce, WKJB 710 AM, WPRA 990 AM & WTIL 1300 AM of Mayaguez, WMIA 1070 AM of Arecibo, WVOZ 1580 AM of Morovis, WXRF 1590 AM of Guayama, WALO 1240 AM of Humacao and WOIZ 1130 AM of Guayanilla, remained on the air during the storm. Map of landslides in Puerto Rico - Hurricane Maria 2017 Hurricane Maria caused landslides across the island and in some municipalities there were more than 25 landslides per square mile. NWS NEXRAD radar in Puerto Rico destroyed by Maria The NEXRAD Doppler weather radar of Puerto Rico was blown away. The radome which covers the radar antenna, and which was designed to withstand winds of more than 130 mph, was destroyed while the antenna of 30 feet in diameter was blown from the pedestal, the latter remaining intact. The radar is above sea level, and the anemometer at the site measured winds of about before communications broke, which means winds at that height were likely 20 percent higher than what was seen at sea level. The radar was rebuilt and finally brought back online 9 months later. The nearby island of Vieques suffered similarly extensive damage. Communications were largely lost across the island. Widespread property destruction took place with many structures leveled. Hurricane Maria at Coast Guard Sector San Juan The former survey ship Ferrel, carrying a family of four, issued a distress signal while battling and on September 20. Communications with the vessel were lost near Vieques on September 20. The United States Coast Guard, United States Navy, and British Royal Navy conducted search-and-rescue operations utilizing an HC-130 aircraft, a fast response cutter, , and Navy helicopters. On September 21, the mother and her two children were rescued while the father drowned inside the capsized vessel. Maria's Category 4 winds broke a line feed antenna of the Arecibo Observatory, causing it to fall and puncturing the dish below, greatly reducing its ability to function until repairs could be made. Hurricane Maria greatly affected Puerto Rico's agriculture. Coffee was the worst affected crop, with 18 million coffee trees destroyed, which will require about five to ten years to bring back at least 15% of the coffee production of the island. Hispaniola Infrared satellite loop of Maria passing east of the Dominican Republic on September 21, after leaving Puerto Rico. Torrential rains and strong winds impacted the Dominican Republic as Maria tracked northeast of the country. Assessments on September 22 indicated that 110 homes were destroyed, 570 were damaged, and 3,723 were affected by flooding. Approximately 60,000 people lost power in northern areas of the country. Flooding and landslides rendered many roads impassable, cutting off 38 communities. Five people, all of them males, were killed in the Dominican Republic: four of them were of Haitian origin, killed when they were swept away by floodwaters; the fifth person was a Dominican man who died in a landslide. Infrastructural damage amounted to RD$3 billion (US$63 million). Hurricane Maria's center passed from Haiti's northern coast, but triggered a large amount of rain and some flooding in Haiti. Three deaths were reported: a 45-year-old man died in the commune of Limbe, in the department of the North, while attempting to cross a flooded river. Two other people, a woman and a man, died in Cornillon, a small town east of the capital Port-au-Prince, according to the authorities.. Mainland United States Maria brushed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on September 26, as the center of the storm passed by offshore and brought tropical storm conditions to the area, along with a storm surge, large waves, and rip currents to the coast. The storm knocked out power to 800 Duke Energy Progress customers in the Havelock area, with restoration of power expected to take several hours. Dominion North Carolina Power and Cape Hatteras Electric Cooperative experienced scattered power outages. Winds of and gusts of were reported at Dare County Regional Airport at Manteo on September 27, while winds of were reported in Duck, North Carolina. Maria caused beach erosion at the ferry terminal at the north end of Ocracoke Island that washed out a portion of the paved lanes where vehicles wait to board the ferry. By the morning of September 26, the storm flooded North Carolina Highway 12 along the coast. Rip currents from Maria caused three swimmers to drown and several others to be rescued at the Jersey Shore on the weekend of September 23‚Äì24. A fourth drowning death occurred in Fernandina Beach, Florida. Aftermath Dominica SH-60 Seahawk flies over Dominica en route to deliver humanitarian aid. The mountainous terrain of the island poses serious challenges to relief operations in more remote areas. In the wake of the hurricane, more than 85% of the island's houses were damaged, of which more than 25% were completely destroyed, leaving more than 50,000 of the island's 73,000 residents to be displaced. Following the destruction of thousands of homes, most supermarkets and the water supply system, many of Dominica's residents were in dire need of food, water and shelter for days. With no access to electricity or running water, and with sewage systems destroyed, fears of widespread diarrhea and dysentery arose. The island's agriculture, a vital source of income for many, was obliterated as most trees were flattened. Meanwhile, the driving force of the economy‚Äîtourism‚Äîwas expected to be scarce in the months that followed Maria. Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit characterized the devastation wrought by Irma and Maria as a sign of climate change and the threat it poses to the survival of his country, stating, \\"To deny climate change ... is to deny a truth we have just lived.\\" Many islanders suffered respiratory problems as a result of excessive dust borne out of the debris. Light rainfall in the weeks following Maria alleviated this problem, although it also slowed recovery efforts, particularly rebuilding damaged rooftops. Through the Caribbean Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility, Dominica received approximately US$19.2 million in emergency funds. , previously deployed to Saint Martin to assist in relief efforts after Hurricane Irma, arrived in Dominica on September 22. The vessel carried two Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk helicopters to assist in distribution of relief supplies in hard-to-reach areas. At the United Nations General Assembly on September 23, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit called the situation in Dominica an \\"international humanitarian emergency\\". The Royal Canadian Navy vessel was dispatched to Dominica\\"Canadian sailors find 'near total devastation' on hurricane-ravaged island \\". CTV News. September 26, 2017. Retrieved September 26, 2017. at the request of Dominican Prime Minister Skerrit. The prime minister urged churches to encourage their membership to provide housing for senior citizens and disabled, many of whom remained in damaged structures despite tarpaulin donations from Venezuela, Palestine, Cuba, Jamaica, and other countries. As schools began to reopen on October 16, the United Nations Children's Fund reported that the entire child population of Dominica‚Äî23,000 children‚Äîremained vulnerable due to restricted access to clean drinking water. Efforts to rebuild homes and buildings across the island were steady, albeit slowed due to lack of funds. Almost two years after Maria, shelters remained operational as many homes still lacked significant roofing. Puerto Rico \\"US Officials Say Damaged Infrastructure Slows Aid Distribution in Puerto Rico\\" video from Voice of America Broken windows in Aguas Buenas The power grid was effectively destroyed by the hurricane, leaving millions without electricity. Governor Ricardo Rossell√≥ estimated that Maria caused at least US$ 90 billion in damage and in 2018 the US National Hurricane Center updated its list of costliest hurricanes to include that figure. On September 26, 2017, 95% of the island was without power, less than half the population had tap water, and 95% of the island had no cell phone service. On October 6, a little more than two weeks after the hurricane, 89% still had no power, 44% had no water service, and 58% had no cell service. Two weeks after the hurricane, international relief organization Oxfam chose to intervene for the first time on American soil since Hurricane Katrina in 2005. One month after the hurricane, 88% of the island was without power (about 3 million people), 29% lacked tap water (about 1 million people), and 40% of the island had no cell service. A month after the hurricane, most hospitals were open, but most were on backup generators that provide limited power. Angelique Sina's non-profit organization, Friends of Puerto Rico, had supplied generators for hospitals in two cities, by November, 2017. About half of sewage treatment plants on the island were still not functioning. FEMA reported 60,000 homes needed roofing help, and had distributed 38,000 roofing tarps. (slideshow) The island's highways and bridges remained heavily damaged nearly a month later. Only 392 miles of Puerto Rico's 5,073 miles of road were open. Some towns continued to be isolated and delivery of relief supplies including food and water were hampered‚Äîhelicopters were the only alternative. By October 1, 2017, there were ongoing fuel shortage and distribution problems, with 720 of 1,100 gas stations open. The Guajataca Dam was structurally damaged, and on September 22, the National Weather Service issued a flash flood emergency for parts of the area in response. Tens of thousands of people were ordered to evacuate the area, with about 70,000 thought to be at risk. The entirety of Puerto Rico was declared a Federal Disaster Zone shortly after the hurricane. The Federal Emergency Management Agency planned to open an air bridge with three to four aircraft carrying essential supplies to the island daily starting on September 22. Beyond flights involving the relief effort, limited commercial traffic resumed at Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport on September 22 under primitive conditions. A dozen commercial flights operated daily, as of September 26, 2017. By October 3, there were 39 commercial flights per day from all Puerto Rican airports, about a quarter of the normal number. The next day, airports were reported to be operating at normal capacity. The territory's government contracted 56 small companies to assist in restoring power. Eight FEMA Urban Search & Rescue (US&R;) teams were deployed to assist in rescue efforts. Debris-clogged roads added to logistical challenges faced by rescue and relief crews. On September 24, the amphibious assault ship and the dock landing ship under Rear Admiral Jeffrey W. Hughes along with the 2,400 marines of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit arrived to assist in relief efforts.Washington Post: \\"Puerto Rico governor: 'We still need some more help' from Washington\\" by Ed O'Keefe September 24, 2017Stars & Stripes: \\"Military conducting multiple operations to help Hurricane Maria-struck Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands\\" By Corey Dickstein September 25, 2017CNN: \\"US Navy ship's response efforts in Puerto Rico\\" retrieved September 28, 2017CBS News: \\"U.S. military beefs up its efforts in Puerto Rico as need for vital supplies grows\\" September 28, 2017 By September 24, there were thirteen United States Coast Guard ships deployed around Puerto Rico assisting in the relief and restoration efforts: the National Security Cutter ; the medium endurance cutters , , , and ; the fast response cutters , , , , and ; the coastal patrol boat USCGC Yellowfin; and the seagoing buoy tenders and .Coast Guard News: \\"Coast Guard continues hurricane response in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands\\" September 25, 2017 Federal aid arrived on September 25 with the reopening of major ports.

The Air Force assisted the Federal Aviation Administration with air traffic control repairs to increase throughput capacity. The logistics support ship SS Wright (T-AVB-3) was mobilized on September 22 to support relief operations delivering 1.3 million MREs and one million liters of fresh water. The United States Transportation Command moved additional personnel and eight U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from Fort Campbell, Kentucky to Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport to increase distribution capacity. The United States Army Corps of Engineers deployed 670 personnel engaged in assessing and restoring the power grid; by September 25, 83 generators were installed and an additional 186 generators were en route. By September 26, 2017, agencies of the U.S. government had delivered four million meals, six million liters of water, 70,000 tarps and 15,000 rolls of roof sheeting.Military Times: \\"Hospital ship Comfort heading to Puerto Rico\\" by Tara Copp September 26, 2017 National Guard troops were activated and deployed to Puerto Rico from Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, New York, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.   Members of the South Carolina National Guard assisting with clean up efforts in Caguas On September 29, the hospital ship left port at Norfolk, Virginia to help victims of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, and arrived in San Juan on October 3. A couple of days later, Comfort departed on an around the island tour to assist, remaining a dozen miles off shore. Patients were brought to the ship by helicopter or boat tender after being referred by Puerto Rico's Department of Health. However, most of the 250 bed floating state-of-the-art hospital went unused despite overburdened island clinics and hospitals because there were few referrals. Governor Rossell√≥ explained on or about October 17 that \\"The disconnect or the apparent disconnect was in the communications flow\\" and added \\"I asked for a complete revision of that so that we can now start sending more patients over there.\\" After remaining offshore for three weeks, the Comfort docked in San Juan on October 27, briefly departing only once to restock at sea from a naval resupply ship. By November 8, 2017, Comforts staff had treated 1,476 patients, including 147 surgeries and two births. On September 27, the Pentagon reopened two major airfields on Puerto Rico and started sending aircraft, specialized units, and a hospital ship to assist in the relief effort; Brigadier General Richard C. Kim, the deputy commanding general of United States Army North, was responsible for coordinating operations between the military, FEMA and other government agencies, and the private sector. Massive amounts of water, food, and fuel either had been delivered to ports in Puerto Rico or were held up at ports in the mainland United States because there was a lack of truck drivers to move the goods into the interior; the lack of communication networks hindered the effort as only 20% of drivers reported to work.CNN: \\"Vital aid stranded at Puerto Rico's main port\\" By Patrick Gillespie, Rafael Romo and Maria Santana September 27, 2017 By September 28, the Port of San Juan had only been able to dispatch 4% of deliveries received and had very little room to accept additional shipments.CNN: \\"Puerto Rico's aid is trapped in thousands of shipping containers\\" by Patrick Gillespie, Rafael Romo and Maria Santana September 28, 2017 By September 28, 44 percent of the population remained without drinking water and the U.S. military was shifting from \\"a short term, sea-based response to a predominantly land-based effort designed to provide robust, longer term support\\" with fuel delivery a top priority.U.S. Army: \\"Army, DOD officials provide update on hurricane relief efforts\\" September 28, 2017 A joint Army National Guard and Marine expeditionary unit (MEU) team established an Installation Staging Base at the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station; they transported via helicopter Department of Health and Human Services assessment teams to hospitals across Puerto Rico to determine medical requirements.

On September 28, 2017, Lieutenant General Jeffrey S. Buchanan was dispatched to Puerto Rico to lead all military hurricane relief efforts there and to see how the military could be more effective in the recovery effort, particularly in dealing with the thousands of containers of supplies that were stuck in port because of \\"red tape, lack of drivers, and a crippling power outage\\". On September 29 he stated that there were not enough troops and equipment in place but more would be arriving soon. With centralized fossil-fuel-based power plants and grid infrastructure expected to be out of commission for weeks to months, some renewable energy projects were in the works, including the shipment of hundreds of Tesla Powerwall battery systems to be integrated with solar PV systems and Sonnen solar microgrid projects at 15 emergency community centers; the first were expected to be completed in October. In addition, other solar companies jumped into help, including Sunnova and New Start Solar. A charity called Light Up Puerto Rico raised money to both purchase and deliver solar products, including solar panels, on Oct. 19. The idea would be to supplement the existing electrical grid with power from solar and wind farms. A complete replacement of fossil fuel infrastructure is unlikely as solar and wind are too intermittent and are also vulnerable to another hurricane. Four of the five large solar farms on Puerto Rico were damaged and many of the wind turbines suffered damaged blades. Many TV and movie stars donated money to hurricane relief organizations to help the victims of Harvey and Maria. Prominently, Jennifer Aniston pledged a million U.S. dollars, dividing the amount equally between the Red Cross and the Ricky Martin Foundation for Puerto Rico. Martin's foundation had raised over three million dollars by October 13, 2017. On October 9, 2017, the United States Postal Service stated that 99 of its 128 offices were delivering packages and mail to residents, albeit some were working out of tents and their offices had no power for one week after the hurricane. Care packages were coming in to Puerto Rico from all over and USPS hired temporary workers and had workers delivering packages 7 days a week, to help with the brunt. On October 10, 2017, Carnival Cruise Lines announced that it would resume departures of cruises from San Juan on October 15, 2017.USA Today: \\"Carnival to resume sailings from San Juan, Puerto Rico on Sunday\\" by Gene Sloan October 10, 2017 On October 13, both CNN and The Guardian reported that Puerto Ricans were drinking water that was being pumped from a well at an EPA Superfund site; the water was later determined to be safe to drink. Mountain melted down by winds and heavy rain in Villalba. On October 13, the Trump administration requested $4.9 billion to fund a loan program that Puerto Rico could use to address basic functions and infrastructure needs.CNN: \\"San Juan mayor slams Trump over tweets: He's a 'hater-in-chief'\\" By Leinz Vales October 13, 2017 On October 20, only 18.5% of the island had electricity, 49.1% of cell towers were working, and 69.5% of customers had running water, with the slowest restoration in the north. Ports and commercial flights were back to normal operations, but 7.6% of USPS locations, 11.5% of supermarkets, and 21.4% of gas stations were still closed. 4,246 people were still living in emergency shelters, and tourism was down by half. On November 5, more than 100,000 people had left Puerto Rico for the mainland. A December 17 report indicated that 600 people remained in shelters while 130,000 had left the island to go to the mainland. Three months after the hurricane, 45% of Puerto Ricans still had no power, over 1.5 million people. 14% of Puerto Rico had no tap water; cell service was returning with over 90% of service restored and 86% of cell towers functioning. Elaine Duke, who was, at the time, the acting Secretary of Homeland Security, recalled years later that President Trump suggested \\"selling\\" Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the hurricane. \\"Can we outsource the electricity? Can we can we sell the island? You know, or divest of that asset?\\" she remembered him saying. She said the topic was never mentioned again beyond that comment. = Recovery between 2018 and 2019 = '18 Months After Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico Still Struggling' - video news report from Voice of America. Puerto Rico is a major manufacturer of medical devices and pharmaceuticals, which represent 30% of its economy.Securing the Future for Puerto Rico: Restoring the Island's robust Medical Product Manuring Sector, p. 4-5, EPA, 2017, https://www.fda.gov/downloads/NewsEvents/Newsroom/FDAInBrief/UCM584030.pdf These factories shut down or greatly reduced production because of the hurricane, and were slowly recovering since. This caused a months long shortage in medical supplies in the United States, especially of IV bags. Small IV bags often come pre-filled with saline or common drugs in solution, and have forced health care providers to scramble behind the scenes for alternative methods of drug delivery. In January 2018, when the shortage was projected to ease, flu season hit and led to a spike in patients. By the end of January 2018, approximately 450,000 customers remained without power island-wide. On February 11, an explosion and fire damaged a power substation in Monacillo, causing a large blackout in northern parts of the island including San Juan, Trujillo Alto, Guaynabo, Carolina, Caguas, and Juncos. Cascading outages affected areas powered by substations in Villa Betina and Quebrada Negrito. Approximately 400 megawatts of electricity production was lost. On March 1, 2018, a second major blackout occurred when a transmission line failed and caused two power stations to shut down; more than 970,000 people lost electricity. Excluding those affected by the second blackout, more than 200,000 people remained without power following Maria, on March 2, 2018. Another large-scale blackout occurred on April 12 from a line failure. Less than a week later on April 18, another blackout affected all of Puerto Rico. Rapid transit line passengers required help to disembark stalled trains. FEMA was a major supplier of relief in the form of bereavement, food, and other emergency supplies, as well as rebuilding some homes. FEMA's relief efforts in Puerto Rico post-Maria engaged a smaller work force and budget than the agency's efforts in Texas and Florida, in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, respectively. FEMA does not rebuild homes to which the owner has no title, which has presented a major obstacle for many Puerto Ricans, who may have erected structures on family plots without procuring legal paperwork beforehand. Compounding the problem in rebuilding the housing infrastructure is the fact that only about 50% of houses in Puerto Rico were covered by insurance policies that protect against wind damage, meaning that homeowners were reliant on their own money, FEMA, or other charities rather than insurance proceeds for rebuilding. Although banks require that people with mortgages have homeowner's insurance, Puerto Rico has a low mortgage penetration rate with only 500,000 active mortgages in a population of 3 million as many homes are fully owned by families and passed to the next generation. In addition, 10% of mortgage holders in Puerto Rico were delinquent at the time (compared to 5.8% on the mainland), an indication of the fragile state of the local economy. As a consequence of the hurricane, a population drop of approximately 14% was forecasted, due to an exodus to the mainland United States, according to a research study conducted by the Center for Puerto Rican Studies of Hunter College. In preparation for the 2018 hurricane season, FEMA drastically increased its stockpiles on the island, including 35 times more bottled water, 43 times more tarps, and 16 times more meals as the previous year. FEMA has added three new warehouses on Puerto Rico, and pre-positioned emergency power generators at hospitals and water pump stations. The territorial government added satellite and radio equipment at hospitals, to prevent a communications blackout in the event the land and cell phone networks fail again. In addition to FEMA, Direct Relief provided important medical supplies to those affected including insulin and vaccines. A year later, repairs to homes were not completed, schools were shuttered, and residents were suffering from depression. As of January 2019, the Department of Housing and Urban Development had allocated nearly $20 billion in grants to aid Puerto Rico's reconstruction. However, many people feel that this amount is insufficient, and worry it will not help the day-to-day lives of ordinary affected Puerto Ricans. About 60% of households that applied for FEMA assistance have been rejected, primarily for lack of proof of ownership. Different legal and inheritance customs in Puerto Rico often result in there being no title deed to a property. Further, there have been accusations that FEMA policies have been applied unfairly. January 2019 has also seen a $600 million cut in food aid to Puerto Rico by the Trump Administration.' = Estimating fatalities = The deaths of 64 people were initially directly attributed to the hurricane by the government of Puerto Rico. In the immediate months following Maria, the initial death toll relayed from the Government of Puerto Rico came into question by media outlets, politicians, and investigative journalists. Scores of people who survived the hurricane's initial onslaught later died from complications in its aftermath. Catastrophic damage to infrastructure and communication hampered efforts to accurately document the total loss of life. Investigations iton the hurricane's aftermath suggested a wide variety of possible death tolls. On October 11, 2017, Vox reported 81 deaths directly or indirectly related to the hurricane, with another 450 deaths awaiting investigation. Furthermore, they indicated 69 people were missing. Official statistics showed increases of about 20% and 27% in overall fatalities in Puerto Rico during September 2017, compared to 2016 and 2015, followed by a decrease of about 10% in October 2017 compared to the previous two Octobers.Calculation from provided monthly statistics. There were 238 more reported deaths in September and October 2017 than during the same months in 2016, and 336 more compared to September and October 2015. A two- week investigation in November 2017 by CNN of 112 funeral homes‚Äîapproximately half of the island‚Äîfound 499 deaths that were said to be hurricane-related between September 20 and October 19. Two scientists, Alexis Santos and Jeffrey Howard, estimated the death toll in Puerto Rico to be 1,085 by the end of November 2017\\\\. They utilized average monthly deaths and the spike in fatalities following the hurricane. The value only accounted for reported deaths, and with limitations to communication, the actual toll could have been even higher. Utilizing a similar method, The New York Times indicated an increase of 1,052 fatalities in the 42 days following Maria compared to previous years. Significant spikes in causes of deaths compared to the two preceding Septembers included sepsis (+47%), pneumonia (+45%), emphysema (+43%), diabetes (+31%), and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's (+23%). Robert Anderson at the National Center for Health Statistics conveyed the increase in monthly fatalities was statistically significant and likely driven in some capacity by Hurricane Maria. A Harvard study found an estimated 15 excess deaths in the four months after the hurricane in interviews with 3,299 households, resulting in an estimated 793 to 8,498 excess deaths (with a 95% confidence interval). On December 18, 2017, Governor Rossell√≥ ordered a recount and a new analysis of the official death toll. The task of reviewing the death toll was given to George Washington University, with some assistance from the University of Puerto Rico, in February 2018\\\\. In response to three lawsuits, including one from CNN and Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism, the Government of Puerto Rico released updated death statistics for the months following Hurricane Maria. Compared to the average deaths in September to December 2013 ‚Äì 2016, September to December 2017 had 1,427 excess deaths; however, it is unknown how many of these deaths are attributable to the hurricane. The government acknowledged the death toll was greater than 64, but awaited the results of the government commissioned study to determine the true death toll. In late August 2018, almost a year after the hurricane, the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University published their results. They estimated 2,658‚Äì3,290 additional people died in the six months after the hurricane over the expected background rate, after accounting for emigration from the island. As result, the official death toll was updated from the initial 64 to an estimated 2,975 by the Governor of Puerto Rico. In September 2018, President Trump disputed the revised death toll. Writing on Twitter, Trump claimed that \\"3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico\\", but that the Democrats had inflated the official death toll to \\"make me look as bad as possible\\". Trump provided no evidence to support his claims. The response was met with immediate criticism, including from Mayor of San Juan Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz and Florida Congresswoman and fellow Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. U.S. Virgin Islands By September 25, 2017, the U.S. Coast Guard reported that the ports of Crown Bay, East Gregerie Channel, West Gregerie Channel, and Redhook Bay on Saint Thomas; the ports of Krause Lagoon, Limetree Bay, and Frederiksted on Saint Croix, and the port of Cruz Bay on Saint John were open with restrictions. On September 25, 11 flights arrived with 200,000 meals, 144,000 liters of water, and tarps. Troops were activated and deployed to the U.S. Virgin Islands from the Virginia National Guard,WSLS: \\"First group of Virginia National Guard soldiers departs for US Virgin Islands\\" September 25, 2017 the West Virginia National Guard,West Virginia Metro news: \\"W.Va. Guard troops to ride out Maria in Virgin Islands\\" By Chris Lawrence September 19, 2017 Missouri National Guard,U.S. Army news: \\"Missouri Army National Guard to support Virgin Islands relief effort\\" by 1st Lt. Phil Fountain September 25, 2017 and UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters from the Tennessee Army National Guard. Nearly a month after the hurricane, electricity had been restored to only 16 percent of people in St. Thomas and 1.6 percent of people in St. Croix. Three months after Maria, about half the entire U.S. territory still had no power, and 25% of the U.S. territory had no cell service. Criticism of U.S. government response San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz (pictured) harshly criticized the federal response to Maria in Puerto Rico as inadequate. The U.S. government hurricane response was widely criticized as inadequate and slow. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not immediately waive the Jones Act for Puerto Rico, which prevented the commonwealth from receiving any aid and supplies from non-U.S.-flagged vessels from U.S. ports. A DHS Security spokesman said that there would be enough U.S. shipping for Puerto Rico, and that the limiting factors would be port capacity and local transport capacity. The Jones Act was waived for a period of ten days starting on September 28 following a formal request by Puerto Rico Governor Rossell√≥. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz called the disaster a \\"terrifying humanitarian crisis\\" and on September 26 pleaded for relief efforts to be sped up. The White House contested claims that the administration was not responding effectively. General Joseph L. Lengyel, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, defended the Trump Administration's response, and reiterated that relief efforts were hampered by Puerto Rico being an island rather than on the mainland. President Donald Trump responded to accusations that he does not care about Puerto Rico: \\"Puerto Rico is very important to me, and Puerto Rico‚Äîthe people are fantastic people. I grew up in New York, so I know many people from Puerto Rico. I know many Puerto Ricans. And these are great people, and we have to help them. The island is devastated.\\" Mayor Cruz criticized the federal response on September 29 during a news conference. \\"We are dying and you are killing us with the inefficiency,\\" she said. Trump responded by criticizing her for \\"poor leadership\\", and tweeted that the mayor and \\"others in Puerto Rico ... want everything to be done for them.\\" Frustrated with the federal government's \\"slow and inadequate response\\", relief group Oxfam announced on October 2 that it planned to get involved in the humanitarian aid effort, sending a team to \\"assess a targeted and effective response\\" and support its local partners' on- the-ground efforts. The organization released a statement, saying in part: \\"While the US government is engaged in relief efforts, it has failed to address the most urgent needs. Oxfam has monitored the response in Puerto Rico closely, and we are outraged at the slow and inadequate response the US Government has mounted,\\" said Oxfam America's president Abby Maxman. \\"Oxfam rarely responds to humanitarian emergencies in the US and other wealthy countries, but as the situation in Puerto Rico worsens and the federal government's response continues to falter, we have decided to step in. The US has more than enough resources to mobilize an emergency response, but has failed to do so in a swift and robust manner.\\" In an update on October 19, the agency called the situation in Puerto Rico \\"unacceptable\\" and called for \\"a more robust and efficient response from the US government\\". A rally for victims of the hurricane and Puerto Rico's status in general, in Long Beach, California, on October 3 On October 3, 2017, President Trump visited Puerto Rico. He compared the damage from Hurricane Maria to that of Hurricane Katrina, saying: \\"If you looked‚Äîevery death is a horror, but if you look at a real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of people that died, and you look at what happened here with really a storm that was just totally overbearing, nobody has seen anything like this ... What is your death count as of this morning, 17?\\". Trump's remarks were widely criticized for implying that Hurricane Maria was not a \\"real catastrophe\\". While in Puerto Rico, Trump also distributed canned goods and paper towels to crowds gathered at a relief shelter and told the residents of the devastated island \\"I hate to tell you, Puerto Rico, but you've thrown our budget a little out of whack, because we've spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico, and that's fine. We saved a lot of lives.\\" On October 12, Trump tweeted, \\"We cannot keep FEMA, the Military & the First Responders, who have been amazing (under the most difficult circumstances) in P.R. forever!\\", prompting further criticism from lawmakers in both parties; Mayor Cruz replied, \\"You are incapable of empathy and frankly simply cannot get the job done.\\" In response to a request for clarification on the tweet from Governor Rossell√≥, John F. Kelly assured that no resources were being pulled and replied: \\"Our country will stand with those American citizens in Puerto Rico until the job is done\\". After visiting Puerto Rico about two months after the hurricane, Refugees International issued a report that severely criticized the slow response of the federal authorities, noted poor coordination and logistics, and indicated the island was still in an emergency mode and in need of more help. Politico compared the federal response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico to that for Hurricane Harvey, which had hit the greater Houston area of Texas a month earlier. Though Maria caused catastrophic damage, the response was slower in quantitative terms. A Harvard Humanitarian Initiative analysis of the military deployment in March 2018 said the military mission in Puerto Rico after hurricane was better than critics say but suffered flaws. It concluded that the U.S. military itself performed as well in Puerto Rico as it does in its international relief missions, and that coordination had been greatly improved since Katrina, but that real shortcomings exist in planning for disasters. After the official death toll was updated to the estimated 2,975 on August 28, 2018, President Donald Trump stated that he still believed the federal government did a \\"fantastic job\\" in its hurricane response . and less than a month later Trump described the federal response to Hurricane Maria as \\"an incredible, unsung success ... the best job we did was Puerto Rico [compared to hurricanes in Texas and Florida] but nobody would understand that\\". These remarks received condemnation from Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz and other figures, who cited the near 3,000 death toll as not showing a success. Whitefish Energy contract Comparison of lights at night in Puerto Rico before (top) and after (bottom) Hurricane Maria Soon after the hurricane struck, Whitefish Energy, a small Montana-based company with only two full- time employees, was awarded a $300 million contract by PREPA, Puerto Rico's state-run power company, to repair Puerto Rico's power grid, a move considered by many to be highly unusual for several reasons. The company contracted more than 300 personnel, most of them subcontractors, and sent them to the island to carry out work. PREPA cited Whitefish's comparatively small upfront cost of $3.7 million for mobilization as one of the main reasons for contracting them over larger companies. PREPA Executive Director Ricardo Ramos stated: \\"Whitefish was the only company‚Äîit was the first that could be mobilized to Puerto Rico. It did not ask us to be paid soon or a guarantee to pay\\". No requests for assistance had been made to the American Public Power Association by October 24. The decision to hire such a tiny company was considered highly unusual by many, such as former Energy Department official Susan Tierney, who stated: \\"The fact that there are so many utilities with experience in this and a huge track record of helping each other out, it is at least odd why [the utility] would go to Whitefish\\". Several representatives, both Democrats and Republicans, also voiced their concern over the choice to contract Whitefish instead of other companies. As the company was based in Whitefish, Montana, the hometown of US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, and one of Zinke's sons had once done a summer internship at Whitefish, Zinke knew Whitefish's CEO personally. These facts led to accusations of privatization and cronyism, though Zinke dismissed these claims and stated that he had no role in securing the contract. In a press release on October 27, FEMA stated it did not approve of PREPA's contract with Whitefish and cited \\"significant concerns\\". Governor Rossell√≥ subsequently ordered an audit of the contract's budget. DHS Inspector General John Roth led the FEMA audit while Governor Rossell√≥ called for a second review by Puerto Rico's Office of Management and Budget. The governor then demanded that the contract be cancelled; this was executed on October 29. On April 18, 2018 (Wednesday), The Associated Press reported that the entire island experienced a blackout. On April 19, 2018 (Thursday), Puerto Rico's power company said that it has restored electricity to all customers affected by an island-wide blackout that was caused by an excavator hitting a transmission line, but tens of thousands of families still remain without normal service seven months after hurricanes Maria and Irma. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul√≠n Cruz said one week before the blackout that about 700,000 Americans in Puerto Rico didn't have power after a line repaired by Montana contracting firm Whitefish Energy had failed. Puerto Rico's electric grid has suffered in the months since Hurricane Maria struck the island. The territory announced earlier in 2018 that it would privatize its power system over its \\"deficient service.\\" Cruiseline French America Line claimed to be working with Whitefish Energy, and that their boat the \\"Louisiane\\" would serve as \\"headquarters for relief services\\" after Hurricane Maria. Further investigation revealed that the boat had been docked in New Orleans since 2016. French America Line has been accused of scamming customers without delivering on services, and some have alleged the company used proposed \\"Hurricane relief services\\" as a coverup. Retirement On April 11, 2018, at the 40th session of the Regional Association Hurricane Committee, the World Meteorological Organization retired the name Maria from its rotating name lists, due to the highly extensive amount of damage and loss of life it caused along its path, especially in Dominica, Saint Croix, and Puerto Rico, and it will never again be used to name an Atlantic hurricane. It will be replaced with Margot for the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season.

He was the eldest son of Frederick of Antioch, imperial vicar of Tuscany, and Margherita di Poli. He was thus a grandson of the Emperor Frederick II (reigned 1220‚Äì50), a nephew of King Manfred of Sicily (1258‚Äì66) and cousin of King Conradin (1266‚Äì68). His surname, which is contemporary, comes from his paternal grandmother, a mistress of Frederick II from Antioch. He may be called \\"Conrad I\\" to distinguish him from his descendants with the same given name. Conrad's activity was mainly confined to the north of the Kingdom of Sicily and to the Papal State. Under Manfred, he governed several counties and held numerous castles in fief in the region of Abruzzo. He fought as Manfred's representative to re-assert Staufer control of central Italy. After Manfred's death, he was forced into exile by the Angevin conquest. In exile Conradin elevated him in rank by granting him the title Prince of Abruzzo and he took part in Conradin's attempt to regain the kingdom. Following the failure of this in 1268, he became a prisoner-of-war until 1272. The remaining forty years of his life were mostly spent quietly at his castle in Anticoli, save for the years 1282‚Äì86, at the start of the War of the Vespers, when he launched several invasions and raids into Abruzzo. These ultimately failed to shake Angevin control. Early life castle of Alba today Conrad was born probably in the same year as his parents' marriage (1240) or in the following year.Raoul Manselli, \\"Antiochia, Corrado di\\", Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani, Vol. 3 (Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 1961). His father died in 1256 and he inherited the counties of Alba, Celano and Loreto, as well as numerous feudal possessions the Ruffi Mountains, around the Aniene river and in the Marsica.Alberto Meriggi, \\"Corrado I di Antiochia\\", Enciclopedia Federiciana (Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 2005). One of these, the town of Anticoli Corrado, today bears his name.Roberto Almagi√† (ed.), \\"Anticoli Corrado\\", Enciclopedia Italiana (Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana, 1929). He also received Saracinesco, Mola, Sambuci, Rocca dei Sorci, Rocca dei Murri and the castle of Piglio. Nothing is known of Conrad's childhood or youth. He is first mentioned in the Chronicon Lauretanum for the year 1258, when he was already exercising the captaincy of Abruzzo. He attended the parliament convoked by his uncle at Foggia in September and October, where he his possession of the counties of Alba, Celano and Loreto was confirmed, and he was give the county of Abruzzo as well as some small estates in Calabria. At some point between 1258 and 1261, Conrad married Beatrice Lancia, daughter of Galvano Lancia, grand marshal of Sicily. They had five sons and three daughters. Two of his sons, Bartolomeo and Francesco, held the office of archbishop of Palermo in succession; two of his daughters, Costanza and Giovanna, married the brothers Bartolomeo I and Cangrande I della Scala, respectively. Vicariate in Ancona and Spoleto In 1256, Manfred, still only acting as regent on behalf of his nephew Conradin, asserted Conradin's rights to the Romagna (Romandiola), the March of Ancona and the Duchy of Spoleto, which the Papacy also claimed. At a general colloquy in Naples in October 1261, Manfred, now king, appointed Conrad his vicar general in the March, the Duchy and the Romagna and charged him with leading an invasion to capture the disputed provinces. The army he was given was composed almost entirely of Saracens from Lucera. Conrad invaded the Duchy of Spoleto in the summer of 1262. His assault on Spoleto itself failed, but with the help of the town of Matelica he was successful in taking the hilltop fortress of Castel Santa Maria from the city of Camerino. He proceeded to win over to Manfred's allegiance most of the towns of the March of Ancona through a combination of threats, donations and the granting of privileges. In December 1263, after more than a year of campaigning, he was captured by trickery while besieging Treia and imprisoned in the dungeon of the tower. His father-in-law led several unsuccessful assaults on the town in an effort to force his release, but succeeded in sneaking Conrad out of the town in January 1264. There was suspicion that the podest√†, Baglione Baglioni, had been corrupted, a charge Pope Clement IV was still leveling in 1266. Conrad remained in the March of Ancona throughout 1264, for which he was excommunicated by Pope Urban IV. In 1265, he returned to his fiefs in Abruzzo. Angevin invasion of Sicily In 1265, with an invasion of Sicily by Count Charles of Anjou imminent, Conrad conferred with Manfred at Lucera. He then returned to Abruzzo to raise troops. He was still there when Charles invaded the kingdom and defeated Manfred at the Battle of Benevento on 26 February 1266. Conrad had several clashes with Charles's supporters in Abruzzo, but with Manfred's death in battle he decided to go into hiding in the mountains with his father-in- law, Galvano, and Galvano's brother, Federico. Although Conrad and the Lancia brothers offered to submit to Charles, their offer was rejected. They tried to flee to Calabria, but this proved impossible with Charles's spies scouring the mountains. The fugitives then crossed into Papal territory and appealed to Clement IV, offering complete submission if the pope would intercede on their behalf with Charles. Clement agreed and, with Charles's approval, lifted Conrad's excommunication. According to the Chronicon Lauretanum, however, Charles ignored the pope's offers of mediation. He eventually captured Conrad and imprisoned him in a secret location. In January 1267, Conrad escaped from his prison along with a companion, Giovanni di Mareri. He took refuge in his castle at Saracinesco. Charles threatened to kill Conrad's daughter Beatrice, whom he had taken as a hostage while her father was still negotiating his submission, but was dissuaded by the imminent arrival of an army under Conradin, the Staufer claimant to the kingdom of Sicily. Conradin's invasion In October 1267, Conrad met his cousin, Conradin, at Verona while the latter was preparing his advance into Sicily. He performed the act of homage to Conradin and offered his services. In return, Conradin issued a charter confirming to Conrad all the fiefs he had held under Manfred and granting him the new title Prince of Abruzzo (princeps Aprutii). Despite the honour and the rank it implied (highest below the king), Conrad does not appear to have ever used the title.Pier Fausto Palumbo, Contributi sulla storia dell'et√† di Manfredi (Roma: 1959), p. 175. In November, Henry of Castile, the senator of Rome and leader of the pro-Staufer Ghibelline party in Rome, arrested the leaders of the pro-Angevin Guelph faction and had them imprisoned in Saracinesco under the watch of Conrad's mother, Margherita, and wife, Beatrice. In response this, on 25 April 1268, Clement IV issued the bull Die coena Domini, excommunicating Conradin and his followers, including Conrad of Antioch. Conrad followed Conradin to Rome, where his entry on 24 July 1268 was greeted with festivities put on by the Ghibellines. When Conradin's army entered Sicilian territory a few days later, Conrad was leading a contingent of Tuscan militia. He was captured at the Battle of Tagliacozzo (23 August) along with Conradin. The latter was executed by Charles on 29 August, but Conrad, who was imprisoned in Palestrina, was spared through the intercession of Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini (the future Pope Nicolas III), whose two brothers, Napoleone and Matteo, were among the prisoners being held by Conrad's wife. Finally, in the middle of September, the two brothers were released and in exchange Conrad was transferred to papal custody. Imprisonment and Papal fealty Clement IV died in November 1268, and during the lengthy Papal election that followed, Conrad was kept in confinement in Viterbo (where the cardinals were electing a new pope). Gregory X was finally elected in September 1271. In March 1272, soon after Gregory arrived at Viterbo, he freed Conrad and received in return an oath of fealty. He also lifted his excommunication a second time. Following his release, Conradin went to Anticoli, his fief in the Papal State. His uncle Enzo, like Conrad's father an illegitimate son of Frederick II, had died in prison on 6 March 1272 and in his will, made shortly before his death, bequeathed to Conrad the county of Molise, which he had once held in the kingdom of Sicily. This bequest made sense from a dynastic perspective, since Conrad was, after the premature death of Conradin, the only person capable of rebuilding the family's power in Italy and Molise lay beside his lands in Abruzzo. For his part, Conrad partially made good on Enzo's testament by occupying the town of Macchia in Molise. Nothing is known of Conrad's activities between 1272 and 1282. It is probable, however, that he was among those partisans of the Staufer, like John of Procida, who encouraged Peter III, king of Aragon, to conquer the kingdom of Sicily in the name of his wife, Constance, daughter of King Manfred. War of the Vespers Following the Sicilian Vespers in March 1282, Peter of Aragon did invade Sicily. He landed on the island in August, and in October he wrote to Conrad from Messina urging him to invade Abruzzo from his base at Anticoli. This was the start of a war that was to last until 1302. Castle and town of Alba as depicted prior to modernisation in the 19th century (detail of illustration by Edward Lear) In response to Peter's call, Conrad tried to win over the fortresses along the Sicilian frontier through secretive negotiations. Pope Martin IV demanded he desist and, when he did not, pronounced him excommunicated for the third time on 23 November. He then invaded Abruzzo with a small force to carry out a guerrilla war. He often had the support of the common people, and captured the castles of Antrodoco, Frontino, Mareri and Petrella Liri. In June 1283, Charles of Anjou's son and heir, Charles, Prince of Salerno, who was acting as regent while Charles raised troops and ships in France, ordered several castles near the frontier dismantled to prevent their falling into Conrad's hands. Following the Aragonese victory at the Battle of the Gulf of Naples (5 June 1284), where the Prince of Salerno was captured, Conrad led another invasion of Abruzzo, this time aiming to recapture his county and castle of Alba. In this first effort he was stopped near the castle of Celle by Stefano Colonna, lord of Genazzano in the Papal State, who was acting as the pope's man. He continued to plan the occupation of Abruzzo, even receiving money from Constance in Sicily. The death of Charles in January 1285 provided a second opportunity, and Conrad successfully occupied several castles of Abruzzo and even the county of Alba by 1286. He was unable to hold them for long. The pope sent an army under Giovanni d'Appia to dislodge him and Conrad retreated to Anticoli. Retirement and death The third invasion of Abruzzo was the last major political act of Conrad's life. He lived out his days in Anticoli, where he was still living in 1301. According to the Historia Augusta of Albertino Mussato, a contemporary, on 7 May 1312 an aged Conrad went to Rome at the head of fifty knights to welcome the arrival of Henry VII of Germany for his imperial coronation. This was a major gathering of Ghibellines, who hoped that Henry VII would re-establish the empire in Italy. It is probable that the death of Charles I opened the way to reconciliation with the Prince of Salerno, now Charles II, for Conrad managed to pass on to his descendants several fiefs in Abruzzo and Calabria. He also received from Peter of Aragon the county of Capizzi in Sicily. At some point after his death, his descendants split into two branches: one in Anticoli and Piglio and another in Capizzi. The Capizzi line died out in the fourteenth century, while that of Anticoli survived a century longer. References Further reading *Carosi, G. P.

Much of her early life was spent at her family's farm near Putaruru. She rode ponies to school, worked with cattle for the Agricultural & Pastoral shows, and helped with animal care, hay-making and food preservation. This knowledge of animals and farm landscape would later come into play in her work. After a family move to Rotorua, Gabrielle attended high school at the Diocesan School for Girls, Auckland. Though often reprimanded for \\"scribbling\\" in her books and drawing instead of studying, she completed her studies and graduated in 1932. She married Christopher Yeats in 1939 and had two children, Bridget and Kit. Career Fruit and Flowers (1951), watercolor on paper. While living with Yeats and their children in Whitford, New Zealand, Gabrielle began to paint with watercolours more frequently and develop her skills. She painted in the countryside alone or with friends, including Geoff Fairburn and Robert Nettleton Field. For a short time she studied life drawing with tutors including Archibald Fisher at the Elam School of Fine Arts, though the challenge of commute and her family's needs caused her to stop. The family lived together for a short time at Waiheke Island and continued holidaying there for many years. A number of Gabrielle's works feature the beach there, its pigeons and seagulls, its people and its landscapes. In 1950 after her marriage to Yeats ended, she moved to Parnell in Auckland and began painting more seriously. Gabrielle worked part time at a photography studio retouching and colouring photographs. She also made connections with local artists, getting involved with the local Workers' Educational Association and hosting weekly life drawing sessions for the group at her house. Gabrielle began to have opportunities to show her works in galleries and exhibitions, including with the Auckland Society of Arts and the Waikato Society of Arts. She married local artist and newspaper proofreader Paul Hope in November 1953. The next year they moved to Forrest Hill, New Zealand with Gabrielle's children. She began to experiment more with her painting at this time, trying new materials such as egg tempera, gouache and Chinese brushes, and expanding her subject matter to include more philosophical and religious themes, including Buddhism, Zen and the tao of painting. Her second marriage ended in the late 1950s. After a turbulent relationship with Pat Hitchings and multiple moves, Gabrielle died suddenly of a stroke on 9 September 1962, in Howick, New Zealand. Work Cattle at Rest (1953) Gabrielle's primary media were watercolour and gouache, which she enjoyed because of their ability to layer colour with spontaneity and without the time constraints of oil paints. She was influenced early on by the portraiture of Augustus John. Later, Pablo Picasso's influence can be seen in Gabrielle's paintings of bulls and other animals. In her 1953 painting Cattle at Rest, Gabrielle used the sgraffito technique used in Picasso's later ceramics and paintings. In 1953 art critic Tom Bolster described her work in the yearly Auckland Society of Arts exhibition as \\"sensitively drawn without being mawkish.\\" Ross Fraser, who met Gabrielle in 1955 and knew her until her death, has said that she had \\"sympathetic interest in individuals, in the human condition, and in the miraculous and inexhaustible morphology of the animal world.\\" By 1954, Gabrielle was using techniques from Chinese painting books, and her style became more bold, gestural and avant-garde. After her work was displayed at a solo gallery exhibition at Peter Webb's gallery in 1957, Imric Porsolt described her as having an \\"engaging lack of discipline, and no pretensions to deliver a message.\\" He said her paintings \\"delight more by healthy colour than by firm composition, and by directness rather than by elaboration.\\" References 1916 births 1962 deaths 20th-century New Zealand painters People from Lower Hutt New Zealand women artists 20th-century New Zealand women artists ","title":"Gabrielle Hope"},{"id":"55262077","text":"Harry Easton Godwin (August 22, 1907 ‚Äì May 27, 1986) was born in New Jersey and grew up in Chicago and Virginia.
