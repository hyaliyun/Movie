It is a red brick building constructed in the 1870s. For many years it was the only public building in the hamlet. It remained in use as school for over a half a century. Since then it has been converted into a residence. In 1987 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Building The school is at the western edge of a one-acre (4,400 m¬≤) lot at the top of a rise on the northeastern edge of the older section of the city of New Hamburg. It has a view south toward the Wappinger Creek estuary at the Hudson River. The land to the west and north is wooded. Some of the original property has since been subdivided and developed with more modern houses. The building itself is a two-story brick structure on a stone foundation with a gabled roof. Asphalt shingles cover the original tin. Its line is marked by broad projecting eaves with a bracketed cornice on all sides. The slightly arched windows have projecting hoods and sills of cast iron. A round vent is in the gable peak on the south (front) elevation, and a fire escape runs across the front. On the east and west are two projecting entrance pavilions. They are similar to the main block in decoration but have flat roofs. The west one, which originally rose to a bell tower on the third story, has a transomed entrance with a decorative hood stopped with corbels. The interior plan is intact. A second floor gym/auditorium space has not been further partitioned, and a large classroom on the first floor still has cast- iron columns in the center and one of its original blackboards. History The building was probably begun in the early 1870s, during New Hamburg's peak years as a river port. It replaced an old one-room schoolhouse on the main road towards Poughkeepsie, and is first shown on an 1876 map. At the time of its construction it was the only Free School in the Town of Poughkeepsie, with its own local school board. It is still in basic form a one-room schoolhouse, but five times large than the extant Grammar School in Chelsea to the south. Its size and placement on the rise overlooking the river suggest the pride the community of New Hamburg took in it. The modest decoration shows the widespread acceptance of the Picturesque aesthetic in the area at the time. It remained in use until the district was absorbed into the Wappinger Central School District in 1940. After the war it was used as a plastic factory for a while. It lay vacant and was later restored into a house, with art studio space.

He visited Constantinople, where he was baptized. His baptismal name was Stephen.  Life  He descended from a family whose members held the hereditary title gyula, which was the second in rank among the leaders of the Hungarian tribal federation. Hungarian scholars identify him as Zombor (Zubor) who is mentioned in the 13th-century Gesta Hungarorum, although Gyula (Gyyla/Geula) and Zombor are brothers according to the anonymous author of the Gesta. According to the Hungarian chronicles, his family‚Äôs progenitor was one of the seven conqueror chiefs who occupied Transylvania at the time of the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin. The Hungarian historian Gyula Krist√≥ argues that the area where his domains were situated around 950 lay in the region bordered by the rivers Temes (Timi≈ü), Maros (Mure≈ü), K√∂r√∂s (Cri»ô), Tisza and Tutisz (unknown, but possibly the B√©ga (Bega)), because it equals to the entire dwelling area of Turkia (Hungary) as described by the contemporary Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus. The Romanian born American historian, Florin Curta suggests that it is possible that the gyula and the harka (another leader of the Hungarian tribal federation) ruled over the southern region of the Carpathian Basin, because most finds of 10th-century artifacts of Byzantine origin found in Hungary cluster at the confluence of the rivers Tisza and Maros. According to the Hungarian P√©ter V√°czy, Gyula‚Äôs tribe moved to Transylvania in his time. Ioannes Skylitzes narrates that around 952 Gyula visited Constantinople, where he was baptized, and Emperor Constantine VII lifted him from the baptismal font. He also received the honorary title patrikios in Constantinople. Gyula was given a bishop named Hierotheos who accompanied him back to Turkia (Hungary). Thus Gyula, who received the Stephen name, adopted the Christian faith, what is more its Orthodox (Byzantine) variety.

To distinguish him from his father, he is often referred to as \\"the younger\\".  Life  His father was the history painter Carl Joseph Begas and he began his studies with his elder brother, Reinhold, a well-known sculptor. He later attended the Prussian Academy of Art, where he was a student of Louis Sussmann-Hellborn. In 1869 and 1870, he took a study trip to Rome, where he completed several portrait busts. After three years back home in Berlin, he returned to Italy, where he lived for five years. In 1880, he made a bust of the Kaiser for the New Gallery in Kassel. Two years later, he turned to producing larger figures; two for the University of Kiel and two for the Kassel City Hall. In 1889, he became a Professor at the Kunsthochschule Kassel, but stayed for only a short time before leaving to take on more public commissions. From 1904-1906, he created a marble statue of Empress Augusta Victoria, which was the first to be placed in the Rose Garden at the new palace in Sanssouci. After the monarchy was abolished, the statue was moved to the New Palace. For the Siegesallee project he created two groups. Group 7 (1899) contained a statue of Otto IV, Margrave of Brandenburg-Stendal (nicknamed \\"Otto with the Arrow\\"), with busts of Johann von Kr√∂cher (an advisor to the Margrave) and Johann von Buch (Glossator of Sachsenspiegel). In Group 31 (1900), the statue was Frederick William IV of Prussia; the busts were Alexander von Humboldt and Christian Daniel Rauch.

Origins He was born in Cheshunt, Hertfordshire in 1547, the second surviving son of Sir Anthony Denny, a Privy Councillor to King Henry VIII and one of the Guardians of his young son and successor King Edward VI. His nephew was Edward Denny, 1st Earl of Norwich (1569-1637), who died without male issue and was buried at Waltham Abbey in Essex. Career Orphaned in childhood, he inherited lands in Hertfordshire. After some minor appointments at court, in 1573 he went to Ulster on a military expedition led by Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex. Denny then took up privateering, capturing a Spanish ship in 1577 and a Flemish one in 1578. The same year saw him join a colonizing expedition led by Sir Humphrey Gilbert and Walter Raleigh; however, their ships were forced to turn home due to bad weather. Ireland Denny and his cousin Raleigh were then sent to Ireland to help put down the Second Desmond Rebellion. Denny led a company at the infamous Siege of Smerwick, when 400 Spanish and Italian troops were beheaded by the English after surrendering. In 1581 he commanded another expedition to Ireland and returned with the head of Garret O‚ÄôToole, leader of one of the Irish clans. High Sheriff, Knight and MP Denny first became a Member of Parliament for Liskeard in Cornwall for the 1584 to 1585 parliament. He was granted lands at Tralee, confiscated from the Earl of Desmond; he both became High Sheriff of Kerry and was knighted in 1588. His estates in Ireland were a financial failure and in 1591 he returned to England to command a naval expedition to the Azores. It has not been established whether it was this Sir Edward Denny or his nephew and namesake who was elected Knight of the Shire for Westmorland in 1593, however it is certain that in 1597 he was returned to Parliament for the \\"rotten borough\\" of Tregony in Cornwall. The following year he returned to Ireland during the Nine Years' War, to find that the confiscated land he had been granted had been ransacked. Disgruntled by the lack of rewards for his service to the Crown, Denny allied himself to Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Late in 1599 or early in 1600, Denny \\"took a deadly sickness in his country‚Äôs service\\".

Through the MCM local individuals with entrepreneurial qualities can start their own business through ‚Äúsweat equity‚Äù and realize profits from inception. Although it rarely works in practice, the model allows for collaboration with local strategic partner organizations to adapt local solutions and train and support local entrepreneurs who serve rural communities within designated territories. What drives the model is an interdisciplinary, intuitive and non-linear approach whereby all stakeholders add value. The model utilizes a rotating capital mechanism with low start-up costs that are continually reinvested. In essence, the MCM strives to intervene at all levels by creating an ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù whereby problems are diagnosed and products are encountered/designed which are then inserted into the distribution model via the locally trained and supported entrepreneurs. A Guatemalan woman tests a pair of reading glasses at a village campaign. The MCM is a sustainable, replicable means of delivering health- related and economically beneficial goods and services to remote villages.Micro-Consignment: An Emerging Model of Social Entrepreneurship It uses entrepreneurship to empower the villagers to help themselves. It is a social entrepreneurship approach that is built to organically and opportunistically respond to long-standing challenges. The MCM creates access to health care-related goods and services in isolated rural communities. The key to the MCM is that local women (AC's) and organizations (SC's) are given the opportunity to become entrepreneurs by selling goods and services in their communities using a consignment mechanism. The MCM creates job opportunities where there weren't any before, and \\"businesses that can generate jobs for others are the best hope of any country trying to put a serious dent in its poverty rate.\\"Surowiecki, James. \\"What Microloans Miss.\\" The New Yorker 17 Mar. 2008. Unlike the traditional approach of giving handouts to rural communities, the MCM is scalable, replicable, and sustainable. The majority of MCM local entrepreneurs are women who have no other opportunities to generate additional household income. Local organizations also work as entrepreneurs primarily through the use of kiosks. The MCM creates synergies between all the stakeholders in the supply chain, from low-cost providers to local organizations, to the local entrepreneurs, and ultimately, to the consumers.  The Problem  Poverty is only a symptom of a real problem of lack of access to services and products. One solution to this problem ‚Äî providing access to capital for entrepreneurs in the developing world - has been addressed through the microcredit revolution. Other innovations have been developed to address access to education and medical care, including medicines to treat AIDS and TB. However, a model that addresses a wide spectrum of issues, including chronic conditions such as pulmonary and gastrointestinal illnesses, vision problems, malnutrition, water scarcity, lack of energy, and the like, has not been effectively implemented at scale to date. Access can only be created if the product, place, price, and people work in concert to serve those in need in a manner that takes into account their cultural, social, and geographic conditions.Van Kirk, Greg. \\"The MicroConsignment Model: Bridging the 'Last Mile' of Access to Products and Services for the Rural Poor.\\" Innovations Hyderabad 2010 (2010): 129. The products necessary for solving problems of access - stoves, water filters, reading glasses, solar panels, and more - already exist. They simply need a way to reach the rural communities that have the greatest need. There is no lack of human capital or local entrepreneurial spirit eager to find solutions. Local transportation networks already reach vulnerable communities, and microcredit organizations are already dedicated to solving the problem of access to needed funds. What has been missing is a model that puts the pieces of the puzzle together.  The Solution  An MCM entrepreneur administers an eye exam to a community member in Concepci√≥n, a village of Quetzaltenango, Guatemala. The MCM aims to solve this puzzle by delivering essential products and services at affordable prices to the rural poor in the developing world. MCM entrepreneurs, primarily young women and homemakers who work within defined territories, provide solutions to health problems, save families money, help individuals increase their productivity, and help protect the environment. MCM entrepreneurs offer solutions to help the population at the ‚Äúbase of the pyramid‚Äù ‚Äî in this case, the most vulnerable rural communities ‚Äî by addressing the ‚Äúwhat‚Äù (essential products and services), the ‚Äúwho‚Äù (rural villagers), and the ‚Äúwhere‚Äù (rural villages) by creating a highly scalable local distribution network that works to diagnose and address the myriad obstacles confronting these communities in a sustainable way.Van Kirk: 129-30.  History  The MCM was created and developed by Greg Van Kirk (recognized as an Ashoka Fellow in 2008) and George Bucky Glickley. Greg and George were Peace Corps Volunteers in Guatemala from 2001 to 2003. The MCM first emerged in 2003 when Greg donated money to a wood- burning stove project from the profits of tourism businesses he created in the town of Nebaj, where he was working during the Peace Corps. This donation supplied a handful of stoves to an equal number of families in a local village. Like millions of Guatemalans, these families had always cooked campfire-style on their dirt floors, which had long been recognized as extremely energy inefficient and harmful to the health of family members, particularly women and children. Relief agencies had determined that the construction of inexpensive, locally manufactured, concrete stoves could immediately and dramatically reduce energy costs and improve the health and safety of family members. A man constructs a stove in Guatemala. Greg realized, however, that merely donating stoves severely limited the capacity for distribution. Once the relief money was expended, nobody else could get a stove. Greg concluded that many more people could obtain these stoves if their distribution was built on a sustainable economy. As a response to this challenge, Greg developed what would become the MCM. Stoves would be locally manufactured, materials provided to local entrepreneurs on consignment and marketed and sold to low income families in villages on an interest-free basis. The money saved in energy costs allowed the stoves to essentially pay for themselves as families made payments over six months. The health, economic and environmental benefits would go on for years. This model would not only provide an essential, high-quality product at an affordable cost to villagers but would provide new income generating opportunities to local individuals as entrepreneurs. Soon after this initial iteration of the model was launched, George joined Greg to further develop and expand this initiative. Upon finishing their Peace Corps responsibilities, Greg and George stayed in Guatemala and formed New Development Solutions as a means to provide consulting services to USAID, Chemonics, Soros Foundation and the like. In March 2004, they were contracted by Scojo Foundation (now VisionSpring) to work in El Salvador to help them find an effective way to distribute reading glasses to low income villagers. It is estimated that over 90 percent of people over 40 years old will need near-vision reading glasses to see up close. VisionSpring was utilizing a microcredit model at the time to provide local women with a means to distribute the glasses but it wasn't working effectively. Greg and George noted that microcredit is very effective for people who already have established businesses and purchase raw materials from a local distributor to meet unmet demand. However, selling reading glasses, much the same as selling wood-burning stoves, requires a different approach. Due to the fact that awareness needs to be created, a high quality service is the driver, there are no local distributors, training is essential, and the perceived and real financial risk by potential entrepreneurs is very high, they concluded that microcredit was a suboptimal model to achieve VisionSpring's desired outcomes. Microcredit is generally neutral regarding what target businesses buy and sell. Any effort to deliver new, ‚Äúmedium and high intervention‚Äù products and services to vulnerable villagers must first look at the villager's needs and then inductively create an entrepreneurial structure that meets those needs. George Bucky Glickley and Greg Van Kirk with Francisca Chavajay -- entrepreneur, midwife, and head of a local women's association in San Juan La Laguna, Solol√°, Guatemala. Greg and George concluded that the MCM could effectively mitigate the challenges that VisionSpring was confronting utilizing microcredit. After in-depth analysis and testing, VisionSpring decided to adopt the MCM as its implementation mechanism. Greg and George realized that the MCM could work as a unique means to get villagers potentially myriad products and services that addressed health, economic, environmental and educational needs. It was this realization that led to them to establish the US non-profit 501 (c) (3) Community Enterprise Solutions in 2004 as the engine to test, develop, implement and expand the MCM in Guatemala and ideally other countries in the future. Their concept was to devise a way to create national scale and local self- sustainability. The key was to train a growing number of primarily women entrepreneurs who could offer a growing mix of essential products and services in an increasing number of remote villages.The MicroConsignment Model: The Origins  The Results  As of September 2009, through the combined efforts of Community Enterprise Solutions and Social Entrepreneur Corps (which offers opportunities for students and recent graduates to volunteer in Guatemala), Soluciones Comunitarias (the social business carrying out the MCM in Guatemala) has trained over 180 local entrepreneurs who have executed approximately 1,800 village campaigns and sold over 35,000 products. The product offering has expanded and now includes wood-burning stoves, reading/near vision glasses, UV protection eyeglasses (January 2005), eye drops (January 2006), water purification buckets (December 2008), vegetable seeds (January 2008), energy efficient light bulbs (January 2008), and solar lamps (January 2010).CE Solutions: Impact > Overview As well, a new entrepreneurial channel has been created whereby local community organizations are provided with product kiosks and training in order to serve their constituents in new ways and earn extra income in the process. By some calculations approximately $1,000,000 of direct economic and immeasurable health and environmental impact have been created. In 2008 the MCM reached approximately 375 villages in Guatemala and served 16,200 beneficiaries. This equates to a direct economic impact of $288 per village served and $6.66 per beneficiary.The MicroConsignment Model: The Origins Gross revenues from the sales of the products total approximately $330,000, and MCM entrepreneurs have earned profits of approximately $60,000. Using the official Guatemalan daily minimum wage of $6.75 - although most people, women in particular, cannot earn anything close to this in rural areas - these earnings equate to approximately 8,888 days of work. There are presently 65 MCM women entrepreneurs and 16 socios comunitarias.  MicroConsignment vs. Microcredit  Microfinance often provides entrepreneurs with much-needed funding that would not otherwise be available. But navigating the terrain of owning a successful business is more complicated than securing loans. The MCM offers \\"a more focused effort on assisting in entrepreneurship ‚Äì the whole process from start to end, not just the financing of it.\\"Pryor, Luke. \\"A New Piece of the Puzzle .\\" The Cornell Daily Sun 17 Nov. 2009. A key difference between microcredit and the MCM is when the product purchase takes place. In a microcredit model, the entrepreneur first buys the products on credit and then sells them. She then uses her sales revenue to pay back the loan, and ideally buys more products to sell after taking out her profit. If the entrepreneur doesn't sell, she is left with both inventory and debt. Products for sale at an entrepreneur's village campaign. The MCM has the opposite timing. The entrepreneur is first provided products at no cost, then she sells them, pays the supporting organization, and pockets her profits‚Äîbut only after having completed a sale. At that point she gets her inventory restocked and the cycle begins again. If she doesn't sell, just as in a credit scheme, when the woman doesn't sell, organizational capital is tied up out in the field. However, this capital is tied up in the organization's products that the entrepreneur is simply holding for sale and not in a loan that the entrepreneur must find some way to pay back. The woman can go out and sell the next day, or the next week or next month without falling into debt. Another difference between the two models can be observed in how entrepreneurs reinvest their earnings. Where credit is used as the enabling mechanism, entrepreneurs may use their earnings for personal consumption before they have time to restock their inventories, which stunts their growth. MCM entrepreneurs reinvest efficiently in their ventures. Because they buy their goods after they make a sale, they do not consider the portion of their revenues that goes to restocking their inventory as theirs.Van Kirk: 131-32. One of the most compelling differences between microcredit and the MCM is related to risk and uncertainty. Credit works in risky markets, whereas the MCM works in uncertain markets. The power of the MCM lies in the fact that it creates new access and new markets where none previously existed.Van Kirk: 132. As James Surowiecki writes in his article for The New Yorker, ‚ÄúHanging Tough,‚Äù referencing economist Frank Knight, ‚ÄúRisk describes a situation where you have a sense of the range and likelihood of possible outcomes. Uncertainty describes a situation where it‚Äôs not even clear what might happen, let alone how likely the possible outcomes are.‚ÄùSurowiecki, James. \\"Hanging Tough.\\" The New Yorker 20 Apr. 2009. However, one person's risk may be another person's uncertainty. Perception, not necessarily reality, defines this distinction. Although there is risk in almost any endeavor, actors in high-risk situations may feel such a level of discomfort that they cross the line from risk into uncertainty. Credit-driven structures work when the entrepreneur perceives risk. An entrepreneur whose inventory is 100 percent funded up front through credit must sell immediately and sell consistently in order to avoid debt. Therefore, she must understand and feel comfortable with her risk before taking out a loan. For example, if I know my supply-and-demand equation and can predict that I will likely be able to sell my products, I might take out a loan to buy my inventory. However, when a potential entrepreneur perceives the market as not just risky but uncertain, the MCM has the potential to be an optimal solution. When offering new products to new markets, it can be impossible for an entrepreneur to calculate their risk. If an entrepreneur is highly skeptical of market demand for a new product, she will not want to take out a loan and bear all of the up-front risk.Van Kirk: 133 Consequently, the MCM was designed to fill the gap for previously unknown and/or inaccessible products from the perspective of both entrepreneurs and the villagers ‚Äî their potential customers. MCM entrepreneurs engage in businesses where supplies have never existed, perceived demand is highly unpredictable, and thus the environment is uncertain. Beneficiaries often barely understand the needs MCM products and services address. For example, MCM entrepreneurs have helped thousands of village weavers who thought they were going blind to solve their problems instantly by getting a free eye exam and buying a $5 pair of reading glasses. The weavers would never have thought of this solution because they did not even understand their problem. The MCM entrepreneurs in turn had never thought they would be able to offer such a service, which was previously only accessible for los ricos, the rich. This is a highly uncertain situation for an entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs must be empowered through a mechanism that finances the support and time necessary to change perceived uncertainty into risk that can be evaluated.Van Kirk: 134.

The Camel Dissolvables brands are marketed as \\"a convenient alternative to cigarettes, and moist snuff for adult tobacco consumers.\\" Camel Dissolvables \\"will not be positioned as a smoking cessation or reduced risk product,\\" and are evolutions from the loose and pouched smokeless tobacco options.Beirne, Mike.

Frequently Asked Questions. 2007. Accessed 22 April 2010. The Ariva and Stonewall brands are marketed as a means of \\"reducing toxins in tobacco so that adult consumers can have access to products that expose them to sharply reduced toxin levels\\" while still providing consumers with tobacco and nicotine. The product is not marketed as a smoking cessation product, but an \\"alternative tobacco product\\" that is \\"not combusted.\\"Star Scientific. Questions and Answers about Ariva Toxin Levels Star Scientific recommends the Ariva brand for smokers whereas, the Stonewall brand is recommended for heavy smokers, defined as smokers who consume more than one pack a day, and users of other smokeless tobacco products such as snuff. The Ariva brand has been shown to have significantly reduced levels of tobacco-specific lung carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-l-(3-pyridyl)-l-butanone (NNK) although \\"exposures to other tobacco-specific nitrosamines (i.e., NNN), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene), and metals\\" have not been assessed.Baumgart, et al. \\"Pilot study on lower nitrosamine smokeless tobacco products compared with medicinal nicotine.\\" Nicotine and Tobacco Research. 12 December 2007. However, Star Scientific notes, \\"there is currently no proof that lowering nitrosamines will decrease health risk.\\"  Product constituents  The Ariva brand, introduced in 2001, contains 1.5 milligrams of nicotine in each piece and dissolves in the mouth in 10‚Äì30 minutes. The Stonewall brand, introduced in 2003, have more surface area than the Ariva pieces and contain four milligrams of nicotine per piece, with each piece dissolving in 10‚Äì30 minutes. The Ariva brand is offered in Wintergreen flavor and the Stonewall brand is offered in Natural, Wintergreen, and Java flavors. Other than the Virginia StarCured Tobacco and \\"other natural and artificial flavorings\\" including the non-sugar sweetener sucralose, Star Scientific has not made a specific ingredient list public because it claims to \\"seek to protect proprietary product information\\" because Stonewall and Ariva are \\"the only dissolvable smokeless tobacco products in the marketplace.\\"Starconsumerctr. \\"Other Ingredients?\\" General Discussion. 17 Jul 2009.

Before Swiz formed, Brown had been the original vocalist for Dag Nasty. Metcalf departed shortly after the band recorded its first demo and Swiz continued as a four-piece. The band released its first 7\\", Down, at the end of 1987 and its self-titled LP was released by Sammich Records in 1988. Swiz recorded its next album, Hell Yes, I Cheated, in 1989. The record also included a track by Fury, a side project that consisted of Farrell, Daniels, Brown (on bass), and Chris Thomson (formerly of Ignition, later of Circus Lupus), on vocals. By the time Hell Yes, I Cheated was released in 1990, Larson had left the band and was replaced by Dave Stern. This line-up recorded an EP in May 1990 but broke up shortly afterwards. The EP, titled With Dave, was released posthumously in 1992 by Jade Tree Records. In 1993, Jade Tree also released No Punches Pulled, which contained the band's entire discography. Also that year, THD Records released a 7\\" called Rejects, which contained unused tracks from the Down sessions. Nathan Larson resurfaced with Shudder To Think and later went into soundtrack work. Jason Farrell and Dave Stern formed Bluetip in 1995. After Bluetip's demise, Farrell formed Retisonic and is also a graphic designer whose work has appeared on many records by a number of different bands. Alex Daniels played drums in Severin from 1990‚Äì1993. Shawn Brown fronted the band Jesuseater and currently works as a tattoo artist. In 1996, Brown, Farrell, Stern, and Daniels reunited under the name Sweetbelly Freakdown and released a 7\\" and an album on Jade Tree.

Manually placing boxes on pallets can be time consuming and expensive; it can also put unusual stress on workers. The first mechanized palletizer was designed, built, and installed in 1948 by a company formerly known as Lamson Corp. There are specific types of palletizers including the row-forming which were introduced in the early 1950s. In row-forming palletizing applications loads are arranged on a row forming area and then moved onto a different area where layer forming takes place. This process repeats until a full layer of goods and products are configured to be placed on a pallet. The in-line palletizer was developed in the 1970s when higher speeds were needed for palletizing. This palletizer type utilizes a continuous motion flow divider that guides the goods into the desired area on the layer forming platform. Robotic palletizers were introduced in the early 1980s and have an end of arm tool (end effector) to grab the product from a conveyor or layer table and position it onto a pallet.http://www.pmtdirect.com/website/article.asp?id=1806 Both conventional and robotic palletizers can receive product at a high elevation (typically between 84‚Äù - 2.13m to 124‚Äù - 3.15m) or low ‚Äúfloor level‚Äù elevation (typically at 30‚Äù - 0.76m to 36‚Äù - 0.91m).

American Blind and Wallpaper Factory, Inc., No. 5:03-cv-05340 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 18, 2007),Google, Inc. v. American Blind and Wallpaper Factory, Inc., No. 03-cv-05340 JF (RS) (N.D. Cal. Apr. 18, 2007). was a decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California that challenged the legality of Google's AdWords program. The court concluded that, pending the outcome of a jury trial, Google AdWords may be in violation of trademark law (see federal Lanham Act, (1)) because it (1) allowed arbitrary advertisers to key their ads (see keyword advertising) to American Blind's trademarks and (2) may confuse search-engine users initially interested in visiting American Blind's website into visiting its competitors' websites (see Initial Interest Confusion doctrine). Google v. American Blind was not the first case to address trademark infringement in the context of online keyword advertising (see Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp.,Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp., 354 F.3d 1020 (9th Cir. 2004). 1-800-CONTACTS v. WhenU Inc.1-800-CONTACTS v. WhenU Inc., 414 F.3d 400 (2d Cir. 2005).). Nevertheless, it generated interest in the trademark-law community because it came on the heels of Playboy v. Netscape‚Äîa case that failed to resolve the legality of keyword advertising in which the origins of ads are clearly designated.Kevin J. Heller, American Blind v. Google , Tech Law Advisor (Mar. 31, 2005). Despite a four-year battle, American Blind settled with Google soon after this decision, hence leaving much of this legal territory unexplored.  Background   Facts  Google's AdWords program enables advertisers to trigger a display of their ads when Google users perform keyword searches. Per Google policy, advertisers may trigger their ads on arbitrary keywords, including trademarked keywords that they do not own. This permits competitors of American Blinds to place their ads alongside American Blind's ads when a user searches for \\"American Blind\\", \\"American Blinds\\", or \\"Decoratetoday\\"‚Äîall of which are registered trademarks of American Blind. In its stated objective to minimize user confusion concerning the affiliation of the ads, Google places ads in specially marked \\"Sponsored Links\\" sections of the web-page and prohibits unauthorized trademark use in the ad content. But despite requests from American Blind and others, Google refuses to discontinue its use of trademarks to trigger the ads.  History  The case began in Nov. 2003 when Google preemptively sought a judicial determination that its AdWords program did not infringe American Blind's trademarks. In May 2004, American Blind counter-sued Google for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act. Google subsequently filed a motion to dismiss in 2005, which was denied.Google, Inc. v. American Blind & Wallpaper Factory, Inc., No. 03-cv-05340 JF (RS) (N.D. Cal. Mar. 30, 2005) (denying in part Google's motion to dismiss American Blind's trademark infringement allegations). Finally, Google filed a motion for summary judgement, which resulted in this decision.  Dispute  American Blind alleged that Google infringed on its trademarks by enabling advertisers to key their ads to American Blind's marks. Google argued that American Blind's \\"claims were baseless, and that Google's trademark policies are perfectly reasonable and lawful.\\"Eric Auchard, Trademark plaintiff drops suit vs. Google over ads, Reuters (Sep. 4, 2007). Under the Lanham Act, one infringes a trademark if (1) one uses the mark in commerce per , (a)(1) and (2) one employs the mark to deceive or induce consumer confusion per (a)(1)(A), both without the consent of the mark's owner (). In support of its motion for summary judgment, Google argued that American Blind could prove neither element of its claim.  Trademark use  American Blind alleged that Google \\"used\\" its mark as defined in the Lanham Act (), based on precedent established in Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Netscape Communications Corp.‚Äîa case in which Netscape's keyword advertising was deemed to have used Playboy's trademark. = Google's defense = Google argued that, despite the Playboy v. Netscape holding, its use of trademarked keywords did not constitute use under the Lanham Act for two reasons. First, it did not place the mark on any of its goods or services per precedent set in Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc.;Rescuecom Corp. v. Google Inc., 456 F. Supp. 2d 393 (N.D.N.Y. 2006). Later overturned by 562 F.3d 123 (2d Cir. 2009) only advertisers do so. Second, the trademarked keywords are used internally and hence are akin to private thoughts. Specifically, courts prior to Playboy v. Netscape (e.g., 1-800-CONTACTS v. WhenU Inc.) have deemed private thoughts to be outside the scope of the Lanham Act. = Court's decision = The Court concluded that Google's use of American Blind's trademarks was a use per the Lanham Act, for two reasons. First it was bound by the precedent set in Playboy v. Netscape, in which Netscape's practice of keying searches to trademarked terms was deemed a use of Playboy's marks. The court notes that although use was not explicitly established in the Playboy ruling, the Playboy court focused heavily on the question of confusion, thereby implicitly signaling that use was established. Second, the Court pointed out that precedent set in other circuits also agree that keying is use. For example, in 800-JR Cigar, Inc. v. GoTo.com, Inc.800-JR Cigar, Inc. v. GoTo.com, Inc., 437 F.Supp.2d 273 (D.N.J 2006). the court concluded that \\"by accepting bids from those competitors of JR desiring to pay for prominence in search results, GoTo trades on the value of the marks\\", and hence \\"uses\\" the mark as defined in the Lanham Act.  Trademark confusion  American Blind alleged that \\"although Google claims publicly that its ads are conspicuous and differentiated from its genuine search results, this is not necessarily true.\\" In support, American Blind presented the results of a survey in which \\"29% of respondents falsely believed...that the sponsored links were affiliated with American Blind.\\" American Blind's allegation was relevant because Courts have looked to the Sleekcraft multi-factor test (established in AMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft BoatsAMF Inc. v. Sleekcraft Boats, 599 F.2d 341 , 348-49 (9th Cir. 1979).) to determine if there was a likelihood of confusion. American Blind's confusion analysis centered on the fourth Sleekcraft factor: evidence of actual confusion. = Google's defense = Google made two key arguments against American's Blind's allegation. First, it argued that, contrary to case law established in Playboy v. Netscape, the Sleekcraft factors are inapplicable in this case because they were meant for those offering the goods. Google argued that it isn't the one selling the goods‚Äîit just put up the advertisements. Second, Google argued that even if the Sleekcraft factors applied, there was no evidence of actual confusion. In particular, Google claimed that American Blind's survey of actual confusion was methodologically flawed: there was no control group and it studied only some of the trademarks in question. = Court's decision = Despite Google's argument against using the Sleekcraft factors, the court concluded it must use them per precedent established in Playboy v. Netscape, and that there were sufficient issues of material fact in question to preclude summary judgment. Specifically, the court held that some of the Sleekcraft factors may weigh in favor of American Blind. For example, it noted that there was some evidence of actual confusion, even if the degree to which it could be relied on was questionable. As another example, the court noted that the degree of consumer care exercised (Sleekcraft factor six) in the arena of online advertisements may be lower than in others, and hence may work in favor of American Blind.  Settlement  Shortly after this decision, American Blind settled its dispute with Google in what some legal experts considered \\"a stunning victory for Google.\\" Many saw the terms of the agreement as remarkably favorable for Google: it paid nothing to American Blind, which in turn agreed to not sue Google \\"so long as Google follows is current trademark policy.\\" American Blind won no concessions in return from Google, and in fact was forced to make a $15k compensation to Google for negligence in the discovery process. The reason for the settlement was controversial. American Blind's CEO Joel Levine stated that continuing litigation made little financial sense in light of American Airlines' dispute with Google over the same issue: \\"American Airline is more well-suited to take on Google than we are. We sell blinds and wallpaper and that's what we do best. We're not litigators.\\"Jessie Seyfer, Google Foe Ends Unique Trademark Suit Over Keywords Law.com (Sep. 5, 2007). In contrast, attorneys for Google said that American Blind settled because \\"they had a terrible case and they decided it wasn't worth pursuing. They quit and went home.\\"  Impact  Had American Blind pursued the case and won at a later date, it seems likely that Google's advertising business would have been severely impacted. Indeed, AdWords revenue accounts for more than 98% of its annual revenue, with the percentage affected by trademark issues unknown. As Judge Fogel remarked in an earlier ruling: ‚ÄúThe large number of businesses and users affected by Google‚Äôs AdWords program indicates that a significant public interest exists in determining whether the AdWords program violates trademark law.\\" The outcome of this case called into question the economic rationale for fighting Google on trademark issues. American Blind claimed that the action was justified by the fact that 50% of its revenue comes from web traffic. However, trademark expert Eric Goldman noted that, if anything, this case serves as an example of a lawsuit that \\"from the trademark owner's standpoint, absolutely makes no financial sense\\".Eric Goldman, Google Gets Mixed Bag in Latest Ruling in American Blinds Case, Technology & Marketing Law Blog (Apr. 19, 2007). In particular, he noted that American Blind incurred huge legal fees even though it was unlikely, in Goldman's opinion, to have suffered much profit loss due to diverted keyword advertising in the first place. The fact that American Blind wasn't able to fight Google all the way left some wondering if anyone could challenge Google's use of trademarks. Legal expert Eric Goldman observed that trademark cases against Google have failed because the plaintiffs in those cases were small companies with few financial resources and relatively obscure brand names. For example, American Blind, Rescuecom, and Check-n-Go (all of which have disputed trademark issues with Google) are small to medium- sized companies that don't have particularly famous marks.

In January 2011, Gregory N.

In February 2011, Lorillard and R.J.

On July 21, 2014, U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon (Washington, DC) ruled that \\"FDA erred in determining that the members didn't have conflicts of interest\\" and that the appointments were arbitrary and capricious. FDA was also ordered to reconstitute the TPSAC. TPSAC Decision on Menthol Cigarettes On March 18, 2011 the panel concluded that removing menthol cigarettes from the market would benefit public health in the United States, but stopped short of recommending that the FDA take any specific actions like restricting or banning the additive. A progress report on panel findings is expected in July 2011. In March 2011, the tobacco industry released a report to the FDA in response to the TPSAC decision claiming menthol cigarettes are no riskier than regular cigarettes and should not be regulated differently. The U.S. District Court decision from July 21, 2014 ruled that \\"Conflicts of interest ‚Äî whether actual or perceived ‚Äî undermine the public's confidence in the agency's decision-making process and render its final product suspect\\", blocking the TPSAC report on menthol cigarettes from being used for regulatory purposes.

It was listed as a Michigan Historic Site and added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 26, 1981. Early history The factory complex was constructed between 1905‚Äì1912 for Weis Binder Company, originally from Toledo, Ohio. It was built along with many other new industries during Monroe's sudden economic growth at the turn of the twentieth century. The original section of the plant was completed in 1905, and the factory began producing file folders, cardboard binders and index cards in early 1906, with a staff of 60 people. A few years later, the company began constructing wooden bookcases and other office furniture. The company made an addition in 1909, doubling the floor space. Business boomed, and a few years later another addition was constructed. (note: large pdf file) When completed in 1912, the complex consisted of three main buildings for a total of 120,000 ft¬≤ (11,150 m¬≤) and employed 300 people. From 1912‚Äì1964, the company produced paper and office equipment. In 1964, the complex was purchased by Floral City Furniture Company, a subsidiary of La-Z-Boy, which was based in Monroe. A few years later, the Weis complex was renamed the La-Z- Boy Chair Company. In 1978, the facility was completely vacated when the main La-Z-Boy headquarters on North Telegraph Road expanded to include their own manufacturing complex. WoodCraft Square The city of Monroe purchased the unused complex from La-Z-Boy for only $1 in 1980, where it continued to remain abandoned and boarded up for several more years. The city converted much of the main building into a low-income senior citizens residence, although the outside of the structure has remained unchanged since it was originally built. The complex's name was changed to WoodCraft Square and currently has 208 renovated units. Description The Weis Manufacturing Company complex contains five brick structures. Three of which are combined into a single building located along Union Street; the other two structures are separate buildings located behind the Union Street section. The three buildings along Union Street are of nearly identical construction, but have varying heights, making them distinguishable from one another. The northernmost portion of the Union Street building was constructed in 1905/06, and is a two-story, flat- roofed, 30-bay structure with segmentally-arched four-over-four light windows and a corbelled brick cornice. The central portion of the Union Street building, built in 1909, is similar, but sits on a high basement, lifting it above grade. The southernmost portion of the Union Street building, built in 1917, is a fourteen-bay extension of the central wing, and reflects the same design elements, but stands three stories high. However, the elevations of this portion not facing Union Street are dissimilar to the front elevation, and have wide bays of almost floor to ceiling windows separated with brick piers. The larger of the two structures behind is a three-story, brick, flat- roofed, trapezoidal structure built in 1911. It displays similar design elements to the Union Street buildings. The smaller structure is a former boiler house, and is a single-story rectangular brick building with a gable roof.

Hashmatsa) is a 2009 documentary film by award-winning filmmaker Yoav Shamir. It examines antisemitism and, in particular, the way perceptions of antisemitism affect Israeli and U.S. politics. A major focus of the film is the Anti-Defamation League. Defamation won Best Documentary Feature Film at the 2009 Asia Pacific Screen Awards. Content The film examines whether anti-Semitic has become an all purpose label for anyone who criticizes Israel and the possibility that some Jews' preoccupation with the past‚Äîi.e., the Holocaust‚Äîis preventing progress today. Shamir decided to make Defamation after a critic of an earlier film accused him of antisemitism. Filmmaker Yoav Shamir states in the beginning of the film that as an Israeli he has never experienced antisemitism himself and wants to learn more about it since references to antisemitism in countries all over the world are common in the Israeli media. The film includes interviews with Abraham Foxman, the head of the Anti-Defamation League, John J. Mearsheimer, co-author of New York Times best seller The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, Norman Finkelstein, a critic of Israeli government policy, as well as many other individuals. Defamation follows a group of Israeli high school students on a class trip to Poland where they tour Auschwitz, as well as a number of other notable Holocaust locations (March of the Living). The film says that in 2007, the ADL reported a spike in antisemitism, claiming that there were 1,500 anti- Semitic incidents in the United States, yet when Shamir contacts the ADL they can only list minor incidents such as websites with inflammatory comments, letters from employees denied time off for a Jewish holiday, or people offended by a cop's use of the word \\"Jew\\". A case presented concerns about a group of African American boys, ages between 10 and 12, who pelted a school bus with rocks, breaking two windows. Shamir interviews a rabbi who says that the hypervigilance of the ADL inflames relations between Jews and non-Jews in the United States. He finds that among his interviewees there is more sensitivity to antisemitism among secular Jews than religious ones. Reception Rotten Tomatoes lists 13 positive and 3 negative reviews, giving Defamation an 81% approval rating. After it was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, the Anti-Defamation League issued a statement denouncing the film, stating that it \\"belittles the issue (of antisemitism) ... and cheapens the Holocaust. It is Shamir's perverse, personal, political perspective and a missed opportunity to document a serious and important issue.\\" The New York Times reviewer Neil Genzlinger states that while these ideas deserve a thorough and dispassionate discussion, Shamir has not provided it: \\"...it feels like just another day on the Op-Ed page.\\"Movie Review (Defamation) Neil Genzlinger, The New York Times, November 20, 2009 Boston Globe reviewer Ty Burr wrote \\"Unlike many agit-docs, Defamation wants to get you thinking, and it knows the epithet ‚Äúself-hating Jew‚Äô‚Äô can be used as a club by those who don‚Äôt want you to think at all.\\" His review was positive, highlighting how the film argues that raising \\"Israelis to define themselves as a nation of victims...is a disservice to modern complexities ‚Äî and, not coincidentally, makes it almost impossible to see any other people as victims.\\" The review in the Los Angeles Times praised the documentary for showing \\"how accusations of anti-Semitism can easily be exploited for political purposes.\\" The reviewer commended the filmmaker for his fairness writing that \\"even though Defamation, which is sprinkled with unexpected moments of wry humor, will be inescapably controversial, Yoav Shamir strives admirably to be evenhanded.\\" In an interview for The Jerusalem Post about criticism on the film, Shamir said: \\"At the end of Defamation both Finkelstein and Foxman were cross with me. I felt like I did a good job\\".

Azerbaijan is a major producer of crude oil and natural gas. It has one of the highest energy self-sufficiency ratios in the world. As of 2012, the country's total greenhouse gas emisssions stood at 69 MtCO‚ÇÇe (million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent). Azerbaijan aims to reduce its emission by 35% by 2030.  History  In 1846, Azerbaijan became the site of the world's first industrially drilled oil well. By 1899, Azerbaijan produced half of the volume of the world's oil. The Araz hydroelectric power station with a total capacity of 22 MW was constructed in 1970, Tartar hydroelectric power station with a total capacity of 50 MW in 1976 and Shamkir hydroelectric power station with a total capacity of 380 MW in 1982. At that time, along with the construction of power stations, electrical networks were systematically developed and the country's sustainable energy system was created. In those years, \\"Ali Bayramli\\" Thermal power station with 330 kV ‚Äì ‚ÄúAghdam ‚Äì Ganja ‚Äì Aghstafa‚Äù, ‚ÄúAli Bayramli ‚Äì Yashma ‚Äì Derbent‚Äù, 5th Mingachevir, 500kV 1st and 2nd Absheron, ‚ÄúMukhranis ‚Äì Vali‚Äù and other power lines, \\"Yashma\\", \\"Ganja\\", \\"Agstafa\\" with 330/110/10 kV, Imishli with 330/110/10 kV, Absheron with 500/330/220 kV, \\"Hovsan\\", \\"Nizami\\", \\"Mushfig\\", \\"Sangachal\\", \\"Masalli\\", \\"Agsu\\" and \\"Babek\\" with 220/110/10 electrical substations have been put into operation. $53 million loan was granted to Azerbaijan by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for the construction of the Yenikend hydroelectric power station in December 1995, and constructed a Yenikend HPP with a total capacity of 150 MW. The reconstruction of the Mingachevir hydroelectric power station, 330 kV Aghjabadi, 110 kV Barda substantions and the 330kV Azerbaijan Thermal Power Station - 330 kV ‚ÄúAgjabadi-Imishli‚Äù transmission lines were implemented at the expense of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Islamic Development Bank. Two gas-turbine units with a capacity of 53.5 MW each at Baku thermal power station at the expense of German bank - Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale, and a 400MW steam gas plant at the ‚ÄúShimal‚Äù power plant at the expense of the Japanese International Cooperation Bank's loan were commissioned in 2002. On February 14, 2005, the head of state approved the State Program on ‚ÄúDevelopment of the Fuel and Energy Complex (2005-2015) in the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù. Electricity demand of the economy of country has completely been paid by 12 thermal power stations such as Azerbaijan TPP, Shirvan TPP, Shimal TPP, Baku TPP, Nakhchivan TPP, Astara, Khachmaz, Sheki, Nakhchivan, Baku, Quba, Sangachal power stations, and 6 water power stations such as, Mingechevir, Shamkir, Yenikend, Varvara, Araz, Vaykhir HPP. Their total capacity was about 5900 megawatts. 90 percent of electricity production in Azerbaijan accounts for TPPs, and 10 percent for hydroelectric power stations. The Energy Regulatory Agency under the Ministry of Energy was established on the basis of the Department for State Energy And Gas Supervision of the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Azerbaijan by the Decree of president dated December 22, 2017, and its charter was approved. According to the World Energy Trilemma ƒ∞ndex, compiled by the World Energy Council for 2017, Azerbaijan has taken the 31st place (BBA) among 125 countries. According to the Global Energy Architecture Performance Index report 2017, compiled by the World Economic Forum, Azerbaijan ranked 36th out of 127 countries with 0.67 score. According to 2016 report of organization that mentioned above, Azerbaijan ranked 32nd out of 126 countries with 0.68 score. Economic growth and development was 0,68 score, environmental sustainability 0.57 score, energy access and security 0.79 score. On April 19, 2019, SOCAR president Rovnag Abdullayev and BP‚Äôs regional president for Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, Garry Johns signed a contract cost $6 billion. The final investment decision on the Azeri Central East (ACE) platform, which is planned to be built on the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) block, has been adopted at the signing ceremony. The construction is scheduled to start in 2019, and the completion is scheduled for mid-2022.300px Oil *Production: - (2008) *Consumption: - (2007) At the turn of the 20th century, Azerbaijan accounted for half of the world‚Äôs oil production.Balayev, S.G. 1969, Oil of the Country of Eternal Fire: Baku, Azerneshr Publishing House, 160 p. Oil wells have been operating in Baku since the 1840s. Well before the famous discovery of oil in a drilled well in Pennsylvania by Edwin Drake in 1859, Azerbaijan had drilled its first oil well in Bibi-Heybat (settlement of Baku) in 1846. As of the early 21st century, almost all production came from off shore in the Caspian Sea. Azerbaijan was one of only four former Soviet republics (along with Russian, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan) to be self- sufficient in petroleum. However, production declined following the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union until foreign investment provided the capital for new development, turning this trend around in 1998. Production rose from in 1998 to an average of in 2004. According to industry journals and government sources, proven oil reserves as of 2004 totaled between 7 billion and . The State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR) has planned for joint development of the off shore fields (which are now largely untapped) and has entered into several agreements to build oil pipelines. For instance, a project with the Caspian Pipeline Consortium would carry oil from the Caspian Sea to the Russian Black Sea port of Novorossiysk. Another deal with Turkey involved the construction of a 1,760 km pipeline, the symbolic first length of which was installed in September 2002, to carry crude oil from Baku to Ceyhan, Turkey. In 1995 Azerbaijan had 17 offshore oil fields in production. Guneshli, about 96 km off the Azeri coast, currently accounts for more than half the annual production. By the end of 2002, 33 companies in 15 foreign countries had signed agreements to develop 21 major oil fields in Azerbaijan. As of 2003 disputes over off shore oil rights in the Caspian Sea continued to hinder development of those reserves. From 1987 to 1993, production deceased from 13.8 million tons of oil and 12.5 billion cubic meters gas to 10.3 million tons of oil and 6.8 billion cubic meters of gas. The annual rate of decline in production was 7.1% for oil and 13.5% for gas. The exploratory drilling decreased by 17 times, or by 170,000 meters, was 10,000 meters in 1995 compared to 1970.  \\"Shah deniz-2\\"  \\"Shah Deniz-2\\" energy strategic projects is the energy security and energy diversification project. Contract of the Shah Deniz gas field was signed in 1996, and the first pipeline connecting the Caspian Sea with the Georgian side of the Black Sea coast was built in 1999. The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan main oil export pipeline connecting the Caspian Sea with the Mediterranean and international markets was built in 2006, and the Southern Gas Pipeline in 2007.  Transparency The 2013 report by UK-based Global Witness NGO revealed that companies working in Azerbaijan‚Äôs oil industry have no transparency and accountability. It has been documented that millions of dollars of revenue disappear into the hands of obscurely owned private companies that cooperate with SOCAR.New Report Highlights Lack Of Transparency In Azerbaijan's Oil Industry. RFE/RL Dec. 10, 2013 The report concluded that the opacity of the deals struck by Socar \\"is systemic\\" and added, ‚ÄúThese findings should be of great concern to the international community as a whole. Oil and its derivative products are central to the Azerbaijani economy, making up 95% of exports in 2011. It is important for Europe that Azerbaijan keeps the oil and gas flowing and maintains a transparent and well-run energy industry. Yet this briefing shows that much of the oil business in Azerbaijan remains opaque, and corruption is still perceived to be at epidemic levels‚Ä¶\\"Azerbaijan Anonymous Global Witness Natural Gas Natural gas exports, 2007‚Äì2017 Natural gas production has become more important in recent years, especially in Baku, where some of the oil wells have been exhausted. Proven reserves as of late 2004 totaled 1.37 trillion cubic metres. Production of natural gas in 2011 totaled 17.66 billion cubic metres. Ukraine and Iran are interested in running a natural gas pipeline through Azerbaijan en route to Eastern Europe. On March 10, 2016, Natiq Aliyev, Azerbaijani energy minister, publicly said that Azerbaijan has enough gas reserves to fill the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). The SGC is an energy project whose goal is to move 10 billion cub meters of gas from Azerbaijan through Georgia and Turkey to Europe. Electricity *production: 24.32 billion kWh (2017) *consumption: 17.09 billion kWh (2017) Electrical power is the widely utilized energy source in Azerbaijan in terms of domestic and industrial use. Electricity production and its distribution are covered by the state-owned Azerenerji JSC and Azerishig JSC.The whole country's electricity demand is furnished by the power stations operating under Azerenerji. 13 of those stations are thermal power stations with the installed capacity of 5400 MW power, and 17 are hydro-power stations with the installed capacity of 1162.2 MW power.Moreover, a number of small power stations have been set up by other companies in the country by utilizing water, wind, solar, domestic wastes. Total installed capacity in September 2019 is 6.6455 million kW. Eight thermal plants supply 80% of capacity, including Shimal-2 power station put into used in early September 2019. 12% comes from 2 hydroelectric plants (Mingachevir HPP and Shamkir HPP), and the rest from other thermal, hydro and small hydro plants. The main power plants (both are thermal) are near Shirvan (Janub TPP - 780 MW) and Mingechaur (Azerbaijan TPP - 2,400 MW).  Report of 2017  The power of the country's electroenergy system has reached 7,172.6 MW. Currently, the system's capacity is 5200 MW and the peak power required is around 3750-3900 MW. In 2017, the production of electricity amounted to 22 209.8 million kWh including 20 445.4 million kWh at thermal power plants and 1 732.8 million kWh of electricity at hydroelectric power stations and totally decreased by 2.0% compared to the corresponding period of 2016 (22 665.7 million kWh). Totally 4778.8 million cubic meters of natural gas and 311.5 thousand tons of mazut were used for electricity generation during the year. 50 MVA transformer with 110/35 kV, two 110 kV circuit breakers and 35 kV electrical equipment were installed at Hoca Hasan substation of Binagadi district. 110 kV double-circuit transmission line between 110 kV \\"Liman\\" and \\"White City\\" substations, three transformer substations with 35 / 0,4 kV were constructed. In 2017, oil production amounted to around 38.7 million tons in the country. 28.9 million tons of extracted oil belonged to the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli, 2.4 million tons to Shah deniz (condensate) and 7.4 million tons to the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic.

Foreign investment competition with non- energy sectors In January 2015, the president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, announced that he would direct his government to create programs to bring investment dollars to industries other than oil. Specifically, President Aliyev cited industrial and agricultural industries as an example. Aliyev cited Azerbaijani‚Äôs economy by saying, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why it‚Äôs much easier to attract investments to stable countries with socio-political stability and information growth.‚Äù He said that the banking industry will become more important in helping develop the country‚Äôs non-energy industries.

From this observation, it can be inferred that the quark momentum distributions in nucleons bound inside nuclei are different from those of free nucleons. This effect was first observed in 1983 at CERN by the European Muon Collaboration, hence the name \\"EMC effect\\". It was unexpected, since the average binding energy of protons and neutrons inside nuclei is insignificant when compared to the energy transferred in deep inelastic scattering reactions that probe quark distributions. While over 1000 scientific papers have been written on the topic and numerous hypotheses have been proposed, no definitive explanation for the cause of the effect has been confirmed.D. Higinbotham, G.A Miller, O. Hen, and K. Rith, CERN Courier, April, 26 2013 Determining the origin of the EMC effect is one of the major unsolved problems in the field of nuclear physics.  Background  Protons and neutrons, collectively referred to as nucleons, are the constituents of atomic nuclei, and nuclear matter such as that in neutron stars. Protons and neutrons themselves are composite particles made up of quarks and gluons, a discovery made at SLAC in the late 1960s using deep inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments (1990 Nobel Prize). In the DIS reaction, a probe (typically an accelerated electron) scatters from an individual quark inside a nucleon. By measuring the cross section of the DIS process, the distribution of quarks inside the nucleon can be determined. These distributions are effectively functions of a single variable, known as Bjorken-x, which is a measure of the momentum fraction of the struck quark. Experiments using DIS from protons by electrons and other probes have allowed physicists to measure the proton's quark distribution over a wide range of Bjorken-x, i.e. the probability of finding a quark with momentum fraction x in the proton. Experiments using deuterium and helium-3 targets have similarly allowed physicists to determine the quark distribution of the neutron. Experimental history  Fig 1. The original figure from the paper by the EMC Collaboration. In the absence of the EMC effect, the data would not have a falling slope as a function of Bjorken-x.In 1983, the European Muon Collaboration published results from an experiment conducted at CERN in which the DIS reaction was measured for high-energy muon scattering from iron and deuterium targets. It was expected that the cross section for DIS from iron divided by that from deuterium, and scaled by a factor of 28 (The iron-56 nucleus has 28 times more nucleons than deuterium) would be approximately 1. Instead, the data (Fig. 1) showed a decreasing slope in the region of 0.3 < x < 0.7, reaching a minimum of 0.85 at the largest values of x. This decreasing slope is a hallmark of the EMC effect. The slope of this cross section ratio between 0.3 < x < 0.7 is often referred to as the \\"size of the EMC effect\\" for a given nucleus. Since that landmark discovery, the EMC effect has been measured over a wide range of nuclei, at several different laboratories, and with multiple different probes. Notable examples include the E139 experiment at SLAC, which measured the EMC effect in 4He, 9Be, 12C, 27Al, 40Ca, 56Fe, 108Ag, and 197Au, and found that the EMC effect increases with nuclear size. The E03-103 experiment at Jefferson Lab focused on high-precision measurements of light nuclei and found that the size of the effect scales with local nuclear density rather than average nuclear density. Fig 2: Another figure from the original EMC paper, showing predictions for the scaled DIS cross section ratio based on Fermi effects. These predictions do not match the experimental data.  Possible explanations  The EMC effect is surprising because of the difference in energy scales between nuclear binding and deep inelastic scattering. Typical binding energies for nucleons in nuclei are on the order of 10 megaelectron volts (MeV). Typical energy transfers in DIS are on the order of several gigaelectron volts (GeV). Nuclear binding effects were therefore believed to be insignificant when measuring quark distributions. A number of hypotheses for the cause of the EMC effect have been offered. While many older hypotheses, such as Fermi motion (see Fig. 2), nuclear pions, and others have been ruled out by electron scattering or Drell-Yan data, modern hypotheses generally fall into two viable categories: mean-field modification, and short-range correlated pairs.  Mean-field modification  The mean- field modification hypothesis suggests that the nuclear environment leads to a modification of nucleon structure. As an illustration, consider that the average density inside a nuclear matter is approximately 0.16 nucleons per fm3. If nuclei were hard spheres, their radius would be approximately 1.1 fm, leading to a density of only 0.13 nucleons per fm3, assuming ideal close- packing. Nuclear matter is dense, and the close proximity of nucleons may allow quarks in different nucleons to interact directly, leading to nucleon modification. Mean-field models predict that all nucleons experience some degree of structure modification, and they are consistent with the observation that the EMC effect increases with nuclear size, scales with local density, and saturates for very large nuclei. Furthermore, mean-field models also predict a large \\"polarized EMC effect, a large modification of the spin- dependent g1 structure function for nuclei relative to that of their constituent protons and neutrons. This prediction will be tested experimentally as part of the Jefferson Lab 12-GeV program.  Short-range correlations  Rather than all nucleons experiencing some modification, the short-range correlations hypothesis predicts that most nucleons at any one time are unmodified, but some are substantially modified. The most heavily modified nucleons are those in temporary short-range correlated (SRC) pairs. It has been observed that approximately 20% of nucleons (in medium and heavy nuclei) at any given moment are part of short-lived pairs with significant spatial overlap with a partner nucleon. The nucleons in these pairs then recoil apart with large back-to-back momenta of several hundred MeV/c, larger than the nuclear Fermi momentum, making them the highest-momentum nucleons in the nucleus. In the short-range correlations hypothesis, the EMC effect stems from large modification of these high-momentum SRC nucleons. This is supported by the observation that the size of the EMC effect in different nuclei correlates linearly with the density of SRC pairs. This hypothesis predicts increasing modification as a function of nucleon momentum, which was tested using recoil-tagging techniques in experiments at Jefferson Lab. The results showed definitive evidence in favor of SRC.

However, the banking system in Azerbaijan is small relative to GDP and ineffective in capital allocating. An estimated $1 billion is held in cash or outside the banking sector. There are approximately 70 foreign and local banks in Azerbaijan. Of the four state- owned banks, only the International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA) was solvent in 1999. The IBA was in the process of being privatized in that year. Major commercial banks include Standard Bank, Unibank, Damirbank, AG Bank and others.  Legal Basis  Azerbaijan restored its independence on October 18, 1991. Besides the Law \\"On Banks and Banking Activity in the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù, the law \\"On the National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù was adopted on August 7, 1992. Manat - the national currency of the Republic of Azerbaijan was released on August 15 (together with ruble). Manat was declared the only means of payment in the country from date January 1, 1994. In Article 19, paragraph 2 of the first Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan adopted in the referendum on November 12, 1995, it was reaffirmed that the right to issue and withdraw money from circulation only belongs to the National Bank. The law \\"On the National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan‚Äù and \\"On Banks and Banking Activity in the Republic of Azerbaijan were re- adopted in a new edition on dates June 10, 1996, and June 14, 1996, respectively. New bank laws allowed the banking system to become closer to the world banking experience and establish credit institutions. In order to adapt to the updated scientific and theoretical methods and the requirements of modern ongoing processes, the Law \\"On the National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan\\" was adopted on December 10, 2004. The Law \\"On Banks\\" adopted on January 16, 2004, came into force on March 30, 2004. In connection with the Referendum Act named \\"On Additions and Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan\\" dated March 18, 2009, \\"National Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan\\" was renamed to \\"The Central Bank of the Republic of Azerbaijan\\". As a result of measures taken for the creation of deposit insurance mechanisms, the law \\"On Deposit Insurance\\" was adopted On December 29, 2006. Important activities are carried out in Azerbaijan to prevent legalizing criminally obtained money or other properties and financing of terrorism. In this regard, Law ‚ÄúOn the Prevention of the Legalization of Criminally Obtained Funds or Other Property and the Financing of Terrorism‚Äù came into force on date February 25, 2009.  Role of commercial banks  The initial development of the Azerbaijan banking system began in the second half of the 19th century. But institutional and legal construction of banking system of Azerbaijan began after the acquisition of state independence in 1991. According to the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan dated January 10, 1992, the International Bank of Azerbaijan was established on the basis of the former USSR Bank for Foreign Affairs‚Äô the database of the Republic of Azerbaijan. Commercial banks in Azerbaijan constitute the second step of the two-stepped bank system like other countries with market economies. Four of the independent commercial banks were based on state ownership. 51% of their charter capital or the controlling package was owned by the state. These are the following: * The Agrarian-Industrial Joint-Stock Commercial Bank of the Azerbaijan Republic * The Industrial Investment Joint Stock Commercial Bank of the Azerbaijan Republic * Deposit Commercial Bank of the Azerbaijan Republic * International Joint-Stock Commercial Bank of the Azerbaijan Republic On February 11, 1992 by the Decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, the National Bank of Azerbaijan was established on the basis of the former USSR State Bank, Industrial-Construction Bank and the Agrarian Bank‚Äôs database of the Republic of Azerbaijan and Azerbaijan Deposit Bank on the basis of Deposit Bank of the former USSR database of the Republic of Azerbaijan. From February to August 1992, the enterprises and departments of the Industrial-Construction Bank and the Agrarian Industry Bank were directly subordinated to the National Bank of Azerbaijan. After gaining independence, the national market was established. During this period, changes were made not in the structure of banks, but in credit relations. So two- stepped banking system was formed. The National bank was in the first step, commercial banks in the second one. After that, the Agrarian Industry Bank and the Industrial Investment Bank were removed from subordination of the National Bank and became Universal Universal Joint-Stock Commercial Bank. According to the relevant decision of the National Assembly, Deposit Bank and International Bank of the Azerbaijan Republic began to operate as joint-stock commercial banks. The process of transformation of the Agrarian Industry Bank, the Industrial Investment Bank, the Deposits Bank and the International Bank into the joint-stock commercial banks was completed in 1993. The rest 49% of the shares were distributed among different legal and physical persons. The National bank started to function as independent banks in the world. The first president of the National Bank was appointed after adoption of these laws. With the independence of the banking system, \\"manat\\" - the national currency of the Republic was put into circulation (1992). Strenuous political conditions and serious violations in the economy were observed during the period when the market economy-oriented banking system was set up in Azerbaijan. It put the banking system into difficult situation. As a result, organization and managing principles in the banking system were violated. In general, the banking service did not meet the requirements of socio-economic development. The banking industry was based on a weak legal base. It was managed in accordance with the requirements and principles of former legislative acts. Only a few of the numerous banking operations known in the world were being performed in the country. There were serious shortcomings and retail management situation in the Deposits Bank system. They violated the rules defined by the legislation on repayment of these deposits in time. So, the deposits of the population in Deposits Banks have become invaluable and useless stocks. The Deposits Bank lost its essence. As a result of the implemented reforms, the defects and shortcomings in the banking system's activity were eliminated and significant improvements were made in their business. * The fundamental changes in the modern banking system of the republic can be grouped as following: * Fundamental reforms implemented in the banking system increased the rights and responsibilities of state and commercial banks; * The role of banks and management functions increased in regulating money circulation; * The preference is given to establish joint banks with the ability to compete with foreign banks in the Republic; * The right was given to the National Bank to issue a free monetary policy and to issue money to the circulation. * The role of all types of banks in the organization of the securities market in the republic was increased and the German model is preferred in this direction, etc. In order to implement monetary policy, the norms of mandatory bank reserves were determined and their sources of origin were specified in the Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan \\"On National Bank\\" adopted by the National Assembly dated June 10, 1996. The law includes the establishment of mandatory reserves, determination of norms, regulation of liabilities between creditors and depositors and rules for maintaining mandatory reserves, etc. Central Bank The central bank increased the minimum required capital for commercial banks to $1.5 million in 1999, and expected to increase the figure to $3 million in 2001 (the latest year for which data was available), effectively consolidating the sector. The International Monetary Fund reports that in 2001, currency and demand deposits ‚Äî an aggregate commonly known as M1‚Äîwere equal to $363.6 million. In that same year, M2 ‚Äî an aggregate equal to M1 plus savings deposits, small time deposits, and money market mutual funds‚Äîwas $738.5 million. The discount rate, the interest rate at which the central bank lends to financial institutions in the short term, was 10%. Stock exchange The Baku Stock Exchange, known as the BSE, opened in 2001 trading short-term treasury bonds and the common stock of recently privatized state-owned enterprises. Trading volume in the first six months was just under $1 million. A regulatory framework for the new exchange is under development and is expected to conform to international transparency standards. Ratings On March 6, 2014 Fitch Ratings released an assessment of Azerbaijan‚Äôs banking sector as being \\"broadly stable,\\" although highlighted structural issues that should be addressed to improve the sector. Fitch noted that retail lending is a higher growth segment than corporate lending. Fitch also affirmed positive ratings on five different Azerbaijan banks.

The taxes levied in Azerbaijan can be generally broken down into 3 main types: state taxes, taxes of autonomy republic and local (municipal) taxes. State taxes include the following: personal income tax, corporate tax, value added tax, excise tax, property tax, land tax, road tax, mineral royalty tax and simplified tax. Taxes of autonomy republic are the same as state taxes but levied in Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic. The Tax Code of Azerbaijan Republic was approved on 11 July 2000 and consists of two parts. The General Part indicates the rights and responsibilities of taxpayers, tax agents and tax authorities, procedures of tax registration, tax control and audit. The second part, also referred to as Special Section, defines specific taxes and their bases, rates, payment schedules and procedures. There exist separate taxation procedures for Production Sharing Agreements (PSAs). From 2010, the government revenues from taxes started to rise. Thus, in 2014, tax revenues as percentage from GDP totaled 14.213%. Highest shares of tax revenues came from value added tax and corporate profit taxes in 2014. In 2015, tax revenues as percentage of GDP were equal to 15.6%. The central executive body which provides the implementation and control of tax policies in the country, collection and transfer of tax payments into the government budget is Ministry of Taxes of Azerbaijan Republic. In Azerbaijan, on January 1, 2001, a new tax code went into effect. Personal income rates remained the same, at rates ranging from 12‚Äì35%, as did the corporate tax rate, at 27%. However, as of 2005, the corporate rate was set at 24%. The revised depreciation schedule for corporate assets favors investments in high-tech equipment and oil and gas exploration. Depreciation rates are 10% a year for buildings, 25% a year for equipment and computers, 25% for geological and exploratory costs, and 20% a year for all other assets. However, accelerated depreciation is allowed for capital spending allocated for production purposes at twice the standard rates. Included in this are expenditures on the building of those facilities that are to be used in the actual manufacture of goods. The value-added tax (VAT) was reduced from 20% to 18%, while the property tax was raised from .5% to 1% of assessed value. A .05% Road Fund Tax on turnover was abolished, but there is a highway tax imposed on foreign-registered vehicles collected by customs authorities. There are payroll taxes paid by the employer amounting to 32%, 30% going to the Social Protection Fund, and 2% going to the Employment Fund. There are excise taxes, but excise paid for goods used in production can be off set against excise charged for the finished product. In 2001, total government revenue came to an estimated 21.4% of GDP, while total expenditures, including net lending, amounted to only 20% of GDP, producing a positive fiscal balance equal to 1.4% of GDP.  Tax Regime  Currently, Azerbaijan has 3 distinct tax regimes. These are the following: statutory tax regime, tax regime that relates to companies operating under Production Sharing Agreements and tax regime that relates to companies operating under Host Government Agreements. The statutory tax regime is applicable to all companies operating in Azerbaijan, except for those, who are involved into oil and gas industry. The regime related to Production Sharing Agreements covers the rules for more than twenty existing PSAs. Milli Majlis has ratified these PSAs. The rules related to Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil export and South Caucasus pipelines are covered by Host Government Agreements tax regime.  Tax Procedures  The tax year in Azerbaijan starts in January, 1st and ends in December, 31st. The tax declaration has to be filled in and submitted by enterprises no later than 31 March following the calendar year and users of simplified tax should submit the declaration no later than 20 April. Natural persons who have stayed in Azerbaijan 182 days in a calendar year are accounted as residents and are responsible for paying the taxes. Residents of Azerbaijan are taxable on their international income, whereas non-residents are taxable on the Azerbaijani source income only. Taxes can be withhold from people who are related to employment activities, as well as non- entrepreneurial activities such as interest income, dividends, capital gains and royalties. Agricultural income, gifts and inheritance from family members, capital gains, income from crafts production, lottery prizes, alimonies and compensation receipts are exempt from taxation. Standard deductions are applicable for war heroes, their families and military officials.  State Taxes   Income tax from natural persons  Income taxes in Azerbaijan are set at progressive rate. The taxable base for residents is income which has been earned in or outside of Azerbaijan. For non-residents income which is taxed are the following ‚Äì income which is both connected and not connected with employment and also all other kinds of income which are not tax-exempt or arose from revaluation of assets. Tax rate on income of natural persons receiving less than 2500 AZN is 14%, if income is more than 2500 AZN, then 25% tax is levied on the proportion which is exceeding 2500 AZN.  Profit tax from legal persons  Profit is defined as the difference between income and expenses. The profits of all resident-enterprises should be taxed. If legal person is permanently established in Azerbaijan ‚Äì then its profits should be taxed. Otherwise, it should be taxed at the source of payment without subtracting its expenses. Gains, which arise from revaluation of assets are not subject to taxation. The profits are taxed at 20% rate.  Value Added Tax  Value Added Tax (VAT) rate is 18%. All works, goods, services provided and taxable imports constitute the base for taxation. There also exists zero (0) rate VAT in the country for the issues related with financial aids, diplomacy, cargo and valuable goods.  Excise Tax  Excise taxes are indirect taxes which are included in the sales price of goods. All excise goods that are produced or imported to Azerbaijan are subject to taxation. Alcohol and all types of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, light vehicles, leisure and sports floating transports, imported platinum, gold and jewelry are subject to excise tax. There is no fixed tax rate for all types of goods, instead, there are different rates for each of the product and its amounts. For example, wine and vineyard materials are taxed at 0.1 AZN per liter.  Property Tax  Taxable base of property tax for physical persons are the value of buildings and their parts, any water and air transportation or facility. For legal enterprises it is only average annual value of fixed assets. The rates are specified based on the area where buildings are located. Thus, for Baku it is 0.4 AZN per each square meter, Gyandja, Sumgait, and Absheron regions ‚Äì 0.3 AZN, other cities and regions ‚Äì 0.2 AZN, cities and towns of regional subordination ‚Äì 0.1 AZN.  Tax on land  Residents, as well as non-residents and businesses are obliged to register for paying taxes after proving their rights to use the land, and regardless of the results of economic activities on the land itself it is mandatory to pay land tax. The tax rates differ by the purpose of use and the area where the land is located. Generally, the tax rates are higher for the big and industrial cities. Land tax rates for agricultural use is 0.06 AZN for each conventional point.  Taxes to the Road  The taxable base for this type of tax constitutes the motor vehicles which are imported to the country by non-residents and are used for transportation, as well as all motor fuels, diesel that has been either produced or imported to Azerbaijan Republic for domestic use. Taxes for motor cars are calculated depending on engine cubic capacity and period of presence, for buses ‚Äì number of seats and period of presence, for trucks ‚Äì number of axis and period of presence. Generally, these taxes may vary from US$20 to US$2800 and higher. For transportation, delivering dangerous cargo there is specific procedure of calculation.  Royalty (Mining Tax)  These taxes are paid by physical entities and enterprises which extract mineral resources from the territory of Azerbaijan Republic, including area of Caspian Sea which belongs to the country. Tax rates for crude oil is 26%, natural gas ‚Äì 20%, all types of metals ‚Äì 3%.  Simplified Tax  Simplified tax is applicable to entities, whose volume of transactions does not exceed 200.000 AZN in 12 consecutive months. Gross volume of cash flows received in respect of goods and services provided is subject to taxation. Simplified tax rate for Baku is 4%, for other regions ‚Äì 2%, for trading activities ‚Äì 6%, for public catering activity ‚Äì 8%.

The initiative aims to provide 10,000 small businesses with assistance ‚Äì ranging from business and management education and mentoring to access to capital and business support services. Goldman Sachs' CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter are the chairs of the program's advisory council. The program was launched in the face of mounting criticism over Goldman Sachs' large bonus payouts after repaying (with interest) $10 billion in TARP funds it received from the U.S. Treasury. According to the company, the small business initiative had been in development a year before the initial launch, and is modeled after its 10,000 Women Initiative, which has helped educate female entrepreneurs in 43 countries. According to a January 2013 report by Babson College, 63.7% of program participants in the United States reported an increase in revenue and 44.8% added new jobs following graduation. Program Overview Under the plan, Goldman will provide $200 million to pay for small- business owners to get business and management education at local community colleges ‚Äì the first program being at LaGuardia Community College in Queens, New York. Additionally, the program allocates $300 million in loans and grants to small businesses. As of September 2013, small business owners in all 50 states can apply to the program through an online curriculum or at one of 13 community college sites. Networking and mentoring will be offered through partnerships with national and local business organizations, as well as employees of Goldman Sachs. Additionally, in 2010 Goldman Sachs launched 10,000 Small Businesses UK which is offered in Yorkshire, the North West, the Midlands and London and its partners include Sa√Ød Business School (University of Oxford), Leeds University Business School, Manchester Metropolitan University Business School, Aston Business School and University College London (UCL). Selection criteria The plan targets companies employing at least four full-time employees and with revenue of at least $150,000 in the most recent fiscal year. Eligible companies have to have been operating for at least two years and work \\"predominantly in under served markets.\\" Partners The partner institutions and organizations include establishments in both academia and nonprofit sectors, as well as mission driven capital lenders. Social media In February 2014 the Twitter handle @GS10KSmallBiz was launched by Goldman Sachs. In December 2015 the account had over 18,000 followers. Profiles of the 10,000 Small Businesses graduates can be viewed on the Goldman Sachs YouTube playlist titled: Meet the Owners: 10,000 Small Businesses in the US.

He is a recipient of the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for lifetime achievement. Early life and training Fortier was born in Waterville, Quebec, in Canada. His career as a dancer started in 1973 with Groupe Nouvelle Aire in Montreal and trained choreographers Edouard Lock, Ginette Laurin, and Daniel L√©veill√©. Early works In 1979 Fortier created his own dance company called Danse-Th√©√¢tre Paul-Andr√© Fortier. He used this company to showcase his choreography, including Parlez-moi donc du cul de mon enfance (1979) and Violence (1980). In 1981 he won the Jean A. Chalmers National Dance Award, and in 1983 he renamed the company Fortier Danse- Cr√©ation. His next creations were Pow !‚Ä¶t‚Äôes mort (1982), √áa ne saigne jamais‚Ä¶ (1983), Chaleurs (1985), Le Mythe d√©cisif (1987) and D√©sert (1989). Gradually, Fortier's works slipped from the \\"narrative into the abstract\\" leaving \\"the way open to multiple interpretations, giving the viewer free to his feelings\\".Guylaine Massoutre - The dancer's assertion : the solos of Paul- Andr√© Fortier In 1986 Fortier and Daniel Jackson founded Montr√©al Danse to create new works by other choreographers. They featured the work of Fran√ßoise Sullivan, James Kudelka and Fortier himself. He resigned as co-artistic director in 1989 but continued to choreograph for the company. Teacher and choreographer In 1989 Fortier joined the faculty of dance at Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al. He also created dance solos for himself by reactivating his old dance company Fortier-Danse Cr√©ation. As a solo artist, he created the trilogy Les Males Heures (1989), La Tentation de la transparence (1991), and Bras de Plomb (1993), the latter two created with the collaboration of Betty Goodwin. La Tentation de la transparence received the Dora Mavor Moore Award. In addition to choreographing, Fortier was a dance consultant for the Canada Council from 1993 to 1995. He was also president of Regroupement Qu√©becois de la danse. Fortier returned to choreographing group compositions in 1996 after an eight-year absence. To celebrate the ten-year anniversary of Montr√©al Danse, he created Entre la m√©moire et l'oubli. Later that year he created La Part des anges, a quartet with himself, Peggy Baker, Robert Meiller and Gioconda Barbuto that explored the chemistry that connects and disconnects feelings between people. Solo and duet choreography In 1998 Fortier retired from the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Montr√©al to devote more time to teaching and choreographing. Later that year he created Jeux de Fous which included Dada-inspired choreography. Two years later Fortier again choreographed for Peggy Baker, this time in a solo piece called Loin, tr√®s loin (2000). He created Tensions for the 10th edition of the Festival international de nouvelle danse in 2001. Robert Meiller returned to dance in this duet with Fortier. The piece looked at the dynamics between youth and age. From 2003 to 2007, Fortier was appointed choreographer-in-residence at la Cinqui√®me Salle de la Place des Arts in Montreal. He was also a member of the Sponsorship Committee at the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Lorient (France), created during its inauguration in June 2003. In 2006, Fortier returned to solo dances with Solo 1 x 60 - Un jardin d'objets in which he performed alone for 60 minutes. Later that year he debuted Solo 30 x 30 - Trente minutes-trente jours. Hw danced in various outdoor locations for thirty minutes a day for thirty days. He brought this idea to England, Italy and Japan, always performing regardless of the weather conditions. Cabane (2008) was created and performed in collaboration with Robert Racine. It takes place in and around a modular shed. This piece toured around Canada and Europe. Later achievements In 2009, Fortier was appointed Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by France. In 2012 he received the Governor General's Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement and an appointment to the Order of Canada. In 2013, he received a Conseil des Arts et des Lettres du Qu√©bec career grant. In 2013, Fortier joined the board of directors of the Governor General's Performing Arts Awards Foundation as co-chair.

Prior arrests and convictions Allgier's criminal history began in 1998 with convictions for theft and reckless driving in South Dakota. He was charged with felony burglary, forgery and theft in Utah during October 2000, after he burglarized a neighbor's apartment and made out a stolen check to himself for $300. That month, he was also charged in another county with carrying a concealed handgun and sentenced to 180 days and probation. Allgier fled Utah in August 2001, which led to a one-to-15-year sentence. Paroled in May 2003, he was then arrested and sent back to prison in July 2004 for traveling to California without authorization, and possessing two knives. He was paroled in October 2006. In November, he became a fugitive for two days on a parole violation. Allgier, armed, barricaded himself inside a hotel room but was captured by a Salt Lake City SWAT team after falling through the ceiling where he had tried to hide. On June 14, 2007, he was sentenced to 104 months in prison for being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. Murder of Stephen Anderson On the morning of June 25, 2007, corrections officer Stephen Anderson escorted Allgier to the University of Utah, where Allgier was scheduled for an MRI, because he had been complaining of back problems. While waiting with Anderson in an examination room at the university's orthopedic center, Allgier was unshackled. He then overpowered and disarmed Anderson and shot him once in the chest and once in the head. Allgier later stated that the gun went off accidentally during the struggle. After fleeing the clinic on foot, Allgier carjacked a Ford Explorer, and led police on a high-speed chase. Allgier was captured at an Arby's restaurant a few miles away, where he tried to shoot an employee but the gun malfunctioned. Eric Fullerton, a Vietnam veteran and former Army paratrooper, confronted him and managed to take his gun away. Allgier fled to the back of the restaurant, where police found him hiding in the manager's office. Trial Allgier's murder trial was initially set for June 2012. In March 2012, the judge granted a motion postponing the trial. On October 3, 2012, Allgier unexpectedly pled guilty to murder and several other charges, and also pled no contest to three charges of attempted murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. In January 2015, Allgier lost his right to legal representation after repeatedly making frivolous objections to, and threats against, his court-appointed attorneys during his appeals of the life sentence.Romboy, Dennis (2015). Convicted killer Curtis Allgier loses right to attorney\\" KSL.com, accessed 25 Jan 2015 In November 2017, the Utah Supreme Court rejected Allgier's self-represented motions to withdraw his guilty pleas.Romero, McKenzie(2017). Utah high court denies Allgier's motion to withdraw guilty plea] KSL.com, Nov 24, 2017; accessed Nov 25, 2017 The court ruled that Allgier knew conditions of his guilty pleas and was unable to withdraw them due to missing a deadline, and furthermore that Allgier had failed to establish that his lawyers did not adequately represent him. Tattoos Allgier is noted for numerous tattoos expressing his white supremacist beliefs. The meanings of each of these tattoos are explained as: *Swastika (Hakenkreuz) (center brow, either side of the nose, earlobes, chin and front of the ears): A prevalent item used heavily within Nazi symbolism and is a commonplace tattoo on modern-day followers of White supremacy. *14 88 (temples): Refers to the Fourteen Words written by David Lane (white nationalist writer) \\"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for White Children.\\" and Heil Hitler, represented by the 88 ('H' being the eighth letter of the English alphabet). This is usually written as \\"14 88\\", \\"14/88\\" or \\"1488\\". *Crucified skinhead (right cheek): Symbolizes the supposedly persecution of working class skinheads by the upper class. *Three intersecting triangles (left jaw): Known as a valknut or volknut, symbolizes the afterlife and binding of the soul to Odin, who is considered chief among the Norse gods, among non-racist Pagans. However, among racist Pagans, it signifies \\"that one is ready to be taken into the ranks of Odin's chosen warriors.\\" *5150 (under the right eye): A likely reference to California statute 5150, which requires commitment to psychiatric hospitals for people declared to be a danger to themselves or others. *Hatebreed (upper lip): An American hardcore/metalcore band that has pointedly disavowed any racist beliefs after being incorrectly described as a white-power band by CNN in the wake of Wade Page's shooting at a Sikh temple.Face of Hate: Curtis Allgier Explained  Hatewatch  Southern Poverty Law Center *Iron Crosses (forehead temples): Military decoration used by Nazi Germany. Originally from a symbol, typically in black with a white or silver outline that originated after 1219 when the Kingdom of Jerusalem granted the Teutonic Order the right to combine the Teutonic Black Cross placed above a silver Cross of Jerusalem.Jean-Denis Lepage. Medieval armies and weapons in western Europe: an illustrated history. McFarland & Company, Inc., 2005. Pp. 193. *SS Lightning Bolts (jawbones): A symbol of the Schutzstaffel (translated to Protection Squadron or defence corps), abbreviated as SS or Runic \\"·õã·õã\\" with stylized \\"Armanen\\" sig runes). The Schutzstaffel was a major paramilitary organization under Adolf Hitler, and was a Nazi police force that administered death camps, in addition to staffing mobile killing units known as Einsatzgruppen. The Nuremberg judges declared the entire SS a criminal organization after World War II. *Property of Jolene: Refers to his wife Jolene; the couple are now divorced. *F.U.N.: stands for \\"fuck you, nigger\\" *Blood, Honor, and Loyalty (collarbone): A heavily used phrase by white supremacists as well as other neo-Nazis in clothing, lyrics, and tattoos.

Following a major earthquake in 1918, the U.S. Customs Service undertook a comprehensive program of rebuilding and new construction. The remodeling may have been under the supervision of Albert B. Nichols, architect and inspector of buildings under the Supervising Architect of the Treasury's San Juan field office. A sheet of drawings, unsigned and undated, for the remodeling are in the San Juan Custom House files, and the Puerto Rico Historic Preservation Office believes that they may be Nichols' work. Three other sheets signed by Rafael Carmoega, Chief architect of the insular government and presumed to date from August 1930, exist in the Public Building Service records.National Archives, Records of the Public Buildings Service, Record Group #121; Box #855; \\"Ponce, P.R., Custom House\\" The Ponce Custom House was designated a historic customhouse by the Secretary of the Treasury in 1972. Despite its 1924 remodeling, it remains an important example of Spanish Colonial architecture outside Old San Juan. Building Description The building is a Spanish-period building which was remodeled by the United States in 1924, with small changes since then. The two-story building has massive masonry walls and large arched entrances to a central courtyard that reflects its Spanish origins, while the false partial gables with Spanish barrel tiles are typical of the United States Spanish Revival architectural work of the 1920s. The building is situated on the waterfront facing the Caribbean Sea and next to the port of Ponce, two miles from the center of this second-largest city in Puerto Rico. The customs house fully occupies a small city block. Its principal facade faces Bonaire Street and looks toward the ocean across a grassed area containing a Coast Guard beacon. It is located in an area of traditional warehouses, commercial buildings, mostly one-story and many from the Spanish period. There is a sidewalk around the four sides of the building, with the one on Bonaire Street wider and providing three mature trees. U.S Customs House in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Passage and courtyard, looking north. The building is a simple rectangle measuring 97 feet wide x 83 feet deep. The plan is typical of Spanish construction, with interconnected rooms, around the outside perimeter that also open to a central courtyard. There is a wide arched vehicular passage leading from the front through the courtyard to the rear exit from the building. The original courtyard has been partially closed in on the first floor only on each side of the passageway to create two additional rooms. Between the front rooms and the courtyard, a fine masonry staircase rises on the left side off the central passage. The second floor repeats the first-floor layout of perimeter rooms with later modifications, but includes the full extent of the original courtyard or patio in the center. Originally there may have been a roofed courtyard gallery for circulation around the courtyard. At present, there are two short modern gallery sections bridging between the quarry-tile-paved roofs of the infilled first-floor courtyard areas. At the head of the stairs is a large public lobby that opens to the courtyard and to the front of the building. There is also a small circular iron stair to the roof from the southeast corner of the second-floor courtyard. U.S Customs House in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Main entrance, looking north. The facades are similar with regular door and window openings and with small balconies to the second-floor openings. There is a small partial false gable roof of Spanish barrel red-clay tiles around the four sides and around the courtyard. On the front (south) facade, facing the ocean, there are five bays with a large elliptical arch-headed passageway large enough for vehicular traffic. It is architecturally marked only by a plain, flat frame painted differently from the body of the building. There are plain board, double doors with a smaller pedestrian port in the right door. In the elliptical arch there is a simple fanlight window. Flanking the arched entrance are two large high windows on each side. The windows are two-leaf casements with exterior solid and Jouvered combination paneled shutters. Metal grilles are at each window. The walls have a simple low projecting base course, and the first floor walls are marked by horizontal incised coursing, all in stucco. There is a large molded string course between stories and on the second floor, five door openings, each with double-leaf doors that are half sash, which replaced the original louvered and paneled shutter combinations. Over the doors are sashed transoms, although the right group has been replaced by air conditioners. Each opening has a decorative wrought iron balcony with scroll support dating from the U.S. remodeling of the building. Previous to these wrought-iron balconies, the building had cast iron railings. \\"U.S. Customs\\" is lettered over the central window. At the top is a large double masonry molded cornice, surmounted by the small false partial gable in Spanish tiles, both from 1924. On the front only, there are three flag poles on the roof, and a large antenna system. On each side of the first floor passage entry is an alarm box and a plain light fixture. The rear facade is identical to the front, except that the right first-floor opening is a plain board door rather than a window and that some of the second-floor doors still retain their original louvered and paneled shutter systems and have not had glass inserted. The side facades are similar to the front and rear, except for the absence of the arched passageway. Both sides are in five bays, all windows, on the first floor, with the exception of a door on the east side. The second-floor openings and balconies match the front with air conditioners generally mounted in the transoms. On the west side one second-floor door has a modern boxed-out bar grille around it. Construction of the original 1841-42 building is in traditional heavy masonry walls two feet thick. The ceilings are high: 15' on the first floor, 14' on the second. There are several large structural arch openings in the interior masonry walls. The exposed floor joists are heavy 4x10 beaded edge ausubo wood members laid 24\\" on center. These old joists support modern concrete slab second floor laid over wire mesh and composition board forms laid during the 20th century remodeling. Also added at this point was reinforced concrete framing adjoining the old walls on the first floor. It is now in deteriorated condition, while the original walls appear generally sound. In the interior, the central passage extends from front to rear through the open courtyard, paved in quarry tiles. On the left side at the front of the building, are two Immigration and Naturalization Service offices. On the right front are two U.S. Department of Agriculture offices. Behind the offices on the left side of the passage is a fine enclosed stair with two runs and a landing. The remaining first-floor rooms are storage rooms and a shop with concrete floors, several 8' wide masonry openings with slat fanlights (sol truncos). Storage room windows are solid vertical board shutters without sash and with outside metal grilles. Two rooms flanking the passage in the center fill in an original part of the courtyard in a manner similar to the older construction. U.S Customs House in Ponce, Puerto Rico. Second floor stair hall and stair arcade, looking northwest. On the second floor, the staircase from the entry passage opens on a large lobby from a two-arched staircase arcade. The lobby extends from the front back to the courtyard and is floored with diagonally laid gray and white marble tiles. The walls, as are old walls in the building, are plastered, and the ceiling has exposed 4x10 beaded ausubo wood beams. Old double four-paneled doors and a transom open to the courtyard. The window in the stairhall has been filled in with glass brick. U.S Customs House in Ponce, Puerto Rico. First floor, east side, store room, looking southwest. The offices on the second floor generally have been modernized with acoustical tile ceilings, fluorescent fixtures and vinyl floors. The old exterior doors remain, generally with glass replacing the shuttered sections, except for several windows on the rear lavatories and kitchen. Air conditioners are mounted in the transoms over the doors. On the southeast corner is a large inspector's office, with a counter for public business. Some old masonry partitions had been removed or altered to create this space. Along the east side, small rooms have been partitioned off and in the rear northeast corner is the large Port Director's office, in its original configuration. Across the north rear are a men's lavatory, a women's lavatory and a kitchen, all with black and white floor tiles. The kitchen appears to be original to the building and has traces of the original masonry cooking stove and flue. The left rear north corner room now used for training is also floored in old black and white tiles. In the San Juan customs house files, there is one large sheet of remodeling plans for the Ponce Customs house, possibly by Albert B. Nichols, although not signed. In 1985 Customs Service commissioned a set of fifteen measured drawings by architect Rene Acosta, Hato Rey, P. R. which are reproduced in a report by the architect on the rehabilitation needs of the Ponce Custom House. (Feasibility Study for the Rehabilitation of the U.S. Ponce Custom House, Ponce, P. R.) Significance This United States Custom House in Ponce is the oldest extant customhouse in Puerto Rico. Built in 1841-42, the adobe building of the Spanish era was remodeled by the United States in 1924. It is historically and architecturally significant for its antiquity and its importance in the Spanish period of customs administration in Puerto Rico, as it is the only one of its type among U.S. Customs Service properties. It is also significant for the role it played in the transitional phase of the American customs service in Puerto Rico, from 1898 to 1930. This period is bracketed at one end by the cession on 10 December 1898 of the island of Puerto Rico to the United States by Spain and on the other end by the completion in 1930 of the major building and rehabilitation program undertaken by the U.S. Customs Service following World War I. The Ponce Custom House is an important example of the Spanish-Colonial architecture outside of Old San Juan.

History  Agriculture has been declining as a proportion of The Bahamas economy since its apogee. The sector was strongly affected by the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act in 1930, implemented in the United States as a protectionist solution, which has resulted in Bahamian agricultural products (mainly pineapple, tomato and citrus) being outsourced to United States territories. For example, the United States increased its production of pineapples as a response to the increase in the cost of importing them.  Current  Today farming and agro-industrial production are carried out on relatively minute acreages on nearly all islands, and are of a relatively subsistence nature. About 1% of the land area is cultivated.  Main agricultural products  Major crops include onions, okra, and tomatoes, the last two raised mainly for export. An estimated 80% of the Bahamian food supply is imported. Export-oriented orange, grapefruit, and cucumber production occurs on Abaco. Agricultural products in 2004 included 55,500 tons of sugar cane, 13,000 tons of grapefruit, 8,700 tons of lemons and limes, 5,000 tons of tomatoes, and 880 tons of sweet potatoes.  Government initiatives  Among steps the government has taken to expand and improve agriculture is the reserving of exclusively for farming, of which were converted to fruit farming. The government also launched an Agricultural and Marine Sciences Institute on the island of Andros, to promote the study in agronomic, agro-industrial and subsistence fields. To date there has been little success in buttressing the agricultural production, which is expected to be a very gradual process.

After a year of successful operation, the City of Sturgis provided the museum with a new facility at Main Street and Junction Avenue. The historical building had served as the community's post office for over 60 years. The Motorcycle Museum offers informative and comprehensive exhibits, showcasing nearly 100 unique and historic motorcycles that date back to 1905. The museum's Hall of Fame recognizes individuals or groups who have made a long term positive contribution to the motorcycle community. The Hall of Fame honors individuals who have contributed to the sport and the lifestyle.

The word derives from two Greek words: taxis, meaning order, preparation, and arrangement and derma, meaning skin. Directly translated, taxidermy means \\"skin art\\". According to John W. Moyer, a staff member at the Chicago Field Museum of Natural History famous for his comprehensive studies on the development of this process, in his book Practical Taxidermy, the modern form of taxidermy greatly differs from the taxidermy of antiquity. In ancient times, although considered some form of \\"art\\", it was a process of animal preservation; in contrast, modern taxidermy methods seek to produce lifelike mounts of wildlife by accurately modeling the anatomy of animal specimens as they might appear in their natural habitat. According to Albert B. Farnham, in his book Home Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit, although its methods greatly differ over time, the art reveals that there existed then as now the desire to preserve the trophy of the hunter's prowess and skill in natural objects Early forms of taxidermy Ancient Egyptians As documented in Frederick H. Hitchcock's 19th-century manual entitled Practical Taxidermy, the earliest known taxidermists were the ancient Egyptians and despite the fact that they never removed skins from animals as a whole, it was the Egyptians who developed one of the world's earliest forms of animal preservation through the use of injections, spices, oils, and other embalming tools. As early as 2200 BC, they embalmed the bodies of dogs, cats, monkeys, birds, sheep, oxen, and any other pets of Egyptian royalty and buried them in their Pharaoh's tomb. This art of embalming was effective, not for the purpose of having the specimens look natural or for exhibition, but to satisfy the tradition of the times. Likewise, according to Thomas Brown, a 19th- century naturalist and malacologist, \\"Egyptian preservation attempts were prepared in such a manner as to produce no pleasurable sensations in examining them; instead, they were remarkable only for their great antiquity and spiritual beliefs\\". Though these people did not seek to preserve animals for modeling their anatomy as they might appear in a natural setting, the ancient Egyptians‚Äô ability to preserve the carcasses of animals as immense as the hippopotamus (a mummy of which was discovered in Thebes) reflect the veracity of these early textual claims to the art's earliest roots. Carthaginian Empire Other instances of ancient roots in taxidermy date as far back as five centuries B.C. in the record of the African explorations of Hanno the Carthaginian. Within the past five centuries, an account is given of the discovery of what were evidently gorillas and the subsequent preservation of their skins, which were hung in the temple of Astarte where they remained until the taking of Carthage in the year 146 B.C. Western/Central Europe The people of Greece, Rome, ancient Britain, and other northern lands could be said to have practiced a form of taxidermy in the tanning of skins used for clothing. Because they had no other means of covering their bodies, early Europeans developed methods of preserving the skins of lions, tigers, wolves, and bears for survival. Native Americans Much like the people of Greece, Rome, and northern Europe, many Native American tribes such as the Sioux, Cherokee, Pottawatomie, and Cheyenne preserved the skins of foxes, raccoons, bears, buffalo, porcupines, and eagles to produce and decorate their clothing, tools, and equipment. To this day, remnants of such Native American tribes continue this early form of taxidermy in tanning and preserving animal carcasses for traditional and cultural purposes. Early European developments in modern taxidermy Nearly a millennium after the fall of Rome in 476 AD, Western European societies transcended the Dark Ages and transformed into powerful, centralized nations through the Renaissance and Scientific Revolution; as these countries were formed, advances in technology and overall living conditions decreased the need for hide tanning ‚Äì taxidermy in one of its earliest forms. Instead, Western Europe witnessed the rise in modern taxidermy, or the modeling the anatomy of various animals in their natural habitats. As taxidermy developed into its modern form, its growth in popularity paralleled the growth of modern naturalistic exhibition. Birds in the Netherlands About 400 years ago, the first mounting attempt on record included the preservation of birds in the Netherlands. As reported, a wealthy Dutch trader obtained an aviary of exotic birds that were brought back from the East Indies. Due to the neglect of the bird keeper, every bird died of suffocation; but as the owner wished to keep their skins and plumage for display, they were skinned and preserved with spices brought to Holland, also from the East Indies. The skins were then wired and stuffed with cotton and tow and were ultimately posed in natural positions. Rhinoceros in Florence Though the preservation of bird skins from the East Indies is the first officially recorded mounting attempt, the Royal Museum of Vertebrates, located in Florence, Italy, poses a mounted rhinoceros believed to date back as early as 1500. Though the exact method of preservation of the animal's skin is unknown, it is believed that the skull and leg bones were used to set up the animal's frame on a wood armature and were then stuffed. Crocodile in Switzerland Another specimen that was prepared during the birth of modern taxidermy is a mounted crocodile 10 to 12 feet long from Egypt that has been on exhibit at the Museum at St. Gall in Switzerland since 1627. Like the rhinoceros, the exact methods of how the crocodile was mounted are unknown. However, the specimen has never been kept under glass, which reveals the success of modern taxidermy, even in its earliest years. Developments in 18th- and 19th-century Europe Royal Academy of Vienna One of the first published works on taxidermy is found in Natural History, published by the Royal Academy of Vienna in the beginning of the 18th-century. Containing a treatise on the dissection of birds and animals, the work also makes reference to the preservation of birds in the Netherlands more than a century before. R. A. F. de Reaumur According to John W. Moyer in another one of his works for Encyclopedia Americana, one of the earliest published works on taxidermy is R. A. F. de Reaumur's Treatise, which was published in 1749. In this work, Reaumur discussed the preservation of skins of birds; however, because his plan was simply mounting birds with wires ‚Äì as had been done over two centuries before ‚Äì his method did not find much favor among other taxidermists. Instead, it spurred the development of a new system of preservation in which one cut the skins longitudinally into halves, filled one half with plaster, fixing the skin to a backboard, inserting an eye, painting on a beak and legs, and then mounting the bird in a framework of glass. For the next several decades, this process became the standard method of European taxidermists. British Museum After rising to prominence in 1759, the British Museum, which, was then known as the Montagu House, contained the world's largest collection of animal skins in the 18th- and early 19th- century, displaying a total of 1886 mammals, 1172 birds, 521 reptiles, and 1555 fishes; however, a great proportion of these were not stuffed specimens, but simply bones and preparations of skins. Soon after the Museum's opening, these natural history collections drew a great deal of interest from the public, thus demonstrating the rise in popularity of the art into the 1800s. Following the regaining of its independence from Napoleon and the restoration of peace in Europe, Great Britain witnessed continued growth in the Museum's status as naturalists and taxidermists found that the public had then time and the inclination to devote themselves to such collections. Perhaps the most notable event that provided an impetus to a more accurate, realistic modeling of specimens in their natural settings was the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. Displaying a plethora of exhibits from all around the world in various forms, it was the first time in history where taxidermists from across the world gathered together and presented modern, innovative methods pertaining to the art. Rowland Ward studio In the late 1800s, British taxidermists established the Rowland Ward studio was established in London; the individuals who worked there are credited with many improved methods in taxidermy. It was at Ward's that the Lion and Tiger struggle (despite its unnatural display of history) was designed and mounted, then considered the finest animal exhibit of ancient or modern times. This display was initially moved to an exhibit in Paris, but was soon returned to the Sydenham Crystal Palace in London. Jules Verieaux Following the creation of the Lion and Tiger exhibit, a prominent French taxidermist named Jules Verieaux mounted another animal group, though different in design. Entitled The Courier, the display depicted the figure of an Arab man (presumably formed from some type of wax) seated upon a stuffed camel being attacked by two lions. This spectacle was first exhibited at the Paris Fair of 1867 and was later purchased by the American Museum of Natural History. Like the Lion and Tiger display, Verieaux's work ‚Äì along with those of other European taxidermists such as Edwin Ward ‚Äì demonstrated the development of taxidermy into its modern form as its artists paid a greater deal of attention to animals‚Äô anatomical movements and features. Influence of Victorian society Although the French and Germans progressed in the practice of taxidermy prior to the Great Exhibition of 1851 in London, the English made several improvements in methodology and skill in the years that followed. Much of this can be attributed to the culture of Victorian Society. According to Paul Farber, a researcher at the University of Chicago, in his book The Development of Taxidermy and the History of Ornithology, the art of taxidermy was first brought into popular regard by the Victorians, who were enthralled by all tokens of exotic travel, especially to any domesticated representations of wilderness. Whether it was having a glassed-in miniature rain forest on the tea table or a mounted antelope by the front door, members of the elite class relished the art as a manifestation of one's knowledge, wealth, and artistry. As Victorian English society reached its pinnacle near the end of the 19th-century, technique and methodology of the art progressed; however, compared to modern standards, poses were still fairly stiff and expressionless. Developments in United States: 19th-century to present John Scudder One of the pioneers in early American taxidermy, a man named John Scudder succeeded to the proprietorship of Gardner Baker's American Museum, which had been founded in New York in 1791 by the Tammany Society. The museum was later acquired by P. T. Barnum and was soon reestablished as Barnum's American Museum in 1842. Scudder's successor, Titian Peale, who was appointed assistant manager of the Philadelphia Museum in 1821, also made important contributions to early taxidermy exhibits. Though Scudder and Peale did not contribute any known innovations in the art's technique or methodology, their museum work in New York and Philadelphia paved the way for the development of modern American taxidermy in the decades that followed. Ward's Natural Science Museum Though taxidermy's early roots developed in Africa and Western Europe, modern-day taxidermy began in the United States in 1861 when Henry Augustus Ward's Natural Science Establishment was founded in Rochester, New York. Modern-day taxidermists often give credit to this establishment for placing taxidermy on a level with other allied arts and beginning a new era in museum exhibitions. Many later taxidermists, whose work was among the most advanced exhibited, could credit their careers to Ward's Establishment, and many present museums have display collections built around these early Ward specimens. It was at Ward's that the Society of American Taxidermists was founded on March 24, 1880. This society, the first of its kind in the United States, published scholarly reports and held three competitive exhibitions: the first in Rochester on December 14‚Äì18, 1880; the second in Boston on December 14‚Äì21, 1881; and the third in New York City on April 30-May 5, 1883. Terminated after the last exhibit in 1883, \\"the society in three years had done more for taxidermy and the natural history museum in general in the United States than had ever previously been accomplished\\". Founded by America's most skilled taxidermists of the day, the Society presented to the public modern methods and techniques, which were freely discussed and served to bring about a higher standard of commercial work and museum exhibits. It was during this time in which the \\"stuffing\\" of animals transformed into a purely elaborate art form. In addition, this institution generated many famous taxidermists and naturalists such as William T. Hornaday, Frederic S. Webster, John Martens, Carl E. Akeley, Joseph Palmer, William J. Critchley, Thomas W. Fraine, and J.F.D. Bailey. Carl E. Akeley By the early part of the twentieth century, following the termination of Ward's Society of American Taxidermists, individuals such as Akeley, Hornaday, and Leon Pray had refined techniques and begun emphasizing artistry. Akeley, specifically, is responsible for devising a method of mounting that is now standard. In this process, \\"the true contours of the specimen are preserved by making a clay model, exactly duplicating the animal's muscle structure, over an armature that includes the original skeleton or parts of it. A plaster mold is then made, from which is produced a light, durable frame that holds the skin in position. Synthetic materials, especially celluloid, are now often used to reproduce the true color and translucence of such specimens as reptiles and fishes.\\" However, as the techniques of taxidermy became more realistic, the more mounted displays discomfited viewers; instead of expressionless moose heads mounted onto a wall of a building, artists began mounting specimens such as bobcats pouncing in midair. Therefore, as a result, for the next several decades, taxidermy existed in the margins ‚Äì practitioners were located sporadically throughout the United States, often self-taught, and usually known only by word of mouth. A 20th-century revival After years of disorganization and scattered existence, American taxidermy witnessed a sudden rebirth in the early 1970s. Taxidermy schools opened, igniting hopes of success in prospective artists. In 1971, for instance, the National Taxidermy Association was formed after years of unsuccessful organization. Similarly, in 1974, a trade magazine called Taxidermy Review began sponsoring national competitions. For the first time in history, American taxidermists had a chance to collaborate and discuss specific processes in the taxidermy process such as gluing tongues into jaw sets or accurately measuring the carcass of a squirrel. The majority of such techniques are still used in taxidermy shops today, allowing practitioners to prepare specimens as realistically as possible. Taxidermy and American social life American culture reflects its preoccupation with taxidermy in a variety of ways. Various words and phrases used in everyday life are derived from the vocabulary of taxidermy‚Äîthe threat to \\"beat the 'stuffing' out of someone\\" or derogatorily referring to someone as a \\"stuffed shirt,\\" meaning that they are fake or artificially pompous. It has also manifested itself in popular television shows such as in the Scrubs episode where the doctors encounter a dead dog and in The Office where Dwight offers to have his taxidermist stuff Angela's deceased cat. Taxidermy has also been institutionalized as an American folk craft. At one time, it was listed in the Boy Scouts of America Handbook as one of the skills which, when mastered, could earn a merit badge. The Merit Badge of Taxidermy was first introduced in 1911 and included in the Handbook through 1954, during which 10,344 scouts earned the badge. In 1954, the taxidermy badge was dropped from the merit badge series because of the \\"lack of interest.\\" Many Americans have acquired their expertise in taxidermy via mail-order lessons and commenced their artistic career with the carcass of a sparrow or squirrel. Many prominent Americans, such as the noted painter Charles Wilson Peale and the famous military leader George Armstrong Custer, were enthusiastic taxidermists. The art has enjoyed a pervasive integration into the fabric of American social life as practitioners are found in practically every small town in America. Specimens are widely employed in home and store decorations, for business advertising, for sporting trophies, and perhaps, most importantly, reifying the notion that humans can symbolically \\"restore\\" life to dead animals ‚Äî thereby, in a sense, demonstrating our perceived human power over death. Faux Taxidermy Faux Taxidermy has been a modern phenomenon in home decor and decorating since the 2010s. In 2013, the Huffington post noted that decorating with sculpted fake animal heads painted in different colors had become a popular trend in interior design. References Sources * Barrow, Mark V.

The match took place at Croke Park, Dublin, on 7 September 1980, between 1979 runners-up Galway and 1973 winners Limerick, and it was refereed by Noel O'Donoghue from Dublin. Background The All-Ireland final was only the second ever meeting of Galway and Limerick in a championship decider. Galway triumphed on that occasion to claim their second All-Ireland title. Limerick were lining out in their fourteenth All-Ireland final and were seeking their eight title, their first since defeating Kilkenny in 1973. Galway were appearing in their eleventh All-Ireland decider and their second in succession since losing to Kilkenny in 1979. Pre-match Referee Dublin-based referee Noel O'Donoghue was named as the referee for the 1980 All-Ireland final. Although a talented rugby union player at schools' level, O'Donoghue was also a founder-member of the St. Begnet's club in Dalkey. This was the first All-Ireland senior final for the 40-year-old referee. O'Donoghue's other experience includes the All-Ireland minor final of 1979, Railway Cup finals, provincial finals, county finals and National Hurling League finals. He was also very active in administrative affairs as secretary of the Dublin referees committee. Broadcasting The All-Ireland final was broadcast in Ireland on RT√â 1 with Miche√°l √ì Muircheartaigh and Michael O'Hehir providing the commentary. The programme ran from 1.20pm until 5.00pm and included basic coverage of both the All-Ireland minor and senior finals. An hour of highlights of the games were shown on The Sunday Game on the same channel at 9.15pm. Match First half The match began at a quick pace. After just two-and-a-half minutes the ball broke loose about 25 yards out from the Limerick goal. Bernie Forde collected and went on a solo-run before kicking the ball past Tommy Quaid and into the Limerick net for the first goal of the day. Five minutes later Joe Connolly was fouled just outside the 21-yard line. He pointed from the resultant free to give Galway a four-point lead. It was all Galway at this early stage as Michael Connolly sent in a good cross to the far post from the Hogan Stand side where it was collected by an unchallenged P. J. Molloy. He made no mistake in sending the ball into the net to put Galway 2-1 to no score up. Limerick's response was immediate. A high lob towards the left of the square saw √âamonn Cregan get in a neat overhead strike to send the ball into the net for his sides' first goal of the game. Two minutes later Cregan added a point from a free to put Limerick back on track. Cregan was a one-man show at this stage. A minute later a great ball out of defence by Mossie Carroll found Cregan down on the left wing. A cheeky dummy fooled full-back Conor Hayes before Cregan popped over a point from 45 yards. Galway responded with a succession of neat points. John Connolly and Noel Lane all got their names on the score sheet. Cregan stepped up again to respond for Limerick with a point from 55 yards. Joe Connolly negated this point almost immediately. His brother John then got one of the scores of the day when he pointed from 50 yards out on the touch line. Brian Carroll, who had just entered the play, then popped up to become Limerick's second scorer with a point. Both sides exchanged points in the final minute, courtesy of Cregan and Lane. At half-time the score read Galway 2-7, Limerick 1-5.

When a client comes to him with a letter from her nephew saying the well is a scam Powell becomes concerned and confronts his 3 bosses Carlton, Richards, and Burns. Feeling he is not getting straight answers he decides to fly immediately to Miami to investigate the wells. Worried Powell might find out the truth that Carlton, Richards and Burns used the investors money to play the stock market, Carlton commits suicide by shooting himself after recording a confession on his Dictaphone. Wanting the $100,000 life insurance Richards and Burns hire Tony Maroc and his gang to set up Carlton's body in Powell's apartment to make it look as if he's been murdered. Powell gets arrested as soon as his plane lands and is tried and found guilty of murder. While being moved to the penitentiary to await execution Powell escapes when the kleptomaniac Gabby, a member of Sparks gang, whom he is handcuffed to breaks out. Powell goes to Burns apartment and threatens him and Richards with a gun. Powell's brother Reverend Curtis (Lloyd Hughes) shows up and together they flee the police and head to Sparks headquarters; a boxing gym. The Police show up and to avoid suspicion Curtis poses as a boxer and knocks out the champion, Roundhouse. His jaw now broken Roundhouse can no longer participate in the upcoming boxing match which Sparks (John Wray) has bet Tony $4000 on. Sparks tells Curtis he is to take Roundhouses place. If he loses Sparks turns Frank over to the police. However, if he wins Sparks will pay Curtis $500. Hiding out at the boxing gym Curtis goes into training.

Worthing, a seaside town in the English county of West Sussex which has had borough status since 1890, has a wide range of public services funded by national government, West Sussex County Council, Worthing Borough Council and other public-sector bodies. Revenue to fund these services comes principally from Council Tax. Police and courts Centenary House is the headquarters of the West Downs division of Sussex Police. Worthing Law Courts were built in 1967. Worthing fire station was built in 1962. The Lyndhurst Road site of Worthing Hospital dates back to 1881. Home Office policing in Worthing is provided by the Worthing district of the West Downs division of Sussex Police. The district is divided into three neighbourhood policing teams‚ÄîTown, East and West‚Äîfor operational purposes. The police station is now in Chatsworth Road, but several town-centre sites have been occupied in the past. The first station was at 7 Ann Street; it moved to number 17 and then, in 1922, to 16 High Street. A new building was provided in Union Place in 1939. After the move to Chatsworth Road, C.G. Stillman's brick structure fell into disuse, and in April 2009 permission was given to demolish it; this happened in October 2009. When the town was incorporated, a combination of beadles, coastguard officers and headboroughs kept order. By the 1840s, a five-strong police force led by a Superintendent was in place; this became part of the newly formed West Sussex Police Force in 1857. The first police station, at 7 Ann Street, opened the following year. There is also a 19-cell custody suite at Centenary House in Durrington, which is the headquarters of the West Downs division. As of the third quarter of 2009, Worthing's three-month moving average crime rate was 7.3 crimes per 1000 people; this was similar to the rest of Sussex but higher than the equivalent quarter in 2008. A magistrates' court was established at the town hall in 1835. Twelve years later, county court status was granted. When the new town hall was built in the 1930s, the arrangement continued, but a new courtroom was provided at the police station in 1940. The present Law Courts building on Christchurch Road dates from 1967 and was designed by a team including Frank Morris. Fire protection Worthing's first fire engine was bought for the town by a resident in 1815. A 29-man volunteer fire brigade was formed in 1855; by 1869 it operated three fire stations. The borough organised its own fire brigade in 1891. A new fire station was built on High Street in 1908; it closed in 1961, and the present building on Ardsheal Road in Broadwater was provided in 1962. Services are now provided by the Worthing and Adur District Team, part of the West Sussex Fire and Rescue Service, which employs 60 full-time and 18 retained firefighters at the Worthing station. Hospitals The town's first hospital was built in 1829 on Ann Street. A larger building opened in 1846 on Chapel Road, and was given the name \\"Worthing Infirmary and Dispensary\\" after an enlargement in 1860. In 1881, the first part of what would become Worthing Hospital was opened: an 18-bed facility was built on a former plant nursery on Lyndhurst Road, northeast of the town centre. Its range of facilities was extended in 1889, 1900, 1912 and 1923, and there were 78 beds by 1937. In 1975, a 375-bed block was added, and the oldest buildings were replaced in 1997 by a new ward of 120 beds. The latter extension was undertaken by the Worthing and Southlands Hospitals NHS Trust, but since 1 April 2009 Worthing Hospital has been administered by the Western Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust. Meadowfield Hospital, formerly Swandean Hospital, is a mental health unit based in an 1865 house in High Salvington. It was opened as an isolation hospital in 1897 and later became a geriatric unit. There is another mental health unit at Greenacres, near Worthing Hospital. Goring Hall Hospital is a private hospital operated by BMI Healthcare, with 12 day-care beds and a 38-bed ward. Princess Margaret opened the facility in 1994. The former Courtlands Hospital, opened in 1951 as postoperative care unit operated by Worthing Hospital, was housed in a Grade II listed building in West Worthing until its closure in 1973. It was still used for healthcare functions by West Sussex County Council until 1996. Post and telephones Until 1798, post bound for Worthing was conveyed by coach to Steyning and left there for collection. From then, deliveries operated via Shoreham-by-Sea, but in 1807 Worthing's first post office opened and it became a post town. The main post office‚Äîa Head Post Office between 1919 and 1985‚Äî has occupied eight different sites, but it moved to Chapel Road in 1878 and was rebuilt in Neo-Georgian style in 1930. Public telegraph services began in 1880, although the railway had a system in place from 1859. Worthing's telephone system began in 1890; a manual telephone exchange, once the largest in England, was established in 1912 and was supplemented by a second in Goring-by-Sea in 1929. Automatic exchanges opened in 1966 and 1972. Gas and electricity This gasholder stands at Lyndhurst Road. The town was provided with a gasworks in 1834. Situated on Lyndhurst Road, it produced gas for the whole town, Sompting and Findon by the end of the 19th century. Gas manufacture ceased in 1931, but the site was then used for storage: a gasholder was built in 1934 and used continuously until 2009, and was demolished in 2018.https://www.worthingherald.co.uk/news/site-of-worthing-s- iconic-gasometer-earmarked-for-development-as-demolition-nears- completion-1-8635939 Scotia Gas Networks now supply the town through their Southern Gas Networks division. Electricity was first generated in Worthing in 1901, when the borough spent ¬£32,500 (¬£ as of ) on three steam-powered generators. Surrounding suburbs, beginning with Durrington, were connected in the 1920s, and Worthing was served by the National Grid from 1930. The main electricity works on the High Street closed in 1958, but power was generated locally until 1961. The town had more than 500 gas lamps at the end of the 19th century, but in 1901, 110 ornate cast iron arc-light street lamps were installed; only one survives. It was saved from demolition in 1975 and is Grade II-listed. As of , the electricity distribution network operator covering Worthing is UK Power Networks. Water supply Worthing relied on springs and wells for water until the Local Board (predecessors of the present Borough Council) authorised a water supply system in 1852. A waterworks was built in 1857 on Little High Street. Robert Rawlinson's Lombardo-Gothic structure cost ¬£30,000 (¬£ as of ), with a tower and a storage tank, opened in 1857. It went out of use by 1897 and was demolished in 1924. A larger waterworks opened in 1897, and three more supplied the borough by 1927. Southern Water took over the supply in 1974. The company moved its headquarters to Durrington in 1989. Worthing's drinking water is pumped from the chalk aquifer of the South Downs and from the western River Rother, and is classed as being hard: its calcium content is just over 100 mg per litre.Based on entering the postcode BN11 1HA (Worthing Town Hall) on this webpage and selecting \\"Drinking water quality\\". Drainage and sewerage Worthing's typhoid epidemic of 1893, which killed 188 people, was caused by pollution of the water supply after the digging of an extra well to alleviate pressure on the waterworks interfered with an old sewer. This prompted improvements in the town's primitive sewage disposal system, which consisted of a main sewer with an outfall in the English Channel, some subsidiary drains and hundreds of cesspools. In 1894, a new pumping station and outfall were built; this was improved in 1912 and 1932. Durrington and Goring were served by a separate system from 1936. The main sewage works at West Worthing and East Worthing were rebuilt in the 1960s and 1976 respectively. Southern Water has been responsible for all sewage and drainage functions since 1974. Cemeteries Giles Gilbert Scott designed the gatehouse and chapel of the cemetery at the bottom of Findon Valley. Worthing's main cemeteries are on South Farm Road in Broadwater (opened in 1862) and the bottom of Findon Valley (opened in 1927 on a site). The latter's gatehouse and chapel were designed by Giles Gilbert Scott. Several churches have their own small graveyards, and one existed next to Worthing railway station until about 1908, when its graves were moved to Broadwater. Worthing Crematorium, north of Findon in the neighbouring district of Arun, was opened in 1967‚Äì68 on the site of Muntham Court, a mid-18th century Jacobean-style country house which was demolished in 1961.

Retrieved 19 November 2009.  Overview  Released during a period of close association between Sharp and Nintendo, the Famicom Titler followed the C1 NES TV and the Twin Famicom as the third of what would eventually be four products in the Sharp's Nintendo Console family of products. The Famicom Titler was the most technologically ambitious project that Sharp had attempted with the Famicom system. It was the only commercially available Famicom to internally generate RGB video, and this has been identified as responsible for markedly improved clarity of image over other Famicom models. It is the only Famicom console to employ S-Video output. It also features a keyboard and pressure-sensitive touchpadGoulter, Tom. The History of Console Redesigns: NES. GamesRadar. Pg.2. 3 December 2012. that enables users to produce subtitles directly on the screen during gameplay, and to thereby create demos. Technical specifications In order to create to S-video output, Nintendo's RP2C02 PPU was replaced by an RGB-output-compatible \\"RC2C05-99\\" PPU. Here, RGB video signals generated within the composite outputs were converted to the external S-video signals. At the rear of the Titler's body, RCA composite-pin video outputs and mono audio outputs were located, and peripheral devices could connect only when the video and audio outputs to the associated TV also employed RF connectors and S-Video. This allowed gamers to enjoy a crisper image. Video editing, subtitling, and demos With the flip of a switch, the Famicom Titler could be used to produce intertitles or subtitles for video footage. According to the system manual, the resulting demos were intended to allow the addition of narration in the form of subtitles to create video invitations to parties, holiday events, children's athletic events, weddings, birthdays, and other celebrations. Character input was made upon a small touch-sensitive tablet mounted into the console. A stylus was included as attached to the body, and audio additions to the demo could be made using the included microphone. Flipping the switch back would superimpose the video and subtitles on the console. Reception Although relatively obscure at the time of its release, the console has recently seen increased interest from fans, hackers/modders, and collectors on the secondary market. Apart from historical interest in the system, several features unique to the Famicom Titler make it a popular system for modification and use. The clarity that comes from internal RGB video generation is a prized feature shared only with the considerably rarer PlayChoice-10 system created by Nintendo as an arcade system for store displays and in video arcades. Since the PlayChoice-10 was not released commercially, the Famicom Titler has recently been recognized as an easier way to get a system with the same clarity for a cheaper price. In addition, the fact that the Famicom Titler is the only system to feature S-Video output has meant that the system enjoys compatibility with setups that allow only this form of component video.

Before the outbreak of World War II, a shelter was buried in the back yard, and the building itself was prepared as a base for illegal operations. In the first years of the war, it hid illegals. and for some time was used by the Yugoslav Partisans (NOVJ). In 1943, after Vladislav and his wife Jara departed with the Partisans, the house was confiscated and occupied by German officers. After Yugoslavia was liberated at the end of World War II, the Germans left the house empty and vandalized. Ribnikar gave the house to the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to form a museum. The Republic of Serbia declared the building a Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance in 1979, granting it protected status. In 2003, the museum was closed, and the property was returned to the Ribnikar family.Secret seals removed Also, in the same year, Ribnikar Fond decided to use old Museum building, and open new museum, called \\"Museum of Politika and Serbian press\\".Fond Ribnikar Beograd, kuƒáa Ribnikara kao multimedijalni centar Notable residents * Edvard Kardelj * Vladimir Dedijer * Ivo Lola Ribar * Josip Broz Tito, lived on the first floor See also * Monument of Culture of Exceptional Importance References External links 1941 in Yugoslavia 1941 in politics 1950 establishments in Serbia 2003 disestablishments in Serbia Museums established in 1950 Museums disestablished in 2003 Museums in Belgrade History museums in Serbia Cultural Monuments of Exceptional Importance (Serbia) Savski Venac ","title":"Museum of 4 July"},{"id":"25138518","text":"Westmount Subdivision is a neighbourhood in Halifax Regional Municipality.

It was listed as a Michigan Historic Site on October 29, 1971 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 18, 1972. History The house was built in 1846 by Jacques Godfroy, who acquired the land from a government grant. While the house was built by Godfroy, it is unknown if he ever actually lived in the house. He sold the house to his business partner Rudolph Nims in 1848. Several additions were made to the house in subsequent years, including the addition of a dining room in 1850, another small room in 1863, a summer kitchen in 1911 and a small porch in 1914. The Nims family owned the house for over a hundred years before selling it. It remains privately owned. The Rudolph Nims House is a block away from the St. Mary's Church Complex Historic District. Description The Rudolph Nims House is a two-story frame Greek Revival structure covered with clapboards. The house measures 32 feet by 32 feet, and sits on a fieldstone foundation. The house has a two-story extension at the rear, as well as a single story addition behind and another to the side. The main section of the house has a gable roof, and separate gable roofs top the additions. Atwo-story Doric portico fronts the house, and separate one-story polygonal one-story entrance porch is located on one side. The portico shelters a blind recess simulating a door. The recess is flanked by floor- length windows which slide into the wall. Despite the several additions to the house, and the heavy modification of the interior, the front facade has remained unchanged.

The text includes many of Waddell's own translations of Latin lyrics. The book was at first published in a small edition because it was thought not to have popular appeal, but went through three editions in the first year. It was favourably reviewed by distinguished critics including George Saintsbury, C. H. Haskins and Ferdinand Lot. In recognition of her achievement, Waddell became the first woman to be awarded the A. C. Benson Foundation silver medal by the Royal Society of Literature. Waddell is best known for bringing to light the history of the medieval goliards in this book. She also translated a selection of their Latin poetry in the companion volume Medieval Latin Lyrics, 1929 (reissued by Penguin Books, 1952).

Early years Tariqh grew up in Santa Barbara in a home filled with music from a diversity of genres, from Carlos Santana to Mac Davis to Sly and the Family Stone. His father was a college educator and his mother was a counselor. Berklee College of Music Following high school, Tariqh studied contemporary classical composition at the University of California at San Diego. But his guitar passion beckoned and he made the move to Boston to attend the famous Berklee School of Music.

Complementing his class study was Tariqh's focused daily practicing and, importantly, his nightly playing in the clubs of Boston where he was exposed to musical genres as diverse as blues, jazz and rock. Tariqh considers this latter to be where he found his musical voice. It was from his experiences with jazz saxophonist Walter Beasley and eminent sessions jazz saxophonist Gerald Albright that he found encouragement to pursue his musical career in Los Angeles. Career Tariqh assembled an extensive and eclectic resume, working with artists such as Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Elton John, George Duke, Herbie Hancock, Bette Midler, Tom Scott, Chaka Khan, Whitney Houston, the Backstreet Boys, and Aerosmith.

It was created by the first dam placed on the South Platte River in Park County, central Colorado. It is owned by Denver Water and supplies drinking water to the greater Denver metro region almost away. History Built in 1909, the earthen dam sat on a site believed by geologists to be a dry lake bed some 300 years old. This lake, named Green Lake, lies submerged in Antero Reservoir. Denver Water acquired the reservoir property in 1924, along with the High Line Canal, and it has remained a part of the Denver Water system since 1924. The Reservoir was closed in 2002 for five years due to drought. The lake went completely dry, and the Colorado Division of Wildlife, in concert with Denver Water resurrected it in 2007. The Colorado Division of Wildlife re-stocked the lake with rainbow trout, brook trout, cutbow, cutthroat trout, brown trout, and splake. In 2011, engineers began lowering the water level by two feet due to excess seepage. The dam has leaked since its construction, requiring it to operate under state restrictions. Beginning in May 2013, Antero reservoir was planned to have been drained because of drought conditions. It was not drained because of substantial snowfall in April 2013. In 2013, a $17 million project to rehabilitate the dam began. The reservoir was then expected to be drained in 2015 for necessary repairs, with re-filling in 2016. In the event, Denver Water began to empty the reservoir in June 2015 for \\"significant repairs to Antero Dam\\". Fishing The shallowness of this reservoir makes it relatively warm for the location and altitude. This makes for exceptionally large, fast growing fish. Antero Reservoir is owned by Denver Water and overseen by Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Because it is not a state park, there are no fees for entry. Fishing is year 'round, with ice fishing in the winter. A valid fishing license is required Stats Elevation: , Capacity: , Surface area: .

However, as the audit involves the inspection of other rights and obligations, names such as Lease Compliance Consulting and Lease Review are more appropriate. Lease Audit is a systematic process consisting of the examination of all documents associated with the lease, the measurement of space and the interpretation of lease language. Normally, it is the landlord who overcharged a tenant and the tenant therefore needs to perform a lease audit. Landlords, on the other hand, may also perform a lease audit against a tenant; this is mainly because of the percentage rent charged. The Process Lease audit services originated from the United States when Marc Betesh, a real estate attorney from New York City, began his own consulting practice in 1985.https://www.kbalease.com/team There are only a few books that talk about this subject.Search result from Google \\"Search books related to Lease Audit\\" Articles are also limited. British Library Direct \\"The Rise of the Lease Audit: Lease audits have gained in popularity in recent years because they can save tenants considerable money\\"British Library Direct \\"How to Conduct a Lease Audit\\"Journal of Corporate Real Estate \\"Rules of lease auditing and dispute resolution\\"Journal of Corporate Real Estate \\"The lease audit clause: Is it fair for tenants?\\" Documents such as invoices, statements, amendment to lease and other correspondence from the landlord, as well as data from other sources will be audited to determine whether charges assessed by the landlord under a tenant‚Äôs lease have been proper. Actual measurement of the tenant‚Äôs space and the total space in the property may be required while architectural drawings and surveys will be studied in order to find out the actual rental space of the tenant and the total rental space of the building. This will directly affect the tenant‚Äôs shares on the additional rental payments. The lease will also be studied and interpreted in order to find out all the rights and obligations (such as exclusive right and the method to calculate percentage rent) associated with it, then the lease auditor will find out and advise the client if those obligations have been properly met and rights have never been lost. Typically, lease auditors will look closely at items like base rent, percentage rent, proportion on additional rent, real estate taxes, repair and maintenance, exclusive right etc. Lease Auditor Lease audit involves different kind of proficiency: audit, law and real estate. Lease auditors need to have in-depth knowledge in general ledgers; assets and liabilities; realty tax assessment, real estate laws, leasing practice and more. Lease auditors are also expected to have excellent lease interpretation skills; analytical skills; research skills; communication skills and negotiation skills. In the past, when lease audit was a new term, lease auditors were traditionally lawyers, accountants and leasing managers who wanted to develop their career path on lease audit. Nowadays, lease audit is a very distinctive profession and its expertise is so special that it goes beyond the scope of each of those professions. One has to combine the knowledge of legal, leasing and auditing together in order to become a competent lease auditor.Excerpt from the website of Association of Canadian Lease Auditors Broad leasing knowledge is needed to perform a professional lease audit and the lease auditors have to be professionally trained for years. Regardless of the original professions, all lease auditors have to be trained in all the accounting, legal and real estate fields. Lease auditors are sensitive to figures and lease provisions, so that they can easily find out the ‚Äúred flag‚Äù in the lease and locate the problems. Fee Structure A lease auditor can be an employee or an independent contractor. For independent contractors, there are 3 different type of fee structure: flat fee, hourly charge and contingent fee. The first one is a piece job, the lease auditor will evaluate the time needed to perform the lease audit and then quote a price. The second one is like what lawyers charge for their hourly jobs. The last one is a percentage charge based on the saving (earning) that the customer (usually the tenant) can get from the lease audit. That is, the lease auditor will split the money saved from performing the audit with the customer. Usually the split is 70/30 and the customer takes the majority. Since the customers do not have to pay any out of pocket money and the obligation to pay only exists when the audits can get them the savings, most customers will choose the contingency basis one.

Retrieved February 19, 2020. However, in 2008, Iceland suffered a financial crisis which caused the Icelandic krona to weaken. It then coupled with the high import tariff imposed on the imported goods causing the cost of imports for the key ingredients to increase, especially a kilogram of onion from Germany which costs the equivalent to a bottle of whisky, making the Big Mac price in Iceland to rise 20 percent from 650 krona (US$5.29) to 780 krona (US$6.36) thus becoming the most expensive Big Mac ever sold in 2009, surpassing the price of Big Mac sold in Switzerland and Norway (US$5.75). Due to this situation, the managing director of Lyst Hr., who managed the franchising of McDonald's in Iceland, Magnus Ogmundsson, decided that it was not worth raising the price of their products in order to stay competitive with other restaurants which used the locally sourced ingredients. Hence it was decided to close all the stores in Iceland in October 2009, with no plans to revive McDonald's Iceland in the future. When the closure was announced on October 26, 2009, many concerned customers rushed to McDonald's to get the last-minute opportunity to have a meal at McDonald's. This caused the sales of McDonald's to spike, where more than 10,000 burgers were sold in a day, and a shortages of staff to handle the large number of customers. The Big Mac was sold out on October 29, 2009. The last McDonald's branch was closed on October 30, 2009. By the time of the closure, one burger costs 230 krona (US$1.87).

Restaurant  As of 2019, the company operates two branches in Iceland, one in Skeifan and another one in Sm√°ratorgi. Similar to McDonald's, it offers drive-through service, indoor seating and playground.  Reception  On the first day of the opening of the Metro restaurant, the reception was quite positive, where many customers had been queuing up during the opening and also unusually high numbers of drivers queued at the drive thru section placing orders. In addition, due to the company's ability to decide the pricing for the products, as well as offering healthier food choices to health-conscious customers, Metro's business has been slightly improved.

Born in Horondenka, Austria in 1891, Klasmer moved to the United States in 1909 after receiving considerable classical training as a violinist from several notable composers. Settling first in New York City, where he played with the German Musical Comedy Theater, Klasmer moved to Richmond, VA, in 1913 to play in the Bijou Theater Orchestra there. During his years in Richmond, he was the first conductor of the Young Men's Hebrew Association Orchestra. In 1916 he moved to Baltimore where he spent the remainder of his career. Once established in Baltimore, Klasmer assisted the conductor, Gustav Strube in founding the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, where he played in the violin section for many years. He also began performing and conducting for several local pit orchestras, most notably as the conductor of the pit orchestra at the Hippodrome Theatre, Baltimore.Benjamin Klasmer's Contribution to Baltimore's Musical History in Maryland Historical Magazine 1972 The orchestras he conducted at various Baltimore theaters, including the New Theater, the Garden Theater, the Rivoli, and the Hippodrome, furnished musical accompaniment to silent movies and to vaudeville acts. It was with the revival of vaudeville at the Hippodrome Theater on August 28, 1931, that Klasmer began his tenure there, which lasted until he died of a heart attack at the theater in 1949. One of Klasmer's proudest legacies, however, was as the conductor of the youth orchestra at Baltimore's Jewish Educational Alliance (J.E.A.), which he founded with Emile Clarke in 1919. After a few years under Klasmer's tutelage, the twenty-seven member youth orchestra had grown into the J.E.A. Symphony Orchestra with eighty musicians, and was regarded as the finest amateur orchestra on the East Coast of the United States. The Baltimore Sun frequently praised the orchestra for both development and quality of performance, and the Beethoven-laden seasons of new music appeared frequently in the newspaper.The Baltimore Sun Throughout the Great Depression Klasmer found work as a musician and conductor, but after, as orchestras began to disappear from movie houses and vaudeville declined as a popular form of entertainment, Klasmer continued to perform at the Hippodrome as part of a two-person comedy/music act and to write music for local ventures. Klasmer composed a variety of music, largely for the violin, as well as a number of popular songs. His most famous work was the official theme song of the Baltimore Colts football team , which he co-wrote with Jo Lombardi in 1947. The name, \\"Klasmer,\\" means \\"musician\\" in Yiddish.

It is known from a single nearly complete skull collected from the Upper Cretaceous Echkar Formation of Niger. The name means \\"boar crocodile\\" from the Greek , kapros (\\"boar\\") and , soukhos (\\"crocodile\\") in reference to its unusually large caniniform teeth which resemble those of a boar. It has been nicknamed \\"BoarCroc\\" by Paul Sereno and Hans Larsson, who first described the genus in a monograph published in ZooKeys in 2009 along with other Saharan crocodyliformes such as Anatosuchus and Laganosuchus. The type species is K. saharicus. Description Cranium in dorsal (left) and ventral (right) view. Length 507 mmNational Geographic. November 2009. p. 140-141 Kaprosuchus is known from a nearly complete skull 507 mm in length in which the lower jaw measured 603 mm long. The original description estimated the entire animal to be in length. It possesses three sets of tusk-like caniniform teeth that project above and below the skull, one of which in the lower jaw fits into notches in upper jaw. This type of dentition is not seen in any other known crocodyliform. Another unique characteristic of Kaprosuchus is the presence of large, rugose horns formed from the squamosal and parietal bones that project posteriorly from the skull. Smaller projections are also seen in the closely related Mahajangasuchus. The snout of Kaprosuchus shows generalized proportions and the naris is positioned dorsally. In Kaprosuchus many teeth are hypertrophied and labiolingually (laterally) compressed, unlike those of crocodyliforms with similarly shallow snouts, which are usually subconical and of moderate length. Another difference between the skull of Kaprosuchus and those of crocodyliforms that also possess dorsoventrally compressed snouts is the great depth of the posterior portion of the skull. In Kaprosuchus, the orbits (i.e., eye sockets) open laterally and are angled slightly forward rather than upward. The orbits turned forward suggest that there was somewhat stereoscopic vision, i.e., an overlap in the visual field of the animal. The surfaces of the premaxillae are rugose with the edges elevated above the body of the bone, suggesting that a keratinous shield would have been supported by the rugosities at the tip of the snout. Along the interpremaxillary suture, the area where the two premaxillae meet, the surface is smooth, giving the paired rugosity of the premaxillae the resemblance of a moustache in anterior view. Classification Cranial reconstruction of K. saharicus Kaprosuchus is a member of the family Mahajangasuchidae along with closely related Mahajangasuchus insignis from the Upper Cretaceous of Madagascar. Although it differs greatly from any other known crocodyliform, Kaprosuchus shares several characteristics with Mahajangasuchus. These include the obliteration of all but the posterior portion of the internasal suture; a laterally facing rugose external articular fossa; the positioning of the jaw joint below the posterior maxillary teeth; a deep, anterodorsally oriented mandibular symphysis; a vertically descending ectopterygoid that is slightly inset from the lateral margin of the jugal; a flared choanal septum forming an articular foot for the palatine; and the hornlike dorsal projection of the external rim of the squamosal (although this is much more developed in Kaprosuchus than Mahajangasuchus). Paleobiology Diet Skull in profile Kaprosuchus is thought to have been a primarily if not exclusively terrestrial predator. Evidence for this behavior includes the positioning of the orbits laterally and somewhat anteriorly, which suggests an overlap in vision. This is unlike many other neosuchians, including extant crocodilians, in which the orbits are positioned dorsally as an adaptation to aquatic predation where the head can be held underwater while the eyes remain above the surface. Additional support for terrestrial predation can be found in the teeth and jaws. The enlarged caniniforms are sharp-edged and relatively straight, unlike the fluted, subconical, recurved teeth of aquatic crocodyliforms. Because the retroarticular process of the lower jaw is long, it is likely that the jaws were able to open relatively quickly with a large gape to allow for the opposing caniniforms to clear one another. The fused nasal bones are thought to have provided reinforcement for the jaws against compression associated with a powerful bite. The telescoped, dorsally positioned external nares are seen as protection against impact if the animal rammed prey with its robust snout. The keratinous shield thought to have covered the tip of the snout would have provided further protection.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 5, 1980. While the official address of the archeological site is restricted, the district incorporates the area of the North Maumee Bay at the mouth of the Ottawa River and Maumee River in Lake Erie. The sparsely populated area includes the Woodtick Peninsula, Gard Island, Indian Island, the Erie Marsh Preserve, the Erie Fish and Hunt Club, and much of the grassy shoreline and interior wetlands. Public access is permitted, and the area is a well known fishing destination. It is also known for one of the areas under dispute during the Toledo War between Michigan and Ohio from 1835‚Äì1836, although no actual conflict took place on the land. History The district spans 130 acres and contains 20 sites. The sites were associated with Native American tribes of the Late Woodland period. Of these, multiple sites are located on Gard Island and Indian Island. Additional sites have been recorded on Woodtick Peninsula, but were destroyed before any research was completed. The existing sites were originally in a riverine environment, but were located on the shoreline at the time of excavation. The Gard Island and Indian Island sites were substantially reduced in size due to encroachment from Lake Erie. Later history In 2006, the Erie Marsh Preserve was incorporated into the expanding Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. At 3.46 mi¬≤ (8.97 km¬≤), the Erie Marsh Preserve doubled the size of the growing refuge and remains the refuge's largest property. At 19 acres (7.7 ha), Gard Island was also incorporated into the wildlife refuge at the same time. These two areas represent the southernmost portions of the wildlife refuge.

Isaac's Universe: Volume One: The Diplomacy Guild, the initial collection of science fiction short stories, was edited by Martin H. Greenberg and published in 1990 by Avon Books. It introduces the collaborative universe created by Asimov which eventually resulted in five volumes: three short story collections and two novels. Volume One: The Diplomacy Guild is 258 pages long, not counting an additional couple of pages in back on the authors contributing their works. There is also an introduction by Isaac Asimov that is seven pages long. This was followed by Volume Two: Phases in Chaos and Volume Three: Unnatural Diplomacy. The novels are: Fossil by Hal Clement and Murder at the Galactic Writers' Society by Janet Asimov. The premise of Isaac's Universe is that the Milky Way Galaxy in the future is populated by six high-tech, space-faring species: * Erthumoi: Human beings, who have colonized many planets beyond Earth and have extended their lifespans with rejuvenation treatments. * Cephallonians: An aquatic species who live in water-filled spaceships, described by Asimov as vaguely analogous to porpoises. * Locrians: A skeletal, insect-like species, adapted to a low-oxygen atmosphere with neon rather than nitrogen. * Naxians: Limbless, snake-like beings, able to read the emotional state of individuals from any organic species just by observing them. * Crotonites: A small winged species who live in an atmosphere poisonous to the other species, and who consider the other species inferior and look on them with contempt. * Samians: Physically powerful, slow-moving, block-like creatures with no appendages who live on a high gravity planet.

Kurzeme Infantry Division. During the year of Soviet occupation Lobe escaped repression and deportations. Lobe married his wife Milda (b. 13 February 1898 in Latvia) on 22 May 1922. She died on 31 May 1985, at √ñsterhaninge south of Stockholm, Sweden. World War II After the German invasion of the USSR Lobe became the commander of the Ventspils self-defence force. There is conflicting information regarding Lobe's participation in the Holocaust, as of now his involvement is yet to be definitively proven.http://www.president.lv/images/modules/items/PDF/item_1641_Vesturnieku_komisijas_raksti_18_sejums.pdf (Page 124) At the end of 1941 Lobe was appointed head of the Latvian self- defence force. Later he was involved in anti-partisan operations against Soviet guerillas in Eastern Latvia and Belarus with the Latvian police battalions. In spring of 1943 Lobe became commander of the 2. (Imanta) Infantry Regiment of the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS on the Volkhov Front. In 1944 Lobe was awarded the rank of colonel and commander of the infantry of the entire Division, participating in fighting in the Opochka district and in Vidzeme. At the end of 1944 he was appointed as commander of Latvian construction battalion in Germany, but due to his Latvian nationalistic views was relieved of this command and placed before a German military tribunal. At the end of the war Lobe was interned in British zone of occupation for the period of a year. Post-war After the war, Lobe actively participated in the commune of Latvians in exile in Germany, such as the Hawks of Daugava organization. He continued this involvement after moving to Sweden in 1950. From 1954 until his death, Lobe was employed at the Military Archives of Sweden. He was an active participant in the Central Council of Latvians in Sweden. In 1970, Lobe unsuccessfully tried to sue the Swedish newspapers Ny Dag and Kv√§llsposten, after articles about his past as a Holocaust perpetrator and Nazi collaborator had been published in the newspapers. He died on 9 July 1985 in √ñsterhaninge, south of Stockholm, Sweden. Karlis Lobe married his wife Milda on 22 May 1922. She was born on 13 February 1898 and died on 31 May 1985 at √ñsterhaninge, south of Stockholm, after 63 years of marriage.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 7, 2010. This is the 21st Treehouse of Horror episode, and, like the other \\"Treehouse of Horror\\" episodes, consisted of three self-contained segments: In \\"War and Pieces\\", Bart and Milhouse discover a real-life board game that they must win to return home; in \\"Master and Cadaver\\", Marge and Homer go on a honeymoon on a sailboat, and rescue a mysterious castaway named Roger; and in \\"Tweenlight\\", Lisa falls in love with a vampire named Edmund. \\"Treehouse of Horror XXI\\" was written by Joel H. Cohen and directed by Bob Anderson. Daniel Radcliffe and Hugh Laurie both guest starred in the episode. The first segment references Jumanji, the second is a loose parody of Dead Calm and the third satirizes the Twilight novel and film series. The episode also contains references to The Office, A Clockwork Orange and Sesame Street. In its original airing on the Fox Network during the November sweeps period, the episode had a 3.7 Nielsen rating viewed in approximately 8.2 million homes. Critical opinion of the episode was mixed, with \\"Tweenlight\\" generally being regarded as the best of the three segments. Plot  Opening sequence  While carving pumpkins, Bart takes a knife and etches a smile into Homer's pants. Homer responds by choking Bart, and Bart puts a flaming pumpkin on Homer's head. Professor Frink then welcomes the audience and warns them of the content of the show, presenting a TiVo remote control to fast forward through the scary stuff. But after accidentally fast forwarding to the end of the special, and exposing spoilers, a shameful Frink uses the remote on himself and fast forwards his life until he is turned to a pile of dust and it blows away spelling out \\"Treehouse of Horror XXI\\". The Frankenstein's Monster who was created by Frink makes a reference to The Office, and remembers his days working at \\"Monster Mifflin\\" with the Mummy, the Wolf Man, a zombie, and a witch. War and Pieces In a parody of Jumanji, Marge, worried about the effects of excessively violent video games, encourages Bart and Milhouse to try playing some of the classic board games in the attic. After rejecting the \\"lame\\" ones, they discover an old board game called \\"Satan's Path\\". Upon playing it, all the rejected games come to life turning the town into a giant game board. Lisa reads the instructions, which are in Latin, and says the two must beat all the games to finish Satan's Path and restore everything to normal. Milhouse dies during the game of Scrabble, but Bart manages to finish it, returning everything back to normal (even bringing Milhouse back to life). Bart and Milhouse state that they will just play hangman but the game brings the hangman to life. With only three letters remaining (WHEE_ _F F_RT_NE), Milhouse guesses the number 3, which results in Bart and Milhouse being hanged. Master and Cadaver In a parody of Dead Calm, Homer and Marge set sail on a romantic second honeymoon. Their time together is interrupted when they rescue a castaway. Introducing himself as Roger, the castaway explains that he was a chef on a yacht called the Albatross, and was knocked out after attempting to stop a poisoning on his ship. Roger makes them a pie, but Homer becomes convinced that Roger poisoned the guests on the Albatross. He grabs the pie from Marge and throws it out the window. Marge chastises Homer, but looks out a window and sees a dead shark with the pie pan in its mouth. Homer and Marge take matters into their own hands as they seemingly kill Roger using a metal pole, and knock his body overboard. However, finding the Albatross, they realize Roger was telling the truth and that some of the passengers are still alive, as one of the people administered an antidote. Roger appears and explains that the shark they saw had died from a fuel leakage from Homer and Marge's boat. Homer then kills Roger, the surviving Albatross crew, and a pelican, to cover their tracks. However, unable to bear the guilt, Marge eats the poisoned pie, much to Homer's horror. The story is then revealed to be Maggie's imagination while she is taking a bath. Homer asks Marge what Maggie thinks about while bathing, which she responds, \\"Just sugar plums and buttercups.\\" Maggie then shadily moves her eyes (revealing eyeliner over one eye), puts on a hat, and drinks milk like Alex from A Clockwork Orange as the theme from the movie briefly plays in the background. Tweenlight In a parody of Twilight, Lisa falls in love with a mysterious new student named Edmund. After saving Lisa from a bus, two cars, a bicycle and a Segway PT, Edmund reveals he is a vampire. Lisa is not frightened by this and the two begin a romance, much to the dismay of Milhouse, who turns into a were-poodle. Marge invites Edmund and his father, Count Dracula, to dinner. Edmund and Lisa are both embarrassed by their fathers and decide to leave. Homer and Dracula track them down to a cathedral in \\"Dracula-la Land\\". They see Edmund climbing up a tower with Lisa, so Homer forces Dracula to carry him up. Lisa wants to become a vampire, explaining that she wants to be a part of their rich culture and to organise events to prevent unfair vampire stereotypes, but has second thoughts after learning that she would be eight years old forever. Edmund says that \\"the blood-lust is upon him\\" and he has to bite something. Homer stops Edmund with a cross, and is amazed to learn vampires love their kids also when Dracula grabs the cross to save Edmund. Edmund and his father reconcile, and Homer saves Lisa by offering himself up in her place as the two vampires feast on him. However, they both die from the bad cholesterol in Homer's blood as he is turned into a vampire. Transforming into a bat to fly home, Homer's fat causes him to fall to his death. His body is carried off by were-poodle Milhouse while Lisa watches in dismay. Production The episode was written by Joel H. Cohen, and it was his first sole writing credit for a Treehouse of Horror episode. He previously wrote the \\"Hex and the City\\" segment of season 13's \\"Treehouse of Horror XII\\". Bob Anderson served as director. It was his third Treehouse of Horror episode, the first two being season seven's \\"Treehouse of Horror VI\\" and season 20's \\"Treehouse of Horror XIX\\". Daniel Radcliffe, star of the Harry Potter film series, guest starred as Edmund in the third segment which parodies the Twilight novel and film series. Radcliffe said that he is a fan of the show and guest starring is \\"a huge honour. The Halloween episode has become a big tradition in The Simpsons so I'm very excited to be part of it. There was a time when I was 12 or 13 when 50 percent of everything I knew about the world came from The Simpsons, so this is a big deal.\\" Hugh Laurie of Blackadder and House guest starred as Roger in \\"Master and Cadaver\\". The episode aired November 7, 2010, making it the tenth Treehouse of Horror episode to air after Halloween. The previous year's episode had aired October 18. Cultural references The opening segment ends with a parody of opening credits of The Office, featuring various monsters like the Frankenstein's monster, the Mummy and the Wolf Man among others working in \\"Monster Mifflin\\". The plot of \\"War and Pieces\\" references the film Jumanji. Some of the board games referenced include Chutes and Ladders and Mouse Trap. Milhouse's death, where he lets go of a ledge and sinks into water, is a reference to Jack Dawson's death in Titanic. The answer for the hangman game Bart and Milhouse played is Wheel of Fortune. Milhouse banging his head against the post, saying, \\"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid!\\", is a reference to Boogie Nights. The second segment, \\"Master and Cadaver\\", is based on the film Dead Calm. The title is a reference to the film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World. At the end of the segment, Maggie imitates Alex from the film A Clockwork Orange. \\"Tweenlight\\" parodies the Twilight novel and film series. Edmund is based on Edward Cullen, the character portrayed by Robert Pattinson in Twilight and its sequels. Edmund's father is Count Dracula. Count von Count from PBS's Sesame Street and Yogi Bear also have cameo appearances in the segment. Other famous vampires with cameo appearance are: Dracula from Bram Stoker's Dracula, Grandpa Munster, Count Orlock, Blacula, Selene, Elvira, Mistress of the Dark and Count Chocula.Tv guide At one point Edmund yells \\"You're tearing me apart!\\" to his father. This could be a reference to James Dean's character in the 1955 film Rebel Without a Cause or Tommy Wiseau's character in the 2003 film The Room. Reception In its original airing on the Fox Network during the November sweeps period, the episode had a 3.7 Nielsen rating and 9% share of the audience in the 18-49 demographic, and was viewed in approximately 8.2 million homes. The episode was up 23% in viewership compared with the previous episode, \\"MoneyBART\\", which aired October 10. The episode received mixed critical reviews, with \\"Tweenlight\\" generally being regarded as the best segment. John Griffiths of Us Weekly gave the episode three stars, writing that \\"the three oddball tales run from mildly amusing to flat-out inspired. In one goofy vignette, Homer and a bikini- wearing Marge pluck a scary mystery man from the sea. However, watching Lisa crush on a brooding vampire in a dead-on poke at Twilight is the hilarious treat here.\\" Fred Topel of Screen Junkies wrote, \\"The best jokes in all the segments are actually not the spoofs. They‚Äôre the cartoon physical comedy, the references to mundane frustrations like having to be the thimble when playing Monopoly. It‚Äôs also super gory. [..] I think ‚ÄúThe Simpsons‚Äù are still on the creative upswing since The Simpsons Movie and this ‚ÄúTreehouse of Horrors‚Äù would hold up with classics like \\"The Shinning\\" and \\"The Homega Man.\\" Brad Trechak of TV Squad felt that it was one of the best Treehouse of Horrors in years. He wrote, \\"Of the three vignettes, the first segment 'War and Pieces,' while not the best, was the most original despite being a variation of the plot of 'Jumanji.' Unlike that book/movie, instead of the game coming into the real world, the game brings other board games into the real world. The satire on this show remains sharp as none of the games had the same name as their real world counterparts to prevent toy company litigation against Fox. [..] The final segment 'Tweenlight'... was the best of the three. It felt a little less dated than the first two.\\" Robert Bianco of USA Today was critical of the episode, writing \\"It is possible [that The Simpsons] has worn out the Treehouse franchise. [The] three installments just seem to be reaching for jokes that aren't there, and falling in the attempt. [...] As you'd hope from The Simpsons, the segments all boast a few clever moments that will make you smile if not laugh. But they're not scary, they're not particularly funny, and outside of some tepid Twilight jokes, they're no longer even trying to be real parodies of the original stories.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club also gave the episode a negative review, and felt that \\"There were laughs in all three segments, but the episode as a whole left something to be desired. The first [...] eventually descended into a long string of mostly lame board game jokes, as if the writers had been coming up with board game puns for the last 15 seasons or something and wanted an excuse to unload a bunch of them all at once. The idea of Bart and Milhouse playing with a Ouija board ripoff was promising, so to see it descend into gags about Marge getting sucked into Clue was disappointing. There were fewer good gags [in \\"Master and Cadaver\\"] than in the board game segment, but it was balanced out by a fairly solid Hugh Laurie performance. The last segment, the inevitable Twilight parody, was funny across the board, both in how it took the piss out of the Twilight films and how it satirized vampire mania. [...] Still, it wasn't the best \\"Treehouse\\" ever, and you could make a good claim for it being the worst, particularly if the Twilight segment wasn't in there.\\" Alf Clausen's score for the episode received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards.

Fossils have been found from Niger and Morocco and date back to the Upper Cretaceous. Discovery The name means \\"pancake crocodile\\" from the Greek ŒªŒ±Œ≥Œ±ŒΩŒøŒΩ, laganon (\\"pancake\\") and œÉŒø·ø¶œáŒøœÇ, souchos (\\"crocodile\\") in reference to the shallow depth of the skull, which is characteristic of all stomatosuchids. It has been nicknamed \\"PancakeCroc\\" by Paul Sereno and Hans Larsson, who first described the genus in a monograph published in ZooKeys in 2009 along with other Saharan crocodyliformes such as Anatosuchus and Kaprosuchus. The type species is L. thaumastos (meaning 'the astonishing pancake crocodile' from Greek Œ∏Œ±œÖŒºŒ±Œ∂œâ, thaumazo \\"I astonish\\" in reference to its unusual form) from the Cenomanian-age Echkar Formation in Niger, holotype MNN IGU13. A second species, L. maghrebensis (making a reference to the place of discovery), is known from the Kem Kem Beds in Morocco, which are also Cenomanian in age; its holotype is UCRC PV2.  Features  Both species of Laganosuchus are known only from their lower jaws, those of L. thaumastos almost complete save for the left retroarticular process and those of L. maghrebensis only from a fragment of the dentary bone. L. thaumastos had a total jaw length of 838 mm and a jaw length from tip to articular facet of 750 mm, of which 490 mm actually bore teeth. Across the jaws, the total width of the lower jaw ranged from around 140 mm at the symphysis to 240 mm at the articular facets, widening fairly evenly all the way along. All the teeth were simple straight spikes, with the first pair the largest and the rest of the teeth decreasing in size towards the back of the mouth. Each side of the mouth bore 24 teeth, relatively evenly spaced save for the sixth and seventh, the dental alveoli of which have merged. Each side of these jaws is gently bowed outwards horizontally, curving more strongly towards the symphysis of the two dentary bones from the seventh alveolus forwards. The symphysis itself is relatively small and weak compared to other crocodyliforms, suggesting a very weak bite, although the bones are fully fused. The jaws are also bowed slightly, curving downwards from the articular facet and then back upwards to the symphysis of the jaws. Each of the dentary bones is very slender, only about 22 mm wide even at the slightly thickened 'chin' of the symphysis. While L. thaumastos has a small crest running along the lingual side of the dentary to thicken it, this feature is not present in L. maghrebensis. The splenial is a very thin sheet of bone in both species; it stretches much of the way along the lower jaws, but does not participate in the symphysis as the dentary does. The anterior end of the splenial differs between the two species; in L. thaumastos it is bifurcated, whereas in L. maghrebensis the anterior end of the splenial comes to a simple point. Although the posterior end of the lower jaw is not preserved in L. maghrebensis, in L. thaumastos the coronid process is rugose, low and broad transversely, thickened by the surangular on the lingual side of the jaw, possibly signifying the attachment of powerful muscles to close the long, heavy jaws - a task that would be difficult underwater due to the large surface area between them. The external mandibular fenestra is very much reduced, forming little more than a slit. There is an unusually small adductor fossa just in front of the saddle-shaped articular facet of the glenoid; on the right side this saddle-shaped facet has irregular edges and shows some signs of bone disease, for unknown reasons. The retroarticular process is triangular in cross-section with slightly concave sides. Both the angular and the prearticular bones have thin posterior rami that entirely overlap the articular laterally and medially, leaving only the top and bottom faces of the articular open. L. thaumastos has the first two teeth in each dentary tilted forwards, and these would probably have projected out from the mouth below matching teeth in the premaxilla. Between each alveolus, the dorsal margin of the alveolar row forms a ridge that slopes downwards labially in concave depressions between the alveoli, probably indicating strongly interdigitating teeth that fitted together to form a kind of 'fish trap'. Most of the teeth are broken or missing, but a few were being replaced when the specimen died and have so been preserved in their crypts; they are straight, perfectly symmetrical spikes with no ornamentation, carinae or recurvature. In L. maghrebensis, however, the fourth tooth in the dentary is slightly larger than the first and there is no procumbency of the first dental alveoli, so its front teeth would not have projected forwards in the same fashion. Both species of Laganosuchus would have been between 4 and 6 metres in total length, a comparatively large proprtion of which would have been the large flattened head. It is possible that they had gular sacs beneath their throats, just as their relative Stomatosuchus may have done, but there is no fossil evidence either to support or disprove this theory. The jaws would have been unable to be opened or closed at speed or with much power due to their length relative to all the possible muscles that could be used to close them. Paleobiology Restoration of L. thaumastos According to Sereno and Larsson, L. thaumastos was an approximately 6 m (20 ft) long, squat fish-eater with a 1 m (3.3 ft) flat head. It would have stayed motionless for hours, waiting for prey to swim into its open jaws with spike-shaped teeth. These teeth would have fitted together tightly so that no fish trapped in the mouth could escape.

The weekend getaway is a cover: they are really planning to fly to Colombia to rob a drug lord. They meet with Clint (Ernest Borgnine), who supplies them with weapons and target practice. It becomes clear that with the exception of Stone, the men have no relevant training and are not taking the heist seriously. The men are flown to a jungle. Their target is Serrano (James Coburn), a sadistic drug lord who lives in a large villa. The group observes Serrano, his staff and various visitors from a hidden vantage point. They discuss whether they would have the courage to actually kill someone, and what they will do with their share of the cash once they return home. They infiltrate the villa, capture Serrano and his lover, and force Serrano to reveal the combination to his safe. They escape from the villa with five million dollars in cash. They travel on foot through the jungle, eventually finding horses to buy. Believing that they have been successful, the men camp for the night and celebrate. They are unaware that they are being observed by a rebel tracker. When they wake the next day, Serrano‚Äôs men and the local military are approaching them in all-terrain vehicles and on horseback. They flee, but Tony and Rockney are captured by Serrano. Stone and Dan have to continue on foot and only escape their pursuers by leaping from a very high rope bridge. Serrano has Rockney beaten to force Tony to reveal the location of money. Knowing that Stone has his share of the cash and that they face better odds of escape in the open, Tony agrees to show them where the money is \\"hidden\\". Serrano has them taken to a prison. They meet Olivia (Lindsay Wagner), the prisoner in the neighboring cell, who claims she was falsely arrested. Tony bribes a passing child to pull out the barred window of their cell with a tow truck. The child demands their clothes in payment also, and they are pursued virtually naked through the town. They lose their pursuers in a bordello. Dressed in women's clothes, Tony and Rockney make their way to a bus station and reunite with Olivia. They travel together to the rendezvous point. Dan and Stone are captured by a local rebel leader, General Mariano (Anthony Quinn), who wants the stolen money for himself. They escape, then turn and track the rebels until nightfall. They are forced to kill several of the rebels before they retrieve the cash. The rebels pursue them to the rendezvous point, where they expect to be airlifted to safety. Dan is wounded by Mariano‚Äôs tracker. In the ensuing firefight, Tony is shot trying to protect Stone. Believing Tony is dead, the others continue to the airstrip without him. Serrano‚Äôs mercenaries have arrived ahead of them, and a three-way gun battle ensues. Serrano's men subdue the rebels. The retrieval plane arrives and provides covering fire, scattering Serrano‚Äôs men. The plane lands, the team boards hurriedly, and they make their escape. They are celebrating their success when the engine stalls.

The murder Bellino and Gertson were two gangsters convicted of murdering nineteen-year-old Robert \\"Tex\\" Williams, a former U.S. Marine. On August 3, 1945, Williams led Bellino, Gertson and Charles Mantia to a New Hampshire summer camp. He had learned there would be an illegal dice game taking place in the camp. The four men would rob the players at gunpoint. Williams had lured his accomplices with a promise of easily stealing up to $10,000. Instead they escaped with \\"a few hundred dollars\\".Alan Rogers, \\"Success‚ÄîAt Long Last: The Abolition of the Death Penalty in Massachusetts, 1928‚Äì1984\\" The trio was enraged at Williams. They also feared the younger man could squeal on them to the police. On August 7, 1945, the four of them shared a taxi ride in the vicinity of Boston. The taxi stopped at an isolated location, not far from the shore. Williams, Bellino and Gertson stepped out for a walk. Mantia waited in the taxi with the cab driver. Bellino and Gertson returned without Williams, claiming the young man would spend his night with a girlfriend. Williams' corpse was soon after discovered. He had been shot in the back of the head. Mantia was the one to lead the police to Bellino and Gertson. James Salah, the cab driver, also became a witness for the prosecution. On June 18, 1946, the duo were found guilty of first-degree murder in a trial by jury. There were originally 14 jurors. Two of them had been dismissed prior to the final verdict. A legal argument that this violated the rights of the defendants was eventually rejected by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. A \\"mercy bill\\" discussed at the time in the Massachusetts General Court could have proven beneficial to the duo, but was vetoed by Robert F. Bradford, Governor of Massachusetts. Execution and abolition of death penalty in Massachusetts Both Bellino and Gertson were executed in the electric chair at the Massachusetts State Prison at Charlestown shortly after midnight on the night of May 8‚Äì9, 1947. On April 3, 1951, Massachusetts enacted a \\"mercy bill\\" which removed the mandatory death sentence for murder in all cases except for murder committed in the course of rape or attempted rape. No further executions were carried out and in 1984 the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled that capital punishment violated the state constitution.

He was born as Olof Knape but became ennobled under the name Str√∂mstierna in 1715.  Biography   Early years and in the Dutch service  Str√∂mstierna was born 1664 in Bohusl√§n where his father, Nils Knape, was a fisherman. Like many people in the archipelago, Str√∂mstierna worked at the sea during his youth. He first sailed domestically, but went to France, England, America, and East Indies in 1697. During these travels he joined the Dutch East India Company and was once in the service of the States-General of the Netherlands, in which reached the rank of lieutenant.  The Swedish Navy Staff  In 1698, Str√∂mstierna was offered the chance of joining the Swedish navy. He became a captain in 1700, and assisted admiral Cornelius Anckarstierna with the enrollment of \\"all the existing seamanship in Bohusl√§n\\". In 1701, he joined the Swedish expedition to Arkhangelsk in Russia as the head of the frigate Marstrand. Str√∂mstierna became captain of an enlisted sailor company in Bohusl√§n in 1704. His most important missions were to convoy transport ships, undertake cruises, and protect the Bohusl√§n coast against Danish attacks. As a reward, he became a schout-bij-nacht in the Gothenburg Squadron in 1714 and was ennobled under the name Str√∂mstierna in 1715.  The fighting in Bohusl√§n against Tordenskjold  In 1716, Str√∂mstierna was missioned to convoy a number of transport vessels, loaded with siege artillery and supplies, to Svinesund. When he reached Dynekilen, his flotilla was attacked by Peter Tordenskjold who managed to destroy many of the ships after a five-hour-long battle. For his efforts in the battle, Str√∂mstierna was named vice admiral by the Swedish king Charles XII. During Str√∂mstierna's subsequent period as commander of the Gothenburg Squadron, he contributed significantly to the repelling of Tordenskjold's attack on the city in 1717. That year he became head of Roddargastarnas Regiment (3,000 men), and in 1718 he led the shipment of over a hundred ships loaded with food and other supplies from Gothenburg to Str√∂mstad, which made the military campaign against Norway possible. The last few years When Str√∂mstierna retired from active service in 1719, the Swedish government raised him to the rank of full admiral. He spent the rest of his years, until his death in 1730, at his farm Vens√∂ in Bohusl√§n.

It operated from November 2018 to December 2019. As of December 2019, the Bi-State Development Agency, a regional transit operator, was seeking ways to restart operations. Opened in November 2018, the Loop Trolley connected the Delmar Loop district and the Missouri History Museum in Forest Park, serving parts of University City and the St. Louis neighborhoods of DeBaliviere Place, Skinker/DeBaliviere, and the West End. It also served two MetroLink light-rail stations: Delmar Loop and Forest Park‚ÄìDeBaliviere. At its closing, the line operated from noon until 6 p.m. on Thursdays through Sundays. Passengers were carried on two replica-historic streetcars. The Loop Trolley Transportation Development District owns the line and trolley cars, which were operated by the non-profit Loop Trolley Company. Operating funds came from a one-cent sales tax collected by businesses along and near the line, and from fares and advertising. Ridership was far lower than expected, and the trolley ceased operations on December 29, 2019. History The Delmar Loop was named for the streetcar turnaround that occupied two oblong blocks on the north side of Delmar east from Kingsland Avenue. This loop was used by two lines of the St. Louis Public Service Company ‚Äî the Olive-Delmar and Creve Coeur lines ‚Äî and a private line west to what is now University City's City Hall. Streetcar service ended in St. Louis in 1966, but the Loop retained its name. An ex-Milan Peter Witt streetcar on display in St. Louis, to publicize the project when it was merely a proposal Years later, the idea of bringing back streetcars found a champion in Joe Edwards, the owner of Blueberry Hill, The Pageant, and other Loop businesses. Edwards secured the purchase of two Peter Witt-type streetcars that once operated in Milan, Italy. The two Peter Witt cars were cosmetically refurbished by the Gomaco Trolley Company in 2005 and placed on long-term display along the routeone on Delmar by Commerce Bank, and the other at the Missouri History Museumto publicize the proposed Loop Trolley line. Originally, the two were slated to carry passengers if the project came to fruition, but plans to restore them to operating condition were deemed too expensive in 2015, in part because they had deteriorated during their years on outdoor display. Track construction under way on Delmar Blvd. in November 2015 In July 2010, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) Urban Circulator Grant Program approved a grant of $25 million for the project. Other money came from the Loop Trolley Transportation Development District and elsewhere. The overall construction budget was $51 million as of 2015. Construction began in March 2015 and was completed in November 2016. During construction, some shops and restaurants saw decreased foot traffic and sales. Some businesses moved; others closed permanently. One business owner called the Loop Trolley \\"a solution in need of a problem\\". The first of three streetcars being refurbished and modified for the line was delivered on February 16, 2017, and the second on March 30, 2017. On March 26, 2017, car No. 001 was towed along the line to check the tracks and clearances at station platforms, becoming the first streetcar to be moved along the Loop Trolley line, though not under its own power. Loop Trolley car 001 in service on Delmar Boulevard in December 2018 The line's opening was delayed several times as completion of a third trolley fell behind schedule. Eventually it was decided to operate a temporarily reduced schedule with two trolleys until the third is delivered. In November 2018, the Loop Trolley Company announced that the line would open on November 15, 2018. Snow delayed the opening one more day, and service began on November 16, 2018. But service was initially limited to the portion between the Missouri History Museum terminus and the Delmar Loop MetroLink station due to a failure to obtain an operating permit from University City. The permit was obtained and service was implemented along the entire line one week later, on November 23, 2018. Operation and funding The Loop Trolley Transportation Development District, which managed the project, is the owner of the line and trolley cars, but the service is operated by a separate, non-profit entity called the Loop Trolley Company. A one-cent sales tax collected by businesses along and near the line provide the largest source of revenue to fund the service. Other revenue sources include fares and advertising. After more than six months in operation, the Loop Trolley, which had cost $51,000,000 and has an annual operational budget of $1,300,000, had raised a mere $22,283 in fares. Its projection for the first year was $394,433, though trolley officials said that was based on seven-day- a-week operation. Route and schedule ticket vending machine The line starts at the Missouri History Museum and runs north on DeBaliviere Avenue in St. Louis, past the Forest Park‚ÄìDeBaliviere MetroLink station. It then turns west on Delmar Boulevard to the Delmar Loop MetroLink station and crosses the St. Louis city/county boundary to University City to serve the Delmar Loop district, terminating at the University City Library on Delmar Boulevard, west of Kingsland Avenue. In the second half of 2019, service was provided four days a week, from noon to 6 p.m. Thursday and Sunday, and noon to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday. Service was is expected to expand to more hours, and seven days a week after the third trolley arrived. Rolling stock Loop Trolley service was provided by two faux-vintage streetcars acquired used from Portland, Oregon. A third vintage streetcar from Seattle was expected to join the fleet in 2019. In December 2013, the Loop Trolley district acquired from Portland transit agency TriMet two Gomaco-built Brill-replica streetcars which were then in operation on the Portland Vintage Trolley service, which use continued until mid-2014. Those two cars were designed to look like 1903 streetcars but were actually built in 1991 (car 511) and 1992 (car 512), and feature steel frames under their wooden bodies and more-modern propulsion equipment (including rebuilt 1940s trucks). For St. Louis, they were modified for wheelchair accessibility, to meet ADA regulations, with the installation of wheelchair lifts (one per side). Gomaco was hired to carry out those and other modifications, and the work began at Gomaco's Ida Grove, Iowa, plant in August 2015. In January 2016, it was announced that the Loop Trolley district had purchased three ex-Melbourne, Australia, W2-type streetcars from Seattle, which had operated on Seattle's Waterfront Streetcar line until it shut down in 2005. Only one of the three was planned for immediate refurbishment, modification and use due to funding limitations. The necessary modifications included restoring doors on one side of the car, restoring steps to the doors (Seattle's line used high-platform stations which didn't necessitate steps), installing two wheelchair lifts, one on each side, and replacement of the car's trolley poles with a pantograph. The three cars were moved from Seattle in early June 2016. Cars 482 and 518 were taken to St. Louis and put in indefinite storage for potential future restoration and use. Car 512 was taken to Gomaco in Iowa, which had been awarded a $676,750 contract to restore and modify the car. Melbourne trolley of the same type as the three acquired from Seattle for eventual use on the Loop Trolley line, shown in Seattle in 1994 The operational fleet was to comprise three cars in 2019: two ex-Portland Brill replica cars (Portland Nos. 511‚Äì512) and one ex-Seattle, ex-Melbourne car (Seattle No. 512). Ex-Portland cars 511‚Äì512 were renumbered 002 and 001, respectively, and ex-Seattle, ex-Melbourne car 512 was renumbered 003. Car 001 is painted red and cream, Car 002 blue and cream, and Car 003 orange and cream. At the time of the line's opening, Car 003 was still at Gomaco's Iowa plant, with its renovation and modification more than a year behind schedule, partly due to delays in getting parts from Germany. Car 003 was delivered to the Loop Trolley's maintenance facility on January 29, 2019. Discontinuation On December 5, 2019, the operators of the Loop Trolley announced that the line would shut down on December 29 due to a lack of operating funds and low revenue. A takeover bid by the Bi-State Development Agency (BSDA), which operates Metro Transit, is under consideration to restore the service and prevent the return of federal funding for the project. The trolley had sold 15,776 tickets in the first 11 months, far below the projected amount needed to prevent a budget shortfall; the lack of ridership was blamed on the shortened, four-day schedule and lack of service while operating only two of the three vehicles. At the time of the line's closure, the third trolley, No. 003 (ex-Seattle, ex-Melbourne), had still not been cleared to enter service, and this had kept the plans to expand to all-day and daily service from being implemented. Maintenance facility The Loop Trolley's administrative headquarters and maintenance facility are located at 5875 Delmar Boulevard, in a building that had been Delmar High School until 1980.

Originally issued weekly (starting July 12, 1917) in New York as the U.S. Air Service Journal, as of 1920 (Vol. III) it was published monthly. Publication moved to Washington, D.C. soon thereafter. The publisher was the Army and Navy Air Service Association, after 1942 the Air Service Publishing Company. The longtime editor was Earl N. Findlay (1878-1956). Indeed, the magazine only outlived him by six months after he died in mid-1956. Despite its military- sounding title (which only added the final \\"s\\" with Vol. IX in January 1924), the monthly's pages covered both civil and military aviation issues. Length of individual issues varied widely‚Äîfrom 50 pages or more in 1929 to as few as half that by the mid-1950s. U.S. Air Services was published until December 1956. (volume 41). Content most often included reprinted speeches or summaries of important reports, plus some original material, including short news stories and reviews of recent books. Full-page photos of newsworthy people and aircraft appeared regularly. The first several pages of each issue carried Findlay's informed editorials ranging over all aspects of (chiefly American) aviation. The magazine's motto was \\"Devoted to the development of aeronautics - civil and military - in the United States, birthplace of the flying machine, and throughout the world.\\" Probably to better meet needs of major advertisers, the magazine changed to a larger format (9 by 11-inch pages) in November 1927. Many advertisers purchased pages in the same place in each issue for years (Glenn L. Martin Co., for example, purchased the inside front cover, while Lockheed regularly took full-page ads to tout its latest navy fighter aircraft). The first color advertisements began to appear around 1940. U.S. Air Services was popular among serious aviation aficionados, and copies were found in the Wright family library. Findlay's magazine was a staunch backer of Orville Wright's claim to have flown the first heavier-than-air craft (in December 1903) at a time when the Smithsonian Institution was still backing the earlier though forlorn flight efforts of Samuel Langley, its former Secretary.

History From 1938 to 1964, there was no official coloration associated with v√µ ph·ª•c. However, after a meeting between Vietnamese martial arts masters in 1964, indigo/deep blue was chosen to be the official color of Vietnamese martial arts uniforms. The official color was not necessarily adopted by all practitioners, as evidenced throughout 1973-1990 when many practitioners under a separate development of Vovinam, the \\"Viet Vo Dao Federation,\\" wore black uniforms. By 1990, however, after further meetings between councils, indigo had been adopted by the majority of Vovinam practitioners in and outside of Vietnam. Deep blue/indigo (Vietnamese: Lam) is now the internationally accepted color of Vo Phuc for Vietnamese martial arts. Construction The v√µ ph·ª•c of Vovinam are very similar, if not nearly identical, to the keikogi of Japanese martial arts. Both top and bottom of the uniform are constructed in much the same way as keikogi, and the two are likely interchangeable if not for obvious differences in coloration. The thickness of v√µ ph·ª•c varies by school, preference, or size of a practitioner. Wearing As with the Japanese keikogi, the v√µ ph·ª•c top should be worn with the left front panel tied over the right.

Abandoned since its deactivation in 1956, it survives as a hollow shell near the existing skeleton tower. History Calls for a lighthouse in the area were first heard in the 1850s, and in 1861 George Gordon Meade was sent to the area to investigate requests for lights on the island and on the shore north of the mouth of the Menominee River. He reported that a light on Green Island would be sufficient for both requests, and the light was constructed in 1862-1863. A two-story brick structure, it displayed a fixed light provided by a fourth order Fresnel lens. The first keeper was one Samuel Drew, who also happened to be the person from whom the land for the light station was purchased; he and his wife Mary remained at this station until 1881, when they transferred to the Menominee Pier Light. In addition to their official duties, they farmed much of the remainder of the island. The year after activation, a severe fire in the lighthouse required erection of a temporary beacon and shelter during reconstruction of the light. The Drews had five children on the island, two of whom were destined to become lighthouse keepers themselves; a third died on the island in infancy and is buried there. 1871 is remembered in the Green Bay area as the year of the Great Peshtigo Fire; the island escaped the conflagration, but the smoke was so thick that Samuel Drew kept the light burning during daylight as well as at night. Nevertheless, the three-masted schooner George L. Newman was wrecked offshore, but the crew was rescued without loss. 1876 saw the first of several changes to the docking facilities, as an additional plot was purchased from the Drews and a new landing was constructed. In 1883 the boathouse was moved due to dropping water levels in the bay. This house was damaged by ice in 1902 and had to be rebuilt. In the meantime the well went dry in 1893 and had to be redug. Frank Drew became assistant keeper in 1902, transferring from the Port des Morts Island Light. The son of Samuel and Mary Drew, he was joined by his brother George after Frank became head keeper in 1909. Frank and his brother gained a reputation for heroism, with over thirty rescues credited to them over the years. In 1928 the beacon was changed to a new flashing signal with a reduced range; this lamp, however, was able to be operated in the winter months. Frank Drew retired in 1929 and died in 1931; in 1998 a USCG coastal buoy tender, USCGC Frank Drew (WLM-557), was christened in his honor. The light was automated in 1933, and in 1956 a new steel tower was erected and the old house abandoned. The following year the light station was sold to the Roen Steamship Company, which had already purchased the rest of the island in 1955. Vandalism, fires and weather have reduced the original site to an empty shell, but the 1956 tower remains active.

The divisions reflected historical boundaries of the provinces where these food and culinary traditions were preserved until modern times. Although Korea has been divided into two nation- states since 1948 (North Korea and South Korea), it was once divided into eight provinces (paldo) according to the administrative districts of the Joseon Dynasty. The northern region consisted of Hamgyeong, Pyeongan, and Hwanghae provinces. The central region comprised Gyeonggi, Chungcheong, and Gangwon provinces. Gyeongsang and Jeolla provinces made up the southern region. Until the late 19th century transportation networks were not well developed, and each provincial region preserved its own characteristic tastes and cooking methods. Geographic differences are also reflected by the local specialty foodstuffs depending on the climate and types of agriculture, as well as the natural foods available. With the modern development of transportation, and the introduction of foreign foods, Korean regional cuisines have tended to overlap and integrate. However, there are still many unique traditional dishes in Korean regional cuisine that have been handed down through the generations. Northern region Pyongan province Pyongan cuisine, based in Pyongan province, is characterized as a continental style due to early Manchurian influence. Dishes are made into large shapes so as to appear abundant. Jobap, a bowl of mixed steamed rice and millet, is commonly served in place of ssalbap (steamed rice), and foods made with grain flour such as noodle dishes, especially naengmyeon (cold buckwheat noodles), and mandu (dumplings) are common Pyongan dishes. The cuisine's taste is generally bland, with fatty foods being enjoyed during winter. The form of a Pyongan meal is realistic and social. The kimchi, or preserved pickled vegetables, eaten in the region consist mostly of dongchimi, a water kimchi, which is frequently used as a broth for naengmyeon. Representative main dishes include: gukbap (a soup with rice), kimchi mari (cold kimchi broth with rice), dakjuk (chicken porridge), Pyongyang naengmyeon (cold buckwheat noodle soup), eobok jaengban (pressed beef served in a brass plate), gangnyang guksu (corn noodles in a cold broth), Pyongyang manduguk (Pyongyang style dumpling soup), and gulmandu (small dumpling without a covering). Pyongan style banchan, which are small side dishes accompanied by a main dish, include: ttokttoki jaban (seasoned shredded beef), mucheonggom (braised radish leaves and beef), deopuljang (fermented soybean paste), danggochujang bokkeum (stir-fried dish in chili pepper paste),Á¨¨5Á´† Ï∞¨Î•ò(È•åÈ°û)(‚Ö°) p. 101 National Research Insistue of Cultural Heritage dwaeji gogijeon (pork pancakes), naengchae (cold salad), Yongpyon gimjang kimchi (Yongbyon style kimchi), gaji kimchi (pickled eggplant), baek kimchi (kimchi without chili pepper), and kkotge jjim (steamed horse crab). Oi tojangguk (cucumber soybean paste soup), and naepotang (kimchi and chitterling stew)ÎÇ¥Ìè¨ÌÉï are representative soups and stews. Tteok or glutinous rice cakes of the region are given unconventional names and are larger and simpler in form than those of Seoul, such as songgi tteok which is a rice cake made with the inner bark of pine trees, golmi tteok (thimble- shaped rice cake), kkojang tteok (tteok covered with steamed bean crumbles), ppong tteok (tteok steamed with mulberry leaves), nidoraemi (rice cake covered with azuki bean crumbles), and jogae songpyeon (clam-shaped tteok with fillings). The songgi in songgi tteok refers to the inner bark of pine trees, and its ground flour is mixed with glutinous rice flour and kneaded. The dough is steamed or filled with ground pine nuts and then pan-fried with sesame oil. Notti is another characteristic tteok of Pyongan and Hwanghae provinces, made by pounding a saccharified dough of hulled millet flour, and pan-frying its pieces with oil. Pyongan hangwa or traditional confectionery are gwajul (fried honeyed confection) and yeot (candies). Taesik is also a variety of the regional hangwa, made by mixing jocheong (liquefied yeot) and misu (steamed and dried mixed flour made from various grains and beans).

Therefore, Pyongyang cuisine shares the general culinary tradition of Pyongan province. The most famous local food is Pyongyang naengmyeon, also called mul naengmyeon or just simply naengmyeon. Naengmyeon literally means \\"cold noodles,\\" while the affix mul refers to \\"water\\" because the dish is served in a cold soup. Naengmyeon consists of thin and chewy buckwheat noodles in cold broth mixed with a meat broth, and dongchimi (watery kimchi) topped with a slice of sweet Korean pear. Pyongyang naengmyeon was originally eaten at homes built with ondol (traditional underfloor heating) during the cold winter, so is also humorously called \\"Pyongyang deoldeori\\" (shivering in Pyongyang). Pyongyang locals sometimes enjoyed it as a haejangguk which is any type of food eaten as a hangover cure‚Äî commonly in the form of a warm soup. Another representative Pyongyang dish is Taedonggang sungeoguk, meaning \\"trout soup from the Taedong River\\". It is made with trout, which are abundant in the Taedong River, along with black peppercorns and salt. It is served as a courtesy to important guests visiting Pyongyang. Therefore, the question \\"How good was the taste of the trout soup?\\" is commonly used to greet people returning from Pyongyang. In addition, Pyongyang onban (literally \\"warm rice of Pyongyang\\") is a local specialty. It is a dish made with freshly cooked rice topped with sliced mushrooms and chicken, and a couple of bindaetteok (pancakes made from ground mung beans and vegetables). Hamgyong province Hamgyong province, consisting of North and South Hamgyong provinces, belongs to the administration of North Korea. It lies in the far northern region of the Korean peninsula, comprising steep mountains and valleys while facing the Sea of Japan (East Sea) to the east. Cereal crop farming is developed in the region, so diverse types of high quality cereals such as millet, barnyard millet, sorghum, soybeans, and maize are harvested. In contrast with millet, and sorghum harvested in South Korea, those of Hamgyon provinces have a more glutinous texture, and have good, savory tastes. The quality of potatoes and grains is also high, so the starch obtained from the crops is used to make noodles. Fresh Alaska pollack and various fish are caught in the adjacent sea. Although Hamgyong cuisine is not salty, garlic and chili pepper are used heavily as seasonings. The alternative name, dadegi, for chili powder-based sauce originates from the region. Hamhung naengmyeon, a cold noodle dish, is made with the sauce. It originates in Hamhung, South Hamgyong province, and is topped with hoe (sliced raw fish) seasoned with hot and spicy sauce. The noodles are mixed with the hoe and sauce, so called hoe naengmyeon, which is different from naengmyeon eaten in the rest of North Korea. However, the taste of North Hamgyong province is plainer and less spicy than that of South Hamgyong province. The shape is large and a continental style, so decoration of dishes is simple and less luxurious. The locals are active, and enjoy wild foods. Typical main dishes in Hamgyong cuisine include: japgokbap (a bowl of cooked mixed multiple grains), jjinjobap (steamed sorghum), dak bibimbap (mixed rice and vegetables with chicken slices), eollin kongjuk (porridge made with frozen soybeans), and oksusujuk (corn porridge). Garitguk is a beef short rib soup topped with yukhoe, raw seasoned beef. Along with Hamhung naengmyeon, Mul naengmyeon, and gamja guksu (potato noodles) are common noodle dishes. Gamja makgari mandu is a dumpling made with ground potato.

The two mountainous, landlocked provinces border China to the north. Indian mustard leaves, called gat in Korean, are cultivated in place of Napa cabbage, a main kimchi ingredient, which does not grow well in the region due to poor geographic conditions. Indian mustard leaves have been eaten in spring and autumn as a main vegetable since ancient times, and are used for making gat kimchi to preserve for winter. Gat kimchi has a refreshing and aromatic flavor, which can be retained without loss of texture for a long time. Therefore, gat kimchi is the most famous food representing the provinces. On the other hand, potatoes are also harvested in abundance, so dishes made with potatoes are diversely developed, with up to 80 distinct potato dishes. Representative potato dishes include: gamja nongmal guksu, a noodle dish made with potato starch; gamja tteok, a variety of tteok made with ground potato; gamajatang jorim made by braising potatoes;, and gamja nongmal gangjeong, a fried confectionery made with potato starch. Gamja nongma guksu has a very strong chewy texture because the main ingredient is the potato starch. The noodles are seasoned with chopped green onions, garlic, sesame seeds, soy sauce, and a mixture of sesame seeds and salt. Slices of kimchi, marinated and steamed beef and pork, and shredded cucumbers are added as toppings on the noodles. A broth is served separately. Susutteok is a local specialty of Chagang province, made with locally produced sorghum, glutinous corn, soybeans, sesame seeds, and azuki beans. It is served with kimchi and namul (sauteed vegetables) collected from the mountains. Various foods made of sorghum can also be found in the province such as susu jijim (sorghum pancakes). In the province, there is a variety of mountain fruits.Í∞ïÍ≥ÑÎ©¥Ïò• ÎÉâÎ©¥ ÎßõÏù¥ ÏùºÌíà Tongil Shinmun Central region Hwanghae province Hwanghae province has been divided into South Hwanghae province and North Hwanghae province since 1954. Thanks to the wide Yonbaek and Chaenyong plains, Hwanghae province is a granary of North Korea and is known for its good quality cereal production.Seo, Hyeon-jin (ÏÑúÌòÑÏßÑ), (Jan. 1999)ÌÖåÎßàÏùåÏãù/Ïö∞Î¶¨ÎÇòÎùº 10ÈÅì 10Ëâ≤ Ìñ•ÌÜ†ÏùåÏãù Monthly Hotel & Restaurant As the millet seeds produced in the region are thick, and have a good taste, they are eaten as much as barley is consumed by people of the southern region. The abundant production of cereal crops provides quality feed for livestock, so the quality of meat produced in the region is said to be good. Chicken raised in every household is fleshy and of good quality, and is used for many dishes in Hwanghae cuisine. It is used as an ingredient for wheat noodle dishes, and mandu (dumplings). The coastal area, adjacent to the Yellow Sea, produces a lot of salt because the tideland in the area is developed and there is little rainfall. Due to the climate, kimchi in the Hwanghae region has a clear and refreshing taste, so its brine is used as a soup on many occasions. Dongchimi brine is used as a broth for naengmyeon (cold buckwheat noodle dish), or for mixing with a bowl of chilled rice to make a midnight snack. The Hwanghae people are known for kindheartedness and rustic simplicity, so their cuisine reflects their nature. Hwanghae dishes are savory and simple, with less decoration such as mandu made in a larger size than other regions. The general taste is moderate, similar to that of Chungcheong province. The most famous Hwanghae dish is Haeju bibimbap, originating in Haeju. It consists of fried rice with chopped pork, various namul (sauteed vegetables), and sliced chicken, unlike other bibimbap varieties. It uses black soy sauce on slightly fried and salted rice instead of Gochujang. Other typical main dishes are ssalbap (steamed rice), seariban (three steamed grains), japgokbap (various steamed grains), kimchibap (steamed rice with kimchi), and bijibap (rice with biji, residue in the preparation of tofu).

Typical main dishes are also based on potatoes and maize with various cooking methods such as Chuncheon dakgalbi, gangnaengi bap (a bowl of steamed corn and rice), makguksu (buckwheat noodle dish), patguksu (noodles in red bean soup), gamja ongsimi (potato dumpling soup), bangpungjuk (porridge made with Glehnia littoralis), gangnaengi beombeok (mashed boiled corn with grains), and gamja beombeok (mashed boiled potato with grains).

As Kaesong was the capital of Goryeo for almost 500 years, its culinary culture was highly developed. The luxurious style of Kaesong cuisine is frequently compared with those of Seoul and Jeolla. Kaesong cuisine was traditionally treated as part of Gyeonggi cuisine, since Kaesong belonged to Gyeonggi province until the Korean War. However, it was incorporated into the administration of North Korea after the war while Gyeonggi province is administered by South Korea. Bossam kimchi (wrapped kimchi), pyeonsu (summer mandu in square shape), sinseollo (royal casserole), seolleongtang (beef tripe soup), chueotang (mudfish soup), joraengi tteokguk (dumpling soup), umegi (tteok covered with syrup), and gyeongdan (ball-shaped tteok) are representative Kaesong dishes. Umegi, also called Kaesong juak, is a holiday food of Kaesong, and known for its delicate style with a sweet and nutty taste. The dish is made by kneading a mixture of rice flour and glutinous rice flour with warm water, then shaping the dough into balls with either one pine nut or jujube, then frying and coating them with syrup.

Gyeonggi province Map of Gyeonggi province Geographically, Gyeonggi province is located in the central region of the Korean peninsula. Until the Korean War it included Kaesong, the old capital of Goryeo. Mountain vegetables are obtained from those surrounding Seoul, while fish and seafood are harvested from the Yellow Sea, located to the west. In Gyeonggi cuisine, jeotgal (fermented salted seafood) is abundant, and among them jogijeot (made with croaker) and saeujeot (made with small shrimp) are often used as ingredients in kimchi. The climate is relatively mild, and various types of cereal crops are harvested, so dishes made with grain crops are especially developed. Ogokbap (steamed five cereal crops), and chalbap (steamed glutinous rice) are enjoyed as main dishes. Although the province borders Seoul, its cuisine is generally simple, and its flavors and use of seasonings are moderate except in Kaesong cuisine. Due to the sophisticated culinary culture, and diverse dishes, Kaesong's cuisine is often compared with Seoul's cuisine and Korean royal court cuisine. Since Gyeonggi province borders the provinces of Gangwon, Chungcheong, Hwanghae, the cuisine has much in common with the cuisines of these neighboring provinces, including flavors and naming conventions for dishes. Savory grain dishes are numerous, and include sujebi (dumpling soup), and beombeok (thick mixed-grain porridge). They are made with either pumpkin, potato, corn, wheat flour, or azuki beans. Noodle soups such as Jemul guksu (noodles in soybean paste soup), and memilkal ssakdugi (knife-cut noodle soup) also have a thick broth and a savory taste along with a soft texture in contrast with naeongmyeon in the clear dongchimi broth eaten in the northern region. Naengkongguk (soybean soup with dumplings) is also a common dish which is also a local specialty of Chungcheong and Hwanghae provinces.

Meals are served in small portions and include many dishes. Their cooking uses many seasonings, but the taste is not overly spicy. Typical main dishes include: seolleongtang (beef soup with rice), gukbap (soup with rice), tteokguk (rice cake soup), heukimjajuk (black sesame porridge), jatjuk (pine nut porridge), memil mandu (dumpling with a buckwheat covering), saengchi mandu (dumpling stuffed with pheasant meat), and pyeonsu (square-shaped mandu with vegetable filling). Among them, seolleongtang is the most widely known Seoul dish, and is also popular nationwide. It is said to be strongly associated with the Seonnongdan shrine in the neighborhood of Jegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul where the kings of Korea held an annual national ritual to pray for a good harvest. After the ritual everyone gathered to eat a beef soup together, which was made by boiling beef and its tripe in dozens of gamasots (cauldrons) with water. Representative Seoul soups or stews are: sinseollo (royal casserole), gaksaek jeongol (casserole made with various ingredients), yukgaejang (spicy beef soup with rice), Gujeolpan (nine-sectioned plate), galbijjim (braised meat short ribs), tteokjjim (boiled tteok, beef and vegetables), tteokbokki (stir-fried tteok and vegetables), braised dishes in soy sauce such as honghapcho and jeonbokcho respectively made with mussels and abalone, and gannap (beef liver pancake). Raw dishes such as gaphoe (seasoned raw beef tripe), gulhoe (raw oyster) are also part of Seoul cuisine. Pressed or dried dishes such as pyeonyuk made with ox's tongue or brisket, jokpyeon (gelatin), eochae (parboiled fish fillet), yukpo (beef jerky), suran (poached egg), sukju namul (sauteed mung bean spouts), mugeun namul bokkeum (sauteed dried various mountain vegetables), hobakseon (steamed stuffed zucchini), gimssam (wraps with gim, seaweed), maedeup jaban (fried kelp in a ribbon shape), are banchan representing Seoul cuisine. Gujeolpan and sinseollo especially demonstrate the sophisticated style of Seoul cuisine. Dried fish such as gulbi (dried salted yellow croaker), gwamegi (half-dried Pacific herring or Pacific saury), amchi (dried salted brown croaker) are grilled or pan-fried to make jeon, Korean style pancakes. Seoul cuisine has a lot of mitbanchan (basic side dishes made for preservation) such as yukpo (beef jerky), jeotgal (salted fermented seafood) and jangajji (pickles). Unique kimchi found in Seoul are jang kimchi (water kimchi seasoned with soy sauce,) and suk kkakdugi (kimchi made with parboiled radish). During the Joseon Dynasty, the villages of Bukchon and Namchon were referred to as \\"Namju Byukbyeong\\", which literally means \\"Namchon for alcoholic beverages, Bukchon for tteok\\" (rice cakes), because tteok were made on many occasions in Seoul. There are many tteok made with high-quality ingredients, that take a lot of work to produce, in Seoul cuisine such as danja. It is usually used as a decoration for other tteok and is shaped into a ball or a square after its dough is pounded and stuffed with a sweetened filling and covered with gomul (powder coating or sliced fruits). The danja varieties are made with jujube, Artemisia princeps var. orientalis (sunflower- like plant), chestnut, yuzu (a citrus fruit), Gingko seeds, gotgam (dried persimmon), Coix lacryma-jobi var. ma-yuen (a grain), and seogi (a lichen - Umbilicaria esculenta). Other typical tteok include: duteop tteok covered with azuki bean crumbles, sangchu tteok made with lettuce, gaksaekpyeon made by adding color or flavors, neuti tteok made with young leaves of Zelkova serrata, yaksik made with nuts and jujubes, hwajeon made with flower petals, juak made by pan-frying and honey-glazing, mulhobak tteok made with pumpkin, and solbangul tteok made with pine cones. Typical hangwa or Korean confectioneries are yakgwa, mandugwa, maejakgwa, and various types of yeotgangjeong and dasik. Both yakgwa and maejakgwa are fried pastries made with wheat flour and honey each having a distinctive shape and texture; the former with a flower pattern shape and a soft texture; the latter in a ribbon shape with a crispy texture. Mandugwa is a confectionery made by frying a dumpling filled with sweetened jujube. Yeotgangjeong, or taffy rice cracker, is covered with sesame seeds, peanuts, or ground pine nuts.Silkkae yeotgangjeong, ttangkong yeotgangjeong, baekjapyeon. Dasik is a pattern pressed cake eaten when drinking tea, made with black sesame seeds, soybean, pollen powders, chestnut, starch, rice or a mixture of wheat flour and honey.Heukimja dasik, kong dasik, songhwa dasik, bam dasik, jinmal dasik, nongmal dasik, ssal dasikTtuk, Hangwa Food in Korea Various hwachae (Korean punch) and teas are also part of Seoul cuisine. Hwachae is eaten cold and made with fruits (e.g. omija hwachae), edible flower petals (e.g. jindallae hwachae), tteok (e.g. wonsobyeong), steamed grains (e.g. bori sudan), or traditional medical ingredients. Examples of fruit teas are: yujacha, mogwacha, omijacha, gugijacha, and daechucha. On the other hand, typical herbal teas can be made with spices like ginger and cinnamon, herbs such as Ginseng radicle, Angelica, or grains such as Senna obtusifolia. At royal court, jehotang was considered the best summer drink. This cold drink is made with honey, water, and the powders of dried and roasted Prunus mume fruits, Amomi Semen, Sandalwood Red, and Amomum tsao-ko. Ogwacha, which literally means \\"five fruits\\", is made with walnuts, chestnuts, Gingko seeds, jujube, and ginger.

Although there are many differences between the two provinces' geographical conditions, the locals in both generally engage in agriculture as their primary occupation. The Yedang Plain, in the area adjacent to the Baengma River in South Chungcheong province provides an abundant harvest of grain crops, while the Yellow Sea is a good fishery. During the Three Kingdoms period of Korea (57 BC ‚Äì 668 AD), barley and millet were the respective main dishes for the Silla kingdom (57 BC‚Äì935) and the Goguryeo kingdom (37 BC‚Äì668), whereas rice was assumed to have been the main grain for the Baekje kingdom (18 BC‚Äì660).

While Kaesong cuisine, which retains the tradition of the Goryeo Dynasty, is very conservative, Jeolla cuisine preserves a unique culinary tradition that has been handed from Yangban (noble class) of the Joseon Dynasty. Jeolla region includes the fertile Honam Plain that provides an abundant harvest of rice. The Yellow Sea and East China Sea which are adjacent to the west and east offer a variety of seafood for the table.

The region has a similar climate to that of Jeolla province because both geographically border two seas‚ÄîGyeongsang province borders the Sea of Japan (East Sea) to the east, and the East China Sea to the south. However, the types of fish harvested are different. Fish are regarded as the best foodstuff in Gyeongsang cuisine. Seafood is variously cooked in the cuisine, and especially hoe (raw sliced seafood, is considered the best delicacy. Soups made with fresh fish are common in Gyeongsang province, unlike other mountainous and landlocked regions. Myeolchi jeot (fermented salted anchovies) is the most commonly prepared jeotgal (fermented salted seafood); the number of jeotgal-type dishes placed on the table for a meal is second only to those prepared in Jeolla province. The style of Gyeongsang cuisine is simple with less decoration, while various seasonings are used heavily, so the taste is even more salty and hot and spicy than Jeolla's. Diverse grains can be grown in the province and noodles are the most enjoyed dish among the foods made with grains. The locals prefer noodles with a soft texture made by mixing raw soybean powder, cut by a kitchen knife. Andong, a city that was once the center of Korea's Confucianist traditions, has a wide variety of local delicacies. Along with Andong jjimdak, it is the birthplace of heotjesabap (fake jesa food),http://www.hansik.org/zh/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?&fboardId;=1076 Andong soju, salted mackerel,http://www.hansik.org/zh/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?&fboardId;=1075 and a spicy variety of sikhye (a fermented rice drink).

Due to its lack of fresh water, paddy farming is only done on a small scale on the island. The cultivation of cereal crops such as millet, barnyard millet, buckwheat, and barley being the main feature of the island's agriculture. As a result, the traditional Jeju meal generally consists of japgokbap, which is a bowl of steamed multiple grains as a main dish, with various salted dried fish called jaban as banchan (side dishes), and a soup based on doenjang (soybean paste) such as baechuguk made with Napa cabbage, kongnipguk made with soybean leaves, or muguk made with radish. Jeju dishes are made with simple ingredients, and the taste is generally salty. Raw seafood called hoe is commonly consumed as a part of the meal. The warm weather affects Jeju's cuisine in that gimjang, preparing kimchi in late autumn for winter consumption, is not necessary there unlike in the other provinces. Only a small amount of kimchi is pickled by Jeju's locals. Representative main dishes in Jeju cuisine are porridge made with fish, seafood, seaweeds, or mushrooms. Examples include: jeonbokjuk made with abalone, okdomjuk made with Red tilefish, gejuk made with crabs, gingijuk made with small crabs called bangge (Helice tridens), maeyeoksae juk made with young wakame, and chogijuk made with shiitake.

Shepard High School is a public secondary school located in Palos Heights, Illinois. The school, along with Dwight D. Eisenhower High School and Harold L. Richards High School are part of Community High School District 218. Students who attend the school live in the communities of Palos Heights, Crestwood, Worth, Alsip, Robbins, and Calumet Park. The school is named in honor of Alan B. Shepard, the first American astronaut to travel into space. History As early as 1966, District 218 began looking for a site for a third high school. The school and local residents argued between two sites located on either side of the intersection of 120th Street and Pulaski Avenue in Alsip. In 1972, the district asked voters in the district to approve a bond issue to raise money for a new school to be located in Palos Heights. Most recently Alan B. Shepard high school has ranked 54th in Illinois and 2,062nd nationally. Academics In 2008, Shepard had an average composite ACT score of 19.7, and graduated 86.4% of its senior class. The school has not made Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) on the Prairie State Achievement Examination, which is the state assessment used to fulfill mandates of the federal No Child Left Behind Act. Overall, the school failed to meet minimum standards in reading and mathematics, in addition to having three of the school's four student subgroups fail to meet expectations in reading and mathematics. Student life Activities The school offers over 40 extracurricular clubs ranging from student publications and academic competitions to service and special interest clubs. Clubs which are chapters or affiliates of nationally notable organizations include Future Educators of America, Key Club, Leo Club, and Quill and Scroll. Extracurricular Success The School's extracurricular success overshadows that of their athletic success. The Shepard Marching Astros, Shepard Mathletes, Shepard Show Choir, and Shepard Speech Team have been the most successful in their respective domains. The most notable of which being the Shepard speech sending state qualifiers to the IHSA state tournament every year. The Team hosting six recent state champions including: Kirsten LaMantia in Special Occasion Speaking (2003) Jasmine Lockett in Original Oratory (2009) Amy Ramelli in Original Comedy (2010) Leah Ellis in Special Occasions Speaking (2011) Glorielle Williams in Poetry Reading (2012) Lindsie Bliss in Informative Speaking (2014). Athletics Shepard competes in the South Suburban Conference and is a member of the Illinois High School Association (IHSA); the organization which governs most sports and competitive activities in the state. Teams are stylized as the Astros (for men) and Lady Astros (for women). The school sponsors interscholastic teams for young men and women in basketball, bowling, cross country, soccer, swimming & diving, tennis, track & field, volleyball, and water polo. Young men may compete in baseball, football, golf, wrestling while young women may compete in badminton, cheerleading, and softball. While not sponsored by the IHSA, the school also sponsors a poms team for young women. The school's badminton team is the only athletic team to place in the top four of their IHSA sponsored state tournament, placing third twice (1979‚Äì80, 1991‚Äì92) and second twice (1990‚Äì91, 1997‚Äì98).

The school originally housed both Bartlett High School, named after U.S. Senator Bob Bartlett, and Begich Junior High School, named after U.S. Representative Nick Begich. Bartlett is part of the Anchorage School District and is accredited by the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges. Its attendance area is northeast Anchorage and Elmendorf Air Force Base, and approximately 25% of its students are military dependents. The student body is racially and ethnically diverse. About 43.7% of the students are white, 18.9% are black, 6.1% are Hispanic, 13.5% are Asian/Pacific Islander, and 17.8% are American Indian/Alaska Native. The school district's 2003-2004 Profile of Performance reported three goals: \\"Improve school climate\\" (attained), \\"increase percentage of students passing HSGQE Math by 5%\\" (partially attained) and \\"reduce dropout rate\\" (attained).

It was listed as a Michigan Historic Site on October 2, 1980 and added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 31, 1984. The house is significant as one of the oldest authentic structures in Michigan ‚Äî having undergone very little modifications since it was first built. History Edward Loranger was born in Trois-Rivi√®res, Canada in 1796. He moved to Michigan in 1816, and in 1822 purchased the land on which this house is now located. He became one of the most prominent landowners and architects in early Monroe County, and constructed many buildings in the area. This house was built in 1825. Loranger married Marianne Navarre In 1826, and the couple had five children. Loranger died in 1887. (note: large pdf file) The house fell into disrepair over the years but was restored in 1941. It was during this restoration that the dormers were added to the roof. The house remains privately owned. Description The Edward Loranger House is a 1¬Ω story, red brick gabled farmhouse on the banks of Stoney Creek about five miles (8 km) north of Monroe and three miles (4.8 km) south of the village of Carleton. The house is a fairly simple and common French-Canadian-style house with no exterior decor. A single-story addition, constructed in 1861, is connected to the rear. The house is rectangular, and symmetrical in plan, with a center entrance with windows on each side; the windows are six-over-six double hing units, and have stone lintels and sills. A chimney is located at each gable end. It sits on a stone foundation. The house originally had two rooms and an attic inside. The wall separating the two rooms constructed of brique en poteaux, meaning brick placed between vertical posts. This was an early French-Canadian construction technique. There are two more rooms in the 1861 addition. The property also includes five outbuildings - a brick smokehouse, a barn, a playhouse, and two storage buildings. Loranger also constructed a gristmill and sawmill on his property. These have since been moved to The Henry Ford.

Doodh pati is different from saada chai, in that it only uses milk (as opposed to water) and tea. This tea is quite common in South Asia. It is marginally costlier than the regular, water- based saada chai. Etymology and terminology In many Indo-Aryan languages, chai or cha is the word for tea. This comes from the Persian ⁄Üÿß€å chay, which originated from the Chinese word for tea Ëå∂ ch√°. Doodh means milk and pati means leaf. Therefore, the term, Doodh pati chai literally means milk leaf tea. Preparation One preparation method is to add water to a pot and leaving it to a boil along with various spices such as green cardamom, ginger, black cardamom, cinnamon, black peppercorns, black cloves, fennel seeds, nutmeg, dried ginger powder, as well as saffron in the upper to middle classes. Once the water and spices come to a boil, tea is added to it. The mixture is then left to brew. Full cream milk is then added to the mixture and it is then stewed for long periods of time to infuse. Sugar is often added as per one's taste. After mixing thoroughly on low heat, a tea strainer is used before serving the chai. It is usually poured into cups but some prefer to drink it the old fashioned way, from the edge of a saucer. Consumption Doodh pati is famously consumed in northern India, where it is boiled along with cardamom, ginger and many other whole spices listed above. Typically, it is available at roadside dhabas and chaiwalas at street corners, but is most commonly prepared at home, though less so than its water based alternative. It is mainly consumed in North India and Pakistan, though it is also consumed occasionally in Nepal and Bangladesh and has spread even to the Middle East due to its popularity. Doodh pati is also often served at roadside Dhabas and Chaiwalas all over South Asia. . It is also consumed during leisure time after a hectic day.

It acquires its shape by first being fashioned as warm sugar into flat strips. A strip is then folded back and forth over itself to form a hardened ribboned stick. The sugar is often colored to appear festive, and the candy often has a glossy sheen. It is commonly made with extracts, often of different mint or citrus flavors. It is usually thin enough to melt quickly in the mouth, but because pieces of it are usually larger than bite size, biting into a stick of it causes shattering and shards. Many types of ribbon candies also tend to become sticky easily, usually either due to body warmth from being held, or simply from room temperature and humidity. It is often used like decor, put out on display in candy dishes, plates, or apothecary jars. When it is used in this way it tends to end up sticking together if it has been sitting out for an extended period of time.How Ribbon Candy is made ribbon candy recipe  History  Ribbon candy is a traditional Christmas candy that goes back for centuries in Europe, though it is unclear exactly where the candy was first created. Confectioners developed the candy as a Christmas decoration for their shops, modeling the wavy form around the candy maker‚Äôs thumb. In the 1800s mechanical crimpers were invented to shape the ribbons. Finger-like crimpers simulated the curl originally put into the candy by hand. A candy maker made the candy, another spun off a ribbon and fed it into a crimper which was then turned by hand. Finally, the curly ribbon was cut with scissors as it came down a small conveyor. Mechanical crimpers worked well, but the process was slow and very labor-intensive. As demand increased for ribbon candy, it became clear that another way to make the candy had to be found. Until the 1940s ribbon candy was never made on a large scale, because more sophisticated equipment was needed. A single spinning roll was developed and it was found that by very careful tending of the candy batch, the hand spinner could be eliminated and the automated machine could run faster. The big bottleneck was in having to cut the candy with scissors. An air activated automatic cutter was invented by Sevigny Candy and is still in use today by F. B. Washburn Candy, which purchased Sevigny Candy in June 1986.http://www.fbwashburncandy.com/about.php References American confectionery Candy ","title":"Ribbon candy"},{"id":"25140188","text":"Billy Costa (born December 24, 1951) is an American radio and television host in the Boston area.

For a finite (or more generally compact) set of matrices \\\\mathcal M=\\\\\\\\{A_1,\\\\dots, A_m\\\\\\\\} \\\\subset \\\\mathbb R^{n \\\\times n}, the joint spectral radius is defined as follows: : \\\\rho (\\\\mathcal M)= \\\\lim_{k \\\\to \\\\infty}\\\\max{\\\\\\\\{ \\\\A_{i_1}\\\\cdots A_{i_k}\\\\^{1/k}:A_i\\\\in\\\\mathcal M\\\\\\\\}}. \\\\, It can be proved that the limit exists and that the quantity actually does not depend on the chosen matrix norm (this is true for any norm but particularly easy to see if the norm is sub-multiplicative). The joint spectral radius was introduced in 1960 by Gian-Carlo Rota and Gilbert Strang,G. C. Rota and G. Strang. \\"A note on the joint spectral radius.\\" Proceedings of the Netherlands Academy, 22:379‚Äì381, 1960. two mathematicians from MIT, but started attracting attention with the work of Ingrid Daubechies and Jeffrey Lagarias.Vincent D. Blondel. The birth of the joint spectral radius: an interview with Gilbert Strang. Linear Algebra and its Applications, 428:10, pp. 2261‚Äì2264, 2008. They showed that the joint spectral radius can be used to describe smoothness properties of certain wavelet functions.I. Daubechies and J. C. Lagarias. \\"Two-scale difference equations. ii. local regularity, infinite products of matrices and fractals.\\" SIAM Journal of Mathematical Analysis, 23, pp. 1031‚Äì1079, 1992. A wide number of applications have been proposed since then. It is known that the joint spectral radius quantity is NP-hard to compute or to approximate, even when the set \\\\mathcal M consists of only two matrices with all nonzero entries of the two matrices which are constrained to be equal.J. N. Tsitsiklis and V. D. Blondel. \\"Lyapunov Exponents of Pairs of Matrices, a Correction.\\" Mathematics of Control, Signals, and Systems, 10, p. 381, 1997. Moreover, the question \\"\\\\rho\\\\leq 1 ?\\" is an undecidable problem.Vincent D. Blondel, John N. Tsitsiklis. \\"The boundedness of all products of a pair of matrices is undecidable.\\" Systems and Control Letters, 41:2, pp. 135-140, 2000. Nevertheless, in recent years much progress has been done on its understanding, and it appears that in practice the joint spectral radius can often be computed to satisfactory precision, and that it moreover can bring interesting insight in engineering and mathematical problems. Computation Approximation algorithms In spite of the negative theoretical results on the joint spectral radius computability, methods have been proposed that perform well in practice. Algorithms are even known, which can reach an arbitrary accuracy in an a priori computable amount of time. These algorithms can be seen as trying to approximate the unit ball of a particular vector norm, called the extremal norm.N. Barabanov. \\"Lyapunov indicators of discrete inclusions i-iii.\\" Automation and Remote Control, 49:152‚Äì157, 283‚Äì287, 558‚Äì565, 1988. One generally distinguishes between two families of such algorithms: the first family, called polytope norm methods, construct the extremal norm by computing long trajectories of points.V. Y. Protasov. \\"The joint spectral radius and invariant sets of linear operators.\\" Fundamentalnaya i prikladnaya matematika, 2(1):205‚Äì231, 1996.N. Guglielmi, F. Wirth, and M. Zennaro. \\"Complex polytope extremality results for families of matrices.\\" SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 27(3):721‚Äì743, 2005. An advantage of these methods is that in the favorable cases it can find the exact value of the joint spectral radius and provide a certificate that this is the exact value. The second family of methods approximate the extremal norm with modern optimization techniques, such as ellipsoid norm approximation,Vincent D. Blondel, Yurii Nesterov and Jacques Theys, On the accuracy of the ellipsoid norm approximation of the joint spectral radius, Linear Algebra and its Applications, 394:1, pp. 91‚Äì107, 2005. semidefinite programming,T. Ando and M.-H. Shih. \\"Simultaneous contractibility.\\" SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 19(2):487‚Äì498, 1998.V. D. Blondel and Y. Nesterov. \\"Computationally efficient approximations of the joint spectral radius.\\" SIAM Journal of Matrix Analysis, 27(1):256‚Äì272, 2005. Sum Of Squares,P. Parrilo and A. Jadbabaie. \\"Approximation of the joint spectral radius using sum of squares.\\" Linear Algebra and its Applications, 428(10):2385‚Äì2402, 2008. and conic programming.V. Protasov, R. M. Jungers, and V. D. Blondel. \\"Joint spectral characteristics of matrices: a conic programming approach.\\" SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications, 2008. The advantage of these methods is that they are easy to implement, and in practice, they provide in general the best bounds on the joint spectral radius. The finiteness conjecture Related to the computability of the joint spectral radius is the following conjecture:J. C. Lagarias and Y. Wang. \\"The finiteness conjecture for the generalized spectral radius of a set of matrices.\\" Linear Algebra and its Applications, 214:17‚Äì42, 1995. \\"For any finite set of matrices \\\\mathcal M \\\\subset \\\\mathbb R^{n \\\\times n}, there is a product A_1\\\\dots A_t of matrices in this set such that :\\\\rho(\\\\mathcal M) = \\\\rho(A_1 \\\\dots A_t)^{1/t}.\\" In the above equation \\" \\\\rho(A_1 \\\\dots A_t)\\" refers to the classical spectral radius of the matrix A_1 \\\\dots A_t. This conjecture, proposed in 1995, has been proved to be false in 2003,.T. Bousch and J. Mairesse. \\"Asymptotic height optimization for topical IFS, Tetris heaps, and the finiteness conjecture.\\" Journal of the American Mathematical Society, 15(1):77‚Äì111, 2002. The counterexample provided in that reference uses advanced measure-theoretical ideas. Subsequently, many other counterexamples have been provided, including an elementary counterexample that uses simple combinatorial properties matrices V. D. Blondel, J. Theys and A. A. Vladimirov, An elementary counterexample to the finiteness conjecture, SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis, 24:4, pp. 963‚Äì970, 2003. and a counterexample based on dynamical systems properties.V. Kozyakin Structure of Extremal Trajectories of Discrete Linear Systems and the Finiteness Conjecture, Automat. Remote Control, 68 (2007), no. 1, 174‚Äì209/ Recently an explicit counterexample has been proposed in.Kevin G. Hare, Ian D. Morris, Nikita Sidorov, Jacques Theys. An explicit counterexample to the Lagarias‚ÄìWang finiteness conjecture, Advances in Mathematics, 226, pp. 4667-4701, 2011. Many questions related to this conjecture are still open, as for instance the question of knowing whether it holds for pairs of binary matrices.A. Cicone, N. Guglielmi, S. Serra Capizzano, and M. Zennaro. \\"Finiteness property of pairs of 2 √ó 2 sign-matrices via real extremal polytope norms.\\" Linear Algebra and its Applications, 2010.R. M. Jungers and V. D. Blondel. \\"On the finiteness property for rational matrices.\\" Linear Algebra and its Applications, 428(10):2283‚Äì2295, 2008. Applications The joint spectral radius was introduced for its interpretation as a stability condition for discrete-time switching dynamical systems. Indeed, the system defined by the equations :x_{t+1}=A_tx_{t}, \\\\quad A_t\\\\in \\\\mathcal M \\\\, \\\\forall t is stable if and only if \\\\rho(\\\\mathcal M)<1. The joint spectral radius became popular when Ingrid Daubechies and Jeffrey Lagarias showed that it rules the continuity of certain wavelet functions. Since then, it has found many applications, ranging from number theory to information theory, autonomous agents consensus, combinatorics on words,... Related notions The joint spectral radius is the generalization of the spectral radius of a matrix for a set of several matrices. However, much more quantities can be defined when considering a set of matrices: The joint spectral subradius characterizes the minimal rate of growth of products in the semigroup generated by \\\\mathcal M. The p-radius characterizes the rate of growth of the L_p average of the norms of the products in the semigroup. The Lyapunov exponent of the set of matrices characterizes the rate of growth of the geometric average.

He was known as Hon. Robert Seymour-Conway until 1793, when his father was created a marquess; he then became Lord Robert Seymour-Conway, but dropped the surname of Conway after his father's death in 1794. Seymour was the third son of Francis Seymour-Conway, 1st Marquess of Hertford. Educated at Eton, he was commissioned an ensign in the 40th Regiment of Foot in 1766, and became a lieutenant in the 2nd Regiment of Irish Horse the same year. In 1770, he became a captain in the 8th Dragoons. Seymour-Conway was returned for two Parliamentary seats in 1771: Lisburn, in the Parliament of Ireland, and the family borough of Orford in the British House of Commons. In 1773, he became a major in the 3rd Irish Horse. A miniature, possibly portraying the three children of Lord Robert Seymour, by Jeanne Doucet de Surigny before 1807 By his first marriage, on 15 June 1773 to Anne Delm√©, daughter of MP Peter Delm√©, Seymour-Conway had five children: *Elizabeth Seymour (1775 - 23 February 1848), married first William Griffith Davies (1762-1814), on 10 December 1805, married second Herbert Evans (d. 1843) on 2 May 1817 *Henry Seymour (c.1776 - 13 February 1843), married Hon. Emily Byng (d. 1824), daughter of George Byng, 4th Viscount Torrington, on 1 July 1800 *Frances Isabella Seymour (d. 3 June 1838), married George FitzRoy, 2nd Baron Southampton *Anna Maria Seymour (22 September 1781 - ?) *Gertrude Hussey Carpenter Seymour (28 July 1784 - 3 January 1825), married John Hensleigh Allen on 12 November 1812 Seymour-Conway transferred into the 1st Foot Guards as a Captain-Lieutenant on 7 November 1775, and became captain of a company in the regiment on 30 January 1776. He gave up his seat at Lisburn that year, but continued to sit for Orford. He served as an aide-de-camp to Sir Henry Clinton in America from 1780 to 1781, but resigned his commission in 1782. Plas Taliaris Mansion, Seymour bought the house in 1787 In Parliament, Seymour-Conway followed the rest of his family in supporting the North Ministry and the Fox-North Coalition, and opposing the ministry of Shelburne. In 1784, he turned over the Orford seat to his younger brother George, having purchased a seat at Wootton Bassett from Henry St John, who managed it. In 1787, he bought the estate of Taliaris in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, which would become his principal seat. He left his Commons seat in 1790, the year that he and his brother Henry were granted, for life, the sinecures of joint prothonotary, clerk of the crown, filazer, and keeper of the declarations of the King's Bench in Ireland. By 1816, these offices brought an income of more than ¬£10,000 a year. He returned to Parliament for Orford in 1794, and continued to hold the seat until 1807. He took some interest in agriculture, as in 1796, he invented a new one-horse cart. On 2 December 1803, he was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the 2nd Battalion, Carmarthenshire Volunteers. He resigned that command on 6 January 1808. After the death of his wife Anne, Seymour made a second marriage, on 2 May 1806, to Hon. Anderlechtia Clarissa Chetwynd (d. 1855), daughter of William Chetwynd, 4th Viscount Chetwynd, but they had no children. During the 1807 election, Seymour was returned both for Orford and Carmarthenshire, choosing to sit for the latter, which he represented until 1820. On 1 July 1807, Seymour, who owned a house in Portland Place, was sworn a Justice of the Peace for Middlesex. He took an active role in civic affairs in London, and was for some time Director of the Poor for his parish of St Marylebone. This included a particular interest in the care and treatment of the insane, culminating in his appointment in 1827 to the commission superintending the building of Hanwell Asylum and as a Metropolitan Commissioner in Lunacy in 1828. However, he was now approaching the end of his life and played little active role as a Lunatic Commissioner. In 1829, Seymour funded the building of the north transept and a vicarage for Taliaris Chapel.

The two teams are called \\"cross-river rivals.\\" This is because Madison Square Garden in Midtown Manhattan, where the Rangers play, is across the Hudson River and less than 10 miles from the Prudential Center in downtown Newark (and previously, the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford), the home of the Devils. Travel between both arenas is easily accomplished by both road (usually through the Lincoln Tunnel) and rail (along the Northeast Corridor and PATH). The Devils and Rangers are two of the three teams that play in the New York City metropolitan area, the other being the New York Islanders. All three teams have fierce, bitter rivalries with each other, as well as with the other (now formerly) Atlantic Division teams, the Philadelphia Flyers and Pittsburgh Penguins. History Early history The rivalry began in 1982 when the Colorado Rockies moved to New Jersey to become the Devils. For the relocation, they were required to pay massive indemnities to the Rangers, New York Islanders and Philadelphia Flyers, geographically-proximate teams, for the right to share New Jersey market. For over 35 years, fans of both the Rangers and Devils have seen the best out of both their clubs whenever they meet. Despite the Devils' overall Stanley Cup playoff superiority since the 1990s, the first three playoff series between these teams were all Rangers victories. Their first playoff meeting occurred during the 1992 Stanley Cup playoffs, when the Presidents' Trophy-winning Rangers survived a seven-game Patrick Division Semifinals series with the Devils. Stanley Cup championships of 1994 and 1995 The rivalry's most famous moments, however, are centered around the significance of the teams' meetings during the and seasons. =1994: Rangers win Stanley Cup= Although both teams were the top point-getters in the NHL during the Rangers' championship season of 1993‚Äì94 (the Presidents' Trophy-winning Rangers netting 112 and the Devils notching 106), the story entering the Eastern Conference Finals was the Rangers' 6‚Äì0 record against New Jersey that regular season. In the final weeks of the regular season, the Devils were chasing the Rangers for the best record in the NHL. In response, the New York news media pushed Rangers Head Coach Mike Keenan to push the Rangers to winning the Presidents' Trophy as the League's top regular season team. Keenan replied, \\"I want to play Game 7 of the Stanley Cup (Finals) in Madison Square Garden.\\" The Rangers reached the Conference Finals with relative ease by sweeping their crosstown rivals, the Islanders, and beating the Washington Capitals in five games. In comparison, the Devils' road was much harder, as they needed all seven games to oust the Buffalo Sabres in the first round and needed six games to eliminate the Boston Bruins in the Conference Semifinals. However, all ideas of a quick New York series were soon ended after Game 1, a 4‚Äì3 double overtime victory that was sealed by the Devils' Stephane Richer. The Rangers responded by routing the Devils 4‚Äì0 in Game 2, and used a double overtime goal by Stephane Matteau to take a 2‚Äì1 lead after Game 3. After being routed in Games 4 and 5, the Rangers faced elimination in New Jersey for Game 6, with the Devils attempting to make the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history. Prior to the game, Rangers captain Mark Messier guaranteed a victory in Game 6 at the Meadowlands; with the Rangers down 2‚Äì0 to the Devils, Messier scored a hat- trick to tie the series at 3‚Äì3 and send it back to New York for the deciding Game 7. In Game 7, the Devils' Valeri Zelepukin tied the game with 7.7 seconds left in regulation, but thanks to another Stephane Matteau goal in double overtime, the Rangers won the series and ultimately went on to win the Stanley Cup over the Vancouver Canucks, also in seven games. The first six games were won by the team that lost that respective game in 1992. That trend, however, was reversed when the Rangers won Game 7 in 1994. =1995: Devils win Stanley Cup= The Devils recovered from the crushing defeat to the Rangers in 1994 to win the Stanley Cup the following year in a shocking and improbable sweep of the Detroit Red Wings, though they had to go through another of their own rivals (also a great rival of the Rangers) in that year's Eastern Conference Finals, the Philadelphia Flyers, who had eliminated the Rangers in the second round, making the rivalry during the showdowns between the Stanley Cup champions of the previous two seasons. When both teams won the Stanley Cup in their respective seasons, the Stanley Cup was awarded on their side of the Hudson River (Rangers won at Madison Square Garden in 1994, the Devils at the Meadowlands in 1995). The Devils did not have home ice advantage during their Finals. In fact, they were the first team to win the Stanley Cup without having home ice advantage in any of the four rounds of the playoffs. 1997 playoffs The third Devils-Rangers playoff series occurred just three years later. The Rangers, led by Mark Messier, Wayne Gretzky and Mike Richter, eliminated the Devils in the 1997 Eastern Conference Semifinals, winning four games in a row after losing Game 1. In game 5, Adam Graves scored an overtime wraparound goal to give the Rangers the series win. New Jersey was limited to just five goals in the five-game series, including two shutout losses. 1998‚Äì2006 From the start of 1998, however, rivalry momentum began to shift in favor of the Devils. New Jersey dominated New York during the regular season in the late 1990s and early 2000s. At one point, the Devils had an unbeaten streak against the Rangers throughout 23 regular season games going 15‚Äì0‚Äì8, starting on February 17, 1997, and ending March 31, 2001, an undefeated streak spanning four years. At the end of the , the Devils had won 11 games straight ‚Äî the second such streak of the season ‚Äî and capped off the run by winning the Atlantic Division in comeback fashion against the Montreal Canadiens, a division win made all the more exciting by the fact that the Devils had been 22 points out of the lead just three months prior, with many thinking the team wouldn't make the 2006 playoffs. Meanwhile, the Rangers had the division lead for most of the latter part of the season, but fell victim to a losing skid as the season came to a close. The Devils took the Division title away from the Rangers by ending the season with one more point than New York. As fate would have it, the white-hot Devils met the Rangers in their fourth playoff meeting in the 2006 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. The result was a four-game sweep by New Jersey over their cross-river rivals for the first time ever in franchise history. 2007‚Äì2011 Sean Avery distracts Martin Brodeur during Game 3 of the 2008 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. Two years later, the teams would meet yet again in the playoffs for the fifth time, in the 2008 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. After long-time Devil Scott Gomez signed as a free agent with the Rangers prior to the , he has been severely booed by Devils fans at the Prudential Center every time he touched the puck. Gomez responded by scoring three assists in Game 1 and two goals in Game 4 against his former team en route to a Rangers series win. In Game 3, Ranger Sean Avery used a tactic to screen opposing goaltender Martin Brodeur. While essentially ignoring the play on the ice when his team had a two-man advantage, Avery faced Brodeur and waved his hands and stick in front of him in an attempt to distract him and block his view. Although not illegal, many NHL commentators and players described Avery's actions as inappropriate. The following day, the NHL issued an interpretation of the league's unsportsmanlike conduct rule to cover actions such as the one employed by Avery. Following the Rangers victory in Game 5 of the series during the hand- shake line, Brodeur shook the hand of every Ranger except Avery. When asked what happened after the game, Avery said, \\"Well, everyone talks about how classy or un-classy I am, and fatso [Brodeur] there just forgot to shake my hand I guess. . . We outplayed him. I outplayed him. We‚Äôre going to the second round.\\" That year in the regular season, Avery slid into Brodeur. Brodeur retaliated by shoving Avery, who shoved back and a brawl occurred. During the , there was a moment of peace in the rivalry with both captains, Rangers' Chris Drury and Devils' Jamie Langenbrunner, winning silver medals as members the Team USA during the Vancouver Olympics. However, the rivalry was revived because both head coaches, the Rangers' John Tortorella and the Devils' Jacques Lemaire, were on different team's benches ‚Äî Tortorella was an assistant coach for the Americans, while Lemaire was with Team Canada, which ultimately took home gold over the U.S. The Rangers won four of six meetings between the two teams in the , and won the last meeting of the season to make the playoffs. Hours after the Rangers beat the Devils 5‚Äì2 in their last game of the regular season on April 9, the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Carolina Hurricanes 6‚Äì2 to help the Rangers reach the 2011 playoffs. Both teams were in opposite directions during the season. The Rangers finished 44‚Äì33‚Äì5, while the Devils finished the season under .500 for the first time since the , with a record of 38‚Äì39‚Äì5 and missed the playoffs. 2012 Conference Finals: \\"The Rematch\\" The Devils‚ÄìRangers series debuted at its latest date since the Devils moved to New Jersey in 1982 during the . For the previous six seasons, the teams had met at least once in October. In two of the first three meetings of the teams, there have been fights to start the game, which included the third game of the year, were two fights immediately broke-out after the first face-off. Also in the third game, there was a controversial call that negated a goal by the Rangers' Derek Stepan due to alleged goaltender interference by Marian Gaborik. Some argue that Gaborik was pushed into the goalie, Brodeur, by ex-Devil Anton Volchenkov, while others argue that the forward did not make an effort to avoid the goaltender, therefore legitimizing the penalty. The Devils and Rangers met for their final contest of the season on March 19, 2012, at Madison Square Garden. Continuing the trend established in prior games, the game began with three simultaneous fights, and the Rangers went on to win the game, 4‚Äì2. With the Devils defeating rival Philadelphia in five games, and the Rangers defeating Washington in seven, the stage had been set for a rematch of the 1994 Eastern Conference Finals between the two in the Eastern Conference Finals. With the exception of Games 1 and 2, the remainder of the series was played on the 18th anniversary of each game of the 1994 Conference Finals series between the two, and the pattern of wins from Games 3 to 5 were identical to that of 1994. This pattern was broken when the Devils won Game 6, 3‚Äì2, in overtime on Adam Henrique's game-winner, securing the Devils' first trip to the Stanley Cup Finals since their championship season of . However, the Devils would eventually lose the Cup in six games to the Los Angeles Kings. 2012‚Äìpresent The began with a labor lockout due to the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA)'s expiration, with the players and owners struggling to agree on new terms. Although the League's All-Star Game, Winter Classic and almost half of the regular season was lost due to work stoppage, the parties finally agreed to new terms in early 2013 to begin the season in late January. New Jersey won the first game between the two teams, though the Rangers won the remaining three. The Rangers' 4‚Äì1 victory on April 21 at home officially ended the Devils' hopes to reach the playoffs that season, despite making the Finals the previous year. In the , the two teams squared off in an outdoor game in Yankees Stadium. After taking a 3‚Äì1 lead in the game, the Devils eventually imploded and lost the game 7‚Äì3. Throughout the season, New York won two out of five meetings between them that year, while the Devils missed the playoffs for the second year in a row, which had not happened since 1987. The Rangers, on the other hand, finally made it to the Finals, which they had not done since 1994. However, New York lost to the Los Angeles Kings, who won their second Cup in three seasons. In the first half of the , the Rangers took both meetings between the teams. The first one was a come-from-behind, 4‚Äì3 road victory in overtime, while the second was a 3‚Äì1 win at the Garden, extending the team's win streak over New Jersey to six consecutive games. On February 22, 2018, the two teams made their first trade together when the Rangers sent Michael Grabner to the Devils in exchange for Yegor Rykov and a second-round pick in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. In the draft lottery for the 2019 NHL Entry Draft, the Devils received the first, while the Rangers the second overall pick. The Devils selected Jack Hughes, while the Rangers selected Kaapo Kakko. This was seen as a new chapter in the rivalry between the teams. Reaction Brandon Dubinsky and Martin Brodeur during their teams' matchup in the 2008 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals Fans on both sides have agreed the rivalry has become even stronger as of late, due in large part to the fact that both teams have shown much more parity towards each other. Many hockey analysts within the media have referred to them as \\"mirror teams\\" given their many similarities. Since the 2004‚Äì05 NHL lockout, the two teams have met a total of 43 times (as of March 25, 2010), including playoff games. Many Rangers fans have been seen burning Devils memorabilia after Rangers' victories over the Devils, and lighting their cigarettes with it, while exiting Madison Square Garden. Devils fans, meanwhile, enjoy making confetti which reads \\"Rangers suck\\" and handing them out during games formerly at the Continental Airlines Arena and currently at the Prudential Center. The Devils' fans also have a cheer that is yelled and whistled at every game. In response to the \\"Let's go band\\"/\\"Potvin sucks\\" chant of Rangers fans against the Islanders, the Devils fans at the Prudential Center cheer \\"Rangers Suck\\" (and more recently immediately followed with, \\"Flyers Swallow\\"). This chant, just like the Potvin chant being heard whether the Rangers are playing the Islanders or not, is heard at every Devils' home game. The Rangers‚ÄìDevils rivalry is popular among fans due to its geographic proximity, which is seen as a battle between the neighboring states of New York and New Jersey. Travel ease allows fans to typically follow their respective team across the Hudson to view away games. Fans of both teams have also shown considerable hostility towards each other's goaltender. Rangers fans had often battered former Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur with sarcastic chants of \\"Marty! Marty! Marty!\\" after goals scored on him during games between the two teams. Conversely, Devils fans would chant \\"Henrik! Henrik! Henrik!\\" at former Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist after the Devils scored on him. Recently, there have been parting shots taken by players and media at each organization through written words. In Beyond the Crease, an autobiography written by Martin Brodeur, he writes, \\"I hate the Rangers, and Lou hates them to death.\\" During their last playoff meet, actor/director Kevin Smith was asked to have a blog commenting on the series, which could be read on the NHL's official website. After Game 3, he wrote: > No Devils fan can truly pinpoint why we hate our cross-river rivals as much > as we do. Even so, Devils fans live to hate the Rangers. Sometimes, it feels > like a large cross-section of those folks in the stands at the Rock (and > formerly at the Meadowlands) aren't there so much to love on the Devils as > they are to hate on New York. Even when the boys in blue aren't anywhere > near the building, we're still seething about their very existence. You'd > think we'd hold a special place in our hearts for the Rangers, as they gave > us our first ever win back in 1982. Granted, they don't roll over for us as > much as Philly does (except, y'know ‚Äì in that last game this season), but > the Rangers've been hoisted up high on the Devils' pitchfork enough times > (the '06 four-zip playoffs come to mind) to warrant at least a degree of > affection right? In popular culture This rivalry was satirized in pop culture with the Seinfeld episode \\"The Face Painter\\" in which David Puddy, a hard-core Devils fan, paints his face red at a playoff game against the Rangers at the Garden, much to the embarrassment of Jerry, Kramer and Elaine.

The band have released six full-length studio albums to date. The band's sixth full-length album Stare Into Death And Be Still was released on 24 April 2020 on Debemur Morti Productions. The band have been featured in numerous articles as one of New Zealand's most prominent extreme metal acts, have toured widely across North America and Europe, and have been compared favourably to bands such as Neurosis and Gorguts. The band's sound has been described as \\"nauseating, disorienting and gleefully disharmonic\\", and is characterised by extremely technical death metal with extensive use of dissonance, time signature changes, and complex song structures. History Early days (2000-2005) The core membership of Ulcerate, including Jamie Saint Merat, Michael Hoggard and Mark Seeney, formed in 2000 under the name \\"Bloodwreath\\". In early 2002, guitarist Jared Commerer and vocalist James Wallace were added to the line-up while Seeney departed. The band began writing material for its debut recording, Demo 2003, and changed its name to Ulcerate prior to its release. In 2004, the band released its second demo, The Coming of Genocide. Both demos were subsequently compiled and released by The Flood Records and Deepsend Records under the title The Coming of Genocide. Of Fracture and Failure and Everything is Fire (2006-2009) In early 2006, Ulcerate signed with Neurotic Records. Vocalist James Wallace left the band in 2006 as the band was preparing to record its first full-length album, Of Fracture and Failure. Ben Read was recruited to fill the vacant vocal position. In contrast with Wallace's lower-pitched growls, Read relied on higher-pitched screams, reminiscent of hardcore vocals. Jared Commerer also left the band and was replaced by guitarist Michael Rothwell. Of Fracture and Failure was recorded and mixed by Jamie Saint Merat and Michael Hoggard. It was mastered by Alan Douches at West West Side Studios, New York, USA. The album artwork was created by Jamie Saint Merat. In 2008, Read and Rothwell departed the band, with Oliver Goater recruited as Ulcerate's new guitarist and bassist Paul Kelland assuming vocal duties. Kelland's approach returned the band to a lower-pitched vocal style. Ulcerate then started writing and recording its second full-length album, Everything Is Fire. The album was acknowledged by critics for its unique approach to death metal, with Allmusic's Phil Freeman praising Everything Is Fire for incorporating the \\"percussive intricacy of Isis\\", \\"intricate scaffold of jagged, art-metal guitar\\", and use of repetition that was closer to Shellac than Suffocation. The Destroyers of All and Vermis (2010-2014) In April 2010, Ulcerate announced that it was writing songs for a new album. Oliver Goater parted ways with Ulcerate in late 2010, and was replaced by William Cleverdon. The band released its third full-length album, The Destroyers of All, on 25 January 2011, through Willowtip Records. The album was released only \\"as the core 3 writing members,\\" and did not feature Oliver Goater who left the band prior to the recording of the album.http://bravewords.com/news/ulcerate-part-ways-with-live-guitarist-the- destroyers-of-all-album-artwork-and-release-date-revealed-track-available-for- download The band toured across Europe in support of the album in February 2012. The band performed in many countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Slovakia. The band also toured North America for the first time in support of the album in May 2012, including a performance at Maryland Deathfest. In 2012, Ulcerate signed to Relapse Records and announced plans to record a new album. The album was recorded during March and April 2013 at MCA Studios in Auckland. In July, the band revealed the new album, titled Vermis, would be released on 13 September 2013. The album received positive reviews upon release from Pitchfork, Exclaim!, and others. The band toured North America in support of the album in May 2014 with the support of Inter Arma. This included a show at the famous Saint Vitus rock bar in New York City. They then engaged in an extensive tour across Europe (again in support of Vermis) from November‚ÄìDecember 2014. They were supported by Wormed, Solace of Requiem, and Gigan.  Shrines of Paralysis (2015-present)  The band toured Australia and New Zealand on a number of dates from April‚ÄìJune 2015. In October 2015 Ulcerate headlined a tour across the United Kingdom, supported by Bell Witch and Ageless Oblivion. On 12 March 2016 the band announced that they were a month away from entering the studio to record their fifth full-length album, with the band posting progress updates on their Facebook page. On 27 June the band officially announced the title, album artwork, and track listing of their fifth album: The album is titled Shrines of Paralysis and will be released through Relapse Records in Fall 2016. They also announced that they would be touring North America with Iceland's Zhrine and Canada's Phobocosm in support of their new album in November 2016. The album was officially released on 28 October 2016. In March 2017 the band will be performing at the two-day festival 'Direct Underground Fest' in Sydney and Melbourne, alongside Gorguts, Marduk, Mg≈Ça, and D√©parte.  Musical style and influences  Ulcerate perform a highly technical, atmospheric variety of death metal. Their music is extremely dense, compositionally complex, technically demanding, and makes frequent use of unpredictable tempo changes. The band's drummer Jamie Saint Merat is considered an extremely important aspect of Ulcerate's sound due his technical skill and role in composing, recording, producing, and mixing their music, as well as creating the artwork. Guitarist Michael Hoggard is notable for his extensive use of dissonance and guitar effects, and what has been described as \\"a frenetic mix of exotic chords and unorthodox progressions.\\" Their style has been compared to bands such as Gorguts, Neurosis, Deathspell Omega, Immolation, and Portal.

When set up, this type of trailer provides a large amount of interior space when compared to its size when collapsed. Its relatively affordable price makes it a popular choice for some RVers and its small size contributes to easier towing than many other types of RVs. Features Same pop-up camper closed for travel A conventional pop-up consists of a trailer frame, a box, a hard roof, pull-out bunks and ‚Äúsoft‚Äù walls. The walls are made of vinyl, canvas or a similar material and include windows with screens. Basic popups usually include the following features: fold-down dinette (table top and bench seating combination), on- board fresh water tank, sink, 12-volt DC power system (including an AC to DC converter and a deep cycle battery), interior DC lighting, two sleeping bunks and storage cabinets. Many pop-ups also include a gas/electric absorption refrigerator, stove, rooftop air conditioner, propane furnace, water heater, electric water pump, exterior shower, skylight/roof vent, one or two propane tanks, electric or surge brakes, large storage trunk at the front of the box, and an awning. Some premium models also include a shower, toilet, wastewater tanks, slide-out section (to increase interior space), microwave, and an oven.A Complete Guide To Popup Campers Since space is at a premium in popup campers, it is common for a single structure to serve multiple purposes. Generally, the dinette, which can seat four people for a meal, can be converted into a bed to provide additional sleeping space. Likewise, the couch, if present, can usually be folded down into a bed. Often, the inside table (part of the dinette) and the gas stove can be taken outside and attached to the side of the camper. Dimensions Modern pop-ups range in weight from approximately to pounds empty or full. Models are generally classified by the length of their box, which ranges from to . When opened, the length is roughly double the box length. Most pop-ups are between and in width and between and in height when closed, but ‚Äúhigh wall‚Äù models are tall. Published sleeping capacities range from 4 to 8 people.http://www.jayco.com/php/products/camping.trailers/camping.trailers.phpColeman - FCTA Camping TrailersViking - Coachmen RVPalomino RV - Manufacturer of Quaility RVs since 1968 Setting up Utility side of popup To open a pop-up, the trailer must be chocked, disconnected from the tow vehicle, and leveled. The roof must first be raised using a winch that extends telescoping poles on each corner of the box. Next, bunks at the front and the back of the trailer are pulled out by hand. Then, the tent material (which is fastened to the box and to the roof) is unfurled, pulled over the ends of the bunks, and attached. Interior support poles for the bunk and the entry door are then installed. Depending on the configuration and included equipment, several additional set up steps may be required. These steps include hooking up to utilities (electricity, water, sewer), reassembling the dinette, unfolding the sink, turning on systems (water pump, water heater, etc.), making beds and unpacking belongings. Setup time for a pop-up camper is typically longer than that for a travel trailer, fifth wheel or motorhome. Types of Pop-ups Modern flip-out GO camper In addition to the traditional pop-up campers described above, there are a number of special types of pop-ups on the market: ; High wall pop-ups : Feature a taller box which allows for residential-height countertops and more storage space. ; Motorcycle campers : Lightweight pop-ups small enough to be pulled by a motorcycle. ; Toyhauler pop-ups : Include an open cargo deck for transporting ATVs, motorcycles, etc. ; Off road pop-ups : Feature rugged construction and raised suspension for off road use. ; A-frame : small solid wall folding camper. ; Flip-out camper : Features a roof which flips over to become a bunk. Uses a tent roof instead of a hard roof. ; Inflatable Trailer: Sets up quickly by blowing compressed air into side walls and roof  Gallery  File:Tent trailer.jpgModern tent trailer File:ModelT1925b.jpgTravel trailer Model T 1925 b File:Hard Shell Pop up.jpgHi Lo trailers are hard shell pop ups.

He played for the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim / Los Angeles Angels, St. Louis Cardinals, Philadelphia Phillies, Tampa Bay Rays and Atlanta Braves. The Angels selected him in the tenth round of the 2005 amateur draft from Notre Dame Preparatory High School in Scottsdale, Arizona. He made his MLB debut for the Angels in 2010. The Cardinals obtained him in a trade with the Angels after the 2013 season. Bourjos has gained considerable attention for his defensive skills, including his range, speed and ability to make what are deemed difficult catches. After bouncing around a variety of different clubs over the next six years (including the Philadelphia Phillies, Tampa Bay Rays, Atlanta Braves), Bourjos ended his career with the Angels before joining the Colorado Rockies front office as an advance scout. Career Bourjos attended Desert Mountain High School for his freshman year and later transferred to Notre Dame Preparatory High School in Scottsdale, Arizona. He also played football at Notre Dame High as wide receiver and kickoff returner. Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim selected Bourjos in the 10th round of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft, signing him on August 18, 2005. In 2008, Bourjos registered 50 stolen bases (SB) and a .295 batting average (AVG) with the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. Bourjos spent 2009 with the Arkansas Travelers. In 110 games, he batted .281, scored 72 runs, hit 16 doubles, 14 triples, six home runs (HR) and drove in 51 runners (RBI). In 109 games in the outfield, he recorded 294 putouts, five double plays and seven assists in 302 total chances with only one error for a .997 fielding percentage. He led the Texas League (TL) in triples and led the Travelers in runs. In May, he was selected as the Angels' Defensive Player of the Month and as a TL All-Star. He was also recognized as the Angels minor league system's Defensive Player of the Year in 2009. In the offseason after 2009, the Angels bought his contract and added him to their 40-man roster to prevent him from being selected by another team in the Rule 5 draft. Going into the 2010 season, Baseball America named him the second-best prospect in the Angels system, the \\"fastest baserunner\\", and \\"best defensive outfielder.\\" Through the first three months of the 2010 season, he batted .314 with 12 triples and 27 stolen bases with the Salt Lake Bees. In 487 games and seven minor league seasons in the Angels system, Bourjos batted .291 with a .345 on-base percentage, .455 slugging percentage, 88 doubles, 54 triples, 41 HR, 225 RBI and 141 SB. Bourjos made his Major League debut on August 3, 2010. In an August game against the Toronto Blue jays, he nearly robbed Adam Lind of a triple when he ran so fast into the wall that the ball caromed off his forearm. That same game, he made a diving catch in shallow left-center field to rob Aaron Hill of a hit, caught Yunel Escobar's deep fly ball on the warning track at the 400-foot mark on the wall in center field and took away a hit from Jos√© Bautista on a rocket line drive in the ninth. Bourjos appeared in 51 games that year, batting .204 with six doubles, four triples, six home runs and ten SB. He played 450 innings in the outfield and recorded ten assists, which placed second among all American League (AL) center fielders. In 2011, he, along with Austin Jackson, led the AL with 11 triples. It was an overall breakout season for Bourjos with a .271 batting average, 26 doubles, 12 HR, 49 extra base hits and 22 stolen bases in 147 games. He also registered seven assists, fifth among AL center fielders. The next season, he lost most of his playing time as heralded prospect Mike Trout emerged and the Angels continued playing Vernon Wells and Torii Hunter. His three-run, inside-the-park home run on April 11 erased a two-run deficit to the Minnesota Twins in the fifth inning on April 11, but the Angels were eventually defeated 6‚Äì5. It was the first such HR for an Angel since Gary Matthews, Jr., did so June 17, 2007 at Dodger Stadium. In September, Bourjos suffered wrist soreness in the aftermath of being hit by a pitch. He appeared in 101 games and totaled just 195 plate appearances. In innings on defense, he made just one error for a .994 fielding percentage. The Halos won 64 of his 95 appearances (.674 winning percentage) in center field. His final batting line included a .220 batting average, .291 on-base percentage and .315 slugging percentage, three HR, seven doubles, and three stolen bases. After the season, Hunter signed with the Detroit Tigers as a free agent, clearing an opportunity for Bourjos regain regular playing time. To increase his production at the plate, Bourjos began taking batting practice off a tee before the 2013 season. His strategy was to change his approach by hitting more ground balls and line drives, and fewer fly balls. In 2011, he had posted a ground ball rate of 46.8 percent. In 2013, he had raised that total to 58.7 percent, which was top-ten for hitters with at least 170 plate appearances. The extra practice and change in approach showed improved results. As of June 29, he had carried a .333 batting average, .392 on-base percentage and .457 slugging percentage and started to recoup a regular role. However, in August, Bourjos took another pitch off his wrist from Jordan Lyles of the Houston Astros. He attempted to rehabilitate it without surgery, but produced just five hits in 46 PA in August and September. Surgery was required to repair the wrist. His final 2013 batting line included a .274 AVG, .333 OBP, .374 SLG, three doubles, three triples and three home runs with six stolen bases in 55 total games and 196 PA. St. Louis Cardinals Bourjos while playing for the Cardinals On November 22, 2013, the Angels traded Bourjos and Randal Grichuk to the St. Louis Cardinals for third baseman David Freese and relief pitcher Fernando Salas. With the previous season's starting center fielder Jon Jay producing a decline in offensive performance and below average defense, acquiring Bourjos allowed the Cardinals to offset some defensive inconsistency. On January 17, 2014, Bourjos and the Cardinals avoided arbitration by agreeing to a one-year, $1.2 million contract, with a plate appearance-based performance incentive worth $150,000. Bourjos' first three-hit game for the Cardinals occurred on May 7, 2014, against the Atlanta Braves. He also hit his second home run of the season as the Cardinals prevailed, 7‚Äì1. During a May 29 game against the San Francisco Giants, he advanced from first base to third on pitcher Jaime Garc√≠a's sacrifice bunt. The Giants had optioned for an infield shift, leaving third base without a stationed fielder. The play also occurred without the benefit of an error. Bourjos' first home run at Busch Stadium gave the Cardinals the go-ahead run against the Kansas City Royals on June 4. Bourjos' fourth home run of the season came in the ninth inning against the Baltimore Orioles' Zach Britton on August 10, to opposite field over the right field scoreboard in Oriole Park at Camden Yards. Playing in 119 games, Bourjos batted .231 with a .294 on base percentage in 2014. A slow start to the season caused him to lose playing time to Jay. Bourjos made his first career playoff appearance against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Division Series (NLDS) and the Giants in the National League Championship Series (NLCS), playing in five games and batting twice. The Giants eliminated the Cardinals from postseason play. On October 21, 2014, Bourjos had surgery to repair hip impingement. He stated that it had affected his swing, contributing to lower offensive production, including his batting average. Bourjos and the Cardinals avoided arbitration for the second consecutive season by agreeing to a one-year, $1.65 million contract, on January 15, 2015. He began the season as the fourth outfielder, with most of the playing time in center field going to Jay. His speed impacted both offense and defense in the April 29 win against the Philadelphia Phillies. He collected two hits, including an RBI triple, and covered long range to snare Chase Utley's fly ball at the warning track. Philadelphia Phillies Bourjos with the Phillies in 2016 Spring Training On December 2, 2015, the Philadelphia Phillies claimed Bourjos off of waivers. Bourjos spent the entire season with the Phillies, hitting .251/.292/.389 with 5 home runs and 23 RBIs. Tampa Bay Rays On January 27, 2017, Bourjos signed a minor league deal with the Chicago White Sox. On March 28, 2017, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays for cash considerations or a player to be named later. He played in 100 games for the Rays, hitting .223/.272/.383 with 5 home runs. Chicago Cubs On February 1, 2018, Bourjos signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs. He was released on March 23. Atlanta Braves On March 26, 2018, the Atlanta Braves signed Bourjos to a one year contract worth $1 million. He was designated for assignment on April 25, and later released on April 29. He resigned a minor league deal on May 1, 2018. He had his contract purchased for the second time on May 31, 2018. In 2018 with Atlanta he batted .205/.239/.364. On July 2, 2018, Bourjos elected free agency after being designated for assignment and subsequently clearing waivers. San Francisco Giants On July 13, 2018, the San Francisco Giants signed Bourjos to a minor league deal. Alt URL Second stint with Angels On November 14, 2018, Bourjos signed a minor league deal with the Los Angeles Angels. He hit .091 in 26 games. On May 10, he was released by the Angels. Post-Playing Career On January 30, 2020, Bourjos was hired as an advance scout for the Colorado Rockies, effectively ending his playing career. Skills profile Bourjos was prized mainly for his speed and defense. According to Fangraphs in 2013, he \\"rate(d) as one of the very best defensive center fielders in baseball\\", and also noted his base running. Baseball Prospectus noted that he \\"covered so much ground as a center fielder that it sometimes backfired early in the season. His corner outfielders (Hunter and Wells), unaccustomed to flanking a player with such range, sometimes weren't giving way to Bourjos, while other times they flinched or back away at his mere approach.\\" Even after Trout became a full- time player for the Angels in 2012, Bourjos exclusively played center field when he was in the game, pushing Trout into left field. Through 2013, center field was the only position Bourjos had played in 341 Major League games, aside from five as a designated hitter. As a hitter, Bourjos was mainly a ground ball hitter, posting a 50.5% ground ball rate over his career as of 2013. In 2011, he posted his lowest career ground ball rate at 46.8%. Every other season, it has been above 50%. In 2013, it was 58.7%. According to former Cardinals pitching coach Dave Duncan's anecdotes, Bourjos' batted-ball style is one that allows little margin for extra base hits. Personal Bourjos is the son of former San Francisco Giants outfielder Chris Bourjos, who played in the famous 33 inning minor league baseball game between the Pawtucket Red Sox and Rochester Red Wings in 1981. Bourjos and his wife, Ashley, have a son born in 2015.

The idea was not well-received until after 1987, when the Teamsters (a major transportation union) reaffiliated with the AFL-CIO. At its founding, TTD represented 1.4 million (10 percent) of the AFL-CIO's 14 million members. Richard I. Kilroy was named the first president of the new department. Walter Shea (director of the Eastern Conference of Teamsters in Washington, D.C.) was elected Secretary-Treasurer. James Kennedy, who was also the executive director of the Railway Labor Executives' Association, was named TTD's first (and, at the time, only) full-time professional staff person.

He was succeeded by Larry I. Willis, who had previously served as Secretary Treasurer of TTD under Wytkind. Issues Two of the main purposes of the Transportation Trades Department are to influence national transportation policy and to speak as a unified voice for the concerns of organized labor on transportation issues.

In some cases, the transcripts formed by CGs are translated to form chimeric or completely novel proteins. Image:CGDef 1.png Figure 1: Cartoonic representation of the formation of conjoined gene A-B from parent genes A and B. Several alternative names are used to address conjoined genes, including combined gene and complex gene, fusion gene, fusion protein, read-through transcript, co-transcribed genes, bridged genes, spanning genes, hybrid genes, locus-spanning transcripts, etc. At present, 800 CGs have been identified in the entire human genome by different research groups across the world including Prakash et al., Akiva et al., Parra et al., Kim et al., and in the 1% of the human genome in the ENCODE pilot project. 36% of all these CGs could be validated experimentally using RT-PCR and sequencing techniques. However, only a very limited number of these CGs are found in the public human genome resources such as the Entrez Gene database, the UCSC Genome Browser and the Vertebrate Genome Annotation (Vega) database. More than 70% of the human conjoined genes are found to be conserved across other vertebrate genomes with higher order vertebrates showing more conservation, including the closest human ancestor, chimpanzee. Formation of CGs is not only limited to the human genome but some CGs have also been identified in other eukaryotic genomes, including mouse and drosophila. There are a few web resources which include information about some CGs in addition to the other fusion genes, for example, ChimerDB and HYBRIDdb. Another database, ConjoinG, is a comprehensive resource dedicated only to the 800 Conjoined Genes identified in the entire human genome.

It is the development version of Chrome OS, a Linux distribution made by Google. Like Chrome OS, Chromium OS is based on the Linux kernel, but its principal user interface is the Chromium web browser rather than the Google Chrome browser. Chromium OS also includes the Portage package manager, which was originally developed for Gentoo Linux. Because Chromium OS and Chrome OS use a web browser engine for the user interface, they are oriented toward web applications rather than desktop applications or mobile apps. Google first published the Chromium OS source code in late 2009.  Architecture  Chromium's architecture is three- tiered, consisting of \\"three major components\\": * The Chromium-based browser and the window manager * System-level software and user-land services: the Linux kernel, drivers, connection manager, and so on * Firmware  Availability  Chromium OS was first made available in compiled form by hobbyists. More organized efforts have emerged over time, including a few manufacturers that have shipped devices with the operating system pre- installed.  Builds and forks  By May 2010, compiled versions of the work-in-progress source code had been downloaded from the Internet more than a million times. The most popular version, entitled \\"Chromium OS Flow\\", was created by Liam McLoughlin, a then 17-year-old college student in Liverpool, England, posting under the name \\"Hexxeh\\". McLoughlin's build boots from a USB memory stick and included features that Google engineers had not yet implemented, such as support for the Java programming language. While Google did not expect that hobbyists would use and evaluate Chromium OS ahead of its official release, Sundar Pichai, Google's vice president of product management (now the CEO) said that \\"what people like Hexxeh are doing is amazing to see.\\" Pichai said the early releases were an unintended consequence of open source development. \\"If you decide to do open-source projects, you have to be open all the way.\\" Hexxeh's work continued into the following year. He announced \\"Chromium OS Lime\\" in December 2010, and in January 2011, released \\"Luigi\\", an application designed to \\"jailbreak\\"/\\"root\\" the Google Cr-48 \\"Mario\\" prototype hardware and install a generic BIOS. The developer made the builds available in virtual machine format on March 13, 2011. With no official build of Chromium OS forthcoming from Google, Hexxeh's \\"vanilla\\" nightly builds of Chromium OS were the principal resource for people wanting to try Chromium OS. Hexxeh stopped uploading his builds on April 20, 2013. More recent versions of Chromium OS are available from Arnoldthebat, who maintains daily and weekly builds along with usage guidelines and help.http://arnoldthebat.co.uk/ In July 2012, Chromium Build Kit was released. It automatically compiles a developer build and installs Chromium OS on a USB drive. File:ChromiumOS Cherry - on web.png ChromiumOS Cherry Now known as \\"Flow\\" (4 December 2009) File:ChromiumOS Zero - login screen.png ChromiumOS Zero Now known as \\"Vanilla \\" (9 December 2009) File:ChromiumOS Flow - login screen.png ChromiumOS Flow (15 February 2010) In 2015, New York City-based Neverware produced a Chromium OS fork called CloudReady aimed at the educational market, with the intention of extending the life of older PCs and laptops. A subsequent version can dual- boot Neverware and the Windows operating system (until v64). In 2016, Nexedi released NayuOS, a fork of Chromium OS precompiled for several Chromebook computers. The operating system provides Chrome OS-like capabilities without storing data on Google servers. It optionally removes the Google login and provides additional developer tools. Also in 2016, a London/Beijing-based startup produced a line of Chromium OS fork named Flint OS, targeting a wider range of platforms, including 64-bit PCs, Raspberry Pi, Tinker Board, Firefly development boards, and VMware virtual machines. The OS was later renamed Fyde OS. In 2017, Wayne Inc., a Korean startup, developed the Chromium OS fork for an ordinary PC named Chromic OS and launched their Beta service. In 2019, Chromic OS was renamed Wayne OS and launched together with its newer version and more compatible features, with the purpose of providing cheaper, safer, simpler & more lightweight OS especially for older PCs and broken HDD/SSD PCs.  Hardware  Some devices have shipped with Chromium OS preinstalled. In May 2011, Dell also released a new build for the Dell Inspiron Mini 10v netbook, following up on an earlier build released almost 18 months earlier. The build did not support audio, but was bootable from a USB drive. Other devices include the Kogan Agora Chromium Laptop by the Australian company Kogan and the Xi3 Modular Computer, introduced by the company of the same name. In late 2015, a team headed by Dylan Callahan released a beta Chromium OS port to the Raspberry Pi 2 single-board computer. In 2016, Flint Innovations released a Chromium OS port for the latest Raspberry Pi 3/B model named Flint OS for RPi. Subsequently, this project has been fully open-sourced at GitHub, with all the files and detailed instructions to re-create the build.  Trademark dispute  In June 2011, ISYS Technologies, based in Salt Lake City, sued Google in a Utah district court, claiming rights to the name \\"Chromium\\" and, by default, Chromebook and Chromebox. The suit sought to stop Google and its hardware and marketing partners from selling Chromebooks. The suit was later dismissed and, as part of an undisclosed settlement between Google and ISYS, ISYS abandoned its trademark efforts.

During his time in office he served in the Executive Council of Alberta as Minister of the Environment from 1979 to 1982 under the Peter Lougheed government. Political career Cookson ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature for the first time in the 1967 Alberta general election. He was defeated by incumbent Allen Patrick finishing a strong second. Cookson ran for a second time in the 1971 Alberta general election. He won the electoral district of Lacombe in a tight race over Social Credit candidate Ivan Stonehocker to pick up the district for the Progressive Conservatives who went on to form government that election. Cookson and Stonehocker would face each other again in the 1975 Alberta general election. Stonehocker's vote collapsed and Cookson won his second term easily. He would run for a third term in office in the 1979 Alberta general election. That election saw a crowded field of candidates with Cookson facing four opponents. He won a slightly larger share of the popular vote winning an easy victory on election night. After the election Premier Peter Lougheed appointed Cookson to be Minister of the Environment.

It was fought between Spanish soldiers and Apache warriors, near the Presidio Santa Cruz de Terrenate in the present day southern Arizona. Background The site for El Presidio Santa Cruz de Terrenate, near the middle of the San Pedro River, was chosen on August 22, 1775 by Colonel Hugo O'Conor (born in Ireland) who was in charge of relocating Spanish fortifications on the Sonoran frontier. The spot was on a bluff overlooking the San Pedro River, which provided natural fortifications on three sides. The walls were built in the shape of a large square, with one triangular bastion at a corner to protect the presidio's two front walls and a main gate protected by a two-story guardhouse. Several adobe-walled structures and jacals were also constructed to house the families of the garrison soldiers, along with a small barracks, an officer's quarters, a chapel and a plaza. The area had pasturage, wood and water. The garrison consisted of the commander, Captain Francisco Tovar and fifty-six soldados de cuera (\\"leather jackets\\"). Artillery had not yet arrived at the isolated post, which was still under construction at the time of battle. The fighting men were armed with pistols, muskets, bows, swords, adargas (leather shields), and lances. Battle The Spaniards did not have long to wait before hostile Apaches began to harass the settlement, attacking anyone who ventured out for water or those who tried to plant crops in the nearby fields. Apaches were attracted by the large number of horses kept at the settlement and they ran off the herds whenever they were unguarded. The Apache also burned the fields of crops and the jacals. Although not the first Apache-Spanish battle involving the Santa Cruz de Terreante soldiers, the battle on July 7, 1776 was said to have occurred at the fort, but it did not, according to archaeologists Deni Seymour and Mark Harlan who have reviewed the documentary evidence.(see http://www.seymourharlan.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page93.html) The battle took place along the San Pedro River, at some distance from the uncompleted fort, and it left the commander and 29 of his men dead after a long fight. According to this new information, the Spaniards saw the Apache fording the San Pedro a day and a half from the presidio, and although unprepared, they pursued the Apache. Armed with bows and arrows the Apache resisted the attack, pushing the Spanish back. The Spaniards eventually forded the river but were then overwhelmed. Some Apaches were also killed or wounded; exact numbers are unknown. A few Spaniards survived to tell the story. Aftermath In August the fort finally received a shipment of weapons. Captain Francisco Ignacio de Trespalacios replaced the fallen commander and brought reinforcements to bring their number up to eighty-three men. In mid-November, 1776, Trespalacios led thirty of them to the mission of Magdalena, within modern day Mexico, on the San Ignacio River. When they arrived they found that forty Apaches had looted the settlement, murdered the inhabitants and burned the church. The incident became known as the Magdalena Massacre. Apache attacks on Fort Terrenate became so fierce that some 98 men perished while manning it, during only four years of its use; three of the dead were commanders. On September 24, 1778, Captain Francisco Trespalacios and 27 of his soldiers were killed. From November 1778 to February 1779, 39 soldiers were killed. In May 1779, Captain Luis del Castille was killed.

Gil Naranjo chose the site of the town in a level area and marked the site of the main plaza and the church, which he named after a saint.

Brandeis Elementary School is a former elementary school in Louisville, Kentucky that began operation in 1913. It is listed as a historic building with the National Register of Historic Places. It was patterned after the Charlton House in England. It was designed by J. Earl Henry, the renowned early 20th century Louisville architect. The historic building is located at 1001 South 26th Street. The school itself operates at 2817 W. Kentucky St. in a modern facility. It became a math/science/technology magnet school in fall 1990. It was Louisville's first magnet program in an elementary school. Design Detail of main entrance The original school building occupies a city block between the Parkland and California neighborhoods. It is built of brick and has 2¬Ω stories as well as a raised basement. The windows on the first and second floor are identical. A decorative gabled entrance spans the height of the building and includes a decorative scroll which reads \\"L.P.S.\\" for Louisville Public School (the predecessor of Jefferson County Public Schools). The building is designed in the Tudor Revival architecture style, although the entrance includes Gothic elements. Architect J. Henry Earl was heavily influenced by Robert Smythson, especially his designs for Wardour Castle and Charlton House. A modestly styled addition was added to the back of the building in 1954. The elaborate original windows were replaced in 1962 steel frame vent windows. History Brandeis was one of the first schools built under the Louisville Independent School District, which spent equally in rich and poor neighborhoods, accounting for the large and stylish building in a working-class neighborhood. The school was named after Albert S. Brandeis, who was one of the founders of the Louisville Board of Education. In 1990, the school board announced Brandeis would be leaving its old building because it was too small and maintenance costs were too high. At the time, its principal said \\"The building has a lot of charm, but we've outdated it. Most of the major systems are in constant need of repair.\\" A new site was selected a few blocks away, which was previously the location of about 20 houses and some small businesses. The move was completed in 1992. At the time, city officials hoped to buy the building and convert it to housing. The city bought the property in 1993 for $220,000. The property was used for public meetings in the mid-1990s as various plans were proposed to convert it to a new use. A non-profit group built a day care center on the original school property, behind the school building, in 1995. However, the property suffered during this time, as parts of the roof caved in and vandals repeatedly struck. In 1996, it was finally converted to 50 private apartments. It was converted by the same not-for-profit group, New Directions Housing Corporation, that turned Theodore Roosevelt Elementary School in Portland into apartments. It continues to be an important landmark in its neighborhood. The building now includes 50 apartments, an after school Learning Center and community garden.

He is Obama's fourth great-grandfather. He purchased the land from the United States Government in 1849 when President Zachary Taylor was in office. This land was originally obtained by the government through treaties with the Miami Indians. Jacob Dunham's son, Jacob Mackey Dunham, is Obama's third great-grandfather.

Lester Park in Greenfield, is a site owned by the New York State Museum, it is a 490 million year old fossil seafloor. The USS Slater (DE-766), the only escort destroyer from World War II still afloat, and a reconstruction of Henry Hudson's Half Moon are docked at Albany as floating museums. Art Olana inspired Frederic Edwin Church, of the Hudson River School There are several art galleries of different genres in the Capital District; most are galleries featuring work by local artists. Some have multimedia presentations and classes for locals, such as the Arts Center of the Capital Region in Troy, and the Albany Center Gallery in downtown Albany, which exhibits works by local artists within a radius of that city. The Arkell Museum in Canajoharie features American artists such as Georgia O'Keeffe, along with history of the Mohawk Valley. The Empire State Plaza in Albany has one of the most important state collections of modern art in the nation. Yaddo in Saratoga Springs and the Olana State Historic Site in Greenport, have natural and architectural works of art and have been used by artists of landscapes such as those of the Hudson River School. The Hyde Collection in Glens Falls is more of a formal art museum and includes works by Botticelli, Degas, Picasso, Raphael, Rembrandt, Renoir, and Van Gogh. Several of the area's colleges and universities have art museums open to the public displaying art produced locally, nationally, and internationally. These include the Esther Massry Gallery at The College of Saint Rose, Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College; the University Art Museum at the University at Albany, SUNY; and the Opalka Gallery at the Sage College of Albany. Performing arts Palace Theatre in Albany The Capital District is home to many venues for the performing arts, some very old and some very new. Some are owned by municipalities or the state, such as the Times Union Center (owned by Albany County), the Palace Theatre (owned by the city of Albany), or the Saratoga Performing Arts Center (SPAC) and the Egg (both owned by the state of New York). The Times Union Center is the largest venue, originally called the Knickerbocker Arena. It opened on January 30, 1990 with a performance by Frank Sinatra.\\"Times Union enters a new arena\\". Carol DeMare. Times Union. May 5, 2006 In 1996, The Grateful Dead released a concert album from their March 1990 performances titled Dozin' at the Knick.Dozin' at the Knick Some of the venues, such as Proctor's Theatre in Schenectady and the Palace Theatre in Albany are quite old and started off in the days of vaudeville. Proctor's and the Palace have evolved into hosting dance, ballet, opera, symphony orchestra, and contemporary music performances such as Proctor's hosting of Mariah Carey's filming of her 1993 Thanksgiving NBC Special. The Cohoes Music Hall, the WAMC's Performing Arts Center (The Linda) in Albany, and the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall are three smaller venues also in buildings as old as Proctor's and the Palace. The Egg in Albany and SPAC in Saratoga Springs are newer venues for concerts, ballet, and orchestra performances both constructed during Nelson Rockefeller's tenure as governor of New York. In addition to outside acts performing in the region, there are local ones as well. The Albany Symphony Orchestra performs at the Palace and the Troy Savings Bank Music Hall, among other local venues, and a few outside the region as well. The Capital Repertory Theater in Albany and the New York State Theatre Institute (NYSTI) in Troy are local groups with their own performing space. Many local colleges have performing arts spaces as well; one of the newest and most sophisticated is the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy. Festivals Washington Park in Albany during the Tulip Fest One of the largest events in the Capital District is the Tulip Fest held in Albany every spring at Washington Park. The tradition stems from when Mayor Erastus Corning 2nd got a city ordinance passed declaring the tulip as Albany's official flower on July 1, 1948. In addition, he sent a request to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands to name a variety as Albany's tulip. On July 11, 1948 her reply was \\"Her Majesty gladly accepts the invitation to designate a tulip as the official flower of Albany.\\" She picked the variety \\"Orange Wonder\\", a bronzy orange shaded scarlet. The first Tulip Fest was celebrated the next year on May 14, 1949 with opening ceremonies still carried on today as tradition, such as the sweeping of State Street and the crowning of a Tulip Queen. The African- American tradition of Pinksterfest, whose origins are traced back even further to Dutch festivities, was later incorporated into the Tulip Fest. The largest Flag Day parade is held every year in Troy. The 42nd annual parade in 2009 is along a two-mile-long route. First Night celebrations are held in Saratoga Springs, while in 2006 Albany decided to eliminate its First Night celebrations in favor of a new \\"Albany WinterFestival\\" (WinterFest). Other major festivals in the Capital District include ethnic festivals. The Albany LatinFest which has been held since 1996 and drew 10,000 to Washington Park in 2008. In Schenectady the growing Guyanese community has celebrated the Guyanese Family Fun Day for several years in that city's Central Park. PolishFest is a three-day celebration of Polish culture in the Capital District, held in the town of Colonie for the past eight years. Literature and cinema Emma Willard School was a film location for Scent of a Woman and The Emperor's Club The Capital District has its share of historical and tourist non-fiction books; the area however has also seen a great deal of fiction written by its natives and about the region. Some of these have been turned into movies, such as Ironweed by William Kennedy and Last of the Mohicans by James Fenimore Cooper. Ironweed is but one of a series of books by Kennedy that take place in Albany. The series is often referred to as the \\"Albany Cycle\\". The elusive author Trevanian also grew up in Albany and wrote The Crazyladies of Pearl Street, about Albany's North Albany neighborhood along Pearl Street; commentators considered it a semi-autobiographical memoir. Gregory Maguire, author of Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West which was source for the Broadway hit Wicked, also grew up in North Albany. Richard Lipez, under the pen-name Richard Stevenson has written nine books (four of which have been made into movies) in a series about the openly gay detective Donald Strachey, which take place in Albany. From the earliest days of silent movies the Capital District has been used for filming motion pictures. Some early movies filmed in the area were Last of the Mohicans in 1911, The Sign Invisible (1918), and Impossible Catherine (1919), all of which were filmed in Lake George. Saratoga, produced in 1937, was shot at the Saratoga Race Course. In the 1990s, after several movies were filmed in the area, the marketing moniker \\"Hollywood on the Hudson\\" was promoted for the area, but never gained popularity, though it still is used by some promoters, especially for Troy. More recently there have been many movies that have had parts filmed in the Capital District including The Bostonians (1984), Ironweed (1987), Scent of a Woman (1992), The Age of Innocence (1993), The Horse Whisperer (1998), The Emperor's Club (2002), The Time Machine (2002), Seabiscuit (2003), War of the Worlds (2005), and Taking Woodstock (2009). Most recently Downtown Albany was the site of filming for Salt starring Angelina Jolie, and the action-comedy The Other Guys starring Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. Religious life First Church in Albany, a Reformed church, the oldest place of worship in the Capital District The Capital District, and Albany in particular, is home to many of the oldest congregations and places of worship in the United States. The Dutch Reformed, Episcopal, and Lutheran congregations date back to the 17th century. The area, as a Dutch colony originally, was dominated by the Dutch Reformed church from the beginning of settlement. The congregation of the First Church in Albany is the second oldest congregation in the state of New York. The pulpit was imported from the Netherlands in 1656 and is the oldest pulpit in the United States. Shortly after being constructed a memorial service was held for Alexander Hamilton here, and Theodore Roosevelt attended services here while Governor of New York. The First Lutheran Church in Albany is the oldest congregation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, it began as a Dutch Lutheran church 360 years ago. St. Peter's was the first Anglican church in New York west of the Hudson River, and the first Anglican church in the state north of the city of New York. The remains of Lord Howe, who died during the French and Indian Wars were interred under the vestibule; he is the only British Lord buried in the United States. In 1868 the newly formed Episcopal Diocese of Albany met in convention at St. Peter's to choose a bishop and William Doane, rector of St. Peter's, was chosen on December 3, he was consecrated as such on February 2, 1869 in St. Peter's. Albany remains the home of the mother church and cathedral of the Episcopal diocese of Albany: the Cathedral of All Saints with Bishop William Love as current bishop. The Capital District is also home to the Roman Catholic cathedral and mother church, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception with Bishop Howard J. Hubbard as head of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany. The oldest Black church in the Capital District is the Israel African Methodist Episcopal Church (Israel AME), it was established by Reverend William Cornish who was sent to Albany in 1828 by Bishop Richard Allen, founder of the AME denomination. The Israel AME was incorporated in 1829 and the current building on Hamilton Street dates from 1854. A state historic marker was placed in 1988 at the 160th anniversary celebrations, which also commemorates the church as a stop on the Underground Railroad. A significant Jewish presence has existed in Albany since as early as 1658, and today includes many synagogues; there are two Reform, two Conservative, a Chabad-Lubavitch, an Orthodox, and one of the few Karaite synagogues outside Israel. This link is not active during Shabbat, which begins on Friday at sundown, local time, and ends the following Saturday night. Congregation Berith Sholom (Covenant of Peace), a synagogue in Troy, is the oldest continuously used synagogue in the state of New York, and the second oldest house of worship in the state outside of the city of New York,. In addition, Albany is known for a landmark event in the history of American Reform Judaism: Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise, one of the founders of Reform Judaism in the United States, first advocated his reforms at a synagogue in Albany, where he was Albany's first and only rabbi. Wise was also the teacher of one of only four Hebrew schools in the nation. In 1850 he came to blows with the congregation president and the police were called to quell the riot that started on the street. and this split with the existing synagogue he established in Albany the fourth Reform synagogue in the United States. There is also a small population of Muslims in the city. The number of colleges and universities in the area help bring in more culturally diverse students, representing ranging religious beliefs. Most of the local colleges have respective Muslim Student Associations, for example. SUNY Albany even cancelled class for Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha during the 2004‚Äì2005 school year, however it reverted that policy the following year due to low Muslim population.

It is similar to the bi-pin connector, except that the two \\"pins\\" are the same wires that extend into the bulb (rather than being rigid), and the wires are bent up onto the sides of the base, where they make contact with the socket. The wires are usually inserted into a plastic base that the bulb is mounted in, and which is often narrower at the tip than at the bulb, giving it a wedge shape and usually ensuring a tight connection, depending on manufacturing tolerances. Some bulbs have no plastic base, and the wires are simply bent up to the sides of the bulb's glass base. The bulb is inserted and removed with straight in or out force, without turning as with a bayonet mount or Edison screw, on certain bi-pin light sockets. For true wedges, compression is the force that holds the bulb in, while others use simple friction, or snap into a socket with spring- loaded electrical contacts that \\"grab\\" the corners or other protrusions on the base to prevent loosening from vibration. In contrast, a \\"slide base\\" (sometimes \\"telephone slide base\\") lamp also is inserted in a socket without rotation, but has two long contacts on either side of the lamp envelope connected to the lead wires. Bulbs of this type are commonly used in automotive lighting and in low-voltage lighting used in landscape lighting. The bulb may have dual filaments, acting as both a low-wattage tail light or parking light and a higher-wattage brake light or turn signal. In this case, one has its contacts near the center of the base, and the other toward the outside edges, so that they cannot be accidentally swapped. Along with putting contacts on the opposite (alternating) sides, this gives the base rotational symmetry so that the user does not have to determine the exact position of the bulb before inserting a new one. Wedge bases are designated with the letter W and possibly a second letter indicating the exact type (often keyed to prevent the wrong colors from being used in automobiles), the thickness in millimetres, a lowercase x, the width in millimeters, and a lowercase d to indicate a double-contact (single-filament) bulb or q for a quad-contact (dual-filament) one. Like small bi-pins, the measurement may be expressed as a decimal, such as 2.5, instead of a whole number. In the US and the automotive industry, the bases are often designated with a T designator, as in T5, T10, or T15. Alternatively, a numerical code is sometimes used, such as 921 How to Select 921 LED Bulb and Replacement Tips \\"921 LED Bulb\\", KRM Light+ for a W16W/T15 bulb. LED bulbs are also made that will retrofit incandescents with the same base, but may affect the electrical relay that controls the blinking of turn signals, or cause others sensors to assume that a light bulb is out (see idiot light). In this type of \\"bulb\\", all of the LEDs may light regardless of which of the contacts are activated on the base, but like a dimmer or a three-way screw-in fluorescent, the brightness is changed instead by the bulb's internal electronic wiring. Although several types of fixture- ballasted compact fluorescent bulbs (such as the common PL-13) use a large wedge-like base, they are designated as bi-pin or quad-pin bases. Christmas mini lights 5mm dome LEDs with wedge bases and locking tabs Billions of wedge-base bulbs are used in miniature (T1¬æ or 5mm) Christmas lights, where they are easy and therefore inexpensive to manufacture and assemble into their sockets. However, each manufacturer has a slightly different type of wedge base differing in exact dimensions (or even hexagonal instead of round), so the plastic bases often need to be swapped when replacing bulbs. (The wedge bases are now usually not even supplied with the bulbs, which cost nearly as much as buying a new set, typically 10 bulbs for a dollar but a new set of 100 for two dollars.) Modern sets typically have a long and thin wedge that extends all the way down to the back end of the socket, separating the two electrical conductors and contacts and preventing water between them when used outdoors. Many sets have an optional \\"locking\\" tab on the edge of the base that snaps onto or into the side of the socket, to prevent bulbs from becoming loose and falling out and causing the set to fail to light. This is problematic for light sets with covers like icicles, which will not fit over this type of base or socket unless they have a special notch, which can in turn allow rainwater or snowmelt into the decoration. Special twinkle bulbs often have special bases which they are permanently glued into, to keep the user from putting too many in a strand, or into strands not designed for them. General Electric produced sets in the late 1970s or early 1980s with special green-tipped clear \\"fuse\\" bulbs that had special bases at both ends of a set. Modern sets also often have larger sockets at each end of each circuit (i.e. two circuits of 50 in a typical 100 incandescent set) because of the third wire, and therefore a different wedge base with a wider separator that cannot be inserted into other regular sockets. LED sets also have special bases that enforce electrical polarity, and keep them from being used in incandescent sets. Philips-branded sets and most store brands use an offset, with the longer anode (positive lead) being lower and the shorter cathode (negative lead) being higher on the wedge base. GE-branded sets (no longer actually made by GE) use a larger round base with a tab that sticks out to one side. A small resistor may also be contained in the base of older two-volt LED colors (red, orange, yellow) when in a mixed-color set, so that they match the three volts needed by the newer colors (blue, deep green, purple, white), however other manufacturers only change the value of the resistor that is a part of the cord set itself.

Reeve was awarded the Bronze Wolf Award for exceptional services to world Scouting. Early life and family Born in Auckland on 2 December 1912, Reeve was the son of Ethel Mary Whitta and her husband Benjamin Alfred Reeve. He was educated at Eastbourne and West Christchurch Primary Schools. On 5 February 1944, Reeve married Jacqueline Lorraine Taylor at St Matthew's Church, in the Wellington suburb of Brooklyn, and the couple went on to have three children. Working life Reeve joined the Post and Telegraph Department as a telegram delivery boy in 1929. By the time he retired from the New Zealand Post Office in 1971, he had risen to become the assistant principal public relations officer. He had been involved in the organisation of various international conferences in Wellington, including for SEATO, the Colombo Plan, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and the Pacific Basin Economic Council in 1972. He then became chairman of the Wellington branch of the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society.The Evening Post 27 June 1977 & 17 March 1980. Scouting Reeve's name first appears in the Troop records for St Matthew's Scout Group in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 1926. He started as a scout and moved on to take over the troop as a much-respected scoutmaster. From there he was promoted to district scoutmaster and formally resigned from St Matthew's Scout Group with a letter left in the troop log book dated 11 December 1936, although he kept in contact throughout the years and often visited the group when he could. His roles in Scouting New Zealand included commissioner for Pacific Island Scouting and international commissioner. In the 1978 New Year Honours, Reeve was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to scouting. In 1979, Reeve was presented with the Bronze Wolf Award by the World Scout Committee, awarded in recognition of \\"outstanding service by an individual to the World Scout Movement\\". It is the highest honour that can be given to a volunteer Scout leader in the world. He also received the Commonwealth's highest Scouting honour, Silver Wolf Award, and the Silver Tui, Scouting New Zealand's highest award. Rugby Reeve was an avid follower of rugby union, and a life member of the Wellington Rugby Football Union. He donated a trophy, the Arthur Reeve Cup, which is contested in the Wellington Secondary Schools rugby competition in the under-80 kg grade. It was first awarded in 1989. After injuring his leg playing rugby at 19, he joined the Scottish Harriers, and was elected vice president. Reeve was a rugby columnist for over 23 years for Rugby News and then the Sunday Times. He wrote a history of college rugby, Cradle of Rugby, published in 1992.REEVE, ARTHUR W.V. & MCCONNELL, LYNN, Cradle of Rugby : The History of New Zealand College Rugby. Lower Hutt, Inprint, 1992.

In 1909 Love Augustus Edward Hough. The yielding of the earth to disturbing forces 82 Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 1909 http://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1909.0008 Augustus Edward Hough Love introduced the values h and k which characterize the overall elastic response of the Earth to the tides. Later, in 1912, T. Shida of Japan added a third Love number, l, which was needed to obtain a complete overall description of the solid Earth's response to the tides. Definitions The Love number h is defined as the ratio of the body tide to the height of the static equilibrium tide;\\"Tidal Deformation of the Solid Earth: A Finite Difference Discretization\\", S.K.Poulsen; Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen; p 24; also defined as the vertical (radial) displacement or variation of the planet's elastic properties. In terms of the tide generating potential V(\\\\theta, \\\\phi )/g, the displacement is h V(\\\\theta, \\\\phi)/g where \\\\theta is latitude, \\\\phi is east longitude and g is acceleration due to gravity.Earth Tides; D.C.Agnew, University of California; 2007; 174 For a hypothetical solid Earth h = 0. For a liquid Earth, one would expect h = 1. However, the deformation of the sphere causes the potential field to change, and thereby deform the sphere even more. The theoretical maximum is h = 2.5. For the real Earth, h lies between these values. The Love number k is defined as the cubical dilation or the ratio of the additional potential (self-reactive force) produced by the deformation of the deforming potential. It can be represented as k V(\\\\theta, \\\\phi)/g, where k = 0 for a rigid body. The Love number l represents the ratio of the horizontal (transverse) displacement of an element of mass of the planet's crust to that of the corresponding static ocean tide. In potential notation the transverse displacement is l abla (V(\\\\theta, \\\\phi))/g, where abla is the horizontal gradient operator. As with h and k, l = 0 for a rigid body. Values According to Cartwright, \\"An elastic solid spheroid will yield to an external tide potential U_2 of spherical harmonic degree 2 by a surface tide h_2U_2/g and the self-attraction of this tide will increase the external potential by k_2U_2.\\"Tides: A Scientific History; David E. Cartwright; Cambridge University Press, 1999, ; pp 140‚Äì141,224 The magnitudes of the Love numbers depend on the rigidity and mass distribution of the spheroid. Love numbers h_n, k_n, and l_n can also be calculated for higher orders of spherical harmonics. For elastic Earth the Love numbers lie in the range: 0.616 \\\\leq h_2 \\\\leq 0.624, 0.304 \\\\leq k_2 \\\\leq 0.312 and 0.084 \\\\leq l_2 \\\\leq 0.088.

Description  Launched in September 2009, Flickchart is the brainchild of web programmer Jeremy Thompson and web designer Nathan Chase. The impetus behind the site's creation came from an argument over the placement of Pulp Fiction and The Empire Strikes Back on the Internet Movie Database Top 250. Thompson and Chase concluded that the limitations of movie rating systems using stars or numbers failed to produce accurate \\"Best Movie of All Time\\" lists. Flickchart was designed to remedy the issue by forcing users to decide between two random movies repeatedly until an accurate list is created, rather than rating each movie individually. This approach is intended to encourage users to seriously consider which film they actually prefer. Regarding the decision process, Thompson said, ‚ÄúHopefully you‚Äôre reliving some of the scenes in your mind and you hate making a definitive pick\\".  Critical reception  Reactions to the site from film bloggers and other observers have been generally positive. Barb Dybwad of Mashable describes the site's \\"game-like premise\\" as \\"rather addictive\\". Jeremy Smith (a.k.a. \\"Mr. Beaks\\") of Ain't It Cool News described himself as hooked after 15 minutes and obsessed after four hours, but stated \\"Is the process flawless? Hardly.\\" He then explains that films of inferior quality can get stuck near the top of a person's rankings and be hard to dislodge through the random dueling process, because the film must have the right duels against superior films, in order to move downward to its proper place in the rankings. In a June 2009 article, Scott Weinberg of Cinematical called it \\"easily the coolest movie website of the year\\" and described himself as \\"tickled, fascinated, enamored and addicted\\". The site's addictive qualities have also been given a negative spin, at least humorously, by Cole Abaius at the blog Film School Rejects, in which he contended that Flickchart would \\"ruin your life.\\" \\"Why will it ruin your life?\\" asked Abaius. \\"Because it‚Äôs going to take up all of your time, and all you‚Äôll be doing is tearing your hair out and clicking\\".

Joe: A Real American Hero toyline and comic book series. He is the G.I. Joe Team's covert operations officer and debuted in 1986. Profile His real name is John Zullo, and his rank is that of captain O-3. Claymore was born in Manchester, Vermont. Claymore attended and graduated at the top of his class from Dartmouth, majoring in Eastern Philosophy. He enlisted in the US Army and served three back-to-back tours in Southeast Asia as a U.S. Army Special Forces officer. His actions there are classified. He is an expert in NATO long distance sniper rifles, and all NATO and Warsaw Pact small arms. Claymore has mastered many forms of martial arts and is fluent in Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Portuguese. When asked to join the G.I. Joes, his only stipulation was that he be called in for special assignments only. Toys Claymore was first released as an action figure in 1986, as an exclusive in a special set from Toys R Us named \\"Special Mission: Brazil\\", alongside re-colored versions of Mainframe, Wet Suit, Leatherneck, and Dial Tone. The set included a cassette tape that detailed the secret mission. Comics Devil's Due Claymore first appeared in G.I. Joe #26 (January 2004), in the series published by Devil's Due. He was assigned to the nation of Badhikstan under orders to get the nation's Prime Minister out of the country after it was taken over by The Coil. The Prime Minister held the activation chips to the country's nuclear arsenal in his cell phone. The Coil took the Prime Minister hostage, and Stalker brought in a team of Joes to aid Claymore in a rescue. Unfortunately, the mission was a bust, with the Coil getting their hands on the codes and forcing the Joes to retreat under threat of using the nuclear arsenal. Claymore moved operations to the neighboring country. He was soon joined by Lt. Falcon, Dusty, Snake Eyes, and Scarlett. The five Joes ran a recon mission over the border to spy on some construction. They were attacked by Overkill and some Desert Vipers and captured. However, they were let go by the Crimson Twins in order not to cause an incident since Cobra just took control of Badhikstan from the Coil and did not want any retaliation from the Joes. Claymore makes a cameo in a later issue, seen working out of the Joes' \\"Americana Museum\\" sub-base.G.I. Joe: Frontlines #18 (December 2003) At one point, Claymore is made director of G.I. Joe's overseas operations. Claymore later returned to the US, where he tried to help oversee operations after Hawk was crippled in battle. After the Jugglers reconstructed the team, Claymore and Vorona were supposed to head back to Badhikstan, but stayed behind just long enough to help Duke, Snake Eyes, Scarlett, and Storm-Shadow escape federal pursuit. America's Elite Claymore appeared in the G.I. Joe Special Missions: Brazil one-shot (April 2007). Based in part on the Toys R Us exclusive set, the story involved Claymore teaming up with the same Joes from the set. The five Joes had been part of a disastrous mission to capture the Headman. Years later, the deceased Mainframe's prot√©g√©, Firewall, helped the Joes complete the mission. During the \\"World War III\\" storyline, Claymore is deployed to Kazakhstan.G.I.

Lyrically, the album has been described as tackling themes such as \\"the end of mankind, the insignificance of our existence and the resumption of a natural order, free of humanity‚Äôs tyranny, greed and bloodlust.\\" Willowtip Records issued the album on vinyl for the first time in January 2016 on limited edition gatefold vinyl.  Background  Everything Is Fire is the first Ulcerate album not to feature Ben Read on vocals, with bassist Paul Kelland taking on vocal duties. In an interview with Metalnews.de, Jamie Saint Merat explained that \\"We wanted a return to the darker vocal approach that we originally started the band with. Prior to 'Of Fracture and Failure' we were keen to try a more varied vocal assault, and Ben certainly fitted that mould perfectly. But as we were writing 'Everything...' it became apparent that we really wanted the vocal to provide more of a solid backbone, and really support the music than sitting out front.\\"  Musical style and writing  Jamie Saint Merat said in an interview that \\"It's not a concept album in the traditional sense, but there is an obvious outlining theme. Basically, 'Everything is Fire' is a quote from Greek philosopher Heraclitus meaning everything is in a constant state of change and progression, more-so than chaos. One thing I have to point out is that it's not apocalyptic in any way, it's just a statement and an observation of how things are, or at least how they can be perceived.\\" Paul Kelland, who wrote all the lyrics to the album, described the title track as the \\"cornerstone\\" of the album. \\"Everything is in a constant state of change. We cannot accept anything as face value. Question and rationalise everything, and always continue to.\\" In a separate interview with Brutal Carnage Zine, Jamie Saint Merat described the album as mostly being a commentary on \\"human arrogance and how we perceive our place in our environments, how we deify objects and people out of pure tradition with very little rationalism.\\" PopMatters have described the album as \\"Firmly rooted in simple, suffocating death metal, yet willing to venture further and incorporate dissonance and expansive, atmospheric passages\\". Reviews by AllMusic and Sputnik Music have made comparisons to death metal bands such as Immolation, Gorguts, and Morbid Angel, post-metal bands such as Isis and Neurosis, as well as Shellac.  Critical reception  The album received universally positive reviews from critics, and appeared on Metalreview.com's 100 Most Essential Albums of the Decade. AllMusic's Phil Freeman wrote that \\"their ability to move the music forward at what seems like a crushingly slow pace while in fact playing quite fast is hypnotic\\", concluding that \\"this is a seriously impressive album by a band that deserves an audience far beyond their tiny homeland.\\" Sputnik Music gave the album a perfect rating in a wide- ranging review touching on all aspects of the album, describing Everything Is Fire as \\"the quintessential death metal album of its era, and the yardstick by which future efforts should be compared to.\\" Jaime Merat's performance on the drums was singled out for particular praise, as were Michael Hoggard's \\"frenetic mix of exotic chords and unorthodox progressions\\", and Paul Kelland's vocals and lyrics. \\"The band‚Äôs ability to shift from jarring riff barrages to liquid ceasefires and back is one of their most invaluable assets as songwriters, thanks in no small part to their meticulous calibration of aesthetics.\\" Track listing  Credits  Writing, performance and production credits are adapted from the album liner notes.

Biography Born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Maize attended Pius XI High School, before receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts in musical theater with a minor in communications and a minor in dance from Millikin University in Decatur, Illinois. After graduating, he relocated to Los Angeles where he began to work in television commercials before launching his film and television career. Career Among Maize's television roles, the most memorable may be Donny opposite Anthony LaPaglia in Without a Trace; Jake Lydell opposite Gary Sinise in CSI: NY; and the Orderly opposite Jamie Foxx in The Jamie Foxx Show. He also is conceivably noted for his portrayal as Artode in the vampire television drama Angel and Psycho Ranger Black, one of the Psycho Rangers, in Power Rangers in Space. Besides making a name for himself in the television industry, Maize also has had prominent roles in major Hollywood films such as the previously mentioned National Treasure: Book of Secrets opposite Ed Harris, starring Nicolas Cage, Jon Voight and Helen Mirren; and Eagle Eye opposite Rosario Dawson, starring Shia LaBeouf.

He shot and killed Dean J. Herman Wharton and himself at Syracuse University on April 2, 1921. Education and early employment Beckwith was born in Hawaii to a family of ministers and missionaries, and spent his early life there and in California. He received degrees in law from the University of California and the Pacific Theological Seminary, and in 1911 completed his Ph.D. in political science at Columbia University. While at Columbia he married Frances Robinson, the daughter of a Berkeley, California minister. Beckwith's dissertation, German Industrial Education and its Lessons for the United States, was the result of a trip to Germany to observe industrial education practices in the summer of 1911. The dissertation argued that \\"Germany has had probably the largest and most fruitful experience of such education and has most to teach us.\\"German Industrial Education, 7. It was reprinted by the Bureau of Education (then part of the United States Department of the Interior) in 1913. Beckwith has been cited as a significant part of academic and policy debates in the period about the potential for German-style industrial education in the United States. After completing his dissertation, he was appointed instructor in economics at Dartmouth College in the fall of 1911. He later described Dartmouth as \\"the toughest college in America\\"; he was dismissed not long after arrival, following conflicts with Dartmouth professor George R. Wicker. During World War I, he attended an officer's training camp but was discharged for physical disability, which began a long series of brief positions with a variety of institutions. In 1914, he worked for the California State Banking Commission, but was fired after complaints about his manner from the banks. In 1916 his wife, who had supported him at times during his career, left him, eventually remarrying. In the years following, he held positions at Grinnell College and the Northwestern University School of Commerce, both rather briefly. He taught for one year at Colorado College in 1920, where he became friendly with folklorist Stith Thompson, who had just begun his first academic appointment there. In his memoirs, Thompson describes Beckwith as \\"an extremely odd character, utterly unable to adapt to his environment.\\" Soon after, Thompson was asked by a department head to explain to Beckwith that he would not be reappointed; Thompson reports that his colleague \\"received me very cordially and seemed to appreciate my interest and frankness.\\" Shortly thereafter, Beckwith was appointed to his final position at Syracuse. After his death, Beckwith was described as having \\"Socialistic beliefs,\\" but was not active in any socialist organization. Murder and suicide In late March 1921, Beckwith was informed by Dean Wharton that he would be dismissed; after Beckwith protested, Wharton told him that students had complained about him. Beckwith argued with Wharton twice at his house, and went to see him a final time in the dean's office on April 2, bearing a letter, later found on Wharton's desk, declaring his dismissal to be unfair, and that other professors were more popular because they were \\"too lax\\"; he also carried a military revolver and a knife. Beckwith shot Wharton five times and himself once. After his death, a number of letters were found addressed to relatives and university administrators in Beckwith's hand; the letters complained of a life of failure and misunderstanding, apologized to relatives, and made clear that the murder was premeditated (and that Beckwith had contemplated murdering other academic administrators previously). Beckwith's uncle suggested the following day, in a statement of condolence and regret, that he did not believe his nephew \\"was dealing in personalities when he shot the Dean, but that the act was just his disordered expression of compensation for the wrongs and injustice he believed the world did him.\\" Physicians and psychologists interviewed by The New York Times suggested Beckwith had an \\"exaggerated ego\\" and compared him to the notorious murderer Harry Kendall Thaw.

The Mandelbulb is a three-dimensional fractal, constructed by Daniel White and Paul Nylander using spherical coordinates in 2009. A canonical 3-dimensional Mandelbrot set does not exist, since there is no 3-dimensional analogue of the 2-dimensional space of complex numbers. It is possible to construct Mandelbrot sets in 4 dimensions using quaternions and bicomplex numbers. White and Nylander's formula for the \\"nth power\\" of the vector {\\\\mathbf v} = \\\\langle x, y, z\\\\rangle in is :{\\\\mathbf v}^n := r^n\\\\langle\\\\sin(n\\\\theta)\\\\cos(n\\\\phi),\\\\sin(n\\\\theta)\\\\sin(n\\\\phi),\\\\cos(n\\\\theta)\\\\rangle where r=\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}, \\\\phi=\\\\arctan(y/x)=\\\\arg (x+yi), and \\\\theta=\\\\arctan(\\\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}/z)=\\\\arccos(z/r). The Mandelbulb is then defined as the set of those {\\\\mathbf c} in for which the orbit of \\\\langle 0, 0, 0\\\\rangle under the iteration {\\\\mathbf v} \\\\mapsto {\\\\mathbf v}^n+{\\\\mathbf c} is bounded. see \\"formula\\" section For n > 3, the result is a 3-dimensional bulb-like structure with fractal surface detail and a number of \\"lobes\\" depending on n. Many of their graphic renderings use n = 8\\\\. However, the equations can be simplified into rational polynomials when n is odd. For example, in the case n = 3, the third power can be simplified into the more elegant form: :\\\\langle x, y, z\\\\rangle^3 = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\ \\\\frac{(3z^2-x^2-y^2)x(x^2-3y^2)}{x^2+y^2} ,\\\\frac{(3z^2-x^2-y^2)y(3x^2-y^2)}{x^2+y^2},z(z^2-3x^2-3y^2)\\\\right\\\\rangle. : The Mandelbulb given by the formula above is actually one in a family of fractals given by parameters (p,q) given by: : :{\\\\mathbf v}^n := r^n\\\\langle\\\\sin(p\\\\theta)\\\\cos(q\\\\phi),\\\\sin(p\\\\theta)\\\\sin(q\\\\phi),\\\\cos(p\\\\theta)\\\\rangle : Since p and q do not necessarily have to equal n for the identity vn=vn to hold. More general fractals can be found by setting :{\\\\mathbf v}^n := r^n\\\\langle\\\\sin(f(\\\\theta,\\\\phi))\\\\cos(g(\\\\theta,\\\\phi)),\\\\sin(f(\\\\theta,\\\\phi))\\\\sin(g(\\\\theta,\\\\phi)),\\\\cos(f(\\\\theta,\\\\phi))\\\\rangle for functions f and g. Quadratic formula Other formulae come from identities which parametrise the sum of squares to give a power of the sum of squares such as: : (x^2-y^2-z^2)^2+(2 x z)^2+(2xy)^2 = (x^2+y^2+z^2)^2 which we can think of as a way to square a triplet of numbers so that the modulus is squared. So this gives, for example: : x\\\\rightarrow x^2-y^2-z^2+x_0 : y\\\\rightarrow 2 x z+y_0 : z\\\\rightarrow 2 x y +z_0 or various other permutations. This 'quadratic' formula can be applied several times to get many power-2 formulae. Cubic formula Cubic fractal Other formulae come from identities which parametrise the sum of squares to give a power of the sum of squares such as: : (x^3-3xy^2-3xz^2)^2+(y^3 - 3 y x^2 + y z^2)^2+(z^3 - 3 z x^2 + z y^2)^2 = (x^2+y^2+z^2)^3 which we can think of as a way to cube a triplet of numbers so that the modulus is cubed. So this gives: : x\\\\rightarrow x^3 - 3 x (y^2 + z^2) + x_0 or other permutations. : y\\\\rightarrow -y^3 + 3 y x^2 - y z^2 + y_0 : z\\\\rightarrow z^3 - 3 z x^2 + z y^2 + z_0 for example. This reduces to the complex fractal w\\\\rightarrow w^3+w_0 when z=0 and w\\\\rightarrow \\\\overline{w}^3+w_0 when y=0. There are several ways to combine two such \`cubic\` transforms to get a power-9 transform which has slightly more structure. Quintic formula Quintic Mandelbulb Quintic Mandelbulb with C=2 Another way to create Mandelbulbs with cubic symmetry is by taking the complex iteration formula z\\\\rightarrow z^{4m+1} + z_0 for some integer m and adding terms to make it symmetrical in 3 dimensions but keeping the cross-sections to be the same 2 dimensional fractal. (The 4 comes from the fact that i^4=1.) For example, take the case of z\\\\rightarrow z^5 + z_0. In two dimensions where z=x+iy this is: : x\\\\rightarrow x^5-10 x^3 y^2 + 5 x y^4 + x_0 : y\\\\rightarrow y^5-10 y^3 x^2 + 5 y x^4 + y_0 This can be then extended to three dimensions to give: : x\\\\rightarrow x^5 - 10 x^3 (y^2 + A y z + z^2) + 5 x (y^4 + B y^3 z + C y^2 z^2 + B y z^3 + z^4) + D x^2 y z (y+z) + x_0 : y\\\\rightarrow y^5 - 10 y^3 (z^2 + A x z + x^2) + 5 y (z^4 + B z^3 x + C z^2 x^2 + B z x^3 + x^4) + D y^2 z x (z+x)+ y_0 : z\\\\rightarrow z^5 - 10 z^3 (x^2 + A x y + y^2) + 5 z (x^4 + B x^3 y + C x^2 y^2 + B x y^3 + y^4) + D z^2 x y (x+y) +z_0 for arbitrary constants A,B,C and D which give different Mandelbulbs (usually set to 0). The case z \\\\rightarrow z^9 gives a Mandelbulb most similar to the first example where n=9. A more pleasing result for the fifth power is got basing it on the formula: z\\\\rightarrow -z^5 + z_0. Fractal based on z->-z^5 Power nine formula Fractal with z^9 Mandelbrot cross sections This fractal has cross- sections of the power 9 Mandelbrot fractal. It has 32 small bulbs sprouting from the main sphere. It is defined by, for example: : x\\\\rightarrow x^9-36 x^7 (y^2+z^2)+126 x^5 (y^2+z^2)^2-84 x^3 (y^2+z^2)^3+9 x (y^2+z^2)^4 + x_0 : y\\\\rightarrow y^9-36 y^7 (z^2+x^2)+126 y^5 (z^2+x^2)^2-84 y^3 (z^2+x^2)^3+9 y (z^2+x^2)^4 + y_0 : z\\\\rightarrow z^9-36 z^7 (x^2+y^2)+126 z^5 (x^2+y^2)^2-84 z^3 (x^2+y^2)^3+9 z (x^2+y^2)^4 + z_0 These formula can be written in a shorter way: : x\\\\rightarrow \\\\frac{1}{2}(x+i\\\\sqrt{y^2+z^2})^9+\\\\frac{1}{2}(x-i\\\\sqrt{y^2+z^2})^9+x_0 and equivalently for the other coordinates. Power nine fractal detail Spherical formula A perfect spherical formula can be defined as a formula: : (x,y,z)\\\\rightarrow( f(x,y,z)+x_0, g(x,y,z) + y_0, h(x,y,z) + z_0 ) where : (x^2+y^2+z^2)^n = f(x,y,z)^2+ g(x,y,z)^2+h(x,y,z)^2 where f,g and h are nth power rational trinomials and n is an integer. The cubic fractal above is an example.

The grant encompassed most of the present-day San Fernando Valley. Dise√±o del Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando History Eulogio de Celis, a native of Spain, had settled in California in 1836. De Celis operated a hide trading business with Henry D. Fitch, Jonathan Temple and Abel Stearns. He married Josefa Arg√ºello, daughter of Governor Lu√≠s Antonio Arg√ºello. In 1846, to raise war funds during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the Pico government sold the secularized lands from the Mission San Fernando to Eulogio de Celis. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim was filed with the United States Public Land Commission in 1852 and the land grant was patented to Eulogio de Celis in 1873. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 United States.

San Fernando Valley: 1880 map with land grant boundariesThe grant, which was supposed to contain fourteen square leagues, was bounded on the north by Rancho San Francisco and the Santa Susana Mountains, on the west by the Simi Hills, on the east by Rancho Tujunga, and on the south by the Monta√±as de Portesuelo (Santa Monica Mountains). When the Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando grant was patented in 1873, it was surveyed at nearly twenty six square leagues, the single largest land grant in California.C. A. Ensign, 1903, Notes of Litigation on the Title of a Mexican Land Grant, The Michigan Engineer, Volumes 22-25, pp1124-147, Michigan Engineering Society Before the De Celis grant, Andr√©s Pico, brother of Governor P√≠o Pico, had leased the Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando in 1845. In 1853, Andr√©s Pico acquired an undivided half interest, and Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando was split in half, along present-day Roscoe Boulevard, between Andr√©s Pico (who had the southern half of the ranch to the Santa Monica Mountains) and Eulogio de Celis (who had the northern half of the ranch to the Santa Susana Mountains). In debt, Andr√©s Pico had sold his southern half- interest in the Rancho ex-Mission San Fernando to his brother P√≠o Pico in 1862. Pio Pico sold his half share of the Ex-San Fernando Mission land to Isaac Lankershim (operating as the \\"San Fernando Farm Homestead Association\\") in 1869. In 1873, Isaac Lankershim's son, James Boon Lankershim, and future son-in-law, Isaac Newton Van Nuys, moved to the San Fernando Valley and took over management of the property.

The DTR signal is present on pin 20 of the 22-wire RS-232 interface using a DB-25 connector, and on pin 4 of a newer DE-9 serial port. The signal is asserted (logic \\"1\\") by raising the voltage of the pin from negative to positive. Dropping the signal back to its negative state indicates to the modem that the communications session shall be terminated. Signaling for modems The DTR signal is an important call control signal for a data modem. According to the RS232 standard, dropping DTR from active to inactive for at least two seconds tells the modem to disconnect (end) a call or data connection. When a modem is being used for automatic answering (such as with the command ATS0=1), the DTR signal confirms to the modem that the computer is available to accept a call. When a computer wants to place a call, it asserts the DTR signal before sending commands. If the DTR signal is not asserted and the modem receives a dial command, modems either refuse to place the call, or they silently disable DTR support for the duration of that call; the actual behavior depends on the modem software. Other aspects of responses to changes in DTR can be manually overridden or configured on most newer modems. and higher values are used by some vendors. Many external modems have LED indicators on the front, one of which is TR (\\"terminal ready\\"). This light follows the state of the DTR pin. The light is on when DTR is high, and off when it is low. Modems will typically keep the TR light illuminated when the AT&D0; command is used to force the modem to ignore the DTR signal, regardless of the pin's actual state. Null modem operation When a serial connection is made between two computers using a null modem adapter, the DTR and the Data Carrier Detect (DCD) lines are typically paired. This allows both ends of the connection to sense when the connection is active. On many operating systems, including Windows, the DTR line is held low while the serial port is unused and not being controlled by any applications. Use for flow control On some printers with serial interfaces, the DTR line is used for hardware flow control, similar to the use of RTS and CTS for modems. This practice is not consistent; other printers define RTS for this same purpose. When DTR is used for flow control, it manages the flow of data from the printer to the computer. However, because during printing, the bulk of the data is from the computer to the printer, the importance of flow control in the opposite direction is minimal. Use as a power pin On some hardware the DTR line (along with RTS) may be used to provide power. The most notable example of this is a serial mouse. The DE-9 serial port on the PC does not provide any dedicated power source. The mouse driver holds the DTR and RTS lines high at all times so that the device has a source of power. Another category of devices commonly powered by the DTR line includes converters between RS-232 and other serial standards such as RS-422 and RS-485.

UFOV performance is correlated with a number of important real- world functions including risk of an automobile crash. Performance can be improved by computer-based training.  History  UFOV assessment and training programs were primarily developed by Karlene Ball of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Daniel Roenker of Western Kentucky University.

UFOV assessment  The traditional UFOV assessment is a computer-based visual test containing three subtests. 1\\\\. Processing Speed: Determines a person's threshold for discriminating stimuli presented in central vision. 2\\\\. Divided Attention: Same as Subtest 1 but with the addition of a concurrent peripheral target location task. 3\\\\. Selective Attention: Same as Subtest 2 but with the addition of distracters. The threshold scores are combined to produce an overall performance score. Performance on the UFOV assessment is correlated with a number of real-world functions including driving and walking. Here are some examples: * Several studies have shown that a reduction in UFOV is correlated with an increased risk of an automobile accident with poor performers being about twice as likely to have an automobile crash than good performers.Ball, K. and C.

It is a gated bedroom community nestled in the Diablo Range, whence it gets its name. Diablo Grande sits at an elevation of . It is about southwest of Patterson. The 2010 United States census reported Diablo Grande's population was 826. The 2018 estimated population was 1,200. Background A gated community and golf resort developed by Don Panoz, in May 1990, the Patterson city council received preliminary plans for Diablo Grande. The project was later approved in the fall of 1993. By 1999, the Stanislaus County superior court had rejected Diablo Grande's second environmental impact report with the argument that it had failed to properly protect the surrounding environment and there was no answer to where water would come from due to the area not containing adequate on-site water. In response to these claims, Diablo Grande created the Western Hills Water District to serve the community. Water transfers from former agriculture land to the community were arranged and 12,000 acres have been preserved for wildlife. Developer Donald Panoz envisioned Diablo Grande to consist of 5,000 to 10,000 homes, a resort hotel and spa, six golf courses, an equestrian center, vineyards, a winery and commercial properties, including a high-tech research park. After investing $120 million into Diablo Grande and the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 occurring, the investors of the community filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy on March 10, 2008. There were more than $54 million in unpaid debts and 70 out of the 350 homes built faced foreclosure. In October 2008, World International LLC purchased Diablo Grande for $20 million. The California Department of Health temporarily suspended new building permits in January 2009 when water tests showed Trihalomethane levels at 0.103 milligrams per liter vs. the state standard of 0.080 milligrams per liter. Diablo Grande's Legends golf course, designed by Jack Nicklaus and Gene Sarazen, was closed in March 2014 due to the drought in California. In May 2017, the Stanislaus County Board of Supervisors approved a revised plan for the community. An additional 1,000 single-family homes could be built by reducing the number of condos and townhouses and eliminating apartments. Also, instead of building homes spread along the hillsides, residential areas will be grouped together, leaving more open terrain and walking trails. The revised plan brings the total number of housing units to 2,354. By the fall of 2019, it was announced that the remaining golf course at Diablo Grande would close in October. It was also revealed that World International has outstanding tax bills on about half of its 340 parcels at Diablo Grande, totaling more than $6 million, and is looking for a new owner. On May 7, 2020, World International, LLC sold substantially all of its property within the Phase 1 development area of the District to Angel‚Äôs Crossing, LLC.https://emma.msrb.org/SS1380547-SS1074930-SS1482212.pdf On August 19, 2020 at 3:00 PM Pacific Time, due to the SCU Lightning Complex fires of 2020, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Prevention issued an evacuation order of Diablo Grande.

He worked as a sailor aboard a slave ship as a young man, and became an abolitionist as a result. After losing his own vision, he opened a school for the blind, the oldest continuous such school in the world. Early life Edward Rushton was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England on 13 November 1756. He was enrolled at the Liverpool Free School from the age of 6 until the age of 9. He left school and at the age of 11 he became an apprentice with Messrs. Watt and Gregson, a firm that traded in the West Indies. Life at sea Rushton quickly became an experienced sailor. For example, at age 16, he took the helm of a ship which the captain and crew were about to abandon and guided them safely back to Liverpool. Because of this event, he was promoted from his apprenticeship to the position of second mate. In addition, at the age of 17 he survived the sinking of a slave ship he was aboard while on the way back from Guinea. Working with human cargo gave Rushton first-hand experience with the ways that slaves were treated, and caused him to become an abolitionist later in life. In 1773, the same year that he survived the ship sinking, Rushton was sailing to Dominica with human cargo when a highly contagious outbreak of ophthalmia struck many of the slaves. The disease spread quickly and Rushton was appalled with the conditions that the slaves had to endure, so he would sneak food and water to them. He also reprimanded the captain, and because of this he was ultimately charged with mutiny. However, his contact with the slaves during the outbreak caused him to contract ophthalmia himself, and he became completely blind in his left eye and developed a cataract-like condition in his right eye. Abolitionist and literary career in Liverpool Unable to sail because of his blindness, Rushton returned to Liverpool and moved in with his sister. He was supported financially by his father, and hired local boys to come read to him every week. He began to learn more about politics and philosophy, and started writing about these topics through dictation to the boys. His first poem, The Dismembered Empire, was published in 1782. In it, he criticised British rulers using the framework of the American War. Rushton also wrote letters to his heroes George Washington and Thomas Paine to ask why they were not using their public influence to oppose slavery, but neither man replied. Rushton was married in 1784 to Isabelle Rain. His father tried to set him up to run a tavern and make some money, but he was unsuited to the work and continued to write. His rhetorical battle against the slave trade continued with The West Indian Eclogues, a poem which was published in 1787. Rushton continued writing, using his firsthand experience with the slave trade and other experiences at sea for inspiration. His poetry became popular and he gained a reputation as a radical abolitionist author. Thomas Clarkson even personally sought out Rushton to credit his contribution to the abolitionist movement. Soon after the publication of The West Indian Eclogues, Rushton became the editor of the Liverpool Herald. However, this was short-lived due to his radical ideals. When Rushton's partner suggested that he retract a particularly radical editorial, Rushton resigned. This incident inspired the poem Will Clewline. He tried to become a bookseller as well, but his outspoken views did nothing but gain him enemies. Rushton made no attempts to censor his radical beliefs about the French Revolution or the social unrest in Britain. Work with the blind Eventually, Rushton was able to make enough money from bookselling to live comfortably and educate his children. In the late 1780s, he became a member of the literary and philosophical society and began donating money to help blind paupers. This led to Rushton establishing the Liverpool School for the Indigent Blind, which opened in 1791, second only in the world to the Paris school. The school now exists under the name of The Royal School for the Blind, Liverpool. In 1807, Rushton had an operation which allowed him to regain his sight. For the first time in 33 years, he was able to see his wife and children. In 1811, his wife Isabella and one of his daughters both died. Rushton died on 22 November 1814 of paralysis in Liverpool, Lancashire, England (UK).

The process continued to evolve in America following the emigration of German Reform Jews towards the end of the century. Emancipation We may attribute these events to a new dialectic obtaining between Jews who saw themselves as reformers and the views held at the time by the majority of Jews in the world. Although a modernist tendency was already present within European Jewish thought, the French Revolution and its aftermath gave free rein to those who wished to remake Judaism based on the new relationship Judaism had with Western society. Revision of the service The novel experience of life \\"as citizens\\" was for Jews, as if a mirror had been cast in front of them. They appraised themselves in relation to non-Jews as they never had before and felt the need to accommodate the new situation in religious as well as in civic life. > ...ancient Jewish ritual practices stood in pale contrast to the enlightened > modern church. The church offered participatory rites punctuated by the > singing of moving hymns by the congregation and impressive performances by > professional choirs singing the glorious music of Bach and Mozart‚Äîcomplete > with stirring instrumental accompaniments. The synagogue offered > unaccompanied Eastern chants known only to a limited inner circle of > chazzanim, recited in an antique, literally backward and virtually > incomprehensible language. How could Judaism hope to compete on such a > stage? The only possible answer was to reformulate Judaism to suit the > sensibilities of the modern era. The model for change tended to be the relatively staid Protestant service. The Orthodox service, previously marked by its fervor, slowly changed into a \\"modern\\" synagogue ritual in an attempt to achieve the decorum that was thought to go with recognition by the state. Many aspects of the way in which prayer was rendered (and therefore the music) changed rapidly. \\"Unsuitable traditional singing which interrupts the prayer\\" was curtailed, and congregants were \\"reminded and ordered to follow the cantor's prayers quietly and silently\\", cited by Rather than rabbis, the first figures to make and attempt reform were laymen. The first successful reformer of synagogue ritual was Israel Jacobson (1768‚Äì1822), a wealthy and influential merchant. His goal was to reform ritual as well as religious education of the Jews in Germany. In Seesen (in Lower Saxony) in 1810, he erected the first Reform temple on the grounds of a boys' school. Many innovations were based on the Christian model. The temple had a bell used to announce the time of prayer. For the first time sermons were delivered in German. Jacobson was the first to introduce confirmation. Overturning the traditional musical style As well as taking responsibility for re-arranging the ritual, the music was also changed. Jacobson installed an organ. A children's service was set, into which he introduced hymns that used tunes from Protestant chorales. The chanting of the Pentateuch and Prophets and prayers according to traditional modes were discarded. The service was read without chant, meaning that there was no longer the need for a chazzan; at least not a chazzan who could only function in the traditional capacity. > Not only were congregants quieted, but also the high and low voiced singers > who used to accompany the chazzan were replaced by decorous choruses as > change spread across the German lands community by community throughout the > first half of the nineteenth century. Hymns in German replaced the old > piyutim, [liturgical poems] which began to be curtailed or proscribed > altogether., cited by The pioneer of Jewish musicology A. Z. Idelsohn (1882‚Äì1938) observes that as long as Jews lived in the belief that their stay in the Diaspora was compulsory galut (exile), as long as it was necessary to hope for a return to Palestine, they instinctively preserved the Semitic-Oriental element in themselves and in their cultural creations. Again, this self-assessment was altered by their self-appraisal as 'citizens' of a nation. The Reform usage of the term 'temple' for their places of worship (rather than 'synagogue') was intended to convey a renunciation of any desire to rebuild the Temple of Jerusalem; one of the crucial events anticipated by those who envisioned the inevitable return of the Jews to the Levant. Since it was no longer necessary to engender this hope via stylistic elements in their music, Western European melodic and harmonic techniques could be embraced without constraint. Idelsohn explains: > [Rather than abandon Judaism altogether it was thought to] reform their > Judaism, by which they meant to cut away exotic, Semitic-Oriental parts, and > retain only that part of Judaism which was of a general religious and > ethical nature. The idea was so to remodel Judaism that it should not be a > stumbling block by reason of its Orientalism and medievalism, that it should > be as easy to observe as is Christianity, that, furthermore, the modern Jew > should not be offended by its strangeness and should be attracted by its > European exterior. But there was a limit to the amount of change the even a liberal congregation would accept. In Berlin, Jacob Herz Beer (1769‚Äì1825) a banker and sugar manufacturer,Wilhelmy-Dollinger, Petra. \\"Berlin Salons: Late Eighteenth to Early Twentieth Century.\\" Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 1 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive. November 16, 2009 the father of the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer (1791‚Äì1864) opened a temple in his home according to Jacobson's program. His son (who happened to oppose the use of the organ in Jewish services‚Äîsee below) arranged the music. But from the beginning, Beer was constrained to engage a chazzan in order to attract a greater audience. Back in Seer, Jacobson also acquiesced to public demand and engaged Chazzan Hirsch Goldberg (1807‚Äì1893). Together with Julius Freudenthal (1805‚Äì1874) (his famous tune to Ein Keloheinu is still sung today) they modernized synagogue song eventually publishing a collection of solos and two- part choir arrangements. From Chazzan to Cantor At this point, the new Reform model retained the chazzan's title, but he was beginning to be valued less for his abilities as a soloist and more for his skill in either composing new works or arranging old melodies for the congregation to sing. The new arrangements may have required solo from the chazzan, but it was no longer requisite to sing long solos (or even have a particularly good voice!) in order to be effective. Things were becoming more 'democratic' with regard to who did the singing, but rather than threatening the role of the cantor, this trend enhanced it, because the new responsibilities of composer, arranger, and conductor required conservatory training. The first of the great cantor- composers were Salomon Sulzer, Samuel Naumbourg, and Louis Lewandowski, who held posts in Vienna, Paris, and Berlin, respectively. They created melodies that are today considered 'traditional' in synagogues, temples, and even little shteiblachs of every variety. Their arrangements are still required study for student cantors and continue to be sung by choirs of all levels. Their profiles and achievements are well-documented elsewhere. Here we will deal with a single issue or event, seemingly unimportant in relation to the rest of their work, but having considerable impact on the Reform cantorate or music in Reform temples. Salomon Sulzer's advocacy of the organ Salomon Sulzer (1808‚Äì1890) was the legendary oberkantor ('chief cantor') of Vienna. He was the first to consciously devise this role (and the title), basing it on the example of J.S. Bach. He is revered as an innovative composer, a singer of marvelous range and expression (a tenor/baritone) and as a prominent teacher, having been a member of the Vienna Conservatory faculty. His compositions combined 'old' and 'new' by setting traditional melodies in arrangement for four-part chorus, influencing the musical style of many synagogues in Eastern and Central Europe. Sulzer's main contributions to synagogue music did not take place as a part of Radical Reform Judaism in Germany, but rather in the context of the Viennese Rite, which was more akin ideologically to the Neologue Synagogues of Hungary and the teachings of Zecharias Frankel. Sulzer took a progressive position on the renewal of vocal music in the synagogue, however he opposed the use of the German language in the Jewish service, and initially the use of organ, and his view won out. Though often erroneously referred to as Reform, the Vienna Stadttemple was, in fact, more akin to a contemporary modern Orthodox synagogue. Max Wohlberg wrote, ‚ÄúThe Jews of Vienna eschewed the rationalistic and universalistic ideas of extreme Reform and preferred the milder nationalistic and historic views that were later crystallized by Leopold Zunz, Abraham Geiger, Zechariah Frankel, and even Samson Raphael Hirsch.‚Äù The service was officiated strictly by men, and women sat separately. Although some piyyutim were removed, and a few prayers added in the vernacular, the liturgy was, for the most part, the traditional liturgy, (as opposed to the liturgy of radical Reform) as evidenced by Sulzer's primary notated musical compendia, Shir Zion (published between 1840 and 1866). The choir of Sulzer's time consisted strictly of men and boys. Though there were optional organ accompaniments in many of the pieces, the organ was not used during services on the Sabbath and Holidays. Vienna was then the music capital of the world and even chazzanim from Orthodox Eastern Europe came to Vienna in order to learn something of the new style. Singing and choirs were introduced without much controversy, but when it came to the organ, synagogues were more hesitant, even negative. Meyerbeer, (noted above) when he was asked to compose a work for the consecration of the new Jewish house of worship in Vienna, once made the following comment on music in the synagogue: > You are not about to introduce an organ into the synagogue! That is a purely > Christian instrument. What next! ...The human being in prayer should speak > to his god without any intermediary. This is what the Jews have done since > the destruction of the Temple; it has been the custom for two millennia. We > should make no innovations. But if they are determined to have different > music, it should in my opinion, be music from trombones and flutes, like > those that resounded in the Temple of Solomon.Foyer (Leipzig: 1898), in Max > Grunwald, Der Kampf um die Orgel in der Wiener Israelitischen > Kultusgemeinde. (Vienna: Verlag von Dr. Bloch's Volkenshrift, 1919), p. 17. > Cited in . The first Jewish synod at Leipzig, in June 1869, brought together rabbis and community leaders from all over Europe, the United States, and even the West Indies to discuss the ideas of \\"enlightened\\" and liberal Judaism. Salomon Sulzer was a deputy in the synod; the sole representative of cantors and synagogue musicians‚Äîtestifying to the high regard the body of liberal rabbis held for this cantor and their understanding that music was a critical element in the 'liberal' congregations they envisioned. In his address, Sulzer brought up the issue of the organ. > An instrumental accompaniment of the singing during the worship service > [should] be introduced everywhere, in order to make it easier for the > members of the congregation to take an active part in the same. ...the organ > is worthy of recommendation for the required accompaniment, and there are no > religious objections to its us on the Sabbath and on holidays.Salomon > Sulzer, motion. Summarized in Verhandlungen der ersten Israelitischen Synode > zu Leipzig (Berlin: 1969), pp. 250f. Cited in . The Synod agreed; no objections were raised to its use on the Shabbat and on holidays, in turn recommending that introduction of the organ proceed. Sulzer emphasizes the solo role of the organ; its necessity over and above that of other instruments: > Only the organ is capable of leading the congregations in song, regulating > it, masking dissonances; and it should properly be reintroduced into the > space that was denied it for all too long in public worship, to the > detriment of religious edification The organ makes the priestly office of > the chazzan independent of the latter's artistry, and yet saves him from the > type of egotistical pseudo-artistry that falls upon the seed of the > aesthetically beautiful like mildew and poisons it; it preserves him from > the use of those trivial decorative vocal flourishes that provincial cantors > use and abuse to appeal to the masses, or the sentimental Polish virtuosity > that drives the younger generation, which is generally musically educated, > to flee the house of the Lord.Salomon Sulzer, \\"Denkschrift an die...Weiner > Cultus-Gemeinde\\", (Vienna: 1876), cited in Avenar, ed., ' 'Kantor Salomon > Sulzer und seine Zeit,' ' pp. 172f. Samuel Naumbourg and composers outside of the synagogue Samuel Naumbourg (1817‚Äì1880) was descended from ten generations of chazzanim. He grew up in the world of Southern Ashkenazic chazzanut, and was with musicality and intelligence. His was trained in Munich, but his city would be Paris; the major European capital perhaps best distinguished by the significant role influence plays behind the scenes when it comes to music-making. Naumbourg arrived in Paris in 1843 and began a friendship with Jacques Fromental Hal√©vy, to whom he had been recommended. Naumbourg pursued the position of director of music at the synagogue in rue Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth, a community that had not had chazzan since the death of Israel Lovey in 1832 and the service was in disarray. Anything he proposed however, would have to pass through government's Department of Cults and Education. He submitted an application for the post, which was well-received due in part to favorable endorsement of Hal√©vy: > I was able to form an opinion of his musical studies, and read his > compositions. I am of the opinion that he is most suitable to be called to > the important position now vacant and that he is capable of elevating it to > the height of its true aim. He is keen, motivated by a desire to do well, > and should give the organization good musical service, talent, and > commitment.J.F.Hal√©vy,\\"Letter to the Jewish Consistory\\" in Jordan, R. > Fromental Hal√©vy: His Life and Music. New York: Proscenium. 1989. p. 177 On his appointment Naumbourg immediately began compiling an anthology of traditional liturgical songs. His great innovation was to include, for the first time songs for soloists and choir commissioned from professional composers. Among the hundreds for traditional ones published in the first two volumes of his Zemirot Yisrael in 1847 and the third volume published in 1865 under the subtitle Shirei Kodesh there were two or three by Charles-Valentin Alkan n√© Morhange (1813‚Äì1888), one by Meyerbeer, and several by Hal√©vy. His 1874 anthology Aggudat Shirim posthumously included three more Hal√©vy settings. How Louis Lewandowski got hired The story of the rise of Louis Lewandowski (1821‚Äì1894) illustrates the struggle between the 'old guard' and the 'new guard'. Eventually, the innovations of Jacob Beer in Berlin were curtailed by the government's forced closure of his synagogue. This led to a conservative reaction on the part of the Jewish Community in Berlin, and the appointment of one Asher Lion (1776‚Äì1863) as the chazzan of the Reform temple. Lion re-introduced the old 18th-century chazzanut. This 'restoration' would seem to have effectively discredited Beer's 'adventurism'. Although the hackneyed style Lion proffered continued to predominate until about the middle of the century, his appointment to Berlin Synagogue would ultimately ensure the emergence of the modern cantorate. At the age of 12, Lewandowski was sent to Berlin to study at the conservatory where he was expected to become 'the Jewish Mendelssohn.' He became a singerl (lit.\\"little singer\\"; a child who appeared as a featured soloist or in duets with the chazzan). Lewandowski had no desire to follow Lion into Jewish music until he came under the sway of Hirsch Weintraub (1817‚Äì1881) an itinerant synagogue musician. His compositions were some of the first to effectively combine the best of gentile musicianship with traditional oriental elements. The music, consisting of arrangements for choir and string quartets, had a profound Jewish feeling but was rendered in a very sophisticated style. Much of it was based on the best of Mozart and Haydn. Some of the latter's string quartets, for example, were arranged to be sung by Weintraub's choir. This impressed Lewandowski (who had previously rejected the possibility of fusing these two seemingly contrary styles) along with the rest of the Berlin audiences who attended the performances on Weintraub's tour. Lewandowski began writing in the style he would eventually master. Asher Lion, meanwhile, was forced to come to terms with this sudden evolution in the taste of the Berlin community. But because Lion was virtually untrained in modern composition, he could not read choir parts. After trying different ruses to obtain some understanding of the 'new music', he attempted to cajole Weintraub's quartet to join him and thereby obtain the music. He succeeded in enlisting the tenor, but it turned out that the tenor only knew his own parts! Lion was informed by this same tenor, that Weintraub actually utilized the scores of Sulzer, which were at the time still in manuscript. Under the assumption that a Sulzer manuscript would be impossible to obtain, he demanded just that from his synagogue committee. When they actually managed to get one and present it to him, a real crisis ensued. Sulzer wrote using a different clef for each part! Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass. In desperation Lion eventually turned to the young Lewandowski to help him decipher the notes, finally just giving him the job of directing the choir. Lion realized that Lewandowski was indispensable to him and eventually Lewandowski's position as 'Choir Master' was made permanent‚Äîthe first time that this title was recognized in synagogue setting. America Until the 19th century the roles of the chazzanim in America were similar to the ones they played in the old world during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance; they served as shochtim, mohelim, and as religious schoolteachers. Their primary duties were not musical, although they presided at marriages and burials and chanted the service. There were no ordained Rabbis in the United States until the 1840s when the first major wave of German Jews arrived. Of course they brought with them the reforms that had been initiated in Europe, along with the nascent musical forms. At first, the choir director and the organ had more of an influence on the services than the chazzan. By mid-century, the situation resembled the one that prevailed in Europe. As in the services being held in Germany and France, the Hebrew texts were abbreviated, many of the prayers were in the national tongue‚ÄîEnglish. There was an organ and the traditional chanting had been replaced by congregational singing of a mixed choir. It would have been impossible for a traditionally-trained chazzan to lead a Reform service. Isaac Mayer Wise (1819‚Äì1900) a founder of the Reform Movement in America, described the old-time chazzan as 'half priest, half beggar, half oracle, half fool, as the occasion demanded.' The first person to re-establish a pivotal role for the chazzan was Alois Kaiser (1840‚Äì1908) Kaiser had been a member of Sulzer's choir as a boy, had conservatory training, and had served as a Cantor in the suburbs of Vienna. Beginning in 1866 he served at the congregation Oheib Shalom in Baltimore. He introduced classical compositions and operatic arias to be used as melodies, and wrote his own compositions in a similar style. In general, the shortened service, the choir, and the organ made a cantor unnecessary, 'but if a musical leader came along who know how to reshape and revitalize the service, the laity might be swayed by his personality'., cited by > In 1894, Temple Sinai of New Orleans hired the Hungarian-born Cantor Julius > Braunfeld.... Cincinnati's K.K. B'nai Yeshurun, which had abolished the > traditional office of 'Reader'... ...decided to reverse itself by seeking to > employ not an old style chazzan but a contemporary Reform style cantor. Note the use of the title 'Cantor'. This of course, was the title first used by Salomon Sulzer; Sulzer remained the ideal of what a Cantor ought to be. His Austrian, Hungarian, and German disciples within the American Reform ambiance created a distinctive niche for the temple cantor. Edward Stark Cantor Edward Stark (1856‚Äì1913) was one of these disciples. Stark served San Francisco's Emanu-El from 1893 through the following two decades. Stark's father, Cantor Joseph Stark, had trained in Vienna with Sulzer and transmitted the legacy to his son. On the West Coast, Edward Stark (1856‚Äì1913) proceeded in much the same way. He and his congregations expected excellent performances from the non-Jewish singers hired for the choir. He supplemented his own work with the new compositions of Sulzer. Like the European synagogue masters, he adapted music of Haydn, Gounod, Schubert, and Mendelssohn, as well as anthems from the Protestant tradition. Sulzer's works were frequently included in services conducted by American Cantors at this time, along with works of their own. The prominence that music had, and the combination of the cantor's solo work, the choral numbers, and congregational singing, made the services at Reform temples unique within the American Jewish scene., cited by Here is Cantor Stark's job description as it appeared in the \\"Bylaws of the Congregation Emanu-El\\" > Article II.

A Hymnal The creation of the Society of American Cantors in 1897 was partly in order to facilitate the composition of a hymnal for the UAHC (Union of American Hebrew Congregations). The first Union Hymnal (1897) they created featured abundant hymns, English translations of Hebrew prayers, adaptations of Protestant \\"favorites\\", and rearrangements of European classical music used as settings. The Central Conference of American Rabbis endorsed its use in 1903 \\"so that it may in reality become what it was intended to be, a bond of union for all congregations throughout the land.\\"Yearbook of the Central Conference of American Rabbis Vol. XIII Baltimore: Friedenwald. 1904. p. 96 The role of the cantor in the Reform movement had entirely changed in the hundred years since Israel Jacobson founded his school in Seesen. Though the cantor's relationship to the new synagogue had been tenuous‚Äîat times eliminated altogether‚ÄîCCAR's endorsement of the Union Hymnal also endorsed the role of the modern cantor: a trained musician familiar with Jewish tradition and sensitive to the needs of his community.

The exact date of the battle is unknown but happened on one day in mid June, 1788, in the Pinal Mountains of east central Arizona. Battle Beginning on May 31, 1788, to June 24, Captain Pablo Romero of the Spanish Army led a 208-man force of Sonoran troops that killed eleven Apache warriors and four women and children. Thirty-four Apache men, women and children were captured. The Apaches slain included a chieftain named Quilcho. Romero's expedition recovered two captive Pimas from Tucson and eleven animals, with a loss of two men dead. The so-called highlight of this offensive was a battle in the Pinal Mountains. Ensign Jos√© Moraga with about ten men from their pack-train escort decided to scout ahead of the wagon train. After scouting a little while in the extreme front on horseback, the force spotted and attacked a rancher√≠a, protected by \\"no more than 100 enemies\\". After Moraga slayed one Apache himself in hand-to-hand combat, Captain Romero, commanding the main force, heard the firing and raced to the scene, arriving just before the battle ended where his men were skirmishing a bit. The Spaniards lost one man, but killed six Apache warriors. Aftermath Captain Romero evidently left straightaway after the expedition ended to report to the commandant of arms in Arizpe how well he had succeeded in his sweep across Apacheria, so the King of Spain granted him a commission. However, shortly thereafter, on June 30, a band of Apaches caught and killed him on the hill of San Borja between Sonora and Bacoachi. Thus, Romero did not live to see the king's commission granting him 2,400 pesos salary. Romero left a widow, Do√±a Luisa Boj√≥rquez, and at least two sons.

Brown & Hawkins was a business venture between partners Charles E. Brown of Montreal, Quebec, Canada and T.W. Hawkins of Roanoke, Virginia. The two men met in Nome during the Gold Rush. They first started business together in Valdez in 1900 before moving to Seward in 1903. Their business in Seward included a store and bank. The store building began as a one-story frontier store with a low false front in 1903. It evolved through four periods of construction to add and modify additional structures. As of 2009 Brown & Hawkins was still owned by the Hawkins family, making it the oldest store in Alaska under the same ownership. The original Mosler safe and brass cash register were displayed in the store. On June 4, 2019, Brown & Hawkins Building was sold to Jeffrey and Michelle Cobble. ‚ÄúThe sale of the building is really big news. According to First American Title, it is the last parcel of land that has remained with the family of one of Seward‚Äôs founding fathers to be title transferred.

The project was constructed to alleviate flooding of Lowell Creek in Seward. It was the first flood control project completed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Alaska. Originally, Lowell Creek ran through Seward along what is now Jefferson Street. Beginning with the town's establishment in 1903, the fast-moving stream produced one to three severe floods a year until the tunnel was built in 1939. The floods carried large amounts of debris from the mountains; one flood deposited 10,000 cubic yards in an 11-hour period in 1935. In 1927 the Alaska Railroad constructed a small diversion dam and flume to carry debris down Jefferson Street to drain into Resurrection Bay. However, by 1937 these structures had deteriorated beyond repair. Consequently, the Army Corps of Engineers began construction of the new project in August 1939. The project consisted of: #a diversion dam, in length and up to high that diverted the creek away from its original path; #a tunnel through Bear Mountain, in length and in width; #an outlet flume, in length and in width which drains into Resurrection Bay. Completed in 1940, this system withstood the 1964 Alaska earthquake, as well as severe floods in 1966, 1986, and 1995, which brought the water level within inches of cresting the dam. The tunnel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Though the project has prevented significant flooding of the city of Seward, debris continues to accumulate at the outlet of the flume and the city must work to move the debris further into the bay. With the significant risk of debris accumulation during a flooding event, new projects are being considered to replace the diversion tunnel ‚Äî including construction of a new, wider tunnel through Bear Mountain at a cost of $30 million, or an aqueduct underneath Jefferson Street.

Wright (eds.), A Handbook of Romanticism Studies, John Wiley & Sons, 2016, p. 334. (better known by the pseudonym \\"Novalis\\"). The works of Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling expounded the Romantic doctrine in philosophy, whereas the theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher demonstrated the necessity of individualism in religious thought.Despite the fact that Schleiermacher did not work in Jena, he was deeply influenced by the writings of the Jena Romantics (see Paola Mayer, Jena Romanticism and Its Appropriation of Jakob B√∂hme, McGill-Queen's University Press, 1999, p. 101). Other notable representatives of the movement include August Ludwig H√ºlsenEzequiel L. Posesorski, Between Reinhold and Fichte: August Ludwig H√ºlsen's Contribution to the Emergence of German Idealism. Karlsruhe: Karlsruher Institut f√ºr Technologie, 2012, p. 199. and Friedrich H√∂lderlin.Paul Redding, Continental Idealism: Leibniz to Nietzsche, Routledge, 2009, ch. 8. By 1804, the circle in Jena had dispersed. A second phase of Romanticism was initiated two years later in Heidelberg with Heidelberg Romanticism and in Berlin with Berlin Romanticism.

Poe announced his candidacy in January 2009 and was the first Democrat to announce his intention to run for governor. He has worked with various administrations in Alaska under former Governors Bill Sheffield, Steve Cowper, Tony Knowles, and Wally Hickel. On June 14, 2010 he announced that he was withdrawing from the gubernatorial race.Epler P. (2010). Poe drops gubernatorial bid. Alaska Dispatch.  Early life and education Poe spent his early years in the Sherwood Forest neighborhood of Webster Groves, St. Louis, Missouri. Poe's mother was a teacher, and his father received training in dentistry. Poe's father was forced to cease studying dentistry after he experienced momentary blindness. He graduated from De Smet Jesuit High School. In 1977, he earned a bachelor's degree in business finance from the University of Missouri-St. Louis (UMSL). Poe studied for a Master of Business Administration from the same university, earning his degree in 1979 with a concentration in international finance and economics. Career Around the time he earned his MBA, Poe took a job with the professional services firm Price Waterhouse as a business consultant, and was working in Springfield, Illinois when an opportunity with the company came up to design a new accounting system for the State of Alaska. Poe, who was an avid mountain climber, leaped at the opportunity to move to Alaska and arrived in the state capitol of Juneau in January 1981. The accounting system he created, which came to be known as the Alaska Statewide Accounting System (AKSAS), is still in use in 2009. Democratic Governor Bill Sheffield offered Poe a position in Alaska's Office of Management and Budget in 1983, allowing him to work on creating a new budgeting system for the state. In 1985, Poe went on to work for Coopers & Lybrand, working on financial projects including the valuation of Eklutna River hydroelectric dam and the Snettisham hydroelectric dam. Democratic Governor Steve Cowper asked Poe to be the Deputy Commissioner of Transportation and Public Facilities in 1987. Under Poe's supervision, the Department of Transportation's was able to provide a $240 million return to the state. In 1988, Governor Cowper appointed Poe as the Director of International Trade. Poe managed the state's international trade offices in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and was in charge of overseeing trade relations with the Russian government. By 1993, Poe was working for the state Senate Finance Committee, and reported to Republican state senator Drue Pearce. He was appointed by (at the time, Alaskan Independence Party member) Governor Wally Hickel, as Director of Administrative Services for the Alaska Department of Environment Conservation. Poe began working for the state again in 1997 when Governor Knowles asked him to take over as Business Development Manager of the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA). In 1998, Poe was asked by Governor Knowles to be the Y2K Senior Project Manager, in addition to appointing him Commissioner of Administration, a confirmed cabinet position that Poe held until he was appointed as Executive Director of AIDEA and the Alaska Energy Authority in 2000. Poe became the Vice President of the ASCG Inc., a subsidiary of the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, and in 2004 he became the President and CEO of the Anchorage Economic Development Corporation (AEDC). Poe, in his early adulthood, was a registered Democrat. When he was employed by Republican state senator Drue Pearce, he momentarily registered as a Republican. In January 2009, Poe proclaimed his intent to run as a Democratic candidate for governor. In the intervening periods of time, he was an undeclared voter. Poe characterizes himself as a fiscal conservative and as a pro-business, pro-development Democrat. Run for governor On January 8, 2009, Bob Poe announced his candidacy for Governor of Alaska in the 2010 Alaska gubernatorial election.

Measuring in length, the river originates from Sri Padhaya and reach the sea at Kalutara. The Black River flows through the Ratnapura and the Kalutara District and pass the city Ratnapura. The mountainous forests in the Central Province and the Sinharaja Forest Reserve are the main sources of water for the river. Development of a Flood Forecasting Model For Kalu River and Kelani River Basins in Sri Lanka using Radial Basis Function Neural Networks Kalu Ganga basin is one of the most important river basins in Sri Lanka which receives very high rainfalls and has higher discharges. Due to its hydrological and topographical characteristics, the lower flood plain suffers from frequent floods and it affects socio-economic profile greatly. During the past several years, many researchers have investigated climatic changes of main river basins of the country, but no studies have been done on climatic changes in Kalu Ganga basin. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate precipitation trends in Kalu Ganga basin. Annual and monthly precipitation trends were detected with Mann-Kendall statistical test. Negative trends of annual precipitation were found in all the analyzed rainfall gauging stations. As an average, -0.98 trend with the annual rainfall reduction of 12.03 mm/year was found. April and August were observed to have strong decreasing trends. July and November displayed strong increasing trends. In conclusion, whole the Kalu Ganga basin has a decreasing trend of annual precipitation and it is clear that slight climatic changes may have affected the magnitude and timing of the precipitation within the study area  Introduction  Downstream view, in Ratnapura. Kalu Ganga basin is the second largest river basin in Sri Lanka covering 2766 km2 and much of the catchment is located in the highest rainfall area of the country, which reflects the high annual rainfall. The annual rainfall in the basin is averaged to 4000mm and leads to 4000 million m3 of annual flow.The Kalu Ganga originates from the central hills of wet zone at an altitude of 2250 m and garners rainfall on the western slopes and falls out to the sea at Kalutara after traversing about 129 km. The basin has steep gradients in upper part and mild gradients in lower part. Due to these hydrological and topographical characteristics of the river basin, its lower flood plain suffers from frequent floods during the Southwest monsoon season. Therefore, the damages to the socio-economic profile are significantly high since the lower flood plain of Kalu Ganga is densely populated and it is a potential area for rice production. During the past several years, attention has been paid to study on precipitation changes of main river basins of Sri Lanka. El Ni√±o-southern oscillation influences on stream flow in Kelani River. In studied 2005 hydrology and environmental flows in the Walawe River basin. However, we couldn‚Äôt find any academic literature regarding climatic changes in Kalu Ganga basin, which is one of the four main rivers in Sri Lanka. The major possible effects of climate change may include variability in water resources, increase desertification, loss of biodiversity and changes in agricultural productivity. One of the most significant consequences resulting from climate change may be the alteration of regional hydrological cycles and subsequent changes in stream flow regimes. Studies of general circulation model (GCM) reveals that increased global temperature could lead to increase the amount and intensity of regional precipitation. Precipitation is a good indication of the impacts from climate change on water resources. Changes in precipitation patterns are very important for water resources managers to deal with the water resources planning and management. Variations in precipitation over daily, seasonal, annual, and decadal timescales influencewater resource systems. In addition to the studies on short-term variability of precipitation, long-term detection of precipitation is essential for understanding the potential impacts on water resources resulting from climate change. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate long-term precipitation trends, which is one of the crucial parameters in climatic change, in Kalu Ganga basin.

Her first lover was Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, by whom she had an illegitimate son ‚Äì Edward. For that offence, both she and the earl were sent to the Tower of London by the orders of the Queen. She later became the mistress of Sir Henry Lee of Ditchley, by whom she had another illegitimate son. By 1590, she had married a sea captain by the name of John Finch. She later married John Richardson, while her first husband was still alive; and as a consequence, she was brought up before the High Commission on a charge of bigamy, for which she had to pay a fine of ¬£2000; however, she was spared having to perform a public penance. She was the inspiration, protagonist, and possibly the actual author, of the poem, Anne Vavasour's Echo, though her lover the Earl of Oxford is more commonly identified as its author. Family Anne was born circa 1560, the daughter of Henry Vavasour of Tadcaster, Copmanthorpe, Yorkshire, and Margaret Knyvet. Anne's maternal uncle was Sir Thomas Knyvet, 1st Baron Knyvet. It was this family connection which likely secured her a place at court as one of Queen Elizabeth's Ladies of the Bedchamber. Her younger sister, Frances (1568 ‚Äì c.1606), was also at court as a Maid of Honour to the Queen (1590‚Äì91), and who in 1591, secretly married Sir Thomas Shirley. Her younger brother, Thomas, also made a career at court and became embroiled in her scandals, at one point challenging the Earl of Oxford to a duel (which does not appear to have taken place).  Earl of Oxford's mistress  Shortly after her arrival at court, she became the mistress of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, who was married to Anne Cecil, the daughter of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, the Queen's most trusted advisor. Oxford had separated from his wife in 1576. On 23 March 1581, Anne gave birth to Oxford's illegitimate son, Edward, which resulted in their imprisonment in the Tower of London by the command of Queen Elizabeth. Oxford was released several months later, but was banished from court until June 1583. He had reconciled with his wife, Anne Cecil in January 1582. Their love affair also led to open skirmishes and duels in the streets of London, between Oxford and Anne's uncle, Thomas Knyvet, which on one occasion led to the wounding of both men, and the death of one of Oxford's men. Though her child, baptised Edward Vere, would survive to manhood, Oxford took no responsibility for his upbringing or education though did settle lands on him and gave ¬£2000 to Anne. The boy was raised by Anne. In later years her son became a prot√©g√© of Oxford's cousin, Sir Francis Vere.  Bigamy  Sometime before 1590, Anne married a sea captain by the name of John Finch. Around this time, she took another lover, Sir Henry Lee, Master of the Royal Armouries, by whom she had another illegitimate son, Thomas. They lived openly together at his manor of Ditchley. The Queen apparently approved of their liaison, as the couple entertained her at Ditchley House in September 1592. In 1605, Lee pensioned off Finch, and left Anne an income of ¬£700 per year in his will, some property, and instructions for their joint burial in the tomb he had had erected for them in Quarrendon, Buckinghamshire. He had written an epitaph for the tomb which described her as having been: \\"a fair and worthy Dame\\". They remained together until his death in 1611. Anne outlived Sir Henry, but was forced to engage in a series of legal battles with Sir Henry's son over the property he had left her. By 1618, she had married a second time to John Richardson. At this point John Finch reappeared and she was brought up before the High Commission on 8 August 1618 and charged with bigamy. On 1 February 1622, she was ordered to pay a fine of ¬£2000, however she was spared the ordeal of performing a public penance. She died in about 1650 at the advanced age of 90, and was buried at Quarrendon, near Aylesbury, in a chapel of which only a remnant of the outer wall now remains. Sir Henry's monument showed him lying down in armour with an effigy of Anne kneeling at his feet.  Poems  Two poems, Though I seem strange sweet friend and Anne Vavasour's Echo, appear in collections of the work of the Earl of Oxford, Edward de Vere, but have been attributed to Vavasour in some manuscripts. Anne Vavasour's Echo is written as if spoken by her as a series of questions. The last word of each line she says is echoed as the answer: e.g. \\"'who was the first that bred me to this fever?' echo: 'vere'\\".

The English initials of the film spells out I.C.A.C. Plot During the time Hong Kong was under British rule, there was a dark age when corruption and bribery were the order of the day. Chinese Chief Inspector Lak (Tony Leung Ka-fai) together with his gang, Unicorn (Anthony Wong), Gale (Eason Chan) and Gold (Wong Jing) laundered massive sums thereby making Hong Kong an empire of graft. Whenever they failed to apprehend the felons, Unicorn would get innocent victims, like Bong (Alex Fong), to admit to the crimes. Gale had nine \\"wives\\"; all of them were actually mistresses of other constables. Only Lily (Kate Tsui) was loyal to him, but Gale was fascinated by the female drug lord, Rose (Liu Yang). Lak was found having an affair with Unicorn's mistress (Natalie Meng Yao). Unicorn beat up Lak and was demoted to stand guard at a reservoir. In the early 1970s, the Governor of Hong Kong decided to clean up the police force. The ICAC was established, whose operation branch was headed by Yim (Bowie Lam). Bong and Unicorn also joined the ICAC. Despite threats of violence and intimidation, they managed to bring about the downfall of the empire of graft.

As one of six synagogues in Charlotte, it serves more than 650 member families. The rabbi since July 2020 is Michael Wolk, who took over from interim Rabbi Howard Seigel. Seigel succeeding the long serving rabbi of 24 years, Murray Ezring. The cantor since 2018 has been soprano Shira T Lissek, previously of Park Avenue Synagogue, New York. History With the great wave of immigration of Jews from Eastern Europe occurring in the late 19th century, new settlers came to Charlotte. This group also was deeply religious and brought with them their own customs and attitudes. In September 1895, these new citizens organized the first formal Jewish congregation of the city of Charlotte. This congregation was the forerunner of what is now Temple Israel. They called themselves Agudath Achim, Hebrew United Brotherhood. The group was headed by Harris Miller, Benjamin Silverstein, and Mr. C. Lubin. By 1915, now \\"Temple Israel\\" had constructed its first building and the number of families grew to more than 100. Two minyans existed at the Temple, one Orthodox and one Conservative. Eventually, the younger members persuaded the congregation to adopt a stance of worship leading more toward \\"Conservatism.\\" This gave way to mixed seating and more use of English in the service. In 1948 Temple Israel, together with Temple Beth-El, erected a monument to Judah P. Benjamin, \\"Attorney General, Secretary of War, and Secretary of State of the Confederate government... as a Gift to the North Carolina Division, United Daughters of the Confederacy\\". By 1949, Temple Israel had outgrown its building on Seventh Street and relocated to the Dilworth neighborhood of South Charlotte. By 1955, Temple Israel boasted the largest membership of any Jewish congregation in the Carolinas with more than 350 member families. In 1985, the synagogue adopted an egalitarian policy for worship, granting women full rights at services to read from the Torah, lead song, and lead prayer. In 1991, Temple Israel broke ground in Shalom Park of South Charlotte and began construction on its current building. Year 1992 marked the completion of the congregation's third new building, and in 1994 Rabbi Emeritus, Rabbi Murray Ezring became Temple Israel's 19th Senior Rabbi. Current Rabbi Michael Wolk joined temple Israel July 1, 2020 as its 20th Senior Rabbi In 2013, the congregation voted to withdraw its membership from the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, making it one of the largest congregations in the Southeastern United States to leave the umbrella organization, however, as of 2018, the congregation is once again a member of the denomination. Affiliates In serving the greater Charlotte metropolitan area, Congregation Emanuel (Statesville, North Carolina) is affiliated with Temple Israel. This congregation is without full- time clergy, so Temple Israel provides rabbinic leadership, monetary support, and resources to help support this congregation. Notable Clergy Cantor Frank Birnbaum served the congregation from 1977 until his retirement in 1990. Known for his famous song-writing and vocal ability, the Annual Cantor's Concert is named in his honor. The hyperlink used with the name Frank Birnbaum above does not reach the correct Cantor Birnbaum. The Frank Birnbaum who served Temple Israel of Charlotte, NC was not born in Charleston, SC but rather in Germany. I worked with him for many years and knew him well.

In the theory of community of practice, an interdisciplinary field between sociology of education and educational psychology, the notion of a duality is used to capture the idea of the tension between two opposing forces which become a driving force for change and creativity. Wenger uses the concept of dualities to examine the forces that create and sustain a community of practice. He describes a duality as \\"a single conceptual unit that is formed by two inseparable and mutually constitutive elements whose inherent tensions and complementarity give the concept richness and dynamism\\" . Some compare the concept of a duality to that of yin and yang, i.e. two mutually defining opposites. The opposing entities in a duality need to be viewed from a perspective of balance rather than opposition. The term implies a dynamism, continual change and mutual adjustment as the tensions that are inherent in dualities can be both creative and constraining. identifies four dualities that exist in communities of practice: participation‚Äìreification, designed‚Äìemergent, identification‚Äìnegotiability and local‚Äìglobal.  Participation and reification  The participation‚Äìreification duality is concerned with meaning. Meaning is created through participation and active involvement in some practice. Reification is a way of making an abstract and concise representation of what is often a complex and frequently messy practice, thus making it easier to share within the community. Because of its obvious links to knowledge management, the participation-reification duality has been the focus of particular interest in this field .  Designed and emergent  The designed‚Äìemergent duality focuses on time and captures the tension between pre-planned and emergent activities. Designers can plan an activity that is designed to achieve a particular purpose however, some activities emerge through interaction and participation of the community; these are unplanned and may be contrary to what the designers intended. These give participants the opportunity to (re)negotiate existing meaning. The designed‚Äìemergent duality is often mentioned in relation to the design of on- line learning environments e.g. .  Identification and negotiability  The identification‚Äìnegotiability duality is concerned with \\"how the power to define, adapt, or interpret the design is distributed\\" . Identification is the process through which individuals build their identities. This can include not only how individuals perceive themselves but also their right to contribute to and shape the direction of a community as a whole. Thus, this duality serves to combine both power and belonging in the shaping of the community.  Local and global  The local‚Äìglobal duality concerns how one CoP relates to another. The challenge is to share local knowledge that meets the needs of a particular domain in a way that will be of relevance to others who are not involved in it. Wenger uses the notion of a boundary object, brokerage and boundary encounters to explain how individuals can establish relationships and learn from other communities.

He is best known as Mayor of Bergen. He was born in V√•g√• as the son of teacher Thor Stensaker (1858‚Äì1943) and Anne Baarstad (1863‚Äì1888). He grew up in Fana, where his father was a teacher. He finished his secondary education in 1903, and spent one year at the Norwegian Military Academy before enrolling at the Royal Frederick University. He graduated with the cand.philol. degree in 1909, with the master's thesis Norges forsvar under Hannibal Sehesteds statholderskap.

Nasjonal Samling member Alf Johannesen took over. In August 1943 Stensaker was imprisoned for fourteen days at Hvalsmoen, but was released due to old age.

Olyalin chose to study in the Leningrad State Institute of Theater, Music and Cinematography instead. After graduating at 1964, he joined the Krasnoyarsk Children's Theater, where - in spite of having tense relations with the director - he was considered the best comical actor among the cast. There, he met his wife, Nella, who was the second secretary of the local Komsomol.An obituary in Trud.ru. Olyalin made his debut on screen depicting a test pilot in the 1965 film Days of Flight. Afterwards, he received many invitations to play in other motion pictures, but the Theater manager never told him of those and threw them away. When a letter from the Mosfilm studio reached Krasnoyarsk, offering Olyalin the main role in Yuri Ozerov's Liberation, one of the couriers told him of the matter. He claimed to be sick, took a leave and boarded a flight to Moscow.

In addition, the doctrines of Khufiyya are influenced by Confucianism, the Confucian approach or way of expounding Islamic sacred texts known as \\"Yiru Quanjing\\" (‰ª•ÂÑíË©ÆÁ∂ì).  History  The origin of Khufiyya can be traced to the Naqshbandis of Central Asia, a Sunni spiritual order of Sufism, which in turn has its roots in Sham. Their missions gave rise to the prosperity of Sufis in Bukhara and Samarkand. Makhdumi Azam, a 17th-century Naqshbandi leader, settled in Kashgar where his offspring promoted and cemented his teachings. Descendants of Azam were known as Miskiya and Ishaqis. Khufiyya in China was pioneered by a Ming dynasty mufti from Lintao named Ma Shouzhen (È¶¨ÂÆàË≤û). He was born in 1633, during the reign of the Chongzhen Emperor. In his youth, he was mentored by the Miskiya missionary Afaq Khoja, who visited Hezhou in 1672and greatly contributed to the dissemination of Sufism in China. At the age of 40, Shouzhen began his preaching. After 50 years, the order had grown into a sizable religious community. Ma Laichi can be seen as another founding member of the Khufiyya order. Under the guidance of Ma Taibaba, a contemporary of Ma Shouzhen, Ma Laichi was introduced into Sufism. After pilgrimage to Mecca, he returned to China and preached for 32 years in Qinghai and Gansu Province. He later established the Huasi Menhuan, which remains an important menhuan or denomination, of Chinese Sufism. In the early 18th century, Xian Meizhen, another pupil of Afaq Khoja, preached in the inner provinces of China. The Xianmen Menhuan denomination was founded by Meizhen. Gradually, over years of religious practice and conversion, different denominations of Khufiyya formed Jiaofang (ÊïôÂùä)‚Äìunits of residence where followers of a menhuan reside. Just like those of Jahriyya, Khufiyyan Jiaofang were organized administrative divisions led by an Akhoond. Throughout the reign of the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, the \\"old\\" orders of Chinese Sufism represented by Khufiyya encountered a wave of reformists led by Ma Mingxin, the founder of Jahriyya which was known as the \\"New order\\". Ma Mingxing opposed and criticized Khufiyyan menhuan's hereditary lineage and attracted followers from Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. In the later conflicts between Khufiyya and Jahriyya over both religious and political affairs, the Qing government supported Khufiyya and saw Jahriyya as a threat to its rule. During the Cultural Revolution, Khufiyya was among the many religious organizations that suffered persecutions and pressures. Many mosques were demolished during this time, religious practice was forbidden. The state-imposed ban on religion was lifted after 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In contemporary China, followers of Khufiyya live mainly in Linxia, Tianshui and Lanzhou of Gansu province.  Philosophy  Like other Sufi orders, Khufiyya is characterized by the veneration of saints, the search for enlightenment, and dhikr (quiet repetition of devotional phrases or prayers). The dhikr of Khufiyya followers are in a low tone or even silent, which references the meaning of the \\"Khufiyya\\", which means \\"the silent ones\\" in Arabic. In addition, Khufiyya was relatively conformist to the central government of China throughout different periods of history. The Khufiyya order rejects excessive practice of the abstinence from worldly desires. It advocates for a way of spiritual life which balances between one's secular affairs and spiritual endeavors. Disciples of the Khufiyya order are required to complete the reading of the Quran and Hadiths. Notably, the sufi Tariqa of reciting silent dhikr is a necessity. A teacher of Khufiyya disciples is known as Murshid.  Demography  , out of 6,781,500 Hui Chinese, 7.2% identify as Khufiyya followers. In Ningxia, there were 560 mosques affiliated with Khufiyya. Adherents of Khufiyya can be found in most of the northwestern provinces of China, with settlements in the inner provinces of Yunnan, Sichuan, Henan, Jilin and Hebei.  Menhuan  There are more than 20 menhuan (denominations). The following list shows some of the major menhuans of the Khufiyya brotherhood: *Huasi Menhuan *Lintao Menhuan *Beizhuang Menhuan, Basuchi Menhuan, and Jinggou Menhuan *Mingyuetang *Humen Menhuan *Xianmen Menhuan *Hongmen Menhuan *Wenquantang and Tonggui Menhuan *Gaozhaojia Menhuan *Salar *Famen Menhuan *Dingmen Menhuan  References  Islam in China Naqshbandi order ","title":"Khufiyya"},{"id":"25143061","text":"The hall seen shortly after its construction in the 1860s. Endcliffe Hall is a 19th-century, 36-room mansion situated on Endcliffe Vale Road in the City of Sheffield in the suburb of Endcliffe. The hall is situated just over three km west of the city centre and is a Grade II* Listed building. The present hall was built between the years of 1863 and 1865 by the Sheffield architects Flockton & Abbot for the Sheffield industrialist John Brown. Brown had acquired considerable wealth and prestige from the manufacture of armour plate from Bessemer steel at his Atlas Works in the city and wanted to build a private residence to reflect his position as one of the Nouveau riche industrialist of the Victorian Age. It is the largest private residence ever to have been built in Sheffield. History The Endcliffe estate can be traced back to 1333 when John de Elcliffe was awarded a financial grant, at that time the estate extended considerably and took in land between the Porter and Sheaf valleys. It is believed that the first Endcliffe Hall was built in the reign of George II (1727 - 1760) although Sheffield historian J. Edward Vickers says there may have been an earlier building on the site. The hall was owned from 1818 by the merchant William Hodgson and included of land and cost ¬£6,700. The hall later passed to Henry Wilkinson, a Sheffield silversmith before being bought by John Brown in August 1860. Brown had previously lived at the large seven bedroomed house of Shirle Hill in Cherry Tree Road, Nether Edge. However Brown was looking for a more impressive structure to entertain his visitors and wanted a building that was ‚Äú‚Ä¶. specially adapted for dispensing hospitalities on a scale worthy of such distinguished visitors‚Äù. Brown‚Äôs first action on acquiring the building was to pull the old hall down and replace it with the current building which cost ¬£100,000 to build with a further ¬£60,000 spent on the furnishings. Brown was determined to use Sheffield craftsmen during the work on the hall and in addition to the architects Flockton & Abbot he employed local firms such as John Jebson Smith (staircases), Longden & Co. (kitchen stoves), Messrs Craven (ornamental plasterwork), William Gibson (carpentry), Mr Pitt (plumbing and glazing) and John and Joseph Rogers (decorating).\\"A Popular History Of Sheffield\\", J. Edward Vickers, , Pages 90-91 Gives historical details. Such was the rarity of such a fine building being erected in Sheffield at that time, that when the hall was finished it was opened to the public for three days attracting huge crowds and much praise with the Sheffield Telegraph calling it, ‚Äúthe public advantage of personal munificence‚Äù in its edition of 24 May 1865. After the death of his wife in 1881, Brown gradually withdrew from public life, his health deteriorated and he spent increasing amounts of time in southern England. John Brown left Endcliffe Hall for the last time in 1892 and sold Endcliffe Hall for ¬£26,000 in 1895 (a year before his death) to Barber Brothers and Wortley for building development. The development never took place and various plans were proposed for the future of the hall. In 1913 the hall was in danger of demolition, then Colonel George Ernest Branson of the 4th Hallamshire Battalion suggested that the hall could replace the Hyde Park Barracks as the headquarters of the Battalion. The plan was endorsed by the War Office in January 1914 and the house was sold to the Reserve Forces and Cadets Association for use by the Territorial Army and became the Hallamshire's headquarters. Before the Battalion moved in, a number of alterations were needed these included converting the stables and coach house into a drill hall.\\"From Bailey To Bailey: A Short History Of Military Buildings In Sheffield\\", Stephen Johnson, , Pages 44 & 45, Gives military history of Hall. Endcliffe Hall remained the HQ of the Hallamshires until 1968 when the battalion was disbanded. Today the hall and grounds are still owned by the RFCA and is the Regimental Headquarters of Army Reserve unit 212 (Yorkshire) Field Hospital. Access to the grounds is limited for the general public as the military are on a constant terrorist security alert.\\"Old Sheffield Town\\", J.

She was voiced by Kaori Mizuhashi. Appearances Navi first appears in The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. She is instructed by the Great Deku Tree in Kokiri Forest to assist Link in his quest to stop Ganondorf. All Kokiri have companion fairies, but because Link is actually a Hylian, he never received one until Navi joins him near the beginning of the events of the game. In gameplay terms, Navi functions primarily as a guide that points out clues in the environment and helps the player learn the controls and advance in the game. Most of her hints are about how to progress in the story or defeat enemies. She can also be used to lock on enemies in the game, items and other characters. She is one of the few characters with any voice-acting in the series, and the only character from before The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild who (aside from Beedle) actually uses English words, such as \\"Hey\\", \\"Look\\", \\"Listen\\", \\"Watch out\\" and \\"Hello\\". While Navi does not appear in The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Link is implied to be searching for her as the game begins, having separated from her following the events of Ocarina of Time. Navi also appears in the spin-off title Hyrule Warriors. Having been pulled through the Gate of Souls from her own time period, she aids Impa and Sheik in their quest to stop Cia's army. This game's version of Link also gets a fairy named Proxi who acts very similar to Navi and says the same quotes as her. Reception The character drew a strongly negative response from many players, with Cracked editor Tim Lovett ranking Navi the eight on his list of \\"Most annoying video game characters (from otherwise great games)\\", describing her as \\"a naggy, clingy spouse\\". GamesRadar editor Mikel Reparaz ranked Navi as the most irritating female character, stating that she would have been bearable if she did not interrupt the game with \\"Hey!\\" and \\"Listen!\\" constantly. Fellow GamesRadar editor Tom Goulter listed her as the second most annoying sidekick ever, while in another article, GamesRadar ranked Navi second place in the list of \\"cutesy characters [they] want to beat the crap out of\\", citing similar reasons but describing her as a \\"tactless Tinkerbell\\". The web site also listed her \\"Hey! Listen!\\" quote as one of the 40 most repeated game quotes. GameDaily listed her as one of the characters they wanted to kill, but could not, describing her as irritating. In the book Game Writing: Narrative Skills for Videogames, author Chris Bateman described Navi as the \\"most famous, and most famously annoying, instance of an explicit funneling companion.\\" In the book The Legend of Zelda and Philosophy, author Luke Cuddy describes Navi as the \\"most insipid\\" character next to the character Tingle, she is seen by the in-game characters as a necessary stage in a Kokiri's life. In the character's defense, Brendan Main writing for The Escapist argues that while Navi is undeniably annoying, she is also indispensable in the game and extremely useful, citing her role in the Z-targeting system and her role as a gameplay prompt through physically changing colours near secrets and danger. He even goes as far as claiming, \\"I think Navi is the greatest partner ever to grace a videogame.\\" IGN's Chris Reed also stressed on her utility and listed her as one of the \\"best video game wingmen ever\\", commenting that \\"She does everything a good sidekick should do: She tells you how to work the game's controls, reminds you what to do next when you forget, and gives you hints when you get stuck.\\" Notes References Female characters in video games Fictional fairies and sprites Nintendo protagonists The Legend of Zelda characters Video game characters introduced in 1998 Video game sidekicks ","title":"Navi (The Legend of Zelda)"},{"id":"25143141","text":"Giarre-Riposto was a comune (municipality) which existed in Sicily from 1935 to 1945.

It includes a large class library called Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability (each language can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called \\"managed code\\". FCL and CLR together constitute the .NET Framework. FCL provides the user interface, data access, database connectivity, cryptography, web application development, numeric algorithms, and network communications. Programmers produce software by combining their source code with .NET Framework and other libraries. The framework is intended to be used by most new applications created for the Windows platform. Microsoft also produces an integrated development environment for .NET software called Visual Studio. .NET Framework began as proprietary software, although the firm worked to standardize the software stack almost immediately, even before its first release. Despite the standardization efforts, developers, mainly those in the free and open-source software communities, expressed their unease with the selected terms and the prospects of any free and open-source implementation, especially regarding software patents. Since then, Microsoft has changed .NET development to more closely follow a contemporary model of a community- developed software project, including issuing an update to its patent promising to address the concerns. .NET Framework led to a family of .NET platforms targeting mobile computing, embedded devices, alternative operating systems, and web browser plug-ins. A reduced version of the framework, .NET Compact Framework, is available on Windows CE platforms, including Windows Mobile devices such as smartphones. .NET Micro Framework is targeted at very resource-constrained embedded devices. Silverlight was available as a web browser plugin. Mono is available for many operating systems and is customized into popular smartphone operating systems (Android and iOS) and game engines. .NET Core targets the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), and cross-platform and cloud computing workloads. History Microsoft began developing .NET Framework in the late 1990s, originally under the name of Next Generation Windows Services (NGWS), as part of the .NET strategy. By late 2000, the first beta versions of .NET 1.0 were released. In August 2000, Microsoft, and Intel worked to standardize Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) and C#. By December 2001, both were ratified Ecma International (ECMA) standards. International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) followed in April 2003. The current version of ISO standards are ISO/IEC 23271:2012 and ISO/IEC 23270:2006. While Microsoft and their partners hold patents for CLI and C#, ECMA and ISO require that all patents essential to implementation be made available under \\"reasonable and non-discriminatory terms\\". The firms agreed to meet these terms, and to make the patents available royalty-free. However, this did not apply for the part of .NET Framework not covered by ECMA-ISO standards, which included Windows Forms, ADO.NET, and ASP.NET. Patents that Microsoft holds in these areas may have deterred non-Microsoft implementations of the full framework. On October 3, 2007, Microsoft announced that the source code for .NET Framework 3.5 libraries was to become available under the Microsoft Reference Source License (Ms-RSL). The source code repository became available online on January 16, 2008 and included BCL, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, Windows Forms, WPF, and XML. Scott Guthrie of Microsoft promised that LINQ, WCF, and WF libraries were being added. Microsoft .NET Framework v4.5 logo On November 12, 2014, Microsoft announced .NET Core, in an effort to include cross-platform support for .NET, the source release of Microsoft's CoreCLR implementation, source for the \\"entire [‚Ä¶] library stack\\" for .NET Core, and the adoption of a conventional (\\"bazaar\\"-like) open-source development model under the consolation stewardship of the .NET Foundation. Miguel de Icaza describes .NET Core as a \\"redesigned version of .NET that is based on the simplified version of the class libraries\\", and Microsoft's Immo Landwerth explained that .NET Core would be \\"the foundation of all future .NET platforms\\". At the time of the announcement, the initial release of the .NET Core project had been seeded with a subset of the libraries' source code and coincided with the relicensing of Microsoft's existing .NET reference source away from the restrictions of the Ms-RSL. Landwerth acknowledged the disadvantages of the formerly selected shared license, explaining that it made codename Rotor \\"a non-starter\\" as a community-developed open source project because it did not meet the criteria of an Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved license. In November 2014, Microsoft also produced an update to its patent grants, which further extends the scope beyond its prior pledges. Prior projects like Mono existed in a legal grey area because Microsoft's earlier grants applied only to the technology in \\"covered specifications\\", including strictly the 4th editions each of ECMA-334 and ECMA-335. The new patent promise, however, places no ceiling on the specification version, and even extends to any .NET runtime technologies documented on MSDN that have not been formally specified by the ECMA group, if a project chooses to implement them. This allows Mono and other projects to maintain feature parity with modern .NET features that have been introduced since the 4th edition was published without being at risk of patent litigation over the implementation of those features. The new grant does maintain the restriction that any implementation must maintain minimum compliance with the mandatory parts of the CLI specification. On March 31, 2016, Microsoft announced at Microsoft Build that they will completely relicense Mono under an MIT License even in scenarios where formerly a commercial license was needed. Microsoft also supplemented its prior patent promise for Mono, stating that they will not assert any \\"applicable patents\\" against parties that are \\"using, selling, offering for sale, importing, or distributing Mono.\\" It was announced that the Mono Project was contributed to the .NET Foundation. These developments followed the acquisition of Xamarin, which began in February 2016 and was finished on March 18, 2016. Microsoft's press release highlights that the cross-platform commitment now allows for a fully open-source, modern server-side .NET stack. Microsoft released the source code for WPF, Windows Forms and WinUI on December 4, 2018. On May 8, 2019, Microsoft announced .NET 5.0, will be released in November 2020, which will be based on .NET Core. Release history Architecture Visual overview of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) Common Language Infrastructure Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) provides a language- neutral platform for application development and execution. By implementing the core aspects of .NET Framework within the scope of CLI, these functions will not be tied to one language but will be available across the many languages supported by the framework. Common Language Runtime .NET Framework includes the Common Language Runtime (CLR). It serves as the execution engine of .NET Framework and offers many services such as memory management, type safety, exception handling, garbage collection, security and thread management. All programs written for .NET Framework are executed by the CLR. Programs written for .NET Framework are compiled into Common Intermediate Language code (CIL), as opposed to being directly compiled into machine code. During execution, an architecture-specific just-in-time compiler (JIT) turns the CIL code into machine code. With Microsoft's move to .NET Core, the CLI Virtual Execution System (VES) implementation is known as CoreCLR instead of CLR. Assemblies Compiled CIL code is stored in CLI assemblies. As mandated by the specification, assemblies are stored in Portable Executable (PE) file format, common on Windows platform for all dynamic-link library (DLL) and executable EXE files. Each assembly consists of one or more files, one of which must contain a manifest bearing the metadata for the assembly. The complete name of an assembly (not to be confused with the file name on disk) contains its simple text name, version number, culture, and public key token. Assemblies are considered equivalent if they share the same complete name. A private key can also be used by the creator of the assembly for strong naming. The public key token identifies which private key an assembly is signed with. Only the creator of the key pair (typically the person signing the assembly) can sign assemblies that have the same strong name as a prior version assembly, since the creator possesses the private key. Strong naming is required to add assemblies to Global Assembly Cache. Starting with Visual Studio 2015, .NET Native compilation technology allows for the compilation of .NET code of Universal Windows Platform apps directly to machine code rather than CIL code, but the app must be written in either C# or Visual Basic.NET. Class library .NET Framework includes an implementation of the CLI foundational Standard Libraries. The .NET Framework Class Library (FCL) is organized in a hierarchy of namespaces. Most of the built-in application programming interfaces (APIs) are part of either \`System.*\` or \`Microsoft.*\` namespaces. These class libraries implement many common functions, such as file reading and writing, graphic rendering, database interaction, and XML document manipulation. The class libraries are available for all CLI compliant languages. The FCL implements the CLI Base Class Library (BCL) and other class libraries‚Äîsome are specified by CLI and other are Microsoft specific. BCL includes a small subset of the entire class library and is the core set of classes that serve as the basic API of CLR. For .NET Framework most classes considered being part of BCL reside in \`mscorlib.dll\`, \`System.dll\` and \`System.Core.dll\`. BCL classes are available in .NET Framework as well as its alternative implementations including .NET Compact Framework, Microsoft Silverlight, .NET Core and Mono. FCL refers to the entire class library that ships with .NET Framework. It includes an expanded set of libraries, including BCL, Windows Forms, ASP.NET, and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) but also extensions to the base class libraries ADO.NET, Language Integrated Query (LINQ), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and Workflow Foundation (WF). FCL is much larger in scope than standard libraries for languages like C++, and comparable in scope to standard libraries of Java. With the introduction of alternative implementations (e.g., Silverlight), Microsoft introduced the concept of Portable Class Libraries (PCL) allowing a consuming library to run on more than one platform. With the further proliferation of .NET platforms, the PCL approach failed to scale (PCLs are defined intersections of API surface between two or more platforms). As the next evolutionary step of PCL, the .NET Standard Library was created retroactively based on the \`System.Runtime.dll\` based APIs found in UWP and Silverlight. New .NET platforms are encouraged to implement a version of the standard library allowing them to re-use extant third-party libraries to run without new versions of them. The .NET Standard Library allows an independent evolution of the library and app model layers within the .NET architecture. NuGet is the package manager for all .NET platforms. It is used to retrieve third-party libraries into a .NET project with a global library feed at NuGet.org. Private feeds can be maintained separately, e.g., by a build server or a file system directory. With Microsoft's move to .NET Core, the CLI foundational class libraries implementation is known as CoreFX instead of FCL. App models Atop the class libraries, multiple app models are used to create apps. .NET Framework supports Console, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core apps by default. Other app models are offered by alternative implementations of the .NET Framework. Console, UWP and ASP.NET Core are available on .NET Core. Mono is used to power Xamarin in app models for Android, iOS, and macOS. The retroactive architectural definition of app models showed up in early 2015 and was also applied to prior technologies like Windows Forms or WPF. C++/CLI Microsoft introduced C++/CLI in Visual Studio 2005, which is a language and means of compiling Visual C++ programs to run within the .NET Framework. Some parts of the C++ program still run within an unmanaged Visual C++ Runtime, while specially modified parts are translated into CIL code and run with the .NET Framework's CLR. Assemblies compiled using the C++/CLI compiler are termed mixed-mode assemblies, since they contain native and managed code in the same DLL.Mixed (Native and Managed) Assemblies, MSDN Such assemblies are more complex to reverse engineer, since .NET decompilers such as .NET Reflector reveal only the managed code. Design principle Interoperability Because computer systems commonly require interaction between newer and older applications, .NET Framework provides means to access functions implemented in newer and older programs that execute outside .NET environment. Access to Component Object Model (COM) components is provided in \`System.Runtime.InteropServices\` and \`System.EnterpriseServices\` namespaces of the framework. Access to other functions is via Platform Invocation Services (P/Invoke). Access to .NET functions from native applications is via reverse P/Invoke function. Language independence .NET Framework introduces a Common Type System (CTS) that defines all possible data types and programming constructs supported by CLR and how they may or may not interact conforming to CLI specification. Because of this feature, .NET Framework supports the exchange of types and object instances between libraries and applications written using any conforming .NET language. Type safety CTS and the CLR used in .NET Framework also enforce type safety. This prevents ill-defined casts, wrong method invocations, and memory size issues when accessing an object. This also makes most CLI languages statically typed (with or without type inference). However, starting with .NET Framework 4.0, the Dynamic Language Runtime extended the CLR, allowing dynamically typed languages to be implemented atop the CLI. Portability While Microsoft has never implemented the full framework on any system except Microsoft Windows, it has engineered the framework to be cross-platform, and implementations are available for other operating systems (see Silverlight and ¬ß Alternative implementations). Microsoft submitted the specifications for CLI (which includes the core class libraries, CTS, and CIL), C#, and C++/CLI to both Ecma International (ECMA) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO), making them available as official standards. This makes it possible for third parties to create compatible implementations of the framework and its languages on other platforms. Security .NET Framework has its own security mechanism with two general features: Code Access Security (CAS), and validation and verification. CAS is based on evidence that is associated with a specific assembly. Typically the evidence is the source of the assembly (whether it is installed on the local machine or has been downloaded from the Internet). CAS uses evidence to determine the permissions granted to the code. Other code can demand that calling code be granted a specified permission. The demand causes CLR to perform a call stack walk: every assembly of each method in the call stack is checked for the required permission; if any assembly is not granted the permission a security exception is thrown. Managed CIL bytecode is easier to reverse-engineer than native code, unless obfuscated.Gartner, Inc. as reported in \\"Hype Cycle for Cyberthreats, 2006\\", September 2006, Neil MacDonald; Amrit Williams, et al. decompiler programs enable developers with no reverse-engineering skills to view the source code behind unobfuscated .NET assemblies. In contrast, apps compiled to native machine code are much harder to reverse-engineer, and source code is almost never produced successfully, mainly because of compiler optimizations and lack of reflection. This creates concerns in the business community over the possible loss of trade secrets and the bypassing of license control mechanisms. To mitigate this, Microsoft has included Dotfuscator Community Edition with Visual Studio .NET since 2002. Third-party obfuscation tools are also available from vendors such as VMware, V.i. Labs, Turbo, and Red Gate Software. Method-level encryption tools for .NET code are available from vendors such as SafeNet. Memory management CLR frees the developer from the burden of managing memory (allocating and freeing up when done); it handles memory management itself by detecting when memory can be safely freed. Instantiations of .NET types (objects) are allocated from the managed heap; a pool of memory managed by CLR. As long as a reference to an object exists, which may be either direct, or via a graph of objects, the object is considered to be in use. When no reference to an object exists, and it cannot be reached or used, it becomes garbage, eligible for collection. .NET Framework includes a garbage collector (GC) which runs periodically, on a separate thread from the application's thread, that enumerates all the unusable objects and reclaims the memory allocated to them. It is a non- deterministic, compacting, mark-and-sweep garbage collector. GC runs only when a set amount of memory has been used or there is enough pressure for memory on the system. Since it is not guaranteed when the conditions to reclaim memory are reached, GC runs are non-deterministic. Each .NET application has a set of roots, which are pointers to objects on the managed heap (managed objects). These include references to static objects, objects defined as local variables or method parameters currently in scope, and objects referred to by CPU registers. When GC runs, it pauses the application and then, for each object referred to in the root, it recursively enumerates all the objects reachable from the root objects and marks them as reachable. It uses CLI metadata and reflection to discover the objects encapsulated by an object, and then recursively walk them. It then enumerates all the objects on the heap (which were initially allocated contiguously) using reflection. All objects not marked as reachable are garbage. This is the mark phase. Since the memory held by garbage is of no consequence, it is considered free space. However, this leaves chunks of free space between objects which were initially contiguous. The objects are then compacted together to make free space on the managed heap contiguous again. Any reference to an object invalidated by moving the object is updated by GC to reflect the new location. The application is resumed after garbage collection ends. The latest version of .NET framework uses concurrent garbage collection along with user code, making pauses unnoticeable, because it is done in the background. The garbage collector used by .NET Framework is also generational. Objects are assigned a generation. Newly created objects are tagged Generation 0. Objects that survive one garbage collection are tagged Generation 1. Generation 1 objects that survive another collection are Generation 2. The framework uses up to Generation 2 objects. Higher generation objects are garbage collected less often than lower generation objects. This raises the efficiency of garbage collection, as older objects tend to have longer lifetimes than newer objects. By ignoring older objects in most collection runs, fewer checks and compaction operations are needed in total. Performance When an application is first launched, the .NET Framework compiles the CIL code into executable code using its just-in-time compiler, and caches the executable program into the .NET Native Image Cache.Compiling MSIL to Native Code, MSDN, Microsoft Due to caching, the application launches faster for subsequent launches, although the first launch is usually slower. To speed up the first launch, developers may use the Native Image Generator utility to manually ahead-of-time compile and cache any .NET application. The garbage collector, which is integrated into the environment, can introduce unanticipated delays of execution over which the developer has little direct control. \\"In large applications, the number of objects that the garbage collector needs to work with can become very large, which means it can take a very long time to visit and rearrange all of them.\\" .NET Framework provides support for calling Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) via managed code from April 2014 in Visual Studio 2013 Update 2. However, Mono has provided support for SIMD Extensions as of version 2.2 within the namespace in 2009. Mono's lead developer Miguel de Icaza has expressed hope that this SIMD support will be adopted by CLR's ECMA standard. Streaming SIMD Extensions have been available in x86 CPUs since the introduction of the Pentium III. Some other architectures such as ARM and MIPS also have SIMD extensions. In case the CPU lacks support for those extensions, the instructions are simulated in software. Alternative implementations .NET Framework is the predominant implementation of .NET technologies. Other implementations for parts of the framework exist. Although the runtime engine is described by an ECMA-ISO specification, other implementations of it may be encumbered by patent issues; ISO standards may include the disclaimer, \\"Attention is drawn to the possibility that some of the elements of this document may be the subject of patent rights. ISO shall not be held responsible for identifying any or all such patent rights.\\"ISO 9001:2008, Foreword It is harder to develop alternatives to FCL, which is not described by an open standard and may be subject to copyright restrictions. Also, parts of FCL have Windows-specific functions and behavior, so implementation on non-Windows platforms can be problematic. Some alternative implementations of parts of the framework are listed here. * .NET Core is an alternative Microsoft implementation of the managed code framework; it has similarities with .NET Framework and even shares some API, but is designed based on different sets of principles: It is cross-platform and free and open-source. Starting in 2020, it will become the primary implementation. * .NET Micro Framework is a .NET platform for extremely resource-constrained devices. It includes a small version of CLR and supports development in C# (though some developers were able to use VB.NET, albeit with an amount of hacking, and with limited functionalities) and debugging (in an emulator or on hardware), both using Microsoft Visual Studio. It also features a subset of .NET Framework Class Library (about 70 classes with about 420 methods), a GUI framework loosely based on WPF, and additional libraries specific to embedded applications. * Mono is an implementation of CLI and FCL, and provides added functions. It is dual-licensed as free and proprietary software. It includes support for ASP.NET, ADO.NET, and Windows Forms libraries for a wide range of architectures and operating systems. It also includes C# and VB.NET compilers. * Portable.NET (part of DotGNU) provides an implementation of CLI, parts of FCL, and a C# compiler. It supports a variety of CPUs and operating systems. The project was discontinued, with the last stable release in 2009. * Microsoft Shared Source Common Language Infrastructure is a non-free implementation of CLR. However, the last version runs on Windows XP SP2 only, and has not been updated since 2006. Thus, it does not contain all features of version 2.0 of .NET Framework. * CrossNet is an implementation of CLI and parts of FCL. It is free software using an open source MIT License.

He was known for his pioneering work in research, cataloguing and translations of Jain Agamas and ancient texts. He was responsible for discovering and publishing many ancient Jains texts lying in different forgotten Jain jnana bhandaras (ancient Jain libraries). He was a disciple of Muni Punyavijay. Both Muni Punyavijay and Jambuvijay worked all their life in the compilation and publication of ancient Jain Agama literature and cataloguing ancient Jain jnana bhandaras. Muni Jambuvijay was a scholar who devoted his entire life to critically editing Jain scriptures. Early life and family Jambuvijaya was born as Chunilal Bhogilal Joitram in 1923 in town of Mandal, Gujarat. His father's name was Bhogilal Mohanlal Joitram (1895‚Äì1959) and his mother's name was Aniben Popatlal (1894‚Äì1995). He was born in a deeply religious family. His father took vow of lifelong celibacy in 1925 and was initiated as a Jain monk Muni Bhuvanvijaya in 1932. His mother took initiation as Sadhavi Manoharashriji in 1939 under her own sister Sadhavi Labhashriji. All of Jambuvijayaji's aunts were initiated as sadhavi's and there were a number of initiations in his mother's family. p. 105 Monkhood In Ratlam in 1937, at the age of 14 he took initiation as a Jain monk under his father, Acarya Bhuvanvijaya, who became his teacher. Later on he studied under Acarya Punyavijaya and assisted him cataloguing various Jain manuscripts. After the death of Muni Punyavijaya, he became the chief editor of the Jain Agama series.Wiley, Kristi (2006) p. 105 Muni Jambuvijayji was a polyglot and knew 16 languages.

As emergency contraception it should be used within 120 hours of sex. For fibroids it may be taken for up to six months. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include headache, nausea, feeling tired, and abdominal pain. It should not be used in people who are already pregnant. It is in the selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) class of medications. It works by preventing the effects of progesterone thus stopping ovulation. Ulipristal acetate was approved for medical use in the United States in 2010. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. To improve access, some recommend all who can get pregnant be given a prescription for use if needed. Medical uses Emergency contraception For emergency contraception a 30 mg tablet is used within 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure. It has been shown to prevent about 62‚Äì85% of expected pregnancies, and prevents more pregnancies than emergency contraception with levonorgestrel. Ulipristal acetate is available by prescription for emergency contraception in over 50 countries, with access through pharmacists without a prescription being tested in the United Kingdom. In November 2014, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended availability of ellaOne emergency contraceptive without prescription in the European Union. In January 2015 the European Commission issued an implementing decision amending accordingly the marketing authorization of EllaOne in the EU. Since July 2016, it is available without prescription in Israel. Uterine fibroids Ulipristal acetate is used for pre-operative treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age. The use of ulipristal acetate to treat fibroids was suspended in the European Union in March 2020. Treatment of uterine fibroids with ulipristal acetate for 13 weeks effectively controlled excessive bleeding due to uterine fibroids and reduced the size of the fibroids. Two intermittent 3-months treatment courses of ulipristal acetate 10 mg resulted in amenorrhea at the end of the first treatment course in 79.5%, at the end of the second course in 88.5% of subjects. Mean myoma volume reduction observed during the first treatment course (‚àí41.9%) was maintained during the second one (‚àí43.7%). After two to four 3-months courses of treatment, UPA-treated fibroids shown about -70% in volume reduction. Volume reduction of uterine fibroid induced by ulipristal acetate was tentatively explained by the combination of multifactorial events involving control of proliferation of the tumor cells, induction of apoptosis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix under the action of matrix metalloproteinases. In May 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended measures to minimise the risk of rare but serious liver injury with ulipristal, including contraindication in women with known liver problems; liver tests before, during and after stopping treatment; a card for people to inform them about the need for liver monitoring and to contact their doctor should they develop symptoms of liver injury. In addition, use of the medicine for more than one treatment course has been restricted to women who are not eligible for surgery. Contraindications Ulipristal acetate should not be taken by women with severe liver diseases because of its CYP mediated metabolism. It has not been studied in women under the age of 18. It is also not recommended for women with severe asthma receiving glucocorticoid treatment because it has shown antiglucocorticoid effects in animal studies. Pregnancy Unlike levonorgestrel, and like mifepristone, ulipristal acetate is embryotoxic in animal studies. Before taking the drug, a pregnancy must be excluded. The EMA proposed to avoid any allusion to a possible use as an abortifacient in the package insert to avert off-label use. It is unlikely that ulipristal acetate could effectively be used as an abortifacient, since it is used in much lower doses (30 mg) than the roughly equipotent mifepristone (600 mg), and since mifepristone has to be combined with a prostaglandin for the induction of abortion. However, data on embryotoxicity in humans are very limited, and it is not clear what the risk for an abortion or for teratogenicity (birth defects) is. Of the 29 women studied who became pregnant despite taking ulipristal acetate, 16 had induced abortions, six had spontaneous abortions, six continued the pregnancies, and one was lost to follow-up. Lactation It is not recommended to breast feed within seven days of taking the drug since ulipristal acetate is are excreted into the breast milk, and possible effects on the infant have not been studied. Side effects The most common side effects include headache, nausea (feeling sick), abdominal pain (stomach ache), and dysmenorrhea (period pains). Interactions Ulipristal acetate is metabolized by CYP3A4 in vitro. Ulipristal acetate is likely to interact with substrates of CYP3A4, like rifampicin, phenytoin, St John's wort, carbamazepine or ritonavir, therefore concomitant use with these agents is not recommended. It might also interact with hormonal contraceptives and progestogens such as levonorgestrel and other substrates of the progesterone receptor, as well as with glucocorticoids. Pharmacology Pharmacodynamics As an SPRM, ulipristal acetate has partial agonistic as well as antagonistic effects on the progesterone receptor. Ulipristal acetate exhibits similar potency to antagonize progesterone receptor as mifepristone in vitro. It also binds to the androgen receptor and the glucocorticoid receptor, but is only a weak antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid relative to flutamide and mifepristone, respectively. Ulipristal acetate has no relevant affinity to the estrogen and mineralocorticoid receptors. Phase II clinical trials suggest that the mechanism might consist of blocking or delaying ovulation and of delaying the maturation of the endometrium. Pharmacokinetics In animal studies, the drug was quickly and nearly completely absorbed from the gut. Intake of food delays absorption, but it is not known whether this is clinically relevant. Ulipristal acetate is metabolized in the liver, most likely by CYP3A4, and to a small extent by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. The two main metabolites have been shown to be pharmacologically active, but less than the original drug. The main excretion route is via the feces. History Ulipristal acetate was granted marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in May 2009. In 2014, the EMA recommended ulipristal be made available without a prescription in the European Union. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug for use in the United States on 13 August 2010, following the FDA advisory committee's recommendation. Watson Pharmaceuticals announced the availability of ulipristal acetate in the United States on 1 December 2010, in retail pharmacies, clinics, and one on-line pharmacy, KwikMed. Society and culture Brand names Ulipristal acetate is marketed in the United States under the brand name Ella and in Canada under the brand name Fibristal. It is also marketed under the brand names EllaOne and Esmya in many countries including the United Kingdom and Ireland. A few less-widely used brand names also exist.

He was nicknamed \\"poet of light\\".  Life  Sculpture without title by Ingo Maurer in Groningen, Netherlands Lighting fixture \\"My New Flame\\" by Moritz Waldemeyer for Ingo Maurer Maurer was born in Reichenau Island, Lake Constance, Germany, and was the son of a fisherman and grew up there with four siblings. After an apprenticeship as typesetter, he studied graphic design in Munich. In 1960 Maurer left Germany for the U.S., where he worked in New York and San Francisco as a freelance graphic designer, including for IBM. In 1963, he moved back to Germany, founding Design M, a company developing and manufacturing lamps after his own designs. The company was later renamed to \\"Ingo Maurer GmbH\\". One of his first designs, the Bulb (1969), was included in the design collection of the Museum of Modern Art in 1969. In 1984 he presented the low-voltage wire system YaYaHo, consisting of two horizontally fixed metal ropes and a series of adjustable lighting elements with halogen bulbs; it became an instant success. Maurer was asked to create special YaYaHo installations for the exhibition \\"Lumi√®res je pense √† vous\\" (\\"Lights I think of you\\") at Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris, the Villa Medici in Rome, and the Institut Francais d'Architecture in Paris. In 1989 Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain (Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art) in Jouy-en-Josas near Paris organized the exhibition \\"Ingo Maurer: Lumi√®re Hasard R√©flexion\\" (Ingo Maurer: Light Chance Reflection). For this exhibition, Maurer created lighting objects and installations that were not meant for serial production for the first time. Since 1989, his design and objects have been presented in a series of exhibitions, including the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (1993). In 2002 the Vitra Design Museum organized Ingo Maurer ‚Äì Light ‚Äì Reaching for the Moon, a travelling exhibition with several shows in Europe and in Japan. In 2007 the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York presented the exhibition Provoking Magic: Lighting of Ingo Maurer. Maurer created many objects using LEDs. The first was the lighting object Bellissima Brutta in 1996. In 2001 he presented a table lamp with LEDs with the name EL.E.Dee. Since 2006, he is also experimenting with organic light-emitting diodes, presenting two objects in 2006, and a table lamp as limited edition. Besides the design of lamps for serial production, Ingo Maurer created and planned light installation for public or private spaces. In Munich, he created light installations at Westfriedhof subway station (1998), and the renovation and lighting concept for M√ºnchner Freiheit U-Bahn station opened in December 2009. For Issey Miyake he realised an installation for a fashion show in Paris (1999). From 2003‚Äì05 he designed an entrance and lighting objects for the Kruisherenhotel in Maastricht. In 2006 he created lighting objects and installations for the interior of the Atomium in Brussels. Among his most well-known designs are the winged bulb Lucellino (1989) and Porca Miseria! (1994), a suspension lamp made with porcelain shards. From the early 1980s on Maurer worked with a team of younger designers and developers. In 2011, the redesign for the underground area of the Marienplatz U-Bahn station in Munich, Germany, was awarded to Maurer with Allmann Sattler Wappner. Ingo Maurer GmbH had two showrooms, one in Munich and the other in New York. He died in a Munich hospital on 21 October 2019.

There exist several systems of employee wage payment and incentives, which can be classified under the following names. Different Methods ;Time Rate Systems * Time Rate System: Under this system, the worker is paid by the hour, day, week, or month. * High Wage plan: Under this plan a worker is paid a wage rate which is substantially higher than the rate prevailing in the area or in the industry. In return, he is expected to maintain a very high level of performance, both quantitative and qualitative. * Measured day work : According to this method the hourly rate of the time worker consists of two parts, namely, fixed and variable. The fixed element is based on the nature of the job i.e. the rate for this part is fixed on the basis of job requirements. The variable portion varies for each worker depending upon his merit rating and the cost-of-living index. * Differential time rate : According to this method, different hourly rates are fixed for different levels of efficiency. ;Payment on Result * Piece Work  Straight piecework system : The wages of the worker depend upon his output and rate of each unit of output; it is in fact independent of the time taken by him.  Differential piece work system: This system provide for higher rewards to more efficient workers. For different levels of output below and above the standard, different piece rates are applicable. * Taylor Differential Piece Work System * Merrick Differential Piece-rate System * Combination of Time and Piece Work  Gantt task and bonus system: the system consists of paying a worker on time basis if he does not attain the standard and on piece basis (high rate) if he does.

History  Nearmap was founded in Perth, Western Australia, by Stuart Nixon in 2008. Nearmap's first capture of aerial imagery dates back to 2007. In 2012, the business was acquired by an ASX-listed company Ipernica and becoming the primary entity. Nearmap then moved its headquarters from Perth to Sydney. In 2014, the company expanded into the United States market. In 2017, Nearmap expanded its capture program and surveyed New Zealand's top 13 most populated cities, including Queenstown. The same year, Nearmap expanded its aerial imaging content to provide 3D models of Australia's major capital cities. The business now offers Digital Service Model (DSM) and textured mesh data sets for bespoke download.  Business   Concept  Historically, aerial imagery was available mainly to government and large enterprises, as it was quite an expensive and long process. First, a surveying company had to be engaged to take photos of a certain area of interest. Then, the data would be manually processed and stitched together digitally to create aerial maps. Imagery was then delivered on a hard disk. The entire process could take months and was repeated once every few years at best. Nearmap disrupted this model by creating a patented camera system and software pipeline that enables the company to capture aerial photos, stitch them together into seamless digital maps, and publish the content online within days of capture. With the cost of capture significantly lower than anything else on the market, Nearmap can update surveys more frequently and at a much lower cost. Its subscription model has effectively made high-quality aerial imagery available to a far wider swath of businesses and government organisations. Nearmap captures aerial images frequently, up to six times a year in urban centres, at a resolution of 5.8 cm - 7.5 cm per pixel or better. By capturing aerial images with airplanes (as opposed to with satellites), Nearmap is able to solve for potential weather or atmospheric obstructions. The images are quickly processed and streamed to the cloud in a matter of days, where they are available for viewing and analysis on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Nearmap provides its high-resolution aerial imagery content as a subscription service to a broad base of customers from diverse industries including construction, engineering, urban planning, insurance, solar, telecom, utilities, and government entities across local, state, and federal agencies. Subscribers use Nearmap to remotely inspect locations for better informed planning and monitoring; evaluate properties and infrastructural assets; and understand historical context at their locations of interest. Nearmap serves over 8,200 businesses and organisations globally.  Product  Nearmap provides several types of aerial imagery: Vertical, Panorama, Measurable Obliques and 3D. Vertical imagery is also known as orthorectified, providing a top-down view of the ground captured at a 90¬∞ angle. Orthorectification is a process used to correct the terrain distortion in aerial or satellite images that results from variations in the surface of the Earth and tilt of the satellite or aerial sensor being used to collect the data. This process allows accurate information to be gathered from the images such as distances, angles, and positions. The Nearmap Panorama product provides a seamless mosaic view of locations and features from all four cardinal directions in a single viewing experience. Circumventing the need to switch from one image to another to view content from multiple perspectives, Nearmap Panorama allows users to pan and zoom across a large footprint uninterrupted, allowing information to be reviewed much more quickly. Nearmap's Measurable Obliques allow users to make accurate height measurements of buildings and other ground features. Users can then export these images with the measurements and annotations included, allowing multiple stakeholders to communicate with accurate detail to an entire project team. Nearmap aerial imagery is delivered through an easy-to- use cloud-based interface called MapBrowser‚Ñ¢ or through API integrations. The MapBrowser web application allows users to easily switch base layers from Vertical to Panorama or Measurable Obliques content. It also allows users to navigate and search Nearmap's library of current and historical content, and includes tools for measuring and analysing locations. Nearmap's APIs offer integration with Esri¬Æ ArcGIS, Autodesk, CAMA systems, and other leading GIS and CAD applications via standard industry protocols including WMS, WMTS, and TMS. Along with current imagery, Nearmap's online archive offers an extensive gallery of historical imagery; as of 2018, up to 10 years of photographic maps were available for some parts of Australia.

The cantata text was provided by Erdmann Neumeister, who quoted the Book of Revelation and framed his work by two hymn stanzas, the beginning of Martin Luther's \\"\\", the main hymn for Advent with a melody based on Medieval chant, and the end from Philipp Nicolai's \\"\\". The librettist quoted developed his thoughts like a sermon. Bach structured the cantata in six movements, beginning with a chorale fantasia, followed by a series of alternating recitatives and arias, and concluded by a four-part chorale. He scored it for three vocal soloists (soprano, tenor and bass), strings and continuo. Bach led the first performance on 2 December 1714. As , director of music of the main churches of Leipzig, he performed the cantata again on 28 November 1723.  History and words  On 2 March 1714 Bach was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe- Weimar. As concertmaster, he assumed the principal responsibility for composing new works, specifically cantatas for the ' (palace church), on a monthly schedule. The exact chronological order of Bach's Weimar cantatas remains uncertain. Only four bear autograph dates. BWV 61 is dated 1714 and bears the liturgical designation \\"\\", the First Sunday of Advent. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Romans, \\"now is our salvation nearer\\" (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the Entry into Jerusalem (). Erdmann Neumeister, the librettist The cantata text was provided by Erdmann Neumeister, published in Geistliche Poesien in Frankfurt in 1714. He began and ended his work with a hymn stanza. \\"\\" is the main hymn for Advent, which Martin Luther had derived from the Latin . Its melody is based on Medieval chant and supplies a \\"dark, imposing character\\". For the conclusion, Neumeister chose the second part, the , of the seventh and final stanza of Philipp Nicolai's \\"\\". The librettist quoted the Book of Revelation in the fourth movement: \\"\\" ‚Äì \\"Behold, I stand at the door and knock. Anyone that hears My voice and opens the door, to him I will enter and keep the evening meal with him and he with me.\\" (). The poet combined the ideas of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and his promise to return with an invitation to enter the heart of the individual Christian. He developed his thoughts like a sermon, as the Bach scholar Alfred D√ºrr notes: mentioning that the arrival of Jesus brings blessing every day (movement 2), a prayer that Jesus may come to his congregation (movement 2), and in response to his statement of being at the door (movement 4) the opening of the heart of the individual Christian who knows about his sinfulness (movement 5). Bach had set one text by Neumeister before, possibly by 1713, in his cantata Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel f√§llt, BWV 18. Because of Bach's liturgical designation, the performance can be precisely dated to 2 December 1714. As , director of music of the main churches of Leipzig, Bach performed the cantata again on 28 November 1723, beginning the first liturgical year in the new position. Bach paid attention to the exceptional occasion at beginning of the liturgical year, also when he composed later the chorale cantata Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BWV 62 (1724), and Schwingt freudig euch empor, BWV 36 (1731), which are all inspired by Luther's hymn. Bach also began his by a setting of the same tune. In Leipzig, the first Sunday in Advent was the last chance to hear cantata music before Christmas, because tempus clausum was observed during Advent.  Music   Structure and scoring  Bach structured the cantata in six movements, beginning with chorale fantasia, followed by a series of alternating recitatives and arias and concluded by a chorale. He scored it for three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of violins (Vl), two violas (Va), and basso continuo (Bc), including cello (Vc) and bassoon (Fg). The autograph score is titled: \\"Dominica 1. Adventus Xsti. / Nun komm der Heyden Heyland. / √¢ . / due Violini / due Viole / Violoncello / √® & / Fagotto. / Sopr: Alto. Tenore √® Ba√üo / Col' / Organo. / da / Joh Sebast Bach / anno. / 1714\\". The duration is given as 18 minutes. According to the Bach scholar Christoph Wolff, the use of two viola parts is French style. D√ºrr notes that perhaps the strings were doubled by oboes, at least in the Leipzig performance, in a practise that was \\"not always marked in the score\\". In the following table of the movements, the scoring, keys and time signatures are taken from D√ºrr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.  Movements  = 1 = The first Sunday of Advent begins the liturgical year. Bach marked it by creating the opening chorus, \\"\\" (Now come, Saviour of the Gentiles), as a chorale fantasia in the style of a French overture, which follows the sequence slow ‚Äì fast (fugue) ‚Äì slow. In a French opera performance, the King of France would have entered during the overture; Bach greets a different king. Two of the four lines of the chorale melody are combined in the first slow section, line three is treated in the fast section, and line four in the final slow section. The melody of line 1 is first presented in the continuo, then sung by all four voices one after another, accompanied by a solemn dotted rhythm in the orchestra. Line 2 is sung by all voices together, accompanied by the orchestra. Line 3 is a fast , with the instruments playing , marked \\"gai\\". Line 4 is set as line 2. Wolff notes that Bach possibly followed the model of an opera by Agostino Steffani, Henrico Leone, which uses a chorus in a French overture. = 2 = The recitative for tenor, \\"\\" (The Saviour has come), begins but continues as an , with tenor and continuo imitating one another. This more lyrical style of recitative derives from early Italian operas and cantatas, where it was known as ' ‚Äì half aria. = 3 = The tenor aria, \\"\\" (Come, Jesus, come to Your Church), is accompanied by the violins and violas in unison. It is written in the rhythm of a gigue, and the combination of voice, unison strings and continuo gives it the texture of a trio sonata. D√ºrr comments that the use of the unison string ritornello, played even during the vocal passages, provides a \\"rather pointedly strict and unified character\\". The musicologist Richard Taruskin comments: \\"This hybridization of operatic and instrumental styles is ... standard operating procedure in Bach's cantatas.\\" = 4 = John Eliot Gardiner, 2007 The quote from Revelation, \\"\\" (See, I stand before the door and knock), is given as a recitative to the bass as the (voice of Christ). The knocking on the door is expressed by chords in the strings. D√ºrr notes: \\"The most expressive text-engendered declamation is here ingeniously melted down into a structure only ten bars long but of compelling musical logic.\\" John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, compares it to an Emmaus scene in Bach's later cantata Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden, BWV 6, the \\"post-Resurrection appearance to the disciples\\" in Halt im Ged√§chtnis Jesum Christ, BWV 67, even to \\"the entry of the Commendatore in Mozart‚Äôs opera Don Giovanni. Bach would later frequently use the bass as the voice of Christ, in his St Matthew Passion even with a similar string accompaniment. = 5 = The response to the invitation is the individual prayer of the soprano, \\"\\" (Open, my whole heart). It is accompanied only by the continuo, with an adagio middle section. = 6 = In the closing chorale, \\"\\" (Amen, amen! Come, you fair crown of joy), Bach sets the Abgesang only of the final stanza of Nicolai's hymn. The musicologist Julian Mincham offers the thought: \\"Conceivably the most convincing explanation lies, as it so often does, within the text‚Äì ... do not delay, I await You longingly. The hymn tune itself, through its very abbreviation implies a sense of urgency and the feeling of being unable to defer any longer.\\" In Bach's setting, the violin adds a jubilant fifth part to the four vocal parts. The violin has to \\"climb three octaves to convey the extent of the soul's longing for the joys of a future life and the prospect of Jesus returning at the end of time\\".

ATX PC Power Supply with Forward Converter (heat sinks are removed for better view) The forward converter is a DC/DC converter that uses a transformer to increase or decrease the output voltage (depending on the transformer ratio) and provide galvanic isolation for the load. With multiple output windings, it is possible to provide both higher and lower voltage outputs simultaneously. While it looks superficially like a flyback converter, it operates in a fundamentally different way, and is generally more energy efficient. A flyback converter stores energy in the magnetic field in the inductor air gap during the time the converter switching element (transistor) is conducting. When the switch turns off, the stored magnetic field collapses and the energy is transferred to the output of the flyback converter as electric current. The flyback converter can be viewed as two inductors sharing a common core with opposite polarity windings. In contrast, the forward converter (which is based on a transformer with same-polarity windings, higher magnetizing inductance, and no air gap) does not store energy during the conduction time of the switching element ‚Äî transformers cannot store a significant amount of energy, unlike inductors.http://www.digikey.com/web%20export/supplier%20content/Infineon_448/mkt/coolMOS/SingleXTRForward.pdf?redirected=1 Instead, energy is passed directly to the output of the forward converter by transformer action during the switch conduction phase.

A pishtaco is a mythological boogeyman figure in the Andes region of South America, particularly in Peru and Bolivia. Some parts of the Andes refer to the pishtaco as kharisiri, or √±akaq, or lik'ichiri in the Aymara language. Legend and its effects According to folklore, a pishtaco is an evil monster-like man‚Äîoften a stranger and often a white man‚Äîwho seeks out unsuspecting Indians to kill them and abuse them in many ways. The legend dates back to the Spanish conquest of South America. Primarily, this has been stealing their body fat for various cannibalistic purposes, or cutting them up and selling their flesh as fried chicharrones. Pishtaco derives from the local Quechua-language word \\"pishtay\\" which means to \\"behead, cut the throat, or cut into slices\\".Benson:xx The preoccupation with body fat has a long tradition in the Andes region. Pre-Hispanic natives prized fat so much that a deity, Viracocha (meaning sea of fat), existed for it. It is also natural for the peasant rural poor to view fleshiness and excess body fat as the very sign of life, good health, strength and beauty. Many illnesses are thought to have their roots in the loss of body fats, and skeletal thinness is abhorred.Weismantel:199-200 With this, the conquistadores' practice of treating their wounds with their enemies' corpse fats horrified the Indians.McLagan:216. Marrin:76 Spaniards are also said to have killed Indians and boiled their corpses to produce fat to grease their metal muskets and cannons, which rusted quickly in the humid Amazon. Andean Aboriginals feared Spanish missionaries as pishtacos, believing the missionaries were killing people for fat, thereafter oiling churchbells to make them especially sonorous.Kristal In modern times, similar beliefs held that sugar mill machinery needed human fat as grease,Franco or that jet aircraft engines could not start without a squirt of human fat.Scheper-Hughes:236 Pishtaco beliefs have affected international assistance programs, e.g. leading to rejection of the US Food for Peace program by several communities, out of fears that the real purpose was to fatten children and later exploit them for their fat. Natives have attacked survey geologists working on the Peruvian and Bolivian altiplano who believed that the geologists were pishtacos.Gow The work of anthropologists has been stymied because measurements of fat folds were rumoured to be part of a plot to select the fattest individuals later to be targeted by pishtacos.Nordstrom:122 In 2009, the pishtaco legend was cited as a possible contributory factor in the apparent fabrication of a story by Peruvian police of a gang murdering up to 60 people to harvest their fat. In popular culture The pishtaco is prominently referenced in the novel Death in the Andes by Mario Vargas Llosa. In the book, two members of the Peruvian Civil Guard investigate the disappearance of three men, trying to determine if they were killed by the Shining Path guerilla group or by mythical monsters. Pishtacos were primary plot source drivers and antagonists in the ninth season episode \\"The Purge\\" of the TV series Supernatural, where a human male marries a pishtaco female and the two start a weight-loss retreat so the female could sustain herself while helping those who wished to lose weight, only for her brother to decide that he preferred killing those he fed from. A minor running gag was the near homophony of the word \\"pishtaco\\" with the phrase \\"fish taco\\". Pistacos are also featured in the Gail Carriger novel \\"Competence,\\" the third book in her Custard Protocol series. The crew of the Spotted Custard travel to the Peruvian Andes in search of a supposed newly discovered breed of vampire that is on the verge of extinction. The pishtacos in this story are described as being very tall, incredibly thin, shock-white haired, and red eyed with a single columnar tooth for fat-sucking instead of the traditional elongated canine teeth of vampires for blood-sucking. We learn that this appearance is a result of the transformation from human to pishtaco when Rue, who can steal a supernatural's form temporarily, takes a pishtaco's form and immediately begins to change appearance. The pishtacos in this story also feed not on blood, but on fat. Also in Shadow of the Tomb Raider as mythical creatures who hunt the organization of Trinity.

It includes the coastal flooded savannas and grasslands in the deltas of the Zambezi, Pungwe, Buzi, and Save rivers. Geography The Zambezi, Pungwe, Buzi, and Save rivers drain extensive areas of interior Southeast Africa. Rainfall in the region is highly seasonal, and the volume of water carried by these rivers varied with the wet and dry cycles of the year. The flooded savannas are found in low-lying coastal lowlands at the river mouths, on deposits of recent fluvisols deposited by the rivers. They Zambezian coastal flooded savannas cover an area of 19,346 km¬≤. The Zambezi flooded savannas cover the largest area, extending nearly 200 km along the Indian Ocean coast and extending up to 120 km inland. To the south are the adjoining floodplains of the Pungwe and Buzi, which create a flooded savanna of 4500 km¬≤. The smaller Save River flooded savannas lie further to the south. The East African mangroves lie between the flooded savannas and the coast in areas of brackish or salt water. The Southern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic ecoregion occupies the coastal uplands adjacent to the flooded savannas. The drier Zambezian and mopane woodlands occupy the inland river valleys. Flora The plant communities include flooded grasslands, flooded savannas, and freshwater swamp forests, which vary with soils and the duration of flooding. Reed swamps of Phragmites australis and Typha capensis are common in permanently-flooded areas. The grasses Hyparrhenia, Ischaemum, and Setaria predominate in seasonally-flooded areas with clay soil. Trees and shrubs of the flooded savannas include Parinari curatellifolia, Uapaca nitida, and Syzygium guineense. There are areas of Borassus aethiopum palm savanna. Swamp forests grow at the edges of rivers, lakes, and lagoons, and characteristic trees include Barringtonia racemosa, Ficus verruculosa, and the palm Phoenix reclinata. Fauna Large mammals in the ecoregion include hippo (Hippopotamus amphibius), African buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer), waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), southern reedbuck (Redunca arundium), plains zebra (Equus quagga), Nyala (Tragelaphus angasi), blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus), steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), and common warthog (Phacochoerus africanus). Mammal predators include the lion (Panthera leo), leopard (P. pardus), cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), side- striped jackal (Canis adustus), Cape genet (Genetta tigrina), African civet (Civettictis civetta), serval (Leptailurus serval), African clawless otter (Aonyx capensis), spotted-necked otter (Hydrictis maculicollis), banded mongoose (Mungos mungo), white-tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda), and bushy-tailed mongoose (Bdeogale crassicauda). Some large mammals migrate seasonally between the flooded savannas and the grasslands, forests, and woodlands of the neighboring uplands. Common eland (Taurotragus oryx) migrates to the seasonal wetlands at the start of the rainy season to browse on the young grasses. Populations of Lichtenstein‚Äôs hartebeest (Alcelaphus lichtensteinii) and sable antelope (Hippotragus niger) live in the flooded savannas during the dry season, and migrate to the uplands at the start of the rainy season. The flooded savannas are home to large populations of resident and migratory water birds, including African openbill stork (Anastomus lamelligerus), saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), lesser flamingo (Phoeniconaias minor), great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), great snipe (Gallinago media), and African skimmer (Rynchops flavirostris). Conservation and threats The construction of large dams on the Zambezi ‚Äì Kariba Dam, completed in 1959, and Cahora Bassa Dam, completed in 1974 ‚Äì altered the ecology of the Zambezi, reducing the annual wet-season flooding of the lower Zambezi and the overall volume of both water and sediment coming into the flooded savannas. Other threats include poaching and over-hunting. Wildlife was decimated during the Mozambican Civil War, and the African bush elephant (Loxodonta africana) and black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis) were extirpated. Protected areas A 2017 assessment found that 6,212 km¬≤, or 32%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas.Eric Dinerstein, David Olson, et al. (2017). An Ecoregion-Based Approach to Protecting Half the Terrestrial Realm, BioScience, Volume 67, Issue 6, June 2017, Pages 534‚Äì545; Supplemental material 2 table S1b. Protected areas include Marromeu National Reserve in the southwestern Zambezi delta, and the adjacent coutadas or hunting areas.

History The railroad workers team from the Danube port of Por≈£ile de Fier was founded in 1928, under president I. TipƒÉrescu. The first antebellum appearance is recorded in 1939‚Äì40 (9th place in the Liga II). In 1940‚Äì41, it finishes first in the series and wins the right to promote to the Liga I, but the championship is interrupted because of the war. Players used in that period were: Robu, Negru, C.

The main event of the event was a Lucha de Apuestas, hair vs. hair match between the teams of El Texano Jr. and El Terrible against No Limit (Yujiro and Naito), which was the latest highlight of a \\"Mexico vs. Japan\\" storyline that CMLL has presented since the summer of 2009. Also on the show was a match for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship as reigning champions Volador Jr. and La Sombra defends against Los Hijos del Averno (Mephisto and Ephesto). The show featured four additional matches, three six- man, two out of three falls, tag team matches that is the most common match form in CMLL, and one Relampago or Lightning match, a one fall match between Mini-Estrella Mascarita Dorada and Peque√±o Dami√°n 666. Production Background The Mexican wrestling company Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (Spanish for \\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker Sin Salida (\\"No Ext\\" or \\"No Escape\\"). CMLL has intermittently held a show billed specifically as Sin Salida since 2009, primarily using the name for their \\"end of the year\\" show in December, although once they held a Sin Piedad show in August as well. All Sin Salida shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its \\"home\\". Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the Sin Salida shows replace their regularly scheduled Super Viernes show. The 2009 Sin Salida show was the first show to use the name. Storylines The event featured six professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Aftermath No Limit returned to Japan a few weeks after losing the Apuesta match to El Texano Jr. and El Terrible. Upon their return to New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) for their Wrestle Kingdom IV in Tokyo Dome show they defeated Team 3D (Brother Ray and Brother Devon) and Bad Intentions (Karl Anderson and Giant Bernard) to win the IWGP Tag Team Championship. Their first defense of the title was on February 14, against the team of Texano Jr. and El Terrible who travelled to Japan for the match. After departing CMLL, Naito made a return in January, promising to work in Mexico between tours with NJPW. The feud between Texano Jr. and El Terrible has since been downplayed to the extent that the team has at times teamed with La Ola Amarilla's newest representative Taichi. The storyline between the Brazos family (Brazo de Plata and M√°ximo mainly) and La Peste Negra saw M√°ximo and Mr. Niebla being teamed for CMLL's CMLL Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles tournament due to the rules of the tournament pairing rudos and tecnicos together. The team worked together so well that they two worked a series of matches together under the nickname La Peste Con Amour (\\"The Love Plague\\"), hinting at M√°ximo turning rudo. The storyline abruptly ended in February when Mr. Niebla stopped appearing on CMLL booking.
