Biography  Dov Shmotkin was born in 1949 in Rishon Le-Zion, Israel. He is Professor Emeritus in the School of Psychological Sciences and Head of the Herczeg Institute on Aging, both at Tel Aviv University, where he also received his Ph.D. He is a senior clinical psychologist and was formerly the head of the clinical psychology graduate program in the School of Psychological Sciences. Shmotkin was Visiting Scholar in the Institute of Gerontology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (1988‚Äì89), and Honorary Fellow in the Institute on Aging at the University of Wisconsin, Madison (1996‚Äì97), USA. He has served as a senior researcher and member in the research teams of prominent nationwide surveys on the Israeli older population, namely the Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Aging Study (CALAS) and the Israeli branch of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE-Israel). He also directed a project that harmonized databases of CALAS, SHARE-Israel, and other studies of Israeli aging populations. Dov Shmotkin is a Fellow of the Gerontological Society of America.  Research  Dov Shmotkin's scientific work has solidified the dialectical approach to human happiness and suffering, emphasizing developmental paths along adulthood and old age. His main concern has been to explore psychological mechanisms whereby people can maintain well-being and resilience in the face of life adversities and aging processes that may inflict trauma, decline and loss. In his conceptual model, entitled The Pursuit of Happiness in a Hostile World, Shmotkin, along with associates who made vital contributions (mainly his former doctoral students), have developed a dynamic view on the intertwinement of resilience and vulnerability. The conceptual and empirical work of Shmotkin in the domains of gerontology sought to elucidate how wellness, adaptational functioning and self-fulfillment might counter frailty, disability and disintegration in later life. The emerging theme that unifies these scientific works is Shmotkin's humanistic quest for more refined and differential views over the interfaces of well-being and distress in human lives.  The Pursuit of Happiness in a Hostile World  It is widely held that happiness is achieved through two major systems: subjective well-being (people's evaluations of the satisfaction and pleasantness in their lives) and meaning in life (people's conceptions that they lead a life corresponding to their values and potentials). While most approaches regard happiness as a mental outcome, Shmotkin's model considers it a process. Accordingly, both subjective well-being and meaning in life systems regulate, or otherwise reconstruct, personal conceptions of hostile-world scenarios. The concept of hostile-world scenario is central for depicting the image that each individual has about actual or potential threats to one's life or, more broadly, to one's physical and mental integrity. The hostile-world scenario dwells on self-beliefs about catastrophes and inflictions such as accidents, violence, natural disasters, wars, illness, breakup of close relationships, losses of beloved ones, aging, and death. For most people, the hostile-world scenario is an adaptive mechanism for scanning potentially adverse conditions in life. Yet, when under-activated, it may induce a fool's paradise with reckless behaviors and, when over-activated, it may produce a horrible sense of living in a disastrous world. The ever-active negotiations between the happiness-promoting systems and the hostile-world scenario constitute the dynamic core of the model. The pursuit of happiness, rather than happiness itself, provides individuals with a favorable psychological environment that allows them to function competently despite the imminence of hostile-world scenarios. The study of these dynamics exposes various mechanisms of resilience whereby the happiness-promoting systems, in threatening conditions, may amplify each other or possibly compensate for each other. Non-resilient mechanisms are also possible when hostile-world scenarios involve increased depletion and vulnerability. Mechanisms of these kinds, along with related tenets of Shmotkin's model, have been accumulatively illuminated by a body of empirical findings derived from diverse populations. Besides empirical works that have been published, the model has been evoking an array of validation endeavors that currently expand the underlying conceptualization and still await publication.  The Multiple Appearances of Happiness  In line with its dynamic features, Shmotkin's work explicated multiple modules and configurations of happiness. For example, different synchronic combinations between dimensions of subjective well-being (e.g., life satisfaction, positive affect) produced differential types of well-being among individuals. Notably, some of these types were internally inconsistent (e.g., people that were high on life satisfaction but low on positive affect). Also important were diachronic combinations where subjective well-being was queried in relation to different time zones (past, present, future), thus depicting varying temporal trajectories that conveyed different narratives about how one's well-being evolved along the individual's life course. Shmotkin also investigated how people conceived their well-being in relation to their past life, as reflected in the concept of anchor periods, referring to paramount experiences in one's remembered past (e.g., ‚Äúthe happiest period in my life,‚Äù ‚Äúthe most miserable period in my life‚Äù). The studies showed that people formed an emotional matrix of happiness and suffering in past periods of their lives. This matrix reflected both consistent and inconsistent feelings, which were found associated with current subjective well-being, reactions to trauma, and coping with aging. These varied modules, both within one's subjective well-being and in combination with meaning in life, constitute diverse options of coping with adversities in life. Through his emphasis on multiple appearances of happiness, Shmotkin advocated the use of person-centered, rather than variable-centered, methods in order to delineate unattended configurations of human functioning and well- being. Thus, the use of this approach contrasted types of individuals that maintained congruity in their relative standing on related variables (e.g., subjective well-being and meaning in life) and types that were incongruent in this regard. Such incongruent types may indicate conflicting or ambivalent inclinations within individuals, but may also encompass adaptational advantages. This notion is in line with Shmotkin's dialectical view that resilience and vulnerability, mainly in disadvantageous and distressful conditions, co-reside within the same individuals.  The Endurance of Holocaust Survivors and the Long-Term Effects of Trauma in Life  In Shmotkin's studies, Holocaust survivors present a paradigm of extreme trauma happening early in life with sequelae lingering up to their old age. In his approach, the trauma is a test case for the functionality of the happiness- promoting systems in tackling the intensified hostile-world scenario and suggesting a world of normalcy. By studying Holocaust survivors in an array of community and national samples, Shmotkin and his colleagues highlighted a consistent conclusion that older survivors usually manifested general resilience in most life domains along with specific vulnerabilities in pertinent psychosocial issues. Coping with the trauma was modulated by properties of the survivors‚Äô time perspective on their period of traumatization and their ability to incorporate the trauma into a coherent life story. In reviews of research on Holocaust survivors, Shmotkin explicated how long-term effects of the survivors‚Äô trauma interacted with aging processes and family constellation. As part of the attempts to advance methodological approaches that facilitated new revelations, an intricate consideration in Shmotkin's studies on Holocaust survivors was the choice of focal and comparison groups. The question ‚ÄúWho is a survivor?‚Äù proved uneasy, and was approached by combining both subjective and factual criteria. It was also expounded that the habitual use of merely one comparison group in past studies on survivors was not methodologically suitable, and several different groups were actually required for allowing instructive comparability with the survivors‚Äô grouping. At another level, Shmotkin examined long-term traumatic effects by national data from the Israeli branch of Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE-Israel). Shmotkin and his collaborators delineated the notion of cumulative adversity, which typically characterized stressful experiences along biographical courses of older people, and further differentiated between self-oriented (primary harm was to the self) and other- oriented (primary harm was to another person) foci of potentially traumatic events. The investigatory team found that cumulative adversity, particularly of the self-oriented kind, was detrimental in various domains of physical and mental functioning.  Gerontological Investigations: Exploring the Underpinnings of Aging  Shmotkin's dialectical view extends into his gerontological work, where aging and old age constantly reflect opposite, yet interactive, vectors of resilience versus vulnerability and survival versus finitude. His work largely dwells on epidemiological national surveys (mainly CALAS and SHARE-Israel; see above), where he often juxtaposed concomitants of physical health and mental health. Thus, while physical factors were found increasingly dominant in predicting people's mortality in old age, certain psychosocial factors retained their distinctive predictive effect. Another main concern in Shmotkin's gerontological work has been the role of individuals‚Äô time perspective in understanding later life's phenomena. At old age, in an apparent paradoxical fashion, people usually preserve relatively high levels of happiness, even following harsh adversity in the past and in the face of a foreshortened future. Besides this inclination, Shmotkin's studies showed modes whereby older people sorted out positive and negative feelings from their past and buffered fears about their future. In these inquiries, notions of time perspective appeared fully embedded in the adjustment of people to their old age. In other directions, Shmotkin was also attracted to study aging-related issues that bore intriguing, yet scarcely examined, implications. Such issues included the continuity of adult children's bonds with their deceased parents, the inconsistency between objective and subjective indicators of one's memory in old age, the loosening relations between physical dysfunction and mental wellness in very old age, the agonizing affliction of bereavement over the loss of a child among aged parents, and the challenges of fatherhood and aging among gay versus heterosexual men.

The school provides secondary education from Year 7 to Year 11 that leads to O Level and IGCSE qualification.  Etymology  Sufri Bolkiah Secondary School is named after Prince Sufri Bolkiah, a brother of the current Sultan of Brunei, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.  History  Sufri Bolkiah Secondary School was established on 1 August 1969 as Tutong English School. Previously, the school was a branch of the English Preparatory School under Anthony Abell College in Seria from 1967. A separate administration was eventually established when there was a rise in student population as well as increasing difficulty in administering the Tutong branch due to the long distance between Tutong and Seria. At first, Tutong English School was temporarily housed at Muda Hashim Malay School, the predecessor of Muda Hashim Primary School. In 1971, a new permanent campus was completed and in April of the following year the school was officiated by His Royal Highness Prince Sufri Bolkiah. In conjunction with the inauguration, Tutong English School was renamed Sufri Bolkiah English School. In 1985, the school was upgraded from preparatory to secondary and eventually adopted its current name. The school becomes a single-sex school, only admitting female students, from 1998. At present, three are only four secondary schools nationwide that have female student population, the other three being Sekolah Tinggi Perempuan Raja Isteri (Raja Isteri Girls' High School), Pengiran Anak Puteri Hajah Masna Secondary School and Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Hajah Saleha Girls' Secondary Arabic Religious School, as well as one of the seven single-sex secondary schools in the country, with the remaining three schools only admitting boys.  Academics  The academic years consist of four or five years, beginning in Year 7. At the end of Year 11 (Year 10 for students in the 'express' stream), students sit for GCE O Level and/or IGCSE examination, which are provided by Cambridge International Examinations. For subjects pertaining to the Malay language and the religion of Islam, they are set by the Ministry of Education. Students opting for sixth form after finishing secondary go to Tutong Sixth Form Centre. Alternatively, pursuing vocational education is possible at various vocational and technical schools as well as private post-secondary institution in other districts.

He is the co-founder and CEO of Aurora, a company founded in 2017 to deliver the benefits of self-driving technology safely, quickly, and broadly. Chris has been instrumental in pioneering and advancing the development of self-driving vehicles since the early 2000s. While earning his PhD in Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University, Urmson‚Äôs technical leadership was critical in the development of his team‚Äôs robotic vehicles that participated in the DARPA Grand Challenges in 2004 and 2005 and the Urban Challenge in 2007. He was one of the original leaders of Google‚Äôs self-driving car project, which later spun off into Waymo in 2016. Education and Early Career Urmson earned his BSc in Computer Engineering from the University of Manitoba in 1998 and Ph.D. in Robotics from CMU in 2005; his thesis was entitled ‚ÄúNavigation Regimes for Off-Road Autonomy‚Äù. Urmson became a faculty member of the Robotics Institute at CMU and his research concentrated on motion planning and perception for robotic vehicles. He also served as the technical director of the DARPA Urban and Grand Challenge teams. Urmson and the CMU Tartan ‚ÄúRed‚Äù Racing team developed a robotic vehicle called Sandstorm, a converted Humvee, which went the furthest distance in the DARPA Grand Challenge in 2004 (however, no winner was declared that year). With Sandstorm and H1ghlander, a modified Hummer H1, CMU placed second and third in the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. In the DARPA Urban Challenge in 2007, his team developed a vehicle called Boss, a Chevy Tahoe, which won the competition. After his victory in the DARPA Urban Challenge, Urmson was approached by Google to lead their self-driving car project. Urmson led Google‚Äôs self- driving car project for nearly eight years. Under his leadership, Google vehicles accumulated 1.8 million miles of test driving. Urmson left Google in 2016. Career Urmson served as CTO on X, Google's self-driving car team, joining in 2009 and taking over from Sebastian Thrun as project lead in 2013. He was main engineer who built the code running Google‚Äôs autonomous software. Urmson left the company in 2016. Urmson founded Aurora Innovation with Sterling Anderson, the former director of Tesla Autopilot and Drew Bagnell, Uber's former autonomy and perception lead. Aurora is a startup dedicated to driverless car software, data and hardware, though not the cars themselves. With Aurora, Urmson aims to apply machine learning to the motion planning and perception components of autonomy simultaneously. Aurora In 2017, Urmson, along with Sterling Anderson, Tesla‚Äôs former head of Autopilot, and Drew Bagnell, a founding member and head of Uber‚Äôs autonomy and perception team, co-founded Aurora. Backed by Amazon and Sequoia, among others, the company is building the Aurora Driver, a platform that brings together software, hardware, and data services to fully operate any passenger or commercial vehicle. The Aurora Driver enables vehicles powered by it to move safely and efficiently through the world. It consists of the sensors that perceive the world, the software that plans a safe path through it, and the computer that powers and integrates them both with the vehicle. Under Urmson‚Äôs leadership, Aurora has raised nearly $700M through Series B financing, partnered with leading transportation companies, including Fiat Chrysler and Hyundai/Kia Motors, and strategically acquired Blackmore, a cutting-edge company specializing in Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) lidar. As of December 2019, Urmson leads a company of almost 400 employees with offices in Palo Alto, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, and Bozeman, Montana. Urmson and Aurora are focused on creating a transportation ecosystem around the Aurora Driver by partnering with automakers, logistics services, mobility services, and fleet management providers. The Aurora Driver itself is composed of sensors that perceive the world, software that plans a safe path through it, and a computer that powers and integrates them both with the vehicle.

A person who exhibits creepy behaviour is called a creep. Certain traits or hobbies may make people seem creepy to others. The internet has been described as increasingly creepy. Adam Kotsko has compared the modern conception of creepiness to the Freudian concept of unheimlich. The term has also been used to describe paranormal or supernatural phenomena. History and studies In the abstract the feeling of \\"creepiness\\" is subjective: for example some dolls have been described as creepy. During the 20th century, association was made between involuntary celibacy and creepiness. The concept of creepiness has only recently been formally addressed in social media marketing. Causes The state of creepiness has been associated with ‚Äúfeeling scared, nervous, anxious or worried‚Äù, ‚Äúawkward or uncomfortable‚Äù, ‚Äúvulnerable or violated‚Äù in a study conducted by Watt et al. Watt M. C., Maitland R. A., Gallagher C. E. (2017): A Case of the ‚ÄúHeeby Jeebies‚Äù: An Examination of Intuitive Judgements of ‚ÄúCreepiness‚Äù, Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science, Vol.49, n.1 This state arises in the presence of a creepy element, which can be an individual or, as recently observed, new technologies. Individuals Creepiness can be caused by the appearance of an individual. A study by McAndrew et al. McAndrew F. T., Koehnke S. S. (2016): On the nature of creepiness, New Ideas in Psychology, Vol.4 investigated the characteristics that make people creepy. Creepy people were thought to be more often male than female by an overwhelming majority of participants (around 95% of both males and females participants). Another study conducted by Watt et al. also found that participants associated the ectomorphic body type (more linear) with creepiness, more than the other two body types (51% vs mesomorphic, 24% and endomorphic, 23%). Other cues of creepiness included low hygiene, especially according to female participants, and a dishevelled appearance . Participants also identified the face as an area with potentially creepy features: in particular the eyes and the teeth. Both of those physical features were deemed creepy not only for their unpleasant appearance (ex. squinty eyes or crooked teeth) but also for the movements and expressions they engaged it (ex. darting eye movements and odd smiles). In fact, appearance doesn‚Äôt seem to be the only factor making an individual creepy: behaviours provide cues as well. Behaviours such as ‚Äúbeing unusually quiet and staring (34%), following or lurking (15%), behaving abnormally (21%), or in a socially awkward, \\"sketchy\\" or suspicious way (20%)‚Äù are all contributing to a feeling of creepiness, as described by Watt et al.‚Äôs study.  Technology  In addition to other individuals, new technologies, such as marketing‚Äôs targeted ads and AI, have been qualified as creepy. A study by Moore et al Moore R. S., Moore M. L., Shanahan K. J., Horky A., Mack B.(2015): Creepy marketing: three dimensions of perceived excessive online privacy violation, Marketing Management Journal, Vol.25 described what aspect of marketing participants considered creepy. The main three reasons are the following: using invasive tactics, causing discomfort and violating of norms. Invasive tactics are practiced by marketers that know so much about the consumer that the ads are ‚Äúcreepily‚Äù personalised. Secondly, some ads create discomfort by making the consumer question ‚Äúthe motives of the company advertising the product‚Äù. Finally, some ads violate social norms by having inappropriate content, for example by unnecessarily sexualizing it. It is marketing‚Äôs extensive knowledge used in an improper way, together with a certain loss of control over our data, that creates a feeling of creepiness. Another creepy aspect of technology is human looking AI: this phenomenon is called the uncanny valley. Humans find robots creepy when they start closely resembling humans. It has been hypothesised that the reason why they are viewed as creepy is because they violate our notion of how a robot should look. A study focusing on children's responses to this phenomenon found evidence to support the hypothesis.Brink K. A., Gray K. and Wellman H.M. (2019): Creepiness Creeps In: Uncanny Valley Feelings Are Acquired in Childhood, Child Dev, Vol.90 Evolutionary explanation Several studies have hypothesized that creepiness is an evolutionary response to potentially dangerous situations. It could be linked to a mechanism called agency detection which makes individuals expect malignant agents to be responsible for small changes in our environment. McAndrew et al. illustrates the idea with the example of a person hearing some noises while walking in a dark alley. That person would go in high alert, fearing that some dangerous individual was there. If that wasn‚Äôt the case the loss would be small. If, on the other hand, a dangerous individual was actually in the alley and the person had not been alerted by this creepy feeling, the loss could have been significant. Creepiness would therefore serve the purpose of alerting us in situations in which the danger isn‚Äôt outright obvious but rather ambiguous. In this case, ambiguity both refers to the possible presence of a threat and to its nature, sexual or physical for example. Creepiness ‚Äúmay reside in between the unknowing and the fear‚Äù in the sense that individuals experiencing it are unsure if there truly is something to fear or not. Truth is that creepy characteristics are not simply caused by threat potential: in fact, ectomorphic body types are not the most powerful bodies and facial expressions are not a proxy of physical strength either. Therefore, creepiness isn‚Äôt only related to how threatening a characteristic is, in the sense of how dangerous and strong the individual can be. There are more facets to consider. Another characteristic of creepiness is unpredictable behaviour. Unpredictability links back to this idea of ambiguity. When an individual is unpredictable it isn‚Äôt possible to tell when his behaviour will turn violent: this adds to the ambiguity of a potentially dangerous situation. This theory is endorsed by studies. Not only is unpredictability directly listed as a creepy characteristic, but other behaviours, such as norm-breaking behaviours are indirectly linked with unpredictability. Such behaviours show that the individual doesn‚Äôt conform to some social standards we would expect in a given situation. Leander N. P., Chartrand T. L., Bargh J. A. (2012): You give me the chills: Embodied reactions to inappropriate amounts of behavioral mimicry, Psychological Science, Vol.23 For example, we previously mentioned staring at strangers or lack of hygiene: those are behaviours that make us uneasy, creeped out, because they don‚Äôt fit the norm and therefore we don‚Äôt expect them. More generally, participants tended to define creepiness as ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù in the sense of not behaving, or looking, socially acceptable. Such differences point towards a ‚Äúsocial mismatch‚Äù. Humans have a natural system of detection of such mismatch: a physical feeling of coldness. When an individual is creeped out, they report feeling those ‚Äúcold chills‚Äù. This phenomenon has been studied by Leander et al, with relation to nonverbal mimicry in social interactions, meaning the unintentional copying of another‚Äôs behaviour. Inappropriate mimicry may leave a person feeling like something is off about the other. Absence of non-verbal mimicry in a friendly interaction, or the presence of it in a professional setting, raises suspicion as it doesn‚Äôt follow the norms. Individuals are left wondering what other unusual behaviour the other might engage in.

The firm has over 30 professionals, lawyers, and agents across all three offices and is one of Canada's longest operating IP firms.  History  1893 saw the beginning of what is known as Ridout & Maybee LLP‚Äîof John Gibbs Ridout and James Edward Maybee; however, the roots and reputation of the name date further back. Donald C. Ridout, a well- known, successful practitioner, began his practice the year of the confederation, 1867. He formed his first partnership in 1869 with an architect, James Smith, under the firm name of Ridout & Smith, Engineers and Architects While a simple patent practice in Upper Canada, during a time other big names in the IP world were starting out‚ÄîSmart, Biggar, Fetherstonhaugh, Dennison, and Riches, to name a few‚ÄîRidout and Smith are the Patent Agents responsible for the first patent issued post-Confederation in Canada; a minute but defining feature of Ridout name. The patent was granted to W. Hamilton for a ‚ÄúMachine for Measuring Liquids‚Äù.  The Evolution of the Ridout Practice  Smith departed from the firm in 1873, and the firm became Donald C. Ridout & Co. The firm at the time was described as ‚ÄúPatent Agents and (strangely) dealers in machinery‚Äù, a combination one will not find in today‚Äôs IP firms. From 1876 to 1880, the name changed with the addition of George Aird, a civil engineer, to Ridout, Aird & Co., and reverted again to Donald C. Ridout & Co upon the departure of Aird in 1880. Donald C. Ridout died in 1893, however, Charles H. Riches, a draughtsman at Donald Ridout & Co., purchased the goodwill to the firm and arranged for Donald C. Ridout Jr. to carry on the practice at 22 King Street East in Toronto. James Edward Maybee‚Äîone of the 3 draughtsmen at Donald Ridout & Co. starting in 1882‚Äîformed a partnership with John Gibbs Ridout, brother to Donald Jr., upon the death of Donald Ridout Jr. under the name Ridout & Maybee. It was at this time that the two draughtsmen began work on one of the only textbooks available on patents at the time titled ‚ÄúRidout on Patents‚Äù. The textbook was later published in 1894 by Rowsell and Hutchison and it was paramount in the growth in popularity of the practice of patent law in Canada. Like many strong partnerships, this one is not without its drama. History books explain how Maybee did most of the work, while Ridout received the profits. Upon John G. Ridout‚Äôs death in 1910, Maybee purchased the assets and goodwill of the company from Ridout‚Äôs widow and over the following years progressed in both profits and reputation. In the early 1930s, Maybee was approached by Lord Marks (of the British firm Marks & Clerk) with an interest in purchasing the business but declined his proposal. J. Edward Maybee retired in 1940, leaving his son Gareth to continue the practice after purchasing all of the business‚Äô assets. Gareth retired in January 1969 and was elected an honorary member of the Patent and Trademark Institute of Canada.

She was one of the women who participated in the push by pacifist feminists during World War I for world leaders to develop a mediating body to work for peace. The culmination of their efforts would be the achievement of the League of Nations when the war ended. Between 1935 and 1937, she served as one of the three international co-chairs of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). Early life Susanna Theodora Cornelia Hirschmann, known as \\"Cor\\", was born on 29 July 1871 in The Hague, the Netherlands to Sophie (n√©e Bahnsen) and Frederik Willem Louis Antonie Hirschmann. Her father was an administrator for the Royal Dutch Navy and died when she was nine years old, during a trip from the former Dutch colonies in India. She was raised by her mother in The Hague and attended the Christian Educational Academy in The Hague. In 1889 she earned her Lower Education teaching certificate () and the following year earned a certificate for French. Career After her graduation, Hirschmann and her mother moved to Nijmegen, where they supported themselves with her mother's widow's pension and her earnings from teaching. She earned her certification for physical education 1893. It is probable that during their time in Nijmegen, Hirschmann met Dirk Ramondt, a postal worker. Soon after completing her training, she and her mother moved to Utrecht and there on 15 June 1899, she married Ramondt. The young couple moved to Breda and were living there when their daughter Sophie was born. Coming in contact with the Dutch feminist movement, Ramondt- Hirschmann soon became a supporter of the international mother's association, the Vereeniging voor Vrouwenkiesrecht (VVK) and the International Women's Suffrage Alliance (IWSA). In 1903, the family moved to The Hague and Ramondt- Hirschmann began working as a secretary to the executive board of the Dutch Women's Council (), with other feminists such as Johanna Naber and . Around the same time, Ramondt-Hirschmann became involved with the Dutch Vegetarian Association and The Hague Association for Philosophy. She became interested in theosophy and began hosting lectures for the . Ramondt-Hirschmann regularly held presentations for the Dutch section of Theosophical Society. In 1912, the family moved again, settling in Amsterdam. Ramondt-Hirschmann became involved in the pacifist movement. She served as co-organizer of the International Congress of Women held in 1915 in The Hague. At the conference, Ramondt- Hirschmann was elected to serve as president of the Dutch branch of the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP), a new organization begun at the conference. Following the Congress, two delegations were formed to present the resolutions from the meeting to heads of state. Ramondt-Hirschmann was on the delegation which presented the resolutions to Scandinavia and Russia. Along with Emily Greene Balch, Chrystal Macmillan, Rosika Schwimmer, and Julia Grace Wales, Ramondt-Hirschmann formed the group speaking to peaceful nations. Jane Addams headed the other delegation, which spoke to nations at war. The first two stops, Denmark and Norway, were uneventful, with the exception that the taxi driver, who could not believe that a group of women had an appointment to see the King Haakon, circled the palace numerous times before finally delivering the group. In Sweden, they spoke with the Foreign Minister Knut Wallenberg, who agreed that Sweden would be willing to host a peace mediation conference if the women‚Äôs delegation could get two warring nations to agree to participate. In war, most diplomats refused to make definitive statements, and encouraged by this development, the group, without Schwimmer, who as a Hungarian could not enter Russia, made plans to go to Petrograd. After several days they managed to secure an interview with the Foreign Minister Sergei Sazonov, who despite his view that nothing would come of such a meeting, wrote a statement that Russia would not oppose a neutral mediating conference. Addams's group secured a similar statement from the Prime Minister of France, Ren√© Viviani, though this information was unknown to Ramondt-Hirschmann's group, as by the time they returned to The Hague, where both delegations were to have met, Addams had sailed for the United States. Meeting with Aletta Jacobs, the delegation decided to split up with Ramondt-Hirschmann and Schwimmer approaching the German Foreign Minister Gottlieb von Jagow, while Balch and Macmillan spoke with the Lord President of the Council Crewe, who was acting British Foreign Secretary. Von Jagow did not see any practical result, but agreed that Germany was not opposed to neutral mediation. Lord Crewe refused to \\"accept\\" a proposal, stating only that Britain would not place obstacles to such a meeting or object to a conference if it actually came to fruition. Armed with these statements, Schwimmer secured a promise from Wallenberg that he would present the plan to the Swedish Cabinet. In the meantime, while the delegates were abroad, Aletta Jacobs was putting pressure on the Dutch Prime Minister Pieter Cort van der Linden to host the conference at the Hague. Van der Linden wanted assurances that President Woodrow Wilson would favor conference and sent Jacobs on an official inquiry mission. They were unable to persuade Wilson to act and it would not be until the war had ended that the conference for the League of Nations would occur. Catherine E. Marshall, Sir George Paish, Jane Addams, Cor. Ramondt-Hirschmann, Jeanne Melin ‚Äì Emergency Peace Conference at the Hague \\"Conference for a New Peace\\" in 1922 In 1919, Ramondt-Hirschmann traveled with Jacobs and Mien van Wulfften Palthe to the ICWPP meeting in Z√ºrich, where the organization changed its name to the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF). Ramondt-Hirschmann became the international secretary of the WILPF in 1921; she would serve as secretary or adjoint secretary until 1936. She divorced her husband on 27 December 1923, gaining custody of her daughter. Between 1924 and 1926, she toured various cities in the United States, making speeches about peace, while her daughter was completing post graduate work at Bryn Mawr College. Between 1927 and 1930, she served as the General Secretary of the Dutch Theosophical Society, attending meetings abroad. In 1934, she and her daughter moved to Hilversum, where Sophie was employed as an educator. That same year, Ramondt- Hirschmann organized a silent demonstration for peace, known as the Women's Peace Walk. Demonstrators marched through The Hague and repeated the protest annually on May 18 until 1940. In 1935, Ramondt-Hirschmann took part in the protest against the group arrests of political dissidents by the Nazis. Between 1935 and 1937, she served as one of the three international co-chairs of the WILPF. During 1936, she served on the Supervisory Board of the Central Peace Bureau and began her participation in collecting relief funds for those in need due to the Spanish Civil War. In 1938, she returned to The Hague and lived there until the German invasion of the Netherlands, when she returned to Hilversum to live with her daughter and retired from peace work. Death and legacy Ramondt-Hirschmann died on 20 November 1957 at her daughter's home in Hilversum. She was one of the most noted women in the feminist pacifist movement of the first half of the twentieth century. She believed that women's participation in international politics would bring a sense of humanity to governance, and thus, their involvement was crucial.

It can be found in the Western Ghats in India and was discovered near the Srivilliputhur Grizzled Giant Squirrel Wildlife Sanctuary. The specific epithet honors Subramanian Bhupathy (1963-2014) who had a fatal fall while conducting herpetology field work near Agastya Mala hills on 28 April 2014. Description The species has purple skin and blue eyes and lives underground. It differs genetically, morphologically, and acoustically from the closely related Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis. Speciation between the two species is likely caused by the different monsoon seasons on the different sides of the Western Ghats, causing N. sahyadrensis to breed between May and August and N. bhupathi to breed between October and December. Geophysical implications Nasikabatrachus bhupathi and Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis have been found to be related to other frogs that live in the Seychelles, which are closer to Africa than to India. This is consistent with the idea that Africa and India were once part of the same ancient supercontinent, called Gondwanaland, which eventually became part of the later supercontinent, .

Her research focuses on natural language processing, multimodal processing, and computational social science.  Career  Mihalcea has a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from Southern Methodist University (2001) and a Ph.D. in Linguistics, Oxford University (2010). In 2017 she was named Director of the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at University of Michigan, Computer Science and Engineering. In 2018, Mihalcea was elected as new VP for the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL). She is a professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, where she also leads the Language and Information Technologies (LIT) Lab. Mihalcea has published over 220 articles since 1998 on topics ranging from semantic analysis of text to lie detection. President Barack Obama granted her the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers in 2008. Mihalcea is an outspoken promoter of diversity in computer science. She also supports an expansion of the traditional analysis of educational success, which tends to focus on academic behaviour, to include student life, personality and background outside of the classroom. Mihalcea leads Girls Encoded, a program designed to develop the pipeline of women in computer science as well as to retain the women who have entered into the program.  Awards  *ACM Fellow, 2019 \\"for contributions to natural language processing, with innovations in data-driven and graph-based language processing\\". *Sarah Goddard Power Award, 2019. *Carol Hollenshead Award, 2018. *Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), 2009. Awarded by President Barack Obama.  Research  Mihalcea is known for her research in natural language processing, multimodal processing, computational social sciences. In a collaboration she leads at the University of Michigan, Mihalcea has created software that can detect human lying. In a study of video clips of high profile court cases, a computer was more accurate at detecting deception than human judges. Mihalcea's lie-detection software uses machine learning techniques to analyze video clips of actual trials. In her 2015 study, the team used clips from The Innocence Project, a national organization that works to reexamine cases where individuals were tried without the benefit of DNA testing with the aim of exonerating wrongfully convicted individuals. After identifying common human gestures, they transcribed the audio from the video clips of trials and analyzed how often subjects labeled deceptive used various words and phrases. The system was 75% accurate in identifying which subjects were deceptive among 120 videos. That puts Mihalcea‚Äôs algorithm on par with the most commonly accepted form of lie detection, polygraph tests, which are roughly 85 percent accurate when testing guilty people and 56 percent accurate when testing the innocent. She notes there are still improvements to be made ‚Äî in particular to account for cultural and demographic differences. A possibly unique advantage of Mihalcea's study was the real world, high stakes nature of the footage analyzed in the study. In laboratory experiments, it is difficult to create a setting that motivates people to truly lie. In 2018, Mihalcea and her collaborators worked on an algorithm-based system that identifies linguistic cues in fake news stories. It successfully found fakes up to 76% of the time, compared to a human success rate of 70%.

London, p.343, note (c) He was the son and heir of Sir William de Ferrers (1240-1287) of Groby, the younger son of William de Ferrers, 5th Earl of Derby (by his second wife Margaret de Quincy, daughter and heiress of Roger de Quincy, 2nd Earl of Winchester (c.1195-1264)) who founded the line of Baron Ferrers of Groby, having been given Groby Castle by his mother Margaret de Quincy William Ferrers, 3rd Baron Ferrers of Groby (1333‚Äì1371) was a Leicestershire-based nobleman in fourteenth-century England who took part in some of the major campaigns of the first part of the Hundred Years' War. The eldest of two sons to Henry Ferrers, 2nd Baron Ferrers of Groby (d. 1343), he was ten years old when he succeeded his father to the Barony.http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/54521/65402  Early life  William Ferrers was born at the family caput of Newbold Verdon, Leicestershire, on 28 February 1333, and received baptism the same day. Two years after his father's death, an allowance of ¬£50 was remitted by the king and council for his care (later, in 1349, converted into a grant of the manors of Stoke on Tern, Wootton,and Hethe).Cokayne, G.E., The Complete Peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, Extant, Extinct or Dormant V, eds V. Gibbs & H.A. Doubleday (2nd ed., London 1916), 349. As he was still a minor, custody of his patrimony was shared between King Edward III's Queen, Philippa, and his son, Edward. William Ferrers grew up as the bubonic plague was ravaging the country, and like everywhere else, this had a severely deletorious effect on the Ferrers family's finances. Almost entire villages were being wiped out (for example, that of Hethe, one of the Ferrers' manors, lost 21 out of its 27 villeins) which meant whole crops were being lost and the value of those manors collapsed.  Career  Ferrers had been knighted by 1351, and the Queen granted him the estates of his that she held. Two years later, having paid homage to Edward III, he received livery of his estates in England and Ireland. Historian Eric Acheson has suggested that it was a direct consequence of the Black Death that led Ferrers to exchange away many of his outlying estates (for example, those in Shropshire) for some closer to home (in Buckinghamshire), with the Earl of March in the late 1350s. By 1364 he had also sold his remaining lands in Ireland, having already been exonerated from having taxes levied on his Irish estates for defence of that country in 1460, due to his constant service with the king in the preceding years, \\"at great cost to himself.\\"  Service in France  Acheson has also suggested that it was probably Ferrers' direly unstable financial situation that led him to seek a career in royal service, as the King had started a new war with France. Ferrers accompanied the Black Prince to Gascony in 1355. fought at the Battle of Crecy in 1355, at Poitiers the following year, and was with Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster in the 1359‚Äì60 Reims campaign. Ferrers last served in France in 1369, again with Lancaster, raiding Picardy and Caux that July. Family and death William Ferrers married twice. His first marriage was to Margaret, the coheiress of her childless brother William Ufford, Earl of Suffolk (in whose retinue he had seen French service in 1355), and her father the Robert d'Ufford, 1st Earl of Suffolk. This brought him further estates in Suffolk. With her, Willam had a son and two daughters; she had died by 1368. His next marriage was to another Margaret, the daughter of Henry de Percy, 2nd Baron Percy, the widow of Sir Robert de Umfraville. This marriage was childless and she survived Ferrers by four years. Ferrers last will and testament was written in July 1368, in which he requested interment in the family crypt at Ulverscroft Priory. He died in Stebbing, Essex, during the night of 8 January 1371. he was succeeded by his only son from his first marriage, Henry, who inherited the barony.

Standing at 1.85 m (6 ft. 1 in.), he plays at the point guard position.  Career   Club   Youth Teams  Diego took his first steps into basketball with the local Virtus Aprilia Team. He was discovered by Coach Massimiliano Briscese who brought him to Virtus Roma where he spent two years (2005‚Äì2007). In his first year with Virtus Roma he took part to the U14 Italian national finals in Bormio (with players born on 1992, older than him by one year), playing in the group ‚ÄúA‚Äù against Armani Jeans Milano, Pol Virtus Monte di Procida, O.F.P.

A few weeks later Diego will win his second national championship: the U17 national title being also selected in the all tournament first team.  Senior Teams  In 2011-2012 moved to Firenze (DNA League). Still being a player of Monte dei Paschi Siena, over the course of the same season, due to some injuries, he has been part of the Monte dei Paschi Siena‚Äô s roster for the Euroleague game vs Galatasaray in Turkey. In 2012-2013 moved to Junior Casale (Legadue) In 2013-2014 signed for Cus Bari Pallacanestro (Serie B), and over the course of the same year moved to Reggio Calabria (Legadue) In 2014-2015 signed with Chieti (Legadue), and at the end of the season is elected best young player of the A2 league. In 2015-2016 remained in Chieti, and that was one of the best seasons of his career with 32.2 MPG, 12.5 PPG, 3.1 APG and 2.9 RPG. He scored 30 points in the most important game of the season which allowed Chieti to remain in the Italian second division 3 games before the end of the season. In 2016-2017 Monaldi signed a 3 year deal with Dinamo Sassari, one of the elite teams of the Italian first league, where he also had the chance to compete in the European Champions League. Despite the 3 year contract, and the skills showed at this level too (despite the few minutes played), at the end of the season Diego decided to part with Sassari. On June 25, 2017 he signed with V.L. Pesaro. During the two season at Pesaro Diego has played 18,2http://web.legabasket.it/player/pbd.phtml?ply=MON- DIE-93&from;=1980&team;=1331&type2;=a&name;_search=Monaldi and 18,3http://web.legabasket.it/player/pbd.phtml?ply=MON- DIE-93&from;=1980&team;=1331&type2;=a&name;_search=Monaldi minutes per game providing his leadership and playmaking skills to the team and helping the VL to remain in the italian first league. On July 9th Signs a one year deal with Gevi Napoli (Italian second League), where he will be the starting PG for the ‚Äô19 ‚Äì ‚Äô20 season  National Team  In 2007-2008 Diego made his debut with the Italian U16 national team taking part in the popular ‚ÄúTorneo dell‚Äôamicizia‚Äù held in Spain. In the first game vs Spain in Guadalajara he scored 13 PTS. In 2008-2009 took part in the U16 European Championship held in Kaunas, Lithuania.

In 2012-2013 Diego is selected to play for the U20 Italian National team for taking part in the European U20 Championship in Tallinn, Estonia, where he won the gold medal In 2014-2015 is selected to join the ‚ÄúExperimental Italian Senior National Team‚Äù (the second Italian senior national team, aimed to support the first team by developing the players to possibly join the first team in future), for a series of games in China vs Russia, Ireland and China.  Player Profile  Diego is the typical combo-guard (able to play both the PG and SG positions), he can attack the basket or create opportunities for his teammates. He has often played alongside American PGs and SGs, and thanks to his technical and physical features can either balance the pace and the tempo within a particularly offensive back court, or be an offensive threat (as happened in his last season in Chieti, and in particular when he scored 30 points in the most important game of the year, allowing the team to remain in the Italian second league) Velocity, ball handling and court vision are his most important weapons on the basketball court, which allow him to be very effective in transition creating for himself 3 points, long 2, and driving to the basket opportunities, but also creating opportunities for the team dishing out to the open teammates.

Charis Tsevis studied visual design and advertising in Athens, Greece and Milan, Italy and his is mainly known for his work in digital mosaics, high complexity illustrations and neo- futuristic compositions. He is collaborating with the major media and the multinational advertising agencies creating illustration and digital art for global campaigns, political and sports events. He is particularly known for his mosaic portraits for Steve Jobs, Barack Obama and for his artwork for the USA House in the Rio Olympics, the Delta Air Lines Sky Club SFO mosaic and the Yahoo coverage of the London Olympics.  Early life and education  Born in Athens in 1967, Charis Tsevis has always been obsessed with visual arts. He was especially obsessed with magazines. He was creating his own magazines since the age of 5, that he was selling to his family. In the same age, he discovered his love for complexity. He often narrates in interviews that his myopia led him to pay special attention to complexity as he had to move his eyes very close to objects. Trying to see better he has experimented with big zoom outs using photographic equipment and he fell in love with the complex systems hidden in surfaces. He attended a Greek-German elementary school, a Greek-French high school and he has been accepted in the University of Athens majoring German Language and Literature. Parallel to his University studies Charis Tsevis frequented a Greek-German college of Graphic Design and Advertising in Athens called Deutsche H√∂here Lehranstalt f√ºr Grafik und Werbung Athen. After receiving his Diploma from this college, accredited by the Akademie f√ºr das Graphische Gewerbe M√ºnchen, Tsevis flew to Milan when he frequented the Visual Design course and the Master in Visual Design course at the Scuola Politecnica di Design, a school with a long and strong relationship with Gestalt psychology. Charis Tsevis acknowledges that he has found in Gestalt the solid ground on which he could base his artwork.  1990s - 2000s: Graphic design, education and publications  Returning in Athens after Milan Charis Tsevis works initially for ‚ÄúTa Nea Ton Grafikon Techno‚Äù (Graphic Art News) a monthly publication that had a big influence on the Greek design scene. He left the magazine in 1997 and found his own studio serving Greek clients especially books publishers and media houses. Charis Tsevis was also dedicating a good part of his life in education. He started teaching in Intergraphics College of Computer Graphics in Athens in 1995 and he presented seminars in the Panteion University of Athens for Gestalt psychology and design. In 1996 he has been accepted as a full-time professor at AKTO College, the biggest private art institute in Greece. At AKTO Charis Tsevis stayed for 18 years teaching Editorial design and typography. For 3 years he served as the vice head of the Graphic Design department. Parallel to his academic career Charis Tsevis became known in Greece for his frequent publication in the major design magazines of his country. He has written articles for DeltaD/+Design and Publish magazines in the design market and he held a monthly presence for 10 years in RAM magazine (best selling Greek computer publication of that time) where he was writing about computer history and cyberculture  2000s - Present: The mosaics  Tsevis is experimenting with digital mosaics since the early 90s. It was the influence of cyberculture with genres like ASCII Art, ANSI/Pixel Art and text art that influenced him as well as the teachings of Gestalt psychology and especially the influence of it on Op Art and Illusive art. Charis used the theories of Perspective Space by Nino Di Salvatore, founder of the Scuola Politecnica of Design, in mosaics. He had the innovative idea of introducing variable sizes in digital mosaics in order to give a more three-dimensional atmosphere in them. Instead of basing the mosaic in a rectangular grid with same sized tesserae his mosaics are using small images where the subject of the mosaic needs more detail and bigger images where no detail is needed. For instance, in a portrait, Charis Tsevis was the first using very small sizes for the characteristics like the eyes, the lips or the nose and bigger ones for the chicks or the neck. Tsevis combined the work in digital mosaics with the studies in computer history and created a series of mosaic artworks showing some of the biggest names of the IT world. Especially his series of Steve Jobs mosaic portraits gave him world recognition after the use of his work from Fortune magazine in 2009. The mosaic portrait that has illustrated an article in that magazine have been republished in hundreds of world media and became a viral success the late 2000s and gave him world fame especially after Steve Jobs‚Äô death in 2011. Charis Tsevis continued evolving his techniques and to do so he used influences from ethnic traditions and folklore. Today Charis Tsevis lives in Paphos, Cyprus and focuses more on fine art.

In Munich he studied mathematics under, among others, Oskar Perron and Constantin Carath√©odory. In 1933, as a so-called \\"half-Jew\\" in the terminology of the new National Socialist government of Germany, he sought to emigrate to the Soviet Union. From 1934 to 1937 he worked as a theoretical physicist in the University of Dnipro (then Dnipropetrovsk). In 1938 he went, via the Institute for Astrophysics in Prague, to Norway, where he became an assistant to Egil Hylleraas at the University of Oslo. He also briefly worked at the Technical University of Trondheim with Johan Holtsmark, who was building a Van de Graaff generator there. With the German occupation of Norway he fled to Uppsala in Sweden. In 1941 the Nazi German state stripped him of his German citizenship, and in 1943 recognition of his doctorate was revoked. He became a Norwegian citizen in 1947.B. Owren, Kongelige Norske Videnskapers Selskap Skrifter 4, 149-155 (2011).

The Seminole in the American Civil War were found in both the Trans-Mississippi and Western Theaters. The Seminole Nation in the Trans-Mississippi Theater had split alliances with some fighting for the Union and others supporting the Confederacy. The Florida Seminole participated in some skirmishing in central Florida. They were likely at the Battle of Olustee in February 1864. Trans- Mississippi Theater In the Trans-Mississippi Theater, the Seminole Nation was led by John Jumper. Jumper's Seminole name was \\"Hemha Micco.\\" He was commissioned in the Confederacy as a major, lieutenant colonel, and colonel.

Andrew E. Hodges, a white man who lived on the coast near Cedar Key, raised a company of Indian sharp shooters starting in 1862. Hodges' Company not only had Seminole Indians but whites, Hispanics, blacks, and other tribal members in his unit. Seminoles may have played a sharp shooter role at the Battle of Olustee. By July 1864, Hodges had passed his company to Andrew M. McBride. McBride was elected captain and wrote Secretary of War James A. Seddon that the company was ready for service. Hodges' Company At the opening of the Civil War, Andrew E. Hodges was living near Cedar Key, Florida. In 1862, he was part of a home guard that navigated the waterways and coasts. Later that year he raised a company of sharp shooters. McBride's Company McBride had mustered 65 individuals on July 7, 1864 at Everglades, Florida.

Although the current structure dates back to 1675, the original Herdings farm building was recorded as being present as early as the 13th-century. History The earliest mention of The Herdings comes from a grant from 1320 which mentions the name Thomas de Chaworth. On this deed we see two variations of the placename, first is Heytridding which appears to be the original name of the area, as well as Herdinge. The charter itself also mentions William and Robert de Heytridding. This grant shows that Thomas de Chaworth was giving land at Herdings to Alice, daughter of Agnetis Castelayn of Osberton and her daughter Rose. There are also a number of descriptions and sketches of The Herdings from the 19th century, which depicts the building standing on a hill, covered with Ivy. A windmill also stood on the hill next to the farmstead however there appears to have been a lawsuit during the reign of Elizabeth I relating to the windmill and it was removed long before the turn of the 20th-century. Local families A number of families have been associated with The Herdings, In 1560 William Staniforth has a baptism record at the nearby St James, Norton church with his father being recorded as Henry Staniforth (Henrici Stannyforthe) husbandsman of Heardynges. This same Henry Staniforth has a burial record at the same church in 1575.Norton Parish Records Following Henry's death it appears the farm was taken over by the Rollinson or Rawlinson family. Robert has a baptism at St. James dated 12 April 1582 and is described as being the son of Jerome Rawlinson of Herdings. The woodland area to the north of the farm was known as Rollinson Wood. In a deed written in 1622 Robert Rollinson leaves all land tithes, hay, wool etc. to John Bullocke of Darleighe (Darley Dale).Chantrey Land: Being an Account of the North Derbyshire Village of Norton by Harold Armitage In 1653 Andrew Scriven, churchwarden was residing at The Herdings with his children Ann, William and Sarah. William would become well known in the village for his help with the poor, and upon his death he would leave money for children's education as well as clothing for the poor. The Hazard family also resided at The Herdings for some time, Mr T.O. Hazard was born at the farm and lived there until his death. The farm also went back into the possession of the Staniforth family during the 19th century, with Thomas Staniforth, born in 1805 living with his wife Ann (nee Hutchinson). He died in 1879.

His schools, famine relief centers, and medical service transformed care in the region. Born and raised in Easington in County Durham, England, Thompson attended the College of Islington for brief medical training and was later accepted as a missionary by the Church Mission Society. He was deployed to Kherwara, India, where he spent nearly 20 years living and working, ultimately dedicating his life to the plight of the Bhils. As a doctor, teacher, reverend and philanthropist, Thompson worked to treat cholera, leprosy, the Bubonic plague, ophthalmia, malaria, rheumatism and fever. During his medical missionary career, Thompson laid the foundation for later medical missions in the Bhil region by establishing primary schools, dispensaries, relief centers and orphanages, pioneering Christianity to the Bhils, and training several Bhils in medicine. Besides his medical work, Thompson was also interested in diminishing the communication gap between the Bhils and the Europeans, which eventually led him to publish the first grammar and vocabulary book in the Bhili language as well as a prayer book.  Early Life (1851-1880)  Reverend Charles Stewart Thompson was born on 17 August 1851, in Easington in County Durham, England, as the fourth of six children. Thompson grew up in a middle class environment. His father, George Thompson, was a farmer, and his mother, Elizabeth Thompson, was a stay-at-home mother. His family was in the evangelical wing of the Anglican Church and attended their local village church, the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, on Sundays. After three years of training at the College of Islington in London, he was accepted as a missionary by the Church Mission Society (CMS). In June 1880, he was ordained as a deacon and in October 1880, he was ordained as a priest. Thompson was not married when he left for the Bhil mission and never married.  Medical Work   Call to Action and Preparation  In 1880, then age 29, Charles Stewart Thompson left England in response to an urgent invitation from Bishop Edward Bickersteth, the Vicar of Christ Church, Hempstead, at the time. An urgent request from Mrs. Rundall, daughter of Bishop Bickersteth, had been sent for a missionary after Rundall saw the poor conditions of the Bhils. With a ¬£1000 donation from Bishop Bickersteth, Thompson was sent by the Church Mission Society (CMS) of England to head a new missionary station in Kherwara. He first stayed in Udaipur under Dr. James Shepard of the Rajputana Presbyterian Mission in order to learn Hindi, and a year later, moved to Kherwara, a small village in Rajasthan 80 kilometers south of Udaipur, on 27 November 1880 to officially begin his mission.  Pioneering the Medical Missionary  Charles Thompson's mission was to establish the first Anglican mission to the Bhils, a \\"primitive tribe\\" inhabiting this Indian region. However, he soon learned that this would be no easy task. The relationship between the already present British doctors there and the Bhils was quite poor. When the British had arrived, they had introduced a new system of medicine known as \\"Angreji Dawa\\" (English medicine) to the Bhils. They had believed that the Bhil's primitive beliefs in regard to health and healing would disappear once they realized the superiority of English medicine. However, the Bhils continued to strongly support their beliefs in the supernatural origins of disease. The Bhils perceived surgery as attempted murder‚Äîone of the British army doctors was so desperate to have patients that he offered financial compensation to induce Bhils to come to his practice and resorted to carrying out operations without proper consent. Word quickly spread of how English doctors were violating the bodies and lives (physical and spiritual) of the Bhils, and this led to a complete loss of trust in Europeans and rejection of English medicine. Thompson had planned to use his medical work as a way of connecting with the Bhils in order to further his religious message. He had taken rudimentary medical training in England and in his time in Udaipur, he had observed Dr. James Shepard in his medical work just for this purpose. This clearly did not go to plan, as he was viewed with similar suspicions from the Bhils. When he went into the village, the Bhils hid and fled out of fear. In addition to this lack of trust in European medicine, a major Bhil revolt occurred in March 1881 due to census operations being carried out, making Thompson's mission even more difficult to carry out. The Bhils saw the counting of their people as a bad omen, understanding that this counting would open the door to greater surveillance and control, which also implied higher taxes. In response to this revolt, the army of Mewar marched through the rebellious villages and slaughtered the Bhils and burned their homes down, worsening the reputation of the Europeans to the Bhils. However, Thompson was not easily deferred. On 7 November 1881, a Bhil approached Thompson in his bungalow, asking for treatment for his deafness. The next day, Thompson visited a nearby Bhil village. It was not easy convincing the Bhils to allow him to treat them because at first, they refused to come anywhere near Thompson. But his breakthrough occurred when a helped named Masih Charan joined Thompson and acted as his interpreter. Charan and Thompson decided to focus on Obri, a village 5 kilometers from Kherwara. Every day, they would set up a makeshift clinic under a shady tree and this proved successful. News spread of how Thompson's remedies were effective, and soon Thompson was visiting every village within a 7 kilometer radius of Kherwara. He would start his day at 7 in the morning and end it in the evening. His plan of using medicine to connect with the Bhils was a success. For 16 years, until 1896, he traveled, often alone, to villages and treated the Bhils' complaints on the spot. Thompson did not record the number of patients that he treated or their specific afflictions \\"for fear of raising silly suspicions in the Bheel‚Äôs dark mind\\" that he was trying to injure or perform rituals on them. Throughout his travels, Thompson established several hospitals and dispensaries‚Äînotable ones being those in Kherwara and Lusadiya. Here, Thompson did what no other doctor had accomplished before him: he set the scene for a new kind of British doctor, the medical missionary, and opened the Bhils' eyes to the benefits of \\"Agreji Dawa (English medicine).\\"  Educational Work  Thompson established 12 schools in total. He raised money amongst the local native noblemen in order to establish two mission schools in Kherwara, eight outstations northeast of Kherwara (some of which were a rest-house and schoolhouse in Bilaria, a two-roomed house and schoolhouse in Lusaria, a rest- house and schoolhouse in Kotra), a school in Lusadia and a school in Biladiya. Thompson also published the first grammar and vocabulary book, Rudiments of the Bhili Language (1895), in the Bhil dialect.  Work in and near Kherwara  Thompson's first establishments were in Kherwara. He had collected material to build a school and dispensary there. The mission school was initially run by a catechist, Masih Charan, the same interpreter who helped Thompson make his breakthrough in Obri. Of the 7 Bhil pupils that were the school's first students, 3 dropped out. However, the remaining four went on to become very promising. One became the schoolmaster and the second Thompson's medical assistant. This second pupil, a young man, sometimes accompanied Thompson on his travels to Bhil villages. Initially illiterate, the young man not only learned medicine, but also was able to learn enough to read the New Testament. The third pupil became Thompson's house servant and the last became the mission errand runner. Thompson's mission school grew when other young Bhils joined, hearing about the success of the first pupils. The school received R.s. 2.8.0 a month for food and clothing. To accompany this mission school, Thompson also opened a school for girls. By the end of 1884, Thompson established 8 more outstations, north east of Kherwara. In November 1884, Reverend G. Litchfield, deployed by the Church Mission Society to the Bhil mission after seeing Thompson's success, arrived and handled Thompson's work in Kherwara and the outstations, as Thompson traveled south and west, hoping to expand and open outstations there. In 1886, Litchfield stated that four to five hundred Bhils came each month for medical treatment. Under Thompson's guidance, Litchfield improved the infrastructure in Kherwara by building a new dispensary, a schoolhouse and a home for the Christian master and the twenty Bhil men who would be trained to run schools and dispense medicine at the outstations. By 1899, there were seven Bhil masters and assistant masters working in the mission schools.  Work in Lusadiya  Thompson focused on the village of Lusadiya in particular, feeling that the Bhils there would be more open to the message of Christianity. In May 1886, Thompson arrived in Lusadiya. According to an interview with Surjibhai Timothibhai Suvera in Lucidia, Christians in Lusadiya can still remember when Thompson arrived and pitched his tent under a large banyan tree. Surjibhai's grandfather was a convert of Thompson's. By December, Thompson had established a school building and hospital in Lusadiya. 45 young boys were registered to attend the school. The Lusadiya mission school was a success. When the chief minister of Idar visited, he was greatly impressed by the schoolmaster and the Bhil pupils. He was amazed by the pronunciation, accents and fluency of the young scholars. The minister even suggested that Thompson open a school for girls.  Work in Biladiya  In April 1887, Thompson established a school, dispensary and mission house in the village of Biladiya. Evangelical Efforts Reverend Charles Stewart Thompson held strong beliefs in individual conversion. He advocated personal faith, moral self cleansing, and Bible study. Before accepting anyone as a convert, he had very strict criteria and tests the would-be convert needed to pass before baptism. First, they needed to prove that they conformed to the social and cultural values of the missionaries. For example, males promised to never have more than one wife. They had to agree to accept European medicine and renounce their previous beliefs in Bhil treatment. The would-be convert also needed to prove that they were self- sufficient. This way, any Bhils who wanted to convert simply for food or a job were eliminated. These tough demands meant that it would be many years until Thompson baptized his first Bhil.  Conversions  In 1882, Charles Stewart Thompson began to translate the Gospel for the Bhils, in order to help them understand the Christian message. It was said that many of his Bhil pupils in his mission schools were Christian at heart. However, none had the courage to be baptized, fearing social ostracism. Charles Stewart Thompson achieved his first convert on 15 December 1889, almost a decade after his arrival. The first converts were an older man named Sukha Damor, his wife Hirki, and their four children. Sukha had accompanied Thompson on a few of his tours and had actually helped Thompson make his initial contact with the Kherwara villages back in November 1881. Sukha had been told by his fellow Bhils and friends that if he converted, he would be disowned, but he was firm in his Christian beliefs and sought baptism anyway. After Sukha's baptism, others soon followed. Another notable convert was Premji Hurji Patel, who was in fact a pupil at one of Thompson's mission schools in Kherwara. His family strongly objected his conversion and even tried to poison him. Premji was baptized in 1890 and became a lay preacher of the Bhil mission. By 1895, Thompson had converted 24 Bhils. Eventually, he pioneered Christianity in the Sabarkantha district, in Lusadiya, Biladiya, Ghoradar, Sarasu, Kotra and Baulia.  Chappania Famine (1899-1900) Relief   Furlough  After fifteen and a half years of service, Thompson took furlough in 1896. While in England, he desperately attempted to persuade the Church Mission Society to send more doctors and nurses to the mission. He claimed that thousands of Bhils were dying in need of medical aid. > ‚ÄúNowhere, perhaps, in the world would a healing hand touch a greater sore.‚Äù > ‚Äî Charles Stewart Thompson to the Church Mission Society  Thompson's Return to India  Thompson returned from Britain to India in November 1899 once he heard about the terrible Chappania Famine afflicting the Bhils region. He volunteered to take on the task of famine-relief and ultimately laid down his life to that cause. When Thompson returned, he found that the missionary who had been left in charge, Arthur Outram, was sick with malaria and the authorities of the Mewar state had provided close to no relief for the famine. Thompson took matters into his own hands. He ordered sheds to be built to house the Bhils, started food kitchens, opened a girls‚Äô orphanage and ordered grain from Northern India. By December 1899, about 50 Bhils were under Thompson's care in Kherwara, most of which were children. Once he saw that the village of Kherwara was provided for, Thompson appointed Outram in charge and he toured other outstations in order to provide the same relief measures there. When he arrived at other villages, he found that many of the Bhil men had fled, leaving only women and children. He noted that everywhere he went, he was surrounded by masses of starving children. Memorial of Charles Stewart Thompson By mid-January, Thompson had set up seven relief centers, feeding over 700 Bhili children and some adults. The children were also attending the mission schools. For example, in Kotada, the mission school's population had increased from 3 to 51 in a few weeks. Thompson also opened an orphanage in Biladiya. He helped alleviate the Bhils of their starvation and disease by converting his primary day schools into relief centers. He also opened 6 children's kitchens that provided food for over 700 Bhili children and some adults. By April 1900, he had opened 15 relief centers in total and was feeding 5500 children, twice daily, that without his efforts would have been either dead or starving. He planned to open 5 more kitchens, which never occurred due to his untimely death. Thompson became a voice for the Bhils, demanding relief and government aid on their behalf.  Death  Charles Stewart Thompson died at age 48 on 19 May 1900, during his efforts to relieve the famine-stricken Bhils from their suffering. He had fallen ill from cholera and in an effort to get him to European aid, Bhil people carried Thompson for 9 hours on the road to Kherwara. He passed away under a tree at noon and was buried at Kanbai, 12 miles from Kherwara. Legacy Charles Stewart Thompson's death, while tragic, became a source of inspiration for the Bhil mission. He was acclaimed as the founding father who had laid down his life for the salvation of the Bhil. Inspired by Thompson's self-sacrifice, many volunteers came forward to help with the Bhil mission. Reverend E. P. Herbert, who had replaced Thompson during his furlough, returned once more. Mr. J.C. Harrison of the Gond Mission also volunteered to take up the task of famine relief. Four clergymen and A.H. Bull, a female missionary who eventually ran the girl's orphanage in Kherwara, offered their services as well. In addition to his 12 elementary schools, dispensaries, relief centers and orphanages, there now exists a school named in Thompson's memory, The Thompson Memorial School, in Kherwara.

Kerr was born in Dunkinsville, Ohio and graduated from Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia. He arrived in Canton in May 1854 with his wife to run the Huiji Dispensary of the Presbyterian Mission and the Canton Hospital (1855); Kerr served as superintendent of the hospital for 45 years. In 1859, Kerr opened Boji (boji meaning spreading benevolence) Hospital, located in Zhengsha Street in a southern suburb of Canton. In 1860, Kerr opened of the second dispensary in Foshan, later becoming the largest hospital in the city, In 1899, Kerr opened the first mental hospital in China. During his time in Canton, Kerr treated 39,440 inpatients and 740,324 outpatients from 4,000 villages.  Early life  John Glasgow Kerr was born on November 30, 1824. After his father's death, Kerr moved to Virginia to live with his uncle. In 1840, he started college in Granville, Ohio. Kerr studied medicine at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia and graduated in 1847. He married Miss Abby Kingsbury before leaving to become a medical missionary in China.  Career  440x440px  Mission  Kerr believed that medical missionaries should influence political and social reforms. \\"To introduce these institutions into lands where they do not exist is an important part of the duty of medical missionaries.\\" (Kerr, 1895, p. 11)Szto, P.

Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/305507743 Kerr regarded physicians as powerful and in a position of honor with the obligation to others because medicine is \\"a profession of benevolence.\\" (Xu, 2011, p. 195). Kerr also believed that American general practitioners needed to persuade the Chinese to abandon what was described as outdated and \\"hostile\\" customs in order to adopt Western culture and the natural laws. Kerr advocated free medical services for Chinese patients because he felt fees interfered with the healing of the sick and the spirit of Christianity. = Hospitals =  Ophthalmic Hospital  Dr. Peter Parker established the Ophthalmic Hospital in Canton on November 4, 1835. After a few months, the hospital expanded to hold more than 200 people. The hospital performed the first ophthalmological surgery, the first ovariotomy, the first lithocystotomy, the first etherization, and the first pathological anatomy in China. The hospital also had China‚Äôs first X-ray film shot and the first medical magazine printed. The Ophthalmic Hospital was later called the Boji Hospital. Kerr opened a Vaccine Department at the hospital in 1859, offering free smallpox vaccinations to Cantonese children. Kerr also published informational pamphlets on the importance of vaccinations.  Medical Missionary Society's Hospital  The Medical Missionary Society's Hospital was located on the Pearl River on Yan-tsai Street in Canton. It included 10 buildings and 300 patient beds. The hospital was managed and funded by the Medical Missionary Society.. Parker opened the Medical Missionary Society's Hospital in 1839 and was succeeded by John Kerr as physician in charge.  Mental hospital  Kerr retired from the Canton Hospital in 1899 to devote his time to caring for the mentally ill. In China, it was public custom to treat for the person as a whole, including mental syndromes. The most common treatments in 19th century China included: shackles, fetters, herb medicines, acupuncture, toxin liquid therapy, and magic words or formulas. In 1872, Kerr appealed to the Medical Missionary Society to build a mental hospital in China. Between 1876 and 1880, Kerr campaigned for the necessary and rightful treatment of patients with mental illnesses in their own, designated hospitals. Kerr believed in treating and curing the mentally ill rather than isolating them from society. However, neither the city government or the Canton Medical Missionary Society wanted to fund a mental hospital. Kerr used his own money to purchase 17 acres in Fangcun (southwestern Canton) as a building site for the hospital. With donors and assistance, two buildings were erected . He attended to 50 patients at the hospital before his deathref name=\\":1\\" /> = Surgery and Hygiene = In Canton, Kerr performed around 48,918 surgeries; his specialty being lithotomy and lithotrity, the removal of gallstones from the urinary tract, bladder or kidney. He performed surgery on both civilians and officials throughout the Guangxi Province. The Canton Hospital was one of the first hospitals in China to practice preventive hygienic measures such as separation, disinfection, and sterilization. Kerr helped to introduce these modern techniques during his surgeries and strived for his hospital to be a model of cleanliness for the Cantonese not only in the hospital, but in their private lives as well. There were separate rooms for patients with contagious diseases and the patient's clothes and utensils were sterilized, along with the operating room itself. In 1875, Kerr published Weisheng yaozhi (Essentials to Hygiene) which highlighted the priority of preventing illnesses through good hygiene. In this novel, Kerr also argued that hygiene was not just an individual problem, a large-scale attempt to undermine unhygienic habits and lifestyles required government regulations and law enforcement as well. = Anti-Opium Campaign = Dr. Kerr played a crucial role in condemning opium abuse in Canton. He published Opium Habits in 1889, in which he denounced opium smoking and declared distorted moral character a product of opium. Kerr opened up a ward of the Canton Hospital dedicated to treating patients (ages ranging 20‚Äì59 years) who were addicted to opium. He also attended the National Missionary Conference in Shanghai (1890), a forum in opposition of the opium trade. Following the conference, the Permanent Committee for the Promotion of Anti-Opium Societies was established and Kerr became a leading member.Lodwick, Kathleen L. Crusaders Against Opium: Protestant Missionaries in China 1874-1917 (University Press of Kentucky) Online version at Google Books The Committee resolved to continue their opposition to the opium traffic, urging Christians in China to arouse public opinion against it. The desire of the missionaries that their ideas be carried out caused them to form ‚Äúcontinuation committees‚Äù that were assigned tasks to assure that action would be taken on whatever matters had been approved by the conferences. = Medical Journals = Kerr promoted medical education in China for both men and women. He taught many Chinese medical students and translated over 34 volumes of medical work into Chinese. Some of these medical students were women who trained in the Canton Hospital medical classes (1879-1899). Kerr was also elected as the first president of the CMMA (China Medical Missionary Association) in 1886 and served as the first editor of China Medical Missionary Journal. In 1886, Kerr established Guangzhou Xinbao (Canton's New Newspaper) and Xiyi xinbao (Western Healing News). = Works =  Legacy  John Kerr Memorial Garden, Guangzhou (Grave of Dr. John Glasgow Kerr)Kerr died in Canton at age 77, after spending 47 years in that city.

A devout Christian born into a highly religious family, Paul received her B.Sc. in zoology from Women's Christian College in Madras and completed her MBBS in pediatrics from Kilpauk Medical College. Paul was inspired to conduct missionary work after reading the biography of Albert Schweitzer and began her missionary career after marrying RAC Paul in 1972. The couple worked with the Indian Missionary Society in the villages of Malkangiri, India before joining the Indian Evangelical Mission to gain support for their work with the tribal Bondo people. Paul helped treated various diseases, including tuberculosis, malaria, and dysentery. She conducted research particularly in tuberculosis and became a fellow of the India National College of Chest Physicians in 1986. After the death of her husband, Paul continued her missionary work in Malkangiri, eventually founding the Reaching Hands Society in 1994. Paul was awarded the Yoke Fellow Award from the Direction Mission Aid Society for her development work among the Adivasis people, as well as the Robert Pierce Award by World Vision International for her Christian development work.  Early life and education  Iris Grace Rajakumari Walter was born in 1945 in Tamil Nadu, India. The oldest child of four, she and her siblings enjoyed a comfortable childhood in an affluent family. Her father was the Chief Engineer at the Tamil Nadu Public Works Department and moved his family around frequently, including to Tamil Nadu, Chennai, and Delhi, where Iris learned to speak Hindi. As a child, Paul was described as rebellious, headstrong, and boisterous, despite the expectations imposed on her by her parents and the rest of society. Paul grew up in a Christian family and was deeply influenced by her parent's commitment to their religion. During her time at the Women's Christian College, Paul was involved in the Union of Evangelical Studies of India (ESI). After completing her courses in junior college, Paul applied for medical colleges and B.Sc. courses in biology and zoology. Having not received acceptances from any of her medical colleges, she decided to join the B.Sc. course in zoology at Women's Christian College in Madras and graduated in 1964. Afterwards, she pursued her interest in medicine and completed the first year of her MB.BS course at Fatima College, Madurai. She then continued the next six months at Madurai Medical College and finished her degree at Kilpauk Medical College in Madras, receiving a Gold Medal in pediatrics. In 1985, Paul attended the Indian Institute of Cross Cultural Communication in Nasik, IICCC, Manarasthra to learn about writing spoken language with the goal of write the New Testament in the Bondo Language. While working with the Bondos, she took a medical correspondence course from the Christian Medical College in Vellore. Paul also pursued advanced study in theology and received a Bachelor of Divinity from the Senate of Serampore University in 1990. Missionary work Paul worked as a house surgeon immediately after completing her MB.BS degree. She was initially inspired to conduct missionary work in Africa after reading the biography of Albert Schweitzer, but she later shifted her focus to medical and religious missionary work in India after recognizing the poverty of those living in the slums of India and how it contrasted with her life of privilege. Map of Orissa State, containing the Malkangiri district. Before their marriage, Iris was drawn to RAC Paul's dedication to Christian medical missionary work, and she began her missionary career accompanying and working alongside him. The pair started out working for the Indian Missionary Society (IMS) in the villages of Malkangiri in Orissa state. She used her medical knowledge to treat common diseases among the Adivasis people such as Malaria, Tuberculosis, skin diseases, and dysentery, as well as helping to deliver babies. After spending time with the Adivasis, the Pauls decided to work with the Bondo tribes, a relatively uncontacted group characterized by illiteracy, poverty, and high mortality. They set up a roadside clinic that Iris operated to treat Bondo villages visiting the local market. Paul spent much time treating tuberculosis among the Bondos and providing women's health care. The Pauls wanted to devote their work to the Bondos, whereas the IMS wanted to focus on the Adivasis people, and as a result, they left the IMS in 1973 and began to work for the Indian Evangelical Mission, who agreed to support them. After the death of RAC Paul, Iris returned to Malkangiri, where she focused on community development that combined evangelism with medical care and community empowerment. Paul formed a partnership with the Evangelical Fellowship of India Commission on Relief (EFICOR) to support her efforts to provide educational programs and services for the villages. Paul sent villagers to take courses at EFICOR on evangelism and teaching literacy to implement in their own communities. She built the St. Stephen's Church in Malkangiri and established several congregations for the Indian Missionary Society. Paul also conducted prison reform efforts for the Bondos. Beginning in 1995, Paul worked with EFICOR to drill a system of wells and pumps in Malkangiri; the team drilled a total of 300 wells within two years. As part of an effort to increase incomes and elevate the Bondos‚Äô socioeconomic status, Paul helped set up an irrigation system and channel the water from the mountains to increase the Bondos' agricultural productivity. She and the EFICOR Water Resource Management team led the construction of a dam at Gottenpalli, a region 75 kilometers south of Malkangiri. The success of the dam allowed Paul to set up wells in more villages. Paul's medical goals shifted from curing to preventing disease. She set up a team of people at EFICOR to vaccinate children against whooping cough, polio, diphtheria, and tetanus. The team vaccinated 8,640 children within 2 years, dropping the rate of polio from 10 to 0 percent in three years and significantly decreasing the rate of whooping cough. Paul also established plant nurseries in villages to improve nutrition. At Gottenpalli, she installed a hut staffed by a primary health worker to distribute basic medicines and treat minor illnesses. During this time, Paul founded St. Luke's Hospital in Malkangiri. Paul used her experience in Malkangiri to encourage young Indian Christian missionaries to reach out to their local populations and to other Indian tribes. In 1990, she was invited to speak at a conference of youth leaders held by the Evangelical Fellowship of India. From 1990 through 1992, she spoke at several other conferences for youth, helping to incite a growing interest in Indian Christian missionary work. In 1993, Paul founded Reaching Hands Society as an organization dedicated to reaching the villages of Malkangiri with Christianity. Reaching Hand Society works to provide medical care, immunizations, health education, literacy programs, water resource management, and prisoner rehabilitation programs in its target villages. Along with providing these services, the organization seeks to empower the local people through women's empowerment programs, legislative defense, and political education. Reaching Hand Society has since contacted over 700 out of the 926 villages in Malkangiri, increased the literacy rate in 120 villages from 0.4% to 40%, and established worship centers in over fifty villages and local prisons. It is currently run by Paul's son Remo Paul, Executive Director, and her daughter-in-law Susan Paul, Medical Superintendent.  Personal life  Iris Paul married RAC Paul on January 25, 1972 at Emanuel Methodist Church in Madras, Chennai after facing initial disapproval from her father for choosing a sickly man of low stature. During their marriage, she helped to take care of RAC Paul and nurse him throughout his ill health. The couple had two children of their own, Remo and Mano, and also raised two Bondo children as their own, whom they named David Livingstone and Mary Smrutha. After numerous hospitalizations and treatments over the next several years, RAC Paul died of kidney failure on September 30, 1986. Paul returned to Malkangiri, ignoring traditional Indian customs for widows and the advice of her friends and family for her to move back into her parents‚Äô home.  Awards and recognition  Paul became a Fellow of the College of Chest Physicians at Delhi University in 1986 for her research on tuberculosis. In 1988, she was presented with the Yoke Fellow Award from the Direct Mission Aid Society for her ‚Äúevangelic and holistic development work among the Adivasis.‚Äù In 1996, she was given the Robert Pierce International Award for Christian development work by World Vision International. Paul has said of her work, ‚ÄúMedicine is my life. It doesn‚Äôt feel like work. I can‚Äôt think of anything else I would rather do. It does not bother me when people call at odd hours.

Lehmann (12 January 1904 ‚Äì 15 April 1994) was a religious and medical missionary founded and built the Herbertpur Christian Hospital along with his wife Monica Lehmann, in the Herbertpur village, located in the Doon Valley in India in 1936. The hospital is now operated as the EHA Herbertpur Christian Hospital and includes the nursing school. The aim of his mission was to spread the Christian faith among a largely Hindu and Muslim population in Herbertpur and surrounding areas as well as to provide medical care and treatment at extremely cheap or no cost to the villagers. Lehmann was born in 1904 in London and attended prep school as a child. He later trained as an engineer from Oxford University, after which he pursued medicine from the same university. Lehmann specialized in ophthalmology and tropical medicine, but carried out a wide range of surgical and consultation treatments in the Herbertpur Hospital. He also served as the Chairman of Board of Governors at Wynberg Allen School.  Early Life  Lehmann was born on 12 January 1904 near the Alexandra Palace in London, England. His family resided on a farm near Sherwood in Nottinghamshire, where they raised chickens, ducks, turkeys, cows and more animals. As a child, Lehmann's parents tried to raise him with wholesome experiences, as he enjoyed many different past-times such as: watching the Queen's servants on the royal grounds, enjoying nature, and watching the family's chauffeur turn on their steam engines. Growing up, Lehmann was a member of England's Children's Special Service Mission, a youth evangelism group also referred to as CSSM. Lehmann took interest in the missionaries who frequented his childhood home. However, after a bad encounter with a Scandinavian worker, Lehmann decided that he no longer want to be a missionary. As a young boy, Lehmann believed in the Christian doctrine, but he did not like that parents tend to over-shelter their children from the world.  Education  Lehmann attended the Plymouth Brethren Primary School, a prep school which was operated by strict adherent of the Plymouth Brethren. Lehmann was sufficiently exposed to Christian teachings as part of his primary education. He trained as an engineer in the Oxford University and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in civil and mechanical engineering. He then trained in medicine from Liverpool University Medical School and travelled to the US to intern at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital to study with Dr. Chester Mayo. Lehmann practiced corneal grafting at Boston Hospital before returning to Liverpool to study tropical medicine.  Personal life  As the age of twelve, Lehmann met Monica Allen while on a holiday. They had become good friends, but Lehmann initially had no thought of marrying Monica, as she wanted to one day return to India as a missionary. When finishing up his doctorate education in engineering, Lehmann felt a sudden need of a spiritual refresher. He decided to attend the Keswick convention, where the speakers discussed the global need for medical missionaries. At the time, Lehmann felt like God was speaking to him and that this was his calling. When Lehmann came to this realization, he realized that he and Monica must have been destined to be with each other, as Monica dreamed of being a missionary from a young age. Lehmann and Monica had three daughters and one son. Their first child, Priscilla Ruth, was born in Kachhwa. Petronella Anna was born in March 1937, Donald in May 1940, and Susana Joan in December 1946. At a young age, both Priscilla and Petrinilla were sent to London as there were no school in Herbertpur to educate them.  Missionary work  On their arrival in India, Dr. Lehmann and his wife first worked in a hospital in Kachhwa. Lehmann worked in Kacchwa for 18 months where his daily routine included operations in the mornings and afternoon with routine check-ups in between and language study in the evening. In Kachhwa, the Lehmanns distributed Christian literature for a small fee. The Lehmanns established the Herbertpur Hospital in November 1936, in Herbertpur village, 25 miles away from Dehradun. The hospital became popular amongst locals in a short period of time and was visited by over 2000 people daily shortly after its opening. The hospital was mainly visited by low-income people from backward classes but catered to people from all socio- economic classes including Brahmins, farmers and merchants. By 1937, the Lehmanns built a larger building for the hospital and treated nearly 3000 patients a day along with their staff. During the second world war, the hospital was closed for nearly a year due to limitation of staff and because Dr. Lehmann was himself asked to serve in the war front. The hospital reopened in 1954, with two operating theaters, special eye wards, male and female general wards, midwifery and tuberculosis block and private rooms. Dr. Lehmann carried out treatments as complex as cataract removal surgery, appendectomy, and blood infection treatments at the Herbertpur Hospital. In addition to medical services, the hospital also exposed to patients to Christianity during their stay in the hospital. Gospel service was carried out daily in the hospital yard by the hospital's evangelist, Mr. Mall. Lehmann also often included himself in the service for he felt that his involvement would mean a lot to the patients and would help in strengthening their beliefs. Dr. Lehmann along with his wife also established a number of schools in the region. These also served as establishments for congregation. Dr. Lehmann also worked with the Evangelical Alliance Mission and served as the chairman on board of governors for the Wynberg Allen School. This school provided education to children form displaced Tibetan families living in the Himalayan valley.  Opposition  Throughout his time in India, Lehmann faced opposition for trying to convert Indians to Christianity. In general, there was a lack of enthusiasm about Christianity‚Äîeven from local Christians‚Äîas Indians did not like talking about the crucifixion. From time to time, the hospital and the school were able to influence locals to convert, however, when the villagers would return to their home, some inevitable turned away from Christianity due to the local opposition and resistance. Multiple parties pressured missionaries in India, such as the Arya Samahajhists, one of the more violent group of protesters. At one point, even the District Magistrate told Lehmann that they would close down his hospital if he continued to preach about Christianity, as he was considered to be taking advantage of those who needed medical help. Despite the opposition, Lehmann continued to preach and distributed Christian literature and films to connect with the people. Most medical evangelists gave full attention to their medical work and left missionary work for the local evangelists. However, Lehmann believed that paying attention to people's souls was just as important as healing them physically, and took a liking to the title \\"Missionary Medic.\\"  Legacy  The Herbertpur Hospital became a member of the Emmanuel Hospital Association (EHA) in 1973 and continues to serve patients across the Doon valley to this day. The Lehmanns established the Herbertpur Trust to encourage national evangelism programs. Dr. Geoffrey Lehmann's life and work were the subject of The Himalayan Heartbeat, a book written by Ken Anderson, which was published in 1965.

She became a lecturer at the International Centre for Eye Health (ICEH) and at the Swiss Tropical Institute. Motivated by her faith, she joined the Swiss Mission in South Africa and worked at the Elim Hospital. She made significant advances against malnutrition and trachoma. She practiced community mobilization and preventive healthcare through establishing a Care Group system. She wrote academic papers and books about her work. She was awarded an honorary doctorate degree by the University of Basel, and the 1984 Woman of the Year.  Early life  Erika Sutter was born in Basel, Switzerland on June 14, 1917 to Ernst Theodor Sutter and Meta (n√©e Ris). She had a sister Trudi. Her family had a second home in Troistorrents. She was homeschooled until third grade. From fourth grade, she enrolled in Basel girls' high school Gymnasium am Kohlenberg.https://public.ebookcentral.proquest.com/choice/publicfullrecord.aspx?p=1986826 In 1937, Sutter enrolled in University of Basel and majored in botany and zoology along with minors in geography and physics. She continued studying after her undergraduate years and completed a doctorate in plant physiology in 1952. She worked at the Institute of Botany during her student years. After considering a teaching career, she worked at Swiss pharmaceutical firm Hoffmann-La Roche in the animal physiology department. In 1948, she worked in the botany department at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Ultana, where she stayed for two years.  Missionary career  Sutter first heard about the Swiss Mission in South Africa from her friend Marie-Louise Martin, who was then working as a high school chaplain in Basel. She contacted the missionaries there to find out about the mission's work. Her plans were halted after the sudden deaths of her father and sister in 1945. Her interest in working for the Swiss Mission was reignited during her time in Sweden. Her encounters with missionaries there compelled her to pursue missionary work, and she left for South Africa in mid-April 1952.  Motivations  Although raised a devout Christian, Dr. Sutter did not see her commitment to missionary service as a religious calling, nor a means to fulfill her personal ambition. She explains in her biography that it was ‚Äúsimply her path‚Äù.  Achievements  From 1952 to 1984, Sutter worked at the Elim Hospital as a member of the staff and as an ophthalmologist for around twenty years. During that time, she was responsible for eye services and training of ophthalmic nurses in the hospital. She worked mostly in the Northern Transvaal regions and was involved extensively in preventive health care in the community through the Care Groups. To train to be an ophthalmologist, she returned to Switzerland to study ophthalmology and practice surgical procedures in the Basel Eye Hospital. She returned to the Elim Hospital in 1965 as a certified ophthalmologist. As the only doctor in the eye department, she treated trachoma and various other eye diseases. However, as the eye hospital expanded and more doctors assisted in eye treatments, Sutter was able to direct her focus on achieving other visions. Sutter had wanted to start a nursing school for eye care since she started working in South Africa, and in 1975, her dream was fulfilled when the South African Nursing Council officially recognized their new curriculum and approved the school. At the school, African nurses could be trained and receive an official diploma in ophthalmic nursing. That same year, she also established the Rivoni Society for the Blind, a rehabilitation center that offered workshops and training for the visually impaired and the blind. The society also offered a school for blind children where they could read Braille and learn how to use a typewriter.  Care Groups  In an effort to reduce cases of trachoma, an eye disease that is easily curable with the application of good hygienic practices, Sutter helped organize Care Groups with Selina Maphorogo, her translator and main motivator of the Care Groups. Care Groups aimed to mobilize local people, mostly women, to spread awareness to local communities about trachoma and how to prevent it. As a result of their efforts, the number of active trachoma cases was reduced by 50% within three years. Care Groups have helped spread awareness and address a wide range of problems such as HIV/AIDS and malnutrition in the region. The project quickly multiplied; by 2002, 10,000 women were working in 300 villages.  Works  One of Sutter‚Äôs most significant publications is Hanyane, a Village Struggles for Eye Health, an educational book that has been translated into many languages. The book goes into detail about effective preventive care and village development, and documents useful medical notes for ophthalmologists. Her work The Community is my University is a compilation of interviews with her and Selina Maphorogo. This book mainly focused on Care Groups and development aid.  Recognition  * Woman of the Year in 1984. * Honorary doctorate degree from the University of Basel for her work and accomplishments in South Africa in 1995. * Trachoma Gold Medal awarded by the French Ligue Internationale Contre le Trachome (1996). * Ophthalmological Society of South Africa (2005). Mamphela Ramphele, a South African politician and an activist against apartheid, praised Erika as a ‚Äúfellow global citizen, [who] not only opened the physical eyes of those she encountered but also their spiritual eyes, to appreciate the power they had within them.‚Äù  Retirement  Sutter retired in 1984 at 67 and returned to Basel, Switzerland. In her retirement, she spent most of her time traveling and giving presentations and teaching at the Swiss Tropical Institute in Basel and at the International Centre for Eye Health in England. Dr. Erika Sutter died in 2015 at age 98.

Adolph served the China Inland Mission, now OMF International, from 1929 to 1941 then served in the US Army Medical Corps as a Major from 1941 to 1945.U.S., Social Security Death Index, 1935-2014 Number: 362-20-2433; Issue State: Michigan; Issue Date: Before 1951 Adolph returned to China to serve one last time from 1946 to 1949. After returning to the United States in 1949, he worked preparing missionaries for overseas work and restoring their health after contracting diseases. Once retired, Adolph served at his sons' hospitals in central Ethiopia and Bangladesh. Adolph opened two hospitals in Luan, Shansi and in Kaifeng, Henan and played a key role in the negotiations with Japanese military that kept hospitals open to Chinese populations during the Sino-Japanese war.  Early life and education  Paul Adolph was born as the second son to Willhelma and William Adolph on August 4, 1901 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was younger brother to Edward (1895-1986) and William (1890-1958).The National Archives at Washington, D.C.; Washington, D.C.; Passenger Lists of Vessels Arriving at San Francisco, California; NAI Number: 4498993; Record Group Title: Records of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 1787-2004; Record Group Number: 8 Adolph was raised to speak German by his father who had been an engraver in the black forest of Germany. He attended Central High School in Philadelphia and graduated in 1919 speaking English, German, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew. Adolph began his undergraduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania but transferred to Wheaton College, where he graduated from in 1924 with a B.S. in chemistry and a B.A. in Greek. Adolph studied medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine where he attempted to master as many specialties as he could in anticipation of not having specialists in the missionary field. When Adolph became sick with Tuberculosis at the end of his last year, the school awarded him his M.D. in 1927 despite him being sent to recover at Edward Livingston Trudeau's tuberculosis sanatorium in New York. While at the sanatorium, he recovered and eventually joined the medical staff, taking on responsibilities in patient care.  Medical work  Adolph left the United States for China with the China Inland Mission for the first time in 1929. When he arrived in Beijing, then Peiking, he was able to visit his brother who was a professor of biochemistry in Beijing. Shanxi, a province in northern China Upon arrival in China, Adolph was first to spend six months at a language school in the Anhui province studying the Chinese language. After the six months, he proceeded to his residency at a hospital in Linfen in the province of Shanxi. Following a year of residency, Adolph was directed to open a 100-bed hospital in Luan, now Changzhi, in southeastern Shanxi. The missionaries that had previously worked in this region were no longer there as they had fled during the Boxer Rebellion. At the hospital in Changzhi, Adolph was the only doctor and carried out mostly surgical procedures. Initially, Adolph was received apprehensively in Luan and often called \\"foreign devil\\" by the children. He and his team made many efforts to integrate, such as wearing traditional Chinese clothing instead of American clothes. Patients at the hospital came from as far as 50 miles carried, walking, by wheelbarrow, or by cart. In his book, Surgery Speaks to China, Adolph recounts having to treat many cases of tuberculosis due to the unsanitary living conditions. Many times patients came with illnesses that had progressed beyond treatment and amputations were necessary. In these cases, the hospital had a carpenter on staff to build wooden legs. Adolph also reports many surgical cases to correct deformities, such as \\"hare-lip\\", or cleft palate. One of the goals of Adolph while in China was to improve sanitation among midwives as they were the primary means of delivering babies throughout the region. He did so by observing deliveries with midwives and advising other midwives to practice already present, more sanitary methods such as burning the umbilical chord to sever it instead of using an unsanitary tool. He also attempted to mend the sanitation issue by providing bathtubs at the hospital for patients and the public to use, as bathing was not a priority throughout the community. This combined with propaganda and example, especially using Adolph's infant son, proved to be effective. Adolph also made arrangements with poor patients to facilitate their care including providing housing until complete recovery and low, fixed costs. While in Changzhi, he would tour the province with his wife, son, a small medical team, and equipment in donated cars to treat people in rural areas. Clinics and operating theatres were set up in tents and many surgeries were able to be performed. In spring of 1936, after the birth of his second son, Adolph returned to the United States where he took a year of graduate courses at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. After this and a course in general surgery, Adolph stayed to participate in research on sulfanilamide. Hebei, a province in northern China In November 1937, Adolph returned to China and worked in Shunteh (Xingtai), Hebei because his return to Changzhi was delayed by the fighting of the Sino-Japanese war. Upon his return, Adolph practiced mostly war medicine and extensively used the delimiting tourniquet. He later published a paper on the use of the delimiting tourniquet in wartime in China and accredits many survivals to its use. In September, 1938 he was able to return to Changzhi but without his family. That winter, Adolph traveled to Liaochao to partner with the Red Cross in opening a hospital that needed a doctor. In 1939 a reoccurrence of tuberculosis caused Adolph to have to return to his family in Chefoo, now Yantai, for a five-month rest period. After this rest period, Adolph began his journey back to Changzhi. Before arriving to Changzhi he received news they had been overtaken by Japanese forces and went to work at a hospital in Kaifeng instead. Here, he was free to practice as long as he cooperated with both Japanese and Chinese troops. Adolph continued to practice here until he returned to the United States in 1941. When in the United States, Adolph practiced in industrial surgery in Detroit for six months and nine months as an associate to another surgeon in private practice before being commissioned to the Army Medical Corps. Major Adolph served in Scotland, France, and England as a US Army Surgeon before being stationed at Fort Sheridan as Chief of Surgery in 1943. After a year at Fort Sheridan, Adolph was once again stationed in England and served as a Chief of Surgical Service at a general hospital. Major Adolph then served as a supervisor to eight German prisoner of war hospitals in France. The hospitals were for German patients and had German doctors, but were overseen by Americans. In a letter, Adolph reported that \\"Nazism has hindered the progress in the medical field\\" and new methods frequently had to be taught to the German doctors. In August 1946, Adolph and his family had returned to Shanghai to continue working with the China Inland Mission. He became the school physician for the Shanghai American School, a professor of surgery at the St. Johns Medical School, the director of the China Inland Mission's medical work in China, and the operator of a hospital in Shanghai. He also worked in a clinic for the poor operated in front of his own compound. Upon return to the United States, Adolph practiced in Kentucky before being debilitated by a stroke and a third occurrence of tuberculosis in 1950. For twenty years Adolph continued his involvement in the medical mission community in Chicago by preparing missionaries for working overseas and keeping them healthy after having contracted diseases abroad. After retirement, Adolph practiced at his son Harold's mission hospital in Ethiopia and his son Robert's mission hospital in Bangladesh.  Personal life  Adolph married Vivian A. Adolph in June 1931 in Beijing and they honeymooned together in a nearby mountain range before being forced to evacuate due to war violence. They had two sons, Robert (b. 12/14/1935) and Harold (b. 12/11/1932), who followed in their father's footsteps and entered the mission field as doctors.The National Archives at Washington, D.C.; Washington, D.C.; Passenger Lists of Vessels Arriving at San Francisco, California; NAI Number: 4498993; Record Group Title: Records of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 1787-2004; Record Group Number: 8 While serving in China, Adolph was curious of the history of Shen Nung, the father of Chinese medicine and the divine husbandman.

Later life and death  Toward the end of his career, Adolph spent time advising the China Inland Mission and working with his sons in the mission field. He accompanied his sons to sites in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, where they established hospitals. While working in Ethiopia, Adolph died at the age of 70 in June 1972.Oral History Interview with Harold P. Adolph  Legacy  Adolph established the Sixth People's Hospital of Shanghai through his work with the China Inland Mission. Initially with only 100 beds, the Sixth People's Hospital is now 1,650-bed modern teaching hospital. While working in China during wartime, Adolph was responsible for negotiating with both sides to continue providing medical care to communities caught in the middle of the fighting. Adolph also helped communities. He also assisted in founding his sons' hospitals in Bangladesh under the Sudan Interior Mission and southern Ethiopia. In 1959 Adolph was awarded the Distinguished Service to Society Award by Wheaton College, his alma mater.

His research shifted the role of medical missionaries from agents of religion to agents of health care, leading to the twentieth century model of medical missionaries.  Early life  Lankester was born in Elm Park Gardens, London, England and lived most of his life in England. It is unknown whether he had any formal education. Though his parents had no medical background, he grew up studying medicine on his own. It is believed that some member(s) of his family became ill, which influenced his interest. In early childhood, his mother battled multiple chronic diseases. Lankester wanted to help his mother get healthy. It is believed that she died while he was in his early teens and that he was brought up by his father. Without any siblings, most of Lankester's time was spent studying medicine.  Missionary call  Lankester served as a leader for the Church Missionary Society examining board in addition to his role as a secretary. He retired in 1926 after serving there for 30 years During this period, he served as Secretary of the Auxiliary Committee on Medical Missions, Society Physician, Home Secretary and General Secretary. He published numerous papers as the Honorary Secretary of Committee. In Occasional Paper 1, Lankester wrote an Appeal to the Medical Mission Auxiliary Fund Committee. Lankester worked as a researcher. He enjoyed reading and studying why people became ill. He read every book of medicine that was available at the time.  His work  Lankester was thoroughly involved with researching health care. He was especially interested in seeing how to better supply medicine to those who needed it around the world. As a long time London resident, Lankester focused his work on rural England. According to records, he supplied medical aid to the London countryside. He set up a tent on the side of one of the main roads outside a small village. He treated many different local people as well as people who traveled to seek his help. He had no real way of promoting his medical services beyond word of mouth. He treated people with a range of illnesses including smallpox, yellow fever, cholera, typhoid, polio and diphtheria. He started work in England and eventually branched out to other countries. Lankester apparently did not work closely with other medical missionaries, preferring to work independently. His greatest individual medical mission was a three-month stay in the London countryside.  Legacy  Lankester was one of the first and most trusted medical missionaries. Instead of clergymen traveling the countryside, he wanted public perception of medical missionaries to be heroes spreading health and the Gospel. Lankester traveled across London communicating about medical missionaries. He had trouble conveying what medical missionary work was. He is best known for the studying and research he conducted, as well as his supply of medicine and vaccines to those in the near-London countryside.  References   Sources  * Arumugam, Thiru.

He raced in Ireland, Britain, Germany, the United States, Japan, Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates in four seasons of racing, winning five of his twenty-one starts. His other major wins came in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at three and the Tattersalls Gold Cup at four. In addition to his wins he was placed in several major races including the Racing Post Trophy, Irish St. Leger, Prince of Wales's Stakes, Bayerisches Zuchtrennen, Irish Champion Stakes and Breeders' Cup Turf. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in the United States and Turkey. Background Powerscourt is a bay horse with a white blaze and three white socks bred in England by Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms. Before the start of his racing career the colt passed into the ownership of John Magnier's Coolmore Stud organisation and was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle. He raced in the ownership of Magnier's wife Susan. He was from the fifteenth crop of foals sired by Sadler's Wells, who won the Irish 2,000 Guineas, Eclipse Stakes and Irish Champion Stakes in 1984 and went on to be the Champion sire on fourteen occasions. Powerscourt's dam Rainbow Lake was a high-class racehorse who won three of her six races including the Lancashire Oaks. As a broodmare she produced Riposte (Sheepshead Bay Stakes) and Last Train (Prix de Barbeville) but had her biggest success with Kind the dam of Frankel and Noble Mission. Racing career 2002: two-year-old season On his racecourse debut Powerscourt started 5/4 favourite for a maiden race over seven furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 5 August, but despite finishing strongly he failed by a short head to overhaul his stablemate Macedonian King. He was then sent to England for a six furlong maiden at Newmarket Racecourse in October and finished second of the six runners behind the Henry Cecil- trained Lateen Sails. Later that month at Punchestown he won at the third attempt beating Latino Magic by a length despite swerving to the left in the closing stages. Nine days after his win at Punchestown, the colt was sent to England and moved up sharply in class for the Group 1 Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster. After racing in second place he took the lead in the straight but was overtaken inside the final furlong and finished second to his stablemate Brian Boru. 2003: three-year-old season Powerscourt had training problems and did not reappear until 29 June, when he started at odds of 12/1 for the Irish Derby and came home sixth of the nine runners, more than ten lengths behind the winner Alamshar. In July he was dropped in class and distance for a minor race over ten furlongs at Leopardstown and led from the start to win from the Jim Bolger-trained Napper Tandy. At York on 15 August contested the Great Voltigeur Stakes, a race which usually serves as a trial race for the St Leger and started at odds of 5/1 behind the Michael Stoute- trained Hawk Flyer. The other fancied runners included Brian Boru, High Accolade (King Edward VII Stakes), Dutch Gold (Chester Vase) and Delsarte (Newmarket Stakes). Ridden as in his two previous wins by Mick Kinane, he tracked the leaders before taking the lead in the straight and then rallied after being headed by Brian Boru to regain the advantage in the final strides and prevail by a neck. Powerscourt bypassed the St Leger on the 13 September (which was won by Brian Boru) and was aimed instead at the Irish equivalent which was run on the same day at the Curragh Racecourse. Racing against older horses for the first time he stayed on well in the straight to finish third behind Vinnie Roe and Gamut, with Bollin Eric back in fourth. 2004: four- year-old season Jamie Spencer took over from Kinane as Powerscourt's regular jockey for the 2004 season. The colt began his campaign in the Tattersalls Gold Cup over ten and a half furlongs at the Curragh on 23 May and started second favourite behind Nysaean (twice winner of the Mooresbridge Stakes). The field was not a strong one by Group 1 standards with only four other runners headed by the Winter Hill Stakes winner Naheef. Powerscourt went to the front from the start, accelerated away from his rivals in the straight and won \\"easily\\" by six lengths from the outsider Livadiya. Powerscourt continued to race in European Group 1 class in his next three races. He finished second to Nayef in the Prince of Wales's Stakes, fifth to Refuse To Bend in the Eclipse Stakes and second to Intendant in the Bayerisches Zuchtrennen. In August the colt was sent to the United States for the twenty- second running of the Arlington Million, a race which saw him equipped with a visor for the first time. O'Brien also took advantage of the more relaxed local rules on raceday medication to run the horse on Lasix, a drug commonly used to prevent bleeding. Starting at odds of 4.6/1 he was restrained towards the rear of the field before making progress on the outside and turning into the straight in fourth. He took the led a furlong out but hung sharply left, hampering the German challenger Epalo who in turn collided with Kicken Kris, drawing an angry response from the latter's rider Kent Desormeaux. Spencer managed to straighten up Powerscourt in the final strides and he crossed the line first ahead of Kicken Kris, Magistretti and Epalo, only to be disqualified by the racecourse stewards. Under American rules he had to be placed below the horse he had initially obstructed and was therefore relegated to fourth. The Irish Times stated that Powerscourt had appeared to have won the race on merit and he might well have kept the race under European rules. Desormeaux, however, insisted that Kicken Kris would have won \\"really, really easily\\" without the interference. Powerscourt had four more races in the autumn of 2004 and ran well in three of them. He finished a close third to Azamour in the Irish Champion Stakes (with Grey Swallow, Rakti and Doyen behind), and then went back to the United States and finished third behind Better Talk Now and Kitten's Joy in the Breeders' Cup Turf. For his last two races of the year he competed in Asia, finishing unplaced in the Japan Cup and fourth in the Hong Kong Cup. 2005: five-year-old season On 26 March 2005, Powerscourt began his fourth season in Dubai, where he finished fifth to Phoenix Reach in the Sheema Classic. On his return to Europe he ran poorly when a remote fourth in the Hardwicke Stakes (run that year at York) but produced a rather better effort when second to Imperial Stride in the Scottish Classic at Ayr Racecourse in July. On 13 August Powerscourt, with Kieren Fallon in the saddle, ran for the second time in the Arlington Million and started second choice in the betting behind Kitten's Joy. Better Talk Now was also in the field, while the other seven runners included Sweet Return (Hollywood Derby, Eddie Read Handicap), Good Reward (Manhattan Handicap) and France's Touch of Land (Prix Dollar). As in the previous year he turned into the straight in fourth before launching a strong late run. On this occasion however he maintained a straight course, took the lead inside the final furlong, and drew away to win by three lengths from Kitten's Joy. Coolmore's American stud manager Charles O'Connor commented \\"This makes up for last year. We knew he was a serious horse all along, and it's great for him to come back and prove it. He did just what he did last year. This is vindication to us\\". Kieren Fallon said \\"I thought this was one of the best Arlington Million fields I've seen over the years. I respect Kitten's Joy. I've seen all his wins and I know he's a very good horse. I was expecting him to come home and catch me today, but my lad was at his peak today\\" and added \\"this little horse deserved this win, he was unlucky last year to be taken down. I think it was a great training performance by Mr. O'Brien. The horse was in great condition today and he was an impressive winner... He did everything so easy for me today\\". Breeding record At the end of his racing career Powerscourt became a breeding stallion at Coolmore's Ashford Stud in Kentucky. He briefly returned to Ireland before being bought by the Turkish Jockey Club and moving to Turkey in 2010.

Born in Balasore, India, Phillips always considered himself an \\"Indian boy.\\" His father, Jeremiah Phillips, was also a medical and religious missionary whose work inspired James. After his teen and young adult years, which he spent in America, he returned to India as a missionary, where he worked intensively with many tribes in Bengal, India, especially the Santal tribes. He held medical clinics and sermons, ran a newspaper, founded the Bible School in Midnapore, and started many Sunday Schools, to name a few of his accomplishments. James L. Phillips passed away on June 25, 1895, in Mussoorie, India. The last thing he wrote in his journal before his death was ‚ÄúMay God bless the Sunday School message to the young!‚Äù James Liddell Phillips  Early Life   Childhood  Being the child of Jeremiah Phillips, a prominent religious missionary, James and his siblings were all very religious people, and James was taught from a young age to donate money to religious purposes whenever he made money. During his adolescence, James‚Äô father sent him and his twin brother to America to escape the cholera outbreak in India and to receive a better education than what they could have received in India. During his early years in America, he became less religious. He had a belief that, if he were to be fully devout to Christianity in America, he would feel the need to return to India and become a missionary, like his father, rather than explore other options. Progressively, he became an even stronger supporter of Christianity, leading to him giving his own sermons. After his graduation from Bowdoin College, he did some work as a Pastor in a church in New York, then some more work in medicine and surgery to prepare for missionary work. He was accepted as a missionary by the Foreign Board in 1863. He married Mary R. Sales in 1864 and embarked on his missionary journey later that year.  Education  James L. Phillips received all of his schooling in America before he returned to India as a missionary. As an adolescent, he attended Whitestown Seminary in New York. Phillips then went on to attend college at Bowdoin College, which he graduated from in 1860. By 1864, Phillips obtained his MD from the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, and was eventually bestowed a Divinity of Doctor (DD) degree from Bowdoin College in 1878 as ‚Äúrecognition of his distinguished missionary career.\\" By the time he was 38 years old, Phillips had received an M.A., LL.B., and M.D., as well as a D.D..  Life as a missionary   The call and journey  After becoming a doctor and being accepted as a missionary by the Foreign Board, Phillips moved back to India to extend his knowledge of medicine and religion to the people living there. Not only did he believe it to be his duty as a follower of Christ to help people that were suffering, but he was also content with the work. As he wrote in his journal, ‚ÄúThe present appears happy only when doing my Master‚Äôs will, and the future looks hopeful only as fully dedicated to faithful and zealous labour for my Lord.‚Äù > \\"I told the Lord that I would go anywhere or do anything if He would save > me. From that night, I began to think of India‚Äôs needs and children, and > gave myself up to India‚Äôs God and to them.\\" -James L. Phillips  Service  In India, specifically in Midnapore, Phillips traveled to visit many different jungle tribes, holding clinics, spreading religious services, and ameliorating the state of the villages. The two services he provided-medical and religious-had a tendency to overlap. Often, when providing medical services, he directed patients to the ‚ÄúGreat Physician‚Äù for ‚Äúdiseases of the soul.‚Äù Through this process, he converted many Indians to Christianity. He continued this work for 11 years, before a short period of return to America in 1875. After his return to India in 1878, Phillips held his normal medical clinics and also opened the Bible School at Midnapore in 1879, working as its principal for 7 years. After another break from India, Phillips returned in 1891, where he began to offer classes at Union Chapel, Calcutta for students studying International Sunday School Lessons there. These classes were attended by the teachers of Sunday Schools. For two years, Phillips traveled throughout India for the sake of work for the Sunday School Union. He aided in starting up new Sunday Schools and compiling Sunday School Unions in different villages and, by 1891, he had successfully launched the India Sunday School Journal. In 1893, Phillips left India to go on tours in other countries, raising awareness for the Sunday School mission and recruiting new missionaries. When he returned to India, he continued his tours throughout the country with the Sunday School mission until the end of 1894. He continued his missionary work until he physically could not anymore, before passing away in 1895.  Return to America  Phillips' first return to America was in 1875. His return was ultimately based on his deteriorating health condition, for which he needed to receive medical services in America. During this three year break from his missionary work, Phillips was anything but idle. He provided his medical and religious services in America, as well as made plans for the future of his work in India. His next big idea was to build a Bible School in India. Once this idea was approved, he proceeded to go on ‚Äúlecturing tours‚Äù throughout America to raise funds and recruit missionaries for this cause. In 1885, Phillips once again went back to America due to his wife‚Äôs deteriorating health. Upon his return, he decided to extend his services, especially religious services, to America. Almost immediately after his return, he was invited to be a pastor of a church in Auburn, Rhode Island. After working in this position for a while, he became the chaplain of the State Institution of Rhode Island, where he aided in prison reform. He was later invited to Philadelphia to be the secretary of the Evangelical Alliance. All the while he was extending his services in America, he was still fundraising for Indian children and Sunday Schools in India. The recognition of his efforts led to his becoming the secretary of the India Sunday School Union.  Legacy  Throughout his 33 years of missionary work in India, Phillips is most remembered through his physical establishments and his dedication. > ‚Äú[James'] life was one of self-sacrifice and devotion so deep and full and > rich, that to his dying day he never had a thought that he was doing > anything nobler than the simple duty which the created owe to the Creator.‚Äù  The Bible School at Midnapore  The Bible School in Midnapore was opened in May of 1879. The first year of its opening was a preparatory year for the teachers to get ready for students. Students, who were typically potential missionaries, started attending the Bible School in 1880. During winter months, students would do religious missionary work: preaching and spreading God‚Äôs message. For the rest of the school year, they would attend classes. James L. Phillips was the principal of the Bible School for a total of seven years, but even in this position, he continued his own missionary work. The Bible School in Midnapore proved to be very successful and garnered a lot of attendees, who then went on to spread their learnings of Christianity to others in the area.  The Sunday School Mission  By the end of Phillips‚Äô many tours and efforts for the Sunday School, the total number of Sunday Schools in India grew to well over 5,548, with over 197,754 attendees. Phillips also helped publish and wrote for the Indian Sunday School Journal, of which he was the editor, for many years, even when he was on his tours.

India's wave power potential is around 40-60GW. However, compared to the developments in other renewable energy technologies, ocean energy technologies like wave and tidal are in their nascent stages of development in India.  Resources  Wave power depends upon the height of the wave and its period. Primary estimates of wave energy potential along Indian coast is around 5-15 MW/m, so the theoretical estimated potential comes out to be around 40-60 GW. A study by IIT Madras and Credit Rating Information Services of Indian Ltd (CRISIL) have shown that western coast has higher wind power potential compared to eastern coast. They have identified potential locations for wave power development along the west coast of India in Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala. Kanyakumari located at the southern tip of Indian peninsula has the highest power owing to the effects of refraction and strong winds. With currently available technologies, amount of power that can be generated using wave energy is much less than the theoretical estimated potential. The capacity utilization factor for wave energy in India is in the range of 15-20%.  Vizhinjam wave energy plant  Wave energy research in India was initiated in 1983 when the Department of Ocean Development of Government of India provided funds to Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, for carrying out the research.RAJYA SABHA STARRED QUESTION NO. * 310- Technology to harness Wave Energy. (2012, September 03). Retrieved from http://moes.gov.in/writereaddata/files/RS_310_11_15_2012.pdf This led to the establishment of a 150 kW Pilot wave energy plant in 1991 at Vizhinjam in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. Vizhinjam wave energy plant was the world's first wave power plant working on oscillating water column (OWC) technology. This technology utilizes the change in levels of water inside caisson as waves approach. As the water level increases in the caisson, the air inside is compressed, which is then used to drive an air turbine. The power generated from this plant, however, varied a lot throughout the year and maximum power was generated only during the monsoon months. After a long duration of being out of use, it was planned to be utilized for powering a Reverse Osmosis Desalination plant in 2004. This project also was not successful and the wave energy plant was finally decommissioned in 2011. Vizhinjam Wave Power Plant in the background  Economics  Wave energy is amongst the most capital intensive forms of renewable energy. The current cost of wave energy varies between 34 and 63 ‚Ç¨c/kWh. According to a study by IIT Madras and CRISIL, wave energy technologies would require about 10 GW of cumulative capacity to become cost competitive.  Benefits  Wave energy is a clean and renewable source of energy. Since waves are always present, wave power is more consistent in electricity generation when compared to renewable energy sources like wind and solar. They can be a good source of energy generation for off grid coastal areas and islands. Wave energy often used to power the desalination plants. Wave energy turbines when combined with offshore breakwaters can help achieve the protection of seashores.  Challenges  There are several challenges that need to be addressed to make electricity generation from wave energy commercially viable. Technological challenges include low turbine efficiencies, high turbine costs, unavailability of grid connections at potential sites, lack of experience and unpredictable environmental conditions. Owing to inadequate data, it is challenging to estimate the impact of wave power generation on marine ecosystem. Moreover, investment in wave power is perceived as risky investment by financial institutions because of high capital cost and lack of operational experience.  Administration and policy  The Ministry of Earth Sciences in Government of India oversees the development of wave energy in India with National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai (NIOT) being a participating institution. The ministry envisions development of wave energy to power low-temperature thermal desalination (LTTD) plants and to meet the lighting requirements of small islands. India's government has set a target of achieving 40% cumulative electrical power capacity from non-fossil fuel resources by 2030. It plans to enhance the renewable power installed capacity to 175 GW by the end of 2022 which includes 60 GW from wind power, 100 GW from solar power, 10 GW from biomass power and 5 GW from small hydropower. There is however no specific target for wave power capacity enhancement.

At 67 years old, she became the first deaf-blind African American to earn a college degree in the United States of America. Biography Early life Geraldine Jerrie Lawhorn was born on December 31, 1916 in Dayton, Ohio, from Pearl Walker and William Bert Lawhorn. Her parents were musicians, and at the time, the managers of a movie theater in Dayton. She had two older brothers, Melvin and Wendell Lawhorn. Geraldine spent her childhood between Dayton and Chicago. When she was eighteen months old, her family settled in Chicago, where they started a confectioner's trade business. After her parents' divorce in 1922, Geraldine returned in Dayton with her mother and started elementary school. However, a traumatizing experience compelled them to move back to Chicago, where she lived with her mother and her brothers. During The Great Depression of 1929, the Lawhorns went through financial hardships. Pearl Walker opened a beauty shop in their apartment to earn some money and have time to take care of her children. Handicap and school  Geraldine was about eight years old when doctors discovered she had an eye condition. She could not see well, and faced difficulties to read. Geraldine attended many church meetings because her parents thought religion could help her. At twelve years old, Geraldine lost her sight, but she could still perceive some glimmer of light. Doctors never found the cause of her blindness. As a result, she attended the Sight-Saving Room of the Sherwood Grammar School which provided some accommodations for the visually impaired pupils. Geraldine had to learn the braille language, but still had classes with sighted students. Her integration at school was not easy: in eighth grade, her classmates booed, stigmatized, and discriminated against her. Then, Geraldine attended the Braille Department of Marshall High School. She became interested in writing and public speaking. She won several prizes for her short stories. She decided to change her name from \\"Jerry\\" to \\"Jerrie\\" because she wanted it to seem French. As for the sight, Jerrie progressively lost her hearing capacities. Therefore, she had to learn a new mode of communication : the One-Hand Alphabet, and joined a special academic program in the Braille Room. This situation did not prevent her from improving her writing skills. She won a writing contest in Chicago after presenting her short story Gift. She also wrote a novel entitle The Needle Swingers' Baby. Geraldine Lawhorn and her dog Blondie before 1954 Artistic years  Geraldine graduated with honors from high school. However, she did not have plans to further her education. She received a scholarship from the AKA sorority and decided to take a correspondence course in short-story writing offered by Columbia University. The Hadley Institute for the Blind and Visually Impaired provided the braille material for the course. By the time, the Catholic Youth Organization conducted an experiment to see if dogs were able to lead blind people. Jerrie volunteered to participate and received a dog, Blondie. After a couple of months, she could keep it with her. At 19 years old, Jerrie completely lost her hearing. Doctors credited this handicap with measles she contracted when she turned five. It was an emotionally painful situation. Nonetheless, Jerrie did not stay idle; instead, she became involved in many activities. She attended the monthly meetings of the Fellowship Circle of the Blind, where she discovered drama performance and started writing plays for the fellowship programs. The young lady performed her first full-length dramatic recital on May 2, 1940 at Poro College. Geraldine desired attending college but she was refused many scholarships due to her handicaps. She decided to develop her artistic skills instead. She received a grant from the Scholarship Committee in Springfield to take private lessons in theater arts. Thus, she attended three days a week the dramatic department of the Chicago Piano College. Bessie Henderson, the head of the Drama Division of the school and an alumna from Northwestern University, taught her creative writing, diction, public speaking, and acting. Geraldine also had music lessons once a week. It was challenging since she could not hear the piano, but she reported feeling its vibrations. In 1942, Geraldine was admitted to the American Conservatory of Music in Chicago, where she studied for four years. She performed monologues at the United Service Organizations programs. She also volunteered in the Red Cross sewing division and received a medal for her dedication. The Blind Service Association selected Jerrie to audition for Reuben's Amateur Hour on one of the Chicago's leading stations. She did not win the prize but became popular. She appeared on television programs like \\"Someone You Should Know\\", The Phil Donahue Show, and Ripley's Believe It or Not. Personal life and artistic break At her 25th birthday party, Geraldine met Hap, a friend of her brother. When she married Hap, she stopped her artistic activities to take care of her household despite the opposition of her mother. In 1944, Geraldine and Hap divorced, after six months of physical separation. She reported that the lack of communication destroyed their marriage. Jerrie later thought that getting married was a mistake. She never married again. New York City and the One-woman show years (1946‚Äì1966)  In 1946, with anxiety and excitement, Geraldine and her mother left Chicago to New York City. They settled in Queens, to Frank Wilson's house, a Broadway actor playing in Watch on the Rhine and known to help young talents find success. Blondie was supposed to join them after. However, Geraldine learned by telegram that her dog succumbed to a cerebral hemorrhage. She was very sad and depressed for a long time. Frank Wilson gave Geraldine opportunities to perform on stage. Her first performance in New York City was at his church and her second at Carnegie Recital Hall. She also met backstage the actors Ezio Pinza, Mary Martin and Juanita Hall after attending a South Pacific representation. Geraldine and her mother were supposed to stay only a summer in the city but her increasing notoriety compelled them to stay two years with Wilson. Jerrie did not have a manager. She and Pearl Walker were in charge of her career. The income from the shows allowed her to have private lessons in theater. She also took speech lessons to control her pitch. Pearl Walker and Frank Wilson collected the audience's comments in backstage to help Geraldine improve herself. New Yorker street artists, her surroundings, and her everyday life inspired her for her shows. Geraldine's One Woman Show was entitled : Projected Hearts. Jerrie rented evenings at Carnegie Recital Hall and dedicated her shows to Frank Wilson, after he passed. She was part of the Celestial Choral Ensemble of the Blind, which presented two concerts at the New York World's Fair in 1964. She was the emcee during these concerts. Her favorite activities included shopping and attending Broadway shows with her mother. At Christmas time, both women used to visit the Rockefeller Center and the Radio City Music Hall. In 1948, after Wilson got married, Geraldine and her mother left his house. Because they did not want to leave the city, they went through the perilous apartment search process. They applied to the office of Housing authority, and found an apartment in Long Island City. For the moving-in, Geraldine and her mother received help from their former neighbors, who offered them furniture, including a piano. Both women received monthly allowance from their family in Chicago. Jerrie was involved in many civic activities. She joined a program for handicapped adults, in which she learned swimming, bowling, ceramics, aerobics, and social dancing ‚Äì like rumba, mambo, tango, and paso doble. She took piano lessons offered by the association and learned to read Braille music notation. These new skills opened to her the doors of the New York College of Music where she studied piano techniques. By this time, only three deaf-blind people had received a college degree including Helen Keller and Richard Kinney, president of the International Hadley Institute for the Blind and Visually Impaired. Besides her artistic career and courses, Jerrie wanted to earn a college degree. However, her advisor recommended that she use her scholarship to improve her theater skills. Therefore, she enrolled at the Brown Adams Professional Actors Studio, off Broadway. Geraldine appeared on daytime television shows and won several awards, like the Award of the Best One-Woman show by trade magazine Show Business. Ebony Magazine wrote an article about her life with eight pages spread. Jerrie was also columnist for Braille magazines and wrote short stories for Skylark. In 1966, Geraldine was invited to the 100th birthday anniversary of Anne Sullivan, instructor of Helen Keller. The Perkins School for the Blind and the Industrial Home for the Blind sponsored the Centennial Commemoration at the Washington National Cathedral. This night, eight deaf-blind adults, including Geraldine Lawhorn and Richard Kinney, received the Anne Sullivan Gold Medal. During the event, Kinney invited Geraldine to become an instructor at the Hadley School for a new correspondence course. She did not give an answer after receiving the school invitation letter. She felt perplexed and confused. On the one hand, she did not want to abandon her career, and felt part of the New York City community. On the other hand, she worried about her mother who turn 76 and needed to retire near her family. She finally accepted the teaching proposal. Geraldine Lawhorn and Richard Kinney signing Return to Chicago In 1967, Pearl Walker and her daughter went back to Chicago, as the Hadley School confirmed Geraldine's employment. She did not immediately start her position. Indeed, she participated in a training program, offered by the Anne Sullivan Macy Program, known today as the Helen Keller National Center for the Deaf- Blind Youths and Adults, in Jamaica, NY. Afterwards, she started teaching two correspondence courses : the \\"Independent Living for Those Without Sight or Hearing\\" and \\"Verse Writing and Poetry\\". The poetry courses were free, and twenty-four students signed up. Geraldine occasionally attended the staff meetings and conferences in Winnetka. Geraldine and Richard Kinney became good friends, and he was a source of inspiration. Geraldine's one stage appearances did not stop after she became instructor. She still gave presentations to service clubs, conventions, and seminars. She was the keynote speaker at the Second International Conference of the Association for Education and Rehabilitation of the Blind and Visually Impaired at Chicago's McCormick Center Hotel. Less than two years after they settled in Chicago, Pearl Walker had a stroke and was hospitalized for thirty days. The attack left her paralyzed on the left side. She had to undergo months of rehab, which consisted of therapeutic exercises with a nurse's aid five times a week. Geraldine's family were supportive during this phase. Geraldine used the Vibralert and the Tactile Speech to communicate with her mother. She and her sister-in-law, Helen Lawhorn, organized Pearl's 81st birthday party. However, in 1972, Pearl suffered another stroke, and passed away on October 11, 1972. After the death of her mother, Geraldine started using new equipment to be more independent: the Code-Com telephone attachment for the deaf-blind, a Signal Master that activated electric appliances when the telephone rang, and an Optacon given by the Hadley School to read inkprint material. Pearl Walker, mother of Geraldine Lawhorn before 1954 Furthermore, Geraldine remained very active. She attended the convention of the American Association of the Deaf- Blind at the University of Washington, along with 175 other deaf-blind people. She was present at the 80th-birthday ceremony of Helen Keller organized by the Industrial Home for the Blind in Brooklyn. She went to Helen Keller's one hundredth birthday on June 27, 1980, at The Helen Keller Centennial Congress in Boston, MA. Geraldine also worked with elderly people and deaf-blind families, and was very supportive. College degree  Obtaining a college degree was a great challenge for Geraldine, and she was determined to make it. Through a friend, she learned about the University Without Walls program that many colleges offered. She applied to this program and got accepted at Northeastern Illinois University. On March 23, 1983, Geraldine presented her narrative abstract before a committee, and passed her examinations. She earned her bachelor degree in Rehabilitation of Deaf-Blind Adults from Northeastern Illinois University. The commencement ceremony took place on June 12, 1983, and three television channels videoed it. Thus, Geraldine became at 67 the first deaf-blind African-American person to graduate from college. She became as well the sixth deaf-blind person in the United States to earn that achievement. Three days after, the new graduate flew with a friend to New York City, where David Hartman interviewed her on the nationwide television show \\"Good Morning America\\". On June 17, 1983, Geraldine received a letter from President Reagan congratulating her for her degree. After that, Zig Ziglar quoted Geraldine as an model of perseverance in his book Steps to the Top, published in 1985. Geraldine continued to be active in the Deaf-Blind community. She encouraged deaf-blind people to never give up and \\"keep trying\\". In 1991, Miss Lawhorn wrote her autobiography entitled On Different Roads. She supported that people had the same goals but took different roads. Late years  In the 2000s, Geraldine traveled throughout the United States to educate people on how to teach deaf-blind people. She lived alone in her South Side apartment and daily used a lot of equipment like the Braille cooking utensils. She wished she could drive and be more active in the deaf- blind cause. Nevertheless, she stayed grateful for the opportunity she had in life and said: \\"I enjoy what I get and I don't worry about the rest\\". Sanjay Leela Bhansali cited Geraldine autobiography's One Different Roads as one source of inspiration for his film Black, released in 2005. The same year, Geraldine received the Ninth Annual Mercedes Mentor Award in Chicago. In 2011, Jerrie Lawhorn retired from the Hadley Institute for the Blind and Visually Impaired after 40 years of teaching. The same year, the Winnetka-Northfield Chamber of Commerce awarded Geraldine as the Winnetka Teacher of the Year. She was honored during the Winnetka-Northfield chamber's 35th Annual Recognition Lunch on May 4, 2011 at the Winnetka Community House. Miss Lawhorn received other recognitions in her lifetime. For instance, she was introduced into the Disabled Persons Hall of Fame in Chicago and received the Hadley School's Challenge of Living Award. Furthermore, Geraldine was treasurer for the Club of Blind-Deaf Adults in Chicago for many years and served at the Illinois Advisory Board for Services for Persons Who are Deaf-Blind directed by James Thompson, former Illinois governor. Geraldine Lawhorn receiving a price from the Hadley Institute for the Blind and Visually Impaired. In the top right- hand corner, her longtime interpreter Charita Graham Geraldine Lawhorn died on Sunday July 3, 2016 at Weiss Memorial Hospital on the North Side of Chicago. Her friends, relatives, and students described her as an open, joyful and optimistic woman. Miss Lawhorn left all her estate to the Hadley Institute for the Blind and Visually Impaired.

The , , tanker was owned by Bankers Trust Company and operated by Keystone Shipping Co. of Philadelphia which burned in an explosion with the stern section sinking just hours after leaving San Francisco bound for New Orleans with a cargo of 91,984 barrels of lubricating oil and additives. In addition to the cargo the ship was fueled with 8,500 barrels of Heavy Fuel Oil (Bunker C) before departure. The ship had departed just after midnight and was in the process of disembarking the pilot at 3:24 a.m. when an explosion occurred near the No. 6 center-independent tank blowing the pilot Captain James S. Nolan and two crew members into the water. The pilot boat San Francisco rescued the pilot and one of the two crew members. The incident The ship was eight miles off the Golden Gate on October 31, 1984, at 3:24 a.m., when she was torn by a very large double explosion just forward of her deck house. A 100-foot section of deck, the whole width of the vessel, was thrown up and then back down forward on the deck in front of it, as flames shot hundreds of feet in the air. Coast Guard cutter Pt. Heyer stands by as the stricken tanker SS Puerto Rican burns following a massive explosion, October 31, 1984. Loss of life, Coast Guard response, partial sinking A bar pilot, the third mate, and a crew member were thrown into the sea. The pilot boat San Francisco rescued the badly injured pilot and mate, but the crewman was lost. As fire raged onboard, the Coast Guard towed the crippled ship further out to sea, to keep her from breaking up and dumping her cargo near San Francisco Bay. On November 1, a storm passed through the area, battering the Puerto Rican with 35-mile-per-hour winds and 16-foot-high seas. That evening, after 32 hours of effort, navy fireboats finally extinguished the fire. On November 3, 30 miles southwest of the Golden Gate, she broke up, her stern section sinking to a depth of 1500 feet within the boundaries of the Gulf of the Farallons National Marine Sanctuary. Over a million and a quarter gallons of refined petroleum products, about one-third of Puerto Rican's cargo, went into the water. Suspicion of bombing and subsequent investigation In the days after the explosion, there were intimations in the media of sabotage linked to a labor dispute. The vessel had been picketed in a Bay Area port and some of its crew harassed by maritime union pickets. The FBI intervened, but it was quickly determined that no point source explosion had occurred. Later it was found that the explosion probably resulted from holes in tank compartment bulkheads that allowed caustic soda to mix with zinc, forming deadly hydrogen gas that then exploded. A Coast Guard board of investigation attributed this to the negligence of the ship's officers on the inbound voyage from Long Beach. But no cause of the explosion could be established with certainty. Oil spill impact The environmental impact was significant. In addition to the initial spill, the sunken stern section continued to discharge heavy bunker oil ‚Äì as much as 8,000 barrels ‚Äì for months and possibly years afterwards. An estimated 4,815 seabirds were killed by oiling as a result of this spill; another 1,368 were recovered.

Early Life De Grandmaison was born in Moscow to noble French and Russian parents. From a young age, he was interested in painting and the fine arts, but his career took another path when he received a commission in the White Russian army, prior to the Russian Revolution. However, from 1914 on, while in a German prison camp he started making portraits. Afterwards he decided to pursue an education in the arts and travelled to study art in London and Paris, before settling to Canada in 1923. Although he studied oil painting, he used pastels after his move as they were easier to obtain in Canada during that time. Life in Canada On September 19, 1931, he married Sonia de Grandmaison (n√©e Sonia Dournovo), another Russian artist living in Canada. Sonia was born in 1912 in Russia, and was the daughter of Colonel Orest Dournovo and Alexandra Berdiaeff, who had immigrated to Canada after the Russian Revolution. Nicholas and Sonia decided to settle in Calgary, where they made their living painting portraits of children. But soon they both became interested in characterization, which developed into a lifelong study of the First Nations in Canada and America. They started to travel more to various reserves and reservations across North America in order for Nicholas to paint, but in 1939 made their home in Banff. Achievements By the end of his life, Nicholas R. de Grandmaison was an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy, spoke several First Nations' languages, and was invested as a member of the Order of Canada in 1972. Through his work and his art, de Grandmaison captured an important era of Canadian and American history, and is considered a prominent visual historian in Canada; his work is represented in numerous public and private art collections throughout North America. Nick de Grandmaison was staunchly proud of both his Russian and French heritage. He was particular that he was ‚Äúde Gandmaison‚Äù and he was to be the only artist in Canada to be ‚Äúde Grandmaison‚Äù. His eldest son (and his eldest child) was Orest, but generally known as ‚ÄúRick‚Äù. Rick made a name for himself in his own right, in the arts world. He painted under the name of O.N. Grandmaison - he was not ‚Äúde Grandmaison‚Äù. At still a young age, O.N. Grandmaison passed away. Nicholas de Grandmaison had four other children, Tamara Grandmaison, Sonja Claire Grandmaison, Nicholas Grandmaison and Ludov ‚ÄúLou‚Äù Grandmaison. A large collection of de Grandmaison works are held by the University of Lethbridge (Alberta).

In 1921, he joined the Grey Advertising Agency founded by Lawrence Valenstein in 1917. The company's original focus was to publish direct mailings for the furrier industry which morphed into a magazine named Furs and Fashions. In 1925, the firm, renamed the Grey Advertising Agency, became a full-fledged advertising agency and differentiated itself from its competitors by using a team approach to advertising that closely worked with its customers and conducted extensive marketing research. Grey focused on developing a brand through pre-selling and building a market for it. Fatt served as the primary salesman while Valenstein served as administrator. In the 1930s the firm focused on soft goods. In the 1940s, the firm was billing $1 million per year. In 1947, after winning Gruen watch account, billings reached $10 million. In 1955, after winning the Block Drug account, Grey's billings reached $30 million. In 1956, Valenstein became chairman of the board and Fatt became president. In 1957, the firm developed the widely successful \\"Leaving now for Trenton, Philadelphia and Cucamonga!\\" campaign for Greyhound Bus with the tagline \\"Go Greyhound and leave the driving to us.\\" Fatt was responsible for winning the accounts of Ford Motor Company, Procter & Gamble and Chock Full o' Nuts. In 1961, billings reached $59 million and Valenstein became chairman of the executive committee; Fatt was named chairman and Herbert D. Strauss its president. In 1961, the firm expanded by opening an office in Los Angeles; and he expanded internationally by opening offices in London in 1962 and Japan in 1963. In 1964, billings reached $100 million. In 1965, the firm went public trading on the Nasdaq exchange and the firm also expanded into the use of psychographics (the analysis of consumer lifestyles). In 1966, Grey became one of the top 10 agencies in the U.S. In 1967, Strauss was named CEO and Edward H. Meyer, president. In 1969, Grey won the Kraft General Foods' Post cereal account and sales reached $230 million.New York Times: \\"Herbert Strauss, Ad Official Dies March 18, 1973 In 1969, Strauss was named chairman and in 1970, Meyer was named CEO.

Plot After the sudden death of his wife, Gregorio - a grumpy conservative Real Madrid fanatic - has to carry out her final wish: to spend a weekend with his children and their partners in Sanl√∫car de Barrameda and throw her ashes into the Guadalquivir river. Gregorio's daughter Sandra is married to Jordi, a Catalan and diehard Barcelona supporter, who wants to send Gregorio's future granddaughter to a bilingual Catalan-English school in Barcelona. They are joined by Gregorio's other daughter, Alicia, who is going out with an anarchic hippy named Leo, and his son Carlos, to whom he has not spoken since Carlos announced he was homosexual six months ago. Carlos arrives with his boyfriend Eneko, a Basque of Senegalese origin, far from the ideal partner Gregorio would have envisioned for his son. This trip to the south of Spain put this dysfunctional family's capacity for forgiveness to the test, and sees them forced to accept each other, warts and all.

However, it received mixed-to-poor reviews from critics. Jordi Costa, writing for El Pa√≠s, complained of the film's lack of comic timing, and added, \\"The figure of a policeman, who bellows 'Gibraltar is Spanish!' reflects the type of viewer for this kind of product.\\" ABC gave the film two stars out of five, criticising the \\"vulgar metaphor\\" of using various characters to reflect \\"Spain today\\", but notes that such films often have more commercial than critical success.

She is the founder of The House of Arts and several other international projects, co-founder of Expoart Japan, Expoart London, and Ateliers Without Borders, as well as co-founder of Art Brazil in 2013 with partner Maria Fulfaro. Early life and education Grandniece of noted Brazilian industrialist and arts patron Ciccillo Matarazzo, Jade Matarazzo grew up surrounded by the art and artists that came to Brazil from all over the world for the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial. This early exposure to the works of Manabu Mabe, Tarsila do Amaral, Caryb√©, Ren√© Magritte, Candido Portinari, Picasso, and others would eventually lead her to her life's work. She discovered a love for photography while attending an all-girls school in Switzerland. Matarazzo instantly fell in love with the camera and the stories she could tell through it. Pursuing an arts education, she attended the Escola Panamericana de Arte in her native Brazil and continued her studies at the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale after moving to the United States in 1992. In 2016, Matarazzo enrolled to further her education at Sotheby's Institute of Art to study art as a global business, curating and art history. Photography career Matarazzo began exhibiting her work in 2002 at group shows at the Museum of the Americas in Florida as well as some galleries in Europe. Her first big solo exhibition, \\"Boundaries\\" at the Solange Rabello gallery in Miami in 2005, consisted of 40 photographs. She sold almost all the work and marks this show as her transition from student to professional photographer. In 2013 Matarazzo joined with other artists for a special project documenting the Japanese culture in her native Brazil. Japanese Brazilians are the largest Japanese descendant community outside of Japan. Matarazzo worked alongside photographer Kazuo Okubo, sculptor Yutaka Toyota, and mixed media painter Catarina Gushiken as part of the \\"West Encounters East\\" project. Matarazzo used her time there to capture the faces of the 2013 Tanabata or \\"Star Festival\\" held in the Liberdade district of S√£o Paulo. In 2015, her \\"Views of Tanabata\\" exhibit appeared at the Morikami Museum in Palm Beach County and in Tokyo. Matarazzo recently celebrated the first ten years of her career with an exhibit called \\"Ever Changing Perspectives\\" in her home town of S√£o Paulo, as well as New York and Miami.

As curator and director her initial goal was to provide a cultural and commercial platform for showcasing new talent. The Exhibitions became month-long events featuring venues in both Miami-Dade and Broward Counties. More than 500 Brazilian artists have taken part over the years representing a variety of mediums from photography and painting to sculpture and ceramics, and more than 3000 local K-12 students took part in touring the exhibits, attending workshops and interacting directly with the artists. Matarazzo partners with FocusBrazil on annual international \\"ExpoArt\\" showcases in Miami, London, and Tokyo. These events provide Brazilian artists the opportunity to share their work and garner new cultural experiences. Arts education In 2017, as part of Matarazzo's educational outreach, she launched The Traveling Artist/Atelier Without Borders. The project will bring workshops, performances, and exhibitions to schools, hospitals, nursing homes, shelters for displaced persons, and underprivileged communities. In the last three years, over 3.000 students have participated of workshops, field trips and art installations as part of Matarazzo‚Äôs educational programs with schools like Ada Merritt, Doral Charter Elementary and Adrienne Arsht Center for The Performing Arts.

Alauddin had earlier raided Devagiri in 1296, and forced Ramachandra to pay him tribute. However, Ramachandra had discontinued these tribute payments, and had given asylum to the Vaghela king Karna, whom Alauddin had displaced from Gujarat in 1304. A section of the Delhi army, commanded by Alp Khan, invaded Karna's principality in the Yadava kingdom, and captured the Vaghela princess Devaladevi, who later married Alauddin's son Khizr Khan. Another section, commanded by Malik Kafur captured Devagiri after a weak resistance by the defenders. Ramachandra agreed to become a vassal of Alauddin, and later, aided Malik Kafur in the Sultanate's invasions of the southern kingdoms.  Date  There is some confusion over the date of Alauddin's second invasion of Devagiri. His courtier Amir Khusrau dates this invasion to March 1307, but describes it after the Siege of Siwana, which occurred in 1308. The 16th century writer Firishta dates the Devagiri campaign to 1306, but states that it happened in the same year as the Siege of Siwana. The near-contemporary writer Ziauddin Barani dates the invasion to 1308, which according to historian Kishori Saran Lal, appears to be correct.  Causes of invasion  The Yadava king Ramachandra had agreed to pay an annual tribute to Alauddin after the Alauddin's 1296 raid of the Yadava capital Devagiri. However, in the mid-1300s, he stopped sending the tribute, as Alauddin remained occupied with his campaigns in northern India. As a result, Alauddin sent a force led by his general Malik Kafur to subjugate Ramachandra. According to the 14th century chronicler Isami, the decision of not paying the tribute was that of Ramachandra's son and his associates: Ramachandra himself remained loyal to Alauddin, and even appealed the Sultan to punish his son, resulting in Malik Kafur's invasion. This seems true, because according to Amir Khusrau's Khazainul Futuh, Alauddin ordered his army not to harm Ramachandra and his family during the invasion. According to some medieval writers, another reason for this campaign was the pursuit of the Vaghela princess Devaladevi. During his 1299 invasion of Gujarat, Alauddin had captured the Vaghela queen Kamaladevi, who later married him in Delhi. In 1304, Alauddin annexed Gujatat to the Delhi Sultanate, forcing the Vaghela king Karna to flee to the Yadava kingdom, where Ramachandra gave Karna the principality of Baglana. According to the 16th century historian Firishta, Kamaladevi requested Alauddin to bring her daughter Devaladevi to Delhi. Ziauddin Barani mentions that Malik Kafur invaded Devagiri on his way to the Kakatiya capital Warangal, but this is not correct. Malik Kafur returned to Delhi after his conquest of Devagiri, and invaded the Kakatiaya kingdom at a later time.  March to the Yadava kingdom  Alauddin had thought of selecting Malik Shahin, the former governor of Chittor, as the commander of the Devagiri campaign. However, Malik Shahin had earlier fled Chittor fearing a Vaghela resurgence in the neighbouring territory of Gujarat. Therefore, Alauddin selected another general - Malik Kafur - to lead the invasion of Devagiri. According to Firishta, Alauddin took special care to ensure that all the officers participating in the campaign obeyed Malik Kafur. He sent his royal canopy and pavilion with Kafur, and ordered his officers to pay respects to him daily. These officers included Sirajuddin Khwaja Haji, the minister of war, who held immediate charge of the army. The Malwa governor Ainul Mulk Multani and the Gujarat governor Alp Khan were ordered to extend all possible support to Kafur. Malik Kafur assembled a 30,000-strong cavalry at Tilpat near Delhi, and then marched towards Devagiri via Dhar. His army was reinforced by the forces of Khavaja Haji, Ainul Mulk Multani and Alp Khan. After crossing Malwa, Malik Kafur sent Alp Khan to Baglana to capture Devaladevi forcefully, while he himself marched to Devagiri.  Baglana  In the past, Ramachandra's son Simhana had offered to marry Karna's daughter Devaladevi, but Karna had refused this proposal. As Alp Khan invaded Baglana, Karna found himself in a difficult situation, and agreed to marry his daughter to Simhana. Devaladevi was sent on a journey to Devagiri, escorted by a small party under Simhana's brother Bhillama. According to one account, soon after Devaladevi's departure, Alp Khan defeated Karna in a battle. Karna fled towards Devagiri, pursued by the Delhi forces. He was denied asylum at Devagiri, and ultimately, had to seek shelter from the Kakatiyas in Warangal. Meanwhile, Bhillama's party was intercepted by a contingent of Alp Khan's army. Devaladevi's horse was wounded by arrow, and she was captured by Dilawar Panchami, an officer of Alp Khan. She was taken to Alp Khan, who sent her to Delhi. Firishta offers a slightly different account of Devaladevi's capture. According to him, Simhana had sent Bhillama to escort Devaladevi without Ramachandra's permission. Alp Khan was unable to find Karna in Baglana, and retired to a riverbank, where his army rested for two days. There, around 300-400 of his soldiers took his permission to visit the famous Ellora Caves. During this journey, these soldiers encountered Bhima's party escorting Devaladevi to Devagiri. They defeated Bhillama, captured Devaladevi, and took her to Alp Khan.  Devagiri  Meanwhile, at Devagiri, the defenders offered a weak resistance, and Malik Kafur achieved an easy victory. According to Isami, Kafur plundered Devagiri, but Firishta states that Kafur did not harm the general public. Historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena believes Isami to be incorrect. Amir Khusrau states that the defending army split into two sections: one section led by Ramachandra surrendered, while another section led by his son Bhillama fled. Ramachandra left his son Simhana (or Singhana) at Devagiri, and then came to meet Kafur.  Aftermath  Kafur took Ramachandra and his family to Delhi to personally acknowledge Alauddin's suzerainty. In Delhi, Alauddin treated Ramachandra well, and honoured him with the title Rai Rayan. According to Barani, Alauddin gave him 100,000 gold tankas (coins), and the principality of Navsari in Gujarat. According to Haji-ud-dabir, Alauddin chided Malik Kafur for misbehaving with Ramachandra, and the Yadava king had voluntarily submitted to Alauddin. Ramachandra stayed at Delhi for six months. By the end of 1308, he came back to Devagiri, where he ruled as a vassal of Alauddin. He remained loyal to Alauddin till his death, and helped his army carry out the subsequent southern campaigns of Warangal and Dwarasamudra.

It is presently operational at the Spa Valley Railway where it became a permanent resident to the line in August 2020. Career 21C153 was built at Brighton Works in January 1947 and upon completion was allocated to Salisbury MPD. In addition to Salisbury, she spent considerable time on loan to Stewarts Lane depot where she hauled the heavy \\"Continental Boat Expresses\\" as well as the Golden Arrow on many occasions. Aftera brief spell at Nine Elms and Exmouth Junction, she was returned to Salisbury in 1951. When British Railways was formed in January 1948 she was given her current number 34053. She was rebuilt in 1958, and in 1960, she was transferred to Bournemouth Depot where she worked the Pines Express on the Somerset & Dorset Line and she was to remain in Bournemouth for the remainder of her career with BR until October 1965 when she was withdrawn from service. Naming 21C153/34053 was named by Air Vice-Marshal Park at Brighton station on 19 September 1947. Modifications In November 1958 she was taken into the works at Brighton and was given a complete rebuild. This included removing the air smoothed casing and giving her a complete new shape. Once her rebuild was completed she was returned to her home shed at Salisbury MPD. Withdrawal and Preservation 34053 was withdrawn from service in October 1965, and the following March she was towed to Barry scrapyard in South Wales. Her arrival was delayed by over seven weeks following an incident where a set of connecting rods in 34053's tender struck a bridge near Chandler's Ford; 34053, alongside other Barry-bound engines, were stored for weeks until she was eventually towed to Barry Island where she was to remain for over 18 years. In 1979 she was purchased by Charles Timms for preservation, but it was not until June/July 1984 before she departed from Barry Island as the 153rd loco to be rescued from Barry for preservation. She was moved from Barry to the former shed at Hull Dairycotes which she arrived at in November of the same year (it is unknown where she was stored between its departure from Barry Island and arrival at Hull). Minor work was undertook at Hull with her wheels being sent to Swindon, but very little work was done to her boiler or chassis in the early days, and following the death of Charles Timms in 1992, she was later sold to Dr John F Kennedy and moved to Crewe in 1992 where a full mainline standard restoration was planned. Restoration The plan that had been thought up for 34053 did not, however, work out, so in 1995 she was moved to Thingley Junction but once again very little work was done on her. 34053 was then purchased by Jeremy Hosking who planned to use her as a spares donor for fellow classmember 34046 Braunton. Once she arrived at the West Somerset Railway in January 1997, she was moved by rail from Bishops Lydeard to Williton where work then began on assessing her to see what parts on her would be in good enough condition to use on 34046. It was later discovered that the boiler (one of the original planned donor parts for 34046) was in much worse condition than expected and it was therefore decided that 34046 should use her own boiler rather than 34053's. Eventually she was purchased by Southern Locomotives Ltd and was then moved to their workshop at Sellindge where she arrived on 28 December 2000. After being moved once again to the workshops of South Coast Engineering in Portland after space issues arose in Sellindge, she was taken apart and so began the long job of restoring her to full working order. In late 2008, once fellow light pacific 34070 Manston had left SLL's workshop at Herston, 34053 was transferred to Herston Works where her restoration was to continue. Because her original tender had been lost during her time at Barry Island a brand new tender had to be built for 34053 as well as new tender wheelsets, tender frames, tank and all the other required pieces. Return to Steam 34053's restoration was completed in May 2012; however, because her originally intended home at the Swanage Railway had no use for her as they already had fellow SLL based engines 34028 Eddystone and 34070 Manston both operational and running on the line, it was decided to base the loco for the foreseeable future at the Severn Valley Railway. Following weeks of testing and running in on the line she entered service in August 2012. On Sat 31 August 2013 a naming ceremony was held at Bridgnorth to re-dedicate the locomotive in honour of Sir Keith Park; the locomotive was re commissioned by the New Zealand High Commissioner Sir Lockwood Smith. Presently 34053 is only able to operate on heritage railways as she is not certified to operate on Network Rail. Fame in Preservation On Friday 26 October 2012 34053 made a guest appearance in one of that years Children in Need events when she took part in a race between the Severn Valley Railway and the Morgan car company and would start off at Bridgnorth with both racing to Kidderminster with both the car and train calling at intermediate stations to collect tokens. Sky Sports commentator Vicky Gomersall was on the footplate of 34053 while the car (a Morgan 3-Wheeler) was driven by Coronation Street actor Tony Hirst. In the end 34053 lost to the Morgan by 5 minutes, but the event managed to raise a large amount of money for Children in Need as the train was a sell out at ¬£20pp. The event was shown on the BBC1 Children in Need evening on Friday 16 November (the event only being shown in the midlands broadcast).

The fourteenth tropical cyclone and twelfth named storm of the 2017 Pacific hurricane season, Lidia developed from a large area of disturbed weather west of the Pacific Coast of Mexico on August 31\\\\. The storm intensified while moving generally northward or northwestward, peaking with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) later that day. On September 1, Lidia made landfall in Mexico near Puerto Chale, Baja California Sur, at peak intensity. The storm weakened while traversing the peninsula, ultimately emerging over the Pacific Ocean on September 3, where the storm degenerated into a remnant low. The system brought thunderstorms and wind gusts to Southern California, before dissipating on September 4. In anticipation of the storm, several tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in the Baja California Peninsula and other areas along the Gulf of California. Flooding in Mexico City resulted in water entering hundreds of homes, while sinkholes formed on some roads. Overall, there were twenty fatalities, including two from electrocution and two from drowning. Meteorological history A low-pressure area offshore the west coast of Mexico developed in late August 2017. Early on August 26, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first discussed the probability of tropical cyclogenesis in a tropical weather outlook (TWO). Initially, the NHC assessed a 0% chance of development within two days and 30% chance within five days, citing marginally favorable conditions. An elongated trough of low pressure formed by late on August 27 and was initially composed of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. After environmental conditions became more favorable and the storm organized significantly - but still lacked a well-defined center - the NHC began classifying the low-pressure area as Potential Tropical Cyclone Fourteen-E at 21:00 UTC on August 29. The low soon developed banding features and intensified throughout the day on August 30. After data from an unmanned NASA Global Hawk and observation stations indicated that the broad circulation became more consolidated, the NHC initiated advisories on Tropical Storm Lidia at 18:00 UTC on August 30 about south-southeast of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. The storm, which was relatively large, moved north- northwestward due to flow from a weak ridge over Mexico and a weak cyclonic gyre to the west. Favorable conditions such as warm sea surface temperatures and low wind shear allowed Lidia to intensify, and by 00:00 UTC on September 1, the storm peaked with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum atmospheric pressure of 986 mbar (hPa; 29.12 inHg), which was based on Dvorak estimates with the hints of an eye feature. Around 12:00 UTC on the following day, Lidia made landfall near Punta Marquez, Baja California Sur, with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Shortly after landfall, satellite imagery indicated that convection associated with Lidia was becoming disorganized. The cyclone weakened significantly while traversing the mountainous terrain of the Baja California Peninsula, and by early on September 2, deep convection was mainly limited to a few strong clusters near the center. Around that time, Lidia briefly moved offshore, before making another landfall near Punta Abreojos a few hours later, with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). By that time, Lidia weakened steadily, and emerged over the Pacific Ocean on September 2. However, Lidia continued to weaken due to cold sea surface temperatures. After failing to produce deep convection for about 12-15 hours, the NHC declared that Lidia had degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area at 09:00 UTC on September 3, about 40 mi (65 km) southwest of Punta Baja, Baja California. On September 3, Lidia's remnants brought thunderstorms, wind gusts, and flash flooding to Southern California, before being absorbed by another upper-level low off the coast of California, on September 4.WPC surface analysis valid for 09/04/2017 at 21 UTC Preparations and impact Infrared satellite loop of Lidia making landfall in the Baja California Peninsula on September 1 Upon the NHC initiating advisories on Potential Tropical Cyclone Fourteen-E at 21:00 UTC on August 29, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch from Todos Santos and Los Barriles in Baja California Sur. At 03:00 UTC on the following day, a tropical storm watch was posted from Los Barriles to San Evaristo. The hurricane watch extended northward to east of La Paz at 15:00 UTC on August 30, while a tropical storm warning was issued from west of La Paz to Loreto and from north of Los Barriles to La Paz. Additionally, a tropical storm watch became in effect from Bahia Tempehuaya to Huatabampito in Sinaloa. Three tropical storm warnings were issued at 21:00 UTC on August 30 from Bahia Tempehuaya to Huatabampito, from La Paz to San Evaristo, and from Santa Fe to Puerto Cortes in Baja California Sur, while a tropical storm watch was posted from Puerto Cortes to Puerto San Andresito. At 09:00 UTC on August 31, tropical storm warnings were extended from north of Puerto Cortes to Puerto San Andresito, north of San Evaristo to Loreto, and north of Huatabampito to Guaymas, Sonora. Simultaneously, a tropical storm watch was issued from north of Puerto San Andresito to Punta Abreojos, north of Loreto to Bahia San Juan Bautista in the state of Baja California, and north of Guaymas to Bah√≠a Kino in Sonora. In Mexico City, heavy rainfall disrupted the public transportation network at several locations. A number of roads were flooded, including parts of the Circuito Interior and Avenida Ocean√≠a. A large sinkhole engulfed an entire central street and measured at least in width and in depth. Hundreds of homes in the city were flooded. Bad weather conditions at Mexico City International Airport resulted in the cancellation 18 flights and the diversion of about 150 other flights. In Cuautitl√°n Izcalli, about 300 people were evacuated after the El √Ångulo dam collapsed, with water entering hundreds of dwellings, while many other homes were flooded with sewage in Ecatepec de Morelos after a canal overflowed. Flooding triggered red alerts on the color coded alert system in the municipalities of Azcapotzalco, Cuajimalpa, Gustavo A. Madero, Miguel Hidalgo, and Venustiano Carranza, while an orange alert was issued for Cuauht√©moc. Heavy precipitation was also reported in northwestern Mexico, with nearly of rain observed in San Jos√© del Cabo. Nationwide, twenty deaths were attributed to the storm, including two from electrocution and two from drowning. Wind advisories were issued for parts of Southern California as the remnants of Lidia continued to move northward. A microburst event in Santa Barbara associated with the remnants of Lidia seriously injured a teenager as she was struck by a canoe at the beach. Damages in Baja California Sur were calculated at MX$2.2 billion (US$123 million), including MX$187 million (US$10.5 million) in infrastructural sector.

During her employment, she was responsible for the precision and consistency of language in the magazine. Personal life Eleanor Gould was born in Newark, New York, on October 3, 1917. When she was very young, her parents, Eleanor Loveland Gould and lawyer Wilson Mosher Gould, moved to Ohio. Growing up, young Eleanor Gould quickly discovered her passion for the English language and her love of reading. She read multiple books each day and worked hard to excel at school. Her self-described \\"retentive memory\\" served her well; she would go on to graduate from high school in three and a half years, attaining the \\"highest average in the history of the school.\\" She was awarded a scholarship to Oberlin College as an English major, where she would graduate summa cum laude in 1938. In 1939, Eleanor Gould moved to Manhattan, New York City. She worked in several low-paying editing jobs before she decided to apply to The New Yorker. In her application, she mentioned two errors that she had found in a new issue of The New Yorker, citing her ability to fix them as a reason to hire her. Her qualifications and this exemplification of her skills got her hired directly following her interview. She became copy editor for The New Yorker in 1945. There, she came to be known by most as \\"Miss Gould.\\" Shortly after her hire, Eleanor Gould developed a romantic relationship with coworker Frederick \\"Freddie\\" Packard, head of the fact- checking department. The couple married in 1946. A year later, she gave birth to their daughter, Susan Hathaway Packard. Together, the new Packard family enjoyed traveling to faraway places, making regular trips to France, Scotland, Ireland, and Morocco. Later, Eleanor and Susan even took a trip to Antarctica. Peers knew Eleanor Gould to be meticulous and hardworking. It was not uncommon for her to remark on several errors in the smallest of sentences; she is said to have found four errors in a sentence composed of only three words. Even after she suddenly became deaf in 1990, Eleanor Gould continued her work as The New Yorker's only grammarian, though she now communicated with the authors by written note. In her deafness her voice changed; it now had a higher pitch and was described as \\"birdlike.\\" Miss Gould could no longer deeply enjoy her favorite performances: concerts and ballet. Eleanor Gould suffered a stroke in 1999 and abruptly retired (she had originally planned to retire in 2000). She trained several staff members to continue her work in her absence. Her colleagues and friends at The New Yorker respectfully sent her gifts during her retirement. She occasionally expressed a desire to go back to work. She died in 2005 at the age of 87. Her family did not disclose the cause of death. Legacy at The New Yorker Eleanor began her career as a copy editor for The New Yorker on November 5, 1945. She edited for poetry, fiction, and nonfiction writings. After ten years, she transitioned to editing nonfiction. Friends felt that her strict, logic-based approach to editing was sometimes unhelpful in the realm of poetry and fiction. She strove for clarity and precision that would make each article read smoothly. Her understanding of grammar went far past that of many contemporaries. She always considered the larger form of an article. A piece she marked up and returned with feedback was called a ‚ÄúGould- proof‚Äù and often contained phrases like ‚ÄúHow so?\\" ‚ÄúThis Clear? (not to me)‚Äù ‚ÄúNOT Grammar!‚Äù and ‚ÄúHave we completely lost our mind?‚Äù. The term ‚ÄúGrammarian‚Äù was coined in her honor. She was known as ‚ÄúMiss Gould‚Äù (even after marrying she kept her maiden name). Eleanor was indispensable to The New Yorker. Her edits were skeptical instead of cynical and always kept morality in play. She said her work was like cleaning a room: ‚ÄúI just try to make things right.‚Äù The New Yorker's style is now known for its clarity. It is said by many of The New Yorker staff that Gould had as significant a role as many of the most notable authors and editors in house. She looked over nearly every one of the thousands of articles the magazine wrote in her time there. In her 54 years on staff she rarely took days off. She spent long hours in her office working without distraction. Even after she went deaf in 1990, she continued to work, communicating using her fax machine and handwritten notes. About ‚ÄúThe Elements of Style‚Äù by William Strunk Jr., E.B. White said that he was quite grateful to have Eleanor‚Äôs assistance in renewing the second edition. Her edits can be seen in the works of E.B. White, Roger Angell, Wolcott Gibbs, Ved Mehta, Pauline Kael, Philip Hamburger, John McPhee, and Lillian Ross (all nonfiction writers).

He was known to be a highly accomplished scholar as well as a ruthless commander. Jiang Shaoyu (fl. 1115-1145) accused him of cannibalism and eating the minced livers of human beings, but this is likely a literary expression meant to evoke imagery of savageness rather than something to be taken literally. Liu Kai passed the jinshi examination at the age of 26 in 973 and spent his time afterwards as an administrator for public order (sikou canjun) at Songzhou in modern eastern Sichuan. He was promoted to grand master admonisher (zanshan dafu) by 979 and served primarily in a provincial civilian capacity. When Liu Kai requested Emperor Taizong of Song (r. 976-997) to send him to the battlefront against the Khitan Liao dynasty, he was given the office of attendant palace censor (dianzhong shi yushi).

Biography Born in 1865 in Vienna, he joined an engineering regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1882 and would become a second lieutenant three years later. Mecenseffy graduated from the War Academy and in 1895 was transferred to the operations section of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff, while being a captain. In 1907 Mecenseffy was part of the group that worked on the \\"Plan U\\" which prepared for a possible occupation of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary in case of a rebellion. In 1909, he became head of the supply section of the General Staff and was promoted to major general in 1912, being given command of the 18th Infantry Brigade.Mecenseffy.

Early life; career beginnings Boris Sandler was born in 1950 in BƒÉl»õi, Bessarabia (Yiddish: Beltz, today: Moldova), where he was raised among Holocaust survivors and their children in a Yiddish-speaking milieu which would inspire many characters and scenes in his later literary works. From his parents and neighbors, mostly former residents of small towns and villages who had moved to larger cities after the Holocaust, he learned the native folk traditions of Jewish Bessarabia along with its rich Yiddish dialect. Sandler began studying music at the age of five, eventually enrolling in a music conservatory. He worked as a professional violinist for a decade, including seven years playing with the Moldovan State Orchestra. He took a two-year hiatus from his musical career, however, to study literature as part of a group of Yiddish and other minority- language writers who attended the Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow for graduate studies. There in 1981 Sandler was among the first cohort of Yiddish writers and poets to study Yiddish literature at the graduate level in the USSR since Stalin's purge of Yiddish writers and educational institutions in the late 1940s. He made his literary debut that same year in the USSR's state- sponsored Yiddish literary journal Sovetish Heymland, where he would later serve on the journal's editorial board. His first collection of short fiction, Stairway to a Miracle, was published in 1986. Final years in Moldova; move to Israel In 1989 Sandler became the host and lead producer of the first regularly-appearing Yiddish-language television show On the Jewish Street, which aired for several years on Moldovan television. During this period Sandler created two Yiddish-language documentary films, \\"Where is My Home\\" and \\"Don't Give Up Yiddish!\\" about Moldovan Jewish life. Sensing that most of the community would soon leave for Israel, he used the documentaries as a way to preserve the memories of Bessarabian Jewry at a time of great upheaval. From 1990 until 1992 Sandler was also the editor of the Yiddish section of the Chi»ôinƒÉu-based newspaper Our Voice. Sandler moved to Israel in 1992, where he soon became active in the local community of Yiddish writers and journalists, contributing articles to the Yiddish press, working in a publishing house and at Hebrew University where he assisted in the cataloging of interwar Yiddish periodicals. In addition to his work as the executive director of Leivick House Publishing, Sandler published a children's magazine Kind un Keyt. During this period three of Sandler's books appeared in Israel; the novella Case Number 5390 (1992) and the short story collections The Old Well (1994) and Gates (1997). Emigration to America; editor of the \\"Yiddish Forward\\" In 1998 Sandler moved to New York to begin working at the Yiddish edition of The Forward. After the unexpected death of editor-in-chief Mordechai Strigler several months later Sandler took over the newspaper, adding an international lineup of new contributors and training two generations of new Yiddish journalists. Sandler also expanded The Forward's literary offerings, publishing new works by esteemed writers of the older generation including Abraham Karpinowitz, Yekhiel Shraybman, Zvi Eisenmann, Misha Lev, Rivka Basman Ben-Hayim, Tsvi Kanar, Moyshe Shklar, Yente Mash, Chaim Beider and younger writers such as Mikhoel Felsenbaum, Boris Kotlerman, Moishe Lemster, Emil Kalin and Evgeny Kissin. Additionally, Sandler oversaw the production of several thousand hours of The Forward's weekly Yiddish radio show, and produced a dozen CDs of Yiddish music and audio books, which were released under the aegis of The Forward. During this period several of Sandler's novels appeared as serials in the paper. Besides his work as a writer and editor Sandler also produced a series of twelve documentary films about the lives of Yiddish writers. Most of these films, released between 2009 and 2016, were based on interviews conducted in the late 1990s, when the last generation of Yiddish writers who came of age before World War II were still active in Israel. Additionally he oversaw the launch of the newspaper's Youtube channel. Retirement from \\"Yiddish Forward\\"; \\"Yidish Branzhe\\" Sandler retired from the \\"Yiddish Forward\\" in 2016 after 18 years as editor-in-chief. He continues to publish his own fiction as well as the works of others in the online publication \\"Yidish Branzhe\\", which he founded and edits. Literary style/influences/themes While most of Sandler's fiction takes place in the post-war Bessarabia of his youth his subject matter ranges from historical novels about the Kishenev Pogrom and novellas about the Holocaust to portrayals of immigrant Jewish life in Israel and New York and even occasional science fiction. In addition to strong influences from classic Yiddish writers such as Sholem Aleichem and modernist Yiddish writers such as David Bergelson Sandler's fiction often incorporates elements of Magic realism. Among Sandler's frequent themes are intergenerational trauma resulting from the Holocaust, the effect of totalitarian political regimes on the lives of artists and writers, the fate of Yiddish language and culture in the 21st century and the impact of immigration on multigenerational families. Sandler has also written a series of Yiddish children's stories based on Jewish folktales as well as the collection of rhyming couplets ◊†◊ô◊ò ◊í◊¢◊©◊ò◊ï◊ô◊í◊ü, ◊†◊ô◊ò ◊í◊¢◊§÷ø◊ú◊ï◊ô◊í◊ü (roughly: \\"It Didn't Happen that Way.\\") Awards Boris Sandler has received nearly every Yiddish literary prize that was still being awarded in the 1990s and 2000s including the Jacob Fichman Prize (2002), the Dovid Hofshtein Prize awarded by the Yiddish Writer‚Äôs Union in Israel (2005) and the J. I. Segal Prize from the Jewish Public Library of Montreal for the best new work of Yiddish literature (2010 and 2014). Additionally Sandler's short film on the history of the Forward building received an Ippies award from the Center for Community and Ethnic Media at CUNY.

Based on the city of L√©rida (Catalan Lleida, Arabic LƒÅrida), the ·π≠ƒÅ æifa was not an independent state throughout this period but was sometimes a part of the larger ·π≠ƒÅ æifa of Zaragoza ruled by a governor (wƒÅlƒ´). Under the late C√≥rdoban caliphate, L√©rida was ruled by wƒÅlƒ´s of the Ban≈´ Tudjƒ´b. In 1039, it was taken from them, along with Zaragoza, by al-Musta øƒ´n of the Ban≈´ H≈´d. At some point prior to his death in 1046, al-Musta øƒ´n placed his younger son, Y≈´suf ibn SulaymƒÅn ibn H≈´d al-Mu·∫ìaffar, in charge of L√©rida, while in 1046 the elder son, A·∏•mad al-Mu·∏≥tadir, inherited Zaragoza. From 1045, Count Ramon Berenguer I of Barcelona forced the brothers to pay tribute (parias) in return for his not attacking them. In 1064, the brothers had a falling out over the loss of Barbastro to an international Christian army, for which defeat al-Mu·∏≥tadir blamed Y≈´suf, although the city was soon recovered. After al-Mu·∏≥tadir of Zaragoza acquired the ·π≠ƒÅ æifa of Tortosa in 1061 and the ·π≠ƒÅ æifa of Denia in 1076, he and his brother fought a civil war in 1078‚Äì81, resulting in the reunification of al-Musta øƒ´n's principality in al-Mu·∏≥tadir's hands. When al- Mu·∏≥tadir died in late 1081, the ·π≠ƒÅ æifa was divided between his two sons. The younger, al-Mundhir, who was already governing Denia and Tortosa as his father's ·∏•ƒÅdjib, inherited L√©rida also. The ·π≠ƒÅ æifa of L√©rida, as the northeasternmost of the states to come out of the division of 1081, bore the brunt of the conflict with Sancho Ram√≠rez, king of Aragon, and his son, Peter, king of Sobrarbe, who steadily advanced down the valley of the Cinca. In 1083, they took Graus; then, between 1087 and 1093, Peter took Estada, Monz√≥n and Almenar. In 1089, Count Ermengol IV of Urgell launched an attack towards Balaguer, possibly even taking the city temporarily. In 1090, al-Mundhir died and was succeeded by his son, SulaymƒÅn ibn H≈´d, a minor. SulaymƒÅn's regents divided the ·π≠ƒÅ æifa, separating Denia and Tortosa to their own advantage and leaving him a rump L√©rida. In 1100, Peter, now king of Aragon, captured Barbastro, the second city of the ·π≠ƒÅ æifa, and Sari√±ena. In 1101, the capture of Pomar de Cinca and Albalate de Cinca brought the Aragonese up to L√©rida itself. Under al-Mundhir and his son, L√©rida paid tribute to Count Ramon Berenguer III of Barcelona and Count Ermengol V of Urgell. Ermengol V died in the battle of Mollerussa fighting the North African Almoravids, who were trying to subdue the ·π≠ƒÅ æifa of L√©rida, in September 1102. L√©rida appears to have fallen to the Almoravids that year, although others have it lasting until 1110. The Almoravids appointed wƒÅlƒ´s to govern it until it was captured by the Catalans in 1149.

PNG has introduced several pieces of legislation to combat these issues. The Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) released a comprehensive report in 2010 focusing on the rights of women in PNG. Violence against women Sexual and Domestic Violence It is estimated that 67% of women in PNG have suffered domestic abuse and over 50% of women have been raped. This reportedly increases to 100% in the Highlands. Further studies have found that 86% of women had been beaten during pregnancy., Stop Violence Child Fund Australia, at 5. Studies estimate that 60% of men have participated in a gang rape. A 2014 study by UN Women found that when accessing public transport more than 90% of women and girls had experienced some kind of violence., www.asiapacific.unwomen.org. Cases of violence against women in PNG are under reported. This is due in part to gender-based violence being socially legitimized and the accompanying culture of silence., Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Forty-sixth session, 12‚Äì30 July 2010, at 6 Additionally, there is a lack of services for women who experience violence. These services include shelters, counselling and safe houses.,Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Forty- sixth session, 12‚Äì30 July 2010, at 7 PNG has also faced reports of sexual abuse of women by police officers. These abuses have occurred on arrest and whilst in police custody. These assaults are reportedly carried out by both police officers and male detainees. There are also reports of collective rape. These incidents lack documentation or investigation. Consequently, perpetrators are not prosecuted or punished. Amnesty International report Amnesty International highlights the issue of gendered violence in the Papua New Guinea 2016-2017 human rights report. This report highlights widespread violence which is experienced by women and children. The prosecution of incidents of violence is rare. This report also highlights key cultural practices which are seen as continually undermining the rights of women. These cultural practices include bride price and polygamy. Health Maternal health Accessibility to affordable and appropriate health care is an issue faced by women in PNG, particularly for women located in the outer islands. Reports have found that the life expectancy for women is lower than for men.,Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Forty- sixth session, 12‚Äì30 July 2010, at 10 This is linked to the high rate of maternal mortality. PNG has the second-highest rate of maternal death in the Asia Pacific region., Human Rights Watch World Report 2017. It is estimated that just over 50% of women give birth with the aid of a health facility or skilled attendant. Statistics estimate that 930 out of 100,000 live births result in a maternal death. A major cause of maternal mortality is abortion. Abortion is illegal in PNG, unless the mother's life is at risk. Illegal abortions carry a penalty of 7 years imprisonment., Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Forty-sixth session, 12‚Äì30 July 2010, at 10 The criminalisation of abortion has led to women seeking clandestine, and often unsafe abortions. These illegal abortions often pose significant risks to the health and lives of women. There is a lack of data on the effect of illegal abortions on the rate of maternal deaths in PNG. Health care information The CEDAW Committee has also raised concerns about the health care information and services available to women in PNG., Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Forty-sixth session, 12‚Äì30 July 2010, at 11 In particular preventive health care information in the areas of sexual and reproductive health., Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, Forty-sixth session, 12‚Äì30 July 2010, at 11 PNG also has low rates of contraceptive use leading to high rates of teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. The universal access to contraception is supported by the PNG government. However, it is estimated that only a third of women have access to contraception. There are also limited services focusing on mental health and well-being. Especially for women who require specialised care. Customary practices Many traditional customary practices are followed in PNG. These include polygamy, bride price (dava), the stereotypical roles assigned to both men and women, and the continuing custom that compensation payments can include women. These cultural practices reflect deep-rooted stereotypes and patriarchal attitudes. The CEDAW Committee commented that these cultural practices risk the perpetuation of discrimination against women, as they reinforce the unequal status of women in many areas. At this stage these stereotypical values and cultural practices continue due to a lack of sustained systematic action by PNG to modify or eliminate these practices. Marriage Cultural practices in relation to marriage include polygamy, bride price and early marriage. Marriages may also be forced or arranged. In rural and remote areas the traditional cultural practices remain. These practices cover marriage, dissolution, inheritance and family relations. The PNG government announced on 22 August 2016 that an amendment will be introduced to change the country's marriage and divorce laws. The Marriage (Amendment) Bill 2015 and the Matrimonial (Clauses) Bill 2015, are likely to amend the Matrimonial (Clauses) Act 1963 and Marriage Act 1963. These amendments would set a new minimum age for marriages for both boys and girls., Papua New Guinea: Changes to Marriage Laws to be Introduced. These amendments will introduce a fine of between K10,000[US$3200] to K20,000 [US$6400] for offenders who force minors to marry before the age of 17 years. Witch hunts Witch killings are an ongoing phenomenon in PNG, especially in the Highlands. The UN has estimated that 200 witch killings occur annually. The government recognises both \\"white magic\\", which involves healing and fertility, and sorcery. Sorcery or \\"black magic\\" carries a jail sentence of up to 2 years imprisonment. Witch killings tend to be carried out by groups of men and often the whole community is involved. Women and girls tend to be accused of performing witchcraft. Often the individuals targeted are vulnerable young women, or widows without sons., Human Rights Watch, Papua New Guinea. In 2014, 122 people were charged following the deaths of more than seven people accused of sorcery., www.amnesty.org/en/countries/asia-and-the- pacific/papua-new-guinea/report-papua-new-guinea/ The CEDAW Committee highlighted the increasing reports of the torture and killing of women and girls accused of witchcraft. These women and girls were identified as typically being vulnerable members of society, in particular older women without adult sons. The Committee also raised concerns about the lack of information on this cultural practice. To properly understand this phenomenon investigations, prosecutions and the judgments of these cases are required. Leniata Legacy The women's advocacy group the Leniata Legacy was founded following the brutal murder of Kepari Leniata in 2013. Leniata was publicly tortured and burned to death after being accused of sorcery. UN involvement Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women PNG became a member of the United Nations in 1975. In 1995 PNG ratified CEDAW without reservations. Despite ratifying CEDAW, PNG has yet to incorporate it into the domestic law of PNG. Consequently, it lacks the status of domestic law under that Act of Parliament or Constitution. In the 2010 Concluding observations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women focused on PNG, the Committee urged PNG to fully incorporate CEDAW in its domestic legal system. The Committee was also concerned about the awareness of the inhabitants of PNG in relation to the Convention. This concern has arisen because the Convention has not been translated into the main social languages of PNG. United Nations Development Program The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is working with the UN Gender Task Team to help develop Policy on Gender Equality and Women Empowerment in Papua New Guinea. UNDP has three key areas: 1) Supporting women so that they can participate and represent in decision making, both at national and sub-national levels; 2) Giving support to initiatives which address Gender based violence; 3)To promote women's economic empowerment. UN Women Due to widespread violence against women, the UN Women's Strategic Plan has focused on PNG as a priority country., www.asiapacific.unwomen.org. UN Women are focusing on the existing gender- based violence in PNG, the role of women in political developments, inter- agency coordination mechanisms, women's economic empowerment and advancing the gender equality agenda. Education Cultural practices and traditional attitudes often act as a barrier for women and girls trying to access education. There is a high level of harassment and sexual abuse experienced by girls in education facilities. Perpetrators include male teachers. These assaults combined with expulsion due to pregnancy, have led to a lower completion rate of girls compared to boys. There is also a lack of data available about the dropout rates, literacy rates and education enrolment rates. This lack of data makes compiling comparative analysis challenging. In 2002, PNG launched the Gender Equity in Education Policy. The aim of this policy was to address the gender gap which occur at all levels of education. Following this is 2005, PNG launched a 10-year education plan. There is still a lack of transparency about the education sectors budget. The CEDAW Committee highlighted education as being fundamental for the advancement of girls and women. Restricted access to education was identified as a barrier to the full enjoyment of girl's and women's human rights. Access to justice PNG operates a plural legal system. Customary law is subordinate to the Constitution and statutory law. PNG lacks an effective system for dealing with complaints which arise from the legal system. There is also a failure to keep records of the complaints filed by women and their outcome. Furthermore, traditional apologies are still offered as a form of resolution for offences committed. This cultural practice is still performed in the context of village courts. Legislation Under the revised Criminal Code, the Sexual Offences and Crimes Against Children Act introduced a range of new offences. Introduced in 2002, this Act created new offences including marital rape. This was further developed to include grading according to the seriousness of harm, and the manner of sexual violation. The Lukautim Pikinini (Child Protection) Act was adopted in 2009. This Act included provisions aimed at protecting girls from discrimination., National Report submitted in accordance with paragraph 5 of the annex to Human Rights Council resolution 16/21* at 6 In 2013 the Family Protection Bill was introduced., Family Protection Bill 2013. This Bill criminalised domestic violence. Breaches of this Act can incur fines of up to k5,000 (US $1,650) and up to 2 years imprisonment. Since the introduction of this Bill there has been no further action taken by the PNG government, and the rates of violence remain unchanged. Although the Family Protection Bill was passed in 2013, it has yet to be implemented. In 2014 an amendment to the PNG Criminal Code was introduced. The Criminal Code (Amendment) Act 2014 criminalised sorcery-related killings and violence. The aim of this Act was to protect women accused of sorcery. PNG previously prepared the Equality and Participation Bill. This Bill aimed to increase the representation of women in Parliament by having 22 seats reserved for women. However, this Bill failed to pass in 2012 and is yet to be reconsidered.

Raymond, a dramatic reader. It succeeded the Boston University School of Oratory, which had sometimes been informally known by the same name. History In 1873, Boston University opened a School of Oratory headed by Lewis Baxter Monroe as dean. In its second year, Robert R. Raymond joined the faculty as Delineator of Shakespearian Character. By its last year, it had over 100 students, and its graduates included Georgia Cayvan and Leland T. Powers. In 1979, following the death of Monroe, the university decided to close the school. That same year, Raymond organized a new school in the same building as the old one and named it the Boston School of Oratory (BSO). A private venture, it continued the legacy of Monroe and attracted some of the same faculty. The school taught the Delsarte method of dramatic expression. In 1884, Raymond relinquished leadership of the BSO due to failing health and turned it over to Moses True Brown, who had held the chair of oratory at Tufts College. By the mid 1890s, the school had grown to around 70 students pursuing studies that lasted between one and three years. Among the faculty were Florence Adelaide Fowle Adams, who headed the Department of Pantomime, and Hamlin Garland, who headed the Department of Literature. In 1893, the school moved to new quarters in the Back Bay near Copley Square. The following year, it was bought by the Emerson College of Oratory.

He serves as the Minister of Environmental Protection since 29 June 2017. He is a member of the Socialist Party of Serbia since its foundation. He also served as the Minister of Youth and Sports in 1991, in the first convocation of the Government of Serbia. Education and career Trivan was born in Kladovo, SFR Yugoslavia in 1962, where he finished primary and secondary school. He graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Forestry. Being a member of Socialist Party of Serbia, he served as the Minister of Youth and Sports in the first convocation of the Government of Serbia, from 11 February until 31 July 1991. Later he worked in national forestry company Srbija≈°ume, where he later became executive director. Being a prominent ruling party member, he has served as the president and member of Steering committee of numerous national institutions in various fields. In November 2001, year after the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá, he was arrested for the suspicion of committing the criminal act of incitement, which damaged Kladovo-based youth camp for 6.5 million dinars. He was later acquitted due to absolute obsolescence. He was the head of Belgrade Secretariat for Environmental Protection from 2008 to 2017. 2017‚Äìpresent: Minister of Environmental Protection On 29 June 2017, he was named the Minister of Environmental Protection of Serbia in the cabinet of Ana Brnabiƒá. In August 2017, Trivan has stated that Serbia, which significantly lags behind other European countries in the environmental protection, needs 15 billion euros of investments to put in order the field of environment. He has also stated that his ministry will emphasize on projects (thus way generating more money from EU funds and foreign investments), better management of landfills and control of harmful gases and excretories. In late August 2017, Trivan stated that it is primarily necessary to invest around 5 billion euros in wastewater treatment plants. He has also criticized the sales of water sources in the past decade to foreign companies, saying that we are yet to see long-term incomprehensible consequences of such actions.

Thangyat () is a Burmese performance art that blends traditional folk verse performances accompanied by the beat of traditional drums or a hsaing waing ensemble, and interspersed with song, dance and chant routines, and performed during festive occasions, particularly during Thingyan in the lead up to the Burmese New Year. Thangyat are often humorous and satirical in nature, expressing social and political commentary and public opinion. Consequently, from 1974 to 2013, thangyat performances were banned by the Burmese government under the rationale that thangyat performances undermined national security. Since 2013, the Burmese government has required thangyat troupes to submit lyrics to municipal thangyat committees for pre-approval.  Format  Thangyat performances are comparable to slam poetry, as performers use numerous poetic and narrative formulae, and employ traditional theatrical devices, such as shifting voices and tones. A common format involves a call and answer segment between a lead performer called ataing (·Ä°·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫) and the chorus of followers called ahpauk (·Ä°·Äñ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫). Thangyat performances are enjoyed for their wit and use of wordplay.

It takes its name after the Swiss-born merchant Reinhard Iselin who established it in the 1770s. The current main building was completed a hundred years later to design by Vilhelm Dahlerup. History The Iselin family Reinhard Iselin painted by Georg Mathias Fuchs, 1766 Iselingen was created when the former Vordingborg Cavalry District was divided into 12 estates and sold in auction by the crown in 1774. One of them was the former Vordingborg Castle. The castle was a ruin but the land and its tenant farms were acquired by the merchant Reinhard Iselin who gave it the name Iselingen. He also acquired one of the other estates, Vordingborg Castle's former home farm (Vordingborg Ladeg√•rd), which was named Rosenfeld]t. Iselin was ennobled with title of baron in 1776. When he died in 1781, his widow Anna Elisabeth Iselin n√©e Fanritius founded Stamhuset Iselingen for their oldest daughter Marie Margrethe Iselin. Rosenfeldt was also turned into a stamhus and passed on to the younger daughter Anna Elisabeth Iselin. The legal effect of a stamhus was that the estate could not be sold or divided between several heirs. Datteren Marie Margrethe was married to Christian Frederik Ernst Rantzau but the couple was--highly unusually for the time--divorced in 1793. In 1802, she began the construction of a new main building at a site located to the northeast of the old castle ruin. In 1803, Stamhuset Iselingen was dissolved and replaced by a family trust (fideikommis). The estate was then sold to ship captain Jens Lind. Aagaard and Hammerich Just Michael Aagaard After about a year, Lind sold Iselingen to district manager (amtsforvalter) H. H. P. Reiersen who shortly thereafter sold it to a consortium from Copenhagen consisting of Just Michael Aagaard, Peder Bech, Iver Qvistgaard and Hans Wassard. They also acquired nearby Marienlyst Manor. Aagaard became the sole owner of Iselingen in 1806 while Wassard acquired full ownership of Marienlyst in 1810. Iselingen in the 1860s Martin Hammerich at Iselingen with P. C. Skovgaard's painting A Beech Wood in May Near Iselingen Manor seen on the wall Aagaard offered his son Holger Halling Aagaard to become manager of the estate. Recently engaged to 18-year old Marie Ko√´s, he consulted his fianc√© on the matter and she responded with a \\"Yes let's move to Iselingen, then I can have a large garden with lots of flowers and strawberries!\\". Holger Halling Aagaard managed the estate with great skill and inherited it in 1819. He owned Iselingen until 1866 and it won a reputation for being the most well-run estate in the country. He was very interested in both art and science and socialized with many of the most prominent figures of his day. His visitors at Iselingen included the √òrsted brothers, Grundtvig, Bertel Thorvaldsen, Adam Oehlenschl√§gerand Christian Winther. Holger Aagaard's son, Georg Aagaard, a National Liberal politician who was a member of the Constituent Assembly that prepared the Danish constitution of 1849, died before his father. Iselingen was therefore passed on to Holger Aagaard's son-in-law Martin Hammerich, a scholar specializing in Norse linguistics, culture, history. His home at Iselingen became a meeting place for many of the most prominent Nordic intellectuals of the time. Martin Hammerich's son Johannes Hammerich inherited Iselingen in 1881. Later history Johannes Hammerich sold Iselingen to Carl Moresco in 1812. In 1918 it was acquired by Th. Wessel. He sold it to P. Lind in 1823. His daughter Elly Bille Hansen inherited the estate in 1945. After her husband's death in 1957, she ceded it to her daughter Tove, Countess of Ahlefeldt‚ÄìLaurvig. Iselingen was acquired by Niels Otto Hansen on 1 January 1997.. Architecture The main building is from 1902 and was partly built with materials from Vordingborg Castle Ruin. The building was adapted in 1874 under supervision of Jens Vilhelm Dahlerup and Fr. B√∏ttger. It consists of a two- storey main wing flanked by two one-storey side wings. The tower with spire was added in 1920. Today The estate is today owned by Niels Otto Hansen. It covers a total area of 526 hectares of which 290 hectares is farmland and 145 hectares is woodland. The garden covers five hectares. In culture * Iselingen was used as a location in the 1953 film Vi som g√•r k√∏kkenvejen.

The Inhumans\\" and \\"Those Who Would Destroy Us\\", was first released as an IMAX film before being broadcast on ABC as two separate episodes. Based on the Marvel Comics race Inhumans, the premiere is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and acknowledges the franchise's other television series. The episodes were written by showrunner Scott Buck, directed by Roel Rein√©, and star Anson Mount as Black Bolt alongside Serinda Swan, Ken Leung, Eme Ikwuakor, Isabelle Cornish, Ellen Woglom, and Iwan Rheon. In the premiere, Black Bolt and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family are exiled to Hawaii after a coup by Black Bolt's brother Maximus. Inhumans was announced in November 2016 from ABC Studios and Marvel Television, with IMAX Entertainment as a financing partner. Rein√© was hired in January 2017, with Mount cast the next month. Filming began in March 2017, at the former Naval Air Station Barbers Point airfield in Kalaeloa, Hawaii and various locations on the island of Oahu. The episodes were filmed on IMAX digital cameras, with new camera lenses created specifically for use on the series. The ABC version of the episodes features additional, exclusive content that was not included in the theatrical version of the premiere. Visual effects were provided by seven visual effects houses, which were designed to be shown on IMAX screens but created on a television budget and schedule. The IMAX presentation of the episodes premiered in Los Angeles on August 28, 2017, and debuted in IMAX theaters on September 1, following months of poorly received marketing. Inhumans was the first live-action television series to debut in IMAX, and ran for two weeks, earning $3.5 million. \\"Behold... The Inhumans\\" and \\"Those Who Would Destroy Us\\" premiered on ABC on September 29, and were watched by 5.58 million viewers within a week of their release. Both versions of the premiere received negative reviews, with particular criticism going to the production value, which was compared to the rest of the MCU, as well as the acting and writing. Plot \\"Behold... The Inhumans\\" On the island of Oahu, Triton is in search of a newly transformed Inhuman when they are attacked by a strike team. The team kills the new Inhuman and injures Triton, who jumps into the ocean to escape. In Attilan, the secret city of the Inhumans on the Moon, Black Bolt, Medusa and other members of the Inhuman Royal Family discuss an Earth rover that nearly discovers them. Black Bolt does not feel there is need for concern. The Royal Family attend a Terrigenesis ceremony, where the young Inhuman citizens Iridia and Bronaja are exposed to Terrigen Mist to reveal their abilities. After the process, Iridia receives the ability of flight, while Bronaja does not believe he has received abilities. When Black Bolt's brother Maximus, who does not have abilities due to being made human through his own Terrigenesis, goes to console him and touches his shoulder, Bronaja has a vision of Maximus pinned against a wall with snakes attacking him. After the ceremony, Maximus learns of Triton's mission on Earth, and confronts Black Bolt about the matter. Black Bolt explains that he sent Triton to Earth to help find humans who had undergone Terrigenesis due to Terrigen entering Earth's water supply. Triton was to bring them to Attilan to live free of prosecution. Believing Triton may be dead, Gorgon travels to Earth to find him. Maximus questions Medusa's loyalty to Black Bolt, and she attacks Maximus with her prehensile hair, which Maximus realizes is the vision the Bronaja saw. Maximus talks to Kitang, the head of the Genetic Council, and reveals a plan to stage a coup to remove Black Bolt and Medusa from the throne. Kitang plans to have Maximus arrested, but is killed by Maximus' head of security Auran. On Earth, Gorgon is pursued by the same strike team, who receive a kill order from Maximus, but Gorgon defeats them. Karnak learns of what Maximus is doing, and warns Medusa and her sister Crystal. Crystal has her dog Lockjaw send Karnak to safety on Earth, and does the same with Medusa and Black Bolt. \\"Those Who Would Destroy Us\\" Realizing they have all been stranded and separated on Earth, Karnak and Medusa begin to search for Black Bolt, and Gorgon uses his communication device to contact Maximus, hoping it will be tracked so the fight will come to him. Louise, at the Callisto Aerospace Control Center in California, begins to investigate the missing rover and learns of four strange occurrences coming from the same area of the Moon where the rover went missing. She tracks these to locations around Hawaii and decides to investigate further. Maximus threatens the remaining members of the Genetic Council into following him, and continues to use Bronaja's further visions. He tries to convince Crystal to join him. Black Bolt's arrival causes a traffic disturbance, and he fights through the police to escape. He subsequently shoplifts new clothes, and is arrested. Auran pursues Medusa to Earth, only for Medusa to stab Auran for her betrayal, killing her. Maximus addresses the people of Attilan as their new king. Auran is later revived by her own healing ability, and requests back-up from Maximus.

Production Development In November 2016, Marvel Television and IMAX Corporation announced the eight-episode television series Inhumans, to be produced in conjunction with ABC Studios and air on ABC, with the series set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In December, Scott Buck, the showrunner for the first season of the Marvel Netflix series Iron Fist, was revealed to also be executive producing and showrunning Inhumans; Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory also executive produce the series. In January 2017, Roel Rein√© was announced as the director of the first two episodes. Rein√© felt he was chosen because he could make the episodes \\"look really big\\" on a small budget and short schedule. IMAX serves as a financing partner on Inhumans, the first time it had done so for a television series, paying completely for the two episodes. Because of this, the budget for Inhumans was higher than Marvel's other series, a positive for the episodes' visual effects. IMAX had originally approached Marvel about the deal after a successful IMAX event with Game of Thrones in 2015. Buck felt working with IMAX \\"gave us a lot more freedom and pushed and encouraged us to think a little bit bigger than we would if it was just a normal network show. We just wanted to think bigger in terms of scope, and what we were seeing, and how we bring these characters to the audience.\\" Loeb cautioned that Inhumans was \\"a television show that is premiering in an IMAX theater\\" rather than a true film, but that it would still be a spectacle, and \\"a unique way to be able to see TV\\". Writing Showrunner Scott Buck wrote both premiere episodes. Buck served as writer for both episodes, and said that they were intended to be \\"something that absolutely stands on its own\\", but hoped would \\"intrigue people enough to make them want to watch the rest of the show.\\" The episodes begin \\"one big story leading us through the season\\" that focuses on the family drama of the Inhuman Royal Family, taking place at a \\"very critical juncture in their lives\\". It is an original story that Buck wrote after first researching the comics, going back to the characters' origin. Buck intended to ground the characters as real people who happen to have abilities, saying that he was more comfortable writing \\"slightly smaller character dramas\\", but did say that the IMAX presentation encouraged himself and the series' writers to think \\"a little bit bigger than we would if it was just a normal network show. We just wanted to think bigger in terms of scope, and what we were seeing, and how we bring these characters to the audience.\\" Casting In late February 2017, Iwan Rheon was cast as Maximus, followed shortly by Anson Mount as Black Bolt. There was no audition for the role of Black Bolt since the character does not speak, with Mount instead cast due to an existing relationship with Loeb, who felt Mount would fit the role. At the start of March, the series added Serinda Swan as Medusa, Ken Leung as Karnak, Eme Ikwuakor as Gorgon, Isabelle Cornish as Crystal, and Ellen Woglom as Louise. Mike Moh and Sonya Balmores were also cast in March 2017, as the guest roles of Triton and Auran, respectively. They are joined in the episodes by Nicola Peltz, Marco Rodriguez as Kitang, Tom Wright as George Ashland, Michael Buie as Agon, Tanya Clarke as Rynda, and Ty Quiamboa as Holo. Additional guests include Ari Dalbert as Bronaja, Aaron Hendry as Loyolis, Stephanie Anne Lewis as Paripon, Andra Nechita as Iridia, Garret T. Sato as the lead mercenary, Allen Clifford Cole as an outspoken Inhuman, Lofton Shaw as young Black Bolt, V.I.P. as young Medusa, Jason Lee Hoy as Royal Guard Sergeant, Steve Trzaska as Duodon, Jenna Bleu Forti as the lovely Inhuman server, Jason Quinn as Pulsus, Kala Alexander as Makani, Albert Ueligitone as Pablo, Moses Goods as Eldrac, Dan Cooke as a cowboy, Nolan Hong as a tourist, Brutus LaBenz as a cabbie, Tani Fujimoto-Kim as a clerk, Rick Agan as a police officer, Lopaka Kapanui as a police lieutenant, and Miriam Lucien as a serene Inhuman. Design The sets of the series were designed and built more vertically than usual to accommodate the IMAX release, with Carlos Barbosa serving as production designer. Crystal's bedroom was designed to be able to fit Lockjaw, her dog; because he can teleport, the set's door frames did not have to be sized to the character, but areas such as where he sleeps in her room did. Filming Filming took place on location on the island of Oahu, including at Diamond Head. Filming for the two episodes began by March 5, 2017, in Downtown Honolulu, under the working title Project Next. Jeff Jur served as cinematographer on the episodes, and Jean Higgins as producer during filming. Studio work for the episodes took place in Kalaeloa, Hawaii at the former Naval Air Station Barbers Point airfield. Additional filming occurred at Diamond Head, and the Hawaii State Capitol building. Filming on both episodes lasted for 20 days. The episodes were shot on Arri Alexa 65 IMAX 2D digital cameras, to accommodate a debut on IMAX screens. On shooting with the IMAX cameras, Rein√© stated that \\"shaky handheld stuff doesn't really work for IMAX,\\" so he chose \\"to move the cameras more forwards and backwards,\\" which was also helped capture the larger sets built. However, after seeing IMAX footage of Dunkirk that utilized handheld shots, Rein√© was able to incorporate some in the episodes. Rein√© received a list of lenses that Dunkirk director Christopher Nolan used, to help him understand how different lenses worked for the format. A new, wider lens was crafted for the cameras specifically for use on Inhumans, as Rein√© was not happy with the widest lenses already available. He described the new lens as \\"beautifully distorted\\" and \\"something we've never seen before in IMAX\\". Rein√© noted the crew spent the first three days of filming taking \\"a lot of different shots, that have different flavors, different lenses, different locations, different characters and we mixed them together in kind of a test\\" to screen on IMAX and assess how the project was turning out. Jur said that the IMAX lenses were \\"a little slower\\" than modern film lenses he was used to working with, but that they worked well with his tendency to \\"light up\\" sets rather than film in darker settings. Jur also noted that the IMAX cameras gave them more control over \\"how much is in focus in the background\\". Rein√© looked to balance the scale of IMAX with more traditional, \\"intimate\\" television direction. Marvel and ABC were reluctant to allow Rein√© to film elements of the episodes in a more cinematic way in fear that they would not be able to change the style for the television-only episodes in the series if need be. Rein√© convinced the studios to let him film each scene in multiple ways and then decide. He used three cameras for each shot, to get \\"rule shots\\", an ABC version, and his preferred version, and after seeing these takes, Marvel and ABC preferred Rein√©'s version. As an example, Rein√© filmed a dialogue scene using traditional close-ups, but also did an \\"extreme version\\" where the camera moved 360 degrees around the characters as their movements were timed to the dialogue, which the studios preferred. Rein√© also filmed different versions of scene transitions‚Äîspecific shots were intended to end each act, before a commercial break, while different transitions were intended for the theatrical release where \\"the story has to continue\\". Visual effects The episodes feature over 600 visual effects shots, created by seven visual effects houses. Digital Media created many of the effects, while Double Negative, who Rein√© called \\"the best house to do creatures\\", provided the visuals for Lockjaw. Double Negative began work on the character in early February 2017, before filming began, but did not receive approval on the final design for Lockjaw until April 2017, during filming of the series' fifth episode. For Lockjaw's teleportation effect, Rein√© wanted \\"something really organic\\", and created sketches to pitch \\"the idea of how Lockjaw would organically dissolve into a sandburst\\", which Buck and Marvel both loved. Visual effects supervisor Eric Grenaudier noted that the team was trying to create effects that would hold up on an IMAX screen and be equivalent to those seen in the MCU films, but with a television budget and schedule. Rein√© gave specific direction for Medusa's hair in each shot that it had to be animated, for instance having it move away from her shoulder when Maximus touches it in one scene, and then moving it back when he leaves. Rein√© was able to get all the effects shots that he wanted in the episodes. Editing Marvel, ABC, and IMAX had intended for Rein√© to move onto other projects at the end of filming and leave them to put the episodes together, but Rein√© insisted on remaining for the editing process. IMAX Entertainment CEO Greg Foster later praised this, saying that if the episodes were not designed and delivered for IMAX, \\"there's gonna be a series of problems that our fans aren't gonna like. There is no doubt that it's gonna take a little longer, and that's why having the director for a longer period of time exclusively devoted to this project was so critical to all of us.\\" An edit of the two episodes intended for television and a version designed for the IMAX release were created. After filming versions of each scene that he felt were either more cinematic or more suited to traditional television, Rein√© had the television version use more close-ups and the IMAX version focus more on showing scale. The two versions also used the different scene transitions that Rein√© had filmed. The theatrical version totals 75 minutes, and the broadcast version 84 minutes. A majority of the additional content in the broadcast versions was a subplot for Louise as she investigates the missing rover on the Moon. Music Series composer Sean Callery created 70 minutes of music for the episodes, with a 68-piece orchestra, the largest he had ever worked with for television. Callery wrote an \\"adventurous\\" main theme for the series that was featured in full in the IMAX release, with a \\"very, very abridged version\\" used in the television versions. Versions of \\"Paint It Black\\" by The Rolling Stones and \\"Break on Through (To the Other Side)\\" by The Doors are featured in the episodes. Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins Rein√© said during filming that a Marvel executive was on set to ensure whatever was done \\"would tie in with other characters in other universes, in other comics, in other series or movies... It was very collaborative. ‚Ä¶ Nine out of ten times they liked what I pitched‚Äìeven radical things.\\" The Terrigen outbreak in Earth's water supply, as depicted in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., is mentioned, while the Kree hieroglyphic language also introduced on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is seen. Marketing A short teaser for the series was released ahead of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 IMAX screenings on its opening weekend in May 2017, as well as online. A full trailer for the series was screened exclusively at ABC's advertiser upfront presentation on May 17, with reactions praising the visuals for Lockjaw. The first public trailer was released on June 29, after footage had leaked online from ABC's upfront reveal. Darrell Etherington of TechCrunch felt it \\"looks like a dismal low-rent sci-fi trainwreck\\" and Mount \\"does a very bad job of acting in the few scenes he's in ... the sets look like they were put together from Stargate TV show lot sell- offs, hastily repainted.\\" The trailer for io9's Charles Pulliam-Moore made him \\"confidently say that the show looks like it's going to be a mess.\\" He noted that in the comics the Inhumans have \\" melodramatic\\" stories, which would require the series to have \\"a deft writing hand and a sizable special effects budget. Judging from the looks of the trailer, though, a lot of that is going to be missing\\". An extended trailer was shown at San Diego Comic Con International 2017, before also being released online, and appeared before IMAX screenings of the film Dunkirk. Fans in attendance at the panel enjoyed the footage, with Swan feeling the positive fan response to the completed effects for Medusa's hair was \\"vindication\\". However, Katharine Trendacosta at io9 felt the footage only made the series \\"look a less terrible\\" and noted \\"all the dialogue in these scenes are stilted and stiff.\\" Ethan Anderton with /Film enjoyed seeing Black Bolt communicate with sign language, but felt the footage was \\"more like a melodramatic soap opera\\" with \\"no power behind the drama\\" than something compelling like Game of Thrones. He also felt the fight choreography and editing was \\"clunky\\". For Medusa's hair, Anderton noted it \\"actually looks perfect when we see it animated in action... When her hair begins to move because of her heightened emotions, it looks natural and fantastic. But when it goes back to the practical wig, it looks abysmal.\\" He concluded that the series is \\"trying to have a compelling power struggle, but it doesn't come through in the performances\\", comparing it to Hercules: The Legendary Journeys and Xena: Warrior Princess.\\" In August, Rein√© said that he was not surprised by the reaction to the initial trailer because \\"it didn't give you the scope, it didn't give you a lot of secrets or visual effects. I felt it was a little bit too early because the visual effects were not ready‚ÄîMedusa's hair was not ready.\\" He felt the second trailer was better, and was happy with the fan response to it. Around that time, the first episode was released for critics to view ahead of the series' Television Critics Association (TCA) press tour panel, but initial reactions posted online were shortly taken down. At the TCA event, Dungey said the show is \\"still a work in progress. We're really down to the wire on some of the special effects.\\" Loeb reiterated this, responding to questions from critics of the first episode's quality not being \\"IMAX-centric\\" by saying, \\"the show you have seen is not the finished product\\". The panel was cut short by ABC, and was widely considered by critics in attendance to be \\"awkward\\" and \\"uncomfortable\\". Later in the month, a new teaser for the series focusing on the different characters appeared to show Medusa's hair having been \\"improved\\", though /Film's Hoai- Tran Bui felt that the teaser otherwise \\"doesn't do much more to convince me that this series won't be a hot mess ... [it] still seems to be suffering from its quick, shoddy production so that it could make the bewildering IMAX premiere\\". RelishMix, which analyzes activity across all major social platforms, said the release strategy of the episodes in IMAX had caused confusion among fans, with some believing it to be a film rather than episodes of a television series. Of the fans aware of the IMAX premiere, many \\"expressed the notion that IMAX is too expensive and they will wait for the television premiere\\", while the service noted fan skepticism surrounding the characters and production value, and negative comparisons of the visual effects to those in the MCU films. Release Theatrical The theatrical version had its premiere in Los Angeles at Universal CityWalk on August 28, 2017, and debuted on 667 IMAX screens in 67 countries on September 1, 2017. It ran for two weeks, though, as with all IMAX releases, each theater can determine what it chooses to screen each week, resulting in Inhumans not remaining on IMAX screens at some theaters for the stated two weeks. The episodes premiered in IMAX theaters in Italy and Germany on September 15, and in Korea on September 22, eventually playing on more than 1,000 IMAX screens in over 74 countries. The producers worked with Marvel Studios so the theatrical debut of the series could be timed to not interfere with the release of any MCU films; the episodes were released between Spider-Man: Homecoming (July 7, 2017) and Thor: Ragnarok (November 3, 2017). Broadcast ABC broadcast the episodes as \\"Behold... The Inhumans\\" and \\"Those Who Would Destroy Us\\" on September 29, 2017. They featured 9 minutes of exclusive content not shown in the IMAX version. CTV aired the episodes in Canada. Sky One aired \\"Behold... The Inhumans\\" in the United Kingdom on October 25, 2017. Reception Expectations Foster said, ahead of the IMAX release, that the company expected Inhumans to be more successful at the box office than what they had previously released in the theatrical window beginning September 1, which was generally the re-release of an old film, but whether the project was considered a success or not would depend on its ratings performance on television. The hope was that regular IMAX customers that would not have watched the series on ABC would do so after being introduced to it with the theatrical release. Box office The IMAX presentation of the episodes grossed $3.5 million worldwide. It earned $500,000 on its opening day in the United States and Canada, and earned $1.36 million over the 4-day Labor Day weekend. Outside the United States and Canada, the episodes earned $1.1 million from 65 markets. Box office analyst Jeff Bock of Exhibitor Relations called the opening weekend earnings \\"ho-hum\\", believing average film-goers did not know what the series was, or \\"certainly didn't know it was debuting in theaters before its TV debut.\\" The $3.5 million gross was considered a disappointment by IMAX, with IMAX CEO Rich Gelfond blaming the poor reception and gross on \\"misalignment of customer expectations\\": \\"Customers expected a production akin to a mega-budget blockbuster movie, rather than pilots for a television show. Moreover, the fact that this was Marvel IP set the bar at a level you wouldn't see from other pieces of content or IP because of the reputation and the high production value of Marvel movies.\\" Ratings In the United States for the television broadcast on ABC, the episodes received a 0.9/4 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, according to Nielsen Media Research. That means the episodes were seen by 0.9 percent of all households, and 4 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. The two episodes were watched by 3.75 million viewers. Within a week of their broadcast, the episodes had been watched by 5.58 million U.S. viewers. Critical response IGN's Joshua Yehl gave the episodes a 4.0 out of 10, calling the episodes disappointing, not living up to the \\"usual Marvel standard\\". He felt the costumes and makeup looked like cosplay, the dialogue was \\"clunky\\", as if it was from the first draft of a script\\", and the story did not \\"have the scope, scale, or polish to make use of\\" the IMAX release. He also criticized the episode recap flashbacks halfway through the IMAX version, and felt that having Buck as showrunner, who also worked on the poorly reviewed first season of Iron Fist, \\"speaks volumes as to why Inhumans is just as misguided in its approach and execution.\\" David Pepose of Newsarama also gave the episodes a 4 out of 10, feeling \\"Buck's instincts to rely more on his characters than on his plot is a good instinct‚Äîbut because the acting and the production values seem so wooden, that makes the overall arc of this series seem more threadbare than ambitious\\". Pepose ultimately called the episodes aimless, with an obvious network television style and budget. Writing for Digital Spy, Morgan Jeffrey also had negative thoughts on the episodes. Despite calling Mount \\"the show's MVP\\", enjoying the \\"visually epic\\" location shots of Hawaii and CGI vista, and feeling \\"the themes at the heart of the series [were] compelling, with plenty of potential,\\" he took issue with the \\"flat, uninspired screenplay\\" from Buck. He concluded that Inhumans was \\"the weakest entry in the MCU to date, across screens big and small. A severe throwback to the mostly underwhelming comic book adaptations of the pre-Iron Man age, this looks to be a serious misstep\\". Giving the episodes a 1 out of 5, Kim Taylor-Foster of Fandom felt the episodes were \\"a massive letdown\\" and were \\"largely stripped of personality and flair\\". Taylor-Foster felt various moments in the episodes came across as funny, when they were not meant to be, the characters were underdeveloped, and the IMAX aspect of the episodes was \\"kind of wasted\\". Although she felt Lockjaw was the series \\"main saving grace\\", ultimately, \\"In concentrating on making a splash with its IMAX premiere, [the episodes] refuses to push boundaries in other, more important areas. [That] means a lackluster beginning to a series that was meant to wow.\\" Charles Pulliam-Moore from io9 had mixed feelings on the episodes, calling them \\"neither good nor bad\\", feeling they set up a \\"grand, sweeping narrative in which every major player is on a distinct personal journey that would make for an excellent season of television\\" but were hindered by the show's budget. Pulliam-Moore specifically noted how Atillan looked like badly rendered video game cutscenes, that interior scenes were clearly shot on a sound stage, and Medusa's hair movement seemed to be created with the caliber of special effects from a 1990s film. Giving the episodes a \\"C+\\", TVLine's Matt Webb Mitovich said the episodes felt \\"'small' and even claustrophobic at times, especially in the Attilan interiors. The city itself is 'Positano by way of cement mixer', an uninteresting mish-mash of blocky, CGI'd dwellings... Even Hawaii, where the Earth-bound action is set, looks a bit bland, save for some establishing flyover shots.\\" He criticized the storytelling, such as the unclear depiction of Karnak's powers, but was more positive on the second episode. Giving the episodes a \\"C-\\", Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly felt they included every boring way to portray a fantasy civilization, and were already \\"stalling, or running out the clock... [Inhumans] represents all the worst instincts of Marvel's TV arm.\\" Collider's Allison Keene gave the episodes 1 star out of 5, calling them \\"an incredible mess\\" and feeling the episodes got better when imagining them as a comedy. Keene felt some of the bright spots of the episodes were Lockjaw, and Medusa once she is exiled to Earth, but ultimately concluded, \\"Marvel's excessively miscalculated series is nearly performance art. It's theater of the absurd. Or maybe it's just a sloppy and hastily thrown together TV show to satisfy a corporate obligation\\". Maureen Ryan, writing for Variety, felt Iron Fist looked \\"like Citizen Kane next to this slapped-together, incoherent, cheap-looking mess... Even for those of us who review TV programs for a living, it's difficult to capture the breadth, depth and scope of Inhumans awfulness... The characters are somehow less than one-dimensional, the story is beyond predictable, and everything looks cheaper than a Doctor Who serial from 40 years ago.\\" Notes References External links Inhumans (TV series) 2017 American television episodes Inhumans Familicide in fiction IMAX films Marvel Cinematic Universe episodes ","title":"Inhumans premiere"},{"id":"55090525","text":"BrainBuzz is an Australian children's show on 9Go! from 19 February 2018, starring Kellyn Morris, scientist Clare Van Dorssen and \\"Einstein\\", played by Michael Balk.

They reported that some 60 men remained aboard, principally lascars and sepoys. Next morning when boats went out the rescuers found that the wreck was mostly under water. They were able to retrieve two white seamen and five lascars. Some 50 men, however had died, including the boatswain and another white man. The prize master had brought out some three or four trunks, and Yankee had also taken out some valuables. General Wellesley had been carrying 18,000 bars of iron, plus some dry goods, brandy, porter, and the like.

The variety of Jimmy Ritchey's music-industry contributions is as impressive as the speed with which he has accomplished them. In the span of just over a decade, he has co-written four top-10 hits, produced albums for more than 10 artists, played on dozens of recording sessions and created his own song-publishing company. He has also toured coast-to-coast as a road musician.  Early Life  Ritchey grew up in a musical family in Lewis County in Washington state. His great-great grandparents had a band and both grandmothers were musicians along with several of his uncles. He began playing in childhood and went on to master the mandolin, acoustic guitar, banjo, bass, fiddle and electric guitar. In his late teens, he started commuting to Seattle where he was hired as an accompanist by various country stars such as Bobby Bare, Ferlin Husky and Del Reeves, when they were touring in the Pacific Northwest. In between these gigs, Ritchey played in local grunge-rock bands.  Career  Ritchey's career took hold shortly after his move to Nashville in 1995 with the goal of using his talent to take him on the road in tour buses and into recording studios. Within months of arriving, he was hired to go on the road with Ronna Reeves followed by a stint with Kid Lonesome. This led to an introduction to singer Tommy Shane Steiner and eventually the opportunity to produce Steiner's album with RCA. The record label initially wanted producers Paul Worley and Frank Liddell to produce the album, but after encouragement from both, agreed to allow Ritchey to produce it. In 2010, Ritchey opened Vibe Room Music, a collaborative venture with the late publishing veteran Jeff Carlton and several talented songwriters, including country stars Sam Hunt and Pam Tillis. Ritchey co-wrote several songs that have charted on Hot Country Songs: * I'm a Saint (Mark Chesnutt) * I Gotta Get to You (George Strait) * Twang (George Strait) * Something About a Woman (Jake Owen) * Don't Think I Can't Love You (Jake Owen) * Startin' with Me (Jake Owen) * The One That Got Away (Jake Owen) He signed an exclusive agreement with BMG Chrysalis on December 3, 2012. Ritchey has had over 40 songs recorded by major-label artists. As a record producer, he has worked with Owen, Chesnutt, Greg Bates, and Clay Walker. Ritchey is currently managing emerging Sony country artist Robert Counts and recently returned from a tour in Germany. He also performed with Ellinor Springstrike in the 2019 \\"An American Christmas\\" held in Umea, Sweden. He was recently honored to be named 2020 Distinguished Alumnus by the Centralia College Foundation.  Community Involvement  Ritchey spends a significant amount of time in the community, volunteering at local schools to mentor and instruct students. His success has allowed him to give back to organizations by donating his time and talents, performing at events to raise funds, most recently for Leukemia/Lymphoma, Operation Song for Veterans, and the March of Dimes.

He began his ecclesiastical career during the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas.  Biography  Manuel Lorenzo Estanislao Velarde was born on August 10, 1822 in Buenos Aires, son of Camilo de la Vega Velarde de la C√°mara and Mar√≠a de Bel√©n In√©s Fabre Rivero, belonging to a distinguished family. He had been baptized on September 6 of the same year by the priest Domingo Estanislao Belgrano, Chantre of Buenos Aires Cathedral. His maternal grandfather, Don Agust√≠n Fabre, was a Spanish doctor, who served in the Protomedicato del R√≠o de la Plata. Velarde was ordained a priest for the year 1844, serving in the parish of Nuestra Se√±ora del Socorro. He was involved in the escape Uladislao Guti√©rrez, presbyter of Socorro, who had had an unlawful relationship with Camila O'Gorman. At the request of the O'Gorman family, Velarde delayed informing the authorities of the departure of the city of Guti√©rrez. In 1854, Velarde was chosen to occupy the parish of San Jos√© de Flores. Being the priest of Flores, he had taught practices related to ecclesiastical protocols to Mariano Antonio Espinosa (archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1900). Later he was parish priest of the Parish of Montserrat, being in charge of the inauguration of the new temple on September, 10, 1865.

It has been used for examining issues such as the incidence of persistent poverty; assets and income in the transition to retirement; the correlates and impact of changes in physical and mental health; and an international comparison of wealth and happiness. The survey is widely used by Australian and international researchers in the fields of economics, social science and social policy and by the Australian Government. The HILDA survey is managed by a small team from the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at the University of Melbourne and the national fieldwork is carried out by ACNielsen and Roy Morgan Research. The survey is funded by the Australian Government through the Department of Social Services. HILDA has the following key features: *It collects information about economic and subjective well-being, labour market dynamics and family dynamics. *Special questionnaire modules are included each wave and have covered topics such as wealth, retirement and fertility intentions. *The wave 1 panel consisted of 7,682 households and 19,914 individuals. In wave 11 this was topped up with an additional 2,153 households and 5,477 individuals *Interviews are conducted annually with all adult members of each household. Children are interviewed once they turn 15. *The panel members are followed over time. *Funding has been guaranteed for 18 waves, and the survey is expected to continue beyond wave 18. *Data releases occur at the start of December. The release in December 2019 was for data collected from 2001 (wave 1) to 2018 (wave 18). HILDA data, when weighted, describe the Australian population (excluding those not living in households). The datasets (PSPP/SPSS, SAS and Stata files) are available for legitimate research purposes and application can be made from the HILDA website. The data are confidentialised by suppression of geographic and other identifying information. A bibliography of published research, the survey methodology, the questionnaires and a user manual are available from the HILDA website. HILDA data are integrated into the Cross-National Equivalent File (CNEF) which contains population panel data from Australia, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Korea, Switzerland, Russia and the United States.

Life 3.0 discusses Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its impact on the future of life on Earth and beyond. The book discusses a variety of societal implications, what can be done to maximize the chances of a positive outcome, and potential futures for humanity, technology and combinations thereof.  Summary  The book begins by positing a scenario in which AI has exceeded human intelligence and become pervasive in society. Tegmark refers to different stages of human life since its inception: Life 1.0 referring to biological origins, Life 2.0 referring to cultural developments in humanity, and Life 3.0 referring to the technological age of humans. The book focuses on \\"Life 3.0\\", and on emerging technology such as artificial general intelligence that may someday, in addition to being able to learn, be able to also redesign its own hardware and internal structure. The first part of the book looks at the origin of intelligence billions of years ago and goes on to project the future development of intelligence. Tegmark considers short-term effects of the development of advanced technology, such as technological unemployment, AI weapons, and the quest for human-level AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). The book cites examples like Deepmind and OpenAI, self-driving cars, and AI players that can defeat humans in Chess, Jeopardy, and Go. After reviewing current issues in AI, Tegmark then considers a range of possible futures that feature intelligent machines or humans. The fifth chapter describes a number of potential outcomes that could occur, such altered social structures, integration of humans and machines, and both positive and negative scenarios like Friendly AI or an AI apocalypse. Tegmark argues that the risks of AI come not from malevolence or conscious behavior per se, but rather from the misalignment of the goals of AI with those of humans. Many of the goals of the book align with those of the Future of Life Institute. The remaining chapters explore concepts in physics, goals, consciousness and meaning, and investigate what society can do to help create a desirable future for humanity.  Reception  Professor Max Tegmark, author of Our Mathematical Universe. One criticism of the book by Kirkus Reviews is that some of the scenarios or solutions in the book are a stretch or somewhat prophetic: \\"Tegmark's solutions to inevitable mass unemployment are a stretch.\\" AI researcher Stuart J. Russell, writing in Nature, said: \\"I am unlikely to disagree strongly with the premise of Life 3.0. Life, Tegmark argues, may or may not spread through the Universe and 'flourish for billions or trillions of years' because of decisions we make now ‚Äî a possibility both seductive and overwhelming.\\" Writing in Science, Haym Hirsh called it \\"a highly readable book that complements The Second Machine Age's economic perspective on the near-term implications of recent accomplishments in AI and the more detailed analysis of how we might get from where we are today to AGI and even the superhuman AI in Superintelligence.\\" The Telegraph called it \\"One of the very best overviews of the arguments around artificial intelligence\\". The Christian Science Monitor said \\"Although it's probably not his intention, much of what Tegmark writes will quietly terrify his readers.\\" Publishers Weekly gave a positive review, but also stated that Tegmark's call for researching how to maintain control over superintelligent machines \\"sits awkwardly beside his acknowledgment that controlling such godlike entities will be almost impossible.\\" Library Journal called it a \\"must-read\\" for technologists, but stated the book was not for the casual reader. The Wall Street Journal called it \\"lucid and engaging\\"; however, it cautioned readers that the controversial notion that superintelligence could run amok has more credence than it does few years ago, but is still fiercely opposed by many computer scientists. Rather than endorse a specific future, the book invites readers to think about what future they would like to see, and to discuss their thoughts on the Future of Life Website. The Wall Street Journal review called this attitude noble but naive, and criticized the referenced Web site for being \\"chockablock with promo material for the book\\". The hardcover edition was on the general New York Times Best Seller List for two weeks, and made on the New York Times business bestseller list in September and October 2017. Former President Barack Obama included the book in his \\"best of 2018\\" list. Business magnate Elon Musk (who had previously endorsed the thesis that, under some scenarios, advanced AI could jeopardize human survival) recommended Life 3.0 as \\"worth reading\\".https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/29/elon-musk- recommends-a-book-on-the-future-of-artificial-intelligence.html  References   External links  * Excerpt from the book * (a video commissioned by Tegmark's FLI to explain the book) * Survey associated with the book 2017 non-fiction books Existential risk from artificial general intelligence Futurology books ","title":"Life 3.0"},{"id":"55090847","text":"The 1953 Summer Deaflympics officially known as 7th Deaflympics is an international multi-sport event that was held from 15 August 1953 to 19 August 1953.

As of 2016, it is in phase II clinical trials for depression and Alzheimer's disease and phase I trials for dementia and mild cognitive impairment. Tulrampator is a \\"high-impact\\" AMPAR potentiator, unlike \\"low-impact\\" AMPAR potentiators like CX-516 and its congener farampator (CX-691, ORG-24448), and is able to elicit more robust increases in AMPAR activation. In animals, high-impact AMPAR potentiators enhance cognition and memory at low doses, but produce motor coordination disruptions, convulsions, and neurotoxicity at higher doses. Tulrampator itself has been found in animals to enhance cognition and memory, to produce antidepressant-, antianhedonic-, and anxiolytic-like effects, and to have neurotrophic and neuroplasticity-promoting activities. Moreover, it has been found to increase levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus and to stimulate hippocampal neurogenesis. The rapidly-acting antidepressant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine appear to be mediated through indirect/downstream activation of AMPARs. This is evidenced by the fact that its antidepressant-like effects in animals are blocked by the AMPAR antagonist NBQX. As such, tulrampator may be a rapid-acting antidepressant similarly to ketamine but without its dissociative/hallucinogenic and certain other adverse effects (e.g., urotoxicity).

Born in England in 1873, Pope worked as a clerk in the Great Northern Railway before emigrating to Western Australia in 1895. He continued to work in the railways but also served in the Western Australian Military Forces. He volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on the outbreak of the First World War and was appointed a battalion commander. He served during the Gallipoli Campaign and later on the Western Front, where he commanded the 14th Brigade. In July 1916 he was sacked at the conclusion of the Attack at Fromelles, on his commanding officer's belief that he was drunk. Sent home to Australia despite his claims of innocence, he agitated to be returned to active duty. In March 1917 he was successful and was made commander of the 52nd Battalion. Wounded during the Battle of Messines, he was repatriated to Australia in early 1918. After the war he was appointed Commissioner of Railways in Western Australia and implemented a number of changes to a rail service in difficulties. He resigned from the role on account of his health in 1928 and died ten years later in Perth. Early life Harold Pope was born in England, at the town of Ealing, Middlesex on 16 October 1873. His father, Edward Pope, was a solicitor. He attended a school at Margate and at St. Saviour's College in Ardingly. When he was 16, he began working as a clerk at the Great Northern Railway. In 1895, he emigrated to Western Australia and found employment on the railways. The following year he married Susan Matilda Slater at Albany. He joined the Western Australian Military Forces in 1900, initially serving as a second lieutenant. By 1908, he had risen in rank to lieutenant colonel. First World War Following the outbreak of the First World War, Pope volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and was given command of the 16th Battalion. He took part in the Landing at Anzac Cove late in the day on 25 April 1915 and secured a gap in the defences at a feature that would soon be known as Pope's Hill. He continued to lead his battalion over the next months, including through the Battle for Baby 700 and Battle of Sari Bair. In October 1915, he briefly commanded the 4th Brigade before being evacuated sick later that month. By this stage of the campaign he had been mentioned in despatches and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. On recovering his health, Pope, resumed command of the 16th Battalion. On 1 May 1916, he was promoted temporary brigadier general and appointed commander of the 14th Brigade, part of the 5th Division, which was training in Egypt. It was soon transferred to the Western Front and from 19 to 20 July 1916, the brigade was involved in the Attack at Fromelles during which it suffered over 2,000 casualties. Pope became exhausted as a result of preparing for the battle and conducting his command during the fighting. After having ordered his brigade to withdraw on the second day of the battle, he fell asleep and was unable to be roused by his commanding officer, Major General James M'Cay. Pope was sacked as brigade commander the next day, M'Cay believing that he was drunk. Denying this allegation, Pope sought a court martial to present witnesses and argue his case. The AIF commander, Lieutenant General William Birdwood did not permit the court martial. Having lost his temporary rank, Pope returned to Australia and was discharged from the AIF. Determined to restore his reputation, he agitated the Australian Government for a return to the Western Front. He secured an unpaid position as a continuous service officer aboard a transport ship, the Hororata, which was sailing for England. Once there, he continued to present his case for a return to active duty. Eventually Birdwood offered to make him commander of the 52nd Battalion. He took his new command on March 1917 and led it during the Battle of Messines in June. Wounded at Messines, he was sent home in early 1918, having received a further mention in despatches. Promoted colonel on 31 May and, still seeking a role in the war effort, he performed duties on transport ships in 1919. Later life In March 1919, Pope returned to Western Australia and later in the year was made that state's acting Commissioner of Railways. The appointment was made permanent the following year. His work was demanding and he had to deal with the consequences of poor management by the previous administration, implementing several changes. Having completed the five-year term of the role, in 1925 he was reappointed for a further term. Concurrent with his second term as Commissioner of Railways, Pope was honorary colonel of the 16th Battalion. In 1926, he served for a year as aide-de-camp to the Governor-General of Australia. His health declined and in 1928 he resigned. Pope died of heart disease on 13 May 1938 in a hospital at Perth, where he had been under care for several months. He was survived by his wife and five children. His family declined an offer of a full military funeral and he was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery in Perth.

History The house was built in 1881-1882 in the Queen Anne style with horizontal lines, a clipped gable, and a short tower. It was constructed for Dominga de Go√±i Atherton after the death of her husband Faxon Dean Atherton. She was the mother-in-law of novelist Gertrude Atherton, who wrote about the house in her memoirs. The architect is thought to have been John Marquis, but it has also been attributed to the Moore Brothers, who are depicted in other accounts as the initial builders. Newspaper articles about the house when the housewarming was held in 1882 described it as picturesque, but appearing to be a relic of an earlier time. The reporter also noted that the height of the rooms created a claustrophobic effect on visitors. Possibly in answer to the comments, Dominga hired Charles Lee Tilden to improve the house. After Dominga Atherton's death in 1890, the mansion was sold to Edgar Mills, brother of Darius Ogden Mills of the Bank of California, and in 1900 was renumbered from 1950 to 1990 California St. In 1908 it was purchased by George Chauncey Boardman, a real-estate magnate and president of San Francisco Fire Insurance, whose house had been destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire. His widow and other family members lived there until 1923, when it was bought by Charles J. Rousseau, an architect, who subdivided it into 13 apartments. His widow Carrie lived there with fifty cats until her death in 1974. it was still subdivided. The house is reportedly haunted by as many as four ghosts, including Carrie Rousseau, and is featured on ghost tours. The commonly cited story is that the original ghost is George H. B. Atherton, who died at sea in the South Pacific in 1887 and whose body was shipped back to San Francisco in a rum barrel, but the barrel was delivered to the docks, not to the house. The style of the house, a blend of Queen Anne and Stick-Eastlake, has been described as both \\"eclectic\\" and \\"bizarre\\".

Some individuals detransition on a temporary basis. Desistance is a related term used to describe the cessation of transgender identity or gender dysphoria and has a higher occurrence. Direct, formal research of detransition is lacking. Professional interest in the phenomenon has been met with contention. Background and terminology Transition is the process of a transgender person changing their gender presentation and/or sex characteristics to accord with their internal sense of gender identity.; Transition commonly involves social changes (such as clothing, personal name, and pronouns), legal changes (such as legal name and legal gender), and medical/physical changes (such as hormone replacement therapy and sex reassignment surgery). Detransition (sometimes called retransition) is the process of halting or reverting a transgender identification or gender transition. *Detransition' refers to reidentification with the gender identity given at birth and a conscious decision to take action to revert to that designation.\\" . See also ; ; ; ; ; ; . Like transition, detransition is not a single event. Methods of detransitioning can vary greatly among individuals, and can involve changes to one's gender expression, social identity, legal identity documents, and/or anatomy.; ; ; Desistance is a general term for any cessation,; and it is commonly applied specifically to the cessation of transgender identity or gender dysphoria.; ; Those who undertake detransition are known as detransitioners.; ; Detransition is commonly associated with transition regret, but regret and detransition do not always coincide. *\\"Not everyone who detransitions regrets transitioning in the first place, and, like transitioning, the process of deciding to detransition is a very individual and personal choice.\\" . See also ; . Occurrence Formal studies of detransition have been few in number, *\\"There is a paucity of literature.\\" *\\"We urgently need systematic data on this point in order to inform best practice clinical care.\\" of disputed quality, *\\"The research on outcomes post-transition is mixed at best.\\" and politically controversial. *\\"[R]esearch in this field is extremely controversial.\\" Frequency estimates for detransition and desistance vary greatly, with notable differences in terminology and methodology.Detransition estimates: *\\"Eight percent of respondents to the 2015 [U.S. Transgender] Survey reported detransitioning at some point, that is, returning to living as the gender they were assigned at birth; however, most detransitioned only temporarily, and 62 percent of those who had once detransitioned reported living in their felt gender identity.\\" *\\"Detransitioning after surgical interventions ... is exceedingly rare. Research has often put the percentage of regret between 1 and 2% ... Detransitioning is actually far more common in the stages before surgery, when people are still exploring their options. 'There are people who take hormones and then decide to go off hormones,' says Randi Ettner, a therapist who has served on the board of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health. 'That is not uncommon.'\\" **\\"There were 15 (5 [female-to-male] and 10 [male-to-female]) regret applications corresponding to a 2.2% regret rate for both sexes. There was a significant decline of regrets over the time period.\\" (Dhejne et al. define \\"regret\\" as \\"application for reversal of the legal gender status among those who were sex reassigned\\" which \\"gives the person the right to treatment to reverse the body as much as possible.\\") Desistance estimates: *\\"There is a wealth of replicated research that tells us that 80‚Äì95% of children who experience a cross-sex identification in childhood will eventually desist and come to identify with their natal sex as adults.\\" *\\"Only very few trans- kids still want to transition by the time they are adults. Instead, they generally turn out to be regular gay or lesbian folks. The exact number varies by study, but roughly 60‚Äì90% of trans- kids turn out no longer to be trans by adulthood.\\" Detransition is more common in the earlier stages of transition, particularly before surgeries. It is estimated that the number of detransitioners ranged from less than one per cent to as many as five per cent. A 2018 survey of WPATH (World Professional Association for Transgender Health) surgeons found that approximately 0.3% of patients who underwent transition-related surgery later requested detransition-related surgical care. Desistance rates among young children may be higher. Of children referred to gender clinics for either gender dysphoria or gender non-conformity, a 2008 study found 61% desisted from their gender incongruence or nonconformity before reaching the age of 29,; and a 2013 study found 63% desisted before age 20. A 2019 clinical assessment found that 9.4% of patients with adolescent-emerging gender dysphoria either ceased wishing to pursue medical interventions or no longer felt that their gender identity was incongruent with their assigned sex at birth within an eighteen-month period. Research prior to 2000 might report inflated numbers of desistance, as gender- nonconforming children without gender dysphoria might have been included in studies. A 2003 German study found evidence for an increase in the number of demands for detransition, blaming poor practice on the part of \\"well-meaning but certainly not unproblematic\\" clinicians who‚Äîcontrary to international best practices‚Äîassumed that transitioning as quickly as possible should be the only correct course of action.\\"In j√ºngster Zeit gibt es jedoch einige Hinweise f√ºr die Zunahme von R√ºckumwandulungsbegehren und es stellen sich zunehmend Patienten vor, bei denen schondie erste diagnostische Exploration Hinweise auf √ºbergreifende Identit√§tsst√∂rungen, u. U. auch auf transvestitisch- fetischistische Neigungen, auf unrealistische Erwartungen hin-sichtlich eines ‚Äûv√∂llig neuen Lebens‚Äú, jedoch nicht auf eine gelebte und innerlich fixierteGeschlechtsrollentransposition gibt. In Anbetracht derartiger Verl√§ufe besorgt die zwarwohlmeinende, aber keinesfalls unproblematische Einstellung einiger Behandler, die annehmen, dass das m√∂glichst schnelle Bedienen der vehement vorgetragenen Patienten-w√ºnsche die einzig richtige Vorgehensweise w√§re,‚Äûda man da sowieso nichts anderes machen kann.‚Äú Dies widerspricht eklatant den Erfahrungen internationaler Gender-Zentren\\" Detransitioners have commonly cited trauma, isolation, dissociation, inadequate mental healthcare, and social pressure as motivations for pursuing transition. Informed consent and affirmation of self-diagnosis (both newer but increasingly employed models for transgender healthcare) have been criticized for failing to meet the needs of those who eventually detransition.; ; Among eventual detransitioners, the progression of transition has been found to magnify, rather than remedy, gender dysphoria. Sufferers may fixate on passing (being perceived as their preferred gender), leading them to pursue ever further steps in medical transition. Motives for detransitioning commonly include financial barriers to transition, social rejection in transition, depression or suicidality due to transition, and discomfort with sexual characteristics developed during transition. Additional motives include concern for lack of data on long-term effects of hormone replacement therapy, concern for loss of fertility, complications from surgery, and changes in gender identity. *\\"Six persons clearly ventilated their feelings of regret about the decision; three of them accused their clinician of incompetence. Four others respectively gave as primary reasons: social isolation, disappointing surgical results and a sudden vanishing of the urge to live as a woman.\\" . See also ; ; ; ; ; ; . Some people detransition on a temporary basis, in order to accomplish a particular aim, such as having biologically related children, or until barriers to transition have been resolved or removed.; Transgender elders may also detransition out of concern for whether they can receive adequate or respectful care in later life. A qualitative study comparing child desisters to persisters (those with persisting gender dysphoria) found that while persisters related their dysphoria primarily to a mismatch between their bodies and their identity, desisters' dysphoria was more likely to be, at least retroactively, related to a desire to fulfill the other gender role. Most childhood desisters go on to identify as cisgender and gay or lesbian.  Individual accounts  Mike Penner, a sportswriter for the Los Angeles Times, publicly identified as transsexual in April 2007 under the name Christine Daniels and wrote of his experience with transition until October 2008, when he resumed his male identity. He died by suicide in November 2009.; ; Since 2011, Walt Heyer has written several books and a USA Today editorial on his experience of regret and detransition.; Carey Callahan began speaking openly about her detransition in 2016. Callahan identified as trans for four years. Her employment at a gender clinic led her to seek alternatives to transition. She advocates for detransitioners and gender-nonconforming people while working as a licensed therapist. She was profiled by The Atlantic in 2018.; ; ; ; Longtime New York performance artist Brian Belovitch (formerly known as Tish Gervais) transitioned in 1972, following social pressure to conform his feminine personality to binary gender norms. He lived as a trans woman for fifteen years before \\"retransitioning\\", as he terms it, in 1987. Belovitch cites his changed views on his own gender identity (referring to himself now as \\"genderqueer or gender nonconforming\\") for prompting his reversal. He was profiled by Paper magazine in 2018; he published his memoir later that year.; In March 2019, James Shupe, the first American to win legal recognition of having a nonbinary gender, criticized his transition and publicly re- identified as a man. Shupe had lived as a trans woman for two years and as a nonbinary person for three.; ; In 2020, 23-year-old Keira Bell joined a lawsuit against the NHS Gender Identity Development Service. Bell was prescribed puberty blockers at age 16 and testosterone a year later, and had her breasts removed before stopping hormone treatments and reidentifying as a woman. She states that she should have been \\"challenged more\\" by the gender clinic, criticising the lack of therapy or questioning she received before being prescribed the puberty blockers. The lawsuit will argue that minors cannot give informed consent to transitioning treatments.  Transitioning after detransitioning  The 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey collected responses from individuals who identified as transgender at the time of the survey. 8% of those who had transitioned reported having ever detransitioned; 62% of that group were living as a gender other than the one assigned to them at birth at the time of the survey.; Marissa Dainton surgically transitioned to a woman in 1993. Four years after that, she had joined an evangelical church, and decided to resume a male identity, because she viewed her first transition as sinful. When she married a woman from the congregation, she had her surgically-constructed vagina removed, leaving her without genitalia. However, she continued to crossdress in secret, and in 2003 decided to transition again. She obtained breast implants, but decided against constructing a new vagina due to possible complications from the type of procedure it would require the second time. Sam Kane surgically transitioned to a woman in 1997, but seven years later had found life as a woman \\"shallow\\" and stated that men did not take her seriously in business as a woman. She transitioned back to a male gender role and had a new penis surgically constructed in 2004. She did not consider herself to have successfully returned to being a man, and stated, \\"Having become Samantha, I should have stayed Samantha.\\" She again transitioned into a female gender role, this time non-surgically, in 2017.  Cultural and political impact  There is a lack of legal, medical, and psychological guidelines on the topic of detransition and a perceived atmosphere of censorship around researching the phenomenon.; ; ; ; Detransitioners say they have been harassed by activists who view detransition as a political threat to trans rights. *\\"'The complexity of our viewpoint is pretty inconvenient to people on all sides of the political spectrum,' Carey says in the film. For her, detransitioning has resulted in the most harassment she has ever faced in her life.\\" *\\"This has ignited a contentious debate both in and outside the trans community, with various sides accusing each other of bigotry, harassment, censorship, and damaging the fight for trans rights. It's such a fraught issue that many people I interviewed requested anonymity. (All the names of detransitioners have been changed.) Others refused to speak on the record, afraid of the potential fallout.\\" *\\"[Other messages received] were from clinicians and detransitioners, thanking me for presenting a perspective they felt so many were scared to voice.\\" *\\"\\"[T]he trans community does our best to pretend that retransitioning never happens ... trans people who have retransitioned are often treated as outcasts, as aberrations or as an embarrassment to our community's goals. They are assumed to be failures, traitors to the cause of trans liberation.\\" Controversy surrounding detransition within trans activism primarily arises from how the subject is framed in mainstream media and right-wing politics. In August 2017, the Mazzoni Center's Philadelphia Trans Health Conference, which is an annual meeting of transgender people, advocates, and healthcare providers, canceled two panel discussions on detransition and alternate methods of working with gender dysphoria.; The conference organizers said, \\"When a topic becomes controversial, such as this one has turned on social media, there is a duty to make sure that the debate does not get out of control at the conference itself. After several days of considerations and reviewing feedback, the planning committee voted that the workshops, while valid, cannot be presented at the conference as planned.\\" In September 2017, Bath Spa University revoked permission for James Caspian, a Jungian psychotherapist who works with transgender people and is a trustee of The Beaumont Trust, to research regret of gender-reassignment procedures and pursuit of detransition.

Inspiration for the film came from Julio's deep sea diving experiences. Plot The film takes place in the post-apocalyptic future by the Atlantic Ocean, where, because of the actions of people, the planet Earth was subjected to an ecological catastrophe, and as a result the Earth was flooded. At the same time, sea inhabitants also suffered a catastrophe. Grimpoteuthis Kraken managed to save several inhabitants and formed a safe place to live with them. Kraken's grandson, Deep, considers life to be boring, but shows an interest in objects made by people. He also involves his friends: angler fish Evo and shrimp Alice. Soon one of Deep's \\"pranks\\" accidentally endangers the inhabitants of his home and encloses them by stones. Deep learns from Kraken that only the white whale Nathan can help them, and tells his grandson the necessary landmarks to identify where Nathan can be found. Deep, Evo and Alice set out to find Nathan. After passing several landmarks, the friends get to the sunken ship (which is the Titanic), where they find the vampire squid Norma. She makes them listen to her musical performance, and tells them that in order to find Nathan, they need to get to Broadway. The heroes leave the ship with difficulty, since Norma would not let them go. Along the way, Deep is attacked by moray Maura, but immediately after hearing from him that he has friends, she admits that she is lonely. Deep adds Maura to the team, despite the fact that Alice and Evo are against taking a predator that almost ate them on the first night. Having reached the Brooklyn Bridge, the friends find themselves surrounded by crabs, where their leader, the yeti crab Rico, challenges them to a dance battle. Alice's performance strikes Rico, and he falls in love with her. After that, the heroes pass the Brooklyn Bridge onto the streets of flooded New York City. They enter the radiation zone and overcome a number of un-dead fish. The characters have a disagreement when it becomes apparent they are lost, and everyone accuses Deep of taking them on a dangerous journey. They meet the penguin Darcy and his assistants: the walrus Luigi and the dolphin Ralph. While Darcy and Luigi distract the main characters by watching the film about the project \\"Ark-1\\" and \\"Ark-2\\" (which saved humans and ground animals respectively, by leaving the Earth and settling another planet), they discuss the plan to freeze them and leave the Earth on the \\"Ark-3\\" (which is for aquatic animals). When the heroes are placed in a trap, they finally met Nathan, who is chained, and immediately learn of Darcy's plan to freeze everyone, including Maura, who had not fallen into the trap. Deep, Alice and Evo manage to disable the cell without letting it freeze, and then get out of the locked cell and join Maura in battle against Darcy, Luigi and Ralph. As a result, they triumph over the trio and are ejected from the in-motion \\"Ark-3\\" along with Nathan and the other sea creatures. Returning home, the characters, along with Nathan, begin to free Kraken and the others, and Deep nearly sacrifices his life to completely free himself of the debris. After liberation, Maura offers an idea where it will be possible to start fertilizing and increase the population, while Deep finds love. Darcy, Ralph and Luigi are stranded on a floating ice floe in the Arctic Ocean near Greenland crying out for their mothers.

It was released on March 23, 2015 for Windows and Mac OS X, October 31, 2015 for iOS, and August 11, 2017 for Android.  Gameplay  The game is a roguelike that has been compared to Dungelot for the fact that the player explores levels by tapping on dark tiles to reveal them, but also adds \\"extensive RPG elements\\". The player can choose from six different classes and explores the level for keys as well as items. Each level has 56 tiles and the player can only move to the next level down by finding the stairs. To attack enemies, the player taps on the tile they are on, but each monster also has unique skills, like deflecting or absorbing damage. Enemies will usually counterattack only when attacked, unless they are ranged, while other enemies gradually get stronger if they are left alone. Wiping out all monsters on the floor gives the player an additional bonus. The player's own stats can be buffed by equipment, and items can give the player temporary advantages. Using items costs \\"Soul\\" points, making them only able to be used at specific times. The player can also sacrifice various things at altars to pledge themselves to a god and obtain a stat boost. When the player dies, they will bring back all of their money to their home base, allowing them to upgrade the base, buy characters or increase the power of abilities.  Plot  The game takes place in a town above a mysterious dungeon known as the Runestone Dungeon that is said to contain great power. Many different warriors come to descend into the depths of the dungeon, but they are all trapped forever within it. Each time the player defeats the final boss, the game's universe \\"resets\\", unbeknownst to the player character, although other NPCs are aware of this. Each run of the game ends with the final stanza of The Hollow Men.  Reception  Alexandru Chirila of Softpedia scored the game's demo 4/5 stars, calling it \\"a wonderful little dungeon crawler\\" and \\"a well-polished game even though it's still in the works\\".

Malik Kafur reached Warangal in January 1310, after conquering a fort on the Kakatiya frontier and ransacking their territory. After a month-long siege, the Kakatiya ruler Prataparudra decided to negotiate a truce, and surrendered a huge amount of wealth to the invaders, besides promising to send annual tributes to Delhi.  Background  In the early 13th century, the Deccan region of southern India was an immensely wealthy area, having been shielded from the foreign armies that had ransacked northern India. The Kakatiya dynasty ruled the eastern part of Deccan, with their capital at Warangal. In 1296, before Alauddin ascended the throne of Delhi, he had raided Devagiri, the capital of the Kakatiyas' neighbours Yadavas. The plunder obtained from Devagiri prompted him to plan an invasion of Warangal. After his conquest of Ranthambore in 1301, Alauddin had ordered his general Ulugh Khan to prepare for a march to Warangal, but Ulugh Khan's untimely death put an end to this plan.  1302-1303 expedition  In late 1302 or in early 1303, Alauddin himself marched to Chittor, and dispatched another army to Warangal. The army headed to Warangal was led by Malik Juna (or Jauna) and Malik Chajju (or Jhujhu). Malik Juna (Senior) was the son of Ghazi Malik, and held the office of dadbek-i-hazrat. Malik Chajju was a nephew of Alauddin's late general Nusrat Khan, and the governor of Kara. This Warangal campaign of 1302-1303 ended in a disaster, as attested by multiple medieval chroniclers. By the time this army returned close to Delhi in the winter of 1303, it had suffered severe losses in terms of men and baggage, and was unable to enter Delhi to help Alauddin fight against the Mongols, who had besieged Delhi. According to the 14th century chronicler Ziauddin Barani, this Delhi army had managed to reach Warangal, but decided to return because the rainy season had started. The 16th century chronicler Firishta states that this army was ordered to reach Warangal via Bengal, even though a shorter route passed through central India. Historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena suggests that this decision might have been taken because Alauddin had not yet conquered the Malwa region in central India. However, historian Kishori Saran Lal theorizes that Alauddin wanted to conquer Bengal, which had been a part of the Delhi Sultanate under the Mamluk dynasty, but had since become independent. Firishta simply states the Delhi army returned \\"confused and shattered without accomplishing anything\\": his writings do not clarify whether the army reached Warangal or not. Lal speculates that the Delhi army met with a humiliating defeat in Bengal, which was ruled by Shamsuddin Firoz. He theorizes that an embarrassed Alauddin decided to keep this failure a secret, which explains Barani's narrative. On the other hand, P. V. P. Sastry believes that a Kakatiya army repulsed the invaders at Upparapalli, based on Velugo·π≠ivƒÅri-Vam·π£avƒÅli, which states that two Kakatiya commanders destroyed the pride of the Turushkas (Turkic people).  Malik Kafur's march to Warangal  In 1308, Malik Kafur had defeated the Yadavas, the neighbours of the Kakatiyas, and the Yadava king Ramachandra had become a vassal of Alauddin. According to the Delhi courtier Amir Khusrau, Alauddin ordered Malik Kafur to invade the Kakatiya kingdom on 31 October 1309. As the Kakatiya territory was unfamiliar to the Delhi forces, Alauddin recommended lenient treatment of the troops, so as to avoid any resentment or revolt. He instructed Malik Kafur to cooperate closely with the officers such as Malik Sirajuddin and Ariz-i- Mumalik. He asked Kafur to respect the other commanders in the Delhi forces, but also cautioned him not to become too gentle which would make them disobedient. He advised Kafur not to remain in Kakatiya territory for long, and to accept a tribute from Prataparudra instead of bringing him to Delhi as a prisoner. Alauddin made arrangements for rapid communication of news about the expedition by establishing thanas (posts) all along the route from Tilpat near Delhi to the army's current position. At every post and town along the route, fast-running horses and news-writers were stationed. Along the roads, foot-runners were stationed at regular distances to carry messages. This arrangement ensured that Alauddin was updated about the army's situation in every 2‚Äì3 days. It also ensured that army was immune from any false rumors about the happenings in Delhi. Malik Kafur started his march from Delhi to Warangal with a huge army. He first visited his own fief of Rewari, and then continued his journey southwards. Nine days after starting its march, the army encamped at a place, whose modern identity is unknown. This place was either called Masudpur, or known after Masud, a son of Iltutmish. The army resumed its march on 13 November 1309, passing through a difficult terrain. Over the next 6 days, the army crossed five rivers at fords: Jun (identified as a small tributary of Yamuna); Chambal; Binas (identified with Banas, Kali Sindh or its tributary Niwaj); Kwari; and Bhoji (identified with Betwa or Pahuj). According to Amir Khusrau, Malik Kafur halted at a place called Sultanpur (also known as Irajpur) for four days. The modern identity of this place is not certain. Barani mentions that several amirs met Kafur at Chanderi, but Amir Khusrau does not mention Chanderi at all. Therefore, historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena suggests that Irajpur might be Irich near Chanderi. Kafur resumed his march on 25 November 1309, marching on a stony road. On 5 December 1309, he reached Khandar, whose modern identity is also uncertain. Here, he halted for 14 days to conduct a thorough review of the army. After resuming its march, the army crossed the Narmada River. Eight days later, the army reached Nilkanth, a place located within the frontier region of the Yadava kingdom. As the Yadava king was now a vassal of Alauddin, the army was instructed not to ransack the area. During the two-day halt at Nilkanth, Kafur made inquiries about the road ahead. He resumed his march on 30 December 1309. In Devagiri, Ramachandra provided the necessary support to the Delhi army. On the route connecting Devagiri to Warangal, he established markets, where Malik Kafur's soldiers could buy things at the rates fixed by Alauddin. He also reinforced the Delhi army with his own troops, and even escorted Malik Kafur for some distance. According to Khusrau, before entering the Kakatiya territory, the Delhi army halted at Bavagarh (misread as \\"Basiragarh\\" or \\"Bijainagar\\" by some translators). This place was located in a doab between the rivers Basihar (also Yashr or Bihar) and Baragi (or Buji), close to a diamond mine. It has been identified with modern Wairagarh in Gadchiroli district; the names of the rivers in Khusrau's writings appear to be corrupt: at least one of them must be Wainganga or one of its tributaries.  Fall of Sabar  After entering the Kakatiya territory, Malik Kafur started ransacking the towns and villages on his way to Warangal. The same day Malik Kafur reached Bavagarh, he led a cavalry unit to besiege Sabar, a fort located within the Kakatiya frontier region. Historian Kishori Saran Lal identifies Sabar with modern Sirpur. Khusrau's account suggests that this was a surprise attack for the defenders: faced with a certain defeat, some of them committed suicide with their wives and children in a jauhar fire. Some others, probably including the fort's commander, were killed after Kafur's soldiers entered the fort. The surviving defenders were ready to fight to death, but then a truce happened because of intervention by Khwaja Haji. Ananir (or Ananur), a brother of the fort's commander, was found hiding in a field. He surrendered to the invaders, and was appointed as the fort's new governor by Malik Kafur. Some of the refugees from Sabar fled to Warangal. The various Kakatiya feudatories marched to Warangal, instead of intercepting the Delhi army on the route leading to Warangal. This made Malik Kafur's job easier, as he had to now besiege just one fort: that of Warangal.  Warangal besieged  Ruins of the Warangal fort The Delhi army left Sabar on 14 January 1310, and on 18 January, it reached a place which Amir Khusrau calls \\"Kunarbal\\". While the inavders pitched their camp, Kafur dispatched a 1000-strong cavalry unit for reconnaissance. This unit captured Hanamkonda (\\"Anam Konda\\" in Khusrau's writings), from where the Warangal town was clearly visible. The unit encountered three Hindu horsemen, killed one of them, and sent his body to Malik Kafur. Malik Kafur examined the Warangal fort twice, before besieging it. The fortification at Warangal comprised an inner stone fort surrounded by a ditch, and an outer mud fort surrounded by a moat. The Kakatiya king Prataparudra lived in the inner stone fort. On 19 January 1310, Malik Kafur pitched his tent on the Hanamkonda hill. The Delhi commander Nasir-ul-mulk Siraj-ud-daula Khwaja Haji assigned his soldiers in such a way that the Warangal fort was completely surrounded. Every tuman (unit of 10,000 soldiers) was assigned a piece of land around the fort, and a strong wooden wall was constructed around the tents to secure them against attacks from the countryside. The Kakatiyas also assigned commanders to guard each tower (kangura) of the fort. According to the 16th century Telugu chronicle Pratapa-Charita, the outer fort had 70 bastions, each of which was defended by a nayaka (commander). The defenders threw stones and bricks at the attackers. One night, the Kakatiya governor Vinayaka Deva (also called Banik Deo or Manik-deva) led a sortie with a 1000-strong cavalry. Both the sides lost several soldiers in this conflict, but ultimately, the Kakatiyas were forced to abort their attack. During Vinayaka Deva's sortie, the invaders captured some of the defenders, who revealed that three elephants had been stationed at Dhamdum, a town near Warangal. The Delhi commander Malik Qara Beg Maisara was dispatched to seize these elephants. Although they were moved to another place, Qara Beg succeeded in capturing them. Malik Kafur ordered that stone balls be gathered for the stone-throwing machines (manjaniq maghribi) that were positioned all around the encircled fort, so presumably the defenders also had throwing machines and threw stone balls at Kafur's army. The invaders filled the outer moat at one place with mud, stones and other objects. They then advanced to the outer mud wall: on one side of the fort, the invaders broke the wall with blows of hard stones; on the other side, they breached several doors with the help of munjaniq siege engines. During the night of 13 February, Malik Kafur had his soldiers build tall ladders to scale the ramparts for a decisive assault. The next morning, the invaders launched a determined assault on the outer fort, and captured it by 16 February. The invaders now needed to cross the inner ditch, and breach the inner stone fort. However, this was a very challenging task: According to Khusrau, the walls of the inner fort were \\"so smooth that an ant could not climb them\\". The fort was so well-constructed that it was impossible to breach it using munjaniq siege engines or pick-axes.  Prataparudra's surrender  By this time, the people inside the Warangal fort were facing a dire situation because of the prolonged siege. As the invaders were thinking how to breach the inner fort, the Kakatiya ruler Prataparudra decided to surrender. According to Barani's account, once Alauddin did not receive any updates on the siege for over a month (presumably because the communication arrangements made by him had been disrupted by the enemy activities). He sent his emissary Qazi Mughisuddin of Bayana to the reputed Muslim saint Shaikh Nizamuddin Aulia, requesting the saint to prophesize the outcome of the siege. The saint prophesied Alauddin's victory in Warangal and in other future campaigns. On the same day, Alauddin received news about his army's victory in Warangal. The Muslim chroniclers state the Prataparudra sent Malik Kafur a golden statue of himself with a chain round its neck to symbolize his unconditional surrender. He offered the invaders a substantial amount of wealth including precious stones, elephants and horses. Malik Kafur, following Alauddin's instructions, asked him to surrender all his wealth, and threatened to massacre the city's population if he was found withholding any wealth. Prataparudra agreed to these terms. According to Barani, the wealth surrendered by him to Malik Kafur included 100 elephants, 7000 horses, and many precious articles. Amir Khan states that the total wealth surrendered by Prataparudra was \\"more than the minds of the wise could apprehend\\". He also jokingly prayed the God to keep Prataparudra alive till the day of the Last Judgment, because the Kakatiya ruler promised to pay a huge annual tribute to the Delhi Sultanate. Khsurau quotes a messenger of Prataparudra as saying that one of the surrendered precious stones was \\"unrivaled in the world\\": the wise philosophers refused to believe that such a substance could even exist. The 18th century chronicler Khafi Khan identified this precious stone as the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond. The invading army was not able to breach the inner fort of Warangal, and Prataparudra did not personally submit to Malik Kafur: only his envoys met the invaders to negotiate the truce. The 14th century chronicler Isami states that Malik Kafur also gifted Prataparudra a \\"robe of honour embroidered with jewels\\" after the peace treaty.  Aftermath  Malik Kafur started his return journey to Delhi on 20 March 1310, after conducting a review of his army. He reached Delhi on 9 June, via Devagiri, Dhar and Jhain. On 23 June 1310, Malik Kafur formally presented the loot from Warangal to Sultan Alauddin in a darbar organized at Chabutra-i Nasiri near the Badaun Gate. The loot was carried on a thousand camels, and arrangements were made for public to see the treasures. Alauddin was very pleased with Kafur, and rewarded him generously. In 1310, Prataparudra contributed the majority of the troops for Alauddin's campaigns against the Pandyas, his southern neighbours. Subsequently, he appears to have stopped paying tribute to the Delhi Sultanate. This resulted in another Delhi Sultanate expedition against him after Alauddin's death. In this 1318 expedition, Khusrau Khan extracted tribute from him. After the fall of the Khalji dynasty, Prataparudra was decisively defeated by an expedition sent by the Delhi Sultanate's new ruler Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq. He was captured, and according to most accounts, died while being taken to Delhi.

Chapella was the subject of study by anthropologist Gene Weltfish. Her artwork is part of the permanent collection of the Brooklyn Museum.  Personal life  In 1927, Chapella became the first Hopi to travel by airplane, when she flew to a pottery demonstration. From 1917 to 1955, Chapella worked as the cook for the Polacca Day School. In 1955 when Grace retired, the school personnel gave her a water spigot for her yard. At that time, plumbing was not common in Polacca, and Grace was the first person to have running water available at a private home. Several of her descendants also became potters.

In a case of hybrid resistance, the parental bone marrow (BM) graft is rejected by F1 generation in murine model. This rejection is caused by natural killer (NK) cells of the recipient. The model which describes this event is called \\"The missing self\\"..  The Mechanism  The rejection of parental (P) BM graft by F1 generation is caused by NK cells as was said. The activity of these cells (NK cells) is inhibited, if there is cell signaling through inhibitory receptors (Ly49 - mouse, KIR- human). These receptors recognized MHC I molecules on other cells and interact with them. If the inhibition is strong, it means there is signaling Ly49/KIR - MHC I, the inhibition of NK cell occurs. However, if there is no specific self MHC I (H2 alele in murine model) the inhibition of inhibition comes to pass. It means activation of NK cell. In a case of BM transplantation, where the F1 generation arise from two individuals with H2b/b and H2k/k MHC I phenotype. The F1 generation will be H2b/k. It means that there are NK cells in F1 generation, that recognize H2b/k aleles as a self MHC I and there has to be signaling through both of them to inhibition of NKs. But from the P can be only H2b/b or H2k/k transplanted, so the NKs won't be inhibited enough, because they need signals from both MHC I aleles. This event leads to parental graft rejection.

Popular among children ages 8 to 12, Dizzywood's online community grew rapidly, reaching over 400,000 monthly global visitors and was covered in multiple press outlets, among them The New York Times. Over three years, Dizzywood's collaborative world amassed over 1.5 million users. In 2010, Dizzywood was consolidated when San Mateo, California-based SecretBuilders bought Dizzywood's assets. The game world closed down 2010, but the website, with most of the content, remains online.  The Walt Disney Company  In June 2012, Arpajian became Vice President, Strategy and International of Disney Social Games, part of Disney Interactive, where he led business development, international operations and franchise strategy until July 2014.  Softonic  In February 2015, leading software download website Softonic announced that it had appointed Arpajian to the role of CEO, making him the first American senior executive for the Spanish company. Immediately upon joining the company, Arpajian made the crucial decision to discontinue the company's controversial Softonic Downloader product in order to regain user trust. Arpajian later launched Clean and Safe, an initiative to clean up the website's software catalog and ensure users a safe and secure user experience. Under Arpajian's leadership, after a period of economic stress, Softonic was able to return to profitability in just 7 months. This has led Softonic to begin considering expansion again.  Writing  Arpajian is the author of three books about technology: How to Use HTML3; How to Use HTML 3.2 (with Robert Mullen) and How to Use the World Wide Web (with Wayne Ause).  Personal life  Arpajian has been married to writer Kirsten Arpajian (n√©e Bollen) since 2002. They live in Barcelona, Spain with their two children.

He also achieved some distinction as an illustrator and cartoonist early on in his artistic career, and as an ongoing recorder (in rapid pencil and watercolour impressions) of Dublin street characters going about their daily business. Healy also occasionally painted in oil, both portraits and landscapes, exhibiting a small number of the latter during his lifetime. Early life and education Michael Healy was born in a tenement in Dublin's inner city and according to his friend of later years, C.P. Curran, \\"there was nothing in his parentage to turn him towards the arts, but nonetheless the child spent all his pennies on pencils and sat apart incessantly drawing\\"Curran, C.P. \\"Michael Healy: Stained Glass Worker, 1873 ‚Äì 1941\\", Studies, vol. 1, XXXI, March 1942, p.65and by fourteen he was out in the world earning his livelihood. The first record of Healy attending the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art (now National College of Art and Design) occurs in 1892 when he was eighteen years old. Around this time he felt he had a religious vocation which led him to present himself as a postulant lay-brother at the Dominican noviciate in Tallaght, Dublin, but he left after about two years. In 1895 he reenrolled in the DMSA and remained a student (part-time) for three years. According to Curran, Healy's peers were struck by his capacity for drawing and he considered a career in book illustration. In 1897 he secured a job as an illustrator on a new Dominican publication, The Irish Rosary, and subsequently due to the good offices of the editor, Fr Stephen Glendon, he ended up travelling to Florence where he attended the Life School of the Accademia di Belle Arti for eighteen months, an experience that was to have a profound influence on his artistic development.McGreevy, Thomas. \\"Michael Healy: Stained Glass Artist\\", The Irish Rosary, September/October 1942, p.501 In the spring of 1901 Healy returned to Ireland and was appointed art master at Newbridge College, County Kildare, where he found time to paint some portraits, though by the end of 1902 he had resigned. As C.P. Curran noted, \\"I think he lived through some difficult days at this period before he welcomed Miss Sarah Purser's invitation to join An T√∫r Gloine.\\"Curran, C.P. \\"Michael Healy: Stained Glass Worker, 1873 ‚Äì 1941\\", Studies, vol. 1, XXXI, March 1942, p.65 It was not until January 1903 with the official opening of An T√∫r Gloine that Healy's career really got underway; he was then in his thirtieth year and was about to discover his true vocation as an artist in stained glass. In addition to Sarah Purser, the other artists at the fledgling studio were London-born Alfred E. Child (who also acted as manager) and Catherine O'Brien. Artists who subsequently joined An T√∫r Gloine included Beatrice Elvery, Ethel Rhind, Hubert McGoldrick, Wilhelmina Geddes, and Evie Hone. Michael Healy worked full-time at the studio from its establishment until his death in 1941 without interruption.Gordon Bowe, Nicola; Caron, David; and Wynne, Michael. Gazetteer of Irish Stained Glass, with an introduction and biographies by Nicola Gordon Bowe. Irish Academic Press, Dublin, 1988 Stained glass career Detail of the Simeon window in St Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea The official start of Michael Healy's stained glass career coincided with the opening of An T√∫r Gloine in January 1903, and for the first two years he executed, or assisted in the execution of, a total of thirteen stained glass windows; in the case of the majority of these he assisted in the painting (often working alongside Catherine O'Brien) of windows which had been designed by Sarah Purser, Alfred E. Child, or Beatrice Elvery. The first two windows designed and painted entirely by Healy, Simeon (1904) and St John (1904), demonstrate his finely honed drawing ability and his natural affinity for the craft that would ensure he would soon eclipse his teacher (Alfred E. Child) and his peers. By 1906 Healy had all but ceased to assist in the painting of windows by other artists at the studio and between that year and 1909 he designed fourteen windows himself. Initially he was only assigned small single-light windows but by 1907 he was entrusted with two small rose windows for the side chapels of St Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea, County Galway (where his Simeon had already been installed, and which would ultimately become a showcase for some of his finest work),McGreevy, Thomas. \\"St Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea, 1897 ‚Äì 1947\\", The Capuchin Annual, Dublin, 1946‚Äì1947. pp.353 ‚Äì 373 and by 1908 five of his six windows were two-light commissions. In 1909, having proved his worth, Healy was assigned a large four-light window for the Church of Ireland, Rathmines, Dublin. This significant window, which features three saints he had already painted in stained glass, can be seen as the culmination of his first six years as a maturing stained glass artist. Between 1910 and 1914 Healy executed fifteen works in stained glass, including two sets of door panels. Healy's first window of this period, the massive five-light Convention of Drum Ceat for the Cathedral of St Eunan and St Columba, Letterkenny, County Donegal, with its increased employment of the aiding technique and heightened palette, signals a new departure in Healy's stained glass oeuvre. His finest two windows of the period, both of which are two-lights and were executed in 1914, are St Helena and Constantine (also for Letterkenny Cathedral) and St Patrick blessing Saints Eithne and Fidelma, for the Catholic Church, Donnybrook, Dublin. Between 1915 and 1917 Healy executed eleven stained glass windows, all of which, with one exception, are of modest proportions. Particularly noteworthy is his Christ with St Thomas (1915) for the Catholic Church, Mayfield, Cork, which seems to capture a moment of suspended animation rarely seen in stained glass. Echoing his earlier representation of St Patrick (1914), Healy depicted Ireland's patron saint in sparkling golden vestments twice again in single- light windows destined for the Catholic Church, Ballyporeen, County Tipperary, (1916), and the Catholic Church, Glenariff, County Antrim (1917). Undoubtedly his finest work of this period is his impressive three-light for the chapel of Clongowes Wood College, County Kildare, which depicts three incidents (all nocturnal scenes) from St Joseph's life which occurred around the time of Christ's birth.Caron, David. \\"City Under Siege\\", The Irish Arts Review, March ‚Äì May 2016, Vol. 33, No 1, pp.116 ‚Äì 119 It was only on the conclusion of the First World War that war memorials windows were commissioned from An T√∫r Gloine in significant numbers. Two artists at the studio appear to have specialised in this genre: Michael Healy and Alfred E. Child. The war memorial boom continued unabated into the 1920s and only began to subside post 1921. Between 1918 and 1921 Healy designed twelve windows, and six of these were war memorials. Probably the finest of these was for the Church of Ireland, Castlecomer, County Kilkenny. The commissions entrusted to Healy during the years 1922 to 1924 were diverse, and the calibre of design varied from the pedestrian to the sheer brilliant. The first pair of windows for the Catholic Church, Timahoe, County Laois, are disappointing, though they were immediately followed by two more stunning single-lights (for the Catholic Church at Bridge-a-Crin, County Louth, and the Church of St James and St Catherine, Dublin). Aside from small panels for Fr Glendon, Healy also painted three single-light windows which had been designed by Wilhelmina Geddes for Bardsea, near Ulverston, Lancashire. The years 1925 to 1927 were particularly productive for Healy: twelve stained glass windows, part involvement in an important commission for Singapore (for Eu Tong Sen), and a small though prestigious presentation panel bound for the distinguished architect Ragnar √ñstberg in Stockholm. Significantly, one-third of the windows that Healy executed in this period were overseas commissions, and this was largely brought about by a burgeoning awareness and appreciation of Irish stained glass abroad, particularly in the USA. Five windows from this period were designed for the chapel of the Convent of Mercy, Ballyhaunis, County Mayo, and after it closed they were acquired by the National Gallery of Ireland where they are displayed in a specially designed room dedicated to Irish stained glass. In spite of all the applause and congratulatory comment generated by An T√∫r Gloine's Silver Jubilee celebration, 1928 transpired to be a singularly disappointing year in terms of Healy's output. Two major commissions came to the studios, both of which were entrusted to Healy, and both of which did not proceed beyond the sketch design stage. Aside from completing his St Teresa window for the chapel at Newton Country Day School, Massachusetts, Healy is not recorded as having executed any stained glass windows this year. Between 1929 and 1930 he executed six windows, not including an heraldic work and several small panels. Two were destined for a chapel in Karori, New Zealand, and his most iconographically complex window, St Victor,Caron, David. \\"Michael Healy's Stained Glass Window of St Victor\\", The Irish Arts Review Yearbook, 1993, Vol. 9, pp.187 ‚Äì 191 was also executed during this period. Healy's stained glass output in 1932 comprised two windows, a set of nine emblems for plain-glazed windows, and a few panels. One noteworthy commission came from the writer C. S. Lewis for a window to commemorate his parents in the Church of Ireland, Dundela, Belfast, County Antrim. Also, in May of that year Healy was assigned to oversee the production of an enormous American commission which occupied the entire studio staff for over a year which came via the renowned Boston-based stained glass artist, Charles Connick, for the Church of St. Vincent Ferrer (Manhattan). Aside from the American window, Healy only completed one single-light in 193l, the sumptuous Our Lady Queen of Heaven for St Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea which pushed the aciding technique to new frontiers. Dominating the first half of the 1930s was his largest work, the majestic four-light depicting St Augustine and St Monica (1934‚Äì35) for John's Lane Church, (the Augustinian Priory) on Thomas Street, Dublin. In 1934 he began his fifth and final work for his friend Fr Stephen Glendon, by then posted to the Dominican Priory, Galway. A third apse window for the Church of Ireland at Billy, County Antrim, (near Bushmills), and a fifth nave window for St Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea were completed by Healy in 1935. The Ascension, three-light window in the west transept of St. Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea Between 1936 and 1941, the year of Healy's death, he executed nine windows and a few small panels. Some of these, particularly the larger works, are difficult to date precisely and appear to have been executed over a number of years, in a few cases over a span as great as four years. Aside from his two overseas commissions, one destined for Karori, New Zealand, and the other for the chapel of Brophy College Preparatory,Caron, David. \\"An T√∫r Gloine Stained Glass in Arizona\\", The Irish Arts Review Yearbook, 1994, Vol 10, pp.174 ‚Äì 180 Phoenix, Arizona, Healy's output during this period comprises three distinct sets: a pair of three-lights, the Ascension and Last Judgement for St Brendan's Cathedral, Loughrea; a pair of two-lights for Blackrock College Chapel; and a trio of two-lights for Clongowes Wood College chapel. All nine of these windows number among the finest he executed in a stained glass career that spanned thirty-nine years, however the two that stand out are those for Loughrea Cathedral which are stunning in terms of technique and dramatic interpretation.Caron, Thomas David.

An T√∫r Gloine and Michael Healy (1873 ‚Äì1941) unpublished PhD thesis, Trinity College Dublin, 1991 The vast majority of Healy's windows can still be viewed in the churches for which they were commissioned. Files on all windows designed or painted by Healy, along with 35mm slides taken in situ, can be found in National Irish Visual Arts Library, located in National College of Art and Design, Dublin. Additionally, an extract of his diary for 1916 which deals with the period of the Easter Rising and contains his first-hand observations and references the windows he was working on at the time is in the collection of the National Irish Visual Arts Library, Dublin.

Since 2011, they have also offer residential programs for children in Rotenburg, where they live in one of three family style communities. The center works with their parents and families to ensure they have the best chance to succeed as adults.

This opened the eyes of the local church to the challenges of living with epilepsy. A year later, the association was founded \\"for the care of epileptics\\" and they bought a small house in 1880 and inaugurated Superintendent Adolf Kottmeier as founder and first leader. In 1897, 150 people were already living in the institution.Geschichte der Rotenburger Werke In 1905 the deaconesses of the Mother House Bethesda see Elise Averdieck moved from Hamburg to Rotenburg Das Diakonie-Mutterhaus in Rotenburg and took over the care of the now 330 inhabitants.

While a systematic application of these concepts before the Third Reich has not yet been investigated in detail, it is documented that in the following years 800 people of the then-called Rotenburger Anstalten institution were removed by the Nazi regime and 547 of them were demonstrably murdered. The Rotenburg institutions and their then director Pastor Buhrfeind did not resist.. Individual fates, e.g. the then 11-year-old Eckhard Willumeit were reconstructed. In 1949 the Rotenburger Anstalten were again given a self- administration. From 1966 to 1970, new houses were built and in 1972 a technical school for healers' training was established.

Charlotte Beaumont stars as an Australian fugitive in the Netherlands who joins a tour group to escape extradition. After their bus breaks down by a windmill reputed to be haunted by an avenging demon, the tourists begin mysteriously dying. It premiered at the London FrightFest Film Festival in August 2016 and received a limited theatrical release in the US in October.  Plot  After fleeing Australia, Jennifer takes a job as a nanny in the Netherlands. Her employer eventually discovers her true identity and that she is a fugitive. Looking for a way to quickly leave Amsterdam, she attempts to bluff her way onto a tour bus. Abe, the driver, allows her to board without a ticket, joking that \\"there's always room for another sinner\\". The other tourists include British businessman Douglas and his son, Curt; Jackson, a British soldier who accidentally killed a prostitute prior to boarding; Ruby, a French photographer sent to take pictures of windmills; Takashi, a university student who speaks only Japanese; and Nicholas, a troubled British physician. Takashi recognises Ruby as a promotional model who starred in a popular Japanese advertising campaign. Responding to him in Japanese, Ruby downplays her fame and asks him not to cause a scene. Jennifer drops a pill bottle, and Nicholas hands it back to her after examining the label. After seeing her dead father standing in the road, Jennifer claims the bus has struck a man. The other passengers become annoyed when she insists on checking, and the situation only worsens when Abe cannot restart the bus. Abe suggests they wait for help to arrive, but Jackson and Jennifer leave to investigate a nearby windmill. After having flashbacks of killing the prostitute, Jackson is suddenly maimed by a scythe-wielding demon. Jennifer flees as the demon kills Jackson. The other tourists do not believe her, and Nicholas points out that the bottle she dropped earlier was for an anti-psychotic. Jennifer angrily denies being crazy. The others attempt to calm her but do not believe her story about a demon. As they argue, the bus wobbles precariously. As they disembark, Jennifer accidentally injures Curt. Douglas announces that his son is a haemophiliac and accuses Jennifer of causing all their problems. Abe leads them to an abandoned cabin and, over Jennifer's objections, leaves to seek help from a miller. Takashi wanders off alone and, after seeing a ghostly apparition of his beloved grandmother, expresses remorse for abandoning her. After returning, Abe finds an ancient document that says a local Devil- worshipping miller became an avenging demon after he was burned alive. Each of the tourists find personal items in the cabin that remind them of dark secrets, and they experience nightmares or flashbacks. Jennifer is revealed to have unintentionally caused her younger brother's death while killing their abusive father. After treating Curt, Nicholas wanders outside, where he denounces a silent, ghostly patient for ruining his career. Nicholas was drunk while operating on her and caused her death. Takashi returns to the others, witnessing the demon as it kills Nicholas. The others at first blame Jennifer for Nicholas' death. Takashi says, through Ruby's translation, that the demon spared him because of his remorse. As the others come to believe Jennifer, they admit their sins: Ruby says she hired a yakuza to disfigure a rival model in Japan, and Douglas admits to killing his wife. Ruby drowns after admiring her reflection in a pool of water, and the demonic miller decapitates Douglas. Revealing himself as the miller's assistant, Abe kills Takahashi because the miller can not kill innocents or remorseful people. Abe lures Curt and Jennifer back to the windmill under the pretence of helping them to set it on fire. Jennifer expresses no regret for killing her abusive father, and the miller attacks her. She is saved when Curt escapes Abe and sets the windmill on fire. As the miller disappears, Jennifer remembers her dead brother and risks her life to rescue Curt, slashing Abe's neck. Abe survives his wound by using bone meal from the mill to staunch the bleeding. As he taunts Jennifer, telling her she can not escape her fate, the miller reappears and kills her in front of Curt. Later, Abe picks up another bus load of tourists. When one of them cannot pay, Abe allows him on the bus, repeating the same line from earlier.  Cast  * Charlotte Beaumont as Jennifer. The character was made Australian to emphasize that she has run a great distance to escape her past. Beaumont, a British citizen, studied Australian accents and used Taylor's input to help guide her performance. * Bart Klever as Abe * Patrick Baladi as Douglas * Ben Batt as Jackson * Fiona Hampton as Ruby * Tanroh Ishida as Takashi * Adam Thomas Wright as Curt * Noah Taylor as Nicholas * Kenan Raven as Miller Hendrik  Production  Nick Jongerius grew up near a windmill and said he always found them creepy. The film was based on a concept trailer that proved popular on YouTube. Once he had funding, however, Jongerius rethought many of the themes and changed their focus. Jongerius cited Brian De Palma as an influence on his filmmaking, though he said he did not realize the extent of the influence until after completing The Windmill Massacre. Other influenced were Amicus Productions horror films and Agatha Christie.  Release  The Windmill Massacre premiered at the London FrightFest Film Festival on 29 August 2016. XLrator Media released it via video on demand on 25 August and gave it a limited theatrical release in the US on 28 October 2016. It grossed $90,634 internationally.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 44% of nine surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.5/10. Though praising the premise, Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter wrote the film \\"never manages to connect the high concept with effective characterization\\". Maitland McDonagh of Film Journal International called it \\"formulaic stuff\\" besides the location and focus on windmills. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Noel Murray called it \\"an unusually slick and well-acted slasher picture\\" whose professionalism makes up for its lack of originality. Rob Staeger of L.A. Weekly, in comparing it negatively to The Abominable Dr. Phibes, wrote that it focuses too much on the slasher villain and not enough on the questions raised about grace and repentance. Dread Central's Matt Boiselle rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"Jongerius keeps the template simplistic, ferocious, and absorbing to those who like a lot of slaughter with their tour-information videos ‚Äì recommended.\\"  References   External links  * 2016 films 2016 horror films Dutch films Dutch horror films Dutch slasher films English-language films 2010s supernatural horror films Supernatural slasher films 2010s slasher films ","title":"The Windmill Massacre"},{"id":"55095007","text":"Salar is a census town in Bharatpur II CD Block in Kandi subdivision of Murshidabad district in the state of West Bengal, India.

The cave is largely associated with Makholokoe ‚Äì a tribe of the Basotho and has a rich history relating to this tribe, as well as the interactions between blacks and Boers in the 1800s. The cave has been claimed by Makholokoe as an important imprint in their history and is an important landmark in the Province. The Makholokoe The Makholokoe arrived in Qwaqwa around 1800 led by Matebe (Wetsi) (also spelled Oetsi or Wetsie). They left a place called Thaba Kholokoe which is near Standerton in Mpumalanga, and settled at Thaba Kholo near Bethlehem, Free State. Wetsi then went ahead to look for another place and that is when he decided that he and his people would settle in Wetsieshoek . They first moved at the foot of a mountain called Fika Patso (Split Rock) before moving to Mohlomong near where the old Qwaqwa government building was situated which now seats the offices of the Thabo Mofutsanyana District Municipality. It was while living in Mohlomong that Wetsi discovered a cave near Monontsha Village. This cave became a cattle post during the seasons. In 1856 King Wetsi was dispossessed of the land by the Free State Dutch government and a big war ensued between Makholokoe and the Dutch, Wetsi used the cave as a fortress and the boers bombed the cave, killing many of Makholokoe inside. Wetsi managed to escape with some of Makholokoe and escaped to Lesotho where he joined Poka II son of Molupi of the senior branch of Makholokoe. It is after then that the cave was named after him and the area Wetsieshoek. View of Witsieshoek from the cave Witsieshoek. The community of Makholokoe that is found in the Eastern Free State today is the second generation of Witsie, the grandson of Chief Seka Moloi father to Wetsi The Genealogy of Makholokoe is as follows: *Akhosi *Lehasa *Seka *Wetsi *Lephatsoana(First son) *Mokibiliti *Sekgese *MakausuI *Mabuti *Makausi II Interaction with Voortrekkers Voortrekker settlers moved closer to where Witsieshoek (Afrikaans meaning Witsies se Hoek, ie Witsie‚Äôs corner.) was situated, establishing their farms along the boundaries. At first, these two groups lived well side-by-side. This area was first known as Phofung (meaning the place of the elands), due to a large number of elands found in the area. The place became popularised by Boers as Witsieshoek meaning Witsies se Hoek ‚Äì Witsie‚Äôs corner. The Boer and the Makholokoe had a close trading relationship, through a system called Mafisa. This was a process where a man with many cattle, would lend some to a poor man who would use the milk of the cattle and keep the calves; which afforded him the opportunity to farm his own. In return, the poor man would take care of the cattle of the rich man and owe him loyalty. This system was popularised by King Moshoeshoe during the Mfecane/Difaqane Wars. According to Toeba Moloi (local historian from Qwaqwa) the Boers did not keep their promise of returning the cattle loaned to them by Makholokoe. This is viewed as the reason for the conflict between the two parties. A battle soon ensued between Makholokoe and the Boer farmers over the issue of cattle being stolen. Farmers reported Witsie to Major HD Warden, who was in charge of the Orange Free State after it was annexed by the British in 1848. Warden then gave orders to Witsie to instruct his people to return the allegedly stolen cattle, but Witsie refused, denying the allegations. Warden then ordered Witsie and his people to vacate the area. King Moshoeshoe was called in to intervene. He requested Witsie to return the stolen cattle, for the sake of peace, and he offered him land to settle in Lesotho with his followers. Wetsie declined the offer. Complaints about the Makholokoe‚Äôs raiding and lifting kept flooding the office of Joseph Orpen who was the Volksraad representative in Harrismith. On 12 May 1856, two years after the signing of the Bloemfontein Convention (the agreement through which the British authorities handed the Voortrekkers in the Orange River Sovereignty in 1854), the order to expel Witsie and his people was executed. A republican ‚Äòarmed expedition‚Äô led by Commandant LR Botha and Field-Cornet FJ Senekal, drove the Makholokoe from Witsieshoek and captured their cattle, horses and sheep. Two expeditions were sent, one being in May and the other in June of the same year. This marked the first armed conflict between the whites and blacks in the area. Wetsie was forced to retreat. Significance of the cave Witsie used this cave as a hideout after he and his people were attacked by the Boers. The Makholokoe were trapped, with the intention of starving them. Once Witsie realised that his resources were being exhausted, he snuck out during the night with his family and trusted headmen. They used the horse shoe-shaped cavern to escape into Lesotho. King Moshoeshoe I then gave them land on Likgoele in what is now the district of Mafeteng. While attempting to surrender, his people were then shot at, while some managed to escape. Their livestock were also captured. It is believed that Witsie was a healer and rainmaker and therefore the cave has become a sacred site due to it being used in the past for spiritual rituals. There are claims that in the pile of stones found at the entrance to the cave, lies the remains of some people who perished during the attack. In 2016 the cave was declared a provincial heritage site in the Free State by the Free State Provincial Heritage Resources Authority.National Heritage Resources Act, Act 25 of 1999, Provincial Government Notice 03, Free State Province Government Gazette, Vol 03, No 05, Bloemfontein: Government Printer, 8 April 2016 The cave has been referred to as a ‚Äòfortress‚Äô or ‚Äòstronghold‚Äô of the Makholokoe forefathers.

Constable MacWilliams was controversially charged with second-degree murder in October 2014. By July 2015 those charges were dropped. It was the first time a police officer had been charged for using lethal force in British Columbia since 1975. Background to Incident In August 2012, Mehrdad Bayrami visited Dr. Manoj Singhal and complained of a sore arm. Dr. Singhal observed symptoms of depression, suicidal ideations, and sleep deprivation. Dr. Singhal then saw Bayrami regularly, up until 2 weeks before the shooting. Tetiana Piltsina lived in Richmond, BC when she began to complain to the local RCMP about her ex-spouse Mehrdad Bayrami. She alleged Bayrami was following her, harassing her by telephone, damaging her property, and slandering her to her associates and friends. By October, Bayrami's actions were so concerning that police established surveillance on him and reached out to crown prosecutors. Bayrami was arrested after he placed a GPS tracker on Piltsina's vehicle, and the court process resulted in a peace bond prohibiting Bayrami from contacting Piltsina. Hostage-Taking At approximately 5:45 a.m. on November 8, 2012, Mehrdad Bayrami was waiting in a vehicle outside Starlight Casino - Tetiana Piltsina's workplace. Piltsina had just arrived in her car, and saw Bayrami wearing a reflective vest. Bayrami ran toward her, pulled out a gun, and pulled her into the car. Bayrami fired two shots in an attempt to control her. It was after the shots were fired that 9-1-1 calls were placed to New Westminster Police (NWPD). Police responded and Piltsina remained confined by Bayrami in a stand-off with police. Bayrami held the gun to his own head during most of this time. The NWPD called out the Municipal Integrated Emergency Response Team (MIERT), of which they were a member agency. Piltsina remained in Bayrami's confinement until police convinced him to allow her to walk to safety at approximately 6:56 a.m. Cst. Jordan MacWilliams was a member of the Delta Police Department with approximately five and half years experience as a police officer, and was a member of MIERT. He responded to the incident with the MIERT team. There were four teams of MIERT officers and at least 27 police officers total at the scene. MIERT was tasked with keeping a 20-metre perimeter around Bayrami, many of them - including Cst. MacWilliams - taking cover behind armoured vehicles. Cst. MacWilliams was assigned to \\"lethal overwatch\\" duty with a rifle. Bayrami removed the magazine from his pistol at approximately 10:00 am, leaving one round in the chamber. After remaining seated for some time, he got up and started walking around in circles, moving the gun in directions away from himself but generally pointed at his own head or chest. Shooting Captured on video, the shooting of Bayrami occurs at 10:40 a.m. From a standing position, he looks at and takes several steps forward toward Cst. MacWilliams' team with his handgun pointing skyward. As he stops, police fire non-lethal ARWEN rounds at him, knocking him two or three steps backward. A flash-bang is detonated as he takes larger steps back. His arm with the gun drops to 45 degrees upward, then down to the ground. Other officers testified that, at this moment they had their guns trained on Bayrami and moved their fingers to the trigger as they prepared to fire. Two shots are heard, and Bayrami jerks to the right and grasps the side of his abdomen. He spins around and falls to the ground, dropping his gun. A police dog is released as Bayrami picks up his gun and point it at his head. The dog grabs Bayrami's leg and he releases the gun. MIERT members move in, handcuff Bayrami, and begin first aid. He is rushed to hospital but dies on November 18. Cst. MacWilliams had fired two shots at Bayrami - one striking him in the abdomen, and one missed. Investigation and Charge Almost immediately after the incident, the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) assumed jurisdiction over the investigation of police actions leading to Bayrami's death. The IIO's chief civilian director, Richard Rosenthal, submitted a report to Crown counsel in July 2013, recommending charges. The Criminal Justice Branch sent the report back for more information. The IIO submitted further information in July and October, 2014. The Criminal Justice Branch went to the Deputy Attorney General requesting a direct indictment, and it was approved on October 9. On October 20, Crown prosecutors charged Cst. MacWilliams with second-degree murder. By April 2015, Bayrami's daughter Nousha Mayrami filed a lawsuit against Cst. MacWilliams, alleging he shot Bayrami without justification as he was walking away from officers. That month, Piltsina went to the media to hail Cst. MacWilliams as her hero. She claimed she was never interviewed by police or the IIO even after reaching out to them to provide a statement. Stay of Proceedings On July 14, 2015, the murder charge against MacWilliams was stayed. The Criminal Justice Branch stated \\"CJB has determined that the available evidence no longer satisfies its charge approval standard for the continued prosecution of Const. MacWilliams for any criminal offence. As a result, a stay of proceedings was directed in the case.\\" They insisted that the decision was made based on review of available evidence, and not as a result of any pressure from the public. Delta Police Chief Neil Dubord was quoted as saying \\"Today, we feel an overwhelming sense of relief for Jordan MacWilliams, his family, the men and women of the Delta Police Department, and indeed all police officers across Canada,\\" \\"The charges laid by direct indictment had the potential to deeply impact police across Canada, both operationally and psychologically.\\" References People shot dead by law enforcement officers in Canada Events in British Columbia Law enforcement in Canada New Westminster ","title":"Shooting of Merhdad Bayrami"},{"id":"55095378","text":"Orl√©ans Cathedral of Sainte-Croix Jean II was appointed Bishop of Orleans in France in 1096, succeeding Jean I in the role, and consecrated in on 1 March 1098.

The present building was built in 1891 by the entrepreneur L√©onard Heydt (1829‚Äì1901), who also served as the mayor of Ostwald from 1861 until his death. It re-employs elements of a previous castle from the early 17th century, which had probably replaced an even earlier castle (the first mention of a castle in Ostwald dates from the year 1226). The Renaissance elements of the 17th-century castle were integrated into the Neo-Renaissance designs commissioned by Heydt, who called his property by the German name of Schloss Inselburg (literally: \\"Castle Fortress-on-the-Island\\"), since Alsace was part of the German Empire in 1891. The French name of the castle translates as \\"Castle of the Island\\", since the grounds are indeed surrounded by a small lateral arm of the river Ill. In 1918, the castle was bought by the Darbois family and used as a tea factory (Les th√©s du ch√¢teau de l'√éle) starting in 1921. It was abandoned in the late 1960s, with the end of the Darbois's business, and stood empty until 1991, when it was bought by Pierre Traversac of the luxury hotel group Les Grandes √âtapes Fran√ßaises. Traversac added lateral wings in the local half-timbered architectural style and the hotel opened in 1994.
