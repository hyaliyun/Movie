Nahum means \\"who induces to eagerness\\". According to the Dictionnaire Infernal by Collin de Plancy, he commands forty legions of demons and carries the title of prince. He is also an entity many looked to reconcile friends and foes, and procure love for those seeking it. The Egyptians viewed Amon or Amun as their supreme God; they represented him with the blue skin, in a rather human form. He was written about by Johann Wier in 1583 in the Pseudomonarchia daemonum. \\"Amon, or Aamon, is a great and mighty marques, and commeth abroad in the likeness of a Wolf, having a serpents tail, [vomiting] flames of fire; when he putteth on the shape of a man, he sheweth out dogs teeth, and a great head like to a mighty [night hawk]; he is the strongest prince of all other, and understandeth of all things past and to come, he procureth favor, and reconcileth both friends and foes, and rule forthy legions of devils.\\" And much later by S. L. MacGregor Mathers in the Goetia \\"The Seventh Spirit is Amon. He is a Marquis great in power, and most stern. He appeareth like a Wolf with a Serpent's tail, vomiting out of his mouth flames of fire; but at the command of the Magician he putteth on the shape of a Man with Dog's teeth beset in a head like a Raven; or else like a Man with a Raven's head (simply).

The term stems from cumene (isopropyl benzene), the intermediate material during the process. It was invented by R. ≈™dris and P. Sergeyev in 1942 (USSR).http://izgudrojumi.lza.lv/izg_en.php?id=54, and independently by Heinrich Hock in 1944Hock, H. and Lang, S. (1944), Autoxydation von Kohlenwasserstoffen, IX. Mitteil.: √úber Peroxyde von Benzol-Derivaten. Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft (A and B Series), 77: 257‚Äì264 Concise Encyclopedia Chemistry (1993) Mary Eagleso This process converts two relatively cheap starting materials, benzene and propylene, into two more valuable ones, phenol and acetone. Other reactants required are oxygen from air and small amounts of a radical initiator. Most of the worldwide production of phenol and acetone is now based on this method. In 2003, nearly 7 million tonnes of phenol was produced by the cumene process.Manfred Weber, Markus Weber, Michael Kleine-Boymann \\"Phenol\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2004, Wiley-VCH. . In order for this process to be economical, there must also be demand for the acetone by-product as well as the phenol. ::Overview of the cumene process Steps of the process Cumene is formed in the gas-phase Friedel‚ÄìCrafts alkylation of benzene by propylene. Benzene and propylene are compressed together to a pressure of 30 standard atmospheres at 250 ¬∞C in presence of a catalytic Lewis acid. Phosphoric acid is often favored over aluminium halides. Cumene is oxidized in air, which removes the tertiary benzylic hydrogen from cumene and hence forms a cumene radical: ::300px The cumene radical then bonds with an oxygen molecule to give cumene peroxide radical, which in turn forms cumene hydroperoxide (C6H5C(CH3)2O2H) by abstracting a benzylic hydrogen from another cumene molecule. This latter cumene converts into cumene radical and feeds back into subsequent chain formations of cumene hydroperoxides. A pressure of 5 atm is used to ensure that the unstable peroxide is kept in liquid state. ::300px ::450px Cumene hydroperoxide is then hydrolysed in an acidic medium (the Hock rearrangement) to give phenol and acetone. In the first step, the terminal hydroperoxy oxygen atom is protonated. This is followed by a step in which the phenyl group migrates from the benzyl carbon to the adjacent oxygen and a water molecule is lost, producing a resonance stabilized tertiary carbocation. The concerted mechanism of this step is similar to the mechanisms of the Baeyer‚ÄìVilliger oxidation and also the oxidation step of hydroboration-oxidation. In 2009, an acidified bentonite clay was proven to be a more economical catalyst than sulfuric acid as the acid medium. ::450px As shown below, the resulting carbocation is then attacked by water, a proton is then transferred from the hydroxy oxygen to the ether oxygen, and finally the ion falls apart into phenol and acetone. ::600px Alternatives to acetone co-production Cyclohexylbenzene can replace isopropylbenzene. Via the Hock rearrangement, cyclohexylbenzene hydroperoxide cleaves to give phenol and cyclohexanone. Cyclohexanone is an important precursor to some nylons. Starting with the alkylation of benzene with mixture of 1 and 2-butenes, the cumene process produces phenol and butanones. Alternatives to phenol production *Hydroquinone is prepared by dialkylation of benzene with propene to give 1,4-diisopropylbenzene. This compound reacts with air to afford the bis(hydroperoxide). Analogous to the behavior of cumene hydroperoxide, it rearranges in acid to give acetone and hydroquinone. Oxidation of hydroquinone gives 1,4-benzoquinone:Gerhard Franz, Roger A. Sheldon \\"Oxidation\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000 :C6H4(CHMe2)2 \\\\+ 2.5 O2 ‚Üí C6H4O2 \\\\+ 2 OCMe2 \\\\+ H2O *Resorcinol is analogously prepared by converting 1,3-Diisopropylbenzene into the bis(hydroperoxide), which fragments to resorcinol and acetone. *2-Naphthol can also be produced by a method analogous to the cumene process.Gerald Booth \\"Naphthalene Derivatives\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley- VCH, Weinheim. . *3-Chlorophenol, which does not arise by chlorination of phenol, can be produced by Cumene process beginning with the alkylation of chlorobenzene with propylene. Acetone processing Crude acetone is hydrogenated in the liquid phase over Raney nickel or a mixture of copper and chromium oxide to give isopropyl alcohol. This process is useful, when it is coupled with excess acetone production. Mitsui & Co. developed additional step(s) to hydrogenating the acetone product and dehydrating the isopropanol product to propene, which is recycled as a starting reactant.

Biography Valdemar was the son of the Swedish princess Ingeborg Eriksdotter and Birger Jarl, from the House of Bjelbo. When her brother King Eric XI died in 1250, though a child, Valdemar was elected king and crowned the following year. During the first sixteen years of his reign, it was Birger Jarl who was the real ruler. Birger Jarl had been the de facto ruler of Sweden from 1248, before the reign of Valdemar, even under Eric XI. Valdemar's mother and King Eric were children of King Eric X and Richeza of Denmark. After Birger's death in 1266 Valdemar eventually came into conflict with his younger brother Magnus Birgersson, Duke of S√∂dermanland, over taxation and personal matters. In 1260, Valdemar married Sophia, the eldest daughter of King Eric IV of Denmark and Jutta of Saxony. Valdemar also had a relationship with his sister-in-law Jutta. In 1272, Jutta visited Sweden and became Valdemar's mistress. The affair resulted in a child born in 1273. The following year, Jutta was placed in a convent and Valdemar was forced to make a pilgrimage to Rome to ask for the absolution of the Pope. Valdemar was deposed by his brother, Magnus after the Battle of Hova in Tiveden June 14, 1275. Magnus was supported by his brother, Eric Birgersson, Duke of Sm√•land, and King Eric V of Denmark, who provided Danish soldiers. Magnus was elected King Magnus III of Sweden at the Stones of Mora. In 1277, Sophia separated from her spouse and returned to Denmark and Valdemar managed to regain provinces in Gothenland in the southern part of the kingdom and was called the Duke of G√∂taland. However, Magnus regained them about 1278. In 1288 Valdemar was imprisoned by King Magnus in Nyk√∂ping Castle (Nyk√∂pingshus) and lived openly with mistresses, possibly new wives, in comfortable confinement. Family Valdemar married Sofia of Denmark (died 1286) in 1260 and they separated in 1277. They had six children: # Ingeborg Valdemarsdotter of Sweden, Countess of Holstein; spouse of Gerhard II, Count of Holstein-Pl√∂n. # Erik Valdemarsson of Sweden (1272‚Äì1330) # Marina Valdemarsdotter of Sweden; spouse of Rudolf, Count of Diepholz # Richeza Valdemarsdotter of Sweden (died c. 1292); spouse of Przemys≈Ç II of Poland # Katarina Valdemarsdotter of Sweden (died 1283) # Margareta Valdemarsdotter of Sweden, a nun.

The program is currently broadcast from Shepherd's Grove. The program was founded and first hosted by Robert H. Schuller. It is currently hosted by Bobby Schuller, who is Robert H. Schuller's grandson and the son of Robert A. Schuller, himself a former host. It was also once hosted by Sheila Schuller Coleman, a daughter of Robert H. Schuller. The program is normally one hour long, but some networks broadcast an edited 30-minute program. It features a large congregation, mostly Christian music with a choir (with an orchestra as well as the Crystal Cathedral organ as of March 2012) and guests who speak about how God and their Christian faith have changed their lives for the better. History The program first aired on February 8, 1970 as a church service of the Garden Grove Community Church (Reformed Church in America). By the 1980s, it was the most-watched weekly religious program in living rooms across America.https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-07-20/crystal-cathedral- megachurch-conversion-catholicism It was originally hosted by the elder Schuller; the younger Schuller hosted it from 2006 to 2008. The Crystal Cathedral where the Hour of Power program was previously broadcast On July 9, 2008, the presidency of the church was shifted from the Robert H. Schuller to his son-in-law Jim Coleman. On October 26, 2008, it was announced that Schuller had removed his son, Robert A. Schuller, as teaching pastor, but allowed him to remain as the Crystal Cathedral's senior pastor. Robert H. Schuller said that he wanted to take the ministry in a different direction and for the foreseeable future would use guest speakers for the weekly services rather than his son. Well-known speakers who were used in the early stages of the new format included Lee Strobel, John C. Maxwell, and Bill Hybels. On November 29, 2008, the church announced that the younger Schuller had resigned. On October 18, 2010, the board of the Crystal Cathedral filed for bankruptcy in Santa Ana, California. On March 10, 2012, it was announced that Robert H. Schuller and his wife, Arvella, would be leaving the church. The following day their elder daughter, Sheila Schuller Coleman, announced at the morning service that she would also be leaving the church, therefore cutting all family ties with the Crystal Cathedral and Hour of Power, stating that \\"This is the last Sunday we will be worshiping in this building.\\"Los Angeles Times: \\"Crystal Cathedral divided as Schullers leave, changes planned\\", March 12, 2012. The ministry's successor, the Rev. Bill Bennett, said that the ministry would continue but using a more traditional service. In June 2012, the Rev. Bobby Schuller, the son of Robert A. Schuller, started preaching on a voluntary basis. In February 2013, Bobby Schuller was named as pastor for the Hour of Power. The Crystal Cathedral congregation was renamed Shepherd's Grove in 2013. Financial considerations dictated a move to a smaller property soon after, as well as a decision to sell the Crystal Cathedral, to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange, CA, for 49 million dollars. The diocese plans to spend over 100 million dollars on structural repairs and alterations necessary to adapt the building for Catholic services. When completed, it is to be rededicated as \\"Christ Cathedral.\\" Following the move from the Garden Grove Campus, services were held in the former Catholic Church in the fall of 2013. The congregation moved to Irvine Presbyterian Church in April 2018 after it was sold to real estate developers. Like the previous location of the Crystal Cathedral and former Catholic Church, it is quite mixed with a rooftop Windows. 250px Broadcasts The program airs in the United States mainly using paid programming time on Freeform (TV channel), the Trinity Broadcasting Network/The Church Channel, Hillsong Channel, and recently Daystar (TV network). along with about 100 stations through individual contracts. The program also airs over the American Forces Network. In Canada it is carried on VisionTV. In Europe it is broadcast on CNBC Europe, VOX in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, on RTL in the Netherlands and Sky1 in Ireland and the United Kingdom. In the Middle East it is carried on METV in Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. In Australia, it is seen on EXPO, Australian Christian Channel, Network Ten and WIN; the program is also broadcast weekly on radio. It is broadcast in New Zealand on the Prime network. It is broadcast in Hong Kong on NOW TV Channel 564, TVB Pearl, and Hong Kong Open TV. The Hour of Power telecast, filmed in the Crystal Cathedral's main sanctuary, at one point attracted 1.3 million viewers from 156 countries. Under current Pastor Bobby Schuller, the program attracted 2.2 million viewers worldwide each week. Finances Beginning in the late 1990s, the ministry struggled financially after it borrowed money to build a visitors' center. 2008 revenues for the program were nearly $5 million lower than revenues for 2007. As of early 2009, the church planned to sell more than $65 million worth of its Orange County property to pay off debt: in San Juan Capistrano, California, and an office building in Garden Grove, California. Due to their financial situation, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange purchased the Garden Grove campus.

Damaged 13th century bust assumed to be of King Eric Eric \\"XI\\"Referring to Erik the Lisp and Lame as King Eric XI is a later invention, counting backwards from Eric XIV (1560‚Äì68). He and his brother Charles IX (1604‚Äì1611) adopted numerals according to a fictitious history of Sweden. The number of Swedish monarchs named Eric before Eric XIV (at least seven) is unknown, going back into prehistory, and none of them used numerals. It would be speculative to try to affix a mathematically accurate one to this king. the Lisp and Lame Swedish: Erik Eriksson or Erik l√§spe och halte; Old Norse: Eir√≠kr Eir√≠ksson (1216 ‚Äì 2 February 1250) was king of Sweden in 1222‚Äì29 and 1234‚Äì50.Erik \\"l√§spe och halte\\" Eriksson (Historiska personer) Being the last ruler of the House of Eric, he stood in the shadow of a succession of powerful Jarls, especially his brother-in-law Birger Jarl, whose descendants ruled as kings after his death. Background Eric was the son of Eric X of Sweden and Richeza of Denmark. According to the chronicle Erikskr√∂nikan written in the early 1320s, Eric is said to have been partly lame; \\"King Eric was lisping in his talk / Limping was, as well, his walk\\".Pipping, Erikskr√∂nikan, pp. 4-5. For this reason, later historians referred to him as \\"Erik the Lisp and Lame\\" which was apparently not used in his own time. Eric was born after his father, King Eric X, had already died (1216). The fifteen-year-old John I from the rival House of Sverker was hailed king by the Swedish aristocracy, while Queen Richeza returned to her Danish homeland where her brother Valdemar Sejr ruled. Eric spent his early youth in Denmark, while Valdemar championed his rights to the Swedish throne and tried to prevent the coronation of John I. Pope Honorius III ordered three North German bishops to investigate the issue in 1219, however to no avail. John I nevertheless died in 1222, whereby the House of Sverker became extinct in the male line.Bolin, \\"Erik Eriksson\\" First reign With no dynastic rivals at hand, the six-year-old Eric was hailed as king, sometime between August 1222 and July 1223. The Archbishop Olof Basat√∂mer supported his cause and appears to have crowned him in Str√§ngn√§s Cathedral on 31 July 1223. During the minority of the king, a council was formed, consisting of Bishop Bengt of Skara, the king's foster father Erengisle Vig, Stenar, Knut Kristinesson, and Knut Holmgersson (Knut the Tall). The two last- mentioned were second cousins of King Eric.Knut \\"l√•nge\\" Holmgersson (Historiska personer) In 1225 Eric and his realm were taken under the protection of the Pope. In the same year a brief conflict with Norway flared up, as King H√•kon H√•konson made an incursion into V√§rmland in retaliation for support given to H√•kon's Norwegian enemies.Line, Kingship and State Formation in Sweden, p. 127. The members of the royal council were termed consiliarii (Sw., r√•dsherre), a term that now occurs for the first time in a Swedish context. However, the internal cohesion of the council was weak, and its members were considered notoriously unreliable. Knut Kristinesson went to Norway in 1226 in order to claim the crown of this country, and Bishop Bengt died in 1228.Bolin, \\"Erik Eriksson\\", sok.riksarkivet.se; accessed 31 January 2019. In the next year 1229, a feud broke out, as Knut the Tall and a party of nobles, the Folkung Party, rose against the young ruler. The causes are not known, but a wish by some nobles to restrain the power of the Church might have had a role.Line, Kingship and State Formation in Sweden, p. 111. Eric was overthrown after the battle of Olustra (slaget vid Olustra). The battle is believed to have taken place in Olustra (Ostra) in S√∂dermanland, although Alvastra in √ñsterg√∂tland has been mentioned as a possible site. After his loss, the young king fled to Denmark where his uncle Valdemar Sejr was still ruling. Knut the Tall was crowned King Canute II of Sweden in 1231, but his time was short and he died in 1234.Line, Kingship and State Formation in Sweden, pp. 110-13. Second reign According to a Danish source, Eric returned to Sweden already in 1232, when Canute was still king. The Swedish Erikskr√∂nikan on the contrary asserts that he came back after King Canute's death, after a new round of fighting.Pipping, Erikskr√∂nikan, p. 3. At any rate Eric was once again accepted as king and ruled until his own death in 1250. At first, he reconciled with the Folkung Party. The Folkung Ulf Fase, who had been Jarl of the realm under Canute II, continued to serve in that function under Eric. Ulf Fase was an able politician who managed to prevent feuding between the noble factions for many years. As a king, Eric is depicted in Erikskr√∂nikan as good-natured but physically passive: ::He liked to strengthen reason and right, ::and was pleased to care for his own kin. ::He maintained domestic honour and noble custom, ::and gave the peasant good peace, ::He well understood serious matters, ::but would not care much for tournaments.Pipping, Erikskr√∂nikan, p. 5. In fact he was relatively insignificant and heavily dependent on stronger men in his entourage; first Ulf Fase and, after his death (1248), the latter's kinsman Birger Magnusson (Birger Jarl) (d. 1266). They were both scions of the large and influential Bj√§lbo family from √ñsterg√∂tland, but entertained different political agendas. While Ulf pursued a policy of alliance with the Norwegian king, Birger strove to strengthen royal authority by allying closely with the Catholic Church. In about the late 1230s, King Eric's elder sister Ingeborg was married to Birger, in the latter's first marriage. Birger was purportedly the son of a female heiress of the Sverker dynasty, thus having royal blood.Line, Kingship and State Formation in Sweden, pp. 101, 116. Eastward expansion Sweden had a certain presence in south-western Finland by the early 13th century, although it is unclear to what extent this translated into political power. A bishopric existed in Nousiainen and later Turku (√Öbo), which stood under the papal legate of the Baltic region. The Erikskr√∂nikan contains a graphic description of a military expedition to Tavastia further to the east that King Eric dispatched in an unspecified year, possibly in 1238-39 or 1249‚Äì50. While not literally a crusade, the professed aim was to Christianize still pagan lands. A sizable fleet was assembled under the leadership of Birger and sailed over to Tavastia (a problematic statement since Tavastia is an inland region). According to the highly propagandist chronicle, the expedition was an unqualified success: ::They took their banners and went ashore, ::The Christians were successful in the war. ::They let their shields shine ::all over the land, and so their helmets. ::They were keen to try their swords ::on the pagan Tavasts ::As I expect, they achieved ::gold and silver and large herds. ::The Tavasts then ran and were gone, ::the pagans lost and the Christians won. ::Anyone who wanted to serve them, ::and become Christian and accept baptism, ::they allowed to keep goods and life, ::and to live in peace without further strife. ::To any pagan who would not do that, ::they administered death.Pipping, Erikskr√∂nikan, p. 8-9. The expedition led to the establishment of a permanent fortress, Tavasteborg, and the formal Christianization of the region. As the chronicle has it, \\"I think the Russian king lost it\\".Pipping, Erikskr√∂nikan, p. 10. The enterprise is not mentioned in other sources, and its circumstances are hotly debated among modern historians. It is possibly connected to a Swedish foray in the Novgorod Republic in 1240. A fleet of ships commanded by a certain Spiridon and accompanied by a few bishops went up the Neva River, but were attacked and routed by the Novgorodian prince Alexander Nevsky. Details of the battle are partly legendary, and its significance might have been exaggerated in Russian historiography. According to a 14th-century source, the Swedish leader was a Belgerd, corresponding to Birger, though this may be a later construction.Line, Kingship and State Formation in Sweden, pp. 442-43; Harrison, \\"Birger jarl och Aleksandr Nevskij\\". Renewed domestic feuding Internal fighting once again broke out in 1247, shortly before (or possibly after) Ulf Fase's death. The Folkung Party warred with King Eric and Birger, but their peasant allies in Uppland lost the Battle of Sparrs√§tra and were punished by tightening royal taxation. The Folkung leader Holmger Knutsson, a son of Canute II, fled to G√§strikland but was captured by Eric's men and beheaded.Line, Kingship and State Formation in Sweden, p. 118. Shortly after the defeat of the uprising, Birger was appointed Jarl of the realm. As such he oversaw a clerical meeting in Sk√§nninge in February 1248, summoned by the papal legate William of Sabina. On behalf of Pope Innocent IV, he urged the Swedes to stick to canonic-juridical praxis as laid down by Rome. The authority of the bishops was strengthened and Sweden was increasingly incorporated in the Catholic Church.Harrison, Sveriges historia: medeltiden, p. 134-6. Family and heirs Eric married Queen Catherine in 1243 or 1244. She was the daughter of (Jarl) Sune Folkason of Bj√§lbo and an heiress of the House of Sverker. In that way the two long-competing royal houses were eventually united. Commonly, sources say that Eric was childless, but some sources claim that he had a couple of baby daughters who died. Eric XI died on 2 February 1250, and was buried in the monastery of Varnhem Abbey in V√§sterg√∂tland. With him the House of Eric became extinct in the male line, with the possible exception of Canute II's son Filip (d. 1251).He and his father Canute II were probably descendants of Eric the Saint, although the details are not quite certain; Line, Kingship and State Formation in Sweden, p. 568. Under these circumstances the throne went to the offspring of Birger Jarl and Ingeborg, the more since Birger was now in full control over the realm. Their eldest but still under-age son Valdemar was elected king in 1250 to succeed Eric, possibly by-passing the sons, to the extent there were such, of Ingeborg's elder sisters.Ingeborg had at least one, possibly more sisters, though their birth dates or birth order are not known. The sons of her documented sister Sophia (d. 1241) were dukes in Mecklenburg but made no known claims. Birger Jarl became the Regent, holding the true power in Sweden until his own death in 1266.

The Greater Antilles includes the larger islands of the Cayman Islands, Cuba, Hispaniola (subdivided into the nations of the Dominican Republic and Haiti), Jamaica, and Puerto Rico. The Lesser Antilles contains the northerly Leeward Islands and the southeasterly Windward Islands as well as the Leeward Antilles just north of Venezuela.

In terms of geology, the Greater Antilles are made up of continental rock, as distinct from the Lesser Antilles, which are mostly young volcanic or coral islands.  Background  Map of Antilles / Caribbean in 1843 The word Antilles originated in the period before the European colonization of the Americas, Antilia being one of those mysterious lands which figured on the medieval charts, sometimes as an archipelago, sometimes as continuous land of greater or lesser extent, its location fluctuating in mid-ocean between the Canary Islands and India. After the 1492 arrival of Christopher Columbus's expedition in what was later called the West Indies, the European powers realized that the dispersed lands constituted an extensive archipelago inhabiting the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The Antilles were called multiple names before their current name became the norm. Early Spanish visitors called them the Windward Islands (today having a narrower definition). They were also called the Forward Islands by 18th-century British. Thereafter, the term Antilles was commonly assigned to the formation, and \\"Sea of the Antilles\\" became a common alternative name for the Caribbean Sea in various European languages. Demographics The Antilles were described in 1778 by Thomas Kitchin as once being called the Caribbee Isles in homage to the Carib people who were the islands' first inhabitants.

Adamski called himself a \\"philosopher, teacher, student and saucer researcher\\", although most investigators concluded his claims were an elaborate hoax, and that Adamski himself was a con artist. Adamski authored three books describing his meetings with Nordic aliens and his travels with them aboard their spaceships: Flying Saucers Have Landed (co- written with Desmond Leslie) in 1953, Inside the Space Ships in 1955, and Flying Saucers Farewell in 1961. The first two books were both bestsellers; by 1960 they had sold a combined 200,000 copies.Profile, gutenberg.org; accessed 8 June 2017. Early years Adamski was born in Bromberg in the Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire. He was one of five siblings born to ethnic Polish parents, J√≥zef Adamski (1867‚Äì1937) and Franciszka Adamska (1862‚Äì1946). When he was two years old, his family emigrated to the United States and settled in New York City. From 1913-16, beginning at the age of 22,Solomon 1998, pp. 54‚Äì56 he was a soldier in the 13th U.S. Cavalry Regiment (K Troop) fighting at the Mexican border during the Pancho Villa Expedition. In 1917, he married Mary Shimbersky. She died in 1954; they had no children.Clark, p. 26 Following his marriage Adamski moved west, doing maintenance work in Yellowstone National Park and working in an Oregon flour mill and a California concrete factory. In the 1920s, Adamski became interested in the esoteric occultist religion theosophy, and a variant called neo- theosophy.(https://web2.ph.utexas.edu/~coker2/index.files/adamski.htm) By 1930 \\"Adamski was a minor figure on the California occult scene\\", teaching his personal mixture of Christianity and Eastern religions, which he called \\"Universal Progressive Christianity\\" and \\"Universal Law.\\" In the early 1930s, while living in southern California, Adamski founded the \\"Royal Order of Tibet\\" in Laguna Beach, which held its meetings in the \\"Temple of Scientific Philosophy\\". Adamski served as a \\"philosopher\\" and teacher at the temple.Peebles, p. 113 The \\"Royal Order of Tibet\\" was given a government license to make wine for \\"religious purposes\\" during Prohibition; Adamski was quoted as saying \\"I made enough wine for all of Southern California ... I was making a fortune!\\" However, the end of Prohibition also marked the decline of his profitable wine-making business, and Adamski later told two friends that's when he \\"had to get into this [flying] saucer crap.\\" In 1940, Adamski, his wife, and some close friends moved to a ranch near California's Palomar Mountain, where they dedicated their time to studying religion, philosophy, and farming. In 1944, with funding from Alice K. Wells, a student of Adamski, they purchased of land at the base of Palomar Mountain, along highway S6, where they built a new home, a campground called Palomar Gardens, and a small restaurant called Palomar Gardens Cafe. At the campground and diner, Adamski \\"often gave lectures on Eastern philosophy and religion, sometimes late into the night\\" to students, admirers, and tourists.Peebles, p. 114 He also built a wooden observatory at the campground to house his six-inch telescope, and visitors and tourists to Palomar Mountain often received the false impression that Adamski was an astronomer connected to the famed Palomar Observatory at the top of the mountain.Moseley, pp. 64-65 Adamski would correct this inaccurate impression \\"only when pressed to do so.\\"Moseley, p. 65 Though he was usually referred to as \\"Professor\\" Adamski by his admirers and followers and he often implied or claimed to possess various academic degrees, Adamski held no graduate or undergraduate degree from any accredited college or university, and in fact had only a third grade education.Peebles, p. 119 Ufology On 9 October 1946, during a meteor shower, Adamski and some friends claimed that while they were at the Palomar Gardens campground, they witnessed a large cigar-shaped \\"mother ship.\\" In early 1947, Adamski took a photograph of what he claimed was the 1946 cigar-shaped \\"mother ship\\" crossing in front of the moon over Palomar Gardens. In the summer of 1947, following the first widely publicized UFO sightings in the USA, Adamski claimed he had seen 184 UFOs pass over Palomar Gardens one evening.Clark, p. 27 In 1949, Adamski began giving his first UFO lectures to civic groups and other organizations in Southern California; he requested, and received, fees for the lectures. In these lectures he made \\"fantastic\\" claims, such as \\"that government and science had established the existence of UFOs two years earlier, via radar tracking of 700-foot-long spacecraft on the other side of the Moon.\\" In his lectures Adamski further claimed that \\"science now knows that all planets [in Earth's solar system] are inhabited\\" and \\"photos of Mars taken from the Mount Palomar observatory have proven the canals on Mars are man-made, built by an intelligence far greater than any man's on earth.\\" However, as one UFO historian has noted, \\"even in the early 1950s [Adamski's] assertions about surface conditions on, and the habitability of, Venus, Mars, and the other planets of the solar system flew in the face of massive scientific evidence ...\\"mainstream\\" ufologists were almost uniformly hostile to Adamski, holding not only that his and similar contact stories were fraudulent, but that the contactees were making serious UFO investigators look ridiculous.\\"Clark, p. 31 On 29 May 1950, Adamski took a photograph of what he alleged to be six unidentified objects in the sky, which appeared to be flying in formation. This same UFO photograph was depicted in an August 1978 commemorative stamp issued by the island nation of Grenada in order to mark the \\"Year of UFOs.\\" =Orthon and the Contactees= On 20 November 1952, Adamski and several friends were in the Colorado Desert near the town of Desert Center, California, when they purportedly saw a large submarine-shaped object hovering in the sky. Believing that the ship was looking for him, Adamski is said to have left his friends and to have headed away from the main road. Shortly afterwards, according to Adamski's accounts, a scout ship made of a type of translucent metal landed close to him, and its pilot, a Venusian called Orthon,Peebles, pp. 115-16 disembarked and sought him out. Adamski claimed the people with him also saw the Venusian ship, and several of them later stated they could see Adamski meeting someone in the desert, although from a considerable distance. Adamski's infamous \\"chicken brooder\\" photograph, which he claimed to be of a UFO, taken on 13 December 1952. However, German scientist Walther Johannes Riedel said this photo was faked using a surgical lamp and that the landing struts were light bulbs. Adamski described Orthon as being a medium-height humanoid with long blond hair and tanned skin wearing reddish-brown shoes, though, as Adamski added, \\"his trousers were not like mine.\\" Adamski said Orthon communicated with him via telepathy and through hand signals.Laycock, et al. 1989, p. 3 During the conversation, Orthon purportedly warned of the dangers of nuclear war, and Adamski later wrote that \\"the presence of this inhabitant of Venus was like the warm embrace of great love and understanding wisdom.\\"Clark, p. 28 Adamski claimed Orthon had refused to allow himself to be photographed, and instead, had asked Adamski to provide him with a blank photographic plate, which Adamski claimed he had given Orthon. George Hunt Williamson (a contactee and Adamski associate) also claimed that after Orthon left, he was able to take plaster casts of Orthon's shoe imprints. The imprints contained mysterious symbols, which Adamski said was a message from Orthon.Peebles, p. 116 Orthon is said to have returned the photographic plate to Adamski on 13 December 1952; when developed it was found to contain new strange symbols. It was during this meeting that Adamski is said to have taken a now famous photograph of Orthon's Venusian scout ship using his telescope. At the time, skeptics said it looked suspiciously like the top of a \\"chicken brooder\\", for warming newly hatched poultry. Anglo-Irish eccentric Desmond Leslie struck up a correspondence with Adamski. In the mid-1950s Leslie had created a low-budget UFO film entitled Them And The Thing at his home, Castle Leslie. The flying saucer in the film had been created by shining mirrors on to a Spanish Renaissance shield suspended from a fishing line. The film was rediscovered in 2010. In need of money and keen to create a bestseller, Leslie had written a manuscript about the visitation of Earth by aliens. Its genesis had been Leslie chancing upon a copy of the 1896 book The Story of Atlantis and the Lost Lemuria by William Scott-Elliot in a friend's library.Hesemann, Michael, Filmed interview with Leslie as The Pioneers of Space, YouTube.com; accessed 2 July 2017. Adamski sent Leslie a written account of his supposed contact with Orthon, and photos. Leslie combined the two works into the 1953 co-authored book Flying Saucers Have Landed. The book became a bestseller, brought both Adamski and Leslie news media attention, and eventually became \\"a key text of the New Age movement.\\"(https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1327100/Desmond- Leslie.html) The following year Leslie visited Adamski in California, and claimed to witness several UFOs with him. Leslie described one of them in a letter he sent to his wife while he was in San Diego: Flying Saucers Have Landed claimed Nordic aliens from Venus and other planets in Earth's solar system routinely visited the Earth. According to the book, Orthon and other aliens were worried that nuclear bomb tests in the Earth's atmosphere would kill all life on Earth, spread radiation into space, and contaminate other planets.Peebles, p. 115 Adamski claimed that Nordic aliens worshiped a \\"Creator of All\\", but that \\"we on Earth know very little about this Creator ... our understanding is shallow.\\" In his 1955 book Inside the Space Ships, Adamski claimed that Orthon arranged for him to be taken on a trip to see the Solar System, including the planet Venus, the location where Orthon said the late Mrs. Adamski had been reincarnated. He claimed that in another voyage he met the 1,000-year-old \\"elder philosopher of the space people\\", who was called \\"the Master\\". Adamski said he and the Master discussed philosophy, religion, and the \\"Earth's place in the universe\\".Peebles, p. 122 Adamski said he learned that he had been selected by Nordic aliens to bring their message of peace to Earth people, and that other humans throughout history had also served as their messengers, including Jesus Christ. Adamski further claimed that aliens were peacefully living on Earth, and that he had met with them in bars and restaurants in Southern California. Adamski's stories led other people to come forward with their own claims of contact and interplanetary travels with friendly \\"Space Brothers\\", including such figures as Howard Menger, Daniel Fry, George Van Tassel, and Truman Bethurum. The message of Adamski and his fellow contactees was one in which the other planets of Earth's solar system were all \\"inhabited by physically handsome, spiritually evolved beings who have moved beyond the problems of Earth people ... the reader of Inside the Space Ships enters a perfect world, the kind we can create here on Earth if we behave ourselves.\\" Through books, lectures, and conventions - particularly the annual Giant Rock UFO convention in California - the contactee movement would grow throughout the 1950s.Peebles, p. 125 However, Adamski would remain the most prominent, and most influential, of the contactees. Adamski's claims of traveling aboard a UFO inspired an elaborate hoax perpetrated by British astronomer Patrick Moore and his friend Peter Davies using the false identity Cedric Allingham.Clark, pp. 70-71 =Straith Letter Hoax= In 1957 Adamski received a letter signed \\"R.E. Straith,\\" alleged representative of the \\"Cultural Exchange Committee\\" of the U.S. State Department. The letter said the U.S. Government knew that Adamski had spoken to extraterrestrials in a California desert in 1952, and that a group of highly placed government officials planned on public corroboration of Adamski's story. Adamski was proud of this endorsement and exhibited it to support his claims.Peebles, pp. 133-34 However, in 1985 ufologist James W. Moseley revealed that the letter was a hoax.(http://www.debunker.com/historical/GrayBarkerPapers.pdf) Moseley said he and his friend Gray Barker had obtained some official State Department letterheads, created the R.E. Straith persona, and then written the letter to Adamski as a prank. According to Moseley, the FBI investigated the case and discovered that the letter was a hoax, but charges were not filed against Moseley or Barker.Moseley & Pflock, pp. 124‚Äì27, 180 Moseley also wrote that the FBI informed Adamski that the Straith letter was a hoax and asked him to stop using it as evidence in support of his claims, but that Adamski refused and continued to display the letter in his lectures and talks.Moseley & Pflock, p. 126 This was not the first time Adamski had claimed government support for his UFO stories. In 1953 he told a meeting of the Corona, California Lions Club that his \\"material has all been cleared with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Air Force Intelligence.\\"Peebles, p. 117 When the FBI learned of Adamski's claims, three agents were sent to talk to Adamski. He denied having stated that the FBI or USAF intelligence supported his claims (even though his remarks were reported in a local newspaper, the Riverside Enterprise), and he agreed to sign a letter stating that \\"he understood the implications of making false claims\\" and that the FBI \\"did not endorse [the claims] of individuals.\\" The three FBI agents also signed the letter, and a copy was given to Adamski. However, a few months later Adamski told an interviewer that he had been \\"cleared\\" by the FBI, and displayed the letter as proof. When the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau complained, more FBI agents were sent to retrieve Adamski's copy of the letter, \\"read the riot act to him, and warn him that legal action would be taken if he continued\\" to claim FBI or government support for his stories.Peebles, pp. 117-18 Adamski later said the FBI had \\"warned [him] to keep quiet.\\"Peebles, p. 118 =Meeting with Queen Juliana of the Netherlands= In May 1959, the head of the Dutch Unidentified Flying Objects Society told Adamski she had been contacted by officials at the palace of Queen Juliana of the Netherlands who advised \\"that the Queen would like to receive you.\\" Adamski informed a London newspaper about the invitation, which prompted the court and cabinet to request that the queen cancel her private audience with Adamski, but the queen went ahead with the audience, saying, \\"A hostess cannot slam the door in the face of her guests.\\" After the audience, Dutch Aeronautical Association president Cornelis Kolff said \\"The Queen showed an extraordinary interest in the whole subject.\\" The Royal Netherlands Air Force Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Haye Schaper said \\"The man's a pathological case.\\" Wire services such as United Press International and Reuters circulated reports of the meeting to newspapers around the world.Peebles, p. 60 Later life Adamski's spurious \\"Golden Medal of Honor\\", which he claimed to have received during a secret audience with Pope John XXIII In 1962, Adamski announced that he would be attending an interplanetary conference held on the planet Saturn. In 1963, Adamski claimed that he had been granted a secret audience with Pope John XXIII and that he had received a \\"Golden Medal of Honor\\" from the pope. However, skeptics noted that the medal was actually a common tourist souvenir made by a company in Milan, Italy, and that Adamski displayed it to his friends in a cheap plastic box - which is how it was sold in tourist shops in Rome. Adamski said he met with the Pope at the request of the extraterrestrials he was allegedly in contact with, in order to request a \\"final agreement\\" from the Pope because of his decision not to communicate directly with any extraterrestrials, and also to offer him a liquid substance in order to save him from the gastric enteritis that he suffered from, which would later become acute peritonitis. Death On 23 April 1965, aged 74, Adamski died of a heart attack at a friend's home in Silver Spring, Maryland, after giving a UFO lecture in Washington, DC.(Clark, p. 30) He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Investigations and criticism Over the decades, numerous critics and skeptics have investigated Adamski's claims. The aliens Adamski claimed to have met in the 1950s were described by him as \\"human beings from another world\\", usually light-skinned, light-haired humanoids that would later be called Nordic aliens. Adamski claimed in his books that these \\"alien humans\\" came from Venus, Mars, and other planets in Earth's solar system. However, none of the planets he mentioned are capable of supporting human life, due to their environmental conditions. The first alien Adamski claimed to have met was from Venus, yet the atmospheric pressure on the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, it has clouds which rain a toxic substance thought to be sulfuric acid, the atmosphere consists almost entirely of carbon dioxide, with very little oxygen, and the average surface temperature of Venus is 464 ¬∞C. In one of his books, Adamski described a trip he took to the far side of the Moon in a UFO, where he claimed to see cities, trees, and snow-capped mountains; he also claimed that the first photographs of the Moon's far side that were taken by the Soviet lunar probe Luna 3 in 1959 were altered to depict a barren, lifeless surface to hide what he saw. However, all scientific evidence, as well as later lunar trips by American astronauts, clearly showed that the far side of the Moon is barren of life and has no atmosphere. In his writings Adamski claimed he travelled to Venus, Mars, and other planets in Earth's solar system, and clearly stated that they were all capable of supporting humanoid life. As UFO historian Jerome Clark noted, \\"some Adamski partisans insisted that Venus, Mars, Saturn, and the rest were merely code words for planets in other solar systems; there is, however, nothing in Adamski's public writings to support this interpretation and considerable testimony to the contrary.\\" Adamski's 1955 book Inside the Space Ships, which describes his claimed travels through Earth's solar system in a UFO, is considered by some critics to be a \\"remake\\" of his 1949 science fiction book, ghostwritten for Adamski by Lucy McGinnis, and entitled Pioneers of Space. It described a fictional voyage through the solar system that, critics noted, sounded very similar to the space travels described by Adamski in Inside the Space Ships. =Adamski photographs and Moseley investigation= Adamski's photographs of objects he claimed were UFOs he had observed and traveled in have also come under scrutiny. His frequently published photo of an object from 1952 has been variously identified as a streetlight or the top of a chicken brooder.Wilhelmsen 2008, p. 259 Adamski claimed that movie director Cecil B. DeMille's top trick photographer, J. Peverell Marley, had examined his UFO photos and found a \\"spaceman\\" in them, and Marley himself declared that if Adamski's pictures were fakes, they were the best he had ever seen. In the United Kingdom, 14 experts from the J. Arthur Rank company concluded that the object photographed was either real or a full-scale model.Zinsstag & Good 1983, p. 176. However, in his 1955 investigation into Adamski's claims, James W. Moseley interviewed Marley, who denied that he had enlarged the photos for analysis, found a \\"spaceman\\" in them, or knew of anyone who had. Moseley also interviewed German rocket scientist Walther Johannes Riedel, who told him that he had analyzed Adamski's UFO photos and found them to be fakes.Moseley & Pflock, p. 69 Riedel told Moseley that the UFO's \\"landing struts\\" were actually 100-watt General Electric light bulbs, and that he had seen the round \\"GE\\" logo printed on them. In 2012, UFO researcher Joel Carpenter identified the reflector-shade of a widely available 1930s pressurised-gas lantern as an identical visual match to the main portion of Adamski's saucer. In his 1955 investigation, Moseley found other flaws in Adamski's story. He interviewed several of the people that Adamski claimed had been with him in his initial 20 November 1952 meeting with Orthon, and found that these witnesses contradicted Adamski's claims.Peebles, pp. 118-19 One, Al Bailey, denied to Moseley that he had seen a UFO in the desert or the alien Adamski described. Jerrold Baker, who had worked at Palomar Gardens with Adamski, told Moseley that he had overheard \\"a tape-recorded account of what was to transpire on the desert, who was to go, etc.\\" several days before Adamski's claimed 20 November meeting with Orthon, and Baker stated that Adamski's meeting with Orthon was a \\"planned operation.\\" Baker added that Adamski had tried to convince him not to expose their hoax by telling him that he could make money by charging fees to give UFO lectures, as Adamski was doing: \\"Now you know the [UFO] picture connected to your name is in the book (Flying Saucers Have Landed) too. And with people knowing that you are connected with flying saucers ... you could do yourself a lot of good. You could give lectures in the evenings. There is a demand for this! You could support yourself by the picture in the book with your name.\\" Moseley discovered that George Hunt Williamson, another prominent contactee and friend of Adamski, did not witness any UFO nor Adamski's encounter with Orthon, despite his public statements claiming otherwise. When Irma Baker, Jerrold Baker's wife, accused him of lying about the incident, Williamson told her cryptically that \\"sometimes to gain admittance, one has to go around the back door.\\" In his report on Adamski, Moseley wrote \\"I do believe most definitely that Adamski's narrative contains enough flaws to place in very serious doubt both his veracity and his sincerity. The reader will be moved to make for himself a careful re-evaluation of the worth of Adamski's book.\\"Peebles, p. 120 =Air Force investigation= In the early-to- mid 1950s USAF Captain Edward J. Ruppelt was the head of Project Blue Book, the Air Force group assigned to investigate UFO reports. In 1953 Captain Ruppelt decided to investigate Adamski's UFO claims. He traveled to California's Palomar Mountain and, dressed in civilian attire to avoid attracting attention, attended one of Adamski's lectures before a large crowd at his Palomar Gardens Cafe. Ruppelt concluded that Adamski was a talented con artist whose UFO stories were designed to make money from his gullible followers and listeners, and he compared Adamski to the famed hoaxer, carnival, and circus showman PT Barnum. In describing Adamski's speaking style, Ruppelt wrote \\"to look at the man and listen to his story you had an immediate urge to believe him ... he was dressed in well-worn, but neat, overalls. He had slightly graying hair and the most honest pair of eyes I've ever seen. He spoke softly and naively, almost pathetically, giving the impression that 'most people think I'm crazy, but honestly, I'm really not.'\\" According to Ruppelt, Adamski had a persuasive effect on his audience, \\"you could actually have heard the proverbial pin drop\\" in the restaurant as Adamski told of his initial 1952 meeting with Orthon. When Adamski finished his story, Ruppelt noted that many of his listeners purchased copies of Adamski's UFO photos that were on sale in the restaurant. At another lecture led by Adamski and other well-known contactees, Ruppelt wrote that \\"people shelled out hard cash to hear Adamski's story.\\" Ruppelt believed \\"the common undertone to many of these [contactee] stories ... is Utopia. On these other worlds there is no illness, they've learned how to cure all diseases. There are no wars, they've learned how to live peaceably. There is no poverty, everyone has everything he wants. There is no old age, they have learned the secret of eternal life ... Too many times this subtle pitch can be boiled down to, \\"Step right up folks and put a donation in the pot. I'm just on the verge of learning the spaceman's secrets and with a little money to carry out my work I'll give you the secret.\\" According to Ruppelt, by 1960 Adamski's UFO lectures, and in particular his first two books, had made him an affluent man: \\"[His] hamburger stand is boarded up and he now lives in a big ranch house. He vacations in Mexico and has his own clerical staff. His two books Flying Saucers Have Landed and Inside the Space Ships have sold ... 200,000 copies and have been translated into every language except Russian.\\" Ruppelt humorously noted that by 1960 two \\"beautiful spacewomen\\" who claimed to be Nordic aliens were dating Adamski, a blonde from Saturn called \\"Kalna\\" and another woman named \\"Ilmuth\\".

Rationing controls the size of the ration, which is one's allowed portion of the resources being distributed on a particular day or at a particular time. There are many forms of rationing, and in western civilization people experience some of them in daily life without realizing it.Cox, Stan (2013). \\"Any way you slice it: The past, present and future of rationing\\". New Press Books. Rationing is often done to keep price below the market-clearing price determined by the process of supply and demand in an unfettered market. Thus, rationing can be complementary to price controls. An example of rationing in the face of rising prices took place in the various countries where there was rationing of gasoline during the 1973 energy crisis. A reason for setting the price lower than would clear the market may be that there is a shortage, which would drive the market price very high. High prices, especially in the case of necessities, are undesirable with regard to those who cannot afford them. Traditionalist economists argue, however, that high prices act to reduce waste of the scarce resource while also providing incentive to produce more. Rationing using ration stamps is only one kind of non-price rationing. For example, scarce products can be rationed using queues. This is seen, for example, at amusement parks, where one pays a price to get in and then need not pay any price to go on the rides. Similarly, in the absence of road pricing, access to roads is rationed in a first come, first served queueing process, leading to congestion. Authorities which introduce rationing often have to deal with the rationed goods being sold illegally on the black market. Despite the fact that rationing systems are sometimes necessary as the only viable option for societies facing severe consumer goods shortages, they are usually extremely unpopular with the general public, as they enforce limits on individual consumption. Civilian rationing Rationing has been instituted during wartime for civilians. For example, each person may be given what's known as a ‚Äúration coupon‚Äù allowing him or her to purchase a certain amount of a product each month. Rationing often includes food and other necessities for which there is a shortage, including materials needed for the war effort such as rubber tires, leather shoes, clothing and fuel. Rationing of food and water may also become necessary during an emergency, such as a natural disaster or terror attack. In the U.S., the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has established guidelines for civilians on rationing food and water supplies when replacements are not available. According to FEMA standards, every person should have a minimum of per day of water, and more for children, nursing mothers and the ill. =Origins= First World War German government propaganda poster describing rationing with personifications of meat, bread, sugar, butter, milk and meal (1916) Military sieges have often resulted in shortages of food and other essential consumables. In such circumstances, the rations allocated to an individual are often determined based on age, sex, race or social standing. During the Siege of Lucknow (part of the Indian Rebellion of 1857) a woman received three quarters the food ration a man received and children received only half. During the Siege of Ladysmith in the early stages of the Boer War in 1900 white adults received the same food rations as soldiers while children received half that. Food rations for Indian people and black people were significantly smaller. The first modern rationing systems were brought in during the First World War. In Germany, suffering from the effects of the British blockade, a rationing system was introduced in 1914 and was steadily expanded over the following years as the situation worsened. Although Britain did not suffer from food shortages, as the sea lanes were kept open for food imports, panic buying towards the end of the war prompted the rationing of first sugar and then meat. It is said to have in the most part benefited the health of the country, through the 'levelling of consumption of essential foodstuffs'.Beckett attributes this quotation (page 382) to Margaret Barnett, but does not give further details. To assist with rationing, ration books were introduced on 1918 for butter, margarine, lard, meat and sugar. During the war, average calories intake decreased only three percent, but protein intake six percent. Food rationing appeared in Poland after the First World War, and ration stamps were in use until the end of the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. =Second World War= Child's ration book, used in Britain during the Second World War Rationing became common during the Second World War. Ration stamps were often used. These were redeemable stamps or coupons, and every family was issued a set number of each kind of stamp based on the size of the family, ages of children and income. The British Ministry of Food refined the rationing process in the early 1940s to ensure the population did not starve when food imports were severely restricted and local production limited due to the large number of men fighting the war. Rationing on a scientific basis was pioneered by Elsie Widdowson and Robert McCance at the Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Cambridge. They worked on the chemical composition of the human body, and on the nutritional value of different flours used to make bread. Widdowson also studied the impact of infant diet on human growth. They studied the differing effects from deficiencies of salt and of water and produced the first tables to compare the different nutritional content of foods before and after cooking. They co- authored The Chemical Composition of Foods, first published in 1940 by the Medical Research Council. Their book \\"McCance and Widdowson\\" became known as the dietician's bible and formed the basis for modern nutritional thinking. Dig for Victory\\" campaign, encouraging Britons to supplement their rations by cultivating gardens and allotments In 1939, they tested whether the United Kingdom could survive with only domestic food production if U-boats ended all imports. Using 1938 food-production data, they fed themselves and other volunteers a limited diet, while simulating the strenuous wartime physical work Britons would likely have to perform. The scientists found that the subjects' health and performance remained very good after three months. They also headed the first ever mandated addition of vitamins and mineral to food, beginning with adding calcium to bread. Their work became the basis of the wartime austerity diet promoted by the Minister of Food Lord Woolton. Britons' actual wartime diet was never as severe as in the Cambridge study because imports from America successfully avoided the U-boats, but rationing improved the health of British people; infant mortality declined and life expectancy rose, discounting deaths caused by hostilities. This was because it ensured that everyone had access to a varied diet with enough vitamins. The first commodity to be controlled was gasoline. On 8 January 1940, bacon, butter and sugar were rationed. This was followed by successive ration schemes for meat, tea, jam, biscuits, breakfast cereals, cheese, eggs, lard, milk and canned and dried fruit. Fresh vegetables and fruit were not rationed but supplies were limited. Many people grew their own vegetables, greatly encouraged by the highly successful 'digging for victory' motivational campaign. Most controversial was bread; it was not rationed until after the war ended, but the \\"national loaf\\" of wholemeal bread replaced the ordinary white variety, to the distaste of most housewives who found it mushy, grey and easy to blame for digestion problems. Fish was not rationed but price increased considerably as the war progressed. Lining up at the Rationing Board office, New Orleans, 1943 In summer 1941 the British appealed to Americans to conserve food to provide more to go to Britons fighting in the Second World War. The Office of Price Administration warned Americans of potential gasoline, steel, aluminum and electricity shortages. It believed that with factories converting to military production and consuming many critical supplies, rationing would become necessary if the country entered the war. It established a rationing system after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In June 1942 the Combined Food Board was set up to coordinate the worldwide supply of food to the Allies, with special attention to flows from the U.S. and Canada to Britain. \\"An eager school boy gets his first experience in using War Ration Book Two. With many parents engaged in war work, children are being taught the facts of point rationing for helping out in family marketing.\\", 02/1943 American civilians first received ration books--War Ration Book Number One, or the \\"Sugar Book\\"--on 4 May 1942, through more than 100,000 school teachers, PTA groups and other volunteers. Sugar was the first consumer commodity rationed. Bakeries, ice cream makers and other commercial users received rations of about 70% of normal usage. Coffee was rationed nationally on 27 November 1942 to every five weeks. By the end of 1942, ration coupons were used for nine other items. Typewriters, gasoline, bicycles, footwear, silk, nylon, fuel oil, stoves, meat, lard, shortening and oils, cheese, butter, margarine, processed foods (canned, bottled, and frozen), dried fruits, canned milk, firewood and coal, jams, jellies and fruit butter were rationed by November 1943. The work of issuing ration books and exchanging used stamps for certificates was handled by some 5,500 local ration boards of mostly volunteer workers selected by local officials. As a result of the gasoline rationing, all forms of automobile racing, including the Indianapolis 500, were banned. All rationing in the United States ended in 1946. The diary of Tanya Savicheva, a girl of 11, her notes about starvation and deaths of her sister, then grandmother, then brother, then uncle, then another uncle, then mother. The last three notes say \\"Savichevs died\\", \\"Everyone died\\" and \\"Only Tanya is left.\\" She died of progressive dystrophy shortly after the siege. In the Soviet Union food was rationed from 1941 to 1947. In particular, daily bread rations in sieged Leningrad were initially set at 800 grams. By the end of 1941 the bread rations were reduced to 250 grams for workers and 125 for everyone else, which resulted in surge of deaths caused by starvation. Starting from 1942 daily bread rations were increased to 350 grams for workers and 200 grams for everyone else. One of the documents of the period is the diary of Tanya Savicheva, who recorded the deaths of each member of her family during the siege. Rationing was also introduced to a number of British dominions, and colonies, with rationing of clothing imposed in Australia, from 12 June 1942, and certain foodstuffs from 1943. Canada rationed tea, coffee, sugar, butter and mechanical spares, between 1942 and 1947. Cochin, Travancore and Madras states, of British India, elected to ration grain between the fall of 1943, and Spring 1944. While Egypt introduced a ration card based subsidy, of essential foodstuffs, in 1945, that's persisted into the 21st century. =Peacetime rationing= Polish milk ration stamp from 1981‚Äì1983. Civilian peacetime rationing of food has also occurred in history, especially after natural disasters, during contingencies, or after failed governmental economic policies regarding production or distribution, as well as due to extensive austerity programs implemented to cut or restrict public spending in countries where the rationed goods previously relied on government procurement or subsidies, as was the case in Israel and Romania. In the United Kingdom, the rationing system remained in place for many years after the end of the War. In some respects it was more strict after the war than during it‚Äîtwo major foodstuffs that were never rationed during the war, bread and potatoes, went on ration after it (bread from 1946 to 1948, and potatoes for a time from 1947). Tea was still on ration until 1952. In 1953 rationing of sugar and eggs ended, and in 1954, all rationing finally ended when cheese and meats came off ration. Sugar was again rationed in 1974 after Caribbean producers began selling to the more lucrative United States market. Some centralized planned economies introduced a peacetime rationing system due to food shortages in the postwar period. North Korea and China did so in the 1970s and 1980s, as did Romania during Ceausescu's rule in the 1980s, the Soviet Union in 1990‚Äì1991, and from 1962‚Äìpresent in Cuba.http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/fe482 Tel Aviv residents standing in line to buy food rations, 1954 From 1949 to 1959, Israel was under a regime of austerity, during which a state of rationing was enforced. At first, only staple foods such as oil, sugar, and margarine were rationed, but it was later expanded, and eventually included furniture and footwear. Every month, each citizen would get food coupons worth 6 Israeli pounds, and every family would be allotted a given amount of food. The average Israeli diet was 2,800 calories a day, with additional calories for children, the elderly, and pregnant women. Following the 1952 reparations agreement with West Germany, and the subsequent influx of foreign capital, Israel's struggling economy was bolstered, and in 1953, most restrictions were cancelled. In 1958, the list of rationed goods was narrowed to just eleven, and in 1959, it was narrowed to only jam, sugar, and coffee. A man at a service station reads about the U.S. gasoline rationing system in an afternoon newspaper; a sign in the background states that no gasoline is available. 1974 Petroleum products were rationed in many countries following the 1973 oil crisis. The United States introduced odd‚Äìeven rationing for fuels during the crisis, which allowed only vehicles with even-numbered numberplates to fill up on gas one day and odd-numbered ones on another. Poland enacted rationing in 1981 to cope with economic crisis. The rationing system initially encompassed most of the population's daily necessities, but was gradually phased out over time, with the last ration being abolished in 1989. Cuba enacted rationing for basic goods in 1991 following the collapse of the Soviet Union, which had previously subsidised the island nation's economy. Rationing started being phased out in the year 2000 at the end of the \\"special period\\", as Cuba had shifted to a more diversified and self-sustaining economy. Rationing, however, was not fully abolished and instead turned into an alternative way to purchase goods, in addition to the markets. This makes a curious departure from classical rationing, as during the 2001-2019 period, the rationing system was used in addition to, instead of as a replacement for regular markets. Cubans would be able to buy a certain amount of items at 'liberated' prices using ration coupons at a significantly reduced rate, while still being able to purchase more at regular market prices. This 'liberated' system persisted even during Cuba's period of economic growth and relative prosperity during the early and mid 2010s and enjoyed considerable popularity among the island's citizens. Cuba later re-introduced a classical limiting rationing system in 2019, following the imposition of strict sanctions on the island by US President Donald Trump, as well as the collapse of oil shipments from Venezuela, which was facing its own economic troubles at that time. Cuba's president pitched the new system as significantly more lenient than the 1991-2000 \\"special period\\", though admitted that it would negatively affect consumption. United States gasoline ration stamps printed, but not used, as a result of the 1973 oil crisis. Short-term rationing for gas and other fuels was introduced in the U.S. states of New Jersey and New York following Hurricane Sandy in 2012. In April 2019, Venezuela announced a 30-day electricity rationing regime in the face of power shortages. From 2015 to 2019, the US state of California gradually introduced permanent rationing on the use of water by limiting the daily household water expenditure. =Refugee aid rations= Aid agencies, such as the World Food Programme, provide fortnightly food rations and other essentials to refugees or internally displaced persons who are registered with the UNHCR and are either living in refugee camps or are supported in urban centres. Every registered refugee is given a ration card upon registration which is used for collecting the rations from food distribution centres. The amount of 2,100 kcal allocated per person per day is based on minimal standards and frequently not achieved, such as in Kenya.https://www.wfp.org/faqs#faq14https://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/wfp- forced-reduce-food-rations-refugees-kenya According to article 20 of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees refugees shall be treated at least like nationals in relation to rationing, if there is a general rationing system in place, used for the population at large. Other types =Health care rationing= As the British Royal Commission on the National Health Service observed in 1979, \\"whatever the expenditure on health care, demand is likely to rise to meet and exceed it.\\" Rationing health care to control costs is regarded as an explosive issue in the US, but in reality health care is rationed everywhere. In places where the government provides healthcare rationing is explicit. In other places people are denied treatment because of personal lack of funds, or because of decisions made by insurance companies. The American Supreme Court approved paying doctors to ration care, saying that there must be \\"some incentive connecting physician reward with treatment rationing\\". Shortages of organs for donation forces the rationing of organs for transplant even where funding is available. See also Healthcare rationing in the United States =Credit rationing= The concept in economics and banking of credit rationing describes the situation when a bank limits the supply of loans, although it has enough funds to loan out, and the supply of loans has not yet equalled the demand of prospective borrowers. Changing the price of the loans (interest rate) does not equilibrate the demand and supply of the loans. =Carbon rationing= Personal carbon trading refers to proposed emissions trading schemes under which emissions credits are allocated to adult individuals on a (broadly) equal per capita basis, within national carbon budgets. Individuals then surrender these credits when buying fuel or electricity. Individuals wanting or needing to emit at a level above that permitted by their initial allocation would be able to engage in emissions trading and purchase additional credits. Conversely, those individuals who emit at a level below that permitted by their initial allocation have the opportunity to sell their surplus credits. Thus, individual trading under Personal Carbon Trading is similar to the trading of companies under EU ETS. Personal carbon trading is sometimes confused with carbon offsetting due to the similar notion of paying for emissions allowances, but is a quite different concept designed to be mandatory and to guarantee that nations achieve their domestic carbon emissions targets (rather than attempting to do so via international trading or offsetting). Rationing mechanisms The purpose of rationing is to guarantee a minimum of some resource or to impose a maximum to its use. (The latter is the case with carbon rationing, where the scarcity is artificial.) Usually, government determines a fair ration, for example, one proportional to the number of family members. If participants possess different rights on a portion (even when they have the same need) and there is not enough for everyone, then one of the many algorithms for solving the bankruptcy problem may apply. At other times, the ration can only be estimated by the beneficiary, like a factory for which energy is to be rationed. In such cases, a mechanism is needed to discourage misreporting the needs or wants (i.e. to meet strategy-proofness.) Suppose every participant reports an ideal ration. For so-called uniform rationing, each ration is set to the minimum of the participant's ideal ration and a cap, the cap being determined so that the sum of the rations equals the amount available. So, loosely speaking, the participant asking least will be served first. This mechanism is strategy-proof, avoids unnecessary waste (Pareto optimality) and equally treats equals (anonymity.) In fact, it is the only such mechanism. (Anonymity in this statement can be replaced by envyfreeness.) For the redistribution of scarce goods to demanders by suppliers, see non-monetary microeconomies. For smooth supply chain management the supplies may be rationed, which is sometimes referred to as the rationing game.

The first site was at Farnborough Airfield (\\"RAE Farnborough\\") in Hampshire to which was added a second site RAE Bedford (Bedfordshire) in 1946. In 1988 it was renamed the Royal Aerospace Establishment before merging with other research entities to become part of the new Defence Research Agency in 1991. History In 1904‚Äì1906 the Army Balloon Factory, which was part of the Army School of Ballooning, under the command of Colonel James Templer, relocated from Aldershot to the edge of Farnborough Common in order to have enough space to inflate the new \\"dirigible balloon\\" or airship which was then under construction.Walker, P; Early Aviation at Farnborough, Volume I: Balloons, Kites and Airships, Macdonald, 1971.Colonel Templer and the birth of aviation at Farnborough, May 2007, Royal Aeronautical Society, p 13 Templer's place was taken by Colonel John Capper and Templer himself retired in 1908. Besides balloons and airships, the factory also experimented with Samuel Franklin Cody's war kites and aeroplanes designed both by Cody and J. W. Dunne. In October 1908 Cody made the first aeroplane flight in Britain at Farnborough.Colonel Templer and the birth of aviation at Farnborough, May 2007, Royal Aeronautical Society, p 3 In 1909 Army work on aeroplanes ceased and the Factory was brought under civilian control. Capper was replaced as Superintendent by Mervyn O'Gorman. In 1912 the Balloon Factory was renamed the Royal Aircraft Factory (RAF).Colonel Templer and the birth of aviation at Farnborough, May 2007, Royal Aeronautical Society, p 12 Its first new designer was Geoffrey de Havilland who later founded his own company. Later colleagues included John Kenworthy who became chief engineer and designer at the Austin Motor Company in 1918 and who went on to found the Redwing Aircraft Co in 1930 (Flight International) and Henry Folland ‚Äì later chief designer at Gloster Aircraft Company, and founder of his own company Folland Aircraft. One of the designers in the engine department was Samuel Heron, who later went on to invent the sodium-filled poppet valve, instrumental in achieving greater power levels from piston engines. While at the RAF, Heron designed a radial engine that he was not able to build during his time there, however upon leaving the RAF he then went to Siddeley-Deasy where the design, the RAF.8, was developed as the Jaguar. Heron later moved to the United States where he worked on the design of the Wright Whirlwind. Other engineers included Major F.M. Green, G.S. Wilkinson, James E. \\"Jimmy\\" Ellor, Prof. A.H. Gibson, and A.A. Griffith. Both Ellor and Griffith would later go on to work for Rolls-Royce Limited.World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines, 5th edition\\" by Bill Gunston, Sutton Publishing, 2006, p. 209 In 1918 the Royal Aircraft Factory was once more renamed, becoming the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) to avoid confusion with the Royal Air Force, which was formed on 1 April 1918, and because it had relinquished its manufacturing role to concentrate on research. During WWII the Marine Aircraft Experimental Establishment, then based at Helensburgh in Scotland, was under the control of the RAE. In 1946 work began to convert RAF Thurleigh into RAE Bedford. Engineers at the Royal Aircraft Establishment invented high strength carbon fibre in 1963. In 1961, the world's first grooved runway for reduced aquaplaning was constructed. In 1965, a US delegation visited to view the new surfacing practice and initiated a study by the FAA and NASA. On 1 May 1988 the RAE was renamed the Royal Aerospace Establishment. On 1 April 1991 the RAE was merged into the Defence Research Agency (DRA), the MOD's new research organisation. Then, on 1 April 1995 the DRA and other MOD organisations merged to form the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA). The Bedford site was largely shut down in 1994. In 2001 DERA was part-privatised by the MOD, resulting in two separate organisations, the state-owned Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL), and the privatised company QinetiQ. Royal Aircraft Factory =Aircraft Factory designs= Between 1911 and 1918 the Royal Aircraft Factory produced a number of aircraft designs. Most of these were essentially research aircraft, but a few actually went into mass production, especially during the war period. Some orders were met by the factory itself, but the bulk of production was by private British companies, some of which had not previously built aircraft. Up to about 1913 the designation letters referred to the general layout of the aircraft, derived from a French manufacturer or designer famous for that type: * S.E. = Santos Experimental (Canard or tail-first layout) * B.E. = Bl√©riot Experimental (Tractor or propeller-first layout) * F.E. = Farman Experimental (Pusher or propeller behind the pilot layout) From 1913/4 onwards this was changed to a designation based on the role for which the aircraft was designed: * A.E. = Armed or Armoured Experimental * C.E. = Coastal Experimental (e.g. Royal Aircraft Factory C.E.1 ‚Äì prototype only) * F.E. = Fighting experimental (although they remained \\"Farmans\\" in the sense of being pushers) * N.E. = Night Experimental (e.g. Royal Aircraft Factory N.E.1 ‚Äì prototype only) * R.E. = Reconnaissance experimental (two-seat machines) * S.E. = Scout experimental fast single-seat aircraft. The B.S.1 of 1913 was a one-off anomaly, combining both systems: Bl√©riot (tractor) Scout (fighter). R.T. & T.E. were also used for strictly one off prototypes. =Designs produced= Several aircraft were produced during the days as the Army Balloon Factory. These include the airships as well as the Cody and Dunne designs. Subsequent Royal Aircraft Factory type designations are inconsistent and confusing. For instance the \\"F.E.2\\" designation refers to three quite distinct types, with only the same broad layout in common, the F.E.2 (1911), the F.E.2 (1913), and finally the famous wartime two-seat fighter and general purpose design, the F.E.2 (1914). This last aircraft was the one that went into production, and had three main variants, the F.E.2a, F.E.2b, and the F.E.2d. As if this wasn't enough, there is the F.E.2c; this was a generic description rather than a subtype proper, and refers to several one-off conversions of F.E.2b's that experimentally reversed the seating positions of the pilot and the observer. The B.E.1 was basically the prototype for the early B.E.2 but the B.E.2c was almost a completely new aeroplane, with very little common with the earlier B.E.2 types apart from engine and fuselage. On the other hand, the B.E.3 to the B.E.7 were all effectively working prototypes for the B.E.8 and were all very similar in design, with progressive minor modifications of the kind that many aircraft undergo during a production run. The B.E.8a was at least as different from the B.E.8 as the B.E.7 was. The S.E.4a had nothing in common at all with the S.E.4, while the S.E.5a was simply a late production S.E.5 with a more powerful engine. Several early RAF designs were officially \\"reconstructions\\" of existing aircraft, because the Factory did not initially have official authority to build aircraft to their own design. In most cases the type in question used no parts whatever from the wreck, in some cases not even the engine.

This slowly gained currency, especially because of the undeniable fact that the B.E.2c and B.E.2e were kept in production and in service long after they were obsolete and that the B.E.12 and B.E.12a were indisputable failures. Some of this criticism was prejudiced and ill-informed.John Lloyd Aircraft of World War I 1958 Ian Allan publisher, Surrey, UK Some aviation historians continue to perpetuate the resulting belittling of the important experimental work of the Factory during this period, and the exaggeration of the failings of Factory production types, several of which were described in sensationally derogatory terms.Jane's Fighting Aircraft of World War I Military Press, New York 1990‚Äî.cn A modern, rather more \\"pro-factory\\" point of view, can be found in several of the volumes of War Planes of the First World War, by J.M. Bruce‚ÄîMacDonald, London, 1965. Superintendents The first five Superintendents at Farnborough The Superintendents of the School of Ballooning were James Templer (1878‚Äì1906) and John Capper (1906 ‚Äì 1909). The following have served as Superintendents of the Royal Aircraft Factory / Establishment: *Mervyn O'Gorman (1912-1916) - Also Superintendent of the Balloon Factory from 1909‚Äì1912 *Henry Fowler (1916-1918) *Sidney Smith (1918-) Changes After the end of the First World War, design and development of aircraft types ended ‚Äì although work continued on general research, and the development of missiles. Research included wind tunnel testing and other aeronautical research, areas which offered rare opportunities for women in STEM fields at this time with examples including Frances Bradfield who worked at the RAE for her entire career from 1919 to her retirement; Johanna Weber, a German mathematician who joined the RAE after World War II as part of Operation Surgeon to exploit German aeronautical researchers and technicians and bring them to the UK; and Beatrice Shilling who went on to invent Miss Shilling's orifice, to improve the engine performance of RAF Hurricane and Spitfire fighters during the Battle of Britain as part of wider work at the RAE on aircraft engine problems during World War II. In 1930 the RAE developed the Robot Air Pilot, an autopilot that used a gyro and flight controls that functioned by compressed air.\\"Robot Air Pilot Keeps Plane on True Course\\" Popular Mechanics, December 1930 Aircraft that were developed or tested at the RAE included the Hawker Siddeley Harrier and Concorde. =Aircraft= * RAE Hurricane * RAE Scarab * RAE Zephyr =Missiles= * RAE Target‚ÄîSurface-to-surface missile project from the early 1920s. * RAE Larynx‚Äî1927 unmanned pilotless aircraft, surface-to-surface anti- ship missile. * Malkara missile =Rockets= In the late fifties and through the sixties work proceeded at the RAE on several rocket projects ‚Äì all of which were eventually abandoned A model of the Miles M.52 undergoing supersonic wind tunnel testing at the RAE circa 1946 * R.A.E. ‚Äì Vickers Transonic Research Rocket * Black Arrow * Black Prince * Black Knight * Jaguar * Skylark =Space satellites= * Orba X-2 ‚Äì space satellite * Prospero X-3 ‚Äì space satellite Current use of the Farnborough site Reconstructed airship hangar at IQ Farnborough.

The historic Farnborough factory site houses three major wind tunnels, the 24' low speed wind tunnel (Q121 Building), constructed during the early 1930s, the No. 2 11.5' low speed wind tunnel (R136 Building) and the 8' x 6' transonic wind tunnel within R133 Building, which was originally commissioned in the early 1940s as a 10' x 7' high subsonic speed tunnel, but converted during the mid-1950s. A smaller 2' x 1.5' transonic tunnel is housed in R133 Building, while R52 Building contains the remaining 4' x 3' low turbulence wind tunnel. R52 Building had previously housed two early 10' x 7' low speed tunnels in separate bays, which were replaced by the No. 1 11.5' and 4' x 3' tunnels respectively. The former remains in operation at the University of Southampton. R52 building also previously contained a 5' open jet low speed tunnel, originally built as a sub-scale prototype for the larger 24' tunnel, but subsequently modified for use as a noise measurement facility. Both Q121 and R133 are now Grade I listed buildings. To the west of the Farnborough site is the 5 metre pressurised low speed wind tunnel, which was commissioned in the late 1970s. This facility remains in operation by QinetiQ, primarily for the development and testing of aircraft high lift systems. Fictional appearance The hero of Nevil Shute's 1948 novel No Highway is an eccentric \\"boffin\\" at Farnborough who predicts metal fatigue in Britain's new airliner, the fictional \\"Rutland Reindeer\\". The Comets failed for just this reason in 1954, although in the case of the Comet I the problem was in the metal structure around the squared windows, while the point of failure in the Reindeer aircraft was in the structure of the rear empennage/fuselage joints. A film version of the novel, No Highway in the Sky, appeared in 1951, starring James Stewart as the protagonist. Stewart prepared for the role by shadowing Fred Jones OBE, a co-founder of the RAE Accident Section. Jones later was head of Structures Section (formerly Airworthiness Section) from 1957 to 1980.

Lisa was among the founders, in St. Louis, of the Missouri Fur Company, an early fur trading company. Manuel Lisa gained respect through his trading among Native American tribes of the upper Missouri River region, such as the Teton Sioux, Omaha and Ponca. After being appointed, as US Indian agent, during the War of 1812, Lisa used his standing among the tribes to encourage their alliance with the United States and their warfare against tribes allied with the United Kingdom.Primm, 125. While still married to a European-American woman in St. Louis, where he kept a residence, in 1814 Lisa married Mitane, a daughter of Big Elk, the principal chief of the Omaha people, as part of securing their alliance. They had two children together, whom Lisa provided for equally in his will with his children by his other marriage. Early life Little is known of the early life of Manuel Lisa, but he is believed to have been born in 1772 in New Orleans, then part of Spanish Louisiana. It was ceded to Spain by France after the British victory in the Seven Years' War, when the British gained Florida in exchange with Spain for French lands west of the Mississippi River.Goodwin, 152.Certain sources suggest Lisa was born in the West Indies, possibly Cuba. Chittenden, 125. His father, Christoval de Lisa, was born in Murcia, Spain, while his mother, Maria Ignacia Rodriguez, was born to a colonial family in St. Augustine, Florida. It is likely that Christoval came to Spanish Louisiana in the service of the governor Alejandro O'Reilly, who started his tenure in 1769. Manuel had, at least, one elder brother, Joaquin Lisa, who worked with him in his early trade expeditions. By 1789, Manuel Lisa and his brother Joaquin were trading on the Mississippi River in New Madrid, Missouri; the next recorded mention of Manuel Lisa was again in New Madrid, after he had returned from trading along the Wabash River. Marriage and family By 1796 Lisa had married Polly Charles Chew (d. 1817), a young widow from New Orleans. After he obtained a land grant in the Missouri area, they relocated to St. Louis, which was the center of the region's thriving fur trade, established primarily by French colonists, some also from New Orleans. Polly Lisa lived in the city with their three children while her husband made his long expeditions to various Indian territories on the Upper Missouri River. After founding Fort Lisa about 1813, a post in what is now part of Omaha, Nebraska, Lisa worked to gain alliances with local tribes, such as the Omaha. After being appointed US Indian agent in the area by the governor of the Missouri Territory, in 1814 Lisa married Mitane, a daughter of Big Elk, the principal chief of the Omaha until 1846. Both sides saw it as a strategic alliance. Lisa and Mitane had two children together, Rosalie and Christopher, born in subsequent years after Lisa's expeditions and wintering over at Fort Lisa. \\"Kinship and ties of affinity proved more than merely useful to the traders. They were both a source of power and a necessity if one was to achieve success in the trade.\\"Bieder, p. 3 Only traders were accepted for marriages to high-status women, such as the daughters of chiefs, as the chiefs saw such marriages as a way to increase their own power. As the Omaha had a patrilineal system, the children of Lisa and Mitane were considered \\"white\\" as their father was \\"white\\". The tribe protected them, but unless such mixed-race children were officially adopted by a man of the tribe, they were not considered Omaha and had no real place in a gens (clan), the basic kinship unit.

After his return the following year, on August 5, 1818, Lisa married the widow Mary Hempstead Keeny, a sister of his friend, the attorney Edward Hempstead. As a widow, she had migrated with her parents and siblings from Connecticut to join four brothers already in Missouri.Smith, 19-24.Note: Although Lisa was a Catholic, he was \\"evidently not a very punctilious follower,\\" as he not only married a Presbyterian, but also agreed to a marriage conducted by Salmon Giddings, founder of the Presbyterian church in St. Louis. Chittenden, 134. He had also overlooked his marriage with Mitane.) In 1819 Lisa took his new wife Mary with him for his next expedition and winter at Fort Lisa, Nebraska. He tried to gain custody of his children with Mitane. She let him take Rosalie back to St. Louis the next year for education at a Catholic school, but refused to let him have Christopher. Lisa included provisions for both Rosalie and Christopher in his will, along with his children by his first wife Polly Chew. Only Rosalie Lisa Ely (c. 1815-1904) survived to adulthood, married and had children.Goodwin, p. 155 Land in the Louisiana Territory In 1799, Manuel Lisa requested a land grant; according to his letter to the Spanish governor, Manuel wanted it \\"upon one of the banks of the River Missouri, in a place where may be found some small creek emptying into the said river, in order to facilitate the raising of cattle, and, with time, to be able to make shipments of salted and dried meat to the capital. After being awarded the grant, Manuel Lisa and his wife relocated to St. Louis, where they purchased a home on Second Street near the Mississippi River. Early trade expeditions Lisa likely moved to St. Louis to enter the fur trade, the major part of the regional economy. By 1802, he had obtained a trade monopoly from French officials (the territory had traded hands again) with the Osage Nation. (The monopoly had formerly been held by Auguste Chouteau, a French colonist and first settler of St. Louis). But, after the Louisiana Purchase and annexation of the territory by the United States, Lisa's relationship with the new government officials was not as strong. He competed with Pierre Chouteau, a prominent member of the founding family, who had gained a position as a U.S. government Indian agent; Chouteau and his brother had gained their wealth and social positions through the fur trade and as merchants. Lisa had difficult relations with James Wilkinson, then-governor of U.S. Louisiana Territory. Later found to have been a secret agent of the Spanish Crown, Wilkinson denied Lisa's requests to establish trade routes to Santa Fe, New Mexico, which was still under Spanish colonial rule. In 1806, Wilkinson warned Zebulon Pike, undertaking Pike's Expedition, to prevent Lisa's efforts to make business connections to Santa Fe.Chittenden, 127. Having been stymied by the government and the Chouteau family, Lisa began organizing a trade expedition to the upper Missouri River region. On the first expedition, which departed in April 1807, Lisa and his company of 42 men (including John Colter, George Drouillard or Benito V√°zquez) St Louis Cathedral Records; Vasquez papers file, Missouri Historical Society Library: Pierre Louis Vasquez Bible in possession of Douglas Whitney. moved up the Missouri until they reached the mouth of the Yellowstone River. After ascending the Yellowstone some 170 miles, Lisa established a trading post on November 21 at the mouth of the Bighorn River in present-day Montana. Named Fort Raymond for his son (also known as Fort Manuel), it was the first such outpost in the upper Missouri region. Lisa assigned John Colter of his party to explore the region and trade with the nearby Blackfeet tribe. During his exploration, Colter became the first known European to visit what is now known as Yellowstone National Park; he reported on what was named the eponymous Colter's Hell. In July 1808, after a successful trading season, Lisa departed Fort Raymond, leaving behind a small party of men for the winter. While operations from the area were profitable for Lisa, the outpost suffered frequent attacks by the Blackfeet. During these years of Lisa's expeditions to the upper Missouri, his wife Polly and children stayed in St. Louis.Sheldon, ?. Sketch of Fort Lisa, North Dakota. Creation of the Missouri Fur Company Upon his return to St. Louis in August 1808, Lisa established the Missouri Fur Company (sometimes referred to as the St. Louis Missouri Fur Company), a joint venture with Jean Pierre Chouteau, Pierre Chouteau, Jr., William Clark, Andrew Henry, Francois Marie Benoit, and other prominent St. Louis fur traders.Chittenden, 126. Jean Pierre Chouteau had also come from New Orleans, so the two men had ties to its French and Spanish Creole community. The company was created as a temporary trust by its founders, designed to either expire or reorganize after three years. In the spring of 1809, Lisa returned to Fort Raymond with a major expedition, made up of 350 men, about half of whom were Americans, the rest French Canadians and Creoles. They had 13 barges and keel-boats loaded with food, munitions, and articles suitable for the Indian trade, and the trip up the Missouri River was slow. Lisa transferred the fort's contents to the new company, and abandoned the isolated post. Directing the large force of men, Lisa built the first Fort Lisa (also called Fort Manuel) near what is now Bismarck, North Dakota. It was near a Gros Ventres village between the mouth of the Little Missouri and the Knife rivers.Robeson, ?. After the new fort was constructed, Lisa returned to St. Louis in October 1809. The next year, he ascended the river to Fort Lisa and conducted more trading operations. He returned to St. Louis in the autumn of 1810. In April 1811, Lisa began a final expedition of the Missouri Fur Company's first three years; he had two goals: to locate the then-lost fur trader Andrew Henry, and to transport the remaining property from Fort Lisa to St. Louis. The expedition became famous in its day as the company's barges heading up the Missouri overtook the rival Astor Expedition, led by William Price Hunt for the American Fur Company, which had set out three weeks earlier. Lisa remained among the Mandan and Arikara tribes until Henry came downriver, and they returned to St. Louis together at the end of 1811. In 1811 Lisa was host to the first recorded tourist to present-day South Dakota: Pittsburgh lawyer Henry Marie Brackenridge. When the Missouri Fur Company was reorganized during the winter of 1811-1812, Lisa became more prominent among its leadership.Chittenden, p. 127 That year he built a brick home in St. Louis as a measure of his success.Primm, Lion of the Valley, p. 83 (Earlier he had built a stone warehouse for his fur company, which stood until the late 1930s, when it was demolished for other development.Primm, Lion of the Valley, p. 454 In May 1812, Lisa went upriver to Fort Lisa, trading there until his return to St. Louis on June 1, 1813. Lisa happened to be at Fort Lisa in North Dakota when Sacagawea, the historic interpreter and guide for the Lewis and Clark Expedition, died at the fort on December 20, 1812. She was buried there.Smithsonian. On this journey he established a new fort further downriver, also called Fort Lisa, in what is now the North Omaha area of Omaha, Nebraska. Lisa at that time became the first known United States settler of Nebraska. His outpost became among the most important in the region, and the basis for the development of the major city of Nebraska. War of 1812 In June 1812 the U.S. Congress voted to declare war on the United Kingdom. After Lisa's return to St. Louis in 1813, he heard fears expressed that British agents would encourage the upper Missouri tribes to attack settlements throughout the northern and western territories. The war disrupted the fur trade with the northern tribes on both sides of the border; in 1813 the British and American Indian allies burned Fort Lisa of North Dakota. Like other traders, Lisa had to suspend his operations for the period of the war. Early in 1814, William Clark, governor of the Missouri Territory, appointed Lisa as US Indian Agent to the tribes located above the mouth of the Kansas River, at an annual salary of $548. Lisa set out for Fort Lisa of Nebraska, where he secured alliances between the United States and Missouri-area tribes, such as the Omaha and Ponca. He was especially effective among the Teton Sioux further upriver in present-day Minnesota,Primm, Lion of the Valley, p. whom he organized to send war parties against tribes allied with the British. While securing these alliances, in 1814 Lisa took Mitain as a consort; she was the daughter of Big Elk, the principal chief of the Omaha people. (Lisa was still legally married to Polly, his first wife, but European-American men often took \\"country wives\\" among their Native American allies to build their relationships.)Chittenden, p. 133. Later, the U.S. government recognized Lisa, calling his efforts as a \\"great service in preventing British influence\\" in the northern area.American State Papers (4), 76, in Chittenden, 127. After the war's conclusion in 1815, Lisa renewed his yearly trade expeditions to the area, staying each winter at Fort Lisa, Nebraska. He eventually had two children with Mitain: Rosalie and Christopher.Kira Gale, \\"Escape from Death and a Sister‚Äôs Revenge: the Daughters of Omaha Chief Big Elk\\" , Lewis and Clark Road Trips, 13 April 2007, accessed 21 August 2011Chittenden, p. 127. Later life After the war, Lisa's reputation in St. Louis improved as a result of his success in the fur trade and having aided the Americans. In 1815, he invited 43 Native American chiefs and headmen from various tribes living between the Mississippi and Missouri to the city to strengthen their alliance with the Americans, and entertained them for about three weeks. He conducted them to Portage des Sioux to meet with the commissioners William Clark, Edwards and Auguste Chouteau to sign treaties of friendship. About two years later, he hosted another 24 chiefs from the Pawnee, Missouri and Sioux before another treaty signing.Goodwin, p. 153 Lisa's house in St. Louis Mary Manuel Lisa In St. Louis, Lisa was considered an ally of the landed elite.Primm, Lion of the Valley, pp. 111, 124. He became more affiliated with leading American members of St. Louis, including Edward Hempstead, a land claims attorney, and Thomas Hart Benton, editor of the St. Louis Enquirer.Primm, Lion of the Valley, p. 124. In the fall of 1817, while the trader was on an expedition up the Missouri, his first wife Polly Lisa died. In 1818 Lisa was with most of the residents in St. Louis who turned out to welcome the newly assigned Bishop Louis William Du Bourg. He had decided to make St. Louis the seat of the diocese of Louisiana and the Floridas. Lisa and other Creole families pledged substantial funds to build a church (now called the Old Cathedral) near the river that was fit for the diocese.Primm, Lion of the Valley, p. 93 After his return from that year's expedition, on August 5, 1818 Lisa married the widow Mary Hempstead Keeny (a sister of Edward Hempstead).Smith, pp. 12, 19-24Chittenden, p. 134. As a measure of Lisa's social standing, Pierre Chouteau was a witness at his second wedding.Primm, Lion of the Valley, p. 124 After living a year in St. Louis, Lisa took Mary with him for the winter of 1819-1820 to Fort Lisa in Nebraska (Mary Lisa reportedly became the first woman of European descent to travel so far up the Missouri River).Smith, 25. When he and Mary arrived, Lisa sent his second wife Mitain away from the fort. By the time of his 1819 expedition, Lisa had developed strong relationships with the Omaha, Ponca, Yankton and Teton Sioux, Mandan and Arikara peoples. He was instrumental in extending the \\"commercial outreach of St. Louis\\" to the Yellowstone and Bighorn rivers and to tribes previously more under British influence.Primm, pp. 124-125 By 1829 the Missouri Fur Company had invested capital of about $10,000, highest among the local firms.Primm, pp. 123-125 Although Lisa returned to St. Louis in good health in April 1820, he soon became ill.Chittenden, 129. The unidentified illness caused his death at Sulphur Springs (now within the city of St. Louis) on August 12, 1820. He was buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery at the Hempstead family plot.Chittenden, 129, 136.Smith, 26. Although his will provided for $2000 for each of his children upon reaching adulthood (including those by MitainPrimm, p. 124), there is no evidence that they received any money. The historian Chittenden believed Lisa left few assets to his estate.Chittenden, 134. After his death, Joshua Pilcher led the Missouri Fur Company to do business under various names until about 1830. By 1830, John Jacob Astor had gained a monopoly with his American Fur Company. As the fur trade had been declining overall with changes in taste, Pilcher dissolved the Missouri Fur Company.

Future History is a series of stories created by Robert A. Heinlein. It describes a projected future of the human race from the middle of the 20th century through the early 23rd century. The term Future History was coined by John W. Campbell Jr. in the February 1941 issue of Astounding Science Fiction. Campbell published an early draft of Heinlein's chart of the series in the May 1941 issue. Heinlein wrote most of the Future History stories early in his career, between 1939 and 1941 and between 1945 and 1950. Most of the Future History stories written prior to 1967 are collected in The Past Through Tomorrow, which also contains the final version of the chart. That collection does not include Universe and Common Sense; they were published separately as Orphans of the Sky. Groff Conklin called Future History \\"the greatest of all histories of tomorrow\\". It was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best All-Time Series in 1966, along with the Barsoom series by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the Lensman series by E. E. Smith, the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov, and The Lord of the Rings series by J. R. R. Tolkien, but lost to Asimov's Foundation series. Definition For the most part, The Past Through Tomorrow defines a core group of stories that are clearly within the Future History series. However, Heinlein scholars generally agree that some stories not included in the anthology belong to the Future History series, and that some that are included are only weakly linked to it. James Gifford; Gifford, Robert A. Heinlein: A Reader's Companion, 2000, pp. 11‚Äì16. adds Time Enough for Love, which was published after The Past Through Tomorrow, and also \\"Let There Be Light\\", which was not included in The Past Through Tomorrow, possibly because the collection editor disliked it or because Heinlein himself considered it to be inferior. However, he considers Time Enough for Love to be a borderline case. He considers The Number of the Beast, The Cat Who Walks Through Walls, and To Sail Beyond the Sunset to be too weakly linked to the Future History to be included. Bill Patterson includes To Sail Beyond the Sunset, on the theory that the discrepancies between it and the rest of the Future History are explained by assigning it to the same \\"bundle of related timelines\\" in the World as Myth multiverse. However, he lists a number of stories that he believes were never really intended to be part of Future History, even though they were included in The Past Through Tomorrow: \\"Life- Line\\" (which was written before Heinlein published the Future History chart; however, Lazarus Long does reference the protagonist of \\"Life-Line\\" and his device in \\"Time Enough for Love\\"), \\"The Menace from Earth\\", \\"‚ÄîWe Also Walk Dogs\\", and the stories originally published in the Saturday Evening Post (\\"Space Jockey\\", \\"It's Great to Be Back!\\", \\"The Green Hills of Earth\\", and \\"The Black Pits of Luna\\"). He agrees with Gifford that \\"Let There Be Light\\" should be included. The story \\"‚ÄîAnd He Built a Crooked House‚Äî\\" was included only in the pre-war chart and never since. The Heinlein juveniles do not hew closely to the Future History outline. Gifford states that \\"Although the twelve juvenile novels are not completely inconsistent with the Future History, neither do they form a thorough match with that series for adult readers. It is not often recognized that they are a reasonably consistent 'Future History' of their own... At least one major story specified in the Future History chart, the revolution on Venus, ended up being told in the framework of the juveniles as Between Planets.\\"Gifford, Robert A. Heinlein: A Reader's Companion, 2000, p. 24 The novel Variable Star, written by Spider Robinson from Heinlein's detailed outline, incorporates some elements of both the Future History (such as references to Nehemiah Scudder) and the universe of the Heinlein juveniles (for example, torch ships and faster-than-light telepathic communication between twins). The adult short story \\"The Long Watch\\", included in Future History story collections, connects to Space Cadet through the character of (John) Ezra Dahlquist, the central character of the first, memorialized in the second.Gifford, p. 116 Stories never written The chart published in the collection Revolt in 2100 includes several unwritten stories, which Heinlein describes in a postscript. \\"Fire Down Below\\", about a revolution in Antarctica, would have been set in the early 21st century. Three more unwritten stories fill in the history from just before \\"Logic of Empire\\" in the early 21st century through the beginning of \\"If This Goes On‚Äî\\". \\"The Sound of His Wings\\" covers Nehemiah Scudder's early life as a television evangelist through his rise to power as the First Prophet. \\"Eclipse\\" describes independence movements on Mars and Venus. \\"The Stone Pillow\\" details the rise of the resistance movement from the early days of the theocracy through the beginning of \\"If This Goes On‚Äî\\". These stories were key points in the Future History, so Heinlein gave a rough description of Nehemiah Scudder which made his reign easy to visualize‚Äîa combination of John Calvin, Girolamo Savonarola, Joseph Franklin Rutherford, and Huey Long. His rise to power began when one of his flock, the widow of a wealthy man who would have disapproved of Scudder, died and left him enough money to establish a television station. He then teamed up with an ex-Senator and hired a major advertising agency. He was soon famous even off-world‚Äîmany bonded laborers on Venus saw him as a messianic figure. He had muscle as well‚Äîa re-creation of the Ku Klux Klan in everything but name. \\"Blood at the polls and blood in the streets, but Scudder won the election. The next election was never held.\\" Though this period was integral to the human diaspora that would follow several hundred years later, Heinlein stated that he was never able to write them because they featured Scudder prominently; he \\"dislike(d) him too much\\". Nehemiah Scudder already appears in Heinlein's earliest novel For Us, the Living: A Comedy of Customs (written 1938‚Äì1939, though first published in 2003). Scudder's early career as depicted in that book is virtually identical with the above‚Äîbut with the crucial difference that in the earlier version Scudder is stopped at the last moment by the counter-mobilization of Libertarians, and despite mass voter intimidation carries only Tennessee and Alabama. In fact, the Libertarian regime seen in full bloom in that book's 2086 came into being in direct reaction to Scudder's attempt to impose puritanical mores on the entire American society.

The main breeding area is Northwest boreal forest territories. Their breeding habits also take place in the eastern boreal region of Canada but no where near the same amount in the northwestern region. Winter months they are usually found in southern North America in lakes, ponds, rivers or bays. Ring-necked duck pairs start during spring migration. Unpaired ducks showing up on breeding grounds will most likely end up being non-breeders. The pairs stay together only for reproduction, until then, they separate. The nest is bowl-shaped, built on water in dense emergent vegetation with sedges and woody plants. The female lays one egg per day until 8 to 10 eggs are laid. They are incubated 25‚Äì29 days and the female may remain with the young until they are able to fly. Diet These birds are omnivores and feed mainly by diving or dabbling at the surface. Ducklings are dependent on animal matter such as insects, earthworms, leeches, midges and snails. As they mature they tend change their diet to submerged plants such as pondweed and coontail, and emergents such as annual wild rice and snails. Vagrancy This strong migrant is a rare but regular vagrant to western Europe. In Britain, occasional small flocks occur, including five at Loch Leven, Scotland in September 2003 and four at Standlake in Oxfordshire in April 2015. In Ireland one or two individuals can be seen at any time of year. Vagrant individuals also occur each year in Central America as far south as Costa Rica between October/November and May/June.

These specimens were collected 3 km north of the terminus of the Rio Cha√±ares at the Campo de Talampaya, and were described by Alfred Sherwood Romer in 1970.

The teeth include dully- tipped, partially developed canines, postcanines, four upper incisors that are positioned vertically, and three lower incisors that lean slightly forward.Soares, Marina Bento, Fernando Abdala, and Cristina Bertoni-Machado. \\"A Sectorial Toothed Cynodont (Therapsida) from the Triassic Santa Cruz Do Sul Fauna, Santa Maria Formation, Southern Brazil.\\" Geodiversitas 33.2 (2011): 265-78. Science Press. Web. 5 Mar. 2017. . The cheek teeth are slender from the sides, but are lengthened anteroposteriorly, with several cusps along the row. This pattern is consistent with that exhibited by other meat-eating cynodonts, which indicates Probainognathus was a carnivore, as well. This tooth pattern is similar to that of chiniquodontids, and is part of the proposed connection between them and Probainognathus.Colbert, E., & Morales, Michael. (1991). Evolution of the vertebrates : A history of the backboned animals through time (4th ed.). New York: Wiley-Liss. = Brain = Based on an endocranial cast of Probainognathus, several details have been extrapolated about its brain. Probainognathus‚Äô cerebral hemispheres were elongated, it had established olfactory bulbs, and a significant cerebellum and flooculi. These were among other, less pronounced, structures such as anterior colliculi. Because of these features, it has been suggested that Probainognathus‚Äô brain had visual, auditory, motor, and body sensory systems all present. And, as a whole, the brain of Probainognathus indicates that it was in the process of developing endothermy. = Skull = Probainognathus skull in palatal view The snout of Probainognathus extends beyond the premaxillary processes, and is very thin. The apparent fragility of this structure has led to it being broken off several specimens, and has led to an increased difficulty in studying it. There are several features that have been identified, however. The suborbital arch and the zygomatic arch are both shaped relatively sharply, and there is an extension of the squamosal posteriorly on the zygomatic arch. Probainognathus has a long secondary palate as it stretches all the way to the posterior end of the tooth row. In addition, the secondary palate is also formed largely by the palatine, and it is somewhat narrow. This narrowing of the palate allows for the conservation of space to be able to fit the back, lower molars. Moreover, the vomer is posterior to the secondary palate, and significant pterygoid flanges are present, as well. The skull of Probainognathus is, on average, around 7 cm in length, and is missing the parietal foramen. The skull is broad in proportion to its length, the face is short and narrow, but its zygomatic region is relatively large, seemingly for jaw muscle attachment. The skull also possesses a double occipital condyle, which is a typical mammalian feature. In comparison to close relatives, such as Probelesodon, the braincase of Probainognathus is more broad in the parietal region, and the oticoccipital region of the skull is deeper. Likewise, the parietals have more depth, the occipital crest is higher, and the orbits are proportionately larger relative to the rest of its head. The sagittal crest is also lengthened posteriorly, and splits into the occipital crests. This leads to a straighter posterior margin, and a more concave occiput in Probainognathus. = Jaw = Probainognathus skull The jaw of Probainognathus is of particular phylogenetic importance. Morphologically, the dentary makes up most the lower jaw, and it curves and extends down posteriorly to the area of the articular and jaw articulation. Correspondingly, in the upper jaw, the squamosal bone becomes situated next to the quadrate. The posterior end of this enlarged dentary fits into a small nook in the squamosal of the upper jaw, and displays the beginning of the evolution of the squamosal-dentary jaw joint. This squamosal-dentary jaw articulation is the same joint exhibited by mammals, and the inclusion of this joint in Probainognathus indicates that it is a precursor to mammals. Along with this osteological feature, the jaw of Probainognathus is suggested to have had mammal-like soft tissue advancements, as well. The jaw muscles in Probainognathus were thought to have been positioned farther forward, with the masseter splitting into two separate muscles: the superficial masseter and the deep masseter.Ridley, Mark. \\"Evolution - Fossils and the History of Life.\\" Evolution - Fossils and the History of Life. Blackwell Publishing, n.d. Web. 05 Mar. 2017. .Bard, J. (2017). Principles of evolution : System, species, and the history of life. London ; New York: Garland Science, Taylor & Francis Group. Despite this new development, the reptilian quadrate-articular jaw joint persists in Probainognathus, and a paired jaw joint is the result. Because of this, the jaw of Probainognathus remains distinct from that of mammals due mostly to the presence of the articular and the quadrate. Once the dentary-squamosal articulation becomes more established, the former bones involved in jaw articulation, the articular and quadrate, can become integrated into the inner ear as the malleus and incus, respectively. This has not yet happened in the case of Probainognathus, but the reduced size of the quadrate, as well as its loose association with the squamosal and proximity to the stapes indicates the quadrate to incus process is underway. This combination of evidence further solidifies Probainognathus‚Äô phylogenetic placement on the line to Mammalia, and provides a sound evolutionary connection between reptiles and mammals.  Paleoecology  Probainognathus was collected from the Cha√±ares Formation in La Rioja Province, Argentina. This locale is known for its preservation of Middle Triassic tetrapods, which are largely fossilized in volcanic concretions.Rogers, R., A. B. Arucci, F. Abdala, P. C. Sereno, C. A. Foster, and C. L. May. \\"Paleoenvironment and Taphonomy of the Cha√±ares Formation Tetrapod Assemblage (Middle Triassic), Northwestern Argentina: Spectacular Preservation in Volcanogenic Concretions.\\" Palaios 16 (2001): 461-81.Fernando Abdala (PhD). Web. 05 Mar. 2017. . When Probainognathus inhabited this area during the Middle Triassic, it is thought to have been a lacustrine region within a rift basin that got a large influx of sedimentary debris and volcanic ash. Various pieces of evidence suggest tetrapod mass mortality was the cause of death in the Cha√±ares Formation. Fossils of both young and adult specimens were found at this locale, and these are not limited to Probainognathus, but rather represent many taxa that fell victim to the event. There is also an unusual concentration of herbivores, carnivores, and omnivores in this formation. Numerous fossils of each type were found in close proximity to one another, despite the fact that this intermingling would normally be uncommon. It has, subsequently, been suggested that this unusual distribution of specimens could be due to the death event leaving these animals stranded with no other place to go, perhaps along a waterfront of some kind. The evidence at hand, especially the nature of volcanic preservation, has led to the postulation that volcanism played a role in the death event in some capacity. Suggested events include a large outpouring of ash, lethal gas surges, or, more likely, volcanism-induced flooding. Volcanic activity may have caused damming or other water diversion, which led to major widespread flooding in the area, and the death of Probainognathus and other tetrapods. Unfortunately, however, it remains uncertain whether volcanism was the direct cause of this major death event, or if it just aided in preservation after the fact.

A range of sensational, emotional and consequent sexual activities that may occur before or during early puberty, but before full sexual maturity is established. The development of child sexuality and the perception of child sexuality by adults is influenced by social and cultural aspects. The concept of child sexuality also played an important role in the classical psychoanalysis. History of research =Freud= Until Sigmund Freud published his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality in 1905, children were often regarded as asexual, having no sexuality until later development. Freud was one of the first researchers to seriously study child sexuality. While his ideas, such as psycho-sexual development and the Oedipus complex, have been rejected, acknowledging the existence of child sexuality was a significant change. Children are naturally curious about their bodies and sexual functions ‚Äì they wonder where babies come from, they notice anatomical differences between males and females, and many engage in genital play or masturbation. Child sex play includes exhibiting or inspecting the genitals. Many children take part in some sex play, typically with siblings or friends.Santrock, J.W. (2008). A Topical Approach to Life-Span Development (4thed.). New York: McGraw-Hill. Sex play with others usually decreases as children go through their elementary school years, yet they still may possess romantic interest in their peers. Curiosity levels remain high during these years, escalating in puberty (roughly the teenage years) when the main surge in sexual interest occurs. =Kinsey= Alfred Kinsey in the Kinsey Reports (1948 and 1953) included research on the physical sexual response of children, including pre-pubescent children (though the main focus of the reports was adults). While there were initially concerns that some of the data in his reports could not have been obtained without observation of or participation in child sexual abuse, the data was revealed much later in the 1990s to have been gathered from the diary of a single pedophile who had been molesting children since 1917. This effectively rendered the data-set nearly worthless, not only because it relied entirely on a single source, but the data was hearsay reported by a highly unreliable observer. In 2000, Swedish researcher Ing-Beth Larsson noted, \\"It is quite common for references still to cite Alfred Kinsey\\", due to the scarcity of subsequent large-scale studies of child sexual behavior.Larsson, IngBeth. Child sexuality and sexual behavior (2000), Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (report), Article number 2000-36-001. English translation (Lambert & Tudball) Article number 2001-123-20. Sexual development =Before puberty= The National Child Traumatic Stress Network issued a report in 2009 on child sexual development in the United States. The report asserted that children have a natural curiosity about their own bodies and the bodies of others that ought to be addressed in an age-appropriate manner. According to the report: *Children less than four years old will normally touch their own private parts, look at the private parts of others, and remove their clothes wanting to be naked; *Between ages four and six, children will be more actively curious. They will attempt to see others dressing or undressing, or will perhaps \\"play doctor\\"; and *Between ages six and twelve, children will expand their curiosity to images of undressed people available in the media. They will develop a need for privacy regarding their own bodies and begin to be sexually attracted to peers. The report recommended that parents learn what is normal in regard to nudity and sexuality at each stage of a child's development and refrain from overreacting to their children's nudity-related behaviors unless there are signs of a problem (e.g. anxiety, aggression, or sexual interactions between children not of the same age or stage of development). Children can discover the pleasure of genital stimulation naturally at an early age. Boys often lie on their stomachs and girls may sit and rock. Manual stimulation occurs about the time of adolescence and mutual masturbation or other sexual experimentation between adolescents of similar ages may also occur, though cultural or religious coercion may inhibit or occult such activity if there is negative peer pressure or if authority figures are likely to disapprove. From the ages of three to seven, the following behaviors are normal among children: *Children are curious about where babies come from.GH6002 Sexuality and Your Child: For Children Ages 3 to 7, MU Extension *Children may explore other children's and adults' bodies out of curiosity. *By age four, children may show significant attachment to the opposite-sex parent. *Children begin to have a sense of learned modesty and of the differences between private and public behaviors. *For some children, genital touching increases, especially when they are tired or upset. Early school age covers approximately ages five to seven, and masturbation is common at these ages. Children become more aware of gender differences, and tend to choose same-sex friends and playmates, even disparaging the opposite sex.Sex education: Talking to toddlers and preschoolers about sex - MayoClinic.com Children may drop their close attachment to their opposite-sex parent and become more attached to their same-sex parent. During this time, children, especially girls, show increased awareness of social norms regarding sex, nudity, and privacy.Richardson, Justin, M.D., and Schuster, Mark, M.D., Ph.D. Everything You Never Wanted Your Kids to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid They'd Ask) , 2003, Three Rivers Press Children may use sexual terms to test adult reaction. \\"Bathroom humor\\" (jokes and conversation relating to excretory functions), present in earlier stages, continues.Planned Parenthood - Sexuality Development \\"Middle childhood\\" covers the ages from about six to eleven, depending on the methodology and the behavior being studied, individual development varies considerably. As this stage progresses, the choices of children picking same-sex friends becomes more marked and extending to disparagement of the opposite sex. By the age of 8 or 9 children become aware that sexual arousal is a specific type of erotic sensation and will seek these pleasurable experiences through various sights, self-touches, and fantasy. Although there are variations between individual children, children are generally curious about their bodies and those of others, and explore their bodies through explorative sex play.SEX PLAY: parenting strategies by Dr. Marilyn Heins PPP: Health and Safety  When Children's Play Involves Sexuality  Sex play is normal \\"Playing doctor\\" is one example of such childhood exploration; such games are generally considered to be normal in young children. Child sexuality is considered fundamentally different from adult sexual behavior, which is more goal-driven. Among children, genital penetration and oral-genital contact are very uncommon, and may be perceived as imitations of adult behaviors.Larsson & Svedin, 1999, op. cit.; Larsson & Svedin, publication data unavailable; cited in Larsson, 2000, op. cit. Such behaviors are more common among children who have been sexually abused. A 1997 study based on limited variables found no correlation between early childhood (age 6 and under) peer sexual play and later adjustment. The study notes that its results do not demonstrate conclusively that no such correlation exists. The study also does not address the question of consequences of intense sexual experiences or aggressive or unwanted experiences. =Between puberty and adulthood= Contemporary issues In the latter part of the 20th century, sexual liberation probably arose in the context of a massive cultural explosion in the United States of America following the upheaval of the Second World War, and the vast quantity of audiovisual media distributed worldwide by the new electronic and information technology. Children are apt to gain access and be influenced by material, despite censorship and content-control software. = Sex education = The extent of sex education in public schools varies widely around the world, and within countries such as the United States where course content is determined by individual school districts. A series of sex education videos from Norway, intended for 8‚Äì12 year olds, includes explicit information and images of reproduction, anatomy, and the changes that are normal with the approach of puberty. Rather than diagrams or photos, the videos are shot in a locker room with live nude people of all ages. The presenter, a physician, is relaxed about close examination and touching of relevant body parts, including genitals. While the videos note that the age of consent in Norway is 16, abstinence is not emphasized. As of 2015, however, 37 U.S. states required that sex education curricula include lessons on abstinence and 25 required that a \\"just say no\\" approach be stressed. Studies show that early and complete sex education does not increase the likelihood of becoming sexually active, but leads to better health outcomes overall. = Sexualization of children = Some cultural critics in the Western world have postulated that over recent decades, children have been subject to a premature sexualization, as indicated by a level of sexual knowledge or sexual behavior inappropriate for their age group. The causes of this premature sexualization that have been cited include portrayals in the media of sex and related issues, especially in media aimed at children; the marketing of products with sexual connotations to children, including clothing; the lack of parental oversight and discipline; access to adult culture via the internet; and the lack of comprehensive school sex education programs. For girls and young women in particular, studies have found that sexualization has a negative impact on their \\"self-image and healthy development\\". =Sex abuse= Child sexual abuse is defined as an adult or older adolescent having a sexual relationship with a child. Effects of child sexual abuse include clinical depression, Pdf version. post- traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, propensity to further victimization in adulthood, and physical injury to the child, among other problems. Child sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest, and can result in more serious and long-term psychological trauma, especially in the case of parental incest. Children who have been the victim of child sexual abuse sometimes display overly sexualized behavior,Friedrich et al., 1992, 1993, op. cit.; Kendall-Tackett, K. E., Williams, L., Finkelhor, D. (1993). \\"The impact of sexual abuse on children: A review and synthesis of recent empirical studies\\". Psychological Bulletin, 113:164 ‚Äì 180.; Cosentino, C.

Journal of American Academy Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, 34, 8:1033‚Äì1042.; cited in Larsson, 2000, op. cit.Friedrich et al. (1992), op. cit.; cited in Larsson, 2000, op. cit. which may be defined as expressed behavior that is non-normative for the culture. Typical symptomatic behaviors may include excessive or public masturbation and coercing, manipulating or tricking other children into non- consensual or unwanted sexual activities, also referred to as \\"child-on-child sexual abuse\\". Sexualized behavior is thought to constitute the best indication that a child has been sexually abused. Children who exhibit sexualized behavior may also have other behavioral problems. Other symptoms of child sexual abuse may include manifestations of post-traumatic stress in younger children; fear, aggression, and nightmares in young school-age children; and depression in older children. Among siblings In 1980, a survey of 796 undergraduates, 15 percent of females and 10 percent of males reported some form of sexual experience involving a sibling; most of these fell short of actual intercourse. Approximately one quarter of these experiences were described as abusive or exploitative. A 1989 paper reported the results of a questionnaire with responses from 526 undergraduate college students in which 17 percent of the respondents stated that they had preadolescent sexual experiences with a sibling. Methodological issues Empirical knowledge about child sexual behavior is not usually gathered by direct interviews of children, partly due to ethical consideration. Information about child sexual behavior is gathered by the following methods: *Observing children being treated for problematic behavior, such as use of force in sex play,Gil & Cavanagh Johnson, 1993, op. cit.; Cavanagh Johnson, T., Feldmeth, J.

His books discuss various contemporary subjects and themes, emphasizing philosophy's relevance to everyday life. He published Essays in Love (1993), which went on to sell two million copies. Other bestsellers include How Proust Can Change Your Life (1997), Status Anxiety (2004) and The Architecture of Happiness (2006). He co-founded The School of Life in 2008 and Living Architecture in 2009. In 2015, he was awarded \\"The Fellowship of Schopenhauer\\", an annual writers' award from the Melbourne Writers Festival, for that work. Early life and family De Botton was born in Z√ºrich, the son of Jacqueline (n√©e Burgauer) and Gilbert de Botton, who was born in Alexandria, Egypt, and expelled under Nasser. Gilbert went to live and work in Switzerland, where he co-founded an investment firm, Global Asset Management; his family was estimated to have been worth ¬£234 million in 1999., 1999 Sunday Times Rich List now behind a paywall Alain de Botton's Swiss-born mother was Ashkenazi, and his father was from a Sephardic Jewish family from the town of Boton in Castile and Le√≥n. De Botton's ancestors include Abraham de Boton.\\"Gilbert de Botton\\", The Telegraph, obituaries, 30 August 2000. De Botton's paternal grandmother was Yolande Harmer, a Jewish-Egyptian journalist who spied for Israel and died in Jerusalem. He has one sister, Miel, and they received a secular upbringing. Alain spent the first twelve years of his life in Switzerland where he was brought up speaking French and German. Education De Botton attended the Dragon School where English became his primary language. He was later sent to board and study at Harrow School, a public school in England. He has often described his childhood as that of a shy child living in boarding schools. De Botton read History at University of Cambridge, where he was a member of Gonville and Caius College, graduating with a double starred first. He then completed an MPhil in Philosophy at King's College, London (1991‚Äì1992). He began studying for a PhD in French philosophy at Harvard University,New York, Alain de Botton, Volume 35, New York Magazine Co., 2002, page 90 but gave up this research to write books for the general public. Writing =Fiction= In his first novel, Essays in Love (titled On Love in the U.S.), published in 1993, de Botton deals with the process of falling in and out of love. In 2010, Essays in Love was adapted to film by director Julian Kemp for the romantic comedy My Last Five Girlfriends. De Botton wrote a sequel to Essays in Love, published in 2016, titled The Course of Love. =Non-fiction= In 1997 he published his first non-fiction book, How Proust Can Change Your Life, based on the life and works of Marcel Proust.\\"Author of The Art of Travel talks with Robert Birnbaum\\", identitytheory.com It was a bestseller in both the US and UK.\\"Interview with Alain de Botton\\" , writerspace.com; accessed 26 February 2014. This was followed by The Consolations of Philosophy in 2000. The title of the book is a reference to Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy, in which philosophy appears as an allegorical figure to Boethius to console him in the period leading up to his impending execution. In The Consolations of Philosophy, de Botton attempts to demonstrate how the teachings of philosophers such as Epicurus, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer, Seneca, and Socrates can be applied to modern everyday woes. The book has been both praised and criticized for its therapeutic approach to philosophy. In 2004, he published Status Anxiety. In The Architecture of Happiness\\"AOL interviews Alain de Botton about The Architecture of Happiness\\", lifestyle.aol.ca (2006), he discusses the nature of beauty in architecture and how it is related to the well-being and general contentment of the individual and society. He describes how architecture affects people every day, though people rarely pay particular attention to it. A good portion of the book discusses how human personality traits are reflected in architecture. He defends Modernist architecture, and chastises the pseudo-vernacular architecture of housing, especially in the UK. \\"The best modern architecture,\\" he argues, \\"doesn't hold a mirror up to nature, though it may borrow a pleasing shape or expressive line from nature's copybook. It gives voice to aspirations and suggests possibilities. The question isn't whether you'd actually like to live in a Le Corbusier home, but whether you'd like to be the kind of person who'd like to live in one.\\" In The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work (2009), de Botton produced a survey of ten different jobs, including accountancy, rocket science and biscuit manufacture. The book, a piece of narrative non-fiction, includes two hundred original images and aims to unlock the beauty, interest and occasional horror of the modern world of work. After a negative review of the book by New York Times critic Caleb Crain, de Botton posted a scathing ad hominem attack against Crain. He later apologized for his remarks. In August 2009, de Botton applied to a competition advertised among British literary agents by BAA, the airport management company, for the post of \\"writer-in-residence\\" at Heathrow Airport. The post involved being seated at a desk in Terminal 5, and writing about the comings and goings of passengers over a week. De Botton was duly appointed to the position. The result was the book, A Week at the Airport, published by Profile Books in September 2009. The book features photographs by the documentary photographer Richard Baker, with whom de Botton also worked on The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work.The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work, Page 328 In January 2012, de Botton published Religion for Atheists, about the benefits of religions for those who do not believe in them. De Botton put it: \\"It's clear to me that religions are in the end too complex, interesting and on occasion wise to be abandoned simply to those who believe in them\\".The Philosophers Magazine ISSUE # 57 Page 26 In April 2012, he published How to Think More about Sex, one in a series of six books on topics of emotional life published by his enterprise, The School of Life. In October 2013, he published Art as Therapy, co-written with the Australian-Scottish art historian, John Armstrong. Art as Therapy argues that certain great works of art \\"offer clues on managing the tensions and confusions of everyday life\\".\\"Art as Therapy\\", cooper.edu; accessed 26 February 2014. In February 2014, de Botton published his fourteenth book, a title called \\"The News: A User's Manual\\", a study of the effects of the news on modern mentality, viewed through the prism of 25 news stories, culled from a variety of sources, which de Botton analyses in detail. The book delved with more rigour into de Botton's analyses of the modern media which appeared in Status Anxiety. =Newspapers= De Botton used to write articles for several English newspapers, and from 1998 to 2000, wrote a regular column for The Independent on Sunday. Lecturing, television and radio De Botton travels extensively to lecture.The Architecture of Happiness, Official Website He has given lectures at TED conferences. In July 2011, he spoke in Edinburgh about \\"Atheism 2.0\\", an idea of atheism that also incorporates our human need for connection, ritual and transcendence.Ted.com, TED TalksAlain De Botton: Atheism 2.0 In July 2009, he spoke at Oxford University about the philosophy of failure and success, and questions the assumptions underlying these two judgments.Ted.com, TED TalksAlain de Botton: A kinder, gentler philosophy of success; accessed 26 February 2014. In 2011 he presented a series of talks for the BBC Radio 4 series A Point of View. He has his own production company, Seneca Productions, which makes television documentaries based upon his works.  Reception of his writing  De Botton has written in a variety of formats to mixed response. Positive reviews of his books attest that he has made literature, philosophy and art more accessible to a wider audience. Negative reviews allege that de Botton tends to state the obvious and have characterized some of his books as pompous and lacking focus. In response to a question about whether he felt \\"pulled\\" to be a writer, de Botton responded: > So I think where people tend to end up results from a combination of > encouragement, accident, and lucky break, etc. etc. Like many others, my > career happened like it did because certain doors opened and certain doors > closed.

Based in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Seoul, Istanbul, Tel Aviv, S√£o Paulo, Berlin and Melbourne, The School of Life offers an emotional education focusing in particular on the issues of Work and Relationships. In an interview with Metkere.comMetkere.com de Botton said: > The idea is to challenge traditional universities and reorganise knowledge, > directing it towards life, and away from knowledge for its own sake. In a > modest way, it‚Äôs an institution that is trying to give people what > universities should I think always give them: a sense of direction and > wisdom for their lives with the help of culture. =Living Architecture= In May 2009, de Botton launched a project called \\"Living Architecture\\"‚Äìwhich builds holiday rental houses in the UK using leading contemporary architects. These include Peter Zumthor, MVRDV, JVA, NORD and Michael and Patti Hopkins. The most recent house to be announced is a collaboration between the Turner-prize winning artist Grayson Perry, and the architecture firm FAT. The houses are rented out to the general public. De Botton, the creative director and chairman of Living Architecture, aims to improve the appreciation of good contemporary architecture‚Äìa task which is the practical continuation of his theoretical work on architecture in his book The Architecture of Happiness.

The term \\"flashbulb memory\\" suggests the surprise, indiscriminate illumination, detail, and brevity of a photograph; however flashbulb memories are only somewhat indiscriminate and are far from complete. Evidence has shown that although people are highly confident in their memories, the details of the memories can be forgotten. Flashbulb memories are one type of autobiographical memory. Some researchers believe that there is reason to distinguish flashbulb memories from other types of autobiographical memory because they rely on elements of personal importance, consequentiality, emotion, and surprise. Others believe that ordinary memories can also be accurate and long-lasting if they are highly distinctive, personally significant, or repeatedly rehearsed.Neisser, U. (1982). \\"Snapshots or benchmarks\\", Memory Observed: Remembering in Natural Contexts, ed. 43‚Äì48, San Francisco: Freeman Flashbulb memories have six characteristic features: place, ongoing activity, informant, own effect, other effect, and aftermath. Arguably, the principal determinants of a flashbulb memory are a high level of surprise, a high level of consequentiality, and perhaps emotional arousal.  Historical overview  The term flashbulb memory was coined by Brown and Kulik in 1977. They formed the special-mechanism hypothesis, which argues for the existence of a special biological memory mechanism that, when triggered by an event exceeding critical levels of surprise and consequentiality, creates a permanent record of the details and circumstances surrounding the experience. Brown and Kulik believed that although flashbulb memories are permanent they are not always accessible from long term memory. The hypothesis of a special flashbulb-memory mechanism holds that flashbulb memories have special characteristics that are different from those produced by \\"ordinary\\" memory mechanisms. The representations created by the special mechanism are detailed, accurate, vivid, and resistant to forgetting. Most of these initial properties of flashbulb memory have been debated since Brown and Kulik first coined the term. Ultimately over the years, four models of flashbulb memories have emerged to explain the phenomenon: the photographic model, the comprehensive model, the emotional- integrative model, and importance-driven model; additional studies have been conducted to test the validity of these models.  Positive vs. negative It is possible for both positive and negative events to produce flashbulb memories. When the event is viewed as a positive event, individuals show higher rates of reliving and sensory imagery, also showed having more live- qualities associated with the event. Individuals view these positive events as central to their identities and life stories, resulting in more rehearsal of the event, encoding the memory with more subjective clarity. Compared to positive flashbulb memories, events seen as negative by a person have demonstrated having used more detailed- oriented, conservative processing strategies. Negative flashbulb memories are more highly unpleasant causing a person to avoid reliving the negative event. This avoidance could possibly lead to a reduction of emotional intense memory. The memory stays intact in an individual who experiences a negative flashbulb memory but have a more toned down emotional side. With negative flashbulb memories they are seen to have more consequences. Flashbulb memories can be produced, but do not need to be, from a positive or negative event. Studies have shown that flashbulb memories may be produced by experiencing a type of brand-related interaction. It was found that two brands produced a definitional flashbulb memory, but brands lacking strongly differentiated positioning do not produce a flashbulb memory. These \\"flashbulb brand memories\\" were viewed very much like conventional flashbulb memories for the features of strength, sharpness, vividness, and intensity. Methods Research on flashbulb memories generally shares a common method. Typically, researchers conduct studies immediately following a shocking, public event. Participants are first tested within a few days of the event, answering questions via survey or interview regarding the details and circumstances regarding their personal experience of the event. Then groups of participants are tested at for a second time, for example six months, a year, or 18 months later. Generally, participants are divided into groups, each group being tested at different interval. This method allows researchers to observe the rate of memory decay, the accuracy and the content of flashbulb memories.  Accuracy  Many feel that flashbulb memories are not accurate enough to be considered their own category of memory. One of the issues is that flashbulb memories may deteriorate over time, just like everyday memories. Also, it has been questioned whether flashbulb memories are significantly different from everyday memories. A number of studies suggest that flashbulb memories are not especially accurate, but that they are experienced with great vividness and confidence. In a study conducted on September 12, 2001, 54 Duke students were tested for their memory of hearing the terrorist attack and their recall of a recent everyday event. Then, they were randomly assigned to be tested again either 7,42 or 224 days after the event. The results showed that mean number of consistent inconsistent details recalled did not significantly differ for flashbulb memories and everyday memories, in both cases declining over time. However, ratings of vividness, recollection and belief in accuracy of memory declined only for everyday memories. These findings further support the claims that \\"flashbulb memories are not special in their accuracy but only in their perceived accuracy.‚Äù Many experimenters question the accuracy of Flashbulb Memories, but rehearsal of the event is to blame. Errors that are rehearsed through retelling and reliving can become a part of the memory. Because Flashbulb memories happen only a single time, there are no opportunities for repeated exposure or correction. Errors that are introduced early on are more likely to remain. Many individuals see these events that create Flashbulb memories as very important and want to \\"never forget\\", which may result in overconfidence in the accuracy of the flashbulb memory. The most important thing in creating a flashbulb memory is not what occurs at the exact moment of hearing striking news, rather what occurs after hearing the news. The role of post-encoding factors such as retelling and reliving is important when trying to understand the increase in remembrance after the event has already taken place. Such research focuses on identifying reasons why flashbulb memories are more accurate than everyday memories. It has been documented that importance of an event, the consequences involved, how distinct it is, personal involvement in the event, and proximity increase the accuracy of recall of flashbulb memories. = Stability over time = It has been argued that flashbulb memories are not very stable over time. A study conducted on the recollection of flashbulb memories for the Challenger Space Shuttle disaster sampled two independent groups of subjects on a date close to the disaster, and another eight months later. Very few subjects had flashbulb memories for the disaster after eight months. Considering only the participants who could recall the source of the news, ongoing activity, and place, researchers reported that less than 35% had detailed memories. Another study examining participants' memories for the Challenger Space Shuttle explosion found that although participants were highly confident about their memories for the event, their memories were not very accurate three years after the event had occurred.Neisser, U. & Harsh, N. (1992). \\"Phantom flashbulbs: False recollections of hearing the news about Challenger\\", Affect and Accuracy in Recall: Studies of flashbulb memories, ed. 9‚Äì31, New York: Cambridge University Press A third study conducted on the O.J. Simpson murder case found that although participants' confidence in their memories remained strong, the accuracy of their memories declined 15 months after the event, and continued to decline 32 months after the event. While the accuracy of flashbulb memories may not be stable over time, confidence of the accuracy of a flashbulb memory appears to be stable over time. A study conducted on the bombing in Iraq and a contrasting ordinary event showed no difference for memory accuracy over a year period; however, participants showed greater confidence when remembering the Iraqi bombing than the ordinary event despite no difference in accuracy. Likewise, when memories for the 9/11 World Trade Center attack were contrasted with everyday memories, researchers found that after one year, there was a high, positive correlation between the initial and subsequent recollection of the 9/11 attack. This indicates very good retention, compared to a lower positive correlation for everyday memories. Participants also showed greater confidence in memory at time of retrieval than time of encoding. = Relation to autobiographical memory = Some studies indicate that flashbulb memories are not more accurate than other types of memories. It has been reported that memories of high school graduation or early emotional experiences can be just as vivid and clear as flashbulb memories. Undergraduates recorded their three most vivid autobiographical memories. Nearly all of the memories produced were rated to be of high personal importance, but low national importance. These memories were rated as having the same level of consequentiality and surprise as memories for events of high national importance. This indicates that flashbulb memories may just be a subset of vivid memories and may be the result of a more general phenomenon. When looking at flashbulb memories and \\"control memories\\" (non-flashbulb memories) it has been observed that flashbulb memories are incidentally encoded into one's memory, whereas if one wanted to, a non-flashbulb memory can be specifically encoded in a person's memory. Both of these types of memories have vividness that accompanies the memory but it was found that for flashbulb memories, the vividness was much higher and never decreases compared to control memories, which in fact did decrease over time. Flashbulb memory has always been classified as a type of autobiographical memory, which is memory for one's everyday life events. Emotionally neutral autobiographical events, such as a party or a barbecue, were contrasted with emotionally arousing events that were classified as flashbulb memories. Memory for the neutral autobiographical events was not as accurate as the emotionally arousing events of Princess Diana's death and Mother Teresa's death. Therefore, flashbulb memories were more accurately recalled than everyday autobiographical events. In some cases, consistency of flashbulb memories and everyday memories do not differ, as they both decline over time. Ratings of vividness, recollection and belief in the accuracy of memory, however, have been documented to decline only in everyday memories and not flashbulb memories. The latent structure of a flashbulb memory is taxonic, and qualitatively distinct from non-flashbulb memories. It has been suggested that there are \\"optimal cut points\\" on flashbulb memory features that can ultimately divide people who can produce them from those who cannot. This follows the idea that flashbulb memories are a recollection of \\"event-specific sensory-perceptual details\\" and are much different from other known autobiographical memories. Ordinary memories show a dimensional structure that involves all levels of autobiographical knowledge, whereas flashbulb memories appear to come from a more densely integrated region of autobiographical knowledge. Flashbulb memories and non-flashbulb memories also differ qualitatively and not just quantitatively. Flashbulb memories are considered a form of autobiographical memory but involve the activation of episodic memory, where as everyday memories are a semantic form of recollections. Being a form of autobiographical recollections flashbulb memories are deeply determined by the reconstructive processes of memory, and just like any other form of memory are prone to decay. =Importance of an event= Brown and Kulik emphasized that importance is a critical variable in flashbulb memory formation. In a study conducted by Brown and Kulik, news events were chosen so that some of them would be important to some of their subjects, but not to others. They found that when an event was important to one group, it was associated with a comparatively high incidence of flashbulb memories. The same event, when judged lower on importance by another group, was found to be associated with a lower incidence of flashbulb memory. The retelling or rehearsal of personally important events also increases the accuracy of flashbulb memories. Personally important events tend to be rehearsed more often than non-significant events. A study conducted on flashbulb memories of the Loma Prieta earthquake found that people who discussed and compared their personal stories with others repeatedly had better recall of the event compared to Atlanta subjects who had little reason to talk about how they had heard the news. Therefore, the rehearsal of personally important events can be important in developing accurate flashbulb memories. There has been other evidence that shows that personal importance of an event is a strong predictor of flashbulb memories. A study done on the flashbulb memory of the resignation of the British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, found that the majority of UK subjects had flashbulb memories nearly one year after her resignation. Their memory reports were characterized by spontaneous, accurate, and full recall of event details. In contrast, a low number of non-UK subjects had flashbulb memories one year after her resignation. Memory reports in this group were characterized by forgetting and reconstructive errors. The flashbulb memories for Margaret Thatcher's resignation were, therefore, primarily associated with the level of importance attached to the event. When Princess Diana died, it was a very important and surprising event. It affected people across the globe. When looking at accuracy, the importance of the event can related to how accurate an individual's flashbulb memory is. Reports found that among British participants no forgetting occur over 4 years since the event. Events that are highly surprising and are rated as highly important to an individual may be preserved in the memory for a longer period of time, and have the qualities of recent events compared to those not as affected. If an event has a strong impact on an individual these memories are found to be kept much longer. = Consequentiality = It was proposed that the intensity of initial emotional reaction, rather than perceived consequentiality, is a primary determinant of flashbulb memories. Flashbulb memories of the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan were studied, and it was found that participants had accurate flashbulb memories seven months after the shooting. Respondents reported flashbulb memories, despite low consequentiality ratings. This study only evaluated the consequence of learning about a flashbulb event, and not how the consequences of being involved with the event affects accuracy. Therefore, some people were unsure of the extent of injury, and most could only guess about the eventual outcomes. Two models of flashbulb memory state that the consequences of an event determines the intensity of emotional reactions. The Importance Driven Emotional Reactions Model indicates that personal consequences determine intensity of emotional reactions. The consequence of an event is a critical variable in the formation and maintenance of a flashbulb memory. These propositions were based on flashbulb memories of the Marmara earthquake. The other model of flashbulb memory, called the Emotional- Integrative model, proposes that both personal importance and consequentiality determine the intensity of one's emotional state. Overall, the majority of research found on flashbulb memories demonstrates that consequences of an event play a key role in the accuracy of flashbulb memories. The death of Pope John Paul II did not come as a surprise but flashbulb memories were still found in individuals who were affected. This shows a direct link between emotion and event memory, and emphasizes how attitude can play a key factor in determining importance and consequentiality for an event. Events being high in importance and consequentiality lead to more vivid and long-lasting flashbulb memories. =Distinctiveness of an event = Some experiences are unique and distinctive, while others are familiar, commonplace, or are similar to much that has gone on before. Distinctiveness of an event has been considered to be a main contributor to the accuracy of flashbulb memories.Brewer, W. (1988) \\"Memory for randomly sampled autiobiographical events.\\" In U. Neisser & E. Winograd (Eds.), Remembering reconsidered: Ecological and traditional approaches to the study of memory, 21‚Äì90. New York: Cambridge University Press The accounts of flashbulb memory that have been documented as remarkably accurate have been unique and distinctive from everyday memories. It has been found that uniqueness of an event can be the best overall predictor of how well it will be recalled later on. In a study conducted on randomly sampled personal events, subjects were asked to carry beepers that went off randomly. Whenever the beeper sounded, participants recorded where they were, what they were doing, and what they were thinking. Weeks or months later, the participants' memories were tested. The researchers found that recall of action depends strongly on uniqueness. Similar results have been found in studies regarding distinctiveness and flashbulb memories; memories for events that produced flashbulb memories, specifically various terrorist attacks, had high correlations between distinctiveness and personal importance, novelty, and emotionality. It has also been documented that if someone has a distinctive experience during a meaningful event, then accuracy for recall will increase. During the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, higher accuracy for the recall of the earthquake was documented in participants who had distinctive experiences during the earthquake, often including a substantial disruption in their activity. =Personal involvement and proximity= Santa Cruz's historic Pacific Garden Mall suffered severe damage during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake It has been documented that people that are involved in a flashbulb event have more accurate recollections compared to people that were not involved in the event. Recollections of those who experienced the Marmara earthquake in Turkey had more accurate recollections of the event than people who had no direct experience. In this study, the majority of participants in the victim group recalled more specific details about the earthquake compared to the group that was not directly affected by the earthquake, and rather received their information about it from the news. Another study compared Californians' memories of an earthquake that happened in California to the memories of the same earthquake formed by people who were living in Atlanta. The results indicated that the people that were personally involved with the earthquake had better recall of the event. Californians' recall of the event were much higher than Atlantans', with the exception of those who had relatives in the affected area, such that they reported being more personally involved. The death of Pope John Paul II has created many Flashbulb Memories among people who were more religiously involved with the Catholic Church. The more involved someone is to a religion, city or group, the more importance and consequentially is reported for an event. More emotions are reported, resulting in more consistent Flashbulb Memories. A study (Sharot et al. 2007) conducted on the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks demonstrates that proximity plays a part in the accuracy of recall of flashbulb memories. Three years after the terrorist attacks, participants were asked to retrieve memories of 9/11, as well as memories of personally selected control events from 2001. At the time of the attacks, some participants were in the downtown Manhattan region, closer to the World Trade Center, while others were in Midtown, a few miles away. The participants who were closer to downtown recalled more emotionally significant detailed memories than the Midtown participants. When looking solely at the Manhattan participants, the retrieval of memories for 9/11 were accompanied by an enhancement in recollective experience relative to the retrieval of other memorable life events in only a subset of participants who were, on average, two miles from the World Trade Center (around Washington Square) and not in participants who were, on average, 4.5 miles from the World Trade Center (around the Empire State Building). Although focusing only on participants that were in Manhattan on 9/11, the recollections of those closer to the World Trade Center were more vivid than those who were farther away. The downtown participants reported seeing, hearing, and even smelling what had happened. Personal involvement in, or proximity to, a national event could explain greater accuracy in memories because there could be more significant consequences for the people involved, such as the death of a loved one, which can create more emotional activation in the brain. This emotional activation in the brain has been shown to be involved in the recall of flashbulb memories. = Source of Information = When looking at the source of knowledge about an event, hearing the news from the media or from another person does not cause a difference in reaction, rather causes a difference in the type of information that is encoded to one's memory. When hearing the news from the media, more details about the events itself are better remembered due to the processing of facts while experiencing high levels of arousal, whereas when hearing the news from another individual a person tends to remember personal responses and circumstances. Additionally, the source monitoring problem contributes to the recollection and memory errors of flashbulb memories. Over time, new information is encountered and this post-significant event information from other sources may replace or added to the part of information already stored in memory. Repeated rehearsal of the news in media and between individuals make flashbulb memories more susceptible to misremembering the source of information, thus leading to less recall of true details of the event. In a study done by Dutch researchers, participants were asked about an event of El Al Boeing 747 crash on apartment buildings in Amsterdam. Ten months after the accident, participants were asked if they recalled seeing the television film of the moment the plane hit the building. According to the results, over 60% of the subjects said they had seen the crash on television, although there was no television film regarding the incident. If they said yes, there were asked questions about the details of the crash and most falsely reported that they saw the fire had started immediately. This study demonstrates that adults can falsely believe that they have witnessed something they actually have not seen themselves but only heard from news or other people. Even, they can go further to report specific but incorrect details regarding the event. It is important to note that the error rate in this experiment is higher than usually found in flashbulb experiments since it uses a suggestive question instead of the usual neutral ‚Äòflashbulb memory question‚Äô and unlike in typical flashbulb memory studies, subjects are not asked how they first learned about the event which doesn‚Äôt lead to critical consideration of possible original source. However, it demonstrates how even flashbulb memories are susceptible to memory distortion due to source monitoring errors.  Demographic differences  Although people of all ages experience flashbulb memories, different demographics and ages can influence the strength and quality of a flashbulb memory. = Age differences = In general, younger adults form flashbulb memories more readily than older adults. One study examined age-related differences in flashbulb memories: participants were tested for memory within 14 days of an important event and then retested for memory of the same event 11 months later. Even 11 months after the event occurred, nearly all the younger adults experienced flashbulb memories, but less than half of the older adults met all the criteria of a flashbulb memory. Younger and older adults also showed different reasons for recalling vivid flashbulb memories. The main predictor for creating flashbulb among younger adults was emotional connectedness to the event, whereas older adults relied more on rehearsal of the event in creating flashbulb memories. Being emotionally connected was not enough for older adults to create flashbulbs; they also needed to rehearse the event over the 11 months to remember details. Older adults also had more difficulty remembering the context of the event; the older adults were more likely to forget with whom they spoke and where events took place on a daily basis. If older adults are significantly impacted by the dramatic event, however, they could form flashbulb memories that are just as detailed as those that younger adults form. Older adults that were personally impacted by or close to September 11 recalled memories that did not differ in detail from those of younger adults. Older adults were found to be more confident in their memories than younger adults, in regards to whom they were with, where they were, and their own personal emotions at the time of hearing the news of 9/11. Older adults remembered a vast majority of events between the ages of 10 and 30, a period known as the \\"reminiscence bump\\". During that period, events occur during a time of finding one's identity and peak brain function. These events tend to be more talked about than events occurring outside this period. Flashbulb memories from the \\"reminiscence bump\\" are better remembered by older adults than are memories are having recently occurred. = Cultural variations = Generally the factors that influence flashbulb memories are considered to be constant across cultures. Tinti et al. (2009) conducted a study on memories of Pope John Paul II's death amongst Polish, Italian, and Swiss Catholics. The results showed that personal involvement was most important in memory formation, followed by proximity to the event. Flashbulb memories differ among cultures with the degree to which certain factors influence the vividness of flashbulb memories. For example, Asian cultures de-emphasis individuality; therefore Chinese and Japanese people might not be as affected by the effects of personal involvement on vividness of flashbulb memories. A study conducted by Kulkofsky, Wang, Conway, Hou, Aydin, Johnson, and Williams (2011) investigated the formation of flashbulb memories in 5 countries: China, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Turkey. Overall participants in the United States and the United Kingdom reported more memories in a 5 minutes span than participants from Germany, Turkey, and China. This could simply be due to the fact that different cultures have different memory search strategies. In terms of flashbulb memories, Chinese participants were less affected by all factors related to personal closeness and involvement with the event. There were also cultural variations in effects of emotional intensity and surprise. =Gender= Although not much research has been done on gender and flashbulb memories, one study notes the existence of gender effects on the presence of various factors which contribute to flashbulb memories. Some studies conducted in this area of research yielded findings indicating that women are able to produce more vivid details of events and recall autobiographical events elicited by the hearings than men. One such study had participants fill out questionnaires about flashbulb memories and recollections of autobiographical events pertaining to the Senate hearings that confirmed Clarence Thomas as a Supreme Court Justice (Morse, 1993). The questionnaire contained four sections. The first asked about vivid images associated with the weekend the hearing took place, and the participants were asked to rate the two most vivid images using 7-point bipolar scales. The scale rated for \\"personal importance, unexpectedness of the recalled event, consequentiality of the event, vividness of the memory, and emotional intensity of the recalled event.\\" The second section contained questions on autobiographical events not recently thought of and also used the 7-point scale format. The third section inquired on the number of hours watching or listening to media coverage of the hearing, and the fourth asked about details of the memories that were reported. 94 respondents were surveyed, and of those there were 62 females, 31 males, and one person who did not indicate gender. The study found that half of the individuals reported vivid memory images associated with the hearings. 64% of women reported images as opposed to 33% men. 77% of women reported having had stimulated recall of an autobiographical event, while only 27% of men indicated having experienced such recall. Beyond the two rated memories given in the first section, women were more likely than men to report additional imagery (24% of women and 6% of men). Women were significantly more likely than men to report vivid image memories and recall of autobiographical events elicited by the hearings, but more importantly, they did not differ significantly from men in the ratings of these memories. There was no difference in the average amount of time spent consuming media on the hearing. A large body of research was conducted into events taking place during the terrorist attacks on 9/11, although it was not specifically geared toward finding gender differences. In one study researchers had participants answer questions to establish \\"consistent flashbulb memory,\\" which consists of details about where the participants were at the time of the attacks, what they were doing, etc. In 2002 it was found that 48% of respondents fulfilled these requirements, and of those people 49% were women and 47% were men. They found that in 2003 45% of respondents surveyed met the criteria for having \\"consistent flashbulb memory.\\" Of those 45%, women made up 46% of the group while men made up 44% (Conway, 2009). Women seemed more likely to have a more consistent memory for the event than men in this study. Temporal distance from the incident decreases the memory consistency. On the other hand, in a study aimed at finding whether a series of terrorist attacks with common features elicit flashbulb memories, a different pattern of gender effects was found. Men rated the distinctiveness of their flashbulb-producing event significantly higher than females did. Additionally, men had memories with significantly more detail than women. Women however, reported significantly higher rates of emotional reactivity. Thus, it is important to conduct further research to fully understand the significant differences between men and women in recall of flashbulb memories. Biological reasons for gender variances in flashbulb memory may be explained by amygdala asymmetry. The amygdala is a part of the limbic system, and is linked with memory and emotion. Memory is enhanced by emotion, and studies have shown that people are more likely to remember a negative event than a neutral or positive one. Investigations into the amygdala revealed \\"people who showed strong amygdala activation in response to a set of positive or negative stimuli (relative to other study participants) also showed superior memory for those stimuli (relative to other study participants)\\". This may explain why flashbulb memory typically involves traumatic events. When viewing emotional content, research has shown that men enhance their memory by activating their right amygdala while women activate the left side. The functional asymmetry of amygdala activation between genders is exemplified in experimentation with lesions and brain-damaged patients. One study found using a case-matched lesion approach that a \\"man with right-sided amygdala damage developed major defects in social conduct, emotional processing and personality, and decision making, whereas the man with left- sided amygdala damage did not\\". The reverse effect was found between two women. An experiment was conducted that had 12 men and 12 women view an assortment of images (emotional and nonemotional). Three weeks after the experiment a follow-up study was conducted testing the memory of those individuals, and it was \\"revealed that highly emotional pictures were remembered best, and remembered better by women than by men\\". One study performed an MRI scan on 40 patients after showing them aversive and non- aversive photographs proceeded by a warning stimulus. This experiment found that \\"previously reported sex differences of memory associations with left amygdala for women and with right amygdala for men were confined to the ventral amygdala during picture viewing and delayed memory\\". Although it is still unclear how lateralization affects memory, there may be a more effective relationship between activation of the left amygdala and memory than activation of right and memory. Generally speaking, studies testing differences between genders on episodic memory tasks revealed that \\"women consistently outperform men on tasks that require remembering items that are verbal in nature or can be verbally labeled\\" (Herlitz, 2008). In addition, it seems that \\"women also excel on tasks requiring little or no verbal processing, such as recognition of unfamiliar odors or faces\\" (Herlitz, 2008). Men only seem to excel in memory tasks that require visuospatial processing. Gender differences are also very apparent in literature pertaining to autobiographical memory research. \\"Compared to men, women¬¥s recall is more accurate and, when not specifically prompted, their narratives are longer than men¬¥s\\" (Aizpura, 2010). To sum up these gender differences, most literature on memory indicates that: \\"Women use a greater quantity and variety of emotion words than men when describing their past experiences (Adams, Kuebli, Boyle, & Fivush, 1995; Bauer et al., 2003; Fivush et al., 2003; Hess et al., 2000). Women include not only a greater number of references to their own emotional states but also a greater number of references to the emotional states of others. In addition, when asked to recall emotional life experiences, women recall more memories of both positive and negative personal experiences than men\\" (Bloise, 2007). Overall women seem to have better memory performance than men in both emotional and non-emotional events (Bloise, 2007). There are many problems with assaying gender differences found in the research into this topic. Most apparent is that it is heavily reliant on self-reporting of events. Inaccuracy of findings could result from bias questions or misremembering on the part of the participants. There is no way to completely verify the accuracy of accounts given by the subjects in a study. Additionally there are many indications that eye-witness memory can often be fallible. Emotion does not seem to improve memory performance in a situation that involves weapons. One study found that eyewitnesses remembered details about perpetrators less clearly when a weapon was involved in the event (Pickel, 2009). Accuracy in these situations is compromised by a phenomenon known as the weapon focus effect. Further complicating matters is the time frame in which people are surveyed in relation to the event. Many studies fall victim to surveying people well after the events have transpired. Thus, there is a validity issue with much of the research into flashbulb memory in general, as well as any apparent gender differences found therein.  Improvement  A number of studies have found that flashbulb memories are formed immediately after a life changing event happens or when news of the event is relayed. Although additional information about the event can then be researched or learned, the extra information is often lost in memory due to different encoding processes. A more recent study, examining effects of the media on flashbulb memories for the September 11, 2001 attacks, shows that extra information may help retain vivid flashbulb memories. Although the researchers found that memory for the event decreased over time for all participants, looking at images had a profound effect on participants memory. Those who said they saw images of the September 11th attacks immediately retained much more vivid images 6-months later than those who said they saw images hours after they heard about the attacks. The latter participants failed to encode the images with the original learning of the event. Thus, it may be the images themselves that lead some of the participants to recall more details of the event. Graphic images may make an individual associate more with the horror and scale of a tragic event and hence produce a more elaborate encoding mechanism. Furthermore, perhaps looking at images may help individuals retain vivid flashbulb memories months, and perhaps even years, after an event occurs.  Controversy: special mechanism hypothesis  The special-mechanism hypothesis has been the subject of considerable discussion in recent years, with some authors endorsing the hypothesis and others noting potential problems.This hypothesis divides memory processes into different categories, positing that different mechanisms underlie flashbulb memories. Yet many argue that flashbulb memories are simply the product of multiple, unique factors coalescing. =Supporting evidence= Data concerning people's recollections of the Reagan assassination attempt provide support for the special-mechanism hypothesis. People had highly accurate accounts of the event and had lost very few details regarding the event several months after it occurred. Additionally, an experiment examining emotional state and word valence found that people are better able to remember irrelevant information when they are in a negative, shocked state. There is also neurological evidence in support of a special mechanism view. Emotionally neutral autobiographical events, such as a party, were compared with two emotionally arousing events: Princess Diana's death, and Mother Teresa's death. Long-term memory for the contextual details of an emotionally neutral autobiographical event was significantly related to medial temporal lobe function and correlated with frontal lobe function, whereas there was no hint of an effect of either medial temporal lobe or frontal lobe function on memory for the two flashbulb events. These results indicate that there might be a special neurobiological mechanism associated with emotionally arousing flashbulb memories. =Opposing evidence= Studies have shown that flashbulb memories can result from non- surprising events, such as the first moon landing, and also from non- consequential events. While Brown and Kulik defined flashbulb memories as memories of first learning about a shocking event, they expand their discussion to include personal events in which the memory is of the event itself. Simply asking participants to retrieve vivid, autobiographical memories has been shown to produce memories that contain the six features of flashbulb memories. Therefore, it has been proposed that such memories be viewed as products of ordinary memory mechanisms. Moreover, flashbulb memories have been shown to be susceptible to errors in reconstructive processes, specifically systematic bias. It has been suggested that flashbulb memories are not especially resistant to forgetting.Neisser, U. & Harsch, N. (1992) in Affect and Accuracy in Recall: Studies of \\"Flashbulb\\" Memories, eds Winograd, E., Neisser, U (Cambridge University Press, New York), pp 9‚Äì32. A number of studies suggest that flashbulb memories are not especially accurate, but that they are experienced with great vividness and confidence. Therefore, it is argued that it may be more precise to define flashbulb memories as extremely vivid autobiographical memories. Although they are often memories of learning about a shocking public event, they are not limited to such events, and not all memories of learning about shocking public events produce flashbulb memories.Larsen, S. F. (1992). \\"Affect and Accuracy in Recall: Studies of Flashbulb Memories\\", eds Winograd, E., Neisser, U. 43‚Äì48, Cambridge University Press, New York  Models  =The photographic model= Brown and Kulik proposed the term flashbulb memory, along with the first model of the process involved in developing what they called flashbulb accounts. The photographic model proposes that in order for a flashbulb account to occur in the presence of a stimulus event, there must be, a high level of surprise, consequentiality, and emotional arousal. Specifically, at the time in which an individual first hears of an event, the degree of unexpectedness and surprise is the first step in the registration of the event. The next step involved in registration of flashbulb accounts is the degree of consequentiality, which in turn, triggers a certain level of emotional arousal. Brown and Kulik described consequentiality as the things one would imagine may have gone differently if the event hadn't occurred, or what consequences the event had on an individual's life. Furthermore, Brown and Kulik believed that high levels of these variables would also result in frequent rehearsal, being either covert (\\"always on the mind\\") or overt (ex. talked about in conversations with others). Rehearsal, which acts as a mediating process in the development of a flashbulb account, creates stronger associations and more elaborate accounts. Therefore, the flashbulb memory becomes more accessible and vividly remembered for a long period of time. =Comprehensive model= Some researchers recognized that previous studies of flashbulb memories are limited by the reliance on small sample groups of few nationalities, thus limiting the comparison of memory consistency across different variables. The comprehensive model was born out of similar experimentation as Brown and Kulik's, but with a larger participant sample. One major difference between the two models is that the Photographic Model follows more of a step-by-step process in the development of flashbulb accounts, whereas the Comprehensive Model demonstrates an interconnected relationship between the variables. Specifically, knowledge and interest in the event affects the level of personal importance for the individual, which also affects the individual's level of emotional arousal (affect). Furthermore, knowledge and interest pertaining to the event, as well as the level of importance, contribute to the frequency of rehearsal. Therefore, high levels of knowledge and interest contribute to high levels of personal importance and affect, as well as high frequency of rehearsal. Finally, affect and rehearsal play major roles in creating associations, thus enabling the individual to remember vivid attributes of the event, such as the people, place, and description of the situation. =Emotional-integrative model= An Emotional-Integrative Model of flashbulb memories integrates the two previously discussed models the Photographic Model and the Comprehensive Model. Similar to the Photographic Model, the Emotional-Integrative Model states that the first step toward the registration of a flashbulb memory is an individual's degree of surprise associated with the event. This level of surprise triggers an emotional feeling state, which is also a result of the combination of the level of importance (consequentiality) of the event to the individual, and the individual's affective attitude. The emotional feeling state of the individual directly contributes to the creation of a flashbulb memory. To strengthen the association, thus enabling the individual to vividly remember the event, emotional feeling state and affective attitude contribute to overt rehearsal (mediator) of the event to strengthen the memory of the original event which, in turn, determines the formation of a flashbulb memory. According to the Emotional-Integrative model flashbulb memories can also be formed for expected events. The formation of flashbulb memories in this case depends greatly on a high emotional relationship to the event and rehearsal of the memory. = Importance-driven emotional reactions model= This model emphasizes that personal consequences determine intensity of emotional reactions. These consequences are, therefore, critical operators in the formation and maintenance of flashbulb memories. This model was based on whether traumatic events were experienced or not during the Marmara earthquake. According to the findings of this study, the memories of the people who experienced the earthquake were preserved as a whole, and unchanged over time. Results of the re-test showed that the long-term memories of the victim group are more complete, more durable and more consistent than those of the comparison group. Therefore, based on this study, a new model was formed that highlights that consequences play a very large role in the formation of flashbulb memories. =Compared to traumatic memories= As discussed previously, flashbulb memories are engendered by highly emotional, surprising events. Flashbulb memories are different from traumatic events because they do not generally contain emotional response.Traumatic memories involve some element of fear or anxiety. While flashbulb memories can include components of negative emotion, these elements are generally absent. There are some similarities between traumatic and flashbulb memories. During a traumatic event, high arousal can increase attention to central information leading to increased vividness and detail. Another similar characteristic is that memory for traumatic events is enhanced by emotional stimuli. An additional, a difference between the nature of flashbulb memories and traumatic memories is the amount of information regarding unimportant details that will be encoded in the memory of the event. In high-stress situations, arousal dampens memory for peripheral information‚Äîsuch as context, location, time, or other less important details. To rephrase, flashbulb memories are described as acute awareness of where a person was and what they were doing when a significant or traumatic event occurred, and are not characterized by strong emotion, while traumatic memories are accompanied by highly negative emotions such as anxiety, fear, and panic when the related event is recalled.  Neurological bases  = Amygdala = Amygdala highlighted in red Laboratory studies have related specific neural systems to the influence of emotion on memory. Cross-species investigations have shown that emotional arousal causes neurohormonal changes, which engage the amygdala. The amygdala modulates the encoding, storage, and retrieval of episodic memory. These memories are later retrieved with an enhanced recollective experience, similar to the recollection of flashbulb memories. The amygdala, therefore, may be important in the encoding and retrieval of memories for emotional public events. Since the role of the amygdala in memory is associated with increased arousal induced by the emotional event, factors that influence arousal should also influence the nature of these memories. The constancy of flashbulb memories over time varies based on the individual factors related to the arousal response, such as emotional engagement and personal involvement with the shocking event. The strength of amygdala activation at retrieval has been shown to correlate with an enhanced recollective experience for emotional scenes, even when accuracy is not enhanced. Memory storage is increased by endocrine responses to shocking events; the more shocking an individual finds an event, the more likely a vivd flashbulb memory will develop. There has been considerable debate as to whether unique mechanisms are involved in the formation of flashbulb memories, or whether ordinary memory processes are sufficient to account for memories of shocking public events. Sharot et al. found that for individuals who were close to the World Trade Center, the retrieval of 9/11 memories engaged neural systems that are uniquely tied to the influence of emotion on memory. The engagement of these emotional memory circuits is consistent with the unique limbic mechanism that Brown and Kulik suggested. These are the same neural mechanisms, however, engaged during the retrieval of emotional stimuli in the laboratory. The consistency in the pattern of neural responses during the retrieval of emotional scenes presented in the laboratory and flashbulb memories suggests that even though different mechanisms may be involved in flashbulb memories, these mechanisms are not unique to the surprising and consequential nature of the initiating events. Evidence indicates the importance of the amygdala in the retrieval of 9/11 events, but only among individuals who personally experienced these events. The amygdala's influence on episodic memory is explicitly tied to physiological arousal. Although simply hearing about shocking public events may result in arousal, the strength of this response likely varies depending on the individual's personal experience with the events. Critique of research Flashbulb memory research tends to focus on public events that have a negative valence. There is a shortage on studies regarding personal events such as accidents or trauma. This is due to the nature of the variables needed for flashbulb memory research: the experience of a surprising event is hard to manipulate. Also, it is very hard to conduct experiments on flashbulb memories due to lack of control over the events. In an empirical study, it is very difficult to control the rehearsal amount. Some researchers also argue that the effect of rehearsal factors on individual memory is different with respect to the availability of the mass media across different societies.

The International Exhibition of 1862, or Great London Exposition, was a world's fair. It was held from 1 May to 1 November 1862, beside the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society, South Kensington, London, England, on a site that now houses museums including the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. Organisation The exposition was sponsored by the Royal Society of Arts, Manufactures and Trade, and featured over 28,000 exhibitors from 36 countries, representing a wide range of industry, technology, and the arts. William Sterndale Bennett composed music for the opening ceremony. All told, it attracted about 6.1 million visitors. Receipts (¬£459,632) were slightly above cost (¬£458,842), leaving a total profit of ¬£790. It was held in South Kensington, London, on a site now occupied by the Natural History Museum. The buildings, which occupied 21 acres, were designed by Captain Francis Fowke of the Royal Engineers, and built by Charles and Thomas Lucas and Sir John Kelk at a cost of ¬£300,000 covered by profits from the Great Exhibition of 1851. They were intended to be permanent, and were constructed in an un-ornamented style with the intention of adding decoration in later years as funds allowed. Much of the construction was of cast-iron, 12,000 tons worth, though fa√ßades were brick. Picture galleries occupied three sides of a rectangle on the south side of the site; the largest, with a frontage on the Cromwell Road was 1150 feet long, 50 feet high and 50 feet wide, with a grand triple-arched entrance. Fowke paid particular attention to lighting pictures in a way that would eliminate glare. Behind the picture galleries were the \\"Industrial Buildings\\" . These were composed of \\"naves\\" and \\"transepts\\", lit by tall clerestories, with the spaces in the angles between them filled by glass-roofed courts. Above the brick entrances on the east and west fronts were two great glass domes, each 150 feet wide and 260 feet high - at that time the largest domes ever built. The timber-framed \\"Machinery Galleries\\", the only parts of the structure intended to be temporary, stretched further north along Prince Consort Road.Some Account of the Buildings Designed by Captain Francis Fowke, for the International Exhibition of 1862. Chapman and Hall, London, 1861. The opening took place on 1 May 1862. Queen Victoria, still in mourning for her consort Prince Albert did not attend, instead her cousin the Duke of Cambridge presided from a throne sited beneath the western dome. An opening address was delivered by the Earl Granville, chairman of Her Majesty's Commissioners, the group responsible for the organisation of the event.The Exhibition Building of 1862, in Survey of London: Volume 38, South Kensington Museums Area, ed. F H W Sheppard (London, 1975), pp. 137-147 , accessed 15 February 2016 An official closing ceremony took place on 1 November 1862, but the exhibition remained open to the public until 15 November 1862. Over six million people attended. Parliament declined the Government's wish to purchase the building and the materials were sold and used for the construction of Alexandra Palace. Exhibitions Babbage's Analytical EngineThe exhibition was a showcase of the advances made in the industrial revolution , especially in the decade since the first Great Exhibition of 1851. Among the items on display were; the electric telegraph, submarine cables, the first plastic, Parkesine , machine tools, looms and precision instruments.London Stereoscopic Company Exhibits included such large pieces of machinery as parts of Charles Babbage's analytical engine, cotton mills, and maritime engines made by the firms of Henry Maudslay and Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes. There was also a range of smaller goods including fabrics, rugs, sculptures, furniture, plates, porcelain, silver and glass wares, and wallpaper. The manufacture of ice by an early refrigerator caused a sensation. The work shown by William Morris's decorative arts firm of Morris, Marshall, Faulkner & Co. attracted much notice. The exposition also introduced the use of caoutchouc for rubber production and the Bessemer process for steel manufacture. Benjamin Simpson showed photos from the Indian subcontinent. Lady of the Lake class locomotive No. 531 exhibited at the exhibition, which proved a great attraction. William England led a team of stereoscopic photographers, which included William Russell Sedgfield and Stephen Thompson, to produce a series of 350 stereo views of the exhibition for the London Stereoscopic Company. The images were made using the new collodion wet plate process which allowed exposure times of only a few seconds. These images provide a vivid three-dimensional record of the exhibition. They were on sale to the public in boxed sets and were delivered to the Queen by messenger so that she could experience the exhibition from her seclusion in mourning. The London and North Western Railway exhibited one of their express passenger locomotives, No. 531 Lady of the Lake. A sister locomotive, No. 229 Watt had famously carried Trent Affair despatches earlier that year, but the Lady of the Lake (which won a bronze medal at the exhibition) was so popular that the entire class of locomotive became known as Ladies of the Lake. There was an extensive art gallery designed to allow an even light without reflection on the pictures. The exhibition also included an international chess tournament, the London 1862 chess tournament.  Music  Unlike The Great Exhibition of 1851, the Society of Arts chose to have a distinctive musical component to the exhibition of 1862. Music critic Henry Chorley was selected as advisor and recommended commissioning works by William Sterndale Bennett, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Daniel Auber, and Gioacchino Rossini. Being in his retirement, Rossini declined, so the Society asked Giuseppe Verdi, who eventually accepted.Verdi, Giuseppe. Hymns = Inni. Robert Montemorra Marvin, ed., The Works of Giuseppe Verdi, series 4, volume 1, Chicago and Milan: University of Chicago and Ricordi, 2007. William Sterndale Bennett wrote his Ode Written Expressly for the Opening of the International Exhibition (upon a text by Alfred, Lord Tennyson), Meyerbeer wrote his Fest-Ouvert√ºre im Marschstyl, and Auber wrote his Grand triumphal march. These three works premiered at the opening of the exhibition on 1 May 1862, with the orchestra led by conductor Prosper Sainton. Controversies involving Verdi's contribution, the cantata Inno delle nazioni, prevented the work from being included in the inaugural concert. It was first performed on 24 May 1862 at Her Majesty's Theatre in a concert organized by James Henry Mapleson. At another concert, the French pianist and composer Georges Pfeiffer created his Second Piano Concerto.Antonio Baldassarre: \\"Pfeiffer, Georges Jean\\", in: Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart (MGG), biographical part, vol. 13 (Kassel: B√§renreiter, 2005), c. 462. The pianist Ernst Pauer performed daily piano recitals on the stage under the western dome. Accident At the opening of the exhibition on 1 May 1862, one of the attending Members of the British Parliament, 70-year-old Robert Aglionby Slaney, fell onto the ground through a gap between floorboards on a platform. He carried on with his visit despite an injured leg, but died from gangrene that set in on the 19th.Slaney was MP for Shrewsbury.

He was a professor of Creative Writing at York University, and a writer of short fiction. In 2010, he was named an Officer of the Order of Canada.  Early life and education  Blaise was born in Fargo, North Dakota to Canadian parents who lived in the United States. His mother, Anne Marion Vanstone, was English-Canadian and from Wawanesa, Manitoba, and his father, Leo Romeo Blaise, was of French-Canadian descent and was a furniture salesman and long- distance traveller. Later on, his father would inspire the father characters in Blaise's fiction. Growing up, his family moved constantly throughout the U.S. Before the eighth grade, he had already moved 30 times; ultimately, he attended 25 different schools. From ages six to ten, he lived in Florida. Throughout his childhood, Blaise also lived in Alabama, Georgia, communities in the American Midwest, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, and Winnipeg. When Blaise was nineteen, his parents divorced. He attended Denison University and the University of Iowa, graduating in 1961 and 1964 respectively. While at Denison University, he initially intended to pursue a major in geology but switched to English after taking a writing course in which he studied under Paul Bennett. While studying at Denison, he read extensively, began writing book reviews for the weekly newspaper, helped edit campus literary magazines, and received several campus writing awards.  Career  In 1966, Blaise moved to Montreal and obtained Canadian citizenship. While living in Canada, Blaise published his first two short fiction collections, A North American Education (1973)\\"The Meagre Tarmac: Stories, by Clark Blaise\\". The Globe and Mail, STEVEN HAYWARD, June 17, 2011 and Tribal Justice (1974). Blaise was the director of the International Writing Program. While living in Montreal in the early 1970s, he taught creative writing at Concordia University; he also joined with authors Raymond Fraser, Hugh Hood, John Metcalf and Ray Smith to form the Montreal Story Tellers Fiction Performance Group. Blaise and Mukherjee collaborated on a memoir of experiences in India which was published in 1978. In 1978, Blaise and Mukherjee moved to Toronto. Blaise became a professor of Creative Writing at York University, and wrote his first novel. Mukherjee felt excluded in Canada, attributing it to racism and publishing an essay in Saturday Night. In 1980, the couple decided to return to the United States, moving to San Francisco. Both continued their literary careers, including a collaborative analysis of the 1985 bombing of Air India flight 182, known in India as the Kanishka bombing. Blaise wrote two more novels and a number of short stories.  Personal life  He married writer Bharati Mukherjee in 1963.\\"Award-Winning Author Bharati Mukherjee Dead at 76\\".

Where it is asserted that some list of integers is finite, the question is whether in principle the list could be printed out after a machine computation. Littlewood's result An early example of an ineffective result was J. E. Littlewood's theorem of 1914, that in the prime number theorem the differences of both œà(x) and œÄ(x) with their asymptotic estimates change sign infinitely often. See p. 9 of the preprint version. In 1933 Stanley Skewes obtained an effective upper bound for the first sign change, now known as Skewes' number. In more detail, writing for a numerical sequence f(n), an effective result about its changing sign infinitely often would be a theorem including, for every value of N, a value M > N such that f(N) and f(M) have different signs, and such that M could be computed with specified resources. In practical terms, M would be computed by taking values of n from N onwards, and the question is 'how far must you go?' A special case is to find the first sign change. The interest of the question was that the numerical evidence known showed no change of sign: Littlewood's result guaranteed that this evidence was just a small number effect, but 'small' here included values of n up to a billion. The requirement of computability reflects on and contrasts with the approach used in analytic number theory to prove the results. It for example brings into question any use of Landau notation and its implied constants: are assertions pure existence theorems for such constants, or can one recover a version in which 1000 (say) takes the place of the implied constant? In other words if it were known that there was M > N with a change of sign and such that :M = O(G(N)) for some explicit function G, say built up from powers, logarithms and exponentials, that means only :M < A.G(N) for some absolute constant A. The value of A, the so-called implied constant, may also need to be made explicit, for computational purposes. One reason Landau notation was a popular introduction is that it hides exactly what A is. In some indirect forms of proof it may not be at all obvious that the implied constant can be made explicit. The 'Siegel period' Many of the principal results of analytic number theory that were proved in the period 1900‚Äì1950 were in fact ineffective. The main examples were: *The Thue‚ÄìSiegel‚ÄìRoth theorem *Siegel's theorem on integral points, from 1929 *The 1934 theorem of Hans Heilbronn and Edward Linfoot on the class number 1 problem. *The 1935 result on the Siegel zero* ‚Äì comments on the ineffectiveness of the bound. * The Siegel‚ÄìWalfisz theorem based on the Siegel zero. The concrete information that was left theoretically incomplete included lower bounds for class numbers (ideal class groups for some families of number fields grow); and bounds for the best rational approximations to algebraic numbers in terms of denominators. These latter could be read quite directly as results on Diophantine equations, after the work of Axel Thue. The result used for Liouville numbers in the proof is effective in the way it applies the mean value theorem: but improvements (to what is now the Thue‚ÄìSiegel‚ÄìRoth theorem) were not. Later work Later results, particularly of Alan Baker, changed the position. Qualitatively speaking, Baker's theorems look weaker, but they have explicit constants and can actually be applied, in conjunction with machine computation, to prove that lists of solutions (suspected to be complete) are actually the entire solution set. Theoretical issues The difficulties here were met by radically different proof techniques, taking much more care about proofs by contradiction. The logic involved is closer to proof theory than to that of computability theory and computable functions. It is rather loosely conjectured that the difficulties may lie in the realm of computational complexity theory. Ineffective results are still being proved in the shape A or B, where we have no way of telling which.

Areola, more generally, is a small circular area on the body with a different histology from the surrounding tissue, or other small circular areas such as an inflamed region of skin. The mature human female nipple has several small openings arranged radially around the tip of the nipple (lactiferous ducts) from which milk is released during lactation. Other small openings in the areola are sebaceous glands, known as Montgomery's glands. Color The difference between coloring of areolae. The areolae can range from pink to red to chocolate brown to dark brown or nearly black, but generally tend to be paler among people with lighter skin tones and darker among people with darker skin tones. A reason for the differing color may be to make the nipple area more visible to the infant. Size and shape Large areolae on a woman. Adult women have areolae of an average of 38.1 mm (1.5 in), but sizes range up to 100 mm (4 in) or greater. The size and shape of areolae and nipples are also highly variable, with those of women usually being larger than those of men and prepubescent girls. Human areolae are mostly circular in shape, but many women have large areolae that are noticeably elliptical. The average diameter of male areolae is around . Sexually mature women have an average of , but sizes can exceed . Lactating women, and women with particularly large breasts, may have even larger areolae. A function of the specialized dermis of the areola is to protect the regular breast skin from wear, cracking, and irritation. Infants sometimes create trauma to the nipple and areolae by latching-on. Another function of an areola is to house slowly-adapting mechanoreceptors that trigger oxytocin excretion during nursing. The size of the areola implies a need to protect a larger area than the nipple due to many factors that are not fully known. Rated according to the Tanner scale of physical development, in stage four, the areolae are raised. In stage five, they are no longer raised. Mechanoreceptors Breastfeeding by the baby innervates slowly adapting and rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors that are densely packed around the areolar region.

Characteristically between 20' to 35' in length, runabouts are used for pleasure activities like boating, fishing, and water skiing, as a ship's tender for larger vessels, or in racing. Some common runabout types are bow rider, center console, cuddy boat and walkaround.  History  The first runabouts date back to the 1920s and were originally small, fast, powerful, varnished, wooden boats created to take advantage of the power of outboard motors such as the first Evinrude, introduced in 1909. In order to gain speed, the hull shape had to be designed to take advantage of hydroplaning; a hydrofoil-like design would allow the boat to skim atop the water's surface at high speed instead of needing to push aside large quantities of water to move forward. Another design change which followed soon after was the replacement of the tiller and rudder control with a rudder controlled by a steering wheel, allowing the operator a comfortable forward-facing position. A remote lever to allow the engines to be placed into a reverse gear was another early innovation. Among the leading builders of 1920s runabouts was John L. Hacker, who founded the Hacker Boat Company in 1908. Hacker was a pioneering naval architect who developed many design innovations, like the 'V-bottom'. His designs became the model upon which virtually all subsequent runabouts were based. Shortly, similar upscale varnished-wood runabouts by Gar Wood and Chris-Craft and were also available, fitted with windshields to protect the cockpits and up to Liberty V-12 marinized surplus World War I aero engines built for speed. But by the late 1940s, Gar Wood had stopped producing boats, and by the 1960s Chris-Craft was moving to the more modern materials of plastic and fiberglass. Hackercraft, with multiple changes in ownership, continued on. The mahogany runabouts built by Italian builder Carlo Riva in the late 1950s and the 1960s are considered by many to be premier European examples of the type. The most famous Riva of all time was the Carlo Riva design called the Aquarama Special.  Construction and materials  Originally, runabouts were made entirely of wood, with mahogany used for hulls and planking and oak for framing. The use of aluminium in small boat construction came soon after World War II because of availability of aircraft materials as war surplus. Fiberglass was then introduced as another way to reduce the maintenance, cost and weight of watercraft. Given the cost benefits and personal enjoyment of boat building, do-it-yourself ‚Ä≤Kit Boats‚Ä≤ were also introduced using plywood material. In 1955, Chris-Craft created The Plywood Boat Division which marketed both Kit and pre-built plywood craft.Savage, J., (2002), Chris-Craft of the 1950s, St. Paul: MBI Publishing. By 1960, wooden powerboats had become rare since most new vessels used fiberglass or other lightweight materials, including fiber reinforced plastic materials to reduce weight and maximize speed, particularly in racing craft. The art of boat- building in wood has been largely lost since it requires a level of craftsmanship impossible in large scale production boat building. One exception is the Hacker Boat Company, which continues to produce mahogany boats on the shores of Lake George, New York. Other wooden boat-builders include Graf, J-Craft, and Boesch.  Propulsion  Runabouts can be powered by inboard engines, outboards, jet drives, or inboard-outboard (I/O) drives. Engines can be gasoline or diesel systems. Inboards have the engine block permanently mounted within the hull of the boat, with a drive shaft and a propeller to drive the craft underneath the hull, and a separate rudder to steer the craft. Outboards are steerable external drive motors containing the engine block, linkage gears, and propeller within a single unit, taking the place of a rudder. Outboard drives are mounted to the transom and steered by a remote system leading to a wheel mounted on the boat's console. Inboard- Outboard (or stern drives) are a hybrid, with an engine block mounted within the hull linked to a pivotable lower drive unit which steers the craft, similar to an outboard motor. Jet Drives have a propeller enclosed in a pump- jet that draws water from underneath the hull and expels it through a swiveling nozzle in the stern. They are highly maneuverable and tolerant of shallow water, but need larger engines and use more fuel than the other alternatives.

Their current model, the Caterham 7 (or Seven), originally launched in 1973, is a direct evolution of the Series 3 Lotus Seven designed by Colin Chapman. In the 1990s the company made the Caterham 21, a two-seater soft top alternative to the MGF and Lotus Elise, (which both sold many more units). A track-only car, the SP/300.R, a joint project with Lola was released for customer testing in 2010 and was scheduled for release in 2013. On 27 April 2011, Team Lotus owner Tony Fernandes announced that he had purchased Caterham.  History  = Lotus origins = Colin Chapman's Lotus Cars launched the Series 1 Lotus Seven in 1957. The car was immediately embraced by enthusiasts as a low-cost, lightweight sports car and successful race car. Revised Series 2, Series 3 and Series 4 versions were subsequently launched in 1960, 1968 and 1970 respectively. Caterham Cars had been a major Lotus 7 dealer during the 1960s, and its founder, Graham Nearn, purchased the rights to continue manufacture of the Seven design from Chapman in 1973, after Lotus announced its intention to discontinue the model. Caterham initially restarted manufacture of the Lotus Seven Series 4; however, when this proved unpopular, production switched to a Series 3 model in 1974. In 1974, under the name of Seven Cars Limited, Caterham built 20 production cars with chassis numbers 1‚Äì20 and one prototype, with chassis number 0 (CS3 3550 ‚Äì CS3 3570). Of the 21 cars produced in the first year, all were fitted with the Ford Lotus Twin Cam 1557cc engine, with the exception of chassis number 7 which, intended for racing, was fitted with a 1962cc twin cam engine sourced from Alfa Romeo. The Lotus/Caterham 7 is widely regarded by car enthusiasts and the media as one of the signature sports cars of the 20th century. With 2007 marking the 50th year of continuous production, the Seven still enjoys strong support and success in clubman-style racing. Since 2006 Caterham Cars has been run by an ex-Lotus management team led by Ansar Ali (CEO) and Mark Edwards (COO). In June 2012 Ansar Ali announced he was to leave Caterham Cars and Graham Mcdonald (the company's former CFO) became the new CEO. = Construction = As with its Lotus Seven precursors, Caterhams are constructed of aluminium sheet attached to a tubular steel chassis. Nose cone and wings are either GRP or carbon fibre depending on specification. All Sevens are front-engined with rear-wheel drive and two seats. Their extremely high performance is achieved through light weight (less than on some versions) rather than particularly powerful engines. As well as a lightweight chassis and bodywork, Caterham Sevens achieve their very low mass through their lack of comfort and safety oriented features such as a fixed roof, doors, radio, air-conditioning, airbags, traction/stability control, ABS, satellite navigation or cruise control. As a result, the Seven is somewhat limited in its practicality for everyday usage and is instead recognised by driving enthusiasts for its focus on driving enjoyment, making it an ideal track/race car or 'Sunday' car. = Kit format = Chapman and Lotus helped to pioneer the British kit car industry. The Lotus Seven was offered in kit form to allow buyers to avoid new car tax in the UK. Subsequently, Caterham continued offering cars in 'complete knock down' (CKD) kit form as the tradition of hand building your own Seven was well established amongst enthusiasts. Today, all Caterham Sevens are still offered in kit form in the UK except the CSR (Series 6) model. Modern Caterham kits differ from the majority of kit cars as all parts are supplied ready to assemble, not requiring a donor car, fabrication or any special skills. = International = Caterham 7 Roadsport near Caterham South showroom Although the Seven has always been popular with enthusiasts outside of the UK marketplace, export of the Seven to other markets has increasingly been limited by homologation, safety and emissions regulations in the modern era. As a result, the chassis/engine combinations, specifications, pricing and kit-form availability vary widely between countries. In the past in the United States Caterhams were sold as kits only, lacking some modern safety features required of manufacturers, but which are not required for individually assembled vehicles. Buyers could either choose to construct the cars themselves or pay their regional dealers or local builders to assemble them. Typically the engine and transmission are sourced separately as a unit ‚Äì often from Caterham ‚Äì but all other components (including frame, suspension, differential, driveshaft, interior, wiring and instruments) were provided in kit form. In the UK, the vehicles can be obtained as kits or entirely assembled by Caterham and registered for the road under IVA (Individual Vehicle Approval) regulations. In the '60s, the original Lotus Seven was sold only in kit form in both the UK and the US, in order to evade the very high taxes on complete new cars that were not assessed on automobile parts.  United States  As of 2014, however, Caterham has named Superformance their official distributor in the United States. International demand has increased dramatically in part due to the addition of a F1 Race team and the changes in Caterham's structure focusing on the distribution of the Seven worldwide. Caterham has since introduced a new model line up and focused on their production and production times to better suit their new international market, making their partnership with Superformance possible. Sevens will be shipped to the US in part-built form and sold as rolling chassis via Superformance's nationwide dealer network for customers to then complete the build personally or through the Superformance dealership. The initial US line-up includes several Caterham Sevens: 280, 360, 480, and the 620R. = Location = Until 1987 the offices, factory and showroom of Caterham Cars were located in the town of Caterham, Surrey. In 1987, the production and administration of the company moved to a new factory in Dartford, Kent. Caterham Cars retained a Caterham South showroom and servicing facility in the town of Caterham adjacent to the railway station until February 2013. The Caterham dealership closed after the premises were sold for development and the showroom relocated to temporary facilities in Crawley. Additionally the Caterham Midlands showroom operates outside Leicester. In 2012 elements of Caterham Cars moved into a new facility in Leafield, Oxfordshire, where it is expected the new models of cars to be produced in the future will be developed and built. This new facility was formerly used by the Arrows F1 team and the Super Aguri F1 team. The Leafield site also accommodated the Caterham F1 team, which moved from its original base in Hingham, Norfolk and competed in Formula One between the 2012 and 2014 seasons. = Caterham 21 = Caterham 21 In 1994 Caterham also produced a model called the '21'. Mechanically the 21 was very similar to the 7, using a modified 7 spaceframe chassis with a new GRP roadster-style body, including a wrap-around windscreen and fold-away fabric hood (convertible top) manufactured by Oxted Trimming Company. The 21 benefited from a considerably stiffer setup than a 7, due to the work on the chassis and having a full body. Comfort was introduced in the same minimalist style as the 7, adding just enough to make it a proper roadster without adding too much weight. Caterham, however, underestimated the effort involved in creating a completely new car and took far too long from its inception to deliver the first customer cars, seeing many people who had placed deposits defect to the Lotus Elise and other vehicles. Early ones were used as \\"prototypes\\", leaving customers to help iron out some of the foibles of the new car. The 21 never sold particularly well, with only 48 ever made. It had moderate racing success in the Belcar 24-hour series in Europe and is credited with helping Caterham develop the widetrack setup used in SVs (amongst other developments) and the CSR's sweeping interior is reminiscent of the original 21 design. = Caterham SP/300.R = The SP/300.R is a new track-only model designed by Caterham alongside Lola Cars. The SP/300.R is a limited edition with limited production to 25 per annum.telegraaf.nl, Caterham Lola SP/300.R heeft prijs (in Dutch)  Caterham 7 model line-up  Classic Caterham = Chassis variants = In 2010 Caterham offers three different chassis variants in the UK.  Series 3 (S3)  The most popular variant retains the same dimensions and layout of the Lotus 7 Series 3.  Series 5 (SV)  Caterham introduced this variant in 2000 to accommodate larger drivers (space is restricted in the S3 for drivers over tall.) Although visually very similar to the S3, the SV is longer, taller and wider and has significantly more space for taller and broader drivers with the added benefits of more luggage space, a larger fuel tank and more stability. The SV chassis is heavier than the S3.  CSR (Series 6)  The CSR was launched in 2005 following extensive research and development by Caterham with the objective of creating an improved Seven. The CSR is based on the larger dimensions of the SV but with a substantially revised and stiffer chassis, inboard 'pushrod' front suspensions, fully independent rear suspension, improved aerodynamics, potent Cosworth engines and a new 'integrated' dashboard layout. = Model/trim variants =  Classic  The most basic version of the 7 was traditionally offered with a 'live' rear axle but now comes with De Dion tube rear suspension found in other models of the same range. This trim level strips away all non-essential equipment and comforts. * Classic trim is available on S3/SV chassis * Engines: 1.4-litre K-Series (105 bhp) or 1.6-litre K-Series (120 bhp).  Roadsport  Roadsport is the trim level intended for general usage, different weather conditions and touring. The spec includes a full windscreen and weather equipment to increase practicality. A large range of performance options are available. The Roadsport dates back to 1996 when it was called the Superlight R, in 1998 a much softer version came out called the Seven Clubsport 1.8. The range continued to be developed in the years as a great alternative to someone who wanted a little bit more than a Classic, but less than a Superlight. * Classic trim is available on S3/SV chassis * Engines: 1.6-litre Ford Sigma (120,125 or 150 bhp) or 2.0-litre Ford Duratec (175 bhp). = Roadsport A = Roadsport A cars are ex-Academy cars, with no engine upgrades. However a number of performance upgrades such removing the windscreens and lights, widetrack front suspension and uprated dampers are allowed, as is professional team support. RSA races at the same events as RSB, but has longer 30-minute races. = Roadsport B = Roadsport B is largely for drivers that have come through the previous season's Academy. Some minor modifications are permitted to the car, including fitting a rear anti-roll bar and sticky Avon CR500 tyres. Technical support is still provided by the factory, and professional team support is not permitted. RSB has 20-minute races at 7 or 8 'double-header' meetings over the course of the season, usually all in the UK. Caterham 7 Superlight R300  Superlight  The Superlight is intended for track and fast road usage. Superlight spec includes performance options such as carbon bodywork and a close ratio 6-speed gearbox. A wind deflector in place of the windscreen makes a helmet more or less mandatory. The Superlight R400 uses a 2.0 litre Ford Duratec engine tuned to . The R400 name indicates the car's 400 bhp-per-tonne power-to-weight ratio. * Superlight trim is available on S3/SV chassis * Engines: 1.6-litre Ford Sigma (150 bhp) or 2.0-litre Ford Duratec (175 bhp, 210 bhp or 263 bhp). = Superlight R300 = The Superlight R300 was introduced for 2009, designed to bridge the gap between RSA and the existing Superlight R400 class. It is expected to be popular with experienced RSA racers wanting to move on to the next level in speed. = Superlight R400 = The Superlight R400 series is Caterham Motorsport's premier British championship. The R400 is a 220 bhp Cosworth powered dedicated race car with a Quaife six-speed sequential gearbox replacing the standard Caterham unit used in the R300. As with all series above Academy, it runs on Avon CR500 tyres. 2009 Champion Dan Denis, Matt Blyth Racing = Superlight R500 = The Superlight R500 series is the latest of Caterham Motorsport's Superlight series of RSA Racing cars. Powered by a 2.0-litre Ford Duratec engine producing maximum horsepower (bhp/rpm) of 263 bhp @ 8500rpm and maximum torque (lb.ft/rpm) of 177 lb.ft @ 7200rpm. With a weight of 506 kg (516 kg) and a sequential gearbox, it is capable of 0‚Äì60 mph in 2.88 seconds and a staggering power-to-weight ratio of 520 bhp-per- tonne. Advertised top speed 150 mph. The R500 has been made Top Gear car of the year 2008. In another appearance earlier in the series, it placed fifth on the Power Lap board with a 1:17.9. This time beat the ‚Ç¨1,100,000 (¬£899,000/$1,550,000), 1001 hp Bugatti Veyron. = Superlight R600 = In October 2012 a supercharged model for a race-series above the R300-class was released, including slick tyres and a sequential gearbox. = Superlight 620R = In September 2013 Caterham made a car called the 620R. It was based on the R500, but was supercharged. This increased the power output to at 7,700 rpm and the torque to at 7,350 rpm. It also reduced the 0‚Äì time to 2.79 seconds. It has a power-weight ratio of 568 bhp-per-tonne and a top speed of 155 mph.  CSR  The CSR chassis comes in two basic trims which mirror those of the S3/SV cars. The 'basic' CSR has a road and touring oriented spec with full windscreen and weather equipment. This is available as the CSR200 (200 bhp) or CSR260 (260 bhp). The CSR Superlight (also 260 bhp) is the current Caterham performance flagship strips away the windscreen, integrated dash and other comfort-oriented components for maximum performance, with specialist 'Dynamic dampers' added to improve its already phenomenal grip. The 'basic' CSR set an unofficial time of 1.17.4 on the BBC Top Gear test track at Dunsfold, placing it ahead of many of the world's most expensive performance cars. * Engines: 2.3-litre Ford Duratec tuned by Cosworth (200 bhp or 260 bhp)  RS Performance RST-V8 engine  The 'Caterham Levante', built by RS Performance Engine Developments Ltd. (RS=Russell Savory), is a mostly-carbon- fibre bodied Caterham, with Kevlar seats, combined with an \\"over 500bhp\\" 2.4-litre, 40-valve supercharged V8 and a reduced body weight of , boasts almost per tonne (initial announced specifications were and , but the RS website specifies \\"in excess of 500bhp,\\" and or ; the math may or may not achieve \\"over per tonne\\"). The eight cars, costing ¬£115,000, sold out and only eight will be produced to celebrate more than 50 years in production. Two days' of mandatory \\"driver training\\" are included in the price of the car. = Kit build = All of the 2008 model line-up is available as a 'CKD' complete kit for build by the owner, with the exception of CSR models.  Engines  JPE Historically, engines have been supplied by Ford, specifically Ford Kent engines or Cosworth-derived race-prepared BDA/R units, enlarged to 1.7 litres and generating 150‚Äì170 bhp. In the early '90s, Caterham started using powerplants from other sources, with the least expensive models using 1.4-litre K series engines from MG Rover for the base model, and Vauxhall engines including full race versions of the 16 valve 2.0XE \\"red top\\" as fitted to 1990 Vauxhall Works Touring Cars. Rover engines span a power output of 110‚Äì250 bhp in the R500 Evolution, Vauxhall engines to in some factory built versions of the car. A Caterham JPE (Jonathan Palmer Evolution) briefly held the world record for production car 0‚Äì60 mph times (at 3.4 seconds) until it was bettered by the $1M McLaren F1. The many aftermarket tuning companies for these cars have also offered the Ford Zetec, Honda Fireblade, Honda Blackbird, Suzuki Hayabusa and even the Mazda Rotary engine. Since 2017, several cars have been built with the direct injection turbo Ford Ecoboost 1.6.litre version of this engine which with a hybrid turbo provides more horsepower than Caterham's own supercharged Duratec, and more torque than any factory car including the V8 Levante. In 2001, Caterham designated MG Rover the sole engine supplier for factory-built Sevens, with Ford Zetec, Honda Fireblade, Yamaha R1 and Suzuki Hayabusa engines still available for kit assembly. The Rover engines were based on the K series and carried the 'Xpower' branding. However, the partnership evidently came to an end with the collapse of MG Rover, with the 2005 model introducing a Ford Duratec engine. Typical powerplant output ranges from to over , depending on specifications and modifications. The gearbox is either the classic Ford T9 five-speed or Caterham's own six-speed box. The T9 is cheap and durable, but has gear ratios meant for a much heavier car. The six-speed gearbox is expensive and had early 'teething' problems, but its ratios are considered the perfect match for the Seven. Independent companies such as Quaife do offer replacement gearkits for the T9 as well as sequential boxes for those with a racing fever and the need for a more robust transmission. The most extreme engine/chassis combination available from the factory as of 2008 was the R500 with the Ford engine, bringing the car's from zero to in 2.88 seconds. The previous model also held a production car world record for zero to back to zero at 10.73 seconds (faster than many modern family saloons can reach 60), set on 27 April 2004.https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/atom/autocars-record-breaking-0-100-0  Motor racing  = Formula One = For the 2012 season, Team Lotus was officially renamed Caterham F1 Team. The team continued to compete under this name in the 2013 and 2014 seasons, before financial problems caused it to fold. = GP2 Series = Between 2012 and 2014, Caterham raced in the GP2 series, under the guise Caterham Racing, which was rebranded from the Caterham Air Asia team that raced in the 2011 season. The team raced under the same Green and Yellow livery as the Formula 1 team. Caterham Racing was used by the company to act as a feeder team towards developing racing drivers for the Caterham F1 Team, until the company had to cease operations in both series. Initially based in Hingham, the team had moved to the Leafield Technical Centre alongside the Caterham F1 team in August 2012, where they remained until both teams were terminated in 2014.  Caterham Motorsport Ladder  The Caterham Motorsport Ladder is a progression through the various Caterham Cars championships, starting with the Caterham Academy, and moving through ultimately to their most prestigious European events. The championships which form the ladder are:  Caterham Academy  Caterham Academy Cars In 1995 the Caterham Academy, a novices-only format, was introduced in the UK as the Caterham Scholarship. For a starting price of ¬£24,995 (2017), entrants get a modified Roadsport kit (a factory-built option is available for extra cost) with a sealed Ford Sigma engine and 5-speed gearbox. Having completed the ARDS (racing) licence qualification, the season then consists of a car-control day, a test day, and the season starts with two sprints, and five circuit races. Since 2000, the popularity of the Academy has led to Caterham providing two parallel Academy championships (Group 1 & Group 2), each resulting in an Academy champion at the end of the year. Approximately 1000 racing drivers have been created through the Caterham Academy.  Karting  At the Autosport International 2012 Caterham announced that it would be creating a karting series starting in 2013. It was stated that the aim of this karting series was to make it easier for people to enter motorsports by providing a cheap karting series in which they could start off.

She was a leader in the fields of anesthesiology and teratology, and introduced obstetrical considerations to the established field of neonatology.  Early life and education  The youngest of three children, Apgar was born and raised in Westfield, New Jersey, the daughter of Helen May (Clarke) and Charles Emory Apgar. Her father was a business executive and amateur astronomer whose amateur radio work exposed an enspionage ring during World War I. Her older brother died early from tuberculosis, and her other brother had a chronic illness. She graduated from Westfield High School in 1925, knowing that she wanted to be a doctor. Apgar graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1929, where she studied zoology with minors in physiology and chemistry. In 1933, she graduated fourth in her class from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (P&S;) and completed a residency in surgery at P&S; in 1937. She was discouraged by Allen Whipple, the chairman of surgery at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, from continuing her career as a surgeon because he had seen many women attempt to be successful surgeons and ultimately fail. He instead encouraged her to practice anesthesiology because he felt that advancements in anesthesia were needed to further advance surgery and felt that she had the \\"energy and ability\\" to make a significant contribution. Deciding to continue her career in anesthesiology, she trained for six months under Ralph Waters at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, where he had established the first anesthesiology department in the United States. In a 1937 photograph of Waters and his residents, she is the only woman among Waters and fifteen other men. She then studied for a further six months under Ernest Rovenstine in New York at Bellevue Hospital. She received a certification as an anesthesiologist in 1937, and returned to P&S; in 1938 as director of the newly formed division of anesthesia. She later received a master's degree in public health at Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, graduating in 1959.  Work and research  Apgar was the first woman to head a specialty division at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center (now NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital) and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. In conjunction with Allen Whipple, she started P&S;'s anesthesia division. She was placed in charge of the division's administrative duties and was also tasked with co- ordinating the staffing of the division and its work throughout the hospital. Throughout much of the 1940s, she was an administrator, teacher, recruiter, coordinator and practicing physician. newborn baby in 1966alt=Dr. Virginia Apgar, standing, facing right, examining baby with stethoscope. It was often difficult to find residents for the program, as anesthesiology had only recently been converted from a nursing specialty to a physician specialty. New anesthesiologists also faced scrutiny from other physicians, specifically surgeons, who were not used to having an anesthesia-specialized in the operating room. These difficulties led to issues in gaining funding and support for the division. With America's entrance into World War II in 1941, many medical professionals enlisted in the military to help the war effort, which created a serious staffing problem for domestic hospitals, Apgar's division included. When the war ended in 1945, interest in anesthesiology was renewed in returning physicians, and the staffing problem for Apgar's division was quickly resolved. The specialty's growing popularity and Apgar's development of its residency program prompted P&S; to establish it as an official department in 1949. Due to her lack of research, Apgar was not made the head of the department as was expected and the job was given to her colleague, Emmanuel Papper. Apgar was given a faculty position at P&S.; = Obstetrics = In 1949, Apgar became the first woman to become a full professor at P&S;,MHC Connections : Women in Medicine at Mount Holyoke where she remained until 1959. During this time, she also did clinical and research work at the affiliated Sloane Hospital for Women, still a division of NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital.Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology In 1953, she introduced the first test, called the Apgar score, to assess the health of newborn babies. Between the 1930s and the 1950s, the United States infant mortality rate decreased, but the number of infant deaths within the first 24 hours after birth remained constant. Apgar noticed this trend and began to investigate methods for decreasing the infant mortality rate specifically within the first 24 hours of the infant's life. As an obstetric anesthesiologist, Apgar was able to document trends that could distinguish healthy infants from infants in trouble. This investigation led to a standardized scoring system used to assess a newborn's health after birth, with the result referred to as the newborn's \\"Apgar score\\". Each newborn is given a score of 0, 1 or 2 (a score of 2 meaning the newborn is in optimal condition, 0 being in distress) in each of the following categories: heart rate, respiration, color, muscle tone and reflex irritability. Compiled scores for each newborn can range between 0 and 10, with 10 being the best possible condition for a newborn. The scores were to be given to a newborn one minute after birth, and additional scores could be given in five-minute increments to guide treatment if the newborn's condition did not sufficiently improve. By the 1960s, many hospitals in the United States were using the Apgar score consistently. In the 21st century, the score continues to be used to provide an accepted and convenient method for reporting the status of the newborn infant immediately after birth . In 1959, Apgar left Columbia and earned a Master of Public Health degree from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. From 1959 until her death in 1974, Apgar worked for the March of Dimes Foundation, serving as vice president for medical affairs and directing its research program to prevent and treat birth defects. As gestational age is directly related to an infant's Apgar Score, Apgar was one of the first at the March of Dimes to bring attention to the problem of premature birth, now one of the March of Dimes' top priorities. During this time, she wrote and lectured extensively, writing articles in popular magazines as well as research work. In 1967, Apgar became vice president and director of basic research at The National Foundation-March of Dimes. During the rubella pandemic of 1964‚Äì65, Apgar became an advocate for universal vaccination to prevent mother-to-child transmission of rubella. Rubella can cause serious congenital disorders if a woman becomes infected while pregnant. Between 1964 and 1965, the United States had an estimated 12.5 million rubella cases, which led to 11,000 miscarriages or therapeutic abortions and 20,000 cases of congenital rubella syndrome. These led to 2,100 deaths in infancy, 12,000 cases of deafness, 3,580 cases of blindness due to cataracts and/or microphthalmia and 1,800 cases of intellectual disability. In New York City alone, congenital rubella affected 1% of all babies born at that time. Apgar also promoted effective use of Rh testing, which can identify women who are at risk for transmission of maternal antibodies across the placenta where they may subsequently bind with and destroy fetal red blood cells, resulting in fetal hydrops or even miscarriage. Apgar traveled thousands of miles each year to speak to widely varied audiences about the importance of early detection of birth defects and the need for more research in this area. She proved an excellent ambassador for the National Foundation, and the annual income of that organization more than doubled during her tenure there. She also served the National Foundation as Director of Basic Medical Research (1967‚Äì1968) and Vice-President for Medical Affairs (1971‚Äì1974). Her concerns for the welfare of children and families were combined with her talent for teaching in the 1972 book Is My Baby All Right?, written with Joan Beck. Apgar was also a lecturer (1965‚Äì1971) and then clinical professor (1971‚Äì1974) of pediatrics at Cornell University School of Medicine, where she taught teratology (the study of birth defects). She was the first to hold a faculty position in this new area of pediatrics. In 1973, she was appointed a lecturer in medical genetics at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. Apgar published over sixty scientific articles and numerous shorter essays for newspapers and magazines during her career, along with her book, Is My Baby All Right?. She received many awards, including honorary doctorates from the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania (1964) and Mount Holyoke College (1965), the Elizabeth Blackwell Award from the American Medical Women's Association (1966), the Distinguished Service Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (1966), the Alumni Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement from Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (1973) and the Ralph M. Waters Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (1973). In 1973 she was also elected Woman of the Year in Science by the Ladies Home Journal. Apgar was equally at home speaking to teens as she was to the movers and shakers of society. She spoke at March of Dimes Youth Conferences about teen pregnancy and congenital disorders at a time when these topics were considered taboo.  Personal life  Throughout her career, Apgar maintained that \\"women are liberated from the time they leave the womb\\" and that being female had not imposed significant limitations on her medical career. She avoided women's organizations and causes, for the most part. Though she sometimes privately expressed her frustration with sex inequalities (especially in the matter of salaries), she worked around these by consistently pushing into new fields where there was room to exercise her considerable energy and abilities. Music was an integral part of family life, with frequent family music sessions. Apgar played the violin and her brother played piano and organ. She traveled with her violin, often playing in amateur chamber quartets wherever she happened to be. During the 1950s, a friend introduced her to instrument-making, and together they made two violins, a viola and a cello. She was an enthusiastic gardener and enjoyed fly-fishing, golfing and stamp collecting. In her fifties, Apgar started taking flying lessons, stating that her goal was to someday fly under New York's George Washington Bridge. = Death = Apgar never married or had children, and died of cirrhosis on August 7, 1974, at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She is buried at Fairview Cemetery in Westfield.  Legacy  Apgar has continued to earn posthumous recognition for her contributions and achievements. In 1994, she was honored by the United States Postal Service with a 20¬¢ Great Americans series postage stamp. In November 1995, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York. In 1999, she was designated a Women's History Month Honoree by the National Women's History Project. On June 7, 2018, Google celebrated Apgar's 109th birthday with a Google Doodle. \\\\-  Honors and awards  * Honorary doctorate, Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania (1964) * Honorary doctorate, Mount Holyoke College (1965) * Distinguished Service Award from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (1966) * Elizabeth Blackwell Award, from the American Women's Medical Association (1966) * Honorary doctorate, New Jersey College of Medicine and Dentistry (1967) * Alumni Gold Medal for Distinguished Achievement, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons (1973) * Ralph M.

Queue of visitors to the Sultan Ahmed Mosque Queue areas are places in which people queue (first-come, first-served) for goods or services. Such a group of people is known as a queue (British usage) or line (American usage), and the people are said to be waiting or standing in a queue or in line, respectively. (In the New York City area, the phrase on line is often used in place of in line.)LearnersDictionary.com Occasionally, both the British and American terms are combined to form the term \\"queue line\\".

QueueingAlso spelled queuing. askoxford.com. Retrieved 2009-4-29. is a phenomenon in a number of fields, and has been extensively analysed in the study of queueing theory. In economics, queueing is seen as one way to ration scarce goods and services. Types =Physical= History The first written description of people standing in line is found in an 1837 book, The French Revolution: A History by Thomas Carlyle. Carlyle described what he thought was a strange sight: people standing in an orderly line to buy bread from bakers around Paris. Typical applications A queue of people waiting for a Michael Jackson concert in West Germany (1988). People queueing for watermelons in East Berlin, 1977. Queues can be found in railway stations to book tickets, at bus stops for boarding and at temples as well. Queues are generally found at transportation terminals where security screenings are conducted. Large stores and supermarkets may have dozens of separate queues, but this can cause frustration, as different lines tend to be handled at different speeds; some people are served quickly, while others may wait for longer periods of time. Sometimes two people who are together split up and each waits in a different line; once it is determined which line is faster, the one in the slower line joins the other. Another arrangement is for everyone to wait in a single line; a person leaves the line each time a service point opens up. This is a common setup in banks and post offices. Organized queue areas are commonly found at amusement parks. The rides have a fixed number of guests that can be served at any given time, so there has to be some control over additional guests who are waiting. This led to the development of formalized queue areas‚Äîareas in which the lines of people waiting to board the rides are organized by railings, and may be given shelter from the elements with a roof over their heads, inside a climate-controlled building or with fans and misting devices. In some amusement parks ‚Äì Disney Parks being a prime example ‚Äì queue areas can be elaborately decorated, with holding areas fostering anticipation, thus shortening the perceived wait for people in the queue by giving them something interesting to look at as they wait, or the perception that they have arrived at the threshold of the attraction. Design A queue outside a food market in Warsaw, People's Republic of Poland When designing queues, planners attempt to make the wait as pleasant and as simple as possible. They employ several strategies to achieve this, including: * Expanding the capacity of the queue, thus allowing more patrons to have a place. This can be achieved by: **Increasing the length of the queue by making the queue longer **Increasing the size of the lanes within the queue **Increasing the length of the queue by designing the line in a \\"zig-zag\\" shape that holds a large number of guests in a smaller area. This is used often at amusement parks. Notable rides have a large area of this kind of line to hold as many people as possible in line. Portions of the line can be sectioned off and bypassed by guests if the queue is not crowded. * \\"In-line\\" entertainment can be added. This is popular at amusement parks like Walt Disney World, which uses TV screens and other visuals to keep people in the queue area occupied. * Secondary queue areas for patrons with special tickets, like the FASTPASS system used at Disney parks, or the Q-bot as used in Legoland Windsor. Psychology People queuing in the front of ATM in 318x318px People experience \\"occupied\\" time as shorter than \\"unoccupied\\" time, and generally overestimate the amount of time waited by around 36%. The technique of giving people an activity to distract them from a wait has been used to reduce complaints of delays at: * Baggage claim in the Houston, Texas airport, by moving the arrival gates further away so passengers spend more time walking than standing around waiting * Elevators, by adding mirrors so people can groom themselves or watch other people * Retail checkout, by placing small items for purchase so customers can continue shopping while waiting Other techniques to reduce queueing anxiety include: * Hiding the length of a line by wrapping it around a corner. * Having only one line, so there is no anxiety about which line to choose and a greater sense of fairness. Even though the average wait over time is the same, customers tend to notice lines that are moving faster than they are compared to other lines moving more slowly. * Putting up signs that deliberately overestimate the wait time, to always exceed customer expectations. Cutting in line, also known as queue-jumping, can generate a strong negative response, depending on the local cultural norms. = Virtual = Waiting queue call system in the Prague main post office. People have number tickets from the machine and are waiting until their number with a number of the counter appears at the red displays. Waiting number ticket from the main post office of Prague 5 district, Czech Republic. The tickets contains a specification \\"Letter services ‚Äì mass submits\\" and counters No. 8 and 9 which can deal with such a requirement. People lined up when boarding a suburban bus in Prague. Physical queueing is sometimes replaced by virtual queueing. In a waiting room there may be a system whereby the queuer asks and remembers where his place is in the queue, or reports to a desk and signs in, or takes a ticket with a number from a machine. These queues typically are found at doctors' offices, hospitals, town halls, social security offices, labor exchanges, the Department of Motor Vehicles, the immigration departments, free internet access in the state or council libraries, banks or post offices and call centres. Especially in the United Kingdom, tickets are taken to form a virtual queue at delicatessens and children's shoe shops. In some countries such as Sweden, virtual queues are also common in shops and railway stations. A display sometimes shows the number that was last called for service. Restaurants have come to employ virtual queueing techniques with the availability of application-specific pagers, which alert those waiting that they should report to the host to be seated. Another option used at restaurants is to assign customers a confirmed return time, basically a reservation issued on arrival. Virtual queueing apps are available that allow the customers to view the virtual queue status of a business and they can take virtual queue numbers remotely. The app can be used to get updates of the virtual queue status that the customer is in.  Alternate activities  A substitute or alternative activity may be provided for people to participate in while waiting to be called, which reduces the perceived waiting time and the probability that the customer will abort their visit. For example, a busy restaurant might seat waiting customers a bar. An outdoor attraction with long virtual queues might have a side marquee selling merchandise or food. The alternate activity may provide the organisation with an opportunity to generate additional revenue from the waiting customers.Supalocal, \\"Master the art of substitution\\", April 12, 2011, accessed July 11, 2011. = Mobile = All of the above methods, however, suffer from the same drawback: the person arrives at the location only to find out that they need to wait. Recently, queues at DMVs,DMV‚Äôs New Line Management System is Available Online . colleges, restaurants, healthcare institutions, government offices and elsewhere have begun to be replaced by mobile queues or queue-ahead, whereby the person queuing uses his/her phone, the internet, a kiosk or another method to enter a virtual queue, optionally prior to arrival, is free to roam during the wait, and then gets paged at his/her mobile phone when his/her turn approaches.

MLDs are based on the premise that language-learners should progress from a bilingual dictionary to a monolingual one as they become more proficient in their target language, but that general-purpose dictionaries (aimed at native speakers) are inappropriate for their needs. Dictionaries for learners include information on grammar, usage, common errors, collocation, and pragmatics, which is largely missing from standard dictionaries, because native speakers tend to know these aspects of language intuitively. And while the definitions in standard dictionaries are often written in difficult language, those in an MLD use a simple and accessible defining vocabulary. History of English language MLDs The first English MLD, published in 1935, was the New Method English Dictionary by Michael West and James Endicott, a small dictionary using a restricted defining vocabulary of just 1490 words. Since the end of World War Two, global sales of the MLD have run into the tens of millions, reflecting the boom in the English language teaching industry. Probably the best-known English monolingual dictionary for advanced learners is the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary, now in its ninth edition. It was originally published in Japan in 1942 as The Idiomatic and Syntactic Dictionary of English, written by A. S. Hornby and two collaborators. It was subsequently republished as A Learner's Dictionary of Current English in 1948, before acquiring its current name. Other publishers gradually entered the market. The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English was published in 1978, and its most striking feature was the use of a restricted defining vocabulary, which is now a standard feature of learners' dictionaries. There are currently six major MLDs for advanced learners. In addition to the Oxford and Longman dictionaries, these are: *Collins Cobuild English Dictionary, first published in 1987 *Cambridge International Dictionary of English, 1995, now published as the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary *Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners, 2002 *Merriam-Webster's Advanced Learner's English Dictionary, 2008 All of these dictionaries are available in hard copy and online. Since the 1980s, the English MLD has, arguably, been the most innovative area in the field of lexicography, in terms of both the way dictionaries are written and the aspects of language which dictionaries describe, in particular the use of software in combination with text corpora to: *generate language description - a radical innovation which was introduced by the COBUILD project in the 1980sSinclair, J.M.

Ridley was burned at the stake as one of the Oxford Martyrs during the Marian Persecutions for his teachings and his support of Lady Jane Grey. He is remembered with a commemoration in the calendar of saints in some parts of the Anglican Communion on 16 October. Early years and advancement (c.1500‚Äì50) Ridley came from a prominent family in Tynedale, Northumberland. He was the second son of Christopher Ridley, first cousin to Lancelot Ridley and grew up in Unthank Hall from the old House of Unthank located on the site of an ancient watch tower or pele tower. As a boy, Ridley was educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, and Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he proceeded to Master of Arts in 1525.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Index Number 101023631 Soon afterward he was ordained as a priest and went to the Sorbonne, in Paris, for further education. After returning to England around 1529, he became the senior proctor of Cambridge University in 1534. Around that time there was significant debate about the Pope's supremacy. Ridley was well versed on Biblical hermeneutics, and through his arguments the university came up with the following resolution: \\"That the Bishop of Rome had no more authority and jurisdiction derived to him from God, in this kingdom of England, than any other foreign bishop.\\" He graduated B.D. in 1537 and was then appointed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, to serve as one of his chaplains. In April 1538, Cranmer made him vicar of Herne, in Kent.Testamenta Vetusta, by Nicholas Harris Nicolas, esq, page 686; the will of Elizabeth Lady Fineux, of Herne, Kent; written 1539;\\"to Master Nicholas Rydley, vicar of Herne, ....\\" In 1540-1, he was made one of the King's Chaplains, and was also presented with a prebendal stall in Canterbury Cathedral. In 1540 he was made Master of Pembroke College and in 1541 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity.Alumni Cantabrigienses: A Biographical List of all Known Students . . Vol 1. Cambridge: University Press In 1543 he was accused of heresy, but he was able to beat the charge. Cranmer had resolved to support the English Reformation by gradually replacing the old guard in his ecclesiastical province with men who followed the new thinking.; Ridley was made the Bishop of Rochester in 1547, and shortly after coming to office, directed that the altars in the churches of his diocese should be removed, and tables put in their place to celebrate the Lord's Supper. In 1548 he helped Cranmer compile the Book of Common Prayer and in 1549 he was one of the commissioners who investigated Bishops Stephen Gardiner and Edmund Bonner. He concurred that they should be removed. John Ponet took Ridley‚Äôs former position. Incumbent conservatives were uprooted and replaced with reformers. When Ridley was appointed to the see of London by letters patent on 1 April 1550, he was called the \\"Bishop of London and Westminster\\" because the Diocese of London had just re-absorbed the dissolved Diocese of Westminster. Vestments controversy (1550‚Äì3) Ridley played a major part in the vestments controversy. John Hooper, having been exiled during King Henry's reign, returned to England in 1548 from the churches in Z√ºrich that had been reformed by Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger in a highly iconoclastic fashion. When Hooper was invited to give a series of Lenten sermons before the king in February 1550, he spoke against Cranmer's 1549 ordinal whose oath mentioned \\"all saints\\" and required newly elected bishops and those attending the ordination ceremony to wear a cope and surplice. In Hooper's view, these requirements were vestiges of Judaism and Roman Catholicism, which had no biblical warrant for Christians since they were not used in the early Christian church.; Heinrich Bullinger, a major influence on John Hooper, Ridley's opponent in the vestments controversy. Summoned to answer to the Privy Council and archbishop‚Äîwho were primarily concerned with Hooper's willingness to accept the royal supremacy, which was also part of the oath for newly ordained clergy‚ÄîHooper evidently made sufficient reassurances, as he was soon appointed to the bishopric of Gloucester. Hooper declined the office, however, because of the required vestments and oath by the saints. The king accepted Hooper's position, but the Privy Council did not. Called before them on 15 May 1550, a compromise was reached. Vestments were to be considered a matter of adiaphora, or Res Indifferentes (\\"things indifferent\\", as opposed to an article of faith), and Hooper could be ordained without them at his discretion, but he must allow that others could wear them. Hooper passed confirmation of the new office again before the king and council on 20 July 1550 when the issue was raised again, and Cranmer was instructed that Hooper was not to be charged \\"with an oath burdensome to his conscience\\". Cranmer assigned Ridley to perform the consecration, and Ridley refused to do anything but follow the form of the ordinal as it had been prescribed by Parliament. Ridley, it seems likely, had some particular objection to Hooper. It has been suggested that Henrician exiles like Hooper, who had experienced some of the more radically reformed churches on the continent, were at odds with English clergy who had accepted and never left the established church. John Henry Primus also notes that on 24 July 1550, the day after receiving instructions for Hooper's unique consecration, the church of the Austin Friars in London had been granted to Jan Laski for use as a Stranger church. This was to be a designated place of worship for Continental Protestant refugees, a church with forms and practices that had taken reforms much further than Ridley would have liked. This development‚Äîthe use of a London church virtually outside Ridley's jurisdiction‚Äîwas one that Hooper had had a hand in. The Privy Council reiterated its position, and Ridley responded in person, agreeing that vestments are indifferent but making a compelling argument that the monarch may require indifferent things without exception. The council became divided in opinion, and the issue dragged on for months without resolution. Hooper now insisted that vestments were not indifferent, since they obscured the priesthood of Christ by encouraging hypocrisy and superstition. Warwick disagreed, emphasising that the king must be obeyed in things indifferent, and he pointed to St Paul's concessions to Jewish traditions in the early church. Finally, an acrimonious debate with Ridley went against Hooper. Ridley's position centred on maintaining order and authority; not the vestments themselves, Hooper's primary concern. =Hooper‚ÄìRidley debate= John Hooper clashed with Ridley as he advocated more radical reforms. Portrait by Henry Bryan Hall, 1839. In a Latin letter dated 3 October 1550, Hooper laid out his argument contra usum vestium.The letter exists but with some parts lost. With Ridley's reply (in English), it marks the first written representation of a split in the English Reformation. Hooper's argument is that vestments should not be used as they are not indifferent, nor is their use supported by scripture, a point he takes as self-evident. He contends that church practices must either have express biblical support or be things indifferent, approval for which is implied by scripture. Furthermore, an indifferent thing, if used, causes no profit or loss. Ridley objected in his response, saying that indifferent things do have profitable effects, which is the only reason they are used. Failing to distinguish between conditions for indifferent things in general and the church's use of indifferent things, Hooper then all but excludes the possibility of anything being indifferent in the four conditions he sets: :1) An indifferent thing has either an express justification in scripture or is implied by it, finding its origin and foundation in scripture. Hooper cites Romans 14:23 (whatever is not faith is sin), Romans 10:17 (faith comes from hearing the word of God), and Matthew 15:13 (everything not \\"planted\\" by God will be \\"rooted up\\") to argue that indifferent things must be done in faith, and since what cannot be proved from scripture is not of faith, indifferent things must be proved from scripture, which is both necessary and sufficient authority, as opposed to tradition. Hooper maintains that priestly garb distinguishing clergy from laity is not indicated by scripture; there is no mention of it in the New Testament as being in use in the early church, and the use of priestly clothing in the Old Testament is a Hebrew practice, a type or foreshadowing that finds its antitype in Christ, who abolishes the old order and recognises the spiritual equality, or priesthood, of all Christians. The historicity of these claims is further supported by Hooper with a reference to Polydore Vergil's De Inventoribus Rerum. In response, Ridley rejected Hooper's insistence on biblical origins and countered Hooper's interpretations of his chosen biblical texts. He points out that many non- controversial practices are not mentioned or implied in scripture. Ridley denies that early church practices are normative for the present situation, and he links such primitivist arguments with the Anabaptists. Joking that Hooper's reference to Christ's nakedness on the cross is as insignificant as the clothing King Herod put Christ in and \\"a jolly argument\\" for the Adamites, Ridley does not dispute Hooper's main typological argument, but neither does he accept that vestments are necessarily or exclusively identified with Israel and the Roman church. On Hooper's point about the priesthood of all believers, Ridley says it does not follow from this doctrine that all Christians must wear the same clothes. :2) An indifferent thing must be left to individual discretion; if required, it is no longer indifferent. For Ridley, on matters of indifference, one must defer conscience to the authorities of the church, or else \\"thou showest thyself a disordered person, disobedient, as [a] contemner of lawful authority, and a wounder of thy weak brother his conscience.\\" For him, the debate was finally about legitimate authority, not the merits and demerits of vestments themselves. He contended that it is only accidental that the compulsory ceases to be indifferent; the degeneration of a practice into non-indifference can be corrected without throwing out the practice. Things are not, \\"because they have been abused, to be taken away, but to be reformed and amended, and so kept still.\\" :3) An indifferent thing's usefulness must be demonstrated and not introduced arbitrarily. For this point, Hooper cites 1 Corinthians 14 and 2 Corinthians 13. As it contradicts the first point above, Primus contends that Hooper must now refer to indifferent things in the church and earlier meant indifferent things in general, in the abstract. Regardless, the apparent contradiction was seized by Ridley and undoubtedly hurt Hooper's case with the council. :4) Indifferent things must be introduced into the church with apostolic and evangelical lenity, not violent tyranny. In making such an inflammatory, risky statement (he later may have called his opponents \\"papists\\" in a part of his argument that is lost), Hooper may not have been suggesting England was tyrannical but that Rome was‚Äîand that England could become like Rome. Ridley warned Hooper of the implications of an attack on English ecclesiastical and civil authority and of the consequences of radical individual liberties, while also reminding him that it was Parliament that established the \\"Book of Common Prayer in the church of England\\". In closing, Hooper asks that the dispute be resolved by church authorities without looking to civil authorities for support‚Äîalthough the monarch was the head of both the church and the state. This hint of a plea for a separation of church and state would later be elaborated by Thomas Cartwright, but for Hooper, although the word of God was the highest authority, the state could still impose upon men's consciences (such as requiring them not to be Roman Catholic) when it had a biblical warrant. Moreover, Hooper himself addressed the civil magistrates, suggesting that the clergy supporting vestments were a threat to the state, and he declared his willingness to be martyred for his cause. Ridley, by contrast, responds with humour, calling this \\"a magnifical promise set forth with a stout style\\". He invites Hooper to agree that vestments are indifferent, not to condemn them as sinful, and then he will ordain him even if he wears street clothes to the ceremony. =Outcome of the controversy= The weaknesses in Hooper's argument, Ridley's laconic and temperate rejoinder, and Ridley's offer of a compromise no doubt turned the council against Hooper's inflexible convictions when he did not accept it. Heinrich Bullinger, Pietro Martire Vermigli, and Martin Bucer, while agreeing with Hooper's views, ceased to support him for the pragmatic sake of unity and slower reform. Only Jan Laski remained a constant ally. Some time in mid-December 1550, Hooper was put under house arrest, during which time he wrote and published A godly Confession and protestation of the Christian faith. Because of this publication, his persistent nonconformism, and violations of the terms of his house arrest, Hooper was placed in Thomas Cranmer's custody at Lambeth Palace for two weeks by the Privy Council on 13 January 1551. Hooper was then sent to Fleet Prison by the council, who made that decision on 27 January. On 15 February, Hooper submitted to consecration in vestments in a letter to Cranmer. He was consecrated Bishop of Gloucester on 8 March 1551, and shortly thereafter, preached before the king in vestments. Downfall (1553‚Äì5) Edward VI, here as Prince of Wales, brought about Ridley's downfall. On 2 February 1553 Cranmer was ordered to appoint John Knox as vicar of All Hallows, Bread Street in London, placing him under the authority of Ridley. Knox returned to London in order to deliver a sermon before the king and the court during Lent after which he refused to take his assigned post.; That same year, Ridley pleaded with Edward VI to give some of his empty palaces over to the city to house homeless women and children. One such foundation was Bridewell Royal Hospital, which is today known as King Edward's School, Witley. Edward VI became seriously ill from tuberculosis and in mid-June the councillors were told that he did not have long to live. They set to work to convince several judges to put on the throne Lady Jane Grey, Edward's cousin, instead of Mary, daughter of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon and a Roman Catholic. On 17 June 1553 the king made his will noting Jane would succeed him, contravening the Third Succession Act. Ridley signed the letters patent giving the English throne to Lady Jane Grey. On 9 July 1553 he preached a sermon at St Paul's cross in which he affirmed that the princesses Mary and Elizabeth were bastards. By mid-July, there were serious provincial revolts in Mary‚Äôs favour and support for Jane in the council fell. As Mary was proclaimed queen, Ridley, Jane‚Äôs father, the Duke of Suffolk and others were imprisoned. Ridley was sent to the Tower of London. Throughout February 1554 the political leaders of the supporters of Jane were executed, including Jane herself. After that, there was time to deal with the religious leaders of the English Reformation and so on 8 March 1554 the Privy Council ordered Cranmer, Ridley, and Hugh Latimer to be transferred to Bocardo prison in Oxford to await trial for heresy. The trial of Latimer and Ridley started shortly after Cranmer's with John Jewel acting as notary to Ridley. Their verdicts came almost immediately and they were to be burned at the stake.; Death and legacy Ridley being burned at the stake, together with Hugh Latimer. From John Foxe's Book of Martyrs. The sentence was carried out on 16 October 1555 in Oxford. Cranmer was taken to a tower to watch the proceedings. Ridley burned extremely slowly and suffered a great deal: his brother-in-law had put more tinder on the pyre in order to speed his death, but this only caused his lower parts to burn. Latimer is supposed to have said to Ridley, \\"Be of good comfort, and play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.\\" This was quoted in Foxe's Book of Martyrs. A metal cross in a cobbled patch of road in Broad Street, Oxford, marks the site. Eventually Ridley and Latimer were seen as martyrs for their support of a Church of England independent from the Roman Catholic Church. Along with Thomas Cranmer, they are known as the Oxford Martyrs. In the Victorian era, his death was commemorated by the Martyrs' Memorial, located near the site of his execution. As well as being a monument to the English Reformation and the doctrines of the Protestant and Reformed doctrines, the memorial is a landmark of the 19th century, a monument stoutly resisted by John Keble, John Henry Newman and others of the Tractarian Movement and Oxford Movement. Profoundly alarmed at the Romewardizing intrusions and efforts at realignment that the movement was attempting to bring into the Church of England, Protestant and Reformed Anglican clergymen raised the funds for erecting the monument, with its highly anti-Roman Catholic inscription, a memorial to over three hundred years of history and reformation. As a result, the monument was built 300 years after the events it commemorates. Stained glass window depicting Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer, the Oxford Martyrs In 1881, Ridley Hall in Cambridge, England, was founded in his memory for the training of Anglican priests. Ridley College, a private University-preparatory school located in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada, was founded in his honour in 1889. Also named after him is Ridley Melbourne, a theological college in Australia, founded in 1910. There is a Church of England church dedicated to him in Welling, southeast London. The words spoken to Ridley by Latimer at their execution are used . Ridley and Latimer are remembered with a commemoration in the Calendar of saints in some parts of the Anglican Communion on 16 October.

There are two types of waiting room. One is where individuals leave for appointments one at a time, or in small groups, for instance at a doctor's office, a hospital triage area or outside a school headmaster's office. The other is where people leave en masse such as those at railway stations, bus stations, and airports. These two examples also highlight the difference between waiting rooms where one is asked to wait (private waiting rooms) and waiting rooms one can enter at will (public waiting rooms). Order in private rooms Medical open air waiting room. Infirmary at Canjambari, Guinea-Bissau, 1974 People in private waiting rooms are queued up based on various methods in different types of waiting rooms. In hospital emergency department waiting areas, patients are triaged by a nurse, and they are seen by the doctor depending on the severity of their medical condition. In a doctor's or dentist's waiting room, patients are generally seen in the order in which their appointments are for, with the exception of emergency cases, which get seen immediately upon their arrival. In Canada, where there is publicly-provided health care, controversy has arisen when some important people or celebrities have jumped the line (which is supposed to be based on the appointment order or by severity of condition). In some government offices, such as motor vehicle registration offices or social assistance services, there is a \\"first-come, first-served\\" approach in which clients take a number when they arrive. The clients are then seen in the order of their number. In the 2010s, some government offices have a triage-based variant of the first-come, first-served approach, in which some clients are seen by the civil servants faster than others, depending on the nature of their service request and/or the availability of civil servants. This approach can lead to frustration for clients who are waiting, because one client who has been waiting for 30 minutes may see another client come in, take a number, and then be seen within five minutes. In car repair businesses, clients typically wait until their vehicle is repaired; the service manager can only give an estimate of the approximate waiting time. Clients waiting in the entrance or waiting area of a restaurant for a table normally are seated based on whether they have reservations, or for those without reservations, on a first-come, first served approach; however, important customers or celebrities may be put to the front of the line. In restaurants, customers may also be able to jump the line by giving a large gratuity or bribe to the maitre d'hotel or head waiter. Some restaurants which are co-located with or combined with a retail store or gift shop ask customers who are waiting for a table to browse in the merchandise section until their table's availability is announced on a PA system or via a pager; this strategy can lead to increased purchases in the retail part of the establishment. One combination restaurant/store is the US Cracker Barrel chain. Some restaurants ask customers who are waiting for a table to sit in the restaurant's bar or its licensed lounge area; this approach may lead to increased sales of alcoholic beverages. Waiting rooms may be staffed or unstaffed. In waiting rooms that are staffed, a receptionist or administrative staffer sits behind a desk or counter to greet customers/clients, give them information about the expected waiting period, and answer any questions about their appointment time or the appointment process. In doctors' or dentists' waiting rooms, the patients may be able to make additional appointments, pay for appointments, or deal with other administrative tasks with the receptionist or administrator. In police stations, check cashing stores and some government waiting rooms, the receptionist or administrator is behind a plexiglass barrier, with either small holes to permit communication, or, in higher-security settings, a microphone and speaker. In reception areas with a plexiglass barrier, there may be a heavy-duty drawer to enable the client to provide money or papers to the receptionist and for the receptionist to provide documents to the client. The plexiglass barrier and the drawer system help to protect the receptionists from aggressive or potentially violent clients. Amenities Most waiting rooms have seating. Some have adjacent toilets. It is not uncommon to find vending machines in public waiting rooms or newspapers and magazines in private waiting rooms. Also common in waiting rooms in the United States or in airports are public drinking fountains. Some waiting rooms have television access or music. The increasing prevalence of mobile devices has led to many waiting rooms providing electric outlets and free Wi-Fi Internet connections, though cybersecurity is a concern as unsecured connections may be vulnerable to attack, tampering, or even simply by piggybacking users who are within range but not waiting. Sometimes found in airports and railway stations are special waiting rooms, often called \\"lounges\\", for those who have paid more. These will generally be less crowded and will have superior seating and better facilities. Waiting rooms for high-end services may provide complimentary drinks and snacks. In other media =In fiction= The films Brief Encounter and The Terminal use waiting rooms as sets for a large part of their duration. They are used elsewhere in the arts to symbolize waiting in the general sense, to symbolize transitions in life and for scenes depicting emptiness, insignificance or sadness. In the play No Exit, by French existentialist philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, several strangers find themselves waiting in a mysterious room, where they each wonder why; finally, they each realize that they are in Hell, and that their punishment is being forced to be with each other (\\"L'enfer, c'est les autres\\", which translates as \\"Hell is other people\\"). In the 2010 Bollywood film The Waiting Room, directed by Maneej Premnath and produced by Sunil Doshi, four passengers waiting in a remote South Indian railway station are stranded there on a rainy night. A serial killer is on the prowl, targeting the passengers of the waiting room, creating intense fear among them. =In video games= The term \\"waiting room\\" also extends to the realm of video games as a similar virtual waiting area where players for an online multiplayer game are placed into while waiting for all remaining players for a game session to be present. A virtual waiting room may be a mere, static loading screen (such as the waiting screens in the mobile game Star Wars: Force Arena), or a playable environment in of itself where readied players can practice their skills to pass the time needed for all players to come onboard to begin the session, such as a dedicated \\"waiting room\\" arena in Super Smash Bros. Brawl and its subsequent sequels, where players can practice their fighting moves with their chosen character while waiting for other players to arrive.

Trial and death On 15 October 1553 he preached at Northampton, warning the congregation that 'the errors of the popish religion' would be restored to the church by Queen Mary and that England was threatened with the visitation of God for her 'lukewarm indifference in the cause of Christ, and the privileges of his glorious gospel'. In October 1554 he was arrested by the order of the Bishop of London after having given a sermon at All Hallows Bread Street.. After three months imprisonment he was arraigned on 29 January 1555, and convicted of heresy.. He was taken to Coventry,. and burned at the stake on 8 February 1555. Before being chained to the stake, he kissed it, saying, 'Welcome the cross of Christ, welcome everlasting life!'. The martyrdom of Saunders was said to have been the start of Joyce Lewis's conversion and her later martyrdom.Henry Summerson, ‚ÄòLewis , Joyce other married name Joyce Appleby, Lady Appleby] (d. 1557)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 31 Jan 2015 While at Lichfield, Saunders had married a woman named Joanna, by whom he had a son, Samuel.

His preaching inspired the graham flour, graham bread, and graham cracker products. Graham is often referred to as the \\"Father of Vegetarianism\\" in the United States of America.Misiroglu, Gina. (2008). American Countercultures: An Encyclopedia of Nonconformists, Alternative Lifestyles, and Radical Ideas in U.S. History. Routledge. p. 737. Early life Graham was born in 1794 in Suffield, Connecticut, to a family with 17 children; his father was 70 years old when Graham was born and his mother was mentally ill. His father died when Graham was two, and he spent his childhood moving from one relative's home to another. One of his relatives ran a tavern where Graham was put to work; his experience with drunkenness there led him to hate alcohol his whole life and forswear drinking, which made him an exception among his peers at the time. He was often sick, and missed a great deal of schooling. He worked as a farm hand, cleaner, and teacher before deciding on the ministry as an antidote for his poor health. He entered preparatory school at Amherst Academy in his late 20s to become a minister, as his father and grandfather had been. Here, his gift for oratory was recognized. He was expelled from the academy when his schoolmates claimed he had improperly approached a woman. The expulsion caused Graham a nervous breakdown. To recover, he moved to Little Compton, Rhode Island. There, he met and married Sarah Earle, who had nursed him back to health. He studied theology privately, and in 1828 began working as an itinerant preacher at the Bound Brook Presbyterian Church in Bound Brook, New Jersey. Career In 1830, Graham accepted a position at the Philadelphia Temperance Society. He left six months later to focus on preaching health. Graham's appointment and conversion to vegetarianism came as the 1829‚Äì51 cholera pandemic was breaking in Europe, and Americans were terrified that it would reach the United States. Accepted medical opinion was that the best way to prevent contracting cholera was to eat plenty of meat, drink port wine, and avoid vegetables. People also believed that cholera was a plague, a punishment from God. The Philadelphia Temperance Society was led not by ministers, as most other temperance societies were, but by doctors who were primarily concerned with the health effects of consuming alcohol. Moving in that company, Graham may have met two of the other fathers of American vegetarianism: William Metcalfe, an English minister who established a vegetarian church in Philadelphia, and William A. Alcott, a Philadelphia doctor who wrote extensively about vegetarianism and wrote the first American vegetarian cookbook. Graham taught himself about physiology and apparently arrived at his own conclusion that meat was just as much an expression of and spur to gluttony as alcohol was, that they corrupted both the body and soul of individuals and harmed families and society. His belief was influenced by the book Treatise on Physiology by Fran√ßois-Joseph-Victor Broussais, published in Philadelphia in 1826, that claimed what people ate had enormous influence on their health. Graham's interest was also captured by the books written by the German chemist, Friedrich Accum, called Treatise on Adulteration of Foods, and Culinary Poisons, in which he denounced the use of chemical additives in food and especially in bread, and Treatise on the Art of Making Good and Wholesome Bread. Wheat flour at that time was often doctored to hide odors from spoilage, to extend it, and to whiten it, and bread was made from very finely ground flour (which Graham viewed as \\"tortured\\") and brewers yeast (used to make beer). Like other members of the temperance movement, Graham viewed physical pleasure and especially sexual stimulation with suspicion, as things that excited lust leading to behavior that harmed individuals, families, and societies. Graham was strongly influenced by the Bible and Christian theology in his own idiosyncratic way. He believed that people should eat only plants, like Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and believed that plague and illness were caused by living in ways that ignored natural law. He urged people to remain calm, and not allow worry or lust to shake them from living rightly ‚Äì perhaps one of the first people to claim that stress causes disease. From these views, Graham created a theology and diet aimed at keeping individuals, families, and society pure and healthy ‚Äì drinking pure water and eating a vegetarian diet anchored by bread made at home from flour coarsely ground at home so that it remained wholesome and natural, containing no added spices or other \\"stimulants\\" and a rigorous lifestyle that included sleeping on hard beds and avoiding warm baths. The regimen has been described as an early example of preventive medicine. The emphasis on milling and baking at home was part of his vision of America in which women remained at home and nursed their families into health and maintained them there, as his wife had done for him. Graham believed that adhering to such diet would prevent people from having impure thoughts and in turn would stop masturbation (thought by Graham to be a catalyst for blindness and early deathHelen Lefkowitz Horowitz (Ed.), Attitudes toward Sex in Antebellum America, 2006, See specific pages.) His piece On Self-Pollution, published in 1834, contributed to the masturbation scare in antebellum America. He believed youthful masturbation was dangerous to children's health because of the immaturity of their reproductive organs. As a skilled and fiery preacher, his peculiar message, combining patriotism, theology, diet, lifestyle, and messages already prevalent from the temperance movement, captured the attention of the frightened public and outraged bakers and butchers, as well as the medical establishment. When the cholera epidemic reached New York in 1832, people who had followed his advice appeared to thrive, and his fame exploded. When he published his first book in 1837, Treatise on Bread and Bread-Making, his lectures in New York and Boston that year were thronged; the Boston lecture was disrupted by a threat of riots by butchers and commercial bakers. =Grahamism= As his fame spread, \\"Grahamism\\" became a movement, and people inspired by his preaching began to develop and market Graham flour, Graham bread, and graham crackers. He neither invented nor endorsed any specific product, nor did he receive any money from their sale. Graham influenced other Americans including Horace Greeley and John Harvey Kellogg, founder of the Battle Creek Sanitarium. Grahamite boarding-houses were established in the 1830s.Shprintzen, Adam D. (2013). The Vegetarian Crusade: The Rise of an American Reform Movement, 1817‚Äì1921. University of North Carolina Press. pp. 27‚Äì30. The Grahamites applied dietetic and hygienic principles to everyday life including cold baths, hard mattresses, open windows, a vegetarian diet with Graham bread and drinking cold water.Gratzer, Walter. (2005). Terrors of the Table: The Curious History of Nutrition. Oxford University Press. p. 193. Animal flesh was banned from Grahamite homes but eggs were allowed to be eaten at breakfast and were an important component of Grahamite diets. =American Physiological Society= In 1837, Colonel John Benson, Graham and William Alcott founded the American Physiological Society (APS) in Boston to promote Grahamism.Iacobbo, Karen; Iacobbo, Michael. (2004). Vegetarian America: A History. Praeger Publishing. pp. 36‚Äì37. Unrelated to the American Physiological Society of 1887, see J. W. Lazar, \\"American neurophysiology and two nineteenth-century American Physiological Societies\\", Journal of the History of Neuroscience 26:2:154-168 (2017). Alcott was first President of the Society.Tompkins, Kyla Wazana. (2012). Racial Indigestion: Eating Bodies in the 19th Century. New York University Press. p. 88. After a year, the Society was reported to have had 251 members, including 93 women. It lasted just three years. Laura J. Miller commented that the Society was \\"the most visible association promoting natural foods principles until the American Vegetarian Society was founded in 1850\\".Miller, Laura J. (2017). Building Nature's Market: The Business and Politics of Natural Foods. University of Chicago Press. p. 34. Many of the APS members suffered from chronic disease and became vegetarian. It has been described as \\"likely the first exclusively vegetarian organization in the United States\\". It was also the first American natural hygiene organization. A notable member of the APS was Mary Gove Nichols, who gave health lectures to women. In 1837, Graham and David Cambell founded The Graham Journal of Health and Longevity.Cayleff, Susan E. (2016). Nature's Path: A History of Naturopathic Healing in America. Johns Hopkins University Press. p. 30. It was \\"designed to illustrate by facts, and sustain by reason and principles the science of human life as taught by Sylvester Graham\\".Fletcher, Robert Samuel. (1971). A History of Oberlin College: From its Foundation Through the Civil War Volume 1. Arno Press. p. 319 It was edited by Campbell, Secretary of the APR (1837‚Äì1839) and five volumes were published.Wolfe, Richard J. (2001). Tarnished Idol: William Thomas Green Morton and the Introduction of Surgical Anesthesia: A Chronicle of the Ether Controversy. Norman Publishing. p. 514. Note: David Cambell has also been referred to as David Campbell. In 1840, the journal merged with the Library of Health, edited by Alcott.Alcott, William. (1839). The New Arrangement. The Graham Journal of Health and Longevity 3 (#22): 355. \\"We barely gave notice in our last that the Graham Journal and Library of Health were to be united in one, after the first of January, 1840.\\"Shprintzen, Adam D. (2013). The Vegetarian Crusade: The Rise of an American Reform Movement, 1817‚Äì1921. University of North Carolina Press. p. 37. =American Vegetarian Society= In 1850, Alcott, William Metcalfe, Russell Trall, and Graham founded the American Vegetarian Society in New York CityThe American Vegetarian Society, International Vegetarian Union website on American vegetarian history, modeled on a similar organization established in Great Britain in 1847. Death Graham died of complications after receiving opium enemas, as directed by his doctor, at the age of 57 at home in Northampton, Massachusetts. His early death was the source of criticism and speculation.Shprintzen, Adam D. (2013). The Vegetarian Crusade: The Rise of an American Reform Movement, 1817‚Äì1921. University of North Carolina Press. pp. 73‚Äì76. Historian Stephen Nissenbaum has written that Graham died \\"after violating his own strictures by taking liquor and meat in a last desperate attempt to recover his health\\".Nissenbaum, Stephen. (1980). Sex, Diet, and Debility in Jacksonian America: Sylvester Graham and Health Reform. Greenwood Press. p. 15. Russell Trall, who had visited Graham, noted that he had strayed from a strict vegetarian diet and was prescribed meat by his doctor to increase his blood circulation. Trall wrote that before his death Graham regretted this decision and \\"fully and verily believed in the theory of vegetable diet as explained in his works\\". After his death, vegetarians distanced themselves from Grahamism. However, his vegetarian message was disseminated far into the 20th century.Gratzer, Walter. (2005). Terrors of the Table: The Curious History of Nutrition. Oxford University Press. pp. 192‚Äì197. Food historians cite Graham as one of the earliest food faddists in America.Ashraf, Hea-Ran L.

It is a municipality that continually improves on a physical and a social level until environmental and pathological conditions are reached establishing an acceptable morbidity rate for the population. Its modern form derives from a World Health Organization (WHO) initiative on Healthy Cities and Villages in 1986, but has a history dating back to the mid 19th century.Niyi Awofeso.

In mathematics, specifically algebraic topology, a covering map (also covering projection) is a continuous function p from a topological space C to a topological space X such that each point in X has an open neighbourhood evenly covered by p (as shown in the image). In this case, C is called a covering space and X the base space of the covering projection. The definition implies that every covering map is a local homeomorphism. Covering spaces play an important role in homotopy theory, harmonic analysis, Riemannian geometry and differential topology. In Riemannian geometry for example, ramification is a generalization of the notion of covering maps. Covering spaces are also deeply intertwined with the study of homotopy groups and, in particular, the fundamental group. An important application comes from the result that, if X is a \\"sufficiently good\\" topological space, there is a bijection between the collection of all isomorphism classes of connected coverings of X and the conjugacy classes of subgroups of the fundamental group of X.  Formal definition  Let X be a topological space. A covering space of X is a topological space C together with a continuous surjective map :p \\\\colon C \\\\to X\\\\, such that for every x \\\\in X, there exists an open neighborhood U of x, such that p^{-1}(U) (the pre-image of U under p) is a union of disjoint open sets in C, each of which is mapped homeomorphically onto U by p. Equivalently, a covering space of X may be defined as a fiber bundle p \\\\colon C \\\\to X with discrete fibers. The map p is called the covering map, the space X is often called the base space of the covering, and the space C is called the total space of the covering. For any point x in the base the inverse image of x in C is necessarily a discrete space called the fiber over x. The special open neighborhoods U of x given in the definition are called evenly covered neighborhoods. The evenly covered neighborhoods form an open cover of the space X. The homeomorphic copies in C of an evenly covered neighborhood U are called the sheets over U. One generally pictures C as \\"hovering above\\" X, with p mapping \\"downwards\\", the sheets over U being horizontally stacked above each other and above U, and the fiber over x consisting of those points of C that lie \\"vertically above\\" x. In particular, covering maps are locally trivial. This means that locally, each covering map is 'isomorphic' to a projection in the sense that there is a homeomorphism, h, from the pre-image p^{-1}(U), of an evenly covered neighbourhood U, onto U \\\\times F, where F is the fiber, satisfying the local trivialization condition, which is that, if we project U \\\\times F onto U, \\\\pi\\\\colon U \\\\times F \\\\to U, so the composition of the projection \\\\pi with the homeomorphism h will be a map \\\\pi\\\\circ h from the pre-image p^{-1}(U) onto U, then the derived composition \\\\pi\\\\circ h will equal p locally (within p^{-1}(U)). =Alternative definitions= Many authors impose some connectivity conditions on the spaces X and C in the definition of a covering map. In particular, many authors require both spaces to be path-connected and locally path-connected. This can prove helpful because many theorems hold only if the spaces in question have these properties. Some authors omit the assumption of surjectivity, for if X is connected and C is nonempty then surjectivity of the covering map actually follows from the other axioms.  Examples  * Every space trivially covers itself. * A connected and locally path-connected topological space X has a universal cover if and only if it is semi-locally simply connected. * \\\\mathbb{R} is the universal cover of the circle S^1. * The spin group \\\\operatorname{Spin}(n) is a double cover of the special orthogonal group and a universal cover when n > 2. The accidental, or exceptional isomorphisms for Lie groups then give isomorphisms between spin groups in low dimension and classical Lie groups. * The unitary group \\\\operatorname{U}(n) has universal cover \\\\operatorname{SU}(n)\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}. * The n-sphere S^n is a double cover of real projective space P_n(\\\\mathbb{R}) and is a universal cover for n> 1. * Every manifold has an orientable double cover that is connected if and only if the manifold is non-orientable. * The uniformization theorem asserts that every Riemann surface has a universal cover conformally equivalent to the Riemann sphere, the complex plane, or the unit disc. * The universal cover of a wedge of n circles is the Cayley graph of the free group on n generators, i.e. a Bethe lattice. * The torus is a double cover of the Klein bottle. This can be seen using the polygons for the torus and the Klein bottle, and observing that the double cover of the circle S^1 \\\\to S^1 (embedding into \\\\mathbb{C} sending z \\\\mapsto z^2). * Every graph has a bipartite double cover. Since every graph is homotopic to a wedge of circles, its universal cover is a Cayley graph. * Every immersion from a compact manifold to a manifold of the same dimension is a covering of its image. * Another effective tool for constructing covering spaces is using quotients by free finite group actions. * For example, the space L_{p/q} defined by the quotient of S^3 (embedded into \\\\mathbb{C}^2) is defined by the quotient space via the \\\\mathbb{Z}/q-action (z_1,z_2) \\\\mapsto (e^{2\\\\pi i/q}z_1,e^{2\\\\pi i p/q}z_2). This space, called a lens space, has fundamental group \\\\mathbb{Z}/q and has universal cover S^3. * The map of affine schemes \\\\operatorname{Spec}( \\\\mathbb{C}[x,t,t^{-1}]/(x^n - t)) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec}(\\\\mathbb{C}[t,t^{-1}]) forms a covering space with \\\\mathbb{Z}/n as its group of deck transformations. This is an example of a cyclic Galois cover.  Properties  =Common local properties= * Every cover p \\\\colon C \\\\to X is a local homeomorphism; that is, for every c\\\\in C, there exists a neighborhood U\\\\subseteq C of c and a neighborhood V\\\\subseteq X of p(c) such that the restriction of p to U yields a homeomorphism from U to V. This implies that C and X share all local properties. If X is simply connected and C is connected, then this holds globally as well, and the covering p is a homeomorphism. * If p\\\\colon E\\\\to B and p'\\\\colon E'\\\\to B' are covering maps, then so is the map p \\\\times p' \\\\colon E\\\\times E' \\\\to B\\\\times B' given by (p\\\\times p')(e, e') = (p(e), p'(e')). =Homeomorphism of the fibers= For every x in X, the fiber over x is a discrete subset of C. On every connected component of X, the fibers are homeomorphic. If X is connected, there is a discrete space F such that for every x in X the fiber over x is homeomorphic to F and, moreover, for every x in X there is a neighborhood U of x such that its full pre-image p‚àí1(U) is homeomorphic to . In particular, the cardinality of the fiber over x is equal to the cardinality of F and it is called the degree of the cover . Thus, if every fiber has n elements, we speak of an n-fold covering (for the case , the covering is trivial; when , the covering is a double cover; when , the covering is a triple cover and so on). =Lifting properties= If is a cover and Œ≥ is a path in X (i.e. a continuous map from the unit interval into X) and is a point \\"lying over\\" Œ≥(0) (i.e. , then there exists a unique path Œì in C lying over Œ≥ (i.e. ) such that . The curve Œì is called the lift of Œ≥. If x and y are two points in X connected by a path, then that path furnishes a bijection between the fiber over x and the fiber over y via the lifting property. More generally, let be a continuous map to X from a path connected and locally path connected space Z. Fix a base-point , and choose a point \\"lying over\\" f(z) (i.e. ). Then there exists a lift of f (that is, a continuous map for which and ) if and only if the induced homomorphisms and at the level of fundamental groups satisfy Moreover, if such a lift g of f exists, it is unique. In particular, if the space Z is assumed to be simply connected (so that is trivial), condition is automatically satisfied, and every continuous map from Z to X can be lifted. Since the unit interval is simply connected, the lifting property for paths is a special case of the lifting property for maps stated above. If is a covering and and are such that , then p# is injective at the level of fundamental groups, and the induced homomorphisms are isomorphisms for all . Both of these statements can be deduced from the lifting property for continuous maps. Surjectivity of p# for follows from the fact that for all such n, the n-sphere Sn is simply connected and hence every continuous map from Sn to X can be lifted to C. =Equivalence= Let and be two coverings. One says that the two coverings p1 and p2 are equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism and such that . Equivalence classes of coverings correspond to conjugacy classes of subgroups of the fundamental group of X, as discussed below. If is a covering (rather than a homeomorphism) and , then one says that p2 dominates p1. =Covering of a manifold= Since coverings are local homeomorphisms, a covering of a topological n-manifold is an n-manifold. (One can prove that the covering space is second-countable from the fact that the fundamental group of a manifold is always countable.) However a space covered by an n-manifold may be a non-Hausdorff manifold. An example is given by letting C be the plane with the origin deleted and X the quotient space obtained by identifying every point with . If is the quotient map then it is a covering since the action of Z on C generated by is properly discontinuous. The points and do not have disjoint neighborhoods in X. Any covering space of a differentiable manifold may be equipped with a (natural) differentiable structure that turns p (the covering map in question) into a local diffeomorphism ‚Äì a map with constant rank n.  Universal covers  A covering space is a universal covering space if it is simply connected. The name universal cover comes from the following important property: if the mapping is a universal cover of the space X and the mapping is any cover of the space X where the covering space C is connected, then there exists a covering map such that . This can be phrased as > The universal cover (of the space X) covers any connected cover (of the > space X). The map f is unique in the following sense: if we fix a point x in the space X and a point d in the space D with and a point c in the space C with , then there exists a unique covering map such that and . If the space X has a universal cover then that universal cover is essentially unique: if the mappings and are two universal covers of the space X then there exists a homeomorphism such that . The space X has a universal cover if it is connected, locally path-connected and semi-locally simply connected. The universal cover of the space X can be constructed as a certain space of paths in the space X. More explicitly, it forms a principal bundle with the fundamental group as structure group. The example given above is a universal cover. The map from unit quaternions to rotations of 3D space described in quaternions and spatial rotation is also a universal cover. If the space X carries some additional structure, then its universal cover usually inherits that structure: * If the space X is a manifold, then so is its universal cover D. * If the space X is a Riemann surface, then so is its universal cover D, and p is a holomorphic map. * If the space X is a Riemannian manifold, then so is its universal cover, and p is a local isometry. * If the space X is a Lorentzian manifold, then so is its universal cover. Furthermore, suppose the subset p‚àí1(U) is a disjoint union of open sets each of which is diffeomorphic with U by the mapping p. If the space X contains a closed timelike curve (CTC), then the space X is timelike multiply connected (no CTC can be timelike homotopic to a point, as that point would not be causally well behaved), its universal (diffeomorphic) cover is timelike simply connected (it does not contain a CTC). * If X is a Lie group (as in the two examples above), then so is its universal cover D, and the mapping p is a homomorphism of Lie groups. In this case the universal cover is also called the universal covering group. This has particular application to representation theory and quantum mechanics, since ordinary representations of the universal covering group (D) are projective representations of the original (classical) group (X). The universal cover first arose in the theory of analytic functions as the natural domain of an analytic continuation.  G-coverings  Let G be a discrete group acting on the topological space X. This means that each element g of G is associated to a homeomorphism Hg of X onto itself, in such a way that Hg h is always equal to Hg ‚àò Hh for any two elements g and h of G. (Or in other words, a group action of the group G on the space X is just a group homomorphism of the group G into the group Homeo(X) of self-homeomorphisms of X.) It is natural to ask under what conditions the projection from X to the orbit space X/G is a covering map. This is not always true since the action may have fixed points. An example for this is the cyclic group of order 2 acting on a product by the twist action where the non-identity element acts by . Thus the study of the relation between the fundamental groups of X and X/G is not so straightforward. However the group G does act on the fundamental groupoid of X, and so the study is best handled by considering groups acting on groupoids, and the corresponding orbit groupoids. The theory for this is set down in Chapter 11 of the book Topology and groupoids referred to below. The main result is that for discontinuous actions of a group G on a Hausdorff space X which admits a universal cover, then the fundamental groupoid of the orbit space X/G is isomorphic to the orbit groupoid of the fundamental groupoid of X, i.e. the quotient of that groupoid by the action of the group G. This leads to explicit computations, for example of the fundamental group of the symmetric square of a space.  Deck (covering) transformation group, regular covers  A covering transformation or deck transformation or automorphism of a cover p:C \\\\to X is a homeomorphism f:C \\\\to C such that p \\\\circ f = p . The set of all deck transformations of p forms a group under composition, the deck transformation group \\\\operatorname{Aut}(p). Deck transformations are also called covering transformations. Every deck transformation permutes the elements of each fiber. This defines a group action of the deck transformation group on each fiber. Note that by the unique lifting property, if f is not the identity and C is path connected, then f has no fixed points. Now suppose p:C \\\\to X is a covering map and C (and therefore also X) is connected and locally path connected. The action of \\\\operatorname{Aut}(p) on each fiber is free. If this action is transitive on some fiber, then it is transitive on all fibers, and we call the cover regular (or normal or Galois). Every such regular cover is a principal G-bundle, where is considered as a discrete topological group. Every universal cover p:D \\\\to X is regular, with deck transformation group being isomorphic to the fundamental group \\\\pi_1(X). As another important example, consider \\\\C the complex plane and \\\\C^{\\\\times} the complex plane minus the origin. Then the map p\\\\colon \\\\C^{\\\\times} \\\\to \\\\C^{\\\\times} with p(z)=z^{n} is a regular cover. The deck transformations are multiplications with n-th roots of unity and the deck transformation group is therefore isomorphic to the cyclic group \\\\Z/n\\\\Z. Likewise, the map \\\\exp\\\\colon \\\\C \\\\to \\\\C^{\\\\times} with \\\\exp(z)=e^{z} is the universal cover.  Monodromy action  Again suppose p\\\\colon C\\\\to X is a covering map and C (and therefore also X) is connected and locally path connected. If x is in X and c belongs to the fiber over x (i.e., p(c) = x), and \\\\gamma\\\\colon [0, 1] \\\\to X is a path with \\\\gamma(0) = \\\\gamma(1) = x, then this path lifts to a unique path in C with starting point c. The end point of this lifted path need not be c, but it must lie in the fiber over x. It turns out that this end point only depends on the class of Œ≥ in the fundamental group . In this fashion we obtain a right group action of on the fiber over x. This is known as the monodromy action. There are two actions on the fiber over acts on the left and acts on the right. These two actions are compatible in the following sense: f\\\\cdot(c\\\\cdot\\\\gamma) = (f\\\\cdot c)\\\\cdot\\\\gamma for all f in Aut(p), c in p‚àí1(x) and Œ≥ in . If p is a universal cover, then Aut(p) can be naturally identified with the opposite group of so that the left action of the opposite group of coincides with the action of Aut(p) on the fiber over x. Note that Aut(p) and are naturally isomorphic in this case (as a group is always naturally isomorphic to its opposite through . If p is a regular cover, then Aut(p) is naturally isomorphic to a quotient of . In general (for good spaces), Aut(p) is naturally isomorphic to the quotient of the normalizer of in over , where . More on the group structure Let be a covering map where both X and C are path-connected. Let be a basepoint of X and let be one of its pre-images in C, that is . There is an induced homomorphism of fundamental groups which is injective by the lifting property of coverings. Specifically if Œ≥ is a closed loop at c such that , that is is null-homotopic in X, then consider a null-homotopy of as a map from the 2-disc D2 to X such that the restriction of f to the boundary S1 of D2 is equal to . By the lifting property the map f lifts to a continuous map such that the restriction of g to the boundary S1 of D2 is equal to Œ≥. Therefore, Œ≥ is null-homotopic in C, so that the kernel of is trivial and thus is an injective homomorphism. Therefore, is isomorphic to the subgroup of . If is another pre-image of x in C then the subgroups and are conjugate in by p-image of a curve in C connecting c to c1. Thus a covering map defines a conjugacy class of subgroups of and one can show that equivalent covers of X define the same conjugacy class of subgroups of . For a covering the group can also be seen to be equal to :\\\\Gamma_p(c) = \\\\\\\\{ [\\\\gamma] : \\\\gamma_C \\\\text{ is a closed curve in } C \\\\text { passing through } c\\\\in C \\\\\\\\}, the set of homotopy classes of those closed curves Œ≥ based at x whose lifts Œ≥C in C, starting at c, are closed curves at c. If X and C are path-connected, the degree of the cover p (that is, the cardinality of any fiber of p) is equal to the index [] of the subgroup in . A key result of the covering space theory says that for a \\"sufficiently good\\" space X (namely, if X is path-connected, locally path- connected and semi-locally simply connected) there is in fact a bijection between equivalence classes of path-connected covers of X and the conjugacy classes of subgroups of the fundamental group . The main step in proving this result is establishing the existence of a universal cover, that is a cover corresponding to the trivial subgroup of . Once the existence of a universal cover C of X is established, if H ‚â§ 1(X, x) is an arbitrary subgroup, the space C/H is the covering of X corresponding to H. One also needs to check that two covers of X corresponding to the same (conjugacy class of) subgroup of are equivalent. Connected cell complexes and connected manifolds are examples of \\"sufficiently good\\" spaces. Let N(Œìp) be the normalizer of Œìp in . The deck transformation group Aut(p) is isomorphic to the quotient group N(Œìp)/Œìp. If p is a universal covering, then Œìp is the trivial group, and Aut(p) is isomorphic to 1(X). Let us reverse this argument. Let N be a normal subgroup of . By the above arguments, this defines a (regular) covering . Let c1 in C be in the fiber of x. Then for every other c2 in the fiber of x, there is precisely one deck transformation that takes c1 to c2. This deck transformation corresponds to a curve g in C connecting c1 to c2. Relations with groupoids One of the ways of expressing the algebraic content of the theory of covering spaces is using groupoids and the fundamental groupoid. The latter functor gives an equivalence of categories :\\\\pi_1: \\\\operatorname{TopCov}(X) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{GpdCov}(\\\\pi_1 X) between the category of covering spaces of a reasonably nice space X and the category of groupoid covering morphisms of 1(X). Thus a particular kind of map of spaces is well modelled by a particular kind of morphism of groupoids. The category of covering morphisms of a groupoid G is also equivalent to the category of actions of G on sets, and this allows the recovery of more traditional classifications of coverings. Relations with classifying spaces and group cohomology If X is a connected cell complex with homotopy groups for all , then the universal covering space T of X is contractible, as follows from applying the Whitehead theorem to T. In this case X is a classifying space or for . Moreover, for every the group of cellular n-chains Cn(T) (that is, a free abelian group with basis given by n-cells in T) also has a natural ZG- module structure. Here for an n-cell œÉ in T and for g in G the cell g œÉ is exactly the translate of œÉ by a covering transformation of T corresponding to g. Moreover, Cn(T) is a free ZG-module with free ZG-basis given by representatives of G-orbits of n-cells in T. In this case the standard topological chain complex : \\\\cdots \\\\overset{\\\\partial}{\\\\to} C_n(T)\\\\overset{\\\\partial}{\\\\to} C_{n-1}(T)\\\\overset{\\\\partial}{\\\\to} \\\\cdots \\\\overset{\\\\partial}{\\\\to} C_0(T)\\\\overset{\\\\varepsilon}{\\\\to} \\\\mathbf Z, where Œµ is the augmentation map, is a free ZG-resolution of Z (where Z is equipped with the trivial ZG-module structure, for every and every ). This resolution can be used to compute group cohomology of G with arbitrary coefficients. The method of Graham Ellis for computing group resolutions and other aspects of homological algebra, as shown in his paper in J. Symbolic Comp. and his web page listed below, is to build a universal cover of a prospective inductively at the same time as a contracting homotopy of this universal cover. It is the latter which gives the computational method. Generalizations As a homotopy theory, the notion of covering spaces works well when the deck transformation group is discrete, or, equivalently, when the space is locally path-connected. However, when the deck transformation group is a topological group whose topology is not discrete, difficulties arise. Some progress has been made for more complex spaces, such as the Hawaiian earring; see the references there for further information. A number of these difficulties are resolved with the notion of semicovering due to Jeremy Brazas, see the paper cited below. Every covering map is a semicovering, but semicoverings satisfy the \\"2 out of 3\\" rule: given a composition of maps of spaces, if two of the maps are semicoverings, then so also is the third. This rule does not hold for coverings, since the composition of covering maps need not be a covering map. Another generalisation is to actions of a group which are not free. Ross Geoghegan in his 1986 review () of two papers by M.A. Armstrong on the fundamental groups of orbit spaces wrote: \\"These two papers show which parts of elementary covering space theory carry over from the free to the nonfree case. This is the kind of basic material that ought to have been in standard textbooks on fundamental groups for the last fifty years.\\" At present, \\"Topology and Groupoids\\" listed below seems to be the only basic topology text to cover such results. Applications Gimbal lock occurs because any map is not a covering map. In particular, the relevant map carries any element of T3, that is, an ordered triple (a,b,c) of angles (real numbers mod 2), to the composition of the three coordinate axis rotations Rx(a)‚àòRy(b)‚àòRz(c) by those angles, respectively. Each of these rotations, and their composition, is an element of the rotation group SO(3), which is topologically RP3. This animation shows a set of three gimbals mounted together to allow three degrees of freedom. When all three gimbals are lined up (in the same plane), the system can only move in two dimensions from this configuration, not three, and is in gimbal lock. In this case it can pitch or yaw, but not roll (rotate in the plane that the axes all lie in). An important practical application of covering spaces occurs in charts on SO(3), the rotation group. This group occurs widely in engineering, due to 3-dimensional rotations being heavily used in navigation, nautical engineering, and aerospace engineering, among many other uses. Topologically, SO(3) is the real projective space RP3, with fundamental group Z/2, and only (non-trivial) covering space the hypersphere S3, which is the group Spin(3), and represented by the unit quaternions. Thus quaternions are a preferred method for representing spatial rotations ‚Äì see quaternions and spatial rotation. However, it is often desirable to represent rotations by a set of three numbers, known as Euler angles (in numerous variants), both because this is conceptually simpler for someone familiar with planar rotation, and because one can build a combination of three gimbals to produce rotations in three dimensions. Topologically this corresponds to a map from the 3-torus T3 of three angles to the real projective space RP3 of rotations, and the resulting map has imperfections due to this map being unable to be a covering map. Specifically, the failure of the map to be a local homeomorphism at certain points is referred to as gimbal lock, and is demonstrated in the animation at the right ‚Äì at some points (when the axes are coplanar) the rank of the map is 2, rather than 3, meaning that only 2 dimensions of rotations can be realized from that point by changing the angles. This causes problems in applications, and is formalized by the notion of a covering space.

He was the first Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate. He was born in Penticton, British Columbia, and raised in the nearby town of Oliver, where his father was a high-school chemistry teacher. Bowering is author of more than 100 books. Bowering is the best-known of a group of young poets including Frank Davey, Fred Wah, Jamie Reid, and David Dawson who studied together at the University of British Columbia in the 1950s. There they founded the journal TISH. Bowering lives in Vancouver, British Columbia and is Professor Emeritus at Simon Fraser University, where he worked for 30 years. Never having written as an adherent of organized religion, he has in the past wryly described himself as a Baptist agnostic. In 2002, Bowering was appointed the first ever Canadian Parliamentary Poet Laureate. That same year, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was awarded the Order of British Columbia in 2004. When the Indian Hungryalist, also known as Hungry generation, poet Malay Roy Choudhury, was arrested at Kolkata, India, Bowering brought out a special issue of Imago for helping the Indian poet in his trial. Bowering was one of the judges for the 2008 Griffin Poetry Prize.

Along with the French scientist Pierre Janssen, he is credited with discovering the gas helium. Lockyer also is remembered for being the founder and first editor of the influential journal Nature. Biography Lockyer was born in Rugby, Warwickshire. His early introduction to science was through his father, who was a pioneer of the electric telegraph. After a conventional schooling supplemented by travel in Switzerland and France, he worked for some years as a civil servant in the British War office. He settled in Wimbledon, South London after marrying Winifred James, who helped translate at least four French scientific works into English. He was a keen amateur astronomer with a particular interest in the Sun. In 1885 he became the world's first professor of astronomical physics at the Royal College of Science, South Kensington, now part of Imperial College. At the college, the Solar Physics Observatory was built for him and here he directed research until 1913. In the 1860s Lockyer became fascinated by electromagnetic spectroscopy as an analytical tool for determining the composition of heavenly bodies. He conducted his research from his new home in West Hampstead, with a 6¬º inch telescope which he had already used in Wimbledon. In 1868 a prominent yellow line was observed in a spectrum taken near the edge of the Sun. With a wavelength of about 588 nm, slightly less than the so-called \\"D\\" lines of sodium. The line could not be explained as due to any material known at the time, and so it was suggested by Lockyer, after he had observed it from London, that the yellow line was caused by an unknown solar element. He named this element helium after the Greek word 'Helios' meaning 'sun'. An observation of the new yellow line had been made earlier by Janssen at the 18 August 1868 solar eclipse, and because their papers reached the French academy on the same day, he and Lockyer usually are awarded joint credit for helium's discovery. Terrestrial helium was found about 27 years later by the Scottish chemist William Ramsay. In his work on the identification of helium, Lockyer collaborated with the noted chemist Edward Frankland. To facilitate the transmission of ideas between scientific disciplines, Lockyer established the general science journal Nature in 1869. He remained its editor until shortly before his death. Lockyer led eight expeditions to observe solar eclipses for example in 1870 to Sicily, 1871 to India and 1898 to India. Lockyer is among the pioneers of archaeoastronomy. Travelling 1890 in Greece he noticed the east‚Äìwest orientation of many temples, in Egypt he found an orientation of temples to sunrise at midsummer and towards Sirius. Assuming orientation of the Heel-Stone of Stonehenge to sunrise at midsummer he calculated the construction of the monument to have taken place in 1680 BC. Radiocarbon dating in 1952 gave a date of 1800 BC. Lockyer's first wife Winifred n√©e James died in 1879. They had six sons and two daughters in all. In 1903, Lockyer started a second marriage, to suffragist Mary Thomasina Brodhurst (n√©e Browne). After his retirement in 1913, Lockyer established an observatory near his home in Salcombe Regis near Sidmouth, Devon. Originally known as the Hill Observatory, the site was renamed the Norman Lockyer Observatory after his death and directed by his fifth son William J.S. Lockyer. For a time the observatory was a part of the University of Exeter, but is now owned by the East Devon District Council, and run by the Norman Lockyer Observatory Society. The Norman Lockyer Chair in Astrophysics at the University of Exeter is currently held by Professor Tim Naylor, who is the member of the Astrophysics group there which studies star formation and extrasolar planets. Naylor was the lead scientist for the eSTAR Project. English Heritage plaque in Penywern Road, Earls Court, London. 1873 illustration of Lockyer.

One line passes through a DSL filter before going to the old demarc, and from there to the remainder of the house. In telephony, the demarcation point is the point at which the public switched telephone network ends and connects with the customer's on-premises wiring. It is the dividing line which determines who is responsible for installation and maintenance of wiring and equipment‚Äîcustomer/subscriber, or telephone company/provider. The demarcation point varies between countries and has changed over time. Demarcation point is sometimes abbreviated as demarc, DMARC, or similar. The term MPOE (minimum or main point of entry) is synonymous, with the added implication that it occurs as soon as possible upon entering the customer premises. A network interface device often serves as the demarcation point. History Prior to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations separating the ownership of customer premises telecommunication equipment from the telephone network, there was no need for a public standard governing the interconnection of customer premises equipment (CPE) to the United States' telephone network, since both the devices and the ‚Äúlocal loop‚Äù wiring to the central office were owned and maintained by the local telephone company. Concurrent with the transfer of existing \\"embedded\\" CPE to the customer (customers could buy new telephones at retail or could continue to lease their existing equipment from the company), it was necessary to provide a standardized way to connect equipment, and also provide a way to test the phone company‚Äôs service separately from the customer‚Äôs equipment. The ability of customers to buy and maintain their CPE and attach it to the network was stimulated by lawsuits by equipment manufacturers, such as the Hush-a-Phone v. FCC suit. Additionally, computer companies‚Äô ability to offer enhanced services to customers was likewise constrained by the telephone companies‚Äô control of all devices connected to the network. As the Bell telephone companies were themselves restricted from offering such enhanced services, there was little momentum to advance the state of the art. The newly developed equipment-network separation was codified in Part 68 of the Code of Federal Regulations in the United States and later in comparable regulatory standards in other countries. The physical and electrical interconnection is called the demarcation point, or Demarc, which includes one or more customer-accessible jack interfaces; previously, the interface was typically hard-wired and often in a telephone company-owned locked enclosure. The premises-vs.-network separation in the United States, insofar as it affected the former Bell System, was independent of AT&T;‚Äôs divestiture of the local telephone companies on January 1, 1984. However, CPE interconnection and Bell System divestiture were part of a larger restructuring of the domestic telecommunications industry which took place during the 1980‚Äôs and are commonly, if inaccurately, seen as one event. The historical Bell System domination of the United States telecommunications industry was also the de facto standard for other telephone companies such as GTE and other ‚Äúindependent‚Äù telephone companies. Equipment =Canada= 20th century Bell Canada demarcation point for a single phone line. The spark- gap surge protectors on the left have hex heads for easy removal. Near center, a post is connected to the house's ground. The other two connection points are for tip and ring. A test jack can be attached nearby so the home-owner or tenant can verify whether the inside wiring is at fault. Modern Bell Canada demarcation points are network interface devices The demarcation point varies from building type and service level. In its simplest form, the demarcation point is a junction block where telephone extensions join to connect to the network. This junction block usually includes a lightning arrester (which requires a wire to ground). In multi-line installations such as businesses or apartment buildings, the demarcation point may be a punch down block. In most places this hardware existed before deregulation. =United States= In the United States, the modern demarcation point is a device defined by FCC rules (47 C.F.R. Part 68) to allow safe connection of third-party telephone customer-premises equipment and wiring to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Two network interface devices. The modern demarcation point is the network interface device (NID) or intelligent network interface device (INID) also known as a \\"smartjack\\". The NID is the telco's property. The NID may be outdoors (typically, mounted on the building exterior in a weatherproof box) or indoors. The NID is usually placed for easy access by a technician. It also contains a lightning arrestor, fuse and test circuitry which allows the carrier to remotely test whether a wiring fault lies in the customer premises or in the carrier wiring, without requiring a technician at the premises. The demarcation point has a user accessible RJ-11 jack (a \\"test jack\\" or \\"demarcation jack\\"), which is connected directly to the telephone network, and a small loop of telephone cord connecting to the jack by a modular connector. When the loop is disconnected, the on-premises wiring is isolated from the telephone network and the customer may directly connect a telephone to the network via the jack to assist in determining the location of a wiring fault. In most cases, everything from the central office to and including the demarcation point is owned by the carrier and everything past it is owned by the property owner. As the local loop becomes upgraded, with fiber optic and coaxial cable technologies sometimes replacing the original unshielded twisted pair to the premises, the demarcation point has grown to incorporate the equipment necessary to interface the original premises POTS wiring and equipment to the new communication channel. Demarcation points on houses built prior to the Bell System divestiture usually do not contain a test jack. They only contained a spark-gap surge protector, a grounding post and mount point to connect a single telephone line. The second wire pair was usually left unconnected and were kept as a spare pair in case the first pair was damaged. DEMARCs that handle both telephony and IT fiber optic internet lines often do not look like the ones pictured above. In many places several customers share one central DEMARC for a commercial or strip mall setting. Usually a DEMARC will be located indoors if it is serving more than a single customer. This may impede access. Outdoor ones provide easier access, without disturbing other tenants, but call for weatherproofing and punching through a wall for each new addition of wires and service. Typically indoor DEMARC's will be easily identified by a patch panel of telephone wires on the wall next to a series of boxes with RJ48 jacks for T-1 lines. Each business or individual customer can expect their own separate box for internet access T-1 lines.  Demarc extension  Demark extension A demarcation point extension, or demarc extension is the transmission path originating from the interface of the access provider's side of a demarcation point within a premises and ending at the termination point prior to the interface of the edge Customer Premises Equipment (CPE). This may include in-segment equipment, media converters and patch cords as required to complete the circuit's transmission path to the edge CPE. A demarc extension is more correctly termed \\"Service Interface Extension\\", and may also be referred to as inside wiring, extended demarc, circuit extension, CPE cabling, riser cabling or DMARC extension. A demarc extension became an important factor to consider in a building's telecommunications infrastructure after the 1984 deregulation of AT&T; as well as the supplemental FCC rulings of 1991, 1996 and 1997. Preceding these rulings, the Bell System Companies held a monopoly and did not allow an interconnection with third party equipment. The incumbent local exchange carriers (ILEC) and other local access providers are now mandated by federal law to provide a point where the operational control or ownership changes. This separation between the local access provider and the end user/subscriber is called the demarcation point within a facility (typically a short distance from the minimum point of entry). This then becomes the responsibility of the end user to extend their service to the CPE location within a facility to provide connectivity for service, requiring a service interface extension, or otherwise called a demarc extension. = United Kingdom = A British Telecom NTE5 master socket, showing the removable front plate and test socket. In the United Kingdom, the demarcation point occurs on the LJU master socket, whose wiring is partly owned by the customer, partly owned by the phone company. Other secondary sockets are the customer's property. Newer NTE-5 master phone sockets have a removable front panel: the front panel and its wiring is the customer's, while the rear wiring is Openreach's. The removable panel allows separation of these two parts and independent maintenance, and access to a test socket to determine whether line faults are in the customer's wiring or Openreach's (formerly BT's) external network.

The fort was named after Confederate general Daniel S. Donelson.The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture: Fort Donelson. Retrieved 2012-08-03. The Union Army of the Tennessee, commanded by Major General Ulysses S. Grant, captured the fort from the Confederate Army in the Battle of Fort Donelson in February 1862. The capture of the fort resulted in an enormous strategic victory for the Union forces. Union forces occupied the fort for the remainder of the war. A small detachment of Confederate troops made one unsuccessful attempt to regain it. History Bushrod Johnson of the Confederate Corps of Engineers had approved the build site and supervised construction in 1862. The site commanded a bend on the west side of the Cumberland River opposite Fort Henry which is located on a bend in the Tennessee River about 10 miles west. To the north flows Hickman River, a backwater channel that was impassable except by boat or bridge, and to the east a small tributary named Indian Creek. The fort, which was meant to house troops and protect the water batteries from sorties, had a few acres of log huts. Like Fort Henry, which had fallen to Union troops on February 6, Fort Donelson would not be able to defeat a large scale assault but officers wanted to hold the position as long as possible. Engineers began improving defensive positions by digging rifle pits along a ridgeline and breastworks were built in \\"a three-mile arc which inclosed the bluff on the north, and the countryseat hamlet of Dover on the south, the main supply base.\\" Cannons including a 128-pounder and two 32-pounders were placed atop the hundred foot bluff within the arc.

(see Battle of Fort Donelson) The fort was attacked again on August 25, 1863, by a Confederate force demanding its surrender. The attack was unsuccessful and was repulsed. =The Union Attack= Grant's headquarters at Fort Donelson Fort Donelson was attacked by General U.S Grant and Flag Officer Andrew Foote, who surrounded the fort and captured it after a short siege. On February 6, Grant was ordered by General Henry Halleck to assault Fort Donelson immediately and capture it by February 8. Grant made reconnaissance, observed the natural obstacles and Confederate improvements, and knew the fort would not be taken by the 8th. He organized and had Brigadier Generals John A. McClernand, Charles F. Smith, and Lew Wallace prepare for a land assault while Flag Officer Foote moved his gunboats to assault from the river. After minor skirmishes with Confederate cavalry en route, the assault on Fort Donelson began on 12 February. On 14 February, a naval battle took place with Union ships suffering serious damage. After attempting in vain to escape their tenuous position on February 15 via roads to Nashville the Confederates capitulated, surrendering Fort Donelson to the Union on February 16. =Fort Donelson under Union control= Map showing Fort Donelson and surrounding area during capture, with location of McClernand's headquarters, field guns, camp locations, earth works and town of Dover south of fort, along with several notations by military engineers The Union was ecstatic when the news of Fort Donelson's surrender reached the capital and cities. Union forces now controlled one of the largest forts in the western theater. The war had been going badly for the Union in Virginia, but the captures of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson were promising victories. After the front line shifted away from Fort Donelson, it became of little strategic importance, but continued to hold a garrison of Union troops. Later, the fort was attacked by a Confederate force of 450 infantrymen, 335 cavalrymen, and two field guns. The Union garrison consisted of four companies (404 men) of the 71st Ohio Regiment. After suffering 30 casualties, the Confederates retreated. They were pursued by the Fifth Iowa Cavalry, but to no avail. Union commanders * Ulysses S.

Siddall was an important and influential artist and poet. Significant collections of her artworks can be found at Wightwick Manor and the Ashmolean. Siddall was painted and drawn extensively by artists of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, including Walter Deverell, William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais (including his notable 1852 painting Ophelia), and her husband, Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Early life Elizabeth Eleanor Siddall, named after her mother, was born on 25 July 1829, at the family's home at 7 Charles Street, Hatton Garden. Her parents were Charles Crooke Siddall, and Elizabeth Eleanor Evans, from a family of English and Welsh descent. At the time of her birth, her father had a cutlery-making business, but around 1831, her family moved to the borough of Southwark, in south London, a less salubrious area than Hatton Garden. The rest of Siddall's siblings were born in Southwark; Lydia, to whom she was particularly close; Mary, Clara, James and Henry. Although there is no record of Elizabeth Siddall having attended school, she could read and write, presumably having been taught by her parents. She developed a love of poetry at a young age, after discovering a poem by Tennyson, which served as inspiration to start writing her own poems. Model for the Pre-Raphaelites Siddall showed her own drawings to Walter Deverell's father in 1849, while she was working at a dressmakers and millinery shop in Cranbourne Alley, London. Deverell's father suggested that she should model for Walter. She was employed as a model by Deverell and through him was introduced to the Pre-Raphaelites. Though she was later touted for her beauty, Siddall was originally chosen as a model because of her plainness. At the time, Deverell was working on a large oil painting depicting a scene from Twelfth Night, showing Orsino, Feste, and Viola as Cesario. Like the rest of the Pre-Raphaelites, Deverell took his inspiration and forms from life rather than from an idealized or antique figure. He based his Orsino on himself, Feste on his friend Dante Rossetti. This was the first painting for which Siddall sat. Elizabeth Siddall was the model for Sir John Everett Millais's 1851‚Äì52 Ophelia While posing for Millais's Ophelia in 1852, Siddall floated in a bathtub full of water to represent the drowning Ophelia. Millais painted daily into the winter putting oil lamps under the tub to warm the water. On one occasion the lamps went out and the water became icy cold. Millais, absorbed by his painting, did not notice and Siddall did not complain. After this she became very ill with a severe cold or pneumonia. Her father held Millais responsible and, under the threat of legal action, Millais paid her doctor's bills. Elizabeth Siddall was the primary model and muse for Dante Gabriel Rossetti throughout most of his youth. Rossetti met her in 1849, when she was modelling for Deverell. By 1851, she was sitting for Rossetti and he began to paint her to the exclusion of almost all other models. Rossetti also stopped her from modelling for the other Pre-Raphaelites. The number of paintings and drawings he did of her are said to number in the thousands.. Perhaps best known among Rossetti's works from Siddall is Beata Beatrix, which depicts a praying Beatrice (from Dante Alighieri) and was painted in 1863, a year after Siddall's death.  Work  Elizabeth Siddall, Lady Clare, 1857. Watercolour on paper, 33.8 x 25.4 cm. Private collection. In 1852, Siddall began to study with Rossetti. She also painted a self-portrait, which differs from the idealised beauty portrayed by the Pre-Raphaelites. In 1855, art critic John Ruskin began to subsidise her career and paid ¬£150 per year in exchange for all the drawings and paintings she produced. She produced many sketches, drawings, and watercolours as well as one oil painting. Her sketches are laid out in a fashion similar to Pre- Raphaelite compositions illustrating Arthurian legend and other idealized medieval themes, and she exhibited with the Pre-Raphaelites at the summer exhibition at Russell Place in 1857. During this period Siddall also began to write poetry, often with dark themes about lost love or the impossibility of true love. \\"Her verses were as simple and moving as ancient ballads; her drawings were as genuine in their medieval spirit as much more highly finished and competent works of Pre-Raphaelite art,\\" wrote critic William Gaunt. Both Rossetti and Ford Madox Brown supported and admired her work. A 2018 exhibition, entitled \\"Beyond Ophelia\\" and curated by National Trust Assistant Curator Hannah Squire, ran at Wightwick Manor and featured 12 artworks created by Siddall and owned by the National Trust. Only the second solo exhibition of her work (the first was curated by Dr. Jan Marsh at the Ruskin Gallery, Sheffield in 1991), the exhibition examined Siddall's career, artistic style, subject matter, and the prejudice she faced as a female artist, whilst also examining the Manders of Wightwick as pioneering collectors: Rosalie Glynn Grylls and Geoffrey Mander paid a record sum for her work in the 1960s and gave it to the National Trust.

Marriage to Rossetti and Relationship with Rossetti's Family Siddall and Rossetti were married on Wednesday, 23 May 1860 at St. Clement's Church in the seaside town of Hastings. There were no family or friends present, just a couple of witnesses whom they had asked in Hastings. Beginning in 1853 with a watercolour The First Anniversary of the Death of Beatrice, Siddall sat for many of Rossetti's works. After this work, Rossetti used Siddall in other Dante-related pieces, including Dante's Vision of Rachel and Leah (1855), Beatrice Meeting Dante at a Marriage Feast, Denies him her Salutation (1851), and Beata Beatrix (1864‚Äì70), which he painted as a memorial after her death. Perhaps Rossetti's most abundant and personal works were pencil sketches of Siddall at home, which he began in 1852 when she moved into Chatham Place with him. Elizabeth Siddall in an 1854 self-portrait Dante Gabriel Rossetti completed Beata Beatrix a year after Siddall's death An 1852 drawing by Rossetti of Siddall painting When the two moved in together, they became increasingly anti-social and absorbed in each other's affections. The lovers coined affectionate nicknames for one another, which included \\"Guggums\\" or \\"Gug\\" and \\"Dove\\" ‚Äì one of Rossetti's names for Siddall. He also changed the spelling of her name to Siddal, dropping the second 'l'. Siddall was repeatedly idealized in Rossetti's sketches, most of which he entitled simply \\"Elizabeth Siddal.\\" In these sketches, Siddall was portrayed as a woman of leisure, class, and beauty, often situated in comfortable settings. Rossetti's poem A Last Confession exemplifies his love for Siddall, whom he personifies as the heroine with eyes \\"as of the sea and sky on a grey day.\\" Regina Cordium‚ÄîRossetti's 1860 marriage portrait of Siddall Another famous portrait of Siddall produced by Rossetti towards the end of their marriage was Regina Cordium or The Queen of Hearts (1860). Painted as a marriage portrait, this painting shows a close-up, vibrantly coloured depiction of Siddall. As Siddall came from a working-class family, Rossetti feared introducing her to his parents. Siddall was the victim of harsh criticism from his sisters. Knowledge that his family would not approve the marriage contributed to Rossetti putting it off. Siddall appears to have believed, with some justification, that Rossetti was always seeking to replace her with a younger muse, which contributed to her later depressive periods and illness. Seven years after his wife's death, Rossetti published a collection of sonnets entitled The House of Life; contained within it was the poem, \\"Without Her.\\" It is a reflection on life once love has departed: Ill-health and death Siddall travelled to Paris and Nice for several years for her health. At the time of her wedding, she was so frail and ill that she had to be carried to the church, despite it being a five-minute walk from where she was staying. It was thought that she suffered from tuberculosis, but some historians believe an intestinal disorder was more likely. Others have suggested she might have been anorexic while others attribute her poor health to an addiction to laudanum or a combination of ailments. She became severely depressed and her long illness gave her access to laudanum to which she became addicted. In 1861, Siddall became pregnant, which ended with the birth of a stillborn daughter. The death of her child left Siddall with a post-partum depression. She became pregnant for a second time in late 1861. Siddall overdosed on laudanum in February 1862. Rossetti discovered her unconscious and lying in bed after having had dinner with her and his friend Algernon Charles Swinburne. After having taken Siddall home, Rossetti attended his usual teaching job at the Working Men's College. Once Rossetti returned home from teaching, he found Siddall unconscious and was unable to revive her. The first doctor Rossetti called claimed to be unable to save her, upon which Rossetti sent for another three doctors. A stomach pump was used, but to no avail. She died at 7.20 a.m. on 11 February 1862 at their home at 14 Chatham Place, now demolished and covered by Blackfriars Station. Although her death was ruled accidental by the coroner, there are suggestions that Rossetti found a suicide note, with the words \\"Please look after Harry\\" (her invalid brother, who may have had a slight intellectual disability), supposedly \\"pinned ... on the breast of her night- shirt.\\" Consumed with grief and guilt Rossetti went to see Ford Madox Brown who is supposed to have instructed him to burn the note, since suicide was illegal, immoral, would have brought scandal on the family and barred Siddall from a Christian burial. In fiction, drama, and song One of three surviving leaves from the book of poetry buried with Elizabeth Siddall. Praise and prayer: manuscript, before 1862. MS Eng 769. Houghton Library, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA Rossetti's relationship with Siddall has been the subject of television dramas, notably Dante's Inferno (1967), by Ken Russell, in which she was played by Judith Paris and Rossetti by Oliver Reed; The Love School (1975) in which she was played by Patricia Quinn; and Desperate Romantics (2009) in which she was played by Amy Manson. Mollie Hardwick (author of Upstairs, Downstairs) wrote a mystery novel entitled The Dreaming Damozel in 1990.. The plot follows antique dealer Doran Fairweather, who is elated to find a small oil painting she believes to be of Elizabeth Siddall but is shocked when she happens on the body of a girl, floating dead in a pond. The death scene mimics the Millais painting of Ophelia featuring Elizabeth Siddall. Doran' excited by the coincidence and mystery, ignores the advice of her husband who warns her the story of Rossetti and Siddall was plagued by unhappiness.Hardwick, Mollie (1990). The Dreaming Damozel In Tim Powers' 2012 novel Hide Me Among the Graves, Siddall is a victim of the vampire John Polidori, her husband's uncle and author of what is likely the first vampire story. This becomes an explanation for her illness and death, as well as for her husband's exhumation of her grave, which is not to regain his poems but is part of a strategy to defeat the vampire.Powers, Tim (2012). Hide Me Amongst the Graves Ghostland is a 2001 album by the Seattle neo- psychedelic band The Goblin Market named after a poem by Christina Rossetti, and the album is inspired by the exhumation of Elizabeth Siddall. Elizabeth Siddall, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and Algernon Charles Swinburne are the subjects of the short comics story How They Met Themselves, by Neil Gaiman, drawn by Michael Zulli, and published in Vertigo: Winter's Edge #3 (2000). The title makes reference to the Rossetti's 1864 painting. In it, a dying Elizabeth drugged with laudanum revives the last New Year's Day, in which the trio had a train trip to a magic forest owned by Desire, the androgynous sibling of Sandman.. Lizzie Siddal, a play written by Jeremy Green, was performed at the Arcola Theatre, London in 2013.. Ophelia's Muse, a work of art historical fiction by Rita Cameron that was published in September 2015 by Kensington Press, tells the story of Siddall and the Pre-Raphelites. Sleep, Pale Sister, a Gothic novel set in the Victorian art world by the author Joanne Harris, draws heavily on the character of Siddall and her relationship with Rossetti, and Fiona Mountain's 2002 mystery novel, Pale as the Dead centres a \\"genealogical mystery\\" around the fictional descendants of Elizabeth Siddall and Dante Gabriel Rossetti.

It is located mostly on the island of S√£o Vicente, which harbors both the city of Santos and the city of S√£o Vicente, and partially on the mainland. It is the main city in the metropolitan region of Baixada Santista.Assembleia Legislativa do Estado de S√£o Paulo, Lei Complementar N¬∫ 815 The population is 433,966 (2015 est.) in an area of .Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estat√≠stica The city is also home to the Coffee Museum, where world coffee prices were once negotiated. There is also an association football memorial, dedicated to the city's greatest players, which includes Pel√©, who played for the Santos Futebol Clube. Its beachfront garden, in length, figures in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest beachfront garden in the world. History The export of coffee from the Port of Santos gave rise to the city and mostly accounted for the wealth of the city at the turn of the 20th century. Export and import through its port have made it the modern city one finds today and turned it into the indispensable outlet for the production of the powerhouse that is S√£o Paulo State. Adorning the landscape of the port city are the canals that are over a hundred years old. In 1899, Santos was the point of entry for the bubonic plague into Brazil. In 1924 it became the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Santos. In October 2006, light crude oil was discovered off the coast in the Santos basin. Santos became a tourist city from the 1910s onwards, with the construction of the International Hotel and Parque Balne√°rio and the construction of the beach front gardens in 1935. Until today, tourism in Santos is one of the main economic activities, mainly linked to beaches and historical heritage. Geography Santos is about 31 km (19 mi) from the metropolis S√£o Paulo, capital of the state S√£o Paulo, which is also the most populous city in Brazil. The municipality contains the Laje de Santos Marine State Park, created in 1993, the first marine park to be created by the state. It is divided into two distinct geographic areas: the heavily urbanized island and the continental area, about 70% of which is protected. The areas differ radically in terms of population, economy and geography. Santos =Insular area= Santos partially lies on the island of S√£o Vicente (Saint Vincent), whose territory is divided with the neighboring municipality of S√£o Vicente. It is a densely urbanized area of that houses almost all the inhabitants of the city. It includes a flat area - Plain Coastal extension of the State of S√£o Paulo - which has altitudes that rarely go above twenty meters above sea level, and an area composed of isolated hills called the Mass of S√£o Vicente, the former home and endowed an urban illegal occupation with a mix of families characterized by high and low incomes, whose height does not exceed 200 meters above sea level. The flat region of the island is almost completely devoid of native vegetation, although in the north region of the island - especially in the Alemoa, Chico de Paula and Sabo√≥ neighbourhoods - there are still remnants of mangroves. Before the occupation of the area of the island by 'ch√°caras' - rural residences, and subsequently by urbanization, there was a vast flooded land covered by mangroves, the native Atlantic Forest, and coastal vegetation. On the city hills one can still find vast areas covered by the native Atlantic Forest, in spite of the existing ch√°caras and banana harvesting farms in the area. The 'Lagoa da Saudade' (Homesickness Lagoon), a pond located in one of the aforementioned hills, Morro Nova Cintra, was known to host a kind of caiman. The lagoon is also a popular destination among families in the city due to its playgrounds, barbecue kiosks, picnic spots and green areas. The disordered occupation of the hills represents both an environmental as well as a geological risk: the deforestation leads to frequent landslides, mainly from January to March, the traditional rainy season in the region. Most rivers in the island were channeled when engineer Saturnino de Brito designed the system of canals in the city. As examples, we can cite the rivers Dois Rios (\\"Two Rivers\\") and Ribeir√£o dos Soldados (\\"Soldiers Creek\\"), which is nowadays referred by santistas as the 'Canal 4' on Avenue Siqueira Campos. Major water courses cut the island in the north, such as the Rio de S√£o Jorge (St. George River), which suffers from the problems of pollution and silting due to the occupation of its banks by slums. =Climate= Despite the fact that it is located just outside the tropics, Santos has a tropical rainforest climate with no real dry season. Tropical rainforest climates are typically found near the equator, so Santos featuring this type of climate is an exceptional situation. All months of the year averages more than 60 mm of rainfall during the course of the year. Santos features warm weather throughout the year, though June in Santos is somewhat cooler (and drier) than January. The average temperature in the city during the month of June is 23 ¬∞C, while the average temperature in January is 28 ¬∞C. Precipitation in Santos is very high, amounting to annually. Santos lies in one of the few isolated regions of Brazil outside of the tropical Amazon Basin that receive more than of total average precipitation annually, although nearby Ubatuba, approximately to the east-northeast, is considerably wetter than Santos, receiving an average of of precipitation annually.

Founded in 1900, it is one of the oldest standardising laboratories in the world. Today, it is one of the most extensive government laboratories in the UK and has a \\"prestigious\\" reputation for its role in setting and maintaining physical standards for British industry. The heads of NPL have included many individuals who were pillars of the British scientific establishment. Research work at NPL has contributed to the advancement of many disciplines of science, including the development of atomic clocks as well as packet switching, which is today one of the fundamental technologies of the Internet. NPL is based at Bushy Park in Teddington, England. It comes under the management of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. History The Electricity Division of the National Physical Laboratory in 1944 The National Physical Laboratory was established in 1900 at Bushy House \\"to bring scientific knowledge to bear practically upon our everyday industrial and commercial life\\". It grew to fill a large selection of buildings on the Teddington site. NPL procured a large state-of-the-art laboratory under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 1998. The construction, which was being undertaken by John Laing, and the maintenance of this new building, which was being undertaken by Serco, was transferred back to the DTI in 2004 after the private sector companies involved made losses of over ¬£100m. The laboratory was initially run by the UK government, with members of staff being part of the civil service. Administration of NPL was contracted out in 1995 under a Government Owned Contractor Operated model, with Serco winning the bid and all staff transferred to their employ. Under this regime, overhead costs halved, third party revenues grew by 16% per annum, and the number of peer-reviewed research papers published doubled.Labs under the microscope ‚Äì Ethos. Ethosjournal.com (2 February 2012). Retrieved on 12 April 2014. It was decided in 2012 to change the operating model for NPL from 2014 onward to include academic partners and to establish a postgraduate teaching institute on site. The date of the changeover was later postponed for up to a year. The candidates for lead academic partner were the Universities of Edinburgh, Southampton, Strathclyde and Surrey with an alliance of the Universities of Strathclyde and Surrey chosen as preferred partners. In January 2013 funding for a new ¬£25m Advanced Metrology Laboratory was announced that will be built on the footprint of an existing unused building. The operation of the laboratory transferred back to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (now the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy) ownership on 1 January 2015.Future operation of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). Retrieved 24 March 2015 Notable researchers Robert Watson-Watt Researchers who have worked at NPL include: D. W. Dye who did important work in developing the technology of quartz clocks. The inventor Sir Barnes Wallis did early development work there on the \\"Bouncing Bomb\\" used in the \\"Dam Busters\\" wartime raids.Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society H.J. Gough, one of the pioneers of research into metal fatigue, worked at NPL for 19 years from 1914 to 1938. Sydney Goldstein and Sir James Lighthill worked in NPL's aerodynamics division during World War II researching boundary layer theory and supersonic aerodynamics respectively. Alan Turing, known for his work at the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS;) at Bletchley Park during the Second World War to decipher German encrypted messages, worked at the National Physical Laboratory from 1945 to 1947. He designed there the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine), which was one of the first designs for a stored-program computer. Dr Clifford Hodge also worked there and was engaged in research on semiconductors. Others who have spent time at NPL include Robert Watson-Watt, generally considered the inventor of radar, Oswald Kubaschewski, the father of computational materials thermodynamics and the numerical analyst James Wilkinson. Research NPL research has contributed to physical science, materials science, computing, and bioscience. Applications have been found in ship design, aircraft development, radar, computer networking, and global positioning. =Atomic clocks= Louis Essen The first accurate atomic clock, a caesium standard based on a certain transition of the caesium-133 atom, was built by Louis Essen and Jack Parry in 1955 at NPL. Calibration of the caesium standard atomic clock was carried out by the use of the astronomical time scale ephemeris time (ET). This led to the internationally agreed definition of the latest SI second being based on atomic time. =Computing= NPL has undertaken computer research since the mid-1940s. From 1945, Alan Turing led the design of the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) computer. The ACE project was overambitious and floundered, leading to Turing's departure. Donald Davies took the project over and concentrated on delivering the less ambitious Pilot ACE computer, which first worked in May 1950. Among those who worked on the project was American computer pioneer Harry Huskey. A commercial spin-off, DEUCE was manufactured by English Electric Computers and became one of the best-selling machines of the 1950s. = Metrology = The National Physical Laboratory is involved with new developments in metrology, such as researching metrology for, and standardising, nanotechnology. It is mainly based at the Teddington site, but also has a site in Huddersfield for dimensional metrology and an underwater acoustics facility at Wraysbury Reservoir. =Packet switching= Beginning in the mid-1960s, Donald Davies and his team at the NPL pioneered packet switching, now the dominant basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide. Davies designed and proposed a national data network based on packet switching in his 1965 Proposal for the Development of a National Communications Service for On-line Data Processing. Subsequently, the NPL team (Davies, Derek Barber, Roger Scantlebury, Peter Wilkinson, Keith Bartlett, and Brian Aldous) developed the concept into a local area network which operated from 1969 to 1986, and carried out work to analyse and simulate the performance of packet-switched networks, including datagram networks. Their research and practice influenced the ARPANET in the United States, the forerunner of the Internet, and other researchers in the UK and Europe. NPL was also involved in internetworking research. Davies, Scantlebury and Barber were members of the International Networking Working Group (INWG) which developed a protocol for internetworking. Connecting existing networks creates a \\"basic dilemma\\" since a common host protocol would require restructuring the existing networks. NPL connected with the European Informatics Network (Barber directed the project and Scantlebury led the UK technical contribution)Communications Standards: State of the Art Report 14:3 by translating between two different host protocols; that is, using a gateway. Concurrently, the NPL connection to the Post Office Experimental Packet Switched Service used a common host protocol in both networks.

Glenn Hinson, The Church Triumphant: A History of Christianity Up to 1300, (Mercer University Press, 1995), 387. Pope Urban's speech on November 27 included the call to arms that would result in the First Crusade, and eventually the capture of Jerusalem and the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In this, Urban reacted to the request by Byzantine emperor Alexius I Comnenus who had sent envoys to the Council of Piacenza requesting military assistance against the Seljuk Turks.Helen J. Nicholson, The Crusades, (Greenwood Publishing, 2004), 6. Several accounts of the speech survive; of these, the one by Fulcher of Chartres, who was present at the council, is generally accepted as the most reliable. Urban also discussed Cluniac reforms of the Church, and also extended the excommunication of Philip I of France for his adulterous remarriage to Bertrade of Montfort. The council also declared a renewal of the Truce of God, an attempt on the part of the church to reduce feuding among Frankish nobles. Participants The council was attended by about 300 clerics. No official list of the participants or of the signatories to the decrees of the Council survives. A partial list of some of the attendees can nonetheless be constructed.A contemporary pamphlet (libellus), complaining about the injustices done to the abbey of Majoris-Monasterii, included a narration of their appeal to the Pope in the Council.

The five versions of the speech vary widely in their details, and especially those of Baldric and Guibert, both of whom were not present at the council, are certainly colored by later events. The account by Fulcher, who is known to have been present at the council, is generally considered the most reliable version.Georg Strack, The sermon of Urban II in Clermont 1095 and the Tradition of Papal Oratory, in: Medieval Sermon Studies 56 (2012), 30-45\\\\. (uni-muenchen.de). Urban's own letter, written in December 1095 and addressed to the faithful \\"waiting in Flanders,\\" does lament that \\"a barbaric fury has deplorably afflicted and laid waste the churches of God in the regions of the Orient\\". Urban does allude to Jerusalem, saying that this barbaric fury has \\"even grasped in intolerable servitude its churches and the Holy City of Christ, glorified by His passion and resurrection\\". He calls upon the princes to \\"free the churches of the East\\", appointing Adhemar of Le Puy as the leader of the expedition, to set out on the day of the Assumption of Mary (15 August 1096).August. C. Krey, The First Crusade: The Accounts of Eyewitnesses and Participants, Princeton (1921), 42-43\\\\. The Gesta Francorum does not give an account of the speech at any length, it merely mentions that Urban called upon all to \\"take up the way of the Lord\\" and be prepared to suffer much, assured of their reward in heaven. It goes on to emphasize how news of Urban's call to arms quickly spread by word of mouth \\"through all the regions and countries of Gaul, the Franks, upon hearing such reports, forthwith caused crosses to be sewed on their right shoulders, saying that they followed with one accord the footsteps of Christ, by which they had been redeemed from the hand of hell.\\"August. C. Krey, The First Crusade: The Accounts of Eyewitnesses and Participants, Princeton (1921), 28-30\\\\. Rosalind M. Hill, ed. and trans., Gesta francorum et aliorum Hierosolymitanorum: The Deeds of the Franks (London: 1962). =Fulcher= Fulcher of Chartres was present at the speech, and recorded it in Gesta Francorum Jerusalem Expugnantium. He was writing from memory a few years later (c. 1100-1105).Historia Hierosolymitana: Mit Erl√§uterungen und einem Anhange, ed. by Heinrich Hagenmeyer (Heidelberg: Winter, 1913), pp. 44‚Äì45.; translation: A History of the Expedition to Jerusalem: 1095‚Äì1127, trans. by Frances R. Ryan, ed. by Harold S. Fink (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), pp. 19‚Äì20. He asserts, in his prologue, that he is recording only such events as he had seen with his own eyes, and his record is phrased in a way consistent with the style of oration known from papal speeches in the 11th century.Starck (2012): \\"only the version reported by Fulcher of Chartres corresponds to a sort of oratory common to papal speeches in the eleventh century\\" Georg Strack, \\"The Sermon of Urban II in Clermont and the Tradition of Papal Oratory\\", Medieval Sermon Studies 56 (2012), 30‚Äì45, DOI 10.1179/1366069112Z.0000000002 (uni-muenchen.de) In Fulcher's text, Urban begins by reminding the clergy present that they are shepherds, and that they must be vigilant and avoid carelessness and corruption. He reminds them to refrain from simony and to adhere to the laws of the church. Urban complains about the lack of justice and public order in the Frankish provinces and calls for the re-establishment of the truce protecting clergy from violence. In the Historiography of the Crusades, there is a long-standing argument as to how much the pacification of the Frankish realm was designed to go hand in hand with the \\"export of violence\\" to the enemy in the east. Fulcher reports that everyone present agreed to the pope's propositions and promised to adhere to the church's decrees. Then, after this and other matters had been attended to, Urban spoke about the suffering of Christianity in another part of the world. In this second part of his speech, Urban urges the Frankish Christians that once they have re-established peace and righteousness in their own land, they should turn their attention to the East and bring aid to the Christians there, as the Turks Hagenmeier (1913:133f.): some manuscripts have Turci et Arabes \\"the Turks and Arabs\\", but Hagenmeier prefers Turci, gens Persica as an ememdation by Fulcher in his second redaction of the text, as it was well known to him that only the Turks, but not the Arabs, had advanced \\"as far as the Mediterranean\\", and Fulcher is elsewhere punctilious in distinguishing Turks on one hand from Arabs or Saracens on the other. had attacked them and had recently conquered the territory of Romania (i.e. Byzantine Anatolia) as far west as the Mediterranean, the part known as the \\"Arm of Saint George\\" (the Sea of Marmara),Fulcheri Carnotensis Historia Hierosolymitana 1.3.3, ed. Hagenmeier (1913), p. 133. killing and capturing many Christians and destroying churches and devastating the kingdom of God.regunum Dei vastando; some mss. instead read regnum quoque vastando, \\"and devastating the realm\\" (Hagenmeier 1913:134). In order to avoid further loss of territory and even more widespread attacks on Christians, Urban calls on the clergy present to publish his call to arms everywhere, and persuade all people of whatever rank, both nobles and commoners, to go to the aid of the Christians currently under attack. Concluding his call to arms with \\"Christ commands it\\" (Christus autem imperat),Fulcheri Carnotensis Historia Hierosolymitana 1.3.5, ed. Hagenmeier (1913), p. 135. Urban defines the crusade both as a defensive just war and as a religious holy war.Starck (2012:33) Urban goes on to promise immediate absolution to all who die either on the way or in battle against the infidels. He then connects his call to arms with his previous call for peace in Gaul: \\"Let those who have been accustomed unjustly to wage private warfare against the faithful now go against the infidels and end with victory this war which should have been begun long ago. Let those who for a long time, have been robbers, now become knights. Let those who have been fighting against their brothers and relatives now fight in a proper way against the barbarians. Let those who have been serving as mercenaries for small pay now obtain the eternal reward. Let those who have been wearing themselves out in both body and soul now work for a double honor.\\"Bongars, Gesta Dei per Francos, 1, 382 f., trans. in: Oliver J. Thatcher and Edgar Holmes McNeal (eds.), A Source Book for Medieval History, New York: Scribners (1905), 513-517 fordham.edu =Robert= Some historians prefer the version of the speech reported by Robert the Monk in his Historia Iherosolimitana, written in 1107.Starck (2012:34) Robert gives a more vivid account, consisting both of a more elaborate sermon and the \\"dramatic response\\" of the audience, bursting into spontaneous cries of Deus vult.Philippe Le Bas (ed.), Historia Iherosolimitana, Recueil des Historiens des Croisades: Historiens Occidentaux vol. 3, Paris: Imprimerie Royale (1866), p. 729. In Robert's version, Urban calls the \\"race of the Franks\\" to Christian orthodoxy, reform and submission to the Church and to come to the aid of the Greek Christians in the east. As in Fulcher's account, Urban promises remission of sins for those who went to the east.The 'Liber Lamberti', a source based on the notes of Bishop Lambert of Arras, who attended the Council, indicates that Urban offered the remission of all penance due from sins, what later came to be called an indulgence. http://falcon.arts.cornell.edu/prh3/259/texts/clermont.html Robert's account of Urban's speech has the rhetoric of a dramatic \\"battle speech\\". Urban here emphasizes reconquering the Holy Land more than aiding the Greeks, an aspect lacking in Fulcher's version and considered by many historians an insertion informed by the success of the First Crusade. Both Robert's and Fulcher's account of the speech include a description of the terrible plight of the Christians in the East under the recent conquests of the Turks and the promise of remission of sins for those who go to their aid. Robert's version, however, includes a more vivid description of the atrocities committed by the conquerors, describing the desecration of churches, the forced circumcision, beheading and torture by disemboweling of Christian men and alluding to grievous rape of Christian women. Dana C. Munro, \\"Urban and the Crusaders\\", Translations and Reprints from the Original Sources of European History, Vol 1:2, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania (1895), 5-8 (fordham.edu) Perhaps with the wisdom of hindsight, Robert makes Urban advise that none but knights should go, not the old and feeble, nor priests without the permission of their bishops, \\"for such are more of a hindrance than aid, more of a burden than advantage... nor ought women to set out at all, without their husbands or brothers or legal guardians.\\" =Other versions= About the same time, Baldric, archbishop of Dol, also basing his account generally on Gesta Francorum, reported an emotional sermon focusing on the offenses of the Muslims and the reconquest of the Holy Land in terms likely to appeal to chivalry. Like Fulcher he also recorded that Urban deplored the violence of the Christian knights of Gaul. \\"It is less wicked to brandish your sword against Saracens,\\" Baldric's Urban cries, comparing them to the Amalekites. The violence of knights he wanted to see ennobled in the service of Christ, defending the churches of the East as if defending a mother. Baldric asserts that Urban, there on the spot, appointed the bishop of Puy to lead the crusade. Guibert, abbot of Nogent in his Dei gesta per Francos (1107/8) also made that Urban emphasize the reconquest of the Holy Land more than help to the Greeks or other Christians there. This emphasis may, as in the case of Robert and Baldric, be due to the influence account of the reconquest of Jerusalem in the Gesta Francorum. Urban's speech in Guibert's version, emphasizes the sanctity of the Holy Land, which must be in Christian possession so that prophecies about the end of the world could be fulfilled.

Theoretical background  Heyerdahl's intention was to prove the veracity of the account of Snorri Sturluson in the Ynglinga saga, written in the 13th century, about the origin of the Norse royal dynasties, and the pre-Christian Norse gods. Snorri provides a euhemeristic account, in which he describes the Norse god Odin and some other Norse gods, the √Üsir, as having been real people who emigrated from the area around the river Don to Scandinavia at the time of the Roman expansion into their old homeland. In Scandinavia, Snorri writes, they so impressed the native population that they started worshipping them as gods. Heyerdahl tried to seek the origins of the √Üsir, following the route set out by Snorri Sturluson in the Ynglinga saga, from the Black Sea and the river Tanais (referred to by Snorri Sturluson by the names Tana√≠s and Tanakv√≠slWikiheimild: Heimskringla - Ynglinga saga: 1. H√©r segir fr√° landaskipan) via Saxon homelands in northern Germany, Odense on Fyn, Denmark to Old Sigtuna, ancient Sweden. When Heyerdahl died in 2002 the second season of excavations had just been finished.  Critique  Heyerdahl's Odin project was subjected to fierce criticism from Norwegian academics within the fields of research upon which the theory touches. Both the first book detailing the Odin project, Ingen grenser from 1999, and the second book, Jakten p√• Odin from 2001, were met with a forceful and detailed response from leading academics in which the reasons were laid out to the wider public as to why Heyerdahl's theory in their view was false. After the last book the attacks against Heyerdahl were also worded in a way that was seen by many as disrespectful.\\"[...]mange har oppfattet den som nedsettende\\", one of the five reviewers, Anne Stalsberg, wrote in the article 'Ytringsfrihet og p√•st√•tt vitenskap ‚Äì et dilemma?' The five leading academics responsible for the reviews explained that although popular literature would not normally be subject to such scrutiny, they felt it was necessary in this case, partly because Heyerdahl himself laid claim to academic credentials and partly due to his popularity. The reviewers, speaking on behalf of the academic community of Norway, categorize Heyerdahl's theory as an example of pseudoarchaeology, based on a selective reading of sources, and a lack of understanding, or a lack of willingness to use basic scientific methodology. Much of the foundation of his theory, they point out, is based on similarities between names of figures from Norse mythology and geographical place-names of the present time in the Pontic steppe and Caucasus. Comparison of these names is done with disregard of linguistic theory, according to the reviewers.Even Hovdhaugen, Christian Keller, Else Mundal, Anne Stalsberg, Gro Steinsland: Anmeldelse av Thor Heyerdahl og Per Lilliestr√∂m: Jakten p√• Odin. Stenersens forlag. Oslo 2001. Maal og Minne 1 (2002) s. 98-109. Azov is believed by Heyerdahl to have derived its name from as-hof ‚Äì temple of the √Üsir. Mainstream linguists and historians will say that the city of Azov got its name from the Turks, over 1000 years after Heyerdahl believes the √Üsir lived there. Heyerdahl also points to the similarities between the word √Üsir and the Azeri and Ossetian peoples of the Caucasus, between the god Odin and the Caucasian language group Udi and between the god Tyr and Turkey, and between the Vanir (a group of Norse gods) and the word Vannic, which was for a time in the 19th and 20th centuries the name used for the Urartian language, spoken in ancient times in the area around Lake Van.

Her first marriage to the ninth Duke of Marlborough has become known as one of the advantageous, but loveless, marriages common during the Gilded Age. The Duke obtained a large dowry by the marriage. Although the teen-age Consuelo was opposed to the marriage arranged by her mother, she became a popular and influential Duchess. For much of the marriage they lived separately and the marriage was finally annulled. She went on to marry a wealthy French aviator and continued her charitable endeavors. Life =Early life= Consuelo Vanderbilt as a child. Consuelo Vanderbilt Born in New York City, she was the only daughter and eldest child of William Kissam Vanderbilt, a New York railroad millionaire, and his first wife, a Mobile, Alabama belle and budding suffragist, Alva Erskine Smith (1853‚Äì1933, who later married Oliver Belmont). Her Spanish name was in honor of her godmother, Consuelo Yznaga (1853‚Äì1909), a half-Cuban, half-American socialite who created a social stir a year earlier when she married the fortune-hunting George, Viscount Mandeville, a union of Old World aristocracy and New World money that caused the groom's father, the 7th Duke of Manchester, to openly wonder if his son and heir had married a \\"Red Indian\\". Consuelo and her friends were the inspiration for Edith Wharton's unfinished novel The Buccaneers. Consuelo Vanderbilt was largely dominated by her mother, who was determined that her daughter would make a great marriage like that of her famous namesake. In her autobiography, Consuelo Vanderbilt described how she was required to wear a steel rod, which ran down her spine and fastened around her waist and over her shoulders, to improve her posture.Stuart, Amanda Mackenzie, Consuelo and Alva Vanderbilt: The Story of a Daughter and Mother in the Gilded Age, Harper Perennial, 2005, , p. 69 She was educated entirely at home by governesses and tutors, and learned foreign languages at an early age.Stuart, p. 70 Her mother was abusive and whipped her with a riding crop for minor infractions.Stuart, pp. 69‚Äì70 When, as a teenager, Consuelo objected to the clothing her mother had selected for her, Alva told her that \\"I do the thinking, you do as you are told.\\"Stuart, p. 84 Consuelo and Winston Churchill at Blenheim, 1902. Consuelo Vanderbilt with her father Like her godmother, Consuelo Vanderbilt attracted numerous title-bearing suitors anxious to trade social position for cash. Her mother reportedly received at least five proposals for her hand. Consuelo was allowed to consider the proposal of just one of the men, Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg, but she developed an instant aversion to him.Stuart, p. 101 None of the others, however, was good enough for Alva Vanderbilt, herself the daughter of a cotton broker. Consuelo Vanderbilt was considered a great beauty, with a face compelling enough to cause the playwright Sir James Barrie, author of Peter Pan, to write, \\"I would stand all day in the street to see Consuelo Marlborough get into her carriage.\\"Stuart, p. 493 Oxford undergraduate Guy Fortescue later described how he and his friends were captivated by her \\"piquante oval face perched upon a long slender neck, her enormous dark eyes fringed with curling lashes, her dimples, and her tiny teeth when she smiled.\\"Stuart, p. 209 She came to embody the \\"slim, tight look\\" that was in vogue during the Edwardian era. = First marriage = The Duchess of Marlborough, 1903, by Paul C√©sar Helleu. Sir James Barrie had said \\"I would wait all night in the rain, to see Consuelo Marlborough get into her carriage.\\"\\"The Glitter and the Gold\\" by Madame Consuelo Balsan Determined to secure the highest-ranking mate possible for her only daughter, a union that would emphasize the preeminence of the Vanderbilt family in New York society, Alva Vanderbilt engineered a meeting between Consuelo and the indebted, titled Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough, chatelain of Blenheim Palace. The matchmaker was a minor American heiress turned major English hostess, Lady Paget, the wife of Sir Arthur Paget. Born as Mary \\"Minnie\\" Stevens, Lady Paget was the daughter of Paran Stevens, the socially ambitious widow of an American hotel entrepreneur who had successfully obtained admittance to the exclusive New York society of the fabled \\"Four Hundred\\". Lady Paget, always short of money, soon became a sort of international marital agent, introducing eligible American heiresses to British noblemen.Stuart, pp. 102‚Äì103, 116‚Äì117 Consuelo Vanderbilt had no interest in the duke, being secretly engaged to an American, Winthrop Rutherfurd.Stuart, pp. 112‚Äì115 Her mother cajoled, wheedled, begged, and then, ultimately, ordered her daughter to marry Marlborough. When Consuelo ‚Äì a docile teenager whose only notable characteristic at the time was abject obedience to her fearsome mother ‚Äì made plans to elope, she was locked in her room as Alva threatened to murder Rutherfurd.Stuart, p. 120 Still she refused. It was only when Alva Vanderbilt claimed that her health was being seriously and irretrievably undermined by Consuelo's stubbornness and appeared to be at death's door that the malleable girl acquiesced.Stuart, p. 121 Alva made an astonishing recovery from her entirely phantom illness, and when the wedding took place, Consuelo stood at the altar reportedly weeping behind her veil.Stuart, p. 145-146 The duke, for his part, gave up the woman he reportedly loved back in England and collected US$2.5 million (approximately US$75.2 million in 2019 dollars) in railroad stock as a marriage settlement.Stuart, p. 135 Consuelo's father built a mansion for her in London, Sunderland House in Curzon Street. Consuelo c. 1910 Consuelo Vanderbilt married His Grace The 9th Duke of Marlborough at St. Thomas Episcopal Church, New York City, on 6 November 1895.Stuart, pp. 146‚Äì147 They had two sons, John Albert William Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford (who became 10th Duke of Marlborough) and Lord Ivor Spencer- Churchill.Stuart, p. 222, 224 The new duchess was adored by the poor and less fortunate tenants on her husband's estate, whom she visited and to whom she provided assistance. She later became involved with other philanthropic projects and was particularly interested in those that affected mothers and children.Stuart, p. 203 She was also a social success with royalty and the aristocracy of Britain.Stuart, pp. 212‚Äì213 However, given the ill-fitting match between the duke and his wife, it was only a matter of time before their marriage was in name only. The duchess eventually was smitten with her husband's cousin, the Hon. Reginald FellowesReginald Fellowes is possibly Hon. Reginald Ailwyn Fellowes (1884‚Äì1953), banker cousin of Winston Churchill and the Duke, who married on 9 August 1919 the heiress Marguerite S√©verine Philippine Decazes de Gl√ºcksbierg (29 April 1890 ‚Äì 13 December 1962) as her second husband. (the liaison did not last, to the relief of Fellowes's parents),Stuart, p. 359 while the duke fell under the spell of Gladys Marie Deacon, an eccentric American of little money but, like Consuelo, dazzling to look at and of considerable intellect.Stuart, pp. 252‚Äì254 The Marlboroughs separated in 1906, divorced in 1921, and the marriage was annulled, at the duke's request and with Consuelo's assent, on 19 August 1926.Stuart, pp. 412‚Äì425 Though largely embarked upon as a way to facilitate the Anglican duke's desire to convert to Roman Catholicism, the annulment, to the surprise of many, also was fully supported by the former duchess's mother, who testified that the Vanderbilt‚ÄìMarlborough marriage had been an act of unmistakable coercion. \\"I forced my daughter to marry the duke\\", Alva Belmont told an investigator, adding: \\"I have always had absolute power over my daughter.\\" In later years, Consuelo and her mother enjoyed a closer, easier relationship. =Second marriage and later life= Consuelo's grave at St Martin's Church, Bladon, England Consuelo's second marriage, on 4 July 1921, was to Lt. Col. Jacques Balsan, a record-breaking pioneer French balloon, aircraft, and hydroplane pilot who once worked with the Wright Brothers. Also a textile manufacturing heir, Balsan was a younger brother of Etienne Balsan, who was an early lover of Coco Chanel.Stuart, pp. 391‚Äì392, 464 Jacques Balsan died in 1956 at the age of 88.Stuart, p. 496 After the annulment of her marriage to the Duke of Marlborough, she still maintained ties with favorite Churchill relatives, particularly Winston Churchill. He was a frequent visitor to her ch√¢teau, in St. Georges Motel, a small commune near Dreux about 50 miles from Paris, in the 1920s and 1930s, where he completed his last painting before the war. Records in Florida show that in 1932 Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan built a home in Manalapan, Florida, just south of Palm Beach. It was designed as a love nest by Maurice Fatio. The dream home of 26,000 square feet is called Casa Alva, in honor of her mother. Although Consuelo sold her home in 1957, it still exists. Many believe that Churchill polished his famous Iron Curtain Speech in that house as he visited his cousin's former wife on his way to Fulton, Missouri, to deliver an address at Westminster College. Consuelo Balsan published her insightful but not entirely candid autobiography, The Glitter and the Gold, in 1953. It was ghostwritten by Stuart Preston, an American writer who was an art critic for The New York Times. A reviewer in the same paper called it \\"an ideal epitaph of the age of elegance.\\"Stuart, 486‚Äì494 Consuelo Balsan died at Southampton, Long Island, New York, on 6 December 1964. She was buried alongside her younger son, Lord Ivor Spencer- Churchill, in the churchyard at St Martin's Church, Bladon, Oxfordshire, England, near her former home, Blenheim Palace.Stuart, p. 501  Public service  During World War I, Consuelo Vanderbilt worked as the chair of the Economic Relief Committee for the American Women's War Relief Fund. During the inter-war period, she and Winaretta Singer-Polignac (the Princess de Polignac and Singer Sewing Machine heiress) worked together in the construction of a 360-bed hospital destined to provide medical care to middle class workers. The result of this effort is the Foch Hospital, located in Suresnes, a suburb of Paris, France. The hospital also includes a school of nursing and is one of the top ranked hospitals in France, especially for renal transplants. It has remained true to its origins and stayed a private not-for-profit institution that still serves the Paris community. It is managed by the Fondation m√©dicale Franco-am√©ricaine du Mont-Val√©rien, commonly called Foundation Foch.

The correct key has notches or slots corresponding to the obstructions in the lock, allowing it to rotate freely inside the lock.  History  The warded lock is one of the oldest lock designs which can be found as far back as ancient China and Rome. During the Middle Ages they were used prolifically on monasteries where, because money and time were not issues, their complexity grew. Warded locks are still in use today in the UK and Ireland for low security applications, and on heritage sites such as ancient monuments and churches to preserve original features, with primary security being provided by other means such as a lever lock mechanism installed alongside.  Design  In a basic warded lock, a set of obstructions, often consisting of concentric plates protruding outwards, blocks the rotation of a key not designed for that lock. Warded locks may have one simple ward, or many intricate wards with bends and complex protrusions; the principle remains the same. Unless the notches or slots in the key correspond to the wards in the lock, the key will strike an obstruction and will not turn. Additionally, a series of grooves on either side of the key's blade limit the type of lock the key can slide into. As the key slides into the lock through the keyway, the wards align with the grooves in the key's profile to allow or deny entry into the lock cylinder. Although this is not commonly recognized when discussing warded locks, it is more applicable to current locksmithing applications such as pin-tumbler or wafer-tumbler locks. In double sided locks (meaning locks where the key can be inserted from either side of the door) the centre of the key shaft is solid and protrudes past the end of the bit which slots into a hole on the opposite side of the lock. Double sided ward locks nearly always have perfectly symmetrical bits. For single sided locks a cylindrical post is typically located in the center of the lock. Its purpose is to provide a point of leverage for rotating the key, and to help correctly align the key with the wards. The key has a corresponding hole which fits over the post. When the correct key is inserted, it will clear the wards and rotate about the center post. The key may then strike a lever, activating a latch or sliding bolt, or it may itself push against the latch or bolt. In a double acting lever lock, the key may additionally push against a spring-loaded lever which holds the sliding bolt in place.  Vulnerabilities  Due to the design of the lock, a well designed skeleton key can be made to bypass the wards. For this reason warded lock mechanisms are generally used in low security applications. There are also a very limited number of unique keys that can be created, so many keys will be able to open other doors that they were not designed to open. The invention of the lever tumbler lock solves this problem, as each lever is required to be lifted to a certain height in order to operate the locking mechanism.

The Bielefeld conspiracy (German: Bielefeldverschw√∂rung or Bielefeld-Verschw√∂rung, ) is a satire of conspiracy theories that claims that the city of Bielefeld, Germany, does not exist, but is an illusion propagated by various forces. First posted on the German Usenet in 1994, the conspiracy has since been mentioned in the city's marketing, and alluded to in a speech by Chancellor Angela Merkel. Synopsis The story goes that the city of Bielefeld (population of 336,352 ) in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia does not actually exist. Rather, its existence is merely propagated by an entity known only as DIE (\\"they\\" in German, always in block capitals), which has conspired with the authorities to create the illusion of the city's existence. The theory poses three questions: #Do you know anybody from Bielefeld? #Have you ever been to Bielefeld? #Do you know anybody who has ever been to Bielefeld? A majority are expected to answer no to all three queries. Anybody claiming knowledge about Bielefeld is promptly disregarded as being in on the conspiracy or having been themselves deceived. The origins of and reasons for this conspiracy are not a part of the original theory. Speculated originators jokingly include the CIA, Mossad, or aliens who use Bielefeld University as a disguise for their spaceship.Die Bielefeld-Verschw√∂rung ‚Äì German page detailing the conspiracy, as originally setup by Achim Held in 1994. Germany's Latest Conspiracy Theory at the Deutsche Welle website History The conspiracy theory was first made public in a posting to the newsgroup \`de.talk.bizarre\` on 16 May 1994 by Achim Held, a computer science student at the University of Kiel.The first newsgroup posting (Archived version at Google Groups) When a friend of Achim Held met someone from Bielefeld at a student party in 1993, he said \\"\\", a phrase comparable to \\"I don't believe it\\", signifying disbelief or surprise. However, its literal translation is \\"That does not exist\\", thus suggesting (ambiguously) not only that claim wasn't real but also that the town isn't real either. From there, it spread throughout the German-speaking Internet community, and has lost little of its popularity, even after years. In a television interview conducted for the tenth anniversary of the newsgroup posting, Held stated that this myth definitely originated from his Usenet posting which was intended only as a joke. According to Held, the idea for the conspiracy theory formed in his mind at a student party while speaking to an avid reader of New Age magazines, and from a car journey past Bielefeld at a time when the exit from the Autobahn to it was closed.Transcript of the TV interview with Achim Held in 2004 There are a number of conflicting theories about the reasons behind the joke's gain in popularity, the most popular being a flame war between Usenet admins and the Bielefeld-based Z-Netz BBS about text encodings. Historian Alan Lessoff notes that a reason for the amusement value of the theory is Bielefeld's lack of notable features, as being home to no major institutions or tourist attractions and not being on the course of a major river, \\"Bielefeld defines nondescript\\". Public reception The Bielefeld conspiracy remains one of the most popular internet jokes originating in Germany. In November 2012, German Chancellor Angela Merkel referred to the conspiracy in public when talking about a town hall meeting she had attended in Bielefeld, adding: \\"... if it exists at all\\", and \\"I had the impression that I was there.\\"\\"Auch Merkel zweifelt an Existenz Bielefelds\\" , Die Welt, November 27, 2012 (retrieved May 7, 2013). =Official response= The city council of Bielefeld made efforts to generate publicity for Bielefeld and build a nationally known public image of the city. However, even 10 years after the conspiracy started, the mayor's office still received phone calls and e-mails which claimed to doubt the existence of the city. In 1999, five years after the myth started to spread, the city council released a press statement titled ' (Bielefeld does exist!) on April Fools' Day. In allusion to the origin of the conspiracy the 800th anniversary of Bielefeld was held in 2014 under the motto (That cannot be real). In August 2019, the council offered to give 1 million euros to any person who could provide \\"incontrovertible evidence\\" of its nonexistence in an effort to increase interest in the city. Film In 2009, film students at Bielefeld University started a project to develop a feature film based on the Bielefeld conspiracy. The project was financed by the university and local sponsors. Most of the project's staff and actors were students or university employees; a few professionals, such as the actress Julia Kahl and the cameraman Alexander B√∂ke, also joined the project. The screenplay was written by Thomas Walden.

Ring theory studies the structure of rings, their representations, or, in different language, modules, special classes of rings (group rings, division rings, universal enveloping algebras), as well as an array of properties that proved to be of interest both within the theory itself and for its applications, such as homological properties and polynomial identities. Commutative rings are much better understood than noncommutative ones. Algebraic geometry and algebraic number theory, which provide many natural examples of commutative rings, have driven much of the development of commutative ring theory, which is now, under the name of commutative algebra, a major area of modern mathematics. Because these three fields (algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory and commutative algebra) are so intimately connected it is usually difficult and meaningless to decide which field a particular result belongs to. For example, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is a theorem which is fundamental for algebraic geometry, and is stated and proved in terms of commutative algebra. Similarly, Fermat's last theorem is stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, which is a part of commutative algebra, but its proof involves deep results of both algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry. Noncommutative rings are quite different in flavour, since more unusual behavior can arise. While the theory has developed in its own right, a fairly recent trend has sought to parallel the commutative development by building the theory of certain classes of noncommutative rings in a geometric fashion as if they were rings of functions on (non-existent) 'noncommutative spaces'. This trend started in the 1980s with the development of noncommutative geometry and with the discovery of quantum groups. It has led to a better understanding of noncommutative rings, especially noncommutative Noetherian rings. For the definitions of a ring and basic concepts and their properties, see ring (mathematics). The definitions of terms used throughout ring theory may be found in the glossary of ring theory. Commutative rings A ring is called commutative if its multiplication is commutative. Commutative rings resemble familiar number systems, and various definitions for commutative rings are designed to formalize properties of the integers. Commutative rings are also important in algebraic geometry. In commutative ring theory, numbers are often replaced by ideals, and the definition of the prime ideal tries to capture the essence of prime numbers. Integral domains, non-trivial commutative rings where no two non-zero elements multiply to give zero, generalize another property of the integers and serve as the proper realm to study divisibility. Principal ideal domains are integral domains in which every ideal can be generated by a single element, another property shared by the integers. Euclidean domains are integral domains in which the Euclidean algorithm can be carried out. Important examples of commutative rings can be constructed as rings of polynomials and their factor rings. Summary: Euclidean domain => principal ideal domain => unique factorization domain => integral domain => Commutative ring. =Algebraic geometry= Algebraic geometry is in many ways the mirror image of commutative algebra. This correspondence started with Hilbert's Nullstellensatz that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the points of an algebraic variety, and the maximal ideals of its coordinate ring. This correspondence has been enlarged and systematized for translating (and proving) most geometrical properties of algebraic varieties into algebraic properties of associated commutative rings. Alexander Grothendieck completed this by introducing schemes, a generalization of algebraic varieties, which may be built from any commutative ring. More precisely, the spectrum of a commutative ring is the space of its prime ideals equipped with Zariski topology, and augmented with a sheaf of rings. These objects are the \\"affine schemes\\" (generalization of affine varieties), and a general scheme is then obtained by \\"gluing together\\" (by purely algebraic methods) several such affine schemes, in analogy to the way of constructing a manifold by gluing together the charts of an atlas. Noncommutative rings Noncommutative rings resemble rings of matrices in many respects. Following the model of algebraic geometry, attempts have been made recently at defining noncommutative geometry based on noncommutative rings. Noncommutative rings and associative algebras (rings that are also vector spaces) are often studied via their categories of modules. A module over a ring is an abelian group that the ring acts on as a ring of endomorphisms, very much akin to the way fields (integral domains in which every non-zero element is invertible) act on vector spaces. Examples of noncommutative rings are given by rings of square matrices or more generally by rings of endomorphisms of abelian groups or modules, and by monoid rings. =Representation theory= Representation theory is a branch of mathematics that draws heavily on non-commutative rings. It studies abstract algebraic structures by representing their elements as linear transformations of vector spaces, and studies modules over these abstract algebraic structures. In essence, a representation makes an abstract algebraic object more concrete by describing its elements by matrices and the algebraic operations in terms of matrix addition and matrix multiplication, which is non-commutative. The algebraic objects amenable to such a description include groups, associative algebras and Lie algebras. The most prominent of these (and historically the first) is the representation theory of groups, in which elements of a group are represented by invertible matrices in such a way that the group operation is matrix multiplication.

For example, the polynomial ring k[t_1, \\\\cdots, t_n] over a field k has dimension n. The fundamental theorem in the dimension theory states the following numbers coincide for a noetherian local ring (R, \\\\mathfrak{m}): *The Krull dimension of R. *The minimum number of the generators of the \\\\mathfrak{m}-primary ideals. *The dimension of the graded ring \\\\operatorname{gr}_{\\\\mathfrak{m}}(R) = \\\\oplus_{k \\\\ge 0} \\\\mathfrak{m}^k/{\\\\mathfrak{m}^{k+1}} (equivalently, one plus the degree of its Hilbert polynomial). A commutative ring R is said to be catenary if any pair of prime ideals \\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{p}' can be extended to a chain of prime ideals \\\\mathfrak{p} = \\\\mathfrak{p}_0 \\\\subsetneq \\\\cdots \\\\subsetneq \\\\mathfrak{p}_n = \\\\mathfrak{p}' of same finite length such that there is no prime ideal that is strictly contained in two consecutive terms. Practically all noetherian rings that appear in application are catenary. If (R, \\\\mathfrak{m}) is a catenary local integral domain, then, by definition, :\\\\operatorname{dim}R = \\\\operatorname{ht}\\\\mathfrak{p} + \\\\operatorname{dim}R/\\\\mathfrak{p} where \\\\operatorname{ht}\\\\mathfrak{p} = \\\\operatorname{dim}R_{\\\\mathfrak{p}} is the height of \\\\mathfrak{p}. It is a deep theorem of Ratliff that the converse is also true. If R is an integral domain that is a finitely generated k-algebra, then its dimension is the transcendence degree of its field of fractions over k. If S is an integral extension of a commutative ring R, then S and R have the same dimension. Closely related concepts are those of depth and global dimension. In general, if R is a noetherian local ring, then the depth of R is less than or equal to the dimension of R. When the equality holds, R is called a Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay ring. A regular local ring is an example of a Cohen‚ÄìMacaulay ring. It is a theorem of Serre that R is a regular local ring if and only if it has finite global dimension and in that case the global dimension is the Krull dimension of R. The significance of this is that a global dimension is a homological notion. =Morita equivalence= Two rings R, S are said to be Morita equivalent if the category of left modules over R is equivalent to the category of left modules over S. In fact, two commutative rings which are Morita equivalent must be isomorphic, so the notion does not add anything new to the category of commutative rings. However, commutative rings can be Morita equivalent to noncommutative rings, so Morita equivalence is coarser than isomorphism. Morita equivalence is especially important in algebraic topology and functional analysis. =Finitely generated projective module over a ring and Picard group= Let R be a commutative ring and \\\\mathbf{P}(R) the set of isomorphism classes of finitely generated projective modules over R; let also \\\\mathbf{P}_n(R) subsets consisting of those with constant rank n. (The rank of a module M is the continuous function \\\\operatorname{Spec}R \\\\to \\\\mathbb{Z}, \\\\, \\\\mathfrak{p} \\\\mapsto \\\\dim M \\\\otimes_R k(\\\\mathfrak{p}).) \\\\mathbf{P}_1(R) is usually denoted by Pic(R). It is an abelian group called the Picard group of R. If R is an integral domain with the field of fractions F of R, then there is an exact sequence of groups: :1 \\\\to R^* \\\\to F^* \\\\overset{f \\\\mapsto fR}\\\\to \\\\operatorname{Cart}(R) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Pic}(R) \\\\to 1 where \\\\operatorname{Cart}(R) is the set of fractional ideals of R. If R is a regular domain (i.e., regular at any prime ideal), then Pic(R) is precisely the divisor class group of R. For example, if R is a principal ideal domain, then Pic(R) vanishes. In algebraic number theory, R will be taken to be the ring of integers, which is Dedekind and thus regular. It follows that Pic(R) is a finite group (finiteness of class number) that measures the deviation of the ring of integers from being a PID. One can also consider the group completion of \\\\mathbf{P}(R); this results in a commutative ring K0(R). Note that K0(R) = K0(S) if two commutative rings R, S are Morita equivalent. =Structure of noncommutative rings= The structure of a noncommutative ring is more complicated than that of a commutative ring. For example, there exist simple rings, containing no non-trivial proper (two-sided) ideals, which contain non- trivial proper left or right ideals. Various invariants exist for commutative rings, whereas invariants of noncommutative rings are difficult to find. As an example, the nilradical of a ring, the set of all nilpotent elements, need not be an ideal unless the ring is commutative. Specifically, the set of all nilpotent elements in the ring of all n x n matrices over a division ring never forms an ideal, irrespective of the division ring chosen. There are, however, analogues of the nilradical defined for noncommutative rings, that coincide with the nilradical when commutativity is assumed. The concept of the Jacobson radical of a ring; that is, the intersection of all right/left annihilators of simple right/left modules over a ring, is one example. The fact that the Jacobson radical can be viewed as the intersection of all maximal right/left ideals in the ring, shows how the internal structure of the ring is reflected by its modules. It is also a fact that the intersection of all maximal right ideals in a ring is the same as the intersection of all maximal left ideals in the ring, in the context of all rings; whether commutative or noncommutative. Noncommutative rings serve as an active area of research due to their ubiquity in mathematics. For instance, the ring of n-by-n matrices over a field is noncommutative despite its natural occurrence in geometry, physics and many parts of mathematics. More generally, endomorphism rings of abelian groups are rarely commutative, the simplest example being the endomorphism ring of the Klein four-group. One of the best known noncommutative rings is the division ring of quaternions. Applications =The ring of integers of a number field= =The coordinate ring of an algebraic variety= If X is an affine algebraic variety, then the set of all regular functions on X forms a ring called the coordinate ring of X. For a projective variety, there is an analogous ring called the homogeneous coordinate ring. Those rings are essentially the same things as varieties: they correspond in essentially a unique way. This may be seen via either Hilbert's Nullstellensatz or scheme-theoretic constructions (i.e., Spec and Proj). =Ring of invariants= A basic (and perhaps the most fundamental) question in the classical invariant theory is to find and study polynomials in the polynomial ring k[V] that are invariant under the action of a finite group (or more generally reductive) G on V. The main example is the ring of symmetric polynomials: symmetric polynomials are polynomials that are invariant under permutation of variable. The fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials states that this ring is R[\\\\sigma_1, \\\\ldots, \\\\sigma_n] where \\\\sigma_i are elementary symmetric polynomials. History Commutative ring theory originated in algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry, and invariant theory. Central to the development of these subjects were the rings of integers in algebraic number fields and algebraic function fields, and the rings of polynomials in two or more variables. Noncommutative ring theory began with attempts to extend the complex numbers to various hypercomplex number systems. The genesis of the theories of commutative and noncommutative rings dates back to the early 19th century, while their maturity was achieved only in the third decade of the 20th century. More precisely, William Rowan Hamilton put forth the quaternions and biquaternions; James Cockle presented tessarines and coquaternions; and William Kingdon Clifford was an enthusiast of split-biquaternions, which he called algebraic motors. These noncommutative algebras, and the non-associative Lie algebras, were studied within universal algebra before the subject was divided into particular mathematical structure types. One sign of re-organization was the use of direct sums to describe algebraic structure. The various hypercomplex numbers were identified with matrix rings by Joseph Wedderburn (1908) and Emil Artin (1928). Wedderburn's structure theorems were formulated for finite-dimensional algebras over a field while Artin generalized them to Artinian rings. In 1920, Emmy Noether, in collaboration with W. Schmeidler, published a paper about the theory of ideals in which they defined left and right ideals in a ring. The following year she published a landmark paper called Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen, analyzing ascending chain conditions with regard to (mathematical) ideals. Noted algebraist Irving Kaplansky called this work \\"revolutionary\\"; the publication gave rise to the term \\"Noetherian ring\\", and several other mathematical objects being called Noetherian., p. 44‚Äì45.

Then, as the needle rises upward, the friction of the thread against the fabric is sufficient to form a small loop on the underside of the material. That loop is caught by a circular needle which is beneath the work. The machine then moves the material forward projecting the loop on the underside from the previous stitch. The next drop of the needle goes through the previous loop. The circular needle then releases the first loop and picks up the new loop and the process repeats.1902 Encyclopedia * The Double chain stitch uses two threads.

This means some of the explanatory variables are jointly determined with the dependent variable, which in economics usually is the consequence of some underlying equilibrium mechanism. For instance, in the simple model of supply and demand, price and quantity are jointly determined. Simultaneity poses challenges for the estimation of the statistical parameters of interest, because the Gauss‚ÄìMarkov assumption of strict exogeneity of the regressors is violated. And while it would be natural to estimate all simultaneous equations at once, this often leads to a computationally costly non-linear optimization problem even for the simplest system of linear equations. This situation prompted the development, spearheaded by the Cowles Commission in the 1940s and 1950s, of various techniques that estimate each equation in the model seriatim, most notably limited information maximum likelihood and two-stage least squares.  Structural and reduced form  Suppose there are m regression equations of the form : y_{it} = y_{-i,t}'\\\\gamma_i + x_{it}'\\\\;\\\\\\\\!\\\\beta_i + u_{it}, \\\\quad i=1,\\\\ldots,m, where i is the equation number, and is the observation index. In these equations xit is the ki√ó1 vector of exogenous variables, yit is the dependent variable, y‚àíi,t is the ni√ó1 vector of all other endogenous variables which enter the ith equation on the right-hand side, and uit are the error terms. The ‚Äú‚àíi‚Äù notation indicates that the vector y‚àíi,t may contain any of the y‚Äôs except for yit (since it is already present on the left-hand side). The regression coefficients Œ≤i and Œ≥i are of dimensions ki√ó1 and ni√ó1 correspondingly. Vertically stacking the T observations corresponding to the ith equation, we can write each equation in vector form as : y_i = Y_{-i}\\\\gamma_i + X_i\\\\beta_i + u_i, \\\\quad i=1,\\\\ldots,m, where yi and ui are T√ó1 vectors, Xi is a T√óki matrix of exogenous regressors, and Y‚àíi is a T√óni matrix of endogenous regressors on the right-hand side of the ith equation. Finally, we can move all endogenous variables to the left-hand side and write the m equations jointly in vector form as : Y\\\\Gamma = X\\\\Beta + U.\\\\, This representation is known as the structural form. In this equation is the T√óm matrix of dependent variables. Each of the matrices Y‚àíi is in fact an ni-columned submatrix of this Y. The m√óm matrix Œì, which describes the relation between the dependent variables, has a complicated structure. It has ones on the diagonal, and all other elements of each column i are either the components of the vector ‚àíŒ≥i or zeros, depending on which columns of Y were included in the matrix Y‚àíi. The T√ók matrix X contains all exogenous regressors from all equations, but without repetitions (that is, matrix X should be of full rank). Thus, each Xi is a ki- columned submatrix of X. Matrix Œí has size k√óm, and each of its columns consists of the components of vectors Œ≤i and zeros, depending on which of the regressors from X were included or excluded from Xi. Finally, is a T√óm matrix of the error terms. Postmultiplying the structural equation by , the system can be written in the reduced form as : Y = X\\\\Beta\\\\Gamma^{-1} + U\\\\Gamma^{-1} = X\\\\Pi + V.\\\\, This is already a simple general linear model, and it can be estimated for example by ordinary least squares. Unfortunately, the task of decomposing the estimated matrix \\\\scriptstyle\\\\hat\\\\Pi into the individual factors Œí and is quite complicated, and therefore the reduced form is more suitable for prediction but not inference. = Assumptions = Firstly, the rank of the matrix X of exogenous regressors must be equal to k, both in finite samples and in the limit as (this later requirement means that in the limit the expression \\\\scriptstyle \\\\frac1TX'\\\\\\\\!X should converge to a nondegenerate k√ók matrix). Matrix Œì is also assumed to be non-degenerate. Secondly, error terms are assumed to be serially independent and identically distributed. That is, if the tth row of matrix U is denoted by u(t), then the sequence of vectors {u(t)} should be iid, with zero mean and some covariance matrix Œ£ (which is unknown). In particular, this implies that , and . Lastly, assumptions are required for identification. Identification The identification conditions require that the number of unknowns in this system of equations should not exceed the number of equations. More specifically, the order condition requires that for each equation , which can be phrased as ‚Äúthe number of excluded exogenous variables is greater or equal to the number of included endogenous variables‚Äù. The rank condition of identifiability is that , where Œ†i0 is a matrix which is obtained from Œ† by crossing out those columns which correspond to the excluded endogenous variables, and those rows which correspond to the included exogenous variables. =Using cross-equation restrictions to achieve identification= In simultaneous equations models, the most common method to achieve identification is by imposing within- equation parameter restrictions.Wooldridge, J.M., Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data, MIT Press, Cambridge, Mass. Yet, identification is also possible using cross equation restrictions. To illustrate how cross equation restrictions can be used for identification, consider the following example from Wooldridge y1 = Œ≥12 y2 \\\\+ Œ¥11 z1 \\\\+ Œ¥12 z2 \\\\+ Œ¥13 z3 \\\\+ u1 y2 = Œ≥21 y1 \\\\+ Œ¥21 z1 \\\\+ Œ¥22 z2 \\\\+ u2 where z's are uncorrelated with u's and y's are endogenous variables. Without further restrictions, the first equation is not identified because there is no excluded exogenous variable. The second equation is just identified if Œ¥13‚â†0, which is assumed to be true for the rest of discussion. Now we impose the cross equation restriction of Œ¥12=Œ¥22. Since the second equation is identified, we can treat Œ¥12 as known for the purpose of identification. Then, the first equation becomes: y1 \\\\- Œ¥12 z2 = Œ≥12 y2 \\\\+ Œ¥11 z1 \\\\+ Œ¥13 z3 \\\\+ u1 Then, we can use (z1,z2,z3) as instruments to estimate the coefficients in the above equation since there are one endogenous variable (y2) and one excluded exogenous variable (z2) on the right hand side. Therefore, cross equation restrictions in place of within-equation restrictions can achieve identification.  Estimation  = Two-stages least squares (2SLS) = The simplest and the most common estimation method for the simultaneous equations model is the so-called two-stage least squares method, developed independently by and . It is an equation-by-equation technique, where the endogenous regressors on the right-hand side of each equation are being instrumented with the regressors X from all other equations. The method is called ‚Äútwo-stage‚Äù because it conducts estimation in two steps: : Step 1: Regress Y‚àíi on X and obtain the predicted values \\\\scriptstyle\\\\hat{Y}_{\\\\\\\\!-i}; : Step 2: Estimate Œ≥i, Œ≤i by the ordinary least squares regression of yi on \\\\scriptstyle\\\\hat{Y}_{\\\\\\\\!-i} and Xi. If the ith equation in the model is written as : y_i = \\\\begin{pmatrix}Y_{-i} & X_i\\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\\\gamma_i\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\beta_i\\\\end{pmatrix} + u_i \\\\equiv Z_i \\\\delta_i + u_i, where Zi is a T√ó(ni \\\\+ ki) matrix of both endogenous and exogenous regressors in the ith equation, and Œ¥i is an (ni \\\\+ ki)-dimensional vector of regression coefficients, then the 2SLS estimator of Œ¥i will be given by : \\\\hat\\\\delta_i = \\\\big(\\\\hat{Z}'_i\\\\hat{Z}_i\\\\big)^{-1}\\\\hat{Z}'_i y_i = \\\\big( Z'_iPZ_i \\\\big)^{-1} Z'_iPy_i, where is the projection matrix onto the linear space spanned by the exogenous regressors X. = Indirect least squares = Indirect least squares is an approach in econometrics where the coefficients in a simultaneous equations model are estimated from the reduced form model using ordinary least squares.Park, S-B. (1974) \\"On Indirect Least Squares Estimation of a Simultaneous Equation System\\", The Canadian Journal of Statistics / La Revue Canadienne de Statistique, 2 (1), 75‚Äì82 For this, the structural system of equations is transformed into the reduced form first. Once the coefficients are estimated the model is put back into the structural form. = Limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) = The ‚Äúlimited information‚Äù maximum likelihood method was suggested M. A. Girshick in 1947,First application by and formalized by T. W. Anderson and H. Rubin in 1949. It is used when one is interested in estimating a single structural equation at a time (hence its name of limited information), say for observation i: : y_i = Y_{-i}\\\\gamma_i +X_i\\\\beta_i+ u_i \\\\equiv Z_i \\\\delta_i + u_i The structural equations for the remaining endogenous variables Y‚àíi are not specified, and they are given in their reduced form: : Y_{-i} = X \\\\Pi + U_{-i} Notation in this context is different than for the simple IV case. One has: * Y_{-i}: The endogenous variable(s). * X_{-i}: The exogenous variable(s) * X: The instrument(s) (often denoted Z) The explicit formula for the LIML is: : \\\\hat\\\\delta_i = \\\\Big(Z'_i(I-\\\\lambda M)Z_i\\\\Big)^{\\\\\\\\!-1}Z'_i(I-\\\\lambda M)y_i, where , and Œª is the smallest characteristic root of the matrix: : \\\\Big(\\\\begin{bmatrix}y_i\\\\\\\\\\\\Y_{-i}\\\\end{bmatrix} M_i \\\\begin{bmatrix}y_i&Y;_{-i}\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\Big) \\\\Big(\\\\begin{bmatrix}y_i\\\\\\\\\\\\Y_{-i}\\\\end{bmatrix} M \\\\begin{bmatrix}y_i&Y;_{-i}\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\Big)^{\\\\\\\\!-1} where, in a similar way, . In other words, Œª is the smallest solution of the generalized eigenvalue problem, see : : \\\\Big\\\\begin{bmatrix}y_i&Y;_{-i}\\\\end{bmatrix}' M_i \\\\begin{bmatrix}y_i&Y;_{-i}\\\\end{bmatrix} -\\\\lambda \\\\begin{bmatrix}y_i&Y;_{-i}\\\\end{bmatrix}' M \\\\begin{bmatrix}y_i&Y;_{-i}\\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\Big=0  K class estimators  The LIML is a special case of the K-class estimators: : \\\\hat\\\\delta = \\\\Big(Z'(I-\\\\kappa M)Z\\\\Big)^{\\\\\\\\!-1}Z'(I-\\\\kappa M)y, with: * \\\\delta = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\beta_i & \\\\gamma_i\\\\end{bmatrix} * Z = \\\\begin{bmatrix} X_i & Y_{-i}\\\\end{bmatrix} Several estimators belong to this class: * Œ∫=0: OLS * Œ∫=1: 2SLS. Note indeed that in this case, I-\\\\kappa M = I-M= P the usual projection matrix of the 2SLS * Œ∫=Œª: LIML * Œ∫=Œª - Œ± (n-K): estimator. Here K represents the number of instruments, n the sample size, and Œ± a positive constant to specify. A value of Œ±=1 will yield an estimator that is approximately unbiased. = Three-stage least squares (3SLS) = The three- stage least squares estimator was introduced by . It can be seen as a special case of multi-equation GMM where the set of instrumental variables is common to all equations. If all regressors are in fact predetermined, then 3SLS reduces to seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR). Thus it may also be seen as a combination of two-stage least squares (2SLS) with SUR.  Applications in social science  Across fields and disciplines simultaneous equation models are applied to various observational phenomena. These equations are applied when phenomena are assumed to be reciprocally causal. The classic example is supply and demand in economics. In other disciplines there are examples such as candidate evaluations and party identification or public opinion and social policy in political science; road investment and travel demand in geography; and educational attainment and parenthood entry in sociology or demography. The simultaneous equation model requires a theory of reciprocal causality that includes special features if the causal effects are to be estimated as simultaneous feedback as opposed to one-sided 'blocks' of an equation where a researcher is interested in the causal effect of X on Y while holding the causal effect of Y on X constant, or when the researcher knows the exact amount of time it takes for each causal effect to take place, i.e., the length of the causal lags. Instead of lagged effects, simultaneous feedback means estimating the simultaneous and perpetual impact of X and Y on each other. This requires a theory that causal effects are simultaneous in time, or so complex that they appear to behave simultaneously; a common example are the moods of roommates. To estimate simultaneous feedback models a theory of equilibrium is also necessary ‚Äì that X and Y are in relatively steady states or are part of a system (society, market, classroom) that is in a relatively stable state.2013\\\\. ‚ÄúReverse Arrow Dynamics: Feedback Loops and Formative Measurement.‚Äù In Structural Equation Modeling: A Second Course, edited by Gregory R.

It has an area of , making it the third-largest lake in Italy, after Lake Garda and Lake Maggiore. At over deep, it is the fifth deepest lake in Europe, and the deepest outside Norway; the bottom of the lake is more than below sea level. Lake Como has been a popular retreat for aristocrats and wealthy people since Roman times, and a very popular tourist attraction with many artistic and cultural gems. It has many villas and palaces such as Villa Olmo, Villa Serbelloni, and Villa Carlotta. Many famous people have had and have homes on the shores of Lake Como. One of its particularity is its characteristic \\"Y\\" shape, which forms the so-called \\"Larian Triangle\\", with the little town of Canzo as its capital. In 2014, The Huffington Post called it the most beautiful lake in the world for its microclimate and environment with prestigious villas and villages. Etymology The lake's name in Latin is Larius, Italianised as Lario, but this name is rarely used; it is usually called Lago di Como (literally \\"lake of Como\\"). In guidebooks the lake may be variously referred to as Lake Como, Lake of Como, or Como Lake. Its name comes from the city of Como, known to the Romans as Comum. Geography Aerial photograph of Lake Como, showing its distinctive three-armed shape The lake is shaped much like an inverted letter \\"Y\\". The northern branch begins at the town of Colico, while the towns of Como and Lecco sit at the ends of the southwestern and southeastern branches respectively. The small towns of Bellagio, Menaggio and Varenna are situated at the intersection of the three branches of the lake: a triangular boat service operates between them. Lake Como is fed primarily by the Adda, which enters the lake near Colico and flows out at Lecco. This geological conformation makes the southwestern branch a dead end, and so Como, unlike Lecco, is often flooded. The mountainous pre-alpine territory between the two southern arms of the lake (between Como, Bellagio, and Lecco) is known as the Larian Triangle,The meaning of Larian is \\"related to the Lake Como\\", since the Latin name of Lake Como was Larius. So, the expression Triangolo lariano, or, in English, Larian Triangle, means exactly \\"Lake Como Triangle\\" or \\"Triangle of the Lake Como\\". or Triangolo lariano. The source of the river Lambro is here. At the centre of the triangle, the town of Canzo is the seat of the Comunit√† montana del Triangolo lariano, an association of the 31 municipalities that represent the 71,000 inhabitants of the area. =Climate= Lake Como weather is humid subtropical (Cfa in the K√∂ppen climate classification). In the winter, the lake helps to maintain a higher temperature in the surrounding region. Average daily temperatures range from about in January to in July, according to historical weather data from Como. Water temperatures can reach an average of during the month of July. Snowfall is erratic and primarily affects the higher elevations. Rainfall is heaviest in May and lowest during the winter months. Tourism As a tourist destination, Lake Como is popular for its landscapes, wildlife, and spas.Lake Como holidays, inghams.com, April 20, 2010 It is a venue for sailing, windsurfing, and kitesurfing.2006 Kiteboard Pro World Tour event, Lake Como, Italiaspeed.com, June 6, 2006 In 1818 Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote to Thomas Love Peacock: \\"This lake exceeds anything I ever beheld in beauty, with the exception of the arbutus islands of Killarney. It is long and narrow, and has the appearance of a mighty river winding among the mountains and the forests\\". In the area surrounding Lake Como there are several farms which produce goods such as honey, olive oil, cheese, milk, eggs and salamis. Visitors can find lists of these farms and typically visit the farm itself in person to make their purchases. In 2018, the Italian luxury label Dolce and Gabbana held a fashion event on Lake Como. =Lakeside villas= Villa Carlotta Villa Melzi d'Eril The Lake Como waterfront at sunset, Varenna. Villa del Balbianello Lake Como from lakeside villa The lake is well known for the attractive villas that have been built there since Roman times, when Pliny the Younger built the Comedia and the Tragedia resorts. Many villas on the lake shores have admirable gardens that benefit from the mild climate induced by the stabilizing presence of of lake water and can sustain many subtropical and Mediterranean plants. Villa Carlotta was built for the Milanese Marquis Giorgio Clerici in 1690 and occupies a site of over at Tremezzo, facing the Bellagio peninsula. An Italian garden (with steps, fountains, and sculptures) was laid out at the same time. The villa was later sold to powerful banker and Napoleonic politician Giovanni Battista Sommariva. Stendhal was his guest in 1818, and his visit is recalled at the start of La Chartreuse de Parme. In 1843 it was purchased by Princess Marianne of Nassau as a wedding present for her daughter Carlotta, after whom the villa is now named. The latter, together with her husband Georg II of Saxen-Meiningen, laid out the woodland landscape park in Romantic style. The villa today includes a museum of agricultural implements as well as important works of sculpture by Sommariva's friend Antonio Canova and by Luigi Acquisti.See Infoparchi, Villa Carlotta; Villacarlotta.it, Villa Carlotta; Macadam, Alta Villa d'Este, in Cernobbio, was built in 1568 by Cardinal Tolomeo Gallio, a native of the town. In 1816‚Äì1817 the villa was home to Caroline of Brunswick, estranged wife of the Prince of Wales and shortly to become Queen Consort of King George IV of the United Kingdom. The landscaped gardens in the English style are a product of this period. Later in the century it was turned into a luxury hotel. Today the Villa d'Este is known for attracting celebrity guests. Villa del Balbianello, famous for its elaborate terraced gardens, lies on a promontory of the western shore of the lake near Isola Comacina. Built in 1787 on the site of a Franciscan monastery, it was the final home of the explorer Guido Monzino and today houses a museum devoted to his work. Villa Melzi d'Eril in Bellagio was built in neo-classical style by architect Giocondo Albertolli in 1808‚Äì1810 as the summer residence of Duke Francesco Melzi d'Eril, who was vice-president of the Napoleonic Italian Republic. The park includes an orangery, a private chapel, fine statues, and a Japanese garden, and is planted, as often on lake Como, with huge rhododendrons. 19th-century guests at the Villa included Stendhal and Franz Liszt.See Infoparchi, Villa Melzi. Villa Serbelloni, also in Bellagio, hosts the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center, a international conference center set up and managed by the Rockefeller Foundation since 1959, which also operates a \\"scholar-in-residence\\" program for scholars from around the world. This is believed to have been the site of Pliny the Younger's villa \\"Tragedia\\". Its well-known park was created at the end of the 18th century by Alessandro Serbelloni. Many famous people have or have had homes on the shores of Lake Como, such as Matthew Bellamy, John Kerry, Madonna, George Clooney, Gianni Versace, Ronaldinho, Sylvester Stallone, Julian Lennon, Richard Branson, Ben Spies, Pierina Legnani, Lionel Messi and Jos√© Mourinho. =Ferries= The Lake Como ferry service is a highly developed public transport system linking the many small towns around the Lake. A motorized service began in 1826 when a steamship with sails, the \\"Lario\\", was launched by the newly established Societ√† privilegiata per l'impresa dei battelli a vapore nel Regno Lombardo Veneto. Since 1952 the system has been run under the auspices of a government organization called first the Gestione Commissariale Governativa and subsequently the Gestione Governativa Navigazione Laghi, which is also responsible for services on Lake Maggiore and Lake Garda.Massimo Gozzi, \\"History of Navigation on Lake Como\\" , Gestione Governativa Navigazione Laghi, 2007, pp 1‚Äì2.\\"General Management\\" , Gestione Governativa Navigazione Laghi, 2007. Today there are three main services: * Motorship services along the western branch and northern end of the Lake (between Colico or Piona and Como town), with additional shuttles to the mid-lake area. * Fast services that follow broadly the same route, but use faster hydrofoils, stop less frequently, and cost extra. * Ferries that run only between the popular mid- lake villages of Menaggio, Bellagio, and Varenna, plus Cadenabbia. Some of these boats carry vehicles as well as passengers. =Sacro Monte di Ossuccio= Chapel 5 of Sacro Monte di Ossuccio. Disputation with the Doctors The Sacro Monte di Ossuccio (\\"Holy Mount of Ossuccio\\") is a sanctuary located on a hillside slope between olive groves and woods along the western edge of Lake Como facing Isola Comacina. Fifteen Baroque inspired chapels, built between 1635 and 1710, and dedicated to the Mysteries of the Rosary are dotted along the way that leads to the Monastery. This building is the last in the chain and is dedicated to the Coronation of the Virgin. In 2003, the Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy, including that of Ossuccio, were added by UNESCO to the World Heritage List.

The Manufacture of Iron - Carting Away the Scori√¶ (slag), an 1873 wood engraving Molten slag is carried outside and poured to a dump Slag is the glass-like by-product left over after a desired metal has been separated (i.e., smelted) from its raw ore. Slag is usually a mixture of metal oxides and silicon dioxide. However, slags can contain metal sulfides and elemental metals. While slags are generally used to remove waste in metal smelting, they can also serve other purposes, such as assisting in the temperature control of the smelting, and minimizing any re-oxidation of the final liquid metal product before the molten metal is removed from the furnace and used to make solid metal. In some smelting processes, such as ilmenite smelting to produce titanium dioxide, the slag is the valuable product instead of the metal. Ore smelting In nature, iron, copper, lead, nickel and other metals are found in impure states called ores, often oxidized and mixed in with silicates of other metals. During smelting, when the ore is exposed to high temperatures, these impurities are separated from the molten metal and can be removed. Slag is the collection of compounds that are removed. In many smelting processes, oxides are introduced to control the slag chemistry, assisting in the removal of impurities and protecting the furnace refractory lining from excessive wear. In this case, the slag is termed synthetic. A good example is steelmaking slag: quicklime and magnesite are introduced for refractory protection, neutralising the alumina and silica separated from the metal, and assist in the removal of sulfur and phosphorus from the steel. Slag run-off from one of the open hearth furnaces of a steel mill, Republic Steel, Youngstown, Ohio, November 1941. Slag is drawn off the furnace just before the molten steel is poured into ladles for ingotting. Ferrous and non-ferrous smelting processes produce different slags. The smelting of copper, lead and bauxite in non-ferrous smelting, for instance, is designed to remove the iron and silica that often occurs with those ores, and separates them as iron- silicate-based slags. Slag from steel mills in ferrous smelting, on the other hand, is designed to minimize iron loss and so mainly contains oxides of calcium, silicon, magnesium, and aluminium. Any sandy component or quartz component of the original ore automatically carries through the smelting process as silicon dioxide. As the slag is channeled out of the furnace, water is poured over it. This rapid cooling, often from a temperature of around , is the start of the granulating process. This process causes several chemical reactions to take place within the slag, and gives the material its cementitious properties. The water carries the slag in its slurry format to a large agitation tank, from where it is pumped along a piping system into a number of gravel based filter beds. The filter beds then retain the slag granules, while the water drains away and is returned to the system. When the filtering process is complete, the remaining slag granules, which now give the appearance of coarse beach sand, can be scooped out of the filter bed and transferred to the grinding facility where they are ground into particles that are finer than Portland cement. Ancient uses CE During the Bronze Age of the Mediterranean there were a vast number of differential metallurgical processes in use. A slag by-product of such workings was a colorful, glassy, vitreous material found on the surfaces of slag from ancient copper foundries. It was primarily blue or green and was formerly chipped away and melted down to make glassware products and jewelry. It was also ground into powder to add to glazes for use in ceramics. Some of the earliest such uses for the by- products of slag have been found in ancient Egypt. Historically, the re- smelting of iron ore slag was common practice, as improved smelting techniques permitted greater iron yields‚Äîin some cases exceeding that which was originally achieved. During the early 20th century, iron ore slag was also ground to a powder and used to make agate glass, also known as slag glass. Modern uses Ground granulated slag is often used in concrete in combination with Portland cement as part of a blended cement. Ground granulated slag reacts with a calcium byproduct created during the reaction of Portland cement to produce cementitious properties. Concrete containing ground granulated slag develops strength over a longer period, leading to reduced permeability and better durability. Since the unit volume of Portland cement is reduced, this concrete is less vulnerable to alkali-silica and sulfate attack. This previously unwanted recycled product is used in the manufacture of high-performance concretes, especially those used in the construction of bridges and coastal features, where its low permeability and greater resistance to chlorides and sulfates can help to reduce corrosive action and deterioration of the structure. The slag can also be used to create fibers used as an insulation material called slag wool. Basic slag Basic slag is a co-product of steelmaking, and is typically produced either through the blast furnace - oxygen converter route or the electric arc furnace - ladle furnace route. To flux the silica produced during steelmaking, limestone and/or dolomite are added, as well as other types of slag conditioners such as calcium aluminate or fluorspar. The major components of these slags therefore include the oxides of calcium, magnesium, silicon, iron, and aluminum, with lesser amounts of manganese, phosphorus, and others depending on the specifics of the raw materials used. Because of the slowly released phosphate content in phosphorus-containing slag, and because of its liming effect, it is valued as fertilizer in gardens and farms in steel making areas. However, the most important application is construction.

He served as a Republican in both the United States House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Early life Grams was born in Princeton, Minnesota and attended Brown Institute (1966‚Äì68), Anoka-Ramsey Community College (1970‚Äì72), and Carroll College (1974‚Äì75). Grams spent 23 years in the field of television and radio broadcasting before launching a career in politics. From 1982‚Äì91 he was the senior news anchor at KMSP-TV in Minneapolis/St. Paul. Before that, he worked as a news anchor/producer for KFBB-TV in Great Falls, Montana; WSAU-TV in Wausau, Wisconsin; and WIFR-TV in Rockford, Illinois. Prior to his years in broadcasting, Grams worked at an engineering consulting firm for seven years. In 1985, Grams formed Sun Ridge Builders, a Twin Cities construction and residential development company, serving as its president and CEO. He was involved in architectural design and the use of solar energy in residential homes. Early political career Grams launched his political career by winning the 1992 Republican nomination in Minnesota's 6th congressional district. He defeated Democratic incumbent Gerry Sikorski in the general election. During the campaign, Grams benefited from high name recognition in the district‚Äîfrom years as news anchor at KMSP-TV‚Äîand Sikorski's involvement in the House banking scandal. He served in the 103rd as a member of the House of Representatives, and 104th, 105th, and 106th congresses as a member of the U.S. Senate. U.S. Senate After David Durenberger announced he would not seek reelection, Grams surprised many by announcing, just months into beginning his first term in the U.S. House, that he would run for the U.S. Senate. However, Grams faced opposition for the Republican party endorsement from State Senator Gen Olson, Bert McKasy (former chief of staff to David Durenberger), and Doug McFarland. During the party endorsement process, the Grams campaign closely aligned itself with supporters of Allen Quist, who was challenging incumbent Governor Arne Carlson for reelection in the 1994 Gubernatorial race. Weeks before the Republican Party's state convention, McFarland dropped out of the US Senate race after endorsing Allen Quist for Governor and joining his ticket to become Quist's Lieutenant Governor running mate. Later, McFarland threw his support behind McKasy in the US Senate Republican Party endorsement campaign. After numerous ballots at the convention in St. Paul, Grams won the state Republican party endorsement against State Senator Gen Olson and Bert McKasy. Grams moved on to win the Republican primary against Arne Carlson's Lieutenant Governor Joanell Dyrstad, who had been replaced as his running mate with State Senator Joanne Benson. In the general election against Democratic Farm Labor candidate Ann Wynia and Independence Party candidate future Senator Dean Barkley, Grams won a close election (49% to 44%) to become Minnesota's next US Senator. Grams ran for re- election in 2000 as the incumbent, losing to Mark Dayton. During the campaign, Grams' wife Christine Gunhus was revealed to have written anonymous disparaging emails about Grams' potential Democratic rival, Mike Ciresi, from her home computer. She received a fine and suspended sentence for violating political advertising regulations. The Grams campaign also ran a commercial during the campaign featuring the mother of Rod Grams. The spot ended with Audrey Grams uttering, \\"Uffda, vote for Rod.\\" Post-Senate career After his 2000 re-election defeat, Grams went back into private business and in 2004 became the owner of three radio stations in Little Falls, Minnesota. Changing Hands - 5/17/2004 - Broadcasting & Cable Grams attempted a political comeback in the 2006 U.S. Senate campaign. He sought the GOP nomination for his former US Senate seat, facing Mark Kennedy and Gil Gutknecht. However, after a poor showing early in the endorsement process, Grams dropped his candidacy. Grams switched his political plans and ran in the 2006 U.S. House election, challenging the incumbent Jim Oberstar in Minnesota's 8th congressional district. Oberstar defeated Grams handily. Grams remained active in politics and interested in running for public office. In 2008, Grams considered challenging incumbent Norm Coleman for the Republican U.S. Senate nomination but was too busy in his private life to make a run, stating, \\"And my wife (Chris) would have killed me if I would have, because of some things that we're doing.\\" However, it became unclear whether Grams would run as a Republican. In an interview, he expressed disappointment over the perceived failings of the Republican Party, going as far as to ponder whether he can call himself a Republican or vote for party candidates anymore. Grams considered a 2010 run for Governor of Minnesota stating, \\"I'm so damn unhappy with the Republicans right now ... I'm so unhappy with the candidates that we have I could puke. I wanted to get out there and mix it up.\\"Rod Grams Thinking About Running for Governor However, Grams endorsed Republican Tom Emmer in the 2010 campaign for governor. Emmer, like Grams a decade before, lost to Mark Dayton. Illness and death On September 4, 2013, it was announced that Grams had been battling colon cancer since 2012 and was receiving hospice care at his home. He died on October 8, 2013, at his home in Crown, Minnesota, aged 65.

Its action is due to the bromide ion (sodium bromide is equally effective). Potassium bromide is used as a veterinary drug, as an antiepileptic medication for dogs. Under standard conditions, potassium bromide is a white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water; it is not soluble in acetonitrile. In a dilute aqueous solution, potassium bromide tastes sweet, at higher concentrations it tastes bitter, and tastes salty when the concentration is even higher. These effects are mainly due to the properties of the potassium ion‚Äîsodium bromide tastes salty at any concentration. In high concentration, potassium bromide strongly irritates the gastric mucous membrane, causing nausea and sometimes vomiting (a typical effect of all soluble potassium salts). Chemical properties Potassium bromide, a typical ionic salt, is fully dissociated and near pH 7 in aqueous solution. It serves as a source of bromide ions. This reaction is important for the manufacture of silver bromide for photographic film: :KBr(aq) + AgNO3(aq) ‚Üí AgBr(s) + KNO3(aq) Aqueous bromide Br‚àí also forms complexes when reacted with some metal halides such as copper(II) bromide: :2 KBr(aq) + CuBr2(aq) ‚Üí K2[CuBr4](aq) Preparation A traditional method for the manufacture of KBr is the reaction of potassium carbonate with an iron(III, II) bromide, Fe3Br8, made by treating scrap iron under water with excess bromine: :4 K2CO3 \\\\+ Fe3Br8 ‚Üí 8 KBr + Fe3O4 \\\\+ 4 CO2 Applications =Medical and veterinary= A bottle of PRN Pharmaceutical Company (Pensacola, FL) K‚Ä¢BroVet veterinary pharmaceutical potassium bromide oral solution (250 mg/mL). The product is intended to be used in dogs, primarily as an antiepileptic (to stop seizures). The pink color of the solution is artificial; pure potassium bromide solutions are colorless The anticonvulsant properties of potassium bromide were first noted by Sir Charles Locock at a meeting of the Royal Medical and Chirurgical Society in 1857. Bromide can be regarded as the first effective medication for epilepsy. At the time, it was commonly thought that epilepsy was caused by masturbation. Locock noted that bromide calmed sexual excitement and thought this was responsible for his success in treating seizures. In the latter half of the 19th century, potassium bromide was used for the calming of seizure and nervous disorders on an enormous scale, with the use by single hospitals being as much as several tons a year (the dose for a given person being a few grams per day). By the beginning of the 20th century the generic word had become so widely associated with being sedate that bromide came to mean a dull, sedate person or a boring platitude uttered by such a person. There was not a better epilepsy drug until phenobarbital in 1912. The British Army has historically been claimed to lace soldiers' tea with bromide to quell sexual arousal but that is likely untrue as doing so would also diminish alertness in battle. Similar stories exist about a number of substances. Bromide compounds, especially sodium bromide, remained in over-the-counter sedatives and headache remedies (such as the original formulation of Bromo-Seltzer) in the US until 1975, when bromides were outlawed in all over-the-counter medicines, due to chronic toxicity. Bromide's exceedingly long half life in the body made it difficult to dose without side effects. Medical use of bromides in the US was discontinued at this time, as many better and shorter-acting sedatives were known by then. Potassium bromide is used in veterinary medicine to treat epilepsy in dogs, either as first-line treatment or in addition to phenobarbital, when seizures are not adequately controlled with phenobarbital alone. Use of bromide in cats is limited because it carries a substantial risk of causing lung inflammation (pneumonitis) in them. The use of bromide as a treatment drug for animals means that veterinary medical diagnostic laboratories are able as a matter of routine to measure serum levels of bromide on order of a veterinarian, whereas human medical diagnostic labs in the US do not measure bromide as a routine test. Potassium bromide is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in humans to control seizures. In Germany, it is still approved as an antiepileptic drug for humans, particularly children and adolescents.German leaflet These indications include severe forms of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, early-childhood-related tonic‚Äìclonic seizures, and also severe myoclonic seizures during childhood. Adults who have reacted positively to the drug during childhood/adolescence may continue treatment. Potassium bromide tablets are sold under the brand name Dibro-Be mono (Rx-only). The drug has almost complete bioavailability, but the bromide ion has a relatively long half life of 12 days in the blood, making bromide salts difficult to adjust and dose. Bromide is not known to interfere with the absorption or excretion of any other anticonvulsant, though it does have strong interactions with chloride in the body, the normal body uptake and excretion of which strongly influences bromide's excretion. The therapeutic index (ratio of effectiveness to toxicity) for bromide is small. As with other antiepileptics, sometimes even therapeutic doses (3 to 5 grams per day, taking 6 to 8 weeks to reach stable levels) may give rise to intoxication. Often indistinguishable from 'expected' side-effects, these include: *Bromism These are central nervous system reactions. They may include: :depression, :lethargy, somnolence (from daytime sleepiness to coma) :loss of appetite and cachexia, nausea/emesis with exicosis (loss of body fluid) :loss of reflexes or pathologic reflexes :clonic seizures :tremor :ataxia :loss of neural sensitivity :paresis :cerebral edema with associated headache and papilledema of the eyes :delirium: confusion, abnormal speech, loss of concentration and memory, aggressiveness :psychosis *Acne-form dermatitis and other forms of skin disease may also be seen, as well as mucous hypersecretion in the lungs. Asthma and rhinitis may worsen. Rarely, tongue disorder, aphthous stomatitis, bad breath, and constipation occur. =Optics= Potassium bromide is transparent from the near ultraviolet to long-wave infrared wavelengths (0.25-25 ¬µm) and has no significant optical absorption lines in its high transmission region. It is used widely as infrared optical windows and components for general spectroscopy because of its wide spectral range. In infrared spectroscopy, samples are analyzed by grinding with powdered potassium bromide and pressing into a disc. Alternatively, samples may be analyzed as a liquid film (neat, as a solution, or in a mull with Nujol) between two polished potassium bromide discs. Due to its high solubility and hygroscopic nature it must be kept in a dry environment. The refractive index is about 1.55 at 1.0 ¬µm. =Photography= In addition to manufacture of silver bromide, potassium bromide is used as a restrainer in black and white developer formulas. It improves differentiation between exposed and unexposed crystals of silver halide, and thus reduces fog.

Biography Bassani was born in Bologna into a prosperous Jewish family of Ferrara, where he spent his childhood with his mother Dora, father Enrico (a doctor), brother Paolo, and sister Jenny. In 1934 he completed his studies at his secondary school, the liceo classico L. Ariosto in Ferrara. Music had been his first great passion and he considered a career as a pianist; however literature soon became the focus of his artistic interests. In 1935 he enrolled in the Faculty of Letters of the University of Bologna. Commuting to lectures by train (third class) from Ferrara, he studied under the art historian Roberto Longhi. His ideal of the \\"free intellectual\\" was the liberal historian and philosopher Benedetto Croce. Despite the anti-Semitic race laws which were introduced from 1938, he was able to graduate in 1939, writing a thesis on the nineteenth-century writer, journalist, radical and lexicographer Niccol√≤ Tommaseo. As a Jew in 1939, however, work opportunities were now limited and he became a schoolteacher in the Jewish School of Ferrara in via Vignatagliata. In 1940 his first book, Una citt√† di pianura (\\"A City of the Plain\\"), was published under the pseudonym \\"Giacomo Marchi\\" in order to evade the race laws. During this period, along with friends he had made in Ferrara's intellectual circle, he became a clandestine political activist. His activity in the anti-fascist resistance led to his arrest in May 1943; he was released on 26 July, the day after Benito Mussolini was ousted from power. A little over a week later he married Valeria Sinigallia, whom he had met playing tennis. They moved to Florence for a brief period, living under assumed names, then at the end of the year, to Rome, where he would spend the rest of his life. His first volume of poems, Storie dei poveri amanti e altri versi, appeared in 1944; a second, Te lucis ante, followed in 1947. He edited the literary review Botteghe oscure for Princess Marguerite Caetani from its founding in 1948 until it ceased publication in 1960. In 1953 La passeggiata prima di cena appeared and in 1954 Gli ultimi anni di Clelia Trotti. In the same year he became editor of Paragone, a journal founded by Longhi and his wife Anna Banti. Bassani's writings reached a wider audience in 1956 with the publication of the Premio Strega-winning book of short stories, Cinque storie ferraresi (the five stories are Lida Mantovani, La passeggiata prima di cena, Una lapide in via Mazzini, Gli ultimi anni di Clelia Trotti, and Una notte del '43). As an editorial director of Feltrinelli Bassani was responsible for the posthumous publication in 1958 of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's Il Gattopardo, a novel which had been rejected by Elio Vittorini at Mondadori, and Einaudi. It became one of the great successes of post-war Italian literature. Bassani's enthusiastic editing of the text, following instructions from (daughter of Benedetto) who had offered him the manuscript, later became controversial, however; recent editions have been published which follow the manuscript more closely.Tomasi di Lampedusa Giuseppe: Il Gattopardo Also in 1958 Bassani's novel Gli occhiali d'oro (made into a film in 1987) was published, an examination, in part, of the marginalisation of Jews and homosexuals. Together with stories from Cinque storie ferraresi (reworked and under the new title Dentro le mura (1973)) it was to form part of a series of works known collectively as Il romanzo di Ferrara, which explored the city, with its Christian and Jewish elements, its perspectives and its landscapes. The series includes: Il giardino dei Finzi-Contini (The Garden of the Finzi-Continis) (1962, Premio Viareggio prizewinner); Dietro la porta (1964); L'airone (1968) and L'odore del fieno (1972). These works realistically document the Italian Jewish community under Fascism in a style that manifests the difficulties of searching for truth in the meanderings of memory and moral conscience. In 1960 one of his short stories (Una notte del '43, from Cinque storie ferraresi) was adapted as the film Long Night in 1943. From 1965 to 1980, Giorgio Bassani was the president of the organization Italia Nostra. Bassani died in 2000 and was buried in the Jewish Cemetery in Ferrara. He was survived by his estranged wife Valeria and their two children Paola (born 1945-09-01) and Enrico (born 1949-06-29).

In a deterministic system, every action, or cause, produces a reaction, or effect, and every reaction, in turn, becomes the cause of subsequent reactions. The totality of these cascading events can theoretically show exactly how the system will exist at any moment in time. To understand this concept, start with a fairly small system. Visualize a set of three dominoes lined up in a row with each domino less than a domino's length away from its neighbors. Once the first domino has toppled, the third domino will topple because the second will topple upon being contacted by the first domino. Small deterministic systems are easy to visualize, but are necessarily linked to the rest of reality by an initial cause and/or final effect. To go back to the dominoes, something outside the system has to cause the first domino to topple. The last domino falling might cause something else outside the system to happen. And the system itself must be considered in isolation‚Äîif external forces such as hurricanes, earthquakes or the hands of nearby people were taken into consideration, the final domino toppling might not be a predetermined outcome. Complete isolation of a system is unrealistic, but useful for understanding what would normally happen to a system when the possibility of external influences is negligible. Complex physical systems are necessarily built using simpler ones, and using isolated systems as a starting model can help bridge the gap and aid in understanding. The domino example is developed in the Petri net computational model. This example assumes that dominoes toppling into each other behave deterministically. Even the above-mentioned external forces which might interrupt the system are causes which the system did not consider, but which could be explained by cause and effect in a larger deterministic system.  Some deterministic systems  * Classical physics is the deterministic system assumed in the domino example which scientists can use to describe all events which take place on a scale larger than individual atoms. Classical physics includes Newton's laws of motion, Classical electrodynamics, thermodynamics, the Special theory of relativity, the General theory of relativity, chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics. Some of these systems are complex, and events may be difficult to predict in practice, but if the starting conditions were known in enough detail, the outcomes of events in such systems could be predicted. * Nearly all electronic computers in use today are based on theoretical von Neumann computers or Turing machines, i.e.: they are devices that perform one small, deterministic step at a time. If all inputs are specified, the computer will always produce a particular output which is calculated deterministically. Computer scientists also study other models of computation including parallel computers (more than one deterministic step at a time), and quantum computers (which are based on non- deterministic quantum mechanical models). Computer systems or programs are often described as non-deterministic if their behavior depends on factors that cannot be predicted or reliably reproduced, such as the time of day or the speed at which the user enters data at the keyboard. This, however, is a somewhat different usage of the term. * Behaviorism, an approach to psychology based on the proposition that behavior can be researched scientifically without recourse to inner mental states, is usually considered to be deterministic and opposed to free will.  Non-deterministic systems  Events without natural causes cannot be part of a deterministic system. Whether such events actually occur is a matter of philosophical and scientific debate ‚Äì however, possible uncaused events include: *Random Quantum events :Quantum physics holds that certain events such as radioactive decay and movement of particles are completely random when taken at the level of single atoms or smaller. Schr√∂dinger's cat is a famous thought experiment in which a cat's survival cannot be determined theoretically before the experiment is done. For almost all everyday non-microscopic occurrences, however, the probability of such random events is extremely close to zero, and can be approximated to almost certainty with statistics using the correspondence principle. The philosophical consequences of quantum physics were once considered by many (including Albert Einstein) to be a major problem for the scientific method which traditionally used a strong version of scientific determinism (see Philosophy of science).  Systems with controversial classification  Some systems are particularly difficult to classify as deterministic or not, and have generated much philosophical debate. The major example would be human minds, and possibly animal minds too. Can people have free will if their minds are truly deterministic? Conversely, when deterministic computers are said to exhibit artificial intelligence, how are their minds similar to ours?  The entire universe  The larger the deterministic system, the longer the necessary chain of cause and effect. The entire universe may be considered as such a system, which creates its own philosophical questions (see Determinism).

An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the generative system represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator. \\"Generative art\\" often refers to algorithmic art (algorithmically determined computer generated artwork) and synthetic media (general term for any algorithmically-generated media), but artists can also make it using systems of chemistry, biology, mechanics and robotics, smart materials, manual randomization, mathematics, data mapping, symmetry, tiling, and more. You can see several modern examples of generative art here.  History  The use of the word \\"generative\\" in the discussion of art has developed over time. The use of \\"Artificial DNA\\" defines a generative approach to art focused on the construction of a system able to generate unpredictable events, all with a recognizable common character. The use of autonomous systems, required by some contemporary definitions, focuses a generative approach where the controls are strongly reduced. This approach is also named \\"emergent\\". Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds have noted the use of the term \\"generative art\\" in the broad context of automated computer graphics in the 1960s, beginning with artwork exhibited by Georg Nees and Frieder Nake in 1965: The first such exhibition showed the work of Nees in February 1965, which some claim was titled \\"Generative Computergrafik\\". While Nees does not himself remember, this was the title of his doctoral thesis published a few years later. The correct title of the first exhibition and catalog was \\"computer-grafik\\".Ness, Georg; Bense, Max: computer-grafik; Edition Rot 19; Stuttgart, 1965. \\"Generative art\\" and related terms was in common use by several other early computer artists around this time, including Manfred Mohr. The term \\"Generative Art\\" with the meaning of dynamic artwork-systems able to generate multiple artwork-events was clearly used the first time for the \\"Generative Art\\" conference in Milan in 1998. The term has also been used to describe geometric abstract art where simple elements are repeated, transformed, or varied to generate more complex forms. Thus defined, generative art was practised by the Argentinian artists Eduardo McEntyre and Miguel √Ångel Vidal in the late 1960s. In 1972 the Romanian-born Paul Neagu created the Generative Art Group in Britain. It was populated exclusively by Neagu using aliases such as \\"Hunsy Belmood\\" and \\"Edward Larsocchi.\\" In 1972 Neagu gave a lecture titled 'Generative Art Forms' at the Queen's University, Belfast Festival.Osborne, Harold, ed. The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Art, Oxford ; New York: Oxford University PressWalker, J. A. Glossary of art, architecture, and design since 1945 (3rd ed.), London; Boston: Library Association Publishing; G.K. Hall. In 1970 the School of the Art Institute of Chicago created a department called \\"Generative Systems.\\" As described by Sonia Landy Sheridan the focus was on art practices using the then new technologies for the capture, inter-machine transfer, printing and transmission of images, as well as the exploration of the aspect of time in the transformation of image information.Sheridan, Sonia Landy. Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas, Leonardo, 16(2), 1983. In 1988 Clauser Clauser, H. R. Towards a Dynamic, Generative Computer Art, Leonardo, 21(2), 1988. identified the aspect of systemic autonomy as a critical element in generative art: In 1989 Celestino Soddu defined the Generative Design approach to Architecture and Town Design in his book Citta' Aleatorie.Soddu, C. Citta' Aleatorie, Masson Publisher 1989 \\"\\" In 1989 Franke referred to \\"generative mathematics\\" as \\"the study of mathematical operations suitable for generating artistic images.\\"Franke, H. W.Mathematics As an Artistic-Generative Principle, Leonardo, Supplemental Issue, 1989. From the mid-1990s Brian Eno popularized the terms generative music and generative systems, making a connection with earlier experimental music by Terry Riley, Steve Reich and Philip Glass.Eno, B. Generative Music, In Motion Magazine From the end of the 20th century, communities of generative artists, designers, musicians and theoreticians began to meet, forming cross- disciplinary perspectives. The first meeting about generative Art was in 1998, at the inaugural International Generative Art conference at Politecnico di Milano University, Italy.Soddu, C. and Colabella, E. ed.s \\"Generative Art\\", Dedalo In Australia, the Iterate conference on generative systems in the electronic arts followed in 1999.http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~iterate/FI/index.html On-line discussion has centred around the eu-gene mailing list, which began late 1999, and has hosted much of the debate which has defined the field. These activities have more recently been joined by the Generator.x conference in Berlin starting in 2005. In 2012 the new journal GASATHJ, Generative Art Science and Technology Hard Journal was founded by Celestino Soddu and Enrica Colabella GASATHJ jointing several generative artists and scientists in the Editorial Board. Some have argued that as a result of this engagement across disciplinary boundaries, the community has converged on a shared meaning of the term. As Boden and Edmonds put it in 2011: In the call of the Generative Art conferences in Milan (annually starting from 1998), the definition of Generative Art by Celestino Soddu: Discussion on the eu-gene mailing list was framed by the following definition by Adrian Ward from 1999: A similar definition is provided by Philip Galanter: Types =Music= Johann Philipp Kirnberger's \\"Musikalisches W√ºrfelspiel\\" (Musical Dice Game) 1757 is considered an early example of a generative system based on randomness. Dice were used to select musical sequences from a numbered pool of previously composed phrases. This system provided a balance of order and disorder. The structure was based on an element of order on one hand, and disorder on the other.Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation, pp. 36 & 38n7. . The fugues of J.S. Bach could be considered generative, in that there is a strict underlying process that is followed by the composer. Similarly, serialism follows strict procedures which, in some cases, can be set up to generate entire compositions with limited human intervention.Lerdahl, Fred. 1988. \\"Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems\\".

In other works he has used chance operations to determine the coloration of grids.Tate Online Article about Fran√ßois MorelletGrace Glueck \\"Francois Morellet, Austere Abtractionism\\", New York Times, Feb. 22, 1985 Sol LeWitt created generative art in the form of systems expressed in natural language and systems of geometric permutation.

The Calmoduline Monument project is based on the property of a protein, calmodulin, to bond selectively to calcium. Exterior physical constraints (wind, rain, etc.) modify the electric potential of the cellular membranes of a plant and consequently the flux of calcium. However, the calcium controls the expression of the calmoduline gene.Intra-and Intercellular Communications in Plants, Millet & Greppin Editors, INRA, Paris, 1980, p.117. The plant can thus, when there is a stimulus, modify its ¬´ typical ¬ª growth pattern. So the basic principle of this monumental sculpture is that to the extent that they could be picked up and transported, these signals could be enlarged, translated into colors and shapes, and show the plant's ¬´ decisions ¬ª suggesting a level of fundamental biological activity.Space in profile/ L'espace de profil, Maurizio Bolognini works with generative machines to address conceptual and social concerns.Maurizio Bolognini, De l'interaction √† la d√©mocratie.

Martin Wattenberg pushed this theme further, transforming \\"data sets\\" as diverse as musical scores (in \\"Shape of Song\\", 2001) and Wikipedia edits (History Flow, 2003, with Fernanda Viegas) into dramatic visual compositions. The Canadian artist San Base developed a \\"Dynamic Painting\\" algorithm in 2002. Using computer algorithms as \\"brush strokes,\\" Base creates sophisticated imagery that evolves over time to produce a fluid, never-repeating artwork.San Base: About Since 1996 there have been ambigram generators that auto generate ambigrams =Software art= For some artists, graphic user interfaces and computer code have become an independent art form in themselves. Adrian Ward created Auto-Illustrator as a commentary on software and generative methods applied to art and design. =Architecture= In 1987 Celestino Soddu created the artificial DNA of Italian Medieval towns able to generate endless 3D models of cities identifiable as belonging to the idea.Celestino Soddu Soddu: \\"Italian Medieval Town\\" In 2010, Michael Hansmeyer generated architectural columns in a project called \\"Subdivided Columns ‚Äì A New Order (2010)\\". The piece explored how the simple process of repeated subdivision can create elaborate architectural patterns. Rather than designing any columns directly, Hansmeyer designed a process that produced columns automatically. The process could be run again and again with different parameters to create endless permutations. Endless permutations could be considered a hallmark of generative design. Michael Hansmeyer AIArtists: \\"Generative Art & Design Guide\\" =Literature= Writers such as Tristan Tzara, Brion Gysin, and William Burroughs used the cut-up technique to introduce randomization to literature as a generative system. Jackson Mac Low produced computer-assisted poetry and used algorithms to generate texts; Philip M. Parker has written software to automatically generate entire books. Jason Nelson used generative methods with speech-to-text software to create a series of digital poems from movies, television and other audio sources. =Live coding= Generative systems may be modified while they operate, for example by using interactive programming environments such as SuperCollider, Fluxus and TidalCycles, including patching environments such as Max/MSP, Pure Data and vvvv. This is a standard approach to programming by artists, but may also be used to create live music and/or video by manipulating generative systems on stage, a performance practice that has become known as live coding. As with many examples of software art, because live coding emphasises human authorship rather than autonomy, it may be considered in opposition to generative art. Theories =Philip Galanter= In the most widely cited theory of generative art, in 2003 Philip GalanterPhilip Galanter What is Generative Art? Complexity theory as a context for art theory, 2003 International Conference on Generative Art describes generative art systems in the context of complexity theory. In particular the notion of Murray Gell-Mann and Seth Lloyd's effective complexity is cited. In this view both highly ordered and highly disordered generative art can be viewed as simple. Highly ordered generative art minimizes entropy and allows maximal data compression, and highly disordered generative art maximizes entropy and disallows significant data compression. Maximally complex generative art blends order and disorder in a manner similar to biological life, and indeed biologically inspired methods are most frequently used to create complex generative art. This view is at odds with the earlier information theory influenced views of Max BenseBense, Max Aesthetica; Einfuehrung in die neue Aesthetik, Agis-Verlag and Abraham MolesMoles, Abraham. Information theory and esthetic perception, University of Illinois Press where complexity in art increases with disorder. Galanter notes further that given the use of visual symmetry, pattern, and repetition by the most ancient known cultures generative art is as old as art itself. He also addresses the mistaken equivalence by some that rule-based art is synonymous with generative art. For example, some art is based on constraint rules that disallow the use of certain colors or shapes. Such art is not generative because constraint rules are not constructive, i.e. by themselves they don't assert what is to be done, only what cannot be done.Galanter, Philip. Generative art and rules-based art., Vague Terrain (2006) =Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds= In their 2009 article, Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds agree that generative art need not be restricted to that done using computers, and that some rule-based art is not generative. They develop a technical vocabulary that includes Ele-art (electronic art), C-art (computer art), D-art (digital art), CA-art (computer assisted art), G-art (generative art), CG-art (computer based generative art), Evo-art (evolutionary based art), R-art (robotic art), I-art (interactive art), CI-art (computer based interactive art), and VR-art (virtual reality art). = Questions = The discourse around generative art can be characterised by the theoretical questions which motivate its development. McCormack et al. propose the following questions, shown with paraphrased summaries, as the most important: # Can a machine originate anything? Related to machine intelligence - can a machine generate something new, meaningful, surprising and of value: a poem, an artwork, a useful idea, a solution to a long-standing problem? # What is it like to be a computer that makes art? If a computer could originate art, what would it be like from the computer's perspective? # Can human aesthetics be formalised? # What new kinds of art does the computer enable? Many generative artworks do not involve digital computers, but what does generative computer art bring that is new? # In what sense is generative art representational, and what is it representing? # What is the role of randomness in generative art? For example, what does the use of randomness say about the place of intentionality in the making of art? # What can computational generative art tell us about creativity? How could generative art give rise to artefacts and ideas that are new, surprising and valuable? # What characterises good generative art? How can we form a more critical understanding of generative art? # What can we learn about art from generative art? For example, can the art world be considered a complex generative system involving many processes outside the direct control of artists, who are agents of production within a stratified global art market. # What future developments would force us to rethink our answers? Another question is of postmodernism‚Äîare generative art systems the ultimate expression of the postmodern condition, or do they point to a new synthesis based on a complexity-inspired world-view?Galanter, Philip.

Before its book publication, the novel was serialised in six issues (March‚ÄìAugust 1933) of The American Magazine as 13 For Dinner. The novel features Hercule Poirot, Arthur Hastings and Chief Inspector Japp. An American actress married to Lord Edgware asks Poirot to aid her in getting a divorce from her husband. Poirot agrees to help her, meeting her husband. That evening, the actress is seen at a dinner with thirteen guests, which has an associated superstition. By the next morning Lord Edgware and another American actress are found murdered, each at their own homes. Poirot investigates. The novel was well received at publication, in both London and New York, noting the clue that came from the chance remark of a stranger, calling it ingenious. A later review called it clever and unusual. Plot summary Attending a performance by impressionist Carlotta Adams, Hercule Poirot is approached by actress Jane Wilkinson. She requests his help in asking her husband Lord Edgware to divorce her. Poirot agrees, but is surprised to find that Edgware has already agreed to a divorce and sent a letter to his wife confirming this; Wilkinson denies receiving it. The following morning, Inspector Japp informs Poirot and his friend Arthur Hastings that Edgware was murdered at his home in Regent Gates the previous evening, stabbed in the neck. While Wilkinson was witnessed by Edgware's butler and his secretary visiting her husband that night, a morning newspaper reveals she attended a dinner party that evening, whose guests confirm this. Poirot soon becomes concerned for Adams' safety, recalling she could impersonate Wilkinson. She is found dead that same morning, from an overdose of Veronal. Seeking answers, Poirot makes note of a few facts: Bryan Martin, a former lover of Wilkinson before she met the wealthy Duke of Merton, bitterly describes her as an amoral person; Donald Ross, a guest at the party, witnessed her take a telephone call from someone that night; Adams possessed a pair of pince-nez, along with a gold case that contained the drug, which has a puzzling inscription in it; Edgware's nephew, Ronald Marsh, had been cut off from his allowance by his uncle three months earlier; a sum of francs in Edgware's possession has disappeared, along with the butler. Learning Adams had sent a letter to her sister in America before her death, Poirot makes a request for it. A copy is sent via telegram, from which it reveals that Adams was offered $10,000 to help with a small bet; Poirot suspects she was hired to impersonate Wilkinson. Japp soon arrests Marsh, based on this letter. Marsh denies hiring Adams or killing his uncle, but states that he and his cousin Geraldine went to Regent Gates on the night of the murder, where he spotted Martin entering the house while she was getting something for him. Poirot later receives the original letter in the post, and notes some oddities with it. Hastings attends a luncheon party along with Wilkinson and Ross, in which the guests talk about Paris of Troy. Wilkinson presumes they are talking of the French capital. Ross, puzzled by this, confides his concerns to Hastings. He later telephones Poirot, but is fatally stabbed before he can explain in detail. Seeking a theory, Poirot overhears a chance remark from a crowd leaving a theatre, which leads him to talk with Wilkinson's maid Ellis. Gathering the suspects together, Poirot reveals to all that the killer in all three murders is Jane Wilkinson. Her motive in killing Lord Edgware is that the Duke of Merton was an Anglo- Catholic and would not marry a divorced woman. She recruited Adams to impersonate her at the dinner party, while she killed her husband, and then killed Adams afterwards with a fatal dose of Veronal. The women met at a hotel to exchange clothing before and after the party. While waiting for Adams to return from the party, Wilkinson discovers a letter among Adams's belongings that had yet to be posted and tampered with it, to implicate the last man it mentions for the murders. Ross was killed because he realised that Wilkinson did not attend the dinner party; her ignorance on Greek mythology gave her away, as Adams had been knowledgeable on the subject and thus talked about it while impersonating her. Poirot reveals what led him to his theory: Wilkinson lied about receiving her husband's letter and used Poirot to prove she had no motive for his murder; the telephone call to Adams was to confirm if their deception had yet to be exposed; the pince-nez belong to Ellis, used in a disguise that she and Wilkinson wore to keep their hotel meetings secret; the gold case was created a week prior to the murder, not nine months as its inscription implied - Wilkinson had it made under a false name and then sent Ellis to collect it; a corner of a page in Adams' letter was torn by Wilkinson, changing the word \\"she\\" to \\"he\\", to falsely imply that Adams was hired by a man. He reveals that the butler stole the missing money, whom Marsh had witnessed entering Regent Gates to hide it elsewhere; his disappearance was because he panicked when the police sought another suspect. Wilkinson is arrested, and while in prison, writes to Poirot about wishing an audience for her hanging, having no anger or remorse at being foiled by him.

Present at his home on the night of the murder, and claims Wilkinson visited him. * Alton - Edgware's butler, who disappears after police begin looking for another suspect. * Ellis - Wilkinson's personal maid at her new accommodations. * Duke of Merton - A devout Anglo-Catholic, and the current love of Jane Wilkinson, whom he plans to marry. Alternative title Lord Edgware Dies is alternatively titled Thirteen at Dinner. This second title, used on American editions, arises from a superstition that sitting down thirteen to dinner means bad luck to the person who first leaves the table. The dinner at which Carlotta successfully impersonated Jane Wilkinson had an unexpected missing guest, leaving them thirteen instead of the invited fourteen. The superstition weighs heavily on young actor Donald Ross, but plays out for both him and Jane Wilkinson, and her impersonator. Literary significance and reception The Times Literary Supplement of 21 September 1933 reviewed the book positively, commenting on the fact that \\"it was the chance remark of a stranger in the street that put him on the right track. Three such murders, however, are enough to tax the powers of the most superhuman sleuth, and we do not grudge him one stroke of good fortune.\\" Isaac Anderson concluded his review in the 24 September 1933 issue of The New York Times Book Review by saying, \\"This story presents a most ingenious crime puzzle and a still more ingenious solution, all set forth with the consummate skill of which Agatha Christie is mistress.\\" Robert Barnard: \\"Deals with a social/artistic milieu rather off Christie's usual beat: aristocrats, actresses, socialites, rich Jews. The anti-Semitism is more muted than in the early thrillers, but still leaves a nasty taste (this is the last book in which it obtrudes). Otherwise clever and unusual, with the Hastings/Poirot relationship done less crudely than usual.\\" References to other works In chapter 7, Poirot mentions that he once found a clue, but since it was four feet long instead of four centimetres, nobody would believe in it. This is probably a reference to a situation which occurred in The Murder on the Links, where Poirot found a piece of lead-piping which he concluded was used to disfigure the victim's face so that it would be unrecognisable. Nevertheless, the artefact was described in that novel as a piece of lead-piping only two feet long. In chapter 19, the Duchess of Merton tells Poirot that Lady Yardly had told her about him. Lady Yardly had previously appeared in the short story, \\"The Adventure of the Western Star\\" from the Poirot Investigates collection. In chapter 25, Hastings tells Donald Ross that Poirot has left for an appointment relating to his investigation of another case, \\"the strange disappearance of an Ambassador's boots\\". When Poirot returns from the appointment, he tells Hastings that it was a case of cocaine smuggling, and that he had spent the last hour in a ladies' beauty parlor. This case sounds identical to the one in the Tommy and Tuppence story, \\"The Ambassador's Boots\\" from Partners in Crime (1929), except that Poirot mentions a girl with red hair (Hastings is often described by Poirot as partial to redheads), while the girl in \\"The Ambassador's Boots\\" has blonde hair, or black hair when in disguise. References to actual history, geography and current science The character of Carlotta Adams was based on the American dramatist Ruth Draper (1884‚Äì1956). In her Autobiography, Christie says, \\"I thought how clever she was and how good her impersonations were; the wonderful way she could transform herself from a nagging wife to a peasant girl kneeling in a cathedral. Thinking about her led me to the book Lord Edgware Dies.‚Äù Draper was also the inspiration for a character in the short story The Dead Harlequin, published in The Mysterious Mr. Quin (1930), where the character was called Aspasia Glen and was the murderer's accomplice, rather than the victim. In Chapter 7, Chief Inspector Japp mentions the Elizabeth Canning case which was a real kidnapping case that occurred in London in 1753. The case created a sensation at the time due to the inconsistencies in the victim's declarations and the alibis of the perpetrators. Japp mentions this case due to the peculiar fact that the suspect was seen at two places at the same time. In the novel Lady Edgware was seen at a dinner party at the same time that she was also seen visiting the victim. Similarly, in the Canning case the suspect, Mary Squires, was seen travelling at the time that Elizabeth Canning said that she had been imprisoned by her. Adaptations =Radio= John Moffatt starred as Poirot in a five-part BBC Radio 4 adaptation by Michael Bakewell directed by Enyd Williams and also starring Simon Williams as Captain Hastings and Nicola Pagett as Jane Wilkinson. =Film= The novel was first adapted in 1934 as an eighty-minute film directed by Henry Edwards for Real Art Productions. The film was the third to star Austin Trevor in the role of Poirot after his appearances in Alibi and Black Coffee, both in 1931. =Television= ;1985 adaptation The novel was first adapted for television as an eighty-seven-minute film in 1985, under the American version's title Thirteen at Dinner. It starred Peter Ustinov in one of his six appearances as Hercule Poirot, David Suchet as Chief Inspector Japp, and co-starred Faye Dunaway in the dual role of Jane Wilkinson and Carlotta Adams. The adaptation updated the setting of the story to contemporary times, rather than within the 1930s. ;2000 adaptation A second television adaptation of Lord Edgware Dies was created in 2000, as an episode for the series Agatha Christie's Poirot on 19 February 2000. It starred David Suchet in the role of Hercule Poirot, and was produced by Carnival Films. While remaining faithful to most of the plot of the novel, it featured a number of changes: * The investigation takes place after Poirot comes out of his retirement, following the events in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd. Hastings has recently returned from Argentina to find a new place for himself and his wife, following a financial mistake he made. * The adaptation adds Miss Lemon to the story, who assists Poirot in his investigation towards the end. In addition, Jenny Driver's first name is changed to Penny. * Poirot learns about Wilkinson attending the dinner party when she is interviewed by both himself and Japp. * Alton dies in an accident, when police attempt arrest him for the theft of the stolen money. * Donald Ross is a playwright instead of an actor. During the dinner party, he discusses at length about The Judgement of Paris, mainly because he plans to write a play on The Fall of Troy. Wilkinson knew of the discussion from Adams, but not the subject itself (Paris the character versus Paris the city), which trips her up when Ross talks about it at a luncheon meal with those involved in the case. His murder happens while talking to Poirot, who is visiting a hotel. * Four clues received significant changes in the adaptation: ** The gold case is made within London, and collected by Wilkinson in disguise. The inscription makes no mention of a location, while the initial is changed to \\"P\\". ** The pince-nez belong to Ellis, and were taken by Wilkinson so she could disguise herself as an old woman to conceal her meeting with Adams. They are mislaid when the women change clothes after the murder. ** Poirot is given Adams' letter in its entirety from her sister, and not a copy beforehand, after he meets her shortly after she arrives and learns Adams is dead ** The important clue that solves the case comes from Hastings, when he is correcting himself over who left the luncheon meal first. * Wilkinson remarks, before she is arrested after the denouement, on how she believes her crime will make her famous and likely lead to her receiving a waxworks at Madame Tussauds.

The adaptation changed the setting to a theatre in the city of Amiens, France, in the 1950s, made changes in a number of characters ‚Äì Christie's detectives were replaced by Commissaire Larosi√®re (Antoine Dul√©ry) and his clumsy assistant, Inspecteur Lampion (Marius Colluci), while the killer is glamorous actress Sarah Morlant (Maruschka Detmers), and the victim is Morlant's inconvenient husband is fellow actor Pierre Foug√®re (Jean-Marie Winling) ‚Äì and featured an additional murder subplot involving the theatre's concierge.

The offer of work came in 1930 when Mallowan's employer, Leonard Woolley, was proving difficult over his proposed marriage to Agatha and their wish that she should join her husband on the dig at Ur although the real opposition came from Leonard Woolley's difficult wife, Katharine (see the dedication to The Thirteen Problems). Thompson's dig was at Nineveh and Max joined the team there in September 1931 followed the next month by Agatha. The invitation was only confirmed after the Mallowans had joined Thompson for a weekend in the country near Oxford where they were subjected to a cross- country scramble on \\"the wettest day possible over rough country\\" followed by another test to ensure that neither Agatha nor Max were fussy eaters. These were to ensure that both could withstand the rigours of a season in the wilds of Iraq. Used to walking over Dartmoor and having a very healthy appetite, Agatha passed the tests with flying colours. The relationship between the Mallowans and the Thompsons was far more relaxed than it had been with the Woolleys. The only source of contention was that Thompson was notoriously frugal with money and questioned every expense. Horses were a vital part of the expedition but Thompson only bought poor, badly-trained animals. He nevertheless insisted that Max ride them with skill as to fall off one would mean that \\"not a single workman will have a scrap of respect for you\\". Christie's clash with Thompson in regards to this facet of his character was over her insistence on purchasing a solid table to place her typewriter on in order that she could complete her next book. Not seeing why she couldn't use orange boxes, Thompson was aghast at her personal expenditure of ten pounds on a table at a local bazaar (although Max's recollection in his own memoir was that three pounds was the sum.) and he took some two weeks to recover his temper over this 'extravagance'. After this though, he made frequent polite enquiries over the progress of the book, Lord Edgware Dies, which was dedicated to him and his wife. A skeleton found on the dig was named 'Lord Edgware'. A singular honour that Christie bestowed on the Thompsons was to read aloud the manuscript of the book to them, something that she normally only ever did to her family (See External Links below). =Dustjacket blurb= The blurb on the inside flap of the dustjacket of the first edition (which is also repeated opposite the title page) reads: \\"Supper at the Savoy! Hercule Poirot, the famous little detective, was enjoying a pleasant little supper party there as the guest of Lady Edgware, formerly Jane Wilkinson, a beautiful young American actress. During the conversation Lady Edgware speaks of the desirability of getting rid of her husband. Lord Edgware, since he refuses to divorce her, and she wants to marry the Duke of Merton. M. Poirot jocularly replies that getting rid of husbands is not his speciality. Within twenty-four hours, however, Lord Edgware dies. This amazing story once more reveals Agatha Christie as the perfect teller of Detective stories. It will be difficult indeed to lay down the book until one learns the true solution of the mystery.\\" References External links *Lord Edgware Dies at Agatha Christie website *Lord Edgware Dies at the official Agatha Christie website British Museum webpage on the Mallowans' work with Dr and Mrs Campbell Thompson 1933 British novels Hercule Poirot novels Novels first published in serial form Works originally published in The American Magazine Novels about actors Collins Crime Club books British novels adapted into films Novels adapted into television shows ","title":"Lord Edgware Dies"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:B}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},M={class:"card-container"};function I(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=g("PoemCard");return t(),o(l,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ Your Movie Collectionü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",M,[(t(!0),o(l,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(t(),b(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(x,[["render",I]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/59.md","filePath":"sponsor/59.md"}'),L={name:"sponsor/59.md"},E=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{F as __pageData,E as default};
