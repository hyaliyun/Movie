The buildings are the administrative center for the wildlife management area, which extends across a large part of Anoka and Chisago counties, as well as for a number of other Minnesota Department of Natural Resources properties in the area. The nomination for the NRHP noted that when it opened in 1937, it was one of the largest and best-equipped game farms in the nation, as well as one of the first large-scale wildlife management efforts in Minnesota. The refuge was named after Carlos Avery (1868-1930), executive agent of the Minnesota Game and Fish Commission from 1907 to 1909 and 1915 to 1923. It was established with obtained from the Crex Carpet Company. The carpet company had harvested a wire grass from the land for use in the manufacture of rugs. The land was tax forfeited in 1933 and then purchased by the Minnesota Conservation Commission. Carlos Avery game farms were formally opened and dedicated to the former game warden in 1938.Minnesota Conservationist, January 1, 1939, p.4+ The land was ideal for production of bobwhite quail, which had been plentiful in Minnesota but was on the decline. In 1935, the United States government asked states to submit projects for relief of unemployment. The game refuge was approved by the Works Progress Administration and established by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The refuge was outfitted with five buildings, including a central heating plant and pumphouse, two houses, a combination barn/henhouse, and an incubation room. Other functional areas in the refuge included a sanctuary for wild birds and animals, a nursery, and room for public hunting. Production of bobwhite quail began with 200 pairs of birds raised in a game farm in Mound, Minnesota. The first breeding resulted in 1879 birds, with 1000 of them retained for future breeding and the release of the rest. The bobwhite quail project continued until 1955. The refuge also hosted breeding for chukar partridge from 1939 through 1947, ring-necked pheasants from 1947 through 1981, and the reintroduction of the Canada goose from 1950 through 1970. In 1981, though, the management philosophy changed. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources discontinued large-scale breeding programs and changed its focus to improving habitat and providing nesting cover and food. As of 2009, the wildlife management area contains a sanctuary that is closed to all hunting and trespassing. Outside the sanctuary, the primary recreational opportunities include hunting for waterfowl, deer, and squirrels. It also provides trapping for mink, muskrats, raccoons, and beavers. More than 272 species of birds are attracted to the refuge, providing popular opportunities for bird watching. Colonial Revival buildings were built between 1936-41.

It is one of the oldest and best known in the world. It introduced features such as no-haggle pricing and a mail order catalog. It is located along the famous Bahnhofstrasse in Zürich.  History  The original store was founded in 1833 by Johann Peter Jelmoli Ciolina as a fashion shop. The original property was in the Schipfe, Zürich's oldest continually inhabited district, on the river Limmat. The store opened with the new concept of fixed prices where prices were posted and no price negotiation was expected. Thanks to immediate success, expansion began in earnest in the mid-1880s by Jelmoli's descendants. The company founded in 1896 became a limited company (SA Jelmoli department stores in 1899) to raise capital for the construction of a new department store. The shipping business began in 1897 with the first mail order catalog as a retail store with shipping. The new store was designed as a glass palace after Parisian department stores and became the new headquarters of Jelmoli. The building was completed in 1898 at the site of the former silk farms with 72 employees. Gradually, and with major expansions in 1931–1938, 1947, and 1958–1961, grew into a glass palace with a closed courtyard. Due to the construction history, the exterior style differs significantly on two faces. Razing of adjacent properties (stone mill, vehicle fuel station) led to construction of the store's car park, and created new commercial space where, among other businesses, the Hiltl, the oldest vegetarian restaurant in Switzerland now exists. In 1952, management was reorganized to begin building a chain of stores, which opened the first store in 1954 in Oerlikon, followed by at least 50 more Jelmoli department stores throughout Switzerland. In 1963, Romandie Jelmoli expanded through the acquisition of stores in Lausanne and Au Grand Passage Geneva. In 1968, a second store in Lausanne (Sébeillon) was completed. The diversification of the department store group began in 1972 with the construction of Jelmoli Travel, the Molino restaurant chain, and Terlinden-Jelmoli dry cleaners. Jelmoli Group reached its zenith in 1988 at 231 locations, 5200 employees and a gross revenue of 1471 million Swiss Francs. In the 1990s, sales and profits were steadily declining in all department stores industry wide, part of a Swiss consumer spending change. As a result, in 1995–1996, Jelmoli pulled back significantly from the department store business, closing all stores except the glass palace in Zürich. Thus, the distribution centers were unnecessary, and the majority of the Jelmoli shipping was sold. Since 1997, Jelmoli brands itself as a shop-within-a-shop gallery under the slogan \\"The House of Brands\\".

Fram was founded in 1889, and after a down period around 1900 it was refurbished as an exclusive gentlemen's social club in a skiing setting. Early years, 1889–c.1900 The club was founded on 24 November 1889 at Framnæs near Skillebekk, whence the Fearnley family had moved here the same year. The club was named after the property, and is thus one of very few Norwegian sports clubs named Fram not to derive its name from Nansen's vessel. The founders were ten young boys; Harald Andresen, N. O. Young Fearnley, Thomas Fearnley, Jr., Jens P. Heyerdahl, Waldemar Kallevig, Gerhard Kallevig, William Schiøtt, Johs Schiøtt, Søren Christian Sommerfelt and Sverre Smith (died in 1892). Sommerfelt served as the first chairman.Waldemar Kallevig in Fram, 1940: pp. 15–20 A few new members were admitted before the turn of the century; Barthold A. Butenschøn, Sr. and Oscar Collett in 1890, Giert Giertsen and August Walle- Hansen in 1891, Westye Parr Egeberg in 1895 and Fritz Mowinckel in 1898. August Walle-Hansen became the second chairman in 1895, succeeding Sommerfelt.Løvenskiold, 1964: p. 85 Fram participated in skiing contests while the boys were in school. Jens P. Heyerdahl was the most skilled member, but none of Fram's members competed at a high international level. The club did draft some skilled skiers in the 1890s, but their tenure as club members was short.Waldemar Kallevig in Fram, 1940: pp. 38–41 Its closest rival club was SK Ondur. The somewhat older skiing clubs Christiania SK, SK Ull and SK Skuld were similar in structure to both Fram and Ondur, but attracted people from an older age segment.Qvale, 1989: p. 7 Christiania SK was the outspoken ideal of the Fram founders, as this club had achieved sporting success and already owned its own skiing cabin in Nordmarka. Fram rented cabin space at Øvre Tangen from 1893, thus becoming neighbors with Ondur, but in 1895 they acquired their own cabin near the lake Skjennungen. A cabin was designed by architect von Hanno, built downtown and then transported to the lakeside. The nearby hills Fossekneika and Skjennungsbakken were used for ski jumping. The club badge is circular, encapsulating the word Fram as well as a ski, a knapsack and a torch. It was designed by Kristofer Sinding-Larsen.Waldemar Kallevig in Fram, 1940: p. 169 1902–1945 After the base of club founders left the city to take higher education, activity dwindled and the cabin was sold. In 1902 the club was revived and a new cabin, Framhytten, erected near Harestuvannet in Oppland. The skiing activities of Fram were resumed, but more noticeably Fram evolved into an exclusive gentlemen's club, with a maximum of 25 members according to the by-laws. By 1914 it did not even fill its quota; with the club having 22 members. In addition to seven of the founding members and all the five members admitted in the 1890s, the members were Anders Beer, Johan Collett, Einar Westye Egeberg, Jr., Johan Heiberg, Carlos Jakhelln, Otto Nyquist, Herbert Plahte, Viktor Plahte and Thor Thoresen. Fram also nurtured close ties to the Swedish royal family while Norway was subject to a personal union with its neighbor country. Fram elected the Swedish princes Gustav Adolf and Vilhelm as honorary members in 1904, the year before Norway decided to abolish the personal union.Qvale, 1989: pp. 9–11 Thomas Fearnley served as chairman from 1901 to 1904. Westye Parr Egeberg then served from 1905 to 1915, interrupted for one year by Jens P. Heyerdahl. Thomas Fearnley took over the chair in 1915, and sat until 1960. He was succeeded by Arne Meidell, who died in 1963; Johannes Brun took over. Known deputy chairmen were Westye Parr Egeberg from 1924 to 1959, Arne Meidell from 1959 to 1960, Johannes Brun from 1960 to 1963 and Einar Trumpy from 1963. In 1922 Fram left its premises in Oppland and bought a cabin near Svartor. The cabin was designed by Thorvald Astrup, and inaugurated on 20 December 1923. Large proprietor Harald Løvenskiold was invited as a guest, N. O. Young Fearnley in Fram, 1940: pp. 22–38 and the first Løvenskiold family member (Carl) had joined Fram in 1922. Fram after 1945 By 1964, the club had shed its last traces of being a competitive skiing club, and had become a gentlemen's social club. The members ranged in age from 47 to 90.Løvenskiold, 1964: p. 88 The last living founder, Jens P. Heyerdahl, died in 1970.Qvale, 1989: p. 64 Fram steadily accepted new members, and in 1961 it was decided to incorporate the club Dovre into Fram, with Dovre's members entering Fram successively over a four-year period.

This page focuses on the rules pertaining to bastardy that became law in the New England colonies of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania from the early seventeenth century to the late eighteenth century. The colonies established many of their laws based on a combination of old English common law and their religious faith. Upon their arrival in North America, European settlers established rules to guide society. Many of these rules strongly resembled the established guidelines set forth by England. Although the laws differed initially in their creation and enforcement, by late eighteenth century, the New England colonies and the colony of Pennsylvania had altered their laws pertaining to bastardy to be mirror images of the laws in effect in England.  Criminal act of bastardy defined  A bastard is defined as a \\"(child) born out of wedlock or of adultery, illegitimate.\\" In other words, a bastard is any child that is born from the result of a sexual encounter between a man and a woman who are not married. However, bastards may also be born to a couple that involved a married man or woman and an unmarried man or woman. In these cases, people had committed adultery. In the eyes of the law, any child conceived by a couple that was not legally married was a bastard child. Bastard children were also known as illegitimate children, meaning that they legally had no standing in society. English and colonial America also had laws governing sexual activity between individuals. If two people had sexual intercourse without being married, then they had committed the crime of fornication. Typically, fornication and bastardy laws went hand in hand, as in most instances a case of bastardy did not exist without individuals having committed fornication. Regardless of conception, a bastard child fell under the governing rules of the land’s bastardy laws. After a bastard child’s birth, a trial for fornication or adultery usually followed. In England, churches saw a bastard child as the probable outcome for any case of fornication or adultery. Depending on location, bastardy laws appeared differently as each individual colony had separate rules on the subject. However, each colonial law regarding fornication, adultery, and bastardy took shape from the old English common law.  Bastardy in English common law  Common law refers to decisions that apply throughout a region. A judge or magistrate normally comes to a decision on a particular case, then that decision becomes the basis for future decisions on similar cases. In England, evidence of common law existed as early as the tenth century. By 1135, most of the legal language used in legal decisions had appeared within the country. By the mid 1070s ecclesiastical courts heard cases that involved bastardy. Bastard children, according to English common law, were filius nullius, which meant that they were no one’s child. They could not make any claim on their parents for support nor was anyone indebted by law to take care of them. In public opinion, bastards had extremely low social standing. Depending on the social and economic status of a bastard’s parents, the bastard’s situation could be drastically different. The bastards of wealthy and influential figures were in many cases taken care of by their birth mothers and given financial support by their fathers. The bastard children of lower families had to rely on relations for survival. The worst cases, the \\"fatherless poor,\\" lived off the charity of monasteries and municipalities that could lead aid. The monastery provided food and shelter, while the municipality handled the money that pious people gave to the poor. Towns also raised money for the poor. In 1531, the first statute in England regarding bastardy came into existence. This law, known as Henry VIII’s Old Poor Law, defined who bastards were, and what their treatment was. Bastards were defined as a \\"Fatherless Poor Man’s Child.\\" Around 1531 in London, Christ’s Hospital was built with specific instructions to provide care for bastard children. Under Tudor rule, bastards were the responsibility of the community as they were no one’s child yet still required care. By 1574, the large amount of bastard children began to overload the monasteries and municipalities that were responsible for them. In that year, another statute regarding bastards allowed justices to issue bastardy orders that ordered that the reputed father of the bastard child pay the parish for care of the child. Thus began a new common law precedent that required that the father of a bastard child, once legally determined, be financially responsible for their child. Further Poor Law decrees came in 1563, 1572, 1576, 1579, and 1601. Within the new rules municipalities gained the power to raise poor rates, select Collectors for the Poor and Guardians of the Poor, and to stop any illicit action within the governing body of a charitable organization. While under common law, bastard children still held the filii nullius label, but they often became \\"children of the parish\\" or \\"children of the borough,\\" as those institutions became the ones responsible for the children’s well being. Further Acts of 1575 and 1609 declared that the mother of any bastard child would face corporal punishment or be placed in an English \\"House of Correction.\\" Under English common law, the burden of taking care of any illegitimate child frequently fell on a church or the community in which the bastard lived. Only near the beginning of the seventeenth century did fathers of bastard children really start having to be responsible for the illegitimate children. English common law focused strongly on the legal issues surrounding bastard children, and thus created bastardy rules on those principles. In the New England colonies and the colony of Pennsylvania, the old English common law earned respect and a place in establishing the rules of the colonies, but the colonists added new elements to their new legal system.  Bastardy in the New England and Pennsylvania colonies   The establishment of law in the colonies  During the seventeenth century, when settlers started establishing permanent settlements in North America, decisions needed to be made concerning how the new legal system would work. The people who established the New England colonies came to the new world so they could create a new society that fashioned itself on the rules and teachings of their religion. The Puritans who founded the colonies of Connecticut and Massachusetts created many rules that had basis in the Puritan faith. However, differences occurred within each colony as to the application of the law. For example, laws created in Massachusetts or Connecticut differed from laws created in Pennsylvania. Some of the differences in the rules within colonies came from the fact that different groups with different ideological backgrounds founded each colony. The Puritans founded the New England colonies, while the Quakers led by William Penn founded the colony of Pennsylvania. Due to the strong religious background of these colonies, colonists sought changes and improvements to the English common law. In many situations, the colonists would use a particular aspect of common law to build the foundation of a legal principle, but the details, such as the wording, implementation, and enforcement of said law fell to the colonists. The colonists did not want a carbon copy of English common law, as many of them left England and Europe in dispute of those laws, nor did the colonists decide upon a single, unified set of laws to govern the colonies as a large group. The colonies sought the means to create a legal system that looked out for each individual colony’s interests. If English common law coincided with what the colonists wanted, then the law remained unaltered. However, if the common law did not represent all of what the colonists wanted, they sought the freedom to change laws to something that best suited them.  Women's rights/position under common law in colonies  Married women during colonial times in America fell under the English governance rule of feme covert. This meant that a married woman had no separate legal identity from that of her husband. A woman's wages, children, clothes, inheritances, and even her body fell under control of her husband. Despite the feme covert status, women still had dealings with the legal system in colonial America. In the colony of Connecticut, women, because of the Puritan influence within the colony, still affected the law and courtroom decisions. Women contributed to court cases, as they were witnesses, litigants, and criminal defendants. This was not the case in all colonies in North America, but serves as proof that although women did not have nearly as many rights as their male counterparts, they still played a role in deciding how cases, including bastardy, were ruled.  The crime of bastardy  Men and women had equal roles in creating a situation where bastardy laws had to be enforced. All cases of bastardy heard before colonial courts were the direct result of an act of adultery or fornication. Early in colonial history, men took more of the responsibility for an act of fornication or a bastardy charge. Women before the courts claimed that they engaged in sexual activity with men and explained to the courtroom that if somehow they ended up pregnant as a result that the man would marry them, thus preventing the birth of a bastard child. A child being born out of wedlock automatically resulted in a trial to determine who the father was and who and how the bastard would be cared for. To catch fornicators, one had to either find the couple committing the act, or the couple had to immediately confess their sin. Someone finding a pair engaged in fornication was rare. Thus, many times court cases relied on confessions to bring about charges in a case of bastardy. By 1668 in the Massachusetts colony and others, the government enforced the practice of having midwives interrogate women during childbirth. It was believed that women endured so much anguish during childbirth that they would not lie and truthfully confess to their sin of fornication and reveal who the baby’s father was. Either the pregnant women would willingly tell someone that she had a bastard son, and then she would name the father or a midwife would ask the mother to tell whether or not her child was legitimate. Bastardy cases in the colonies involved women of high, low, and middle standing, similarly to England. Once a bastard child was born, women could not deny a charge of adultery, or more common a charge of fornication. The baby was undeniable proof that an illicit sexual act took place. Where the courts did have trouble was in determining who the father of the bastard was. While the courts believed women to be truthful during their childbirth confession, they were not always entirely. A woman could name a man who was later revealed to not be the baby’s father. Such situations resulted in disputed paternity suits. In some cases, men asked women to deny their involvement and charge another man. While the courts initially relied on confessions to make judgments in bastardy cases, as it became apparent that the confessions could be dishonest, the courts gradually came to trust evidence-based claims more so than testimony-based claims. In the latter half of the eighteenth century, this trend reflected a growing shift in colonial courts as a movement away from more faith-based rules and towards law grounded more in English common law. In the 1650s, when the colonial courts reached a verdict in cases of adultery or fornication, the guilty parties had to pay fines ranging from forty shillings to ten pounds and were publicly struck with a whip six to fifteen times. By the 1680s, the fine usually amounted to forty shillings or ten blows of the whip. These punishments became standard procedure by 1692. From 1639–1666, in Connecticut, if a father did not willingly come forward to acknowledge his illegitimate child, the mother of the bastard received a public whipping. The thought was that the male would not stand idly by and watch the mother of his child receive such a harsh punishment and public humiliation. Not all individuals who committed acts of fornication and bastardy ended up in front of a court. To avoid the penalties and shame of having a bastard child, men and women took different steps to avoid pregnancy while engaging in sexual behavior. Over the eighteenth century, many colonial courts practiced greater regulation of women's sexuality and focused fornication prosecutions almost entirely on women.  Attempts to conceal crimes of bastardy  In colonial times, it was difficult to hide a pre- marital pregnancy. Even during cases of disputed paternity, one irrefutable fact was that a baby had been born and legally had no father. Men could avoid the label of “father” if the pregnant woman chose to hide or conceal the truth from her midwife or the courts. Trying to avoid the bastardy or fornication laws seemed the easiest thing to do in order to avoid the stigmas attached to being guilty of fornication and bastardy. Both parents or each parent individually could flee the region. The reputed father had the option of arranging a private settlement with the mother to avoid publicly being a bastard's father. Abortions, concealing births, tricked marriages, and bribery were used to help conceal crimes of bastardy. Other methods of preventing bastardy existed, but not widely used. Birth control existed within colonial America, but due to a lack of understanding of human anatomy, attempts at preventing pregnancy during this time often failed. Coitus interruptus, which meant that the male withdrew before ejaculating, was not a useful method of birth control. Nor were barrier methods of contraception. Condoms existed, but males used them to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. People during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries did not understand that condoms had other uses, such as a method to prevent pregnancy. Males and females also made promises of abstinence, but that also did not always work as it should. To avoid bastardy, the couple had the option of engaging in infanticide, the purposeful murder of a baby. Typically, parents who engaged in infanticide used it as an absolute last resort to cover up a pre-marital pregnancy. In Pennsylvania, infanticide, defined legally, was concealing the death of a bastard child. There were laws in place against infanticide in each colony. However, establishing that infanticide took place proved difficult. Instances such as a child being born stillborn or the jury of a court understanding a single mothers plight made cases of infanticide tough to prosecute. Options did exist for colonists to attempt to escape from bastardy and fornication charges, although many of those choices lead to less than desirable outcomes.  Evolution of bastardy laws in the New England and Pennsylvania colonies  Bastardy laws existed both in English common law and within the laws of the colonies. Colonial law, though, tried to establish a balance between common law and religious faith. As time passed, the legal precedents shifted, and the religious themes and tones within the law disappeared in favor of more legal terminology. By the late eighteenth century, bastardy cases became exclusive to courts, and heard by judges and juries. Statutes in the colonies, similarly to in England, held that the reputed father, once determined, had to contribute financially to the bastard child. As the law evolved, from 1690–1740, the burden of proof in any case changed from witness testimony to evidence presented in court. As the eighteenth century progressed, more and more faith aspects of law creation and enforcement began to fade away from court decision in the New England and Pennsylvania Colonies. The establishment of a basic system for regulating bastardy cases came in 1705, and went largely unchanged until 1828. This system essentially put into official writing the implementation and enforcement of bastardy laws that had existed prior to 1705. The bastardy case needed presentation before the court, the paternity needed a decision, and then child support was given to the appropriate figures. The legal precedents created here faced evolution as the situation in colonial America changed. As true in England as rural towns gave way to urban cities, laws such as bastardy needed to be refined to fit the conditions of the colonies. As cities grew, the responsibility for bastards shifted from being solely the mother’s responsibility to being the community’s ward as well. The almshouse, a place for bastards to go and receive care opened in Philadelphia in 1767. Its goal was to provide assistance for mothers and bastards without parents. Other groups, such as the Overseers of the Poor, came into prominence in the 1760s in Philadelphia. Overseers of the Poor functioned as the colonial version of England’s Guardians of the Poor. The Overseers of the Poor’s job included providing aid for those in need, including bastard children. Situations where the mother and father of the bastard could provide financial support and shelter for their bastard child were ideal; it often did not prove to be the case. Someone else needed to be responsible for bastards and others in need. Closely resembling England’s Guardians of the Poor, groups such as the Overseers of the Poor’s job included making sure fathers paid financial support to mothers or the ones in charge of the bastard child. Through the 1760s and the 1770s, the Overseers of the Poor regulated bastardy. The courts made decisions on bastardy cases, and left the enforcement of any ruling given to the Overseers of the Poor. By 1767, the Overseers of the Poor documented all cases of bastardy that they dealt with, thus making sure that no bastard child or other individual in need went unnoticed. The Overseers of the Poor’s primary goal was to regulate child support, not hand out punishments for sexual crimes committed by the parents. That task still fell on the courts to take care of, but by the end of the eighteenth century, the courts had all but stopped prosecuting sexual behavior crimes. The weekly support payment for bastard children in the time shortly before the Revolutionary War broke out was approximately three shillings, or roughly seven pounds and sixteen shillings per year. The father was not legally obligated to give any financial compensation to the mother, only the bastard child. That amount was hardly enough to adequately take care of a child, but it still provided mothers and the Overseers of the Poor a monetary amount to work with. If the amounts collected by the Overseers of the Poor turned out to not be enough, mothers and bastard children had the option of going to the almshouse, although many did not unless the situation was dire. The situation in colonial America had finished its transformation from a more faith based legal system to one that copied many aspects of English common law. More changes were to come to the colonies, as all thirteen colonies waged a war against England for independence known as the Revolutionary War. Having won their freedom, the colonies then had to decide how they wanted to proceed in establishing their own country under their own laws. From 1776 on, the laws created in the early seventeenth century were going to face even more changes as the country grew and new legal precedents were established.

He also made six appearances in amateur internationals for Wales and one full international appearance against Scotland in 1923. Football career Davies was born in Ewloe Green, Flintshire, the son of a Presbyterian minister and educated at Abergele County School. During the First World War, he enlisted in the London Scottish Battalion and was later in the Gordon Highlanders, playing football for both regiments. After he was demobbed, he joined Conway of the North Wales Coast League before returning to his place of birth with Buckley United, who were playing in the West Cheshire League. His performances with Buckley brought him to the attention of larger clubs, including West Bromwich Albion in 1919. Although Albion were keen to sign him, Davies was reluctant to travel to the West Midlands on a regular basis. At this time he was working in a bank, who transferred him to a branch in Southport where he joined the local club, who were then playing in the Football League Third Division North, in December 1920. He made nine appearances for Southport, scoring four goals, in the 1921–22 season. He then joined Crosby club Marine, where he remained for two years. He had made his first international appearance for Wales as an amateur (against England) in 1921; in his next appearance at this level, in January 1923, he scored three goals against England. Described as \\"a clever forward\\", he led the line \\"with spirit and tact\\" and was \\"equally adept at the short passing game or swinging the ball out to the wings\\". His performance earned him a call-up to the full Wales team to play Scotland in March 1923. This match clashed with a full Football League programme and as a result most of the players who had earned a draw against England two weeks earlier were unavailable; the \\"patched-up\\" team were no match for the full-strength Scots who ran out 2–0 victors, with both goals coming from Andrew Wilson. In the summer of 1923 he briefly joined Rhyl before moving to Liverpool in August. He made no appearances for the Liverpool first team and in December 1924 he signed as an amateur for Bolton Wanderers where he made three appearances in the Football League First Division. He then returned to Rhyl for two years, before finishing his playing career at the \\"Welsh Dragons\\". He played for the Welsh amateurs in each of the matches against England in 1924, 1925 and 1926 as well as against South Africa in 1925. Later career By 1930, his playing career was over and he concentrated on his employment as a representative with Hartley's Jams in the north-west, before becoming south of England area manager. He later emigrated to South Africa, where he died in June 1980.

History In the 1590s, Laurens Baudains - a wealthy farmer from St. Martin, lobbied the monarch and the States of Jersey to support a scheme for the establishment of a college. The aim of the project was to instruct the youth of Jersey in \\"grammar, latin, the liberal arts and religion\\". In the 1860s, the ancient grammar schools of St. Mannelier and St. Anastase closed and their endowments were later used to fund scholarships at Victoria College. The situation for the education of girls in Jersey from the mid-19th century lagged behind provision for boys. Victoria College had been opened for boys, on the pattern of English public schools, in 1852. The well-to-do and the élite classes continued to employ governesses or to send their daughters to schools in France or England; other classes relied on the existing elementary schools in Jersey. Jersey people of influence gathered at the Grove Place Wesleyan Chapel in Saint Helier on 28 November 1879 and decided to set up a limited liability company to further a plan to provide a college for girls in Jersey. Towards the end of the 19th century Catholic teaching and nursing orders — the De La Salle brothers, Jesuits and Little Sisters of the Poor — settled in Jersey. In 1894, the Jesuits bought a property called Highlands, which later became Highlands College. In 1917, the De La Salle Brothers founded De La Salle College, Jersey. In 2012, it was announced that the headteacher of Hautlieu School would also become the head of Highlands College, after the retirement of Highlands' Principal and Chief Executive Professor Ed Sallis, OBE.Jersey's Hautlieu school and Highlands college get joint principal  Schools  The States of Jersey provides education through state schools (including a fee-paying option at secondary level) and also supports private schools. The Jersey curriculum generally follows that of England. * There are 31 primary schools, of which 22 are non-fee paying, and 17 offer a nursery class. * 4 non-fee paying schools offer 11-16 secondary education, along with 2 States fee-paying and 2 independent schools. * 6 schools and colleges provide options for post-16 education.  Further and higher education  Jersey has a college of further education and university centre, Highlands College. As well as offering part-time and evening courses Highlands is the largest sixth form provider in the Island, and works collaboratively with a range of organisations including the Open University, University of Plymouth and London South Bank University. In particular students can study at Highlands for the two year Foundation Degree in Financial Services and for BSc Social Sciences, both validated by the University of Plymouth. The Institute of Law is Jersey's law school, providing a course for students seeking to qualify as Jersey advocates and solicitors. It also provides teaching for students enrolled on the University of London LLB degree programme, via the International Programmes. The Open University supports students in Jersey (but they pay higher fees than UK students). Private sector higher education providers include the Jersey International Business School.

The episode was written by Jessica Sharzer and directed by Bradley Buecker. Due to a very aggressive production schedule it was previously announced that the show's first season would be cut short. In the aftermath of family tragedy, Ben (Dylan McDermott) tries to take his child out of the Murder House. Meanwhile, Violet (Taissa Farmiga) and Vivien (Connie Britton) accustom themselves to their new living arrangements, Constance (Jessica Lange) raises Tate's child as her own and a new family buys the house. Kate Mara and Charles S. Dutton guest star as Hayden McClaine and Detective Granger, respectively. The episode was well received by the majority of television critics and viewership and ratings for the episode reached a season high with 3.22 million. It garnered a 1.7 rating in the 18–49 demographic, according to Nielsen Media Research. This episode is rated TV-MA (LSV). Plot After Vivien's death, Ben attempts to find her and Violet in the house. He goes to see Constance, who has been taking care of the baby since Vivien's death, and discovers that she is Tate's mother. He threatens her and leaves. Vivien resolves to not show herself to Ben, so he doesn't stay in the house. Ben contemplates suicide, but Vivien stops him. He then reconciles with Vivien and Violet's ghosts, who encourage him to start a new life with the baby away from the house. However, Hayden hangs him from a chandelier, making it look like suicide. Hayden takes the baby, but Constance reclaims it. She tells the police that she found Ben after he hanged himself and that Violet must have run off with the baby. When a new family, the Ramoses, move in, Vivien, Ben, Moira, and other ghosts resolve to scare them, as to make them leave the house. Tate attempts to kill the Ramoses son, Gabriel thinking he might be a better boyfriend for Violet. Violet stops Tate, and distracts him to allow Gabriel to escape with his family. Tate seeks counsel from Ben, who wants nothing to do with him. Tate finally takes responsibility for his actions and apologizes, before asking for Ben's friendship, which Ben declares he cannot absolve him of his sins. Vivien finds Nora taking care of the Harmon's baby, who took one breath in the house, meaning he is now a ghost. Nora returns the baby to Vivien after Nora realizes that she isn't a good mother. Moira accepts Vivien's offer to be the baby's godmother, now named Jeffrey. After that, the Harmons and Moira decorate the house for Christmas, while Tate tells Hayden he'll wait forever for Violet to forgive him. Three years later, Constance returns home from the hairdresser and sees a trail of blood on the floor, leading to the bedroom of her grandson Michael, the Antichrist, now about three years old and looking much like Tate. He has murdered his nanny and is sitting in a rocking chair, Constance looks at him with pride, and smiling as she says, \\"Now what am I going to do with you?\\". Production The episode was written by consulting producer Jessica Sharzer and directed by Bradley Buecker. Due to a \\"very aggressive\\" production schedule and the series' pilot shoot having to wait for co-creators Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk's other show, Glee, to wrap its second season production, it was announced that the show's first season finale would be thirty minutes shorter than planned. An option was given to Murphy by the network to drop the thirteenth episode altogether and air an hour-long finale, but Murphy came up with a plan for a ninety-minute episode. After the episode aired, Murphy spoke of his plans to change the cast and location for the second season. He did say, however, that some actors who starred in the first season would be returning. He announced, \\"The people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters, creatures, monsters, etc. [The Harmons'] stories are done. People who are coming back will be playing entirely new characters.\\" In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy commented on the structure of the series' first season. \\"I loved how it began. I loved it in the middle and I loved the end. The only thing really frustrating for me, to be honest with you, is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say, 'Really?' But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!' I'm excited for people to see it on DVD, because now that they know how it ended, [they can] go back and see all of the little things, like people who have no reflections in mirrors. When you go back, you will see everything was set up.\\" When asked if the House \\"pulled\\" the Harmons to it, Murphy responded, \\"I don't know if they were targeted. I don't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it...although that would have been hilarious. I thought it was two things: it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary. And also I think there's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start, moving West, starting fresh.\\" Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Afterbirth\\" was seen by an estimated 3.22 million household viewers and earned a 1.7 rating share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research, its highest numbers of the season. The first season tied with the TNT series Falling Skies as the biggest new cable series of the year among adults 18-49. Rotten Tomatoes reports an 83% approval rating, based on 12 reviews. The critical consensus reads, \\"\\"Afterbirth\\" is an enjoyable season finale that manages to deliver a few last minute scares as it ties up loose ends.\\" James Queally from The Star-Ledger commented about the season and its finale, \\"After a wildly uneven first nine episodes... and two red-hot episodes leading up to the finale... \\"Afterbirth\\" starts out flying high at the way too fast pace that has made American Horror Story an enjoyable ride these past two weeks. But somewhere in the final 30 minutes of this episode, \\"Afterbirth\\" turns into a wandering epilogue.\\" Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club stated, \\"Part of the fun of those early episodes – even when I really didn't like them – was that you never quite had a good sense of what the hell kind of show you were watching. The finale sticks us into what seems to be a pretty basic setup for season two.\\" Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called \\"Afterbirth\\" \\"an exhilarating shocker.\\" Matt Fowler at IGN gave the episode a score eight out of ten, signifying a \\"great\\" rating. He stated, \\"\\"Afterbirth\\" was a very odd finale and I'm pretty sure that it was nothing like most of us thought it would be.\\" The Horror Writers Association gave \\"Afterbirth\\" the 2011 Bram Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in a Screenplay.

In the length of his career, Fasano directed six films, produced twenty more, and wrote screenplays for at least eighteen others. Fasano spent much of his career working as a script doctor, working on numerous well-known blockbuster films including Tombstone, Die Hard with a Vengeance, and Judge Dredd. With novelist Roni Keller, he also wrote the book Evie and the Golem, published in 2011. A weapons expert, Fasano was a frequent writing contributor to such authoritative magazines as Combat Tactics, and American Handgunner. Fasano was also a prolific Halloween mask designer. Career After graduating SUNY College at Purchase in 1984, Fasano used his artistic talents art directing for magazines such as Muscle and Beauty, Race Car & Driver, Wrestling Power and OUI. He also found work painting the one sheet posters for Grindhouse films such as Tenement (Slaughter in the South Bronx) for legendary exploitation film producers Roberta Findlay and Walter Sear. Fasano rewrote and acted in their film Blood Sisters. His work impressed All in the Sex Family writer-producer-director Jack Bravman, who hired Fasano to write Zombie Nightmare on which Fasano was also an actor and reportedly uncredited co-director, starring Adam West and a young Tia Carrere. A self-proclaimed metalhead, Fasano drew artwork for concert promotion material and heavy metal magazines, as well as directing the heavy metal-themed cult horror films Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare and Black Roses, the former of which starred Canadian singer Jon Mikl Thor. Fasano relocated to Los Angeles in 1989, where he sold his first spec script, Tailgunner, to Morgan Creek. He then co-wrote the screenplay for Another 48 Hrs. for director Walter Hill, which generated a series of script-writing offers from major studios. Fasano became a script doctor contracted to Cinergi Pictures, making major contributions to the screenplays for numerous films produced by the company, including Die Hard with a Vengeance, Tombstone, Judge Dredd, and Color of Night. Fasano was among the many writers attached to Alien 3 during its long development. While Vincent Ward was still attached to the project, Fasano expanded the writer-director's story outline into a full screenplay that was ultimately unused. In 1997, he was nominated for a WGA Award for writing The Hunchback, a television adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame which stylistically hearkened back to the previous 1923 adaptation. He also wrote several episodes of the television series F/X, the made-for-TV film The Hunley, and was a one-off guest writer on Profiler. Fasano co-wrote Universal Soldier: The Return, a sequel to the original 1992 cult action film. In 2001, Fasano penned the screenplay to Megiddo: The Omega Code 2, a religious thriller film starring Michael York, and produced by the Trinity Broadcasting Network. Two years later, he returned to the horror genre as one of the writers and producers of Darkness Falls, an early outing for director Jonathan Liebesman. Fasano wrote several television films, including Saving Jessica Lynch and Stone Cold. In 2009, he created Woke Up Dead, a horror comedy web series starring Jon Heder and Wayne Knight. His final outing as director was Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight, a tokusatsu TV series aired on The CW.

He also chaired the club from 1904 to 1906. The club Fram went through a series of mergers before the modern Brumunddal IL was formed. Brumunddal FK was founded in 1905. The club changed its name to Frem IL in 1919 as the sport athletics was added. In 1921 the club bought a sports field which from 1924 was named Frambanen. This happened after SK Fram and Frem IL merged in 1924 to form Fram IL. The sports were thus football, athletics and Nordic skiing. Tennis was added in 1933, cycling in 1934 and speed skating in 1935. Brumunddal AIL was founded as an AIF club on 18 April 1932. Its first sports were boxing and Nordic skiing. In the summer of 1933 cycling and race walking were added; soon after football, athletics, sport shooting, chess and team handball. The club bought the sports field Sveum together with Brumunddal Arbeiderlag in the autumn of 1934. The club took the name Brumunddal IL after the merger of Fram IL and Brumunddal AIL on 11 November 1945. The club centred its field activities (such as football, athletics, speed skating) around Sveum, and sold Frambanen to the dairy Brumunddal Meieri. After the merger, the new Brumunddal IL had sections for football, Nordic skiing, speed skating, athletics, cycling, tennis, swimming, boxing and shooting. In 1947 the club took up orienteering.

Depth Headquarters) of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is a command formed in 2011 to coordinate the IDF's long range operations and operations deep in enemy territory. The command originally formed in the 1980s but was scaled down and then planned again in the 2000s. The decision for its formation in the current form was taken by Chief of Staff Benny Gantz in 2011. Its current commander is Major General Itai Veruv. History The command originally operated in 1982–1986. It was subordinated to the Southern Command and headed by Major General Doron Rubin. It was scaled down and commanded by a Brigadier General until 2011. The last commander of the unit in this form was Gil Tamir. Operations The Depth Corps was recreated as a major command out of a feeling that Israel's special forces were underutilized in the nation's conflicts, and out of a lack of a body coordinating their operations behind enemy lines. This was made possible by preparations made by the major generals Shay Avital, Aviv Kokhavi, Ido Nehoshtan and Gadi Eizenkot. According to Israeli newspaper Haaretz, it was also a means for Defense Minister Ehud Barak to realize his vision of having more special forces veterans in IDF's General Staff. Previously, many of IDF's special operations were commanded by the naval or air force chiefs by virtue of the soldiers being transported by sea or air, respectively, regardless of the essence of these operations. One of the primary missions for the new corps will be the special forces operations to prevent transfer of advanced weaponry of supplies to Groups like Hamas and Hezbollah..

An area of disturbed weather formed to the north of Truk on July 31 and tracked westward over the next several days. Following an increase in shower activity and a decrease in wind shear, a tropical depression developed on August 4\\\\. Two days later, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm. After turning northwestward and then northward, Cecil intensified into a typhoon on August 7, and then began to deepen at a rapid clip. On August 8, Cecil attained its maximum intensity as it brushed Taiwan. There, 19 people were killed, including 4 in Wugu District, where 2,800 families sought shelter. After pulling away from Taiwan, Typhoon Cecil moved northwestward, and then on August 10, turned to the north-northeast. Colder air, cooler waters, and higher shear contributed to a weakening trend, and Cecil was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 11\\\\. Although Cecil passed east of Japan, it came close enough to the country to drop heavy rains. Nation-wide, three people were killed and two were injured. A total of 2,100 households lost power in Hinokage. On August 14, Cecil turned east and struck South Korea as a minimal tropical storm before dissipating over the Sea of Japan. Throughout South Korea, 35 people were killed, 28 went missing, and 28 others sustained injuries. Almost 1,300 houses were flooded, which resulted in 6,200 people becoming homeless. Damage was estimated at US$30 million. Meteorological history The tropical disturbance that would later become Typhoon Cecil was first distinguishable as a low-level circulation about north of Truk on July 31\\\\. Over the next four days, the disturbance tracked westward and remained embedded in the monsoon trough, maintaining a closed surface circulation and an area of enhanced convective activity on satellite imagery. Initially, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) was not issued because strong easterly wind shear was expected to inhibit development. On August 4, following an increase in convective activity, a decrease in wind shear, and ship reports in the area measuring central pressures of , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a TCFA. Meanwhile, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the system into a tropical depression. The JTWC upgraded the system into a tropical depression at 06:00 UTC on August 5 after a Hurricane Hunter aircraft mission observed sustained winds of . The depression continued to track westward under the influence of easterly steering currents along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge. On August 6, both the JTWC and the JMA classified the depression as Tropical Storm Cecil. Cecil briefly turned southward, slowed down, and then curved northwestward. At 00:00 UTC on August 7, the JTWC upgraded Cecil into a typhoon, with the JMA following suit several hours later. Over the ensuing 24 hours, Cecil entered a period of rapid deepening, and by 00:00 UTC on August 8, the JTWC had raised the intensity to . Midday on August 8, the JMA reported that Cecil attained its peak intensity of and a minimum barometric pressure of . The JTWC estimated that Cecil attained a peak intensity of at 18:00 UTC while located east of Taiwan. As Cecil approached Taiwan from the southeast, it turned sharply northward until reaching the 25th parallel north when Cecil once again assumed a more northwestward track. On August 10, Cecil turned toward the north-northeast and the combined effects of colder ocean temperatures, vertical wind shear, and colder air aloft began to take their toll. On August 11, the JTWC downgraded Cecil to a tropical storm as it tracked northward under the influence of a subtropical ridge. That same day, the JMA briefly downgraded Cecil to a severe tropical storm, although data from the agency suggested that Cecil reached a secondary peak intensity of that evening. At 00:00 UTC on August 12, the JMA downgraded Cecil back to a severe tropical storm for the final time. The next day, Cecil was downgraded to a tropical storm by the JMA. By August 14, Cecil had passed to the east of Japan was beyond the northward influence of the subtropical ridge and began to track eastward, striking South Korea as a minimal tropical storm. Cecil's circulation was unable to reorganize after crossing the Korean peninsula and dissipated in the Sea of Japan on August 15, with the JMA ceasing to track the system at 06:00 UTC. Impact Although Cecil never approached closer than to Taiwan, the outer rainbands of the typhoon lashed Taiwan with heavy rains, where fell in the capital of Taipei during a 32-hour time span. A landslide killed 18 people in the Wugu District, where 4 people were rendered missing and 2,800 families were stranded. Flash flooding claimed one life and resulted in four others missing in Taoyuan. Overall, 19 people perished in the country. After passing Taiwan, rough seas caused by the storm near the Ryukyu Islands left the World Cosmos and Marvie ships in distress. The storm dropped heavy rainfall across much of Japan. A peak rainfall total of occurred at Nakagoya Station, including a record in 24 hours. Within an hour, fell in Nishimera. Moreover, a wind gust of was recorded in Tshigaki. Nation-wide, three people were killed and two others were wounded in Miyazaki Prefecture and Oita Prefecture. In Hinokage, 2,100 homes lost electricity and 500 residents were evacuated from their homes. Because Cecil, at the time of landfall, was only a minimal tropical storm, the primary threat associated with the storm across South Korea was heavy rainfall. The storm dumped of rain in some places, including in Sancheong County. These rains resulted in landslides in 10 provinces. Nationwide, 35 people were killed, 28 were missing, and 28 were hurt. Nearly 1,300 houses were flooded, leaving 6,200 people homeless. Sancheong County along with the city of Changwon were the hardest hit by the storm, where three mudslides killed nine people and left six missing. In all, damage in the country amounted to US$30 million.

Cecil originated from an area of convection that tracked west-northwest and passed south of Palau late on October 9\\\\. The disturbance became increasingly defined as it moved through the southern Philippines. On October 12, a tropical depression developed, and the next day, the depression was upgraded into a tropical storm. Cecil turned northwest over the open waters of the South China Sea as it steadily strengthened, and was classified as a typhoon on October 14\\\\. After unexpectedly slowing down, Cecil continued to intensify and at noon of October 14, reached its peak intensity of 145 km/h (90 mph). Land interaction with Vietnam triggered a weakening trend. After turning west, Cecil moved onshore just north of Huế at 22:00 UTC on October 15\\\\. After tracking into Laos, the typhoon dissipated 39 hours later. Across Vietnam, 229,039 homes were damaged and 47,757 others were destroyed. At least 7,000 schools were damaged and 1,900 others were destroyed. Moreover, 70,000 t (77,160 short tons) of rice were wiped away. Overall, 769 people were killed, 128 were reported missing, and 200 were wounded. Approximately 3,000 ha (7,400 acres) of farmland were flooded and at least 225,000 others were left homeless. In all, damage was estimated at US$65 million. Typhoon Cecil was considered the worst natural disaster in the central portion of the country in history. Elsewhere, one person was killed in Thailand. Meteorological history Typhoon Cecil originated from an area of increasing convection on October 8\\\\. Satellite imagery showed a large area of curved convection near the equator from the 139th meridian east to the 145th meridian east. The disturbance tracked west- northwest, passing just south of Palau late on October 9\\\\. Aided by an excellent poleward outflow channel via an upper-level trough, the disturbance steadily organized. At 02:22 UTC on October 11, a Hurricane Hunter aircraft discovered a surface circulation east of Mindanao along with winds of and a barometric pressure of . On the same day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. The disturbance became more defined as it passed through the islands of the southern Philippines. Early on October 12, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system. Later that day the JMA upgraded the depression into a tropical storm. An increase in organization prompted the JTWC to classify the system as a tropical depression later that day, although post-season analysis revealed that Cecil was already a tropical storm by this time. At the time, the JTWC expected the cyclone to rapidly intensify over the South China Sea and strike Vietnam within three days. After becoming a tropical storm, Cecil turned northwest over the open waters of the South China Sea along the southern edge of a ridge over eastern China and the East China Sea. The storm steadily intensified, with the JMA classifying the system as severe tropical storm at 00:00 UTC on October 13. After a Hurricane Hunter aircraft plane measured a pressure of early on October 13, the JTWC upgraded Cecil to a typhoon at 18:00 UTC, with the JMA doing the same early the next day. Continuing to intensify, the typhoon cleared out an eye, which it would maintain until it struck land. The JMA set the peak intensity at noon on October 14, with winds of and a minimum pressure of . Meanwhile, the JTWC estimated that Cecil obtained its peak intensity of at 00:00 UTC on October 15\\\\. Continuing to slowly track northwest as the ridge to its north was weaker than expected, Cecil passed south of Hainan Island that morning and, according to the JTWC, began to weaken due to its close proximity to Vietnam. However, the JMA estimated that no changed in strength occurred during this time. Cecil turned west as the ridge to its north built back in and contrary to expectations did not make landfall until moving onshore just north of Huế at 22:00 UTC on October 15. Cecil crossed into Laos two hours later and by 06:00 UTC on October 16, the JTWC ceased tracking the system. The JMA did the same 30 hours later. Impact and aftermath During its formative stages, 70 fishing boats sunk or were destroyed by the storm in Iloilo in the Philippines. The first of two typhoons to strike Vietnam in a week, Cecil demolished houses, downed power lines, and caused flooding that forced large- scale evacuations in central Vietnam, where five villages were completely destroyed. In the Nghệ Tĩnh and Quảng Nam Provinces, 485 homes were destroyed and 879 were damaged. In both provinces, around of rice fields were flooded and there was one fatality. Throughout the central portion of the country, 250 dispensaries and nearly 9,000 schools were destroyed. There, six hospitals and 250 medical stations were damaged and a 200-bed hospital was destroyed. Nationwide, 47,757 dwellings were destroyed, with an additional 229,039 homes were damaged. At least 7,000 schools were damaged and 1,900 others were destroyed. A total of of rice were wiped away. Throughout the area, 769 people were killed and 128 were reported missing while 257 were wounded. Around of farmland were flooded and at least 225,000 others were left homeless. The typhoon was considered the worst natural disaster to strike the central portion of the nation. Damage was estimated at US$65 million. Heavy rains in Thailand caused flash flooding that resulted in one causality. There, Cecil was the second typhoon to strike the nation within a week, after Typhoon Andy. Following Cecil, the Vietnamese government requested that the World Food Programme provide worth of food. To combat the damage caused by the typhoon, the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs each contributed $30,000. The European Economic Community awarded $112,676 in cash while Secours Populaire Français donated $139,188, along with of iron nails, 23,200 bottles of Ampicillin, and 1,000 bags of salt.

Lone was elected to the Senate of Pakistan in March 1997 for a period of six years on a Pakistan Muslim League (N) ticket, which is seen by some as his 'reward' for the co-operatives scam ruling.

State of Alaska, 122 P.3d 781 (Ak. 2005), is an Alaska Supreme Court case holding that Alaska's Ballot Measure 2, which bans same-sex marriage, does not foreclose state equal protection claims brought on behalf of same-sex couples.  Background The State of Alaska and the municipality of Anchorage offers employment benefits to spouses of employees, but not to unmarried couples. The Alaska Civil Liberties Union and nine homosexual couples filed suit against Alaska and Anchorage in superior court, alleging that this denial violates their equal protection under the Alaska Constitution. The Superior Court denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment, on the grounds that \\"heightened scrutiny was unwarranted because the state and the municipality were discriminating between married and unmarried employees, not between opposite-sex and same-sex couples\\", that \\"a right to employee benefits, which it ruled was not a fundamental right\\", and that \\"the defendants had a legitimate interest in reducing costs, increasing administrative efficiency, and promoting marriage\\".Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 122 P.3d 781 at 785. Plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court.  Court Ruling On appeal, defendants argued that Ballot Measure 2 foreclosed plaintiffs' equal protection claims. The Court rejected that argument, on the basis that Measure 2 \\"does not explicitly or implicitly prohibit public employers from offering to their employees' same-sex domestic partners all benefits that they offer to their employees' spouses. It does not address the topic of employment benefits at all\\", nor was there \\"any legislative history implying that, despite its clear words, the Marriage Amendment should be interpreted to deny employment benefits to public employees with same-sex domestic partners\\". As such, that \\"the Marriage Amendment effectively prevents same-sex couples from marrying does not automatically permit the government to treat them differently in other ways.\\" Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 122 P.3d at 786-787. The Court noted that it previously held that the state's equal protection clause \\"protects Alaskans' right to non-discriminatory treatment more robustly than does the federal equal protection clause\\".Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 122 P.3d at 787. It agreed \\"with the plaintiffs that the proper comparison is between same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples, whether or not they are married.\\"Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 122 P.3d at 788 It then held that \\"the benefits programs are facially discriminatory\\". While it noted a \\"sliding-scale analysis for equal protection challenges in Alaska\\",Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 122 P.3d at 789. it declined to rule on whether a higher standard of review was needed for sexual orientation classifications, as \\"the benefits programs cannot survive minimum scrutiny\\"Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 122 P.3d at 790. It first held that the employment benefits are \\"undeniably economic\\", and as such they receive \\"minimum scrutiny\\" if a suspect classification is not involved. The defendants argued that \\"they have three legitimate interests — cost control, administrative efficiency, and promotion of marriage — in limiting employment benefits to spouses and dependent children\\" But the Court did not \\"see how an absolute exclusion of same-sex domestic partners from being eligible for benefits is substantially related to this interest. Many same-sex couples are no doubt just as \\"truly close[ly] relat[ed]\\" and \\"closely connected\\" as any married couple... Although limiting benefits to \\"spouses,\\" and thereby excluding all same-sex domestic partners, does technically reduce costs, such a restriction fails to advance the expressed governmental goal of limiting benefits to those in \\"truly close relationships\\" with and \\"closely connected\\" to the employee.\\" Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 122 P.3d at 791 On administrative efficiency, the Court held that the \\"availability of these benefits elsewhere [in Alaska] persuades us that administrative difficulties are not an insurmountable barrier to providing benefits if our constitution requires that they be provided.\\" Tbus, they concluded that \\"the absolute exclusion of same-sex couples is not substantially related to the goal of maximizing administrative efficiency\\".Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 122 P.3d at 791-792 On the asserted interest in promoting marriage, the Court rejected plaintiffs' contention that \\"the state is not truly interested in promoting marriage, because, if it were, it would not have prevented gays and lesbians from entering into married relationships\\", and noted that \\"just because the legislature did not want to promote same-sex marriage does not mean it did not have a sincere interest in promoting \\"traditional\\" marriage\\", and held that promoting marriage is at least a legitimate government interest.Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 122 P.3d at 792-793. They then held that \\"restricting eligibility to persons in a status that same-sex domestic partners can never achieve — cannot be said to be related to that interest\\", noting that \\"[t]here is no indication here that denying benefits to public employees with same-sex domestic partners has any bearing on who marries. There is no indication here that granting or denying benefits to public employees with same-sex domestic partners causes employees with opposite-sex domestic partners to alter their decisions about whether to marry. There is no indication here that any of the plaintiffs, having been denied these benefits, will now seek opposite-sex partners with an intention of marrying them. And if such changes resulted in sham or unstable marriages entered only to obtain or confer these benefits, they would not seem to advance any valid reasons for promoting marriage.\\" The Court thus held that the denial of benefits violate equal protection.Alaska Civil Liberties Union, 122 P.3d at 794.

Forming from a disturbance in the East Pacific on August 6, the storm began a general westward movement it would take throughout most of its life. The storm intensified steadily, becoming a Category 1 hurricane on August 10\\\\. It kept steady at this intensity until it reached the Central Pacific. Upon entering the Central Pacific, intensification began anew, and by August 14, the hurricane reached a peak intensity of . After maintaining this intensity for twelve hours, the hurricane began to weaken while passing south of Hawaii. The weakening phase was similar to its intensification in that the storm lost intensity slowly. Celeste then made a turn to the northwest and dropped below hurricane intensity on August 21\\\\. The storm then entered an area of vertical wind shear, causing it to dissipate soon after. Celeste was responsible for damage to shipping and for causing high waves to hit Hawai'i. The biggest impact from the hurricane, however, was on Johnston Atoll. There, the hurricane caused damage to a meteorology station on the island as well as damaging several military installations, including those related to Program 437, an anti- satellite weapons system. Additionally, there was a threat of contamination on the island from stored Agent Orange and other herbicides brought from Vietnam by the Defense Department for eventual destruction at sea by the Dutch-owned incinerator ship MT Vulcanus. An inspection of the island following the hurricane indicated that there was no contamination, but the 1,800,000 gallons of herbicides sat in steel barrels on salt beaches for nearly 5 years. Overall, damage from the hurricane totalled $3.5 million. Meteorological history The precursor to Celeste was a tropical disturbance that had stalled roughly south of La Paz, Mexico on August 4, though the disturbance was tracked starting two days before. The disturbance slowly intensified into a tropical storm on August 6 and was given the name Celeste. The next day, a ship called the Star Track reported winds of and an atmospheric pressure of at a point south of the center of the storm. At this point, the storm began a general westward motion it would continue on for most of its life due to high- pressure areas north of its track. While traversing the East Pacific, the storm kept a consistent intensity until late on August 9, when it started intensifying again, becoming a hurricane the next day. On August 12, the hurricane passed 140°W longitude and entered the Central Pacific just as it reached Category 2 strength. Upon entering the Central Pacific, the hurricane began intensifying at a steady rate. On August 14, it peaked as a minimum Category 4 hurricane, an intensity it would keep for twelve hours. Afterwards, the hurricane began a slow weakening trend, despite reaching its lowest pressure – – after its wind speeds decreased. On August 16, the hurricane made a turn to the west-northwest, which brought it on a path towards Johnston Atoll. The hurricane passed to the northeast of Johnston on August 19, subjecting the atoll to nearly six hours of hurricane-force winds. After passing the atoll, Celeste turned to the northwest and eventually weakened to a tropical storm on August 21. Shortly after weakening to a tropical storm, it entered an area of higher vertical wind shear which ultimately led to its dissipation by August 22. The best track intensity of Celeste largely varies between the HURDAT and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC). The best track on HURDAT lists Celeste as strengthening in intensity from tropical storm to its Category 4 peak and then weakening to dissipation in a straightforward manner, skipping Category 3 intensity while strengthening. The CPHC track, however, varies in that it shows a weakening to Category 1 shortly after entering the basin, followed by reintensification into a Category 3\\\\. Another difference is that the CPHC shows Celeste as having reached Category 3 a second time on August 18 after prior weakening, during which it reached its peak intensity. Finally, the CPHC best track gives a peak intensity of Category 3 rather than Category 4. Impact During its initial intensification in the East Pacific, Celeste was responsible for damaging a ship in the area. The ship, the barquentine Regina Maris (schooner) with 58 people aboard was impacted by high winds and rough seas, resulting in damage that led to the ship taking on 2000 gallons of water an hour. A Hurricane Hunter aircraft en route to the hurricane found the ship after receiving news that it was in the area and helped guide a rescue aircraft to the vessel before resuming its reconnaissance flight. The Vishva Tirth an Indian freighter, was the first vessel to arrive and it towed the Regina Maris to Los Angeles which took about 10 days. The Vishva Tirth took aboard most of the passengers from the Regina Maris. The Captain, Paul Maskell, along with the crew stayed on board the Regina Maris. The US Coast Guard Cutter Mellon arrived the day after the Vishva Tirth took the Regina Maris under tow and escorted both vessels for a few days. The Regina Maris was towed the entire way to Los Angeles by the Vishva Tirth. The towing was affected by Celeste and later by Hurricane Diana. While stranded, two people were treated for injuries on board the vessel. Another rescue attempt was affected when a homemade yacht called the Little Ark was briefly threatened by the hurricane. Prior to Celeste, it had rescued the crew of the ship Pipedream II, which had been damaged off the coast of California. However, the Coast Guard reported that the yacht would have little trouble in avoiding the hurricane. While passing south of Hawaii, the hurricane affected the Puna, Kau, and South Kona Coasts of the Big Island with waves measuring high. In addition, the threat of swells caused high surf warnings to be posted for the entire Hawaiian chain. The worst impact was on Johnston Island, which had never experienced a hurricane prior to Celeste. The year before, 13,000 tons of nerve gas and mustard gas had been transferred to the atoll from Okinawa. After a hurricane watch was posted, the idea of evacuation was considered and a decision was to be reached the day before the storm was to arrive. However, the threat of the stored gas being dispersed led to the island being evacuated as a precaution. The need of evacuation was increased by the hurricane gaining speed towards the island. After the decision, the arsenal on the island was secured and most of the personnel on the island were evacuated to Honolulu. Initially, ten people, including the base commander, volunteered to stay behind in shelters in order to clear the runway using bulldozers after the hurricane passed. However, the ten volunteers were evacuated after the risk was found to be too great. During the hurricane, the island was hit by high winds and waves for six hours, although fears that the island would be inundated never materialized. A total rainfall of was measured, but this is likely lower than the actual total since the instrument measuring the rainfall was partially clogged by a piece of coral. After the storm had passed, a flight had reported that damage looked minor. A decontamination team then arrived at the island to inspect whether any gas had escaped and whether the runway was usable. The unit later reported that the island was all clear. The north and northwest sides of structures on the island were reported to be hit by a combination of sand and coral. Roofs were blown off and the weather station on the island had lost one third of its roof and ceiling tiles, but the interior and instruments remained intact. None of the vehicles and heavy equipment on the island were reported to have been moved by the storm. An inspection by UNIVAC indicated that several computers on the island incurred rust, corrosion and, in one case, fungal growth. The biggest impact was to Program 437, a defense project that used anti-satellite weapons, with facilities and guidance computers destroyed. The system was repaired but Program 437 was terminated shortly afterwards on 6 March 1975. During Hurricane Keli in 1984, a figure of $3.5 million in damage was reported as having been caused by Celeste. Records In addition to being the first hurricane to strike Johnston, Celeste set many other records while active, most of them related to its impact on Johnston. The evacuations marked the first time that a major U.S. base was left unmanned, although the base was still under surveillance. Following the storm, the weather station on the island measured a wind speed of , the highest recorded in 13 years of measurements, besting the previous record of recorded on two occasions. However, the gust recorder at the station remained inactive during the storm. The station also recorded a record low pressure of . The previous lowest was at an unknown time.

Built in 1881, it is one of three 19th-century public market buildings still standing in the city, along with Eastern Market and Georgetown Market. The market was listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites in 1968 and the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The most distinctive architectural element of the Gothic Revival building is its corner tower on 7th and O Streets. For decades, the market was a vital shopping destination for area residents. Following World War II, the market and surrounding neighborhood began to deteriorate. The building was slightly damaged during the 1968 Washington, D.C., riots, but was restored and reopened in 1980. Renovations were to begin in 2003, but in February of that year, the building's roof collapsed under snow following a historic blizzard. A decade later, the rehabilitated building reopened as part of a $325 million mixed-use development, City Market at O. History 19th century Following the Civil War, local government officials led by Board of Public Works head Alexander \\"Boss\\" Shepherd sought to change the image of Washington, D.C., as a small, unattractive city. Among the many improvements Shepherd planned was the replacement of the city's existing public markets with new, brick facilities in heavily populated neighborhoods. One of the older markets, Northern Liberties Market at Mount Vernon Square, was razed in 1872. Many vendors refused to leave the market and several were killed during the demolition. With the help of businessmen, other vendors started the Northern Liberty Market Company (NLMC), which in 1875 opened a new public market at 5th and K Streets NW, in what is the present-day Mount Vernon Triangle neighborhood. Shepherd nevertheless moved ahead with plans for a city-owned public market, and allocated land for the facility on the southwest corner of Square 446 (a city block bounded by 6th, 7th, O, and P Streets NW). As he did with many citywide improvement projects, Shepherd awarded contracts to businesses in which he owned large amounts of stock. After this corrupt practice was discovered, Shepherd was relieved of his post and many of the city projects he spearheaded were abandoned—including the new market. The Northern Liberties Market struggled financially, as many residents found it too far from the commercial district on 7th Street. The NLMC sought to relocate, and in 1881 purchased the southwest corner of Square 422 (a city block bounded by 7th, 8th, O, and P Streets NW). Butcher Michael Hoover owned Square 422 in the early 1800s and sold it to printer Andrew Rothwell about 1845. Rothwell made many improvements to the property and added gardens which became popularly known as Rothwell's Gardens. The NLMC applied for building permits for a $15,000 ($ in dollars), one-story brick building on May 31, 1881. The permit was signed by NLMC president Jesse B. Wilson. The new building was named O Street Market to avoid confusion with the company's other markets. 20th century A meat stand in O Street Market, 1915 The area surrounding the O Street Market, known as Shaw, was demographically mixed. The white population included a large number of German immigrants, many of whom were vendors at the market. 7th Street NW was the heart of the city's Jewish community, and a significant number of African Americans lived in the neighborhood. The market continued to thrive even as the demographic and retail nature of the area neighborhood dramatically changed. By the 1920s, Shaw was overwhelmingly black, black vendors had supplanted the German American retailers at the market, and black-owned and operated businesses formed new retail corridors along 7th, 9th, and 14th Streets between P and U Streets. The market and Shaw neighborhood both deteriorated after World War II. By the 1960s, the market faced heavy competition from modern grocery stores and fell into disrepair. Local residents picketed the market, which led the city to enforce cleanliness regulations and building codes at the facility. In 1966, the District of Columbia, the National Capital Planning Commission, and the Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA; a joint city-federal agency overseeing redevelopment in the city) announced the establishment of the Shaw Urban Renewal Area. The 1968 riots caused only minor damage to the building, but the market did not reopen afterward.; The closure of the market and many other nearby businesses caused a widespread decline in the neighborhood, and left local residents without easy access to retail establishments. In 1972, the Council of the District of Columbia approved a $30.4 million ($ million in dollars) plan which, in part, provided for the purchase the O Street Market and its demolition. A modern shopping mall was planned for the site. The RLA purchased the property from the NLMC. Although neighborhood residents wanted the market torn down, the RLA declined to order its destruction. In 1974, the RLA proposed renovating the O Street Market and making it the retail centerpiece of a revived Shaw neighborhood. The agency awarded a $338,974 ($ in dollars) contract in June 1974 to the firm of James Cox & Sons to renovate the structure. In 1977, local African American entrepreneur James C. Adkins purchased the market and the rest of Square 422 for $200,000 ($ in dollars). Adkins began construction on a modern grocery store next to the O Street Market, and won a $1.75 million ($ million in dollars) loan from the federal Economic Development Administration to help renovate the 1881 market building. Adkins said he would add stalls inside and outside the market and lease them to food and other vendors. Renovation of the historic structure was more costly than anticipated, and Adkins was forced to seek an additional $300,000 ($ in dollars) in 1979 to complete its rehabilitation. Adkins, who had also purchased Square 426, successfully petitioned the National Capital Planning Commission to close 8th Street between P and O Streets NW. Adkins planned to turn the street into a pedestrian mall, parking lot, and landscaped area. Giant Food opened on October 10, 1979, and the O Street Market reopened on February 23, 1980. On March 31, 1994, during the two-decade crime wave of the 1980s and 1990s, the O Street Market was the site of a deadly shooting rampage. Seventeen-year-old Kevin Aaron McCrimmon paid five young men to kill 15-year-old Duwan A'Vant, who was known to frequent the market, because A'Vant had reportedly stolen a car from McCrimmon. At around 7pm, the five men entered the market and fired more than 30 rounds, killing A'Vant and wounding eight others (including a toddler and two elderly women). Although there were 399 homicides in the city that year, the event shocked residents because it was such a brazen attack in a public place. By the late 1990s, the O Street Market had once more become dilapidated. The structure fell into disrepair, trash collected around the building, many vendors were squatters without leases, and drug dealers and gang members loitered nearby, driving customers away. The building's owner fell behind on tax payments, and the city threatened to place a lien on the building and foreclose. Because O Street Market is one of only three 19th- century public market buildings remaining in Washington, D.C., it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 1995. It was previously added to the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites on July 24, 1968. 21st century O Street Market in 2010, seven years after the roof collapsed In 2001, local firm Roadside Development purchased the building with plans to rehabilitate the facility along with the Madison Retail Group. They proposed the partial closure of a 40-foot-wide (12 m) plaza on 8th Street to be replaced with a sidewalk, parking lot, and retail space, and for the addition of new windows in the walls. The D.C. Historic Preservation Review Board refused to authorize these changes, but the renovation of the interior was approved. The last tenants, consisting of small restaurants and shops, vacated the structure in late 2002 in preparation for remodeling set to begin in March or April 2003. On February 18, 2003, following a historic blizzard, the roof collapsed. Redevelopment of the O Street Market was delayed for two years as the developers sought to meet the demands imposed by the Historic Preservation Review Board. Community leaders and neighborhood residents regularly called for the project to resume in hopes that it would spur other development and decrease gang activity in the area. Roadside Development proposed a significantly expanded redevelopment in June 2004 that included most of Square 422. The company determined that the only way to make the O Street Market viable was to greatly enhance parking at the site. It could not do so without building extensive underground parking, and to build the parking garage would require construction of new buildings adjacent to the O Street Market and the Giant Food grocery store. The company initially proposed a $100 million project consisting of new construction and renovations which would add condominiums, apartments, a two-story underground parking garage, and either a new or renovated grocery store. By March 2005, when Roadside Development won its first design and zoning approval reviews, the plan had expanded into a $260 million project which included a 180-room hotel, 300 condominiums, 300 apartments, 700 underground parking spaces, and of new retail space. The O Street Market would be restored, renovated and incorporated into a new Giant Food store. The proposal also called for the city to reopen 8th Street NW. The O Street Market redevelopment received a setback in November 2007 when the District of Columbia Zoning Commission demanded that the development reduce the height of the new buildings to from and refused to reconsider its decision. Local residents denounced the zoning board's actions, which they perceived as imperiling redevelopment of their poverty-stricken neighborhood. After Roadside met the height requirements by removing penthouse apartments, the zoning commission approved the project in late March 2008. The project received its final approvals from the Historic Preservation Review Board and the D.C. Office of Planning in April and May 2008. Door on the original portion of the market building after restoration. By mid-summer 2008, the cost of the project had grown to $325 million. Now named \\"City Market at O\\", the nine-story development included over 600 units of housing, a 200-room hotel, retail space, and a new Giant supermarket almost doubling the size of the existing store. Mayor Adrian Fenty announced the city government would provide $35 million in tax increment financing (TIF) and plans were made to break ground in late 2009. The city also contributed $1 million toward the construction of the rent-controlled apartments for low- income residents, and $1.5 million in pre-development grants. Rising costs and delays pushed the project's cost higher, and by the time the city council acted, the city's TIF commitment had risen to $46.5 million. The official City Market groundbreaking ceremony was held September 1, 2010. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided a $117 million loan for the development and the Obama administration chose City Market at O as one of 14 nationwide projects to receive expedited permitting and environmental reviews in order to provide hundreds of infrastructure jobs. The Giant Food store closed and was razed in mid-2011, and Cambria Suites agreed to operate the hotel in October. The project was designed by Shalom Baranes Associates and built by Clark Construction. The new development opened in stages beginning in 2013. The 90-unit low-income senior housing apartment complex opened on August 21, 2013, and the 555-unit luxury apartment building was occupied on November 4. The apartment buildings offered a combined of retail space. The new Giant opened on November 21, 2013. The grocery store includes a cafe and bar built into the O Street Market's historic tower. In the middle of the store, arches utilizing some of the original brickwork designate the former location of the market's exterior wall. Progressive Grocer, an industry trade journal, gave an award for best overall design to the new Giant Food store in 2014. In 2015, City Market at O was a winner of the Urban Land Institute's Global Awards for Excellence competition. The 182-room Cambria Suites hotel opened in May 2014. The final phase of the development, 880 P, is a 142-unit apartment building which was completed in 2017. Original design O Street Market previously consisted of between and on the main level and a basement. The facade of the original one-story, rectangular brick building is wide and long. The most distinctive feature of this Gothic Revival section is the square tower on the northwest corner of 7th and O Streets NW. A gable roof and a monitor run the length of the remaining portion of the original facade. Including the tower, there are six bays on the 7th Street facade and five on the O Street facade. On the 7th Street facade, each bay features a pair of doors and transom windows. The bays on the O Street facade also have double doors and transom windows, except for the central bay, which projects and features a large window. The second and fourth bay transom windows on the O Street facade are surmounted by double-hung windows. The tower is crowned with a large pyramidal roof and dormers. On each street-facing facade of the tower there are two sets of doors with large transom windows. Each set of doors is framed by columns topped with cast iron foliate capitals. The columns support a projection that features decorative brickwork and a segmental arch. The windows on the second level of the tower are surmounted by a decorative wood panel and corbelled cornice.

It is part of the globally Occupy Wall Street movement. It consists of a loose informal affiliation of on the ground groups and individuals across South Africa as well as internet based groups. Groups such as Taking Back South Africa!, Occupy South Africa are involved in South Africa and online. The movement is also involved with the Marikana miners' strike. Broad objectives Like the occupy movement elsewhere the South African movement is a heterogeneous campaign. Some aspects of it deal with the governments failure to render equitable distribution of wealth, while other aspects of it deal with White minority dominance and other forms of ongoing out crops of apartheid such as economic apartheid. Others focus on White media domination and inequity in representation. Anonymous' message The logo of the initiative.On 18 March 2011 a video purportedly by the hacktivist group 'Anonymous' was released by Winds of Change Media calling on the South African people to rise up against the government and the capitalist system. This video expressed support for the 'Taking Back South Africa!' campaign. James Lorimer, spokesperson for the Democratic Alliance, the second biggest political party in South Africa, said in response to the call that because nobody knew who was behind the call, the uprising call lacked credibility. Occupy South Africa by region After months of networking with individuals and social groups in South Africa a call was made by Taking Back South Africa! to hold countrywide occupations in various cities in South Africa on 15 October 2011 following the same successful tactic used by Occupy Wall Street. The call went viral over the week preceding 15 October and many social groups and individual activists started preparing for the occupation of symbolic locations in their cities. Saturday, 15 October witnessed South Africa's first coordinated occupation which took place in five cities simultaneously, namely Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Grahamstown and East London. Joe Hani, one of the admins of 'Taking Back South Africa!' said when questioned by the Mail&Guardian; newspaper as to the motivation behind Occupy South Africa that \\"no country was more worthy of an uprising against capitalism than South Africa\\". Ayanda Kota, the chairperson of the Unemployed People's Movement said: \\"\\"We, the poor, suffer whenever companies fix the price of bread or when there are more job losses while chief executives get rich. But our protest is also localised, in the sense that we are protesting about the R19-million that is unaccounted for by the Makana municipality, the R240 000 spent by local government on bogus soccer development clinics and the privatisation of our struggle by the ANC.\\" Richard Pithouse, a Rhodes University political scientist, said the Grahamstown occupation protest could stand out as an example to other cities. It had been preceded by months of careful political work involving the Unemployed Peoples' Movement and the Students for Social Justice. This had culminated in \\"a negotiated solidarity based on equality\\" between disillusioned middle-class youth and grassroots communities, which had \\"explosive political potential\\". Occupy Johannesburg Demonstrators at Occupy Johannesburg. Around two hundred occupiers gathered outside the Johannesburg Stock Exchange and gave speeches over a microphone claiming to be of the 99% and they were very angry with the corporates and the politicians. Police later told the protesters they had to disperse or face arrest. There were problems related to the retreat point also at which point the occupiers decided to disperse and return another day. In attendance were activists from Soweto and Thembelihle, the Democratic Left Front had a prominent presence and members of Zeitgeist and September National Imbizo/Blackwash were in attendance as well. Andrew Bennie of the Democratic Left Front movement (DLF)noted in an interview with ABN news that South Africa's class divide was worse than many countries also Occupying. The South African Civil Society Information Service (SACSIS) also attended. Occupy Cape Town Around 200 attended with people coming and going throughout the day. A hot speaker was set up and speeches were given from occupiers from various backgrounds and ideologies. Police mingled past but did not intervene. City police stopped people bringing a trailer in and tried to tell a crafter not to sell his wire beaded flowers but the occupiers insisted he be allowed to stay. At the occupation were members of community organisations from Blikkiesdorp and Manenberg, Zeitgesters, Anarchists, and Blackwash members amongst others. Following occupations in Cape Town were held in Thibault Square. Mario Wanza, of 'Proudly Manenberg' and one of the organizers of Occupy Cape Town stated that \\"People have started realising that political parties don't have the answers. They make speeches everyday but nothing happens. Our lives don't get any better, our lives get worse. What is important is that this is a growing movement of change and we have given up on the government solving our problems. We have given up on the rich solving our problems. We are the only ones that can change things in this country.\\" Occupy Durban Activist Sarah Dawson reported that Durban had a steady flow of occupiers through the day, and had some really interesting discussions, and the occupiers had the opportunity to inform passers by about the movement. There were some natural arguments about what the movement is directed towards, but a general consensus that diversity should accommodated, and that the movement is about acknowledging a problem. Things were peaceful and spirits were high for the most part. Between 50 and 100 people occupied. Discussions were had about the possibility of making it a weekly occurrence into the future and seeking greater cooperation with other civil society groups and grassroot movements. There were children, guitarists and a slam poet. Sarah Dawson argued on behalf of the largely middle class attendance that \\"The movement is clearly not about \\"The Poor\\" with a capital P, but about a systemic problem. The 99% consists of people at every end of the spectrum, who have diverse experiences and responsibilities, but who acknowledge that their experiences share a cause.\\" During the Cop 17 climate talks of December 2011, the occupation seemed to become more serious in Durban. Occupy Grahamstown Mbali Baduza from Students for Social Justice reported that an initial group of 20 Rhodes University students gathered at the Botanical Gardens at 10 am. After having distributed T-shirts they made their way down to High Street to meet the masses (Unemployed People's Movement comrades and many others). As they walked down they chanted \\"Enough is Enough. We want our country back\\". While they walked down High Street, they distributed pamphlets which contained information about why the demonstration was happening and why it was necessary. When they reached the crowd gathered at the Cathedral (about 30–40 people) they all merged and sang protest songs for about an hour. Together they marched up and down high street and the louder they sang, the more people from the street joined. People of all races. On their return to the cathedral, the floor was opened up to the crowd to share their grievances. People from Phaphamani, Vukani and other locations spoke mainly about their need for 3 essentials: electricity, water and housing. They then made their way to the Makana Municipal buildings and chanted \\"Amandla, ngawethu! Amanga ngawabo!\\" Richard Pithouse and Ayanda Kota addressed the crowd and spoke about how although the government officials were not present, they would hear of the day's events. It was more of a symbolic gesture. Ayanda Kota and some UPM comrades went into the municipal buildings and threw shit inside to protest the bucket system and this was broadcast on South African news. After that activity, the police came and asked the crowd to leave. Ben Fogel stated that Occupy Grahamstown offers hope to the South Africa left, as it shows that radical students and the poor can form a political alliance based upon equality and solidarity. Occupy East London Chloe Menteath stated that five people later to be six stood underneath the East London Steve Biko Statue and in front of the Imperialists Old Shack. The small group shouted slogans out for an hour and a half while curious passers by looked on.

The system was first noted within the South Pacific convergence zone as a small tropical depression on November 13, to the northeast of the Solomon Islands. Over the next few days the system gradually developed further within an area of light winds in the upper troposphere, before it was named Tia early on November 16. Later that day due to a developing northerly steering current, the system slowed and undertook a small anticlockwise loop before starting to move towards the southwest and rapidly intensify. After rapidly intensifying throughout November 16 and 17, Tia passed within of the Solomon Island: Anuta at around 1800 UTC on November 17, before passing near Tikopia Island six hours later. As Tia moved near Tikopia, the system reached its peak intensity as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with 10‑minute sustained windspeeds of . During November 18, due to cooler waters and increased wind shear, Tia started to weaken as it moved southwards under the influence of a strengthening upper- level northerly wind flow. Over the next 24 hours, the system continued to move southwards and passed within of Vanuatu's Banks Islands, while gradually weakening further. Tia subsequently degenerated into a tropical depression during November 20, before it was last noted the next day as it crossed a part of its former track, where it had been producing hurricane-force wind speeds a few days earlier. While it was active Tia directly affected the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu, while it indirectly affected Kiribati. The Solomon Island of Tikopia was the worst affected island, after more than 1,000 people were left homeless on the island and 90% of all dwellings were destroyed. Damage was minimal in Vanuatu, and was mainly confined to crops and fruit trees on the Banks and Torres Islands. After this usage of the name Tia, the name was retired and withdrawn from use on the tropical cyclone naming lists. Meteorological history A small tropical depression developed within the South Pacific convergence zone, to the northeast of the Solomon Islands during November 13. During that day the system moved towards the south-west, before it sharply turned towards the east early the next day, as an equatorial westerly wind burst took place to the north of the cyclone. The depression subsequently gradually developed further, within an area of light winds in the upper troposphere and sea-surface temperatures of over . Early on November 15, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center initiated advisories on the depression and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 03P, after it had become equivalent to a tropical storm. During that day the system's upper level outflow characteristics became more favourable for further development, before the system was named Tia by the Fiji Meteorological Service after the system had developed into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. When it was named, Tia moving slowly and was located about to the northeast of the Santa Cruz Islands, before the JTWC reported at around 0600 UTC that Tia had become equivalent to a category one hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with 1‑minute sustained windspeeds of 120 km/h (75 mph). Around this time, because of a developing northerly steering current, Tia slowed and undertook a small anticlockwise loop, before starting to move towards the southwest and rapidly intensify. After rapidly intensifying throughout November 16 and 17, Tia passed within of Anuta Island at around 1800 UTC on November 17, before passing near Tikopia Island six hours later. As Tia moved near Tikopia, TCWC Nadi reported that the system had reached its peak intensity as a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, with sustained windspeeds of 140 km/h (85 mph). The JTWC followed suit six hours later and reported that the cyclone had peaked as a category 2 equivalent hurricane with sustained windspeeds of 175 km/h (110 mph). By 1800 UTC on November 18, due to cooler waters and increased wind shear, Tia started to weaken as it moved southwards under the influence of a strengthening upper- level northerly wind flow. Over the next 24 hours, the system continued to move southwards and passed within of Vanuatu's Banks Islands, while gradually weakening further before moving to the southeast under the influence of strong upper level northwesterlies. By 0000 UTC on November 20, Tia had weakened into a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian Scale and became slow moving while located about to the east of Port Villa in Vanautu. During that day the system turned and moved towards the northwest, before TCWC Nadi reported later that day at 1200 UTC, that Tia had weakened below tropical cyclone intensity. However, the JTWC monitored the system as a tropical cyclone for another 24 hours, before issuing their final advisory on the system at 1200 UTC as the system had weakened below tropical cyclone intensity. Tia was subsequently last noted by TCWC Nadi and JTWC later that day as it crossed a part of its former track, where it had been producing hurricane-force windspeeds a few days earlier. Preparations and impact Apart from several smaller islands no major inhabited islands lied in the path of Tia, while no deaths were associated with the system. After this usage of the name Tia, the name was retired and withdrawn from use on the tropical cyclone naming lists. Solomon Islands During November 17, warnings were issued by the Solomon Islands Meteorological Service for parts of Temotu Province in the Solomon Islands, after it became apparent that Tia was moving towards the easternmost islands of Anuta and Tikopia. During that day the system affected the province and came to within of Anuta at around 1800 UTC on November 17, before passing near to Tikopia six hours later. The southernmost Solomon Island of Tikopia was the worst affected island, with 90% of all dwellings destroyed and the remaining 10% either having walls destroyed or roofs blown off. As a result, more than 1000 people were left homeless on the island, which was declared a disaster area by the Solomon Islands National Disaster Council. The cyclone also destroyed seven of the eight church buildings and all but one of the classroom buildings belonging to the two primary schools. Food crops were destroyed with all coconut trees either blown down or uprooted. High seas and waves caused extensive damage to the coasts and flooded low-lying areas, which damaged the taro, other food crops and the water supply on the island due to salt spray. Sustained windspeeds of , wind gusts of and a minimum pressure of were all reported by the automatic weather station on Anuta. Other islands On November 16, the Kiribati islands suffered the side-effects of Cyclone Tia, with several houses in Tarawa and seaweed farms damaged. Late on November 17, the FMS started to release special advisories for Vanuatu after it had become clear that the systems south-southwest movement, would bring the cyclone sufficiently close to the Banks and Torres Islands to cause either gale or storm force winds. Over the next 24 hours, the FMS continued to issue these bulletins as the system moved southwards and brought gale-force winds to Maewo, Pentecost and the Banks Islands before they issued the final advisory early on November 19. Tia was the first of six tropical cyclones to affect Vanuatu during the 1991–92 South Pacific cyclone season, and caused minor damage that was mainly confined to houses, crops and fruit trees on the Banks and Torres Islands. Within the Banks Islands a church was flattened, several roads were blocked and a man was slightly injured by flying debris.

It was one of the first buildings in the city to break away from the Beaux-Arts and Colonial Revival styles that predominated in Washington architecture up to that time. The building was home to congressmen, professionals and other notable people in the 1930s and illustrates the desire to maintain Sixteenth Street as fashionable street on which to reside.

The hour-long episodes were some of the initial shows of Discovery Network's 1999 launch of the Military Channel. Aired as a knock-off of the Clash of Wings (1994) reference book by air historian Walter J. Boyne, the programs were produced in 1998 and aired the next year appearing as some of the initial original content in the launch of the new Discovery Wings cable channel (before its name change in 2005 to the Military Channel). The programs were hosted and partially narrated by Boyne, written by Boyne (also credited as associate producer) together with director- producer John Honey, and presented by executive producer Phillip Osborn. The effort adapted his encyclopedic work of the same name. Like many World War II documentaries involving aircraft, the displayed content utilizes many scenes from gun camera footage and other military films now in the public domain. The series frequently also closely followed and interspersed color film of surviving combat aircraft types from multiple camera angles and in a variety of operations modes. Unlike many documentaries about the era, the series makes no effort to present on-camera interviews, instead focusing on an overarching narrative telling the historic story appropriate to that episode's specific title. Boyne is not the sole narrator, but utilizes other voices to describe details while Boyne appears to sum up and tie together segments as host. Series scope The first air attack of World War II officially commenced at 04:34 hours on September 1, 1939, when three Luftwaffe Ju 87 Stukas attacked railway bridges in Poland. The air war effectively ended at 10:58 hours on August 9, 1945, when a solitary B-29 Superfortress over the Japanese city of Nagasaki dropped the second atomic bomb. The Stukas carried 250 kg bombs: the A-bomb dropped by the B-29 was equivalent to 23,000 tons of TNT and couldn't have been lifted by any plane besides the B-29s. In just six years of warfare, air power had changed and grown in destruction capability almost beyond recognition. Based on the international bestselling book by Walter Boyne, director of the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum, the Clash off Wings series is the definitive film history of aerial warfare during World War II. Immensely detailed the series uses authentic film footage from archives around the world. The series covers the air war in every theatre from 1939 to 1945. From the earliest blitzkriegs against Poland to the pounding of mainland Imperial Japan, from the jungles and mountains of India and Burma in the fighting to support invaded China over the infamous terrain of the Hump in the lofty Himalayas in the Southeast Asia Campaigns. Covering topics as diverse as the Battle of Britain and the Blitz to the eventual massive allied bomber raids into the heart of Nazi Germany — as air superiority was lost by Germany and then won by the allies — and from the great aircraft carrier duels in the Pacific to the bitter air battles over the Soviet Union, Clash of Wings details the great air battles and the role of air power in the Second World War as no other series. The films also feature rarely seen aerial combat footage by all the major combat aircraft types from the World War II period, as well as high-resolution footage of surviving aircraft of each type. Presented by Walter Boyne (author of Clash of Wings) Executive producer: Philip Osborn; Director and producer: John Honey; the production of Networks USA & Llanischen Films LLC (1998).

Episodes Reception Unsupervised received many mixed to negative reviews from critics upon its premiere with its pilot, holding a 3.5 or \\"Awful\\" rating on IGN. Alan Sepinwall gave the show a mixed review, noting that he liked the way Gary and Joel (and generally their classmates) were presented as decent kids instead of making them default stereotypes of poor troublemakers, but also that the show was not that funny. Although disappointed with the premiere, later episodes of the season were given much higher marks with The A.V. Club giving the season one finale an A-.

As a younger son, he was initially destined for an eccesiastical career. He became canon at Speyer. When his father died in 1291, Baden was divided and he received Baden- Pforzheim. Initially, he ruled Baden-Pforzheim jointly with his brother, Herman VIII. From 1300 until his death, he ruled alone. In the conflict between Duke Leopold I of Austria and Emperor Louis IV, he initially sided with Leopold. After a while he changed sides and sided with Louis IV, who in 1334 mortgaged Ortenburg Castle, the cities of Offenburg, Gengenbach and Zell am Harmersbach and the imperial possessions in the Ortenau area to Rudolf IV. In 1335, he inherited Baden-Baden from his first cousin Rudolf Hesso. Rudolf IV died on 25 June 1348. His sons divided the inheritance, with Frederick III taking Baden-Baden and Rudolf V taking Baden-Pforzheim.  Marriage and issue  Rudolf married on 28 February 1318 with Liutgard of Bolanden (d. 1324/25), a daughter of Philip V of Bolanden. This marriage remained childless. After Liutgard's death, he married on 18 February 1326 with Maria of Oettingen (d. 10 June 1369), a daughter of Count Frederick I of Oettingen.

He was inspired by his classmates SCAT and AERO TGF, who were graffiti writers as well. Over the years, his name began to catch light, as his work load increased. Along the years, there have been many artists and illustrators who have had a big impact on him, such as Frank Frazetta, American artists Bernie Wrightson and Rick Griffin, Todd McFarlane, and Chuck Jones. He sees graffiti as more than just letters and pictures braised onto a canvas. He sees it as a form of art, and every art has a spirit.

Part of a treatise on singing plainchant (Modus regulariter accentuandi lectiones matutinales prophetias necnon epistolas et evangelia, published anonymously in Kraków, 1518, but attributed to Sebastian)Elżbieta Witkowska-Zaremba. \\"Sebastian z Felsztyna.\\" In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/25287 (accessed December 16, 2011). Life He was probably born in Felsztyn, in present-day Ukraine on the border with Poland. In 1507 he entered Kraków University, the same year as his compatriot, composer Mikołaj z Chrzanowa. While there he studied music and theology, receiving his baccalaureate in 1509. He may have studied with Heinrich Finck while in Kraków. After graduating, he returned to Felsztyn where he became a chaplain, and later he went to Sanok, also in southeastern Poland, where he was a provost. Musical works and theoretical writings Of his musical works, only three motets survive. They are for four voices, and use a plainchant tenor in long notes – an archaic practice at the time of publication, 1522 – with the other voices sometimes engaging in imitation, in free counterpoint, or in more homophonic textures. All three are preserved in Wawel Cathedral in manuscript. While archaic in style, they show the influence of the Franco-Flemish school, and are a rare early example of four-voice polyphony in Poland. Indeed, Reese acknowledges Felstin's assimilation of Franco-Burgundian influences. Sebastian published a collection of his hymns in 1522 in Kraków, Aliquot hymni ecclesiastici, but no copies survive. Sebastian's theoretical treatises cover the topics of notation and chant. His most popular was Opusculum musices of 1519, which was twice reprinted, and most likely was intended as an instructional tool for singers.

The firm was founded in 1910 by Maximilian Toltz (1857–1932), formerly the chief engineer for the Great Northern Railway under James J. Hill, and Wesley E. King (1879–1959), a civil and structural engineer. Toltz Engineering Company participated in the design of the Como Park Conservatory in 1915. A staff architect, Roy Childs Jones, completed the Hamm Building in 1920. In 1919, Beaver Wade Day (1884–1931) joined the firm, and it was renamed to Toltz, King and Day. The firm designed the Stearns County Courthouse in St. Cloud, Minnesota in 1920 and provided structural engineering services for the Saint Paul Union Depot in 1923. In 1926, they completed the design of the Robert Street Bridge spanning the Mississippi River in St. Paul. The bridge, a rainbow arch design, had several challenges that resulted in its unusual form. The bridge had to reach Kellogg Boulevard at street level at the top of the bluff, while providing enough clearance underneath for the raised platform at the Saint Paul Union Depot, the Chicago Great Western lift bridge, and the passage of riverboats on the river. The bridge was rebuilt in 1989 by the same firm, now known as TKDA. In 1956, the firm changed its name to Toltz, King, Duvall, Anderson, and Associates, to acknowledge civil engineer Arndt Duvall, architect Gerald Anderson, and other architects and engineers. Arndt Duvall became president of the firm in 1959, after King's death. List of projects and designs A number of its works are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.

He established the Association for the Protection of Human Rights and Incarcerated Persons (APRODH) in August 2001. Early life Before Mbonimpa founded the APRODH, he worked as a public servant to the Economy and Finance Ministry for Burundi. He then served as a police officer for the Air and Customs Police; while at this position he was wrongfully accused and arrested for possession of an illegal weapon, and served two years in the Prison Centrale of Mpimba from 1994 to 1996. During those two years of imprisonment, Mbonimpa was frequently tortured and beaten, and it was this experience that inspired him to form APRODH. In 1995, after a year behind bars, he had the idea to create a non-profit organisation, and cooperating with two other inmates, they wrote the articles for Association for the Defence of the Rights of Prisoners. After viewing the effects of prison life, and its abuse of all races and ethnic groups, the association does not discriminate along these lines either, and works to protect the rights of all prisoners. Human rights activism Mbonimpa has created a multidimensional organisation APRODH, not only have they vigorously campaigned for the protection of the basic human rights of all prisoners, including the 9,000 or so people who have been awaiting trial for years in the over crowded prison system. They are also active in the prevention, of torture and sexual violence, as well as the protection of children in the criminal system. Burundi does not have a juvenile detention/criminal system, and those above the age of 15 are tried as adults. Although legally children below this age limit should not be imprisoned, due to civil war and unrest, many become locked up anyway. At the Mpimpa prison male and female children cannot be held separately; this includes the children of the woman being held in the prison as well, most often after being born in the prison: Mbonimpa has received many death threats for his stance and work on improving human rights, however he has not let that take away from his work in Burundi. He received the Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders in 2007 and the Civil Courage Prize in 2017.  Arrest and shooting On May 15, 2014, Pierre Claver Mbonimpa was arrested again in Bujumbura. After questioning, prosecuting officials charged him with endangering internal and external state security for remarks made on the radio 10 days earlier, and using false documents. The remarks and documents relate to allegations that young Burundians were being armed and sent for military training in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo.

The previous two elections, in 2005 and 2011, were for half the council seats and were open to male candidates and voters only. The 2015 election was for two thirds of the council seats, on 284 municipal councils, with both male and female candidates and voters. This was the first election in Saudi Arabia in which women were allowed to vote, the first in which they were allowed to run for office, and the first in which women were elected as politicians. Background Half the seats in municipal councils in Saudi Arabia were chosen in men-only elections in 2005 and 2011. The municipal councils reportedly have \\"little power\\" in Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy. Saudi Arabian women campaigned for the right to participate in the 2011 elections, organizing through the \\"Baladi\\" (My Country) and Saudi Women's Revolution campaigns for women's right to participate. Several women tried to register as electors in Jeddah, Riyadh, and Dammam. A few days before the 2011 election took place, King Abdullah announced that women would be able to participate as voters and candidates in the 2015 election. In the 2015 municipal elections, two-thirds of the council seats were elected positions, and women were allowed as candidates and voters. Preparations Voter registration started on 16 August 2015 in Medina and Mecca, and elsewhere on 22 August, to continue for a 21-day period. Two women voters registered in Medina and Mecca on 16 August. Hatoon al-Fassi of the Baladi campaign said that Baladi had intended to organize training sessions for voter education but was blocked by the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs. About 131,000 women and about 1.35 million men registered to vote. Candidates Male candidates There were 5,938 men registered as candidates. Female candidates There were 978 women registered as candidates; however, many were barred from registering by the authorities. No reasons were given; however, it was noted that a number of them were advocates for the expansion of women's rights in the Kingdom. Haifa al-Hababi, 36 years old as of August 2015, was a candidate. She stated, \\"Change the system. Change is life. The government has given us this tool and I intend to use it.\\" Two women candidates were disqualified. Loujain al-Hathloul, who had been detained for two months after driving from the United Arab Emirates to Saudi Arabia in December 2015, was disqualified; Nassima al-Sadah, a Shia human rights activist from Qatif, was also disqualified. As women in Saudi Arabia are not permitted to address men who are not related to them, women candidates could only speak directly to women voters. At men's campaign meetings, they had to either speak from behind a partition, or have a man read their speech on their behalf. Many women also stated they could not afford the high cost of running an election campaign. Results The turnout for the election was reported as 47%, split down as 82% of the 132,000 female voters registered and 44% of the 1.35m male voters registered. In results released to the Associated Press on 13 December, 20 female candidates were elected to the approximately 2,100 municipal council seats being contested. Salma bint Hizab al-Oteibi became the first elected female politician in Saudi Arabia as a result of the election, when she won a seat on the council in Madrakah in Mecca province.

William Shakespeare's handwriting is known from six surviving signatures, all of which appear on legal documents. It is believed by many scholars that the three pages of the handwritten manuscript of the play Sir Thomas More are also in William Shakespeare's handwriting. Description This secretary alphabet is in a penmanship book by Jehan de Beau-Chesne and John Baildon published in 1570, when Shakespeare would have been five or six years old. This may have been the edition he studied as a child in grammar school. Wolfe, Heather. Learning to Write the Alphabet. The Collation from the Folger Shakespeare Library. Shakespeare's six extant signatures were written in the style known as secretary hand. It was native and common in England at the time, and was the cursive style taught in schools. It is distinct from italic script, which was encroaching as an alternate form (and which is more familiar to readers of today). The secretary hand was popular with authors of Shakespeare's time, including Christopher Marlowe and Francis Bacon. It could be written with ease and swiftness and was conducive to the use of abbreviations. As it was taught in the schools and by tutors, it allowed for great diversity—each writer could choose a style for each letter. Secretary hand can be difficult to decipher for current day readers.Hamilton, Charles. In Search of Shakespeare. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. (1985) p. 12 Shakespeare wrote with a quill in his right hand. A quill would need to be prepared and sharpened. Black ink would be derived from “oak apples” (small lumps in oak trees caused by insects), with iron sulfate and gum arabic added.Edmondson, Paul. Shakespeare: Ideas in Profile. Profile Books (2015). John Heminges and Henry Condell, who edited the First Folio in 1623, wrote that Shakespeare's \\"mind and hand went together, and what he thought he uttered with that easiness that we have scarce received from him a blot in his papers.\\" In his posthumously published essay, Timber: Or, Discoveries, Ben Jonson wrote: > I remember the players have often mentioned it as an honor to Shakespeare, > that in his writing, whatsoever he penned, he never blotted out a line. My > answer hath been, ‘Would he hath blotted a thousand,’ which they thought a > malevolent speech. I had not told posterity this but for their ignorance, > who chose that circumstance to commend their friend by wherein he most > faulted; and to justify mine own candor, for I loved the man, and do honor > his memory on this side idolatry as much as any. He was, indeed, honest, and > of an open and free nature; had an excellent fancy, brave notions, and > gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that facility that sometime it > was necessary he should be stopped.Edmondson, Paul. Shakespeare: Ideas in > Profile. Profile Books (2015) Masson, David. Essays Biographical and > Critical: Chiefly on English Poets. Macmillan. (1856) p. 7 The three-page addition to Sir Thomas More, which is attributed by some to Shakespeare, is written in a fluid manner by a skillful and experienced writer. The writing begins with indications of speed, in the manner of a scrivener, with a practiced sense of uniformity. Then the writing style changes over to a more deliberate and heavier style, as can be seen, for example, in the speeches of Thomas More, which require greater thought and choice of words. Throughout, the writing shows a disposition to play with the pen, to exaggerate certain curves, to use heavier downstrokes, and to finish some final letters with a small flourish. These characteristics are more evident in the slower, deliberate sections. Pollard, Alfred, editor. Shakespeare’s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More. Thompson, E. Maunde. “The Handwriting of the Three Pages Attributed to Shakespeare Compared with His Signatures”. pp. 67–70. Cambridge University Press (1923) Therefore, the handwriting shows a freedom to make variances in style depending on the mood or the composition being written. Pollard, Alfred, editor. Shakespeare’s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More. Thompson, E. Maunde. “The Handwriting of the Three Pages Attributed to Shakespeare Compared with His Signatures”. pp. 67–70. Cambridge University Press (1923) Paleography Serious study of Shakespeare's handwriting began in the 18th century with scholars Edmond Malone and George Steevens. By the late nineteenth century paleographers began to make detailed study of the evidence in the hope of identifying Shakespeare's handwriting in other surviving documents. In those cases when the actual handwriting is not extant, the study of the published texts has yielded indirect evidence of his handwriting quirks through readings and apparent misreadings by compositors. To give one example of this, in the early published versions of Shakespeare's plays there is a recurrence of an upper case letter \\"C\\" when the lower case is called for. This might indicate that Shakespeare was fond of such a usage in his handwriting, and that the compositors (working from the handwriting) followed the usage. When trying to determine who the author is of either a printed work or a pen-and-ink manuscript, this is one possible method of discovering such indications. Pollard, Alfred, editor. Shakespeare’s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More. Wison, J. Dover. “Bibliographical Links Between the Three Pages and the Good Quartos”. pp. 67–70. Cambridge University Press (1923) Signatures There are six surviving signatures, attached to four legal documents, that are generally recognised as authentic: * a deposition in the Bellott v Mountjoy case, dated 11 May 1612 * the purchase of a house in Blackfriars, London, dated 10 March 1613 * the mortgage of the same house, dated 11 March 1613 * his Last Will and Testament, which contains three signatures, one on each page, dated 25 March 1616 The signatures appear as follows: * Willm Shakp * William Shakspēr * Wm Shakspē * William Shakspere * Willm Shakspere * By me William Shakspeare The first signature includes a short horizontal stroke above the letter \\"m\\" and a horizontal stroke or flourish in the stem of the letter \\"p\\", which may be read as \\"per\\" or, less likely, as an indication of abbreviation. The fifth signature also contains a horizontal stroke above the letter \\"m\\". All of his signatures are written in his native English script, which he would have learned as a young boy in school. He used the long Italian cursive letter \\"s\\" in the center of his surname, a concession to the new style, except for the fifth signature, in which he reverts to the native English long \\"s\\". Greg, W.W. editor. Shakespeare’s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More. Cambridge University Press, 2010. . pp. 58–61 The Blackfriars signatures are fitted into the narrow space of the seal holder Three of these signatures are abbreviated versions of the surname, using breviographic conventions of the time, which was common practice. For example, Edmund Spenser sometimes wrote his name out in full (spelling his first name Edmund or Edmond), but often used the abbreviated forms \\"Ed: spser\\" or \\"Edm: spser\\".Albert Charles Hamilton (ed), The Spenser Encyclopedia, University of Toronto Press, 1990, p. 346. The signatures on the Blackfriar's document may have been abbreviated because they had to be squeezed into the small space provided by the seal-tag, which they were legally authenticating. The three signatures on the will were first reproduced by the 18th-century scholar George Steevens, who copied them as accurately as he could by hand and then had his drawings engraved. The facsimiles were first printed in the 1778 edition of Shakespeare's plays, edited by Steevens and Samuel Johnson.Edward Maude Thompson, Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study, Oxford: Clarendon, 1916. p. x. The publication of the signatures led to a controversy about the proper spelling of Shakespeare's name. The paleographer Edward Maunde Thompson later criticised the Steevens transcriptions, arguing that his original drawings were inaccurate. Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study. Clarendon Press (1916) p. x The two signatures relating to the house sale were identified in 1768 and acquired by David Garrick, who presented them to Steevens' colleague Edmond Malone. By the later nineteenth century the signatures had been photographed. Photographs of these five signatures were published by Sidney Lee.Sidney Lee, Shakespeare's Handwriting: Facsimiles of the Five Authentic Autograph Signatures, London: Smith Elder, 1899. The final signature, on the Bellott v Mountjoy deposition, was discovered by 1909 by Charles William Wallace.Wallace, Charles William, \\"Shakespeare and his London Associates,\\" Nebraska University Studies, October 1910. It was first published by him in the March 1910 issue of Harper's Magazine and reprinted in the October 1910 issue of Nebraska University Studies. Handwriting analysis Facsimile of a page written by 'Hand D', in all likelihood written by William Shakespeare Although some scholars took note of, and reproduced, Shakespeare's handwriting as early as the 18th century, the paleographer Sir Edward Maunde Thompson wrote in 1916 that the subject of Shakespeare's handwriting had “never been subjected to a thorough and systematic study.” One reason for this neglect is that the only examples of Shakespeare's handwriting that were known to earlier scholars were five authentic signatures. Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study. Clarendon Press (1916) p. 1 A further difficulty was that three of the known signatures were written in the last weeks of Shakespeare's life, when he may have been suffering from a tremor or otherwise enfeebled by illness, and the other two had been written under conditions that restrained free movement of the hand. Those signed to the Blackfrairs mortgage had to be squeezed into the narrow space of the seal.E.M. Thompson, Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1916, pp. 6–7. Under the circumstances, with evidence limited to those five signatures, an attempt to reconstitute the handwriting that Shakespeare actually used might have been considered impossible. But then in 1910, the discovery of the sixth signature on the Bellott v Mountjoy deposition changed all this. This signature was written with a free hand, and it was the key to an important part of the problem. Thompson identified distinctive characteristics in Shakespeare's hand, which include delicate introductory upstrokes of the pen, the use of the Italian long “s” in the middle of his surname in his signatures, an unusual form of the letter “k”, and a number of other personal variations.S. Schoenbaum, A Documentary Life, Oxford University Press/Scolar Press, 1975 p. 157. Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study. Clarendon Press (1916) p. 29 The first time it was suggested that the three-page addition to the play Sir Thomas More was composed and also written out by William Shakespeare was in a correspondence to the publication Notes and Queries in July 1871 by Richard Simpson, who was not an expert in handwriting. Simpson, Richard. in a correspondence “Are there any extant MSS in Shakespeare’s handwriting?” written to Notes and Queries, 4th Series, volume viii, p. 1 (1 July 1871) Referenced and quoted in: Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study. Clarendon Press (1916) pp. xii, 38 Simpson's note was titled: \\"Are there any extant MSS in Shakespeare’s handwriting?\\" His idea received little serious attention for a few decades. Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study. Clarendon Press (1916) p. xii After more than a year James Spedding wrote to the same publication in support of that particular suggestion by Simpson, saying that the handwriting found in Sir Thomas More \\"agrees with [Shakespeare’s] signature, which is a simple one, and written in the ordinary character of the time.\\" Spedding, James. Notes and Queries, 4th Series, (21 September 1872) Referenced and quoted in: Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study. Clarendon Press (1916) p. 39 After a detailed study of the More script, which included analysing every letter formation, and then comparing it to the signatures, Thompson concluded that \\"sufficient close resemblances have been detected to bring the two handwritings together and to identify them as coming from one and the same hand,\\" and that \\"in this addition to the play of Sir Thomas More we have indeed the handwriting of William Shakespeare.\\" Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study. Clarendon Press (1916) p. 53Schoenbaum, A Documentary Life, p. 158: 'The cumulative evidence for Shakespeare's hand in the 'More' fragment may not be sufficient to shake away all doubts—but who else in this period formed an a with a horizontal spur, spelt silence as scilens, and had identical associative patterns of thought and image? All roads converge on Shakespeare'. Thompson believed that the first two pages of the script were written quickly, using writing techniques that indicate Shakespeare had received \\"a more thorough training as a scribe than had been thought probable\\". These pages contain abbreviations and contractions of words which were \\"in common use among lawyers and trained secretaries of the day.\\" These pages show more of the characteristics of \\"the scrivener\\", but the third page, having been written with slower deliberation, reveals more of Shakespeare's own quirks, or, as he put it, \\"more of the hand of the author\\". In addition there are in the three pages suggestions of a \\"tendency to formality and ornamental calligraphy.\\" Thompson, Sir Edward Maunde. Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study. Clarendon Press (1916) pp. 55–56 Editor’s interpretations thumbFrom the play, Sir Thomas More: \\"but chartered unto them, what would you think to be thus used, this is the strangers case and this your mountanish inhumanity\\" The problems editors or compositors can face when transforming the handwritten manuscript into the printed page are demonstrated in the printed edition of Sir Thomas More, edited in 1990 by Gabrieli and Melchiori. In the following line spoken by More addressing the mob: \\"This is the strangers’ case, and this your mountanish inhumanity,\\" the reading of the word \\"mountanish\\" is supported by references in Twelfth Night and Cymbeline. However, in the handwritten manuscript by Hand D, the \\"un\\" in the word has only three strokes, or minims, which makes it look like an \\"m\\": as \\"momtanish\\". So the word has been read by modern editors as \\"moritanish\\" (referring to the inhabitants of Mauritania), or as \\"momtanish\\" (a contraction of \\"Mohamadanish\\"—referring to the followers of Mohammad), or as \\"mountainish\\" (suggesting huge and uncivil), as well as other readings and spellings.Munday, Anthony and others.

Handwriting thought by some to be Shakespeare's A possible seventh signature on the book Archaionomia Signature discovered on the title page of Lambarde's Archaionomia. This is a reversed photograph of the ink that seeped through to the verso side of the page, the image was reversed so that the signature reads in the legible direction. Easton, Roger L. jr. “Spectral Imaging of Shakespeare’s Seventh Signature”. The Collation; a Gathering of Scholarship from the Folger Shakespeare Library. March 19, 2012. In the late 1930s a possible seventh Shakespeare signature was found in the Folger Library copy of William Lambarde's Archaionomia (1568), a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws. In 1942, Giles Dawson published a report cautiously concluding that the signature was genuine, and 30 years later he concluded that there was \\"an overwhelming probability that the writer of all seven signatures was the same person, William Shakespeare.\\"Dawson, Giles. \\"A Seventh Signature for Shakespeare.\\" Shakespeare Quarterly 43 (Spring 1992): 72–79, [79]. Nicholas Knight published a book-length study a year later with the same conclusion.Knight, W. Nicholas. Shakespeare's Hidden Life: Shakespeare at the Law 1585–1595. New York: Mason & Lipscomb, 1973. Samuel Schoenbaum considered that the signature was more likely to be genuine than not with \\"a better claim to authenticity than any other pretended Shakespeare autograph,\\" while also writing that \\"it is premature ... to classify it as the poet's seventh signature.\\"Schoenbaum, Samuel. William Shakespeare: Records and Images. New York: Oxford University Press, 1981, p. 109.

In 2012 Gregory Heyworth, as head of the Lazarus Project, which has a mission to use advanced technology to create images of culturally important artifacts, along with his students at the University of Mississippi, used a 50-megapixel multispectral digital imaging system to enhance the signature and get a better idea of what it looked like.Pappas, Stephanie. \\"Restored Scribble May Be Shakespeare's Signature\\".

The body of Shakespeare’s last will and testament The first person to claim that the body of Shakespeare's last will and testament was written in Shakespeare's own handwriting was John Cordy Jeaffreson, who compared the letters in the will and in the signature, and then expressed his findings in a letter to Athenaeum (1882). He suggests that the will was intended to be a rough draft, and that the progressively deteriorating script indicates an enfeebling illness, an illness which may have caused the “rough draft” to become the will itself. Elze, Karl. William Shakespeare: A Literary Biography. G. Bell & Sons. (1888) p. 509 Jeaffreson, John Cordy. A Book of Recollections, Volume 2. Hurst and Blackett (1894) p. 227 John Pym Yeatman is another who considered that the body of the will is in Shakespeare's handwriting. In his book, Is William Shakespeare’s Will Holographic? (1901), he argues against the often repeated idea that Francis Collins (or \\"Francis Collyns\\" as it is often spelled), Shakespeare's lawyer, wrote the will. Among the evidence that Yeatman offers, is Collins' signature on the will itself. Collins’ name occurs three times in the will: twice in the body, and the third time when Collyns signs his name at the bottom of page three. The body of the will, along with Shakespeare's own signature, are written in handwriting known as the secretary hand, whereas the signature by Collins, particularly the initial letters, is written in a modern hand. The difference between the two handwriting styles is primarily in the formations used for each letter of the alphabet. Yeatman then states that the last insertion regarding the second-best bed, is in a handwriting that \\"exactly corresponds with the signature below it.\\" This he adds, is \\"of the utmost value, in proof that one hand wrote them both.\\" Yeatman, J. Pym. Is William Shakespeare’s Will Holographic? Published by the author. (1901) p. 12 thumb Above: The name of the lawyer \\"Francis Collins\\" as it appears in the body of the will. Below: Collins' signature on the will. In 1985 manuscript expert Charles Hamilton compared the signatures, the handwritten additions to the play Sir Thomas More, and the body of the last will and testament. In his book In Search of Shakespeare he placed letters from each document side-by-side to demonstrate the similarities and his reasons for considering that they were written by the same hand.Hamilton, Charles. In Search of Shakespeare: A Reconnaissance Into the Poet's Life and Handwriting. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (1985) The handwriting in the body of Shakespeare's last will and testament indicates that it is written all by one person in at least two sessions: First the entire will of three pages, then a revision on the lower half of the first page that runs over onto page 2, and finally the additions or bequests that are inserted between the lines. The lower half of page one, the part that was written later than page 2 and 3, shows a disintegration of the penmanship. This problem worsens until the last written line, leaving his second-best bed to his wife, is almost indecipherable. The ink used for the interlinear additions is different from the ink in the main body of the will, but it is the same ink that is used by the four witnesses that signed the will.Tannenbaum, Samuel A. Reclaiming One of Shakspere’s Signature. University of North Carolina Press (1925)Chambers, Edmund K. William Shakespeare: A study of Facts and Problems. Oxford: Clarendon Press. Volume 2, p. 173 (1930) Handwriting in a letter signed by the Earl of Southampton The Shakespearean scholar, Eric Sams points to a letter written by the 20-year-old Earl of Southampton to a Mr. Hicks (or Hyckes) regarding Lord Burghley, at a time when Southampton had not yet agreed to marry Burghley's granddaughter. The letter is signed by the Earl of Southampton, but the body of the letter was written by someone else. It is dated 26 June 1592, a year when it is thought that Shakespeare may have first encountered Southampton and had begun writing the sonnets. Sams notices that the handwriting in the body of the letter is literally a secretary hand, and it resembles the handwriting found in the addition to Sir Thomas More by Hand D. After close scrutiny of the letters and pen strokes in each, and referencing the detailed descriptions found in Edward Thompson's Shakespeare's Handwriting: A Study, Sams finds that there are enough similarities to merit further consideration. This letter was written by Southampton regarding one of his houses that was in need of repair, and as Eric Sams points out, it was written at a time when Southampton was the recipient of sonnets written by Shakespeare that contained imagery suggesting the young lord might consider repairing his house: \\"Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate/Which to repair should be thy chief desire.\\" (Sonnet 10, lines 7–8) And \\"who lets so fair a house fall to decay?\\" (Sonnet 13, line 9)Sams, Eric.

On 4 December 1612 Shakespeare's friends, Elizabeth and Adrian Quiney, sold a house to a man named William Mountford for 131 pounds. The deed of sale, written out apparently by a legal clerk, was witnessed and signed twice in different parts of the deed by William Shakespeare's daughter, Judith, who used for her signature a squiggle with two loops in it. Judith's given name and surname were written out on either side of Judith's marks, by someone who was not the clerk, or the witnesses or the signers. Paleographer Charles Hamilton studied this document and found that Judith's surname as it is written out is so similar to the surname in Shakespeare's own signature as it appears on other documents, that it may be reasonable to consider that Shakespeare could have been there at the signing of the deed, and assisted his daughter as she made her mark. Hamilton considers that there may be reasons for Shakespeare not witnessing the document himself. For example, he could have been involved in some way that would have precluded him from acting as witness, either in the drawing up of the deed or in advising the Quineys.Hamilton, Charles. ‘’In Search of Shakespeare: A Reconnaissance Into the Poet's Life and Handwriting’’.

The applications to grant a coat-of-arms to John Shakespeare A pen-and-ink sketch of Shakespeare's shield drawn on the first rough draft of the application to grant a coat-of-arms to John Shakespeare. On 20 October 1596 a rough draft was drawn up for an application to the College of Heralds for Shakespeare's father to be granted a coat-of- arms. This draft has numerous emendations and corrections, and it appears to have been written by someone \\"inexperienced in drawing up heraldic drafts.\\" Tannenbaum, Samuel, A. The Shakespeare Coat-of-Arms. The Tenny Press (1908) The script is written at a great speed, but with the fluid, easy character of one well practiced with a quill. The velocity of the writing is increased by shortcuts and abbreviations. Formalities of punctuation and consistent spelling are left behind, as words are pared down. Loops and tails are sheared, and letters are flattened for speed. The handwriting slows down only to produce a clearly legible italic script for proper nouns and family names. Later that day, the same person drew up a second rough draft based on the first one, incorporating the edits that were indicated in the previous draft. This application was ultimately successful, and the coat-of-arms was granted. A third application was drafted three years later in 1599. This time it was applying to have impaled onto Shakespeare's coat-of-arms, the arms of the Ardens of Wilmcote, Shakespeare's mother's family. All three drafts include a pen-and-ink sketch of the proposed coat-of-arms: a shield, with a spear, surmounted by a falcon standing on its left leg, grasping a spear with its right talon. The coat-of-arms is seen to be pictorially expressing Shakespeare's name with the verb \\"shake\\" shown by the falcon with its fluttering wings grasping a \\"spear\\". Tannenbaum, Samuel Aaron.

William Dethick is mentioned in all the application drafts, as the \\"Garter-Principal king of Arms in England\\". It has been suggested that Dethick wrote the drafts,Lambert, D.H. Shakespeare Documents: Cartae Shakespeareanae (1904)Tucker, Stephen, editor. The Assignment of Arms to Shakespeare and Arden (1884) but Dethick's handwriting, a combination of secretary and italic scripts, appears to be quite different.Hamilton, Charles. In Search of Shakespeare: A Reconnaissance Into the Poet's Life and Handwriting. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (1985) p. 137 The idea that Shakespeare himself made out the applications, and that it is his handwriting on the rough drafts, was first raised by Samuel A. Tannenbaum. Author and handwriting expert Charles Hamilton, following Tannenbaum’s suggestion, published examples of handwriting from the applications alongside examples of handwriting by Hand D from the play, Sir Thomas More.Hamilton, Charles. In Search of Shakespeare: A Reconnaissance Into the Poet's Life and Handwriting. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (1985) p. 144 Hamilton considers that a comparison of the handwriting in the examples indicates that the same person wrote both, and along with other evidence, that it was Shakespeare.Hamilton, Charles. In Search of Shakespeare: A Reconnaissance Into the Poet's Life and Handwriting. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (1985) p. 127-137 Edward III Though the playwright's handwriting for Edward III has not survived, the text, as printed, has been analyzed in order to discover indications of characteristics that the handwriting might contain, in the same way that the First Folio and other printed texts have been scrutinized. Sams, Eric. Shakespeare’s Edward III. Yale University Press. (1996) . p. 192 This has led to findings that may support the attribution of this play to Shakespeare. For example, scholar Eric Sams, assuming that the pages by Hand D in the play Sir Thomas More are indeed Shakespeare's, points out that Hand D shows what scholar Alfred W. Pollard refers to as \\"excessive carelessness\\" in minim errors—that is, writing the wrong number of downstrokes in the letters i, m, n, and u. Pollard, Alfred, editor. Shakespeare’s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More. Cambridge University Press (1923) p. 117 This particular characteristic is indicated in numerous misreadings by the original compositor who set the printed type for Edward III. This is also found in the Good Quartos, Pollard, Alfred, editor. Shakespeare’s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More. Cambridge University Press (1923) pp. 117–118 which are thought to be printed from Shakespeare's handwritten manuscripts. For a second example, Hand D uses a short horizontal stroke above a letter to indicate contraction, but twice omits it. This characteristic is indicated by the compositor's misreadings in a number of instances found in Edward III. And in another example, Hand D and the Good Quartos often show \\"the frequent and whimsical appearance of an initial capital C, in a way which shows that Shakespeare’s pen was fond of using this letter in place of the minuscule.\\" Pollard, Alfred, editor. Shakespeare’s Hand in the Play of Sir Thomas More. Cambridge University Press (1923) p. 115 This characteristic occurs throughout both the Sonnets and Edward III. Forgeries  The Ireland Shakespeare forgeries  In London in the 1790s the author, Samuel Ireland, announced a great discovery of Shakespearean manuscripts, including four plays. This turned out to be a hoax created with great effort by his son, William Henry Ireland. It fooled many experts, caused great excitement, and a production of one of the plays was announced. Shakespearean scholar Edmond Malone was one who was not taken in. The forged handwriting and signatures bore little or no resemblance to Shakespeare's. Malone said it was a clumsy fraud filled with errors and contradictions, and detailed his reasons. William Henry Ireland eventually confessed. Stewart, Doug. “To Be...Or Not: The Greatest Shakespeare Forgery” Smithsonian Magazine. June 2010. A forged signature on a book by Montaigne The alleged signature in Florio's translation of Montaigne. On a loose fly-leaf of a copy of John Florio’s translation of the works of Montaigne, is a signature that reads \\"Willm. Shakspere\\". The signature is now widely recognized as a poor forgery, but it has taken in scholars in the past. The book's first known owner was the Reverend Edward Patteson, who lived in the 1780s in Staffordshire, a few miles from Stratford-upon-Avon. The book was auctioned for a large amount (100 pounds) in 1838 to a London bookseller named Pickering, who then sold it to the British Museum. Frederic Madden accepted it as authentic in his pamphlet Observations on an Autograph of Shakspere and the Orthography of his name (1838), Madden, Frederick. Observations on an autograph of Shakspere, and the orthography of his name. Oxford University (1838) and so did Samuel A. Tannenbaum in his essay \\"Reclaiming One of Shakspere’s Signatures\\" (1925).Tannenbaum, Samuel A. \\"Reclaiming One of Shakspere’s Signatures\\". University of North Carolina Press (1925) Others, including John Louis Haney writing in 1906, were not taken in. A close consideration and analysis of the signature and each letter shows it to differ markedly from any of the authentic signatures.Hamilton, Charles.

She has released a series of well-regarded solo albums, and has either toured or played with Wilco, the Indigo Girls, Feist, Yo La Tengo, Dump, and the Mountain Goats, among other bands and musicians. Paste magazine has called her a \\"songwriter's songwriter\\", describing her albums as \\"master classes in economy and clarity.\\" While she is one of a limited number of notable independent musicians who is publicly out as gay, she does not write music obviously targeted to a gay audience. She is based in Brooklyn and in addition to writing and performing her own music, she also runs a record label, Kiam Records, with seven other artists on its roster. Background O'Connor was born in Putnam, Connecticut, and moved with her family to Florida while in high school. She did not learn to play guitar until she was 22, after graduating from Emory University. Her first performing experience came as part of the Atlanta-based band Violet, a group that was compared at the time to the Pixies and X. After quitting the band she moved to New York City in 2000 and began playing solo. She supported herself by working a series of odd jobs in book stores and record stores. The most enjoyable and useful job she landed was working in the publicity office at the well-known music venue/record label the Knitting Factory.\\"I’d work in the office all day, then go have some beer and watch a show,\\" she told Time Out New York in 2006, about her experience there. \\"As someone who wanted to play music, it was incredibly inspiring being around all of that.\\" Career Her first recording was an EP that she self- released in 2000 called Truth Love Work. Reviewing the disc, Time Out New York wrote: \\"O'Connor is another Liz Phair or Elliott Smith waiting to happen\\" and praised her \\"understated guitar-based songs\\" and \\"matter of fact lyrics.\\" She followed the EP with a self-titled full-length CD in 2002, which she self- released on an imprint she called Kiam Records. Her next album, The Color and the Light, was released by Red Panda Records in 2005. Later that year, she signed a deal with Matador Records, based on her performance at the SXSW music festival. Her Matador debut, Over the Mountain, Across the Valley and Back to the Stars, was written in the aftermath of a personally difficult year, during which, among other things, she lost her older sister to brain cancer. She had previously lost a sister in a car accident in 1998. The album was generally well-received, with critics noting a pervasive sense of loss throughout the album. The music web site Pitchfork called the song Sister \\"one of the most genuinely affecting pop songs you'll hear all year, capably expressing adult pain without any delusions that pain makes you particularly soulful or special.\\" Even though she was signed with Matador at this point, O'Connor kept her own Kiam Records label running, and had begun releasing albums by other artists on the label. She also used the Kiam imprint to release a couple of 7-inch vinyl singles in 2007. Her second album for Matador was 2008's Here With Me, a more upbeat album that was also given a largely positive reception. Spin wrote that her \\"unflinching lyrics and stunningly strong voice leap from distressing folk ballads to buzzing rock with ease.\\" CMJ wrote that Here With Me \\"is so understated, that it's almost too easy to take for granted how good she is at what she does.\\" O'Connor has always been out, but it became a bit more visible when the cover of Here With Me featured a picture of her planting a kiss on the cheek of her girlfriend. She has never actively sought a lesbian audience, however, telling the web site AfterEllen.com: \\"I think I have avoided it in some ways, literally\\", while adding, \\"I mean, I'm gay and I'm completely comfortable with that, but it's never been a thing that's been related to what I do musically. It didn't seem relevant. With this record, it just kind of happened.\\" O'Connor was dropped from Matador after Here With Me succeeded critically but not popularly. O'Connor felt burned out and discouraged, and went back to working odd jobs around New York, including bartending on Broadway. After she got back to recording, she decided to release the album I Want What You Want on her own label largely because she did not want to wait to have to find a record deal somewhere. \\"I happen to have a record label, so I figured why not?\\" she told NBCNewYork.com in October 2011. O'Connor released I Want What You Want on Kiam Records on November 8, 2011, which is her birthday. Guitar World called the album \\"bitingly frank and melodically gorgeous\\". In the past she has hired a lead guitarist for most of her songs but this time she did more of her own guitar playing. She toured in support of the album in the first half of 2012, and played at SXSW that spring. In the fall of 2013, a song O'Connor co-wrote called \\"Running Blues\\" was premiered on the FX biker drama Sons of Anarchy.

Making internet-based social networking both a cultural and financial phenomenon.  Psychology of social networking  A social network is a social structure made up of individuals or organizations who communicate and interact with each other. Social networking sites – such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest and LinkedIn – are defined as technology-enabled tools that assist users with creating and maintaining their relationships. A study found that middle schooler's reported using social media to see what their friends are doing, to post pictures, and to connect with friends. Human behavior related to social networking is influenced by major individual differences. Meaning that people differ quite systematically in the quantity and quality of their social relationships. Two of the main personality traits that are responsible for this variability are the traits of extraversion and introversion. Extraversion refers to the tendency to be socially dominant, exert leadership, and influence on others. Contrastingly, introversion refers to the tendency of a person to have a disposition of shyness, social phobia, or even avoid social situations altogether, which could lead to a reduction in the number of potential contacts that person may have. These individual differences may result in different social networking outcomes. Other psychological factors related to social media are: depression, anxiety, attachment, self-identity, and the need to belong.  Neuroscience  The neural systems being strengthened to support social media use rely on three domains; social cognition, self- referential cognition, and social reward processing. When someone posts something, they think of how their audience will react, while the audience thinks of the motivations behind posting the information. Both parties are analyzing the other's thoughts and feelings, which coherently rely on multiple network systems of the brain which are: the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporoparietal junction, anterior temporal lobes, inferior frontal gyri, and posterior cingulate cortex. All of these systems work to help us process social behaviors and thoughts drawn out on social media. Social media requires a great deal of self-referential thought. People use social media as a platform to express their opinions and show off their past and present selves. In other words, as Bailey Parnell said in her Ted Talk, we're showing off our \\"highlight reel\\" (4). When receiving feedback from others, we obtain more reflected self-appraisal and then start to compare our social behaviors or our \\"highlights\\" to other users. Self-referential thought involves activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex. The brain uses these particular systems when thinking of oneself. Social media also provides us with a constant supply of rewards that keeps us coming back for more. Whenever we receive a like or a new follower, it activates the brain's social reward system which includes the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and ventral tegmental area. These areas of the brain become strengthened while other parts of the brain start to weaken. Technology is encouraging us to multi-task, seeing as how easy it is to switch from one task to another by opening another tab or using two devices at once. The brain's hippocampus is mainly associated with memory, particularly long-term memory. In a study done by Russell Poldark, a professor at UCLA, they found that \\"for the task learned without distraction, the hippocampus was involved. However, for the task learned with the distraction of the beeps, the hippocampus was not involved; but the striatum was, which is the brain system that underlies our ability to learn new skills.\\" The overall result from the study is that multitasking will cause us to rely on the striatum more than the hippocampus, changing the way we learn. The striatum is known to be connected to mainly the brain's reward system. The brain will make the neurons to the striatum strengthen while making the neurons to the hippocampus weaken as a way to make the brain more efficient. Because our brain starts to rely on the striatum more than the hippocampus, it becomes harder for us to process new information. Nicholas Carr, author of The Shallows: How The Internet Is Changing Our Brains, agrees: \\"What psychologists and brain scientists tell us about interruptions is that they have a fairly profound effect on the way we think. It becomes much harder to sustain attention, to think about one thing for a long period of time, and to think deeply when new stimuli are pouring at you all day long. I argue that the price we pay for being constantly inundated with information is a loss of our ability to be contemplative and to engage in the kind of deep thinking that requires you to concentrate on one thing.\\"  Depression  As the internet first began to grow in popularity, researchers noted an association between increases in internet usage and decreases in offline social involvement and psychological well-being. Investigators explained these findings through the hypothesis that the internet supports poor quality relationships. In light of the recent emergence of online social networking, there has been growing concern of a possible relationship between individuals’ activities on these forums and symptoms of psychopathology, particularly depression. Research has shown a positive correlation between time spent on social networking sites and depressive symptoms. One possible explanation for this relationship is that people use social networking sites as a method of social comparison, which leads to social comparison bias. Adolescents who used Facebook and Instagram to compare themselves with and seek reassurance from other users experienced more depressive symptoms. It is likely, though, that the effects of social comparison on social networking sites is influenced by who people are interacting with on those sites. Specifically, Instagram users who followed a higher percentage of strangers were more likely to show an association between Instagram use and depressive symptoms than were users who followed a lower percentage of strangers. However, research support for a relationship between online social networking and depression remains mixed. Banjanin and colleagues (2015), for example, found a relationship between increased internet use and depressive symptoms, but no relationship between time spent on social networking sites and depressive symptoms. Several other studies have similarly found no relationship between online social networking and depression.  Suicide  As found in a journal article from the American Academy of Pediatrics cyberbullying can lead to \\"profound psychosocial outcomes including depression, anxiety, severe isolation, and, tragically, suicide.” (800–804). This introduces relationship between social networking and suicide. Cyberbullying on social media has a strong correlation to causes of suicide among adolescents and young adults. Results of a study by Hinduja and Patchin examining a large sample of middle school-aged adolescents found that those who experienced cyberbullying were twice as likely to attempt or be successful in committing suicide.  Attachment  In psychology, attachment theory is a model that attempts to describe the interpersonal relationships people have throughout their lives. The most commonly recognized four styles of attachment in adults are: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant, and fearful- avoidant. With the rapid increase in social networking sites, scientists have become interested in the phenomenon of people relying on these sites for their attachment needs. Attachment style has been significantly related to the level of social media use and social orientation on Facebook. Additionally, attachment anxiety has been found to be predictive of less feedback seeking and Facebook usage, whereas attachment avoidance was found to be predictive less feedback seeking and usage. The study found that anxiously attached individuals more frequently comment, \\"like,\\" and post. Furthermore, the authors suggest that anxious people behave more actively on social media sites because they are motivated to seek positive feedback from others. Despite their attempts to fulfill their needs, data suggests that individuals who use social media to fulfill these voids are typically disappointed and further isolate themselves by reducing their face-to-face interaction time with others.  Self-identity  One's self-identity, also commonly known as self-concept, can be defined as a collection of beliefs an individual has about his or herself. It can also be defined as an individual's answer to \\"Who am I?\\". Social media offers a means of exploring and forming self-identity, especially for adolescents and young adults. Early adolescence has been found to be the period in which most online identity experimentation occurs, compared to other periods of development. Researchers have identified some of the most common ways early adolescents explore identity are through self- exploration (e.g. to investigate how others react), social compensation (e.g. to overcome shyness), and social facilitation (e.g. to facilitate relationship formation). Additionally, early adolescents use the Internet more to talk to strangers and form new relationships, whereas older adolescents tend to socialize with current friends.\\" Individuals have a high need for social affiliation but find it hard to form social connections in the offline world, and social media may afford a sense of connection that satisfies their needs for belonging, social feedback, and social validation.\\" Of the various concepts comprising self-identity, self-esteem and self-image, specifically body image, has been given much attention in regards to its relationship with social media usage. Despite the popularity of social media, the direct relationship between Internet exposure and body image has been examined in only a few studies. In one study looking at over 150 high school students, survey data regarding online social networking use and body image was collected. With students reporting an average of two to three hours per day online, online social media usage has been significantly related to an internalization of thin ideals, appearance comparison, weight dissatisfaction, and drive for thinness. In a more recent study that focused more specifically on Facebook usage in over 1,000 high school girls, the same association between amount of use and body dissatisfaction was found, with Facebook users reporting significantly higher levels of body dissatisfaction than non-users. Current research findings suggest that a negative relationship between self- image and social media usage for adolescents. In other words, the more an adolescent uses social media, the more likely he or she is to feel bad about themselves, more specifically regarding how they look.  The need to belong   Belongingness  Belongingness is the personal experience of being involved in a system or group. There are two major components of belongingness which are the feeling of being valued or needed in the group and fitting into the group. The sense of belongingness is said to stem from attachment theories.Bowlby, J. (2012). A secure base: Parent-child attachment and healthy human development (S. Güneri, Trans.). İstanbul, Turkey: Psikoterapi Enstitüsü Eğitim Yayınları. Neubaum and Kramer (2015) state that individuals with a greater desire to form attachments, have a stronger need for belonging in a group. Roy Baumeister and Mark Leary discussed the need to belong theory in a paper in 1995. They discuss the strong effects of belongingness and stated that humans have a \\"basic desire to form social attachments.\\" Without social interactions, we are deprived of emotions and are prone to more illness, physical and psychological, in the future. In 2010, Judith Gere and Geoff MacDonald found inconsistencies in the research done on this topic and reported updated findings. Research still supported that lack of social interactions lead to negative outcomes in the future. When these needs were not met, an individual's daily life seemed to be negatively affected. However, questions about an individual's interpersonal problems, such as sensitivity and self-regulation, still seem to be unknown. In today's world, social media may be the outlet in which the need to belong theory is fulfilled for individuals.  Perceived social closeness  Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, etc. are updated daily to include details of people's personal lives and what they are doing. This in turn gives the perception of being close to people without actually speaking with them. Individuals contribute to social media by ‘liking’ posts, commenting, updating statuses, tweeting, posting photos, videos and more. Sixty Facebook users were recruited in a study by Neubaum and Kramer (2015) to take part in a series of questionnaires, spend ten minutes on Facebook and then complete a post- Facebook perceptions and an emotional status questionnaires. These individuals perceived more social closeness on Facebook that lead to maintaining relationships. Individuals with a higher need to belong also relied on Facebook, but in more private messages. This allowed these individuals to belong in a one-on-one setting or in a more personal way with a group of members who are more significant to them. Active Facebook users, individuals who posted and contributed to their newsfeed, had a greater sense of social closeness, whereas passive Facebook users, who only viewed posts and did not contribute to the newsfeed, had a lesser sense of social closeness. These findings indicate that social closeness and belonging on social media is dependent on the individual's own interactions and usage style.  Group membership  In a study conducted by Cohen & Lancaster (2014), 451 individuals were asked to complete a survey online. The results suggested that social media usage during television viewing made individuals feel like they were watching the shows in a group setting. Different emotional reactions to the show, were found on all social media platforms due to hashtags of the specific show. These emotional reactions were to certain parts of the show, reactions to characters, and commenting on the overall show. In this way, social media enhanced people's social interactions just as if they were face- to-face coviewing television. Individuals with high needs to belong can use social media to participate in social interactions regularly, in a broader sense (Cohen & Lancaster, 2014)  References  * Digital media use and mental health Technology in society ","title":"Social media and psychology"},{"id":"34071259","text":"Valentina Kogan (born 19 March 1980) is an Argentine handball goalkeeper.

They were founded to answer a call to care for orphans, the poor, the sick and the suffering. Foundation The founder was born Peter Wirth on 15 October 1830 in Niederbreitbach, Germany, the youngest of four children. He lost his father at the age of ten, only to lose his mother as well the following year. He was then taken in by an uncle with whom he lived until he was 19 years old. He was apprenticed and taught the trade of shoemaker, being declared a Master craftsman at the age of 24. During this time, he was introduced to the Third Order of St. Francis and became a member.Franziskanerbrüder vom hl. Kreuz \\"Bruder Jakobus Wirth\\" Feeling called to lead a more religious life, Wirth, along with two other young men, organized a small religious community intended for manual laborers. It soon fell apart, however. Led from this experience, though, in 1862 Wirth sought and received permission from the Bishop of the Diocese of Trier to establish a religious community. This foundation took place on 12 June of that same year, in the Chapel of the Holy Cross in Hausen, when, with some other young men, he professed religious vows, and he took the name Brother James (). The young community of Brothers immediately embarked on a program of caring for the poor and the sick of the region. Brother James led the community as its first Superior General, but also shared in the caring of the needy. As a result, he died only nine years after the foundation of his community, on 28 March 1871, at the age of forty. He died from smallpox, which he contracted from a patient with this disease whom he had been nursing. His remains were later placed in the Chapel of St. Joseph at the Motherhouse in Hausen.Franciscan Brothers of the Holy Cross \\"Our Founder\\" Expansion In Germany, the Brothers continued in the field of nursing and care of the needy of that same diocese. In 1891, three Brothers settled in Bad Kreuznach, where they eventually took over a local hospital, now known as St. Marienwörth.

In 1928, however, Bishop James Aloysius Griffin of the Diocese of Springfield, Illinois, invited the Brothers to establish a community there. They built St. James Monastery and, with the help of ten Brothers from Germany, opened a trade school for young men, which school was in operation from 1930 to 1972.

It has been listed on the District of Columbia Inventory of Historic Sites and on the National Register of Historic Places since 2008. History The school was named after Robert Gould Shaw, who led the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, one of the first official African American units during the American Civil War. From 1902 until 1928 the building housed the William McKinley Manual Training School. It was a school for white students and opened the same time as Armstrong Manual Training School for African Americans. They were part of an educational trend that began in the late 19th century of developing schools that taught industrial education along with the more traditional academic curriculum that prepared students for college. When McKinley moved to a larger campus in 1928 the building became Robert Gould Shaw Junior High School, which had previously opened for black students on M Street in 1921. The new Shaw was also a blacks-only school until segregation ended, but it remained primarily African-American. The school became overcrowded and poorly maintained. As it started to deteriorate the building was referred to as “Shameful Shaw.” It was illustrative of the city's neglect of African Americans. In 1977, Shaw was moved to a new school at 9th Street and Rhode Island Avenue NW. In 2008, Shaw again moved, this time to the Garnet-Patterson school building at 10th and V Streets NW, where it became known as Shaw Middle School at Garnet-Patterson. In 2013, Shaw at Garnet-Patterson closed due to low enrollment following the murder of its principal, Brian Betts. Shaw had a prolific music program with its band marching in the Macy's parade, the Rose Bowl and the Gimbel's parade in Philadelphia, PA. The band was directed by Mr. Lloyd Hoover. The old Shaw Junior High building now houses apartments. Name of Shaw neighborhood Map of the Shaw School Urban Renewal Area from which the concept of a Shaw neighborhood was derived. Includes the U Street and Logan Circle areas Until the 1960s, what is now Shaw was called Midcity. In 1966, planners used the enrollment boundary of Shaw Junior High School to define the Shaw School Urban Renewal Area – which created a concept of a \\"Shaw neighborhood\\" larger than what is generally considered Shaw today, covering today's core Shaw neighborhood, the U Street Corridor, Logan Circle and Truxton Circle. Architecture The building was designed by architect Henry Ives Cobb. It is part of the city's effort to hire private architects to improve the designs of public schools. The exterior is composed of buff- colored brick and limestone trim. It features an arcade of Romanesque arches on the third floor.

The weekly publication was delivered to the shops and houses by Ethbert (Bert) Banyer's son, Brian Banyer. A copy was taken to file at the Liverpool City Council in a folder especially provided as a record of Liverpool's history during those years. Other newspapers also published around this time were The Liverpool Times, The Liverpool Mercury and The Liverpool Herald.  History  According to a 1930 copy of the Liverpool News, which no longer exists, the newspaper stated that it was in its \\"25th Year of Publication\\". The Liverpool News (1993) by Bruce Banyer However, based on the edition dated 15 April 1937, the newspaper was established in 1904 and ended in about 1973, the exact ending year remains unknown. The Liverpool News remained a Banyer family business until about 1937 when it was purchased by The Biz newspaper of Fairfield, owned by the Bright Family. It was eventually absorbed by Cumberland Press, and soon disappeared from circulation.  Early proprietors  In about 1912, Mr. Brown-Parker purchased the newspaper from the previous owner who remains unknown as there is no record of the previous or the original owner of the newspaper. Alf James then took over The Liverpool News from Brown-Parker. The business was conducted in a building in the grounds of what was later Queen's College in Speed Street, roughly at the near of the Uniting Church, the front of which is in Pirie Street. It is not known when Alf James took over the business. It was not known when Alf James took over the business from Mr. Brown-Parker. In 1919, ownership of the newspaper was transferred to Benjamin Robinson Banyer who came from South Australia. When Benjamin Robinson Banyer took over the ownership of the newspaper, the printing works was moved to the two-storied premises then existing between Christiansen's Hardware and Building Supplies, and the Commercial Bank of Sydney on the Corner of Scott Street and Macquarie Street. The site is now 242 Macquarie Street, and when last seen in 1982 was Lowes Men's Wear. Map of the machine room layout  Printing setup  The newspaper was set up and printed in the shed behind a house. It also had the only photographic studio and film developing service in Liverpool. The printing works were located at the back right hand corner of the yard, with the photographic studio behind it. The photographic studio had a stage where Benjamin Robinson Banyer's daughters Joan and Shirley would give concerts occasionally and also had two trapezes set up. Access to the works was by a pathway on the right hand side (Commercial Bank side) of the house, or vehicle access through a vacant block on the left hand side of the house. This block later had the Monte Carlo Café built on it, run by Con Vallis and Jim Johnson. The printing machinery consisted of two Platen type presses, used for small printing jobs such as advertising, brochures, public notice, hand-outs etc. The weekly newspaper was printed on a flat bed press, manufactured by Preston Engineering Co. Originally driven from a pulley on a shaft (which drove all the presses), it was later driven by a 2 HP three-phase electric motor. A lot of experimenting was necessary to get the correct pulley size for the motor, as the range of standard size flat pulleys was limited. One size was too small, the next size too large to drive the press at the correct speed. The problem was overcome by using the smaller size pulley and winding some thin rope around it to build it up to the correct size.  Financial aspects  Ethbert Banyer came to Liverpool in 1920 to help his father run The Liverpool News. Benjamin Robinson Banyer employed two casual men as well as Bert who was employed full-time. They had their regular wages each week, while his father and mother would have what was left over after expenses were taken out. Some shopkeepers could not pay their accounts for advertising in the newspaper so Benjamin and his daughter Joan would go to the advertising shopkeepers on a Friday evening (e.g. grocer, butcher, etc.) and get groceries (or other goods as the case may be) in exchange for what was owed. Some of these accounts would be up around 100 pounds (200 dollars), and the Barter system seemed to work to everyone's satisfaction (up to a point); the shops had to advertise and they had to eat. Many smaller customers had to have red lines drawn through their account in the book if they were having a hard time. The debt would then be written off, as sometimes there was no hope of recovering these payments during the Depression days. An ad in the newspaper for the movie When's Your Birthday? starring Joe E.

Benjamin Robinson Banyer would bribe his unwilling daughter Joan with a bag of lollies to accompany him to all the local churches to obtain the sermons. Joan would sit quietly at the back row with her lollies while he wrote down the sermons. Banyer would also attend all of the numerous balls held such as the Ambulance Ball and the Mayoral Ball and publish a full report on who attended, highlights of the night and what the women wore. This was in addition to all the Council meetings that had to be reported in full. Hi wife had her own column from about 1929 to 1935 under the nom de plume of \\"Arrow\\". The column was called \\"Flights and Darts\\" that provided coverage of local and overseas current affairs topics. His son Bert had a regular sports column that included coverage of cricket and tennis news. He would also included reports of the Liverpool Amateur Fishing Club meetings where he was made a Secretary on 9 July 1935 during an inaugural meeting.  Contests  The Liverpool News sponsored one of the earliest retail trade slogan contests in an effort to arrest the drift of shoppers to the rival centre of Parramatta. It was won by Mr. Harold Havelock Chamman with the slogan \\"Liverpool Trade Means Liverpool Made\\".

Biography  Yakov Lyubarskiy was born in Kiev, but after his birth, the family moved to Leningrad. His father, composer and conductor, worked as a music director for 30 years at the Leningrad Bolshoi Drama Theater; his mother was a music teacher. During WW2, Yakov Lyubarsky was evacuated from besieged Leningrad and returned to the city only at the end of the war to continue high school, which he finished with honors. In 1946, his fascination with Classical Studies brought him to the Classical Department of Leningrad State University, where among his teachers were such renowned scholars as I.I. Tolstoy, I.M. Tronskiy, O.M. Freudenberg, S.YA. Lurie, YA.M. Borovskiy. Lyubarsky graduated cum laude in 1951 with a double degree in Classical Philology and German Philology. Recommended by the faculty to the postgraduate program (aspirantura), he however was not accepted due to his Jewish descent and for several years, worked as a German teacher at an evening school for adults. In 1955 after completing her postgraduate studies, Lyubarsky's wife, also a literary scholar was “distributed” by the Soviet government to Velikie Luki to teach at the department of Russian and Foreign Literature of the local Pedagogical Institute. Yakov was offered a position at the same department. In the ten years that followed, he taught courses in classical and medieval literature, introduction into the history of literature, and the theory of literature and folklore. However, he never abandoned his main interest, classical studies, gradually transitioning in his research from classical antiquity to the later period in the Greek history - Byzantium. It was Alexander Kazhdan, an acclaimed Byzantine scholar and a colleague of Lyubarsky at the Pedagogical Institute in Velikie Luki, who influenced Lyubarsky's decision to change the emphasis of his studies. Kazhdan became his friend and mentor, and Byzantine studies – his livelong passion and the main subject of his research. In 1964, Yakov Lyubarsky received a Candidate of Historical Sciences degree from the Moscow Pedagogical Institute with a dissertation “Alexiad by Anna Comnena as a Historical Source”, A. P. Kazhdan being his research advisor. In 1965, Yakov Lyubarsky wins a contest to become a docent (Associate Professor) at the department of foreign languages of a Naval College in Leningrad. Later, he was appointed a head of the department of foreign languages at the Leningrad Agricultural Institute. He would hold this position for 20 years, while continuing his research and scholarship in the field of Byzantinology. In 1977, with a thesis “Michael Psellos, Personality and Writings” Lyubarsky received a doctorate from the Leningrad State University. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Yakov Lyubarsky was regularly invited to lecture on Byzantium at the Leningrad University. However, his permanent appointment as a professor within the department of Modern Greek Philology of the Leningrad University became possible only in the 1990s, with the changes in the Russian political climate. With this career change, he was finally able to devote himself entirely to Byzantinology. Profound knowledge and love for the subjects he taught, wide experience as an educator, and Lyubarsky's casual and humorous manner (“non-puffed-up”, as he himself described it) won respect and appreciation among many of his students. In the meantime, while his worldwide fame as a scholar continues to grow, he travels to international conferences of Byzantine Studies and lectures at the universities of Bulgaria, Italy, Greece, Crete and Cyprus, England, Spain, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and Australia. He is also offered an opportunity to do research in Paris, Münster, and Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collection. Lyubarsky died on November 30, 2003 and was buried near St. Petersburg in the Komarovo cemetery, where Anna Akhmatova, Dmitry Likhachov, and many other prominent figures in Russian science and culture were buried.  Scientific Activity  Lyubarsky's first publication in the area of Byzantinology, an article about a Cretan poet Stephanos Sahlikis, Vizantiiskii Vremennik. 1959. XVI. p. 65-81. appeared in 1959. It was followed a year later by a translation published in Greece that brought his first international recognition. Magazine “Cretan Chronicles”. Crete. 1960. 14. His translation of the Alexiad by Anna Comnena was published in 1965. Anna Comnena (Komnene). [Alexiad. Russian.] Aleksiada. Vstup. stat’´i\`a, perevod kommentarii. By ´I\`A. N. L´i\`ubarskii. Moscow: Nauka, Glav. red. vostochnoi lit-ry, 1965. It was the first complete Russian edition of the historical account written by the Byzantine princess about the reign of her father, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos of Byzantium (1081–1118). Lyubarsky's version became canonical in the Russian context and was later reprinted twice. Aleksiada. 2nd edition. St. Petersburg. Aleteya. 1996; 3rd edition. Aleteya, 2010. In an introduction to the first edition, Lyubarsky emphasized historical value of Alexiad, while the second edition was amended to include also his analysis of the literary structure of the book. After Alexiad, Lyubarsky turned to Michael Psellos, a famous Byzantine philosopher, chronographer, and imperial advisor. Years of research of the philosopher's writings resulted, besides Lyubarsky's doctoral thesis, in a number of publications. These included a commented translation of Psellos’ Chronographia, Michail Psell (Psellos). [Chronographia. Russian] Khronografia. Perevod, stat’´i\`a, primechani´i\`a. Moscow: Nauka, 1978; 2nd edition. St. Petersburg. Aleteya. 2003. a monograph “Michael Psellos. Personality and Writings. On the History of pre-Humanism in Byzantium”, Michail Psell. Lichnost’ i tvorchestvo. K istorii vizantiiskogo predgumanizma. Moscow. Nauka. 1978. and over a dozen of essays analyzing different aspects of Psellos’ works. O zhanrovoi i kompozitsionnoi spetsifike “Khronografii” Mikhail Psella. Vizantiiskii Vremennik. 1971. 31. p. 23-37. A series of these essays discuss relationships between the philosopher and his contemporaries, thus offering us a view into spiritual, ethical, and everyday life of the Byzantine society in the 11th century. Михаил Пселл в отношениях с современниками. Опыт характеристики личности //\\"Византийский временник\\", 1976, 37, с.98-113; и др. In contrast to existing stereotypes, Yakov Lyubarsky rediscovers Pselloes’ worth and significance, and emphasizes previously overlooked artistic value of his work. The comprehensive approach to the writings of Psellos allowed Lyubarsky to position the author within the context of not only Byzantine, but also medieval European literature. In his subsequent articles, Lyubarsky goes further in developing his ideas about evolution and specifics of Byzantine historiography (see, for example, his articles \\"Man in Byzantine Historiography from John Malala to Michail Psellos\\";Dumbarton Oaks Papers, 1992, 46, p.177-180 \\"Noue Tendenzen in der Erforschung der byzantinischen Historiographie\\" \\"Klio\\", Berlin, 1987, 69/2, s. 560-566). This new approach is refined in Lyubarsky's third book “The Continuatio Theophanis”, in which the translation of the manuscript is accompanied by an article “Writings by the Continuatio Theophanis. Chronicle, History, Biographies.” \\"Продолжатель Феофана\\". Жизнеописания византийских царей\\" Перевод, статья, комментарии. СПб, \\"Наука\\" 1992. 2-е издание - исправленное, СПб, \\"Алетейя\\", 2009 As such, Lyubarsky establishes a new concept in Byzantine studies that allows to consider the Byzantine historiography a literary phenomenon rather than just a collection of historic data. This leads to a possibility of applying certain methods of contemporary literary analysis to Byzantine literature. These ideas of Yakov Lyubarsky caused debates among scholars all over the world. One of these, initiated by Lyubarsky, was a discussion about narrative structures facilitated by Symbolae Osloenses, a Norwegian Journal of Greek and Latin Studies.“Quellenforschung and/or Literary Criticism: Narrative Structures in Byzantine Historical Writings,” Symbolae Osloenses, Oslo, 73, 1998, 29-33. Lyubarsky's fourth book “Byzantine Historians and Writers” (1999) is a collection of his own essays published in Russia and abroad along with a bibliography of his works. \\"Византийские историки и писатели\\" СПб, изд-во \\"Алетейя\\", 1999. The second edition of this book includes works that were not published previously or were published after his death, and a complete bibliography with over 170 titles. The significance of Lyubarsky's works cannot be overstated. His highly regarded translations made previously unknown texts accessible to a Russian reader. His research offered a new perspective in the studies of Byzantine literature and a new direction in its interpretation, thus allowing to have a broader and less biased view of Byzantium.

He was held in high regard by Queen Elizabeth, although his enemies accused him of corruption and maladministration. He was the father of James Dillon, 1st Earl of Roscommon. His tomb, which has the curious local name \\"the jealous man and woman\\", can still be seen at Newton Abbey near Trim. Birth and origins Robert was born on 1 January 1530 at Newtown, near Trim, County Meath, eldest son of Sir Robert Dillon (died 1580) and Genet (also called Elizabeth) Barnewall. His father was Sir Robert Dillon of Newtown, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. Lucas's mother was a younger daughter of Edward Barnewall of Crickstown. His parents had four sons and three daughters. He heads the list of his brothers below as the eldest: #Lucas (1530–1592); #Roger, married Margaret, daughter of Richard Missett of Ballydromney; #Thomas, married first the daughter of Walter Peppard, and secondly Margaret, daughter of Cushen and by her had Robert who married Margaret, eldest daughter of Theobald Dillon, 1st Viscount Dillon; and #John, a priest according to some, but founded families according to others. Nothing seems to be known about his sisters. Career He entered Middle Temple in 1561, was called to the Bar, and then returned to Ireland to practice law. His rise in the legal profession was rapid: he became Principal Solicitor for Ireland in 1565 and Attorney General in the following year. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as MP for Meath in the Parliament of 1568-71. He bought an estate at Moymet, near Trim, County Meath, where he built Moymet Castle, now a ruin. Elevation to the Bench In 1570 he succeeded his father-in-law James Bathe as Chief Baron, rather against the wishes of the Irish ruling class, most of whom would have preferred the second Baron of the Exchequer, Robert Cusack The final decision rested with Queen Elizabeth, who wrote that while she heard very good reports of Cusack, Dillon had the stronger claim. Cusack's supporters praised him as \\"a true Protestant\\", whereas Dillon was known to incline privately to the Roman Catholic faith. However the English Crown, while it made intermittent efforts to appoint judges of strongly Protestant views, would as a rule accept outward adherence to the Church of Ireland as sufficient evidence of loyalty, and Dillon's private religious opinions, which were shared by several of his colleagues, were thus not a bar to advancement. Judicial career Until his last years, Dillon was held in high regard by the English Crown. Sir William Gerard, the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, described him as an energetic reformer, who was diligent in attending the Privy Council and the Court of Castle Chamber (the Irish equivalent of Star Chamber). He was said to be one of the few judges of real eminence in Ireland, at a time when the calibre of most of his colleagues was compared unfavourably to that of a junior English barrister.Crawford, p.98 He was particularly close to Sir Henry Sidney, the Lord Deputy of Ireland, who called him \\"my faithful Dillon\\", and knighted him.Ball, p.212 He was one of Sidney's few influential supporters during the so-called \\"cess controversy\\", the much resented attempt to impose a tax for the upkeep of military garrisons on the gentry of the Pale. He played a considerable part in putting down the Desmond Rebellions and the rebellion of William Nugent. Sidney did however express concerns about Lucas's increasing ill--health, which he feared might make him incapable of performing his duties as a judge.Ball p.143. Nicholas Nugent Lucas's reputation suffered greatly through his involvement, together with his cousin Robert Dillon as judges in the trial of Nicholas Nugent for treason in 1582. Nicholas was accused of treason in the contest of the rebellion of his nephew William Nugent. There had been a long and bitter feud between the Nugent and Dillon families. Nicholas had recently been appointed Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and Lucas's cousin reportedly hoped to take Nugent's place. The trial of a senior judge on a treason charge was without precedent in England or Ireland. Both Dillons should have been disqualified from sitting as judges at his trial as one of the charges was that Nugent had plotted to kill them.Ball, p.147 The trial ended with the conviction and execution of Nugent, which caused grave public disquiet, (although he did at least have the benefit of trial by jury), and led to a claim that Irish born judges were incapable of administering impartial justice. Later years Dillon was by now acquiring enemies, but he also had friends, including the new Lord Deputy, Sir John Perrot. He was spoken of as a likely Lord Chancellor of Ireland, although his critics said that he was too corrupt to be suitable for the post. Elizabeth herself thought highly of him and at one point was said to have offered him the office of Lord Chief Justice of Ireland.Ball, p.212 If the offer was made, it seems that his enemies had enough influence to block it. As some consolation for his failure to attain higher office he was made Seneschal of West Kilkenny. As Perrot's Deputyship became increasingly embattled, Dillon, his ally, was also attacked: Adam Loftus, Archbishop of Dublin accused him of recusancy, a very serious charge to make against a servant of the Crown, and informed the London government that he was \\"very corrupt\\".Crawford p.110 William Nugent, who had received a royal pardon for his rebellion against the Crown, made a concerted attack on Sir Robert Dillon, who was by now Lord Chief Justice, and for a time had him suspended from office. Lucas was also attacked, and the stress of defending himself against charges of corruption is said to have hastened his death, although he was in any case an old man by the standards of the time, and had been in ill health for some years.Ball p.142 Death and burial – \\"the tomb of the jealous man and woman\\" He died in Dublin, and was buried beside his first wife Jane at Newtown Abbey, near Trim.Ball, p.212 Their tomb, which still exists, has the interesting nickname \\"the tomb of the jealous man and woman\\", although the origin of the nickname is unclear. One suggestion is that it originates from the fact that the effigies of Lucas and Jane are separated by a sword of state, which may suggest that there had been an estrangement between the couple.Hoare, R.C. Journal of a Tour in Ireland A.D. 1806 Dublin 1807 p.269 \\"The tomb of the jealous man and woman\\"- effigies of Sir Lucas Dillon and his first wife Jane Bathe, Newtown Abbey, Trim, County Meath Family Dillon married firstly Jane Bathe, daughter of his predecessor as Chief Baron, James Bathe, and his second wife Elizabeth Burnell. Lucas and Jane had twelve children, seven sons: #James (c. 1570 – 1641), became the 1st Earl of Roscommon in 1622; #Henry (d. 1609) of Kentstown in Meath; #Christopher; #Oliver; #Alexander; #John, either died childless or married a daughter of Sir William Sarsfield of Lucan; #Robert; —and five daughters: #Genet, married Christopher Plunkett, the 9th Lord Killeeen and was the mother of Luke Plunket, 1st Earl of Fingall, Nicholas Plunkett, Patrick Plunkett, Bishop of Ardagh, Genet, who married Richard Nugent, 1st Earl of Westmeath, and Mary, who married firstly James O'Ferrall and secondly Sir Richard Browne, Lord Mayor of Dublin; #Eleanor, married Robert Rochfort of Kilbride, ancestor of the prominent Rochfort family; #Elizabeth; #Margaret, married John Sarsfield of Shurninges; and #Anne, married Richard Plunket of Rathmore. Lucas married secondly in 1578 Marion Sherle (or Shurle), daughter of Patrick Sherle of Shallon, County Meath and widow of Sir Christopher Barnewall of Turvey; Eleanor (or Helen), one of her many daughters by her first marriage, married her stepfather's son James Dillon.Ball, p.212 His widow died in 1607 and was buried beside her first husband in Lusk church. Reputation Lucas Dillon's record as a judge and as a statesman has received a somewhat mixed verdict from historians. Elrington Ball points to the charges of corruption made against him and his improper conduct of the Nugent trial.Ball, p.147 Crawford on the other hand praises his talent and energy, points to the high regard most Crown officials had for him, and argues that the charges of corruption made against him were partisan in nature.Crawford, pp. 109–110 It is significant that Queen Elizabeth, who was noted for her skill in choosing good public servants, thought highly of him.

He was Fullerian Professor of Physiology and Comparative Anatomy from 1872 to 1875. Life Rutherford was born at Ancrum Craig Farm near Ancrum in Roxburghshire, the son of Thomas Rutherford, a farmer. He was educated at Jedburgh Grammar School then studied medicine at Edinburgh University, gaining his doctorate (MD) in 1863. After studying in Berlin, Vienna, and Paris, he became assistant to John Hughes Bennett, professor of physiology at Edinburgh. After the Edinburgh anatomist John Goodsir told Rutherford about the new experimental physiology in Germany, William Rutherford and the ophthalmologist Douglas Argyll Robertson at Edinburgh became the first in the United Kingdom to introduce the new experimental apparatus of Hermann von Helmholtz, Emil du Bois-Reymond and Carl Ludwig.. In 1869 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, his proposer being John Hughes Bennett. In 1869 Rutherford became assistant professor of physiology at King's College, London. In 1871 he was appointed professor of physiology at the Royal Institution. In 1874 he returned to Edinburgh University to succeed Bennett as professor of physiology there. Rutherford lectured at the University of Edinburgh when Arthur Conan Doyle studied medicine there. Like his fictional character Sherlock Holmes, who was based on a real person, Conan Doyle's Professor Challenger was based in part on Rutherford. From 1881 his laboratory assistant was Sutherland Simpson. He died 21 February 1899 at 14 Douglas CrescentEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1899, Edinburgh. He was not married and had no children, so he was buried with his parents in Ancrum parish churchyard. His chair at the university was filled by Prof Edward Albert Sharpey- Schafer.http://frontiersmagazine.org/sutherland-simpson-from-saraquoy-to- cornell/ Works * On the morbid appearances met with in the brains of thirty insane persons, 1869 * Influence of the vagus upon the vascular system, 1869 * Introductory lecture to the course of physiology in Kings College, London, 1869, 1869 * An introduction to the study of medicine : a lecture delivered at the opening of the medical session of 1871–72, in King's College, London, 1871 * The present aspects of physiology; an introductory lecture, 1874 * Outlines of practical histology : being the notes of the Histological Section of the Class of Practical Physiology held in the University of Edinburgh, 1875 * The sense of hearing: a lecture, 1886 * Syllabus of lectures on physiology, 1887 * A General account of histological methods, 1887 * On the conditions that influence the attainment of the physiological ideal : introductory lecture, 14 October 1890, 1890 * The tercentenary of the compound microscope; an inaugural address delivered 7 November 1890, to the Scottish Microscopical Society, 1891 * On the method of studying a natural science such as physiology : an introductory lecture, delivered 9 October 1894, 1894 Notes References * External links * Notes and Laboratory records of Professor William Rutherford (1839–1899), and Notes from Lectures given by Rutherford and taken down by others, held at the Edinburgh University Library, Special Collections Division * 1839 births 1899 deaths 19th-century Scottish medical doctors People from the Scottish Borders Scottish physiologists Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Academics of the University of Edinburgh Academics of King's College London Fullerian Professors of Physiology Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh Fellows of the Royal Society Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh ","title":"William Rutherford (physiologist)"},{"id":"34071469","text":"The Tenth Precinct Station House is an historic structure located in the Park View neighborhood of Washington, D.C.

It is located in the Safita district of the Tartus Governorate in Syria in the north of the Akkar plain on the north of the al-Abrash river approximately south of Tartus.Badre, Leila., Tell Kazel-Simyra: A Contribution to a Relative Chronological History in the Eastern Mediterranean during the Late Bronze Age, American University of Beirut, Lebanon, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, 2006. Links to ancient Sumur The tell was first surveyed in 1956 after which a lengthy discussion was opened by Maurice Dunand and Nassib Saliby identifying the site with the ancient city variously named Sumur, Simyra or Zemar (Egypt. Smr Akkad. Sumuru or Assyrian Simirra). The ancient city is mentioned in the Bible, Book of Genesis () and 1 Chronicles () as the home of the Zemarites, an offshoot of the Caananites. It was a major trade center and appears in the Amarna letters; Ahribta is named as its ruler. It was under the guardianship of Rib-Hadda, king of Byblos, but revolted against him and joined Abdi-Ashirta's expanding kingdom of Amurru. Pro-Egyptian factions may have seized the city again but Abdi-Ashirta's son Aziru recaptured the city. Excavations The tell was first excavated between 1960 and 1962 by Maurice Dunand, Nassib Saliby and Adnān Bounni who determined a sequence between the Middle Bronze Age through to the Hellenistic civilization. The most important occupations were determined to have taken place during the Late Bronze Age and Persian Empire. In 1985, new excavations began in partnership between the Archaeological Museum of the American University of Beirut and the Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums in Syria under the directorship of Leila Badre. A large amount of imported pottery from Cyprus, known as Cypriot bichrome ware, was found dating between the 14th and 12th centuries BC and contrasting to other sites in the Homs gap. The city was destroyed during the Late Bronze Age, after which local Mycenaean ceramics, Handmade burnished ware and Grey ware replaced the imported pottery. Architectural remains at the site include a palace complex and temple that were dated towards the end of the Late Bronze Age. The temple contained a variety of amulets, seals and glazed ware that showed similarities with the culture of Ugarit. A later Iron Age settlement was detected between the 9th and 8th centuries BC which was brought to an end with evidence of burnt destruction caused by a currently unidentified Assyrian invasion. A warehouse and defensive installation made out of ashlar blocks were found dating to the Persian period with further evidence of Hellenistic occupation evidenced by a large cemetery in the northeast of the site.

They represent a 'fast read' for those with busy lifestyles, and tend to be rack-selected take- ones.\\" The first commuter newspapers included Vancouver's The Georgia Straight, the Montreal Mirror, and New York City's The Village Voice. In keeping with the newspaper's intention to provide brief and direct accounts of the day's news, the paper's writing is more simplistic, intended to give readers the facts and news they desire succinctly. Accordingly, there are fewer sections in Metro than a traditional paper, and each section is much thinner. Instead of relying on subscriptions these papers are usually supported by advertising revenue.  History  Metro International was founded in Sweden in 1995. The idea behind the commuter paper was \\"news for free, at the right place and the right time. A free daily newspaper distributed in high-traffic commuter zones and public transport networks.\\" In 1997, Metro introduced a Prague edition of the paper two years later, and by 2008 published 58 editions in 19 countries and 15 languages, and was based in Stockholm. Ottawa's RushHour, for instance, was introduced in 2006 and is available at 120 distribution points throughout the Canadian city, at points where commuters board public transit vehicles for the daily trip home. Metro is likewise available within subways stations and bus terminals as well as at secondary distribution points such as grocery stores, coffee shops and business towers, as well as in boxes on the street.http://www.metromediakit.ca/page.do?pid=44&sid;=1&parent;=44 Although the idea of free distribution has been used for decades (such as Vancouver's The Georgia Straight, Montreal Mirror and New York City's The Village Voice) it was started by newsagents in the nineteenth century. “Metro is the new face of old media”, the paper's site accordingly claims a reader to have tweeted. While the commuter paper clearly does revert to some old-fashioned practices, it also incorporates the very modern devices of cell phones and iPads with apps tailored to each medium. Metro's first Canadian offshoot was launched in Toronto, Canada in 2000 and since the brand has opened branches in Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, Vancouver, Halifax, London and Winnipeg, Canada.  Audience  Commuter Newspapers and “Take-Ones” appeal to a more youthful population than mainstream newspapers. They are intended to be skimmed, not to be thoroughly absorbed and appreciated as a work of journalism. These papers are arguably less about the artistic or journalistic quality of the paper and rely on facts. They have fewer frills and fewer opinions than the traditional newspaper. 39% of Metro's print audience is between the ages of 18 and 34, 80% of its readers are either employed or students and 76% live in the city. Metro is, as most newspaper and magazine publications now are, available interactively, online and through wireless devices. Of Metro's interactive users, 49% are between the ages of 18 and 34, 79% are employed or students and 59% live in and around the city of Toronto. In keeping with this audience, presumably to appeal to youthful readers, Metro had pop mega-star Lady Gaga as guest editor on May 17, 2011, the week Gaga's album Born This Way was released. This special edition of the paper seemed to function as a way for Metro to increase its readership among its young, pop-culture-conscious readers while simultaneously providing a fruitful promotion opportunity for Lady Gaga. In Canada alone, Metro reaches approximately 1.4 million readers through its print editions on a daily basis. and claims to have 741, 365 unique visitors to its website monthly, as well as upwards of 2.3 million page views. For some theorists, the rise of the commuter paper was a democratizing force, bringing news to a larger, and more broad audience.  Metro  Metro is the leading free national daily newspaper brand in Canada, and the first national daily to be published in both official languages. Metro's target audience is what it calls YAMs (youthful, active, metropolitans). To reach this audience the paper employs traditional newsprint, as well as online and mobile formats and finally through apps for BlackBerry, iPhone, and Android phones, and most recently the tablet. Metro brings relevant daily updates and unique global inspiration at the right time and in the right format to enhance the YAMs' quality of life. Metro has a unique global reach - attracting a young, active, well-educated, metropolitan audience of over 24.8 million daily readers and more than 37 million weekly readers. Through its print editions alone, Metro reaches more than 1.4 million readers daily and 3 million readers over the course of a week through our print editions. Guinness Book of World Records has named Metro the world's largest global newspaper and it is also the fastest-growing one, Metro is published in over 55 editions in 24 countries and over 200 major cities worldwide including Prague, Florence, Paris and Amsterdam. Metro claims to have 50/50 male to female readership, something a paper such as The Globe and Mail has struggled with for years, eventually introducing a \\"Lifestyle\\" section to address this very problem. Like other traditional papers that have struggled, The Halifax Daily News, known for tackling issues such as racism, patronage and city planning, was shut down on February 11, 2008 by owner Transcontinental Media, who launched a local edition of the free Metro to replace it.  Commuter newspaper versus the traditional newspaper  Unlike more traditional papers, which rely on subscriptions to make a profit, these papers are usually supported by advertising revenue. Since its launch, Metro has provided a unique opportunity for advertisers “to influence a very hard-to-reach audience – young, active, well-educated, urban, professionals”. Metro offers advertisers numerous innovative creative formats and solutions, sampling and alternative distribution opportunities. Some of Canada's largest and most successful newspapers, The Globe and Mail and The Toronto Star have also recently made their papers smaller, if only centimeters shorter when unfolded and held open. For the commuter paper, its size is reduced more so in terms of the thickness of the paper itself, due to its thinner sections. This is another element of the paper that makes it easy to travel with on the daily commute. A copy of Metro can be folded up and slid into one's briefcase, or left sitting on the seat in the subway. Companies and/or individuals can come to have great influence over a publication due to the money they contribute to getting the paper printed. The interest of take-ones, if they wish to keep running, can easily become about their advertisers' interests rather than their own journalistic ones. Since commuter newspapers are ad-revenue based, it is possible that it would be susceptible to corporate bias or bias from advertisers trying to slip their products into the paper's stories. This, in theory, could lead to a less consistent, and ultimately a less trustworthy paper, however this concern is not unique to the take-one format. Though other Canadian newspapers such as the National Post or the Toronto Star often do include many advertisements, the line between the commuter newspapers that are supported chiefly by advertising revenue, and regular newspapers which are not, becomes more and more blurred as newspaper readership and subscription continues to decline and even traditional newspapers need to rely more heavily on advertisers. It is also important to remember that these standard-format newspapers are part of large media conglomerates which may also be serving their own interests, for instance advertising for other companies or products associated with the brand. One benefit of the commuter paper is that, in an age increasingly concerned with environmentalism, the commuter newspaper theoretically cuts back on the amount of paper printed: fewer papers can be produced, since one paper will reach the hands of more than one reader. The newspaper itself also requires less paper due to its condensed size.

Chaba was the Japan's second costliest storm during the season, only behind Songda in September, and peaked as a typhoon with maximum sustained winds equivalent to that of a Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Chaba originated from a gradually developing area of disturbed weather on August 18, northeast of Kwajalein. Tracking westward, the system gained tropical storm strength the following day and then reached typhoon intensity on August 20\\\\. Rapid intensification ensued thereafter, with Chaba quickly attaining its peak intensity on August 23 as it began to curve towards the northeast. This intensity was maintained for several hours before the typhoon began to fluctuate in strength as it began to meander south of Japan beginning on August 26\\\\. Three days later, Chaba made landfall on Kyushu, later tracking across the Sea of Japan as it concurrently weakened. On August 31, the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, and later dissipated in the Sea of Okhotsk on September 5\\\\. The typhoon caused significant damage to areas of the Northern Mariana Islands, which were buffeted by strong typhoon-force winds. Rota was worst affected by Chaba, as the island remained under the storm's eyewall for several hours. Gusts peaked at 219 km/h (136 mph) at Rota International Airport, and the strong winds damaged and destroyed a multitude of homes. Power outages were frequent across the commonwealth, and beach erosion resulted from strong storm surge. Damage in the Northern Mariana Islands amounted to US$18 million, and 13 people were injured, with one fatality. Another fatality occurred in Guam under similar circumstances, though the island sustained less damage. Following the storm, a state of emergency was declared in Guam and areas of the Northern Mariana Islands were declared federal disaster areas. Most of the damage caused by Chaba occurred in Japan, where 18 people were killed and damage figures reached JP¥105.4 billion (US$959 million). The typhoon remains the country's fourteenth costliest on record. A total of 8,627 homes were destroyed by the storm's effects, with another 46,561 inundated by floodwater. Impacts in Japan were primarily concentrated on Kyushu, where Chaba made its first landfall. Rainfall peaked at 821 mm (32.32 in) in Miyazaki Prefecture. Like in the Northern Mariana Islands, power outages and transportation delays were of numerous extent in Japan. Meteorological history Typhoon Chaba stemmed from an area of disturbed weather that quickly developed northeast of Kwajalein on August 18\\\\. Within an area of favorable atmospheric conditions, the system became sufficiently organized to be classified as a tropical depression by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) at 0600 UTC that day. Tracking westward under the influence of a nearby ridge, strengthening continued and the storm reached tropical storm intensity at 1200 UTC on August 19. It was at this time that the system was assigned the name Chaba. Strengthening at a climatologically normal pace, Chaba reached severe tropical storm intensity at 0000 UTC on August 20. However, over the day's course, analysis of wind patterns about the cyclone indicated that Chaba's upper-level circulation was decoupled from its surface circulation. Nonetheless, this period of deorganization was limited, and the tropical storm began to quicken in intensification. Early on August 21, microwave imagery showed that Chaba had developed a large cloud-filled eye, signifying additional strengthening. At 1800 UTC on August 20, the JMA upgraded Chaba to typhoon status, while the system was roughly 345 km (215 mi) east-southeast of Saipan. Much of the rapid intensification pattern was attributed to the development of dual outflow channels during the day's course. Concurrently Chaba began to curve towards the northwest around the periphery of the nearby, dominant subtropical ridge in response to an approaching longwave, sweeping past the Mariana Islands. At 1800 UTC on August 23, the JMA assessed the typhoon to have reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 205 km/h (125 mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 910 mbar (hPa; 26.87 inHg). An intense albeit average- sized typhoon, Chaba held this intensity for two days before dry air began to impact the cyclone. On August 26, the typhoon's convection slightly weakened, and the more intense convective activity became limited to the southern and eastern sides of the system. On August 27, the longwave trough that had in part steered Chaba northward moved out of the region, and after slowing down, the typhoon began to assume a westerly course. Chaba initiated an eyewall replacement cycle the next day, further weakening the system. A second longwave trough propelled Chaba towards the north-northeast, bringing it to a landfall near Kushikino, Kagoshima at 0000 UTC on August 30, with sustained winds of 150 km/h (90 mph). Chaba quickly crossed Kyushu and briefly emerged over water before making a second landfall on Hōfu, Yamaguchi. At 1200 UTC on August 30, the JMA downgraded from typhoon status to severe tropical storm status, and six hours later, Chaba entered the Sea of Japan. Racing towards the northeast, the storm made its final landfall as a tropical system near Oshamambe, Hokkaido on August 31 shortly before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. These remnants persisted for several days, tracking across the Sea of Okhotsk and moving towards the coast of Russia. On September 4, the extratropical cyclone became quasi-stationary near Sakhalin before fully dissipating by 1800 UTC the following day. Preparations Northern Mariana Islands and Guam Typhoon Chaba after passing over the Northern Mariana Islands on August 23 On August 22, emergency shelters on Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands were opened in anticipation of Chaba, in response to typhoon warnings which had been issued area wide. The same regions were still recovering from Typhoon Tingting, which had caused considerable damage in June 2004. On the same day that shelters were opened, 442 people were relocated to the seven shelters on Guam. This figure rose to nearly 2,000 after ten schools were transitioned into emergency sheltering. The Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport near Tamuning, Guam was closed as part of the preparatory procedures. The USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63), which had been stationed on Guam since August 19, was forced to depart during the morning hours of August 21 in order to avoid the typhoon. Japan As Chaba was slowly tracking westward on August 28, the JMA projected the storm to make landfall on western or southwestern Japan the next day, and anticipated heavy rainfall across several prefectures. Sixteen ferry routes were cancelled across southwestern Japan, and 244 flights to and from airports in southern Kyushu were cancelled in response to the approaching storm on August 29, affecting about 15,000 passengers. The following day, 739 more domestic flights were cancelled, affecting an additional 60,000 people. Several express rail services were also cancelled. On Kyushu and Shikoku combined, 12,000 people were evacuated. In Onomichi, Hiroshima, 3,500 people were evacuated due to the threat of high waves. Impact and aftermath Northern Mariana Islands and Guam Even before Chaba passed over the Pacific islands, the typhoon generated rough surf. On August 21 on Marpi Point Field in Saipan, a large wave resulted in a fatality and caused another person to become hospitalized. As the typhoon moved through the Northern Mariana Islands, tropical storm conditions were felt in Saipan while typhoon-force winds were felt in Rota and Tinian. Rota was positioned beneath Chaba's eyewall for several hours, resulting in extremely heavy rain and strong winds. The highest recorded wind gust there peaked at 219 km/h (136 mph), and gusts in excess of 160 km/h (100 mph) were documented for ten consecutive hours. Total rainfall measurements at Rota International Airport reached 528 mm (20.80 in). Extensive damage resulted on Rota, with the complete destruction of 50 homes. An additional 175 homes sustained minor damage. At the coast, the storm surge from Chaba caused coastal inundation up to 3.4 m (11 ft) inland, resulting in beach erosion. The toppling of electrical infrastructure resulted in island-wide power outages. Similar effects occurred on Tinian and Saipan, which also experienced widespread power outages and coastal inundation. Across both islands 270 homes were destroyed and 700 others were at least partially damaged. Telephone services were also cut in Tinian. Overall, 13 people were injured and damage costs totaled to approximately US$18 million in the Northern Mariana Islands. Guam suffered less impacts from Chaba than the Northern Mariana Islands, but was still buffeted by tropical storm-force winds. At Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport, which had remained closed through the duration of the storm, wind gusts peaked at 109 km/h (68 mph). The same airport documented 329 mm (12.95 in) of rain over a three-day period as a result of the typhoon. However the highest wind gust measured in Guam overall was in Apra Harbor, where a station clocked a wind gust at 127 km/h (79 mph). Effects were mostly of minor extent in Guam. Despite moderate coastal inundation, beach erosion was minimal, and the heavy rainfall did not cause significant flooding. The cost of damage in Guam reached US$25,000. Four minor injuries occurred, and no deaths took place as the storm passed near the island. However, on August 25, after Chaba had begun moving away from Guam, four people were swept to sea by strong rip currents caused by the departing typhoon. Though three of the four were later recovered and treated for injuries, the other person was never found. After the storm passed, governor Felix Perez Camacho declared a state of emergency for Guam, allocating US$250,000 in funds towards emergency civil defense, public safety, and health care costs. Several executive offices, including the Guam Office and Defense and Homeland Security, were tasked with assessing damage and assisting in repair operations. Similarly, governor Juan Babauta of the Northern Mariana Islands requested that U.S. president George W. Bush declare the commonwealth a disaster area in order to receive federal disaster assistance. This request for funding was granted six days later. Japan Typhoon Chaba approaching Japan on August 29 Typhoon Chaba was a highly destructive and costly storm for Japan. Across the nation, 18 people were killed, with 285 injuries; of these 45 were severe and 243 were of minor extent. In addition to the fatalities, US$2 billion in damage occurred. The resulting insurance payment for the damage equated to US$1.2 billion. A total of 8,627 homes were destroyed, and 46,581 were at least inundated. The damage cost made Chaba the costliest typhoon to affect Japan in 2004, only to be surpassed by Typhoon Songda the following month. , Chaba remains the fourteenth costliest typhoon in Japanese history. =Kyushu and outlying islands= Strong winds caused by Chaba damaged sugar cane crops in Kitadaitōjima beginning on August 26, resulting in JP¥39.2 million (US$360,000) in damage. Three days later, Chaba passed near the island of Amami Ōshima, producing heavy rains and strong winds. As a result of these effects, power was initially cut to 5,800 households, quickly increasing to near 20,000. Precipitation peaked at 300 mm (11.8 in) on the island, and one hundred homes were flooded. The strong winds blew the roof off of a house and burst windows in several other buildings. One person was injured as a result of flying glass. Similarly another person was injured due to broken glass in Yakushima. Striking the largest part of Kagoshima Prefecture on August 30, the typhoon caused heavy losses to agriculture and infrastructure. Numerous buildings sustained damage, and 1,033 of them were inundated underwater. On August 30, roughly 32,300 homes in Kagoshima were without power, and by the next day, Chaba's impacts resulted in 328,000 homes without electricity. Damage in the prefecture amounted to JP¥5.17 billion (US$47 million), and two people were killed. The highest rainfall totals measured throughout Japan as a result of Chaba occurred in nearby Miyazaki Prefecture. Precipitation in the prefecture peaked at 821 mm (32.32 in) in Ebino. A station in Mikado observed 61 mm (2.40 in) of rain in a one-hour period, greater than any other measurement in Japan over the same time period. In that prefecture, 1,000 homes were left without power. Two people were killed and 27 others were injured. Damage figures in Miyazaki reached JP¥38.8 billion (US$353 million). The Japan Ground Self-Defense Force was dispatched in both Miyazaki and Kagoshima prefectures to rescue impacted persons and search for missing people. In Kumamoto Prefecture, 100 homes were left without power. Roads and transportation routes became blocked due to the rains and numerous landslides. Damage there reached JP¥1.9 billion (US$17.4 million), and though no deaths occurred, there were seven injuries. Storm surge in Fukuoka Prefecture caused damage along the coast, and resulted in some inland flooding. Though being located next to the coast, Nagasaki Prefecture only experienced moderate flooding, with a few buildings becoming inundated by floodwater. Agricultural damage was much more considerable, with 5,645 hectares (13,949 acres) of farmland becoming submerged underwater. Similar effects were felt in Saga Prefecture, where damage amounted to JP¥2.2 billion (US$20.1 million). Ōita Prefecture suffered heavy losses as it was battered by both heavy rains and strong winds, affecting the entirety of the prefecture. Several buildings sustained façade damage. Impacts to rice, vegetable, and fruit production were also reported. Damage accrued in Ōita amounted to JP¥3.4 billion (US$31 million). =Elsewhere in Japan= On August 26, two people, one off of Kōchi Prefecture and the other off of Ehime Prefecture, were both killed after being swept away by waves estimated to have been cresting 3 m (9.9 ft) above mean sea level. These deaths occurred while the typhoon was still well into open sea. Four days later, a Vietnamese freigther, the Vihan 05, ran aground near Cape Yura in Ehime Prefecture. Initially headed for Kure, Hiroshima, four of the ship's twenty crew members were thrown into the sea and went missing prior to the grounding incident. In the prefecture itself, nearly 400 homes were flooded by heavy rainfall. Combined impacts of precipitation, storm surge, and strong winds caused numerous transportation delays and cancellations. A total of 116,453 electrical units failed during the typhoon's passage. Damage totaled JP¥39.6 billion (US$360 million), more than any other prefecture in Japan. On Honshū, 98,014 homes suffered power outages during Chaba.

Within governance, it incorporates the influence of non- state actors, i.e. stakeholders, NGOs and so forth, therefore the state is not the only acting power in policy making. However, in terms of the ocean, this is a complex issue because it is a commons that is not ‘owned’ by any single nation/state. The consequences of this has resulted in humankind abusing the oceans’ resources, by treating them as shared resources, but not taking equal and collective responsibilities in caring for them.Boesch, D.F. (1999) The role of science in ocean governance. Ecological Economics, 31, pp. 189–198. This means that rules on the conduct of the ocean can only be implemented through international agreements.DeSombre, E.R. (2006) Global Environmental Institutions, Abingdon: Routledge. Therefore, there is a need for some form of governance to maintain the ocean for its various uses, preferably in a sustainable manner. Legal framework There are two major international legal organisations that exist that are involved in ocean governance on a global scale. The International Maritime Organization (IMO), which was ratified in 1958 is responsible mainly for maritime safety, liability and compensation and they have held some conventions on marine pollution related to shipping incidents. IMO marine pollution conventions * 1972 – Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (LDC) * 1969 – International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties (INTERVENTION). * 1973 – International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78). * 1990 – International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response, and Cooperation (OPRC). * 2000 – Protocol on Preparedness, Response and Cooperation to Pollution Incidents by Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS Protocol). The IMO sees the regulation of marine pollution as one its most important aspects of governance and in particular, the MARPOL convention is regarded as one of its greatest successes.International Maritime Organization (IMO), http://www.imo.org/About/Pages/Default.aspx [Accessed: 10/12/2011]. The result of MARPOL has meant that oil pollution has decreased due to a change in equipment standards of oil tankers to prevent operational discharge of oil.Mitchell, R.B.

However, the main organisation concerned with the economic, environmental, ethical, peace and security issues is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) It was first established under the Third UNCLOS in 1973 and fully ratified in 1982. The main aim was to adopt a regime of national seas and international waters on a global scale.Birnie, P.W. (1993) The Law of the Sea and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. In: N. Ginsburg, E. Mann Borgese and J. R. Morgan (eds.) Ocean Yearbook, Vol 10, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 13–35. What was agreed was that the jurisdictional boundaries of individual states were to be enlarged to 200 nautical miles off a state’s coastline. Coastal states were given greater rights to control these areas for protective purposes and the exploitation of natural resources.Vallega, A. (2001) Sustainable Ocean Governance: A geographical perspective. London: Routledge. In total 38 million square nautical miles of ocean space was put under jurisdiction under the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and the legalities concerning the continental shelf and territorial sea were altered.Oceans and the Law of the Sea, http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_historical_perspective.htm [Accessed: 12/12/2011]. However, the Convention did not come into full effect despite a number of implementations being carried out between 1973 and 1982. This was profoundly due to a dispute over mineral resources, particularly manganese nodules in the deep-oceans. Developing countries preferred treating these minerals as “common heritage,” that via an international organisation, they could benefit from a sharing of these resources.Krasner, S.D. (1985) Structural Conflict: The Third World Against Global Liberalism, Berkeley: University of California Press. However, the developed world, in particular the United States, was not in favour of this and preferring a first-come, first-served basis, due to self-economic interest. Only in 1994 did the United States renounce their objections so that the Convention could be enacted. =Institutions established by UNCLOS= * International Seabed Authority (ISA) – An independent international institution that came into force in 1994, with the aim of acting as a custodian of ocean commons (the Common Heritage of Mankind).

(2005) Towards an ocean governance framework and national policy for Peru. [online] Available at: [Accessed:12/12/2011]. Participatory Governance in Ocean Governance Despite an obvious need for international bodies to control and manage the resources, it has been argued that for sustainable governance of the ocean to occur, it needs to be participatory.Costanza, R. (1999) The ecological, economic and social importance of the oceans. Ecological Economics, 31, pp. 199–213. The idea of the potential importance of participatory governance was first truly highlighted in Agenda 21, signed at the UNCED (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. It was stated that: ::“One of the fundamental prerequisites for the achievement of sustainable development is broad public participation in decision-making.” What this means is that the public needs to be more actively involved along with the other stakeholders and authoritative bodies. This stems from democratic principles where the people are empowered to choose their own government, so with environmental concerns perhaps they should be involved in these in a similar manner. With the inclusion of people in a decision making process, it immediately secures legitimacy for these decisions.Evans, J.P. (2012) Environmental Governance, Oxon: Routledge. It is said that expert scientific knowledge is important, but often enough “lay-knowledge” is equally credible concerning certain resources (in this case an example would be a fishery) and uncertainties within science itself. By engaging public participation, the benefit is that it is able to frame the environmental decision with the community in mind and how it will impact them. This would significantly be useful for ocean governance at a local and national level, in particular areas with coastal communities. Due to the nature of participatory governance being resource intensive, it would be harder to expand this to regional levels and beyond. It is also important to not necessarily enrol too many stakeholders, as there may be the ‘participation paradox’ that essentially means the greater the number of stakeholders, the fewer the responsibilities and involvement of each one and their effectiveness is reduced in the process.De Vivero, J., Mateos, J. and del Corral, D. (2008) The paradox of public participation in fisheries governance. The rising number of actors and the devolution process. Marine Policy, 32, pp. 319–25. Importance of Participatory Governance to Integrated Coastal and Ocean Management in Canada (ICOM) In 2002, Canada introduced the Oceans Strategy, which was heavily based on participatory governance principles: ::“The governance model proposed for Integrated Management is one of collaboration. It involves ocean management decisions based on shared information, on consultation with stakeholders, and on their advisory or management participation in the planning process. It is also based on institutional arrangements that bring together all stakeholders. Participants take an active part in designing, implementing and monitoring the effectiveness of coastal and ocean management plans, and partners enter into agreements on ocean management plans with specific responsibilities, powers and obligations. It is also recognized that in specific cases, Integrated Management and planning may be achieved through co-management.”Government of Canada (2002) Canada’s Ocean Strategy: Our Oceans, Our Future. [online] Available at: [Accessed: 12/12/2011]. =Case Study: The Eastern Scotian Shelf Integrated Management (ESSIM) Initiative= The aim of the ESSIM Initiative is to create integrated and adaptive management plans that are a collaborative effort for ecosystem, social, economic and institutional sustainability of the Eastern Scotian Shelf.Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2001) The Eastern Scotia Shelf Integrated Management (ESSIM) Initiative: Development of a Collaborative Management and Planning Process. Nova Scotia: Fisheries and Oceans Canada It incorporates maintaining existing jurisdictional responsibilities, inclusion, consensus, accountability, dispute resolution, networking, evolution, and learning by doing, which are all part of the governance principles in the Oceans Strategy.BL Smith Workgroup Inc. (2004) Eastern Scotia Shelf Integrated Management Initiative: Proposed Collaborative Planning Model. A Discussion Paper. In: ‘’Oceans and Coastal Management Report 2004–2005’’: Nova Scotia: Fisheries and Oceans Canada. How it works is that the Stakeholders Roundtable (lead stakeholders and government) and the Planning Office draft up a management plan and this is then reviewed at the ESSIM Forum (an annual stakeholders’ meeting), community meetings and the general public. Overall, an agreement then must be reached with the Stakeholder Roundtable and a final plan given to appropriate federal and provincial government agencies, before acquiring final approval under the Oceans Act.Government of Canada (1996) Canada Oceans Act, RSC 1996: Bill C-26, Chapter 31, 2nd Session, 35th Parliament, 45, Eliz. 2, 1996 It has been seen as fairly successful in improving communication and cooperation within government agencies, but there is room for greater inclusion of coastal community participation to fully fulfil the participatory theory.Kearney, J., Berkes, F., Charles, A., Pinkerton, E. and Wiber, M. (2007) The Role of Participatory Governance and Community-Based Management in Integrated Coastal Management in Canada. Coastal Management, 35, pp. 79–104. Levels of implementation Ocean governance can be carried out at a local, national, regional or international level. However, there needs to be a link between all levels of implementation for “good” ocean governance to build on the theory of participatory governance at these different levels. Yet one of the greatest problems with ocean governance is that the organisations lack authority and instruments to guarantee compliance and enforcement of these laws.United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Ocean governance and institutional challenges. [online] Available at: [Accessed: 12/12/2011]. Local Community-based management features in local implementation as stated in Principle 22 at Rio. What this means is that the state needs to recognise the importance that indigenous and local communities play in sustainable environmental policy making and how they can be beneficial.United Nations (1992) Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Rio de Janeiro, 3–14 June 1992. Annex I “Rio Declaration on Environment and Development” [online] Available at: [Accessed: 11/12/2011] Also the stakeholders should take a role of responsibility with the government in a form of co-management to manage ocean resources. National At a national level, ocean governance is seen as an integrated management process within one state. This means there is a focus on almost all ministries of a government that have a function or authority related to ocean sectors and they collaborate. Due to ocean issues usually being low on a political agenda, it is said that to be successful integrated ocean policy is in need of the highest political direction and oversight to succeed.Vallejo, S.M. (1994) New structures for decision-making in integrated ocean policy. In: P. B. Payoyo (ed.) Ocean governance: Sustainable development of the sea. Tokyo: United Nations University Press, pp. 71–95. Regional At this scale, the scope of management and challenges are greater, so governance requires more organisations. It comprises Regional Seas Programme of UNEP creating programmes to be managed and coordinated by countries that share a common body of water. These Action Plans range from chemical waste to conservation of marine ecosystems.United Nations Environment Program (UNEP): Regional Seas, [online] Available at: [Accessed: 12/12/2011]. These however need to be strengthened along with The Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities (GPA). To be effective Regional Development Banks (RDBs) and Regional Governmental Organizations (RGOs) are necessary to participate and provide reinforcement of the former organisations. Therefore, a mandate is required for the implementation of sub-regional programs, agreements and conventions to ensure consensus-based decision-making. International The General Assembly of the United Nations is seen as the proficient international body to implement ocean governance. It functions by the Secretary General producing reports on the recommendations by the Consultative Process of ocean matters and the law of the sea, which are then annually reviewed by The General Assembly. Examples of marine resource governance Fishing The direct use of the ocean inherently comes from fishing for food resources, mainly for human consumption. In 2009, 79.9 million tonnes of fish were caught from a marine environment.Fishing and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (2010) The state of world fisheries and aquaculture 2010. [online] Available at: http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1820e/i1820e.pdf [Accessed: 10/12/2011]. While the FAO have stated that over half (53%) of fish stocks were said to be at full exploitation and thus their current catches are close to the maximum sustainable production levels. Therefore, it is important for an international agreement and policies to be in place, or nations will feel they are welcome to exploit the fish stocks beyond a sustainable level if there are no rules guiding fishing practices. Yet under UNCLOS, it is said that almost 99% of all fisheries are within a nation’s jurisdiction, however this is not preventing problems of exploitation. Since the mid-1980s, numerous fishery organisations appeared, which are narrowly focused but struggle to prevent global overfishing. As a result, there are problems with illegal fishing vessels, violating the laws of a fishery in which they may misreport their catches to authorities or are vessels that are not certified to be within an area of water. The reason for this is usually due to a certain fish species with a high economic value, for example Bluefin Tuna. Overcoming the problem of poor fishery management may be work best by transitioning to rights-based fishing and self-governance, which incorporates participatory governance theory. For it to work, there still needs to be a financial incentive that will fund it and ‘shares’ are distributed between the shareholders (individual/corporation, community or fishers’ collective) that are linked directly to the productivity and value of the resource, which consequently will make the shareholders appreciate the resource better and prevent overfishing.Allison, E. H. (2001) Big laws, small catches: Global ocean governance and the fisheries crisis. Journal of International Development, 13, pp. 933–950. The theory is that when shareholders have an individual share, it reduces the competition between them since they are not allowed more than their share. There is a focus on rights- based approaches in current development programmes, which have an emphasis on creating (or recreating) and supporting local institutions to the fishery. While a freedom of rights will result in economic benefits, there is a possibility of a monopolisation by more larger and powerful shareholders that will squeeze out small-scaled operations. The problem though with fisher folk having more rights, is they subsequently lack the transfer of skills to do with information, assessment, management and negotiation and they also lack sufficient funding due to their self-governing nature. An alternative approach has been introducing market incentives to encourage sustainable fishing. The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) introduced this through a fishery certification programme, with the incentive that the consumer will buy fish only caught by sustainable fisheries. This in turn creates a cycle that encourages the producer to abide by sustainable practices to gain the custom. To date (December 2011) there are currently 135 certified fisheries in the MSC Program.Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), http://www.msc.org/track-a- fishery/certified [Accessed: 13/12/2011].

Based on a 1917 Broadway stage play of the same name, the film starred Ina Claire, reprising her stage role in the title role of Polly. Clifton Webb had an early unbilled screen appearance in this film. As with many Metro Pictures productions from the period from the late 1910s to the early 1920s, this film is presumed lost. Plot Minister's daughter Polly Shannon (Ina Claire), in order to earn money go to Paris and study opera, takes a job as a maid for Clay Cullum (Harry Benham) and Harry Richardson (Clifton Webb). Cullum and Richardson are friends with shy Rex Van Zile (Ralph Graves), whose love for do-gooder Myrtle Davis (Louiszita Valentine) is unrequited. The three friends and Polly come up with a scheme to get Myrtle to notice Rex. Polly poses as a French adventuress \\"with a past\\" who pursues Rex.

Its purchase reflected Metro's efforts to obtain stories that were already well-known and popular. From the start, Ina Claire, who had played Polly on the stage, was intended to star in the film version. June Mathis began work on the script in June 1920.

Conradus's two known works appear in a manuscript assembled in Bologna, where Alexander V died in May 1410. Prior to coming to Bologna but after his election to the schismatic papacy in 1409 Alexander had been in Pistoia, Conradus's likely birthplace. Conradus was probably a singer at San Reparata in Florence, where employment records show he joined the choir in December 1410. The new antipope, newly arrived in Florence in late 1410, had a close connection with the Medici family, and Conradus was probably associated with his court as well. In addition to being a composer, Conradus was a friar of the Augustinian order. Two of his compositions survive, both three-voice ballades.

He was also Deputy Prime Minister during the First Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet and the Governor of Central Java from 1945 to 1949. Biography Wongsonegoro was born in Surakarta, Central Java, Dutch East Indies on 20 April 1897. He was an active member of the Committee for Preparatory Work for Indonesian Independence in 1945. During his time on the committee, Wongsonegoro joined several other members in expressing their concern over the wording of the tenet of Pancasila; at the time, it read \\"Belief in the one and only God, with Muslims required to follow Sharia law\\". This was feared to come into conflict with adat culture and unnecessarily burden those from other religions, and was eventually changed. Wongsonegoro's first ministerial job was as Minister of the Interior, replacing Soekiman Wirjosandjojo. He served from 4 August to 20 December 1949. The following year he replaced Abdoel Gaffar Pringgodigdo as Minister of Justice during the Natsir Cabinet, serving from 6 September 1950 to 27 April 1951. In early February 1951 he attempted to pass legislation requiring the election of a Constituent Assembly; however, the Natsir Cabinet collapsed before the bill could be passed. Wongsonegoro himself was asked to resign by his party before the collapse. He then became Minister of Education and Culture from 27 April 1951 to 3 April 1952. Afterwards, he served as the formateur of the First Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, completing the cabinet after 58 days of parliamentary crisis. Wongsonegoro received mixed reception as formateur, with nationalist and communist groups in favour and Muslim and socialist groups against him. Communist Party leader Dipa Nusantara Aidit, a hearty supporter of Wongsonegoro, spoke extremely softly (and thus, in Javanese culture, politely) to him at public meetings, to the point that at times the formateur \\"was obliged to ask another participant to be [Adiet's] microphone\\". Meanwhile, the Masyumi Party was staunchly against him, expressing concern for his attempt to keep the Socialist Party out of the cabinet. When he eventually finished forming the cabinet on 31 July 1953, he had lost support from Christian political parties and Masyumi, replacing their candidates with minor and communist-sympathizing groups. Wongsonegoro took the position of Deputy Prime Minister in this cabinet, later taking on additional duties as acting Minister of State with Responsibility for State Welfare on 29 September 1953. He resigned from both positions on 23 October. Wongsonegoro died in 1978.  Beliefs  Wongsonegoro was a Kejawen.

Life and career Matheus was probably born in the diocese of Noyon, northeast of Paris. Nothing of his early life is known, nor is his age when he begins to appear in historical records. He worked in England from about 1366 as a clerk for the son-in-law of Edward III, and later for Philippa of Hainault, queen consort of Edward. In 1368 he came back to France. The next ten years are a blank, but at some time during this period he had begun working for Robert of Geneva, who later became Antipope Clement VII. In November 1378 – the same year Clement became pope – he is recorded as being a clerk for the Louis I, Duke of Anjou, and between 1382 and 1387 he was at the papal court in Avignon as a chaplain. Music Six of his compositions have survived with reliable attribution. They include an unusual motet for five voices, Ave post libamina/Nunc surgunt (very few motets of the period have more than four voices),Günther (1980) and five secular works: three ballades and two rondeaux. Two of the ballades, and one of the rondeaux, are for three voices, and these are later compositions more associated with the ars subtilior style; the others are four voices, and were possibly written earlier.

Meister's poetry falls within a dark abstract landscape of existentialism, with tortured themes influenced by his experiences during World War II. In his 1976 collection of poems, Im Zeitspalt (\\"In Time's Rift\\"), Meister frankly addresses mortality and the nothingness of our existence as both mind and body decay into death. His poetry is noted for is spare brevity and difficult syntax and has been compared to the work of Romanian poet Paul Celan (1920–1970), Meister's contemporary in German letters. However, despite writing 16 collections of verse, Meister was not involved with the dominant literary and cultural elite and his works were relatively unknown during his lifetime. Biography Ernst Meister was raised in Hagen, Germany. He studied theology, literature, art history, and philosophy (the latter under Karl Löwith and Hans-Georg Gadamer) at various German universities before enlisting as a soldier in the Second World War. A number of war-related experiences are worked into his poems, stories, radio plays, and stage plays. His first major publication, Austellung, appeared in 1932, following which he published nothing for two decades. This period of silence ultimately gave way to the prolific last third of his life. Between 1953 and 1979, Meister produced more than 16 volumes of verse along with a number of other literary and visual works. He received a number of awards in his lifetime, including the Annette von Droste-Hulshoff Prize in 1957, the Great Art Prize of North Rhine- Westphalia in 1963, the Petrarch Prize in 1976, and the Rainer Maria Rilke Prize for Poetry jointly with Sarah Kirsch in 1978. Meister was posthumously given the most prestigious award in German literature, the Georg Büchner Prize, having been informed of the honor days before his death. He has champions within Germany literature, having been a mentor to the poet and novelist Nicolas Born and leaving many to grapple with his place in the German canon.

Early life  At the Square Room in Knoxville, Tennessee, April 17, 2010 LaFarge was born Andrew Heissler in Bloomington, Illinois. The nickname \\"Pokey\\" was coined by his mother, who would scold him to hurry when he was a child. LaFarge took an interest in history and literature during his childhood, and was greatly influenced by his grandfathers. One was a member of the St. Louis Banjo Club who gave him his first guitar and tenor banjo. The other, an amateur historian, taught him about the American Civil War and World War II. LaFarge enjoyed the writings of John Steinbeck, Ernest Hemingway, and Jack Kerouac. As a teenager, he combined his appreciation for history and writing with his discovery of blues music. In his early teens, while he was living in Normal, Illinois, LaFarge first heard blues at Jake's Pizza, run by a man named Juice. Jake's Pizza was decorated with portraits of bluesmen, and exclusively played blues; the music of Muddy Waters and Willie Dixon in particular inspired LaFarge. He discovered an appreciation for older blues musicians like Skip James, Robert Wilkins, and Sleepy John Estes. After hearing Bill Monroe at age 16, LaFarge traded the guitar his grandfather had given him for a mandolin. He adopted the name \\"Pokey LaFarge\\" because it sounded like what he was looking for musically during the time he was moving around the country. After graduating from University High School in 2001, at the age of seventeen he hitchhiked to the west coast and earned a living as a busker on streets, sidewalks, and pedestrian malls. He met Ryan Koenig and Joey Glynn of the St. Louis band The Rum Drum Ramblers while he was playing on a street in Asheville, North Carolina. Koenig and Glynn began playing with LaFarge in 2008, and the addition of Adam Hoskins in 2009 resulted in the formation of the South City Three.  Career  LaFarge in Reutlingen, Germany, May 2, 2012 LaFarge independently released his first album, Marmalade, in 2006. During the same year, he toured with The Hackensaw Boys. His second solo album, Beat, Move & Shake, was released in 2008 by Big Muddy Records. Riverboat Soul, the first album with The South City Three, was recorded in July 2009 at the Nashville studio of producer Phil Harris using vintage instruments and electronics. It was released in 2010 by Free Dirt Records and won the Independent Music Award for Best Americana Album. The group's second album, Middle of Everywhere, won the same award in 2011. The band also released Chittlin' Cookin' Time in Cheatham County produced by Jack White for his label, Third Man Records. White asked the band to collaborate with him on the song \\"I Guess I Should Go to Sleep\\" for his album Blunderbuss, followed by opening for him on tour. In 2013, LaFarge signed with Third Man Records and released his first album on the label, accompanied by a larger band that included Chloe Feoranzo, Matthew Meyer, and T.J. Muller. During the next year, he signed with Rounder Records and released Something in the Water in April 2015. In 2017 his album Manic Revelations was released on Rounder Records.

Before the Syrian Civil War, many districts of the ancient city remained essentially unchanged since its construction during the 12th to the 16th century. Being subjected to constant invasions and political instability, the inhabitants of the city were forced to build cell-like quarters and districts that were socially and economically independent. Each district was characterized by the religious and ethnic characteristics of its inhabitants. The Old City of Aleppo – composed of the ancient city within the walls and the old cell-like quarters outside the walls – has an approximate area of , housing more than 120,000 residents. Characterized by its large mansions, narrow alleys, covered souqs and ancient caravanserais, the Ancient City of Aleppo became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1986. Many sections in the Al- Madina Souq and other medieval buildings in the ancient city were destroyed and ruined or burnt as a result of clashes between the Syrian Arab Army and the rebel forces of Jabhat al-Nusra, in what is called the Battle of Aleppo, launched by the opposition JN armed groups on 25 September 2012. In February 2014, the opposition groups of the Islamic Front claimed responsibility for destroying a series of major historic buildings being used as fortified bases by the Syrian Army in the old city including the justice palace, the Carlton hotel and the old building of the city council.Bombing of the justice palaceBombing of Carlton hotelBombing of the city council 30%https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-01-20/unesco-30-percent-of- aleppos-ancient-city-destroyed of the Ancient City of Aleppo has been destroyed in the fighting. Origins and founding Pattern of ancient Aleppo Khusruwiyah Mosque, Khan al-Shouneh and Carlton Citadel Hotel were all destroyed during the battle of Aleppo Lying on the left bank of Queiq River the ancient city was surrounded by a circle of eight hills surrounding a prominent central hill on which the castle (originally a temple dating to the 2nd millennium BC) was erected in the shape of an acropolis. The radius of the circle is about . The hills are Tell as-Sawda, Tell ʕāysha, Tell as-Sett, Tell al-Yāsmīn (Al-ʕaqaba), Tell al-Ansāri (Yārūqiyya), ʕan at-Tall, al-Jallūm, Baḥsīta. With an approximate area of , the ancient city was enclosed within a historic wall of in circuit that was last rebuilt by the Mamlukes. The wall has since mostly disappeared. It had nine gates (5 of them are well preserved) and was surrounded by a broad deep ditch. The newer Jdeydeh quarters of the old city were first built by the Christians during the early 15th century in the northern suburbs of the ancient city, after the Mongol withdrawal from Aleppo. Jdeydeh is one of the finest examples of a cell-like quarter in Aleppo. As a result of the economic development, many other quarters were established outside the walls of the ancient city during the 15th and 16th centuries. Historical timeline Throughout its history, Aleppo has been part of the following states: *ca. 2400 BC–mid 23rd century BC, Kingdom of Armi *mid. 23rd century BC–mid 22nd century BC, Akkadian Empire *21st century BC–19th century BC, Eblaite Kingdom *ca. 1800 BC–1595 BC, Amorite Kingdom of Yamhad *1595 BC–ca. 1500 BC, Hittite Kingdom *ca. 1500 BC–ca. 1450 BC, Mitanni *ca. 1450 BC–ca. 1350 BC, New Kingdom of Egypt *ca. 1350 BC– early 12th century BC, Hittite Kingdom *11th century BC, Syro-Hittite kingdom of Palistin *10th century BC, Syro-Hittite kingdom of Bit Agusi *9th century BC–late 7th century BC, Neo-Assyrian Empire *early 6th century BC–mid-6th century BC, Chaldean Empire *ca. 550 BC–ca. 350 BC, Persian Achaemenid Empire *333 BC–312 BC, Macedonian Empire *312 BC–88 BC, Seleucid Empire *88 BC–64 BC, Armenian Empire *64 BC–27 BC, Roman Republic *27 BC–395 AD, Roman Empire *476–608, Byzantine Empire *608–622, Sassanid Persia *622–637, Byzantine Empire (restored) *637–661, Rashidun Caliphate *661–750, Umayyad Caliphate *750–878, Abbasid Caliphate *878–905, Tulunids *905–941, Abbasid Caliphate (restored) *941–944, Ikhshidids *944–1003, Hamdanids *1003–1038, Fatimid Caliphate *1038–1080, Mirdasids *1080–1086, Uqaylids *1086–1118, Seljuq Empire *1118–1128, Artuqids *1128–1183, Zengids *1183–1260, Ayyubids *1260 March–October, Mongol Empire *1260–1400, Mamluk Sultanate *1400 Timurid Empire *1400–1516, Mamluk Sultanate (restored) *1516–1918, Ottoman Empire *1920 March–July, Arab Kingdom of Syria *1920–1924, State of Aleppo under the French Mandate *1924–1946, French Mandate of Syria *1946–1958, Syrian Republic *1958–1960, United Arab Republic *1960–present, Syrian Arab Republic Pre- history and pre-classical era Ancient Aleppo Hadad Temple Inside Aleppo Citadel Aleppo has scarcely been touched by archaeologists, since the modern city occupies its ancient site. =Early Bronze Age= Aleppo appears in historical records as an important city much earlier than Damascus. The first record of Aleppo may from the third millennium BC if the identification of Aleppo as Armi, a city-state closely related to Ebla is correct. Armi has also been identified with the modern Tell Bazi. Giovanni Pettinato describes Armi as Ebla's alter ego. Naram-Sin of Akkad (or his grandfather Sargon) destroyed both Ebla and Arman in the 23rd century BC.Pettinato, Giovanni (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991) Ebla, a new look at history p.135Hawkins, John David (2000) Inscriptions of the iron age p.388 =Middle Bronze Age= In the Old Babylonian period, Aleppo's name appears as Ḥalab (Ḥalba) for the first time. Aleppo was the capital of the important Amorite dynasty of Yamḥad. The kingdom of Yamḥad (ca. 1800-1600 BC), alternatively known as the 'land of Ḥalab,' was the most powerful in the Near East at the time.Kuhrt, Amélie (1998) The ancient Near East p.100 Yamḥad was destroyed by the Hittites under Mursilis I in the 16th century BC. However, Aleppo soon resumed its leading role in Syria when the Hittite power in the region waned due to internal strife. =Late Bronze Age= Taking advantage of the power vacuum in the region, Parshatatar, king of the Hurrian kingdom of Mitanni, conquered Aleppo in the 15th century BC. Subsequently, Aleppo found itself on the frontline in the struggle between the Mitanni and the Hittites and Egypt. The Hittite Suppiluliumas I permanently defeated Mitanni and conquered Aleppo in the 14th century BC. Aleppo had cultic importance to the Hittites for being the center of worship of the Storm-God. = Iron Age = When the Hittite kingdom collapsed in the 12th century BC, Aleppo became part of the Syro-Hittite kingdom of Palistin, then the Aramaean Syro-Hittite kingdom of Bit Agusi (which had its capital at Arpad), it stayed part of that kingdom until conquered by the Assyrians In the 9th century BC, and became part of the Neo- Assyrian Empire until the late 7th century BC, before passing through the hands of the Neo-Babylonians and the Achamenid Persians.  Classical antiquity  Alexander the Great took over the city in 333 BC. Seleucus Nicator established a Hellenic settlement in the site between 301–286 BC. He called it Beroea (Βέροια), after Beroea in Macedon. Northern Syria was the centre of gravity of the Hellenistic colonizing activity, and therefore of Hellenistic culture in the Seleucid Empire. As did other Hellenized cities of the Seleucid kingdom, Beroea probably enjoyed a measure of local autonomy, with a local civic assembly or ' composed of free Hellenes.Phenix, Robert R. (2008) The sermons on Joseph of Balai of Qenneshrin Beroea remained under Seleucid rule for nearly 300 years until the last holdings of the Seleucid dynasty were handed over to Pompey in 64 BC, at which time they became a Roman province. Rome's presence afforded relative stability in northern Syria for over three centuries. Although the province was administered by a legate from Rome, Rome did not impose its administrative organization on the Greek- speaking ruling class. Beroea is mentioned in 2 Macc. 13:3. Medieval period and the expansion of the city The throne hall of the citadel restored during the Mamluk period The Sassanid King Khosrow I pillaged and burned Aleppo in 540. Later on, the Sassanid Persians invaded Syria briefly in the early 7th century. Soon after Aleppo fell to Arabs under Khalid ibn al-Walid in 637. In 944, it became the seat of an independent Emirate under the Hamdanid prince Sayf al-Daula, and enjoyed a period of great prosperity. On 9 August 1138, a deadly earthquake ravaged the city and the surrounding area. Although estimates from this time are very unreliable, it is believed that 230,000 people died, making it the fifth deadliest earthquake in recorded history. After Tamerlane invaded Aleppo in 1400 and destroyed it, the Christians migrated out of the city walls and established their own cell in 1420, at the northwestern suburbs of the city, thus founding the quarters of Jdeydeh. The inhabitants of Jdeydeh were mainly brokers who facilitated trade between foreign traders and local merchants. Many other districts were built outside the historic walls during the 15th and 16th centuries. Mention is made of the city, by one of the witches, in William Shakespeare's Macbeth, written between 1603 and 1607. Main sights Aleppo is characterized by mixed architectural styles, having been ruled, among the other, by Romans, Byzantines, Seljuqs, Mamluks and Ottomans. Various types of 13th and 14th centuries constructions, such as caravanserais, caeserias, Quranic schools, hammams and religious buildings are found in the old city. The quarters of Jdeydeh district are home to numerous 16th and 17th-century houses of the Aleppine bourgeoisie, featuring stone engravings. Souqs and Khans Jdeideh Ancient Aleppo, the entrance to Al-Madina Souq The city's strategic trading position attracted settlers of all races and beliefs who wished to take advantage of the commercial roads that met in Aleppo from as far as China and Mesopotamia to the east, Europe to the west, and the Fertile Crescent and Egypt to the south. The largest covered souq-market in the world is in Aleppo, with an approximate length of . Al-Madina Souq, as it is locally known, is an active trade centre for imported luxury goods, such as raw silk from Iran, spices and dyes from India, and coffee from Damascus. Souq al-Madina is also home to local products such as wool, agricultural products and soap. Most of the souqs date back to the 14th century and are named after various professions and crafts, hence the wool souq, the copper souq, and so on. Aside from trading, the souq accommodated the traders and their goods in khans (caravanserais) and scattered in the souq. Other types of small market-places were called caeserias (قيساريات). Caeserias are smaller than khans in their sizes and functioned as workshops for craftsmen. Most of the khans took their names after their location in the souq and function, and are characterized with their beautiful façades and entrances with fortified wooden doors. The most significant khans within and along the covered area of Souq al-Madina are: Khan al-Qadi from 1450, Khan al-Saboun from the early 16th century, Khan al-Nahhaseen from 1539, Khan al-Shouneh from 1546, Khan al-Jumrok from 1574, Souq Khan al-Wazir from 1682, Souq al-Farrayin, Souq al-Dira', Souq al-Hiraj, Souq al-Attarine, Souq az-Zirb, Souq Marcopoli, Souq as-Siyyagh, The Venetians' Khan,*Souq Khan al-Harir from the second half of the 16th century, Suweiqa, etc. Other traditional souqs and khans in Jdeydeh quarter (outside the walled city): *Souq al-Hokedun or \\"Khan al-Quds\\". Hokedun means \\"the spiritual house\\" in Armenian, as it was built to serve as a settlement for the Armenian pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem. The old part of the Hokedun dates back to the late 15th and early 16th centuries while the newer part was built during the 17th century. Nowadays, it is turned into a big souq with a large number of stores specialized in garment trade. *Souq as-Souf or the wool market, located at Salibeh street, surrounded with the old churches of the quarter. *Bawabet al-Qasab, a trade centre for wooden products.

Preservation of the ancient city As an ancient trading centre, Aleppo's impressive souqs, khans, hammams, madrasas, mosques and churches are all in need of more care and preservation work. After World War II, the city was significantly redesigned; in 1954 French architect André Gutton had a number of wide new roads cut through the city to allow easier passage for modern traffic. Between 1954-1983 many buildings in the old city were demolished to allow for the construction of modern apartment blocks, particularly in the northwestern areas (Bab al-Faraj and Bab al-Jinan). As awareness for the need to preserve this unique cultural heritage increased, Gutton's master plan was finally abandoned in 1979 to be replaced with a new plan presented by the Swiss expert and urban designer Stefano Bianca, which adopted the idea of \\"preserving the traditional architectural style of Ancient Aleppo\\" paving the way for prominent local activists, among them Adli Qudsi, to convince UNESCO to declare the Ancient City of Aleppo as a World Heritage Site in 1986. Several international institutions joined efforts with local authorities and the Aleppo Archaeological Society, to rehabilitate the old city by accommodating contemporary life while preserving the old one. The governorate and the municipality were implementing serious programmes directed towards the enhancement of the ancient city and Jdeydeh quarter. The German Technical Cooperation (GTZ) and Aga Khan Foundation (within the frames of Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme) had a great contribution in the preservation process of the old city. The local representative of the Aga Khan Trust for Culture from 1999 until 2008 was the architect Adli Qudsi, who played a large role in the protection of the Old City form the destructive forces of urban expansion.

It was the first train to use the Norfolk and Western Railway's tracks since the creation of Amtrak in 1971 and followed the route of the Pocahontas, the N&W;'s last passenger train. Service began in 1975 and ended in 1977. A new train, the Hilltopper, operated over much of the Mountaineer's route but was itself discontinued in 1979.  History  The Norfolk and Western Railway was one of the twenty railroads which joined Amtrak in 1971. However, in Amtrak's first four years, the N&W; hosted no passenger service over its route, the centerpiece of which was its main line between Norfolk and Cincinnati which passed through the state of West Virginia. The main driving force behind the establishment of the Mountaineer was then-United States Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia who wanted additional rail service for his constituents and pressured the Department of Transportation to add the route. 1975 map of the James Whitcomb Riley and the Mountaineer The Mountaineer at Norfolk in April 1976 The Mountaineer operated as a section of the Chicago-Washington/Newport News James Whitcomb Riley between Chicago and Cincinnati. The two trains separated at a Chesapeake & Ohio Railway (C&O;) yard in Ashland, Kentucky, with the Riley continuing to Washington and Newport News, while the Mountaineer continued to Catlettsburg, Kentucky and points east roughly twenty-five minutes behind the Riley. Westbound the procedure was reversed. The first trains ran on March 24, 1975, marking the return of rail passenger service to the Norfolk & Western. Amtrak guaranteed two years of operation, while warning that the train would \\"habitually lose money.\\" Amtrak president Paul Reistrup projected costs of $4.5 million/year while taking in $900,000 in the first year. To make the run viable the Mountaineer would need to carry 150-300 people daily between Norfolk and Cincinnati. In 1976 Amtrak announced several possible changes to the Mountaineer, including a later schedule through West Virginia and combined operation west of Cincinnati with both the Riley and an unnamed (and never implemented) Washington-Denver train. Under this plan the Mountaineer would receive new Amfleet equipment but lose its sleeping car. The schedule changes never took place, but Amtrak was forced to re-equip the Mountaineer after a harsh winter damaged many of its old steam-heated coaches and locomotives. The Mountaineer was one of eight routes suspended in January 1977, and it returned with an all-Amfleet consist, minus the sleeping car. Ridership on the Mountaineer over its two-year probationary period was disappointing: 58,991 in 1975 and 53,400 in 1976. Averaged over a 365-day year, this was 161 passengers per day in 1975 and 146 in 1976. By 1977 daily ridership had dwindled to 35. Monetary losses were far higher than expected: $5.7 million in FY1975 and $14.9 million in FY1976. After a brief respite, Amtrak discontinued the Mountaineer on May 31, 1977. A new train, the Hilltopper, operated over much of the same route until 1979.  Stations  None of the fourteen stations east of Cincinnati had seen Amtrak service before. Tri-State Station (named for the states of Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia) in Catlettsburg, Kentucky replaced an existing stop at Ashland. Amtrak built new stations at Roanoke and Bluefield. The remaining stops all used existing Norfolk & Western stations, with varying degrees of refurbishment and renovation. Two cities, Petersburg and Lynchburg, Virginia, had additional rail service at different stations. Amtrak's Florida-bound trains used the ex-Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Petersburg station, while the Southern Railway's remaining trains used Kemper Street station in Lynchburg.  Equipment  The Mountaineer's typical consist (at first) was five cars: a baggage-dormitory, two coaches, a grill diner and a 10-roomette 6-bedroom (10-6) sleeping car. When available, one of the coaches was a dome car. Starting in January 1977 Amtrak ran a consist of three new Amfleet cars, typically two coaches and a cafe.

The properties typically being manipulated can include the directed scattering of light and light absorption. The use of these to use “changeable” plasmonics is currently undergoing development in the academic community by allowing them to have multiple sets of functions that are dependent on how they are being manipulated or excited. Under these new manipulations, such as multiple layers that respond to different resonant frequencies, their new functions were designed to accomplish multiple objectives in a single application.  Overview  This article provides an overview of current developing medical usage of multiple layered plasmonics, more specifically those developed by the Halas Group at Rice University In addition to the bio-medical applications purposed, several other uses will be briefly described below. Bio-medical applications Gold shelled nanoparticles, which are spherical nanoparticles with silica cores and gold shells, are used in cancer therapy and bio imaging enhancement. Theranostic probes – capable of detection and treatment of cancer in a single treatment - are nanoparticles that have binding sites on their shell that allow them to attach to a desired location (typically cancerous cells) then can be imaged through dual modality imagery (an imaging strategy that uses x-rays and radionuclide imaging) and through near-infrared fluorescence. The reason gold nanoparticles are used is due to their vivid optical properties which are controlled by their size, geometry, and their surface plasmons. Gold nanoparticles (such as AuNPs) have the benefit of being biocompatible and the flexibility to have multiple different molecules and fundamental materials, attached to their shell (almost anything that can normally be attached to gold can be attached to the gold nano-shell, helping in identifying and treating cancer). The treatment of cancer is possible only because of the scattering and absorption that occurs for plasmonics. Under scattering, the gold plated nanoparticles become visible to imaging processes that are tuned to the correct wavelength which is dependent upon the size and geometry of the particles. Under absorption, photothermal ablation occurs, which heats the nanoparticles and their immediate surroundings to temperatures capable of killing the surrounding cells. Additionally, these nanoparticles can be made to release antisense DNA oligonucleotides when under photo- activation. These oligonucleotides are used in conjunction with the photo- thermal ablation treatments to perform gene-therapy. This is accomplished because nanoparticle complexes are delivered inside of cells then undergo light induced release of DNA from their surface. This will allow for the internal manipulation of a cell and provide a means for monitoring a group cells return to equilibrium. Another example of multiple layered plasmonics involves placing drugs inside of the nanoparticle and using it as a vehicle to deliver toxic drugs to cancerous sites only. This is accomplished by coating the outside of a nanoparticle with iron oxide (allowing for easy tracking with an MRI machine) then once the area of the tumor is coated with the drug filled nanoparticles, the nanoparticles can be activated using resonant light waves to release the drug. Other applications Active plasmonics Multiple layered plasmonics can be coated in nanoparticles to modify or drive a reaction near a metallic surface when properly excited. Additionally, the scattering of light from these plasmonics can be controlled and even directed based on the surface particles, geometry, and size. Energy applications Multiple layered plasmonics can be used in harvesting solar radiation for energy applications. This is accomplished by redirecting incident light into the waveguide and evanescent surface modes of thin film photovoltaic devices. Using multiple layered plasmons to purify water is also being investigated.

The first season premiered on Norwegian NRK1 on 25 January 2012 with a record audience of 998,000 viewers (one fifth of Norway's population), and premiered on Netflix in North America on 6 February 2012, with all eight episodes available in full for streaming on the service. Lilyhammer was promoted as \\"the first time Netflix offered exclusive content\\". The spelling of the series title alludes to Tagliano's dog Lily that was killed in the first episode during an attempt on his life, and the way that Frank and some other anglophones pronounce the town's name. The series produced three seasons; the final episode aired 17 December 2014. On 22 July 2015, Van Zandt posted on Twitter that the series had been cancelled, and the following day Netflix confirmed that they were pulling out. NRK owns the rights and remained optimistic that a deal could be made with another company for a fourth season. Van Zandt's character Frank Tagliano draws parallels with his character Silvio Dante from the HBO series The Sopranos. They are meant to be different, but most traits are the same between the two.  Synopsis  Season 1 Frank Tagliano (Steven Van Zandt), a former underboss in an American Mafia crime family, is placed in the Federal Witness Protection Program after testifying in a trial against Aldo Delucci (Thomas Grube), the new Mafia head who had ordered a hit on him after succeeding his recently deceased brother, Sally Boy Delucci. Frank requests that he be relocated to Lillehammer, where he believes no one will look for him. His new identity is Norwegian-American immigrant Giovanni \\"Johnny\\" Henriksen. On a train journey from Oslo to Lillehammer, Johnny impresses teacher Sigrid Haugli (Marian Saastad Ottesen), her son Jonas (Mikael Aksnes- Pehrson), and a man who later turns out to be a civil supervisor. Johnny befriends the Hauglis after doing them a favor, and sometime later, after he and Sigrid spend the night together, Sigrid learns she is pregnant with his twins. After a wolf kills Jonas's lamb, and the locals complain that authorities are doing nothing about it, and citizens are prohibited from killing wildlife, Johnny enlists his new friends, brothers Torgeir (Trond Fausa Aurvåg) and Roar Lien (Steinar Sagen), to help him hunt the predator. After killing the wolf and hiding its carcass mob style (by wrapping it in tarp, weighting down the body, and dropping it into an open fishing hole in an ice lake) the hunters hide in a cabin owned by Jan Johansen (Fridtjov Såheim), a local NAV worker with whom Johnny has developed a frictional relationship, and Johnny blackmails him with naked photos of underage girls Johnny took from the cabin. The supervisor, who heard shots and saw the Lien brothers in the woods the night Johnny killed the wolf, reported them to the police. However, when Johnny's neighbour, police chief Laila Hovland (Anne Krigsvoll), and police officer Geir Tvedt (Kyrre Hellum) question the trio, the supervisor remembering Johnny's favor on the train – says he'd misidentified the Lien brothers; the hunters he saw must have been youth from Oslo. Hovland and Tvedt become suspicious of Johnny when he opens his nightclub, the Flamingo. When the local biker gang attempts to start a war with Johnny, he hires them to deliver the club's alcohol supply. Johnny invests in an apartment complex and is promised his own penthouse. Eventually, Johnny is told the apartments are meant for families, and he schemes his way out of the deal, making a profit. Meanwhile, Geir edits a photo of Johnny to make him appear as a terrorist and presents it to Laila, who dismisses it. Geir is later suspended after he mistakes a toy gun Johnny is holding for a real one during a local ski race and interrupts the race to tackle him. Laila gifts Geir a trip to Graceland in Memphis to visit the home of his idol, Elvis. While stopped in New York, Geir learns that Johnny bears a similarity to vanished criminal Frank Tagliano and attempts to investigate. In New York, Geir befriends a transsexual, who uses her knowledge of underworld hangouts to show Geir where he might collect information about Johnny. Aldo learns of Geir's appearance and sends hitman Robert Grasso (Tim Ahern) and Aldo's nephew Jerry (Greg Canestrari) to interrogate Geir and find information regarding Frank's location. While being interrogated, Geir attacks his captors but is shot and killed in the struggle. When Aldo learns that Geir was from Lillehammer, he sends Robert and Jerry to Norway. Meanwhile, in Lillehammer, Johnny purchases a penthouse and invites Sigrid and Jonas to move in. When a mysterious beating occurs, Laila finds a connection between Johnny and the beating. Torgeir – who'd already remarked upon Johnny's unusual knowledge of guns, for a restaurant owner – informs Johnny of the hitmen and becomes curious about Johnny's true identity. When Torgeir later confronts Johnny, Johnny lies and says he is a CIA Agent wanted by the criminals from his past. Eventually, Robert and Jerry kidnap Jonas, and Johnny gives chase through a nearby museum. Jonas manages to escape, and Robert kills Jerry. Johnny makes a deal with Robert, providing his ring as evidence for Aldo, in New York, that Johnny died in a mutually fatal shootout with Jerry. Laila discovers the two burying Jerry's body, but allows them to go after learning that Jerry was responsible for Geir's death. When Sigrid learns of Jonas's abduction, she breaks up with Johnny. Season 2 Eight months later, British thief Duncan Hammer (Paul Kaye) arrives in Lillehammer, looking to sell a Ferrari through car salesman Dag. However, Dag owes money to Johnny and his crew, which now includes the bikers and Jan. When Johnny and Torgeir capture Dag, Torgeir, Roar, Arne (Tommy Karlsen Sandum), and Roy, the leader of the biker gang, \\"borrow\\" the Ferrari and film themselves speeding across Lillehammer's longest bridge. On the way, they hit a moose and destroy the car. Jan learns that his old fling Randi (Henriette Steenstrup) is in charge of the refugee centre and blackmails her into selling Johnny a partnership in the centre, at one-tenth its market value. Johnny and Sigrid's twins are christened. When Duncan interrogates Dag about the gang's location, he corners Torgeir in the Flamingo. Before Duncan can kill them, Torgeir stabs him through the throat with a knitting needle, and the Flamingo gang hires Arne to dispose of the body. Johnny relocates Indian IT employee Gareth to Lillehammer, to become his crew's hacker. African refugee Balotelli (Momodou Lamin Touray) is about to be deported back to Africa but Jan and Johnny intervene and employ Balotelli as the Flamingo's head chef. Duncan's brother Tony (Tony Pitts) and uncle Terry (Alan Ford) arrive in Lillehammer to find Duncan. Eventually, Tony and Terry kidnap Roar, and hold him for ransom. Johnny and Torgeir lure the gangsters to an ice lake, where they rescue Roar and leave Tony and Terry to freeze to death. Johnny wins Citizen of the Year, and Torgeir befriends local millionaire Lars Olafsen (Henrik Mestad). Lars becomes an investor in the Flamingo and convinces Johnny to fire Torgeir. Reluctantly, Johnny agrees and fires him. However, he later re-hires Torgeir and cuts Lars out of the club's future investments. Meanwhile, a bank robbery in Oslo results in the thieves' stealing files on Johnny's relocation. Laila moves to Oslo and becomes a successful writer. She is replaced by Mette Hansen (Silje Torp Færavaag), who sleeps with Torgeir and leads a raid on the Flamingo. Johnny hires his old friend, criminal Thomas Aune (Kyrre Haugen Sydness), to help him track down the thieves. Torgeir and Roar's mother, Belinda (Maylen Feragen), leaves a religious cult and returns home. Belinda's boyfriend from the cult, Swedish gangster Stanley Olsson (Johannes Brost), proposes to her and makes Johnny his best man and Roar his toastmaster. Torgeir and Roar hold a bachelor party for Stanley at the club, but Stanley begins to mistreat the dancers. The brothers kick him out of the club and leave him to wander home by himself. The next morning, Torgeir and Roar learn Stanley had raped their neighbor's sheep. They tell Johnny, who has Stanley abducted and sent back to Sweden. During Jan's birthday party, Randi walks in and finds him flirting with the dancers. She leaves and files a report on the refugee centre and herself, causing it to close down. The crew tracks down the thieves, only to learn that Thomas and his friend are working with them. Johnny's crew raids the thieves' hideout and takes the stolen items from the heist. Johnny locks up his relocation file in his safe, and he gives the stolen jewelry to Hansen. In turn, Hansen returns the items to the bank, becomes a national hero, and gets a promotion to Oslo. Thomas, now aware of Johnny's past, goes to New York, where he plans to sell the information to Delucci. When a farmer owes money to Johnny, he promises Johnny's crew a reindeer herd. Johnny's crew plans to create an avalanche and collect insurance money, but Torgeir backs out because he did not want to harm the innocent animals, and the plan is ruined. Johnny and Sigrid's twins begin at a local kindergarten, and Johnny falls for their teacher, Tiril (Viktoria Winge). However, Tiril says that relationships between teachers and parents are forbidden, so Johnny enrolls his children in another school. After hearing how Tiril's grandfather raced reindeer in the north, Johnny decides to bring reindeer racing to Lillehammer. Johnny informs Lars of the idea, and they begin promoting the reindeer race. In New York, Robert learns of Thomas's presence and kills him and his accomplice. Jan returns to the refugee centre and tells Randi to rescind the complaint report. Randi refuses, and Jan pushes her into a wall, accidentally killing her. Having discovered Randi's body and suspecting Jan, Johnny meets with him, and Jan confesses. Johnny advises Jan to disappear somewhere that he couldn't possibly be found, prompting Jan to emigrate to Iraq through his connections. Robert appears in Lillehammer and tells Johnny to return to New York to kill Delucci. Johnny, Torgeir, Roar, and Arne pose as Norwegian tour guides and sneak into a party held by Delucci in his home. On the balcony, they corner and shoot Delucci before pushing him to the street below. During a boat ride to the Statue of Liberty, Torgeir finds out that he won the lead in a local tribute to Glee, and the group returns to Lillehammer. Eight months later, the reindeer race is a success. Johnny and his friends watch from a rooftop and Johnny embraces his twin infants. Season 3 The third season premiered Friday, 21 November 2014, on Netflix. The third season begins with Torgeir and Roar visiting Rio de Janeiro so that Roar can meet Alex, a woman he met online. Roar falls head over heels for her and the two plan to be married. Back in Lillehammer, Johnny gazes out his window at a Norwegian holiday festival with costumed participants, including a boy in a tiger costume, in the street below. Johnny looks towards a window across the way and spies a beautiful blonde girl dressed in a cheerleader costume. A man approaches her from behind in what appears to be the beginnings of a lovemaking session but suddenly the man strikes the woman. Johnny runs downstairs, sprints across the street, and attempts to enter the building where the violence is taking place. The glass front doors are locked, and a dismissive clerk inside mouths, \\"We're closed\\", through the glass. Johnny breaks through the glass, grabs keys, and rushes up to where the woman is being beaten. He bursts into the room and drags the man off the woman. A one-armed woman enters behind Johnny and promptly shoots him. Shot and bleeding, Johnny staggers back down to the snow-covered street where he collapses and hallucinates that a tiger is approaching him. When he regains consciousness he is in a hospital bed. In Rio, Torgeir learns of this and returns to Norway, unable to be Roar's Best Man. The bride's brother, Oscarito, takes his place. On the day of the wedding Oscarito asks Roar to \\"perform a small favor\\" for him - transporting two gym bags to the yacht where the wedding is to take place. Overcoming his reluctance, Roar agrees in order to win favor with his bride's brother. Unbeknownst to Roar, the bags contain cocaine, and Roar and Oscarito are arrested and thrown into jail. As Johnny recovers from his gunshot wounds, he befriends a young autistic boy. The boy, now recognized as the tiger boy from earlier, is quiet and reclusive, but Johnny is able to communicate with him through their shared love for old school gangster movies such as Angels with Dirty Faces. The boy possesses an encyclopedic memory and builds a gingerbread display with the getaway car of the woman that shot him, displaying the exact license plate number of the car. Johnny then hires former Police Chief Laila Hovland as a Personal Investigator to find the people that shot him. Johnny's associate Dag has a Christmas tree delivery business that doesn't pan out. Wearing a diving suit, he intentionally drives the truck carrying the trees into a lake to collect the insurance. Also in the truck is the plastic wrap used to dispose of Randi's body. Laila is an investigator for the insurance company and the police get surveillance video of Dag in a dry suit in his truck. Dag realizes his predicament and goes back to the truck wreckage to recover the plastic wrap (which would implicate Johnny and his crew). While diving to get the wrap, Dag accidentally cuts his oxygen line and ends up in a coma. Jan Johansen returns from Iraq and confesses to the murder of his former lover Randi. Having converted to Islam and having taken a new Islamic name, Jan goes to prison and suffers the ire of former Lillehammer citizens he tormented while a government bureaucrat. In prison Jan undergoes hypnosis therapy and contrives a story in which Dag murdered Randi, framing Dag for the murder while Dag is in a coma. Johnny recovers from his injuries and tends to Roar's situation. He meets with the Norwegian Foreign Minister to have Roar freed from the prison in Brazil. The Foreign Minister also juggles a situation with a beached whale and local environmental activists. When he joins Johnny and Torgeir in Rio, protesters prevent the minister from meeting with a Brazilian official that could help to release Roar. Johnny later drugs the minister's water while he practices roller skiing in Rio and blackmails him to release Roar. Once the whale is returned to the ocean, the Brazilian official meets with Johnny and the foreign minister. Johnny uses his American-style negotiating skills, parlaying purchases for a rainforest fund in exchange for Roar's release. While in prison, Roar gets into a fight with a known telenovela filmmaker and another inmate. This results in Oscarito getting stabbed. While Roar is still in prison, Johnny begins an affair with Roar's fiancée Alex. Once Johnny secures his release, the three return to Lillehammer with Alex remaining in Rio. Once they return to Lillehammer, Johnny deals with those that shot him earlier. However, during Johnny's time in Rio, Roy and Laila investigate massage parlors owned by Lithuanians. While Roy, Arne, and another associate are receiving massages, the Lithuanians discover their association with Johnny and the three escape half-naked. When they hide out at the Flamingo, the Lithuanian man Johnny witnessed abusing the woman comes in and throws a Molotov cocktail into the Flamingo, thus severely burning Johnny's club. When Johnny returns to his business, he's angry and sucker punches Roy. Johnny eventually tracks down and hires the woman beaten in the first episode, and uses her in a gambit to abduct the Lithuanians that shot him. Once they do, they take the three Lithuanians to a farm where they plan on shipping them back to Lithuania. While marching the three to a car, Torgeir accidentally shoots the one-armed woman with a flare gun. The other two happily return to Lithuania. While the Flamingo is being repaired, Torgeir falls in love with contractor Birgitte. Torgeir tries to get selected to perform a ski jump honoring the anniversary of the 1994 Winter Olympics, and Johnny negotiates this for him. Torgeir performs the jump perfectly, and overcomes his previous failures- an injury he suffered in 1994 that kept him from performing in the games that year. Johnny starts a wine business using Israeli grapes, which draws protests from pro-Palestine activists. Johnny has his crew intimidate the main activist into dropping the protests by imitating Mossad. A New York mob associate finds himself in need of Johnny's assistance after a failed hit on a man touring the world talking about healthy Italian food, ordered by the boss in New York. This man, Tommy, enjoys Frank's small crew and setup in Lillehammer and attempts to extort local citizens and kick up to Johnny. Tommy throws a party at the Flamingo that Johnny doesn't approve of, and cracks form between the two. Tommy eventually splits from Johnny and tries to form his own crew. Meanwhile, Alex comes to Lillehammer from Rio to unite with Johnny and splits with Roar. Roar had returned to Rio at the behest of the telenovela director he met in the Rio prison. Acting in a telenovela, he became a small star in Brazil. However, he is accosted by favela criminals whose cocaine he and Oscarito misplaced. Meanwhile, Torgeir experiences hallucinations of Duncan Hammer from S2. Hammer appears to Torgeir while he's involved with Birgitte, eventually leading to some problems between the two especially now that Birgitte found she was pregnant with Torgeir's child. This eventually leads to total dissociation from Torgeir, hallucinating that he himself is Hammer. He goes on a rampage, getting in fights and vandalizing businesses before being knocked out and sent to the hospital. The hospital discovers he was suffering from a blood clot in his brain, and dissolves the clot. Torgeir then stops having hallucinations and comes to terms with his killing of Hammer. He decides to leave Lillehammer and Johnny's crew to raise his child with Birgitte. Once the police believe that Jan falsely confessed to the murder, he is released from prison and gets his old job back at the NAV. He goes to a seminar, meets another woman and starts a relationship with her. They have sex while she is driving and she hits and kills Sigrid's father. When Johnny consoles Sigrid over her loss, Alex decides to split with Johnny at Roar's suggestion. Alex begins a relationship with Tommy, and Tommy forms his small crew. Eventually things come to a head when Tommy's crew conflicts with Johnny's. A hitman sent by Tommy's boss in New York kills Tommy. Roar returns to Johnny and his brother, and Alex goes back to Brazil. Eventually, Johnny tracks down the car that killed Sigrid's father and traces it to Jan's cabin where he and his lover are staying. Johnny figures out Jan was somehow behind Sigrid's father's death, and decides to kill Jan once and for all. With the rest of the loose ends tied up, the season completed. In the last episode, Bruce Springsteen makes a cameo appearance as Frank's other brother, working as an undertaker in New York.

It appeared for the first time with Gilmour at the 1970 Bath Festival. History Gilmour purchased the guitar, a 1969 model with a maple cap fingerboard and large headstock, in 1970 from Manny's Music in New York City to replace a similar guitar his parents bought him for his 21st birthday, which had been lost while touring with Pink Floyd in the United States in 1968. The Black Strat was originally a sunburst colour, but had been repainted black at Manny's. Since then, it has undergone numerous modifications. Modifications Gilmour and the Black Strat, fitted with a rosewood fingerboard neck and white pick guard, in 1970s Throughout the 1970s, Gilmour alternated between using necks with maple and rosewood fingerboards on the Stratocaster. In 1972, Gilmour installed an XLR connector to eliminate the hum coming from his Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face; however, this was quickly removed. He also replaced the original tuners with Kluson tuners. In 1973, a Gibson PAF Humbucker was installed between the bridge and middle positions of the Strat, but he took out the original single coils and put them in the black pickguard later on. In 1976, the original bridge pickup was replaced by a DiMarzio FS-1. This in turn was replaced by a Seymour Duncan SSL-1. In the 1980s he replaced the bridge with a Kahler Tremolo System, which again was later removed. The installation of the Kahler bridge required a section of wood being cut out to accommodate the larger unit, which in turn meant a new piece of wood had to be inserted and sprayed black when the old bridge was returned. He also replaced the original tremolo arm with a shortened one. In 1986, Gilmour replaced it with three Candy Apple Red Stratocaster guitars with EMG pickups for touring and with a cream Stratocaster for rehearsals during the post Roger Waters era, retiring The Black Strat for display at the Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas, Texas. The guitar was returned to Gilmour in the late 1990s, but having not been displayed in a glass case during its time at the Hard Rock Cafe, it sustained significant damage and the theft of many of its parts. Due to the constant modifications, the only original parts on the guitar, apart from the body, are believed to be the pickup selector switch and (possibly) the bridge plate. Performance After its repair and restoration, Gilmour played The Black Strat again. This includes his On an Island tour of 2006, at Pink Floyd's reunion at Live 8 in 2005, his Rattle That Lock Tour of 2015–2016, for solos on Pink Floyd's final album The Endless River, and his 2015 album Rattle That Lock. Fender Custom Shop David Gilmour Signature Stratocaster In 2008, Fender announced that their Custom Shop would be making a David Gilmour Signature Black Stratocaster. Technicians worked with both Gilmour and his guitar technician Phil Taylor to recreate the Black Strat. The finished model features in the current Custom Shop lineup. Taylor is also the author of a book The Black Strat which covers in depth all the modifications and changes made to the Black Strat, along with its use on Pink Floyd tours and albums. Sale In early 2019 Gilmour announced he would auction many of his guitars for charity, including the Black Strat and the #0001 Strat. On June 20, 2019, the Black Strat sold for a price of , becoming the most expensive guitar ever sold at that time. The guitar was purchased by guitar collector and Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay. That record was broken on June 20, 2020, when Kurt Cobain's 1959 Martin D-18E sold at a Beverly Hills auction for ( after buyer's premium and related expenses) to Peter Freedman, co-founder of Røde Microphones. It was the guitar Cobain used when Nirvana taped its MTV Unplugged performance on November 18, 1993.

The Diffusion Map unravels the toroidal helix recovering the underlying intrinsic circular geometry of the data. Diffusion maps is a dimensionality reduction or feature extraction algorithm introduced by Coifman and Lafon which computes a family of embeddings of a data set into Euclidean space (often low-dimensional) whose coordinates can be computed from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a diffusion operator on the data. The Euclidean distance between points in the embedded space is equal to the \\"diffusion distance\\" between probability distributions centered at those points. Different from linear dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multi-dimensional scaling (MDS), diffusion maps is part of the family of nonlinear dimensionality reduction methods which focus on discovering the underlying manifold that the data has been sampled from. By integrating local similarities at different scales, diffusion maps give a global description of the data-set. Compared with other methods, the diffusion map algorithm is robust to noise perturbation and computationally inexpensive. Definition of diffusion maps Following and , diffusion maps can be defined in four steps. Connectivity Diffusion maps exploit the relationship between heat diffusion and random walk Markov chain. The basic observation is that if we take a random walk on the data, walking to a nearby data-point is more likely than walking to another that is far away. Let (X, \\\\mathcal{A}, \\\\mu) be a measure space, where X is the data set and \\\\mu represents the distribution of the points on X. Based on this, the connectivity k between two data points, x and y, can be defined as the probability of walking from x to y in one step of the random walk. Usually, this probability is specified in terms of a kernel function of the two points: k: X \\\\times X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}. For example, the popular Gaussian kernel: : k(x,y)=\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{x-y^2}{\\\\epsilon}\\\\right) More generally, the kernel function has the following properties : k(x,y) = k(y,x) (k is symmetric) : k(x,y) \\\\geq 0 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\forall x,y (k is positivity preserving). The kernel constitutes the prior definition of the local geometry of the data-set. Since a given kernel will capture a specific feature of the data set, its choice should be guided by the application that one has in mind. This is a major difference with methods such as principal component analysis, where correlations between all data points are taken into account at once. Given (X, k), we can then construct a reversible Markov chain on X (a process known as the normalized graph Laplacian construction): : d(x) = \\\\int_X k(x,y) d\\\\mu(y) and define: : p(x,y) = \\\\frac{k(x,y)}{d(x)} Although the new normalized kernel does not inherit the symmetric property, it does inherit the positivity-preserving property and gains a conservation property: : \\\\int_X p(x,y) d\\\\mu(y) = 1 Diffusion process From p(x,y) we can construct a transition matrix of a Markov chain (M) on X. In other words, p(x,y) represents the one-step transition probability from x to y, and M^t gives the t-step transition matrix. We define the diffusion matrix L (it is also a version of graph Laplacian matrix) : L_{i,j}=k(x_i,x_j) \\\\, We then define the new kernel : L^{(\\\\alpha)}_{i,j}= k^{(\\\\alpha)}(x_i,x_j) =\\\\frac{L_{i,j}}{(d(x_i) d(x_j))^{\\\\alpha}} \\\\, or equivalently, : L^{(\\\\alpha)} = D^{-\\\\alpha} L D^{-\\\\alpha} \\\\, where D is a diagonal matrix and D_{i, i} = \\\\sum_j L_{i, j}. We apply the graph Laplacian normalization to this new kernel: : M=({D}^{(\\\\alpha)})^{-1}L^{(\\\\alpha)}, \\\\, where D^{(\\\\alpha)} is a diagonal matrix and {D}^{(\\\\alpha)}_{i, i} = \\\\sum_j L^{(\\\\alpha)}_{i, j}. : p(x_j,tx_i)=M^t_{i,j} \\\\, One of the main ideas of diffusion framework is that running the chain forward in time (taking larger and larger powers of M) reveals the geometric structure of X at larger and larger scales (the diffusion process). Specifically, the notion of a cluster in the data set is quantified as a region in which the probability of escaping this region is low (within a certain time t). Therefore, t not only serves as a time parameter, but also has the dual role of scale parameter. The eigendecomposition of the matrix M^t yields : M^t_{i,j} = \\\\sum_l \\\\lambda_l^t \\\\psi_l(x_i)\\\\phi_l(x_j) \\\\, where \\\\\\\\{\\\\lambda_l \\\\\\\\} is the sequence of eigenvalues of M and \\\\\\\\{\\\\psi_l \\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{\\\\phi_l \\\\\\\\} are the biorthogonal right and left eigenvectors respectively. Due to the spectrum decay of the eigenvalues, only a few terms are necessary to achieve a given relative accuracy in this sum. =Parameter \\\\alpha and the Diffusion Operator= The reason to introduce the normalization step involving \\\\alpha is to tune the influence of the data point density on the infinitesimal transition of the diffusion. In some applications, the sampling of the data is generally not related to the geometry of the manifold we are interested in describing. In this case, we can set \\\\alpha=1 and the diffusion operator approximates the Laplace–Beltrami operator. We then recover the Riemannian geometry of the data set regardless of the distribution of the points. To describe the long-term behavior of the point distribution of a system of stochastic differential equations, we can use \\\\alpha=0.5 and the resulting Markov chain approximates the Fokker–Planck diffusion. With \\\\alpha=0, it reduces to the classical graph Laplacian normalization. Diffusion distance The diffusion distance at time t between two points can be measured as the similarity of two points in the observation space with the connectivity between them. It is given by : D_{t}(x_i,x_j)^2 =\\\\sum_y \\\\frac{(p(y,tx_i)-p(y,tx_j))^2}{\\\\phi_0(y)} where \\\\phi_0(y) is the stationary distribution of the Markov chain, given by the first left eigenvector of M. Explicitly: : \\\\phi_0(y) = \\\\frac{d(y)}{\\\\sum_{z \\\\in X} d(z)} Intuitively, D_t(x_i,x_j) is small if there is a large number of short paths connecting x_i and x_j. There are several interesting features associated with the diffusion distance, based on our previous discussion that t also serves as a scale parameter: # Points are closer at a given scale (as specified by D_t(x_i,x_j)) if they are highly connected in the graph, therefore emphasizing the concept of a cluster. # This distance is robust to noise, since the distance between two points depends on all possible paths of length t between the points. # From a machine learning point of view, the distance takes into account all evidences linking x_i to x_j, allowing us to conclude that this distance is appropriate for the design of inference algorithms based on the majority of preponderance. Diffusion process and low-dimensional embedding The diffusion distance can be calculated using the eigenvectors by : D_t(x_i,x_j)^2=\\\\sum_l \\\\lambda_l^{2t} (\\\\psi_l(x_i)-\\\\psi_l(x_j))^2 \\\\, So the eigenvectors can be used as a new set of coordinates for the data. The diffusion map is defined as: : \\\\Psi_t(x)=(\\\\lambda_1^t\\\\psi_1(x),\\\\lambda_2^t\\\\psi_2(x),\\\\ldots,\\\\lambda_k^t\\\\psi_k(x)) Because of the spectrum decay, it is sufficient to use only the first k eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Thus we get the diffusion map from the original data to a k-dimensional space which is embedded in the original space. In it is proved that : D_t(x_i,x_j)^2=\\\\Psi_t(x_i)-\\\\Psi_t(x_j)^2 \\\\, so the Euclidean distance in the diffusion coordinates approximates the diffusion distance. Algorithm The basic algorithm framework of diffusion map is as: Step 1. Given the similarity matrix L. Step 2. Normalize the matrix according to parameter \\\\alpha: L^{(\\\\alpha)} = D^{-\\\\alpha} L D^{-\\\\alpha} . Step 3. Form the normalized matrix M=({D}^{(\\\\alpha)})^{-1}L^{(\\\\alpha)}. Step 4. Compute the k largest eigenvalues of M^t and the corresponding eigenvectors. Step 5. Use diffusion map to get the embedding \\\\Psi_t. Application In the paper, Nadler et. al. showed how to design a kernel that reproduces the diffusion induced by a Fokker–Planck equation. Also, they explained that, when the data approximate a manifold, one can recover the geometry of this manifold by computing an approximation of the Laplace–Beltrami operator. This computation is completely insensitive to the distribution of the points and therefore provides a separation of the statistics and the geometry of the data. Since diffusion maps gives a global description of the data-set, it can measure the distances between pair of sample points in the manifold in which the data is embedded. Applications based on diffusion maps include face recognition, spectral clustering, low dimensional representation of images, image segmentation, 3D model segmentation, speaker verification and identification, sampling on manifolds, anomaly detection, image inpainting, and so on.

It also featured input from Yelena Khanga who provided the background story on the topic of discussion for the day. CrossTalk premiered on September 30, 2009 and airs for 30 minutes. Guests are encouraged to intervene whenever they wish which, according to Oliver Bullough in the New Statesman, means the conversation can \\"degrade into barely comprehensible shouting\\". Editions and responses In a 2010 episode of CrossTalk, Lavelle's two guests — Douglas Murray of the Centre for Social Cohesion and Anne-Elisabeth Moutet of the Rousseau Institute — were taken aback when he said that the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks were \\"not fundamentalists\\". Lavelle later said this particular episode was a \\"fiasco\\" because he lacked a \\"balanced pair of experts\\". An edition in July 2016 was a response to a NATO summit in which all participants were critical of the alliance. One participant said NATO was \\"a minute group of megalomaniac powerbrokers hell bent on sending us into a third world war\\". According to Lavelle, he had been prevented from showing a defence of NATO in captions because of technical problems, although anti-NATO captions were shown. Dominic Kennedy in The Times of London reported in August 2016 that the programme has conveyed conspiracy theories that the September 11 attacks were an inside job and AIDS being caused by AIDS drugs themselves.

Dooley, 1927-1961, a book written by James T. Fisher, provides a historical discussion of Thomas Anthony Dooley III, an American medical missionary who worked in Vietnam and Laos in the 50s and early 60s. The book itself is viewed not only as a statement on Dooley’s \\"lives\\" as a medical missionary, but it is also a socially scientific analysis of his life. A central argument of the book is that Dooley’s work laid the ideological foundation for U.S. entry into Vietnam. Other important topics discussed are Dooley's personal journey towards becoming a \\"Jungle Doctor,\\" Dooley's similarities and differences from Albert Schweitzer, Dooley as a contemporary Jesus or a redeemed man, and Dooley as a \\"historical bridge\\" between anticommunist McCarthyism and the President Kennedy's Vietnam policy. The biography is one volume of a series titled Culture, Politics, and the Cold War edited by Christian G. Appy. Synopsis Themes  Historical bildungsroman Towards a \\"Jungle Doctor of the New Age\\"  Fisher presents Dooley's life as a historical bildungsroman towards a \\"Jungle Doctor of a New Age,\\" and he makes it clear that he will do so when he says that Dooley went from an \\"Irish-American rake\\" to a worldwide celebrity who served as a \\"historical bridge\\" between McCarthyism and the change in Vietnam policies started under President Kennedy in the early 1960s. Dooley goes from a boy, adolescent, and bachelor who disregards rules and remains unaware of the sociopolitical forces shaping his character to a medical officer of the military acting as a political pawn and finally to a \\"Jungle Doctor\\" who seeks to transcend political agendas while bridging the older age of anticommunism with the newer age of the focus on the advance of communism in Vietnam starting with the Kennedy administration. At the start of Fisher's historical narrative, Dooley appears as an adolescent who defies the rules of his Catholic high school yet manages to get away with his wrongdoings because of his likable personality. Fisher presents Dooley as naive and unaware that he was being indoctrinated with Catholic values, and this aspect of his personality remains static throughout his college life. He points out that Dooley's disregard for rules contributed to his becoming a pawn for US intelligence operations in Vietnam (Dooley's expulsion from medical school compelled him to join the military and serve as medical officer). Dooley was just the man needed to establish a friendship between the United States and South Vietnam, and US intelligence officers such as Edward Lansdale exploited Dooley's personality to enhance US anticommunist presence in Indochina. Dooley’s time in the military allowed him to medically aid the destitute from North Vietnam, thereby allowing him to effectively cultivate a friendship with the emerging political leader in the South Ngo Dinh Diem. Fisher also cites Dooley's membership in the Vietnam Lobby as evidence for the idea that Dooley was exploited as a political tool for Cold War interests. But Fisher then points out that after Dooley's expulsion from the military because of his homosexuality, Dooley sought to transcend the idea of a political pawn by learning to serve as an actual \\"Jungle Doctor.\\" Like Albert Schweitzer,The Primeval Forest by Albert Schweitzer. 1931: The Macmillan Company Dooley learned how to market himself to the public, a crucial characteristic of the \\"Jungle Doctor\\" archetype that Albert Schweitzer had already established. Fisher proposes that through media and showbiz, both of which were facilitated by Dooley's experience as a pawn advancing Cold War agendas, Dooley gave himself enough of the publicity attached with assuming the \\"Jungle Doctor\\" identity that government officials were taking Dooley's plans into consideration when constructing their political agendas (unlike before, when Dooley was instructed to follow what he was told by CIA officers). Dooley obtained an avenue for self-marketing when, during his time in the military, intelligence officers connected him with William J. Lederer, a public information officer who helped Dooley publish Deliver Us from Evil. Fisher reveals how Dooley latched onto the \\"Jungle Doctor\\" identity when he adopted his first civilian mission: Operation Laos. After Dooley met with Albert Schweitzer, the exemplar of the \\"Jungle Doctor\\" archetype, to learn from Schweitzer's work, Dooley began establishing clinics in Laos which were financially fortified by donations including those from Catholic congregations. During these missions, Dooley was portrayed as an altruist who genuinely cared about the people whom he served, a portrayal consistent with the \\"Jungle Doctor\\" identity. Fisher clearly mentions that Dooley's journey through life terminates not simply in his becoming a \\"Jungle Doctor\\" but also in his becoming a \\"Jungle Doctor\\" of a new age. Fisher points out that Dooley served as the \\"historical bridge\\" between the older era of McCarthyism and the newer age of Irish Catholic John F. Kennedy, and he uses two facts to support this claim. First, Dooley was friends with Kennedy's father and president Kennedy himself, and second, Dooley was also an Irish Catholic (like President Kennedy) who used showbiz to promote his work. Ultimately, Fisher presents a bildungsroman in real life: Thomas Dooley, a man who builds himself into a \\"Jungle Doctor of a New Age\\" from an \\"undisciplined Irish-American rake.\\"  Thomas Anthony Dooley III and Albert Schweitzer as Two Sides of the Same Coin  Although Dooley explicitly claims that he and Schweitzer have different, somewhat opposite philosophies as to how they approach their medical missionary work, Fisher portrays the two medical missionaries as two opposites who make similar global impacts. Whereas Fisher shows Schweitzer as a Protestant missionary from a family of intellectuals including his cousin (philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre), Dooley comes from a family of corporate businessmen of the 1920s. Schweitzer was a Protestant missionary, whereas Dooley was Irish Catholic. Whereas Schweitzer did not uniquely identify with a specific nationality while performing his medical missionary work as a whole, Fisher cites Dooley as someone who claims to bring uniquely American values to Southeast Asia. In fact, Fisher points out that Dooley's objective was to show the Laotians how good the Americans were in going to help improve their medical well-being. Fisher also presents how effective this was, citing the Laotian term Thanh Mo America (Dr. America) used to address Dooley. Not only did Schweitzer not explicitly identify with the values of his German and French background, but he also expressed his dislike for Dooley's identification with American principles. And not only did Schweitzer dislike some of the ways Dooley approached his medical missionary work, but Fisher also cites Dooley distinguishing himself from aspects of Schweitzer's identity. Whereas Schweitzer was claimed to harbor racist, colonialist, and paternalist attitudes towards the people whom he helped, Dooley explicitly mentioned in Fisher's biography that he was not racist, not colonialist, and not paternalist. However, Fisher points out that despite their differences, the two ultimately arrive at similar types of work, achieve similar results, and harbor many personal similarities. Dooley and Schweitzer showed self- righteous behavior, Schweitzer in his love for the camera and Dooley in benefiting from an eponyme song by the Kingston Trio, or even by giving media coverage to his surgical intervention for cancer to sensitize donators in favour of his foundation (Medico). Both gained world fame, as evidenced by the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to Schweitzer in 1954 and by Dooley claimed to have attained \\"world fame\\" in his obituary in Time magazine.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826793,00.html Both establish clinics (Schweitzer in French equatorial Africa and Dooley in Laos), and Fisher shows both Schweitzer and Dooley as characteristic of the \\"planner\\" model of medical missionary work described in William Easterly's The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little GoodThe White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good by William Easterly. 2006: Oxford University Press (unlike Leader Stirling,Tanzanian Doctor by Leader Stirling. 1977: McGill-Queen's University Press who adopted more of the \\"searcher\\" perspective that Easterly describes). Also, Fisher mentions that both Schweitzer and Dooley were criticized for being so absorbed with self- marketing and public image that they were absent for long periods of time from where they were performing their medical missionary work.  Contemporary Jesus or simply a redeemed man?  When evaluating Dooley, Fisher presents the question of whether Dooley is best seen as a contemporary Jesus or simply as an individual redeemed by his good works in Laos. Fisher cites a letter by a third grader to Dooley claiming that Dooley is \\"just like Jesus.\\" Teresa Gallagher names Dooley a \\"little flower of Jesus\\" in her prayer for him. However, Fisher also presents Dooley as an egotist who loves the media; Jesus, on the other hand, has been considered a selfless individual who surrenders his will to God's.http://www.catholicity.com/catechism/the_prayer_of_jesus.html Fisher also shows Dooley as a man with personal vices (such as an unawareness of the political forces shaping his character) who seeks to redeem himself from falling prey to United States political agendas. As Dooley switches from more militarily based missionary work to civilian missionary work, Fisher points out that Dooley's motivations become more religious rather than political. He points to Dooley's ardently professed Catholicism in his later life as evidence supporting this notion. While Fisher does not assess which of these two presentations is more valid, the latter portrayal of Dooley is consistent with the fact that medical missionary work has been seen as a heroic or redeeming endeavor.Medical Missionaries: Heroic, Romantic, Humanitarian by Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania. 1930: Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania  Dooley as a \\"historical bridge\\"  Fisher proposes that Dooley serves as a \\"historical bridge\\" between anticommunist McCarthyism and the focus on the advance of communism in Vietnam starting with the administration of John F. Kennedy. At the end of the book, Fisher states, \\"in the end he [Dooley] provided the bridge between Joe McCarthy and Jack Kennedy, to the great benefit of the latter....that accomplishment...ushered in a new dispensation in American life, rich in the kind of tragedy and hope this 'old romantic' had so ardently cultivated in his own brief lifetime.\\" The author points to two major points that support his claim: first, Fisher claims that Dooley's motivation to serve as a medical missionary during his time in the military was fueled by his desire to eradicate communism from South Vietnam and to establish a democracy there. This ideology was consistent with the domino theory that motivated the US to enter Vietnam.Modernity and Power: A History of the Domino Theory in the Twentieth Century by Frank A. Ninkovich. 1994: University of Chicago Press. Second, Dooley had a strong friendship with Kennedy's father, and both Dooley and Kennedy were young Irish Catholics. The fact that both anticommunism and the young Irish Catholic spirit of Kennedy were embodied in Dooley supports Fisher's claim of Dooley serving as a \\"historical bridge\\" between these two time periods. Fisher also develops the notion that Dooley'action, principes and commitment were fueling the transition from the era of a confessional help to the poors towards a post- confessional, ie humanitarian help, as a consequence of the shift from the colonial era towards the cold war era, a humanitarian action which is linked to political and economical interest to the third-world populations. J.F. Kennedy will invoke Dooley's action when creating the American Peace Corps, conceived as a tool to diffuse a pro-American feeling through a direct person to person interaction in the social field, as advocated by T. A. Dooley. Significance and Reception  Significance of the Biography  Dr. America: The Lives of Thomas A. Dooley, 1927-1961 is the first historical biography of Dooley that has been claimed to evenhandedly evaluate him as a historical figure.http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/bulletin_of_the_history_of_medicine/v072/72.3br_fisher.html Most pieces written about Dooley have either praised or condemned him. As for praise, in People magazine 18 years after Dooley's death, a priest claimed that Dooley \\"was a saint\\" and not a \\"CIA spook\\".http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20074218,00.html In addition, in the April 20, 1958, issue of the New York Times Magazine, Dooley is claimed to have provided a novel \\"human touch\\" to foreign aid.Thomas A. Dooley, \\"Foreign Aid--The Human Touch,\\" New York Times Magazine, April 20, 1958, 12, 96. Dooley's obituary also describes him positively, namely as someone who \\"won world fame\\" tending to the medical needs of Laotians and the Vietnamese.http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826829,00.html More critical assessments of Dooley have also been made. Some of the 1950s media condemned him as an absentee missionary who was simply attracting attention to an organization that he did not directly supervise. However, Fisher's biography provides a more neutral view of Dooley, claiming that Dooley, although in some way constrained to his \\"missionary position\\" by his successive evictions from medical exercise in the USA and from the Army, was a \\"historical bridge\\" between anticommunism and the focus on the advance of communism in Vietnam starting with the Kennedy administration. The biography is also one of the few books that evenhandedly evaluate Dooley in the context of medical missionary publications. Most publications about medical missionaries make an overall judgment about their work or their character, and the prose of these publications adheres to such judgments. Tracy Kidder, in Mountains Beyond Mountains, provides a generally favorable view of Paul Farmer as a medical missionary.Mountains Beyond Mountains: The Quest of Dr. Paul Farmer, A Man Who Would Cure the World by Tracy Kidder. 2009: Random House In the foreword to Albert Schweitzer's The Primeval Forest, William Foege portrays a generally positive view of Schweitzer, saying that his book \\"is the story of a gifted scholar who had golden opportunities to enrich himself.\\"The Primeval Forest by Albert Schweitzer. Foreword. 1998: The Johns Hopkins University Press. Publications making more negative statements of medical missionaries are also present. Toni Morrison's bestselling novel Song of Solomon provides an unfavorable view of Schweitzer, presenting him as someone who didn't care about Africans but who was \\"in a laboratory testing himself.\\"Song of Solomon by Toni Morrison. 2004: First Vintage International Edition. Fisher's publication ultimately remains as one of the few that provide an evenhanded portrayal of a medical missionary.  Contemporary Reception  The biography received generally positive reviews. Kirkus Reviews magazine described the book as \\"an accomplished biography of an almost forgotten, but important, player in American Vietnam War policy-making in the 1950s,\\" calling it \\"insightful and enlightening.\\"http://www.abebooks.com/9781558491540/America-Lives-Thomas- Dooley-1927-1961-1558491546/plp Washington Post Book World affirmed the book's evenhanded portrayal of Dooley. The reviewer said that Fisher \\"gives us, as his subtitle promises, many 'lives': a vain, arrogant, self-promoting, ambitious, manipulative storyteller who knew how to exaggerate, tell small fibs and big lies; but also a sensitive, generous, idealistic and compassionate doctor who put himself on the line, under difficult circumstances for the most needy of people.\\"http://www.buy.com/prod/dr- america-the-lives-of-thomas-a-dooley-1927-1961/30272012.html  Disagreements with Fisher's Analysis  One review published in The Catholic Historical Review disagrees with Fisher's analysis of Dooley's personality. Reviewer William D. Sharpe said that Fisher mistakenly pointed to Dooley's homosexuality as Dooley's personal flaw. Sharpe said that Dooley's personal flaw was his \\"lying, egocentricity, manipulativeness, and lack of close human relationships,\\" not his unconventional relationships with his other men.Dr. America: The Lives of Thomas A. Dooley, 1927-1961 by James T. Fisher. Review by: William D. Sharpe. The Catholic Historical Review, Vol. 84, No. 3 (Jul., 1998), pp. 594-595. Also, while Fisher calls Dooley an \\"authentic spy,\\" a priest quoted in People magazine claims that Dooley was \\"a CIA informant, not a spy.\\" In addition, while Fisher presents Dooley's life as growth into a \\"Jungle Doctor,\\" he presents quotations claiming that Dooley remains an \\"overgrown kid\\" throughout his life.

In the view of supervised learning, preference learning trains on a set of items which have preferences toward labels or other items and predicts the preferences for all items. While the concept of preference learning has been emerged for some time in many fields such as economics, it's a relatively new topic in Artificial Intelligence research. Several workshops have been discussing preference learning and related topics in the past decade. Tasks The main task in preference learning concerns problems in \\"learning to rank\\". According to different types of preference information observed, the tasks are categorized as three main problems in the book Preference Learning: Label ranking In label ranking, the model has an instance space X=\\\\\\\\{x_i\\\\\\\\}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and a finite set of labels Y=\\\\\\\\{y_ii=1,2,\\\\cdots,k\\\\\\\\}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. The preference information is given in the form y_i \\\\succ_{x} y_j\\\\,\\\\\\\\! indicating instance x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! shows preference in y_i\\\\,\\\\\\\\! rather than y_j\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. A set of preference information is used as training data in the model. The task of this model is to find a preference ranking among the labels for any instance. It was observed some conventional classification problems can be generalized in the framework of label ranking problem: if a training instance x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is labeled as class y_i\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, it implies that \\\\forall j eq i, y_i \\\\succ_{x} y_j\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. In the multi-label case, x\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is associated with a set of labels L \\\\subseteq Y\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and thus the model can extract a set of preference information \\\\\\\\{y_i \\\\succ_{x} y_j  y_i \\\\in L, y_j \\\\in Y\\\\backslash L\\\\\\\\}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Training a preference model on this preference information and the classification result of an instance is just the corresponding top ranking label. Instance ranking Instance ranking also has the instance space X\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and label set Y\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. In this task, labels are defined to have a fixed order y_1 \\\\succ y_2 \\\\succ \\\\cdots \\\\succ y_k\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and each instance x_l\\\\,\\\\\\\\! is associated with a label y_l\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Giving a set of instances as training data, the goal of this task is to find the ranking order for a new set of instances. Object ranking Object ranking is similar to instance ranking except that no labels are associated with instances. Given a set of pairwise preference information in the form x_i \\\\succ x_j\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and the model should find out a ranking order among instances. Techniques There are two practical representations of the preference information A \\\\succ B\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. One is assigning A\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and B\\\\,\\\\\\\\! with two real numbers a\\\\,\\\\\\\\! and b\\\\,\\\\\\\\! respectively such that a > b\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Another one is assigning a binary value V(A,B) \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! for all pairs (A,B)\\\\,\\\\\\\\! denoting whether A \\\\succ B\\\\,\\\\\\\\! or B \\\\succ A\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Corresponding to these two different representations, there are two different techniques applied to the learning process. Utility function If we can find a mapping from data to real numbers, ranking the data can be solved by ranking the real numbers. This mapping is called utility function. For label ranking the mapping is a function f: X \\\\times Y \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\,\\\\\\\\! such that y_i \\\\succ_x y_j \\\\Rightarrow f(x,y_i) > f(x,y_j)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. For instance ranking and object ranking, the mapping is a function f: X \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R}\\\\,\\\\\\\\!. Finding the utility function is a regression learning problem which is well developed in machine learning. Preference relations The binary representation of preference information is called preference relation. For each pair of alternatives (instances or labels), a binary predicate can be learned by conventional supervising learning approach. Fürnkranz and Hüllermeier proposed this approach in label ranking problem. For object ranking, there is an early approach by Cohen et al. Using preference relations to predict the ranking will not be so intuitive. Since preference relation is not transitive, it implies that the solution of ranking satisfying those relations would sometimes be unreachable, or there could be more than one solution. A more common approach is to find a ranking solution which is maximally consistent with the preference relations. This approach is a natural extension of pairwise classification. Uses Preference learning can be used in ranking search results according to feedback of user preference. Given a query and a set of documents, a learning model is used to find the ranking of documents corresponding to the relevance with this query. More discussions on research in this field can be found in Tie-Yan Liu's survey paper. Another application of preference learning is recommender systems. Online store may analyze customer's purchase record to learn a preference model and then recommend similar products to customers. Internet content providers can make use of user's ratings to provide more user preferred contents.

The plateau contains rich seams of high-quality coal, which led to the creation and abandonment of the mining towns of Denniston and Millerton, and the current Stockton Mine. Plans to create a new open-cast mine on the southern part of the plateau have become an environmental controversy. Physiography The Denniston-Stockton Plateau stretches approximately , from Mt Rochfort near Westport in the south to Granity in the north. It is about wide, and above sea level, lower at its northern (Millerton) and southern (Denniston) extents, and highest in the middle towards Mount Frederick. It is bisected by the Waimangaroa River into Denniston and Stockton plateaus, which are sometimes referred to individually, though the term \\"Denniston Plateau\\" is often used to refer to the entire landform and ecosystem.  Geology  The main rock on the surface of the plateau is sandstone, which has eroded into coarse and acidic silica sand. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Buller Coal Plateau\\", because beneath the sandstone are rich seams of high-quality bituminous coal, laid down in swamps 45 million years ago. Partly-decayed plant material was compressed into peat 42–45 million years ago, then covered over by encroaching ocean and rock, and compressed once again under the ocean into coal 37 million years ago. The plateau was raised to its current altitude within the last 2 million years as part of the rapidly-rising Southern Alps. mānuka scrub to Mt Wiliam The soil on the plateau is thin at best, often infertile and low in organic matter, poorly drained, and acidic; miners in Denniston had to bring all the soil required to create their flower gardens and bowling green up the Denniston Incline. The impermeable layer of sandstone means the ground is frequently waterlogged and there are large expanses of bare, eroded rock with no soil at all. Climate The plateau has a harsh climate: high rainfall, low sunshine hours, cold, wind, and often mist.  Flora  The vegetation of the plateau appears sparse and scrubby, but this is a consequence of the harsh climate and poor soils: there is a high diversity of plant species, and some of the bonsai-like small shrubs are hundreds of years old. The plateau includes alpine plants found at unusually low altitudes and several localised or endemic plants. Rātā, mānuka, and ferns growing in bare rock on the plateau In more sheltered areas and better soils, the vegetation is a low forest consisting of mānuka (Leptospermum scopiarium), mountain five-finger (Pseudopanax colensoi), southern rātā (Metrosideros umbellata), and mountain flax (Phormium colensoi). In more exposed areas the growing conditions are similar to the pakihi swampland of lower altitudes, and contains similar species such as mānuka, tangle fern (Gleischenia dicarpa), and various rushes. But the more varied topography of the plateau creates greater diversity of habitats and species, including bog pine (Halocarpus bidwillii), pygmy pine (Lepidothamnus laxifolius), yellow silver pine (L. intermedius), and several species of shrubby or stunted Dracophyllum. North towards Millerton the rocky plateau has dwarfed kāmahi (Weinmannia racemosa), and both southern and northern rātā (Metrosideros robusta). Many small flowers occur on the plateau: gentians, eyebright (Euphrasia wettsteiniana), orchids such as the mauve sun orchid (Thelymitra decora) and swamp sun orchid (T. cyanea), and in wetter areas carnivorous sundews (Drosera spatulata). Some distinctive species include: * Dracophyllum townsonii, restricted to the northern West Coast, and D. densum, found mostly on Denniston Plateau and the Paparoa Range nearby * Four species of Celmisia daisies that reach their southern limit here or in the Paparoas: mountain daisy (C. dubia), scrub daisy (C. lateralis), Dall's mountain daisy (C. dalii), and C. similus. * North Westland snow tussock (Chionachloa juncea), found only on the Denniston-Stockton Plateau Fauna Powelliphanta augusta The plateau has great spotted kiwi (Apteryx haastii), fernbirds (Poodytes punctatus) and New Zealand pipits (Anthus novaeseelandiae), as well as weka, kea, and riflemen. Reptiles include speckled skink, coastal green gecko, and forest gecko (which here inhabits scrubland). Several species of large carnivorous Powelliphanta snail are found on the plateau, and some are endemic to it and threatened by mining. * Powelliphanta patrickensis, found only on coalfields over 750 m between Denniston and Mt Rochfort and in the Millerton area * Powelliphanta lignaria 'Millerton', found only on a few hectares near Millerton, thought to be extinct, and rediscovered in 2005 * Powelliphanta augusta, whose 5 ha of habitat on Mount Augustus was destroyed by the mining company Solid Energy. The entire known population was taken into captivity in refrigerated shipping containers in 2006. Attempted reintroductions in the Stockton area were unsuccessful, and most of the population remains captive, cared for by the Department of Conservation. Male Arctesthes avatar In response to a proposed open-cast coal mine, 150 scientists and volunteers conducted a weekend \\"bio- blitz\\" on the plateau in March 2012 and discovered several new species: * a day-flying moth, Arctesthes avatar, described in 2019 and named after the movie Avatar, whose plot concerns a mining company destroying a pristine environment * a cave weta, informally dubbed the Denniston white-faced weta * a beetle, another moth, a wingless wasp, and three spiders  Conservation  The northern part of the plateau has been heavily modified by Solid Energy's large Stockton mine. In 2011 Australian-based Bathurst Resources gained consents for the Escarpment Mine Project in the southern part of the plateau towards Mt Rochfort, which would involve stripping and \\"relocating\\" the surface vegetation, removing and stockpiling the sandstone layer, and creating an open-cast mine. The land would supposedly be rehabilitated after mining, but the unique drainage and soil conditions, and thus much of the biodiversity, would be destroyed. This created years of conflict between an industry wanting jobs and profits for the people of the West Coast, and those who valued the unique and delicate ecosystem of the plateau. Environmental groups fought the consents in court for two years but they were upheld by the Environment Court in 2013. Forest and Bird proposed a 5900 ha reserve on the plateau, and organised a bioblitz to learn more about its species diversity. Bathurst was given consent to mine the plateau in 2014 by the Department of Conservation, in exchange for $21.9 million in compensation spread over seven years. During the planning process the price of coal dropped significantly, and the closure of the Holcim cement works at Cape Foulwind – the main market for the coal – made the project uneconomic; Bathurst suspended its operation in 2016.

Furr is chiefly known for historical denialism regarding the atrocities and crimes committed by Joseph Stalin in his works on the history of the Soviet Union. Furr, who has praised revisionist historians such as J. Arch Getty on the Soviet Union and scholars such as R. W. Davies, Mark Tauger, Stephen G. Wheatcroft on the Holodomor genocide question, holds fringe views regarding Soviet and Communist studies.  Biography  Born in Washington, D.C., Furr graduated in 1965 from McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, with a BA in English. He later obtained an MA and a PhD from Princeton University. Since February 1970, he has been on the faculty at Montclair State University in New Jersey, where he specializes in medieval English literature.  Works, beliefs and reception  Furr has been described by historians John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr as a historical revisionist who \\"lauded creation of Communist regimes\\" in Europe and Asia because \\"millions of workers are exploited, murdered, tortured, oppressed by capitalism\\". Writing for The Daily Beast, Cathy Young described him as \\"a 'revisionist' on a career-long quest to exonerate Stalin\\". According to British journalist John O'Sullivan writing for National Review, Furr is \\"a 'historian' who denies that Stalin committed any crimes at all. [...] Revisionist historians nostalgic for 'really existing socialism' have long sought to minimize the number of Stalin's victims and the scale of Soviet crimes. But the extravagance of Furr's claims — every accusation against Stalin false! — made it hard to take them seriously. They amount less to revisionism than to outright denial of historical reality.\\" Based primarily on the discoveries in the mass graves at Volodymyr-Volynskyi, Ukraine, Furr now believes that the Katyn massacre was committed by the Nazis rather than by the NKVD. According to Furr, some Poles were likely killed by the Soviets in retaliation for their treatment of Russian prisoners of war and other civilians which is part of controversies of the Polish–Soviet War while the Nazis shot the others later. For Furr, all defendants of the Moscow Trials were at least guilty of what they were charged of. Furr's books, especially on the Katyn massacre, have been cited in Russia as confirmation that the revisionist views are also \\"supported by foreign historians\\". Regarding the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939, Furr claims that the Soviet Union did not actually invade Poland because it no longer had a government and was not a state according to international law, further arguing that \\"at the time it was widely acknowledged that no such invasion occurred\\". According to Furr, the Polish government did not declare war on the Soviet Union and only declared war on Nazi Germany as did Britain and France. Britain did not demand the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops and France had a mutual defense treaty with Poland. Secondly, the Polish General Inspector of the Armed Forces Edward Rydz-Śmigły ordered Polish soldiers not to fight the Soviets and instead to continue fighting the Germans while the Polish president Ignacy Mościcki, who was interned in Romania since September 17, 1939, tacitly admitted that Poland no longer had a government and maintained its stance of neutrality. Finally, Furr notes that the League of Nations did not determine the Soviet Union had invaded a member state and accepted the Soviet declaration of neutrality while it voted to expel the Soviets when the Soviet Union attacked Finland in the Winter War. Furr claims that the Soviets signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact to protect the Soviet Union from a German attack on the border and preserve an independent Poland rather than planning a partition of Poland with Germany. Furr argues that Britain and France also signed the Munich Agreement, a nonaggression pact with Germany that partitioned another state and that Poland too took part in the partition of Czechoslovakia. Furr concludes by blaming the Polish government in exile, arguing that it should have remained somewhere in Poland \\"at least long enough to surrender\\" or could have fled to Britain or France rather than in neutral Romania. In Furr's words, \\"[a] 'rump' Poland might finally have agreed to make a mutual defense pact that included the USSR. That would have restarted 'collective security', the anti-Nazi alliance between the Western Allies and the USSR that the Soviets sought but UK and French leaders rejected.\\" According to Furr, this would have \\"greatly weakened Hitler; probably eliminating much of the Jewish Holocaust; certainly preventing the conquest of France, Belgium, and the rest of Europe; [and] certainly prevented many millions of deaths of Soviet citizens\\". Furr's book Khrushchev Lied attacked the speech given by Nikita Khrushchev called \\"On the Cult of Personality and Its Consequences\\", more commonly referred to in the West as the \\"Secret Speech\\". According to a review of the book by Sven-Eric Holmstrom in the Journal of the Research Group on Socialism and Democracy, \\"Furr identifies 61 allegations in Khrushchev's speech. He concludes that, with only one minor exception, every one of them is demonstrably false. In essence Furr claims to have proven that this 'speech of the century' is a fraud from beginning to end.\\" While noting that \\"the book has some formal weaknesses\\", Holmstrom declared it to be a valuable contribution to the \\"historical revisionist\\" school of Soviet and Communist studies and that \\"Furr is formally proclaiming a 'paradigm shift' for which evidence has been accumulating over many years. Furr's (and Bobrov's) work may be seen as building on that of the 'revisionists' (called 'Young Turks' when they first appeared in the mid-80s).\\" Similarly, the Russian Orthodox newspaper Russkii Vestnik described Furr's research as \\"objective\\" and \\"impressive\\". The book has been translated into Bengali, French, Galician, German, Hindi, Mandarin, Russian, Spanish, Tamil and Turkish. Furr has been accused of academic malpractice by Marxist-turned conservative Ronald Radosh. During a public debate in a university campus, Furr said that \\"I have yet to find one crime — yet to find one crime — that Stalin committed. [...] I know they all say he killed 20, 30, 40 million people — it is bulls–t. [...] Goebbels said that the Big Lie is successful and this is the Big Lie: that the Communists — that Stalin killed millions of people and that socialism is no good.\\" Furr referred to Nazi propaganda because a mediator of the discussion suggested that Furr was using tactics invented by Joseph Goebbels. Conservative writer David Horowitz listed Furr as one of the \\"101 most dangerous academics in America\\" for \\"venting his Stalinist and anti-American political passions on his helpless students\\" by claiming that the United States got what it deserved on September 11 and misinforming his students by claims like the United States being behind the attempted assassination of Pope John Paul II. Horowitz also criticized Furr for believing that \\"it was morally wrong for the United States to bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union\\". Sergey Romanov, an arch- critic of historical negationism writing for the website Holocaust Controversies, has also criticized Furr for his pseudohistorical writings on the Moscow Trials and the Katyn massacre. Calling Furr, along with Ludo Martens, a \\"brainwashed neo-Stalinist\\", Romanov has noted that Furr's writings share many similarities with those of Holocaust deniers. According to Russian government-owned news agency Sputnik, Furr believes that \\"the US and NATO have been by far the most aggressive and murderous power in the world since WW2\\" while \\"the USSR never did anything remotely comparable\\" to the crimes by the West. In May 2014, Furr held a talk at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. In a CounterPunch article published in March 2017, Furr argues that \\"[t]here was a very serious famine in the USSR, including (but not limited to) the Ukrainian SSR, in 1932-33. But there has never been any evidence of a 'Holodomor' or 'deliberate famine,' and there is none today. The 'Holodomor' fiction was invented by Ukrainian Nazi collaborators who found havens in Western Europe, Canada, and the USA after the war.\\"  Bibliography   English      References   External links  * 1944 births American communists American Marxists American socialists Historical negationism Historical revisionism Living people McGill University alumni Montclair State University faculty People from Washington, D.C.

He founded the venture capital firm Danhua Capital. Biography Zhang was born in Shanghai, China in 1963. He was accepted by Fudan University in 1978 at the age of 15, and went abroad in 1980 to study at the Free University of Berlin in West Berlin, where he received his B.S. degree in 1983. He then pursued his graduate studies at Stony Brook University (then referred to as State University of New York, Stony Brook). At Stony Brook, he initially studied supergravity (and earned his Ph.D. in 1987) with his advisor Peter van Nieuwenhuizen, before turning to condensed matter on the advice of his personal hero, Nobel laureate Chen-Ning Yang. In the final year at Stony Brook, he switched to condensed matter physics under the supervision of Steven Kivelson. Zhang was a postdoctoral Fellow at ITP in Santa Barbara from 1987 to 1989. He then joined IBM Almaden Research Center as a Research Staff Member from 1989 to 1993. Thereafter, he joined Stanford University as Assistant Professor of Physics. Beginning in 2004, he concurrently held (by courtesy appointment) titles of Professor of Applied Physics and Professor of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. In 2007, the \\"quantum spin Hall effect\\" discovered by Zhang was named one of the \\"Top Ten Important Scientific Breakthroughs in the World\\" by Science magazine. In 2010, he was named the J. G. Jackson and C. J. Wood Professor in Physics. In 2009, Zhang was chosen to be a part of an expert panel for the Thousand Talents Program. In 2013, Zhang created Danhua Capital, a venture capital firm, which raised $434.5 million across two funds. Danhua Capital's major investors include state-owned Beijing government enterprise Zhongguancun Development Group (ZDG), which has been linked to the Chinese technology transfer program Made in China 2025. He also served as an independent non-executive director at Lenovo Group and at Meitu. Zhang's wife Barbara is a software engineer at IBM. They met in kindergarten, in Shanghai. Together they have two children, a son Brian and a daughter Stephanie. Zhang died in San Francisco on December 1, 2018, at the age of 55, in an apparent suicide. His family said in a statement that he died \\"after fighting a battle with depression.\\" Zhang was a Christian. Scientific achievements Zhang was one of the founders of the field of topological insulators. He made one of the first theoretical proposals of the quantum spin Hall effect. Soon after the initial theoretical proposal, his group theoretically predicted the first realistic quantum spin Hall material in HgTe quantum wells. This prediction was soon confirmed experimentally, launching worldwide research activities. Subsequently, his group predicted numerous novel topological states of matter and topological effects, including the Bi2Se3 family of 3D topological insulators, the topological magneto-electric effect, the quantum anomalous Hall effect in magnetic topological insulators, time-reversal invariant topological superconductors, and the realization of a chiral topological superconductor and of chiral Majorana fermions using the quantum anomalous Hall state in proximity with a superconductor. Most of these predicted properties have now been experimentally observed. Earlier, Zhang also made significant contributions to other areas of physics. He and collaborators derived a topological (Chern–Simons form) quantum field theoretic description of the novel properties of fractional quantum Hall liquids, and proposed a global phase diagram for the quantum Hall states with many features that have had since been experimentally observed. He generalized the theory of fractional quantum Hall effect to higher dimensions and related it to fundamental particle physics. He also proposed an influential theory of high-temperature superconductivity based on an extended symmetry principle. In early 2000, Zhang and collaborators revitalized the field of spintronics by proposing an intrinsic spin Hall effect and relating it to geometrical phases in quantum mechanics. This proposal stimulated extensive theoretical and experimental work, and also contributed to later developments concerning the quantum spin Hall effect and topological insulators more generally. Between the years 2010–2015, Zhang and his group of physicists at Stanford University wrote three theoretical papers where they successfully showed how to test Ettore Majorana's theory of Majorana fermion, or what had previously been only a scientific hypothesis that a particle can be its own antiparticle, without the need of external forces having the same mass with the opposite charge of the electron.Prof. Shoucheng Zhang, , Lecture at Google Corp. / June 2018, minutes 7:42 - ff.

His philosophy focuses on the well-rounded life. He cited that goods, which come in four basic categories - pleasure, knowledge, achievement, and virtue - matter more the less of them you have. In his theory, he stressed that it is more appropriate to seek a balanced variety of them all instead of devoting oneself to one kind. His conception of virtue is different from the view that an agent ought to maximize their own good, which requires being virtuous. Instead, Hurka stressed that \\"agents ought to maximize the good of all, which requires conventionally right action, and as a side effect can maximize their own good.\\" Hurka has also studied the ethics of fighting Global Warming. He maintained that if we reject the notion that individuals should only pursue their own self-interest, then we can assign ethical standing to a wider range of beings besides ourselves. This is significant in addressing global warming because it morally pushes towards strategies of avoiding instead of adapting to climate change.

Work Fettiplace studied the mechanism of hearing in vertebrates. In 1976, he and Andrew Crawford developed a method of recording the electrical responses of hair cells in the isolated cochlea of reptiles. These experiments, which were the first to give extensive quantitative records from auditory receptors, showed that each hair cell is sharply tuned to a characteristic frequency and that much of the frequency selectivity in the turtle’s ear can be attributed to electrical resonance in the hair cell membrane. Later work proved that the resonant frequency was set by the density and kinetics of potassium channels, the frequency increasing with a greater number of faster channels. At least three classes of potassium channels are needed to cover the range of hearing: voltage- and calcium-activated (BK) channels, voltage-gated (Kv) channels, and inwardly rectifying channels. These channels work together with voltage-gated calcium channels to generate electrical resonance, a conclusion that was supported by mathematical reconstruction and simulations. This mechanism is present in all vertebrate classes except mammals. Another important development was the use of new methods of imaging hair cell stereociliary bundles and delivering force stimuli, providing the first demonstration of sub-micron active oscillations of the bundles. His subsequent work has focused on determining the properties, location and identity of the mechanically sensitive ion channels that transduce sound stimuli into electrical signals.

Synopsis  ShaoFeng(邵峰) is an honorable young man whose family is in charge of the business of a large-scale hotel called BaiHe Hotel. In reality, ShaoFeng is the only one in his family who has the ability to lead the big company because his grandfather, the former chairman of the company, is too old to take such a heavy burden. ShaoFeng's grandfather is in poor health and all he wishes before his death is to see his lost granddaughter, Zhang HuaXiu(张华秀). Therefore, he asks ShaoFeng(邵峰) to employ every means to look for Huaxiu(华秀). When ShaoFeng is told by his secretary that his cousin has died in a fire, he is very upset because he can't carry out his grandfather's last wish. In order to help his grandfather recover, he hires an intelligent young girl called PengXiaoQian(彭小千), who comes from a poor family with a heavy debt to pay, to play the role of his cousin. Out of her need for money, she agrees to act as his cousin and moves into Shao Feng's house. Under Xiaoqian's(小千) considerate care, ShaoFeng's grandfather recovers his health quickly and begins to like his granddaughter before long. Living in the same house, the two young people gradually take to each other. However, they never express their feelings to each other because they are cousins in the eyes of the others. Unexpectedly, ShaoFeng's ex-girlfriend LuoYingYing(骆盈盈), an excellent pianist who left ShaoFeng two years ago, comes back from Paris with the wish to patch up their broken relationship. Although Shao Feng is still dating her, he pays more attention to Xiaoqian, which makes Yinging(盈盈) unhappy. XuKai(徐凯), ShaoFeng's best friend falls in love with Xiaoqian after several meeting several times. Though he has a clear idea that Xiaoqian doesn't love him but her so-called cousin instead, he still tries his best to help Xiaoqian to deal with all her problems. When Yingying accidentally finds out that Xiaoqian is not ShaoFeng's true cousin, she threatens Xiaoqian to leave ShaoFeng in order to keep her from telling everything to ShaoFeng's grandfather. Nevertheless, instead of giving up their love, Xiaoqian chooses to face all the difficulties with ShaoFeng. Eventually, they acquire not only forgiveness but also the wishes of ShaoFeng's grandfather.

Changzhou No. 2 High School uses advanced and scientific educational methods, in order to advance Confucian culture. It nurtured many eminent figures like Zhu Muzhi (Chinese Communist news activist), Wu Ze (a famous historian), Yu Yunjie (a famous painter), and Yuan Ying (a famous writer), creating improved education in regions south of the Yangtze River (one of the famous mother rivers in Jiangsu Province). The school is well known for its highly quality education. In 1996, the school became the Province key high school. In 2005, it became one of the four-star high schools in Jiangsu.

Both the Board (established 1886) and the building were parts of an effort on the part of Hamiltonians and the broader Waikato to separate themselves from their more populous northern province, Auckland. The false-fronted single storey office building of brick and concrete, in Stripped Classical design, has a decorative pressed metal ceiling in the board room. After a fire in 1911, the building was restored under architect John Willing Warren. After the founding of the Hospital Board, healthcare care grew quickly as a significant local industry, and the nearby Waikato Hospital on Waiora (about 2 km south of the historic building) is currently Australasia's largest hospital campus site. 1930s to present The Waikato Hospital Board grew too large for the building and moved out in 1935, with the building passing into commercial use. James Treloar sold milking machine equipment to the local farming community from the site for about two decades. Hamilton Lighthouse and Wilsons Sports Centre were also tenants during this period. In 1994 the building was restored and facilities were added to the rear under the supervision of architects Vaughn Priddy and Murray Price.

The MM stands for “Majorize-Minimization” or “Minorize-Maximization”, depending on whether the desired optimization is a maximization or a minimization. MM itself is not an algorithm, but a description of how to construct an optimization algorithm. The expectation–maximization algorithm can be treated as a special case of the MM algorithm.Kenneth Lange: \\"MM Optimization Algorithms\\", SIAM, (2016). However, in the EM algorithm conditional expectations are usually involved, while in the MM algorithm convexity and inequalities are the main focus, and it is easier to understand and apply in most cases. History The historical basis for the MM algorithm can be dated back to at least 1970, when Ortega and Rheinboldt were performing studies related to line search methods. The same concept continued to reappear in different areas in different forms. In 2000, Hunter and Lange put forth \\"MM\\" as a general framework. Recent studies have applied the method in a wide range of subject areas, such as mathematics, statistics, machine learning and engineering. Algorithm The MM algorithm works by finding a surrogate function that minorizes or majorizes the objective function. Optimizing the surrogate function will either improve the value of the objective function or leave it unchanged. Taking the minorize- maximization version, let f(\\\\theta) be the objective concave function to be maximized. At the step of the algorithm, m=0,1... , the constructed function g(\\\\theta\\\\theta_m) will be called the minorized version of the objective function (the surrogate function) at \\\\theta_m if : g(\\\\theta\\\\theta_m) \\\\le f(\\\\theta) \\\\text{ for all } \\\\theta : g(\\\\theta_m\\\\theta_m)=f(\\\\theta_m) Then, maximize g(\\\\theta\\\\theta_m) instead of f(\\\\theta) , and let : \\\\theta_{m+1}=\\\\arg\\\\max_{\\\\theta}g(\\\\theta\\\\theta_m) The above iterative method will guarantee that f(\\\\theta_m) will converge to a local optimum or a saddle point as goes to infinity.

It is a member of the delafossite mineral group, which has the general formula ABO2, a group characterized by sheets of linearly coordinated A cations stacked between edge-shared octahedral layers (BO6). Delafossite, along with other minerals of the ABO2 group, is known for its wide range of electrical properties, its conductivity varying from insulating to metallic. Delafossite is usually a secondary mineral that crystallizes in association with oxidized copper and rarely occurs as a primary mineral. Composition The chemical formula for delafossite is CuFeO2, which was first determined through chemical analysis of the pure mineral by G. S. Bohart. The ratio he determined was very close to Cu:Fe:O=1:1:2, with slightly more iron than copper. Rogers. attributed this fact to a small amount of hematite in the sample. In order to determine the composition of delafossite Rogers used the Ziervogel process. The Ziervogel process is used to test for the presence of cuprous oxides by looking for the \\"spangle reaction\\" which produces thin flakes of metallic silver when cuprous oxide is mixed with silver sulfate. When Rogers heated powdered delafossite with silver sulfate solution, the spangle reaction occurred. The only oxides possibilities to consider for delafossite are cuprous copper and ferrous iron. Rogers concluded that the iron was combining with the oxygen as a radical and that it only acted as a radical. This indicated that the copper in delafossite was in the cuprous rather than the cupric form. Hence he concluded that the composition of delafossite was probably cuprous metaferrite, CuFe3+O2. This composition was later confirmed by Pabst by the determination of interionic distances in the crystal lattice. Structure The atomic structure of delafossite and the delafossite group consists of a sheet of linearly coordinated A cations stacked between edge- shared octahedral layers (BO6). In the delafossite atomic structure there are two alternating planar layers. The two layers consist of one layer triangular- patterned A cations and a layer of edge-sharing BO6 octahedra compacted with respect to the c axis. The delafossite structure can have two polytypes according to the orientation of the planar layer stacking. Hexagonal 2H types that have a space group of P63/mmc are formed when two A layers are stacked with each layer rotated 180° in relation to one another. Alternatively, when the layers are stacked each layer in the same direction in relation to one another, it makes a rhombohedral 3R type with a space group of Rm. Physical properties The color of delafossite is black, with a hardness of 5.5, and imperfect cleavage in the {101} direction. Pabst calculated the density of delafossite to be 5.52. Contact twinning has been observed in the {0001} direction. The unit cell parameters were calculated to be a = 3.0351 Å, c = 17.166 Å, V = 136.94 Å3. Delafossite is tabular to equidimensional in habit and has a black streak and a metallic luster. Delafossite has hexagonal symmetry that can have the space groups Rm or P63/mmc depending on the stacking of A cation layers. Delafossite compounds can have magnetic properties when magnetic ions are in the B cation position. Delafossite compounds also have properties dealing with electric conductivity such as insulation and/or metallic conduction. Delafossite compounds can exhibit p- or n-type conductivity based on their composition. Rhombohedral (3R), CuFeO2 properties: *P-type semiconductor, bandgap 1.47 eV *High light absorption coefficient of 7.5 cm−1 near the band gap edge at 700 nm. *High hole mobility of 34 cm2 v−1 s−1 even at doping levels as high as 1.8 × 1019 cm−3. *Good stability in aqueous environments. Hexagonal (2H), CuFeO2 properties: *unknown as pure 2H CuFeO2 is very difficult to synthesize.  Synthesis  3R CuFeO2 is often synthesized by solid state reactions, sol gel methods, and hydrothermal synthesis. Pure 2H CuFeO2 and other 2H delafossite-type oxides are difficult to synthesize. The only pure 2H CuFeO2 crystals were pure 2H CuFeO2 nanoplates with a thickness of about 100 nm which were synthesized at temperatures as low as 100 °C from CuI and FeCl3·6H2O.  Application  Solar cells: 2H CuFeO2 has a band gap of 1.33 eV and a high absorption coefficient of 3.8 cm−1 near the band gap edge at 700 nm. It demonstrated a photovoltaic effect when placed into thin film structures composed of ITO/ZnO/2H CuFeO2/graphite/carbon black. Other applications: CuFeO2 is made of earth abundant elements and has good stability in aqueous environments, and as such was investigated as photocathodes for photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2, solar water reduction, and as a cathode material in lithium batteries. Whereas the 3R phase was somewhat characterized, only X-ray diffraction and theoretical calculation of eg and t2g occupancies of the Fe3+ are available for 2H CuFeO2. Geologic occurrence In 1873, delafossite was discovered by Charles Friedel in a region of Ekaterinbug, Siberia. Since its discovery it has been identified as a fairly common mineral found in such places as the copper mines of Bisbee, Arizona. Delafossite is usually a secondary mineral often found in oxidized areas of copper deposits although it can be a primary mineral as well. Delafossite can be found as massive, relatively distinct crystals on hematite. Delafossite has since been found in mines around the world from Germany to Chile. Origin of the name Delafossite was first noted by Charles Friedel in 1873 and given the composition Cu2O·Fe2O3. The mineral was given the name delafossite in honor of the French mineralogist and crystallographer Gabriel Delafosse (1796–1878). Delafosse is known for noting the close relationship between crystal symmetry and physical properties.1839: Gabriel Delafosse et Alfred Des Cloizeaux .

This family of models was proposed by David Blei and John Lafferty and is an extension to Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) that can handle sequential documents. In LDA, both the order the words appear in a document and the order the documents appear in the corpus are oblivious to the model. Whereas words are still assumed to be exchangeable, in a dynamic topic model the order of the documents plays a fundamental role. More precisely, the documents are grouped by time slice (e.g.: years) and it is assumed that the documents of each group come from a set of topics that evolved from the set of the previous slice. Topics Similarly to LDA and pLSA, in a dynamic topic model, each document is viewed as a mixture of unobserved topics. Furthermore, each topic defines a multinomial distribution over a set of terms. Thus, for each word of each document, a topic is drawn from the mixture and a term is subsequently drawn from the multinomial distribution corresponding to that topic. The topics, however, evolve over time. For instance, the two most likely terms of a topic at time could be \\"network\\" and \\"Zipf\\" (in descending order) while the most likely ones at time could be \\"Zipf\\" and \\"percolation\\" (in descending order). Model Define : \\\\alpha_t as the per-document topic distribution at time t. : \\\\beta_{t,k} as the word distribution of topic k at time t. : \\\\eta_{t,d} as the topic distribution for document d in time t, : z_{t,d,n} as the topic for the nth word in document d in time t, and : w_{t,d,n} as the specific word. In this model, the multinomial distributions \\\\alpha_{t+1} and \\\\beta_{t+1,k} are generated from \\\\alpha_t and \\\\beta_{t,k}, respectively. Even though multinomial distributions are usually written in terms of the mean parameters, representing them in terms of the natural parameters is better in the context of dynamic topic models. The former representation has some disadvantages due to the fact that the parameters are constrained to be non- negative and sum to one. When defining the evolution of these distributions, one would need to assure that such constraints were satisfied. Since both distributions are in the exponential family, one solution to this problem is to represent them in terms of the natural parameters, that can assume any real value and can be individually changed. Using the natural parameterization, the dynamics of the topic model are given by :\\\\beta_{t,k}\\\\beta_{t-1,k} \\\\sim N(\\\\beta_{t-1,k},\\\\sigma^2 I) and :\\\\alpha_{t}\\\\alpha_{t-1} \\\\sim N(\\\\alpha_{t-1},\\\\delta^2 I). The generative process at time slice 't' is therefore: # Draw topics \\\\beta_{t,k}\\\\beta_{t-1,k} \\\\sim N(\\\\beta_{t-1,k},\\\\sigma^2 I) \\\\forall k # Draw mixture model \\\\alpha_{t}\\\\alpha_{t-1} \\\\sim N(\\\\alpha_{t-1},\\\\delta^2 I) # For each document: ## Draw \\\\eta_{t,d} \\\\sim N(\\\\alpha_t,a^2 I) ## For each word: ### Draw topic Z_{t,d,n} \\\\sim \\\\textrm{Mult}(\\\\pi(\\\\eta_{t,d})) ### Draw word W_{t,d,n} \\\\sim \\\\textrm{Mult}(\\\\pi(\\\\beta_{t,Z_{t,d,n}})) where \\\\pi(x) is a mapping from the natural parameterization x to the mean parameterization, namely :\\\\pi(x_i) = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(x_i)}{\\\\sum_i \\\\exp(x_i)}. Inference In the dynamic topic model, only W_{t,d,n} is observable. Learning the other parameters constitutes an inference problem. Blei and Lafferty argue that applying Gibbs sampling to do inference in this model is more difficult than in static models, due to the nonconjugacy of the Gaussian and multinomial distributions. They propose the use of variational methods, in particular, the Variational Kalman Filtering and the Variational Wavelet Regression. Applications In the original paper, a dynamic topic model is applied to the corpus of Science articles published between 1881 and 1999 aiming to show that this method can be used to analyze the trends of word usage inside topics. The authors also show that the model trained with past documents is able to fit documents of an incoming year better than LDA. A continuous dynamic topic model was developed by Wang et al. and applied to predict the timestamp of documents. Going beyond text documents, dynamic topic models were used to study musical influence, by learning musical topics and how they evolve in recent history.

The European route E12 highway passes along the northern and eastern shores of the lake between the town of Mo i Rana and the border with Sweden. Tverrvatnet gets its name from the fact that it is located \\"across\\" (), in a north-south direction, while most lakes in Rana are located in an east-west direction. Watershed The water in Tverrvatnet flows northwards into the lake Raudvatnet. The two lakes are connected by a short channel of water which is why the lake is sometimes considered to be the southern part of Raudvatnet. The river Tverråga flows to the north out of Raudvatnet towards the Ranfjorden. The river Tverråga is thus named after the lake Tverrvatnet, and those who gave the river Tverråga its name, did not consider Raudvatnet as a lake of its own, but as the northern part of Tverrvatnet. If Raudvatnet was the original name, the correct name of the river Tverråga, in local dialect, would in fact have been \\"Rauvassåga\\". The primary source of water into Tverrvatnet is Umskarbekken (\\"the Umskar stream\\"), flowing northwards from Umskartjørnet (\\"the Umskar water\\") on Umskaret. From the west, a brook from Fisktjønna (\\"the fish water\\") ends up as a tributary to Umskarbekken. Tverrvassgården View of the farm View of the farm The area east of Tverrvatnet was cleared by a farmer named Andreas in the 1770s. The Tverrvatnet farm (now called Tverrvassgården) was built on an important rallying point among the Ume Sami speaking population. An official document of 11 November 1789 declared Elias Nilssa (1752–1838) from Åga as the leaseholder. The next leaseholders were: *Around 1812: Kristoffer Eliassa (1784–1848) *During the 1850s: Elias Kristoffersen (1827–1902) *During the 1890s: Kristian Johan Eliassen (1859–1935) *During the 1930s: Anders Olaus Kristiansen (1888–) *November 19, 1955: John Petersen The farm could not grow grain, but potatoes and grass grew well. Potatoes were not grown along the lake Raudvatnet to the north. In 1803, the farm was taxed to 10 Swedish riksdaler, able to sow 1/2 and reap 1 barrel of grain. During the census in 1801, 5 people worked and lived on the farm. In 1838, the farm was registered in a cadastre. In 1845, the farm had 1 horse, 10 cows, 12 sheep and 4 goats. They also cultivated barley and potatoes. During the census of 1865, 8 people lived there, with 1 horse, 9 cows, and 6 sheep. Barley and potatoes were still cultivated. The owner Jacob Coldevin sold the farm to the Norwegian state in 1888. Tverrvatnet farm is the oldest farm in Rana, still running (2008). On 4 December 2006, the farmers on Tverrvatnet farm were honored with the Cultural landscape prize (), for their work on restoring the farm. Tverrvatnet farm was an important link of the trade between Sweden and Mo i Rana, before the opening on 13 August 1939 of the highway what was later named European route E12. Traders from Sweden spent their nights there. In 1904, traders paid 5 øre for an overnight stop and 10 øre if the trader brought with him a horse.Före Blå vägen, p 97. The farm was of uttermost importance during the catastrophic year of hunger on the Swedish side of the border in 1867. The situation in northern Sweden was so critical that King Oscar II of Sweden visited Mo i Rana on 13 July 1873, discussing the needs of a road between northern Sweden and Mo i Rana.Före Blå vägen, pp 39–44.

The time is shortly after the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans. Amidst rumors that Jerusalem has fallen to the Romans, a stranger arrives telling a strange story of his quest to find a child that was born in the same hour that temple fell because this child is destined to be the Messiah. The elders of the town refuse to believe his story; in fact, they are not even willing to believe that Jerusalem has really been taken by the Romans. The stranger is almost stoned to death by the town's inhabitants but he manages to escape. At this point, a young woman arrives and states that she has fled from the destruction and massacre in Jerusalem. Other messengers arrive with reports of others who are also fleeing the Romans. The woman laments that her newborn child is accursed because he was born at the same hour that the temple was destroyed.

For example, there are two series of data: : series 1: (10,20,10,20,10,20,10,20,10,20,10,20...), which alternates 10 and 20. : series 2: (10,10,20,10,20,20,20,10,10,20,10,20,20...), which has either a value of 10 or 20, chosen randomly, each with probability 1/2. Moment statistics, such as mean and variance, will not distinguish between these two series. Nor will rank order statistics distinguish between these series. Yet series 1 is \\"perfectly regular\\"; knowing one term has the value of 20 enables one to predict with certainty that the next term will have the value of 10. Series 2 is randomly valued; knowing one term has the value of 20 gives no insight into what value the next term will have. Regularity was originally measured by exact regularity statistics, which has mainly centered on various entropy measures. However, accurate entropy calculation requires vast amounts of data, and the results will be greatly influenced by system noise, therefore it is not practical to apply these methods to experimental data. ApEn was developed by Steve M. Pincus to handle these limitations by modifying an exact regularity statistic, Kolmogorov–Sinai entropy. ApEn was initially developed to analyze medical data, such as heart rate, and later spread its applications in finance, psychology, human factors engineering, and climate sciences. The algorithm A comprehensive step-by-step tutorial with an explanation of the theoretical foundations of Approximate Entropy is available at: \\\\text{Step 1}: Form a time series of data \\\\ u(1), u(2),\\\\ldots, u(N). These are \\\\text{N} raw data values from measurement equally spaced in time. \\\\text{Step 2}: Fix \\\\ m , an integer, and \\\\ r, a positive real number. The value of \\\\ m represents the length of compared run of data, and \\\\ r specifies a filtering level. \\\\text{Step 3}: Form a sequence of vectors \\\\mathbf{x}(1),\\\\mathbf{x}(2),\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{x}(N-m+1), in \\\\mathbf{R}^{m}, real \\\\ m-dimensional space defined by \\\\mathbf{x}(i) = [u(i),u(i+1),\\\\ldots,u(i+m-1)]. \\\\text{Step 4}: Use the sequence \\\\mathbf{x}(1),\\\\mathbf{x}(2),\\\\ldots,\\\\mathbf{x}(N-m+1) to construct, for each \\\\ i , 1 \\\\le i \\\\le N-m+1 : C_i^m (r)=(\\\\text{number of } x(j) \\\\text { such that } d[x(i),x(j)] \\\\leq r)/(N-m+1) \\\\, in which \\\\ d[x, x^*] is defined as : d[x,x^* ]=\\\\max_a u(a)-u^*(a) \\\\, The \\\\ u(a) are the \\\\text {m} scalar components of \\\\mathbf{x} . \\\\ d represents the distance between the vectors \\\\mathbf{x}(i) and \\\\mathbf{x}(j) , given by the maximum difference in their respective scalar components. Note that j takes on all values, so the match provided when i=j will be counted (the subsequence is matched against itself). \\\\text{Step 5}: Define : \\\\Phi ^m (r) = (N-m+1)^{-1} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N-m+1}\\\\log(C_i^m (r)), \\\\text{Step 6}: Define approximate entropy \\\\ (\\\\mathrm{ApEn}) as :\\\\ \\\\mathrm{ApEn} = \\\\Phi ^m (r) - \\\\Phi^{m+1} (r). where \\\\log is the natural logarithm, for \\\\ m and \\\\ r fixed as in Step 2. Parameter selection: typically choose \\\\ m=2 or \\\\ m=3 , and \\\\ r depends greatly on the application. An implementation on Physionet, which is based on Pincus use d[x(i),x(j)] < r whereas the original article uses d[x(i),x(j)] \\\\le r in Step 4. While a concern for artificially constructed examples, it is usually not a concern in practice. The interpretation The presence of repetitive patterns of fluctuation in a time series renders it more predictable than a time series in which such patterns are absent. ApEn reflects the likelihood that similar patterns of observations will not be followed by additional similar observations. A time series containing many repetitive patterns has a relatively small ApEn; a less predictable process has a higher ApEn.

Let's choose \\\\ m=2 and \\\\ r=3 (the values of \\\\ m and \\\\ r can be varied without affecting the result).

ApEn can be designed to work for small data samples (n < 50 points) and can be applied in real time. *Less effect from noise. If data are noisy, the ApEn measure can be compared to the noise level in the data to determine what quality of true information may be present in the data. Applications ApEn has been applied to classify EEG in psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy, and addiction. Limitations The ApEn algorithm counts each sequence as matching itself to avoid the occurrence of ln(0) in the calculations. This step might cause bias of ApEn and this bias causes ApEn to have two poor properties in practice: # ApEn is heavily dependent on the record length and is uniformly lower than expected for short records. # It lacks relative consistency. That is, if ApEn of one data set is higher than that of another, it should, but does not, remain higher for all conditions tested.

Nodes in the attractor network converge toward a pattern that may either be fixed-point (a single state), cyclic (with regularly recurring states), chaotic (locally but not globally unstable) or random (stochastic).* Attractor networks have largely been used in computational neuroscience to model neuronal processes such as associative memory* and motor behavior, as well as in biologically inspired methods of machine learning. An attractor network contains a set of n nodes, which can be represented as vectors in a d-dimensional space where n>d. Over time, the network state tends toward one of a set of predefined states on a d-manifold; these are the attractors. Overview In attractor networks, an attractor (or attracting set) is a closed subset of states A toward which the system of nodes evolves. A stationary attractor is a state or sets of states where the global dynamics of the network stabilize. Cyclic attractors evolve the network toward a set of states in a limit cycle, which is repeatedly traversed. Chaotic attractors are non-repeating bounded attractors that are continuously traversed. The network state space is the set of all possible node states. The attractor space is the set of nodes on the attractor. Attractor networks are initialized based on the input pattern. The dimensionality of the input pattern may differ from the dimensionality of the network nodes. The trajectory of the network consists of the set of states along the evolution path as the network converges toward the attractor state. The basin of attraction is the set of states that results in movement towards a certain attractor. Types Various types of attractors may be used to model different types of network dynamics. While fixed-point attractor networks are the most common (originating from Hopfield networks*), other types of networks are also examined. Fixed point attractors The fixed point attractor naturally follows from the Hopfield network. Conventionally, fixed points in this model represent encoded memories. These models have been used to explain associative memory, classification, and pattern completion. Hopfield nets contain an underlying energy function* that allow the network to asymptotically approach a stationary state. One class of point attractor network is initialized with an input, after which the input is removed and the network moves toward a stable state. Another class of attractor network features predefined weights that are probed by different types of input. If this stable state is different during and after the input, it serves as a model of associative memory. However, if the states during and after input do not differ, the network can be used for pattern completion. Other stationary attractors Line attractors and plane attractors are used in the study of oculomotor control. These line attractors, or neural integrators, describe eye position in response to stimuli. Ring attractors have been used to model rodent head direction. Cyclic attractors Cyclic attractors are instrumental in modelling central pattern generators, neurons that govern oscillatory activity in animals such as chewing, walking, and breathing. Chaotic attractors Chaotic attractors (also called strange attractors) have been hypothesized to reflect patterns in odor recognition. While chaotic attractors have the benefit of more quickly converging upon limit cycles, there is yet no experimental evidence to support this theory.* Continuous attractors Neighboring stable states (fix points) of continuous attractors (also called continuous attractor neural networks) code for neighboring values of a continuous variable such as head direction or actual position in space. Ring attractors A subtype of continuous attractors with a particular topology of the neurons (ring for 1-dimensional and torus or twisted torus for 2-dimensional networks). The observed activity of grid cells is successfully explained by assuming the presence of ring attractors in the medial entorhinal cortex. Recently, it has been proposed that similar ring attractors are present in the lateral portion of the entorhinal cortex and their role extends to registering new episodic memories. Implementations Attractor networks have mainly been implemented as memory models using fixed-point attractors. However, they have been largely impractical for computational purposes because of difficulties in designing the attractor landscape and network wiring, resulting in spurious attractors and poorly conditioned basins of attraction. Furthermore, training on attractor networks is generally computationally expensive, compared to other methods such as k-nearest neighbor classifiers.* However, their role in general understanding of different biological functions, such as, locomotor function, memory, decision-making, to name a few, makes them more attractive as biologically realistic models. Hopfield networks Hopfield attractor networks are an early implementation of attractor networks with associative memory. These recurrent networks are initialized by the input, and tend toward a fixed-point attractor. The update function in discrete time is x(t+1)=f(Wx(t)), where x is a vector of nodes in the network and W is a symmetric matrix describing their connectivity. The continuous time update is \\\\frac{dx}{dt}=-\\\\lambda x+f(Wx). Bidirectional networks are similar to Hopfield networks, with the special case that the matrix W is a block matrix. Localist attractor networks Zemel and Mozer (2001) proposed a method to reduce the number of spurious attractors that arise from the encoding of multiple attractors by each connection in the network. Localist attractor networks encode knowledge locally by implementing an expectation-maximization algorithm on a mixture-of-gaussians representing the attractors, to minimize the free energy in the network and converge only the most relevant attractor. This results in the following update equations: #Determine the activity of attractors: q_i(t)=\\\\frac{\\\\pi_i(y(t),w_i,\\\\sigma(t))}{\\\\sum_j\\\\pi_jg(y(t),w_j,\\\\sigma(t))} #Determine the next state of the network: y(t+1)=\\\\alpha(t)\\\\xi+(1-\\\\alpha(t))\\\\sum_iq_i(t)w_i\\\\,\\\\\\\\! #Determine the attractor width through network: \\\\sigma^2_y(t)=\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_iq_i(t)y(t)-w_i^2 (\\\\pi_i denotes basin strength, w_i denotes the center of the basin. \\\\xi denotes input to the net.) The network is then re-observed, and the above steps repeat until convergence. The model also reflects two biologically relevant concepts. The change in \\\\alpha models stimulus priming by allowing quicker convergence toward a recently visited attractor. Furthermore, the summed activity of attractors allows a gang effect that causes two nearby attractors to mutually reinforce the other's basin. Reconsolidation attractor networks Siegelmann (2008)* generalized the localist attractor network model to include the tuning of attractors themselves. This algorithm uses the EM method above, with the following modifications: (1) early termination of the algorithm when the attractor's activity is most distributed, or when high entropy suggests a need for additional memories, and (2) the ability to update the attractors themselves: w_i(t+1)=vq_i(t)\\\\cdot y(t)+[1-vq_i(t)]\\\\cdot w_i(t)\\\\,\\\\\\\\!, where v is the step size parameter of the change of w_i. This model reflects memory reconsolidation in animals, and shows some of the same dynamics as those found in memory experiments. Further developments in attractor networks, such as kernel based attractor networks,* have improved the computational feasibility of attractor networks as a learning algorithm, while maintaining the high-level flexibility to perform pattern completion on complex compositional structures.

Automatic basis construction is independent of prior knowledge of the domain, which allows it to perform well where expert- constructed basis functions are difficult or impossible to create. Motivation In reinforcement learning (RL), most real-world Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems have large or continuous state spaces, which typically require some sort of approximation to be represented efficiently. Linear function approximatorsKeller,Philipp;Mannor,Shie;Precup,Doina. (2006) Automatic Basis Function Construction for Approximate Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Machine Learning, Pittsburgh, PA. (LFAs) are widely adopted for their low theoretical complexity. Two sub-problems needs to be solved for better approximation: weight optimization and basis construction. To solve the second problem, one way is to design special basis functions. Those basis functions work well in specific tasks but are significantly restricted to domains. Thus constructing basis construction functions automatically is preferred for broader applications. Problem definition A Markov decision process with finite state space and fixed policy is defined with a 5-tuple {s,a,p,\\\\gamma,r}, which includes the finite state space S=, the finite action space A, the reward function r, discount factor \\\\gamma\\\\in [0,1), and the transition model P.

While S grows too large for this kind of representation. v is commonly being approximated via a linear combination of basis function \\\\Phi={\\\\phi_1,\\\\phi_2,\\\\ldots,\\\\phi_n},Richard S.

A good construction method should have the following characteristics: * Small error bounds between the estimate and real value function * Form orthogonal basis in the value function space * Converge to stationary value function fast Popular methods Proto-value basis In this approach, Mahadevan analyzes the connectivity graph between states to determine a set of basis functions. The normalized graph Laplacian is defined as: : L=I-D^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}}WD^{-\\\\frac{1}{2}} Here W is an adjacency matrix which represents the states of fixed policy MDP which forms an undirected graph (N,E). D is a diagonal matrix related to nodes' degrees. In discrete state space, the adjacency matrix W could be constructed by simply checking whether two states are connected, and D could be calculated by summing up every row of W. In continuous state space, we could take random walk Laplacian of W. This spectral framework can be used for value function approximation (VFA). Given the fixed policy, the edge weights are determined by corresponding states' transition probability. To get smooth value approximation, diffusion wavelets are used.Mahadevan,Sridhar;Maggioni,Mauro. (2005) Value function approximation with diffusion wavelets and Laplacian eigenfuctions.

Discussion and analysis There are two principal types of basis construction methods. The first type of methods are reward-sensitive, like Krylov and BEBFs; they dilate the reward function geometrically through transition matrix. However, when discount factor \\\\gamma approaches to 1, Krylov and BEBFs converge slowly. This is because the error Krylov based methods are restricted by Chebyshev polynomial bound. To solve this problem, methods such as BARBs are proposed. BARBs is an incremental variant of Drazin bases, and converges faster than Krylov and BEBFs when \\\\gamma becomes large. Another type is reward-insensitive proto value basis function derived from graph Lapalacian. This method uses graph information, but the construction of adjacency matrix makes this method hard to analyze.

He died shortly after his release from a Nazi concentration camp as a result of abuse received while imprisoned. Early life (1882–1905) Hermann Liebmann was born on August 18, 1882 in Paunsdorf (now part of Leipzig), Saxony, Germany. His father was a day laborer. Liebmann learned the trade of mold maker (German - former) and worked as a metalworker. He studied mold maker as an apprentice. He served in the military from 1903 to 1905. He worked as a metalworker until 1909. Leipzig politics (1905–1919) After his two years of military service, Liebmann joined the SPD in 1905. Liebmann was always at the focal point of developments within the SPD in Leipzig. From 1909 to 1912, Liebmann was a reporter for the Leipziger Volkszeitung, a workers newspaper in Leipzig. Starting in 1913 Liebmann served as editor of the Leipziger Volkszeitung, a post which he had until 1933. The post had been previously held by Franz Mehring who followed the revolutionary teachings of Marx and Engels. Liebmann advocated a peaceful civil approach. From 1914-1916 Liebmann served during World War I. He resigned in 1917 to protest the pro-war policies of the SPD. In 1917, along with a greater part of the Social Democratic Party, he joined in protest against the civil peace policy of the Berlin party executive of the SPD, the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands or USPD). On November 8, 1918, Liebmann became a member of the select committee of the Leipzig workers’ and soldiers’ Council (Leipziger Arbeiter- und Soldatenrats). In 1918, Liebmann became a city councilor (Stadtverordneter) in Leipzig. He served in this capacity until 1923. In 1919, as part of the city council, the street-cars, gas, water, electricity, the zoo, nurseries, and swimming pools came under the direction of the city. The housing authority also came under closer control of the city government. One of the projects Liebmann worked on was getting streetcar week passes for workers. Saxon State Politics (1919–1933) From 1919 to 1933, Liebmann served as a member of the Parliament (Landstag) of Saxony. During this time he served twice as the temporary chairman of the SPD. During part of this time, he still served as a city councilman in Leipzig. As a result of his disagreement with the party leadership, Liebmann was a member of the USPD from 1919 to 1922. During this time he served as secretary for the party in Saxony. In 1922, the SPD and USPD merged, and Liebmann returned to the SPD. This merger helped to make Liebmann one of the most popular left-wing representatives in Saxony. He stayed a member of the SPD until his death in 1935. From 1924 to 1926 Liebmann served as deputy chairman, from 1926 to 1929 as chairman, and from 1930 to 1933 assessor of the SPD parliamentary group. On April 1, 1923, Liebmann became Saxon Interior Minister and Deputy Prime Minister under Erich Zeigner (SPD). From 31 October 1923 to 4 January 1924, he held this office under Alfred Fellisch. In January 1930, Hermann Liebmann suggested a coalition of the SPD with moderate bourgeois forces to prevent the take over of Nazi fascism in Saxony. This statement provoked a heated debate within the SPD. Imprisonment and death (1933–1935) In 1933, the SPD stood as the only party not wanting to abolish the Weimar Republic. The right wing was against Liebmann due to his action against non-democratic activities. Upon Hitler becoming Germany’s Chancellor, the working party's future was uncertain. 25,000 protesters gathered in Leipzig. Hermann Liebmann addressed the crowd. This was the last time he appeared in public. In spite of the impending dictatorship, Liebmann led the SPD to 30.3% of the Leipzig vote for the March 5, 1933 parliamentary elections. This was higher than any other party. In April 1933, Liebmann was arrested and put under protective custody in Dresden. He was then brought to the concentration camp in Hohnstein. As a socialist, he was viewed as an enemy to the state. His imprisonment was administered directly by Martin Mutschmann, the Nazi regional leader (Gauleiter) of Saxony. It was during this time that he was continually abused. On May 20, 1933, Mutschmann made Liebmann read his parliamentary speeches while being beaten and tortured. Other torture included putting inmates in a sewer so that they were covered with human feces. The conditions in Hohnstein were so bad that the State court in Dresden sentenced the camp leader and 24 guards to 6 years in prison in May 1935. Hitler pardoned the leader and guards. In 1934, Liebmann was transferred to the Concentration camp at Colditz. Hermann Liebmann was released after more than two years of imprisonment on May 1935. He had previously been of sound health. He left a broken man. He was seriously ill suffering from the effects of torture and heart disease. Liebmann died in Leipzig in September 1935. His death was announced in the Leipziger Volkszeitung, which at that time was published in Karlovy Vary (Karlsbad), Czechoslovakia and smuggled into Germany. Liebmann is buried at the Sellerhausen Cemetery in Leipzig (Friedhof Leipzig – Sellerhausen). Tributes *Liebmann Hermann High School in Leipzig (closed in 1992) *Hermann Liebmann Bridge in Leipzig.

Diffusion wavelets are an extension of classical wavelet theory from harmonic analysis. Unlike classical wavelets whose basis functions are predetermined, diffusion wavelets are adapted to the geometry of a given diffusion operator T (e.g., a heat kernel or a random walk). Moreover, the diffusion wavelet basis functions are constructed by dilation using the dyadic powers (powers of two) of T. These dyadic powers of T diffusion over the space and propagate local relationships in the function throughout the space until they become global. And if the rank of higher powers of T decrease (i.e., its spectrum decays), then these higher powers become compressible. From these decaying dyadic powers of T comes a chain of decreasing subspaces. These subspaces are the scaling function approximation subspaces, and the differences in the subspace chain are the wavelet subspaces. Diffusion wavelets were first introduced in 2004 by Ronald Coifman and Mauro Maggioni at Yale University.  Algorithm  This algorithm constructs the scaling basis functions and the wavelet basis functions along with the representations of the diffusion operator T at these scales. In the algorithm below, the subscript notation \\\\Phi_a and \\\\Psi_b represents the scaling basis functions at scale a and the wavelet basis functions at scale b respectively. The notation [\\\\Phi_b]_{\\\\Phi_a} denotes the matrix representation of the scaling basis \\\\Phi_b represented with respect to the basis \\\\Phi_a. Lastly, the notation [T]_{\\\\Phi_a}^{\\\\Phi_b} denotes the matrix represents of the operator T, where the row space of T is represented with respect to the basis \\\\Phi_a, and the column space of T is represented with respect to the basis \\\\Phi_b. Otherwise put, the domain of operator T is represented with respect to the basis \\\\Phi_a and the range is represented with respect to the basis \\\\Phi_b.

The design plans from those two books influenced the construction of Australian skateparks and ramps for the following decade. In 1987 the brothers were profiled on a segment on Australian skateboarding on 60 Minutes. In that same year, they co-founded an Australian skateboarding magazine, 540. Stephen and his brother were also early snowboarders in Australia and successfully lobbied for snowboarders' access to Australian snow fields. Stephen and Peter's private company, Globe, grew throughout the 1990s, and they also licensed major streetwear labels Mossimo, Stussy, Eckō Unltd., Freshjive, Split, Hardcore Jeans and Paul Frank Industries, along with creating their own propriety brands, including Mooks and M-ONE-11.‘Gone Cosmopolitan: Inside Stephen and Peter Hill’s Globe Empire’, Transworld Surf, retrieved 16-Dec-11 In 2001, Stephen oversaw the public float of the company on the Australian Stock Exchange with his brothers, maintaining a large shareholding and subsequently appointed to the board as an executive director.25-May-2011 'Trio skating on very rich ice', Eli Greenblat, The Age, p.1, Business Stephen remained actively involved in product development and brand creation, as well as development and positioning for the company as it expanded into North America, Europe and Asia. Along with his brothers, Stephen also founded Whyte House Entertainment, a multimedia company based in Australia and Los Angeles in 1997, where he acted as an executive producer on all titles produced. In 1999, Stephen produced Tic Tac 2 Heelflip: Australia’s Skateboarding History, which played at film festivals, broadcast on national television and was released on Home entertainment formats. Stephen was also an executive producer on Love the Beast, a feature documentary featuring Eric Bana released theatrically in Australia in 2009.

The United States Navy, responding to the same incident, sent a punitive expedition in 1832. The Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 limited Dutch freedom of action in the Aceh Sultanate on the island of Sumatra. The treaty assured the independence of Aceh and obligated the Dutch to ensure the safety of shipping and overland trade in and around Aceh. In 1831 some Acehnese pirates plundered the American ship Friendship in Kuala Batee. The passing Dutch schooner Dolfijn made a failed attempt to rescue the ship, but fear of open war with Aceh and a diplomatic crisis with Britain prevented a greater Dutch response. The Acehnese were emboldened, occupied Baros and attacked the Dutch posts. The Dutch response was to declare that Baros, Singkil and Tapus lay outside the Aceh Sultanate and to prepare a party to occupy them in the name of the Batavian government. Lieutenant Colonel Roeps, the commander of Baros, was ordered to proceed on the town, only engaging the enemy when absolutely necessary. In one of those encounters, he was mortally wounded by gunfire. His replacement, Michiels, took a squadron of 700 men and fell on Baros. Lieutenant Bisschoff climbed the parapet of one of the defensive works and took down the Acehnese flag, receiving eleven klewang wounds in the act. Leaving behind their weapons and ammunition, the Acehnese retreated to Tapus and Singkil, where their main body under Mohamed Arief was waiting. Again the Acehnese were expelled and Dutch authority in Singkil was thus established. References *Terwogt, W. A. Het land van Jan Pieterszoon Coen. Geschiedenis van de Nederlanders in oost-Indië. P.

These deciduous trees and shrubs are primarily distributed in the boreal and cool temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere, with the majority occurring in Asia, many occurring in North America and a few species occurring as far south as South America.Stults, D.

While the division of the extant members of the Betulaceae into six genera is uncontroversial, the placement of these genera into higher taxonomic ranks and the level of these ranks are debated. Extensive studies on the basis of ribulose- 1,5-biphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) sequences, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, morphology, and various combined data sets support the dichotomy of the Betulaceae into two major clades.Bousquet, J., Strauss, S.

O. & Wen, J. 2007. Phylogeny Of Carpinus And Subfamily Coryloideae (Betulaceae) Based On Chloroplast And Nuclear Ribosomal Sequence Data. Plant Systematics And Evolution, 267, 25-35. A few authors have divided the genera into two families, the Betulaceae (Alnus, Betula) and Corylaceae (Carpinus, Ostrya, Corylus, Ostryopsis). Many modern authors recognize two separate clades within the family, either as tribes Betuleae and Coryleae or subfamilies Betuloideae and Coryloideae. There has also been debate on the further division of the Coryloideae into two tribes: Coryleae (Corylus) and Carpineae (Ostryopsis, Carpinus, Ostrya). Fossil record Based on distribution patterns of fossil and extant representatives (Corylus, Carpinus, and Ostrya) across temperate latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, the Betulaceae probably originated in the temperate zones of Laurasia during the Cretaceous. The pollen record also suggests that the Betuloideae predate the Coryloideae. Alnus and Betula differentiated as early 80 Mya during the Santonian in the Cretaceous. The earliest pollen grains of the Coryloideae, belonging to Corylus, appeared 67 Mya during the Maestrichtian in the Paleocene. Carpinus and Ostrya appeared later, 60 Mya and 41 Mya respectively; Ostryopsis has not yet been confirmed by similar fossil remains. Corylus subclade Corylus, commonly known as the hazels, is often considered a sister group to the Ostryopsis-Carpinus-Ostrya subclade. Corylus is placed as the sister group to the remaining Coryloideae because it shares plesiomorphic character states with the Betuloideae such as bisexual inflorescences, staminate flowers with a perianth, a haploid chromosome number of 14, and nonoperculate pollen apertures with thickened endexine. The monophyly of Corylus species is defined by several morphological synapomorphies, including the large animal-dispersed nuts, hypogeal seed germination, and filaments that are completely divided longitudinally. The genus is recognized as having either two or three main divisions as sections or subgenera, with sections often being divided into subsections. Some authors divide it into subgenera Acanthochlamys, Phyllochlamys, and Siphonochlamys. Others divide the genus into two sections (Acanthochlamys and Corylus) with section Corylus into three subsections (Corylus, Colurnae, and Siphonochlamys). Ostryopsis–Carpinus–Ostrya subclade The Ostryopsis–Carpinus–Ostrya subclade is defined by staminate flowers without a perianth, operculate pollen apertures with endexine not thickening at apertural region, a base chromosome number of 8, and a plicate leaf vernation pattern. Several characters, including glabrous receptacle of staminate flowers, smooth nutlet surface, and secondary veins extending directly into leaf teeth, differentiate Ostryopsis from Carpinus and Ostrya. Ostryopsis is often considered the sister group of Carpinus and Ostrya, but its phylogenetic position is debated. A close relationship with Corylus is supported by wood anatomy characters and chloroplast gene sequences. The placement of Ostryopsis as sister to the Ostrya-Carpinus clade is supported by a phylogenetic tree based on chloroplast DNA data but placement basal to Corylus is supported in an ITS-based tree. Carpinus is often considered sister to Ostrya. DNA sequences suggest that Carpinus might have differentiated from the extinct genus Palaeocarpinus. Carpinus is defined by several morphological characters including presence of pistillodes in the male florets, and leafy bracts subtending the flowers and fruits. Carpinus is divided into two sections, Distegocarpus and Carpinus, based on floral bracts, infructescences, and scales. Section Carpinus is further divided into three subsections – Carpinus, Monbeigianae and Polyneurae. The monophyly of the genus is debatable. ITS data suggests the genus is paraphyletic while chloroplast DNA and nuclear 5S spacer data support it as monophyletic. Carpinus may also be considered paraphyletic depending on the placement of Ostrya. Ostrya has a close relationship with Carpinus, which is strongly supported by ITS and rbcL sequences and morphological and combined data from several studies. Although both genera share similar inflorescences, pollen grains and vessels with simple perforations, they differ in leaf epidermal characters and their infructescence bracts, which are radially symmetrical and inflated bladder- like in Ostrya and are open and flat in Carpinus. While the close relationship of Carpinus and Ostrya is supported by data, the monophyly of the two genera has remained controversial. Some studies have nested Ostrya within Carpinus between sections Carpinus and Distegocarpus on the basis of ITS data or placed Ostrya as a basal grade to the Carpinus clade on the basis of chloroplast DNA data.

It is now a neighbourhood within the Fort McMurray urban service area along the west bank of the Clearwater River, south of the river's confluence with the Athabasca River.  History  In 1921, Waterways became a major shipping hub when the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway reached the town, making it the northernmost point on the North American railroad grid. Cargo for destinations farther north was shipped to Waterways and then transferred to barges, after which fleets of tugboats took them to destinations in the Mackenzie River watershed. In 1930, Dr. Karl A. Clark shipped a plant designed to separate bitumen from the Athabasca oil sands to Waterways and set it up nearby across the Clearwater River. Since that time, the rail line to Waterways has played an important role in transporting heavy equipment and supplies needed for the development of the oil sands and the accompanying growth of the surrounding communities. In 1933, Waterways gave its name to the Waterways Formation, a sequence of limestones and calcareous shales that outcrops along the Clearwater and Athabasca Rivers near the town.Glass, D.J.

Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, Calgary, 1423 p. on CD-ROM. . Waterways in 1939 In 1937, a salt plant was built at Waterways to recover rock salt from the subsurface by solution mining and evaporation. The salt was part of the Prairie Evaporite Formation, which was about thick and lay at a depth of about at that location. The plant operated until 1950, producing 228,000 tons (206,838 tonnes) of salt.Hamilton, W.N. 1971. Salt in east-central Alberta. Alberta Research Council, Bulletin 29, p. 34. Waterways was an important, transfer point for pitchblende ore during WWII. The ore was mined at Eldorado Mine, then shipped by barges to Waterways, where it was transferred to rail cars for shipping onwards to Port Hope, Ontario. The whole operation was all a top secret uranium source for the Manhattan Project. An unwanted legacy was nuclear contamination of soils around Waterways, which were much later cleaned up. https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/ICEM/proceedings- abstract/ICEM2011/54983/1115/355347 https://www.llrwmo.org/en/programs/historic/Fort_McMurray.html In 1964, shipping from Waterways to the Mackenzie River region ceased after Hay River, on Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories, became the northern terminus of the rail grid. Local shipping from Waterways continued, however, and the rail line to Waterways eventually became part of the Northern Alberta Railway, the Canadian National Railway, and then the Athabasca Northern Railway, and finally back to the CNR. During the 2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire, Waterways was critically damaged.

The album was released on May 7, 2012 by Roadrunner Records. Background Having worked with each other in the past, Åkerfeldt and Wilson decided to start work on a collaboration, on an intermittent basis, in March 2010. Wilson later said that only \\"15-20%\\" of the album would have drums on it, performed by Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison. The album was completed in September 2011, but held back for an April 23, 2012 release so that Wilson could concentrate on releasing and promoting his second solo album, Grace for Drowning, and Åkerfeldt could concentrate on Opeth's tenth studio album Heritage, both albums being released in September 2011 themselves. Wilson said of the project: > Because I think we both had this idea of this kind of music that we knew we > couldn't get our bands to play, but that we both kind of understood where we > were coming from. 'Cause we have this kind of passion: very experimental, > obscure records, almost orchestral in their scope. And we wanted to make a > record like that for a long time. It's a long way from metal and it's a long > way from anything that, I think, Mikael has ever done, including [Opeth's] > Damnation record. I think a lot of people thought, 'Oh, it's gonna be like > Damnation.' It's not; it's a long way from that, too. And it's actually a > long way from anything I've done…The one thing we didn't wanna do is get > together and do a prog-metal supergroup, which would have been so easy to do > - and kind of expected, in a way. And, you know, we might do that anyway one > day. But this time around, we thought, 'Let's just do this record.' Some > people will love it and some people will not, and that's OK, because, in a > way, I don't think we wanted to just give what was expected, and we're > certainly not doing that. Wilson also said that on the album, Åkerfeldt did most of the guitar work, while Wilson concentrated on the keyboard parts and arranging the music. He described it as containing a lot of orchestral parts, and as \\"mellow, strange, and disturbing\\". Reception and sales The album has received generally positive reviews, with many reviewers concluding that, while the album was very different from either of the two contributor's other bands, the album was still good by its own merits. Allmusic gave it a 3.5 out of 5, concluding that the album's worth may vary depending on the listener's expectations, stating \\"Given the nature of their earlier collaborations, fans diving into Storm Corrosion expecting a sequel to Blackwater Park are going to be disappointed as they unexpectedly hit the shallow end of the pool, but even though the album doesn't sound much like the metal masterpiece, that doesn't make it unworthy of a listener's attention, and anyone open-minded enough to approach the project without any expectations will be quickly swept off into the spacious perennial twilight created by these two master craftsmen.\\" Revolver gave it an identical 3.5 out of 5 score for similar reasons, stating: \\"Many Opeth and Porcupine Tree fans may be disappointed with the lack of heavy riffage, but those with open minds will find much to enjoy in this dense, atmospheric album.\\" The BBC praised the album as a \\"magnificently retro album\\", comparing it favorably to \\"drug-fuelled experimental avant-gardism of the 70s\\". The Guardian gave the album a 4 out of 5, stating the album \\"...could confound and irritate as many as they enchant, but as an immersive journey into uncharted territory, Storm Corrosion is an unequivocal triumph\\". Other reviewers were less enthusiastic to the album's sound, with Powerline magazine giving the album a 1.5 out of 5 rating, calling it a \\"silly, self- indulgent, meandering 48 minutes of uninspired progressive noodling, and one that deserves to be quickly forgotten by fans of either founding musician\\". The album debuted at number 86 on the Canadian Albums Chart.http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Charts/ALBUMS.html The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Surround Sound Album.

Abend is considered to be one of Venezuela's contemporary masters of sculpture. Harry Abend (Jaroslaw, Poland, 1937) immigrated to Venezuela in 1948 and embarked on his sculpture practice in 1958 under the guidance of Miguel Arroyo while also studying architecture at the Universidad Central de Venezuela. In 1963, at the age of 26, Abend received the National Sculpture Prize of Venezuela for his work \\"Forma\\" 1961. In 1964, he participated in a three-month workshop led by British sculptor Kenneth Armitage. In 1976 Abend moved to London where he continued developing his work and exhibited in galleries such as the Roundhouse Gallery and the Hayward Gallery. Around this time Abend began to receive commissions to stage interventions in urban and architectural environments, such as the cement mural on the façade of the Teatro Teresa Carreño, and the interior design of the Sala Plenaria in the east tower of Parque Central, both in Caracas. A selection of his solo shows include Esculturas, Museo de Arte Moderno, Río de Janeiro (1968); three exhibitions at Sala Mendoza, Caracas (1973, 1980 and 1995); Electrum Gallery, London (1977); Saint James Piccadilly Festival, London (1981); a retrospective at the Museo de Arte Moderno Jesús Soto, Ciudad Bolívar (2002); Museo de Arte Acarigua Araure, Acarigua (2003); Museo Kern Unión Israelita de Caracas (2012); Galería GBG ARTS, Caracas and Henrique Faria, New York (both 2014). He lives and works in Caracas.  Work  Heichal of the synagogue, designed by Harry Abend. Between 1965 and 1970, Abend was the professor of tridimensional composition at the Neumann Institute of Design, where other renowned artists such as Gego, Gerd Leufert, Nedo, Manuel Quintana Castillo, Guillermo Meneses, and Luisa Zuloaga de Palacios taught similar courses. He established himself in London for six years, then returned to Caracas to continue his artistic work. In the next following decades, his style developed and matured as he engaged in numerous projects, installations, art exhibitions and collectives. Abend's sculptures are done mainly in wood, bronze, and concrete; he is also known for designing high-scale architectural elements of important buildings, such as the façade of the Teatro Teresa Carreño, the ceiling of the Caracas Israeli Union synagogue, and the new perimeter fence of the Court of Supreme Justice in Venezuela. Abend is a skilled engraver and illustrator; he also engages in jewelry making, working primarily with gold, silver and precious gems. The elegant nature of his jewels is such that he was commissioned by the Venezuelan Government several times to craft pieces as gifts for important diplomatic personalities (e.g., he produced a complete jewelry set for Patricia Nixon while she was the First Lady of the United States). His first solo exhibition (Museo de Bellas Artes, Caracas, 1962) included fused bronze pieces of polished surfaces and wooden sculptures. The works from one of his first series, Formas, earned him the Premio Nacional de Escultura (1963). Abend participated in the Taller de Quebrada Honda, organized on the occasion of British sculptor Kenneth Armitage's visit, and the works produced during the workshop were shown at the exhibition Kenneth Armitage and Eight Venezuelan Sculptors (Museo de Bellas Artes, 1964). By that time, he had abandoned polished surfaces and made, for his second solo exhibition (Museo de Bellas Artes, 1965), bronze reliefs of abrupt geometric volumes and works influenced by Informalismo, in which his interest in the medium prevailed. After this phase, Abend adhered to geometric constructivism, through which he developed reliefs integrated with architecture, as seen in several buildings in Caracas, including the Sinagoga de la Unión Israelita (1969), the Hotel Caracas Hilton (today Hotel Alba, 1973), the Sala Plenaria de Parque Central (1974), the Sinagoga de la Asociación Beth-El (1974–1975), and the Teatro Teresa Carreño (1980–1982). A selection of similar works, of smaller scale and made out of concrete, was displayed at the Sala Mendoza (Caracas, 1973). Between 1976 and 1982, Abend resided in London. Wood become his favored medium. He created different types of constructive-geometric assemblages, some by means of thick strips whose structural severity contrasted with their irregular reliefs, others combining small pieces arrayed in a rigorous and, at the same time, delicate order, and presented them in the exhibition Puertas, ventanas y relieves at the Sala Mendoza (1980). After returning to Venezuela in the mid 1980s, Abend's work took on an organic character. At the outset, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic forms were suggested through wood pieces. Soon thereafter, the medium of wood and sculpting, as process, become the dynamic elements of his work. His large pieces looked like totems constructed of ovoid volumes with clear textures and placed on columns or beams that created the appearance of a megalith. These works were shown for the first time in the Museo de Bellas Artes (1989). In later pieces, Abend used wood from trunks of trees that had been cut to make space for urban expansion. He cut these in cylindrical sections. He also recovered the trees' bark. These works, gathered in sculpture sets, were displayed at the Galería de Arte Nacional (Caracas, 1992) and the Sala Mendoza (1995). He also produced is a series of conceptual works in which he placed leftover shavings of his woodwork in boxes, giving birth to a sort of \\"esculturas en negativo\\" (sculptures in negative).http://www.jcmac.art/artists/abend-harry/  Exhibitions  Abend has exhibited in numerous galleries, museums and art events around the world, some of which are: * Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. * Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro. * Museum of Fine Arts, Venezuela. * Museo Alejandro Otero, Venezuela. * Jesus Soto Museum of Modern Art, Ciudad Bolivar. * Museum of Contemporary Art Sofia Imber. * National Art Gallery of Venezuela. * Museum of Contemporary Art Francisco Narvaez, Porlamar, Nueva Sparta. * Museum of Contemporary Art of Zulia. * Biennial of Guayana. * São Paulo Biennial. * Salon D'Empaire, Maracaibo (Shell Award winner for sculpture). * Henrique Faria Fine Art, New York. * Goldsmith's Hall, London. * Electrum Gallery, London. * Roundhouse Gallery, London. * Trasnocho Cultural Center. * Jewelry Showcase: The Work of Harry Abend, Milwaukee. * Kleinplastik Exhibition, Madurodam, The Hague (Prize winner).http://200.74.197.135/BLANKSITE/c3/colecarte/abend_index.htm http://my.execpc.com/~regent/WCM121004.pdfhttp://arteenlared.com/venezuela/fia-2009/harry- abend-es-el-artista-homenajeado-en- fia2009-2.htmlhttp://www.fmn.gob.ve/fmn_dav_G.htm  Recognitions  His life's work, which spans over fifty years, has been exemplified in projects of varying nature and importance. His career as a sculptor started at an early age; in 1963, when he was only 26, he was awarded the prestigious Venezuelan National Award in Sculpture (Premio Nacional de Escultura) for the work \\"Forma 1961\\". Later in his career, he was awarded the Order of Francisco de Miranda, First Class, in 1990. He was shown homage by the Latin American Art Fair (Feria de Arte Latinoamericana), in 2009.

In practice, it acts as a mechanism of the cooperative principle in which both parties to the conversation employ lexical entrainment as a progressive system to develop \\"conceptual pacts\\" (a working temporary conversational terminology) to ensure maximum clarity of reference in the communication between the parties; this process is necessary to overcome the ambiguity inherent in the multitude of synonyms that exist in language. Lexical entrainment arises by two cooperative mechanisms: * Embedded corrections – a reference to the object implied by the context of the sentence, but with no explicit reference to the change in terminology * Exposed corrections – an explicit reference to the change in terminology, possibly including a request to assign the referent a common term (e.g., \\"by 'girl', do you mean 'Jane'?\\") Violation of Grice's maxim of quantity Once lexical entrainment has come to determine the phrasing for a referent, both parties will use that terminology for the referent for the duration, even if it proceeds to violate the Gricean maxim of quantity. For example, if one wants to refer to a brown loafer out of a set of shoes that consist of: the loafer, a sneaker, and a high-heeled shoe, they will not use the shoe to describe the object as this phrasing does not unambiguously describe one item in the set under consideration. They will also not call the object the brown loafer which would violate Grice's maxim of quantity. The speaker will settle on using the term the loafer as it is just informative enough without giving too much information. Another important factor is lexical availability; the ease of conceptualizing a referent in a certain way and then retrieving and producing a label for it. For many objects the most available labels are basic nouns; for example, the word \\"dog\\". Instead of saying animal or husky for the referent, most subjects will default to dog. If in a set of objects one is to refer to either a husky, a table, and a poster, people are still most likely to use the word \\"dog.\\" This is technically a violation of Grice's maxim of quantity, as using the term animal is ideal. Applications Lexical entrainment has applications in natural language processing in computers as well as human–human interaction. Currently, the adaptability of computers to modify their referencing to the terms of their human interlocutor is limited, so the entrainment adaptation falls to the human operator; this phenomenon is readily demonstrated in Brennan's 1996 experiment.

Background In the wake of the failed Union Camden Expedition, areas of Arkansas lay prone to Confederate raids against Union outposts.Civil War Timeline – Encyclopedia of Arkansas One such raid occurred against a Union camp at Massard Prairie on July 27, 1864. Confederate General Richard Gano won a victory there, which encouraged further operations.Civil War at Fort Smith AR Battle Several days later Gano's superior, General Douglas H. Cooper, led a Confederate division several miles north to Fort Smith. Cooper's force consisted of Gano's brigade and General Stand Watie's brigade. Gano took position along the Indian Territory side of the Poteau River while Watie moved up from the south on the Arkansas side. General John M. Thayer commanded the town's defenses with three brigades. Watie's men made first contact with the 6th Kansas Cavalry of Colonel William R. Judson's Union brigade. Judson's men fell back from Fort No. 2 along the Texas Road, alerting the rest of the Union garrison of the Confederate arrival.Action at Fort Smith Cooper's men began to shell the fort. Thayer responded by sending forward units from Colonel James M. Williams' brigade, including the 6th Kansas Colored Infantry and two howitzers from the 2nd Kansas Battery. The Union artillery proved superior and soon drove off the Confederate artillery and the supporting cavalry. Cooper ordered a withdrawal, leaving snipers behind to cover the retreat.Battle of Fort Smith, Arkansas Aftermath Cooper took with him approximately $130,000 worth of Union arms and supplies.

He also was the author of the book The Princely India I Knew, from Reading to Mountbatten. Early life and wartime service Corfield was born on 15 August 1893, the son of the Rev. Egerton Corfield, a Church of England missionary and later rector of Finchampstead, Berkshire, in England. He was educated at St. Lawrence College, Ramsgate, where he would later serve as a member of the governing body. On 8 October 1914, Corfield was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 1st Cambridgeshire Regiment. During the First World War, he saw active service on the Western Front. He was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant on 16 March 1915 (antedated and made substantive from the same date on 4 August 1916), and promoted to the temporary rank of captain on 17 June 1915 (pay and allowances from 12 January 1916). As a lieutenant (temporary captain), he was decorated with the Military Cross (MC) on 16 November 1916: Corfield was subsequently appointed the adjutant of his battalion, and was promoted to the substantive rank of captain on 29 August 1917 (precedence from 1 June 1916). He relinquished his commission on 1 September 1921. Civil service career In 1920 Corfield joined a batch of recruits into the Indian Civil Service. After initial training in the Punjab, in May 1921 Corfield was posted to New Delhi to serve as assistant private secretary to the Viceroy, Lord Reading. After holding this position for eighteen months, he was posted back to the Punjab for district work. In 1925 he was selected to join the Foreign and Political Department of the government of India, and his first appointment was that of Secretary to the Agent for the Western India States Agency. He was later transferred to the North West Frontier Province as Assistant to the Political Agent in Kalat. At the end of 1928, he was transferred in the same capacity to the Rajputana Agency. Three years later, he was placed in charge of the Political Agency in the Southern States of Central India and Malawa, but was quickly transferred again to Hyderabad State to serve as Secretary to the Resident in the Nizam's Dominions. In the Spring of 1932 he was posted to Rewa to handle administrative issues in the State and was made Vice-President of the State Council. At the close of 1932 he returned to the England to serve as Adviser to the Delegation of Rewa at the third session of the Indian Round Table Conference. In 1934, Corfield was appointed Joint Secretary of the Foreign and Political Department, serving first under Lord Willingdon and later under Lord Linlithgow. In 1938 he became Resident in Jaipur, and then in 1940 transferred to the Punjab States in the same capacity. In 1945 Corfield was called up to become Political Adviser to the Crown Representative, Lord Wavell. In this role, Corfield was the official link between the Viceroy and the Princes of India. When Wavell was called back to England in the Spring of 1947, and Mountbatten was installed as Viceroy, Corfield continued as the new Viceroy's Political Adviser to the Crown Representatives. Corfield remained in India until the British transfer of power to the governments of Nehru and Jinnah was completed in August of that year. Views on India Corfield was concerned about the rights of the princes in the independent India. He asserted that the princely states should be allowed to remain independent if they chose to do so. He also sought and received the permission of the British government to destroy the records that had been collected concerning the princes' personal lives. He felt these records could be used by the new government of India as blackmail against the princes. Personal life Conrad Corfield (middle) and wife Sylvia in 1971 at the wedding of June Corfield's first son. Corfield firstly married Phyllis Betha Pugh, the daughter of L. P. E. Pugh, KC on 22 December 1922. The couple had one daughter and a son. After his first wife died in 1932, Corfield remained a widower for several decades until marrying Sylvia Phyllis Mary Hadow, the widow of Lt. Col. Charles O'Brian Daunt, on 16 September 1961.

It aired on January 2, 2012. Plot On New Year's Day, Marshall visits his father's gravesite to carry on their tradition of tailgating, listening to the Bears vs. Vikings game on the radio. However, his attempts to have a private moment with his father are derailed when his brothers arrive with the same idea and then mourners at another funeral nearby gradually drift over and join Marshall's tailgating party. Nevertheless, Marshall tells the story at his father's grave of how he, Lily, Ted, Barney and Robin spent New Year's Eve. Prior to the cemetery scene, this is what the five are doing: Lily and Marshall are decorating the baby's bedroom in East Meadow when Marshall learns that Lily has not yet told her dad that she is pregnant. Marshall convinces her to call her father, who is in Chicago at a board-game convention, but Lily is disappointed with her father's nonchalant reaction. Next, Marshall decides to narrate his favourite childhood book \\"Enigmas of the Mystical\\", but Lily admits she cannot believe any of the stories. Realizing that Lily is upset, Marshall apologizes and explains he acted that way because his dad made him believe in the magical. Lily reveals that her dad taught her not to believe in anything but herself. In the meantime, Ted and Barney turn Ted's apartment into an impromptu bar, calling it \\"Puzzles\\", after becoming frustrated with how difficult it is to get to MacLaren's during the New Year's Eve crush. They recruit Kevin to operate the bar, and Doug (the MacLaren's bouncer) as bouncer. They initially plan on providing drinks at reasonable prices, but are eventually forced to increase the price when they have trouble managing the rowdy patrons, who eventually all leave. Robin is called into work on New Year's Eve because Sandy Rivers, the TV anchor, begins drinking on air when the female producer for World Wide News breaks up with him. He then disappears entirely. Robin struggles to get Sandy back on air, but close to midnight he disappears again. She calls Kevin in despair, who convinces her to take Sandy's place, even though he later finds a comatose Sandy in Ted's bathtub. Robin takes his advice and Kevin, Ted, and Barney watch Robin as she anchors the New Year's Eve broadcast. Future Ted reveals that this became the turning point in Robin's career, gaining her a promotion to Sandy's co-host. By the time Marshall has finished his story, there are many people with him, with Marshall increasingly annoyed at those trying to take advantage of the game and his food. When Marshall is on his last nerve, someone accidentally calls him Marvin, his father's name, saying Marshall is just like his dad. Marshall then recalls how his father always welcomed people at all their previous tailgate parties, and asks his brothers to join him, deciding that private moments are overrated. In East Meadow, Lily opens the door to her house and unexpectedly finds her father with a giant teddy bear. He reveals that right after he heard her news, he drove all night from Chicago to see her and tells her how excited he is for her. A tear-struck Lily thanks her father and hugs him.

The following year he joined Berwyn Rangers of Llangollen, where he played for two years before moving to Druids in 1881. In 1882, he was a member of the Druids team which won the Welsh Cup with a 5–0 victory over Northwich Victoria (two goals each from Charles Ketley and Edward Bowen). In 1882–83, Druids had their best run in the FA Cup. After victories over Oswestry Town and Northwich Victoria in the first two rounds, they were drawn against Bolton Wanderers. After two draws, the clubs met for a second replay at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground on 29 January 1883; a single goal from Jack Vaughan was sufficient to see the Druids through. They then defeated another Bolton-based club, Eagley, before being defeated 4–1 on 24 February 1883 at Blackburn Olympic, who went on to win the trophy a month later. His international debut came on 3 February 1883, when he was one of four Druids players selected to play (as a forward) against England at the Kennington Oval, London. The England selectors had chosen an \\"attacking side\\" in an attempt to avenge defeats by Wales in the two previous meetings, resulting in a comfortable 5–0 victory for the English, with Clement Mitchell scoring a hat-trick. Davies' second cap came as a half back on 17 March in a 1–1 draw with Ireland. His international appearances were summed up by the Football Association of Wales as \\"useful but not very ornamental\\". In September 1883, he was a guest player for Wrexham when they staged the first match under floodlights in North Wales (against Oswestry) at their Grosvenor Road ground. He left the Druids in 1884 and over the next eight years he made appearances for five clubs. Family He was brother-in-law to fellow Welsh international, Bob Roberts.

Common names include crystal, galaxy, starburst and tooth coral. They are abundant on reefs in the Indo-Pacific region and the Red Sea.Family Oculinidae: Galaxea Horizon. Retrieved 2011-12-16. They are found in water less than deep and favour turbid sites. They are sometimes kept in reef aquaria.Galaxea Tidal Gardens. Retrieved 2011-12-16. Description The colonies of Galaxea have various forms according to species. G. fascicularis forms long, thin columns and is one of the largest corals known. G. paucisepta and G. longisepta form flat plates, G. acrhelia is arborescent and other species form domes and rounded mounds. Their colours are mostly olives or browns but they are often tinged with purple. The corallites in which the individual polyps sit are small and crowded and have raised edges or may even be stalked. There are a large number of fine septa on the edge of the corallites, arranged in whorls and protruding as sharp ridges. The polyps contain symbiotic protists called zooxanthellae and grow in shallow water to maximise the uptake of sunlight. They often feed in the day, extending yellowish or greenish, often white tipped tentacles. They have certain specialised sweeper tentacles, long defensive organs, tipped with powerful cnidocytes which discourage other corals from living close by.

It was believed to have taken its name from the mythical Cynurus. Location and history Herodotus regarded the Cynurians as autochthones, but at the same time called them Ionians.Herod. viii. 73 There can be little doubt, however, that they were Pelasgians; but in consequence of their maritime position, they were regarded as a different race from the Arcadian Pelasgians, and came to be looked upon as Ionians, which was the case with the Pelasgians dwelling upon the coast of the Corinthian gulf, in the district afterwards called Achaia. They were a semi-barbarous and predatory tribe, dwelling chiefly in the eastern slopes of Mount Parnon; but their exact boundaries cannot be defined, as they were only a tribe, and never formed a political body. At a later time they were almost confined to the Thyreatis, or district of Thyrea. Originally they extended much further south. Upon the conquest of Peloponnesus by the Dorians, the Cynurians were subdued by the Argeians, whose territory at one time extended along the eastern coast of Peloponnesus down to Cape Malea.Herod. i. 82. The Cynurians were now reduced to the condition of Argive Perioeci.Herod. viii. 73. They continued as subjects of Argos for some time; but as Sparta rose in power, she endeavoured to increase her territory at the expense of Argos; and Cynuria, but more especially the fertile district of the Thyreatis, was a frequent subject of contention between the two states, and was in possession sometimes of the one, and sometimes of the other power. As early as the reign of Echestratus, the son of Agis, who is placed about 1000 BCE, the Spartans are said to have gained possession of Cynuria,Paus. iii. 2. § 2 but they were driven out of it subsequently, and it continued in the hands of the Argives till about 547 BCE, when the celebrated battle was fought between the 300 champions from either nation.Herod. i. 82 But the great victory of Cleomenes over the Argives near Tiryns, shortly before the Persian wars, was the event which secured to the Spartans undisputed possession of Cynuria for a long time. When the Aeginetans were expelled from their own island by the Athenians, at the commencement of the Peloponnesian War (431 BCE), the Spartans allowed them to settle in the Thyreatis, which at that time contained two towns, Thyrea and Anthene or Athene, both of which were made over to the fugitives.Thuc. ii. 27. Here they maintained themselves till the 8th year of the Peloponnesian war, when the Athenians made a descent upon the coast of the Thyreatis, where they found the Aeginetans engaged in building a fortress upon the sea. This was forthwith abandoned by the latter, who took refuge in the upper city (ἡ ἄνω πόλις) at the distance of 10 stadia from the sea; but the Athenians followed them, took Thyrea, which they destroyed, and dragged away the inhabitants into slavery.Thuc. iv. 56, 57. Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, gave back the Thyreatis to the Argives, and extended their territory along the coast as far as Glympeis and Zarax.Manso, Sparta, vol. iii. pt. i. p. 245; comp. Polyb. iv. 36. § 5, v. 20. § 4. It continued to belong to the Argives in the time of Pausanias;Paus. ii. 38. § 5. but even then the ancient boundary quarrels between the Argives and Spartans still continued.Paus. vii. 11. § 1. Among the populated places noted by the ancient writers were: Thyrea, Anthene, Neris, and Eva. Province The province of Kynouria () was one of the provinces of the Arcadia prefecture. The province, established in the 19th century, covered only the northern half of the ancient region of Cynuria. It was abolished in 2006, and following the 2011 Kallikratis reform, its territory is occupied by the municipalities of North Kynouria and South Kynouria.

He lived for a time in London, then returned to Australia in the 1950s and went to work for American-born Australian radio producer Grace Gibson, working on most of her dramas, particularly Portia Faces Life. When television arrived in Australia, Gibson combatted it by making five-minute dramas, and Napier was one of her main writers of these until the 1970s.Richard Lane, The Golden Age of Australian Radio Drama 1923–1960, Melbourne University Press, 1994 p275 Early life Born in Sydney in 1929, Ross Napier began writing short stories for magazines while still in high school, selling his first script at 17. Shortly after, he became a staff writer for Grace Gibson Radio Productions, and during the 1950s and 1960s his radio serials were broadcast Australia-wide and internationally. This firmly established him as one of Australia's leading drama writers. Whilst at Gibson's Ross met Ann Fuller, then a script typist, and they married in 1953. Career Over the course of his career, he spent much of his time in television, notably as script editor of the classic Australian series Skippy, for which he wrote most episodes. Skippy was sold to 128 countries, dubbed into 25 languages and watched by a global audience of over 300 million viewers. Ross was also a script editor and regular writer on the ground- breaking Number 96, and head writer/script editor of The Restless Years, another TV ratings winner. In 1982, he came up with a new format for radio called The Castlereagh Line, which can be best described as Poldark meets Outlander set in Colonial Australia. Originally contracted for 65 episodes, it ran for 910 and was aired by more stations than any Australian serial ever. At a time when radio drama had long been put out to pasture, 2WS saw its potential. The program was so popular that factories downed tools to enable the staff to listen to it. According to an article in The Sydney Morning Herald in 1984 \\"Devotees are continually ringing the station to find out what will happen in the next three weeks as they have to know, or they can’t go on holiday\\". The radio serial has been re-run nationally several times over and continues to run to this day. Ross loved the Castlereagh project. He and wife Ann researched all the locations where the story took place, driving around Tamworth and Glen Innes and visiting all the old coaching stations. During the course of ‘The Line's’ initial broadcast from 1982 to 1986, Ross wrote the first three Castlereagh novels: The Castlereagh Line, The Castlereagh Way and The Colours of Castlereagh. The books were sold in all major and most independent bookstores nationally, including Angus & Robertson, Dymocks and Collins, with 'Line' and 'Way' going into reprint due to popular demand. Over the next few years came four more Castlereagh novels: The Castlereagh Heritage, The Castlereagh Rose, The Castlereagh Crown and The Castlereagh Cross. The never-before-published grand finale, The Castlereagh Requiem, was drafted before Ross died in 2004.

It was proposed that they should elect a member to represent \\"Tenterden\\" (a slang name for the prison) in Parliament. Three candidates were put up, one of whom was Lieutenant Meredith, an eccentric naval officer. All the characteristics of a regular election were parodied. Addresses from the candidates to the 'worthy and independent electors' were printed and posted up around the prison; contending parties wrote broadsheets & sang songs attacking their opponents; there were processions with flags and music, to take the several candidates to visit the several \\"Collegians\\" (i. e., prisoners) in their rooms; speeches were made in the courtyards, full of grotesque humour; a pseudo \\"high-sheriff\\" and other \\"election officers\\" were chosen to oversee the proceedings \\"properly\\"; and the electors were invited to \\"rush to the poll\\" early on Monday morning, the 16th of July. The turnkeys (guards) of the prison entered into the fun. While these preliminary plans were engaging attention, a creditor happened to enter the prison; and seeing the prisoners so exceedingly joyous, declared that such a kind of imprisonment for debt could be no punishment; and he therefore liberated his debtor. Whether owing to this singular result of prison-discipline (or indiscipline), or an apprehension of evils that might follow, Mr. Jones, marshal of the prison, put a stop to the whole proceedings on the morning of the 16th. Apparently the proceedings were halted violently, exasperating the prisoners. They resented the language used towards them, and opposed the treatment to which they were subjected; until a squad of Foot-guards, with fixed bayonets, forcibly drove some of the leaders into a filthy \\"black-hole\\" or place of confinement. The election occurred while Benjamin Haydon was in prison for the second time. He produced the picture of the Mock Election, and sold it to King George IV for £500.

Published by Verlag Robert Gessler, Friedrichshafen, 2005, p. 17 Berthold Müller – he himself added Oerlinghausen to his name later – began his studies of sculpture under Hans Perathoner at the Bielefeld College of Arts and Crafts in 1910 while still a schoolboy. Completing his grammar school education in the classical humanities in Bielefeld in 1912, he moved to Berlin in 1914 and studied at the Charlottenburg School of Applied Arts. During the First World War he was conscripted for service with cavalry regiments in Russia, Galicia and France. In 1919 he was able to continue his interrupted studies in Berlin under Hans Perathoner and Willy Jäckel. In 1922, together with his wife, Jenny Wiegmann, he converted to Catholicism at the Abbey of Maria Laach. During the 1920s he devoted himself to religious art: commissions for sculptures on church buildings, participation in the “Exhibition of Religious Art” at the Ernst Arnold Gallery in Dresden and in the Vatican Mission Exhibition in the Holy Year of 1925 with his large sculpture “Pope Gregory the Great”. In 1929 he took part in the annual exhibition of the Berlin Secession and, in 1931, in the exhibitions of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. It was also in 1931 that he and his wife Jenny separated. Two years later, in 1933, he married Emily Sturm. In that same year he organized, and took part in, the Catholic section of the Exhibition of Ecclesiastical Art during the World’s Fair in Chicago. From then on he spent the summer months mainly in Kressbronn on Lake Constance. In 1936 he founded a mosaic workshop in Berlin and, on 7 March of that same year, his son Bruno was born. He finally moved for long term to Kressbronn in 1940. His studio, mosaic workshop and apartment in Berlin were destroyed in an air raid in 1944. After 1945 Berthold Müller-Oerlinghausen made important contributions to a revival of the cultural life of the communities on Lake Constance: the rebuilding of his mosaic workshop in Kressbronn in 1946, exhibitions in the Municipal Museum of Lindau, the founding in 1947 of the “Upper Swabian Secession” (renamed “Secession of Upper Swabia/Lake Constance” in 1950), the founding of the “Artists’ Society of the Town and District of Lindau” (renamed “Lindau Art Patrons’ Society” in 1956), solo exhibitions at the Wessenberghaus in Constance and elsewhere, a retrospective exhibition at the Municipal Museum of Lindau in 1963 marking his 70th birthday.

After his graduation from art school in Yogyakarta, he went to China to study Mandarin and Chinese dramatic traditions. In 1971, Kuslan moved to Moscow to study Russian. He died on 6 December 2018 aged 83 from pancreatic cancer. In 1961, in Yogyakarta, Kuslan and Amrus Natalsya, Misbach Tamrin, Ng Sembiring, Isa Hasanda, Hardjija Pudjanadi, Harmani, Haryanto, etc. founded Sanggar Bumi Tarung: SBT (Battleground Studio), a visual art collective. SBT members were considered \\"leftists\\" because of their affiliation with the Indonesian Artists Association (Lembaga Senirupa Indonesia), an art body supported by the People's Cultural Association (Lembaga Kebudayaan Rakyat: LEKRA), the cultural arm of the Indonesian Communist Party (Partai Komunis Indonesia: PKI). As other Lekra members in 1950s and 1960s, Kulan also participated in the TURBA program. TURBA is an acronym for 'turun ke bawah', meaning 'descend from above'. Part of the goals of the program was to transform urbanised leftists by introducing them to village life to experience the physical deprivations and psychological hardships. Kuslan and fellow Lekra artist Mawie Ananta Yonie later recollected that the class differences between people of the urban and rural village were magnified on the physical level. For example, it was difficult for these young urban youths to see village farmers to defecate unsanitarily in the river, or watching the ritual of prostitution called tayuban for \\"boys become men\\". At the same time, many Lekra members were tired of the labor after a few days. Kuslan recalled that 'Our bodies were not suited to that kind of work,...our muscles were not developed, our hands were not properly callused.' In retrospect, it is hard to conclude if the TURBA program was a success or whether the program achieved all primary goals; however, Lekra members' village experiences forced them to confront their class-based prejudices in a transformative way. After Suharto's rise to power in 1965, as a result of his New Order regime's effort to purge communism, members of SBT became a clear target and were eventually arrested, imprisoned without trial, killed, disappeared, or in the case of Kuslan, his original brief stay in China for study became unintended exile. During Kuslan's exile, he and his comrades kept the Indonesian students and exiles in touch with each other and encouraged them to express their concerns about Indonesia. Kuslan's published writings can be found in Indonesian's exile journals. However, with the help of the internet, Kuslan's work has since been disseminated digitally as well.

It is located across the street from Sorgenfri Palace, where Lyngby Main Street meets Lyngby Kongevej. The house takes its name after Frederik Casper Conrad Frieboe who is buried in the grounds together with his wife and a few other family members. Its most notable former resident is Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz who played an important part in the Rescue of the Danish Jews during World War II. The house now serves as a historic house museum showing how Copenhagen peers decorated their country homes in the late 18th century. It hosts a permanent and special exhibitions about local history as well as the local historic archives for Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality. History F. C. C. Frieboe from whom the house now takes its name The house was built from 1756 to 1758 owned by August Günther, a chemist from Copenhagen, and was originally known as Vildnisset (en. The Wilderness). The architect is not known. In 1782 the property was acquired by the wealthy shipping agent Andreas Bodenhoff. His daughter Gjertrud Cathrine inherited it in 1794 and after she married rittmeister and later General Frederik Caspar Conrad Frieboe, it was passed on to him. Georg and Agnete Bruhn Frieboe had no legitimate children. His testament gave the house its current name and converted the estate into Denmark's smallest fideicommissum. The next resident was his sister's son, Lieutenant Colonel F. C. C. Funch. In 1919 the house came into ordinary ownership when the Lensafløsningsloven Act dissolved all Fideicommia. On the same occasion, the house was listed in 1919. The last member of the Funch family to live in the house was Agnete Bruhn, F.C.C. Funch's daughter. Her husband was Georg Bruhn who worked for Bank of Denmark. Georg Bruhn (left) and Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz /middle( viewed on the yard in front of Frieboeshvile in 1947 Frieboueshvile's stables, on the side wing, was converted in 1923 into a separate residence and rented out. In 1941, during the German Occupation of Denmark in World War II, it was rented out to Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz. On 18 August 1943, Frieboeshvile played host to a meeting between Werner Best and the Danish politicians Hans Hedtoft, H. C. Hansen and Alsing Andersen. Duckwitz served as West Germany's Ambassador to Denmark after the war. Following her husband's death, Agnete Bruhn sold the property to Lyngby- Taarbæk Municipality in 1953 but continued to live there until 1968. Architecture Built in the Baroque style, Frieboeshvile is constructed in brick with white dressing and details in sandstone. It consists of a single storey topped by a black-glazed mansard roof. The roof is not part of the original building but was added in 1977 when the house was restored. The original roof was clad in wooden roof shingles which in 1867 were replaced with slate shingles. The renovation also restored the Neoclassical interiors which date from Friboe's period of ownership. August Günther's initials are found above the main entrance as well as on the first floor. Park Apart from the burial site of General Frieboe and his family, the park also contains a few other features from his day. These include a grotto which originally afforded access to a now collapsed fruit cellar and an aviary converted into a pavilion. Exhibitions Frieboeshvile today serves as a historic house museum showing how the Copenhagen bourgeoisie of the late 18th century decorated their country houses where they would reside throughout the summer. The furniture in the house dates from about 1800. The house also contains a permanent exhibition from the Lyngbt-Taarbæk and plays host to two special exhibitions a year on local historic subjects. Local historic archive The local historic archive for Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality is also based at the house. In the reading room it is possible to study old photographs, maps and historic documents from the area.

See also the Birth certificate of Jean-Vital Jammes. Pougin (18 June 1893) p. 200 and Vapereau (1870) p. 943 give his year of birth as 1827. was a French opera singer. During a stage career spanning 40 years, he created many leading baritone roles, including Zurga in Bizet's Les pêcheurs de perles and Ourrias in Gounod's Mireille. Born in Le Passage d'Agen near the town of Agen, he was largely self-taught and made his stage debut in 1841 at the age of 16. After singing in several provincial theatres, he was engaged by the Théâtre Lyrique in Paris and later by the Opéra-Comique. Following his retirement from the stage, Ismaël lived in Marseille where he died at the age of 68. Biography Early life and career Ismaël was born Jean-Vital Jammes, the son of an illiterate tailor in Le Passage near the town of Agen.In several sources, his name is given as Jean-Vital-Ismaël Jammes, including Fétis and Pougin (1880) p. 13. According to Vapereau (1870) p. 943, his parents were Jewish: \\"de parents Israélites\\". He showed an early interest in singing and as a teenager developed a beautiful baritone voice. However, his family were too poor to afford any kind of music lessons for him, and at the age of sixteen he left home to earn a living as a street singer, working his way on foot to Bordeaux and then Nantes.Fétis and Pougin (1880) pp. 13-14; New York Times (1 July 1893) At Nantes, he was taken on as a chorister at the opera house during the 1842-1843 season and before his 17th birthday achieved local success when he stepped in at the last minute to sing the role of Max in a production of Adam's Le chalet.Destrange, Etienne (1893). He then set off for Paris hoping to further his training as a singer, but he was virtually illiterate and was refused admittance to the Paris Conservatoire. Instead, he taught himself to read and write and took a few singing lessons, although it is not clear who the teacher was. He worked largely on his own to learn the music of the major baritone roles of his day and managed to secure a position singing baritone and bass roles in a small opera house at Verviers in Belgium.Vapereau (1870) p. 943 He soon returned to France and after performing in several small provincial theatres as well as the Opéra de Marseille, where he appeared each season between 1854 and 1860, he was engaged on a permanent contract by the Opéra de Rouen. He appeared there with great success in a series of leading roles between 1862 and 1863 and came to the attention of the impresario Léon Carvalho. On the Paris stage Caricature of Ismaël as Macbeth (1865) In 1862, Ismaël was engaged by Carvalho for his Théâtre Lyrique company in Paris. Ismaël's time with the company marked the peak of his career. His debut on 30 September 1863 was as Zurga in the premiere of Bizet's Les pêcheurs de perles. This was followed by appearances beginning on 24 December in the title role of Verdi's Rigoletto, a new production which was highly successful and established Ismaël as one of the leading singers in the French capital.Kutsch and Riemens (2003) p. 2202; Walsh (1981) p. 317 He also created the role of Ourrias in Gounod's Mireille and sang the title role in Verdi's Macbeth for the premiere of its revised version on 21 April 1865.Walsh (1981) pp. 317, 318 Other roles included the title role in Donizetti's Don Pasquale, Falstaff in Nicolai's The Merry Wives of Windsor,Walsh (1981) pp. 317, 319 and Sganarelle in Gounod's Le médecin malgré lui (1866).Kutsch & Riemens (2003) p. 2202; short review in Le Ménestrel vol. 33, no. 44 (30 September 1866), p. 347: \\"Ismaël avait à effacer d'excellents souvenirs [de Meillet et Sainte-Foy], et c'est double mérité à lui d'avoir réussi dans le rôle de Sganarelle. Il y est bon comédien....\\" Ismaël stayed with the Théâtre Lyrique until Carvalho went bankrupt in 1868. He then sang at the Opéra de Marseille before returning to Paris in 1871 to join the Opéra-Comique at the Salle Favart, where he sang in the premieres of several more operas and operettas including Offenbach's Fantasio and Delibes' Le roi l'a dit as well as the company's first performances of Gounod's Roméo et Juliette (as Frère Laurent) and Le médecin malgré lui (as Sganarelle). Caricature of Ismaël Le Trombinoscope, 1877 Later career In the mid-1870s, vocal problems attributed to laryngitis caused him to retire from the Opéra-Comique.New York Times (1 July 1893); Fétis and Pougin (1880) pp. 13-14 He was appointed Professor of Lyric Declamation (Opera) at the Paris Conservatoire on 1 February 1874, but on 23 December 1876 he was abruptly dismissed from his post without explanation. Ismaël repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, asked for a public investigation into the affair.Pierre (1900) p. 447Fétis and Pougin (1880) pp. 13-14; Heylli (1887) p. 205. Following his dismissal from the conservatoire and the subsequent loss of his salary there, he returned to the stage appearing in comic operas and operettas at the Théâtre du Casino in Monte Carlo and the Théâtre de la Renaissance in Paris until 1880. In 1877, the year in which Ismaël appeared in the premiere of the Strauss operetta La tzigane at the Théâtre de la Renaissance,La tzigane was a pastiche operetta with a French libretto and music from Strauss' Die Fledermaus and Cagliostro in Wien. the satirical revue Le Trombinoscope devoted an entire issue to him with a biography by \\"Touchatout\\" (Léon-Charles Bienvenu). He went on to appear in two more world premieres at the Théâtre de la Renaissance—Lecocq's La jolie persane in 1879 (as Nadir) and Planquette's Les voltigeurs de la 32ème in 1880 (as Richard). Amongst his performances at the Théâtre du Casino in Monte Carlo was the title role in Planquette's Le chevalier Gaston for its world premiere in 1879.Casaglia (2005) Marriage and retirement years Jean-Vital Jammes and Marie Garcin c. 1887 His pupils included Max Bouvet and Jean Delvoye. Ismaël's villa in Marseille Cimetière Saint-Pierre Ismaël married twice, first at the age of 27 to the soprano Alceste Cœuriot (also known by the first name \\"Anaïs\\"). The couple were both singing at the Grand Théâtre de Lyon at the time of their marriage in 1852, after which Alceste appeared under the last name \\"Ismaël\\".In French sources, Cœuriot's voice is described as \\"Dugazon\\", which was used to refer to light voiced singers in the high mezzo- soprano range or sopranos with a dark timbre to their voice. The couple were married on 24 January 1852 in La Guillotière, a commune of Lyon. See Lyon municipal archives. Marriage Register, Commune of La Guillotière, 1852, p. 18. Retrieved 21 February 2012. They continued their careers as a couple – first at Lyon, next at the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux, and finally at the Opéra de Marseille in 1854. However, from 1854 on, their marriage was troubled, and Cœuriot asked for and obtained a separation in 1860 at the expense of Ismaël. As early as the first half of 1856, Cœuriot no longer appeared on the attendance lists of the Opéra de Marseille next to him.Judgment of \\"separation\\" kept in the departmental archives of the Bouches du Rhône. In order to marry one of his students, Ismael requested a divorce as soon as she returned to the jurisdiction of French law ( she could not be served by judicial authorities as she was continuing her career in Belgium). They were officially divorced in 1885 after years of living apart,Divorce did not become legal in France until 1884. and shortly thereafter he married Marie Garcin (1858–1946), a young opera singer who had been one of his pupils. The following year, he brought a lawsuit against his first wife to prevent her from continuing to perform under his last name but was unsuccessful, with the court ruling that Cœuriot won a definitive right to perform as \\"Madam Ismaël\\", which had been her stage name since 1852, while Garcin, the second wife, would then be called \\"Ismaël-Garcin\\".Le Temps, 5 mai 1886, exposé de l’affaire, Le Temps, 26 mai 1886, the civil court's judgement, At the time of the court case (May 1886), and much to the onstage consternation of Alceste, both she and his second wife found themselves singing in the same production of Faust at the Théâtre du Capitole in Toulouse—Alceste Ismaël as Marguerite and Marie Ismaël-Garcin as Marguerite's guardian, Marthe.Rivière (1887) pp. 6-8; Silvestre (1886) p. 213 According to Étienne Destranges, writing in Le Théâtre à Nantes, Marie Ismaël-Garcin had been a singer of great promise and achieved a considerable success in Nantes as Dinorah in Meyerbeer's Le pardon de Ploërmel, but by 1889 her light voice was already in decline.Destranges (1902) pp. 240-241 Ismaël spent the last years of his life with Marie at his villa in Marseille and gave private singing lessons. The villa, which he had bought in 1861, still exists and is situated in the Roucas-Blanc neighborhood on the Traverse Ismaël (named after him). A public staircase, the Escalier du Prophète, leads from the Traverse Ismaël to the beach, Plage du Prophète. According to local newspapers, the staircase and beach took their name from Meyerbeer's opera Le prophète, which Ismaël would often practice on the beach. Jean-Vital Jammes died in Marseille on 13 June 1893 at the age of 68.Pougin (18 June 1893) p. 200 Marie Garcin never remarried and lived in the villa for the rest of her life. She died at her home in 1946 and is buried with her husband in the family tomb at the Cimetière Saint-Pierre in Marseille.The tomb is situated in \\"Carré 17 Est - 4e rang - N° 28 - Concession N° 3 479\\".

These imaging devices enable minimally-invasive surgery. Minimally-invasive surgery is intended to be less traumatic for the patient and minimize incisions on the patient and perform surgery procedure through one or several small cuts. Though imaging has been a standard part of the OR for a long time in the form of mobile C-Arms, ultrasound and endoscopy, these new minimally- invasive procedures require imaging techniques that can visualize smaller body parts such as thin vessels in the heart muscle and can be facilitated through intraoperative 3D imaging.  Clinical applications  Hybrid operating rooms are currently used mainly in cardiac, vascular and neurosurgery, but could be suitable for a number of other surgical disciplines.  Cardiovascular surgery  The repair of diseased heart valves and the surgical treatment of rhythm disturbances and aortic aneurysms can benefit from the imaging capabilities of a hybrid OR. Hybrid Cardiac Surgery is a widespread treatment for these diseases. Also, the shift towards endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms pushed the spread of angiographic systems in vascular OR environments. Particularly for complex endografts, a hybrid operating theater should be a basic requirement. Also, it is well-suited for emergency treatment. Some surgeons do not only verify the placement of complex endografts intraoperatively, they also use their angiography system and the applications it offers for planning the procedure. As anatomy changes between a preoperative CT and intraoperative fluoroscopy because of patient positioning and the insertion of stiff material, a much more precise planning is possible if the surgeon performs an intraoperative rotational angiography, takes an automatic segmentation of the aorta, places markers for the renal arteries and other landmarks in 3D and then overlays the contours on 2D fluoroscopy. This guidance is updated with any change in C-Arm angulation/position or table position.  Neurosurgery  In Neurosurgery, applications for hybrid ORs are for example spinal fusion and intracranial aneurysm coiling. In both cases, they have been rated promising to improve outcomes. For spinal fusion procedures, an integration with a navigation system can further improve the workflow. Intraoperative acquisition of a cone beam computed tomography image can also be used to reconstruct three dimensional CT-like images. This may be useful for the applications above and also for confirmation of targeting for placement of ventricular catheters, biopsies, or deep brain stimulation electrodes. Intra-operative MRI is used to guide brain tumor surgery as well as placement of deep brain stimulation electrodes and interstitial laser thermal therapy.  Thoracic surgery and endobronchial procedures  Procedures to diagnose and treat small pulmonary nodules have also recently been performed in hybrid operating rooms. Interventional image guidance thereby offers the advantage of precisely knowing the position of the nodules, particularly in small or ground-glass opaque tumors, metastases, and/or patients with reduced pulmonary function. This allows for a precise navigation in biopsies, and resection in VATS. Most importantly, using interventional imaging in VATS can substitute for the loss of tactile sensing. This new approach also delivers the potential to spare healthy lung tissue by knowing the exact position of the nodule which increases the quality of life for the patient after the operation. The process for diagnosis and treatment usually comprises 3 steps: # Detection of nodules on CT or chest X-ray # Biopsy of nodule to evaluate malignancy # If necessary, treatment of nodule through surgery/ radiotherapy/ chemotherapy (curative approach) or through chemoembolization / ablation (palliative approach) A hybrid operating room supports steps 2 and 3 (if surgery is performed) of this workflow: = Biopsy = Small lung nodules identified on a thorax CT need to be examined for malignancy, thus a small portion of sample tissue is taken out in a needle procedure. The needle is advanced through the bronchial tree, or trans-thoracically, towards the position of the nodule. To make sure tissue is captured from the nodule as opposed to accidentally taking healthy lung tissue, imaging modalities such as mobile C-Arms, ultrasound, or bronchoscopes are used. The yield rate of biopsies in small nodules is reported to be between 33–50% in tumors smaller than 3 cm. To increase the yield rate, advanced interventional imaging with angiographic C-arms has proven to be beneficial. The advantage of intra-procedural imaging is that the patient and the diaphragm are in exactly the same position during 2D/3D imaging and the actual biopsy. Hence the accuracy is usually much higher than using pre- operative data. Rotational angiography visualizes the bronchial tree in 3D during the procedure. The air thereby serves as a ‘natural’ contrast agent, thus the nodules are well visible. On this 3D image, using dedicated software, the nodules can be marked, along with a planned needle path for the biopsy (endobronchially or trans-thoracically). These images can then be overlaid on live fluoroscopy. This gives the pulmonologist improved guidance towards the nodules. Yield rates of 90% in nodules of 1–2 cm, and 100% in nodules > 2 cm have been reported with this new approach. = Surgery = VATS (video- assisted thoracoscopic surgery) is a minimally-invasive technique to resect lung nodules that saves the patient the trauma of a thoracotomy. Thereby, small ports are used to access the pulmonary lobes and introduce a camera on a thoracoscope, along with the necessary instruments. While this procedure speeds up recovery and potentially reduces complications, the loss of natural vision and tactile sensing makes it difficult for the surgeon to locate the nodules, especially in cases of non-superficial, ground-glass opaque, and small lesions. The yield rate for nodules < 1 cm can be below 40% as studies show. As a consequence sometimes more healthy tissue is resected than actually necessary in order to avoid missing (parts of) the lesion. Using advanced intra-operative imaging in the OR helps to precisely locate and resect the lesion in a potentially tissue-sparing and quick fashion. In order to be able to use image guidance during VATS, rotational angiography has to be performed before the introduction of ports, thus before the lobe in question deflates. This way the lesion is visible through the natural contrast of air. In a second step, hook wires, thread needles, or contrast agent (Lipiodol, Iopamidol) are introduced into or next to the lesion to ensure visibility on the angiogram after lung deflation. Then, the conventional part of VATS starts with the introduction of thoracoscopes. The imaging system is used in fluoroscopic mode now, where both the inserted instruments and the previously marked lesion are well visible. A precise resection is now possible. In case contrast agent has been used to mark the lesion, it will also drain into the regional lymph nodes, which then can be resected within the same procedure.  Orthopedic trauma surgery  Complex fractures like pelvis fractures, calcaneus or tibia head fractures, etc. need an exact placement of screws and other surgical implants to allow quickest possible treatment of the patients. Minimally invasive surgical approaches result in less trauma for the patient and quicker recovery. However, the risk of malpositionins, revisions and nerval damage cannot be underestimated (Malposition and revision rates of different imaging modalities for percutaneous iliosacral screw fixation following pelvic fractures: a systematic review and meta-analysis). The possibility of the use of an angio system with a spatial resolution of 0.1 mm, the large field of view to image the entire pelvis in one image and the high kW rate allows the surgeon high precision images while not impairing hygiene (floor mounted systems) or access to the patient (CT). Degenerative spine surgery, traumatic spinal fractures, oncologic fractures or scoliosis surgery are other types of surgery that can be optimized in a hybrid OR.AO Foundation, AOTrauma Webcast: Intraoperative 3D Imaging and Computer Guidance for MIS in Spinal Trauma , University Hospital Um, Univ. Prof. Dr. Florian Gebhard, MD; Prof. Dr. Thomas R. Blattert, MD, July 10th, 2014 The large field of view and the high kW rate allow to optimally image even obese patients. Navigations systems or the use of integrated laser guidance can support and improve the workflow.  Laparoscopic surgery  As in other minimally invasive surgery, the first laparoscopic surgeons were smiled at and the surgical community did not believe in this new technology. Today it is the gold standard for most surgeries. Starting with a simple appendectomy, partial kidney resections and partial liver resections, etc. The laparoscopic approach is expanding. The image quality, the possibility of imaging the patient in the surgical position and the guidance of the instruments facilitate this approach.(Efficacy of DynaCT for surgical navigation during complex laparoscopic surgery: an initial experience. Partial resection of the kidney, leaving as much healthy tissue, meaning kidney function to the patient has been described some time ago (Nephron sparing surgery for renal tumors: indications, techniques and outcomes.). The challenges the surgeons face is the loss of natural 3D vision and tactile sensing. Through small ports he/she has to rely on the images provided by the endoscope and is unable to feel the tissue. In a hybrid operating room the anatomy can be updated and imaged in real time. 3D images can be fused and/or overlaid on live fluoroscopy or the endoscope. (Real-time image guidance in laparoscopic liver surgery: first clinical experience with a guidance system based on intraoperative CT imaging.) Crucial anatomy like vessels or a tumor can be avoided and complications reduced. Further investigations are under trial at the moment. (Surgical navigation in urology. European perspective)  Emergency care  For the treatment of trauma patients, every minute counts. Patients with severe bleeding after car accidents, explosions, gunshot wounds or aortic dissections, etc. need immediate care due to the life-threatening blood loss. In a hybrid operating room both open and endovascular treatment of the patient can be performed. For example, the tension in the brain due to a severe haemorrhage can be relieved and the aneurysm can be coiled. The concept of placing the emergency patient on an operating table as soon as he/she enters the hospital, if stable perform a trauma scan in the CT or if unstable immediate procedure in the hybrid operating room without having to reposition the patient can save valuable time and reduce risk of further injury.  Imaging techniques   Imaging techniques with a fixed C-Arm  = Fluoroscopy and data acquisition = Fluoroscopy is performed with continuous X-ray to guide the progression of a catheter or other devices within the body in live images. To depict even fine anatomic structures and devices, brilliant image quality is required. In particular, in cardiac interventions, imaging the moving heart requires a high frame rate (30f/s, 50 Hz) and high power output (at least 80 kW). Image quality needed for cardiac applications can only be achieved by high powered fixed angiography systems, not with mobile C-Arms. Angiographic systems provide a so-called acquisition mode, which stores the acquired images automatically on the system to be uploaded into an image archive later. While standard fluoroscopy is predominantly used to guide devices and to re-position the field of view, data acquisition is applied for reporting or diagnostic purposes. In particular, when contrast media is injected, a data acquisition is mandatory, because the stored sequences can be replayed as often as required without re-injection of contrast media. To achieve a sufficient image quality for diagnoses and reporting, the angiographic system uses up to 10 times higher x-ray doses than standard fluoroscopy. Thus, data acquisition should be applied only when truly necessary. Data acquisition serves as a base for advanced imaging techniques such as DSA and rotational angiography. = Rotational Angiography = Rotational angiography is a technique to acquire CT-like 3D images intraoperatively with a fixed C-Arm. To do that, the C-Arm is rotated around the patient, acquiring a series of projections that will be reconstructed to a 3D data set. = Digital subtraction angiography = Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is a two-dimensional imaging technique for the visualization of blood vessels in the human body (Katzen, 1995). For DSA, the same sequence of a projection is acquired without and then with contrast agent injection through the vessels under investigation. The first image is subtracted from the second to remove background structures such as bones as completely as possible and show the contrast-filled vessels more clearly. As there is a time lag between the acquisition of the first and the second image, motion correction algorithms are necessary to remove movement artifacts. An advanced application of DSA is road mapping. From the acquired DSA sequence, the image frame with maximum vessel opification is identified and assigned to be the so-called road-map mask. This mask is continuously subtracted from live fluoroscopy images to produce real-time subtracted fluoroscopic images overlaid on a static image of the vasculature. The clinical benefit is better visualization of small and complex vascular structures without distracting underlying tissue to support the placement of catheters and wires. = 2D/3D registration =  Fusion imaging and 2D/3D overlay  Modern angiographic systems are not just used for imaging, but support the surgeon also during the procedure by guiding the intervention based on 3D information acquired either pre-operatively or intra-operatively. Such guidance requires that the 3D information is registered to the patient. This is done using special proprietary software algorithms.  Information flow between workstation and angiographic system  3D images are calculated from a set of projections acquired during a rotation of the C-Arm around the patient. The volume reconstruction is performed on a separate workstation. The C-Arm and the workstation are connected a communicate continuously. For example, when the user virtually rotates the volume on the workstation to view the anatomy from a certain perspective, the parameter of this view can be transmitted to the angio system, which then drives the C-arm to exactly the same perspective for fluoroscopy. In the same way, if the C-arm angulation is changed, this angulation can be transmitted to the workstation which updates the volume to the same perspective as the fluoroscopic view. The software algorithm that stands behind this process is called registration and can also be done with other DICOM images, such as CT or MRT data acquired preoperatively.  Overlay of 3D information on top of 2D fluoroscopy  The 3D image itself can be overlaid colour-coded on top of the fluoroscopic image. Any change of the angulations of the C-arm will cause the workstation to re-calculate in real-time the view on the 3D image to match exactly the view of the live 2D fluoroscopy image. Without additional contrast agent injection the surgeon can observe device movements simultaneously with the 3D overlay of the vessel contours in the fluoroscopy image. An alternative way to add information from the workstation to the fluoroscopic image is to overlay, after either manual or automatic segmentation of the anatomical structures of interest in the 3D image, the outline as a contour onto the fluoroscopic image. This provides additional information that is not visible in the fluoroscopic image. Some software available provides landmarks automatically, more can be added manually be the surgeon or a qualified technician. One example is the placement of a fenestrated stentgraft to treat an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The ostia of the renal arteries can be circled on the 3D image and then overlaid on the live fluorscopy. As the marking has been done in 3D, it will update with any change of the fluoroscopy angulation to match the current view.  Guidance during Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI)  Trans-Aortic Valve Implantation requires exact positioning of the valve in the aortic root to prevent complications. A good fluoroscopic view is essential, whereby an exact perpendicular angle to the aortic root is considered to be optimal for the implantation. Recently, applications have been released which support the surgeon in selecting this optimal fluoroscopy angulation or even drive the C-arm automatically into the perpendicular view to the aortic root. Some approaches are based on pre-operative CT images, which are used to segment the aorta and calculate optimal viewing angles for valve implantations. CT images must be registered with C-arm CT or fluoroscopic images to transfer the 3D volume to the actual angiographic system. Errors during the registration process might result in diversification from the optimal angulations of the C-arm and must be manually corrected. Additionally, anatomical variations between the acquisition of the pre- operatively CT image and surgery are not accounted for. Patients are generally imaged with hands-up in a CT scanner while surgery is performed with arms aside the patient, which leads to substantial errors. Algorithms purely based on C-arm CT images acquired in the OR by the angiographic system are inherently registered to the patient and show the present anatomy structures. With such an approach, the surgeon does not rely on pre-operative CT images acquired by the radiological department which simplifies the workflow in the OR and reduces errors in the process. = Functional imaging in the OR = Improvements of the C-Arm technology nowadays also enable perfusion imaging and can visualize parenchymal blood volume in the OR. To do that, rotational angiography (3D-DSA) is combined with a modified injection protocol and a special reconstruction algorithm. The blood flow can then be visualized in the course of time. This can be useful in the treatments of patients suffering from ischemic stroke.  Imaging techniques with a CT  A CT system mounted on rails can be moved into and out of an OR to support complex surgical procedures, such as brain, spine and trauma surgery with additional information through imaging. The Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Maryland describes that their intra-operative CT usage has a positive impact on patient outcomes by improving safety, decreasing infections and lowering the risks of complications.  Imaging techniques with a MRT  Magnetic resonance imaging is used in Neurosurgery: # Before surgery to enable precise planning # During surgery to support decision making and accounting for brain shift # After surgery to evaluate the outcome An MRT system usually requires a lot of space both in the room and around the patient. It is not possible to perform surgery in a regular MRT room. Thus for step 2, there are two solutions of how to use an MR interoperatively, one is a moveable MRT scanner that can be brought in only when imaging is needed, the other is to transport the patient to an MR scanner in an adjacent room during surgery.  Planning considerations   Location/ Organization  Not only the usage of a hybrid operating room is \\"hybrid\\", but also its role within the hospital system. As it holds an imaging modality, the radiology department could take the lead responsibility for the room for expertise in handling, technical, maintenance, and connectivity reasons. From a patient workflow perspective, the room could be run by their surgical department and should rather be situated next to other surgical facilities, to ensure proper patient care and fast transportation.  Room size and preparation  Installing a hybrid OR is a challenge to standard hospital room sizes, as not only the imaging system requires some additional space, but there are also more people in the room as in a normal OR. A team of 8 to 20 people including anasthesiologists, surgeons, nurses, technicians, perfusionists, support staff from device companies etc. can work in such an OR. Depending on the imaging system chosen, a room size of 70 square meters including a control room but excluding a technical room and the preparation areas is recommended. Additional preparations of the room necessary are 2-3mm lead shielding and potentially enforcement of the floor or ceiling to hold the additional weight of the imaging system (approximately 650–1800 kg).  Workflow  Planning a hybrid OR requires to involve a considerable number of stakeholders. To ensure a smooth workflow in the room, all parties working there need to state their requirements, which will impact the room design and determining various resources like space, medical, and imaging equipment. This may require professional project management and several iterations in the planning process with the vendor of the imaging system, as technical interdependencies are complex. The result is always an individual solution tailored to the needs and preferences of the interdisciplinary team and the hospital.  Lights, monitors and booms  In general, two different light sources are needed in an operating room: the surgical (operating) lights used for open procedures and the ambient lighting for interventional procedures. Particular attention should be paid to the possibility to dim the lights. This is frequently needed during fluoroscopy or endoscopy. For the surgical lights it is most important that they cover the complete area across the operating room table. Moreover, they must not interfere with head heights and collision paths of other equipment. The most frequent mounting position of OR-lights is centrally above the OR table. If a different position is chosen, the lights usually are swivelled in from an area outside the OR table. Because one central axis per light head is necessary, this may lead to at least two central axes and mounting points in order to ensure sufficient illumination of the surgical field. The movement range of the angiography system determines the positioning of the OR lights. Central axes must be outside of moving path and swivel range. This is especially important as devices have defined room height requirements that must be met. In this case, head clearance height for the OR- light may be an issue. This makes lights a critical item in the planning and design process. Other aspects in the planning process of OR lights include avoidance of glare and reflections. Modern OR lights may have additional features, like build in camera and video capabilities. For the illumination of the wound area, a double-arm OR-light system is required. Sometimes even a third light may be required, in cases where more than one surgical activity takes place at the same time, e.g. vein stripping of the legs. In summary, the key topics for planning the surgical light system include: * Central location above the OR table (consideration in planning with ceiling mounted systems). * Usually three light heads for optimal illumination of multiple surgical fields * Suspension accommodating unrestricted, independent movement and stable positioning of light heads * Modular system with options for extension, e.g. video monitor and/or camera.  Imaging systems  The most common imaging modality to be used in hybrid ORs is a C-Arm. Expert consensus rates the performance of mobile C-arms in hybrid ORs as insufficient, because the limited power of the tube impacts image quality, the field of view is smaller for image-intensifier systems than for flat-panel detector systems and the cooling system of mobile C-Arms can lead to overheating after just a few hours, which can be too short for lengthy surgical procedures or for multiple procedures in a row, that would be needed to recover the investment in such a room.Nollert, G.; Hartkens, T.; Figel, A.; Bulitta, C.; Altenbeck, F.; Gerhard, V. (2012). The Hybrid Operating Room in Cardiac Surgery / Book 2. Intechweb. . Fixed C-Arms do not have these limitations, but require more space in the room. These systems can be mounted either on the floor, the ceiling, or both if a biplane system is chosen. The latter is the system of choice if pediatric cardiologists, electrophysiologists or neurointerventionalists are major users of the room. It is not recommended to implement a biplane system if not clearly required by these clinical disciplines, as ceiling-mounted components may raise hygienic issues: In fact, some hospitals do not allow operating parts directly above the surgical field, because dust may fall in the wound and cause infection. Since any ceiling- mounted system includes moving parts above the surgical field and impairs the laminar airflow, such systems are not the right option for hospitals enforcing highest hygienic standards. (see also and, both German only) There are more factors to consider when deciding between ceiling- and floor-mounted systems. Ceiling-mounted systems require substantial ceiling space and, therefore, reduce the options to install surgical lights or booms. Nonetheless, many hospitals choose ceiling-mounted systems because they cover the whole body with more flexibility and – most importantly – without moving the table. The latter is sometimes a difficult and dangerous undertaking during surgery with the many lines and catheters that must also be moved. Moving from a parking to a working position during surgery, however, is easier with a floor-mounted system, because the C-arm just turns in from the side and does not interfere with the anesthesiologist. The ceiling-mounted system, by contrast, during surgery can hardly move to a parking position at the head end without colliding with anesthesia equipment. In an overcrowded environment like the OR, biplane systems add to the complexity and interfere with anesthesia, except for neurosurgery, where anesthesia is not at the head end. Monoplane systems are therefore clearly recommended for rooms mainly used for cardiac surgery.  OR table  The selection of the OR table depends on the primary use of the system. Interventional tables with floating table tops and tilt and cradle compete with fully integrated flexible OR tables. Identification of the right table is a compromise between interventional and surgical requirements. Surgical and interventional requirements may be mutually exclusive. Surgeons, especially orthopedic, general and neurosurgeons usually expect a table with a segmented tabletop for flexible patient positioning. For imaging purposes, a radiolucent tabletop, allowing full body coverage, is required. Therefore, non-breakable carbon fibre tabletops are used. Interventionalists require a floating tabletop to allow fast and precise movements during angiography. Cardiac and vascular surgeons, in general, have less complex positioning needs, but based on their interventional experience in angiography may be used to having fully motorized movements of the table and the tabletop. For positioning patients on non breakable tabletops, positioning aids are available, i.e. inflatable cushions. Truly floating tabletops are not available with conventional OR tables. As a compromise, floatable angiography tables specifically made for surgery with vertical and lateral tilt are recommended. To further accommodate typical surgical needs, side rails for mounting surgical equipment like retractors or limb holders should be available for the table. The position of the table in the room also impacts surgical workflow. A diagonal position in the OR may be considered in order to gain space and flexibility in the room, as well as access to the patient from all sides. Alternatively, a conventional surgery table can be combined with an imaging system if the vendor offers a corresponding integration. The operating room can then be used either with a radiotranslucent but not breakable tabletop that supports 3D imaging, or with a universal breakable tabletop that provides enhanced patient positioning, but restricts 3D imaging. The latter are particularly suited for neuro- or orthopedic surgery, and these integrated solutions recently also became commercially available. If it is planned to share the room for hybrid and open conventional procedures, these are sometimes preferred. They provide greater workflow flexibility because the tabletops are dockable and can be easily exchanged, but require some compromises with interventional imaging. In summary, important aspects to be included considered are the position in the room, radiolucency (carbon fiber tabletop), compatibility, and integration of imaging devices with the operating table. Further aspects include table load, adjustable table height, and horizontal mobility (floating) including vertical and lateral tilt. It is important to also have proper accessories available, such as rails for mounting special surgical equipment retractors, camera holder). Free floating angiography tables with tilt and cradle capabilities are best suited for cardiovascular hybrid operating rooms.  Radiation dose  X-ray radiation is ionizing radiation, thus exposure is potentially harmful. Compared to a mobile C-Arm, which is classically used in surgery, CT scanners and fixed C-Arms work on a much higher energy level, which induces higher dose. Therefore, it is very important to monitor radiation dose applied in a hybrid OR both for the patient and the medical staff. There are a few simple measures to protect people in the OR from scatter radiation, thus lower their dose. Awareness is one critical issue, otherwise the available protection tools might be neglected. Among these tools is protective clothing in the form of a protective apron for the trunk, a protective thyroid shield around the neck and protective glasses. The later may be replaced by a ceiling-suspended lead glass panel. Additional lead curtains can be installed at the table side to protect the lower body region. Even more restrictive rules apply to pregnant staff members. A very effective measure of both protection to both the staff and the patient of course is applying less radiation. There is always a trade- off between radiation dose and image quality. A higher x-ray dose leads to a clearer picture. Modern software technology can improve image quality during post-processing, such that the same image quality is reached with a lower dose. Image quality thereby is described by contrast, noise, resolution and artifacts. In general, the ALARA principle (as low as reasonably achievable) should be followed. Dose should be as low as possible, but image quality can only be reduced to the level that the diagnostic benefit of the examination is still higher than the potential harm to the patient. There are both technical measures taking by x-ray equipment manufacturers to reduce dose constantly and handling options for the staff to reduce dose depending on the clinical application. Among the former is beam hardening. Among the latter are frame rate settings, pulsed fluoroscopy and collimation. Beam Hardening: X-ray radiation consists of hard and soft particles, i.e. particles with a lot of energy and particles with little energy. Unnecessary exposure is mostly caused by soft particles, as they are to weak to pass through the body and interact with it. Hard particles, by contrast, pass through the patient. A filter in front of the x-ray tube can catch the soft particles, thus hardening the beam. This decreases dose without impacting image quality. Frame rate: High frame rates (i.e. images acquired per second) are needed to visualize fast motion without stroboscopic effects. However, the higher the frame rate, the higher the radiation dose. Therefore, the frame rate should be chosen according to the clinical need and be as low as reasonably possible. For example, in pediatric cardiology, frame rates of 60 pulses per second are required compared to 0.5 p/s for slowly moving objects. A reduction to half pulse rate reduces dose by about half. The reduction from 30 p/s to 7.5 p/s results in a dose saving of 75%. When using pulsed fluoroscopy, radiation dose is only applied in prespecified intervals of time, thus less dose is used to produce the same image sequence. For the time in between, the last image stored is displayed. Another tool for decreasing dose is collimation. It may be that from the field of view provided by the detector, only a small part is interesting for the intervention. The x-ray tube can be shielded at the parts that are not necessary to be visible by a collimator, thus only sending dose to the detector for the body parts in question. Modern C-Arms enable to navigate on acquired images without constant fluoroscopy.

A common and debilitating feature is anomic aphasia, an impairment in the ability to name objects. The BNT contains 60 line drawings graded in difficulty. Patients with anomia often have greater difficulties with the naming of not only difficult and low frequency objects but also easy and high frequency objects. Naming difficulties may be rank ordered along a continuum. Items are rank ordered in terms of their ability to be named, which is correlated with their frequency. This type of picture-naming test is also useful in the examination of children with learning disabilities and the evaluation of brain-injured adults. Instructions for administration The 60-item BNT is widely used, while there are shorter versions of the test to suit the needs of the particular assessment. For most adults, the examiner begins with Item 30 and continues through Item 60, unless certain discontinue criteria--or reverse-order administration criteria--are met. The patient is shown target stimuli and asked to identify each target item within a 20-second interval per trial. The examiner writes down the patient’s responses in the Response Booklet. If the patient fails to give the correct response initially, the examiner provides a phonemic cue, which is the initial sound of the target word (e.g., \\"moo\\" for \\"moose\\"). A stimulus cue is provided if the patient blatantly misconstrues the image (i.e., viewing a musical instrument as a building). Additional administration criteria is provided in the Test Manual. After the patient completes the test, the examiner scores each item + or – according to the response coding and scoring procedures.

Austin, TX, Pro-Ed Inc., 2001 Brain areas associated with naming Research has found that several specific brain regions that showed greater gray and white matter volume and integrity were associated with better task performance on the BNT. The classically known language areas are Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas in the frontal and temporal lobes, respectively, of the left hemisphere (for most people). Additional areas that are activated for language processes are outside those areas in the left hemisphere—especially anterior to Broca’s area- as well as in right hemisphere regions. Naming tasks seem to be associated with the left triangularis in the frontal lobe and superior temporal-lobe regions (including the planum temporale). Whereas Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas in the left hemisphere are mainly responsible for language production and comprehension, respectively, the right hemisphere regions are known to play a different role in language processing including discourse planning, comprehension, understanding humor, sarcasm, metaphors and indirect requests, and the generation/comprehension of emotional prosody.

The station features community arts programmes, music programmes and local news and current affairs programmes specifically for the region and wider afield. Originally named Youth Voice FM and operated as part of the VODA scheme, Y Radio is now licensed and regulated. History 2009-2012 Y Radio first began as Youth Voice FM in 2009 as part of the VODA scheme. At this time current presenter Daniel Fawcus took part in the broadcasts, which were originally designed to meet the schemes needs and wishes, and didn't extend much further than those sessions. In January 2010 Y Radio was given an official relaunch by then station manager Laura Robertson and the original www.yradio.co.uk site was born. The station established a series of 8 programmes with topics from Football to Politics and involved local councillors in the area, students and amateur radio presenters. During this time the programmes received a moderate amount of attention and the station also launched an accompanying magazine which was distributed in the area. In April 2011 the station received another relaunch, with the majority of programmes being either relaunched or re- branded and a massive recruitment drive for presenters being initiated by current station manager Steven Hesse. Steven also relaunched the Y Radio.co.uk with a new mock up and design and went about organising a weekly newsletter informing people of the station's progress. Steven was also responsible for launching the Multimedia/Review sections of the website which focus on written and video reviews of albums, events, films and games. This gives the presenters a chance to expand on their Journalism skills and review their favourites in more detail. About 30 volunteers currently produce and broadcast 35 hours of quality programmes each week from the studios. Shows include The Steven Hesse Show, Game On, Noise Up, Game On, The Film Space, THAT Volunteer Show, The Hepple Show and Stuart Smiles Car Show. Y Radio also operates its own YouTube channel (YRadioNE) which features an assortment of video interviews from both in and out of the studio with local, national and international musicians. A Game On newsletter/magazine supplement is also in development and hopes to be launched in February 2012 The Graveyard Shift One of the more original shows on the schedule is The Graveyard Shift, a show presented by Wayne Madden (once a producer at the former UTV Talk107), which is a Hard Rock and Heavy Metal show containing news, views, interviews and reviews from the scene both locally and further afield. It is the only show on Y Radio to remain unchanged since January 2010 (when it was first broadcast) and has featured both collaborations with festivals like The Damnation Festival and Sonisphere as well as interviews with bands like Trivium, Black Dahlia Murder, Alter Bridge, Theory Of A Deadman and In Flames Staff *Station Manager - Steven Hesselwood (Hesse) *Community Liaison - Bruce Robertson *Press Officer - Wayne Madden *Michael Hepple most listened to radio presenter also yradio's representative on the shadow board The station is managed by the YMCA North Tyneside.

Collins English Dictionary. from , ') was an ancient Semitic-speaking thalassocratic civilization that originated in the Levant region of the eastern Mediterranean, primarily modern Lebanon. It was concentrated along the coast of Lebanon and included some coastal areas of modern Syria and Galilee (northern Israel), reaching as far north as Arwad and as far south as Acre and possibly Gaza. At its height between 1100 and 200 BC, Phoenician civilization spread across the Mediterranean, from Cyprus to the Iberian Peninsula. The term Phoenicia is an exonym from ancient Greek that most likely described a dye also known as Tyrian purple, a major export of Canaanite port towns. The term did not correspond precisely to Phoenician culture or society as it would have been understood natively, and it is debated whether the Phoenicians were actually a distinct civilization from the Canaanites and other residents of the Levant. The Phoenicians came to prominence following the collapse of most major cultures during the Late Bronze Age. They were renowned in antiquity as adept merchants, expert seafarers, and intrepid explorers. They developed an expansive maritime trade network that lasted over a millennium, becoming the dominant commercial power for much of classical antiquity. Phoenician trade also helped facilitate the exchange of cultures, ideas, and knowledge between major cradles of civilization such as Greece, Egypt, and Mesopotamia. After its zenith in the ninth century BC, Phoenician civilization in the eastern Mediterranean slowly declined in the face of foreign influence and conquest, though its presence would remain in the central and western Mediterranean until the second century BC. Phoenician civilization was organized in city-states, similar to those of ancient Greece, of which the most notable were Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos. Each city-state was politically independent, and there is no evidence the Phoenicians viewed themselves as a single nationality. Carthage, a Phoenician settlement in northwest Africa, became a major civilization in its own right in the seventh century BC. Long considered a lost civilization due to the lack of indigenous written records, academic and archaeological developments since the mid-20th century have revealed the Phoenicians to be a complex and influential civilization. Their best known legacy is the world's oldest verified alphabet, which they transmitted across the Mediterranean world.{ The Phoenicians are also credited with innovations in shipbuilding, navigation, industry, agriculture, and government. Their international trade network is believed to have fostered the economic, political, and cultural foundations of Western civilization. Etymology The name Phoenicians, like Latin ' (adj. ', later '), comes from Greek ('). The word ' meant variably \\"Phoenician person\\", \\"Tyrian purple, crimson\\" or \\"date palm.\\" Homer used it with each of these meanings. (The mythical bird phoenix also carries the same name, but this meaning is not attested until centuries later.) It is difficult to ascertain which meaning came first, but it is understandable how Greeks may have associated the crimson or purple color of dates and dye with the merchants who traded both products. The Greek word may derive directly from the Phoenicians' endonym; the land was natively known as ' (Pūt) and its people as the ' (Pōnnim). History Since little has survived of Phoenician records or literature, most of what is known about their origins and history comes from the accounts of other civilizations and inferences from their material culture excavated throughout the Mediterranean. Origins The Canaanite culture that gave rise to the Phoenicians apparently developed in situ from the earlier Ghassulian chalcolithic culture. Ghassulian itself developed from the Circum-Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex, which in turn developed from a fusion of their ancestral Natufian and Harifian cultures with Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) farming cultures, practicing the domestication of animals during the 6200 BC climate crisis, which led to the Neolithic Revolution in the Levant. Byblos is attested as an archaeological site from the Early Bronze Age. The Late Bronze Age state of Ugarit is considered quintessentially Canaanite archaeologically,Tubb, Jonathan N. (1998), \\"Canaanites\\" (British Museum People of the Past) even though the Ugaritic language does not belong to the Canaanite languages proper. . . Some scholars suggest there is evidence for a Semitic dispersal to the fertile crescent circa 2500 BC; others believe the Phoenicians originated from an admixture of previous non-Semitic inhabitants with the Semitic arrivals. Herodotus believed that the Phoenicians originated from Bahrain, a view shared centuries later by the historian Strabo. The people of modern Tyre in Lebanon, have particularly long maintained Persian Gulf origins. The Dilmun civilization thrived in Bahrain during the period 2200–1600 BC, as shown by excavations of settlements and the Dilmun burial mounds. However, recent genetic researches have shown that present-day Lebanese derive most of their ancestry from a Canaanite- related population. Emergence during the Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 BC) The first known account of the Phoenicians relates to the conquests of Pharaoh Thutmose III (1479–1425 BC). The Egyptians targeted coastal cities such as Byblos, Arwad, and Ullasa for their crucial geographic and commercial links with the interior (via the Nahr al-Kabir and the Orontes rivers). The cities provided Egypt with access to Mesopotamian trade as well as abundant stocks of the region's native cedar wood, of which there was no equivalent in the Egyptian homeland. By the mid 14th century, the Phoenician city states were considered \\"favored cities\\" to the Egyptians. Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, and Byblos were regarded as the most important. The Phoenicians had considerable autonomy and their cities were fairly well developed and prosperous. Byblos was evidently the leading city outside Egypt proper; it was a major center of bronze-making, and the primary terminus of precious goods such as tin and lapis lazuli from as far east as Afghanistan. Sidon and Tyre also commanded interest among Egyptian officials, beginning a pattern of rivalry that would span the next millennium. The Amarna letters report that from 1350 to 1300 BC, neighboring Amorites and Hittites were capturing Phoenician cities, especially in the north. Egypt subsequently lost its coastal holdings from Ugarit in northern Syria to Byblos near central Lebanon. Ascendance and high point (1200–800 BC) Some time between 1200 and 1150 BC, the Late Bronze Age collapse severely weakened or destroyed most civilizations in the region, including the Egyptians and Hittites. The Phoenicians appear to have weathered the crisis relatively well, emerging as a distinct and organized civilization in 1230 BC. The period is sometimes described as a \\"Phoenician renaissance.\\" They filled the power vacuum caused by the Late Bronze Age collapse by becoming the sole mercantile and maritime power in the region, a status they would maintain for the next several centuries. The recovery of the Mediterranean economy can be credited to Phoenician mariners and merchants, who re-established long distance trade between Egypt and Mesopotamia in the 10th century BC. Early into the Iron Age, the Phoenicians established ports, warehouses, markets, and settlement all across the Mediterranean and up to the southern Black Sea. Colonies were established on Cyprus, Sardinia, the Balearic Islands, Sicily, and Malta, as well as the coasts of North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula. Phoenician hacksilver dated to this period bears lead isotope ratios matching ores in Sardinia and Spain, indicating the extent of Phoenician trade networks. By the tenth century BC, Tyre rose to become the richest and most powerful Phoenician city state, particularly during the reign of Hiram I (c. 969–936 BC). During the rule of the priest Ithobaal (887–856 BC), Tyre expanded its territory as far north as Beirut (incorporating its former rival Sidon) and into part of Cyprus; this unusual act of aggression was the closest the Phoenicians ever came to forming a unitary territorial state. Once his realm reached its greatest territorial extent, Ithobaal declared himself \\"King of the Sidonians\\", a title that would be used by his successors and mentioned in both Greek and Jewish accounts. The Late Iron Age saw the height of Phoenician shipping, mercantile, and cultural activity, particularly between 750 and 650 BC. Phoenician influence was visible in the \\"Orientalization\\" of Greek cultural and artistic conventions. Among their most popular goods were fine textiles, typically dyed with Tyrian purple. Homer's Iliad, which was composed during this period, references the quality of Phoenician clothing and metal goods. Foundation of Carthage Carthage was founded by Phoenicians coming from Tyre, probably initially as a station in the metal trade with the southern Iberian Peninsula. The city's name in Punic, , means \\"New City\\". There is a tradition in some ancient sources, such as Philistos of Syracuse, for an \\"early\\" foundation date of around 1215 BC—before the fall of Troy in 1180 BC. However, Timaeus, a Greek historian from Sicily c. 300 BC, places the foundation of Carthage in 814 BC, which is the date generally accepted by modern historians. Legend, including Virgil's Aeneid, assigns the founding of the city to Queen Dido. Carthage would grow into a multi-ethnic empire spanning North Africa, Sardinia, Sicily, Malta, the Balearic Islands, and southern Iberia, but would ultimately be destroyed by Rome in the Punic Wars (264–146 BC) before being rebuilt as a Roman city.

British Museum. As a mercantile power concentrated along a narrow coastal strip of land, the Phoenicians lacked the size and population to support a large military. Thus, as neighboring empires began to rise, the Phoenicians increasingly fell under the sway of foreign rulers, who to varying degrees circumscribed their autonomy. The Assyrian conquest of Phoenicia began with King Shalmaneser III, who rose to power in 858 BC and began a series of campaigns against neighboring states. The Phoenician city-states fell under his rule, forced to pay heavy tribute in money, goods, and natural resources. Initially they were not annexed outright—they remained in a state of vassalage, subordinate to the Assyrians but allowed a certain degree of freedom. This changed in 744 BC with the ascension of Tiglath-Pileser III. By 738 BC, most of the Levant, including northern Phoenicia, were annexed; only Tyre and Byblos, the most powerful of the city states, remained as tributary states outside of direct Assyrian control. Tyre, Byblos, and Sidon all rebelled against Assyrian rule. In 721 BC, Sargon II besieged Tyre and crushed the rebellion. His successor Sennacherib suppressed further rebellions across the region. During the seventh century BC, Sidon rebelled and was completely destroyed by Esarhaddon, who enslaved its inhabitants and built a new city on its ruins. By the end of the century, the Assyrians had been weakened by successive revolts, which led to their destruction by the Median Empire. The Babylonians, formerly vassals of the Assyrians, took advantage of the empire's collapse and rebelled, quickly establishing the Neo-Babylonian Empire in its place. Phoenician cities revolted several times throughout the reigns of the first Babylonian king, Nabopolassar (626–605 BC), and his son Nebuchadnezzar II (c. 605–c. 562 BC). In 587 BC Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre, which resisted for thirteen years, but ultimately capitulated under \\"favorable terms\\". Persian period (539–332 BC) Pontoon Bridges for Xerxes I of Persia during the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC. In 539 BC, Cyrus the Great, king and founder of the Persian Achaemenid Empire, took Babylon. As Cyrus began consolidating territories across the Near East, the Phoenicians apparently made the pragmatic calculation of \\"[yielding] themselves to the Persians.\\" Most of the Levant was consolidated by Cyrus into a single satrapy (province) and forced to pay a yearly tribute of 350 talents, which was roughly half the tribute that was required of Egypt and Libya. The Phoenician area was later divided into four vassal kingdoms—Sidon, Tyre, Arwad and Byblos—which were allowed considerable autonomy. Unlike in other areas of the empire, there is no record of Persian administrators governing the Phoenician city-states. Local Phoenician kings were allowed to remain in power and even given the same rights as Persian satraps (governors), such as hereditary offices and minting their own coins. Coin of Abdashtart I of Sidon during the Achaemenid period. He is depicted behind the Persian king on the chariot. The Phoenicians remained a core asset to the Achaemenid Empire, particularly for their prowess in maritime technology and navigation; they furnished the bulk of the Persian fleet during the Greco-Persian Wars of the late fifth century BC. Phoenicians under Xerxes I built the Xerxes Canal and the pontoon bridges that allowed his forces to cross into mainland Greece. Nevertheless, they were harshly punished by the Persian king following his defeat at the Battle of Salamis, which he blamed on Phoenician cowardice and incompetence. In the mid fourth century BC, King Tennes of Sidon led a failed rebellion against Artaxerxes III, enlisting the help of the Egyptians, who were subsequently drawn into a war with the Persians. The resulting destruction of Sidon led to the resurgence of Tyre, which remained the principal Phoenician city for two decades until the arrival of Alexander the Great. Hellenistic period (332–63 BC) Phoenicia was one of the first areas to be conquered by Alexander the Great during his military campaigns across western Asia. Alexander's main target in the Persian Levant was Tyre, now the region's largest and most important city. It capitulated after a roughly seven month siege, during which many of its citizens fled to Carthage. Tyre's refusal to allow Alexander to visit its temple to Melqart, culminating in the killing of his envoys, led to a brutal reprisal: 2,000 of its leading citizens were crucified and a puppet ruler was installed. The rest of Phoenicia easily came under his control, with Sidon surrendering peacefully. A naval action during Alexander the Great's siege of Tyre (350 BC). Drawing by , 1888–89. Alexander's empire had a policy of Hellenization, whereby Greek culture, religion, and sometimes language were spread or imposed across conquered peoples. This was typically implemented through the founding of new cities, the settlement of a Greek urban elite, and the alteration of native place names to Greek. However, there was evidently no organized Hellenization in Phoenicia, and with one or two minor exceptions, all Phoenician city states retained their native names, while Greek settlement and administration appears to have been limited. The Phoenicians maintained cultural and commercial links with their western counterparts. Polybius recounts how the Seleucid king Demetrius I escaped from Rome by boarding a Carthaginian ship that was delivering goods to Tyre. The adaptation to Macedonian rule was likely aided by the Phoenicians' historical ties with the Greeks, with whom they shared some mythological stories and figures; the two peoples were even sometimes considered \\"relatives\\". When Alexander's empire collapsed after his death in 323 BC, the Phoenicians came under the control of the largest of its successors, the Seleucids. The Phoenician homeland was repeatedly contested by the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt during the forty year Syrian Wars, coming under Ptolemaic rule in the third century BC. The Seleucids reclaimed the area the following century, holding it until the mid- first century BC. Under their rule, the Phoenicians were evidently allowed a considerable degree of autonomy. During the Seleucid Dynastic Wars (157–63 BC), the Phoenician cities were fought over by the warring factions of the Seleucid royal family. The Seleucid Kingdom, including Phoenicia, was seized by Tigranes the Great of Armenia in 82 BC. With their strategically valuable buffer state absorbed into a rival power, the Romans were moved to intervene and conquer the territory in 62 BC. Shortly thereafter, the territory was incorporated into the Roman province of Syria. Phoenicia became a separate province in the third century AD. Demographics The Phoenicians were an offshoot of the Canaanites, a group of ancient Semitic-speaking peoples that emerged at least in the second millennium BC. Though they were often known to outsiders as Canaanites, and continued to self-identify as such, the Phoenicians became a distinct people some time in the Late Bronze Age, between the 14th and 13th centuries. A 2018 study of mitochondrial lineages in Sardinia concluded that the Phoenicians were \\"inclusive, multicultural and featured significant female mobility\\", with evidence of indigenous Sardinians integrating \\"peacefully and permanently\\" with Phoenician settlers. The study also found evidence suggesting that Europeans may have settled in the area of modern Lebanon. Genetic studies A 2008 study led by Pierre Zalloua found that six subclades of Haplogroup J-M172 (J2)—thought to have originated between the Caucasus Mountains, Mesopotamia and the Levant—were of a \\"Phoenician signature\\" and present amongst the male populations of the \\"coastal Lebanese Phoenician Heartland\\" and wider Levant (the \\"Phoenician Periphery\\"), followed by other areas of historic Phoenician settlement, spanning Cyprus through to Morocco. This deliberate sequential sampling was an attempt to develop a methodology to link the documented historical expansion of a population with a particular geographic genetic pattern or patterns. The researchers suggested that the proposed genetic signature stemmed from \\"a common source of related lineages rooted in Lebanon\\". Another study in 2006 found evidence for the genetic persistence of Phoenicians in the Spanish island of Ibiza. In 2016, the skeleton of 2,500 year old Carthaginian man was excavated from a Punic tomb in Tunisia, and was found bearing the rare U5b2c1 maternal haplogroup. The lineage of this \\"Young Man of Byrsa\\" is believed to represent early gene flow from Iberia to the Maghreb, and is the oldest European lineage discovered in Africa. A series of studies of different populations in the Levant suggest that Levantine Semites—such as Lebanese, Mizrahi Jews, Palestinians, and Syrians—are the closest surviving relatives of ancient Phoenicians. One study found that the Lebanese share 93% of their DNA with Bronze Age Sidonians. Economy Trade Major Phoenician trade networks (c. 1200–800 BC) The Phoenicians served as intermediaries between the disparate civilizations that spanned the Mediterranean and Near East, facilitating the exchange of not only goods, but knowledge, culture, and religious traditions. Their expansive and enduring trade network is credited with laying the foundations of an economically and culturally cohesive Mediterranean, which would be continued by the Greeks and especially the Romans. Phoenician ties with the Greeks ran deep. The earliest verified relationship appears to have begun with the Minoan civilization on Crete (1950–1450 BC), which together with the Mycenaean civilization (1600–1100 BC) is considered the progenitor of classical Greece. Archaeological research suggests that the Minoans gradually imported Near Eastern goods, artistic styles, and customs from other cultures via the Phoenicians. To Egypt the Phoenicians sold logs of cedar for significant sums, and wine beginning in the eighth century. The wine trade with Egypt is vividly documented by shipwrecks discovered in 1997 in the open sea west of Ascalon, Israel. Pottery kilns at Tyre and Sarepta produced the large terracotta jars used for transporting wine. From Egypt, the Phoenicians bought Nubian gold. sarcophagi found in Cádiz, Spain, thought to have been imported from the Phoenician homeland around Sidon.A. B. Freijeiro, R. Corzo Sánchez, Der neue anthropoide Sarkophag von Cadiz. In: Madrider Mitteilungen 22, 1981. Archaeological Museum of Cádiz. From elsewhere, they obtained other materials, perhaps the most important being silver, mostly from Sardinia and the Iberian Peninsula. Tin for making bronze \\"may have been acquired from Galicia by way of the Atlantic coast or southern Spain; alternatively, it may have come from northern Europe (Cornwall or Brittany) via the Rhone valley and coastal Massalia\\". Strabo states that there was a highly lucrative Phoenician trade with Britain for tin via the Cassiterides, whose location is unknown but may have been off the northwest coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Industry Phoenician bowl with hunting scene (eighth century BC). The clothing and hairstyle of the figures is Egyptian, while the subject matter of the central scene conforms with the Mesopotamian theme of combat between man and beast. Phoenician artisans frequently adapted the styles of neighboring cultures. Phoenicia lacked notable natural resources other than its cedar wood. Timber was probably the earliest and most lucrative source of wealth; neither Egypt nor Mesopotamia had adequate sources of wood. Unable to rely solely on this limited resource, the Phoenicians developed an industrial base manufacturing a variety of goods for both common and luxury use. The Phoenicians developed or mastered techniques such as glass-making, engraved and chased metalwork (including bronze, iron, and gold), ivory carving, and woodwork. The Phoenicians were early pioneers in mass production, and sold a variety of items in bulk. They became the leading source of glassware in antiquity, shipping thousands of flasks, beads, and other glass objects across the Mediterranean. Excavations of colonies in Spain suggest they also utilized the potter's wheel. Their exposure to a wide variety of cultures allowed them to manufacture goods for specific markets. The Iliad suggests Phoenician clothing and metal goods were highly prized by the Greeks. Specialized goods were designed specifically for wealthier clientele, including ivory reliefs and plaques, carved clam shells, sculpted amber, and finely detailed and painted ostrich eggs. =Tyrian purple= Etruscan tomb (c. 350 BC) depicting a man wearing in an all-purple toga picta. The most prized Phoenician goods were fabrics dyed with Tyrian purple, which formed a major part of Phoenician wealth. The violet-purple dye derived from the hypobranchial gland of the Murex sea-snail, once profusely available in coastal waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea but exploited to local extinction. Phoenicians may have discovered the dye as early as 1750 BC. The Phoenicians established a second production center for the dye in Mogador, in present-day Morocco. The Phoenicians' exclusive command over the production and trade of the dye, combined with the labor-intensive extraction process, made it very expensive. Tyrian purple subsequently became associated with the upper classes and soon became a status symbol in several civilizations, most notably among the Romans. Assyrian records of tribute from the Phoenicians include \\"garments of brightly colored stuff\\" that most likely included Tyrian purple. While the designs, ornamentation, and embroidery used in Phoenician textiles were apparently well-regarded, the techniques and specific descriptions are unknown. =Mining= Mining operations in the Phoenician homeland were limited; iron was the only metal of any worth. The first large- scale mining operations probably occurred in Cyprus, principally for copper. Sardinia may have been colonized almost exclusively for its mineral resources; Phoenician settlements were concentrated in the southern parts of the island, close to sources of copper and lead. Piles of scoria and copper ingots, which appear to predate Roman occupation, suggest the Phoenicians mined and processed metals on the island. The Iberian Peninsula was known for being the richest source of numerous metals in antiquity, including gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, and lead. The significant output of these metals during the Phoenician and Carthaginian occupation strongly implied large scale mining operations. The Carthaginians are documented to have relied on slave labor for mining, though it is unknown if the Phoenicians as a whole did so. =Viticulture= The most notable agricultural product was wine, which the Phoenicians helped propagate across the Mediterranean. The common grape vine may have been domesticated by the Phoenicians or Canaanites, although it most likely arrived from Transcaucasia via trade routes across Mesopotamia or the Black Sea. Vines grew readily in the coastal Levant, and wine was exported to Egypt as early as the Old Kingdom period (2686–2134 BC). Wine played an important part in Phoenician religion, serving as the principal beverage for offerings and sacrifice. An excavation of a small Phoenician town south of Sidon uncovered a wine factory used from at least the seventh century BC, which is believed to have been aimed for an overseas market. To prevent oxidation, vessels were sealed with a layer of olive oil, pinewood, and resin. The Phoenicians established vineyards and wineries in their colonies in North Africa, Sicily, France, and Spain, and may have taught winemaking to some of their trading partners. The ancient Iberians began producing wine from local grape varieties following their encounter with the Phoenicians, and Iberian cultivars subsequently formed the basis of most western European wine. =Shipbuilding= As early as 1200 BC, the Phoenicians built large merchant ships. During the Bronze Age, they developed the keel. Pegged mortise-and- tenon joints proved effective enough to serve as a standard until late into the Roman Empire. The Phoenicians were possibly the first to introduce the bireme, around 700 BC. An Assyrian account describes Phoenicians evading capture with these ships. The Phoenicians are also credited with inventing the trireme, which was regarded as the most advanced and powerful vessel in the ancient Mediterranean world, and were eventually adopted by the Greeks. The Phoenicians developed several other maritime inventions. The amphora, a type of container used for both dry and liquid goods, was an ancient Phoenician invention that became a standardized measurement of volume for close to two thousand years. The remnants of self-cleaning artificial harbors have been discovered in Sidon, Tyre, Atlit, and Acre. The first example of admiralty law also appears in the Levant. The Phoenicians continued to contribute to cartography into the Iron Age. In 2014, a roughly 50-foot Phoenician trading ship was found near Gozo island in Malta. Dated 700 BC, it is one of the oldest wrecks found in the Mediterranean. Fifty amphorae, used to contain wine and oil, were scattered nearby. Important cities and colonies Map of Phoenician (in yellow) and Greek colonies around 8th to 6th century BC (with German legend) The Phoenicians were not a nation in the political sense, but were organized into independent city states that shared a common language and culture. The leading city states were Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos. Rivalries were common, but armed conflict rare. Numerous other cities existed in the Levant alone, many probably unknown, including Berut (modern Beirut) Ampi, Amia, Arqa, Baalbek, Botrys, Sarepta and Tripoli. From the late tenth century BC, the Phoenicians established commercial outposts throughout the Mediterranean, with Tyre founding colonies in Cyprus, Sardinia, Iberia, the Balearic Islands, Sicily, Malta, and North Africa. Later colonies were established beyond the Straits of Gibraltar, particularly on the Atlantic coast of Iberia, and the Phoenicians may have explored the Canary Islands and the British Isles. Phoenician settlement was especially concentrated in Cyprus, Sicily, Sardinia, Malta, northwest Africa, the Balearic Islands, and southern Iberia. Phoenician colonization To facilitate their commercial ventures, the Phoenicians established numerous colonies and trading posts along the coasts of the Mediterranean. Phoenician city states generally lacked the numbers or even the desire to expand their territory overseas. Few colonies had more than 1,000 inhabitants; only Carthage and some nearby settlements in the western Mediterranean would grow larger. A major motivating factor was competition with the Greeks, who began expanding across the Mediterranean during the same period. Though a largely peaceful rivalry, their respective settlements in Crete and Sicily did clash intermittently. The earliest Phoenician settlements outside the Levant were on Cyprus and Crete, gradually moving westward towards Corsica, the Balearic Islands, Sardinia, and Sicily, as well as on the European mainland in Genoa and Marseilles. The first Phoenician colonies in the western Mediterranean were along the northwest African coast and on Sicily, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands. Tyre led the way in settling or controlling coastal areas. Phoenician colonies were fairly autonomous. At most, they were expected to send annual tribute to their mother city, usually in the context of a religious offering. However, in the seventh century BC the western colonies came under the control of Carthage, which was exercised directly through appointed magistrates. Carthage continued to send annual tribute to Tyre for some time after its independence. Society and culture Since very little of the Phoenicians' own writings have survived, much of what is known about their culture and society comes from accounts by contemporary civilizations or inferences from archaeological discoveries. The Phoenicians had much in common with other Canaanites, including language, religion, social customs, and a monarchical political system centered around city-states. However, by the early Iron Age (roughly 1300 BC) they had emerged as a distinct people, with their culture, economy, and daily life being heavily centered on commerce and maritime trade. Their propensity for seafaring brought them into contact with numerous other civilizations. Politics and government King Hiram I of Tyre, located in the village of Hanawai (Hanawiya or Hanawey) in southern Lebanon. The Phoenician city-states were fiercely independent in both domestic and foreign affairs. Formal alliances between city states were rare. The relative power and influence of city-states varied over time. Sidon was dominant between the 12th and 11th centuries BC, and exercised some influence over its neighbors, but by the tenth century BC, Tyre rose to become the most powerful city. Phoenician society was highly stratified and predominantly monarchical, at least in its earlier stages. Hereditary kings usually governed with absolute power over civic, commercial, and religious affairs. They often relied upon senior officials from the noble and merchant classes; the priesthood was a distinct class, usually of royal lineage or from leading merchant families. The king was considered a representative of the gods and carried many obligations and duties with respect to religious processions and rituals. Priests were thus highly influential and often became intertwined with the royal family. Phoenician kings did not commemorate their reign through sculptures or monuments. Their wealth, power, and accomplishments were usually conveyed through ornate sarcophagi, like that of Ahiram of Byblos. The Phoenicians kept records of their rulers in the form of tomb inscriptions, which are among the few primary sources still available. Historians have been able to determine a clear line of succession over centuries for some city-states, notably Byblos and Tyre. Starting as early as 15th century BC, Phoenician leaders were \\"advised by councils or assemblies which gradually took greater power\\". In the sixth century BC, during the period of Babylonian rule, Tyre briefly adopted a system of government consisting of a pair of judges, known as , who were chosen from the most powerful noble families and served short terms. Nineteenth century depiction of Phoenician sailors and merchants. The importance of trade to the Phoenician economy evidently led to a gradual sharing of power between the king and assemblies of merchant families. In the fourth century BC, when the armies of Alexander the Great approached Tyre, they were met not by its king but by representatives of the commonwealth of the city. Similarly, historians at the time describe the \\"inhabitants\\" or \\"the people\\" of Sidon making peace with Alexander. When the Macedonians sought to appoint a new king over Sidon, the citizens nominated their own candidate. Law and administration After the king and council, the two most important political positions in virtually every Phoenician city state were that of governor and commander of the army. Details regarding the duties of these offices are sparse, but it is known that the governor was responsible for collecting taxes, implementing decrees, supervising judges, and ensuring the administration of law and justice. As warfare was rare among the mostly mercantile Phoenicians, the commander of the army was generally responsible for ensuring the defense and security of the city-state and its hinterlands. Stela from Tyre with Phoenician inscriptions (c. fourth century BC). National Museum of Beirut. The Phoenicians had a system of courts and judges that resolved disputes and punished crimes based on a semi-codified body of law and traditional. Laws were implemented by the state and were the responsibility of the ruler and certain designated officials. Like other Levantine societies, laws were harsh and biased, reflecting the social stratification of society. The murder of a commoner was treated as less serious than of a nobleman, and the upper classes had the most rights; the wealthy often escaped punishment by paying a fine. Free men of any class could represent themselves in court and had more rights than women and children, while slaves had no rights at all. Men could often deflect punishment to their wives, children, or slaves, even having them serve his sentence in his place. Lawyers eventually emerged as a profession for those who could not plead their own case. As in neighboring societies at the time, penalties for crimes were often severe, usually reflecting the principle of reciprocity; for example, the killing of a slave would be punished by having the offender's slave killed. Imprisonment was rare, with fines, exile, punishment, and execution were main remedies. Military As with most aspects of Phoenician civilization, there are few records of their military or approach to warfare. Compared to most of their neighbors, the Phoenicians generally had little interest in conquest and were a relatively peaceful people. The wealth and prosperity of all their city states rested on foreign trade, which required good relations and a certain degree of mutual trust. They also lacked the territory and agricultural base to support a population large enough for anything other than city defense; each city had an army commander in charge of a defensive garrison, but the specifics of the role, or of city defense, are unknown. Language The Phoenician language was a member of the Canaanite branch of the Semitic languages. Its descendant language spoken in the Carthaginian Empire is termed Punic. Punic was still spoken in the fifth century AD, and known to St. Augustine of Hippo. =Alphabet= Sarcophagus of Ahiram, which bears the oldest inscription of the Phoenician alphabet. National Museum of Beirut Around 1050 BC, the Phoenicians developed a script for writing their own language. The Canaanite-Phoenician alphabet consists of 22 letters, all consonants (and is thus strictly an abjad). It is believed to be a continuation of the Proto-Sinaitic (or Proto-Canaanite) script attested in the Sinai and in Canaan in the Late Bronze Age. Through their maritime trade, the Phoenicians spread the use of the alphabet to Anatolia, North Africa, and Europe. The name Phoenician is by convention given to inscriptions beginning around 1050 BC, because Phoenician, Hebrew, and other Canaanite dialects were largely indistinguishable before that time. Phoenician inscriptions are found in Lebanon, Syria, Israel, Cyprus and other locations, as late as the early centuries of the Christian era. The alphabet was adopted and modified by the Greeks probably in the eighth century BC. This most likely did not occur in a single instance but in a process of commercial exchange. The legendary Phoenician hero Cadmus is credited with bringing the alphabet to Greece, but it is more plausible that it was brought by Phoenician immigrants to Crete, whence it gradually diffused northwards. Art Phoenician art was largely centered on ornamental objects, particularly jewelry, pottery, glassware, and reliefs. Large sculptures were rare; figurines were more common. Phoenician goods have been found from Spain and Morocco to Russia and Iraq; much of what is known about Phoenician art is based from excavations outside of Phoenicia proper. Phoenician art was highly influenced by the many cultures the Phoenicians traded and interacted with, primarily Egypt, Greece, and Assyria. Greek inspiration was particularly pronounced in pottery, while Egyptian styles were most reflected in ivory work. Phoenician art also differed from its contemporaries in its continuance of Bronze Age conventions well into the Iron Age, such as terracotta masks. Phoenician artisans were known for their skill with wood, ivory, bronze, and textiles. In the Old Testament, a craftsman from Tyre is commissioned to build and decorate the legendary Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, which \\"presupposes a well-developed and highly respected craft industry in Phoenicia by the mid-tenth century BC\\". The Iliad mentions the embroidered robes of Priam’s wife, Hecabe, as \\"the work of Sidonian women\\" and describes a mixing bowl of chased silver as \\"a masterpiece of Sidonian craftsmanship.\\" The Assyrians appeared to have valued Phoenician ivory work in particular, collecting vast quantities in their palaces. Phoenician art appears to have been indelibly tied to Phoenician commercial interests. They appear to have crafted goods to appeal to particular trading partners, distinguishing not only different cultures but even socioeconomic classes.

National Museum of Beirut. As was common in antiquity, Phoenician women had few rights and were considered the property of their fathers or husbands. Nonetheless, compared to their counterparts in most of the Mediterranean and western Asia, they appeared to have enjoyed some freedoms. They took part in public events and religious processions, with depictions of banquets showing them casually sitting or reclining with men, dancing, and playing music. In most contexts, however, women were expected to dress and behave more modestly than men; female figures are almost always portrayed as draped from head to feet, with the arms sometimes covered as well. Although they rarely had political power, women took part in community affairs and had some voice in the popular assembles that began to emerge in some city states. At least one woman, Unmiashtart, is recorded to have ruled Sidon in the fifth century BC. The two most famous Phoenician women are political figures: Jezebel, portrayed in the Bible as the assertive princess of Sidon, and Dido, the semi-legendary founder and first queen of Carthage. In Virgil's epic poem the Aeneid, Dido is described as having been the co-ruler of Tyre, using cleverness to escape the tyranny of her brother Pygmalion and to secure an ideal site for Carthage. Religion The religious practices and beliefs of Phoenicia were generally cognate to those of their neighbours in Canaan, which in turn shared characteristics common throughout the ancient Semitic world. Religious rites were primarily for city-state purposes; payment of taxes by citizens was considered in the category of religious sacrifices. Unfortunately, many of the Phoenician sacred writings known to the ancients have been lost. Figure of Ba'al with raised arm, 14th–12th century BC, found at ancient Ugarit (Ras Shamra site), a city at the far north of the Phoenician coast. Musée du Louvre Several Canaanite practices are attested in ancient sources and mentioned by scholars, such as temple prostitution and child sacrifice. Special sites known as \\"Tophets\\" were allegedly used by the Phoenicians \\"to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire\\", and are condemned by Yahweh in the Hebrew bible, particularly in Jeremiah 7:30–32, and in 2nd Kings 23:10 and 17:17. Notwithstanding these and other important differences, cultural and religious similarities between the ancient Hebrews and the Phoenicians persisted. Canaanite religious mythology does not appear as elaborate as their Semitic cousins in Mesopotamia. In Canaan the supreme god was called El (𐤀𐤋, \\"god\\"). The son of El was Baal (𐤁𐤏𐤋, \\"master\\", \\"lord\\"), a powerful dying-and- rising storm god.Here, Baal was used instead of the storm god's name Hadad. Other gods were called by royal titles, such as Melqart, meaning \\"king of the city\\", or Adonis for \\"lord\\". Such epithets may often have been merely local titles for the same deities. The Semitic pantheon was well-populated; which god became primary evidently depended on the exigencies of a particular city- state. Melqart was prominent throughout Phoenicia and overseas, as was Astarte, a fertility goddess with regal and matronly aspects. Religious institutions in Tyre, called (𐤌𐤓𐤆𐤄, \\"place of reunion\\"), did much to foster social bonding and \\"kin\\" loyalty. held banquets for their membership on festival days, and many developed into elite fraternities. Each nurtured congeniality and community through a series of ritual meals, shared together among trusted kin in honor of deified ancestors. In Carthage, which had developed a complex republican system of government, the may have played a role in forging social and political ties among citizens; Carthaginians were divided into different institutions that were solidified through communal feasts and banquets. Such festival groups may also have composed the voting cohort for selecting members of the city-state's Assembly. The Phoenicians made votive offerings to their gods, namely in the form of figurines and pottery vessels. Hundreds of figurines and fragments have been recovered from the Mediterranean, often spanning centuries between them, suggesting they were cast into the sea to ensure safe travels. Since the Phoenicians were a predominately seafaring people, it is speculated that many of their rituals were performed at sea or aboard ships, though the specific nature of these practices is unknown.

A much larger pocket was meanwhile surrounded in Demyansk, about to the northeast. Both were the results of the German retreat following the defeat during the Battle of Moscow.Zabecki, p. 695–696 The air supply of Kholm and Demyansk was successful but led to an overconfidence in the German High Command on the Luftwaffe's ability to supply encircled forces by air, which would lead to disastrous consequences at the Battle of Stalingrad in late 1942 and early 1943.Bourne, p. 155–156 Overview At the Kholm pocket, 5,500 German soldiers held out for 105 days. The pocket was supplied by air but since it was too small for planes to land, supplies had to be dropped in and recovered by the German defenders. Among the airdropped supplies were 35 of the first 50 prototype MKb 42(H) rifles. Most of the German units in the pocket were part of the following: * 218th Infantry Division * Reserve-Polizei-Bataillon 65 * Infanterie-Regiment 553 (of the 329th Infantry Division) * Parts of the 123rd Infantry Division * Jagdkommando 8 * III. Bataillon of the Luftwaffenfeldregiment 1 German forces made attempts to relieve the pocket in January, March and May 1942. The first two failed, but the third was successful; the German forces in the pocket had been reduced to 1,200. In July 1942, the Cholm Shield was awarded to the German defenders of the pocket upon the suggestion of Generalmajor Theodor Scherer, similar to the Demyansk Shield.Kholm Shield www.lexikon-der-wehrmacht.de, accessed: 16 December 2011 Scherer was personally awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves by Adolf Hitler for the command of the defence of Kholm. Kholm would be occupied by the Red Army on 21 February 1944. War crimes Members of the Reserve-Polizei-Bataillon 65, a police unit from Gelsenkirchen, were questioned after the war by the state prosecutor in Dortmund for their involvement in ethnic cleansing in Eastern Europe. The unit was found to have taken part in a minimum of 5,000 executions and many deportations to concentration camps.

The technique is generally applied in the three industries mining, recycling and food processing and used in the particle size range between . Since sensor-based sorting is a single particle separation technology, the throughput is proportional to the average particle size and weight fed onto the machine.  Functional principle of sensor-based sorting  The main subprocesses of sensor-based sorting are material conditioning, material presentation, detection, data processing and separation.Kleine, Christopher; Wotruba, Hermann and Robben, Mathilde: A new tool for mining engineers – The sensor- based sorter. Sustainable Development in the Minerals Industry (SDIMI) Conference 2011, Aachen, Germany, Material conditioning includes all operations which prepare the particles for being detected by the sensor. All optical sensors need clean material to be able to detect optical characteristics. Conditioning includes screening and cleaning of the feed material. The aim of the material presentation is the isolation of the particles by creating a single particle layer with the densest surface cover possible without particles touching each other and enough distance to each other allowing for a selective detection and rejection of each single particle.Wotruba, Hermann: Sensor Sorting Technology – Is the Minerals Industry Missing a Chance?. Proceedings of XXIII International Minerals Processing Congress, IMPC 2006, Istanbul, Turkey There are two types of sensor-based sorters: the chute type and the belt type. For both types the first step in acceleration is spreading out the particles by a vibrating feeder followed by either a fast belt or a chute. On the belt type the sensor usually detects the particles horizontally while they pass it on the belt. For the chute type the material detection is usually done vertically while the material passes the sensor in a free fall. The data processing is done in real time by a computer. The computer transfers the result of the data processing to an ultra fast ejection unit which, depending on the sorting decision, ejects a particle or lets it pass.Kleine, Christopher and Wotruba, Hermann: Added value to the mining industry by the integration of sensor based sorting. Aachen international mining symposia, Mineral Resources and Mine Development, Institute of Mining Engineering I, May 26th and 27th 2010, 411-434  Sensor- based ore sorting  Sensor-based ore sorting is the terminology used for sensor-based sorting in the mining industry. It is a coarse physical coarse particle separation technology usually applied in the size range for . Aim is either to create a lumpy product in ferrous metals, coal or industrial minerals applications or to reject waste before it enters production bottlenecks and more expensive comminution and concentration steps in the process. In the majority of all mining processes, particles of sub-economic grade enter the traditional comminution, classification and concentration steps. If the amount of sub-economic material in the above-mentioned fraction is roughly 25% or more, there is good potential that sensor-based ore sorting is a technically and financially viable option. High added value can be achieved with relatively low capital expenditure, especially when increasing the productivity through downstream processing of higher grade feed and through increased overal recovery when rejecting deleterious waste.  Introduction  Sensor-based sorting is a coarse particle separation technology applied in mining for the dry separation of bulk materials. The functional principle does not limit the technology to any kind of segment or mineral application but makes the technical viability mainly depend on the liberation characteristics at the size range , which is usually sorted. If physical liberation is present there is a good potential that one of the sensors available on industrial scale sorting machines can differentiate between valuable and non-valuable particles. The separation is based on features measured with a detection technology that are used to derive a yes/no decision for actuation of usually pneumatic impulses. Sensor-based sorting is a disruptive technology in the mining industry which is universally applicable for all commodities. A comprehensive study examines both the technology's potential and its limitations, whilst providing a framework for application development and evaluation. All relevant aspects, from sampling to plant design and integration into mining and mineral processing systems, are covered.Robben C, Characteristics of sensor-based sorting technology and implementation in mining [Book]. - Shaker Verlag GmbH, in der Schriftenreihe zur Aufbereitung und Veredlung, Other terminologeis used in the industry include ore sorting, automated sorting, electronic sorting, and optical sorting.  Definition  Sensor-based sorting has been introduced by Wotruba and Harbeck as an umbrella term for all applications where particles are singularly detected by a sensor technique and then rejected by an amplified mechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic process.Wotruba, Hermann, und Hartmut Harbeck. \\"Sensor-Based Sorting.\\" In Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, 2010.  Liberation characteristics  As for any other physical separation process, liberation is pre-requisite for possible separation. Liberation characteristics are well known and relatively easy to study for particulate lots in smaller size ranges, e.g. flotation feed and products. The analysis is essential for understanding the possible results of physical separation and relatively easy to conduct in laboratory on a couple of dozens of grams of sample which can be studied using optical methods or such as the QEMSCAN. For larger particles above it is widely known for applications that are treated using density separation methods, such as coal or iron ore. Here, the washability analysis can be conducted on sample masses up to 10 tonnes in equipped laboratories. For sensor-based sorting, where laboratory methods can only tell about the liberation characteristics where the describing feature is the density (e.g. iron ore, coal), hand counting, single-particle tests and bulk tests can reveal the liberation characteristics of a bulk material: Hereby, only single particle tests reveal the true liberation, while hand counting and bulk testing give a result which also incorporates the separation efficiency of the type of analysis. More information on the testing procedures used in technical feasibility evaluation can be found in the respective chapter.  Historical development  The oldest form of mineral processing practiced since the Stone Age is hand-picking. Georgius Agricola also describes hand-picking is his book De re metallica in 1556.Agricola G De Re Metallica Libri XII [Book]. - Wiebaden : Fourier Verlag GmbH 2003, 1556. Sensor-based sorting is the automation and extension to hand picking. In addition to sensors that measure visible differences like color (and the further interpretation of the data regarding texture and shape), other sensors are available on industrial scale sorters that are able to measure differences invisible for the human eye (EM, XRT, NIR). The principles of the technology and the first machinery has been developed since the 1920s (.Sweet A T [Patent] : 1678884. - United States of America, 1928. Nevertheless, widely applied and standard technology it is only in the industrial minerals and gemstone segments. Mining is benefiting from the step change developments in sensing and computing technologies and from machine development in the recycling and food processing industries. In 2002, Cutmore and Eberhard stated that the relatively small installed base of sensor-based sorters in mining is more a result of insufficient industry interest than any technical barriers to their effective use Cutmore, N. G. and Eberhardt, J. E. “The future of ore sorting in sustainable processing”. Cairns, Australia : s.n., 2002. Processing Conference 2002. Nowadays sensor- based sorting is beginning to reveal its potential in various applications in basically all segments of mineral production (industrial minerals, gemstones, base-metals, precious metals, ferrous metals, fuel). Precondition is physical liberation in coarse size ranges (~) to make physical separation possible. Either the product fraction, but more often the waste fraction needs to be liberated. If liberation is present, there is good potential that one of available detection technologies on today's sensor-based sorters can positively or negatively identify one of the two desired fractions.  Feed preparation  A size range coefficient of approximately three is advisable. A minimum amount of undersized fine material must enter the machines to optimize availability. Moisture of the feed is not important, if the material is sufficiently dewatered and the undersize fraction is efficiently removed. For surface detection technologies sometimes spray water on the classifying screen is required to clean the surfaces. Surface detection technologies would otherwise measure the reflectance of the adhesions on the surface and a correlation to the particle's content is not given.  Main machine types  During the more than 80 years of technical development of sensor-based ore sorting equipment, various types of machines have been developed. This includes the channel-type, bucket-wheel type and cone type sorters.Clayton C G and Spackman R Gold ore sorting Nr. 4830193 [Patent]. - United States of America, Dec 29 1987.Blagden T and Verboomen J Clean coal at the speed of light [Report]. - Caboolture, Australia : Australian Coal Industry's Research Program (ACARP) Project No C13052, 2009. The main machine types being installed in the mining industry today are belt-type and chute-type machines. Harbeck made a good comparison of both disadvantages and advantages of the systems for different sorting applications.Harbeck H and Kroog H New developments in sensor-based sorting [Journal] // Aufbereitungs Teechnik 49. - 2008. - pp. 4-11. The selection of a machine-type for an application depends various case-dependent factors, including the detection system applied, particle size, moisture, yield amongst others. = Chute-type machine = The chute-type machine has a lower footprint and fewer moving parts which results in lower investment and operating costs. In general, it is more applicable to well liberated material and surface detection, because a double sided scanning is possible on a more reliable on the system. The applicable top size of the chute-type machine is bigger, as material handling of particles up to is only technically viable on this setup. Side view and working principle of chute-type sensor-based ore sorting machine The cost for most average farmers and industry workers is around half a grand for the study and ergonomic design of the sensor. The sensor itself is still a prototype not yet built but looking to be approved by fda around 2003 = Belt-type machine = The belt-type machine is generally more applicable to smaller and to adhesive feed. In addition, the feed presentation is more stable which makes it more applicable for more difficult and heterogienous applications. Side view and working principle of belt-type sensor-based ore sorting machine  Sub-processes  The separation in both machine types comprises the following sub-processes: = Feed distribution = A sized screen fraction with a size range coefficient (d95/d5) of 2-5 (optimal 2-3) is fed onto a vibratory feeder which has the function to create a mono-layer, by pre-accelerating the particles. A common misunderstanding in plant design is, that you can use the vibratory feeder to discharge from a buffer bunker but a separate units needs to be applied, since the feed distribution is very important to the efficiency of the sensor-based sorter and different loads on the feeder change its position and vibration characteristics. = Presentation = The feed is then transferred to the presentation mechanism which is the belt or the chute in the two main machine types respectively. This sub-process has the function to pass single particles of the material stream in a stable and predictable manner, thus in a unidirectional movement orthogonal to the detection line with uniform speed profile. = Detection = In the detection sub-process location and property vectors are recorded to allow particle localization for ejection and material classification for discrimination purposes. All detection technologies applied have in common to be cheap, contactless and fast. The technologies are subdivided in transmitting and reflecting groups, the first measuring the inner content of a particle while the later only uses the surface reflection for discrimination. Surface, or reflection technologies have the disadvantage that the surfaces need to be representing the content, thus need to be clean from clay and dust adhesions. But by default surface reflection technologies violate the Fundamental Sampling Principle because not all components of a particle have the same probability of being detected. The main transmitting technologies are EM (Electromagnetics) and XRT (X-ray- Transmission). EM detection is based on the conductivity of the material passing an alternating electromagnetic field. The principle of XRT is widely known through the application in medical diagnostics and airport luggage scanners. The main surface or reflection technologies are traditionally X-ray luminescence detectors capturing the fluorescence of diamonds under the excitation of X-ray radiation and color cameras detecting brightness and colour difference. Spectroscopic methods such as near-infrared spectroscopy known from remote sensing in exploration in mining for decades, have found their way into industrial scale sensor-based sorters. Advantage of the application of near-infrared spectroscopy is that the evidence can be measured on the presence of specific molecular bonds, thus minerals composition of the near-infrared active minerals.Wotruba, H., Robben, M.R., Balthasar, D., Near- infrared sensor-based sorting in the minerals industry. In Proc. Conference in minerals engineering. Luleå Technical University, Lulea (Sweden), 2009, pp. 163–176) There is more detection technologies available on industrial scale sensor-based ore sorters. Readers that want to go into detail can find more in the literature. = Data processing = Spectral and spatial is collected by the detection system. The spatial component catches the position of the particles distribution across the width of the sorting machine, which is then used in case the ejection mechanism is activated for a single particle. Spectral data comprises the features that are used for material discrimination. In a superseding processing step, spectral and spatial can be combined to include patterns into the separation criterion. Huge amount of data is collected in real time multiple processing and filtering steps are bringing the data down to the Yes/no decision – either for ejecting a particle or for keeping the ejection mechanism still for that one. = Ejection = The state-of-the-art mechanism of today's sensor-based ore sorters is a pneumatic ejection. Here, a combination of high speed air valves and an array of nozzles perpendicular to the acceleration belt or chute allows precise application of air pulses to change the direction of flight of single particles. The nozzle pitch and diameter is adapted to the particle size. The air impulse must be precise enough to change the direction of flight of a single particle by applying the drag force to this single particle and directing it over the mechanical splitter plate.  Installations  Sensor- based sorting installations normally comprise the following basic units; crusher, screen, sensor-based sorter and compressor. There are principally two different kinds of installations that are described in the following paragraphs – stationary and semi-mobile installations. = Semi-mobile installations = Transportable semi-mobile installations have gained increasing popularity in the last two decades. They are enabled by the fact that complete sensor-based sorting systems are relatively compact in relation to the capacity in tonnes per hour. This is mainly because little infrastructure is needed. The picture shows a containerised sensor-based sorter which is applied in Chromitite sorting. The system is operated in conjunction with a Diesel-powered mobile crusher and screen. Material handling of the feed, undersize fraction, product and waste fraction is conducted using a wheel loader. The system is powered by a Diesel generator and a compressor station delivers the instrument quality air needed for the operation. Semi- mobile installations are applied primarily to minimise material handling and save transport costs. Another reason for choosing the semi-mobile option for an installation is bulk testing of new ore bodies. Capacity of a system very much depends on the size fraction sorted, but a 250tph capacity is a good estimate for semi-mobile installations, considering a capacity of 125tph sorter feed and 125tph undersize material. During the last decade both generic plant designs and customised designs have been developed, for example in the framework of the i2mine project.i2mine Innovative technologies and concepts for the intelligent deep mine of the future – European Commission under the Cooperation Programme of the 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development in the 'Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materi [Online] // Project overview. - 2012. - 22 May 2012. - http://www.i2mine.eu/. Containerised sensor-based ore sorter applied in a modular plant operated as semi-mobile installation = Stationary installations = To cope with high volume mass flows and for application, where a changing physical location of the sensor-based sorting process is of no benefit for the financial feasibility of the operation, stationary installations are applied. Another reason for applying stationary installations are multistage (Rougher, Scavenger, Cleaner) sensor-based ore sorting processes. Within stationary installations, sorters are usually located in parallel, which allows transport of the discharge fractions with one product and one waste belt respectively, which decreases plant footprint and amount of conveyors.  Positions in the flow-sheet  = Lumpy ore production = For higher grade applications such as ferrous metals, coal and industrial minerals, sensor-based ore sorting can be applied to create a final product. Pre-condition is, that the liberation allows for the creation of a sellable product. Undersize material is usually bypassed as product, but can also be diverted to the waste fraction, if the composition does not meet the required specifications. This is case and application dependant. Simplified flow-sheet for lumpy ore production = Waste rejection = Most prominent example of the application of sensor-based ore sorting is the rejection of barren waste before transporting and comminution. Waste rejection is also known under the term pre-concentration. A discrimination has been introduced by Robben. Rule of thumb is that at least 25% of liberated barren waste must be present in the fraction to be treated by sensor-based ore sorting to make waste rejection financially feasible. Reduction of waste before it enters comminution and grinding processes does not only reduce the costs in those processes, but also releases the capacity that can be filled with higher grade material and thus implies higher productivity of the system. A prejudice against the application of a waste rejection process is, that the valuable content lost in this process is a penalty higher than the savings that can be achieved. But it is reported in the literature that the overall recovery even increases through bringing higher grade material as feed into the mill. In addition, the higher productivity is an additional source of income. If noxious waste such as acid consuming calcite is removed, the downstream recovery increases and the downstream costs decrease disproportionally as reported for example by Bergmann.Bergmann, J. Sensor-Based Sorting – Experience, Technology and Opportunities. Falmouth, UK : Minerals Engineering International, 2011. Proceedings of Physical Separation 2011. The coarse waste rejected can be an additional source of income if there is a local market for aggregates. Simplified flow-sheet for waste rejection with sensor-based ore sorting = Marginal ore treatment = Sensor-based ore sorting is financially especially attractive for low grade or marginal ore or waste dump material. This described scenario describes that waste dump material or marginal ore is sorted and added to the run-of-mine production. The needed capacity for the sensor-based ore sorting step is less in this case such as the costs involved. Requirement is that two crude material streams are fed in parallel, requiring two crushing stations. Alternatively, marginal and high grade ore can be buffered on an intermediate stockpile and dispatched in an alternating operation. The latter option has the disadvantage that the planned production time, the loading, of the sensor-based ore sorter is low, unless a significant intermediate stockpile or bunker is installed. Treating the marginal ore separately has the advantage that less equipment is needed since the processed material stream is lower, but it has the disadvantage that the potential of the technology is not unfolded for the higher grade material, where sensor- based sorting would also add benefit. Simplified flow-sheet for marginal ore treatment with sensor-based ore sorting = Sensor-based ore sorting in pebble-circuit of autogenious and semi-autogenious mills = Pebble circuits are a very advandageous location for the application of sensor-based ore sorters. Usually it is hard waste recirculating and limiting the total mill capacity. In addition, the tonnage is significantly lower in comparison to the total run-of-mine stream, the size range is applicable and usually uniform and the particles' surfaces are clean. High impact on total mill capacity is reported in the literature.K. Seerane (Rio Tinto Group) and G. Rech (CommodasUltrasort), \\"Investigation of sorting technology to remove hard pebbles and recover copper bearing rocks from an autogenious mill circuit\\", The Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy (SAIMM) 6th Southern African Base Metals Conference 2011, Phalaborwa, Republic of South Africa Simplified flow-sheet for waste and scats removal with sensor-based ore sorting from a pebble circuit  Ore-type diversion  Sensor-based sorting can be applied to separate the coarse fraction of the run-of-mine material according to its characteristics. Possible separation criteria are grade, mineralogy, grade and grindability amongst others. Treating different ore types separately results either in an optimised cash flow in the sense, that revenue ist shifted to an earlier point in time, or increased overall recovery which translates to higher productivity and thus revenue. If two separate plant lines are installed, the increased productivity must compensate for the overall higher capital expenditure and operating costs. Simplified flow-sheet of ore type diversion with sensor-based ore sorting  Economic impact  Sensor-based ore sorting is in comparison to other coarse particle separation technologies relatively cheap. While the costs for the equipment itself are relatively high in capital expenditure and operating costs, the absence of extensive infrastructure in a system results in operating costs that are to be compared to jigging. The specific costs are very much depending on the average particle size of the feed and on the ease of the separation. Coarser particles imply higher capacity and thus less costs. Detailed costing can be conducted after the mini-bulk stage in the technical feasibility evaluation. Prejudice against waste rejection with sensor-based sorting widely spread, that the loss of valuables, thus the recovery penalty of this process, supersedes the potential downstream cost savings and is therefore economically not viable. It must be noted that for waste rejection the aim for the separation with sensor- based ore sorting must be put onto maximum recovery, which means that only low grade or barren waste is rejected because the financial feasibility is very much sensitive to that factor. Nevertheless, through the rejection of waste before comminution and concentration steps, recovery can be often increased in the downstream process, meaning that the overall recovery is equal or even higher than the one in the base case, meaning that instead of losing product, additional product can be produced, which adds the additional revenue to the cost savings on the positive side in the cash flow. If the rejected material is replaced with additional higher grade material, the main economic benefit unfolds through the additional production. It implies, that in conjunction with sensor-based ore sorting, the capacity of the crushing station is increased, to allow for the additional mass-flow that is subsequently taken out by the sensor-based ore sorters as waste.  Technical feasibility testing  = Bulk characterisation = Precondition for the applicability of sensor-based ore sorting is the presence of liberation at the particle size of interest. Before entering into sensor-based ore sorting testing procedures there is the possibility to assess the degree of liberation through the inspection of drill cores, hand-counting and washability analysis. The quantification of liberation does not include any process efficiencies, but gives an estimate of the possible sorting result and can thus be applied for desktop financial feasibility analysis. Drill core analysis Both for green- field and brown-field applications, inspection of drill core in combination with the grade distribution and mineralogical description is a good option for estimation of the liberation characteristics and the possible success of sensor-based ore sorting. In combination with the mining method and mine plan, an estimation of possible grade distribution in coarse particles can be done.  Hand counting  Hand-counting is a cheap and easy to conduct method to estimate the liberation characteristics of a bulk sample wither originating from run-of-mine material, a waste dump or for example exploration trenching. Analysis of particles in the size range 10-100mm has been conducted on a total sample mass of 10 tonnes. By visual inspection of trained personnel, a classification of each particle into different bins (e.g. lithology, grade) is possible and the distribution is determined by weighing each bin. A trained professional can quickly estimate the efficiency of a specific detection and process efficiency of sensor-based ore sorting knowing the sensor response of the mineralogy of ore in question and other process efficiency parameters.  Washability analysis  The washability analysis is widely known in bulk material analysis, where the specific density is the physical property describing the liberation and the separation results, which is then in the form of the partition curve. The partition curve is defined as the curve which gives as a function of a physical property or characteristic, the proportions in which different elemental classes of raw feed having the same property are split into separate products.Sanders G J The principles of coal preparation [Book]. - Newcastle, Australia: Australian Coal Preparation Society, 2007. - Vol. IV. It is thus per its definition not limited to, but predominantly applied in analysis of liberation and process efficiency of density separation processes. For sensor-based ore sorting, the partition (also called Tromp) curves for chromite, iron ore and coal are known and can thus be applied for process modelling.  Single particle testing  Single particle testing is an extensive but powerful laboratory procedure developed by Tomra. Outo of a sample set of multiple hundreds of fragments in the size range 30-60mm are measured individually on each of the available detection technologies. After recording of the raw data, all the fragments are comminute and assayed individually which then allows plotting of the liberation function of the sample set and in addition, the detection efficiency of each detection technology in combination with the calibration method applied. This makes the evaluation of detection and calibration and subsequently the selection of the most powerful combination possible. This analysis is possible to be applied on quarters or half sections of drill core.  (Mini-) bulk testing  Mini-bulk tests are conducted with 1-100t of samples on industrial scale sensor-based ore sorters. The size fraction intervals to be treated are prepared using screen classifications. Full capacity is established then with each fraction and multiple cut-points are programmed in the sorting software. After creating multiple sorting fractions in rougher, scavenger and cleaner steps these weighed are sent for assays. The resulting data delivers all input for flow-sheet development. Since the tests are conducted on industrial scale equipment, there is no scale-up factor involved when designing a flow-sheet and installation of sensor-based ore sorting.  Bulk/ pilot testing  To gather relevant statistical data higher sample masses are needed in some cases. Thus, transportation of the sample into the mini-bulk testing facility becomes unviable and the equipment is set up in the field. Containerised units in conjunction with Diesel-powered crushing and screening equipment are often applied and used for production test runs under full scale operating conditions.  Process efficiency  The process efficiency of sensor-based ore sorting is described in detail by C. Robben in 2014. The total process efficiency is subdivided into the following sub-process efficiencies; Platform efficiency, preparation efficiency, presentation efficiency, detection efficiency and separation efficiency. All the sub-process contribute to the total process efficiency, of course in combination with the liberation characteristics of the bulk material that the technology is applied to. The detailed description of the sib-processes and their contribution to the total process efficiency can be found in the literature.

Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) Oxford University Press 2009 cleaving) is an ancient technique used in carpentry to make lumber for making wooden objects, some basket weaving, and to make firewood. Unlike wood sawing, the wood is split along the grain using tools such as a hammer and wedges, splitting maul, cleaving axe, side knife, or froe. Woodworking In woodworking carpenters use a wooden siding which gets its name, clapboard,\\"Clapboard\\" def. 1., 2., and 3. Whitney, William Dwight, and Benjamin E. Smith. The Century dictionary and cyclopedia. vol. 2. New York: Century Co., 1901. 1027. Print. from originally being split from logs—the sound of the plank against the log being a clap. This is used in clapboard architecture and for wainscoting. Coopers use oak clapboards to make barrel staves. Split-rail fences are made with split wood. Basket making Some Native Americans traditionally make baskets from Black ash by pounding the wood with a mallet and pulling long strips from the log. Firewood Log splitting is the act of splitting firewood from logs that have been pre-cut into sections (rounds, bolts, billets\\"billet, n 2. 1 a.\\" Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 2009 CD-rom). This can be done by hand, using an axe or maul, or by using a mechanical log splitter.https://www.woodsmanreport.com/how-to-split-wood-by-hand/ When splitting a log by hand, it is best to aim for the cracks (called checks), if there are any visible. Some types of wood are harder to split than others, including extremely hard woods, as well as types like gum which an axe will often bounce off of, and cherry, which is typically so twisted it's near impossible to get a clean split, and elm. Any type of wood, being thick or tall, having large knots or twisted grain can make it difficult to split. In some cases, it is easiest to aim for the edges and split the log into multiple pieces. Batoning is splitting small pieces of wood for kindling or other purposes sometimes with a batoning chisel, a special chisel with one sharp side used for splitting. Advantages The advantages of splitting wood along its grain, rather than sawing it is that the wood is much stronger. Due to this, it was historically used for building ships (e.g. drekars) and traditional skis.Happy People: A year in the Taiga, A defining feature of shakes, which are like shingles, are that they are split rather than sawn and because the cell structure of the wood remains intact may be more durable, and similarly trunnels when split are stronger than when sawn. Prevention Sometimes wood splitting is undesirable. Methods to prevent splitting in woodworking are the butterfly joint, truss connector plates, or metal straps. Columns may be hollowed in the center to prevent splitting. Nail points may be blunted or pilot holes drilled to prevent splitting of lumber while nailing or screwing. End grain sealers are liquid products usually containing wax which helps prevent rapid drying of the ends of lumber resulting in splits. Metal end plates or S-shaped pieces of metal may be driven into the butt ends of a timber. Splitting is the primary reason building codes do not allow notching in the bottom of joists and beams.

Deadheading is a widespread form of pruning, since fading flowers are not as appealing and direct a lot of energy into seed development if pollinated. The goal of deadheading is thus to preserve the attraction of the plants in beds, borders, containers and hanging baskets, as well as to encourage further blooming. Deadheading flowers with many petals, such as roses, peonies, and camellias prevents them from littering. Deadheading can be done with finger and thumb or with pruning shears, knife, or scissors. Ornamental plants that do not require deadheading are those that do not produce a lot of seed or tend to deadhead themselves. These include lobelias, salvias, and fuchsias. Deadheading is undesirable if the plant's seed is enjoyed by birds, as is the case with many species from the sunflower family. Likewise, if the plant bears attractive seeds or fruits, deadheading is normally avoided.

The family's origin goes back to the 13th century, in 1248, when King Béla IV of Hungary granted land to Miloth, son of Bosin. Miloth, ancestor of Lipthay's was the only of the family surviving the battle of Muhi of 11 April 1241. Zaád, son of Miloth, grandson of Bosin, exchanged his inheritance with King Charles I of Hungary for Lubelle in Liptó County in year 1341. The property remained until 1945 in hands of the noble branches of the family. In 1435, the family name of the great-grandson of Zaád, Bálint I was Lipthay de Lubelle. His descendants, in 1465, granted with land in Kisfalud, Nógrád County by King Mathias Corvinus I, were adding the name of the place - Kisfalud - to the family's last name. Out of the flourishing noble branches of the family, two lines got the hereditary title of baron. The eldest baron line, until 1945 at its domain of Lovrin, in Temes County, a property granted to the family per Royal Decree on 4 April 1791, was bestowed with the hereditary title of baron Liber Regius (Imperial and Royal Records). Baron title granted to Lipthay's elder line in Vienna on 11 June 1830, registered LB Vol. LXV p. 583. with membership at the Hungarian Parliaments Upper House. The title and diploma was forwarded in Vienna by Emperor Francis I and King of Hungary, to Frigyes, son of Field Marshal Antal Lipthay de Kisfalud et Lubelle, Knight of the Maria Therese Military Order, on 11 June 1830, later ratified in 1886.

He also served as Minister of Justice from 24 March 1956 to 9 January 1957. Biography Moeljatno was born in Surakarta, Dutch East Indies on 10 May 1909. The eldest son of Wiryo Kartojo and his wife, he showed himself to be a hard worker and dedicated to his family. He finished his primary education at the Europese Lagere School in Boyolali, Central Java, graduating in 1918. He then returned to Surakarta, where he studied at a Middelbaar Uitgebreid Lager Ondewijs (middle school); he graduated in 1924. He graduated from the city's Algemene Middlebaar School in 1927. Aside from his formal education, Moeljatno also studied Islam under his uncle, Soekiman Wirjosandjojo. After finishing his secondary education, Moejanto moved to Batavia to attend the Rechts Hoge School (law school) there. After graduating in 1936, he moved to Yogyakarta and took a job working for its sultanate. In 1939 he took a job at the High Islamic Court, serving until 1942. After the Japanese invaded the Indies, he moved to Jakarta to work at the prosecutor's office (Kensatukan Kooto Kensatu Kyoku). After Indonesia's independence in 1945, Moeljatno began working as high prosecutor. In 1946 he joined Minister of Justice Soepomo and several other Ministry of Justice employees in formulating Law Number 1 of 1946, which applied the criminal code throughout the United States of Indonesia. In 1947, he was promoted to Deputy Chief Prosecutor under Tirtawinata. He was stationed in Yogyakarta, where he was invited to teach at the newly established faculty of law at Gadjah Mada University. When he quit his job as prosecutor in 1952, he dedicated himself exclusively to teaching. On 24 March 1956, Moeljatno was selected to be Minister of Justice during the Second Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet; his selection was heavily influence by the Masyumi Party. However, he often came into conflict with Prosecutor General Soeprapto over their differing viewpoints on the role of the prosecutor general's office. At the time it was a branch of the Ministry of Justice, having inherited the arrangement from the Dutch colonial system; however, Soeprapto believed that the function of the prosecutor general was half executive and half judicial and as such demanded to be accountable only to the cabinet. As Moeljatno was held responsible for the actions of the prosecution, he pushed to keep the status quo by drafting legislation which explicitly made the prosecutor general subservient to the Minister of Justice. After it was passed by the cabinet in October 1956, Moeljatno received heavy opposition from the police and prosecutor's office. Moeljatno resigned as Minister of Justice on 9 January 1957, and when the cabinet fell in mid-March, the bill was dropped. Moeljatno then returned to teaching, serving as dean of the faculty of law at Gadjah Mada University from 1957 to 1958; he later served twice more as dean of law. Moeljatno died on 25 November 1971 and was buried in Gadjah Mada Cemetery in Yogyakarta. Professors Haryono of Gadjah Mada University and Prabuningrat, rector of the Islamic University of Indonesia, delivered eulogies at the funeral. Legacy Moeljatno's outline of the fundamentals of Indonesian criminal law continues to be used by legal students and practitioners. Personal life Moeljatno was married to Lamya Moeljatno, a fellow lecturer at Gadjah Mada University.

Eden was given the squad number 5 prior to the start of the season, and played the majority of matches on Castleford's left wing. He scored 38 Super League tries in his first season back at Castleford, including 5 hat-tricks against Leeds twice, Widnes, Leigh and Warrington. Eden topped the try scoring charts and was named in the Super League Dream Team for this season. He played at fullback in the 2017 Super League Grand Final defeat by the Leeds Rhinos at Old Trafford, after Zak Hardaker was suspended two days before the game following a failed drugs test. Eden's excellent strike rate for the Tigers was rewarded with a three-year contract extension in 2018. However, his season was limited to just 15 appearances following a hamstring injury. Despite this, he still scored 18 tries. In the first match of 2020, Eden scored a trademark length-of-the-field try against Toronto Wolfpack, before hyper extending his knee in the second half.  International career  In September 2012 Eden was selected in the England Knights squad. Eden made his international début for England Knights on 28 October 2012 in the 62-24 Alitalia Cup series win over Scotland at the Meggetland Stadium in Edinburgh. Career records Castleford's most tries scored in a match record is 5-tries, and is jointly held by; Derek Foster against Hunslet on 10 November 1972, John Joyner against Millom on 16 September 1973, Stephen Fenton against Dewsbury on 27 January 1978, Ian French against Hunslet on 9 February 1986, St. John Ellis against Whitehaven on 10 December 1989, and Greg Eden against Warrington on 11 June 2017. Eden became the first player to achieve this for Castleford in the Super League era. Eden's 41 tries for Castleford in 2017 places him second for the most tries scored in a single season for Castleford, behind Denny Solomona's 42 in 2016, ahead of St. John Ellis' 40 in 1993-94. Eden's 38 Super League tries in 2017 places him second for the most tries scored in a single Super League season, behind Denny Solomona's 40 in 2016, ahead of Lesley Vainikolo's 36 in 2004. Eden holds the record for fastest hat-trick in rugby league history; his treble against Leigh on 29 May 2017 took just 4 minutes 59 seconds, beating Shaun Johnson's record 6 minutes 30 seconds for the New Zealand Warriors against the Canberra Raiders in 2013. Eden is believed to hold the record for the most consecutive hat-tricks; in 2017, he scored trebles in 4 successive matches (against St Helens, Leeds, Widnes and Leigh), which is believed to be a first in the professional game.

He had several works published on that theme. Silberman lives in New York, is a US citizen and works as a consultant engineer.\\"David Silberman — A Witness for Our Time\\"  Defending History by Roland Binet (Belgium)  Early life and education  Silberman (Zilberman prior to immigration to USA) was born in Preili, Latvia on February 10, 1934. The Silberman family fled the German invasion of their home-town at the end of June 1941 and spent most of the war years in the Tatar region of the USSR. David Silberman graduated in 1957 as an engineer from the Tallinn Polytechnical Institute (Estonia). In 1959, he met and married Bella Tartakovskaya, and the couple raised two children, Emil and Gabriel (Originally Gregory). Activism In the 1960s, he joined a collective of Jewish activists intent on collecting facts, testimony and documents from survivors of the Holocaust living in Latvia at that time.Jews in Eastern Europe, Issue 25. The Centre, 1994 On March 10 and 11, 1971, he and 55 fellow Jews from Latvia organized a sit-in and hunger strike within the Reception Hall of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in Moscow, handing a manifesto to the authorities in charge with a request to allow the Latvian Jews free emigration to Israel. He received permission to emigrate to Israel in April 1971. Silberman lived in Israel for a number of years, had several works published in that country, and served as a reservist during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. He moved to the United States in 1977 to pursue his career. He now lives in New York City, has become a US citizen, and is still active as a consultant engineer.

Jerusalem PostSurviving the Shoah – and beating Israeli bureaucracy  JPost  Israel News  Reporting on the Holocaust  Because many of the Jewish people who survived the Holocaust were unable, or found it too upsetting, to relate their experiences in readable stories, at the end of the 1950s David Silberman and other activists began to covertly gather information from Jewish survivors of the Holocaust living in Latvia. Silberman met two of the four known survivors of the Rumbula Forest massacres of November and December 1941 (near Riga); these recounted their survival stories to Silberman, as did many other survivors of the Holocaust. He rewrote these stories into readable material, which he began circulating and later publishing. Serge Klarsfeld, the well known French Nazi-hunter and historian of the Holocaust called David Silberman a \\"pioneer in the historical research\\". Distinguished historian, Marger Vesterman, director of the 'Museum of the Jews of Latvia' in Riga had this to say about David Silberman: \\"during decades he collected a great amount of testimony from survivors of the Holocaust that are now of a considerable historical and teaching value.'Ia Perejila Rumbulu', , Moscow 2011, page 172 Silberman's first published work, in 1966, was The Right to Live - A Documentary Eyewitness Account of a Survivor, telling the story of Ella Medalye, a survivor from the Rumbula Forest (near Riga) massacre where, during just two days, some 28,000 Jews from the Riga ghetto were killed by bullets. In 1973, while living in Israel, David Silberman transcribed and adapted in Russian the writings that Frieda Michelson, also a survivor from the Rumbula forest killings, had originally written in Yiddish. This material was first published under the title Ia Perejila Rumbuli (I Survived Rumbula) by the kibbutz Lokhamei Agetaot. Well- known historian of the Holocaust in Latvia, Andrew Ezergailis, mentioned these two books as references in his staple work on that subject.The Holocaust in Latvia 1941-1944 , The Historical Institute of Latvia - The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, 1996, (notes 78 and 88 pages 268-269 for Ella Medalye's account, and notes 46, 59, 81, 85 pages 267-269 for Frieda Michelson's account). In 1989, Silberman's most ambitious work, entitled I Ty Eto Videl (and You saw it), was published in the United States by the Jewish publishing company Slovo (the Word). This details the German killing of Jews in Latvia and the Ukraine during World War II from the point of view of the intended victims. This book was brought to the attention of Serge Klarsfeld, and it was translated into French and published in 2011.'the Beate Klarsfeld Foundation' under the title La Fosse - la Ferme aux Poux et autres témoignages sur la Shoah en Lettonie et Ukraine rassemblés par David Silberman (the Pit - the Lice Factory and other testimony related to the Shoah in Latvia and the Ukraine collected by David Silberman), Imprimeur SIA \\"BOTA\\" Riga/Latvia, copyright 2006 David Silberman. The book contains an introduction by Klarsfeld,La Fosse - la Ferme aux ¨Poux et autres témoignages sur la Shoah en Lettonie et Uklraine rassemblés par David Silberman (page 3) David Silberman also wrote the story of Jan Lipke, a Latvian patriot who saved the lives of between 50 and 60 Jews from the Riga ghetto or Arbeitskommandos, hiding them, feeding them, and arming them, until liberation by the Soviet Army. Lipke received the 'Righteous among the Nations' medal in Yad Vashem, Israel, for these actions. Jan Lipke: An Unusual Man was first published in the USA in 1987 as part of Muted Voices, later published in 2006 in Riga in a longer version under the title Like a Star in the Darkness - Recollections about Janis (Zhan) Lipke.

Mallinckrodt noted that a certain shiny brass electric light socket did not feel as smooth when the light was burning as it did with the light off\\". Then Mallinckrodt created a setup to investigate the effect scientifically. He connected an aluminum plate through a variable current-limiting resistor to a 60 Hz, 110 V power supply. Half of the aluminum plate was coated with an insulating varnish, while the rest was left uncoated. As a result of the test he identified that the feeling of friction only appears when there is an insulating barrier between the conductive surface and the sliding finger. He concluded that the finger gets electrically polarized, and this induced charge creates a force between that finger and the surface. He named this phenomenon \\"electrically induced vibrations\\".  Electrostatic-force theory  An electrostatic force is created by applying a time-varying voltage between an electrode and an insulated ground plane. When a finger scans over an insulated plate with a time-varying voltage, the finger works as the induced ground plane. The induced static electricity creates an electric force field between the finger and the surface. A parallel-plate capacitor model can be used to approximate the skin–surface interface. The electrode acts as one plate, while the conductive subcutaneous layer in the skin acts as the other, thus representing a hybrid natural/artificial electrostatic actuator.Agarwal, A. K.; Nammi, K.; Kaczmarek, K. A.; Tyler, M. E.; Beebe, D. J. \\"A hybrid natural/artificial electrostatic actuator for tactile stimulation\\", Microtechnologies in Medicine & Biology, 2nd Annual International IEEE-EMB Special Topic Conference (2–4 May 2002), (Abstract) pp. 341–345, 2002. , .

The following equation approximates the electrostatic force experienced between the finger and the electrode: :F_\\\\text{e} = \\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon_0 \\\\varepsilon_r AV^2}{2d^2}, where :\\\\varepsilon_0 – permittivity of free space, :\\\\varepsilon_r – dielectric constant, :A – area of electrodes, :V – voltage applied between the two plates, :d – distance between two plates. The resulting force is too small to perceive by human skin, but when the finger is moving on the surface, a frictional force appears on the moving finger, which can be expressed as :f = \\\\mu F_\\\\text{e}, where \\\\mu is the coefficient of friction. Further research has shown that this model is not sufficient to explain such skin–surface interfaces.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 3 October 2016] The \\"satisfactory value\\" of a good work is its value with regard to making up for one's sins and reducing a person's stay in Purgatory. The term \\"Purgatory\\" does not indicate a Place, but a Condition of Existence. Scripture Offering prayers for the dead is found in 2 Maccabees 12:43-46: > He then took up a collection among all his soldiers, amounting to two > thousand silver drachmas, which he sent to Jerusalem to provide for an > expiatory sacrifice. In doing this he acted in a very excellent and noble > way, inasmuch as he had the resurrection of the dead in view; for if he were > not expecting the fallen to rise again, it would have been useless and > foolish to pray for them in death. But if he did this with a view to the > splendid reward that awaits those who had gone to rest in godliness, it was > a holy and pious thought. Thus he made atonement for the dead that they > might be freed from this sin.NAB, 2 Maccabees 12:43-46 Praying for the dead is among the Spiritual works of mercy. Background Andrea Vaccaro - The Virgin intercedes for the Souls in Purgatory The souls in purgatory can do nothing for themselves. They can no longer merit or give satisfaction or receive the sacraments or gain indulgences. Charity to the suffering souls involves the mystery of the communion of saints:Garrigou- Lagrange O.P., Reginald. \\"Charity for the Poor Souls\\", Life Everlasting, Desclee de Brouwer & cle, Paris A decree of the Sacred Congregation of Indulgences dated 18 December, 1885, and confirmed by Leo XIII, says that \\"The Heroic Act of Charity in favour of the souls detained in purgatory consists in this, that a member of the Church militant (Christifidelis), either using a set formula or simply by an act of his will, offers to God for the souls in purgatory all the satisfactory works which he will perform during his lifetime, and also all the suffrages which may accrue to him after his death.\\" It is a pious custom for those particularly devoted to Mary, to make it a practice to deposit the said suffrages as it were into the hands of the Blessed Virgin that she may distribute these favours to the souls in purgatory according to her own merciful pleasure. It should not be made lightly, but only after serious reflection. This can be done either using a set formula or by a simple act of will. It suffices to have the intention and to make it from the heart. As it is in the nature of an offering rather than a vow, it is revocable. By this act one voluntarily resigns everything that might in any way be acceptable to God as atonement for the punishment incurred by one's own sins.Nageleison, John August. \\"The Heroic Act of Charity for the Suffering Souls\\", Charity for the Suffering Souls, Chapter VI, S. Rosenthal & Co., Cincinnati, 1895 By doing this, one forgoes the lessening of his own time in Purgatory, hence the title Heroic Act. A somewhat frightening thought, one who makes the Heroic Act effectively offers to spend time in Purgatory on behalf of others, as he renounces all opportunities to remit temporal punishment for himself, although there remains the reasonable hope that God in His goodness, and the sainted souls in their gratitude, will not allow the punishment to be exacted to the full. The application of prayers for the souls in Purgatory is subject to the disposition of the will of God. By making this act with purity of intention, one is relying upon the mercy of God. A person who has made the Heroic Act may still pray for himself, friends and other intentions.\\"The Heroic Act\\", The Irish Eccesiastical Record, pp.303-306, Browne and Nolan, 1908 This practice was encouraged by a number of Popes including Benedict XIII (1728), Pius VI (1788) and Pius IX (1852).

National Library of the Philippines  Early life  He was born in Lipa, Batangas on March 31, 1884. He was the third child of police chief Valerio Kalaw and Maria Manguiat. His siblings are Filipino scholar and political scientist Maximo, and two sisters, Rosario and Manuela. He finished his secondary studies at Instituto Rizal in Lipa, Batangas, and finished his bachelor's degree in arts with honors at Liceo de Manila. He took up his law degree at Escuela de Derecho, where he was mentored by Rafael Palma and Juan Sumulong. In 1905, he topped the bar examinations, having obtained \\"grade of 100 percent in civil law and three other subjects\\". He served as secretary of then Philippine Assembly Floor Leader Manuel L. Quezon until 1908.  Journalism  While pursuing law, Kalaw became a writer for El Renacimiento, with Rafael Palma and Fernando Ma. Guerrero. In October 1908, Interior Secretary Dean C. Worcester filed a libel suit against the paper for their editorial entitled, “Aves de Rapiña” (Birds of Prey). The case led to the closure of the paper. On January 1910, the court meted out prison sentences against Kalaw and publisher Martin Ocampo. Both Kalaw and Ocampo were pardoned by Governor General Francis B. Harrison in 1914.  Political career  In 1909, Kalaw was elected the youngest member of the Philippine Assembly at age 25. During his term, he sponsored bills supporting internal migration and agricultural development and maintenance of public schools through municipal taxation. At the end of his term in 1913, he was appointed secretary to the Philippine Assembly. In 1916, he was appointed the first director of the National Library, earning him the moniker \\"Father of the Philippine Library System\\".

G, Quevedo. L, Jacobsen. J, Helles. F (2005) Development and economic significance of forest certification: the case of FSC in Bolivia, Forest Policy and Economics, 7, 175– 186 Most certification services have a logo (commonly known as an ecolabel) which can be applied to products certified under their standards. This is seen as a form of corporate social responsibility allowing companies to address their obligation to minimise the harmful impacts to the environment by voluntarily following a set of externally set and measured objectives.Thompson. D, Anderson. R, Hansen. E, Kahle. L (2009) Green Segmentation and Environmental Certification: Insights from Forest Products, Business Strategy and the Environment, 19(5), 319–334 Motivations for implementation The primary motivations for many companies who choose to implement environmental certification schemes are, to provide an ethical product for the consumers, increelopment , improve the image of the company, gain a better relationship with stakeholders and to make a higher profit. Many companies believe that the implementation of environmental certification programmes can lead to an improved company image and generate competitive advantage. This is usually achieved through the use of ecolabels which can be used on the company's products, allowing the product to stand out as being produced in an environmentally sound way. The ecolabels associated with environmental certification inform consumers that the product in question has been verified by a third party auditor as originating from an environmentally well managed company. Therefore, the certificate gives an indication of good practice and provides the company a better image. This approach allows consumers to steer their purchasing behaviour in a more environmentally sound direction. This also means that if environmental marketing strategies such as environmental certification are to work there must be consumers willing to purchase the resulting green products. There are also ethical motivations for a company to improve its environmental performance and move towards achieving sustainable development. All environmental certification schemes attempt to provide organisations with an effective environmental management system to help them to achieve environmental and economic goals The current high levels of consumption and economic growth often leads to the degradation of land and pollution of the natural environment. The aim of the move towards sustainable development is to ensure the availability of natural resources for future generations. Within environmental certification the life cycle approach is often adopted, where the life cycle of the product from its production to its disposal are followed to ensure that it is produced, used and disposed of in a sustainable and environmentally sound way. There is increasing pressure on companies to respond to environmental pressure from stakeholders, therefore increasing the use of voluntary environmental regulations such as certification to achieve sufficient social legitimacy and to protect their profits. This is a relational motivation as the company feels that environmentally conscious management will help to prevent stakeholder pressures and to form a good relationship with the socio-economic environment. There are also operational motivations which are the belief that environmental certification can help to reduce costs and increase productivity and commercial motivations which are the belief that it can help to increase sales and improve the market position. Examples Carbon Trust Standard Example of Carbon emission label issued by Carbon Trust. The Carbon Trust Standard is an independent certification scheme from The Carbon Trust, certifying an organisation's impact in respect of: * Energy usage and greenhouse gas (CO2e) emissions * Water usage, management and effluent * Waste management and disposal. Its stated aim is to recognize best practice and real achievements in reduction, to help organisations to measure, manage and reduce their environmental impact, whilst improving their resource management and operational sustainability. The certification process aims to identify inefficiencies in resource use and to provide a framework for improving management processes, reducing waste and costs. As of July 2014, over 1,100 organisations have certified to the Carbon Trust Standard. EMAS The Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) is the EU's voluntary environmental resources management instrument. Environmental Management Systems in accordance with EMAS are used worldwide by companies and organisations of all sizes and types. EMAS registered organisations commit themselves to evaluate, manage and improve their environmental performance. EMAS is open to every type of organisation eager to improve its environmental performance. It spans all economic and service sectors and is applicable worldwide. Currently, more than 4,400 organisations and more than 8,150 sites are EMAS registered. Only independent environmental verifiers that are accredited/licensed and supervised by government authorities (Accreditation or Licensing Bodies) are authorised to validate EMAS environmental statements. The external and independent nature of the EMAS registration process ensures the credibility of the scheme and the reliability of the information provided by registered organisations. The ISO 14001: 2004 requirements are a part of EMAS, but EMAS adds several elements to these: * stricter requirements on the measurement and evaluation of environmental performance against set targets according to six environmental core indicators, and the continuous improvement of that environmental performance; * compliance with environmental legislation ensured by government supervision: the compliance check is executed by an independent and external environmental verifier, who is in turn subjected to quality checks by national government authorities (EMAS Competent Bodies, EMAS Accreditation Bodies); * requirement of employee involvement in the continuous performance improvement process; * provision of information to the general public through the obligation to publish an annual public environmental statement that is independently verified; * registration by a public authority after verification by an accredited/licensed environmental verifier; and * registered organisations can use the EMAS logo to communicate their EMAS compliance More than 80 percent of all EMAS registered organizations are small and medium-sized organisations (SMEs).http://ec.europa.eu/environment/emas/documents/articles_en.htm#statistic EMAS has specific provisions in place to facilitate EMAS registration for SMEs. For example, EMASeasy, a lean and standardised methodology, has been developed to facilitate the participation of small and micro businesses in the EMAS Scheme. Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) Example of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) label The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) is a non- profit, nongovernmental organization (NGO) which promotes the responsible management of forests on an international scale. It is widely regarded as one of the most important initiatives for promoting responsible international forest management and was established in 1993 following concerns for global deforestation. The FSC is a voluntary mechanism which involves an inspection of a forest landowners management practices based on criteria for sustainable forest management. This can occur on both privately and publicly owned forests and allows the products manufactured from certified forests to be tracked through the value chain. Certificates are not issued by the FSC but by third party independent organisations called certification bodies. These bodies assess the forest management against FSC standards and audits certificate holders at least once a year to ensure continued compliance with FSC standards. To achieve official recognition as an FSC certification body they must comply with a large set of rules and procedures and also be verified by Accreditation Services International (ASI), the company managing the FSC accreditation program. The FSC provides an internationally recognized standard, trademark assurance and accreditation services for companies, organizations and communities interested in responsible forestry. Products that have been certified can be identified by consumers from the on product ecolabel which provides a globally trusted mark of forest products that benefit people and the environment. This helps a company to protect a brand or reputation and allows certificate holders access to highly environmentally sensitive markets. This provides an example of mainstreaming strategy shaped by retailer dominance of wood commodity networks as it has been supported by the World Bank, USAID, several European governments, influential environmental organizations, and by transnational retailers such as IKEA and The Home Depot and has especially strong market penetration in the United Kingdom, Germany and on the Dutch timber market. The fundamental purpose of the FSC is to allow environmentally aware consumers to use market forces to effectively complement and develop forest policy and to ensure that producer behave in a responsible way according to predefined objectives. As a result of this the FSC has been endorsed by influential NGOs as a means to promote concrete actions regarding forest management, as a platform for stating forest policy principles and values, and as an effective way to gain publicity. The potential benefits of the FSC are said to include ecological, economic and social aspects, therefore the sustainability of forests. The environmental certification process commits forest managers to make improvements to planning and monitoring, implement conservation strategies, reduce the environmental impact from logging and improve the conditions of forest workers. It also demonstrates the success of NGOs in promoting rapid adoption of environmental certification which pushes social and environmental improvements in forest management practices. There have been concerns that the retailer-focused expansion strategy tends to favour large forest enterprises over small ones, northern operations over southern ones, and may be unable to meet the special needs of community forest managers. There has also been a concern that the certification process leaves the burden of costs of both the certification process and wood that is more expensive to produce on the producer without allowing them to charge a higher price for FSC certified products. ISO 14001 Example of ISO 14001 certificate The ISO 14001 is a voluntary international standard created in 1996 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and forms part of the ISO14000 series of environmental standards. This came about as a result of the Uruguay round of the GATT negotiations and the Rio Summit on the Environment held in 1992. At the Uruguay round of the GATT negotiations the need to reduce the non-tariff barriers to trade were discussed whereas at the Rio Summit the commitment to protect the environment at an international scale was argued. This brought about the ISO 14001 which allows firms to inform stakeholders of the implementation of an Environmental Management System (EMS) and specifies the actual requirements for an EMS. The ISO 14001 standard defines EMS as “the general part of management that includes the organizational structure, the activity planning, the responsibilities, the practices, the procedures, the processes and the resources to develop, implement, carry out, and revise the environmental policy and keep it up to date”. Similarly to the FSC ISO 14001 certification can be issued by any third party certification body, (but to prove credibility, such bodies should be accredited (to offer ISO 14001 certification) by organisations such as JAS- ANZ, ANAB, UKAS, and others. These accreditation bodies audit the certification bodies to ensure that the assessment and certification processes are robust and free from conflicts of interest. It provides guidelines and suggestions for matters such as environmental management, environmental auditing, and environmental labelling or lifecycle assessment. It applies to all organisations large or small and covers all sectors if there are environmental aspects that the organisation can control and influence in a positive way. There are other Environmental management system standards that while addressing the requirements of ISO 14001, they have other additional benefits, for example the Eco Warranty standard not only meets the requirements of ISO 14001 but also allows use of the certification logo; this is not allowable with accredited ISO 14001 certification. The implementation of an EMS can be an appropriate step for those companies wanting to move towards a more environmentally aware position. It shows companies how to measure their consumption and reduce waste, also how they can effectively reduce, re-use and recycle to make savings costs, reduce environmental impacts and enhance their environmental credentials. Many organisations that choose to adopt the ISO 14001 are trying to achieve preferred supplier status as it is now often a competitive advantage or a requirement for local authorities or for a supply chain. The benefits of having ISO 14001 certification are seen to be, better management of environmental risks, both now and in the future, increased access to new customers and business partners, demonstration of legal and regulatory compliance, potential for reduced public liability insurance costs and overall cost savings through the reduction of consumption and waste and through recycling. Although this does not guarantee a specific level of improvement in environmental performance there is empirical evidence to suggest that this standard does help to improve the environmental performance of an organisation.  MCERTS  Business emissions to air, land and water are regulated under strict European and UK laws, to protect the environment and human health. If a company in England or Wales needs to comply with these laws it will need a permission from the Environment Agency to operate. This permission usually comes in the form of a permit, which usually requires it to monitor its emissions. Businesses either monitor their emissions all the time, known as continuous monitoring, or at times defined in their permit, known as spot tests or periodic monitoring. In both cases they must meet EA quality requirements. MCERTS is the Environment Agency's Monitoring Certification Scheme. It provides the framework for businesses to meet EA quality requirements. If it complies with MCERTS then the EA can have confidence in the monitoring of emissions to the environment. MCERTS is used to approve instruments, people, laboratories and Environmental Data Management Systems (EDMS).https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/mcerts-performance- standards-and-test-procedures-for-environmental-data-management-software https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/monitoring-emissions-to-air-land- and-water-mcerts See Monitoring Certification Scheme for more details  Blue Planet Friendly certification  Blue Planet Friendly certification Blue Planet Friendly is an environmental certification delivered by a french non- profit organization that serves a global movement for assessing and reducing the pollution generated by companies and cities. The companies and cities certified prove emission reductions by product or inhabitant on a year basis and receive a certification with a level (bronze, silver or gold). Each company or city is physically audited every year. https://www.blueplanetfriendly.org Effects Positive The most obvious benefit of environmental certification is that it is used as in instrument to allow actors to make important improvements to the way the environment is managed and in achieving sustainable development. They are usually used as an indicator of the environmental commitment of the organisation thus allowing the organisations involved to have the advantages attributed to environmental proactivity such as gaining a competitive advantage or environmental productivity. Therefore, the environmental certification generally satisfies the ethical and competitive expectations that lead the company to initiate the certification process. The general scope of the certification process can be looked at by the size of the area that is influenced, either directly or through demonstration of spill-over effects. For example, the FSC since it was established in 1993 has overseen the certification of forests in sixty countries, totalling nearly 50 million ha, and equivalent to perhaps 1.5 percent of the world's total forest area, thus making it a large and inclusive certification process with a wide scope. The benefit of environmental certification for consumers is that they can purchase products with the knowledge of the company's environmental standards and procedures, therefore giving the general public the option to consume in an ethical way. As a result of the ethical production, consumers may be willing to pay an additional price as a way of promoting and sustaining ethical production. Certification has become a differentiating factor that is valued by industrial and financial markets, partly due to its recognition by influential companies in some industries. As a result of this, certification can act as a catalyst for competitive advantage and lead to economic benefits for producers through more efficient production systems, easier market access and price premiums. Environmental certification is most likely to benefit companies that already have an environmental management system, even if the environmental variable is not effectively integrated into the overall process of strategic planning, and firms that are introducing and/or modifying it, or have to develop it in order to respond to the expected evolution of the external context. It may help them to organise or reorganise a well structured environmental system which will enable them to establish and access the effectiveness of existing operating procedures, achieve conformance with them and demonstrate conformance to external actors. Therefore, environmental certification may help these firms to reduce expenses and efforts and develop autonomously an environmental management system which will help them to improve their green image. Certification can also be used by actors in a commodity network to validate their activities. Therefore, the ethical environmental values linked to environmental certification can be tracked at all stages along the commodity network from the producer to the retailer. Negative There are various negative aspects associated with environmental certification one of which is the perception from markets that it is a reactive rather than a proactive investment, meaning that the certification as a standard is initiated as a response to institutional pressure rather than a self-regulation standard showing a desire to move towards a more environmentally sound system. Usually only the best performing operators become certified and approaches operating at the management level cannot always properly address concerns about biodiversity. Also tropical deforestation is usually a result of conversion of land from forest to other land uses, leaving it outside the influence of forest management certification. At an organisational level, firms with no environmental management system and no interest in introducing one will have little incentive to join an environmental certification scheme, therefore leaving any environmental areas affected by these companies unprotected and liable to degradation. Also if the customer base of the company is not prepared to pay extra for environmentally friendly product there can be no incentive for a company to implement environmental certification. The implementation of environmental certification is expensive, the burden of which is usually felt by the supplier rather than the retailer who must pay for the certification fees and the increased cost of production. In many cases the profit a supplier can expect to gain for their product does not compensate for the implementation cost. Many certification costs are fixed therefore large produces gain an advantage on their smaller competitors through economies of scale. The use of forest certification can marginalise small and community forest managers as the costs are shifted onto them without any means for them to make the money back. Therefore, forest certification tends to be most prevalent in extensive and well documented forests in the global north rather than small or community forests in the global south where they would be more likely to gain more significant benefits. The dominance of eco-labelling markets in western developed economies may result in smaller producers and suppliers finding it increasingly difficult to enter the market without environmental certification. As a result of this it has been argued that certification is a means of changing the actions of producers in the global south to serve the interests and alleviate some of the anxieties of consumers in the global north. Currently consumption is central to economic and human development therefore many of the efforts to minimise the threats that consumption poses to the environment and the sustainability of the worlds resources have focused on reducing the impact of producing the goods and services rather than addressing and trying to reduce the level of consumption. This is true for environmental certification as this primarily focuses on reducing the impact that the production of goods has on the environment. When the possible rebound effect of even increasing levels of \\"ethical consumption\\" are taken into consideration, the net result might be detrimental for the environment.

Opened in 1882, it is owned and operated by the Swiss Federal Railways, and forms part of the Gotthard railway, which links northern Switzerland and Immensee with Chiasso and Italy, via the Gotthard Tunnel. The station is located in the village of Seewen in the middle of the Schwyz valley, about northwest of the town centre, between the Grosser Mythen and the Urmiberg. History Schwyz railway station was opened in 1882, as the Gotthardbahn began operations. When the Gotthardbahn was nationalised in 1909, the station came into the ownership of the SBB-CFF-FFS. In 1900, the Schwyzer Strassenbahnen electric tramway opened their first line, from the station to the Schwyz Post stop in the town centre. In 1914 and 1915, the line was extended through the town centre to Brunnen railway station and the Brunnen ferry terminal. The line closed in 1963, and was replaced by bus services. In 1979 and 1980, the entire station was redeveloped. The station building was demolished and replaced with the present, post-modern buildings. Also, the platform system was renewed, and the sidings removed. Facilities The railway facilities at the station include four through tracks, three of which face a railway platform. However, only the middle platform facing tracks 2 (towards Brunnen) and 3 (towards Steinen/Arth- Goldau) is used for scheduled passenger trains. Track 1, facing the main platform, and track 4, which has no platform, are used for overtaking trains. There are also still some sidings and connecting tracks, mainly for the Schwyzerland cheese factory, KIBAG, Arthur Weber Stahl and Zeughausareal Seewen.  Services  The following services stop at Schwyz: * InterRegio: hourly service between and , trains continue to or Zürich Hauptbahnhof. * Zug Stadtbahn : hourly service between Rotkrezu and Flüelen. * Lucerne S-Bahn : hourly service between and Brunnen.  Bus traffic  The bus station is next to the station building and has three bus platforms. Several bus routes operated by the Auto AG Schwyz company link the station with the Schwyz town centre in about five minutes: * Line 1: Lauerz – Schwyz – Muotathal * Line 3: Seewen – Ibach – Schwyz – Rickenbach See also *History of rail transport in Switzerland *Rail transport in Switzerland References Bibliography * External links * Railway stations in the canton of Schwyz Railway stations opened in 1882 Swiss Federal Railways stations Schwyz ","title":"Schwyz railway station"},{"id":"34076978","text":"Polypoetes bifenestra is a moth of the family Notodontidae.

He founded and ran a large workshop in Exeter, Devon, which produced woodwork and sculpture for churches all over the country and abroad. He was also a philanthropist and an eager self-promoter. A large part of the collection of medieval woodwork that he accumulated during his working life is now in the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter. Biography Born in Islington, London, the son of Henry Hems, an ironmonger and cutler, Harry Hems started work as a cutler before taking at age fourteen a seven-year apprenticeship as a woodcarver in Sheffield. Returning to London, he found employment in the construction of the Foreign Office building and the Langham Hotel. He then spent two years seeking inspiration in Italy, but was supposedly arrested as a spy and had to return to England penniless. On his return, however, he soon found work on the building of the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, in Exeter, Devon. When he arrived in Exeter on 4 December 1866 by train he said that he found a horseshoe on his way from the railway station, and kept it as a lucky charm. Hems's \\"Ye Luckie Horseshoe Studio\\", Longbrook Street, Exeter Hems married Charlotte Presswell Turner at Littleham, Exmouth in 1868, and settled in Exeter. He started a company there that specialised in ecclesiastical sculpture and church fittings, and named it \\"The Ecclesiastical Art Works\\". It benefited from the widespread restoration of churches that was taking place at the time: by 1879 more than 400 churches and 100 public buildings contained work that had been created by the company. The 1881 census recorded that he was employing 23 men and 7 boys, and because of the need for more space he commissioned the building of a new workshop on a two-acre plot at 84 Longbrook Street, Exeter. The architect was Robert Medley Fulford who had already worked with Hems on several ecclesiastical designs. The style of his new brick-built workshop has been described variously as \\"'domesticated' or modified Queen Anne Flemish\\", a \\"freely-treated Jacobean character\\", and \\"gothic styled but with several peculiar additions\\". Nikolaus Pevsner called it \\"fanciful\\". It opened in 1883 and was extended the following year. Hems named it \\"Ye Luckie Horseshoe Studio\\". It extends over three floors and has a circular window in the gable facing the road that incorporates Hems's monogram. At the company's peak, after 1895, Hems employed over a hundred craftsmen, and also had staff in London, Oxford and Ireland. He lived next door to his workshop in a house, \\"Fair Park\\", with a prominent corner turret. Hems died on 5 January 1916, his wife having died the previous June. He is buried in Exeter's Upper Cemetery, his grave marked by a tombstone bearing a finely-carved crucifixion. He was survived by seven children; a son whom he christened Lord Archibald, died young. The screen at St Alban's Cathedral, restored by Hems Works Hems was commissioned to produce work for many churches and several cathedrals throughout England, and in America and Australia. His work won medals at the Centennial International Exhibition in Philadelphia (1876), was exhibited at the Paris Exposition Universelle (1878) and also won prizes at exhibitions in Chicago (1893) and Antwerp (1894). Examples in Devon of notable work from Hems's workshop are the rood screen restorations in the churches at Littleham, Staverton and Kenn; the fittings at Winkleigh and Revelstoke; and the alabaster reredoses at Swimbridge and St Paul, Honiton. In Bristol, he completed the statues for the replacement of the Bristol High Cross in 1889. Probably his most notable work was the restoration of the large medieval screen at St Alban's Cathedral, Hertfordshire, which was dedicated on 1 November 1899, and the construction of a similar screen in Christ Church Cathedral in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. Apart from his work as a sculptor, Hems was keen on travel and was a prolific writer, claiming \\"to have written more signed articles upon architecture, travel and other subjects than any other man\\". He was also a benefactor of the poor—amongst other charitable work, for many years he held Christmas lunches in his workshop for the elderly poor people of Exeter, inviting as many each year as his age. He helped found the Exeter Dental Hospital; supported the Devon and Exeter Hospital; was a pioneer of the Hospital Saturday Movement (a national weekly collection scheme in aid of local hospitals); and supported the Rifle Volunteer force. In addition he was churchwarden at St Sidwell's church and was a city councillor for a period. Personality Hems was a hard worker – a report of 1879 said that \\"he is 'always at it' from six in the morning until nine at night, and often much later\\", and he expected the same level of commitment from his workforce, apparently resorting to violence against them if they would not comply. In October 1878 he was charged £1 plus costs for fighting with one of his employees, and the following year a court was told that he had said that he would \\"break [William Mears] in as he had several of his other apprentices\\". He was also a flamboyant extrovert and a great self-promoter, making the most of any marketing opportunities that came his way. He had at least two well-publicised disputes with the Tax Commissioners. In September 1888 an auction of his goods on account of unpaid tax took place at his workshop in which one of the lots was a life-sized statue of St Matthew the Taxgatherer. (Subscription required for online access) After he again refused to pay the assessed amount of tax in 1907, another auction of his goods was arranged. It took place on 29 April that year, (Subscription required for online access) and he prepared the auction catalogue himself. The sale items included the crowbar that had been used by the bailiffs to gain entry to his workshop, a set of old stocks (\\"offering accommodation for three malefactors\\"), three \\"second-hand tombstones (slightly damaged) ... suitable for the graves of Income Tax Commissioners or other Revenue Officials\\", and his bulldog named Bob. According to his 1917 obituary, a sculpture of the Twelve Apostles was also included, and the event was widely reported at the time, with Hems making much of the way that he had made the Twelve Apostles pay his income tax. (Reproducing Hems's obituary published in The Devon Year Book, 1917.) Bronze of King William III, at Clifton Street Orange Hall, Belfast by Harry Hems Hems was also a prolific contributor to newspapers, and journals such as Notes and Queries, and he retained cuttings of everything published that referred to him, in a series of at least 15 volumes of 400 pages each. Legacy Apart from the large quantity of sculpture produced by his company, some of which is detailed above and which also includes the large bronze statue of William III on Clifton Street Orange Hall in Belfast, unveiled in 1889; and a memorial to R. D. Blackmore in Exeter Cathedral, Hems has left two notable legacies: a collection of medieval woodcarving, and his workshop. During his working life Hems salvaged many pieces of medieval woodcarving, mainly from churches in South West England, and he displayed them in rows around his workshop as inspiration for his craftsmen. After his death, Exeter's Royal Albert Memorial Museum purchased nearly 500 of these carvings. The collection includes many roof bosses, bench ends etc., a number of misericords,In 1969 there were said to be nine misericords in the collection, eight of which were believed to have come from Cadbury, Devon. The ninth was of unknown origin. See: and a green man sculpture, and is described on the museum's website as one of the most important collections of medieval woodwork in a British museum. After Hems's death, his business was carried on by two of his four sons, Wilfred (d. 1941) and Harry T. (d. 1952). For some years the company continued to flourish: it built many war memorials after the First World War, and in 1921 it was commissioned by the Canadian Government to create a speaker's chair for the House of Commons chamber in Ottawa, and a duplicate for the Australian Government in 1926. When Wilfred and Harry T. retired in 1938, the workshop building was sold and Hems's personal effects were auctioned. The building was bought and used until the 1970s by a boot, shoe and leather merchants; then a wine merchant; and following refurbishment it is now known as \\"The Harry Hems Centre\\", housing a restaurant, conference facility and other businesses. It still displays Hems's \\"luckie horseshoe\\" above the main entrance. See also *John Angel (sculptor) who may have apprenticed with him.

Pakistan's Sindh province abounds in fairy-tales and folktales that form its folklore. Some of these folktales(قصا) are particularly important for the development of higher literature in Sindhi, since they were to form the core of mystical tales of Sindh immortalized by Shah Abdul latif Bhittai, and are generally known as Heroines of Shah (شاه جون سورميون). Many of these folktales, especially those that deal with love stories, are well known in Sindh. Among them, the story of Sassui Punhun is probably the most famous. In it, a beautiful Indus girl named Sassui, brought up by a washerman's family in Bhambore, attracts many lovers. Finally, the prince of Kecch falls in love with her. His family is dismayed and eventually make the couple drunk and carry the lover away. Sassui finds herself alone in the morning She follows the traces of a Baloch caravan until she perishes in the desert. There is also the tragic story of Sohni who, married to a man she dislikes. She swims every night across the Indus to visit her beloved Mehar who tends the cattle on an island Eventually her sister-in-law discovers the secret and substitutes a pot of unbaked clay for a pot she used to carry as a kind of life vest, and Sohni drowns. Strange is the story of Lilan Chanesar. The heroine, a lady well versed in magic charms, barters the right of sleeping one night with her husband to her unknown rival for a diamond necklace. When her husband divorces her, she realizes she has frivolously given away all her happiness. After long trials, the couple meet again and die together. The story of Nuri tells of historical event during the Samma period, when the young Jam Tamachi fell in love with a fishermaid, Nuri, who, by virtue of humility and softness, became his favourite queen. The story of Umar Marui is also famous. Umar, the ruler of Amarkot, captures young Marui. She pines and long home, never listening to the blandishment of the ruler, but remaining faithful to her family, the poor herdsmen of Malir Tharparkar. Eventually, Umar sees no way but to send her home. All these stories and many more have been enriched in the course of time and provide imagery for Sindhi literature, especially for the Sufis, who spiritualised the tales. Stories of Dodo Chanesar and Moriro are full of sentiment of valour. Similarly, Sorath Rai Diyach emphasizes the prowess and generosity of King Diyaach, who severed his head and gave it in alms to a bard, Bijal. Recently,These folktales have been compiled into seven volumes titled Loke Kahaniyun under Sindhi Adabi Board's Folklore and Literature project. These seven volumes incorporate different varieties of folktales,legends and other stories. More than 300 folk-tales have been brought to light through this series of volumes, which includes both classical and popular tales.

Introduced in 1870, it last circulated between 1992 and de facto 1996, when it was the lowest-denomination coin in the country. It was considered as circulating coin for accounting reasons and was still minted in proof sets until the 2005 denomination of the currency. In addition to Romania, the coin was minted in Belgium, Austria, France and Hungary. History Principality of Romania Although the first Romanian coins were minted in the United Kingdom in 1867, a one leu coin was not introduced until 1870. The first one leu coin was 83.5% silver and 16.5% copper, with a diameter of 23mm and mass of 5g. The obverse bore the portrait of Carol I of Romania facing left with the inscription CAROL I DOMNUL ROMANIEI (Carol I Prince of the Romanians). The reverse, similar to other Romanian coins of the time, featured the denomination and year of minting within a wreath of laurel and oak. Below the wreath, where the British mintmarks had been on previous coins, was the initial 'C', for C.J. Cândescu, the director of the Bucharest mint. There were also coins bearing the 'B' mintmark of the mint itself. Production of the one leu coin began on 24 February 1870 and throughout the year a total of 400,000 were minted, some in coin orientation and some in medallic orientation.http://romaniancoins.org/1leu1870.html A second one leu coin was introduced in 1873, retaining the composition and dimensions of the 1870 issue. On the obverse, the portrait was replaced with the full coat of arms of the Principality of Romania with the year below. The name of the engraver, STERN, and the mintmark of Saint Michael of Brussels were either side of the date. On the reverse, the wreath was shortened to include the name of the country at the top of the coin. There were coins struck in 1873 where the 'L' in 'LEU' was broken. The coin was minted in Brussels, Belgium, in 1873, 1874 and 1876 with the following mintages:http://romaniancoins.org/1leu1873.html *1873: 4,443,393 *1874: 4,511,607 *1876: 225,000 In 1881 a new coin was minted with the same dimensions and composition. On the obverse, the portrait of Carol I returned with the same inscription as in 1870, and with the engraver's name KULLRICH beneath. The full coat of arms moved to the reverse, with the country name on top and the denomination split either side. The year of minting was placed beneath the coat of arms, with the 'V' mintmark for Vienna, Austria on the left and the wheat ear for the Bucharest mint in Romania on the right. There was a total mintage of 1.8 million coins, with some bearing a 'B' mintmark for Bucharest in place of the 'V'.http://romaniancoins.org/1leu1881.html Kingdom of Romania Both sides of an 1885 one leu coin bearing the portrait of King Carol I of Romania on the obverse In 1884, due to the creation of the Kingdom of Romania in 1881, the script around Carol I read CAROL I REGE AL ROMANIEI (Carol I King of Romania). The name of the country was removed from the top of the reverse, and all coins bore the 'B' mintmark of Bucharest. The specifications remained the same.

After Freyse graduated from the Central High School of Detroit, he began as an editorial cartoonist for the Detroit Journal. As a staff artist for the Detroit Times, he did theatrical caricature. His commercial artwork included billboards, theatre advertising and cartoons for Ford Motors. In 1939, he took over Gene Ahern's Our Boarding House from Bela Zaboly and continued to draw it until his death in 1969. Over a 20-year period, Our Boarding House was written by William M. Braucher (1896–1958).Meet the Sports Writers, baseball-fever.com; accessed January 20, 2015. Others who worked on the strip included Jim Branagan and Tom McCormick. The Sunday color strip ended on March 29, 1981; the weekday panel continued until December 22, 1984.Profile, Lambiek.net; accessed January 20, 2015. Freyse and his wife, Evelyn S. Freyse (1908–2003), had two children, a son, Steve, and a daughter, actress Lynn. The family moved to Cleveland, Ohio, and later to Tucson, Arizona, due to Evelyn Freyse's health needs. In Tucson, Bill Freyse became a Blue Ribbon flower grower.National Cartoonists Society, Reuben.org; accessed January 20, 2018. Freyse occasionally drew elephants into his cartoons, and his hobby was collecting elephants, as noted by Ken Hall in his column, \\"The Celebrity Collector\\": :Borden's father, the noted cartoonist Bill Freyse, was himself a lover of elephants and drew them for his (and Lynn's) amusement when she was a child. Freyse drew the daily and Sunday panels for Our Boarding House with Major Hoople from the 1930s through the 1960s. The strips were syndicated to hundreds of newspapers nationwide. He also created the cartoon version of The Lone Ranger and co-created The Green Hornet. Artistry was his life's work, but elephants intrigued him. \\"My father instilled in me a great sense of wonder and respect for the elephant\\", Lynn said. \\"Elephants are great, majestic creatures, very gentle by nature, and it's true they never do forget!\\" The first pieces in her collection were left to her by her father, including a bronze elephant, about eight inches tall, and a pair of bronze elephants sitting back to back, their legs in the air. Archives The Bill Freyse Cartoons collection at the Syracuse University Library has 491 original daily cartoons and 90 original Sunday cartoons from a two-year period of Our Boarding House (1966–67).
