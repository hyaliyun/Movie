It is located at Semarak Street (formerly Henry Gurney Street), Kuala Lumpur. It is the place where the police is trained under the government. Learning in Pulapol encompasses training aspect, from academic or practical. Pulapol has seven branches: Pulapol Jalan Semarak, Kuala Lumpur, Pulapol Bukit Sentosa, Rawang, Pulapol Air Hitam, Negeri Sembilan, Pulapol Segamat, Johor, Pulapol Langkawi, Kedah, Pulapol Dungun, Terengganu, Pulapol Kota Kinabalu, Sabah and Pulapol Kuching, Sarawak. The police trainees will be guaranteed to have a job and will be trained for six or nine months there. History On 20 November 1904, the first Police Training Centre was formed by Captain Graham, the Malay States Guides container officer. It was located at Bluff Road which was later renamed as Bukit Aman Street. It is now the location of Bukit Aman's Police Headquarters which used VB to be called Malay States Guides Command Headquarters of Kuala Lumpur. The area consists of 249.5 acres or 41.6 hectare. In 1905, the centre admitted its first intake with 207 Malay and 219 Indian recruits. In 1920, a new Police Training Centre was proposed when the old facility was unable to accommodate the increasing intake of the police trainees. The effort to build the new centre was postponed because of the economic depression until it was reviewed five years later. An area near the Gurney Road was chosen and throughout the 1930s, constructions for the academy was done. In October 1940, the Police Training Centre in Bluff Road transferred to the new Police Training Centre at Gurney Road (currently Jalan Semarak), Kuala Lumpur. Recruits of Royal Malaysian Police with senior police officers in a shooting course, armed with HK MP5 at Pulapol Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. In 1941, the training programme was halted because of the invasion by the Japanese Imperial Army. Most of the police officers from the centre were called to serve against the military attack and at the beginning of the occupation until eight police officers were left. Once Malaya had fallen under the Japanese occupation, the Police Training Centre was turned into the Japanese's Military Police Headquarters. In August 1945, British army retook the training centre and later it was reconstructed as the largest training centre for the police force. During 1945 and 1946, Mr. J.D. Fairhead acted as the Police Training Centre Commander after Japanese rule. From then to 1957, the training centre was commanded by the British military personnel. In 1957, Malaya achieved her independence from the Britain and the training centre was then given to Sir Merican Bin Sutan as its first Malay Commandant from 25 November 1957 to 24 November 1959. From 1940 to 2007, the training centre was led by at least 40 Commandants in its lifetime. By 1977, this institution was now familiarly known as Pulapol (Police Training Centre) and trained at least 2,200 recruits per session. In Jun 2018, Commandant, SAC Shamsudin Bin Mat has made a compulsory move for the Senior Police Officers whom are serving in Pulapol to pursue their education in Master in Business Administration. Upon motivation and encouragement by the Commandant, SAC Shamsudin Bin Mat, 30 senior police officers are pursuing their MBA. On the 16 th January 2019, during a Ponggal celebration in Pulapol, SAC Shamsudin Bin Mat told Makkal Osai reporter Gopi, that a small Hindu temple located at Police Training Centre (Pulapol) will be rebuilt. The temple had been there for a long time and numerous efforts to upgrade and expand the temple had not been successful. However Inspector General of Police, Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun had given instructions to expand the temple. The Training Centre currently has a mosque, a Sikh temple a Buddhist Shrine along with the Hindu temple. First female commandant On 16 January 2014, SAC Nahariah Hussein, 57, a D1 assistant principal director (Administration) of Bukit Aman CID, was appointed as the 42nd commandant of Pulapol when she took over from SAC Zulkifli Mohamad bringing her as a first female commandant since it was established in 1904.

It is associated with the kings of France, whose coronation was held in the nearby cathedral of Notre-Dame de Reims and the following coronation banquet in the palace itself. History A large Gallo- Roman villa still occupied the site of the palace in the 6th and 7th centuries, and later became a Carolingian palace. The first documented use of the name dates to 1131, and derives from the plan of the building, which resembles the letter Œ§ (tau, in the Greek alphabet). Most of the early building has disappeared: the oldest part remaining is the chapel, from 1207. The building was largely rebuilt in Gothic style between 1498 and 1509, and modified to its present Baroque appearance between 1671 and 1710 by Jules Hardouin-Mansart and Robert de Cotte. It was damaged by a fire on 19 September 1914, and not repaired until after the Second World War. The Palace was the residence of the kings of France before their coronation in Notre-Dame de Reims. The king was dressed for the coronation at the palace before proceeding to the cathedral; afterwards, a banquet was held at the palace. The first recorded coronation banquet was held at the palace in 990, and the most recent in 1825. The palace has housed the Mus√©e de l'≈íuvre since 1972, displaying statuary and tapestries from the cathedral, together with the remains of the cathedral treasury and other objects associated with the coronation of the French kings. The Palace of Tau, together with the Cathedral of Notre-Dame and the former Abbey of Saint-Remi, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991. It attracts around 100,000 visitors each year.

It is a dull brown above, with grey underparts, and has a yellowish, downward-curving bill. No one knows what it sounds like and it is not known whether it is nocturnal or crepuscular. It most likely was driven to extinction from predation by feral cats, dogs, and pigs. Status Drawing from 1873 This cryptic rail is only known from seventeen specimens taken between 1860 and 1890 on New Caledonia. This bird is supposed to live in evergreen forests and seems to have moved higher up on the island to escape introduced predators. Its diet consists of invertebrates, including earthworms. Though the bird has not been confirmed since 1890, unconfirmed reports from the 1960s and 1984 say that some still live in the higher montane forests. A survey in 1998 produced no firm evidence from hunters or fieldwork. However, many still believe it persists in small numbers. This bird was host to a species of parasite, the phtilopterid louse Rallicola piageti. This is not believed to have occurred on any other bird species . Hence, R. piageti may be coextinct today (May 1990). The binomial commemorates the French ornithologist Frederic de Lafresnaye.

Life and career Arnold was born in Willesden, London. He began his football career as an apprentice at Crewe Alexandra, turning professional in January 1969 and making his league debut the same season. His talent was soon spotted by bigger teams and in September 1970, after only 15 league appearances, he became a forerunner to the many players to leave Crewe for the top flight when he joined Liverpool for a fee of ¬£12,000. He failed to establish himself at Anfield, making only two league appearances. His only start was in the penultimate league match of the season, away to Manchester City, when Bill Shankly made ten changes to protect his first-choice players before the Fairs Cup semi-final against Leeds United just two days later, incurring a heavy fine from the Football League. In January 1972 he was sent on loan to Southport, scoring 3 times in 16 league appearances, and in September of the following season he was loaned to Torquay United, making his debut in the goalless draw away to Bury on 2 September. He played twice more for the Gulls, scoring in his final appearance, a 2‚Äì1 defeat away to league newcomers Hereford United on 30 September. In June 1973, he left Anfield, moving to Rochdale where he was to end his league career after only one season of regular first-team football, making 40 league appearances and scoring once. He went on to play non-league football for Weymouth, scoring 14 goals from 57 appearances, and on loan to Dorchester Town (13 appearances), before injury forced his retirement.

The depiction of a 'curved mountain' at the top of this painting is meant as a referent to Culhuacan. Chicomoztoc () is the name for the mythical origin place of the Aztec Mexicas, Tepanecs, Acolhuas, and other Nahuatl-speaking peoples (or Nahuas) of the central Mexico region of Mesoamerica, in the Postclassic period. The term Chicomoztoc derives from Nahuatl chicome (‚Äúseven‚Äù), oztotl (‚Äúcave‚Äù), and -c (‚Äúplace‚Äù). In symbolic terms these caves within a hill have been compared to the wombs from which the various peoples were born; another possible association is with the seven orifices of the human body. In either case, this term is associated with the origin, birth, or beginning of a group of people, both mythic and historical.Huerta, Blas Roman Castellon. \\"Chicom√≥ztoc.\\" In Dav√≠d Carrasco (ed). The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures. : Oxford University Press, 2001. There is an association of Chicomoztoc with certain legendary traditions concerning Culhuacan (Colhuacan), an actual pre-Columbian settlement in the Valley of Mexico which was considered to have been one of the earliest and most pre- eminent settlements in the valley. Culhuacan (\\"place of those with ancestors\\" is its literal meaning in Classical Nahuatl) was viewed as a prestigious and revered place by the Aztec/Mexica (who also styled themselves 'Culhua- Mexica'). In Aztec codical writing, the symbol or glyph representing the toponym of Culhuacan took the form of a 'bent' or 'curved' hill (a play on the homonym col- in Nahuatl, meaning \\"bent, twisted\\", e.g. as if by old age). Some researchers have attempted to identify Chicomoztoc with a specific geographic location, likely between 60 and 180 miles northeast of the Valley of Mexico including perhaps a height near the present-day town of San Isidro Culhuacan. The purported existence of actual caves plays a role in New Age Mayanism.  Cerro Culiac√°n  In the State of Guanajuato the highest mountain is \\"El Cerro de Culiac√°n\\" and is surrounded by all the signs that correspond to the measure and chronicles of the legendary Chicomoztoc.

The following Corps were raised prior to 1880:Litchfield & Westlake, p. 183Beckett, Appendix VIII. *1st Yorkshire (West Riding) Artillery Volunteer Corps raised at Leeds on 2 August 1860 *2nd Yorkshire (West Riding) Artillery Volunteer Corps formed at Bradford on 10 October 1860 *3rd Yorkshire (West Riding) Artillery Volunteer Corps formed at York on 9 February 1861 (joined the 1st Administrative Brigade of Yorkshire (East Riding) Artillery Volunteers based at Scarborough, North Yorkshire)Litchfield & Westlake, p. 176.1st East Riding Artillery Volunteers at Regiments.org *4th Corps formed at Sheffield on 6 February 1861 *5th Corps formed by 1864, but disappeared from the Army List in November 1874 *6th Corps formed at Heckmondwike by June 1867 (from members of the 2nd Corps) *7th Corps formed at Batley on 2 October 1866 (disbanded in August 1877) *8th Corps formed at Halifax on 19 May 1871 They began as Coastal Artillery with 32 pounder guns. In 1868 the 5th Corps won the Queen's Prize at the annual National Artillery Association competition held at Shoeburyness. The following year the 7th Corps won the competition, with the 4th Corps winning it in 1872.Litchfield & Westlake, p. 189 By 1871, the 1st had grown to eight batteries and the 2nd had become the 1st Admin Brigade, Yorkshire (West Riding) Artillery Volunteers, containing five Yorkshire (West Riding) Artillery Volunteer Corps, numbered the 2nd, 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th. By 1880, a number of these Corps had been disbanded or absorbed and the batteries were distributed as follows: * Numbers 1 to 4 at Bradford * Numbers 5 and 6 at Heckmondwike * Numbers 7 and 8 at Halifax 1st West Yorkshire Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers) with newly issued 4.7-inch guns, 1902 Various reforms from 1889 resulted all the corps being classed as 'Position Artillery' and armed with 40 pounder RBL guns. In 1892, the Corps were organised as part of the Western Division Royal Artillery and were titled 1st, 2nd and 4th West Riding of Yorkshire Volunteer Artillery, with headquarters at Leeds, Bradford and Sheffield respectively.Army List, HMSO, 1892 After 1902, they became the 1st, 2nd and 4th West Riding of Yorkshire Royal Garrison Artillery (Volunteers) and were re-equipped with 4.7-inch QF Guns drawn by steam tractors. =Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907= After the end of the Boer War in 1902, a review of the Army took place and a Royal Commission reported on the Militia and Volunteers. The War Office was concerned over the different standards of efficiency, but had to concede that this was in the hands of individual commanding officers. Secretary for War, Haldane, in the Liberal Government of 1905, was given the task of preparing legislation for reform. His Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 brought together volunteer units to form the Territorial Force (to become the Territorial Army in 1921) giving them the same role as before, but, in addition, giving them the capability of acting as backup to the Regular Army if the need arose. In addition, the Act set up County Associations to help co-ordinate the work of the War Office and the new Territorial Force, and to recruit, house and administer the units. As a result, units were configured as follows: *1st West Riding Brigade Royal Field Artillery (TF) - (HQ at Fenton Street, Leeds) *2nd West Riding Brigade Royal Field Artillery (TF) - (HQ at Valley Parade in Bradford) *3rd West Riding Brigade Royal Field Artillery (TF) - (HQ in Sheffield) Each brigade had three batteries and an ammunition column; they were equipped with 15 pounder guns. With the change to the smaller guns, steam tractors were no longer required and the barracks had to be adapted to accommodate horses. =First World War= In the Great War (1914‚Äì18) the three West Riding brigades were part of the 49th (West Riding) Division, going to France in 1915. Each formed a second line brigade in 1915 (2/1st and 2/2nd West Riding Brigade RFA (TF) respectively), which then supported 62nd Division. In May 1916, the Brigades were renumbered 245th, 246th and 247th Brigades Royal Field Artillery (TF). =Inter-war period= Following the War, the names of the Brigades reverted to their pre-war designations - 1st, 2nd and 3rd West Riding Brigade RFA when they were reconstituted into the Territorial Army in 1920. This was short-lived, however, as in 1921 they were again renamed, this time as the 69th and 70th (West Riding) Brigades Royal Field Artillery (Territorial Army). In 1924, the Royal Horse, Royal Field Artillery and the Royal Garrison Artillery were reunited under one name and the brigades became the 69th and 70th (West Riding) Field Brigades Royal Artillery (Territorial Army). Similarly, when artillery brigades were rebranded as regiments in 1938, the West Riding brigades became the 69th and 70th (West Riding) Field Regiment RA(TA). In 1939, the 69th formed a Second Line regiment at Bramley, Leeds, 121 Field Regiment RA(TA); the 70th similarly gave rise to 122 Field Regiment RA (TA) in Bradford. =Second World War= The 69th Field Regiment, as part of the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, served in Iceland for two years and later, after their return to the United Kingdom, took part in the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, shortly after the D-Day landings of 6 June. The regiment served with the 49th Division in the Normandy Campaign during the Battle for Caen, Operation Astonia, garrisoning The Island in the aftermath of the failure of Operation Market Garden, and the Liberation of Arnhem in 1945.Corry, p. 28 Originally with the 69th Field Regiment in the 49th (West Riding) Division, the 70th Field Regiment was sent to France in 1940 as part of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division. When the British Expeditionary Force had to withdraw, the 70th returned to the United Kingdom via Cherbourg with all their guns, vehicles and equipment intact. They were later transferred to 46th (West Riding) Infantry Division and fought with them in the Tunisia Campaign and later in Italy and the Greek Civil War. 5.5-inch gun and AEC Matador artillery tractor of 121st Medium Regiment during operations to cross the River Seine at Vernon, 25 August 1944 (IWM BU55) The 121st Field Regiment was sent to Iraq in 1941, fought with the British Eighth Army in the North African Campaign and the American Fifth Army in the Italian Campaign before returning to the United Kingdom to take part in the Normandy invasion as a Medium Regiment with 5.5-inch Gun-Howitzers. The 122nd Field Regiment, after training in the United Kingdom, was sent out to the Far East in late 1941. The 122nd suffered 13 war casualties during the Malayan Campaign up until the naval base at Singapore surrendered in February 1942 after the Battle of Singapore. Thereafter, more than 200 died, mainly as a result of their treatment as prisoners of the Imperial Japanese Army. =Post-war= An honour, unique at the time for a TA unit, was conferred upon the 70th on 5 September 1945. They were granted the Freedom of the City of Bradford.Freedoms. This freedom was transferred to 269 (WR) OP Bty R(V) on 31 March 1983 269th and 270th (West Riding) Field Regiment RA(TA) reconstituted in the TA in Leeds and Bradford respectively on New Year's Day 1947. Both units were equipped with the 25 pounder self propelled gun (the Sexton), and both became part of 49th (West Riding) Armoured Division. In 1956, they were re-equipped with 25 pounder (towed), familiar to so many. When Anti-Aircraft Command was abolished in the mid-fifties, 269th absorbed 321 (West Riding) HAA Regiment and the 270th absorbed 584 LAA Regiment RA (6th West Yorkshire) without changing their titles (although the 270th did move their HQ from Valley Parade to 584's barracks at Belle Vue, Bradford). To mark the centenary of the formation of the 1st Yorkshire (West Riding) Artillery Volunteer Corps, the Freedom of the City of Leeds was granted to the 269th on 3 February 1960.Welcome to the new British Army Website - British Army Website Shortly afterwards, the 269th and 270th amalgamated with each other to form the 249th (The West Riding Artillery) Field Regiment RA(TA), with headquarters at Carlton Barracks in Leeds and batteries at Leeds, Bramley and Bradford. =TAVR III= This reform saw the Regiment reorganised as The West Riding Regiment RA (Territorials) on 1 April 1967: but, by 1969, the Regiment was reduced to a cadre at Bradford (some of Q Battery was absorbed into E Company, The Yorkshire Volunteers; 272 (West Riding Artillery) Field Support Squadron, 73 Engineer Regiment RE(V) also formed at Bradford). In 1971, this cadre was expanded to become \\"A\\" (West Riding Artillery) Battery, 3rd Battalion Yorkshire Volunteers. On 1 April 1975, an independent observation post battery, 269 (West Riding) OP Battery RA (Volunteers), was formed at Leeds from the cadre (and the cadre disbanded), reviving the West Riding Artillery lineage in the Royal Artillery.

Architect Jos√© Porto of the Gabinete de Urbaniza√ß√£o Colonial produced the original concept design for the hotel; and in 1953, the Companhia de Mo√ßambique commissioned architect Francisco de Castro to develop the original design and the final detailing. At the time, the Companhia de Mo√ßambique had the concession to exploit the area now known as the provinces of Manica and Sofala. When the concession ended in 1942, the Companhia still owned local businesses and continued to dominate the local economy.

Arthur Brand√£o was the chief officer of the Companhia and also held a prominent position within the Salazar regime. Although Beira was a Portuguese colony, it had been influenced culturally by Britain due to the neighbouring British colony of Rhodesia's use of its sea harbour. The Portuguese Estado Novo and the ending of the Companhia concession gave rise to increased Portuguese influence throughout the city: the Portuguese Escudo became the only official currency, the government became dominated by the fascist Salazar regime, and the streetscape changed with the new Art Deco and Modern Movement architecture. The Grande Hotel became a symbol of the success of the Estado Novo in Beira, as it was intended to provide luxury accommodation for VIPS, business travelers, and wealthy tourists from Rhodesia, South Africa, and from Portugal or its colonies. Architecture The exterior of the Grande Hotel was done in the Art Deco style that was popular in Portugal during the Estado Novo era of the 30s and 40s. Art Deco's geometrical shapes and repetition represented modernity and a rejection of the neobaroque style of the previous era. As such, the exterior of the Grande Hotel had no ornamentation or intricate patterns. The interior, however, was done in an eclectic style and with the use of modern materials in a manner unusual in Beira at that time and even seldom used in other works of the architect, Francisco de Castro. De Castro also designed the famous CFM train station in Beira. Opening and operation as a hotel In 1955, the Grande Hotel opened in an event officiated by the Roman Catholic bishop of Beira, Sebasti√£o Soares de Resende. White residents of Beira could use the swimming pool, and they recalled the Grande Hotel as a palace of unlimited luxury where one could eat the finest chocolate. Hollywood star Kim Novak stayed there when she came to hunt in the nearby Gorongosa National Park. Still, the expected clientele‚Äîwealthy tourists and business travelers‚Äînever materialized. Although Beira was a popular holiday destination, its tourists were primarily white middle-income families from Salisbury (now called Harare), the capital of Rhodesia (now called Zimbabwe), which was 550 km or 9 hours away by car. They could not afford the luxuries of the Grande Hotel, instead preferring beach holidays in the tourist district of Macuti, 8 km from the city centre. Although the Grande Hotel was only a 2 km walk from the city centre, swimming at the beach was forbidden. =Casino myth= Several sources refer to proposals for the Grande Hotel to host a casino.Rolletta, P.

[online] available at: http://www.buala.org/en/city/we-the-ones- from-the-grande-hotel-da-beira [accessed 8 February 2012]Anonymous (2011) A Beira e o Grande Hotel da Beira. The Delagoa Bay Blog [online] available at: http://delagoabayword.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/a-beira-e-o-grande-hotel-da- beira/ [accessed 8 February 2012] However, the building plans do not show any facilities that would suggest a casino. Francisco Ivo, an architect and former student of Francisco de Castro, claimed that De Castro told him that there was no intention to create a casino. The clients of the Grande Hotel had close associations with the Portuguese dictator Salazar, and Salazar thought it was morally inappropriate to have gambling in the African colonies. Indeed, casinos in Louren√ßo Marques and Costa Bello were forced to close in the early 1930s. Closing After twenty years, the Grande Hotel Beira was closed, deemed by the company to be unprofitable and too costly to keep open. The hotel had never made a profit in any year of its operation. The construction costs had come to three times the original budget. Anticipated wealthy guests never came, and the staff necessary to maintain and operate a luxury hotel was too large for the number of guests actually served. Every elevator, for example, had a personal operator. In several documents it was claimed that the reason for closure was the refusal of the regime to grant the hotel a casino permit. However, the white residents of Southern Africa could not afford this level of luxury, and Beira was not known as a holiday destination for wealthy people, who already preferred the Bazaruto Archipelago at Vilanculos, the Mediterranean city life style of the Mozambican capital Louren√ßo Marques, the South African Kr√ºger national park and the Victoria Falls in Rhodesia. Business travelers stayed at the Ambassador Hotel, a less expensive alternative situated in the Baixa (downtown) area, where most of the business offices were located. Arthur Brand√£o, the chief officer of the Companhia, also owned the Ambassador. Aftermath Grand Hotel Beira in its heyday The Grande Hotel closed for business in 1963; it remained available for large events and conferences, although it was used only twice. The first time was to accommodate United States congress members who were on a cruise along the East-African coast. The second time was in 1971, for the wedding of Petusha Jardim, daughter of Jorge Jardim, then Minister of State of Mozambique and the so-called governor-general of Mozambique who had achieved a high position within the Estado Novo. Traditionally, Portuguese weddings involved a large number of guests, and this wedding was attended by VIPs from all over the Estado Novo and the neighbouring 'White Laager' countries. The Grande Hotel was the only place large enough to accommodate the event. The swimming pool remained open to the public and, as it was the only Olympic-size swimming pool in the colony at that time, it became the main training facility for the Mozambican Olympic swimming team. =Mozambique independence= On 25 June 1975, Mozambique gained independence as a result of Portugal's nonviolent Carnation Revolution the previous year; the Mozambique Liberation Front, later known as Frelimo, assumed power. On the first day of independence, the Grande Hotel hosted the first wedding in Beira under the new regime. Later, the bar at the swimming pool became the office of Frelimo's Revolutionary Committee, which was responsible for establishing socialism in Beira and the province of Sofala. While the main hall of the Grande Hotel was used for party meetings and events, the basement became a prison for opponents of the new government. In 1978, the communist Frelimo government assumed ownership of private land, a move that resulted in the exodus of the remaining Mozambican-Portuguese community that had dominated the local economy. However, the Grande Hotel was one of the exceptions, and its land and the building remain the property of the Portuguese Grupo Entreposto SA, the continuation of the Companhia de Mo√ßambique. In 1977, the Mozambican Civil War broke out in the province of Sofala: Renamo vs Frelimo. The civil war was in part the extension of the global Cold War; capitalism vs communism. Renamo was established by the Rhodesian secret service and the South African Defence Force with the aim of destroying the communist Frelimo regime. Renamo launched guerrilla attacks at social and economic targets. The Grande Hotel, as the Frelimo political base in this area, became a Frelimo military base as well. With the fall of Ian Smith's government in Rhodesia, the ZANU party came into power. They renamed the country Zimbabwe, and Robert Mugabe became the president. With this change, Zimbabwe needed to use the Beira corridor as its import/export route, since the alternate routes ran through South Africa, which Zimbabwe now boycotted. In 1981, the Zimbabwe Defence Force established a neutral zone in Beira and its import/export corridor. As a result, the city became a haven for refugees seeking safety and access to international aid entering through the sea harbour and airport. The Grande Hotel became a refugee camp with most of the refugees coming from rural areas. It is said that some refugees who arrived during the night were overwhelmed in the morning by the view of the ocean, which they had never seen. They tried to walk towards the sea but, never having experienced a multistory building and not comprehending the height differences, they fell to their deaths from the roof terrace. The hotel survived Cyclone Idai in March 2019. http://www.rfi.fr/afrique/20190329-mozambique-reportage-beira-restait-grande- hotel-survecu-cyclone-idai Current status Since 1992, Mozambique has enjoyed peace and stability. The seaport of Beira is redeveloped and booming due to the transit of minerals to Asia. Current situation of the Grande Hotel, street vendors on the third floor Current situation of the Grande Hotel, polluted swimming pool The Grande Hotel has deteriorated, however. With only 116 hotel rooms, it now provides shelter for a fluctuating population of around 1,077 inhabitants (Ivo 2008), with large families inhabiting a single room. They do not pay any rent and cannot claim a right of ownership. There is little formal maintenance of the collective space, resulting in accumulating garbage, leaking rain water, open elevator shafts and inaccessible stairs. The Olympic swimming pool, now polluted, is used for bathing by inhabitants who cannot afford to buy water at the privately owned water pump opposite the Grande Hotel. According to the local Red Cross, there is a high risk of cholera, diarrhoea, HIV/AIDS, malaria and scabies in the Grande Hotel. The water, sewer and electricity infrastructures have been removed and sold in order to obtain money for food and water. The parquet floor is used as fuel for cooking. Most inhabitants find work only in the informal economic sector; they are, as implied by their nickname of 'whato muno' (not from here), excluded from the formal socio-economic life of Beira. As the city's formal economy grows, this puts pressure on the informal economy. It has become harder for Grande Hotel inhabitants to meet basic needs. The nickname 'whato muno' is used in Beira as a derogatory term for the inhabitants of the Grande Hotel. The hotel is considered to be a place where robbers live and where the police do not have any authority. There was at one time an advanced three- layered chief structure which kept order, but this no longer exists. The local municipal secretary of the neighbourhood (who also lives in the Grande Hotel) is now seen as the unofficial chief, but without the power that a chief would normally have in a Mozambique community. These days, there are only two common rules of the Grande Hotel: Respect one another. And, the Grande Hotel is open to anybody who wants shelter. The hotel and its squatters are the subject of the 2007 documentary film Night Lodgers. Future The local municipal authority would like to relocate the current inhabitants, providing housing in the slum of Chipangara, and then demolish the structure and develop the land for commercial uses. However, the municipal authority is not the legal owner; neither does it have the funds nor the investors currently willing to participate in this project. Meanwhile, new residents keep coming, and many people remain trapped in the Grande Hotel by poverty, some of them third generation inhabitants.

In the time of Jugendstil / Art Nouveau, the company created pieces based on the designs of well-known artists such as the jewellery designer Professor Georg Kleemann or Anton Krautheimer of the Munich Secession. In the art deco period and in the 1950s the manufacture focused mainly on fine gold and silver ware. From the 1970s onwards again more jewellery was manufactured. Until 1989 the company produced Faberg√© jewelry for Faberg√© & Cie in Paris with the label 'Faberg√© Paris'. From 1989 until 2009, the company continued to produce Faberg√© jewelry under license from Unilever New York until the brand license was sold. The manufacture Victor Mayer is well known for its high-end jewellery and the preservation of historical artisan techniques such as authentic fire enamel or guilloch√©. Life Designs of Art Nouveau jewellery and belt buckles, drawn about 1903 by Victor MayerVictor Mayer was born in 1857 into a family of thriving entrepreneurs. His father Eduard Mayer (1814‚Äì1881) owned a hostel \\"Zum Kreuz\\" in Pforzheim. His grandfather Balthasar Mayer (1779‚Äì1849) owned an apothecary in Haigerloch. Between 1872 and 1877, Victor Mayer served as an apprentice where he underwent the training to become a steel engraver. Then he became one of the first students at the Pforzheim Arts and Crafts School (Pforzheimer Kunstgewerbeschule) founded in 1877 by Grand Duke Friedrich I. After having completed his military service from 1879 until 1882, he could finally set off for a three-year stay in Vienna, which he had planned for a long time. There he gained valuable experience in enamelling and guilloch√©- engraving, sophisticated techniques which are still being used at the manufacture Victor Mayer today. After returning to Pforzheim, he continued his studies at the Grand Duke‚Äôs Art and Crafts School and received significant commendations in drawing, modelling and design. In 1890 he married Lina n√©e Niemand. In the same year he founded the jewellery company Vogel & Mayer in Pforzheim together with the merchant Herrmann Vogel. Herrmann Vogel left the company in 1895 after conflict arose between the partners, and Victor Mayer continued the business alone under his own name. In 1932 he withdrew from operative business and handed over his shares in equal parts to his son Oskar Mayer and his son in law Edmund Mohr. Victor Mayer died in Pforzheim on 13 October 1946. Creative Works Design of an Art D√©co powder compact, drawn in the nineteenthirties by Victor MayerVictor Mayer‚Äòs creative works embrace four periods. He began in 1885 in the style of historicism at the Arts and Crafts School in Pforzheim, progressing towards the Jugendstil / Art Nouveau in the early 1900s, moving on to Art Deco after the First World War. With his late avant-garde designs created after 1940, he pointed the way forward to the 1950s. Documents from the company‚Äôs archives show that Victor Mayer continued to make significant contributions to the manufacture‚Äôs creative designs until short before his death; in 1945 at the age of 88 he designed numerous pieces of jewellery which sold very well until in the 1960s. Company history Faberg√© Winter-Egg, designed and manufactured in 1997 by Victor Mayer GmbH & Co. KG, Pforzheim/GermanyThe manufacture Victor Mayer GmbH & Co. KG was founded in 1890 by Victor Mayer and Herrmann Vogel. After Herrmann Vogel had left the company in 1895, Victor Mayer continued the business alone under his name. His two oldest sons, Victor and Julius, died in World War I. They had been designated to take over the company management from the founder. Now two of the remaining children, Maria and Oskar Mayer, had to assume the commercial tasks in the company, while Victor Mayer was in charge of the technical management and design. Maria married Edmund Mohr, who became an individually liable partner and co-owner of the company in 1925. In 1932 Victor Mayer withdrew from operative business and handed over his shares in equal parts to his only remaining son Oskar Mayer and his son in law Edmund Mohr. Until 1965 Oskar Mayer and Edmund Mohr were equal partners and responsible co-owners of the company. In this year the two grandsons of Victor Mayer, Dr. Herbert Mohr- Mayer and his cousin Hubert Mayer, took over the management of the company. When Hubert Mayer died unexpectedly in 1989, Dr. Herbert Mohr-Mayer purchased the original shares held by his cousin to become sole proprietor of the manufacture. In 1989 the company obtained the licence to manufacture Faberg√© jewellery and objects of art and achieved great success with these pieces until 2009. In 2003 Dr. Herbert Mohr-Mayer left the company and his son Dr. Marcus Oliver Mohr became creative director and managing partner. The great- grandson of Victor Mayer is now leading the business in the fourth generation. Faberg√© exhibitions In 1996 Faberg√© jewellery by Victor Mayer was shown together with the works of Peter Carl Faberg√© at the Metropolitan Museum, New York . The collection of Faberg√© Eggs was the center piece of the Russian Pavilion at Expo 2000 in Hannover, Germany. \\"Faberge. A Return To Russia\\" was the name of an exhibition staged at the Moscow Krelmin's Armory in 2001. On display were some thirty pieces of jewelry created by Victor Mayer. The Faberg√© Amber Egg is the centerpiece of the Amber Museum in Gdansk, Poland. Ewa Rachon, the Director of Amberif, ordered the egg to be created for the city of Gdansk in 1996.

Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. She has honorary degrees from the University of South Carolina and Chestnut Hill College in Philadelphia. Career =Journalism= Matthews began working at ABC's Washington DC affiliate WJLA in 1976 as a production assistant. She worked her way up to producer and then she was a writer/reporter from 1982 to 1991. In 1991 she began anchoring. She was an anchor for 15 years through 2006 when she retired. She hosted and executive produced the nationally syndicated Working Woman television show from 2001 to 2006. She hosted political show Capital Sunday on Sundays. She was named a 2002 Washingtonian of the Year by Washingtonian magazine, and a \\"Woman Who Means Business\\" by the Washington Business Journal. She has also been awarded nine local Emmys and an Edward R.

She also co-chaired Marriott's Executive Green Council. In March 2015 she resigned from Marriott. =Public sector= Matthews served on the U.S. Travel and Tourism Advisory Board to the Secretary of Commerce, as well as the boards of the U.S. Travel Association, the International Tourism Partnership, and the Economic Club of Washington. She is active in the World Economic Forum Policy Councils. 2016 Democratic Congressional primary bid On June 3, 2015, Matthews officially announced that she was a Democratic Party candidate for Maryland's 8th congressional district, where incumbent Chris Van Hollen was relinquishing his House seat in order to run for the United States Senate. On March 16, 2016, the editorial board of The Washington Post endorsed Matthews, writing, \\"Our preference for Ms. Matthews boils down to our belief that in Congress, she would be more pragmatic and less doctrinaire than the left-leaning State Senator Jamie Raskin, whose passionate liberalism is unsurpassed in Annapolis. Both candidates supported gun control, clean energy, campaign finance reform and greater investment in education and health research. Ms. Matthews has greater potential, following the Van Hollen model, to move the ball forward in those areas.\\" In contrast, Raskin enjoyed the endorsement of the Progressive Action PAC, the political arm of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which grew from 72 members at the time of their December 2017 endorsement, to 92 members in early 2020. By April, 2016, the primary contest had drawn national attention as 2016's most expensive House race, dominated by Trone's deep pockets. Even without Trone's cash, the primary in Washington's prosperous Maryland suburbs became the nation's priciest, with total fundraising near the $20 million mark. Raskin and Matthews each collected about $2 million, not counting $500,000 in loans Matthews made to her campaign in March, 2016. On April 26, 2016, Matthews finished third among three frontrunners in the Democratic primary, behind Raskin and businessman David Trone Democratic politics On March 1, 2017, Bruce Poole resigned as Chair of the Maryland Democratic Party, and on March 2, Matthews was chosen to be the interim Chair. On May 6, she was elected to a four-year term as state party Chair. Matthews promised to renew a state party infrastructure that has deteriorated in recent years, especially outside traditional Democratic strongholds in Baltimore City and Prince George's and Montgomery counties. She promised to pursue an ‚Äúall-Maryland strategy‚Äù to recruit and support candidates. In December, 2018 she was replaced as Chair by Maya Rockeymoore Cummings.  Personal life  She has been married to Chris Matthews, host of Hardball and The Chris Matthews Show since 1980. They live in Chevy Chase, Maryland and have three children: Michael (1983), Thomas (1986) and Caroline (1989).

Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230 (2006), is a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States involving a Vermont law which placed a cap on financial donations made to politicians. The court ruled that Vermont's law, the strictest in the nation, unconstitutionally hindered the citizens' First Amendment right to free speech.. A key issue in the case was the 1976 case Buckley v. Valeo,. which many justices felt needed to be revisited.  Opinion of the Court  The 6-3 ruling dealt with three individual issues before the court.First Amendment Library - Case *Did Vermont's law violate the First Amendment, Fourteenth Amendment, following the Supreme Court ruling in Buckley v. Valeo, which struck down limits on campaign expenditures as unconstitutional? *Did Vermont violate the right of political parties to make independent expenditures in accordance with the aforementioned amendments, following the Supreme Court ruling in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC? *Did Vermont's contribution limits, which are the lowest in the country, allow only a single maximum contribution over a two-year election cycle, and prohibit state political parties from contributing more than $400 to their gubernatorial candidate, fall below an acceptable constitutional threshold and should be struck down? In Buckley, the Supreme Court had upheld contribution limits on the basis of the government's \\"compelling interest\\" in preventing political corruption or its appearance, but had left open the possibility that if limits were set so low as to prevent speakers from effectively presenting their message to the public, such limits might be unconstitutional. The State of Vermont argued that new circumstances and experiences since Buckley v. Valeo was decided in 1976 suggested that the law should be upheld as Constitutional. The Supreme Court ruled against the state of Vermont on all three issues, reaffirming both Buckley and Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee and striking down the law as unconstitutional.The Supreme Court, 2005 Term ‚Äî Leading Cases, 120 Harv. L. Rev. 283 (2006). Randall is particularly important as the first case in which the Supreme Court has struck down a contribution limit as unconstitutionally low.

Life Roseline was born at the ch√¢teau of Les Arcs-sur-Argens, Var, in eastern Provence, near Draguignan. Having overcome her father's opposition, Roseline became a Carthusian nun at Bertaud in the Alps of Dauphin√©. Her consecration took place in 1288, and in about 1330 she succeeded her aunt, Blessed Jeanne (Diane) de Villeneuve, as Prioress of La Celle-Robaud in the Diocese of Fr√©jus near her home. In 1320 her brother H√©lion de Villeneuve, Grand Master (1319‚Äì46) of the Knights of St. John, restored the monastery, and in 1323 and 1328 Pope John XXII, formerly Bishop of Fr√©jus, increased its revenue, granting indulgences for the anniversary of the dedication of the church. Roseline obtained leave to resign her office before her death. Many visions together with extraordinary austerities and great power over demons are ascribed to her. Veneration The feast of Saint Roseline is on 17 January.Patron Saints Index: Blessed Rosalina of Villeneuve Her feast is given in the Acta Sanctorum on 11 June, the day of the first translation of her remains in 1334 by her brother Elz√©ar, Bishop of Digne; but by the Carthusian Order it is celebrated on 16 October. There has always been a local cultus and this was confirmed for the Diocese of Fr√©jus by a Decree of 1851, for the Carthusian Order in 1857. The saint is usually represented with a reliquary containing two eyes, recalling the fact that her eyes were removed and preserved apart. This relic was still extant at Arcs in 1882. There is no ancient life of the saint, but that given in the Acta Sanctorum, 2 June, 489 sq., was constructed by Papebroch from ancient documents. Her shrine, situated at Les Arcs-sur-Argens near Draguignan, has been for six centuries a place of pilgrimage. The Ch√¢teau Sainte Roseline has been transformed into a residence and its cellar is a venue for wine-tasting.

Each level has three tracks and two island platforms. The upper level serves the BMT West End Line while the lower level formerly served the BMT Culver Line. Only the upper level is still in service and is served by the D train at all times.  History  The Ninth Avenue station opened on June 24, 1916, along with the first portion of the BMT West End Line from 36th Street on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line to 18th Avenue station. The line was originally a surface excursion railway to Coney Island, called the Brooklyn, Bath and Coney Island Railroad, which was established in 1862, but did not reach Coney Island until 1864. Under the Dual Contracts of 1913, an elevated line was built over New Utrecht Avenue, 86th Street and Stillwell Avenue. The platforms were extended in the 1950s to accommodate the current standard B Division train length of . The station was renovated in 2012 with new platform edges, a new dispatcher room and a new stairway that leads to the 36th Street Yard. Station layout Both levels of the station have three tracks and two island platforms. =Upper level= The upper level is the only one in use. The center express track is not normally used, and thus only the local tracks are in regular service. On the upper level, the Manhattan-bound platform is slightly wider than the Coney Island-bound platform. Towards the west end of the upper level platforms is an employee-only pedestrian bridge that leads to the entrance of the 36th‚Äì38th Street Yard via a high turnstile. A control tower for line at the south end of the yard. =Lower level= The lower level was used as a through route for the BMT Culver Line to the BMT Fourth Avenue subway and the BMT Fifth Avenue elevated lines until 1954, when service on the main portion of the BMT Culver Line route was recaptured by the Independent Subway System via the Culver Ramp. A Culver Shuttle service from this station to a new single track terminal at Ditmas Avenue began at the same time. Some Culver trains continued to operate into Manhattan until May 1959. Culver Shuttle service was discontinued on May 11, 1975. The lower level was abandoned afterwards and has not been used for passenger service. The level is dark and there are no safety plates on the two staircases to that level. A fluorescent light remains on the southbound side. The next stop for this shuttle to the south (east) was Fort Hamilton Parkway. The tracks curve just east of the station before the center and southbound local end at bumper blocks, at the east end of the tunnel portal. The northbound local continues past the portal and runs along another track coming from the 36th‚Äì38th Street Yard, but does not connect with it. This track was the track used during Ninth Avenue‚ÄìDitmas Avenue shuttle operation from 1959 until 1975. Use as filming location The lower level was used for the filming of the original Crocodile Dundee (1986) movie when it posed as the 59th Street‚ÄìColumbus Circle station at the end of the movie. The \\"9\\" wall mosaics and the sunlight seen at the very end of the film made it clear it was Ninth Avenue. The abandoned lower level also appeared in a pivotal violent scene from the film Joker (2019). =Exits= The station house is at street level near the intersection of 9th Avenue and New Utrecht Avenue, and there is a sealed entrance on the west side. The tablet grilles in the mezzanine are still intact and a newsstand once stood opposite the current location of the station agent booth. Track layout As the West End line rises from embankment to elevated east of this station, the BMT Culver right-of-way can be seen leaving the tunnel on the Manhattan-bound side. Only one track leaves the tunnel, dead-ending approximately later before Fort Hamilton Parkway with no further connections. There is also a platform present. The platform was installed in the late 1980s for New York City Transit employees only and is not part of the right-of-way. To the west of the station is a complicated track layout complete with track connections from the Fourth Avenue Line, ramps from the now-demolished Fifth Avenue El, and ramps from the 36th‚Äì38th Street Yard, combining together to form the six tracks and two levels of the station. Beyond the ramps, as the line curves under the BMT Fourth Avenue Line, there are tracks that continue straight into the piers on the Sunset Park waterfront that were once operated by the South Brooklyn Railway. In the tunnel approaching 36th Street station, there is an unused trackway that was supposed to connect to the South Brooklyn Railway. The tunnel connection was never built. This trackway merges to the southbound track and runs for a long distance before ending at a wall.

The reservoir was created in 1943 when the federal government built a dam to provide fresh water for shipbuilding and shipping industries on the Houston Ship Channel during World War II. After the war, the management of the reservoir was assumed by the City of Houston. In 1952, after the construction of the dam that creates Lake Houston, the city sold the reservoir to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department for use as a waterfowl sanctuary and public fishing site. In 1984, the land around the reservoir was designated the Sheldon State Wildlife Management Area. Fish and plant populations Sheldon Lake along Garrett Rd. Sheldon Lake has been stocked with species of fish intended to improve the utility of the reservoir for recreational fishing. Fish present in Sheldon Lake include catfish, largemouth bass, crappie, bluegill, and sunfish. Recreational uses Birdwatching and fishing are both popular recreational uses of the park. SLSP has four distinct habitats: bottomland woods; restored coastal prairie; open water and marsh of the lake; and cypress swamp. These habitats are a microcosm of those found on the Upper Texas Coast. A five-year bird census of the park was completed in July, 2006. Nearly four dozen additional bird species were added to the park's checklist. The newly revised SLSP bird checklist features 249 bird species. Each spring over 200 bird species are possible. Texas' largest inland waterbird colony can be found on 29+ spoil islands. The nonstop sight and sounds of this colony is best viewed from along the west levee. This colony is growing and now hosts over 2,200 heron, egret, roseate spoonbill, anhinga, Neotropic cormorant and ibis nests each year. Purple gallinule and least bittern also breed on the lake. Also in spring, over 22 Neotropic migrant species are reported. Winter is the next best birding season at SLSP. Over 160 bird species are possible here in winter. Annual winter bird counts find over 90 species of wintering birds on the park in a day. Some winter specialties include ash-throated and vermilion flycatchers, fish crow, Le Conte's and grasshopper sparrows. Also American bittern, canvasback and Ross's goose.

Probably built in the 1840s or 1850s, it is significant as the longtime home of William Lloyd Garrison (1805‚Äì1879), one of the most high-profile abolitionist activists of the mid-19th century United States. Garrison published The Liberator, the principal organ of the abolitionist movement, and spoke for the immediate emancipation of slaves. Despite significant later alterations to accommodate institutional uses, the building has retained much of its 19th-century fabric. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965 and is a pending Boston Landmark. History It is not known exactly when, by whom, or for whom, the house was originally built. It was purchased by William Lloyd Garrison in 1864, and was his home until his death in 1879. It was then acquired by a non- profit organized by African-American supporters called the Rockledge Associates, who sought to preserve the property as a memorial to Garrison. In 1904 it was purchased by the Episcopal Sisters of the Society of St. Margaret, who altered the building to operate a home for needy elderly. In 2012 the Sisters property, including the Garrison House, was purchased by Emmanuel College, which operates its Notre Dame campus there. William Lloyd Garrison (1805‚Äì1879) was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, trained as a printer, and was from an early date involved in the anti-slavery cause. In 1830 he began publishing The Liberator, which, despite a relatively modest circulation, became the leading publication of the abolitionist cause. On its pages Garrison regularly called for the immediate emancipation of all slaves. His advocacy was uncompromising, and upset not only slave-holding interests, but also members of the moderately anti-slavery business community. His advocacy sometimes resulted in physical violence against him and like-minded supporters; in one notable incident in Boston in 1835, Garrison was attacked by a mob and only narrowly escaped serious injury. In 1842 he began advocating a split of the Union if slavery was not abolished. His untiring advocacy provided a moral basis for the actions of Northerners in the American Civil War (1861‚Äì65). Garrison ceased publication of The Liberator in 1865, and semi- retired to Rockledge. He remained active in other progressive causes until his death. Description The core portions of the Garrison house are its two- story main block and a two-story wing extending to the rear of the house. The main block stands on a rock ledge overlooking a grassy park at the base of the ledge. It has Italianate styling, some of which has been obscured by later alterations, with some details that were removed and later restored. The main facade is three bays wide, with single-story porch extending across its width. The porch is currently supported by grouped square columns with simple capitals; these are replacements for 19th-century columns that were more ornate. The main entrance is flanked by sidelight windows, and is framed by a molded surround rising to form a trefoil pattern. The corners of the house are quoined, a feature removed and later restored. Above the main entrance is a projecting oriel window, which is a 20th-century addition. Also a 20th-century addition is the glassed-in porch on the left side of the house. The rear wing has also had a bay window added, and a 19th-century single-story ell was replaced with a two-story mansard-roofed square structure at some time. The only interior spaces that have not been significantly altered are the entry hall and the main parlor (to the right of the entrance).

History ITV West Country launched on 16 February 2009 (as ITV West & Westcountry), and merged the two regions of ITV West and ITV Westcountry into one amalgamated region. The idea was first proposed following a speech by Michael Grade about regional broadcasting post-switchover at the 2007 Nations and Regions conference in Cardiff. There was speculation that ITV West and ITV Westcountry could merge operations,ITV Regional Restructure - Broadcasting - Digital Spy Forums as part of further streamlining of regional operations, and rumours suggested that, while a newsroom (and separate regional identity) would be retained in the south west, the main Westcountry Live programme would move to a studio alongside The West Tonight at ITV West in Bristol. On 12 September 2007, ITV issued a statement to the City of London, saying that it wished to reduce the number of news studios from 17 to just 9. Shortly after the broadcasting regulator Ofcom gave ITV plc the go-ahead to merge the two regions.Digital Spy - Ofcom 'to allow' ITV regional news cuts Studios ITV Westcountry's studio operations were all moved to ITV West's headquarters in Bristol, with the studio facilities at Plympton near Plymouth closed and newsgathering operations moved to a smaller news bureau elsewhere in the city.

The main evening programme at 6pm on weekdays includes separate opt- out bulletins for the first 20 minutes from each of the two regions, some of which are pre-recorded depending on the day's news and due to the use of only one presenting team. The main 6pm evening programme is supplemented by shorter daytime bulletins, with the weekday Good Morning West Country, lunchtime and late night bulletins after the ITV News at Ten consisting of opt-out news for either the 'East' or 'West' of the region.

Description The New Caledonian lorikeet is 18‚Äì19 cm long (the size of a large hand), 7‚Äì8 cm of which is the slim and pointed tail. The wings are slender and pointed, measuring 91 mm in the only specimen. Its tarsus is 16 cm long. Female birds are green overall, with deep violet blue crown and dark bluish thighs, a yellowish face and underside face, and a red anal region. The tail is green above and yellowish olive below, with the four lateral feathers with red basal markings followed by a black band, tipped yellow on the underside. The beak is orange-red, the iris probably dark orange like the feet. Males have not been recorded. Based on similar species, they likely have more red coloration, probably including the face, underside of the primaries and the rump sides; and are likely slightly larger. Immature birds should look like dull females. Its noises are also unknown but--again based on similar species--are likely high-pitched screeches. These would be the most telling sign of the species, but only to observers familiar with other local parrots' vocalizations. While the birds would be unmistakable due to their small size, they are extremely hard to spot. Distribution The provenance of the extant specimen is unknown. One was shot at Mont Ignambi near Oubatche in 1913 (Sarasin & Roux, 1913), but not preserved. Unverified reports exist from west of Mont Pani√© and the Mont Ignambi area in the North Province, and from the La Foa-Canala road and Yat√© Lake in the South Province (Stokes, 1980; Forshaw & Cooper 1989; Ekstrom et al., 2002). Bregulla (1993) suggested it might be in the area around Mont Pani√© and Mont Humboldt--about 60 km SE of Canala--and the Massif du Kouakou√©. Given the low accessibility of the highlands, flocks could, in theory, exist in any of the larger remaining patches of relatively undisturbed forest, e.g., between the intercoastal roads around the province border. Ecology This bird is hard to track because it is nomadic and is relatively inconspicuous. The species is believed to live in humid montane forests but (seasonally?) flies in and out of lowland Melaleuca forests. Most reports come from such lowland forests, but this probably reflects better accessibility. Mt. Ignambi is believed to be an ideal habitat for the species. The Yat√© Lake report was from an area of low shrubland. The bird apparently keeps to treetops. Related species eat nectar, pollen, blossoms, and sometimes soft fruit, foraging in pairs or small (typically fewer than 10) flocks. Erythrina was specifically mentioned as food plants for this species. Reproduction data for 'green' Charmosyna lorikeets is only available for the Red-flanked (C. placentis) and the red-fronted lorikeet (C. rubronotata). Breeding season probably is July‚ÄìDecember, and possibly to February, or even all-year round. They excavate in arboreal termite nests or epiphytic ferns. Clutches consist of two (sometimes three?) white rounded eggs; extrapolating from scant data for relatives, C. diadema eggs probably measure about 19.6 x 18.7 mm. Status Described from two skins (both females) collected somewhere on New Caledonia before 1860 BirdLife International (2000) specifically mentions 1859, but this seems entirely conjectural. It is not even certain whether the first 2 specimens were collected together. At least one was apparently first documented on display of a colonial exhibition in Paris in 1860. (Berlioz 1945). One has since disappeared. The other is in the MNHN (specimen 762A). Sarasin & Roux (1913) report a claim that the species existed near Oubatche; one bird was shot but could not be preserved. Layard & Layard (1882), while not observing birds themselves, report there were rare sightings up to 1880. Forshaw & Cooper (1989) cite Anthony Stokes, who in December 1976 collected reports on sightings: An older local identified it from a colored plate and claimed to have observed a single bird in shrubland near Lake Yat√© \\"many years ago,\\" possibly in the 1920s. A forestry official claimed to have twice seen two individuals fly overhead, once in 1953 or 1954 on the La Foa-Canala road, and once on June 3, 1976, W of Mt Pani√©. However, none of these claims could be confirmed, and all searches (e.g., 1938 by MacMillan) have been fruitless. Stokes also reported that collectors coming to New Caledonia to search for this bird offered rewards for live or dead specimens. Opinion is divided on whether the New Caledonian lorikeet still exists. King (1981) lists it as extinct since 1860, which is certainly not correct. Most authors hope someone will yet rediscover the New Caledonian lorikeet. This hope isn't unrealistic, given that the subject would be a very small, inconspicuous bird in a large, wild area that is difficult for ornithological field work. The 1999 rediscovery of Aegotheles savesi, which was known only from a single male skin for 119 years, provides encouragement. A 6-month search expedition to the Mt. Ignambi area in 1998 did not find the species, and locals were not familiar with it. New surveys of highland rainforests are planned for 2006/2007 . Reasons for the species' rarity are unknown. There seems to have been a marked decline in the numbers of two of the other three parrots native to New Caledonia (the New Caledonian red-crowned parakeet and the horned parakeet. Deplanche's lorikeet is still common), also for unknown reasons. New Caledonian bird populations decline wherever habitat is modified, which supports the hypotheses that human interference impacts the birds in a serious way. However, C. diadema's post-1880 decline--if real--took place too early for habitat destruction to have been a decisive factor. Neither could capture for the cage bird trade have influenced the decline. Introduced cats or rats could have been responsible for the decline, or an introduced disease, or a combination of these factors and subtle habitat changes. For example, the large-scale destruction of lowland forest may have deprived the species of a food source they seasonally depended on. The introduction of cats and European rats in the mid-19th century fits the assumed pattern of decline; however, cats probably didn't spread over the whole island until recent times. Rats, especially black rats, which are arboreal, probably represent a serious threat, but the species did not succumb to the prehistoric arrival of the Polynesian rat. For whatever reason, the New Caledonian lorikeet is an extremely rare and elusive bird. The rarity could be caused in part by the elusiveness. Its relative, the red-throated lorikeet, feared extinct since the beginning of the 20th century, apparently survived in considerable numbers to the 1970s. However, it is more likely C. diadema is genuinely rare. Based on distance between sightings and remaining prime habitat, any remaining populations are probably small and geographically fragmented. The New Caledonian lorikeet, like most parrots, is listed in CITES Appendix II (since June 6, 1981) and European Union regulation 338/97 Appendix B (since June 1, 1997). It is listed as Critically Endangered (D1) by IUCN, which means that the effective population size is likely to be less than fifty individuals. A 2018 study recommended uplisting the species to Critically Endangered - Possibly Extinct, citing bird extinction patterns and the lack of sightings since 1987.

This book details the journey of Veralidaine Sarrasri as she learns more about her wild magic and her journey to Dunlath to help the wolves, only to find there is a bigger and more dangerous plot afoot. Plot summary Daine receives a summons from some old friends‚Äîthe wolf pack from her old village, led by Brokefang and his mate Frostfur, who are unhappy with the nobles ruining the Long Lake, their territory. They send messengers to ask Daine for help and then disappear back into the night to hunt while Daine discusses this over with her teacher, Numair Salmalin. Numair agrees to help the wolves, but he decides that he first must visit the nobles in Fief Dunlath at a party to further investigate after they find the burnt remains of the Ninth Rider Group. Numair recognizes a battle mage at Fief Dunlath, who appears to be wooing Lady Yolane. After Daine boldly approaches them about the threat to the wolves and to the area with a warning that if they don't change, things will happen, the nobles all laugh at her. She retires with Numair back to their quarters and they stealthily leave in the night from Fief Dunlath. Tristan Staghorn, the mage in Dunlath is a war mage from the Carthaki university where Numair studied to become one of the 7 most powerful mages in the world. Upon discovering Tristan was there, Numair realized that the situation in Dunlath was worse than they had thought. He creates a magical simulacra (clone) of himself and plays on Tristan's knowledge of him back in Carthak, where he was a \\"book-bound idiot.\\" He explains to Daine that people who are Black robe mages study books and learn nothing practical. Daine seems to think he relies too much on the enemy mage's stupidity. Shortly after this, Numair decides to go back to the city where King Jonathan is and warns him of something afoot in Dunlath. Daine stays to sort out the mess with her friend Brokefang and Numair tells her not to do anything extreme or he will lock her in the deepest dankest dungeon he can find when he gets his hands on her again. Throughout the book, Daine reaches the next level in the development of her wild magic as she starts to share minds with animals, a useful ability as she uses the eyes of squirrels and other creatures to spy. This ability soon translates to gaining certain characteristics of animals once she returns to her natural body. Daine discovers she has the power to morph into animals after Maura, Lady Yolane's somewhat plain and much younger sister, runs away from Fief Dunlath. Shortly afterwards, Rikash Moonsword the Stormwing appears to be fond of Maura and he makes Daine rethink her theory about all Stormwings being naturally evil. Maura tells Daine about Yolane's plans to become Queen‚Äîa deal with Emperor Ozorne of Carthak, who is also hinted at causing the siege at Pirate's Swoop in the first book. In the meantime, Daine meets a basilisk named Tkaa, who comes to be an important ally and a partial tutor to Kitten, her dragonet. Tristan creates a magical barrier to isolate fief Dunlath from help. Daine learns that Tristan and his mage friends Alamid and Gissa are going to dump a poison called bloodrain into the river at the north of Dunlath to kill everything living within ten miles of the river. Tristan tries to hurt Daine with his magic, and Numair turns Tristan into an apple tree with a word of power, also causing a tree somewhere in the world to turn into a human.

It is commonly found in woody angiosperms and as a result is often used as an indicator of these plants in the fossil record. It is a member of the oleanoid series, which consists of pentacyclic triterpenoids (such as beta-amyrin and taxerol) where all rings are six- membered. Structure Oleanane is a pentacyclic triterpenoid, a class of molecules made up of six connected isoprene units. The naming of both the ring structures and individual carbon atoms in oleanane is the same as in steroids. As such, it consists of a A, B, C, D, and E ring, all of which are six- membered rings. The structure of oleanane contains a number of different methyl groups, that vary in orientation between different oleananes. For example, in 18-alpha-oleanane contains a downward facing methyl group for the 18th carbon atom, while 18-beta-oleanane contains an upward facing methyl group at the same position. Of note is that fact that the A and B rings of the oleanane structure are identical to that of hopane. As a result, both molecules produce a fragment of m/z 191. Because this fragment is often used to identify hopanes, oleanane can be mis-identified in hopane analysis. Synthesis Like other triterpenoids, are formed from six combined isoprene units. These isoprene units can be combined via a number of different pathways. In eukaryotes (including plants), this pathway is the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. For the formation of steroids and other triterpenoids the isoprenoids are combined into a precursor known as squalene, which then undergoes enzymatic cyclization to produce the various different triterpenoids, including oleanane. Once the oleananes have been transported into rocks or sediments they will undergo further alteration before they are measured.  Measurement in Rock Samples  Oleananes can be identified in extracts from rock samples (or plants) using GC/MS. A GC/MS is a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer. The sample is first injected into the system, then run through as chromatographic column. How fast a material moves through a chromatographic column depends on how long it spends in each of the two stages there. Compounds that partition more into the mobile phase will move faster as opposed to compounds that partition more into the stationary phase. The result of this is a separation of different organic molecules based on their retention time in the GC. After being separated by the GC, the compounds can then be analyzed by a mass spectrometer. Each compound will contain a characteristic mass spectrum, based on the fragments it splits into during ionization in the mass spectrometer. This means that the GC can not only separate different types of molecules, it can also identify them. As mentioned above, they have a characteristic mass fragment at m/z = 191, and thus will appear in the same selected ion chromatograph (SIC) as hopanes. This can help one identify them in GC/MS datasets. Use as a biomarker Oleanane has been identified as a compound in modern day angiosperms. Because of this, its presence is the fossil record has also been used to trace angiosperms through the fossil record. For example, the ratio of 18-alpha-oleanane + 18-beta-oleanane:17-alpha-hopane in rock extracts (and associated petroleums/oils) has been found to correlate (at least broadly) to the presence of angiosperms in the fossil record. In this study, the combination of alpha and beta-oleanane were used as indicators for the presence of angiosperms. They are normalized to hopanes, which are broadly present in almost all rock extracts coming from petroleum. Furthermore, because of the structural similarities between hopanes and oleananes, it is assumed that they will react similarly to the various weathering processes that degrade the biomarkers present. As such, the ratio of hopanes to oleananes should be similar to the initial ratio, and unaffected by processes occurring in the rock after fossilization. There is some delay in the accepted increases in taxonomic diversification of angiosperms (which occurred during the mid-Cretaceous period) and the increase of oleanane concentrations in the fossil record (which occurred in the late-Cretaceous or even after). This could be due to a number of factors, one being that the early angiosperms were more herbaceous than woody and that woody angiosperms only appeared after further taxonomic diversification. Lastly, the study introduced the idea of an \\"oleanane parameter,\\" which could be used in assessing angiosperm input to petroleum sources. This, in turn, gives some idea of the age of said petroleum sources. That being said, the presence of angiosperms may not be the only thing affecting the oleanane content of sediments, rock extracts and petroleum. For example, there is evidence that contact with seawater during early sedimentation processes can increase the concentration of oleananes in the mature sediment. This evidence comes from the fact that various indicators of marine influence (C27/C29 sterane ratios, changes in elemental composition in the downstream direction that are indicative of the infiltration of water into the system and the homophane index). Despite this, it is still unclear as to how marine influence enhances the expression of oleananes (thus increasing observed concentration). Some ideas include the changes in pH, Eh and the microbial environment that come with the interaction with seawater.

Nishimura formerly worked for New Japan Pro- Wrestling (NJPW) and MUGA World Pro Wrestling (MUGA). Professional wrestling career =Early years (1991‚Äì1998)= Nishimura debuted for New Japan Pro- Wrestling (NJPW) in April 1991 after training in their Dojo by Joe Daigo and Tony St. Clair. In 1994, he embarked on a tour of the United States, entering the Global Wrestling Federation in Dallas, Texas, winning its Light Heavyweight Championship on August 26, and eventually becoming the promotion's final champion. A day later, Nishimura was one of eight men chosen to take part in a tournament for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship. In the infamous tournament promoted by Eastern Championship Wrestling (which featured winner Shane Douglas throwing the belt down after winning it), Nishimura was eliminated in the first round by Dean Malenko. In a second tournament hosted by Smoky Mountain Wrestling in November, Nishimura battled Lou Perez to a draw and both men were eliminated. Nishimura returned to Japan when his mentor Tatsumi Fujinami was forming an offshoot promotion called MUGA (Selflessness), which would base its style around traditional catch-as-catch-can wrestling. Nevertheless, the promotion did not catch on and Nishimura left the country once again, targeting Otto Wanz's Catch Wrestling Association, touring throughout Austria and Germany, eventually winning its Submission Shootfighting Championship. =New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1998‚Äì2006)= He returned to New Japan in 1998 and teamed with Shinya Hashimoto in the struggle against NWO Japan's Keiji Mutoh and Masahiro Chono, who held the IWGP Tag Team Championship, but they were unsuccessful. Nishimura also failed to unseat IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kensuke Sasaki, and Nishimura was diagnosed with cancer later in the year. Nishimura was inactive until the cancer went into remission in 2000, following treatment. In 2001, he went to the United States again to polish his skills at the Funking Conservatory in Florida, under the eye of Dory Funk, Jr. (whom Nishimura admired from watching matches of New Japan's founder Antonio Inoki). He blossomed again, winning the FC's United States Championship. After returning to Japan, Nishimura's star was bright enough to warrant an earnest push, and he won the IWGP tag team titles with Fujinami. Nonetheless, the bi-promotional duo of Mutoh and All Japan Pro Wrestling's Taiy≈ç Kea were on the rise, and the two teams clashed over both the IWGP title and AJPW's World Tag Team Championship, both of which ended up around the waists of Mutoh and Kea. In 2002 he teamed with Manabu Nakanishi under the name Gotch-ism, but they failed to win the titles. As Nakanishi began teaming more with Yutaka Yoshie, Nishimura engaged in a feud with the returning Minoru Suzuki, with whom he had a MUGA-style feud that showcased the traditional, scientific skills of both wrestlers. He later began teaming with Hiroyoshi Tenzan, with whom he won another IWGP tag team title in late 2003. They held the belts until February 2004 when they were defeated by Suzuki and Yoshihiro Takayama. As Tenzan focused on the IWGP Heavyweight title, Nishimura aimlessly was relegated to the mid-card. In January 2006, Nishimura opted not to renew his NJPW contract and left the company altogether. In February, he and old MUGA comrade Katsushi Takemura took part in American promotion Chikara's 2006 Tag World Grand Prix, where they made it to the semi-finals, before being defeated by Milano Collection A. T. and Skayde. He also participated in the NWA Reclaiming the Glory tournament, where he attempted to win the NWA World title for a third time, but was defeated in the first round by Brent Albright on Saturday, June 2, 2007. =All Japan Pro Wrestling (2007‚Äìpresent)= On October 20, 2007, Nishimura announced that he and trainee Manabu Soya have signed with All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) as full-time wrestlers, citing unhappiness with the erratic MUGA World scheduling. From November 23 to December 9, 2007, Nishimura teamed with Masanobu Fuchi to compete in the World's Strongest Tag Determination League, finishing the league with 7 points (2 wins, 2 losses and 3 draws) and placing 5th overall. In November 2007, Nishimura announced plans to form a tag team with Dory Funk, Jr. in 2008, along with claiming that All Japan is planning a retirement ceremony for Funk. =Wrestling New Classic (2013)= On March 31, 2013, Nishimura made his debut for Wrestling New Classic (WNC), defeating Zeus to become the number one contender to the WNC Championship. On April 25, he defeated Akira to become the second WNC Champion. A month later, Nishimura joined Akira's villainous Synapse stable. On August 8, Nishimura lost the WNC Championship to Tajiri in his first defense.

It contains the only virgin tropical rain forest left in the heart of Kuala Lumpur. The Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve is located here, and is open to the public. There are jungle trails, a visitors centre, and a forestry museum. A number of notable buildings, such as the landmark Kuala Lumpur Tower, are located on Bukit Nanas. The area is served by the Bukit Nanas Monorail station. History A trail in the KL Forest Eco Park Bukit Nanas is known to be one of the earliest Malay settlements in Kuala Lumpur and the center of Malay power there. In around 1857, Raja Abdullah of Klang raised funds to open tin mines in the Ampang area, and in doing so, initiating the development of Kuala Lumpur as a major settlement on banks of the Klang River that would serve the mines further inland. To strengthen his authority in the area, Raja Abdullah then sent his Bugis lieutenant Syahbandar Yaseh with some armed men to serve as the garrison for Kuala Lumpur. Yaseh selected Bukit Nanas as the location to build a stockade in the 1860s. A map of Kuala Lumpur sketched by Sir Frank Swettenham in 1875 showed a place marked as \\"Malay Rajah's house on hill\\" which is likely to be the Bukit Nanas stockade. The place is said to be originally called Bukit Gombak, only later became known as Bukit Nanas. According to one story, pineapples (\\"nanas\\" in Malay) were grown all around the stockade as a deterrence against attackers during the Klang War by Raja Asal, the place then came to be known as Bukit Nanas meaning \\"Pineapple Hill\\". The Klang War was sparked off in part due to Yaseh's mishandling of a dispute with the Sumatran Batu Bahara community in the area. A member of the Yaseh's garrison killed someone named Enche' Rasul from the Batu Bahara community. Raja Abdullah refused to punish the Bugis man, and the Sumatrans led by Mohamed Akib then suggested to Raja Mahdi, who at that time was involved in a dispute with Raja Abdullah, that they would support him should he wish to attack Raja Abdullah. Raja Mahdi happily accepted the offer and initiated the Klang War in 1867. Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa, leaders of Sumatran Mandailing settlers in Selangor, also switched side to Raja Mahdi. Raja Asal laid siege to Bukit Nanas, where Tengku Kudin's men and various mercenaries including Europeans were stationed. Yaseh himself was killed In 1872 in the war. The siege forced Tengku Kudin's men to try to escape, but they were captured at Petaling and killed. Yap Ah Loy (a Hakka clan Leader), the Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur, however, managed to escape to Klang. Kuala Lumpur was then taken by Raja Mahdi's forces and destroyed. Traces of a tunnel dating to the Klang War period have been found in Bukit Nanas. In 1906, 17.5 hectare of land on Bukit Nanas was gazetted as a forest reserve. Large parts however have since been used for the development of the Kuala Lumpur Tower and other purposes, and now only 9.3 hectares of the forest reserve remains. It was initially known as Bucket Weld Forest Reserve, later renamed Bukit Nanas Forest Reserve, and now known as KL Forest Eco Park. The local Chinese communities living around Kuala Lumpur during that time named it \\"Coffee Hill\\" (\\"Kopi San\\"). Two of Malaysia's many British colonial-era schools were built on this hill in the early twentieth century. They are the St John's Institution first established in 1904 and Convent Bukit Nanas. St. John's Institution has been gazetted as a National Heritage Site by the federal government. Another landmark on Bukit Nanas is the Roman Catholic St John's Cathedral. A cable car service was built in Bukit Nanas in the 1970s but it has been discontinued since the 1980s. In August 2012 the forest was closed to the public whilst the cable car was rebuilt. The forest trail has since reopened, however, the cable car service has not yet been restored as of January 2017. In 1996, the Kuala Lumpur Tower, which is the seventh tallest telecommunications tower in the world was built on the hill. It has an observation deck, a banquet floor and a revolving restaurant. The Bukit Nanas Monorail station opened in 2003.

Ultimate Stars details dished\\", GameSpot, September 28, 2006, It is the sequel to Jump Super Stars. The game was released in Japan on November 23, 2006. The game keeps many features from its predecessor, and adds many more. The game boasts 305 characters (56 of which are fully playable) from 41 different Sh≈çnen manga series.  Gameplay  The bulk of the gameplay is based around using manga panels that represent characters to create decks on a four by five grid. Panels come in various shapes and sizes, taking up one to eight blocks. There are three kinds of panels that can be initialized in battle: Battle, Support, and Help panels, with decks needing at least one of each type and an assigned leader before being playable. Battle panels are four to eight block panels that represent playable characters. They are based on various manga panels and are used to represent what kind of special attacks the characters have. Support panels are two or three block panels that represent non-playable characters that can perform actions such as attacks, healing or status effects. Help panels are one block panels that can give different boosts to characters they are placed next to. Each battle panel comes with a certain nature. These natures (Knowledge, Strength, and Laughter) act in a Rock, Paper, Scissors relationship with Strength beating Knowledge, Knowledge beating Laughter, and Laughter beating Strength. The stronger type will deal more damage to the weaker type. New panels can be unlocked by clearing challenges in Story Mode, or evolving existing panels using gems collected in Story Mode to unlock new paths and panels, such as stronger variations of Battle panels. = Battle = Battles commence in arenas made to look like the page of a manga. Each arena has a unique background, obstacles based on the different manga series, and contain a variety of different platforms. Many are static while others will move, break, or disappear and reappear randomly. Certain walls and floors are also destructible. During battles, players use their Battle komas to attack opponents, defeating them once they have taken enough damage or have knocked them off the stage. = New features = Jump Ultimate Stars has been changed slightly from the gameplay of Jump Super Stars. Jump Ultimate Stars gives battle characters the ability to dash and to do a new attack while guarding, which, instead of breaking the guard of the opponent, forces them to change characters, and can be identified by a green glow coming out of the characters which executes it. Also, certain seven and eight panel koma (along with certain five and six panel koma) obtain a visual difference during battle as opposed to the appearance of the one to six koma of the very same character; some of these variations also bring a totally different set of attacks to the character (e.g. Luffy becomes Luffy (Gear 2nd) for his Level 7 & 8 koma, Naruto Uzumaki becomes Kyubii Naruto for his Level 7 & 8 koma, and Ichigo becomes Bankai Ichigo for his Level 7 & 8 level koma). Battle characters now have a new ability known as Ultimate Actions (UA). These UA are different for each character, as some recover health, other recover SP, while others can be used to dodge enemy attacks. Another new feature added is the Evolution Chart. This area allows players to upgrade their characters by spending gems (currency earned for KO'ing opponents) to buy a new koma. Each character has a chart, starting from the one block help koma and branching off into the two and three block Support and the four to eight block Battle koma. Some characters have alternate block paths which unlock a different type for that character (e.g. Goku as a Laughter type instead of a Power type), while others can be used to unlock koma for characters from the same series, quizzes for the series, and new worlds in the Story Mode.  Represented series and characters  This is a list of represented series in Jump Ultimate Stars. Most of the main characters from each series appear as characters within the game. Note that almost all of the Battle characters are also Support and Help characters. This is also true for Support characters being Help characters. However, the exceptions are Sasuke Uchiha, Raoh, Frieza, Majin Buu and Heihachi Edajima; these characters do not have a Support character koma, but they do have their Help koma alternative. The asterisk marks newly included series. There are 24 returning series with the addition of 17 new ones, concluding 41 in total. * Black Cat ** 5 characters (2 Battle, 1 Support, 2 Help) ** Battle characters: Eve and Train Heartnet * Bleach ** 17 characters (4 Battle, 7 Support, 6 Help) ** Battle characters: Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, T≈çshir≈ç Hitsugaya and Renji Abarai ** Ichigo Kurosaki evolves into Ichigo Bankai (Lv7) and Ichigo Bankai with Hollow Mask (Lv8) * Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo ** 12 characters (2 Battle, 4 Support, 6 Help) ** Battle characters: Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo and Don Patch * Buso Renkin ** 4 characters (1 Battle, 0 Support, 3 Help) ** Battle character: Kazuki Muto * Captain Tsubasa* 5 characters (0 Battle, 3 Support, 2 Help) * Cobra* 3 characters (all Support) * D.Gray-man ** 9 characters (2 Battle, 3 Support, 4 Help) ** Battle characters: Allen Walker and Lenalee Lee * Death Note ** 5 characters (all Support) ** Light Yagami and Ryuk count as a single character. * Dr. Slump ** 7 characters (2 Battle, 2 Support, 3 Help) ** Battle characters: Arale Norimaki and Dr. Mashirito * Dragon Ball ** 13 characters (7 Battle, 2 Support, 4 Help) ** Battle characters: Son Goku, Vegeta, Son Gohan (Super Saiyan form), Gotenks, Piccolo, Freeza and Majin Buu ** Goku evolves into Super Saiyan Goku (Lv6), Super Saiyan 2 Goku (Super Saiyan 3 in his Kamehameha state) (Lv7) and Super Saiyan Vegetto (Lv8) ** Vegeta evolves into Super Saiyan Vegeta (Lv5) and Super Saiyan 2 Vegeta (Lv6) ** Gohan evolves into Super Saiyan 2 Gohan (Lv5) ** Gotenks evolves into Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks (Lv5, Lv6) ** Son Goten, Kami, Nail and Dende were removed from the Dragon Ball cast * Eyeshield 21 ** 17 characters (0 Battle, 11 Support, 6 Help) ** The Ha-Ha Brothers count as a single character * Fist of the North Star* 7 characters (2 Battle, 2 Support, 3 Help) ** Battle characters: Kenshiro and Raoh * Gin Tama ** 13 characters (2 Battle, 6 Support, 5 Help) ** Battle characters: Gintoki Sakata and Kagura * Hoshin Engi* 4 characters (1 Battle, 1 Support, 2 Help) ** Battle character: Taikoubou * Hunter √ó Hunter ** 7 characters (2 Battle, 3 Support, 2 Help) ** Battle characters: Gon Freecss and Killua Zoldyck * I\\"s* 4 characters (0 Battle, 2 Support, 2 Help) * Strawberry 100% ** 7 characters (0 Battle, 4 Support, 3 Help) * Jigoku Sensei N≈´bƒì* 4 characters (0 Battle, 2 Support, 2 Help) * JoJo's Bizarre Adventure ** 10 characters (2 Battle, 6 Support, 2 Help) ** Battle characters: Jotaro Kujo (With Star Platinum) and Dio Brando (With the World) * Jungle King Tar-chan* 4 characters (0 Battle, 1 Support, 3 Help) * Katekyo Hitman Reborn! ** 10 characters (1 Battle, 6 Support, 3 Help) ** Battle character: Tsuna Sawada (paired with Reborn) * Kinnikuman* 10 characters (1 Battle, 7 Support, 2 Help) ** Battle character: Kinnikuman * Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari K≈çen-mae Hashutsujo ** 15 characters (1 Battle, 8 Support, 6 Help) ** Battle character: Kankichi Ryotsu * Majin Tantei N≈çgami Neuro* 4 characters (1 Battle, 0 Support, 3 Help) ** Battle character: Neuro Nogami (paired with Yako Katsuragi) * Midori no Makiba≈ç* 3 characters (0 Battle, 2 Support, 1 Help) * Muhyo & Roji's Bureau of Supernatural Investigation* 7 characters (1 Battle, 4 Support, 2 Help) ** Battle character: Toru Muhyo * Naruto ** 9 characters (4 Battle, 1 Support, 4 Help) ** Battle characters: Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke Uchiha, Sakura Haruno and Kakashi Hatake ** Naruto Uzumaki evolves into Naruto Ky≈´bi (Lv7) ** Rock Lee, Neji Hyuuga, Hinata Hyuuga and Shikamaru Nara were removed from the Naruto cast * Ninku* 3 characters (1 Battle, 0 Support, 2 Help) ** Battle character: Fuusuke * One Piece ** 10 characters (6 Battle, 2 Support, 2 Help) ** Battle characters: Monkey D.

It details the peace delegation sent by Tortall to Carthak which Daine joins, to save the emperor's birds. Plot introduction Daine travels with a Tortallan embassy to Carthak in order to help cure the Emperor's birds of a mysterious sickness, as well to improve relations with the hostile country. Plot summary Daine is sent with a delegation that includes both Sir Gareths of Naxen, Alanna the Lioness, and Numair Salmalin, to the Emperor Mage of Carthak, in hopes that she can smooth the international relations by helping with his prized birds. All seems well in the elaborate court of the charming emperor, who continues to proclaim his innocence in stirring up troubles in Tortall and seems to truly care for his prized aviary. This soothes the nervous delegation, though the situation is complicated by Numair, who had to flee Carthak and Ozorne's ire several years before. Daine makes several friends in Carthak, including Numair's former teacher and close friend Lindhall Reed, Ozorne's heir and nephew Kaddar, and a marmoset named Zekoi. She also is reunited with the Stormwing Rikash Moonsword, who seems to bear her no significant ill will and in fact warns her several times about the trouble brewing in the empire. Despite her best efforts, she gets caught up in not only the political situation, but a religious one as well. Emperor Ozorne Muhassin Tasikhe has been neglecting the worship of the gods, primarily the chief Goddess of Carthak, the Graveyard Hag. To Daine's surprise and later chagrin, she realizes that the Graveyard Hag has given her the ability to revive dead bodies, which leads to a series of mixed episodes which includes the revival of an only partly assembled Archaeopteryx skeleton and culminates in the revival of a whole nest of dinosaur eggs and nestlings. The reanimation of the nest results in Daine killing herself and having to get forcibly revived by the Badger god. During the time she is \\"dead,\\" she gets a brief image of her mother with a mysterious horned stranger. Daine fights her newly given \\"gift,\\" which cannot be taken away except by the Graveyard Hag, who has supreme power in Carthak as the primary goddess. It is noted that the only one more powerful in Carthak is the Black God, god of death, but she is his daughter and he listens to her in matters involving Carthak. The Graveyard Hag urges Daine, as her vessel, to act by causing chaos with the revival of the human dead to get Emperor Ozorne to remember the gods once more. Daine is understandably disinclined to do so. During her time healing the birds, Daine realizes that the birds illness is caused by metal paint that they are eating saying that it tastes good (it contains salt as well as lead) When she tells this to Ozorne, he congratulates her and gives her a drug to make her sleep in her food. Meanwhile, the Tortallan party is planning to leave Carthak, but Numair will not leave his \\"magelet\\" behind. Daine is rescued from the dungeon by Zek, who is very fascinated by keys. She then meets up with Prince Kaddar. He tells her that Ozorne had Numair killed. Daine is overcome with fury. Using her power to revive dead beings to create an army out of the hall of bones. While looking for Ozorne, she meets with Numair's ex-lover. Daine tells her that Numair is dead. Daine finds the Hyenas and transforms into one. Using their excellent sense of smell, they hunt down Ozorne. They are about to attack him when he stabs himself with the Stormwing feather given to him by Rikash. Ozorne turns into a stormwing and flies away with the rest of them. Daine turns around to see Kaddar, Lindhall, and Numair. Losing her grip on her Hyena self, Daine transforms into her human, naked self. Numair gives her his robe and tells her that a Simulacrum of himself was caught and \\"killed\\" by Ozorne, not the real Numair. Then, the Graveyard Hag comes and takes the power of reviving the dead from Daine. Four days later, Daine wakes up to find Alanna at her side. She then goes to talk to His Imperial Highness, Kaddar. He tells Daine that she can have whatever she wants for saving his life (his uncle was planning to have him accused of treason of plotting against him). Daine asks that the people who have wild magic and the emperor's mutes must be released from slavery.

It is a combination of kyphosis and scoliosis. This musculoskeletal disorder often leads to other issues in patients, such as under-ventilation of lungs, pulmonary hypertension, difficulty in performing day-to-day activities, psychological issues emanating from anxiety about acceptance among peers, especially in young patients. It can also be seen in syringomyelia, Friedreich's ataxia, spina bifida, kyphoscoliotic Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndrome (kEDS), and Duchenne muscular dystrophy due to asymmetric weakening of the paraspinal muscles.  Signs and symptoms  The following are clear signs of Kyphoscoliosis: * Abnormal hunch along with a presence of S or C-like shape.  Presence of associated disorders like hypertension, neurological disorders * Abnormal gait = Kyphosis = Kyphosis by itself refers to an excessive convex curvature of spine occurring in the thoracic and sacral regions. A normal thoracic curvature from the 1st to the 12th spine has a naturally occurring convex shape with angles ranging from 20 degrees to 45 degrees. When the curvature goes past 45 degrees, the condition is termed as Kyphosis. Kyphosis, depending on the extent of curvature can result in many discomforts including breathing and digestion difficulties, cardiovascular issues, and even neurological deformities. The greater the extent of deformity, the more pressing the need becomes for a surgery. Kyphosis by itself is of several types, including postural kyphosis caused by slouching. Such forms of kyphosis can be reversed to a certain extent by correcting muscular imbalances. The more debilitating version of kyphosis is Scheuermann‚Äôs kyphosis, found mostly in teenagers. There are few other causes of Kyphosis as well, such as congenital, nutritional or osteoporosis induced and post-traumatic. Depending on the type of Kyphosis, the extent of curvature, the age of the patient, various treatment modalities can be suggested including the provision for posture correction, braces, physiotherapy for correcting the muscular imbalance, and finally the surgery. Surgery can be most useful in patients who have an extensive deformity. The rate of post-surgery complications may be higher in elderly patients. = Scoliosis = Scoliosis refers to yet another form of abnormal curvature in which the person‚Äôs spine takes an \\"S\\" or \\"C\\" shape. Scoliosis has forms of treatments available similar to those for kyphosis including bracing, physical therapy and various types of surgeries. Typically, a human spine is straight laterally, but in scoliosis patients, there may be a curve of ten degrees in either direction, left or right.  Cause  Kyphoscoliosis may manifest in an individual at different stages of life and for various causes. When present at a young age ranging from childhood to teenage, kyphoscoliosis may be present from birth due to congenital abnormalities including spina bifida. Certain infections can also lead to the development of kyphoscoliosis such as vertebral tuberculosis or general tuberculosis. Osteochondrodysplasia, a disorder related to the development of bone and cartilage, can also cause this disease. In later ages, kyphoscoliosis can occur in patients suffering from chronic degenerative diseases like osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. This type of incidence is usually seen in patients above 50 years of age and is mainly attributed to structural changes in the spine and adjoining tissues. Sometimes, a traumatic injury can also lead to its development. Further, there are many idiopathic occurrences of kyphoscoliosis where the exact cause is not very well known but is suspected to be caused by genetic factors. Diagnosis Kyphoscoliosis is one of the main criteria in kyphoscoliotic Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndrome. It is caused by mutation in the PLOD1 gene and/or FKBP14https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/gene/FKBP14 gene. The diagnosis is confirmed by molecular testing and suggested when a patient meets criteria 1 and criteria 2: congenital muscle hypotonia and congenital or early onset kyphoscoliosis (progressive or non-progressive), respectively.Brady AF, Demirdas S, Fournel- Gigleux S, Ghali N, Giunta C, Kapferer-Seebacher I, Kosho T, Mendoza-Londono R, Pope MF, Rohrbach M, Van Damme T, Vandersteen A, van Mourik C, Voermans N, Zschocke J, Malfait F. 2017. \\"The Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndromes, rare types\\". American Journal of Medical Genetics Part C: Seminars in Medical Genetics 175C:70‚Äì115. Treatments thumbSkeletal specimen of adult female showing kyphoscoliosis (curvature of the spine), 1830‚Äì1860. Photographer: Kikel, V. R. The decision to choose a particular treatment approach very much depends on multiple factors such as the age of the patient, understanding the root cause of the condition i.e. postural, congenital, etc., risks involved in surgery for the patient, etc. * Physical therapy: When the extent of curvature is mild, and the underlying cause is bad posture, and then physical therapy becomes the first line of treatment. Physical therapy may also be advised for other causes as well to delay the development of abnormal curvatures, such as in the case of elderly patients suffering from the degenerative disease of bones and cartilage. The primary objective of physical therapy is to strengthen the spinal tissues for either correcting the curvature to the maximum extent possible or contain further damage. * Back braces: In the cases when the underlying reason for deformity is postural and is detected before the growing age of bones, braces can be used. Braces provide support to the muscles and bones, as well as apply corrective pressure to reduce the curvature. The braces for kyphoscoliosis have to be designed such that it becomes effective with both abnormal curvatures in the coronal and sagittal plan. The latest in brace design is through the use of CAD/CAM, which is available only in few developed countries such as Germany. The efficacy of braces for correcting curvature issues has been analyzed by a few studies. In one such study, it was found that bracing led to successful outcomes in 72% of patients and correlated strongly with hours of braces worn. However, compliance with wearing braces for a period up to 18 hours or more can be physiologically and psychologically limiting, especially when one considers the teenage period. * Surgery: see below. * Oxygen on long term may be necessary in patients with significant hypoxemia. = Surgery = Surgery is usually indicated when the extent of deformity is large, causes issues in physiological functions such as breathing, interferes with the daily activities or cosmetically unacceptable to the adult. It is also advised when the patient has passed the age where other therapies such as braces are no longer effective. Kyphoscoliosis implies that the patient has both types of curvature deformity. The decision to undergo surgery or not is always a complex one, but sometimes, it becomes inevitable such as when the deformity begins to interface with crucial physiological functions like breathing or makes every day normal activities extremely painful. Sometimes, patients in their early adulthood may choose to have surgery because the presence of such deformity causes social issues such as acceptability among their peers, a disability that comes in the way of working, etc. In the case of elderly patients who suffer from such deformity triggered at a later age, other factors are to be considered such as the presence of underlying disease that caused it, whether a progressive decline is expected, and if conservative treatments using physiotherapy or drugs have failed to give relief from debilitating pain. Surgical correction is attempted in some to fix the spine and arrest progression of the deformity. Surgical operations may include the use of spinal implants like the Harrington Rod, or the VEPTR. = Risks of corrective spine surgery: studies = A study measured outcome from surgery of 49 cases of scoliosis and kyphoscoliosis. Of this sample, 36 patients were monitored for a period of 8 years. * 23% ‚Äì excellent condition * 29% ‚Äì good condition * 34% ‚Äì satisfactory * 14% ‚Äì bad 'Bad' refers to cases where the surgery failed to address the disease and the patient either had to undergo a revision surgery or continues to suffer from a poor quality of life as before surgery. Typically post-surgery complications range up to 5% involving all major and minor complications when measured within one year of surgery. However, there may be a progressive decline in patient's condition after a few years. In another study that evaluated surgical treatment of kyphoscoliosis and scoliosis due to congenital reasons, 91% of surgeries were found to be successful and met their intended objectives for the two-year follow-up period after surgery. The sample consisted of 23 patients of whom 17 were male and 6 were female, with an average age of 27 years, ranging from 13 to 61 years. The most popular type of surgeries for spinal correction includes pedicle subtraction osteotomy (PSO) and posterior vertebral column resection (pVCR). Another study which focused on elderly patients found that the rate of complications was much higher for a sample population of 72 cases with mean age of 60.7 years. The rate of complications was as high as 22% in the entire sample. The study points that in the case of elderly patients, surgery should only be considered when there is no other option left; the disease is in progression stage, and the quality of life has degraded to an extent where conservative treatments can no longer help with pain. While there are many surgical approaches for spinal deformity correction including anterior only, posterior only, anterior-posterior, the techniques that are most popular nowadays include the posterior only VCR or pVCR. One of the studies which analyze pVCR technique also noted the benefit of using a technique called NMEP monitoring in assisting the surgeon avoid any neurological complications while performing a spine surgery.

Plot introduction (From the back of the book cover) Daine and the mage Numair are faced with certain death when they are suddenly swept into the mystical realms of the gods, where Daine learns the secrets of her past. But she and Numair are both needed in the mortal world to help fight the desperate war that is raging in Tortall. And so they undertake the journey home ‚Äì a dangerous journey that will teach them about life and about each other. Their path leads them to the final clash, which involves both gods and immortals ‚Äì a battle in which the only chance for Tortall's future lies with Daine and her wild magic. Set in Tortall during the reign of King Jonathan IV and Queen Thayet, Realms of the Gods is the final book in The Immortals series, which chronicles a time when the world is invaded by immortal creatures. Plot summary In this final book of Daine's story, she and Numair are teleported to the Divine Realms. Daine's mother, Sarra, is now the Green Lady, a minor goddess of healing and childbirth in the northern provinces. Although it has been hinted at before, Daine's father is revealed in this book as none other than the minor Northern God of the Hunt, Weiryn. Despite her happiness at being reunited with her long dead mother. However, getting into the realm of the gods is much easier than getting out, so, aided by the badger god and the god of platypi, Daine and Numair must travel a very perilous road to the dragons, to petition them for help in getting back to the city of Tortall. It is revealed that Numair Salmalin harbored very strong feelings for Daine, though she had not believed it to be anything serious. After saving her life from spidrens, Numair forgets himself and kisses Daine, admitting he loves her very much. Daine also loves him, but the two have doubts about a lasting relationship because of their age difference; Daine is sixteen, and Numair is twenty-seven (as quoted by Tamora Pierce through interview). Despite this, Numair asks Daine to marry him in the epilogue of the book. Daine does not agree yet, but it is revealed that they do live together in another one of Tamora Pierce's books, First Test. In Daughter of the Lioness, two other books of Tamora Pierce, they are married and have children. They go through many perils just to reach the Dragonlands. Two dragons agree to bring them back. In the mortal realms, there is a major attack on the city of Tortall. In this fight, Daine defeats Emperor Ozorne. Daine then has to decide whether to stay in the mortal realms as a mortal or live in the Divine Realms as a minor goddess with her mother and father. With some discussion with her mother and Weiryn, her father, she decides her true home is the mortal realm.

The Dictionary contains words collected from all written forms, since the first Lithuanian published book in 1547 until 2001. History The idea of the Dictionary belongs to Lithuanian philologist Kazimieras B≈´ga. He started collecting material for the dictionary in 1902 and had over 617,000 cards with words, part of them from Antanas Ju≈°ka dictionary. The first part of the dictionary was printed in 1924, the complete first volume in 1941 (letters A-B) under supervision of Juozas Balƒçikonis. The second volume appeared in 1947, and together with the first it was banned and hidden by the Soviet authorities because of ideological reasons. These volumes are now bibliographical rarities. The first and second volumes had to be republished later. Work continued as the third volume was published in 1956, although it was difficult under the Soviet regime; some words (especially religious) were forced to be omitted. The loss was restored after Lithuania regained independence and ideological barriers were removed. The work on the dictionary took more than six decades by many generations of linguists. It was finished in 2005, and an online version has appeared. The dictionary is available printed, on CD-ROM and online.

In 1230 the manor was granted by Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall (younger brother of King Henry III) to Henry le Tyes. The manor remained the property of the Le Tyes family until 1322 when Henry Lord Tyes took part in the revolt against King Edward II and was executed, his estate passing to his sister Alice Lisle. Between this date and 1563 the manor passed between a number of members of the Lisle family and the crown. In 1611 the manor was sold to George and Thomas Whitmore who in turn sold it to Richard Daniell (George's wife's stepfather), a Truro merchant.Pool, P. A. S.

Penzance Town Council By 1663 ownership of Alverton had changed hands again and was in the hands of William Keigwin whose family held Alverton until 1716 when Uriah Tonkin took up the title. In fact the Tonkin family then held on to the title of Alverton for a very long time, for almost two and a half centuries. James Jenkins (died 1710), the Cornish scholar, lived at Alverton. When Robert Edmund Tonkin died in October 1935, his sole heir, John Franklin Tonkin, acquired the Lord of the Manors of St. Buryan and Alverton. In 1960 J F Tonkin died in New Zealand and left the Lords of the Manors of St. Buryan and Alverton to his daughter, Gillian Green.

Voices, formerly Associated Content (AC), was a division of Yahoo! that focused on online publishing. Yahoo! Voices distributed a large variety of writing through its website and content partners, including Yahoo! News. In early December 2011, its owners Yahoo! announced a major shakeup involving the introduction of a new service, Yahoo! Voices, which would replace the Associated Content site and take on the bulk of its content, while some 75,000 items would be retired under the new site's more stringent content submission rules. On July 2, 2014, Yahoo! announced that it would be shutting down Yahoo! Voices on July 31st and the Yahoo! Contributor Network at the end of August 2014. History Associated Content was started in January 2005 by Luke Beatty. They hired their CTO in March 2006, Sonu Kansal. It was based in Denver, Colorado, with business development, sales and community offices in New York City. In April 2009, Associated Content hired a new CEO, Patrick Keane, formerly of CBS Interactive and Google and closed a $6 million Series C round of funding from Softbank Capital and Canaan Partners. Three weeks after the funding announcement, Associated Content reorganized and laid off 5 employees. On May 19, 2010, Yahoo! announced that it would purchase Associated Content for $90 million.

Publishing platform  In addition to text content (articles), AC featured categories for video, audio, and slide shows along with an online community where users shared their expertise, network and voice opinions. In contrast to many content publishing sites, AC paid many users for content up front. Articles were usually required to be at least 400 words. Pictures were acceptable if from approved sources. The \\"Assignment Desk\\" was another source of article ideas and income for writers. AC displayed predefined article titles and users could \\"claim\\" the assignment. All on-site assignments (as opposed to \\"Partner Assignments\\") paid performance-based revenue while some also offered up-front payment. Content could also be submitted without an up-front payment. All articles written by users who agreed to the contract were eligible to receive payments based on the number of page views. AC sometimes sent work back to contributors for further editing and sometimes rejected work for violations of the site's terms of use and guidelines, including promotional or advertorial content and plagiarism. Motifs Associated Content originally billed itself as \\"The People's Media Company\\". The original schema was linked to its idea that its writers (originally called \\"Content Producers\\") were \\"Citizen Journalists\\". In early 2009, Associated Content rebranded itself on the site as \\"Information from the source\\". Writers on the site, formerly called \\"Content Producers\\", were eventually called \\"Contributors\\" (after briefly being dubbed \\"Sources\\"). The \\"Citizen Journalist\\" motif was dropped. Criticism Associated Content was criticized for the quality of its content. Slate technical writer Farhad Manjoo summed up this criticism thus: \\"Associated Content stands as a cautionary tale for anyone looking to do news by the numbers. It is a wasteland of bad writing, uninformed commentary, and the sort of comically dull recitation of the news you'd get from a second grader.\\" Scott Rosenberg criticized Associated Content and other companies for publishing content not aimed at human readers, but for the purpose of influencing search engines, and for actually degrading Google search results.

It starts at Weston-super-Mare in the London-bound direction. Inaugurated in 1935 by the Great Western Railway company, the Bristolian name was retained by British Railways and is still used by its successor, Great Western Railway. Story of the train The Bristolian was inaugurated in 1935 by the Great Western Railway (GWR) to celebrate the opening of the Great Western main line from Paddington to Bristol in 1835, and is notable in that the route taken differed in the up and down directions. The down train (from Paddington) took Brunel's original route via Bath, but the up train (from Bristol) climbed the 1 in 75 of Filton Bank through what is now Bristol Parkway and then continued climbing the 1 in 300 of the Badminton Line to Badminton before rejoining the down route at Wootton Bassett. This meant that the up train had a slightly shorter route of 117.6 miles (compared to 118.3 miles in the down direction via Bath), but with the stiff climb was probably the harder. Up Bristolian passing Steventon in 1958 The train was scheduled to leave Paddington at 11.00am, and take 105 minutes for the non-stop run to Bristol Temple Meads, with the return leaving Bristol at 4.30pm with the same non-stop time. It was initially made up of 7 Collett coaches and hauled by a King class locomotive, at the time the top GWR passenger class. Later the Castle class steam locomotives and, from 1959, Warship class diesel-hydraulic locomotives were used. The service was suspended during World War 2, and it was not until 1954 that the 105-minute schedule was again achieved. During this time The Bristolian became one of the few named trains to be scheduled for haulage by a gas turbine locomotive when, between April and May 1952 it was scheduled for haulage by 18100, the Metropolitan-Vickers experimental locomotive; but otherwise the mid 1950s was a time of very fast running under steam haulage, the intention being to reduce the regular schedule below 100 minutes. The fastest recorded was hauled by 7018 Drysllwyn Castle in April 1958, taking 93 minutes 50 seconds with a top speed of 102 mph. The change to diesel traction saw Warship class D805 Benbow haul an 8-coach Bristolian on the opening day of the 1959 summer timetable in 93 minutes 48 seconds, and over that summer several similar times were recorded until civil engineering concerns placed a 90 mph limit on the line, and the 100 mph running required for such times was no longer possible. By 1966, Western diesels had taken over from the Warships, and although not officially advertised as The Bristolian the train, now sometimes having 12 coaches, was still achieving the 105 minute schedule even with a stop at Bath included (the up route having been changed in 1961). In 1971 the route was again altered: both the up and down trains were routed via Badminton and called at the newly opened Bristol Parkway, and the load was limited to 10 coaches giving an overall schedule of 110 minutes. The final version of the loco-hauled Bristolian came about in 1973 with the introduction of air- conditioned Mark 2 coaches, and the replacement of the Westerns by Class 47 diesels.  Headboard  Three different headboard designs were used. Under the GWR there was no headboard, although the three-digit GWR train reporting number was carried: 016, 116 (down trains from London), 470, 473 (up trains from Bristol). When the first post-war BR Bristolian was reintroduced in 1951 there was still no headboard. The first headboard was introduced in 1953. This used a standard BR Type 3 plate design in black, with polished aluminium letters. As this was the Coronation year, this plate was adorned with a coronation crest. On 11 June 1956 the headboard design was changed to the new Western Region style of painted brown letters on a cream board, surmounted by the crests of London and Bristol. A headboard was rarely carried in the final years after 1962, until the final run on 12 June 1965. Heritage runs On 12 December 2009, a commemorative train (also called The Bristolian) was hauled from Bristol to London by King-class Locomotive King Edward I. On 17 April 2010, another commemorative train, to mark the GWR 175th anniversary, and also called The Bristolian, was hauled non-stop from London to Bristol, and later the same day back from Bristol to London, by Castle class locomotive no. 5043 Earl of Mount Edgcumbe. These trains were the first non-stop steam trains between these cities for about 50 years. On the return journey, arrival at Paddington was about 45 minutes early, just under 1 hour and 50 minutes after leaving Bristol Temple Meads. The journey time was only a few minutes longer than the schedule for the non-stop Bristolian in the late 1950s, and was achieved notwithstanding the current speed limit for steam of 75 mph, which did not apply in the 1950s.

Dutchbat had been assigned to defend the Bosniak enclave made the U.N. \\"safe area\\", but it failed to prevent the Serbs from taking the city. Military career Karremans followed his military training at the Royal Military Academy in the Netherlands, and subsequently he was part of the 1979-1980 UNIFIL peacekeepers in Lebanon. In the eighties he was stationed at the NATO Headquarters SHAPE in Mons (Belgium), where he was involved in the subject of arms control. In 1991, Karremans had his first experience in Bosnia as liaison officer to the EC observation committee. He then became commander of an infantry battalion in Assen. Presence in the staging area of the Srebrenica massacre In 1994 Karremans was appointed as commander of Dutchbat III battalion that was deployed to the Srebrenica enclave as a part of the peacekeeping mission, under command of the United Nations in operation United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). On 11, 12 and 13 July 1995, the enclave was captured by Serb soldiers, while the Dutch battalion was stationed there. Karremans requested NATO air support to defend the enclave, as the Dutch were more and more driven into the narrow enclave. (Karremans requested air strikes several times, in particular of the French ‚Äì which was witnessed from neutral Switzerland, but they were first denied, then delayed, and later granted by UN General Bernard Janvier.) However the NATO air support arrived was too little and too late to stop the Serbian advance. After Serbian forces entered Srebrenica, Karremans was interrogated by Serb General Ratko Mladiƒá (video of the interrogation is available on YouTube). During the interrogation, Karremans was confined against a wall and surrounded by Serb soldiers, defensive and submissive, but forced to drink alcohol (a white wine spritzer) by General Ratko Mladiƒá and in particular later had to excuse himself from ever requesting air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces, claiming the decision was made by higher authorities based on information he provided. But again witnessed from a neighboring country by there was no choice. Under pretext of evacuating the Bosniak population to a sheltered city, Serbs transferred most of the women and children by bus to a zone under Bosnian-Serb control, claiming that the men would be transferred later. Karremans himself has said a Serb blockade had left his soldiers desperately short of food and fuel. He told the Hague ICTY tribunal in 1996 that when his requests for NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb troops were finally granted, they were \\"too late and too little.\\"http://www.icty.org/x/cases/mladic/trans/en/960704it.htm Transcript from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

He was the son of Gerald FitzGerald, 9th Earl of Kildare and his second wife Elizabeth, Countess of Kildare. Biography Young Lord Kildare became the sole male representative of the Kildare Geraldines at the age of twelve, after his half- brother, Silken Thomas, the tenth earl, was executed at Tyburn in February 1537 with five of his uncles.Surviving the Tudors ‚Äì The 'Wizard' Earl of Kildare and English Rule in Ireland, 1537‚Äì1586 Author: Carey, Vincent. Four Courts Press, 2002. He spent the next few years on the run in Ireland and spent some time in T√≠r Chonaill (now mainly County Donegal) in Ulster, under the guardianship of his aunt, Lady Eleanor McCarthy, the wife of Manus O'Donnell, An √ì Domhnaill. The short-lived Geraldine League, a federation including the O'Neills, the O'Donnells, the O'Briens of Thomond, and other powerful Irish clans related to the Geraldines through marriages, formed around FitzGerald's claim to the Earldom of Kildare. The League came to nothing, however, after the principal members were badly defeated in modern- day County Monaghan following a raid into The Pale in August 1539.Lennon, Colm Sixteenth-century Ireland- the Incomplete Conquest Gill and Macmillan 1994 p.151 FitzGerald escaped Ireland with a few loyal servants and was protected from King Henry VIII and his agents by both Francis I of France and Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire. He was educated at a monastery in Li√®ge, and later spent time with Ercole Cardinal Gonzaga, Lord Bishop of Mantua, a scion of the House of Gonzaga and the effective 'Regent' of the Duchy of Mantua. Due to his time in the Cardinal's court, FitzGerald was fluent in Italian and experienced the court culture of Renaissance Italy. From there, he then moved on to Rome, and for three years studied under the guidance of his kinsman, Reginald Cardinal Pole, later Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.Who's Who in British History. . p 320. During his exile from Ireland, FitzGerald fought with the Knights of Rhodes against the Turks and travelled as far as Tripoli in Libya, then held by the Knights of St. John. Following the death of Henry VIII in 1547, he travelled to England and was received at the court of Edward VI. The young king restored the Kildare lands to him at this time.Lennon p.173 During the reign of Mary I, FitzGerald assisted in suppressing the rebellion of Sir Thomas Wyatt in 1554. He was then restored as Earl of Kildare and Baron of Offaly. He returned to Ireland soon after. Lord Kildare had a keen interest in alchemy, which caused much speculation among those living around Kilkea Castle. He was rumoured to possess magic powers, and thus earned the nickname \\"the Wizard Earl\\".Carey Surviving the Tudors He was a highly intelligent and cultivated man, \\"a product of the Renaissance\\", but he seems to have lacked the political skills of his grandfather, The 8th Earl of Kildare, who virtually ruled Ireland for 35 years,Lennon p.192 and in the turbulent political atmosphere of the 1560s and 70s he was increasingly vulnerable to attack, especially since he openly professed the Roman Catholic faith. He was also unfortunate in being the father-in-law of Lord Delvin, who was suspected of treason throughout his career. His restoration as Earl of Kildare aroused the hostility of many, both Old English and New English, and successive Lord Deputies, and throughout his career he was frequently accused of treason, and was imprisoned in Dublin Castle and later in the Tower of London. He owed his survival mainly to the personal regard of Queen Elizabeth, who twice dismissed the charges of treason against him. He conformed to the Protestant religion in the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth.Webb, Alfred. A compendium of Irish Biography, Dublin, M.H.Gill & Son, 1878 In his last years although technically a free man he was forbidden to leave London, save that he was permitted to take his seat in the Parliament of Ireland which met in Dublin during April‚ÄìMay 1585. Lord Kildare died in London, still in a condition of semi-captivity, on 16 November 1585. According to legend, his ghost returns to Kilkea Castle every seventh year, mounted on a silver-shod white charger. Marriage While at the court of Edward VI, FitzGerald met Mabel Browne, daughter of Sir Anthony Browne, Master of the Horse and his first wife Alice Gage; after Alice's death Anthony became the first husband of FitzGerald's sister, Elizabeth FitzGerald. Kildare and Mabel Browne married during the reign of Mary I on 28 May 1554, in the Chapel Royal. Amongst a certain branch of the FitzGerald's there was a belief/legend that the 11th Earl of Kildare had been married to an Ellinor O'Kelly by Thomas Leverous (later Bishop of Kildare) in 1545. This resulted in the birth of the progenitor of this branch of the FitzGerald's. However, the date purported for the marriage seems unlikely given the timescale and that there would not be some written sources to confirm this event (the marriage to the head of the house of Kildare would always attract notice).Dix's Fitzgeralds of Queen's County.

He appointed Assistant Legal Commissioner in the Irish Land Commission in 1897 and continued in that post until his death. He was also Secretary of the Council of the Royal Irish Academy. At the time of his death, Falkiner was preparing an edition of the letters of Jonathan Swift, a task which was taken up and completed (6 vols, 1910 ‚Äì 1914) by F Elrington Ball. It appears that the edition of Thomas Moore's poetry which he was reportedly preparing for the Clarendon Press was never completed. (Godley (1910) seems not to be a continuation of this work.) He was killed in an accident on 5 August 1908 while on a mountain-climbing holiday in the Alps. In 1910 a memorial to him was erected in the south aisle of the nave of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin, beside the bust commemorating W.E.H. Lecky. The memorial consists of a bronze bas relief portrait of Falkiner, on a marble ground, with an inscription. At the unveiling of this monument, his contemporary and friend Colonel Edward Macartney-Filgate spoke as follows: Family Falkiner had married on 4 August 1892 Henrietta Mary Deane, daughter of Sir Thomas Newenham Deane, with whom he had two daughters.

Based in Washington, D.C., the firm is \\"dedicated to the defense of individual liberties against the increasingly aggressive and unchecked authority of federal and state governments\\". The Center is officially nonpartisan. Its work focuses on enforcement of constitutional limits on state and federal power, primarily through litigation. CIR's primary focus for most of its existence has been challenges to what it regards as unconstitutional or unlawful preferences based on race, sex, or another protected status. It has represented members of many races but is best known for challenging programs favoring minorities over non-minorities, often called \\"affirmative action\\". Another major focus for CIR is free speech. It has represented individuals and groups, often in university environments, challenging attempts to interfere with speech deemed \\"politically incorrect\\". A third focus has been federalism, the attempt to prevent Congress from legislating beyond the powers provided to it in the Constitution. Institutional mission CIR was incorporated in November 1988 and began operations in April 1989. Its name was chosen to underscore that its objective would be to defend individual liberties, broadly understood to encompass both civil and economic rights. Its founders, Michael McDonald and Michael Greve had previously worked together at the conservative Washington Legal Foundation. McDonald, an attorney, specialized in First Amendment litigation. wrote on environmental issues and assisted with WLF's fundraising. CIR involves itself almost exclusively in litigation. It does not lobby Congress nor involve itself it the regulatory process. It does not have a large membership base to influence legislation or engage in fundraising. It has, however, aligned itself with several referendum movements to end State use of racial preferences. From the outset, CIR specialized in a small number of areas of litigation: free speech and civil rights being the two most important. Unlike traditional liberal groups, CIR found its niche primarily in challenging racial preferences in favor of minorities also called affirmative action, government regulation, unconstitutional state action, and other similar entanglements. Like its more avowedly liberal counterparts, CIR provides free legal representation to clients who cannot otherwise afford or obtain legal counsel and whose individual rights are threatened. It is funded primarily from individuals and foundations who favor its goals. Important cases CIR's primary focus has been on Civil Rights cases and First Amendment cases involving Freedom of Religion and Free Speech. It has also been involved in several cases involving federalism. For a relatively small organization in existence for only two decades, it has had quite a number of landmark cases, including a number that have reached the US Supreme Court. =Civil rights= CIR's most famous cases were Gratz v. Bollinger and Grutter v. Bollinger, challenges to the University of Michigan's policies giving preference to minority applicants to its undergraduate college (Gratz) and its law school (Grutter). CIR began litigation in 1997. The final Supreme Court opinions were delivered in 2003. Having failed to get the Court to ban use of race in admissions, CIR provided legal support for the Michigan Civil Rights Initiative and has brought subsequent challenges to the University's continuing use of racial preferences in admissions. The two Michigan cases capped a series of cases around the country, challenging discriminator admissions systems at various universities. Two other key cases were Hopwood v. Texas where the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit banned racial preferences at the University of Texas. Another case, Smith v. Univ. of Washington in the 9th Circuit upheld use of racial preferences in admissions. CIR has also challenged numerous University programs which excluded non- minorities. For example, in Doe v. Department of Health and Human Services CIR ended the practice of excluding all non-minorities summer study program at Texas A&M; University, a program funded in part by the National Institutes of Health. Similarly in Smith v. Virginia Commonwealth University CIR represented a high school student banned from attending a summer journalism workshop when it was determined he was white. In Tompkins v. Alabama State University CIR represented a black student challenging an all-white scholarship at a traditionally black university. In another case that reached the Supreme Court, CIR participated in the voting rights case of Reno v. Bossier Parish in which the Department of Justice refused to provide pre-clearance for a state redistricting plan which expanded minority districts because the DOJ felt even more minority districts could be created. The Court held that DOJ could not deny pre-clearance to redistricting plans that did not show a discriminatory intent and which did not reduce the number of minority districts. =First Amendment= In Rosenberger v. University of Virginia, CIR represented a student newspaper denied University funding because of the religious content of the paper. Wide Awake was a student run newspaper with a Christian perspective. Despite University funding for a wide range of student groups, including Jewish and Muslim groups, the University categorically denied funding for Wide Awake, arguing it would violate the Establishment Clause. The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that by funding a wide range of groups, the University could not discriminate by excluding religious organizations from funding eligibility. Building on Rosenberger CIR brought a second case on behalf of Columbia Union College. The school challenged a Maryland Program which provided private colleges and universities with funds based on the number of students they taught. Numerous Catholic colleges received funding but CUC (run by Seventh Day Adventists) was deemed \\"pervasively sectarian\\" or too religious. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found that CUC was entitled to equal access to funding. CIR has also brought a number of cases in lower courts challenging use of racial or sexual harassment codes to silence University Professors, students, and others who have challenged politically correct ideas or used other language considered controversial. It has brought cases against the University of Oklahoma, the University of New Hampshire and California Polytechnic State University. Most of these cases are settled quickly in CIR's favor and have not gone to trial. Another area of focus has been defending citizens protesting various political matters who have been sued by entities arguing that their protests or criticism were civil right violations. For example, in White v. Lee, CIR defended a neighborhood group who opposed the conversion of hotel into a homeless shelter. Their peaceful protests involved leafleting to let neighbors know of the plan and speaking out at public meetings. After a complaint was filed by the developer of the project the Department of Housing and Urban Development began an investigation threatening fines of up to $50,000 each for obstructing housing for the disabled (since recovering alcoholics and drug addicts who would live in the shelter were defined as disabled). The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the principle that civil rights laws could not be used to stifle legitimate political debate of these matters. CIR has brought similar cases on behalf of protesters against the City of Fresno and the District of Columbia. =Federalism= CIR also brought an important federalism case in United States v. Morrison. In that case, a female student at Virginia Tech accused several football players of rape but a grand jury found insufficient evidence to prosecute. The student brought a challenge in federal court under the newly enacted Violence Against Women Act, a recent law giving women the right to bring such actions. CIR represented one of the football players arguing that the alleged non-economic activity had little relation to interstate commerce, arguing that Congress lacked authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate non-economic activity. The Court agreed and found that portion of VAWA to be beyond Congressional authority. Staff Both of CIR's founders, McDonald and Greve, have moved on to other projects. CIR's current president is Terence J. Pell. Pell is a former Deputy Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education. He later served as General Counsel and Chief of Staff at the Office of National Drug Control Policy. He joined CIR in 1997. CIR's litigation docket is run by the General Counsel, Michael Rosman, a graduate of Yale Law School and former attorney with the New York Law firm of Rosenman & Colin. He joined CIR in 1994.

It was a medieval stronghold of the Fitzgeralds, earls of Kildare.  History  Sir Walter de Riddlesford built a motte and bailey on the site of Kilkea Castle in 1180. A granddaughter of his married Maurice Fitzgerald, 3rd baron of Offaly, and so the Manor of Kilkea came into the possession of the Fitzgeralds and was to remain in the family for over 700 years. Sir Thomas de Rokeby, the Justiciar of Ireland, used the castle as his military base, and died here in 1356. In 1414 the O'Mores and O'Dempsies wasted the English pale. According to Francis Grose's Antiquities of Ireland, \\"to curb their outrages, Thomas Crawley, Archbishop of Dublin and Lord Justice, set out from Dublin, but proceeded no farther than Castledermot; the troops went forward under military leaders, he remaining engaged in processions and prayers for their success\\". According to Grose, the \\"enemy were defeated with great slaughter at Kilkea\\". Later, in 1426, John FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Kildare reputedly \\"strengthened Kilkea with so many new works, that he might be said almost to have new built it. Representation of the castle from Antiquities of Ireland (published 1791) The castle is particularly associated with Gerald, the 11th Earl of Kildare known as the \\"Wizard Earl\\", who became the eldest male representative of the Geraldines when only 12 years of age after his half brother \\"Silken Thomas\\" the 10th Earl and five uncles were executed at Tyburn in 1537. The \\"Wizard Earl\\" escaped Ireland being sent to the continent to be educated, and following his return to Kildare and restoration to his titles his interest in alchemy caused much interest among his neighbours around Kilkea Castle and he was said to possess magic powers. The 11th Earl (the \\"Wizard Earl\\") died in 1585 and is supposed to return to the castle every seventh year mounted on a silver-shod white charger. In 1634 the castle was leased to the Jesuit Order by the widow of the 14th Earl of Kildare and they remained there until 1646. That year the order entertained the Archbishop Rinuccini, Papal Nuncio to the Confederation of Kilkenny at Kilkea. In the early 18th century, the 19th Earl of Kildare decided to make Carton House the family seat and Kilkea Castle was leased to a succession of tenants. One of these tenants was Thomas Reynolds, a Dublin silk merchant, who was a \\"friend\\" of Lord Edward FitzGerald, through whom Reynolds had become a United Irishman, only to become an informer. His role as informer did not prevent the castle (which had been renovated shortly before) being sacked by military during the rebellion. After Carton House was sold in 1949, Kilkea Castle became the seat of the 8th Duke of Leinster.  Developments  The castle and estate was sold by the Fitzgerald family in the early 1960s. Kilkea Castle was then run as a hotel for decades, but entered Examinership in 2009, as a result of the Irish financial crisis. It was closed and put up for sale in 2010. It was bought by an American business-man, Jay Cashman and has since reopened as a resort. Shackleton connection The polar explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton (1874-1922) was born near Kilkea to a Quaker family that had been millers in the south Kildare area for over a century.

Each directory contained thousands of loose-leaf pages and listings ‚Äî 11,000 titles as of 1968.The Library Association. Library Science Abstracts (1968) These large directories with their familiar yellow-gold pages were often located in record stores and libraries; they were used by store customers, library patrons, radio music directors, radio DJs, and anyone else who needed a comprehensive resource of recorded music. A nearly complete volume (since 1949) are on file with the Library of Congress for historical songwriter, album, and title research. PhonoLog filled a valuable reference niche by cross-referencing. For example: a record store clerk was able to help a customer looking for a particular song by searching the \\"Title\\" section for the song name, where the album title and artist were listed. Similarly, a customer looking for an album who could not remember the singer could easily be assisted. If the album was stocked in the store, it could easily be retrieved and sold. If not, the label information provided the store enough information to order either through their corporate system, through their preferred one-stop supplier, or even directly from the label. The latter was especially valuable for smaller indie labels with fanatic, nationwide fan bases in the 1980s and beyond, such as Dischord, SubPop, Lookout, Twin/Tone, and others that would not otherwise have had the means to market to such a diverse number of stores. Other uses: musicologists, copyright licensing agents, and other business entities used the album and artist sections for song credit information and contact information for track licensing for film projects. Lawyers and business managers researched whether other recording artists were using the same name to avoid confusion and \\"cease and desist\\" orders, and to track copyright usage. Artists used the song title and album sections to monitor their copyright usage as well. Labels used the free listing service to reach a broader market, and to network with regional one-stops outside their area. New releases traditionally arrived to stores on Tuesdays. Assisting stores to generate sales, by 1996 PhonoLog updates were accompanied by a \\"StreetDates\\" one-sheet publication highlighting the next 2 weeks of anticipated and under- the-radar releases, with short reviews and space for the store to stamp their logo/info. Early \\"PhonoLog\\" editions included singles. By the 1980s, the catalog listings were full-length releases only due to the increasing volume of product available, particularly with the proliferation of independent (\\"indie\\") record labels that coincided with 4 factors: 1) Do-It-Yourself (DIY) ethos of home-based recording, 2) increasing availability of Cassette and later CD reproduction technology, 3) an industry-wide shift from album development to a singles-driven market leading to increasing frequency and volume of releases, and 4) increasing availability of digital media and file sharing capabilities. PhonoLog was first published in 1948 in Los Angeles, and was maintained through periodic updates called the Phonolog Reporter. (Note original lowercase \\"L.\\") Phonolog Publishing Co. of Los Angeles was its publisher in the 1970s. Trade Services Publications of San Diego produced and distributed updates to the catalog until 1997, when the company division merged with NYC-based Muze, Inc. to develop interactive CD-ROM based kiosk products for record stores. (The companies had competing products for a brief period of time, until databases were merged.) Muze now offers a similar music database called MuzeMusic. PhonoLog Reporter has largely been overtaken by CDs and the Internet. There is also a CD distributed by Billboard magazine with hundreds of thousands of entries.

DYO, Sadolin ve Ya≈üarin, and DYO ve Sadolin  DYO Boya Fabrikalarƒ± Inc. is an ƒ∞zmir, Turkey-based company founded in 1954, originally named Durmu≈ü Ya≈üar ve Oƒüullarƒ± Boya, Vernik ve Re√ßine Fabrikalarƒ± A.≈û., and based on licensing from Sadolin & Holmblad of Denmark. DYO stands for Durmu≈ü Ya≈üar ve Oƒüullarƒ± (Durmu≈ü Ya≈üar & Sons). In 1957, Sadolin ve Ya≈üarin A.≈û. (Sadolin & Ya≈üarin) was founded to produce resins for paint production ‚Äì based on licensing from Sadolin & Holmblad. This company became in 1962 DYO ve Sadolin Sentetik Sel√ºlozik Boya ve Vernik Fabrikalarƒ± A.≈û. (DYO & Sadolin) ‚Äì in short DYOSAD, and at that time DYOSAD began producing industrial paints for metal, plastic and wood as well as automotive refinishes based on licensing from Sadolin & Holmblad. In 1967, DYOSAD made a Harris Brush factory, and in 1968, DYOSAD began producing and marketing inks ‚Äì on licensing from Sadolin & Holmblad. The cooperation between the Ya≈üar family and Sadolin & Holmblad dates back to before the Second World War, when Durmu≈ü Ya≈üar in 1938 began to import paint from Sadolin & Holmblad, who had itself had exported paint to Turkey since 1919. From the beginning DYO and later Sadolin ve Yasarin and DYOSAD the joint ventures were run by Sel√ßuk Ya≈üar (oldest son of Durmu≈ü Ya≈üar) ‚Äì in close cooperation with Dan Alexander MacGregor Sadolin, (the only son of Gunnar Asgeir Sadolin, the founder of Sadolin & Holmblad), who was joint president and international CEO of Sadolin & Holmblad. In 1979, 25 years after the first factory establishment, DYO and DYOSAD in Turkey had become bigger than the domestic paint and ink activities in Denmark of Sadolin & Holmblad ‚Äì in terms of both net revenue, net profit and number of employees. However, DYO and DYOSAD never counted for more than 10% of the net revenue, net profit or number of employees of the entire Sadolin & Holmblad group, which were active with more than 60 factories sites in over 40 countries, and had sales in more than 100 countries.  Ownership and structural changes  Originally DYO was owned 75% personally by Durmus Ya≈üar (and from 1967 Ya≈üar Holding) and 25% personally by Dan Alexander MacGregor Sadolin of Sadolin & Holmblad. Originally Sadolin ve Ya≈üarin ‚Äì later DYOSAD ‚Äì was owned 75% by DYO ‚Äì from 1967 Ya≈üar Holding ‚Äì and 25% by Sadolin & Holmblad. In 1982, Sadolin & Holmblad increased its shareholding several times first to 37.5% and then to 43.5% ‚Äì while the remaining shares were owned by Ya≈üar Holding. In 1987, Sadolin & Holmblad was taken over by Nobel Industries of Sweden ‚Äì and became a part of its global paint and adhesives business are Casco Nobel. In 1994 Nobel Industries was taken over by Akzo of the Netherlands ‚Äì forming AkzoNobel, and in 1995 AkzoNobel sold its entire shareholding in DYO ve Sadolin to Ya≈üar Holding, and in 2000, DYOSAD merged into DYO ‚Äì together with Bayrakli Boya and Dewilux Boya, and for the first time all the paint activities of Ya≈üar Holding was gathered in one company, DYO ‚Äì with exception of Ya≈üar-BASF Otomotive Boya and DYO Inks.  Organization  The board of directors of DYO has over the years consisted of among others Durmu≈ü Ya≈üar, his two sons Sel√ßuk Ya≈üar and Selman Ya≈üar, and his grandson Selim Ya≈üar, as well as Ali Nail Kubali ‚Äì representing Ya≈üar Holding as well as Dan Alexander MacGregor Sadolin (1954‚Äì1974) and then J√∂rgen M√∂lvang (1974‚Äì1995) ‚Äì representing Sadolin & Holmblad of Denmark. The board of directors of DYOSAD has over the years consisted of among others Durmu≈ü Ya≈üar, his two sons Sel√ßuk Ya≈üar and Selman Ya≈üar, and his grandson Selim Ya≈üar], as well as Ali Nail Kubali ‚Äì representing Ya≈üar Holding as well as Dan Alexander MacGregor Sadolin (1958‚Äì1974), Ferd Aage Small (1958‚Äì1960), Bent L√∂bger (1960‚Äì1966), J√∂rgen M√∂lvang (1966‚Äì1995), Erik Lars Christian Smith-Petersen (1974‚Äì1986), Mogens Hugo (1986‚Äì1991), and Ove Mattson from president and CEO of Casco Nobel, then Nobel Industries, and member of the executive board of AkzoNobel (1991‚Äì1995) ‚Äì all representing Sadolin & Holmblad of Denmark. At DYO and DYOSAD the first managing director was Sel√ßuk Ya≈üar (1954‚Äì1968), while the first professional managing director was Vacit T√ºmer (1968‚Äì1975), and the first technical director was Selman Ya≈üar (1954‚Äì1968), while the first professional technical director was Erik Lars Christian Smith-Petersen (1968‚Äì1970).  Other Ya≈üar-Sadolin family relations  Peter Asgeir MacGregor Sadolin, the only son of Dan Alexander MacGregor Sadolin and Bodil Mayland Sadolin, was first personal assistant to Sel√ßuk Ya≈üar (1965‚Äì66) and thereafter project manager for the Harris Brush project and the DYOSAD Ink project (1966‚Äì1967) at DYOSAD (before becoming deputy general manager for T√ºrk Tuborg Bira ve Malt, a Ya≈üar Holding joint venture with Carlsberg, in 1967‚Äì1968). Hanne Sadolin, wife of Peter Asgeir MacGregor Sadolin, was an industrial laboratory specialist at the Automotive Laboratories at DYOSAD (1965‚Äì1966), joining from a similar position at Sadolin & Holmblad. Selim Ya≈üar, the only son of Sel√ßuk Ya≈üar, was the personal assistant to J√∂rgen M√∂lvang, then president and CEO of Sadolin & Holmblad (1980‚Äì1981). Nikolaj Asgeir MacGregor Sadolin ‚Äì called Nick MacGregor Sadolin, the only son of Peter Asgeir MacGregor Sadolin and Hanne Sadolin, has later been export area manager at DYOSAD (1992), and he worked for both Ya≈üar Holding and Ya≈üar University in 2008‚Äì2012. Funda Demirayak Sadolin, the later wife of Nick MacGregor Sadolin, was employed by DYOSAD (1988 to 1993) ‚Äì latest as an executive secretary to the board of management. Mehmet Demirayak, the father of Funda Demirayak Sadolin, was employed at DYOSAD as a factory worker (1970‚Äì1998). Sel√ßuk Alexander MacGregor Sadolin ‚Äì called Sam MacGregor Sadolin, the only child of Nick MacGregor Sadolin and Funda Demirayak Sadolin, was born in Izmir, Turkey, and he is named in honor of Sel√ßuk Ya≈üar and Dan Alexander MacGregor Sadolin. The Yasar and Sadolin families together with Yasar Holding, Sadolin & Holmblad and Carlsberg founded the company Danish-Turkish Investment Company Ltd. in 1972 to construct the large Altƒ±nyunus (Golden Dolphin) Hotel at √áe≈üme, a sea- side resort town on the extreme western tip of Turkey, on the Aegean Sea opposite the Greek island of Chios and west of Izmir, in 1972. The hotel went into operations in 1974, and had the capacity of 1100 beds and the largest conference facilities then. Anne-Suzette Sadolin, the only daughter of Dan Alexander MacGregor Sadolin and Bodil Mayland Sadolin and a Danish artist was among the artists who decorated the hotel. For many years several of her weavings could be seen in the lobby. In 1986, Danish-Turkish Investment Company Ltd. was wound up and the Danish owned shares in Altƒ±nyunus were sold to Yasar Holding. Since Sadolin & Holmblad during these years was a multinational group with more manufacturing operations on more than 60 sites in over 40 countries (until the group were integrated into AkzoNobel), the Sadolin family's direct involvement in DYO and DYOSAD was rather unusual.  Ya≈üar-BASF Otomotive Boya  In 1992, DYOSAD sold its automotive refreshing to Ya≈üar Holding, which made a joint venture with the German chemical group BASF regarding automotive refinishes, and Ya≈üar-BASF Otomotive Boya was founded becoming a 100% owner. The company became there by an associated company to Ya≈üar Holding. In 2008, BASF acquired Ya≈üar Holding's 50% shareholding in 2008, making Ya≈üar-BASF Otomotive Boya, which at the same time change its name to BASF Car Refinishes Coatings, a 100% subsidiary of BASF.  DYO Inks  In 1992, DYOSAD separated its inks operations into DYO Sadolin Inks Manufacturing & Trade ‚Äì in short DYO SADOLIN Inks. DYO SADOLIN Inks was owned 50.5% by Sadolin & Holmblad's predecessor Nobel Industries and 49.5% by DYOSAD. At the same of the merger of DYO and DYOSAD in 2000, Ya≈üar Holding acquired both DYOSAD's 49.5% and AkzoNobel's 50.5% shareholding in DYO SADOLIN Inks, and the company changed its name to DYO Inks Manufacturing & Trade ‚Äì making it a 100% owned subsidiary Ya≈üar Holding and thereby a sister company to the new DYO (the paint business).  Today  DYO is part of Ya≈üar Holding. DYO is one of the leading paint producers in Turkey, along with Filli Boya, Marshall Boya, and Polisan Boya. DYO is also the first company founded as part of Ya≈üar Holding, which since have been one of the flagship of. Ya≈üar Holding is a conglomerate that owns many companies in a wide spectrum of sectors. Along with the other paint companies under Ya≈üar Holding using the DYO brand, the company develops and produces a large number of paint products ranging from household paint to high-end nano-technology paints.

In 1919 the primary school expanded into secondary education as well, changing its name to Colegio Anglo-Peruano. The school then consisted of 7 teachers and 271 pupils. In 1924, while the school was still located at its premises on the Plaza Francia, it merged with the American Institute and became a boysonly institution. Through the initiative of Dr. W. Stanley Rycroft and with the collaboration of Dr. Alberto Arca Parr√≥, a distinguished teacher at the school, the Leader magazine was founded in 1926. In the words of its first editorial, the Leader aspired to \\"be the voice of educational development, and be able to unite the voice of teachers and students in the process of development and reinterpretation of the basic principles of teaching.\\" The school moved to its present site in 1930. The thenPresident of Peru, Augusto B. Legu√≠a, was an honoured guest at the occasion. In 1942, in compliance with the dictates of Government Resolution N¬∞3, announced by the Ministry of Education, the school changed its name again, becoming the Colegio San Andr√©s. The school was opened to female students in 1994. The class of 2004 was the first coeducational class to graduate. Philosophy Since the school was founded under charter from the Free Church of Scotland, the defining ideals of the school are principally derived from the church's philosophy and biblical teachings. The institution, being a religious institution, teaches all its subjects from a Biblical viewpoint, not only for religion and ethics, but also for all aspects of education.

While only known from 17th and 18th accounts by visitors to the island, it was scientifically named in 1848, based on the 1674 account by Sieur Dubois. A considerable literature was subsequently devoted to its possible affinities, with current researchers agreeing it was derived from the swamphen genus Porphyrio. It has been considered mysterious and enigmatic due to the lack of any physical evidence of its existence. This bird was described as entirely blue in plumage with a red beak and legs. It was said to be the size of a R√©union ibis or chicken, which could mean in length, and it may have been similar to the takahe. While easily hunted, it was a fast runner and able to fly, though it did so reluctantly. It may have fed on plant matter and invertebrates, as do other swamphens, and was said to nest among grasses and aquatic ferns. It was only found on the Plaine des Cafres plateau, to which it may have retreated during the latter part of its existence, whereas other swamphens inhabit lowland swamps. While the last unequivocal account is from 1730, it may have survived until 1763, but overhunting and the introduction of cats probably drove it to extinction. Taxonomy Visitors to the Mascarene island of R√©union during the 17th and 18th centuries reported blue birds (' in French). The first such account is that of the French traveller Sieur Dubois, who was on R√©union from 1669 to 1672, which was published in 1674. The British naturalist Hugh Edwin Strickland stated in 1848 that he would have thought Dubois' account referred to a member of the swamphen genus Porphyrio if not for its large size and other features (and noted the term ' had also been erroneously used for bats on R√©union in an old account). Strickland expressed hope that remains of this and other extinct Mascarene birds would be found there. Responding to Strickland's book later that year, the Belgian scientist Edmond de S√©lys Longchamps coined the scientific name Apterornis coerulescens based on Dubois' account. The specific name is Latin for \\"bluish, becoming blue\\". Selys Longchamps also included two other Mascarene birds, at the time only known from contemporary accounts, in the genus Apterornis: the R√©union ibis (now Threskiornis solitarius); and the red rail (now Aphanapteryx bonasia). He thought them related to the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire, due to their shared rudimentary wings, tail, and the disposition of their digits. The name Apterornis had already been used for a different extinct bird genus from New Zealand (now Aptornis, the adzebills) by the British biologist Richard Owen earlier in 1848, and the French biologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte coined the new binomial Cyanornis erythrorhynchus for the ' in 1857. The same year, the German ornithologist Hermann Schlegel moved the species to the genus Porphyrio, as P. (Notornis) caerulescens, indicating an affinity with the takahe (now called Porphyrio hochstetteri, then also referred to as Notornis by some authors) of New Zealand. Schlegel argued that the discovery of the takahe showed that members of Porphyrio could be large, thereby disproving Strickland's earlier doubts based on size. The British ornithologist Richard Bowdler Sharpe simply used the name Porphyrio caerulescens in 1894. The British zoologist Walter Rothschild retained the name Apterornis for the bird in 1907, and considered it similar to Aptornis and the takahe, believing Dubois' account indicated it was related to those birds. The Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka used the new combination Cyanornis coerulescens for the bird in 1953 (with the specific name misspelled), also considering it related to the takahe due to its size. The original genus name of the R√©union swamphen, Apterornis, was already used for the extinct Aptornis, which Walter Rothschild later believed to have been a relative. Throughout the 20th century the bird was usually considered a member of Porphyrio or Notornis, and the latter genus was eventually itself considered a junior synonym of Porphyrio. Some writers equated the bird with extant swamphens, including African swamphens by the French ornithologist Jacques Berlioz in 1946, and western swamphens by the French ornithologist Nicolas Barr√© in 1996, despite their different habitat. The French ornithologist Philippe Milon doubted the Porphyrio affiliation in 1951, since Dubois' account stated the R√©union bird tasted good, while extant swamphens do not. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway stated that the bird \\"must remain mysterious\\" until Porphyrio bones are one day uncovered. In 1974, an attempt was made to find fossil localities on the Plaine des Cafres plateau, where the bird was said to have lived, but no caves (which might contain kitchen middens where early settlers discarded bones of local birds) were found, and it was determined that a more careful study of the area was needed before excavations could be made. In 1977, the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson found the old accounts consistent with an endemic derivative of Porphyrio, and considered it a probable species whose remains might one day be discovered. The British ecologist Anthony S. Cheke considered previous arguments about the bird's affinities in 1987, and supported it being a Porphyrio relative, while noting that there were two further contemporary accounts. The same year, the British writer Errol Fuller listed the bird as a hypothetical species, and expressed puzzlement as to how a considerable literature had been derived from such \\"flimsy material\\". The French palaeontologist C√©cile Mourer-Chauvir√© and colleagues listed the bird as Cyanornis (?=Porphyrio) caerulescens in 2006, indicating the uncertainty of its classification. They stated the reason no fossils of it had been found was probably because it did not live in the parts of R√©union where fossils might have been preserved. Cheke and the British palaeontologist Julian P. Hume stated in 2008 that since the mystery of the \\"R√©union solitaire\\" had been solved after it was identified with ibis remains, the R√©union swamphen remains the most enigmatic of the Mascarene birds from the old accounts. In his 2012 book about extinct birds and his 2019 monograph about extinct Mascarene rails, Hume stated that the R√©union swamphen had been mentioned by trustworthy observers, but was \\"perhaps the most enigmatic of all rails\\" with no evidence to resolve its taxonomy. He thought there was no doubt that it was a derivative of Porphyrio, as the all blue colouration is only found in that genus among rails. While it may have been derived from Africa or Madagascar, genetic studies have shown that other rails have dispersed unexpectedly far in distance from their closest relatives, making alternate explanations possible. Description The R√©union swamphen was possibly similar to the takahe, and has at times been thought to be closely related. The R√©union swamphen was described as having entirely blue plumage with a red beak and legs, and is generally agreed to have been a large, terrestrial swamphen, with features indicative of reduced flight capability, such as larger size and more robust legs. There has been disagreement over the size of the bird, as Dubois' account compared its size with that of a R√©union ibis while that of the French engineer Jean Feuilley from 1704 compared it to a domestic chicken. Cheke stated in 1987 that Feuilley's account would indicate the bird was not unusually large, perhaps the size of a swamphen. Hume pointed out in 2019 that the R√©union ibis would have been at most, similar to the extant African sacred ibis (including the tail), while chickens could be in length (the size of their ancestor, the wild red junglefowl), and there was therefore no contradiction. The R√©union swamphen would thereby have been about the same size as the takahe. The first description of the R√©union swamphen is that of Dubois from 1674: The last definite account of the bird is that of the priest Father Brown from around 1730 (expanded from a 1717 account by Le Gentil): Olson stated the comparison to a \\"wood pigeon\\" was a reference to the common wood pigeon, implying that Brown described it as smaller than Dubois did, while Hume suggested it could be the extinct R√©union blue pigeon. The 1708 account of H√©bert does not add much information, though he qualified its colouration as \\"dark blue\\". While the bird is only known from written accounts, reconstructions of it appear in Rothschild's 1907 book Extinct Birds, and Hachisuka's 1953 book The Dodo and Kindred Birds. Rothschild stated he had the Dutch artist John Gerrard Keulemans depict it as intermediate between the takahe and Aptornis, which he thought its closest relatives. Fuller found Frohawk's illustration to be a well-produced work, though almost entirely conjectural in depicting it like a slimmed-down takahe. Behaviour and ecology While it was probably derived from swamphens (here, a western swamphen), the R√©union swamphen did not inhabit swamps like them. Little is known about the ecology of the R√©union swamphen; it was easily caught and killed, unlike other swamphens (which avoid predators by flying or hiding), though it was able to run fast. While some early researchers thought the bird to be flightless, Brown's account states it could fly, and it is thought to have been a reluctant flier. Hume suggested it may have fed on plant matter and invertebrates, as other swamphens do. At least in the latter part of its existence, it appears to have been confined to mountains (retreating there between the 1670s and 1705), in particular to the Plaine des Cafres plateau, situated at an altitude of about in south-central R√©union. The environment of this area consists of open woodland in a subalpine forest steppe, and has marshy pools. The R√©union swamphen was termed a land-bird by Dubois, while other swamphens inhabit lowland swamps. This is similar to the R√©union ibis, which lived in forest rather than wetlands, which is otherwise typical ibis habitat. Cheke and Hume proposed that the ancestors of these birds colonised R√©union before swamps had developed, and had therefore become adapted to the available habitats. They were perhaps prevented from colonising Mauritius as well due to the presence of red rails there, which may have occupied a similar ecological niche. Feuilley described some characteristics of the bird in 1704: The only account of its nesting behaviour is that of La Roque from 1708: Many other endemic species on R√©union became extinct after the arrival of humans and the resulting disruption of the island's ecosystem. The R√©union swamphen lived alongside other now-extinct birds, such as the R√©union ibis, the Mascarene parrot, the Hoopoe starling, the R√©union parakeet, the R√©union owl, the R√©union night heron, and the R√©union pink pigeon. Extinct R√©union reptiles include the R√©union giant tortoise and an undescribed Leiolopisma skink. The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on R√©union and Mauritius before vanishing from both islands. Extinction Many terrestrial rails are flightless, and island populations are particularly vulnerable to man-made changes; as a result, rails have suffered more extinctions than any other family of birds. All six endemic species of Mascarene rails are extinct, all caused by human activities. Overhunting was the main cause of the R√©union swamphen's extinction (it was considered good game and was easy to catch), but according to Cheke and Hume, the introduction of cats at the end of the 17th century could have contributed to the elimination of the bird once these became feral and reached its habitat. Today, cats are still a serious threat to native birds, in particular Barau's petrel, since they occur all over R√©union, including the most remote and high peaks. The eggs and chicks would also have been vulnerable to rats after their accidental introduction in 1676. On the other hand, the R√©union swamphen and other birds of the island appear to have successfully survived feral pigs. Cattle grazing on Plaine des Cafres was promoted by the French explorer Jean- Baptiste Charles Bouvet de Lozier in the 1750s, which may have also had an impact on the bird. While the last unequivocal account of the R√©union swamphen is from 1730, an anonymous account from 1763, possibly by the British Brigadier-General Richard Smith, may be the last mention of this bird, though no description of it was provided, and it might refer to another species. It is also impossible to say whether this writer saw the bird himself.

He was best known as a keyboard player and programmer for Left Spine Down and electro-industrial band Front Line Assembly as well as producing tracks for various well known musicians worldwide. He began his work with Left spine Down in 2003 when he replaced original member Frank Valoczy. He was invited into Front Line Assembly in 2005 and made his first contributions to their 2006 album Artificial Soldier. He also made contributions to Front Line Assembly side- projects Noise Unit and Delerium. Inkel died from complications with asthma at the age of 34 on January 11, 2018. Career By 2003, Inkel co-founded Left Spine Down with kAINE D3L4Y and Matt Girvan. Their like-mindedness for punk rock and electronic music brought them together, performing as headliners as well as openers for touring acts in Vancouver. After beginning work on LSD's first album, Fighting for Voltage with Chris Peterson, Inkel was welcomed into Front Line Assembly in 2005. He co-wrote and -produced the full-length album Artificial Soldier (released in 2006). FLA then brought Inkel (as well as LSD alumni Jared Slingerland) on tour to promote the Artificial Soldier album. They quickly followed up with the remix album Fallout, touring worldwide for two years with the group, and co-headlining various festivals such as Mera Luna, Summer Darkness, and Amphi Festival (featuring notable acts such as Nitzer Ebb, Bauhaus, Apoptygma Berzerk, Bloc Party, VNV Nation, The Killers and others). He was also in the lineup for FLA to play in Russia for the first time. It was during these tours with FLA that Inkel was able to introduce the world to his other band, Left Spine Down, via the means of their Smartbomb EP released on the Synthetic Sounds label. 2008 and 2009 saw Inkel and Left Spine Down open for acts such as The Genitorturers, ohGr, The Birthday Massacre, and the Revolting Cocks' North American Lubricatour (with Jim Rose, Blownload and Left Spine Down as guests). It was then when Inkel began working with 16volt's Eric Powell, providing his services on their new album American Porn Songs (\\"To Hell\\") and coordinating LSD's appearance on the North American MIDI GHETTO TOUR, which consisted of thirty-three performances with 16volt and Chemlab in Spring of 2010. In 2009, Inkel returned to Front Line Assembly, co- writing and co-producing the full-length album Improvised Electronic Device, and the single \\"Shifting Through the Lens\\". The albums were released in 2010. As a result of Inkel's experience touring with The Revolting Cocks, he enlisted Al Jourgensen to co-produce, mix, and perform vocals for the track \\"Stupidity\\", alongside Justin Hagberg, guitarist and vocalist for 3 Inches of Blood. Inkel died in North Vancouver on 11 January 2018, aged 34, following complications from asthma.

Famous for his eloquence, Sirvydas spent 10 years of his life preaching sermons at St. Johns' Church in Vilnius (twice a day ‚Äì once in Lithuanian and once in Polish).  Biography  He was born in Lithuania some time between 1578 and 1581, in the village of Sirvydai near Anyk≈°ƒçiai. In 1612, he became a professor of theology at the Academia Vilnensis, the predecessor of Vilnius University. Between 1623 and 1624, he also briefly served as the deputy rector of his alma mater, after which he continued as a professor in theology, liberal arts and philosophy.  Works  At the same time, he began his career as a preacher, writer and scientist. First edition before 1620 - fifth in 1713, he published his tri-lingual Polish‚ÄìLithuanian‚ÄìLatin dictionary Dictionarium trium linguarum in usum studiosae juventutis, one of the first such books in Lithuanian literary history. It has been printed in at least five editions since that time. First and later editions slightly differed. Editions Until the 19th century, it was the only Lithuanian dictionary in print. Sirvydas' lexicon is often mentioned as a milestone in the standardization and codification of the Lithuanian language. The first edition contained approximately 6000 words, the second was expanded to include almost 11,000 words. It also had a lot of newly created Lithuanian words, including for example mokytojas (teacher), taisyklƒó (rule), kokybƒó (quality). A decade later, in 1629, he published the first volume of a collection of his sermons entitled Punktai Sakym≈≥, and he later translated them into the Polish language as Punkty kaza≈Ñ. The Lithuanian version of this work was often used as a primer to teach the Lithuanian language. However, it was not until 1644, that the second volume was finally published. Around 1630, he compiled the first book of grammar of the Lithuanian language (Lietuvi≈≥ kalbos raktas ‚Äì Key to the Lithuanian Language), which however did not survive to our times.

It was filmed principally in Mexico. Plot The four adult sons of Katie Elder ‚Äì John (John Wayne), who is a famous (or infamous) professional gunman; Tom (Dean Martin), a professional gambler; Bud (Michael Anderson, Jr.), the youngest brother, still in school; and Matt (Earl Holliman), an unsuccessful hardware dealer ‚Äì reunite in their hometown of Clearwater, Texas (approximately 2 hours east of Dallas in northeast Texas), in 1898 for their mother's funeral, sharing regret that none of them have lived up to her high expectations of them. The townspeople and new deputy sheriff are unfriendly, to the two eldest John and Tom in particular. Katie Elder, however, was extremely well liked by everyone in the community, who were all aware of her honesty, her poverty and her undying love for the sons who neglected her. The brothers want to do something for Katie's sake, and their plan is to send youngest son Bud to college, raising money through a sale of another man's herd of horses, even though Bud wants to emulate his eldest brother. Morgan Hastings (James Gregory), a gunsmith and rising entrepreneur, claims ownership of the Elders' rich ranch and house / outbuildings for his Hastings Gun Manufactory, saying he won it from their father in a game of cards; Bass Elder afterwards was shot in the back at night, and the killer is still unknown. Hastings hides a hostile attitude towards the brothers and brings in a hired gun, Curley (George Kennedy). Noting Hasting's suspicious attitude, the Elders begin to suspect foul play upon their return. Hastings claims Bass lost the ranch in a game of Blackjack, so John, in a ruse, states their father wouldn't have been caught dead playing Blackjack poker. When Hastings learns about the brothers' investigations, he kills the well-loved sheriff (Paul Fix) and frames the Elder brothers for the murder. Then, while the Elders are being moved to a nearby different county jail for safety, Hastings, not content with seeing them go to prison, arranges an ambush in which Matt is killed and Bud seriously injured. Deputy Sheriff Ben Latta (Jeremy Slate) is not part of the conspiracy, but is shot and killed by Hastings when he decides to aid the Elders after seeing he had been fooled. The surviving Elders succeed in beating back the ambushers. Going back to town to get medical help for Bud, John and Tom barricade themselves in the town smithy. Tom manages to sneak around back alleys to kidnap Hasting's weak-willed son Dave (Dennis Hopper), although he is seriously injured in the process. Hastings shoots his own boy in an attempt to prevent him from testifying. In the presence of John Elder and the local judge, Dave manages to relate the tale of his father's crimes before he dies. Now vindicated, John takes up arms in righteous fury and kills Hastings, who is hiding in his gunsmith shop, by shooting up a cask of gunpowder inside his own gun store, blowing up the building.

Wright picked up a copy of Life of the Marlows by Glenn Shirley in a Los Angeles, bookstore in around 1953. Thinking that it would make the basis of a good Western, he paid members of the Marlow family $1,000 (about $ when adjusted for inflation several decades later) each for the rights to make it into a screenplay. But when the movie was made 12 years later, the film's plot had been drastically changed.Glenn Shirley: The Fighting Marlows, Men Who Wouldn't Be Lynched, Texas Christian University Press, Fort Worth, Texas, 1994. ; Talbot Jennings was credited for the script.Rathmell and DeArment p. 6. =Development= Paramount purchased the story by William Wright and Talbot Jennings in 1955. The story concerned five brothers and revolved around a cattle drive from Texas to Colorado. Sam Briskin was assigned as producer. Frank Burt was to write the script, John Sturges was going to direct and Alan Ladd was to star, making a return to Paramount after several years' absence ‚Äì he still owed Paramount one film left. Noel Langley signed to write a version of the script, and filming was to start in April 1956. However, in July 1956 it was announced that Ladd had bought himself out of his Paramount commitment by paying $135,000, and he would no longer make the film. (Henry Hathaway put this figure at $250,000.) Film rights were picked up by Hal Wallis, who had a deal with Paramount. In 1959 it was announced that Dean Martin would star. Eventually in 1964 John Wayne was signed to star, with Henry Hathaway to direct. =Shooting= Filming was due to begin in September 1964, but had to be delayed until January 1965, after Wayne was diagnosed with lung cancer. Following Wayne's surgery to remove a cancerous lung and two ribs, the star insisted on doing his own stunts, and nearly contracted pneumonia after being dragged into a river. Outdoor locations were filmed in Durango, in northern Mexico, and the opening credits scene as a locomotive travels a narrow stream canyon valley on the famed Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (now a scenic tourist train) Colorado, United States. The train depot scene that follows that (where the brothers wait for no-show John Wayne) was filmed at Perkinsville Arizona, and that same train depot was used as Gold City near the end of How the West was Won. That train depot still stands at the end of the ride for Verde Canyon Railroad, a tourist train originating in Clarkdale, Arizona, before the train reverses and heads back. Former Disney young star Tommy Kirk was signed for the film, presumably in the role of Bud Elder, but his arrest for being at a party where marijuana was used led to his being fired from the production.p.211 Blunts, Holden The Quotable Stoner: More that 1,100 Baked, Lit-Up, and Zonked-Out Quotes in Tribute to (and as a Result of) Smoking Weed Adams Media, June 4, 2011 The name \\"Kate Elder\\" was one of several names used by Mary Katherine Horony Cummings, better known as \\"Big Nose Kate\\", a western icon and sometime companion of dentist / gambler / gunfighter Doc Holliday. As Holliday's Kate Elder lived until 1940, she cannot be the Katie Elder mentioned in this film. John Wayne and Dean Martin had also starred in Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo six years earlier, one of Martin's earliest dramatic roles after splitting with his longtime comedic partner Jerry Lewis. Four years later, Henry Hathaway also directed John Wayne in his first Academy Award-winning role of Indian Territory U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn in the original screen version of True Grit (1969). In addition to Wayne, actors Strother Martin, Dennis Hopper, and Jeremy Slate were all cast in that film as well. Music The score was composed by Elmer Bernstein, who would also score True Grit by the same director and starring John Wayne. Johnny Cash sang a song in 1965 also called \\"The Sons of Katie Elder\\", written by Elmer Bernstein and Ernie Sheldon but, despite the title and composer, did not feature in this movie. Historical basis The film was roughly based on the 1888 true story of the five Marlow Brothers (George H., Boone, Alfred, Lewellyn, and Charles) of Graham, Texas, in Young County, and Marlow, Oklahoma (then Indian Territory). The city of Marlow, Oklahoma, is named after the Marlow family, including their parents, Dr. Wilburn Williamson Marlow, Sr., and Martha Jane (n√©e Keaton) Marlow. Dr. Marlow was the town's first physician and a prominent citizen. Marlow had previously been a Chisholm Trail rest spot near Wild Horse Creek.Shirley, Glenn (1994).

Dr. Marlow died April 12, 1885.Shirley. p. 18.Rathmell and DeArment. p. 35. Three of the brothers (Boone, Alfred, and Lewellyn) ended up being killed, although in the film, the brother that had done the real killings (basis for the Dean Martin role) was not with the other four when they were first arrested. Boone had earlier killed James Holstein (or Holdson or Holston) in 1882, a man allegedly hired to \\"intimidate settlers\\", after an inebriated Holdson began shooting at him on the Gilmore farm near Vernon, Texas, just across the Red River from the Indian Territory (his sister Elizabeth had married into the Gilmore family and the couple had set up a place there).Shirley. pp. 13‚Äì15.Rathmell and DeArment. p. 39. This killing seemed to be justified in self-defense, but would be brought up later by John and William Murphy, deputy marshal Edward W. \\"Ed\\" Johnson, and Sam Criswell, who were having a personal feud with Boone, and would be witnesses against the brothers.Shirley. p. 40. Boone, Alfred (aka Alf), Lewellyn (aka Epp, Ep, Ellie), and Charles were arrested near the Anadarko Agency headquarters (what became Anadarko, Oklahoma), for stealing 19 horses in the area around Fort Sill. George went to the homestead in Marlow and took the women by wagon to Graham where he was then also arrested. Martha Jane bailed them out and they went to their place in Young County, a log and clapboard building on the farm of O. G. Denson, fifteen miles southeast of Graham.Shirley. pp. 38‚Äì39.

Before they left Graham they had been drinking and were intoxicated.Rathmell and DeArment. pp. 63‚Äì64. The Marlows (Charles and his wife, Alfred's wife, Martha, Lewellyn, and Boone Marlow) were sitting down to noon dinner.Shirley. p. 41. Boone saw Collier through the window and invited him in for dinner, to which Collier replied, \\"I'm not hungry.\\" An altercation broke out between Collier and Boone, and without showing their warrant, Collier fired at Boone. As Wallace heard the commotion he came around from the other side of the house and came up behind Collier. Boone, aiming at Collier, shot sheriff Wallace by mistake.Shirley. p. 43. As Collier and Charles attended to Wallace, Boone left the area. The other four brothers went into town and turned themselves in. A mob then tried to avenge the sheriff and attacked the jail, January 17, 1889, but the brothers were able to fight off the mob. On January 19, 1889 (after dark),Savage, Cynthia. \\"MARLOW\\". Oklahoma Historical Society. the deputy then decided to move the four brothers to Weatherford, Texas, chained together along with two other prisoners (William D. Burkhart and Louis Clift). But the two wagons and one buggy were ambushed along the way at Dry Creek (about two miles from Graham).Rathmell and DeArment. p. 87. The deputies guarding the brothers ran away, in league with the ambush party. The brothers managed to get some weapons, get to cover, and hold off the attack, but Alfred and Lewellyn were killed. Also killed were three of the mob that attacked the Marlows: Frank Harmison, Sam Criswell, and Bruce Wheeler.Rathmell and DeArment. p. 93. George and Charles were both wounded (Charles severely so) but escaped, using Burkhart as a hostage and being aided by Clift, and went to their mother's house on the Denson farm. (About halfway there, they stopped in Finis at a farm house and asked to stay the night, but were refused. George spotted an ax and borrowed it to separate the men from their shackles. As soon Burkhart was free, he ran off).Rathmell and DeArment. p. 95. Also wounded were Johnson, Logan, and Clinton \\"Clint\\" Rutherford. The Marlows stayed at their mother's home until lawmen came from outside Young County, and then gave themselves up. Deputy U.S. Marshal W. F. Morton of Dallas finally arrived, took them into custody, and transported them, first toward Weatherford and then, fearing another ambush, to Dallas.Shirley. pp. 80‚Äì82. :\\"This is the first time in the annals of history where unarmed prisoners, shackled together, ever repelled a mob.

Boone had gone to stay with his girlfriend and her family, the Harbolts, in the vicinity of Marlow, but the girlfriend's brother, William \\"G.E.\\" Harbolt, put some poison in the food that his sister took to Boone. William Harbolt had obtained the poison from a Dr. Carter. Harbolt, along with bounty hunters Jim \\"Martin\\" Beavers and John E. Derrickson (aka Direkson), shot his dead body for the $1,700 reward offered for his capture ($200 by the State of Texas and $1,500 by Young County), dead or alive.Rathmell and DeArment. pp. 112, 118. An autopsy by Doctor R. N. Price determined that he was already dead when he had been shot, and that he had died of arsenic poisoning.Shirley. p. 86. The three men were arrested but released on bail. Harbolt was later shot in the Chickasaw Nation of the Indian Territory and Beavers and Derrickson each received 15-year sentences. The five Marlow brothers had been falsely accused of stealing horses, and after the shootout that left three dead, George and Charles were finally acquitted in a Dallas trial. The two brothers then moved to Colorado and became deputies. As deputy marshal Ed Johnson was lying wounded at his home, he gave a newspaper interview to the Graham Leader. In the interview, he said that deputy sheriff Eugene Logan had been one of the guards taking the prisoners to Weatherford, and had been wounded in doing so. In fact, Logan had not been one of the guards but one of the men in the ambush party. The insistence that something be done in the edition of January 24 of the Graham Leader, and this slip up by Johnson, started an investigation into the affair by the U.S. marshal for the Northern District of Texas in Dallas, William Lewis Cabell. In addition, the U.S. attorney sent an investigator to Young County.Shirley. p. 87. Collier, deputy Johnson, David \\"Dink\\" Allen, attorney Robert \\"Bob\\" Holman, Jack Wilkins, W. R.

Wallace (the dead sheriff's nephew), Wil Hollis, William Bee Williams, Richard \\"Dick\\" Cook, deputy sheriff Eugene Logan, constable Sam Waggoner, Clint Rutherford, and Verna Wilkerson were all charged with conspiring to falsify a case against the Marlow brothers, conspiring to kill the Marlow brothers in an ambush, and murdering Alfred and Lewellyn Marlow while they were in the protective custody of a United States Marshal.Logan v. United States, Shirley. pp. 113, 120‚Äì126. However, only Cook, Hollis, Levell, Logan, Rutherford, Waggoner, Wallace, Wilkerson, and Williams, went to trial.Shirley. p. 127. John William \\"Bee\\" Williams and Thomas B. Collier (typhoid fever) died while in jail in mid- January 1891.Shirley. p. 123. George and Charles were summoned to testify and asked for and received protective custody from U.S. Marshal George A. Knight of Dallas. Additionally, Knight made George a \\"Special Deputy\\", while Charles was made an \\"attached witness\\".Shirley. pp. 123‚Äì124, 126. Phlete A. Martin and John Frank Spears (Spears was in jail with the Marlows at the time of the mob attack) both turned state's evidence and testified against the conspirators. Clinton Rutherford was found not guilty on November 22, 1890, and the court removed Rutherford from the indictment, but bound over Eugene Logan and Verna Wilkerson. Logan, Waggoner, and Wallace were found guilty of conspiracy and not guilty of murder on April 17, 1891, and each sentenced to a $5,000 fine and ten years imprisonment. The other defendants (Cook, Levell, Hollis, and Wilkerson) were found not guilty.Shirley. p. 132. The case involving Eugene Logan, William Williams, Verna Wilkerson, and Clinton Rutherford (United States v. Eugene Logan et al.) was separated from the other defendants, and went all the way to the United States Supreme Court. (See Logan v. United States, , filed March 16, 1891.) :\\"A citizen of the United States, in the custody of a United States Marshall under a lawful commitment to answer for an offense against the United States, has the right to be protected by the United States against lawless violence; this right is a right secured to him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and a conspiracy to injure or oppress him in its free exercise or enjoyment is punishable under section 5508 of the Revised Statutes.\\" The city of Graham had wanted to keep a federal court in their town, but after this incident the federal government denied that request.\\"Graham's federal court lasts 15 years\\".

Industry uses  Once a mailing list has been poisoned with a number of invalid e-mail addresses, the resources required to send a message to this list has increased, even though the number of valid recipients has not. If one can poison a spammer's mailing list, one can force the spammer to exhaust more resources to send e-mail, in theory costing the spammer money and time. Poisoning spammers' mailing lists is usually done by blacklists submitting fake information to email submit style offers, or by posting invalid email addresses in a Usenet forum or on a web page where spammers are believed to harvest email addresses for their mailing lists.  Vulnerabilities  * Syntactically invalid email addresses used to poison a mailing list could be easily filtered out by the spammers, while using email addresses that are syntactically correct could cause problems for the mail server responsible for the email address. * Implementations of spam poisoning systems can be avoided, if spammers learn of their location (e. g., they could automatically filter out any address containing \\"spampoison.com\\"). * Spammers often steal resources so that the efficiency of a mailing places little financial burden on the spammer.

Film career Lowe's career included over 100 films in which he starred as the leading man. He is best remembered for his role as Sergeant Quirt in the 1926 movie, What Price Glory. (Lowe reprised his role from the movie in the radio program Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt, broadcast on the Blue Network September 28, 1941 - January 25, 1942, and on NBC February 13, 1942 - April 3, 1942.) Making a smooth transition to talking pictures he remained popular but by the mid 1930s he was no longer a major star although he occasionally played leading man to the likes of Mae West and Claudette Colbert. He portrayed the young doctor trying to get out of an affair with Wallace Beery's character's wife, played by Jean Harlow, in Dinner at Eight (1933). He remained a supporting actor at the major studios while continuing in leads for such \\"Poverty Row\\" studios as Columbia Pictures where his skills could bolster low budget productions. He also starred in 35 episodes of the 1950s television show, Front Page Detective and appeared as the elderly lead villain in the first episode of Maverick opposite James Garner in 1957. Marriages After his first marriage to Esther Miller ended in early 1925, Lowe met Lilyan Tashman while filming Ports of Call. Lowe and Tashman were wed on September 21, 1925. The wedding occurred before the release of the film. The two had California homes in Beverly Hills and Malibu. They were married until Tashman's death from cancer at age 37 in 1934.

Biography J. Hampton Moore was born in Woodbury, New Jersey. He worked as a reporter on the Philadelphia Public Ledger and the Court Combination from 1881 to 1894. He was chief clerk to the city treasurer of Philadelphia from 1894 to 1897 and secretary to the mayor in 1900. He served as president of the Allied Republican Clubs of Philadelphia, of the Pennsylvania State League, and of the National League of Republican Clubs from 1900 to 1906. He worked as city treasurer from 1901 to 1903. He was appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt as the first Chief of the Bureau of Manufactures, Department of Commerce and Labor, in January 1905, but resigned after six months' service to become president of a Philadelphia bank. He was president of the Atlantic Deeper Waterways Association from 1907 to 1947. Moore was elected as a Republican to the 59th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of George A. Castor. He was re-elected seven times and served from November 6, 1906, to January 4, 1920, when he resigned to become the 109th mayor of Philadelphia. He was a delegate to the 1920 Republican National Convention. Elected in 1919, Moore first served as mayor of Philadelphia from 1920 to 1923. He was then appointed by the United States State Department as a delegate to the International Navigation Congress at Cairo, Egypt, in 1926. After being defeated in 1927, he returned to the mayor's office in Philadelphia following a victory in the 1931 Philadelphia mayoral election, serving from 1932 to 1935 as its 111th incumbent. During his terms as mayor, Moore banned the showing of films by Roscoe Arbuckle because the charges pending against Arbuckle for rape and murder would offend public morals. This motion occurred concurrent with Arbuckle's arrest, prior to Arbuckle's trial and eventual acquittal. Legacy Moore was one of three mayors of Philadelphia the city honored by naming a fireboat after him. Bibliography *Drayer, Robert E. \\"J.

Previously, one had to download software, called Wordbiz, to play, but Wordbiz is no longer supported. Using ISC Players start games either by sending or accepting a \\"seek,\\" or sending or accepting a match request. A seek is a request for a game with certain parameters, including the time limit (between 3 and 60 whole minutes), the type of challenge (SINGLE, DOUBLE, 5-POINTS, or VOID), and the minimum and maximum ratings criteria that the other player must meet. Organisation and management The ISC was created and is run by the player known as Carol (real name Florin Gheorghe), who lives in Romania, hence the URL www.isc.ro. The other administrator is Herve, who is the 2005 French matchplay national champion, Herv√© Bohbot. The administrators invite certain players to be moderators, also known as helpers. There is a command, 'ASK', whereby players may ask questions of the helpers; if a helper answers a question, the question and the answer will appear on channel 0. Some helpers are given the power to restrict the activities of players who have violated the rules of the site, e.g. by using inappropriate language. The primary function of the moderators, who are only intermittently present, is to answer questions about the site and to moderate the language and content of the discussions in order to make the site pleasant for most players. The players are split into two categories‚Äîmembers and contributory members. The ISC is a free service; no member needs to pay to use the site's facilities. But there are benefits for contributory or support players, who pay an annual fee. These benefits include the right to play against computer players, to save games in a library, to use an examiner program that suggests solutions for game positions, and many others. A full list of benefits can be found at the ISC website linked below.  Bots  There are about 35 robots that are playable on ISC. On the server, which is hosted in the US, the list of bots is accessed using \\"who C\\". Contributory members have priority over non-contributory members when requesting to play against these robots. The bots have different skill levels. Bamse, Adela, and Myrrhs are novices; Keres, Automat, and Dogberry are intermediates; Waxberry, Alehin, and Woland are experts. It is advised that the initial time be set relatively high, because the bots take no time to make their moves. On the ISC seek graph, bots are denoted by a square instead of a dot. The bots also have C next to their names. Finally, players who intend to use an anagram program on ISC must inform Carol or Herve, the administrators, so \\"C labels\\" can be assigned to them.  Other languages on the ISC  The ISC does its best to use official word lists‚Äîthose used in club and tournament competition in various countries. It uses two English-language word sets: TWL15, which is used in the U.S., Canada, Thailand and Israel, and SOWPODS, which is used for the rest of the world. But the ISC caters to multiple languages. It uses ODS 5 for French, LOC v.4 for Romanian, ZINGA for Italian and SWL for Dutch. There is also the \\"Multi\\" dictionary, which consists of English, French, and Romanian words, and has proved popular for online tournaments. There is also the option of playing Clabbers.

A Meyer's parrot has black feathers, turquoise belly, blue rump, and bright yellow markings on the carpal joint of the wings. Most subspecies have some yellow on the top of the head as well. Forshaw (1989) recognizes six subspecies of P. meyeri which vary in home range, size and in markings, including the extent of yellow markings to the head and wings and the intense of turquoise markings on the belly and rump. Taxonomy German physician and ornithologist Philipp Jakob Cretzschmar described Meyer's parrot in 1827. The name commemorates the German ornithologist Bernhard Meyer. The six subspecies are: *P. m. meyeri (Cretzschmar, 1827) ‚Äî s Chad to w Ethiopia *P. m. saturatus (Sharpe, 1901) ‚Äî Uganda and w Kenya to w Tanzania *P. m. matschiei (Neumann, 1898) ‚Äî c Tanzania, se Congo, Zambia and n Malawi *P. m. reichenowi (Neumann, 1898) ‚Äî c Angola to s Congo *P. m. damarensis (Neumann, 1898) ‚Äî n Namibia, s Angola and nw Botswana *P. m. transvaalensis (Neumann, 1899) ‚Äî Botswana, Zimbabwe and n South Africa Subspecies P. m. damarensis and P. m. reichenowi lack yellow markings on the head, while P. m. transvaalensis may have little to no yellow on the head. Belly and rump colours vary according to subspecies from turquoise to blue. Distribution and habitat Meyer's parrots are native to the plateau woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa where they occur in several woodland types including miombo, savanna woodlands, wooded grasslands and forests bordering watercourses or agricultural land. They are found in high densities in the Okavango Delta region of Botswana. They are also found in southern and central Africa (Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Congo, Angola, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Namibia. Behaviour =Food and feeding= Their wild diet includes fruit, seeds, nuts, berries and cultivated crops. Seeds of the various leguminous trees of the African woodlands are especially favoured, providing their staple food in some areas. Although they normally travel in pairs or small flocks, wild Meyer's parrots may gather in much larger numbers where food is plentiful. In drought years they wander in search of food. =Breeding= The Meyer's parrot nests in tree cavities. The eggs are white and there are usually three or four in a clutch. The female incubates the eggs for about 28 days and the chicks leave the nest about 60 days after hatching. Conservation status P. m. damarensis pair in Etosha National Park P. m. saturatus in the Serengeti Meyer's parrots are still common in the wild, although numbers have decreased locally following destruction of woodlands. It is generally not considered to be at risk, as their large population, limited pressure from trade and hunting, and 6,000,000 km2 home range make these birds unlikely to face extinction in the near future. Trade in Meyer's parrots that have been bred in aviculture is legal. Meyer's parrots are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna. Appendix II listing means the species can also be taken from the wild and traded in 'limited' numbers. In aviculture Meyer's parrots are commonly bred for the pet trade. They are relatively quiet and small and are able to learn dozens of words.

Stardust is one of the many Heralds of Galactus. Unlike most of Galactus's Heralds, Stardust seeks to kill all who attempt to escape the planets that Galactus feeds upon, an action that Galactus neither requires nor forbids. This Stardust should not be confused with the other Marvel character known as Stardust, a former enemy of Rom the Spaceknight. Fictional character biography The Ethereal Lambda-Zero, who later became known as Stardust, the Herald of Galactus, was first introduced in the comics series Stormbreaker: The Saga of Beta Ray Bill. The first planet Stardust fed to Galactus was New Korbin, after she slaughtered most of the planet's inhabitants. This led to a series of confrontation with Beta Ray Bill, who was busy attempting to rescue the Korbinites. The two fought each other, and after the first confrontation, Stardust sought out Bill after he obtained the Meta-Orb. Planning on crushing Bill with it, the two fought each other until Stardust opened a portal to a dimension filled with the most evil beings of the universe hoping to trap Bill there. Bill managed to escape, but a being named Asteroth escaped and began destroying entire worlds. Stardust and Bill joined forces, with Stardust using his powers to open a black hole behind Asteroth hoping to lock Asteroth in it. However, Asteroth resisted and the hole instead sucked both Stardust and Bill to a near death. Galactus had empowered Ray to help Stardust take down her opponent. With the black hole still open, Ray managed to do this, but in return was together with Asteroth sucked into the hole. Stardust has returned off-panel through unknown means, evident by her presence in Annihilation. =Annihilation= Stardust is sent by Galactus to ask the Silver Surfer to meet with Galactus.Annihilation: Silver Surfer miniseries Stardust meanwhile is under orders to help the other remaining former heralds Red Shift and Firelord as they combat the Annihilation wave fleet. Later the three heralds join with Nova's United Front and defeat and capture one of Annihilus' queens. With the Silver Surfer and Galactus now captured and Firelord half-dead, Stardust and Red Shift are the only two active heralds. Stardust and Red Shift were presumed dead after holding back a massive energy blast from Galactus' absorbing device. Stardust has since returned.Fantastic Four #547 (May 2007) It is later revealed that Stardust is an Ethereal, a race of beings of pure energy, and that being imbued with the Power Cosmic, in effect, made Stardust indestructible, allowing her to reconstitute herself if \\"destroyed\\". She was then confronted by the last fifty-three members of their race, who were nearly made extinct by the Annihilation Wave. Accusing Stardust of treason for leaving them, they attacked Stardust, and in the ensuing battle Stardust \\"kills\\" the remaining members of their race in self-defense, and then absorbs the remainder of their living energies. However, she then finds Galactus and, distraught that she has been replaced as a Herald by the Silver Surfer, gives up the remains of her race to feed Galactus, against their protests; an act that surprises Galactus, as no herald has ever willingly given up its race to Galactus.

The University of Virginia's Alderman Library is named after him, as is Edwin A. Alderman Elementary School in Wilmington and Alderman dorm at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Alderman was the key leader in higher education in Virginia during the Progressive Era as president of the University of Virginia, 1904-31. His goal was the transformation of the Southern university into a force for state service and intellectual leadership and educational utility. Alderman successfully professionalized and modernized Virginia's system of higher education. He promoted international standards of scholarship and a statewide network of extension services. Joined by other college presidents, he promoted the Virginia Education Commission, created in 1910. Alderman's crusade encountered some resistance from traditionalists and never challenged the Jim Crow system of segregated schooling.Michael Dennis, \\"Reforming the 'academical village,'\\" Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, 1997, Vol. 105 Issue 1, pp 53-86 Career Alderman graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1882, where he was a member of the Dialectic Society. He became a schoolteacher in Goldsboro, North Carolina, and then superintendent of the school district there. In 1891, Alderman and Charles Duncan McIver successfully pressed the North Carolina Legislature to establish the Normal and Industrial School for Women, now known as the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. Alderman taught there until 1893 when he became a professor at the University of North Carolina; he was named president of that institution in 1896. He moved on to take the same position at Tulane University in 1900, before moving again to the University of Virginia in 1904. There he stayed for 27 years, until his death in 1931 from a stroke in Connellsville, Pennsylvania, while en route to deliver a speech in Illinois. He is buried at the University of Virginia Cemetery. Alderman's gravestone at the University of Virginia Cemetery in Charlottesville, Virginia. Alderman was a noted public speaker, and won fame for his memorial address for Woodrow Wilson, delivered to a joint session of Congress on December 15, 1924. At the University of Virginia In 1904, the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia invited Alderman, then president of Tulane University, to become the first president of the University of Virginia. Since its founding in 1819, University had been governed by its Board of Visitors, but increasing discord between Visitors and the faculty, as well as the rising administrative burden of dealing with expanding academic departments and burgeoning student enrollments, led to the decision to move forward with the creation of the office of the president.Bruce, pp. 28-38. Alderman was not the first choice for the new office. After considering other candidates, including Virginia Law graduate Woodrow Wilson,Bruce, p. 29. the Board had first invited its former member George W. Miles, a colonel who had served on the staff of Virginia Governor James Hoge Tyler. The faculty opposed Miles' nomination and he was forced to withdraw. Other candidates were proposed, including Francis Preston Venable (who had succeeded Alderman as president of the University of North Carolina), but Alderman was unanimously chosen as the consensus candidate on June 14, 1904. He began to serve in the fall of 1904 but was not formally inaugurated until April 13, 1905 (Thomas Jefferson's birthday, celebrated as Founder's Day).Bruce, p. 38. The University of Virginia changed in several significant ways under Alderman's guidance. First, he focused new attention on matters of public concern, helped create departments of geology and forestry, added significantly to the University Hospital to support new sickbeds and public health research, helped create the Curry School of Education, established the extension and summer school programs, and helped create the first school of finance and commerce at the school.Bruce, p. 61. He then restructured existing programs, separating the former ‚Äúacademic department‚Äù into the College of Arts and Sciences and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, in accordance with a growing move to standardize college educations by the Association of American Universities.Bruce, p. 110-114. The enrollment of the school greatly increased under his administration, as well, going from 500 regular session students in 1904 to 2,200 in 1929.Dabney, p. 132. Alderman also laid the financial groundwork for the University's future. During the first years of his presidency he established its first endowment fund and led the fundraising of almost $700,000 to meet a $500,000 challenge grant from Andrew Carnegie.Bruce, p. 321-326. By the end of his presidency the endowment would increase to $10 million.Dabney, p. 84.

The marriage was considered suitable in status and welcomed by both houses, as there were few royal Protestant houses to choose between at that point for either party. The preferred choice for a bride was initially Princess Louisa, but after the Danish representative in London, Count von Bothmer, was informed of her weak constitution, her two years younger sister Caroline Mathilda was chosen for the match instead.Bregnsbo, Michael: Caroline Mathilde.

Geography One source says the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains range is about in length. Its highest point is located to the northwest of Lhasa. The range is parallel to the Himalayas in the Transhimalayas, and north of the Brahmaputra River. Another source says the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains extend from Ny√™mo County in the west to Ranwu County (the southwestern part of Baxoi County) in the east. Its highest peak is Mount Nyenchen Tanglha (Nyainq√™ntanglha Feng) at . The southern side of the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains is precipitous, and falls by around , while the northern side is fairly level and descends about . Most of the mountains are below . They contain 7080 glaciers covering an area of . The Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains have an average latitude of 30¬∞30'N and a longitude between 90¬∞E and 97¬∞E. Together with the Gangdise Shan located further west, it forms the Transhimalaya which runs parallel to the Himalayas north of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. The Drukla Chu river rises in the Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains, where it is called the Song Chu river, and joins the Gyamda Chu river. The combined rivers run about southeast to the Yarlung Tsangpo river. =Subranges= The range is divided into two main parts: the West and East Nyenchen Tanglha, with a division at the high Tro La Pass near Lhari Town. West Nyenchen Tanglha Mount Nyenchen Tanglha above Namtso. The West Nyenchen Tanglha lies to the southeast of Namtso. The range trends to the northeast, and forms part of the northern watershed of the Yarlung Tsangpo River. The northeastern section is drained by the Lhasa River, the largest tributary of the Yarlung Tsangpo. West Nyenchen Tanglha includes the four highest peaks in the range, all above : Mount Nyenchen Tanglha (7162m), Nyenchen Tanglha II (7117m), Nyenchen Tanglha III (7046m) and Jomo Gangtse (7048m), all located in Damxung County of Lhasa. West Nyenchen Tanglha separates the basins of the Yarlung Tsangpo in the south from the endorheic basins of the Changtang in the north. East Nyenchen Tanglha East Nyenchen Tanglha, located in Nagqu Prefecture, Chamdo and Nyingchi Prefecture, marks the water divide between the Yarlung Tsangpo to the south and the Nak Chu river (which becomes the Nujiang and Salween in its lower reach) to the north. The rugged and heavily glaciated range counts more than 240 peaks over , culminating with Sepu Kangri (6,956 m) which has a 2,213 m topographic prominence and is away from a higher point. Large areas of the eastern sector are snow-covered. Two-thirds of the glaciers, accounting for five-sixths of the area, lie in the eastern section. This section receives the southwest monsoons, which enter the Tibetan plateau at the Yarlung Zanbo river's Grand Bend. The air is forced up by the terrain, and yields the highest rainfall and moistest air of the plateau, which feeds the development of glaciers. There are thirty-two glaciers that are over long. Kyagquen Glacier is the largest, covering and extending for . The end of the Qiaqing glacial tongue is at in an area of mountain forests. The glacier foot is at .

Jackson and Lomax assemble a gang and plan to rob the war wagon at the weakest point in the route it travels. Things do not quite work out as planned. Pierce dies in a shootout with one of his own men trying to escape from the war wagon. The wagon crashes into a ravine, Lomax opens the safe, and the men move the gold into a separate wagon. However, before they can haul it away, a group of Kiowas try to take it from them. During the ensuing gunfight, the horses are spooked and run away with the wagon, and most of the gold is lost as a result. Nevertheless, Taw manages to recover a portion of it, and they agree to meet in six months to divide it, since \\"it wouldn't be very smart to flash gold around after a robbery\\".

He later said he wrote the novel in ten days. In September 1962 Huffaker announced he would adapt the novel into a script at Producers Studio for his own Lucifer Productions. They were also going to make Guns of Rio Conchos, The Day Before Tomorrow and Ship on Highway 7. The project eventually went to Universal. Huffaker spent three months writing the script. In June 1966 John Wayne announced he had signed a two-picture deal with Universal, the movies being The War Wagon and The Green Berets. The film would be a co production between Wayne's company, Batjac, and producer Marvin Schwartz. It was the eleventh book of Huffaker's that he had sold to the movies. As a result, Trident Publishing put him under contract to write a book a year for five years. In July 1966 Kirk Douglas was announced for the co-starring role. The same month Burt Kennedy signed to direct. Filming started 19 September 1966 and went for 12 weeks. The film was shot in Durango, Mexico and Curubusco Studios in Mexico City. \\"We have great, manly cynical humor going for us now\\", said Wayne. \\"One cute scene and we're dead.\\" He added that \\"We're gaining a day every week. This combined Hollywood and Mexican crew is great. If we can come home a week under schedule, we'll all be home with our families for turkey dinner.\\" Huffaker was present on set for the first and last three weeks of production. While there he made a number of further changes to the script. Kennedy said he let Wayne direct himself. The extensive second-unit stunt work was supervised by Cliff Lyons.

It grossed $9,563,000 in total, making it a success. One account called it a \\"smash success\\". =Critical response= The War Wagon was met with generally positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars, who called it \\"that comparative rarity, a Western filmed with quiet good humor.

Fictional character biography =Lana Lang= Earth-One The first Insect Queen was Lana Lang, Superman's romantic interest from his youth in Smallville. In Superboy #124 (Oct. 1965), Lana rescues an insect-like alien trapped under a tree. In gratitude, he gives her a bio-genetic ring that allows her to gain the powers of insects or arachnids (by giving her lower body the form of a particular bug; each form could only be gained once per day, however). She decides to use it to develop the costumed identity of the superheroine Insect Queen.Superboy #124 (Oct. 1965). DC Comics. Lana does not pursue the career for long, though she did gain reserve status in the Legion of Super-Heroes.Adventure Comics #355 (April 1967). DC Comics. Earth-Two The second Insect Queen was also Lana, but the one from the parallel universe of Earth-2. In The Superman Family #213 (1981), she as an adult receives a scarab found by her archeologist father in an Egyptian tomb, not realizing that it was magical. Possessed by it, Lana became a supervillainess called Insect Queen, with the ability to control and enlarge insects. She briefly worked with the Ultra-Humanite, while the latter's mind was housed within a gigantic ant, until she was saved by the Earth-2 Superman and his wife Lois Lane. Later, she became an occasional superhero, aiding Superman on at least one occasion.The Superman Family #213 (1981). DC Comics. In the reality changed by the \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\", Lana never became either Insect Queen. New Earth In the new continuity created by the events chronicled in Infinite Crisis, a new Insect Queen has been introduced. She is an insectoid alien who first appears in Superman #671-673 (2008). In a nod towards the Silver Age continuity this alien Insect Queen has remade herself in the image of Lana Lang. The Insect Queen comes from the All-Hive, a civilization of giant insects. Because only one Queen can rule the All-Hive, she and her followers were sent to colonize a new world, suspended in an amber-like substance. Upon contacting Earth, she made an arrangement with Lex Luthor for assistance in colonizing Earth, including acquiring a body suitable for the planet. In return for this, she sent some of her people, the Flea Circus, to assist him in collecting Kryptonite. She also began transforming workers on a LexCorp moonbase into worker insects.Superman #651 (June 2006). DC Comics. When Insect Queen returns for her part of the bargain, she found that Lana Lang was now CEO of LexCorp. She kidnaps Lang and takes her to the moonbase, where she metamorphoses into a form resembling Lana, but with insect-like features, including wings, four arms, antennae and chitinous plates. While trying to rescue Lana, Superman is captured by Insect Queen due to her midges entering his skull and enhancing her psychic abilities. She then uses his genetic template to create \\"super soldier-ants\\". However, he is freed by Lana, and traps her in her suspended animation amber before she can use her mind-control powers again. The Queen makes a return one year later. While attending a student journalism award ceremony with Jimmy Olsen and Cat Grant, Lana suddenly collapses, with blood pouring out her nose.Supergirl (Vol. 5) #40. DC Comics. She receives a call from her doctor telling her that he has \\"bad news\\" for her.Supergirl (Vol. 5) #45. DC Comics. Following another collapse, Lana is taken to hospital and operated on. She apparently dies on the operating table, but her body is later encased in a cocoon by black insect-like creatures, which then starts to crack open.Supergirl (Vol. 5) #49. DC Comics. The hospital is soon engulfed by a gigantic cocoon-like structure, and a number of workers as well as the Science Police and the Guardian are taken hostage by an army of giant insects. Supergirl is soon captured and awakens bound and gagged at the feet of Lana, who is now possessed by the Insect Queen. The Queen reveals to Supergirl that during her last encounter with Lana, she injected her with a portion of her DNA and has been slowly taking control of her body for the past year, with the ultimate goal of capturing a Kryptonian to use as a template for an army of hybrid insects. Supergirl breaks free and is able to expel the Queen from Lana's body with help from Kryptonian technology, and Lana returns to her normal state.Supergirl (Vol. 5) #50.

He was killed by the Ottoman authorities during the Armenian Genocide.  Life  Siamanto on a 2003 Armenian stamp He was born in 1878, in the town of Agn () on the shores of the river Euphrates. He lived in his native town until the age of 14. He studied at the Nersesian institute as a youth, where he developed an interest in poetry. The school‚Äôs director encouraged him to continue developing his poetic talents. The director, Garegin Srvandztiants, gave him the name Siamanto, after the hero of one of his stories. Atom would use this name for the rest of his days. Siamanto came from a middle-upper-class family. They moved to Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1891 where he continued his studies at the Berberian Institute. He graduated in 1896, during the bloody Hamidian massacres. Like many other Armenian intellectuals, he fled the country for fear of persecution. He ended up in Egypt where he became depressed because of the butchery that his fellow Armenians had to endure. In 1897, he moved to Paris and enrolled in literature at the prestigious Sorbonne University. He was captivated by philosophy and Middle Eastern literature. He had to work various jobs while pursuing his studies because of his difficult financial situation. He developed many ties with well-known Armenian personalities in and outside Paris. He enjoyed reading in French and in Armenian, and read many of the best works of his time. From Paris he moved to Geneva in Switzerland, and contributed to the newspaper Droshak, the organ of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. His first poetic works were published in this newspaper under the headlines of Heroically (Armenian: ‘¥’´÷Ç÷Å’°’¶’∂÷Ö÷Ä’ß’∂) and The Knight‚Äôs Song (Armenian: ‘±’Ω’∫’•’ø’´’∂ ‘µ÷Ä’£’®). The paper detailed the destruction of his homeland, was highly critical of the Ottoman government, and demanded equal rights for Armenians and more autonomy. Siamanto joined the cause and truly believed in an Armenia free of Turkish oppression. Henceforth, many of his works and poems were highly nationalistic. Siamanto fell ill in 1904, coming down with a case of pneumonia. He was treated at a hospital in Geneva and eventually fully recovered. For the next 4 years, he lived in various European cities such as Paris, Zurich, and Geneva. In 1908, along with many other Armenians, he returned to Constantinople after the proclamation of the Ottoman Constitution. However, in 1909, the Ottoman government made it clear that they were not safe by perpetrating the Adana massacre. Siamanto was once again deeply affected by the bloodshed. These events led him to write his famous Bloody News from my Friend (Armenian: ‘ø’°÷Ä’¥’´÷Ä ’¨’∏÷Ç÷Ä’•÷Ä ’¢’°÷Ä’•’Ø’°’¥’ß’Ω).  Works  Heroically (Armenian: ‘¥’´÷Ç÷Å’°’¶’∂÷Ö÷Ä’ß’∂) was written starting in 1897 and finally printed in 1902 in Paris. It was a book about the hardships of Armenians living under the harsh Ottoman rule. Siamanto encouraged the youth to stand up for their rights and demand equality and justice. Sons of Armenia (Armenian: ’Ä’°’µ’∏÷Ä’§’´’∂’•÷Ä) was written between 1902 and 1908 and included three volumes. The first one was released in 1905 and dealt with the deep grief and mourning that many had to endure after the Hamidian massacres and other Turkish atrocities. Torches of Agony and Hope (Armenian: ’Ä’∏’£’•’æ’°÷Ä÷Ñ’´ ’•÷Ç ’µ’∏’µ’Ω’´ ’ª’°’∞’•÷Ä) was released in 1907 described in stunning details scenes of massacres, blood and anguish. He portrayed the deep thoughts and feelings of the victims and their daily torment. The plight of a whole people can be felt while reading this work. The author successfully makes the reader feel for the characters and easily win their sympathy. Bloody News from My Friend (Armenian: ‘ø’°÷Ä’¥’´÷Ä ’¨’∏÷Ç÷Ä’•÷Ä ’¢’°÷Ä’•’Ø’°’¥’ß’Ω) was written right after the Adana massacre of 1909. It is a poetic work reflecting the pain the author felt for his fellow countrymen. The Homeland‚Äôs Invitation (Armenian: ’Ä’°’µ÷Ä’•’∂’´ ’∞÷Ä’°÷Ç’ß÷Ä) was printed in 1910 and released in the United States. He wrote about his yearning for his country and encouraged Armenians living abroad to return to their native soil. Saint Mesrop (Armenian: ’ç’∏÷Ç÷Ä’¢ ’Ñ’•’Ω÷Ä’∏’∫), published in 1913, is a long poem dedicated to Saint Mesrop, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet.  Writing style  Siamanto in his office in Boston in 1910. Siamanto was a pioneer in Armenian poetry. His style was new and unique, and the methodology was exceptional. His themes were very dark and dealt extensively with death, torture, loss, misery, and sorrow. He recounted scenes of massacres, executions by hanging, bloody streets, pillaged villages, etc.; in other words, they dealt with the slaughter of Armenian men and women. The suffering of the people was continually tormenting him in turn. He spent many sleepless nights thinking about those who perished. Writing about their fate was his way of coping with the pain and making sure they were not killed in silence. Life for the Armenians was bleak under Ottoman rule and Siamanto‚Äôs works described that fact of life very well. However, his poems and writings go beyond the pain. He wrote about hope, freedom from oppression, and the possibility of a better future. His ideas also went to revolutionary themes and revenge for the murdered. Siamanto had two sides to his writing: one of lamentation, and the other of resistance. It is from this ideology of resistance that his revolutionary beliefs grew. He was convinced that the road to salvation for his people was through armed struggle. He was hoping to ignite the revolutionary spirit in the younger generation of Armenians and to make them understand that indifference and inaction was not going to save them. He was so gripped with these troubles that he seldom wrote about himself, his personal life, love, or joy. Siamanto had a very vivid imagination. The images he created can sometimes even feel a little out of the ordinary at times. He used many aspects from the symbolic school of thought in his works. He did not know modesty; we went to extremes both while writing about desperation or about hope. His consistency in his chosen themes went to show how passionately he felt for his cause. His works give a clear image of the spirit that existed at the time in the minds of many of the Armenian populace.  Death  In 1910, he moved to the United States as an editor at the Hairenik newspaper (Armenian: ’Ä’°’µ÷Ä’•’∂’´÷Ñ). After a year, he returned to Constantinople. In 1913 he visited Tbilisi. On his way to his destination, he visited many famous Armenian landmarks such as Mount Ararat, Khor Virap and Echmiadzin. He was one of the Armenian intellectuals tortured and killed by the Ottomans in 1915 during the Armenian Genocide.

Her home port was St. Ignace, Michigan, and she shuttled back and forth during her entire working life between that port and Mackinaw City, Michigan. History =Railroad ferry= The Chief Wawatam was designed by Great Lakes marine architect Frank E. Kirby. She was launched in Toledo, Ohio, by the Toledo Shipbuilding Company on 26 August 1911, and went into service for the Mackinac Transportation Company on 18 October 1911. The Mackinac Transportation Company was a joint venture of the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway, the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, and the Michigan Central Railroad, the three railroads that serviced the Straits of Mackinac. Year-round train ferry service in the Straits of Mackinac was a significant challenge because of the heavy ice buildup experienced by these straits in winter. The Chief Wawatam was designed to break ice floes with her bow propeller, which could both maneuver the boat and suck water out from underneath the ice to enable it to be broken through force of gravity. Statue of Ojibwa Chief Wawatam in Mackinaw City, Michigan The Chief Wawatam was 338 feet in length and had a beam of 62 feet. Her three propellers, two in the stern and one on the bow, were driven by coal-fired triple-expansion steam engines. The Chief is believed to have been the last hand-fired, coal-burning boat in commercial service on the Great Lakes. Other coal-burning vessels that survived longer in revenue service, such as the , had automatic stokers. The vessel was named after an Ojibwa chief of the 1700s; he was said to have rescued trader Alexander Henry during the Ojibwa uprising at Michilimackinac in 1763. A wooden statue of the chief stands near the harbor in Mackinaw City, Michigan, in Wawatam Park. It was carved by Jerry Prior from a one-hundred-year-old white pine log. http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/wawatam_3E.html, WAWATAM, Ojibwa chief at Michilimackinac; fl. 1762‚Äì64.https://www.mackinawcity.com/history-carved-in- wood/, History Carved in Wood =Relics= Need by shippers for the Straits of Mackinac train ferry service provided by the Mackinac Transportation Company declined following construction of the Mackinac Bridge in 1957. After cross- Straits of Mackinac railroad car ferry service ended in 1984, the Chief lay in mothballs for several years in Cheboygan and Mackinaw City. She was towed to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, in 1989 and cut down at that port to serve as a barge. In November 2009 it was reported that barge Chief Wawatam was being scrapped. At the time of this final scrappage she was one of the last survivors of the Great Storm of 1913. One of the Chief's triple-expansion engines was withheld from salvage and, after being restored to operating condition, was placed on display in 2005 at the Wisconsin Maritime Museum in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Other artifacts from the ferry, including the whistle, wheel, telegraphs, and furniture, are preserved by the Mackinac Island State Park Commission in Mackinaw City.

Life before politics Wells was educated at Eton College and Corpus Christi College, Oxford (MA). He served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve during the Second World War, as a seaman in 1942, commissioned in 1943 and in submarines until 1946. He was a marine engineer, company director and farmer, and was a councillor on Leamington Spa Borough Council. Political career At the 1955 general election, Wells stood unsuccessfully in the Smethwick constituency. At the 1959 general election, he was elected as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Maidstone, following in the footsteps of a 19th-century ancestor, also John Wells. He held the safe Conservative seat until his retirement at the 1987 general election, when his successor was the future minister Ann Widdecombe. Throughout his period as a Member of Parliament, Wells was a strong supporter of country interests and the local economy, on one occasion riding his horse through the streets of Westminster and on another loudly eating a Kentish apple during a speech by a Labour Minister of Agriculture, as a protest against the import of cheap, subsidised and, in his opinion, inferior imports from France. He was appointed to the Speaker's Panel of Chairmen in 1974, becoming senior Chairman of Standing Committees in 1983 until his retirement. He became chairman of the Horticultural Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on Agriculture in 1968 and was Master of the Worshipful Company of Fruiterers in 1977. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1984 and appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Kent in 1992. Personal life Wells married in 1948, Lucinda, eldest daughter of Francis R Meath Baker, of Hasfield Court, Gloucestershire. In 1958 the family moved to Mere House in Mereworth, Kent. The house had been built in the 18th century by Sir Francis Dashwood, a distant ancestor of Lucinda. The Wells family have themselves had a long association with West Kent dating back to at least the 16th century, and were mentioned by Samuel Pepys in his famous diary as owners of a successful shipbuilders on the Thames.

It is located below the East Front of the Capitol and its plaza, between the Capitol building and 1st Street East. The complex contains of space below ground on three floors. The overall project's budget was $621 million. The CVC has space for use by the Congress, including multiple new meeting and conference rooms. On the House side, there is a large room which will most likely be used by a committee. The new Congressional Auditorium, a 450-seat theater, will be available for use by members of Congress or for either House of Congress should their respective chamber be unavailable. The CVC officially opened on December 2, 2008. This date was selected to coincide with the 145th anniversary of placing Thomas Crawford's Statue of Freedom atop the Capitol building in 1863, signifying the completion of construction of its dome. Design concept Aerial view The CVC contains three underground levels: a balcony level entrance, the Emancipation Hall (second) level and a third restricted level for new Congressional offices and meeting rooms. The construction of the CVC represents the largest-ever expansion of the United States Capitol and more than doubles the footprint of the US Capitol building complex. The American Institute of Architects gave RTKL Associates Inc. with the Award of Excellence in Historic Resources for their work on the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. The award was presented at the Architecture Week Closing Party & Design Awards Gala on September 30, 2010, in Washington, D.C. Construction history House Speaker Dennis Hastert and former Architect of the Capitol Alan Hantman tour the CVC during the early stages of construction. Construction of the CVC was supervised by the Architect of the Capitol. That post was held by Alan Hantman, FAIA until his term expired on February 4, 2007; construction was then continued by then Acting Architect of the Capitol Stephen T. Ayers, AIA, LEED AP. Construction of the CVC in July 2004 The ceremonial groundbreaking for the CVC took place on June 20, 2000. Although originally planned to be completed by January 2004, the final completion date (not including the Senate and House expansion space) was extended to December 2, 2008. The proposed cost was originally $71 million, but it has risen to $621 million. The CVC has caused controversy for being over budget and behind schedule. Much of this is blamed on the rising cost of fuel, post-9/11 security measures, and inclement weather. At a hearing on the CVC cost-overruns Representative Jack Kingston called it \\"a monument to government inefficiency, ineptitude and excessiveness.\\" The first major construction contract, worth nearly $100 million, was awarded to Balfour Beatty (formerly Centex Construction), in the spring of 2002. This contract involved site demolition, slurry wall construction, excavation, construction of columns, installation of site utilities, construction of the concrete and structural steel, waterproofing, and construction of a new service tunnel. By July 2005, Balfour Beatty Construction completed all excavation and structural activities, and the roof deck covered the entire CVC structure. Manhattan Construction Company was responsible for the build-out including, installation of electrical, mechanical and plumbing systems, coordination with existing Capitol building systems where the center connects within the Capitol building, and completion of the above-ground East Front Plaza, with related site work and security elements. Operations and features Entrance to the Visitors Center The space is mainly designed for use as a holding zone for visitors waiting to take tours of the Capitol. The number of annual visitors to the Capitol has tripled from 1,000,000 in 1970 to nearly 3,000,000 as of recent times, and it has become difficult to deal with the congestion caused by such crowds. In the past, visitors were required to line up on the Capitol's east stairs, sometimes stretching all the way to 1st Street East. This wait could last hours and no protection was offered against inclement weather. Tickets were not timed and were on a first-come, first-served basis. With the addition of the CVC, visitors now have a secure, handicap-accessible, and educational place to wait before their Capitol tours commence. Visitors are free to explore the CVC, which houses an exhibition hall, two gift shops, and a 530-seat food court. Visiting the CVC and the Capitol are free. Tickets for Capitol tours are also free and are available online for order ahead of time. =Emancipation Hall= Emancipation Hall at the Capitol Visitor Center. The 1857 plaster cast of the Statue of Freedom is in the center flanked by stairs which lead to the Capitol itself. Emancipation Hall is the main hall of the CVC and measures in at . It was originally designated the Great Hall, but this was changed to Emancipation Hall when a bill cosponsored by Congressman Zach Wamp and Jesse L. Jackson, Jr. was passed by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in January 2008. Emancipation Hall contains two large skylights, which each measure by and allow for a view of the Capitol dome never before seen. The skylights allow a significant amount of natural light into the hall and are surrounded by pools of water and seating on the roof deck. The Hall displays the original 1857 plaster cast of the Statue of Freedom, the bronze statue that stands atop the Capitol dome. It was moved to the Hall from the basement rotunda of the Russell Senate Office Building, across Constitution Avenue from the Capitol, where it had stood since January, 1993. The Hall also displays 24 statues of the National Statuary Hall Collection. The complete collection is made up of two statues from each state. The statues are donated by their respective state to honor notable residents. In the past years, all 100 statues have been housed in the Capitol, many in Statuary Hall. This has led to overcrowding of statues and relocating some of them to Emancipation Hall has allowed for some space to be reclaimed. According to the Acting Architect of the Capitol Steven T. Ayers, more- recently added statues have been given preference for a move to Emancipation Hall. On April 28, 2009, a bust of Sojourner Truth was dedicated in Emancipation Hall. =Exhibition Hall= Exhibition Hall section centering on 1945‚Äìpresent The Exhibition Hall includes an high tactile polyurethane model of the Capitol dome. The hall is dominated by a pair of curving marble walls lined with artifacts and interactive touch-screen displays. Included in the collection are documents signed by George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Six scale models of the complete Capitol illustrate how the building expanded over time. Two alcoves off the main Exhibition Hall hold large flat screen televisions to allow viewers to watch live telecasts of the House and Senate floor proceedings. A third alcove located behind the tactile dome model on the main axis of the Capitol holds the Lincoln catafalque, which used to be displayed in the basement beneath the crypt. It closed in March 2019 to undergo renovations and is expected to reopen in 2021. =Other facilities and spaces= Two theaters located above the Exhibition Hall continuously show a 13-minute video on the history of Congress and the Capitol Complex. Visitors enter the theaters at the Emancipation Hall (lower) level and exit at the staging (upper) level. The theaters will show the same film, but on a staggered schedule to allow a smooth flow of tourists into the Capitol. Off of Emancipation Hall are two gift shops, one at the north end of the Hall and on at the south end. These replace the single gift shop previously located in the Capitol Crypt. The CVC includes a 530-seat food court, which is expected to alleviate overcrowding in the cafeterias in the Congressional office buildings. Congressional space About has been reserved for use by Congress. Much of the space is for a new Congressional Auditorium. Most of the rest of the space will be made into committee meeting rooms. Service space A number of tunnels were constructed as part of the CVC project. The first is a long truck service tunnel, whose entrance is located north of Constitution Avenue near the underground Senate parking garage. Its goal is to alleviate traffic on the plaza and to enhance security by checking delivery and service trucks at a safe distance from the Capitol itself. A second tunnel was constructed to connect the CVC to the Library of Congress. Part of East Capitol Street was closed during construction and the tunnel was completed in the winter of 2005. Criticism =Costs= The high cost of building the Capitol Visitor Center has been an ongoing source of controversy for the project. Time magazine projected the total cost to be nearly $600 million.\\"A Costly Welcome for Capitol Visitors\\" Times Article, Accessed 4/6/11, Posted 5/12/10 Critics cited its three auditoriums, the largest cafeteria in Washington, and a tunnel that links the Capitol Visitor Center to the Library of Congress as a symbol of federal and Congressional overspending. =Religious criticism= In addition to the controversy attendant upon the repeated delays and cost overruns, Republicans have criticized the center for what they view as insufficient coverage of American religious heritage. Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina said that the CVC fails to \\"appropriately honor our religious heritage that has been critical to America's success.\\" Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich started a petition seeking to more prominently recognize religion at the Center. At the time of its construction, the CVC had a plaque which declared the national motto to be \\"E Pluribus Unum,\\" a traditionally used motto, but not the official United States motto. It has since been changed to the official motto, \\"In God We Trust.\\" Some of these controversies were briefly addressed by Beth Plemmons, Chief Executive Officer for Visitor Services at the Capitol Visitor Center, during her testimony on May 16, 2018, at a hearing before the Committee on House Administration, U.S. House of Representatives.

Abandoned by his parents as a baby, Libertad was a child of the Public Assistance in Bordeaux. As a result of a childhood illness, he lost the use of his legs,\\"Libertad (1875‚Äì1908)\\" at marxists.org but put his handicap to good use, using his crutches as weapons against the police. He moved to Paris at 21, where he soon became active in anarchist circles, going so far as to live in the offices of the journal ‚ÄúLe Libertaire.‚Äù A member of various anarchist groups, and a supporter of ‚Äúpropaganda by the deed,‚Äù he was nevertheless an abstentionist candidate in Paris‚Äôs 11th arrondissement in 1902 and 1904, seeing his candidacy as a means of spreading anarchist ideas. During the Dreyfus affair, he founded the Anti-Militarist League (1902) \\"and, along with Paraf-Javal, founded the ‚ÄúCauseries populaires‚Äù, public discussions that met with great interest throughout the country, contributing to the opening of a bookstore and various clubs in different quarters of Paris\\". In 1905, Libertad founded what was probably the most important individualist anarchist journal, L‚ÄôAnarchie, which included among its collaborators Andr√© Lorulot, Emile Armand, and Victor Serge and his companion Rirette Maitrejean. The French theorist of the Situationist International Raoul Vaneigem reports that Libertad gained notoriety for a call to action in which he \\"invited citizens to burn their ID papers and to become humans again, refusing to let themselves be reduced to a number, duly filed in the statistic state inventories of slaves.\\"http://www.noborderbxl.eu.org/spip.php?article282‚ü®=fr \\"No borders no papers\\" by Raoul Vaneigem He also worked as corrector with Aristide Briand, editing the review, La Lanterne, and then with S√©bastien Faure. An activist of the free love, Libertad wrote in EnDehors, a famous newspaper founded by Zo d'Axa.  Anarchism  On the occasion of the July 14 anniversary, L‚ÄôAnarchie \\"printed and distributed the manifesto ‚ÄúThe Bastille of Authority‚Äù in one hundred thousand copies. Along with feverish activity against the social order, Libertad was usually also organizing feasts, dances and country excursions, in consequence of his vision of anarchism as the ‚Äújoy of living‚Äù and not as militant sacrifice and death instinct, seeking to reconcile the requirements of the individual (in his need for autonomy) with the need to destroy authoritarian society. In fact, Libertad overcame the false dichotomy between individual revolt and social revolution, stressing that the first is simply a moment of the second, certainly not its negation. Revolt can only be born from the specific tension of the individual, which, in expanding itself, can only lead to a project of social liberation. For Libertad, anarchism doesn't consist in living separated from any social context in some cold ivory tower or on some happy communitarian isle, nor in living in submission to social roles, putting off the moment when one puts one's ideas into practice to the bitter end, but in living as anarchists here and now, without any concessions, in the only way possible: by rebelling. And this is why, in this perspective, individual revolt and social revolution no longer exclude each other, but rather complement each other.\\"  See also  *Individualist anarchism in Europe Notes * Albert Libertad, Le Culte de la charogne.

The sale saw objections from a majority of Americans, prominent US Senators, the State of Israel and the Israel lobby.The Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI) - Saudi Rattles Its Saber The sale included five E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft and eight KE-3 refueling aircraft, with spare parts and support, delivered between June 1986 and September 1987.Saudi E-3 AWACS, Boeing  AWACS  USAF E-3 Sentry in flight The United States Air Force began using the E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft in 1977 following ten years of prototype design, development, and testing.Boeing, \\"AWACS History\\"; available at http://www.boeing.com/defensespace/ic/awacs/e3svcww/history.html; accessed 5 November 2005.

The E-3 is a modified Boeing 707 commercial jetliner characterized by the strikingly large thirty-foot rotating antenna mounted on its roof. This antenna can detect and track other aircraft within an area of , flying at any altitude or over any terrain, allowing the AWACS to detect aircraft that remain hidden from ground radar.Boston Globe 9/22/81 The planes' mobility is a crucial feature, providing for the use of this sophisticated detection equipment whenever and wherever needed; AWACS can be deployed quickly into military conflict \\"regardless of intensity\\" according to Boeing, who claims AWACS are the \\"world‚Äôs standard for airborne early warning systems.\\"Boeing, \\"AWACS Overview\\"; available at http://www.boeing.com/defensespace/ic/awacs/e3svcww/e3overview.html; accessed 5 November 2005. The Saudi AWACS bear Arabic writing on their exterior with a translation below, \\"Royal Saudi Air Force\\". The roof-mounted antenna is an AWACS plane‚Äôs dominant feature; it is a smooth black disk with a white stripe down the center, and it rotates constantly. The antenna is about a fifth of the length of the plane and it sits higher above the roof than the plane‚Äôs roof sits above the ground. Another noticeable difference from a commercial 707 is the lack of passenger windows. Colonel Walt Kowalik said about the lack of windows, \\"We don't want 'em ... we don't want our people looking out of windows. We want them concentrating on what's in front of them.\\" An Associated Press writer described blue carpet and \\"subdued\\" lighting, \\"as in a movie theatre.\\"  Reaction in the United States  Only months old, the Reagan Administration announced its plans to sell five of the U.S.-made AWACS to Saudi Arabia. The proposal, part of the largest foreign arms sale ever,Boston Globe 10/29/81 was not received warmly on Capitol Hill where Congressional consent was required. The AWACS proposal was also harshly rejected by Israel and disapproved of by a majority of Americans. Upon formal introduction of the AWACS proposal to Congress in the fall of 1981, many Senators reacted coldly. \\"This is one of the worst and most dangerous arms sales ever,\\" proclaimed Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy. Senator Donald Riegle said, \\"We are being asked to submit to a kind of blackmail; the price gouging of oil.\\"Boston Globe 9/18/81 These Senators feared that the AWACS sale was not designed to promote stability, as would be claimed by the Administration, but to secure U.S. oil resources. Such a deal would mean technology for oil access, and as Kennedy said, a potentially dangerous deal at that. Senator Bob Packwood, who as a Republican was a member of Reagan‚Äôs party, was also a leader of opposition to the AWACS deal in the Senate. Packwood spelled out the danger he saw in arming Saudi Arabia: \\"They have displayed a hostility that must be interpreted as their deliberate intentions to promote continued instability in the Middle East.\\" Packwood questioned the choice of Saudi Arabia as an arbiter of peace saying, \\"Let‚Äôs think about which nations have been seriously committed to negotiating peace in the Middle East and which have not shared that commitment.\\"Boston Globe 6/21/84 With the recently ended American hostage crisis in Iran fresh in mind, Americans were reluctant to sell military equipment to anyone. In fact, a May 1981 poll showed that 52% of those surveyed opposed arms sales to any country, and only 19% wanted the U.S. to sell AWACS to Saudi Arabia.Boston Globe 5/26/81  Considering Israel  Israel, feeling its security directly threatened, was the most strongly opposed to the AWACS deal of anyone involved. Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin expressed \\"profound regret and unreserved opposition\\" to the Saudi AWACS proposal.Boston Globe 4/22/81 Experts on Israeli defense said that AWACS could track every move of the Israel‚Äôs air force, denying it the chance to launch a \\"surprise first strike, the basis of Israeli defense doctrine.\\" While Israel's \\"unreserved opposition\\" was based on the real security threat it faced, its \\"profound regret\\" could have been rooted in perceived betrayal by the United States. A protector of Israel since the Six-Day War, the U.S. was planning to sell military surveillance planes to Saudi Arabia, a country hostile towards Israel. A Boston Globe editorial from May 4, 1981 recognized this contradiction as well as other threats posed by the AWACS sale, noting, \\"the intention to sell AWACS planes to Saudi Arabia constitutes not only a manifest contradiction of Reagan's campaign promise to enhance Israel's security, but also serves to further destabilize the Mideast, a region whose stability was supposed to be a strategic priority of the Reagan foreign policy.\\" The sensitivity of Congress to the threats against peace and stability, was matched by its sensitivity to Israel's concerns. The Reagan Administration actively sought to diminish Israel's voice and influence over the deal. In public speeches, Administration officials admonished Israel for getting involved in a U.S. foreign policy matter. Secretary of State Alexander Haig said the President must be \\"free of the restraints of overriding external vetoes,\\" and went on to say that were the AWACS deal blocked by Israeli influence, there would be \\"serious implications on all American policies in the Middle East. ... I'll just leave it there.\\" Reagan himself declared, \\"It is not the business of other nations to make American foreign policy.\\"Boston Globe 10/1/81  Winning support  In order to gain support for the AWACS deal in Congress and in the country, the Administration lobbied strongly on behalf of it. Though it continually stated the AWACS deal would benefit US \\"interests\\" in the Middle East, the Administration also gave promises of the AWACS planes' importance in securing peace. In a speech to Congress, Alexander Haig said that if the AWACS sale was blocked, \\"our security, the security of Israel and peace itself (might) be endangered,\\"Boston Globe 9/17/81 Reagan himself promoted the AWACS sale saying, \\"By contributing to the stability of the area, it improves Israeli security.\\" The Administration even commissioned former government officials to speak about AWACS as part of the peace cause. Richard Nixon's Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said \\"it is essential for the peace process in the Middle East.\\"ABC News, World News Tonight, October 1981, in Lexus-Nexus. Congress approved the AWACS sale, and as part of the then-largest arms export ever, the planes were a symbolic commitment to the US/Saudi relationship.  US arms sale to Saudi Arabia, 2010  On October 20, 2010, the US State Department notified Congress of its intention to make the biggest arms sale in American history‚Äîan estimated $60.5 billion purchase by Saudi Arabia, trumping the former US-Saudi AWACS sale. The package represents a considerable improvement in the offensive capability of the Saudi armed forces. Israel did not raise objections to the sale, except to say that it was \\"not thrilled about it.\\" At the time, a senior administration official stressed: \\"This is a big development, because it's part of a larger regional strategy and the maintenance of a strong US presence in the region. We're paying attention to the needs of our allies and what everyone in the region believes is a flexing of muscles by a more aggressive Iran. One way to deal with that is to make our allies and friends strong.\\"Joshua Teitelbaum, Arms for the King and His Family: The U.S. Arms Sale to Saudi Arabia, Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Vol. 10, No. 11, 4 November 2010.

It is endemic to the southern United States. Geographic range C. c. etheridgei is found in Louisiana and Texas. Etymology The subspecific name or epithet, etheridgei, is in honor of the American zoologist and paleontologist Richard Emmett Etheridge.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Coluber constrictor etheridgei, p. 86). Description The tan racer, as its name implies, is typically a solid tan in color. Juveniles have a pattern of dark brown dorsal blotches, which fade to solid tan at about a year of age. The underside is typically gray or white, sometimes with yellow spotting. It typically grows from .75 ‚Äì 1.5 m (30 to 60 inches) in total length (including tail). It has large eyes, with round pupils, and excellent vision. Behavior Like all racers, the tan racer is diurnal and highly active. Its diet consists of a wide variety of prey, but primarily includes rodents, and lizards. It is fast moving, and generally seeks to use its speed to escape if approached. Habitat The tan racer prefers habitats of pine flatwoods. Reproduction Mating occurs in the spring, and a clutch of approximately 30 eggs is laid typically in the month of May, to hatch mid summer.

The New Caledonian owlet-nightjar is endemic to New Caledonia‚Äôs Melaleuca savanna and humid forests. Other owlet-nightjars are solitary, nest in holes in trees, and forage from a perch, both sallying out to catch flying insects and descending onto prey on the ground or on trunks and branches. It is unknown if these habits apply to the New Caledonian owlet-nightjar, but this species is larger and has longer legs than the others, so it may be more terrestrial. The type specimen was collected after the bird flew into a bedroom in the village of Tonghou√©. This large owlet-nightjar is only known from two specimens taken in 1880 and 1915 and a small handful of sightings. The most recent report is from a 1998 expedition which saw a large nightjar-like bird foraging for insects at dusk in Rivi√®re Ni Valley. That report has been taken to suggest that the species may still survive in small numbers, but that total population is likely smaller than 50 individuals and declining.

Although Weston \\"was born into the tradition of craftsman- produced black-and-white art photography, he was to find his own photographic direction in colour.\\". Cole Weston's life followed a diverse course that started with theater, later leading him to the Navy, a position photographing for Life, and later photographing portraits, before he moved to Carmel, California in 1946, at his father's request. In the years that followed, Cole became his father's assistant and trusted companion; and, as Edward's struggle with Parkinson's disease worsened, Cole became the keeper of two careers, his father's and his own.

He served as the governor (wazir-e-wazarat) of Kishtwar and extended the territories of the kingdom by conquering Ladakh and Baltistan. He also boldly attempted the conquest of West Tibet (Ngari Khorsum) but was killed in battle. In reference to his legacy of conquests in the Himalaya Mountains including Ladakh, Tibet, Baltistan and Iskardu as General and Wazir, Zorowar Singh has been referred to as the \\"Napoleon of India\\", and \\"Conqueror of Ladakh\\". Early life and career He was born in September 1784 in a Hindu Kahluria Rajput family in the princely state of Kahlur (Bilaspur) state, in present-day Himachal Pradesh. His family migrated to the Jammu region where, on coming of age, Zorawar took up service under Raja Jaswant Singh of Marmathi (modern Doda district). Zorawar Singh was employed by the ambitious Raja Gulab Singh of Jammu and was placed under the commandant of the Reasi fort (Bhimgarh fort). While delivering a routine message to the Gulab Singh, Zorawar told him of the financial waste occurring in the fort administration and boldly presented his own scheme to effect savings. Gulab Singh was impressed by Zorawar's sincerity and appointed him commandant of Reasi. Zorawar Singh fulfilled his task and his grateful ruler made him commissariat officer of all forts north of Jammu. He was later made governor of Kishtwar and was given the title of Wazir (minister). Even though it was a newly conquered region Zorawar had no trouble in keeping the peace; many of the local Rajputs were recruited into his army. In 1835 the nearby region of Paddar was taken from Chamba (now in Himachal Pradesh) in the course of a battle. Paddar later became known for its sapphire mines. But this was a mere sideshow to General Zorawar Singh's more famous expeditions, on which he had already embarked in the previous year. The Ladakh campaigns Zorawar fort in Ladakh To the east of Kishtwar and Kashmir are the snow-clad mountains of the upper Himalayas ‚Äî the rivers of Zanskar Gorge, Suru River, and Drass rise from these snows, and flow across the plateau of Ladakh into the Indus River. Several petty principalities in this region were tributary to the Gyalpo (King) of Ladakh. In 1834 one of these, the Raja of Timbus, sought Zorawar's help against the Gyalpo. Meanwhile, the Rajput general had been burning to distinguish himself by expanding the territory of Raja Gulab Singh ‚Äî also at that time, according to the Gulabnama, Kishtwar went through a drought that caused a loss of revenue and forced Zorawar to extract money through war. The Rajputs of Jammu and Himachal have traditionally excelled in mountain fighting; therefore Zorawar had no trouble in crossing the mountain ranges and entering Ladakh through the source of the Suru River where his 5000 men defeated an army of local Botis. After moving to Kargil and subduing the landlords along the way Zorawar received the submission of the Ladakhis ‚Äî however Tsepal Namgyal, the Gyalpo (ruler), sent his general Banko Kahlon by a roundabout route to cut off Zorawar's communications. The astute general doubled back to Kartse, where he sheltered his troops through the winter. In the spring of 1835 he defeated the large Ladakhi army of Banko Kahlon and marched his victorious troops towards Leh. The Gyalpo now agreed to pay 50,000 rupees as war-indemnity and 20,000 rupees as an annual tribute. Alarmed at the gains of the Dogras, the governor of Kashmir, Mehan Singh, incited the Ladakhi chieftains to rebel but Zorawar quickly marched back to the Himalayan valleys and subdued the rebels, now forcing the Raja of Zanskar to also pay a separate tribute to Jammu. But in 1836 Mehan Singh, who was in correspondence with the Lahore durbar, this time instigated the Gyalpo to revolt ‚Äî Zorawar force- marched his army in ten days to surprise the Ladakhis and forced them to submit. He now built a fort outside Leh and placed there a garrison of 300 men under Dalel Singh ‚Äî the Gyalpo was deposed to an estate and a Ladakhi general, Ngorub Stanzin, was made King. But the latter did not prove to be loyal hence the Gyalpo was restored to his throne in 1838. ''' Baltistan campaign To the northwest of Ladakh, and to the north of Kashmir, lies the region of Baltistan. Muhammad Shah, the son of the ruler of Skardu, Raja Ahmad Shah, fled to Leh and sought the aid of the Gyalpo and Zorawar against his father. But some of the Ladakhi nobles allowed Ahmad Shah to imprison his son and sought his aid in a general rebellion against the Dogras. After defeating the Ladakhi rebels Zorawar invaded Baltistan in the winter of 1839/40 (Petech, Kingdom of ladakh, p. 144, Datta, Ladakh, p. 122 etc. etc.), adding a large contingent of Ladakhis to his army. The advance brigade of 5,000 under Nidhan Singh lost its way in the cold and snow and was surrounded by the enemy; many soldiers perished from the cold. Then Mehta Basti Ram, a prominent Rajput from Kishtwar, established contact with the main force. On their arrival the Botis of Skardu were defeated and forced to flee. They were chased to the fort of Skardu which was invested by Zorawar for a few days. One night the Dogras scaled the steep mountain behind the fort and after some fighting captured the small fort on its crest. From this position the next day they began firing down at the main fort and forced the Raja to surrender. Zorawar built a fort on the banks of the Indus where he placed a contingent of his soldiers. After placing Muhammad Shah on the throne for an annual tribute of 7000 rupees, a Dogra contingent under Wazir Lakhpat advanced westwards, conquered the fort of Astor and took its Darad Raja prisoner. However this Raja was tributary to Mehan Singh, the governor of Kashmir, who was alarmed at the Dogra conquests since they only expanded the kingdom of Gulab Singh while not bringing any benefit to the Lahore durbar. His complaint at Lahore was forwarded to Raja Gulab Singh at Jammu and he ordered the Darad Raja to be released. Tibet expedition Zorawar Singh turned his energies eastward, towards Tibet. In May, 1841, Zorawar Singh with 6000 most of whom were Hindu Dogras, marched into Ladakh,Samir Bhattacharya the troops then invaded Tibet. One column under the Ladakhi prince, Nono Sungnam, followed the course of the Indus River to its source. Another column of 300 men, under Ghulam Khan, marched along the mountains leading up to the Kailas Range and thus south of the Indus. Zorawar himself led 3,000 men along the plateau region where the vast and picturesque Pangong Lake is located. Sweeping all resistance before them, the three columns passed the Lake Manasarovar and converged at Gartok, defeating the small Tibetan force stationed there. The enemy commander fled to Taklakot but Zorawar stormed that fort on 6 September 1841. Envoys from Tibet now came to him as did agents of the Maharaja of Nepal, whose kingdom was only fifteen miles from Taklakot. The fall of Taklakot finds mention in the report of the Chinese Imperial Resident, Meng Pao, at Lhasa:Perspectives on South Asian Security by Shanthie Mariey D'Souza, Rajsthree Jetly > On my arrival at Taklakot a force of only about 1,000 local troops could be > mustered, which was divided and stationed as guards at different posts.

Reinforcements are essential in order to > withstand these violent and unruly invaders. Zorawar and his men now went on pilgrimage to Mansarovar and Mount Kailash. He had extended his communication and supply line over 450 miles of inhospitable terrain by building small forts and pickets along the way. The fort Chi-T‚Äôang was built near Taklakot, where Mehta Basti Ram was put in command of 500 men, with 8 or 9 cannon. With the onset of winter all the passes were blocked and roads snowed in. The supplies for the Dogra army over such a long distance failed despite Zorawar's meticulous preparations. As the intense cold, coupled with the rain, snow and lightning continued for weeks upon weeks, many of the soldiers lost their fingers and toes to frostbite. Others starved to death, while some burnt the wooden stock of their muskets to warm themselves. The Tibetans and their Chinese allies regrouped and advanced to give battle, bypassing the Dogra fort of Chi-T‚Äôang. Zorawar and his men met them at the Battle of To-yo on 12 December 1841‚Äî-in the early exchange of fire the Rajput general was wounded in his right shoulder but he grabbed a sword in his left hand. The Tibetan horsemen then charged the Dogra position and one of them thrust his lance in Zorawar Singh's chest.

Estimate Zorawar Singh's great military endeavors were balanced by a life of modesty and restraint. He was so honest that he would transfer to his master any gifts or tribute that came to him. This honest general did not leave behind either vast properties or deep coffers for his descendants -‚Äî only a legacy of military achievement that caused the western writers of that time to call him the \\"Napoleon of India\\".

Together with the pianist Leonid Nesvishsky (Arie Abilea), the singer Joseph Tomars, the composer Lazare Saminsky, and several other musicians Rosowsky organized the Society for Jewish Folk Music in 1908.

After a five-year stay, he left for Palestine, where at that time he at first was one of the few professional musicians. The folk music of Palestinian Jews became a major new inspiration for his compositions. Despite the enthusiastic work of the pioneers, the material living conditions in Palestine at that time were still extremely arduous. And for an artist who was used to the rich musical life of St. Petersburg, the land had little to offer in those early days except for a few amateur orchestras and two music schools.

The Basilica of Saint-Remi, adjacent to it and consecrated in 1049, was its abbey church, and both buildings have been listed as part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991. Building left The obscureCatholic Encyclopedia, 1911, s.v. \\"Abbey of Saint Remy\\" origins of the great abbey at Reims lie in a little 6th-century chapel dedicated to Saint Christopher. The abbey's success was founded on its acquisition of the relics of St. Remy in 553; subsequently gifts poured in upon it from pious donors. By the 9th century the abbey possessed about 700 domains and was perhaps the most richly endowed in France. It seems probable that secular priests were the first guardians of the relics, but were succeeded by the Benedictines. From 780 to 945 the archbishops of Reims served as its abbots. At the abbey Charlemagne received Pope Leo III. In 1005 the abbot Aviard undertook to rebuild the church of St-Remy, and for twenty years the work went on uninterruptedly before vaulting collapsed, no doubt from insufficient buttressing. Abbot Theodoric erected the magnificent surviving basilica which Pope Leo IX dedicated in 1049 and to which he granted many privileges. The abbey library and its schools were of such high repute that Pope Alexander III wrote a commendatory letter to the Abbot Peter, which survives. The years of around 1170 to 1180 brought further rebuilding, this time to the choir. The purpose of replacing the short eastern section of the Romanesque church was to create a grander and more spacious interior for the shrine of St Remy. The shrine was detached from its previous location, next to the altar, and moved further east.Wilson 2008, p.60, 62 Among the illustrious later abbots, all drawn from the higher nobility, may be mentioned: Henri de Lorraine (1622‚Äì1641), who affiliated the abbey to the Congregation of St. Maur; Jacques-Nicolas Colbert (1665), later archbishop of Rouen; Charles Maurice Le Tellier (1680‚Äì1710); and Joseph de Rochechouart, appointed abbot by the king in 1745. Many valuable objects from the abbey were looted in the French Revolutionary period and the Holy Ampulla of the coronation of the kings of France kept in the abbey was destroyed in 1793, but the 12th-century stained glass remains. The Abbey of Saint-Remi, together with the nearby cathedral of Notre-Dame de Reims and Palace of Tau, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1991. Collections left The museum contains tapestries from the 16th century donated by the archbishop Robert de Lenoncourt (uncle of the cardinal of the same name), marble capitals from the fourth century AD, furniture, jewellery, pottery, weapons and glasswork from the sixth to eighth centuries, medieval sculpture, the fa√ßade of the 13th-century musicians' House, remnants from an earlier abbey building, and also exhibits of Gallo-Roman arts and crafts and a room of pottery, jewellery and weapons from Gallic civilization, as well as an exhibit of items from the Palaeolithic to the Neolithic periods. Another section of the museum features a permanent military exhibition. Notes  References  * Wilson, C (2008). The Gothic Cathedral, Thames & Hudson.

Gaultois had a population of 136 people as of 2016. The town has a K-12 school called Victoria Academy, as well as a fire department, public library, Lion's Club, and town hall. The town is only accessible by ferry or helicopter. The ferry runs from the nearby town of Hermitage several times daily and the crossing takes approximately 20 minutes. This ferry also services the more remote community of McCallum once to twice daily with a crossing time of around one hour and fifteen minutes. Before confederation with Canada in 1949, Gaultois was the customs town for those wishing to travel to the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon. Prior to resettlement, the population had declined to 107 in 1956 from a peak of 252 five years earlier. After resettlement in 1966 Gaultois population rose to 594 with the fish plant and its draggers as the main employer of the town. The first Waymaster in 1877, was Richard Bradshaw. A fishing community, Gaultois went into a decline when the Lake Group first announced the closure of its fish plant in 1981 and again in 1990 when Fishery Products International closed the plant permanently. As of 2017, the population has plunged by 80 percent since the 1990s. Though small, Gaultois has four distinct areas: #The Room near the wharf where, traditionally salt fish was dried for market, on flakes. #The Valley up the hill a little then surrounded by high rock faces, home to about 10 homes. #The Point across the harbour from the rooms. The most populated part of town. The point and the rooms are joined by a wooden boardwalk at the base of the rock face. #The Bottom up the hill and down the other side from the point. The most isolated part of town.

The show centers on a young boy named Salty, as he plays and learns with his friends in a magical lighthouse. As well as the animated adventures of Salty and his friends, the series uses live-action footage from the British children's television series Tugs for various segments. 40 episodes were produced in the series. It ran from October 3, 1997, to June 26, 1998, on PBS and TLC and later on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom, MBC 3 in the Middle East, Fox Kids in Australia, Bahrain TV Channel 55 in Bahrain, SABC2 in South Africa, TV3 in Ireland, TVN in Poland, TV Cultura in Brazil, the Arutz HaYeladim in Israel, TeleAsturias in Spain, BFBS (which is seen in several countries such as Germany, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Belize, and Bosnia), CBC Television and SCN in Canada, Playhouse Disney in Taiwan and UBC Kids in Thailand, in addition, also airing on CVM Television in Jamaica. Overview Salty is a young boy who loves using his imagination. Every day, he goes to the lighthouse near his home to play with his seaside friends: Ocho, the octopus; Claude, the hermit crab; Sophie and Sadie, the bird twins; a group of tiny clams; Aurora, the light that shines over the ocean; and lighthouse owner Aunt Chovie. Through their adventures in each episode, they learn moral lessons that help them overcome their problems. Tied into each story are other segments, told through live- action footage: * Through the eyes of Seymour (a walking pair of binoculars), the characters look out beyond the lighthouse to see what the tugboats in the harbour are doing. Their stories relate to the situations of the main characters. The tugboat footage is composed of live model animation, taken from the British television series Tugs (see below for more information). * Some episodes include a segment called 'Salty's Song Time' introduced by the lighthouse clock. These consist of original songs, which relate the moral of the episode. The songs are set to an arrangement of footage, mainly from stock libraries and silent films including Charlie Chaplin, Commando Cody & specially added animation for some scenes in the songs.

As of 2012, episodes are available online on Kidobi, a video streaming site for preschool content.http://www.kidobi.com/videos-for-kids/Mixed-Signals-Too-Young-To-Be- Included/57246946-10b5-4de5-bd3e-783830ef20dc Comparisons with Tugs The segments featuring the tugboats in the harbour used footage from the British television series Tugs, a series produced in 1989 by Robert D. Cardona and David Mitton, who (along with Britt Allcroft) produced the popular series Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends. Whilst Allcroft drove the Thomas series to popularity among American audiences (through the PBS series Shining Time Station), Tugs did not spread far beyond its country of origin, lasting one season of 13 episodes (although it was aired and merchandised in the Japanese and Australian markets). As a result of this, Sunbow saw fit to use the series' animation as a part of Salty's Lighthouse, licensing the use of the footage from Cardona: however, they repurposed the footage drastically to suit the needs of Salty's Lighthouse - a show intended for the preschool American market. (Cardona was not involved in the show's production; however, he was credited as the creator of the model footage.) The original episodes of Tugs centered on two rival fleets of tugboats, working in 'Bigg City Port' during the 1920s, with its plotlines involving action and drama intended for an older audience of children. Due to the difference in the intended demographic, the original plotlines (as well as the premise of rival tug fleets) were not used. Instead, the producers of Salty's Lighthouse wrote entirely new stories of the boats in 'Snugboat Harbor', relating to the theme of the main animated segment, with footage from the series edited and redubbed to tell these stories. (This creates an interesting comparison to the Thomas segments of Shining Time Station; as Britt Allcroft intended to introduce Thomas to the United States through that series, so the UK terms used in that series, i.e. trucks, were modified to reflect the American terms, but the episodes were still faithful to their source. In the case of Salty's Lighthouse, the show was completely repurposed for a new market, instead of attempting to create a faithful 'equivalent' of Tugs.) Along with the newly created stories, various changes were made to the characters featured in them. The characters of Sunshine, Captain Star (the narrator), and Little Ditcher were made female, presumably to appeal to a wider audience of children. (Sunshine was referred to in some episodes as fellow switcher Ten Cents' sister.) The American accents of the new voiceover replaced a range of British accents from the original characters (for example, the Glaswegian Scottish of Big Mac, or the Cockney accents of Ten Cents and Zorran). Some character names were also changed, usually to avoid confusion with others of the same name: Of the main characters, Big Mac became 'Big Stack' (possibly to avoid legal trouble from McDonald's over the name of their famous sandwich).; O.J. became 'Otis' (possibly to avoid confusion with O. J. Simpson or the fact that O.J. can stand for orange juice).; while Zebedee became 'Zeebee' (his original nameplate is left uncensored which indicates his name may have been consistently mispronounced). Izzy Gomez had an American accent instead of a Mexican one, despite having the sombrero. The Fultan Ferry was given a voice (despite not having a visible face or megaphone), and was confirmed as a male character. He also went under the name 'Fultan' by Grampus. Excluding the human characters, most of the faceless characters (such as Little Ditcher, Scuttle Butt Pete, and Puffa) don't speak through their visible megaphones (with the exception of Tramper (Nantucket) in \\"Salty Come Lately\\" and Puffa spoke once in \\"Colossal Crab\\"). Many supporting and incidental characters were also repurposed, to fit particular Salty's Lighthouse stories: *Johnny Cuba, a smuggler, was written as 'Steamer', a friendly character. *Sea Rogue was used as a villain, stealing cargo. *Two different characters, Coast Guard and the Coast Guard's Messenger, were merged into a single character named 'Cappy'. *Puffa became The Train\\" or \\"Chooch\\". *Jack the Grappler became 'Scoop'. *The scrap dealers, Burke and Blair, became movie producers named 'Mr. Boffo' and 'Mr. Socko'. *Nantucket went under the name 'Tramper', and also became a friendly character. Sometimes he appeared in speaking parts, and sometimes only communicated through a foghorn. *The Quarry Master gained the name 'Stoney'. Some of the other characters (such as the Fire Tug, Big Mickey, Mighty Mo, Pearl, the Shrimpers, and the Buoys) do make several appearances, but don't have any dialogue whilst some such as Sea Rogue's Uncle and the Pirates (a.k.a. The Green-Eyed Things) never made any appearances (although Sea Rogue's Uncle did appear as a cameo in the episode \\"Who Took My Crayons?\\", and one of the Pirates was shown in the place of Sea Rogue when he covered Lillie Lightship and a bell buoy with a blanket in the episode \\"Dream On\\").

It can attain a body length of 39‚Äì45 cm, a tail length of 51‚Äì65 cm- a total length of 90‚Äì100 cm, and a weight of 1.8-1.9 kg. Being a primate, it has strong hands with palms like a human, which have a rubbery texture to give it a firm grip on branches. Its tail is longer than its body and is non-prehensile. Like many of the species in the genus Eulemur, the blue-eyed black lemur is sexually dichromatic. Males are solid black in color, with the hairs sometimes tinged brown at the roots. Females are reddish-brown in color with their underside and outline of their face a lighter tan. They have a dark brown or gray muzzle and the back of their hands and feet are a similar dark color. Both sexes have blue eyes, hence the common name, and are one of the only primates other than humans to consistently have blue eyes. The eyes can range in color from a shocking electric blue, a light sky-blue, or a softer gray-blue. Although the blue-eyed black lemur and the black lemur look similar, they can be differentiated by the blue eyes and lack of prominent ear tufts of this species, while the black lemur has orange-red eyes and long, spiky cheek hairs. In the Manongarivo Special reserve, where the range of the two species overlap, there is a report of hybridization between the two species, but the resulting offspring always have orange eyes. Until 2008, the blue-eyed black lemur was considered a subspecies, E. macaco flavifrons, of the black lemur.  Behavior  This true lemur has not been studied intensively in the wild, but it is known to be fairly social. Group sizes vary from four to eleven individuals on average. Females are dominant as in most lemur species, and there are usually more males than females in each social group. The blue-eyed black lemur is thought to be polygynous. Females give birth to one or two offspring in June or July, after a gestation of 120 to 129 days. The young are weaned after about 5‚Äì6 months, and reach maturity at about 2 years of age. It may live between 15‚Äì30 years in captivity, with little data recorded on their longevity in the wild. It demonstrates a cathemeral activity pattern, being awake sporadically throughout the day. The occasional nighttime activities are thought to be based on the intensity of the moonlight. The blue-eyed black lemur communicates with scent-marking, vocalizations, and perhaps some facial expressions. Scent marking is an important means of communication as with most lemur species. Both genders will mark on trees with anogenital glands, while males will also mark using wrist and palm glands by rubbing and twisting them against leaves, twigs or branches. Males also use a scent gland on the top of their head to mark, lowering their head and rubbing in quick sliding motions.Duke Lemur Center Little is known of its vocalizations, but it has been observed making a variety of grunts, chirps, barks and clicks. The males are known to make a sharp 'scree' when distressed. The blue-eyed black lemur has also been observed to be a highly aggressive species. There is frequent infighting between troop members, especially during the breeding and birthing seasons. In captivity it has been observed committing infanticide against other species of lemurs, a behavior that is usually uncommon, especially in captivity. = Diet = Reddish-brown-haired female Fruit, pollen, and nectar make up the bulk of this lemur's diet. During the dry season when food is scarce it may eat leaves, seeds and berries and rarely insects. It may also raid farmlands and eat some of the crops, which may lead to it being shot by farmers. The blue- eyed black lemur helps propagate many rain forest plants. Since it digests the flesh but not the seeds of the fruits it eats, it spreads the seeds of more than 50 different plant species (deposited in a fresh pile of fertilizer), and some plants may have evolved specifically to be dispersed by this lemur. The blue-eyed black lemur also pollinates many plants while it eats nectar and pollen from the plants' flowers.  Habitat  The blue-eyed black lemur inhabits primary and secondary sub-tropical moist and dry forests in the northwestern tip of Madagascar. Its range extends from the Andranomalaza River in the north, to the Maevarano River in the south. Some areas where it can readily be seen are in the forests south of Maromandia near Antananarivo and Antsiranana. It may also be seen in the remaining forest patches of the Sahamalaza Peninsula, such as the Ankarafa forest.  Conservation  Humans have cut down almost all of this species' habitat to clear farm land. As a result, the blue-eyed black lemur is nearly extinct in the wild. The blue-eyed black lemur is listed on Appendix I of CITES, and is critically endangered. As few as 1,000 individuals are thought to remain in the wild, largely due to slash and burn habitat destruction, as well as a mild threat from hunting problems. Consequently, this species has been named one of \\"The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates.\\"  References  True lemurs Lemur Lemur Lemur Mammals described in 1867 Species endangered by slash- and-burn ","title":"Blue-eyed black lemur"},{"id":"5719272","text":"Baruch Leib Rosowsky (, 1841 ‚Äì 1919) was a famous cantor of the Great Choral Synagogue in Riga and a composer of religious music in Riga, at the time a city in Imperial Russia.

It is closely related to semustine and is in the same family as streptozotocin. It is a highly lipid-soluble drug, thus it crosses the blood-brain barrier. This property makes it ideal for treating brain tumors, which is its primary use, although it is also used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma as a second-line option. Lomustine has a long time to nadir (the time when white blood cells reach their lowest number). Unlike carmustine, lomustine is administered orally. It is a monofunctional alkylating agent, alkylates both DNA and RNA, has the ability to cross-link DNA. As with other nitrosoureas, it may also inhibit several key enzymatic processes by carbamoylation of amino acids in proteins. Lomustine is cell-cycle nonspecific. It has also been used in veterinary practice as a treatment for mast cell tumors in dogs. Price increase In the U.S., the patent for lomustine has expired, but only one company manufactures it. In 2013, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. sold its CeeNU brand of lomustine to CordenPharma, a subsidiary of International Chemical Investors S.E., which markets it as Gleostine through NextSource Biotechnology.

The Paley graphs form an infinite family of conference graphs, which yield an infinite family of symmetric conference matrices. Paley graphs allow graph-theoretic tools to be applied to the number theory of quadratic residues, and have interesting properties that make them useful in graph theory more generally. Paley graphs are named after Raymond Paley. They are closely related to the Paley construction for constructing Hadamard matrices from quadratic residues . They were introduced as graphs independently by and . Sachs was interested in them for their self- complementarity properties, while Erd≈ës and R√©nyi studied their symmetries. Paley digraphs are directed analogs of Paley graphs that yield antisymmetric conference matrices. They were introduced by (independently of Sachs, Erd≈ës, and R√©nyi) as a way of constructing tournaments with a property previously known to be held only by random tournaments: in a Paley digraph, every small subset of vertices is dominated by some other vertex.  Definition  Let q be a prime power such that q = 1 (mod 4). That is, q should either be an arbitrary power of a Pythagorean prime (a prime congruent to 1 mod 4) or an even power of an odd non-Pythagorean prime. This choice of q implies that in the unique finite field Fq of order q, the element ‚àí1 has a square root. Now let V = Fq and let :E= \\\\left \\\\\\\\{\\\\\\\\{a,b\\\\\\\\} \\\\ : \\\\ a-b\\\\in (\\\\mathbf{F}_q^{\\\\times})^2 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. If a pair {a,b} is included in E, it is included under either ordering of its two elements. For, a ‚àí b = ‚àí(b ‚àí a), and ‚àí1 is a square, from which it follows that a ‚àí b is a square if and only if b ‚àí a is a square. By definition G = (V, E) is the Paley graph of order q.  Example  For q = 13, the field Fq is just integer arithmetic modulo 13. The numbers with square roots mod 13 are: * ¬±1 (square roots ¬±1 for +1, ¬±5 for ‚àí1) * ¬±3 (square roots ¬±4 for +3, ¬±6 for ‚àí3) * ¬±4 (square roots ¬±2 for +4, ¬±3 for ‚àí4). Thus, in the Paley graph, we form a vertex for each of the integers in the range [0,12], and connect each such integer x to six neighbors: x ¬± 1 (mod 13), x ¬± 3 (mod 13), and x ¬± 4 (mod 13).  Properties  * The Paley graphs are self-complementary: the complement of any Paley graph is isomorphic to it, e.g. via the mapping that takes a vertex x to xk (mod q), where k is any nonresidue mod q . * These graphs are strongly regular graphs with parameters ::srg \\\\left (q, \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(q-1),\\\\tfrac{1}{4}(q-5),\\\\tfrac{1}{4}(q-1) \\\\right ). :In addition, Paley graphs form an infinite family of conference graphs. * The eigenvalues of Paley graphs are \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(q-1) (with multiplicity 1) and \\\\tfrac{1}{2} (-1 \\\\pm \\\\sqrt{q}) (both with multiplicity \\\\tfrac{1}{2}(q-1)) and can be calculated using the quadratic Gauss sum or by using the theory of strongly regular graphs. * If q is prime, bounds on the isoperimetric number i(G) are: ::\\\\frac{q-\\\\sqrt{q}}{4}\\\\leq i(G) \\\\leq \\\\sqrt { \\\\left (q+\\\\sqrt{q} \\\\right ) \\\\left (\\\\frac{q-\\\\sqrt{q}}{2} \\\\right ) }. * When q is prime, its Paley graph is a Hamiltonian circulant graph. * Paley graphs are quasi-random (Chung et al. 1989): the number of times each possible constant-order graph occurs as a subgraph of a Paley graph is (in the limit for large q) the same as for random graphs, and large sets of vertices have approximately the same number of edges as they would in random graphs.  Applications  * The Paley graph of order 9 is a locally linear graph, a rook's graph, and the graph of the 3-3 duoprism. * The Paley graph of order 13 has book thickness 4 and queue number 3 . * The Paley graph of order 17 is the unique largest graph G such that neither G nor its complement contains a complete 4-vertex subgraph (Evans et al. 1981). It follows that the Ramsey number R(4, 4) = 18\\\\. * The Paley graph of order 101 is currently the largest known graph G such that neither G nor its complement contains a complete 6-vertex subgraph. * Sasukara et al. (1993) use Paley graphs to generalize the construction of the Horrocks‚ÄìMumford bundle. Paley digraphs Let q be a prime power such that q = 3 (mod 4). Thus, the finite field of order q, Fq, has no square root of ‚àí1\\\\. Consequently, for each pair (a,b) of distinct elements of Fq, either a ‚àí b or b ‚àí a, but not both, is a square. The Paley digraph is the directed graph with vertex set V = Fq and arc set :A = \\\\left \\\\\\\\{(a,b)\\\\in \\\\mathbf{F}_q\\\\times\\\\mathbf{F}_q \\\\ : \\\\ b-a\\\\in (\\\\mathbf{F}_q^{\\\\times})^2 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}. The Paley digraph is a tournament because each pair of distinct vertices is linked by an arc in one and only one direction. The Paley digraph leads to the construction of some antisymmetric conference matrices and biplane geometries.  Genus  The six neighbors of each vertex in the Paley graph of order 13 are connected in a cycle; that is, the graph is locally cyclic. Therefore, this graph can be embedded as a Whitney triangulation of a torus, in which every face is a triangle and every triangle is a face. More generally, if any Paley graph of order q could be embedded so that all its faces are triangles, we could calculate the genus of the resulting surface via the Euler characteristic as \\\\tfrac{1}{24}(q^2 - 13q + 24). conjectures that the minimum genus of a surface into which a Paley graph can be embedded is near this bound in the case that q is a square, and questions whether such a bound might hold more generally. Specifically, Mohar conjectures that the Paley graphs of square order can be embedded into surfaces with genus :(q^2 - 13q + 24)\\\\left(\\\\tfrac{1}{24} + o(1)\\\\right), where the o(1) term can be any function of q that goes to zero in the limit as q goes to infinity. finds embeddings of the Paley graphs of order q ‚â° 1 (mod 8) that are highly symmetric and self-dual, generalizing a natural embedding of the Paley graph of order 9 as a 3√ó3 square grid on a torus. However the genus of White's embeddings is higher by approximately a factor of three than Mohar's conjectured bound.

Wemyss was the senior British representative at the signing of the armistice that ended active hostilities in the war. It was Weymyss who made the decision, much to the anger of British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, to have the ceasefire to come into effect at 11.00 a.m. Lloyd George wanted it to take place at 2.30 p.m. so that he could make the announcement in the House of Commons. Wemyss realised that 11 a.m on the 11th day of the 11th month had a strong, poetic quality about it; besides, by 2.30 p.m. more soldiers could be unnecessarily killed. After attending the Paris Peace Conference as Britain's naval representative, Wemyss resigned in November 1919 following persistent calls for Sir David Beatty to be given his job.Heathcote, p. 253 Wemyss was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 1 November 1919 and was raised to the peerage as Baron Wester Wemyss, of Wemyss in the County of Fife on 18 November 1919.

Provisions The act awarded veterans additional pay in various forms, with only limited payments available in the short term. The value of each veteran's \\"credit\\" was based on each recipient's service in the United States Armed Forces between April 5, 1917, and July 1, 1919, with $1.00 awarded for each day served in the United States and $1.25 for each day served abroad. It set maximum payments at $500 (approximately $7,250 in 2018 dollars) for a veteran who served stateside and $625 for a veteran who served overseas. Most officers and anyone whose service began after November 11, 1918, were excluded.Red Cross, 363, 364 It authorized immediate payments to anyone due less than $50.Red Cross, 363, 365 The estate of a deceased veteran could be paid his award immediately if the amount was less than $500.Red Cross, 367 All others were awarded an \\"Adjusted Service Certificate,\\" which functioned like an insurance policy. Based on standard actuarial calculations, the value of a veteran's certificate was set as the value of a 20-year insurance policy equal to 125 percent of the value of his service credit. Certificates were to be awarded on the veteran's birthday no earlier than January 1, 1925, and redeemable in full on his birthday in 1945, with payments to his estate if he died before then.Red Cross, 363, 367b Certificate holders were allowed to use them as collateral for loans under certain restrictions.Red Cross, 368-72 Enactment President Warren Harding (1921‚Äì1923), The American Legion was a principal proponent of the legislation on behalf of World War I veterans, and it objected to the term bonus, because \\"bonus has come to mean 'full payment plus,' and there has not yet been full payment, or anywhere near full payment, so there cannot be any plus.\\"American Legion, Dept. of Massachusetts, Special Constitutional Convention, (Boston, 1921), 228, available online The Legion said that the government needed to \\"restore the faith of men sorely tried by what they feel to be National ingratitude and injustice.\\" The Legion pointed out that the Wilson administration had made additional payments to government workers in 1917‚Äì18 to help offset the effects of inflation, without making any comparable provision for members of the military.Palmer, 48 The Legion fought President Warren G. Harding as his position changed from supporting payments if paired with a revenue measure, to supporting a future pension system.Hanford MacNider, \\"The Legion and the Veto\\", New Outlook, October 4, 1922, available online Harding felt so strongly about the issue that he visited the Senate to make his case against one version of the bill in 1921, and the Senate voted it down 47‚Äì29.John D. Hicks, Republican Ascendancy 1921‚Äì1933 (NY: HarperCollins, 1960), 52 Harding vetoed another version of the Adjusted Compensation Act on September 19, 1922, and the House overrode his veto 258‚Äì54 but the Senate failed to override by 4 votes on a vote that split both Democrats and Republicans.\\"The Bonus, the President, and the Legion,\\" New Outlook, October 4, 1922, available onlinePalmer, 62 Harding's veto of the popular measure particularly alienated the Senate Republicans, who thought the President's defense of fiscal integrity endangered the party's electoral prospects. In preliminary negotiations between Congress and President Calvin Coolidge, it became clear that the President would veto any law that proposed immediate cash payments to veterans and that the Senate would sustain that veto. The legislation, popularly called the Insurance Bill, provided the veteran instead with a variety of future payment scenarios rather than cash in the short term.New York Times: \\"Drop Cash Bonus to Prevent Veto,\\" April 20, 1924, accessed December 18, 92010 On May 15, 1924, Coolidge vetoed a bill granting bonuses to veterans of World War I saying: \\"patriotism...bought and paid for is not patriotism.\\" Congress overrode his veto a few days later.David Greenberg, Calvin Coolidge (NY: Henry Holt, 2006), 78‚Äì9 The act was amended with respect to minor details on July 3, 1926. Later history Veterans were able to take out loans against their certificates beginning in 1927. By June 30, 1932, more than 2.5 million veterans had borrowed $1.369 billion.Willard Waller, The Veteran Comes Back (NY: Dryden Press, 1944), 241 In 1936, the Adjusted Compensation Payment Act (January 27, 1936, ch. 32, 49 Stat. 1099) replaced the 1924 Act's service certificates with bonds issued by the Treasury Department that could be redeemed at any time.

An Imperial Ottoman summer residence built in the 1860s, it is now situated immediately north of the Bosphorus Bridge. It was the last place where Sultan Abdulhamid II was under house arrest before his death in 1918. History Beylerbeyi Palace was commissioned by Sultan Abd√ºlaziz (1830-1876) and built between 1861 and 1865 as a summer residence and a place to entertain visiting heads of state. Empress Eug√©nie of France visited Beylerbeyi on her way to the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Empress Eug√©nie of France was so delighted by the elegance of the palace that she had a copy of the window in the guest room made for her bedroom in Tuileries Palace, in Paris. Naser al- Din Shah Qajar of Iran stayed in the palace while he was in Istanbul, back on his way from Exposition Universelle (1889) of France. Other regal visitors to the palace included the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The palace was the last place of captivity of the deposed sultan Abdulhamid II from 1912 until his death there in 1918. Description Designed in the Second Empire style by Sarkis Balyan, Beylerbeyi Palace seems fairly restrained compared to the excesses of the earlier Dolmabah√ße or K√º√ß√ºksu palaces. The palace looks its most attractive from the Bosphorus, from where its two bathing pavilions, one for the harem (women's only) and the other for the selamlik (men's only), can best be seen. One of the most attractive rooms is the reception hall, which has a pool and fountain. Running water was popular in Ottoman houses for its pleasant sound and cooling effect in the heat. Egyptian reed matting is used on the floor as a form of insulation. The crystal chandeliers are mostly French Baccarat and the carpets are from Hereke.

It is located on the River Blackwater, approximately east of Braintree and is north-northeast from the county town of Chelmsford. The village is in the district and parliamentary constituency of Braintree. The parish is part of the Blackwater parish cluster. The name can be confused with Bradwell-on-Sea, also in Essex, which is often abbreviated to just Bradwell. The name derives from Old English meaning broad well. To this day there is a spring a few metres north of the modern manor house of Bradwell Hall near to Holy Trinity Church. In the Middle Ages, this spring fed an overshot mill. Remains of the last mill on the site can still be seen in the overgrown surroundings of the millpool. Bradwell is a dispersed village. There is no good evidence that the village was ever nucleated around the church. The modern village, on the A120 between Braintree and Coggeshall, is the former hamlet of Blackwater (also once known as Blackwater Green) by which name it was known into the twentieth century. There is evidence for settlement in Bradwell as far back as the late Mesolithic period. There are crop marks and some funerary remains attesting to Bronze Age settlers; excavations in the 1970s uncovered a large Iron Age ditch. One other probably Iron Age site remains unexcavated. Bradwell's prehistory is mostly unexplored. Of Roman settlement there is scant evidence. Scattered building remains in one field to the east of the church suggest a farmstead, and Roman coins and pottery have occurred sporadically. The Romans did, however, build the road now known as the A120, running from Colchester to St Albans. In the 1850s the rebuilding of the bridge over the River Blackwater found Roman remains, including a horseshoe. The whereabouts of these remains is uncertain. Before about 1140, the signs of Bradwell either in the historic or the archaeological record are small. There is one piece of evidence: a late Saxon document lists the estate of Glazenwood in Bradwell. The estate, perhaps little changed, remains. Bradwell, however, does not occur in Domesday although there is evidence to suggest that its entry is linked with that of nearby Kelvedon.

The group, which was founded in Addis Ababa, comprised up to 30 traditional instrumentalists, vocalists, and dancers from many different Ethiopian regions and ethnic groups (including Amhara, Tigray-Tigrinia, Oromo, Welayta, and Gimira). It was the first ensemble of its type, as these diverse instruments and ethnic groups previously had never played together. For a time, due to El-Dabh's efforts, the Orchestra was in residence at the Creative Arts Centre of Haile Selassie I University (now Addis Ababa University). Overview Its main instruments included krar (medium lyre), masenqo (one- string fiddle), begena (large lyre), washint (end-blown flute with finger holes), embilta (end-blown flute without finger holes), malakat (straight trumpet), kabaro (drum), and other percussion instruments. On occasion, it also used the tom, an mbira-like instrument. Many of Orchestra Ethiopia's performances were theatrical in nature, such as the drama The Potter, which was arranged by El-Dabh. Following El-Dabh's departure from Ethiopia in 1964, subsequent directors included John G. Coe, an American Peace Corps volunteer (1964‚Äì1966); and Tesfaye Lemma (1966-1975), both of whom composed and arranged for the group. During Lemma's tenure as director, in 1968, another American Peace Corps volunteer, the Harvard-educated Charles Sutton, Jr., was assigned by the Peace Corps to assist the Orchestra as Administrator, a position in which he continued until 1970. Sutton had arrived in Ethiopia in 1966 and, immediately attracted to Ethiopia's traditional music, actually mastered the masenqo, studying with Orchestra member Getamesay Abebe. He began performing with the Orchestra in March 1967 (playing masenqo and singing in Amharic), at Lemma's invitation. The group performed frequently in hotels and at the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa, and appeared on national radio (including Radio Voice of the Gospel) and television. The group also had an audience with Emperor Haile Selassie I. In the spring of 1969, due to the efforts of Sutton and the Peace Corps, Orchestra Ethiopia toured the Midwest and East Coast of the United States, under the name \\"The Blue Nile Group.\\" The group performed in twenty cities, including Manhattans Town Hall and The Ed Sullivan Show (in early March). The group released two LP recordings, both entitled Orchestra Ethiopia. The first, subtitled \\"The Blue Nile Group,\\" was released on Tempo Records c. 1969; and the second was released on Blue Nile Records, in 1973 or 1974. The Orchestra was also featured in a National Geographic documentary film entitled Ethiopia: The Hidden Empire (1970). By 1975, due to the upheavals caused by the Derg revolution, the group finally disbanded, although many of its musicians continued to perform with other groups, and as soloists. The group's washint player, Melaku Gelaw, lives and continues to perform and record in Washington, D.C.; Tesfaye Lemma, now retired, lives in Washington, D.C. Masenqo player Getamesay Abebe and drummer, vocalist, and star dancer Zerihun Bekkele, both retired, continue to live in Ethiopia. Washint player Yohannes Afework, who had replaced Gelaw, lives in Addis Ababa and is retired from the Mazegajabet (Municipality) Orchestra. Coe, the former Executive Director of the Wyoming Arts Council, is now retired and living in Wyoming; and Sutton performs today as a jazz pianist in Connecticut (and continues to play masenqo for special occasions). Several other of the Orchestra's members have died in Ethiopia. A selection of the Orchestra's archival recordings transferred from reel to reel audiotape to audio CDs by the Ethiopian-American engineer Andrew Laurence was released in Europe in late 2007, and was released in the United States in February 2008, as the 23rd volume in Buda Musique's Ethiopiques CD series, with the liner notes having been prepared by Sutton and Lemma. In 2007, a recording entitled Zoro Gettem (Reunion) was released on the Nahom Records label; the CD, recorded in Washington, D.C. in September 2006, features four of the Orchestra's former members (Charles Sutton, Getamesay Abbebe, Melaku Gelaw, and Tesfaye Lemma) performing repertoire they had performed together in the late 1960s.

Saint Cedd founded a monastery within the old walls in 653, which survives as the restored Chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall, one of the oldest churches in Britain. From there, he continued the evangelisation of Essex. In the 20th century, the village became better known as the site for the Bradwell nuclear power station. It also has a very good sailing club and outdoor leisure facilities. There is a school ‚Äì St Cedd's C. of E. Primary School. The village has been called Bradwell juxta Mare, Bradwell-next-the-Sea and Bradwell near the Sea. Celebrated residents include the Tudor martyr Thomas Abel, the newspaper editor Sir Henry Bate Dudley, the MP Tom Driberg, who is buried in the churchyard, and the artist F. H. Haagensen. The local newspaper is the Maldon and Burnham Standard. There is a Facebook page called The Bradwell Bugle which seems largely inactive. =World War Two= During the Second World War the airfield sited to the north-east of Bradwell Waterside was a front-line station, and named RAF Bradwell Bay.

In 1941 the airfield was enlarged, swallowing up the pre-war grass landing ground, and three concrete runways were laid down. As it was quite near to the coast, and many aircraft in distress landed there, it had the FIDO (Fog Intensive Dispersal Operation) system installed to help pilots find a safe landing in foggy weather. Many night-fighter squadrons were based here, equipped first with the Douglas Havoc, then the de Havilland Mosquito, the ubiquitous multi-role-combat aircraft of its time. The airfield was also used as a jumping-off point for fighters escorting long-distance bombing raids on Germany, and such types as the Spitfire and North American Mustang could be seen. A recent memorial, in the shape of a crashed de Havilland Mosquito, has been placed near to the edge of the airfield to remember all those who lost their lives in defence of Britain in the Second World War whilst based at RAF Bradwell Bay.

Playing career Born in Varese, Ambrosetti made his professional debut with his hometown club, and later played for several Italian sides, including Brescia, Venezia, and Vicenza. He won the 1996‚Äì97 Coppa Italia at Vicenza, defeating Napoli 3‚Äì1 on aggregate in the final, and in April 1998 played in a Cup Winners Cup semi-final against Chelsea, where his performances inspired the English Premier League club to sign him for ¬£3.5 million in August 1999. He arrived as, according to his manager, Gianluca Vialli, the 'Italian Ryan Giggs', but struggled to live up to the tag and in four years made only a handful of appearances. He made his Chelsea debut as a substitute on 21 August in a 1‚Äì0 home win against Aston Villa, replacing compatriot Gianfranco Zola for the last three minutes. The only goal he scored for Chelsea was in a 5‚Äì0 win against Galatasaray in Istanbul, on 20 October 1999 during the UEFA Champions League Group Stage. Ambrosetti also contributed one appearance to Chelsea's victorious 1999‚Äì2000 FA Cup campaign. He spent his final seasons with Piacenza and Pro Patria, before retiring. Style of play Capapble of playing both as a forward and as a midfielder, Ambrosetti was a quick and technically gifted winger, who was known for his pace, ability to get past players, and his powerful and accurate shot from distance.

The highway is also known as County Road N-3 or FH-59 or the Palmdale cutoff; the route numbers are unsigned, but noted on many maps. It is about long. It passes through the Angeles National Forest, and a western section of the San Gabriel Mountains National Monument. The Angeles Forest Highway is maintained by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works. It is used primarily for recreation, although a significant portion of its traffic comes from commuters living in the Antelope Valley. It a well-known alternate to California State Route 14 in this regard, and is known for its numerous high-speed accidents.LA Times This is the route for proposed State Route 249. Route description The first section of the Palmdale cutoff north from Los Angeles is the southern end of the Angeles Crest Highway (California State Route 2), which follows the Arroyo Seco and the powerlines north from La Ca√±ada. At Dark Canyon, the powerlines diverge over the ridge while the paved highway follows the canyon to Georges Gap, just past the Clear Creek Vista. =Clear Creek Segment= The Angeles Forest Highway begins its journey north at Clear Creek Junction, past Georges Gap, while the Angeles Crest Highway continues on east toward Red Box. At this junction are the Clear Creek Information Center on the right, the Clear Creek Station of the Forest Service on the left, and the fire road which is the trailhead for Mt. Josephine across the street from the station. There is also a trail leading to Switzer Picnic Area which begins here. If you stop and park at the Info Center, you can see the trace of the San Gabriel Fault by looking east up the Arroyo Seco toward Red Box. This alignment of features is a result of erosion of the rocks softened by movement along the fault. The gap also separates the watershed of the Arroyo Seco from that of Clear Creek which flows into Big Tujunga Creek. The road continues to follow the Clear Creek drainage while contouring around the southwestern slope of Mt. Josephine, which can be referred to as Mount Josephine or Josephine Peak. It used to have a fire lookout tower that was visible from the valley floor, but now has the Pines Picnic Area, looking out over the fault trace northwest through Clear Creek. The highway then leaves Clear Creek and enters the Big Tujunga Creek drainage as it crosses the Josephine ridge and turns northeastward. =Big Tujunga Creek Segment= Once the highway meets the Big Tujunga Road, its character changes. This section between the junction and the bridge over the Narrows is the most precipitous, is the most prone to rock slides, has the most rescues from people climbing down its slopes to the waterholes, and features more wildflowers than other sections along the route, such as the Spanish broom. The roadcuts show off the light-colored Mt. Josephine granodiorite.Geology Field Guide to Southern California, p. 109. After crossing the Big Tujunga Narrows Bridge, originally named the Armstrong Bridge,.The San Gabriels: Mountain Country, p. 202 which rises 275' above the canyon bottom, there is a large turnout on the east side of the road. Floods periodically scour the canyon and debris fills the reservoir behind the dam lower down. The vegetation was recently destroyed by fire. Next the road passes through a tunnel, sometimes marked on maps as the Singing Springs Tunnel. At the tunnel's south entrance are rocks of banded gneiss, 1,700 million years old, some of the oldest rock found in the San Gabriel Mountains.Geology Field Guide to Southern California, p. 110. The road cuts through a ridge separating the Big Tujunga from its tributary, Mill Creek. From this point, the Angeles Forest Highway follows the west side of Mill Creek. =Mill Creek Segment= Immediately on the other side of the tunnel on the west side of the highway is the Hidden Springs Picnic Ground, a rest stop with overlooks and use trails. The trailhead for the Fall Creek Trail is 500' up the road also on the west side. It is marked with a brown hiking sign, but offers no parking. The hillsides once were covered with chamise, manzanita, and yucca but the vegetation as well as the Hidden Springs Cafe were destroyed by the 2009 Station Fire. Monte Cristo Station (Named after the Monte Cristo Gold Mine is a stop on the Big Tujunga Canyon Auto Tour. Gold mining equipment used for hard rock and streamside mining is displayed here. One building survived the Station Fire. At the westside turnout of Baughman Springs, is an exposure of white-colored anorthosite, a rock 1.22 billion years old, which is also found on the lunar highlands.Geology Field Guide to Southern California, p. 111. Parish's rabbitbrush (Ericameria parishii), a late bloomer, begins to be seen as the road rises. The highway then crests Mill Creek Summit, , the highest point along the Angeles Forest Highway. There was once another convenient rest stop with shade, restrooms and picnic tables, but were all destroyed by the Station Fire in August 2009. As of May 2016, the site had since been rebuilt. =Aliso Canyon Segment= After Mill Creek Summit, the Angeles Forest Highway crosses a drainage divide. From here on all the water goes into Aliso Creek, the headwaters of the Santa Clara River. Aliso is Spanish for sycamore. The road now follows the east side of Aliso Canyon. At Aliso Springs Picnic Ground, there are no sycamores, only canyon oaks. After the Picnic Ground, there is a road cut showing the banded Lowe granodiorite.Geology Field Guide to Southern California, p. 112. It is best seen when driving south up the grade where, in this case, it would be before the picnic area. =Kentucky Springs Canyon Segment= After the junction with Aliso Canyon Road, the highway leaves Aliso Creek and crosses a ridge to Kentucky Springs Canyon. The straight-away section on alluvium, approaching the Mt. Emma Road and the Angeles National Forest boundary, goes through pinyon pine and California juniper woodland. In the springtime, flannelbush and goldenbush bloom in this area. After the boundary sign, the pinyon pines disappear and Great Basin sagebrush becomes more dominant. On the west side is an Edison Company substation, the goal of the original pole line road. Power is brought in from sources north and east of the mountain range and transferred on into the Los Angeles basin. On its final leg approaching Vincent Junction, the Angeles Forest Highway crosses the wide Soledad Pass, , also used by the railroad and California State Route 14 (Antelope Valley Freeway). Drainage on the other side of the pass goes to Little Rock Creek and then out to the interior basin of the Mojave Desert. One geologist suggested that the headwaters of the Santa Clara River may eventually cut through to the desert here.Geology Field Guide to Southern California, p. 113. History The first road across the San Gabriels in this direction was built by the Edison Company to service their powerlines in the 1920s. The pole line road went from Eagle Rock to Vincent.The San Gabriels: Mountain Country, p. 198.

From the age of eleven until she was eighteen, Austen wrote her tales in three notebooks. These still exist, one in the Bodleian Library and the other two in the British Museum. They contain, among other works, Love and Freindship, written when she was fourteen, and The History of England, written when she was fifteen. Overview Written in epistolary form like her later unpublished novella, Lady Susan, Love and Freindship is thought to be one of the tales she wrote for the amusement of her family. It was dedicated to her cousin Eliza de Feuillide, known as \\"La Comtesse de Feuillide\\". The instalments, written as letters from the heroine Laura, to Marianne, the daughter of her friend Isabel, may have come about as nightly readings by the young Jane in the Austen home. Love and Freindship (the misspelling is one of many in the story) is clearly a parody of romantic novels Austen read as a child. This is clear even from the subtitle, \\"Deceived in Freindship and Betrayed in Love\\", which undercuts the title. In form, the story resembles a fairy tale in featuring wild coincidences and turns of fortune, but Austen is determined to lampoon the conventions of romantic stories, down to the utter failure of romantic fainting spells, which always turn out badly for the female characters. The story shows the development of Austen's sharp wit and disdain for romantic sensibility, characteristic of her later novels. The 2016 film Love & Friendship [sic] is a film version of Lady Susan, borrowing only the title from Love and Freindship. Synopsis ;Letter The First From Isabel to Laura This presents a glimpse into the life of Laura from Isabel's perspective. Isabel asks Laura to tell the \\"misfortunes and adventures\\" of her life to Isabel's daughter Marianne (Austen 516). Isabel argues that because Laura is turning 55, she is past the danger of \\"disagreeable lovers\\" and \\"obstinate fathers\\" (Austen 516). This initial letter sets up the rest of Austen's narrative through Laura's letters to Marianne. ;Letter The Second Laura to Isabel This consists of a reply from Laura to Isabel. Laura initially disagrees with Isabel's assessment that she is safe from \\"misfortunes\\" simply because of her advanced age (Austen 516). Laura agrees to write to Marianne and detail her life experiences to \\"satisfy the curiosity of Marianne\\" and to teach her useful lessons (Poplawski 183). The useful lessons are lessons learned from the misfortunes caused by \\"disagreeable lovers\\" and \\"obstinate fathers\\" (Poplawski 183). Poplawski highlights the importance of the relationship between females and their lovers and also between females and their fathers as a means through which Austen is able to criticise stereotypical female behaviour. As seen throughout the work, these two relationships are constantly criticised by satirical anecdotes. Janetta's relations with her father and with her lover, Capitan M‚ÄôKenzie in the twelfth letter, shows Austen mocking the fickleness of family ties and romantic relationships. ;Letter The Third Laura to Marianne Laura's narrative to Marianne begins in the third letter and continues through to the 15th letter. In the 3rd, Laura gives a brief overview of the origins of her parents, her birth in Spain, and her education in a convent in France. At 18, Laura returns to her parents‚Äô home in Wales. Laura pauses to describe herself at this age. She emphasises her \\"accomplishments\\", which in that period would have been things that made a woman a better companion for her future husband (Austen 516). Laura ends the letter by posing the idea that her misfortunes in life ‚Äúdo not make less impression‚Ä¶ than they ever did,‚Äù but that her accomplishments have begun to fade (Austen 517). The uncertainty of Laura's memory causes Austen's work to resemble a fairy tale in its qualities of ambiguity. ;Letter The Fourth Laura to Marianne Here Austen reveals the connection between Laura and Isabel. Laura tells Marianne that Isabel was one of her few neighbours in Wales and that Isabel resided in the neighbourhood due to \\"indigent circumstances\\" and for \\"economic motives\\" (Austen 517). Laura depicts Isabel as having fewer accomplishments and less beauty than herself, but being better travelled. Isabel warns Laura of the \\"insipid vanities and idle dissipations\\" of London, Bath and Southampton, while instilling in Laura a desire to explore the world (Austen 517). ;Letter The Fifth Laura to Marianne Here Laura recalls a night in December when a strange man and his servant, who were lost, stopped at her home in need of shelter. Upon hearing a knock at their door, Laura and her family converse about the character of the knock and the knocker's intention. Laura depicts her initial attraction to the young gentleman, claiming him to be the \\"most beauteous and amiable youth\\" she had ever seen (Austen 518). Austen's character Laura's instant and \\"undying attachment\\" to the stranger mocks the romantic notion of friendship as an overused clich√© (Deresiewicz 103). Deresiewicz shows Austen's satirical view of love and friendship by illuminating the idea that romantic notions of these themes are oversimplified and stereotypical. ;Letter The Sixth Laura to Marianne This consists of a dialogue in which the stranger, named Lindsay, tells Laura and her family of his experiences before arriving at their house. Coming from an aristocratic family, Lindsay, referred to as Edward, describes his father as \\"seduced by the false glare of fortune and the deluding pomp of title\\" (Austen 518). His father wanted Lindsay to marry Lady Dorothea but Edward refused as he did not want to oblige his father. So Edward embarked on a journey to his aunt's house but having taken the wrong direction, ended up at Laura's instead. The letter ends with the hasty marriage of Edward and Laura performed by her father, which mocks the sensibility of Austen's characters (Sahney 130). Sahney's analysis shows how Austen's views of sensibility differed from those of the romantic novels she is likely to have read in her youth. While sensibility may have been a value that was pushed upon women of Austen's time, Sahney makes the point that Austen's use of exaggerated hasty decision-making in her novels shows that Austen knows the romantic notion of sensibility is a myth. ;Letter The Seventh Laura to Marianne Here Laura and Edward travel to his aunt's house in Middlesex. Edward's marriage to Laura is a surprise to his aunt and to Edward's sister Augusta. Laura notes the \\"disagreeable coldness and forbidding reserve\\" with which Augusta greets her (Austen 519). Laura overhears a conversation between Augusta and Edward in which Augusta expresses concern about Edward's \\"imprudent\\" marriage and consequently of their father's reaction (Austen 520). A discourse ensues in which Edward and Augusta work out just how many years Edward has been defying his father. It is through Edward and Augusta's dialogue that Austen questions the motives of romantic sentimentality (Southam 26). Lady Dorothea briefly visits and Laura does not take kindly to her. ;Letter The Eighth Laura to Marianne, in continuation After Lady Dorothea leaves, Sir Edward unexpectedly visits. Knowing Sir Edward came to admonish Edward for his marriage to Laura, Edward, ‚Äúwith heroic fortitude,‚Äù defends his marriage (Austen 521). Edward says it is his \\"greatest boast\\" to have displeased his father. Again Austen mocks the romantic motives of Edward and Laura's marriage (Austen 521). At once Edward and Laura take Sir Edwards carriage and travel to the home of Edward's friend Augustus who is married to Sophia. Upon meeting Sophia, Laura praises Sophia's, \\"sensibility and feeling,\\" as positive characteristics of her mind (Austen 521). The two women \\"instantly\\" vow to be friends forever and share their deepest secrets (Austen 521). Edward and Augustus create an \\"affecting scene\\" when they meet causing both Sophia and Laura to faint \\"alternately\\" on the couch (Austen 521). By using the words \\"instantly\\" and \\"alternately,\\" Austen shows her mastery of language and the ability of these words to serve as adverbs and also to function satirically (Lambdin 185‚Äì86). ;Letter The Ninth From the same to the same Laura and Edward receive a letter from Philippa saying that Sir Edward and Augusta went back to Bedfordshire abruptly after the married couple departed. Philippa also desires to see Edward and Laura again and asks them to return after their visit with Augustus and Sophia. A few weeks later Philippa is married to a fortune-hunter and Laura and Edward remark at the imprudence and insensibility of her decision. Laura recounts how perfect and happy their stay was with Sophia and Augustus until Augustus is arrested for unpaid debts. Augustus and Sophia had also defied their parents and Augustus had run out of the money he had taken from his father's escritoire when he left to marry Sophia. Laura describes Augustus's arrest as \\"treachery\\" and \\"barbarity\\" (Austen 522). With Augustus facing an execution in the House, Laura, Edward, and Sophia do the only thing they can do. They sigh and faint on the sofa. The theme of rebellion and revolution reappears throughout Austen's work and can be considered conventional (Copeland 92). ;Letter The Tenth Laura in continuation After Laura, Sophia and Edward recover, Edward sets off to town to see his imprisoned friend. Laura and Sophia have a \\"mature deliberation\\" and decide to leave the house before the Officers of Justice take possession (Austen 523). They wait for Edward who doesn‚Äôt return. After fainting, Laura decides to take Sophia and set out for London to see Augustus. Once in London, Laura asks every person they pass \\"If they had seen‚Ä¶ Edward,\\" but can get no replies since the carriage they are riding in is moving too quickly (Austen 523). Sophia tells Laura that seeing Augustus in distress would \\"overpower [her] sensibility,\\" especially since hearing of his misfortune is already shocking (Austen 523). So Laura and Sophia resolve to return to the country. Laura then tells Marianne that her mind never wandered to thoughts of her parents, who she forgot to mention had died two weeks after she left their cottage. ;Letter The Eleventh Laura in continuation Sophia and Laura decide to travel to Scotland to stay with a relation of Sophia's. At first they are hesitant because Laura is unsure whether the horses will be able to make the journey; the postilion (driver) agrees. They resolve to change horses at the next town and continue the journey. At an inn a few miles from Sophia's relation, they decide to stop. Not wanting to arrive unannounced, the women write an elegant letter detailing their misfortunes and desire to stay with the relative. As soon as they send the letter, they begin to step into their own carriage to follow right behind it. At that moment, another coach arrives and an elderly gentleman emerges and goes into the inn. Laura is overwhelmed with the feeling that this person is her grandfather so she throws herself to her knees in front of him and begs him to acknowledge their relation. He exclaims that she is in fact his granddaughter.This mocks the plot device of instinctive recognition of unknown relatives found in many novels of the later 18th century, such as Sophia Briscoe's Miss Melmoth; or the New Clarissa. Quoted in Ruth Perry: Novel Relations. The Transformation of Kinship in English Literature, 1748‚Äì1818 (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 400. Sophia then enters and the elderly man exclaims that Sophia is also his granddaughter descended from another of his daughters. As they are all embracing each other, a young man appears and the elderly man, Lord St. Clair, claims he is also one of his grandchildren. Another youth comes into the room and exclaims that he is the grandchild of Lord St. Clair's fourth daughter. Lord St. Clair writes each of the four grandchildren banknotes and immediately leaves. ;Letter The Twelfth Laura in continuation After Lord St. Clair leaves, Laura and Sophia faint. When they wake up, both the male grandchildren are gone and so are Sophia and Laura's banknotes. Sophia's cousin, Macdonald, who they first perceive as amiable and sympathetic, offers to take them to Macdonald-Hall. They ride with Macdonald's daughter Janetta, who is to be wed to Graham, a man Macdonald has chosen, once they return to Macdonald-Hall. Laura and Sophia see through Macdonald's character and no longer perceive him as well disposed. Laura and Sophia decide Graham is not fit to marry Janetta because Graham has no soul, hasn‚Äôt read The Sorrows of Werther, and does not have auburn hair (Austen 525). Laura and Sophia ask Janetta if she has ever felt affection for Graham or any other man and soon convince Janetta of her love for a man named Captain M‚ÄôKenzie. After analysing Captain M‚ÄôKenzie's actions concerning Janetta, Laura and Sophia declare he must be in love with her despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. They decide to write Captain M‚ÄôKenzie a letter encouraging him to confess his attachment to Janetta and secretly marry her. Captain M‚ÄôKenzie replies that it was only modesty which kept him from acting sooner and thus Janetta and M‚ÄôKenzie leave for Gretna-Green to celebrate their nuptials. Austen's continuous ridicule of love at first sight expresses scepticism about the spontaneous feelings and the truth or lack of truth which those feelings possess (Walder 229). ;Letter The Thirteenth Laura in continuation Here Sophia finds banknotes in a private drawer in Macdonald's library. Laura and Sophia plan to take a banknote or two each time they pass through the room because it would be \\"proper treatment for so vile a wretch\\" (Austen 527). However, on the day that Janetta escapes, Sophia is caught by Macdonald in the act of stealing his money. Macdonald verbally reprimands Sophia and in response she informs him of Janetta's elopement as revenge. Laura enters into the library and both women are offended by Macdonald's \\"ill-grounded\\" accusations (Austen 527). Macdonald tells the women they must leave in half an hour and Laura and Sophia agree to do so. After walking a mile or so, they settle next to a stream to rest. Sophia expresses distress over the situation Augustus was in when they left. On the road near where they are sitting, an accident causes a gentleman's phaeton to overturn. Laura and Sophia rush to help and discover it is Edward and Augustus on the ground bleeding. Sophia faints and Laura shrieks and runs madly about. After more than an hour, Edward regains consciousness and Laura asks what has happened since Augustus was taken to jail. Edward said he will tell her, but after a deep sigh, dies. The women again become frenzied and finally walk to a white cottage. A widow leads them into her house, where Sophia and Laura meet her daughter Bridget. ;Letter The Fourteenth Laura in continuation Next morning Sophia complains of severe pain in her limbs. Gradually, the pain got worse and it turned into a \\"galloping consumption\\" or tuberculosis (Austen 530). As Sophia dies, she tells Laura that she dies a \\"martyr to [her] grief for the loss of Augustus\\" (Austen 531). Sophia dies, and Laura takes to walking out of the village. She gets into a stagecoach which she decides to take to Edinburgh. As it is dark when she gets in, Laura does not know who she is riding with and becomes upset that the travellers in the carriage fail to speak to her. At daylight, she realises she is travelling with Sir Edward, Augusta, Lady Dorothea, Philippa, Philander and Gustavus. After Laura tells them that Edward is dead, Augusta realises she is the heiress of Sir Edward's fortunes. ;Letter The Fifteenth Laura in continuation The coach stops for the travellers to have breakfast. Laura seeks out Philander and Gustavus and talk with, but does not ask about the banknotes that disappeared in their presence. At 15, Philander and Gustavus took 900 pounds and ran away. They divided the money into parcels to be spent on various things. They went to London and spent the money in seven weeks. They joined a theatre and began performing in plays. Philander and Gustavus went to their grandfather for money and left once they had obtained the banknotes. The journey continues to Edinburgh. Sir Edward decides to give Laura 400 pounds a year because she is the widow of his son. Laura moves to the Highlands of Scotland and lives in \\"melancholy solitude\\" mourning the death of her family, husband, and friend (Austen 534). Augusta marries Graham. Sir Edward marries Lady Dorothea in hopes of gaining her estate. Philander and Gustavus moved to Covent Garden and perform under the names Lewis and Quick. Philippa's husband continues to drive the stagecoach from Edinburgh to Sterling. Notes References *Jane Austen, \\"Love and Freindship\\". The Norton Anthology of English Literature, ed.

History  The village's Irish name (Baile √Åtha an Urchair or √Åth an Urchair) was historically anglicised as Ballanurcher, Athnurcher and Ardnurcher.Placenames Database of Ireland (see archival records) The name probably derives from the legend that Conchobar mac Nessa was killed here.Eugene O'Curry, Lectures on the Manuscript Materials of Ancient Irish History, (Dublin 1861), page 593. According to tradition, the English name - Horseleap - originated in an incident in which a member of the De Lacy family was forced to flee on horseback from the Mac Geoghegans. On approaching his castle and discovering that the drawbridge was raised, he jumped the castle's moat on horseback.Catharina Day, Cadogan Guide Ireland (New Holland Publishers, 2006) page 506. The battle of Ardnocher took place here in 1329 between the forces of Thomas Butler and William Mac Geoghegan. Mac Geoghegan forces won and Butler and many of his soldiers were killed.

Its specific epithet commemorates American ornithologist Rollo Beck. It is believed to nest on small islands with tall mountains around Melanesia. Described in 1928, and long known from only two specimens, sightings and collections in the 2000s confirmed the birds still existed, but are considered critically endangered by the IUCN. Description It is dark brown above and on the head and throat. It is dark underneath the wings with a fairly distinct white wingbar. The belly and breast are white. It flies over open oceans with straight wings that are slightly bent back at the tips. History The petrel used to be known from only two specimens ‚Äì a female east of New Ireland, PNG in 1928 and a male north-east of Rendova, Solomon Islands in 1929. In 2005, a bird possibly of this species was photographed in Australia's Coral Sea by birding tour guide Richard Baxter. He noted that it was definitely not the similar and much more common Tahiti petrel because it is much smaller. He also noted the pale throat and shorter and broader wings. This record has not been officially accepted by the Birds Australia Rarities Committee, considering at the time of the report, no living specimens of the species had been found, but given the new evidence this may eventually change. In recent times, sightings of birds that may have been Beck's petrels were reported from the Bismarck Archipelago and Solomon Islands. Hadoram Shirihai, the Israeli ornithologist, finally managed to confirm the species' continuing existence. In 2003, he had made some of the tentative sightings, and returning to the area in July and August 2007, he observed and photographed some 30 birds, including juveniles and adults. Sightings were especially frequent near Cape St George, New Ireland. A bird that had recently died was collected as the third specimen, finally providing definite proof of the mysterious petrels' identity. In February 2010 a live Beck's petrel, disoriented by ship's lights during night flight, landed on a cruise ship (chartered for a birdwatching tour) between New Zealand and New Guinea, and, after being closely examined, was released alive the next day.The Babbling Brook, periodical of the Wachiska Audubon Society of Southeast Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska, July 2010; article \\"Petrel Encounter\\" by Jeanne Kern, page 2 Breeding The breeding grounds are still undiscovered. While most of the data suggests a location in the southern Bismarck Archipelago, petrels are notoriously migratory and move away from their breeding grounds after the young have fledged, often for considerable distances. It is still more likely than not that the species breeds in Melanesia southeast of New Guinea, as was hypothesized at the species' discovery.

It is a part of the municipality of West Betuwe, and lies about east of Gorinchem. In 2001, the village of Acquoy had 278 inhabitants.

As of 1 January 2005. In January 2006 Acquoy had 617 inhabitants. According to popular legend a \\"Jan van Arkel\\" was the first to have settled the village of Acquoy, when he returned from the crusades in 1133. However, this is highly unlikely, because there were no crusades in the period around 1133. The first crusade was from 1096‚Äì99 and the second one was from 1147-49. Some sources report that the Jan van Arkel mentioned was in fact Jan I van Arkel. However, he lived a century later and had the nickname \\"de Sterke\\", which means \\"the strong\\". In 1305 Acquoy is mentioned as part of the property of the lords of Voorne. In 1364 Catherina van Voornenburgh rented her house together with the stronghold of Acquoy to Otto van Arkel for a period of 10 years and later he bought it. From that moment on, Acquoy, like Arkel itself and Gellicum, belonged to the Lordship of Arkel. After Acquoy changed hands several times, it was bought by Floris van Egmond, Count of Buren, in 1513. Through the marriage of Willem of Orange with the granddaughter of Floris van Egmond, Anna van Egmond in 1551, Acquoy, together with Leerdam, became property of the House of Orange and part of the County of Holland. The shire of Acquoy was made a barony in that time. Acquoy remained property of the House of Orange until 1795, when it became part of Holland, together with Leerdam. At this time the title of Baron of Acquoy disappeared. However, this did happen without protest of the local population. In 1820 it became part of the province Gelderland, because it became part of the municipality of Beesd. The shield of the Barony of Acquoy can nowadays still be viewed in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. Acquoy is located at the old turn of the river the Linge, which was diverted, so it nowadays lies at a dead-end U-formed side arm of the river. The village got its typical long stretched form, parallel to the river, because people used to build their houses on, or directly behind, the Linge dike. The name Acquoy is mentioned in scripts dating back to 1311, but there is some uncertainty where the name arises from. Some say that the name is from the Germanic *agaza, \\"magpie,\\" and ooi, \\"low soggy land.\\" \\"Ooi\\" is also found in other names; Wadenoijen, Poederoyen and Ammerzoden (= Ammerzoyen). According to the same theory the name \\"Rhenoy\\" is a combination of \\"Rhenus\\" (=Rijn, Rhine river) followed again by \\"ooi\\". Others point out that \\"Acquoy\\" is mentioned in old scripts as Eckoy or Echoy and this would mean that it was the lowland of lord Akko or Ekko. This was supposed to be a Friesian, but this is very uncertain. Acquoy is famous as the birthplace of Cornelius Jansenius (Jansen), bishop of Ypres (=Ieper), whose theological views brought forth the movement called Jansenism.

It was constructed and operated jointly by two competing railway companies as the stem of their lines to Greenock and Ayr respectively, and it opened in 1840. The Joint Committee, which controlled the line, built a branch to Govan and later to Cessnock Dock, and then Prince's Dock. With the passing of the Railways Act 1921 (Grouping Act) the line, together with the Caledonian Railway and the Glasgow and South Western Railway, became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). The line is still in heavy use today as the eastern end of the Inverclyde Line and the Ayrshire Coast Line. Formation In the 1830s promoters in the west of Scotland considered the potential for railway construction, and in the 1837 Parliamentary session, supporters of two schemes presented bills. One scheme was to build from Glasgow to Greenock, and the other from Glasgow to Ayr with a branch to Kilmarnock. Both wished to start from a Glasgow terminus at Bridge Street, and their proposed course as far as Paisley was almost identical. At the time Parliament was hostile to permitting closely parallel construction, and it became clear that the only way forward was to combine to build and use a shared line as far as Paisley. The Acts for the two schemes received the Royal Assent 15 July 1837, and the new companies were called the Glasgow, Paisley and Greenock Railway (GP&GR;) and the Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway (GPK&AR;). The GPK&AR; opened a section at its southern end on 19 July 1839 between Irvine and Ayr (Newton-on-Ayr), and it started operation on the Joint Line on 14 July 1840 from a temporary station at Glasgow (Bridge Street) to Paisley. The GP&GR; opened in March 1841, having been delayed due to the difficulties in the construction of the tunnel at Bishopton.David Ross, The Glasgow and South Western Railway: A History, Stenlake Publishing Limited, Catrine, 2014, C J A Robertson, The Origins of the Scottish Railway System: 1722-1844, John Donald Publishers Ltd, Edinburgh, 1983, Campbell Highet, The Glasgow and South Western Railway, Oakwood Press, Lingfield, 1965 Status of the joint line System map of the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway in 1841There was never a Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway Company; the Joint Line was managed separately from the other parts of the two owning companies, and managed by a Joint Committee. Some authors have referred to \\"the Joint Railway\\" and this has sometimes been taken to imply company status, but that is erroneous.John Thomas, revised Alan J S Paterson, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 6: Scotland, the Lowlands and the Borders, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1984, Glasgow extensions and service redirections In 1840 the Bridge Street terminus on Clyde Place was adequate; it was a temporary station, replaced by the imposing permanent structure on 6 April 1841, handling passengers and goods. However, as traffic grew, although it was enlarged, its shortcomings became obvious, and its location on the south side of the River Clyde was seen as a disadvantage. The GPK&AR; had merged with the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway and become the Glasgow and South Western Railway (G&SWR;) in 1850, and in 1876 it opened a new Glasgow passenger terminus called St Enoch. The site is nowadays largely subsumed in the St Enoch shopping centre. The new terminal was accessed over the City of Glasgow Union Railway, diverging (considered approaching Glasgow) at Shields Junction and crossing the Clyde at the Union Railway Bridge. St Enoch station became the main Glasgow passenger terminal for the G&SWR;, although they continued to use Bridge Street for some time. The Caledonian Railway (CR) became the successor to the Glasgow Paisley and Greenock Railway, and it too wished build a larger passenger terminal on the north side of the Clyde; on 31 July 1879, the CR opened a new terminus called Glasgow Central, fronting Gordon Street; the line was extended across the Clyde from Bridge Street on a four-track bridge built by Sir William Arrol & Co.. Bridge Street station was also improved to include two new through platforms leading to Central Station and four bay platforms: two for the CR and two for the G&SWR.; With the opening of Dunlop Street station on the City Union Line on 12 December 1870, the G&SWR; had a much more convenient central terminal in Glasgow, and the inconvenient station at Bridge Street was no longer an asset. The G&SWR; ceased using it on 1 February 1892, and \\"the Joint Line now started at the bridge over Cook Street and its mileposts had to be reset for the purpose of mileage calculations.\\"Ross, G&SWR;, page 131 Central Station was improved and extended in the period 1901 to 1905, and an additional eight- track bridge built over the Clyde. Bridge Street station was closed in 1905 and the site was used as carriage sidings. Govan branch A branch was promoted by the Joint Committee to Govan, from Ibrox. It opened to goods traffic on 1 May 1868 and to passengers on 2 December 1868.Casserley As an inner-suburban line, it was vulnerable to tramcar competition, and the passenger service was withdrawn on 9 May 1921. Princes Dock branch The Joint committee had obtained Acts of Parliament in 1891 and 1894 to build a line off the Govan branch to the Cessnock Dock then being planned by the Clyde Trustees. In June 1897 an agreement was made with the North British Railway (NBR) so that they could participate in the construction and operation, and this was finalised in June 1897. The Clyde Navigation Act, 1899, vested the new line in the Joint Committee from 9 August 1899. The line opened in 1903, retitled the Princes Dock Railway; it was heavily used by the NBR. Renfrew District Railway The Renfrew District Railway opened on 1 June 1903. It left the Joint Line's Shieldhall branch, crossing the G&SWR; Renfrew branch near Renfrew, then running south alongside it to a terminus at Renfrew (Porterfield). At first the passenger service was operated alternately each half year by the CR and the G&SWR;, but from 1907 the G&SWR; ran all the passenger trains, using St Enoch station in Glasgow. In 1916 a connection was installed near Porterfield joining it with the Renfrew branch.  Quadruple tracks  System map of the Glasgow and Paisley Joint Railway in 1922In the 1880s the main section of the joint line between Bridge Street station and Paisley Gilmour Street station was increased to quadruple tracks.Casserley, page 169 The work involved the opening out of the Arkleston Tunnel, which was reported as being carried out in 1882. 260 trains used the section daily at that time‚Äî300 in the peak summer period.David L Smith, Tales of the Glasgow and South Western Railway, Ian Allan Limited, London, undated The section was later reduced to double tracks between Shields Junction and Arkleston Junction during the mid 1960s as part of the resignalling works associated with the railway electrification of what is now known as the Inverclyde Line services between Glasgow Central and Gourock and Wemyss Bay, and the slow lines were removed between Arkleston Junction and Wallneuk Junction (the point of divergence of the Ayr line and the Greenock line) during the 1980s electrification of the Ayrshire Coast Line. As part of the now abandoned Glasgow Airport Rail Link, work started in late 2007 to reinstate a third track between Shields Junction and Arkleston Junction and four passenger lines between Arkleston Junction and Wallneuk Junction. These new tracks were opened to traffic in early 2012.  Present day: Inverclyde and Ayrshire Coast lines  The Joint Railway line between Glasgow Bridge Street and Paisley Gilmour Street is still in use today as part of the Inverclyde Line and the Ayrshire Coast Line. The Inverclyde Line was electrified in 1967; with electric Class 311 electric multiple unit (EMUs) rolling stock specially built for the line in 1967, although Class 303 EMUs were also used. The Ayrshire Coast Line was electrified later in 1985. British Rail Class 318 EMUs were introduced on the Ayrshire Coast Line, replacing the elderly British Rail Class 101, Class 107 and Class 126 diesel multiple units.  Accidents  =1855 tail end collision= On 22 February 1855 the 6.00 a.m. Dumfries to Glasgow train was brought to a stand on the Joint Line by a derailment due to a broken tyre. One of the passenger coaches had its doors locked, and before the guard could release the occupants, the 9.15 a.m. Greenock to Glasgow train ran into the rear of the train. One person was killed and several were injured. It was stated at the inquiry that the Joint Committee had issued no printed operating instructions. The Dumfries train started braking when it had just passed under the Paisley Road bridge (nowadays the A761 road). When it stopped the guard attempted to unlock the doors of an overturned coach, and a platelayer started back to warn any following train. A \\"policeman\\" (i.e. a railway employee stationed to control a level crossing and regulate trains) was on duty at Berryknowes Road level crossing, and he had exhibited a green hand signal, meaning \\"caution\\", to the driver of the Greenock train. The driver shut off steam but evidently continued coasting, and following the Dumfries train closely, he saw the platelayer's warning too late, and collided with the Dumfries train. The two trains were scheduled to leave Paisley at a two-minute interval, and the Dumfries train was slower. There were no printed instructions for Joint Line employees about the safe working, and the Secretary to the Railway Department of the Board of Trade wrote: > My Lords [of the Board of Trade] direct me to observe that the absence of > written or printed instructions, especially with respect to the starting of > the trams, and the intervals to be observed between them, is more than > ordinarily dangerous upon a line of railway traversed by trains belonging to > different Railway Companies.Col W Yolland, Report on Accident, 17 March > 1855, and letter, 4 April 1855, Captain D Galton, to the Secretary of the > Joint Committee, on line at =1882 collision= A signalman's error led to a collision at Penilee, at the west end of the present Hillington West station, on the afternoon of 9 September 1880, not long after the commissioning of the four-track layout. > A mineral train from Hurlford to Glasgow was plodding along the Up Goods > Line.

The station's studios are located in Farmingdale, New York and its transmitter is located in Brentwood, New York.  History  What began as WQMF (1,000w Ant 120 feet) came about in September 1961 when WGLI-FM (103.5 FM) moved from Babylon to Lake Success. Owner Friendly Frost, a Long Island-based appliance store chain, applied for another FM frequency to replace 103.5 in the Babylon area and WQMF was born. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules prohibited ownership of overlapping signals but because the new WGLI-FM antenna was located on a 175-foot tower (20Kw) outside the studio building visible from the Long Island ExpresswayStaff of WTFM(FM), 24 -hour fm stereo outlet, displays shop Broadcasting, November 27, 1961, pg. 50. its new signal did not cover Babylon (this would become an issue a few years later). WQMF was one of the first totally automated radio stations in the area and maybe the country. Its equipment package was named \\"Silent Sam\\" by engineers assigned to operate it as it played \\"beautiful music\\" from audio tapes supplied by a syndicator. The engineers' main function was tending to WQMF's sister station 1290 WGLI which required first class FCC licensed personnel because of its three tower directional antenna (1290 WGLI was shut down permanently in 1989). In 1965, 103.5 FM, which had become WTFM, obtained a construction permit to move its transmitter to the Chrysler Building in Manhattan but big new coverage from a 950-foot antenna (7.1Kw H 4.6Kw V) produced an overlapping signal with 94.3 FM, which had taken the WGLI-FM call sign. A quick sale sent WGLI-FM to Greater Media, a New Jersey-based group broadcaster, who had just acquired WGSM (740 AM) in Huntington. Greater Media paid just $90,000 dollars ($665,000 2013 money) for the facility which was renamed WGSM-FM and began simulcasting WGSM (AM) with transmitter and antenna remaining at the WGLI complex. = Smithtown and soft sounds (1970‚Äì1990) = The arrangement continued until 1970 when the station moved its transmitter and antenna to a location in Brentwood where it remains to this day. As part of the move, WGSM-FM's COL changed from Babylon to Smithtown. After the move was completed 94.3 became WCTO (\\"WCTO Stereo\\") and began a twenty-year run playing easy listening music and earning top ratings which have never been duplicated by the many incarnations that would follow. (Example: 1975 ARB rating listeners 18-49 10A-3P M-F, WCTO was the number one LI radio station) = Magic, country, and rock (1990‚Äì2010) = In June 1990 a switch to a popular light AC format as WMJC (\\"Magic 94.3\\") under the guidance of Jack Kratoville (now at WLTW), then purchased by WRCN-FM radio in 1994 and simulcast the rock format from 1994-1996. After the rock experiment failed, it began to simulcast its sister station WGSM, which was carrying a country format at the time. WMJC eventually would adopt that format exclusively as \\"Country 94.3\\" when WGSM became Radio Disney. On November 10, 2000, the country format was dropped and WMJC became \\"Island 94-3\\" playing rock hits of the '80's and '90's with Charlie Lombardo (aka \\"Jay Letterman\\" from WALK-FM) as PD. By 2007, the branding changed to \\"94.3 WMJC\\", along with a music mix adjustment to Adult Top 40. = Gen X and The Shark (2010‚Äìpresent) = As mentioned, the station never achieved ratings anywhere near the high water mark set by WCTO and by mid 2010 was hovering in the 1 range. On October 19, 2010 came its sixth call letter change, from WMJC to WIGX, leading to rumors of a format change. Those rumors would prove true on November 5 when, at 4:30 PM, 94.3 began stunting with a montage of music, famous news, and TV snippets from each year from 1985 to 2005. At 5PM, WIGX switched to a \\"Gen X hits\\" format, playing hit music from 1985 to 2005, as \\"94X\\". The first song on 94X was \\"Jump Around\\" by House of Pain. This version of 94.3 failed to achieve higher ratings and that brought about yet another change. At Noon on September 14, 2012, after playing Semisonic's \\"Closing Time\\" , the Star-Spangled Banner, and a brief clip from the trailer for Jaws, WIGX switched to mainstream rock, branded as \\"94.3 The Shark\\", launching with Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\".

Description These colorful snakes are covered in stripes of red, black, and yellow, often with black speckles on each scale. At up to long, this is one of the two largest subspecies of milk snake. Geographic range Milk snakes range throughout the Americas, from Canada south to Ecuador. The Andean subspecies of milk snake occurs in the Andes mountains of Colombia and Venezuela. Habitat Andean milksnakes inhabit high altitude forests and grasslands, up to in elevation. Behavior As mountain dwellers, Andean milk snakes can tolerate much lower temperatures than most snakes. They spend much of the time in burrows or under logs, where they are safe from predators and from cold weather. Milk snakes often come out of their dens in the afternoon or evening to hunt. Life history Females may lay up to four clutches of eggs per year, with 12 - 20 eggs per clutch. Hatchlings are 8 - 10 inches long, but reach an adult length of 38 to 70 inches. The captive lifespan can be more than 15 years. Diet Like all snakes, Andean milk snakes are carnivores. Young milk snakes mostly eat insects, while larger milk snakes eat small mammals, birds, eggs, amphibians, and other reptiles, including venomous snakes. Like most snakes, milk snakes only need to eat once every one or two weeks. Coral snake mimics Unlike most nonvenomous snakes, which are mottled gray and brown for camouflage, Andean milk snakes are brilliantly colored (although adults are often duller than juveniles, having an almost dusky appearance) in red, yellow, and black. The white and red scales are frequently clearly tipped with black. It has white scales on its snout with black sutures and often a large amount of white on the cheeks. It has 24 to 32 red rings which may be broken up with black in the mid-dorsal section and the rings may not completely cross the venter. These bright colors are similar to those of the coral snake, a venomous elapid (which includes cobras and mambas) that lives in the same areas as the milk snakes. Andean milk snakes use this bright coloration to fool potential predators into believing that they are also venomous, and too risky to eat. There are several rhymes to help people remember the color difference between harmless milk snakes and the poisonous coral snake. Two rhymes that describe the stripe pattern of these snakes are: \\"Black 'round yellow, harmless fellow. Yellow 'round black, stay far back.\\" \\"Red touches black, you're O.K. Jack. Red touches yellow, you're a dead fellow.\\" Conservation status Not listed on CITES or the IUCN Red List of Threatened and Endangered Species. Little is known about the wild population of Andean milk snakes, but they are thought to be common. These docile, colorful snakes are widely bred in captivity for the pet trade.

The rocks take their name from a gun battery that was situated there from 1740, following a petition by Penzance Borough council for protection from French naval attacks. The rocks are the setting for the Penzance war memorial and the restored Grade II Listed Jubilee Pool, an art deco lido, one of the very few surviving and described in the listing notes as one of the finest examples. People swim from the rocks daily throughout the year. Geography The east wall of Jubilee Pool Battery Rocks and the adjacent tidal beach, a favourite local spot, are an integral part of the Pen Sans‚ÄîHoly Headland‚Äîafter which Penzance is named, having been the site of the original Medieval Church. Battery Rocks have been a location for winter swimmers from at least the 1880s as was mentioned in an 1881 edition of The Cornishman newspaper, which described the practice of the annual Boxing Day swim being enjoyed by the ‚Ä≥all-year-round‚Ä≥ bathers. The rocks are on the northern shore of Mount's Bay, and along with the headland, provide shelter for Penzance harbour from the prevailing south-west winds. A rock on the most easterly point is called Carn Olven and on the western side are the Chimney Rocks. Four thousand years ago the sea-level was lower and either side of Battery Rocks, on the beaches at Ponsandane (to the east) and Wherrytown (west), evidence of a ‚Ä≤submerged forest‚Ä≤ can be seen at low tide in the form of several partially fossilised tree trunks. Artefacts dating from the Mesolithic (10,000 to 5,000 BCE) have been found indicating some occupation contemporary with the forest. The submerged forest in the intertidal area between Wherrytown and Long Rock is of national importance and is a Cornwall Geology Site. They are also home to a variety of wildlife including a colony of rare purple sandpiper (Calidris maritima) which shows a preference for rocky shores. Most of the sandpipers wintering in Cornwall are probably from the Canadian arctic and the rejection of the proposed development of Penzance harbour (see below), reduced the threat to the local flock. History In June 1739 war seemed imminent with France, and a Petition for great guns was sent to the Government by the Corporation of Penzance, which was answered on the condition that a battery was built to house them. The Corporation's accounts for 1740 record the spending of almost ¬£200 on clay, lime, stone and labour, and the guns were in place by November 1740. Of the Battery, Craig Weatherhill, local historian and archaeologist wrote: > \\"The 18th century gun battery site is in fact a good deal older than that > and is almost certainly the site mentioned in the report to King Philip of > Spain written by Don Carlos de Amezola, commanding officer of the fleet of > four Spanish warships that raided Mousehole, Newlyn and Penzance in August > 1595.‚Ä≥ Captain de Amezola wrote the following words in this report: > ‚Ä≥At the same time, the sergeant major Juan de Arnica, on the order of > Captain Carlos de Amezola, went with twelve musketeers and arquebusiers in a > launch to capture the piece of artillery that was in the fort in Penzance. > Although there were English (sic) men who came to its defence, the sergeant > major got the piece on board and brought it to the flagship‚Ä≥. No other gun battery site is known on the coast at Penzance and this is almost certainly the Battery Rocks site that is the subject of this report. In December 1880 officers and men of the Royal Artillery, based in Saltash, removed the guns from the ‚Ä≥Eastern Promenade Battery‚Ä≥. In May 1880 the secretary of the Penzance Swimming Association met with the Town Council with a view to improve the facilities for bathers. By July a concrete path covered the most jagged portion of the rocks and the worst of the ‚Ä≥unslightly and objectional stagnant pools‚Ä≥ had been filled. The Cornishman newspaper reported that the ‚Ä≥... early and all-the-year round bathers had their accustomed dip and breakfast on the morning of Boxing day‚Ä≥. By 1882, Mr Hodgson Pascoe was a veteran of forty years. The Penzance War Memorial was unveiled in 1922 on the site of the old battery and any remaining signs of the battery would have disappeared under the Jubilee Pool (bathing pool) completed in 1935. During the second world war the road and bathing pool was fenced and became an anti- aircraft battery operated by the army and Home Guard. In 2009 the rocks came under threat from the \\"Route Partnership\\" scheme, which intended to transform this location into a freight yard for the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company. It became the subject of much local campaigning, however despite objections the controversial scheme achieved planning consent. Ultimately the project was halted by the Dept of Transport who refused to fund the project. =Jubilee Pool= Opened in May 1935 the bathing pool (or lido) was designed by the Penzance Borough Engineer, Captain F Latham. The lido has a triangular plan, built on rock and juts into the sea. It is made of painted concrete, moulded into a series of Art Deco curves. From the entrance at road level stepped terraces descend to the pool and there is a small shallower children's pool in the War Memorial corner. The Pool is a Grade II listed building and named the Jubilee Pool due to it opening in the year of King George V's Silver Jubilee. By 1992 the pool became dilapidated and following repairs reopened in 1994. In February 2014 there were severe storms which damaged the structure and other serious structural issues were found. Repairs over the next two years cost ¬£2.94 million and the pool reopened in May 2016.

Most of the population of 3000 live in villages clustered along the southwestern shores of Collingwood Bay with an outlier (Uwe) on Cape Nelson. Far from roads and markets, villagers subsist mainly from the land and sea, making extensive use of rain forest for swidden (slash and burn) gardens, hunting and materials for houses and canoes. Despite the 'traditional' appearance of villages, however, the Maisin have long been integrated into the larger Papua New Guinea society. Schools, initially set up by the Anglican mission and now run by the government, have existed in the villages since 1902 and today almost all adults can communicate in at least basic English as well as Tok Pisin and their own Maisin language. A quarter or more of the population now lives in urban areas elsewhere in the country and their remittances form an essential part of the local economy. The Maisin are best known internationally for their exquisitely designed painted bark cloth (tapa cloth). Recent problems and actions During the 1990s, Maisin aligned themselves with a number of environmental non governmental organizations, most notably Greenpeace, in opposition to commercial logging in the rainforests behind their villages and to foster small scale, environmentally friendly, development. Their quixotic fight against a logging company, which had illegally claimed access to their lands, garnered a great deal of international attention up to 2002, when the Maisin defeated the company in a national court case. Despite this victory, the area continues to be eyed by logging and mining interests and the community is divided in their support or opposition to large scale 'development' projects in the region. In November 2007, the Maisin villages along with much of Oro Province were hit by devastating floods that destroyed gardens and undermined many houses. Notes John Barker.

They are composed of three layers of gelatin, each containing an emulsion of silver halide, which is used as a light-sensitive material, and a different dye coupler of subtractive color which together, when developed, form a full-color image.  History  Figure from patent US2113329A, issued by Kodak, describing a photographic color process using color-coupling substances, such as the ones used in a chromogenic print. Developing color by using oxidized developers was first suggested by German chemist Benno Homolka who, in 1907, successfully developed insoluble indigo-blue and red dyes on a latent image by oxidizing indoxyl and thio-indoxyl respectively. He additionally noted these developers could create beautiful photographic effects. The potential of oxidized developers in a color photographic process however, was first realized by another German chemist, Rudolf Fischer, who, in 1912, filed a patent describing a chromogenic process to develop both positives and negatives using indoxyl, and thio-indoxyl-based color developers as dye couplers in a light-sensitive silver halide emulsion. The following year he filed a patent listing various color developers and dye couplers, which have historically been used in Agfachrome and are still in use today in Fujichrome Velvia and Provia, and Ektachrome. In spite of this, Fischer never created a successful color print due to his inability to prevent the dye couplers from moving between the emulsion layers. This first solution to this problem, found by Agfa workers Gustav Wilmanns and Wilhelm Schneider, who created a print made of three layers of gelatin containing subtractive color dye couplers made of long hydrocarbon chains, and carboxylic or sulfonic acid. This turned the dye couplers into micelles which can easily be scattered in the gelatin while loosely tethering to it.:698 Agfa patented both the developer for this print and its photographic process, and promptly developed and released in 1936 Agfacolor Neu, the first chromogenic print, which was a color print film that could be developed using a transparency.:698 Agfa developed a chromogenic negative film by 1939, which could be developed directly on a companion paper to the film, although this film was never commercialized. Kodak too worked to solve the issue of the dye couplers movement, and found a different solution. They used ionic insoluble carbon chains which were shorter than Agfa's for their dye couplers, which were suspended within droplets of water in the gelatin layers of the print. In 1942, Kodak released Kodacolor, the first published chromogenic color print film that could be developed from a negative. It became the cheaper and simpler to develop counterpart to the alternatives at the time, and could be used in the simplest of cameras. Due to their simple development process and their cheap price, chromogenic printing became wildly popular in amateur photography, and by the 1960s it overtook black and white printing in the amateur photofinishing market. In 1955, Kodak introduced a chromogenic paper named \\"Type C\\", which was the first color negative paper Kodak sold to other labs and individual photographers. Although the paper's name was changed to \\"Kodak Ektacolor Paper\\" in 1958, the terminology \\"Type-C Print\\" persisted, and has become a popular term for chromogenic prints made from negatives still in use today, with the name \\"Type-R Print\\" becoming its reversal film counterpart. Notwithstanding the success of chromogenic prints in the amateur and professional market, it wasn't considered a medium for fine-art photography up to the 1970s. The pioneers in the use of chromogenic prints and in the use of color photography as a whole in fine-art were photographers such as Ernst Haas, which was profiled by the Museum of Modern Art in its first exhibition of color photography in 1962.:257 Other pioneering fine-art color photographers who printed their photographs on chromogenic prints include William Eggleston:251 and Stephen Shore. Their works, and those of many others, caused chromogenic prints to become the preferred medium for contemporary photography by the 1990s. Chromogenic prints made from negatives became obsolete with the release of chromogenic digital prints, which have become the most common photographic print today.  Development of prints  Chromogenic processes are characterized by a reaction between two chemicals to create the color dyes that make up a print. After exposure, the silver image is developed (or reduced) by a color developer. In its reaction to the print, the color developer is oxidized in the areas of exposed silver, and subsequently reacts with another chemical, the dye coupler, which is present throughout the emulsion. Different dye couplers are used in each of the three layers, so the reaction forms a different colored dye in each layer. Responding to both exposure and development, a blue-light-sensitive layer forms yellow dye, a green-light-sensitive layer forms magenta dye, and a red- light-sensitive layer forms cyan dye. The remaining silver and silver compounds are then bleached out, leaving a color image composed of dyes in three layers. The exposure of a chromogenic print may be accomplished with a traditional photographic enlarger using color filters to adjust the color balance of the print. The print's name is derived from the chromogenic reaction between the dye coupler and the oxidized color developer.  Chromogenic print today  Chromogenic prints, like most color photographic prints, are developed using the RA-4 process. , the major lines of professional chromogenic print paper are Kodak Endura and Fujifilm Crystal Archive. Plastic chromogenic \\"papers\\" such as Kodak Duratrans and Duraclear are used for producing backlit advertising and art. Reversal film prints A reversal film chromogenic print, also known as a Type-R print, is a positive- to-positive photographic print made on reversal-type color photographic paper. Fujifilm, Kodak, and Agfa have historically manufactured paper and chemicals for the R-3 process, a chromogenic process for making Type-R prints. , all of these companies have ceased to produce Type R paper, although Fujifilm still has some stocks remaining. Another positive-to-positive process is Ilfochrome, which is sometimes also referred to as a Type-R process. Ilfochrome is a dye destruction process, with materials, processing, and results quite different from the R-3 process.  Digital chromogenic prints  A digital chromogenic print, sometimes known as digital Type-C print, Lambda print or LightJet print, is a chromogenic print made from a digital file rather than a negative, and exposed using digital exposure systems such as the Durst Lambda, Oc√© LightJet and ZBE Chromira. The LightJet and the Lambda both use RGB lasers to expose light-sensitive material to produce a latent image that is then developed using conventional silver-based photographic chemicals. The Chromira uses light-emitting diodes (LEDs) instead of lasers. All of the aforementioned printers utilize ICC color profiles to achieve color and density accuracy and also to correct paper sensitivity errors. The same technology can also be used to produce digital silver gelatin bromide black and white prints.

He developed the carbon dioxide laser in 1963; it is now widely used in industry for cutting and welding, as a laser scalpel in surgery, and in laser skin resurfacing. Because the atmosphere is quite transparent to infrared light, CO2 lasers are also used for military rangefinding using LIDAR techniques. Patel was born in Baramati, India, and received a Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) degree from the Government College of Engineering, the University of Pune, India and the M.S. and PhD in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1959 and 1961, respectively. Patel joined Bell Laboratories in 1961, and subsequently became Executive Director of the Research, Materials Science, Engineering and Academic Affairs Division at AT&T; Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, where he developed the carbon dioxide laser. Patel's discovery, in 1963, of the laser action on the vibrational-rotational transitions of carbon dioxide and his discovery, in 1964, of efficient vibrational energy transfer between molecules, led to a series of experiments which demonstrated that the carbon dioxide laser was capable of very high continuous-wave and pulsed power output at very high conversion efficiencies. From 1993‚Äì1999, Patel served as vice chancellor for research at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he is also professor of physics and adjunct professor of electrical engineering. In 1996, President Bill Clinton awarded Patel the National Medal of Science, \\"[f]or his fundamental contributions to quantum electronics and invention of the carbon dioxide laser, which have had significant impact on industrial, scientific, medical, and defense applications.\\" In addition to the carbon dioxide laser, he also developed the \\"spin-flip\\" infrared Raman laser.

It was announced that only 9 students had enrolled for the upcoming entering class, and that the school needed an additional $1.5 million in order to get through the coming school year.

In 1866, he was nominated and confirmed for appointment to the grades of brevet brigadier general and major general in the Regular Army (United States) for valor in several battles, to rank from March 13, 1865. In a career that spanned more than forty years, Buchanan held numerous commands (including several forts) and received multiple citations for bravery and distinguished service. Family and early life Buchanan was born in Baltimore, Maryland the son of Andrew Buchanan and Carolina Johnson. Buchanan was of Scottish ancestry. His grandfather, Andrew, served in the American Revolution as a brigadier general in the Maryland Militia. He was the nephew by marriage of President John Quincy Adams; his mother's sister was First Lady Louisa Adams. Early military career Buchanan received his appointment to United States Military Academy at West Point during Adams' administration and graduated in 1830. He was soon assigned to the 4th U.S. Infantry as a brevet second lieutenant. His assignments included service in the Black Hawk War (he commanded gunboats during the Battle of Bad Axe) and against the Seminoles, as well as in the removal of the Cherokees to the Indian Territory. He was promoted to captain during his service in Florida.Warner, 1964, p.48 Buchanan participated in the Mexican War in command of the Maryland Volunteers. He was in the Battle of Chapultepec, the Battle of Palo Alto, the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, the Battle of Molino del Rey, and the capture of Mexico City. For his service in Mexico, Buchanan was twice brevetted in recognition of his gallantry in action. In 1847 Buchanan became a veteran member of the Aztec Club of 1847 ‚Äì a military society of officers who had served in the Mexican War. After the war, Buchanan was assigned to various posts and recruiting duty. In 1853, the 4th Infantry was assigned to the Pacific coast in northern California. He established Fort Humboldt which served as a buffer between settlers, prospectors and Native Americans. Under his command was Captain Ulysses S. Grant. When Grant's drinking allegedly began to affect his duties, Buchanan allegedly asked for and received Grant's resignation from the Army.There is some controversy as to whether this occurred. Buchanan had a reputation as a martinet and had a previous run-in with Grant when they were both at Jefferson Barracks. When Grant was assigned to staff as a quartermaster, he had little dealings with Buchanan. That is, until he went back to line as a company commander and was again under Buchanan's command. It is known that Grant was extremely unhappy at Fort Humboldt. There may have been any number of reasons for Grant's resignation: chafing under Buchanan's petty rules, loneliness, boredom, and/or depression.

In 1855, Buchanan was promoted to major. He commanded the District of Southern Oregon and Northern California from Fort Humboldt, and participated in the Rogue River Wars in Oregon. Civil War Buchanan was stationed in San Francisco, California, at the beginning of the Civil War. He was ordered east, and his regiment was placed in the defenses surrounding Washington, D.C. He was given command of brigade in Skye's division, serving there until the Spring of 1862. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the regular army on September 9, 1861 and given command of a brigade in what became the Army of the Potomac.Eicher, 2001, p.151. In the summer of 1862 Buchanan served with distinction in Seven Days Battles and was twice brevetted.Warner, 1964, p.49 He participated in the Peninsula Campaign, including the Battle of Yorktown, and the Seven Days Battles, including the Battle of Gaines' Mill, the Battle of Glendale, and the Battle of Malvern Hill. He then fought in the Northern Virginia Campaign in the Second Battle of Bull Run.Cullum biography of Buchanan Buchanan, by then nicknamed \\"Old Buck\\" by his men, commanded the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, V Corps during the Maryland Campaign (part of Brigadier General George Sykes's Regulars). At Antietam, Buchanan strongly protested a decision to halt his advance on what he maintained was a weakly defended portion of the enemy line. In his opinion, his Regulars could have and should have carried Cemetery Hill, defended primarily by artillery with only the depleted Virginia brigade of Richard B. Garnett in support. Buchanan was appointed brigadier general of volunteers on November 29, 1862, but his appointment expired on March 4, 1863, having not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Historian Ezra Warner suggests that Buchanan's association with Fitz John Porter was the reason for the Senate's inaction on the nomination. Since the expired brigadier general appointment was Buchanan's only volunteer appointment, he reverted to his Regular Army grade of lieutenant colonel and brevet colonel and was not in the volunteer force.Warner, 1964, p.616 Shortly after this appointment, and before its expiration, Buchanan commanded regulars and fought at the Battle of Antietam and at the Battle of Fredericksburg in 1862. Buchanan then went on recruiting duty and two months later was placed in command of the defenses of Fort Delaware, a prisoner of war facility, March-April, 1863.Warner, 1964, pp. 48-49. He then was assistant provost marshal general at Trenton, New Jersey, April 29, 1863-November 8, 1864. On February 8, 1864, he was promoted to colonel of the 1st U.S. Infantry Regiment through seniority.The overlap is not contradictory as many officers were on detached service during the Civil War. For his service at the Battle of Malvern Hill, on April 10, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Buchanan for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general, U.S. Army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on May 4, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 732. In recognition of Buchanan's service at the Battle of Second Bull Run and the Battle of Fredericksburg, on June 30, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Buchanan for appointment to the grade of brevet major general, U.S. Army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 25, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 706 Postbellum After the war, as colonel in the Regular Army, Buchanan was placed in command of the 1st U.S. Infantry at New Orleans and helped enforce Reconstruction activities with his men. He subsequently commanded the Department of Louisiana, and then served in the Freedmen's Bureau. A further nomination of Buchanan to brigadier general, October 15, 1868, was tabled by the U. S. Senate and not acted upon. He retired from the Army on December 31, 1870. At the time of his retirement, he was in command of Fort Porter in New York. Robert C. Buchanan died in Washington, D.C., on November 29, 1878 and is buried at the Rock Creek Cemetery.

It is often abbreviated as PhNHNH2.  Properties  Phenylhydrazine forms monoclinic prisms that melt to an oil around room temperature which may turn yellow to dark red upon exposure to air. Phenylhydrazine is miscible with ethanol, diethyl ether, chloroform and benzene. It is sparingly soluble in water.  Preparation  Phenylhydrazine is prepared by oxidizing aniline with sodium nitrite in the presence of hydrogen chloride to form the diazonium salt, which is subsequently reduced using sodium sulfite in the presence of sodium hydroxide to form the final product.Merck Index of Chemicals and Drugs, 9th ed. monograph 7098  History  Phenylhydrazine was the first hydrazine derivative characterized, reported by Hermann Emil Fischer in 1875.Nobel Committee Emil Fischer - BiographicalFischer, E. (1875) \\"Ueber aromatische Hydrazinverbindungen,\\" Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft, 8: 589-594. He prepared it by reduction of a phenyl diazonium salt using sulfite salts. Fischer used phenylhydrazine to characterize sugars via formation of hydrazones known as osazones with the sugar aldehyde. He also demonstrated in this first paper many of the key properties recognized for hydrazines.  Uses  Phenyl-hydrazine is used to prepare indoles by the Fischer indole synthesis, which are intermediates in the synthesis of various dyes and pharmaceuticals. Phenylhydrazine is used to form phenylhydrazones of natural mixtures of simple sugars in order to render the differing sugars easily separable from each other. This molecule is also used to induce acute hemolytic anemia in animal models.  Safety  Exposure to phenylhydrazine may cause contact dermatitis, hemolytic anemia, and liver damage.

In graph theory, multiple edges (also called parallel edges or a multi-edge), are, in an undirected graph, two or more edges that are incident to the same two vertices, or in a directed graph, two or more edges with both the same tail vertex and the same head vertex. A simple graph has no multiple edges. Depending on the context, a graph may be defined so as to either allow or disallow the presence of multiple edges (often in concert with allowing or disallowing loops): *Where graphs are defined so as to allow multiple edges and loops, a graph without loops is often called a multigraph.For example, see Balakrishnan, p. 1, and Gross (2003), p. 4, Zwillinger, p. 220. *Where graphs are defined so as to disallow multiple edges and loops, a multigraph or a pseudograph is often defined to mean a \\"graph\\" which can have loops and multiple edges.For example, see Bollob√°s, p. 7; Diestel, p. 28; Harary, p. 10. Multiple edges are, for example, useful in the consideration of electrical networks, from a graph theoretical point of view.Bollob√°s, pp. 39-40. Additionally, they constitute the core differentiating feature of multidimensional networks. A planar graph remains planar if an edge is added between two vertices already joined by an edge; thus, adding multiple edges preserves planarity.Gross (1998), p. 308. A dipole graph is a graph with two vertices, in which all edges are parallel to each other.  Notes References * Balakrishnan, V.

The Independent, 25 October 2006  History  DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) of the United States pioneered research into the field of energy harvesting from vibrations, wanting to reduce the use of heavy rechargeable batteries that power communication devices carried by soldiers into battlefields. Most of the research was spent in development of \\"heel-strike\\" generators, powered by the pumping motion of a footstep, which would be embedded within a heel of an army boot. They succeeded in achieving upwards of 3 - 6 watts of power output.  Design  There were two design prototypes considered. The first was a staircase that would contain either hydraulic or piezoelectric mechanisms within the steps to absorb the kinetic energy from stairclimbers' footfalls and convert it into electricity. This method was believed to more efficient as more energy is expended by the commuters to ascend a staircase. The second design was a wireless system of lighting that would use tiny generators with components designed to resonate at the same frequency of surrounding vibrations. The resonance would then either move a tiny magnet relative to a coil of wire looped around it or apply pressure to a crystal inside the generator to create current. Light-emitting diodes or LEDs connected to such vibration harvesters could be used to illuminate areas where constant heavy vibration is present, such as train or metro stations, airports or highways. This system would have enabled lighting without any cables or wires connected to the power grid.

The \\"Martyrologium Hieronymianum\\" (ed. G. B. de Rossi-L. Duchesne, 77) gives under June 9 the names of Primus and Felician who were buried at the fourteenth milestone of the Via Nomentana (near Nomentum, now Mentana). They were evidently from Nomentum. This notice comes from the catalogue of Roman martyrs of the fourth century. Burial They appear to be the first martyrs of whom it is recorded that their bodies were subsequently reburied within the walls of Rome. In 648 Pope Theodore I translated the bones of the two saints (together with the remains of his father) to the Church of Santo Stefano Rotondo, under an altar erected in their honor (Liber Pontificalis, I, 332), where they remain. The Chapel of Ss. Primo e Feliciano contains mosaics from the 7th century. The chapel was built by Pope Theodore I. One mosaic shows the martyrs St Primus and St Felician flanking a crux gemmata (jeweled cross). Other depictions of the saints can be found at Venice, in the St Mark's Basilica (13th century) and at Palermo, Sicily, in the Cappella Palatina (12th century). Veneration Their feast day is 9 June. In the past they were also included in the General Roman Calendar, but because of the limited worldwide interest in them, it was decided in 1969 to leave to individual dioceses the decision whether to include them in their local calendars.Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 125 =Veneration in Bavaria= A Bavarian tradition holds that Sts Primus and Felician were Roman legionaries who became missionaries in the region of Chiemgau, where Primus found in a forest a fountain with curative properties. The two brothers preached the Gospel there and cured the sick by virtue of their prayers and the virtue of the source. When they returned to Italy, they were martyred under Diocletian. The fountain, known as the Fountain of Saint Primus, can still be seen at Adelholzen, an area of hot springs where a chapel constructed in 1615 can be found, dedicated to these saints, who are much venerated in the area. =Veneration at Agen= During the 9th century, the cult of Saint Faith was fused with that of Caprasius of Agen (Caprais) and Alberta of Agen, also associated with Agen.Alban Butler, David Hugh Farmer, Paul Burns, Butler's Lives of the Saints (Liturgical Press, 2000), 139. Caprasius' cult in turn was fused with that of Primus and Felician, who are called Caprasius' brothers.St. Caprasius - Saints & Angels - Catholic Online One legend states that during the persecutions of Christians by the prefect Dacian, Caprasius fled to Mont- Saint-Vincent, near Agen. He witnessed the execution of Faith from atop the hill. Caprasius was condemned to death, and was joined on his way to execution by Alberta, Faith‚Äôs sister (also identified as Caprasius' mother), and two brothers, named Primus and Felician. All four were beheaded. Acts Martyrdom of Saints Primus and Felician Their \\"Acts\\" relate that Sts Felician and Primus were brothers and patricians who had converted to Christianity and devoted themselves to caring for the poor and visiting prisoners. Arrested, they both refused to sacrifice to the public gods. They were imprisoned and scourged. They were brought separately before the judge Promotus, who tortured them together and endeavored to deceive them that the other had apostatized by offering sacrifice. This had no effect on the brothers, and the two were subsequently beheaded under the Emperor Diocletian at Nomentum (12 miles from Rome).\\"Lives of the Saints, For Every Day of the Year,\\" edited by Rev.

He attended Harborfields Highschool in Huntington, Long Island. He played collegiate lacrosse at the University of Massachusetts. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest lacrosse players of all time. Millon was a college player at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he gained honors as a three-time All-American (twice on the first team), leading UMass to three births in the NCAA tournament. After college, he moved to Baltimore and where he played alongside his brother Tony Millon while leading the Mount Washington Wolfpack to several US Club Lacrosse championships. During his time on the Wolfpack, he often relied upon his superior speed and agility to isolate one defenseman before dodging around him to score. This talent was noticed by the US Lacrosse World team coaches which included Millon on two rosters, earning a spot as one of the World‚Äôs Best Attackman in 1998, the overall World Games MVP in the 1994 World Games, as well as being named to the All-World Team in 1994 and 1998. He joined the Baltimore Bayhawks in 2001 and played with them until 2005 when he was traded to the Boston Cannons. He rejoined the Baltimore Bayhawks for the 2006 season, and played one game in the beginning of the 2007 season before announcing he would not play the remainder of the season due to other commitments. Later, in the season he joined the Long Island Lizards organization. He retired again after the 2007 season as the league's all-time leading scorer. Millon was selected in the 2013 MLL Supplemental Draft after announcing his return to the MLL after a five-season absence. He was selected first by the Rochester Rattlers and made his Rattlers debut on April 27, 2013 with a one goal-one-assist performance. Mark also played nine seasons in the indoor National Lacrosse League. He played for the New York Saints, Baltimore Thunder, Syracuse Smash, and Philadelphia Wings. For 14 years, Mark has run the Millon International Lacrosse Camps, long considered the nation's top instructional lacrosse camp. His camp enrollment is nearly double that of the second biggest camps in the country. In 2009, Millon was inducted into the National Lacrosse Hall of Fame. Mark Millon Coached and was Director of Player and Coach Development for the Baltimore Breakers Club Lacrosse program from 2013 to 2014.

Worrell was later replaced by various other bassists, including Reggie Workman, Finn Von Eyben, Harold Dodson, Eddie G√≥mez, Steve Swallow, and Buell Neidlinger. All About Jazz reviewer Clifford Allen wrote that the group \\"cut some of the most powerful music in the free jazz underground.\\" In November 1962, Tchicai moved from his home country of Denmark to New York City at the suggestion of Archie Shepp and Bill Dixon, whom he had met at the Helsinki Jazz Festival earlier that year. Upon arriving in New York, Tchicai began playing with Dixon's group, which included Shepp and Roswell Rudd among others, and also sat in with Don Cherry and various other musicians. By the summer of 1963, Tchicai, Shepp, and Cherry had formed the New York Contemporary Five with bassist Don Moore and drummer J. C. Moses, while Rudd, with Shepp, continued to play with Dixon. According to Rudd, the idea of forming a new quartet originated with Tchicai, and the two began playing in filmmaker Michael Snow's loft space with Moore and Moses. Moses soon left as a result of mutual dissatisfaction with his role, and Rudd and Tchicai were soon introduced to drummer Milford Graves by saxophonist Giuseppi Logan. Tchicai recalled: \\"this was a very pleasant surprise and more than that, because Graves simply baffled both Rudd and I in that we, at that time, hadn't heard anybody of the younger musicians in New York that had the same sense of rhythmic cohesion in poly-rhythmics or the same sense of intensity and musicality.\\" Graves \\"wound up playing with them for half an hour, astonishing Rudd and Tchicai, who promptly invited him to join what became The New York Art Quartet.\\" Graves later stated that his invitation to join the group came \\"at a time when the evolutive phases of my spiritual and creative potential were in need of being expressed without limitation.\\" However, Tchicai also recalled that \\"bassist Don Moore became so frightened of this wizard of a percussionist that he decided that this couldn't be true or possible and, therefore, refused to play with us,\\" and the group brought in bassist Lewis Worrell in his place. In July 1964, Tchicai and Rudd briefly joined Albert Ayler's quartet, which consisted of Ayler, Cherry, Gary Peacock, and Sunny Murray, to record New York Eye and Ear Control, the soundtrack for a film by Michael Snow. That fall, the NYAQ, calling themselves \\"The John Tchicai Quartet,\\" played their debut concert, participating in the \\"October Revolution in Jazz\\" organized by Bill Dixon. In November, the NYAQ recorded their first album as part of ESP Disk's original roster of jazz artists, and a month later they performed at the Dixon-organized festival \\"Four Days in December\\" as the \\"Roswell Rudd - John Tchicai Quartet,\\" playing opposite Sun Ra at Judson Hall. The group's second album, Mohawk, was recorded in July 1965 with Reggie Workman on bass (Worrell left the group in December 1964), and was released on the Fontana label. In the fall of 1965, Tchicai lined up dates for the NYAQ in Copenhagen, Gothenburg (Sweden), Hilversum (Holland), and Amsterdam (where they opened for Ornette Coleman's group), with Finn Von Eyben playing bass and Louis Moholo playing drums as a result of scheduling issues with the original musicians. Recordings from this tour were released in 2010 on the album Old Stuff. The group broke up in February 1966, with Tchicai returning to Denmark. On June 13, 1999, the NYAQ, with Workman on bass, reunited for a performance at the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, opening for Sonic Youth. Amiri Baraka, whose poem \\"Black Dada Nihlismus\\" was included on their debut album 35 years earlier, also appeared. The group recorded the album 35th Reunion the following day. In 2000 they played the Paris Banlieues Blues Festival, followed by a performance at the Lisboa festival in 2001. In 2013, after Tchicai's death, Triple Point Records released a limited-edition five-LP box set, along with a 156-page coffee-table book and miscellaneous artifacts, entitled Call It Art. According to Tchicai, one of the most unique aspects of the NYAQ was \\"the polyphonic part of the music that came into play; the whole collective style of playing that also existed in New Orleans Jazz and classical music. The polyphonic aspect of our music was something quite new compared to what other people were doing in contemporary jazz.\\" David Toop described the group's signature sound as \\"deliberately ragged, bleary themes tumbling out in spasms, notes tailing away as if lost to daydream, the music so open that total collapse seems perpetually imminent.\\" In his liner notes to Mohawk, Tchicai wrote: \\"The important thing about our music is that it must be heard and listened to without preconceived ideas as to how jazz should sound ‚Äì listen to it as MUSIC and let that be the only label!\\" A documentary on the NYAQ, entitled The Breath Courses Through Us, was released in 2013 by director Alan Roth.

He was also one of the band's lead singers and chief songwriters. Before NRBQ he played in several bands, including The Seven of Us, which in 1967 while in Miami, Florida, met another band, The Mersey-Beats USA. The bands merged to form NRBQ. On the group's first two albums, NRBQ (Columbia, 1969) and Boppin' the Blues (With Carl Perkins, Columbia, 1970) Spampinato is credited as \\"Jody St. Nicholas.\\" Spampinato, known for getting an acoustic, stand-up bass sound out of his instrument; played bass on many albums including Keith Richards' album Talk Is Cheap, Bonnie Raitt's Fundamental, and was one of the bassists on Eric Clapton's 24 Nights in 1991. His songs have been covered by Bonnie Raitt, Shakin' Stevens, Los Lobos, Dave Edmunds and others. In 1986, Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones invited Spampinato to play in the band Richards put together to back up Chuck Berry for the rock legend's 60th birthday party concert, which was recorded for the 1987 documentary Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll. NRBQ bandmate and co-founder Terry Adams wrote the song \\"Spampinato\\" in celebration of his friend's family name; the song appeared on the band's 1994 album Message for the Mess Age. Spampinato appeared with NRBQ in several feature films and television shows. During his tenure with NRBQ, he and bandmates Johnny Spampinato, Adams and Tom Ardolino were featured in animated form on an episode of The Simpsons. The group served as the unofficial \\"house band\\" for The Simpsons for the season 10-12 period during which time longtime NRBQ fan Mike Scully was head writer and executive producer of the show. Several of NRBQ's songs were featured on The Simpsons, including \\"Mayonnaise and Marmalade\\", which was written specifically for the show. The band also appeared in non-animated form on camera during the end credits to perform the show's theme song during the episode \\"Take My Wife, Sleaze\\". NRBQ also recorded a song entitled \\"Birdman\\" for an episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast entitled \\"Pilot\\". The same lineup also appeared in motion pictures, including Day of the Dead, Shakes the Clown, and 28 Days. When the NRBQ stopped touring and recording in 2004 due to Adams diagnosis of throat cancer, Spaminato and his brother, Johnny, continued for a short while with Tom Ardolino in the band Baby Macaroni. In 2008, Spampinato formed a new group called The Spampinato Brothers with his younger brother Johnny Spampinato, who himself toured, recorded and played lead guitar with NRBQ from 1994 until 2008. Johnny replaced NRBQ's previous guitarist Al Anderson, who left the group in 1994 to pursue a career as a songwriter, producer and session player in Nashville. In 2011, The Spampinato Brothers announced the release of their new full-length album, entitled Pie In The Sky, which features eleven songs written by the brothers. During 2012, The Spampinato Brothers embarked on a tour in Japan, showcasing their new material in addition to fan favorites from their years with NRBQ. In 2013, it was announced that they were finishing a new EP, Smiles, which was released later that year under the label Revolve Records. In October 2015, Spampinato was diagnosed with cancer and is undergoing a long term treatment. In 2016, Cape Cod musician Sarah Burrell created a YouCaring fundraiser page to help with the anticipated expenses. While its intended goal was $50,000, it quickly surpassed that raising, as of February 2016, $90,830. Personal life Spampinato lives in Cape Cod, Massachusetts with his wife, Kami Lyle, a singer, songwriter and trumpeter. He was previously married to country star and rockabilly icon Skeeter Davis.

After beginning his professional career in England, he returned to his country, going on to later represent, mainly, Athletic Bilbao. Club career =Refugee in England= Lezama was born in Barakaldo, Biscay but moved to England as a refugee at the age of 14. He entered at the port of Southampton on board the Habana on 23 May 1937, he and his brother Luis being among 3,889 Basque children fleeing the Spanish Civil War;Raimundo P√©rez Lezama, futbolista del Athletic (Raimundo P√©rez Lezama, Athletic footballer); El Pa√≠s, 25 July 2007 (in Spanish) some of the other refugees also became footballers, including Emilio Aldecoa, Sabino Barinaga and Jos√© Gallego. While in Southampton, Lezama played for his school Nazareth House (less than half a mile from The Dell), where he was spotted by Southampton and signed for the club as a trainee, eventually progressing to the reserves before making his first-team debut on 1 June 1940 in a 0‚Äì5 away defeat against Arsenal. His next game was at Craven Cottage, when the \\"Saints\\" fielded five Arsenal players (Ernie Collett, Leslie Compton, Eddie Hapgood, Leslie Jones and Bernard Joy) in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Fulham, with both goals for the victors being scored by local boy Eric Webber despite the plethora of stars. Lezama played one further match, a 1‚Äì3 defeat at Charlton Athletic at the end of an extended wartime season. Despite being underage, he briefly worked as a driver for the Royal Air Force. =Athletic Bilbao= On returning to Spain in 1940, Lezama joined Arenas Club de Getxo in Segunda Divisi√≥n.Lezama, el gran portero del Athletic (Lezama, Athletic's great goalkeeper); Periodista Digital, 24 July 2007 (in Spanish) In 1941 he signed for Athletic Bilbao, and made his La Liga debut on 27 September 1942 in a 5‚Äì0 home win over Real Betis.Atl√©tico 5; Betis 0; Mundo Deportivo, 28 September 1942 (in Spanish) The 1942‚Äì43 season saw the side, with a team that also included Telmo Zarra, Jos√© Luis Panizo and Agust√≠n Ga√≠nza, win a double (league and Copa del Rey); he helped Athletic retain the cup in both 1944 and 1945, winning it again in 1950. While at Bilbao, Lezama also won the Ricardo Zamora Trophy as best goalkeeper during 1946‚Äì47. He added his only cap for Spain on 26 January 1947, when he was a second-half substitute for Jos√© Ba√±√≥n in a 1‚Äì4 away defeat against Portugal. Throughout the rest of his career at Athletic, Lezama was only a squad player, making only 12 league appearances in his last five campaigns combined. After playing 197 league matches (261 in all competitions), he left the club in 1957. =Later career= In 1957, Lezama joined SD Indautxu in the second level, where his teammates included emerging youngsters Jes√∫s Mar√≠a Pereda and Miguel Jones. He spent two further seasons in that tier with Sestao Sport Club, before rejoining first team in Spain Arenas de Getxo in 1960. Lezama died of heart failure in Laguardia, √Ålava, at the age of 84.

This can include purchasing items on-line with a computer or using a smartphone to purchase something at a store. Money can be deposited in the digital wallet prior to any transactions or, in other cases, an individual's bank account can be linked to the digital wallet. Users might also have their driver's license, health card, loyalty card(s) and other ID documents stored within the wallet. The credentials can be passed to a merchant's terminal wirelessly via near field communication (NFC). Increasingly, digital wallets are being made not just for basic financial transactions but to also authenticate the holder's credentials. For example, a digital wallet could verify the age of the buyer to the store while purchasing alcohol. The system has already gained popularity in Japan, where digital wallets are known as \\"wallet mobiles\\". A cryptocurrency wallet is a digital wallet where private keys are stored for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Technology A digital wallet has both a software and information component. Secure and fair electronic payment systems are important issue. The software provides security and encryption for the personal information and for the actual transaction. Typically, digital wallets are stored on the client side and are easily self- maintained and fully compatible with most e-commerce websites. A server-side digital wallet, also known as a thin wallet, is one that an organization creates for and about you and maintains on its servers. Server-side digital wallets are gaining popularity among major retailers due to the security, efficiency, and added utility it provides to the end-user, which increases their satisfaction of their overall purchase. The information component is basically a database of user-input information. This information consists of your shipping address, billing address, payment methods (including credit card numbers, expiry dates, and security numbers), and other information. Digital wallets are composed of both digital wallet devices and digital wallet systems. There are dedicated digital wallet devices such as the biometric wallet by Dunhill, a physical device that holds cash and cards along with a Bluetooth mobile connection. Presently there are further explorations for smartphones with NFC digital wallet capabilities, such as smartphones utilizing Google's Android and Apple's iOS operating systems to power wallets such as Google Pay and Apple Pay. Digital wallet systems enable the widespread use of digital wallet transactions among various retail vendors in the form of mobile payments systems and digital wallet applications. The M-PESA mobile payments system and microfinancing service has widespread use in Kenya and Tanzania, while the MasterCard PayPass application has been adopted by a number of vendors in the U.S. and worldwide. Digital wallets are being used more frequently among Asian countries as well. One in every five consumers in Asia are now using a digital wallet, representing a twofold increase from two years ago. A MasterCard mobile shopping survey among 8500 adults, aged 18‚Äì64 across 14 markets, showed that 45% of users in China, 36.7% of users in India and 23.3% of users in Singapore are the biggest adopters of digital wallets. The survey was conducted between October and December 2015. Further analysis showed that 48.5% of consumers in these regions made purchases using smartphones. Indian consumers are leading the way with 76.4% using a smartphone to make a purchase, which is a drastic increase of 29.3% from the previous year. This has inspired companies like Reliance and Amazon India to come out with their own digital wallet. Flipkart has already introduced its own digital wallet.  Types  There are two types of digital wallets: hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are connected to the internet while cold wallets are not. Most digital wallet holders hold both a hot wallet and a cold wallet. Hot wallets are most often used to make quick payments, while a cold wallet is generally used for storing and holding your money, and has no connection to the internet. Another difference that is apparent when comparing the types of digital wallets, or e-Wallets, is the price. While most hot wallets are free, cold wallets can be expensive. = Security = Along with their different capabilities, these two types of digital wallets also come with a difference in security considerations. As a hot wallet is connected to the internet, they are more susceptible and vulnerable to cyberattacks from hackers. This makes them less secure and open to attack. On the other hand, cold wallets, are much more secure as they do not have an internet connection. Payments for goods and services purchased online A client-side digital wallet requires minimal setup and is relatively easy to use. Once the software is installed, the user begins by entering all the pertinent information. The digital wallet is now set up. At the purchase or check-out page of an e-commerce site, the digital wallet software has the ability to automatically enter the user information in the online form. By default, most digital wallets prompt when the software recognizes a form in which it can fill out; if one chooses to fill out the form automatically, the user will be prompted for a password. This keeps unauthorized users away from viewing personal information stored on a particular computer. =ECML= Digital wallets are designed to be accurate when transferring data to retail checkout forms; however, if a particular e-commerce site has a peculiar checkout system, the digital wallet may fail to properly recognize the form's fields. This problem has been eliminated by sites and wallet software that use Electronic Commerce Modeling Language (ECML) technology. Electronic Commerce Modeling Language is a protocol that dictates how online retailers structure and set up their checkout forms. Security Consumers are not required to fill out order forms on each site when they purchase an item because the information has already been stored and is automatically updated and entered into the order fields across merchant sites when using a digital wallet. Consumers also benefit when using digital wallets because their information is encrypted or protected by a private software code; merchants benefit by receiving a combination of protection against fraud, faster receipt of payment, decreased transaction costs, and decreased theft loss. Digital wallets are available to consumers free of charge, and they're fairly easy to obtain. For example, when a consumer makes a purchase at a merchant site that's set up to handle server- side digital wallets, they type their name, payment and shipping information into the merchant's own form. At the end of the purchase, the consumer is asked to sign up for a wallet of their choice by entering a user name and password for future purchases. Users can also acquire wallets at a wallet vendor's site. Although a wallet is free for consumers, vendors charge merchants for wallets. Some wallet vendors make arrangements for merchants to pay them a percentage of every successful purchase directed through their wallets. In other cases, digital wallet vendors process the transactions between cardholders and participating merchants and charge merchants a flat fee. Advantages for e-commerce sites Upwards of 25% of online shoppers abandon their order due to frustration in filling in forms.Graphic Arts Monthly, 1999 The digital wallet combats this problem by giving users the option to transfer their information securely and accurately. This simplified approach to completing transactions results in better usability and ultimately more utility for the customer. Digital Wallets can also increase the security of the transaction since the wallet typically does not pass payment card details to the website (a unique transaction identifier or token is shared instead). Increasingly this approach is a feature of online payment gateways, especially if the payment gateway offers a \\"hosted payment page\\" integration approach. Regulation In some countries, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, digital wallets are regulated as stored value facilities.

He continued the legacy of the Russian jeweller Peter Carl Faberg√©. He was born to the jeweller Edmund Mohr and his wife Maria Mayer in Pforzheim, Germany. His grandfather was the German jeweller Victor Mayer who founded the Victor Mayer jewelry company in Pforzheim in 1890. Another famed family member is his brother the computer pioneer Manfred Mohr. Mohr-Mayers childhood was overshadowed by the bombing of Pforzheim in 1945 during World War II. The dramatic event took the lives of many of his childhood friends and destroyed 83% of the inner city. The building he grew up in which also housed the Victor Mayer Co. remained miraculously untouched by the disaster. In 1960 he received a PhD in business administration at the University of Munich, then he worked with jewellers Asprey in London and Altenloh, Brussels until 1964. There he refined his taste and skills in jewelry making. In 1965 he and Hubert Mayer became owners of the Victor Mayer Jewelry manufacturing company in Pforzheim. Mohr-Mayer turned the Victor Mayer company over to his son Marcus O. Mohr in 2001 and retired from his position in 2003. Mohr-Mayer continues to represent the Faberg√© workmaster at events of the Collegium Faberg√© and gives lectures on the history and making of Faberg√© eggs. Mohr-Mayer is also a nephew of the German women's lib activist Else Mayer. He became instrumental in turning her nunnery in Bonn into a charitable foundation. Herbert Mohr-Mayer has been volunteering in the Else Mayer Foundation since 2004.  Restoring the Faberg√© line Herbert Mohr-Mayer revived the Faberg√© (line) which had been discontinued by the heirs of Peter Carl Faberg√©. The grandsons of Faberg√© sold the licensing rights to Faberg√© Co. in 1989. In the same year Faberg√© Inc. appointed Victor Mayer as the new licensee. After years of research in the fields of traditional jewelry making Mohr-Mayer reestablished long lost manufacturing techniques such as guilloch√© and Vitreous enamel. In 1991 the company presented the first Faberg√© (line) since the closing of the Faberg√© workshop in 1917.

Part of the system's Croton Watershed, it was formed by impounding the West Branch and Middle Branch of the Croton River, tributaries of the Croton River, which flows into the Hudson River. Placed into service in 1911, the resulting reservoir has a drainage basin of 16 square miles (25.6 km¬≤) and can hold of water at full capacity. This includes all bodies of water that flow into the reservoir except for other reservoirs. Water sources in the basin include Michaels Brook, and Lake Gilead, one of three controlled lakes in the Croton Watershed. The reservoir is split into three portions by Putnam County Routes 35 and 38, which cross it with causeways and bridges. Water from the reservoir flows into Westchester County, New York, through the Muscoot Reservoir and New Croton Reservoir before entering the New Croton Aqueduct. Water in the Aqueduct flows through The Bronx into the Jerome Park Reservoir before continuing on into Manhattan and joining the Catskill Aqueduct. It then flows through the rest of Manhattan and into the borough of Brooklyn before terminating in Staten Island. In January 2007, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection reportedly began a $74 million project of improvements to the Croton Falls Reservoir and the Diverting Reservoir. The upgrading and rehabilitation is part of the city's effort to comply with state and federal dam safety regulations. At the Croton Falls Reservoir, the spillway - the structure that allows excess water to leave the reservoir - will be widened and deepened. The nearly earthen and masonry dam will be resurfaced, a new bridge will be built over the redone spillway and various mechanical items, such as valves, will be replaced. In addition, cables anchoring the dam and spillway to the bedrock will be installed. The work will require the reservoir to be deepened . The connecting channel between the two reservoirs will be emptied, inspected and dredged. Construction at both sites is expected to continue until Jan. 31, 2010.

The remains of the ancient temple of Ravalnath are still visible today. The church of St Alex was first a chapel church; in 1808 CE it was converted to a church. This church once housed the \\"Kudtari/Kundodari\\" Mahamaya temple deities, now currently located at Ghudo Avadem.

Note: Anthony Morris Jr. is denoted as Anthony Morris I resulting from the convention that he is the first Anthony Morris in the New World (despite being a Jr, and thus the second Anthony Morris). His son, Anthony, is known as the second Anthony Morris (in the New World) and also as Anthony Morris III.  Career  Morris was born in Stepney, London. He emigrated to Burlington, New Jersey, in 1682, and relocated to Philadelphia three years later. In 1687, he built the original Morris Brewery, establishing a family business that would last until the 1830s. As the Francis Perot (and Sons) Malting Company, it endured into the 1960s as arguably the oldest continuous business in the United States. The original brewery was located on Front Street, south of Walnut. In 1745, Morris's grandson Anthony IV (son of the second Anthony Morris in Philadelphia) built a larger brewery at the corner of Dock and Pear (now Thomas Paine Place). At this location, Anthony IV's grandson, Benjamin Wistar Morris, brewed the preferred porter-style beer for President George Washington during the early 1790s. In addition to serving Philadelphia as one of its leading brewers, Anthony Morris served in a variety of judicial capacities during the 1690s and was described by William Penn as \\"one of the most sufficient as well as diligent magistrates\\" in the colony. In 1704, Morris became the city's mayor, a post later occupied by his son Anthony III, as well. Most of the older Anthony's attention after the turn of the 18th century, however, was devoted to preaching among the Society of Friends throughout North America. Morris was clerk of the Monthly Meeting for the Society of Friends in the late 17th century after he moved to Philadelphia. He also raised money for the construction of Philadelphia's Friends' Meeting Houses as well as contributing generously himself. He was active in the buying and selling of real estate which was one of his major business activities, judging by a compilation of land transfers which is in the Philadelphia archives office. He died in Philadelphia, aged 67.

As often this presentation miniature is in the book itself, which is now in St Petersburg. This book contains the Burgundian version for later periods. Clovis and his family, 14th-century The Grandes Chroniques de France is a vernacular royal compilation of the history of France, most manuscripts of which are luxury copies that are heavily illuminated. Copies were produced between the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries, the text being extended at intervals to cover recent events. It was first compiled in the reign of Saint Louis (d. 1270), who wished to preserve the history of the Franks, from the coming of the Trojans to his own time, in an \\"official\\" chronography whose dissemination was tightly controlled. It was continued under his successors until completed in 1461. It covers the Merovingian, Carolingian, and Capetian dynasties of French kings, with illustrations depicting personages and events from virtually all their reigns. It survives in approximately 130 manuscripts,Hedeman xx; she was able to locate 131 MS., and has \\"included at the end of the book a Catalogue of Manuscripts dating from 1274 to c. 1420\\". varying in the richness, number and artistic style of their illuminations, copied and amended for royal and courtly patrons, the central work of vernacular official historiography. Over 75 copies are illustrated, with between one and over 400 scenes shown; analysis of the selections of subjects reveals the changing political preoccupations of the different classes of patrons over time.Hedeman, xx-xxii Following the contemporary styles of illustration seen in other manuscripts, early copies had mostly fairly small scenes, normally with a patterned background rather than a landscape or interior setting. In front of this a number of figures were engaged in key historical moments, especially battles, coronations, weddings and important meetings. There might be over 200 such scenes illustrated, often collected together as individual compartments in a full-page miniature with a decorated framework. By the mid-15th century the number of illustrations was fewer, around 50 even in lavish copies, but the miniatures were larger, and now had lovingly detailed landscape or interior backgrounds. Scenes of ceremonial moments, now often including large crowds, had become more popular, though battles retained their place.Hedeman, 180 Text The Grandes Chroniques de France had its origin as a French translation of the Latin histories written and updated by the monks of Saint- Denis, who were, from the thirteenth century, official historiographers to the French kings. As first written, the Grandes Chroniques traced the history of the French kings from their origins in Troy to the death of Philip II (1223). The continuations of the text were drafted first at Saint-Denis and then at the court in Paris. Its final form brought the chronicle down to the death of Charles V in the 1380s. There are also Burgundian variants, which give a different account of the final period, a product of the dissention which finally led to the Armagnac‚ÄìBurgundian Civil War in 1407-35.Hedeman, 154-155 Philip the Good's copy follows the Paris text up to 1226, but then uses Guillaume de Nangis' Chronicon up to 1327, and then Flemish chronicles from the monasteries of Saint Bertin and Notre Dame at Saint-Omer. The compiler, Abbot Guillaume Fillastre of Saint Bertin (not the earlier cardinal), aimed to promote Philip's claim to the French throne. He is shown handing over the work to Philip in the presentation miniature by Simon Marmion in Philip's copy.Voronova and Sterligov, p. 120 Sources for material on the reign of Charlemagne included the Historia Caroli Magni, also known as the \\"Pseudo- Turpin Chronicle\\" and the Vita Karoli Magni by Einhard.

Jean Fouquet The earliest surviving version is that of Primat de Saint- Denis, a copy of which was presented to Philip III in about 1274, with 36 miniatures (many with multiple scenes) and historiated initials by Parisian artists. These were mostly derived from other manuscript sources, but ingeniously focused into a coherent programme of illustration reflecting the points the abbey wished the king to absorb, regarding both its own aspirations and the nature of kingship in general.Hedeman, 11; 11-29 describes this fully Especially fine are the lavishly illustrated copies made for Charles V (BnF, Ms. Fr. 2813), Louis VII, illuminated by Jean Fouquet (1455-1460, BnF, Ms. Fr. 6465, above) and Philip the Good of Burgundy, now in the Russian National Library, Saint Petersburg (1457, above). For the first 150 years of the Grandes Chroniques's existence, its audience was carefully circumscribed: its readership was centered in the royal court at Paris, and its owners included French kings, members of the royal family and the court, and a few highly connected clerics in northern France. During this period, there were no copies of the work that belonged to members of the Parlement or the university community.Bernard Guen√©e, \\"Les Grandes Chroniques de France : Le roman aux rois (1274-1518),\\" in La Nation, vol. 1, pt. 2, Les lieux de m√©moire, ed. Pierre Nora (Paris, Gallimard, 1986), pp 189-214. But from the mid-15th century a number of unillustrated copies survive \\"on paper or on mixtures of parchment and paper that belonged (when provenance is known) to secretaries and notaries and to members of the Parlement.

The date when Cetin was founded is unknown. There are some indications that a settlement existed there in the times of the Roman Empire. The Parish of All Saints, in which the fortress is situated, was first mentioned in 1334. In 1387, king Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor gifted Cetin to Ivan Krƒçki. Thereby it became the property of the Frankopan family. The Middle Ages were the golden era of Cetin. There was a Franciscan monastery and several churches near the fortress. In the 15th century, the Cetinski branch of Frankopan family was formed. It only lasted a hundred years. Ivan Frankopan Cetinski died in the Battle of Krbava field. His brother Grgur and son Franjo Frankopan became archbishops of Kalocsa. Franjo Frankopan was the last member of the Frankopan Cetinski family. After him, the fortress became property of the Frankopan Slunjski family. Cetin played an important role in the history of Croatia. After the defeat at the Battle of Moh√°cs in 1526, Croatian nobility gathered at the Parliament on Cetin (). On 1 January 1527, they elected Ferdinand Habsburg, Archduke of Austria as the king of Croatia. The chart signed by Croatian nobles and representatives of Ferdinand of Habsburg is among the most important documents of Croatian statehood and is preserved in the Austrian State Archives in Vienna. In the following centuries, Cetin was part of the Military Frontier, the borderland between the Habsburg Monarchy and the Ottoman Empire. During this period, Ottoman army took control of it several times. The fortress was often damaged and repaired. Two stone plates with Arabic inscriptions in the Croatian History Museum testify about reconstructions made during this period. In 1790, Austrian troops under the command of general Walisch finally won back Cetin for the Habsburg monarchy. The siege took one month, and after the battle several officers were decorated, including Johann I Josef, Prince of Liechtenstein. Cetin's status was finally confirmed during the peace conference in Svishtov. In 1809, Ottoman forces once again occupied Cetin but they withdrew the following year under the threats of Marshal Marmont, governor-general of Illyrian provinces. He forced Ottomans to withdraw from Cetin after briefly occupying Bihac.https://library.hungaricana.hu/hu/view/MitKuKKriegsArch_1892_Supplement/?pg=33&layout;=s He was promised to not enter again to French Croatia. Once the Ottoman threat petered out the fortress was abandoned and turned into a quarry. Administrative control of the surrounding area was transferred to the village of Cetingrad, which developed north of Cetin.

During the 1994‚Äì95 season, he scored his first goal in Serie A against Napoli, as well as his first ever hat-trick, against Lazio. He came to more widespread notice during the 1995‚Äì96 Serie A season, in which he shared the top-scoring title with Giuseppe Signori, scoring 24 goals (including a brace against Inter), despite his team, Bari, being relegated. This achievement led to a move to Lazio in 1996, but Protti's stay with the Rome club was not successful, and after two seasons with the club, including a loan to Napoli during the 1997‚Äì98 season, he was eventually released from his contract in 1998. After a spell in Serie B at Reggiana (1998‚Äì99), helping the club to Serie A promotion, Protti returned to Livorno in Serie C1 in 1999, where he rapidly became one of the most popular players in that club's history, scoring 11 goals during his first season with the club. He later captained Livorno, leading the club to Serie B promotion during the 2001‚Äì02 Serie C1 season, winning the title, and finishing the campaign as the top- scorer, and the following season he was the top-scorer in Serie B. He subsequently led Livorno to Serie A promotion during the 2003‚Äì04 season, before retiring in 2005 after the team had finished a surprising 9th in their first top division campaign in many years, leaving the captain's armband to Cristiano Lucarelli. Protti's number 10 was then retired by the club. He has also been given the freedom of the city of Livorno in 2007.STRUGGLERS MEET AT LIVORNO  Sporting Life ‚Äì Football  Football Transfers, Italy Serie A News, Fixtures, Results, Match Reports, Standings During the awarding ceremony, he asked the #10 jersey not to be retired any longer in order to \\"give anybody back the dream to dress it one day\\".

He was featured in Flex twice and Muscle Magazine International once. Biography M√ºnzer admired fellow Austrian bodybuilder Arnold Schwarzenegger. He attempted to imitate Schwarzenegger, eventually meeting his hero at the Arnold Classic competition in 1996. While competing, he used a variety of ergogenic aids, including large amounts of potassium-sparing diuretics, possibly leading to his death in 1996. After months of stomach pain, M√ºnzer was admitted to hospital on the morning of March 12, 1996. By 7pm, doctors had decided to operate to stop bleeding from his stomach, but his liver and kidneys failed shortly afterwards. His condition by this point was too severe for a blood transfusion, and he died on the morning of March 14. The autopsy gave the cause of death as dystrophic multiple organ failure. Some of the specific autopsy findings were an extremely muscular physique with an almost complete absence of subcutaneous fat, a liver that contained numerous table tennis ball-sized tumors (with half the liver consisting simply of a crumbly mass that was similar to polystyrene), shriveled testes, and cardiac hypertrophy (M√ºnzer's heart weighed 636g; a normal man's heart usually weighs 300‚Äì350g). M√ºnzer's electrolytes were also out of balance, and his potassium levels were extremely high.

He served as the head football coach at Washburn College‚Äînow Washburn University‚Äîin 1900, at Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas from 1902 to 1904, and at the University of Oklahoma from 1905 to 1926, compiling a career college football record of 155‚Äì60‚Äì19. Owen was also the head basketball coach at Oklahoma from 1908 to 1921, tallying a mark of 113‚Äì49, and the head baseball coach at the school from 1906 to 1922, amassing a record of 142‚Äì102‚Äì4. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1951. Early life and playing career Owen was born in Chicago, Illinois in 1875 and his family moved to St. Louis, Missouri when he was 12. After he finished school, his family again moved, this time to Arkansas City, Kansas. There Owen served as an apprentice to a local doctor for three years. He then enrolled in the University of Kansas in 1897 to pursue his medical studies and he soon discovered his knack for football. Owen played football at Kansas under two excellent, but contrasting coaches. Wylie G. Woodruff, an All American player from the University of Pennsylvania came to Kansas to coach football in the fall of 1897. Owen got a part-time job working as a medical assistant for Woodruff and it was Woodruff who encouraged Owen to try out for the Kansas football team. Owen played under Woodruff for two seasons. Woodruff specialized in a tough, hard-hitting style of football. Woodruff's message to his players was \\"hurdle the wounded, step on the dead.\\" Woodruff was released at the end of the 1898 season and Kansas hired Fielding H. Yost from the University of Nebraska. Unlike, Woodruff, Yost's style of football was based on innovation, speed, and cunning. Owen was the star quarterback for Yost's undefeated 1899 team. Coaching career Upon graduating from Kansas, Owen took his first head coaching job at Washburn College. Following a one-year stint there, he spent the 1901 season as Yost's assistant at the University of Michigan. While at Michigan, he helped Yost develop the famous \\"Point-a-Minute\\" teams built around halfback Willie Heston. Owen got his first exposure to the Oklahoma football team while head coach at Bethany College in Lindsborg, Kansas. His Bethany Swedes met and defeated two Sooner teams in 1903 and 1904.College Football Data Warehouse University of Oklahoma football records, 1900-1904 Owen took over the Oklahoma football team in 1905, succeeding one-year coach Fred Ewing. He stepped in and immediately turned the fledgling team around, giving Oklahoma its very first win over the rival Texas Longhorns. Owen was loved by the players as he regularly would involve himself in scrimmages when he felt his players were lagging. Owen's first two years at Oklahoma were spent back and forth between Norman and Arkansas City. Due to a reduced financial budget, Owen only remained on campus during the football season. In 1907, Owen lost his right arm in a hunting accident. Early in Stratton D. Brooks's tenure as president of the University of Oklahoma, Owen was fired by the state legislature. They believed his salary of $3,500 () was far too great for an athletics coach and used the loss of his arm as an excuse for dismissal. They recommended he be terminated and shortly thereafter, he was. However, when Brooks heard of this news, he quickly got the decision rescinded. Owens did not learn of his \\"dismissal\\" until a week after his \\"re- hiring.\\" Owen's undefeated team of 1915. Early in Owen's tenure as head coach, funding for athletic teams were very much an issue. Due to costs involved in travel, Owen's teams would regularly go out on long, grueling road trips. In 1905, his Sooners played three games in five days and in 1909 they played three games in six days. Owen is also known for introducing the forward pass to football in the Southwestern United States. This allowed his team to quickly score against lesser opponents. In 1911, his team defeated Kingfisher College, 104‚Äì0. Largely because of their accomplishments during Owen's era as head coach, the Oklahoma Sooners have scored the most points of any team in college football history. In 1,154 games through the 2009 season, the Sooners have scored 30,897 points with over 5,000 of those being contributed by Owen's teams. Owen's Sooners twice scored over 150 points in a game and won three games in 1915 by a combined score of 258‚Äì0. Owen's overall record at Oklahoma was 122‚Äì54‚Äì16. Along with Bud Wilkinson, Barry Switzer and Bob Stoops, he is one of four coaches to win over 100 games at the University of Oklahoma. No other college football program has had more than three coaches accomplish the feat. In addition to coaching football, Owen also spent 13 seasons as the Oklahoma men's basketball head coach. In those 13 years, he won nearly 70% of his games, had two undefeated seasons and only two losing seasons. In 1910, Owen became an initiated member of the Delta Epsilon chapter of Sigma Nu at the University of Oklahoma. Owen's had been living in the Sigma Nu chapter house's basement at 526 South University Boulevard during this time. Because he was taking several classes at the university, he was eligible to be become an initiated member at the request of several of his players that had become members themselves. Owen's would go onto be very active with Sigma Nu for many years, notably helping found the Epsilon Epsilon chapter of Sigma Nu at Oklahoma State University in 1920. Honors and death While the name of the Oklahoma football stadium is the Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium, they originally played at Boyd Field during Owen's tenure and later moved and renamed Owen Field in his honor. The playing surface itself still retains the name Owen Field and many still refer to the stadium as a whole as such. Owen was a charter member of the College Football Hall of Fame, elected in 1951. He died February 26, 1970 in Houston, Texas at age 94.

Each episode was broadcast on Saturday evening with a repeat on the following Monday. The series presented rarely broadcast and unreleased BBC recordings of The Beatles made between 1963 and 1968. This included sessions from Saturday Club, Easy Beat and Pop Go the Beatles. As well as the songs, the programme included much of the Beatles' chat and interview material from the various programmes, much of it involving Brian Matthew and Kenny Everett. There are also contemporary interviews with people who were involved in the original programmes. The programme title is something of a misnomer, since the tapes were not lost but simply shelved for many years. Much of the session material featured on the programme, including some of The Beatles' chat, was finally given an official release on Live at the BBC in 1994 with additional recordings published in 2013 under the name On Air ‚Äì Live at the BBC Volume 2. The tapes were found in Park Mount Drive, Macclesfield in the late 1970s.Macclesfield Express John Beeling, a director for the BBC, met a collector called Mike Adams by accident who had recorded nearly every broadcast of the Beatles since 1961. Kevin Howlett, one of Britain's top producers, produced a new series using these tapes along with additional material. Howlett later wrote a book called Beatles at the Beeb which credits Adams and others. It was later edited and improved when the Beatles at the Beeb album was released. In May 2012, Unicorn Records released an eight-CD box set of the entire fourteen-part series, presented in a high- gloss box containing eight CD mini jackets; although only available through the grey market, this marked the first release of its kind since its original broadcast in 1988.

It contains approximately 4 million total insect specimens, over 3 million of which are pinned, roughly 400,000 mounted on slides, the remainder preserved in ethanol (including most of the non-insect arthropods, and some snails). Of the ~4 million curated holdings, approximately 75% of are identified to genus level or better. An estimated 25% of the entire collection are Hymenoptera, 21% are Coleoptera, 18% Diptera, and 18% Lepidoptera. This is the second oldest of the University of California entomological collections. The first specimens were transferred from the California State Insectary at Sacramento by Harry Smith in 1923. Other sizable personal collections were added by P.H. Timberlake in 1924 and L.D. Anderson in 1948, and the G.P. McKenzie collection of North American Coleoptera was purchased in 1965. The division of Entomology museum was formalized by E.I. Schlinger in 1962, and is now one of the 20 largest insect collections in the United States, and one of the 10 largest strictly University-based collections. For many of the special taxonomic collections, such as specimens from southern California, the effective rank is considerably higher. The UCR collection of Chalcidoidea (Hymenoptera) is one of the world's largest of this group, and the slide collection of Chalcidoidea has no comparison in the world (more than 100,000 slides, primarily Trichogrammatidae, Aphelinidae, Mymaridae, Eulophidae, and Encyrtidae). Additional specialty taxa represented as slides or pinned specimens are Apoidea, Asiloidea (esp. Bombyliidae, Therevidae, Asilidae), Meloidae, Thysanoptera, Staphylinidae, Melyridae, Coccinellidae, Sciomyzidae, Tephritidae, Miridae, Aphididae, Coccoidea, and various selected genera (e.g., the scarab genera Pleocoma and Chrysina). The holdings include over 1,100 primary types and many thousands of paratypes of the preceding taxa (the majority attributable to P.H. Timberlake). The vast majority of material is from southern California, Arizona, and the Baja California Peninsula, including one of the most extensive collections of insects from the Sonoran Desert (esp. Colorado Delta and Mojave components), and Coastal sage scrub ecological zones. In addition to substantial northern California holdings and other U.S. and Mexican material, there are also significant amounts of material from Central and South America, the Russian Far East and its European part, India, Australia, South Africa, and Thailand. The parasitic wasp collection is the most geographically diverse, with material from all biogeographic regions, and dating back to the early 1900s.

Without Bread or Work by Ernesto de la C√°rcova. The Baring crisisthe Baring crisis of 1890 : The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics or the Panic of 1890 was an acute recession. Although less serious than other panics of the era, it is the nineteenth century‚Äôs most famous sovereign debt crisis, and the 17th largest decline in U.S. stock market history. Background The crisis was precipitated by the near insolvency of Barings Bank in London. Barings, led by Edward Baring, 1st Baron Revelstoke, faced bankruptcy in November 1890 due mainly to excessive risk-taking on poor investments in Argentina. Argentina itself suffered severely in the recession of 1890 with its real GDP falling by 11 percent between 1890 and 1891,Kris James Mitchener & Marc D. Weidenmier: The Baring Crisis and the Great Latin American Meltdown of the 1890s, NBER, 2007. An international consortium assembled by William Lidderdale, governor of the Bank of England, including Rothschilds and most of the other major London banks, created a fund to guarantee Barings' debts, thereby averting a larger depression. Nathan Rothschild remarked that if this had not happened, perhaps the entire private banking system of London would have collapsed which would have caused an economic catastrophe. The international financial distrust generated with this crisis burst the bubble in the Brazilian economy, which had been inflating since the previous decade, bringing forward its expected end and seeing a Brazilian financial crisis, which in turn along with Argentine and Uruguayan crises slashed repatriations and short-term investment by European immigrants from Latin America to their countries of origin, affecting the region significantly in the 1890s.\\"Latin American Economic Outlook 2010\\" OECD 2009 Part I, page 36 See also * The historical novel Stone's Fall by Iain Pears.

Breast, lung, stomach, pancreas, and prostate cancers are the most common tumors that result in lymphangitis. Lymphangitis carcinomatosa was first described by pathologist Gabriel Andral in 1829 in a patient with uterine cancer. Lymphangitis carcinomatosa may show the presence of Kerley B lines on chest X-ray. Lymphangitis carcinomatosa most often affects people 40‚Äì49 years of age. Lymphangitis carcinomatosa may be caused by the following malignancies as suggested by the mnemonic: \\"Certain Cancers Spread By Plugging The Lymphatics\\" (cervical cancer, colon cancer, stomach cancer, breast cancer/bronchiogenic carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, thyroid cancer, laryngeal cancer) Pathology In most cases, lymphangitis carcinomatosis is caused by the dissemination of a tumor with its cells along the lymphatics. However, in about 20 percent of cases, the inflammation of the lymphatic tubules (lymphangitis) is caused by a tumor that blocks the drainage of the lymph duct. In the lung, this is often caused by a centrally located mass, near the hilum of the lung that blocks lymphatic drainage. Prognosis Previously, the finding of lymphangitis carcinomatosis meant about a six-month life expectancy. However, improved treatment has improved survival in patients with lymphangitis carcinomatosis, with patients often surviving three or more years with treatment.

Story In 2010, the majority of the world's developed countries have formed a centralised organisation, known as the International Corps for Peace, dedicated to bringing about world peace through worldwide media. However, not all developing countries are keen to be involved. Ghost, a secret organisation, seeks only the economic interests of its members without any attachment to morals thus does not hesitate to create crisis situations which the International Corps for Peace is forced to solve, through humiliation, and healthy propaganda. Gameplay There are 2 playable campaigns in Conflict Zone: the Ghost campaign, and the International Corps for Peace campaign. Missions take place in locations where fictional conflicts take place such as: civil war in Ukraine, wars between Indonesia and Malaysia, India and Pakistan and Nigeria and Niger. Most missions usually require the player to build a base (or a 'camp' in Ghost's case) and complete objectives in order to successfully complete the mission. Unlike most other traditional real-time strategy games, where a main resource pool is used to produce units and buildings, Conflict Zone uses a unique system where innocent civilians are the centerpiece and that the two factions have two completely different strategies that offers a unique challenge to master. Conflict Zone's main innovation was the use of propaganda, which was crucial in the game, with money second. Coming in the form of Popularity Points, players have to exploit the media in order to gain more PP to unlock units and buildings to help turn the fight in their favour, which faction the player may choose affects the way they are gained. In some cases, the player may also employ artificial intelligence commanders who can be delegated duties. Each commander is tailored to a specific strategy: attack, defend, specialist and commando. By allocating resources, units and bases to a commander, the player can have him/her perform various operations with whatever is at hand. The International Corps for Peace uses an arsenal of high end, fully trained forces and can easily overpower their Ghost counterpart in brute force but the commander is forced to 'appeal' to humanitarian efforts by rescuing Civilians, from neutral towns within the map, and take them to built Refugee Camps to gain PP. However should the player become reckless and accidentally cause civilian casualties or lack the motivation in rescuing then his/her PP level may drop. The Ghost however do not care of civilian welfare and are more ruthless but depend on the people to help them win. With a weaker arsenal but bigger unit capacity, Ghost players have the freedom to cause havoc wherever they please; whether it's deliberately attacking International Corps for Peace forces near civilians, shooting down their rescue efforts, directly destroying their refugee camps or actively fighting off attacks, the organisation gain popularity by turning the country's people to their cause. To also help gain this, Ghost commanders can even 'enlist' civilians by taking them to enlistment camps where soldiers, dressed as civilians, can help hamper their oppressor's rescue efforts but the only to do this is employ their own cameramen to capture their motives. Reception The Dreamcast and PC versions received \\"mixed\\" reviews, while the PlayStation 2 version received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

Environmental Protection Agency, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), is a 5-4 U.S. Supreme Court case in which twelve states and several cities of the United States, represented by James Milkey, brought suit against the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to force that federal agency to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) as pollutants.. Background Section 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 7521(a)(1), requires the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to set emission standards for \\"any air pollutant\\" from motor vehicles or motor vehicle engines \\"which in his judgment cause[s], or contribute[s] to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\\"Clean Air Act, . In 2003, the EPA made two determinations: #The EPA lacked authority under the CAA to regulate carbon dioxide and other GHGs for climate change purposes. #Even if the EPA did have such authority, it would decline to set GHG emissions standards for vehicles. =Parties= The petitioners were the states of California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, the cities of New York, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C., the territory of American Samoa, and the organizations Center for Biological Diversity, Center for Food Safety, Conservation Law Foundation, Environmental Advocates, Environmental Defense, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, International Center for Technology Assessment, National Environmental Trust, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. James Milkey of the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office represented the petitioners in oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court. Respondents were the Environmental Protection Agency, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, National Automobile Dealers Association, Engine Manufacturers Association, Truck Manufacturers Association, CO2 Litigation Group, Utility Air Regulatory Group, and the states of Michigan, Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Texas, and Utah. =Appeals court= The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decided on September 13, 2005, to uphold the decision of the EPA. However, appellate judges were sharply at odds in their reasoning for reaching the majority conclusion. The lower court was sharply divided on whether the petitioners had \\"standing\\", a personalized injury creating a right to claim remedial action from the government through the courts (i.e., rather than to seek favorable action by pressing for supportive legislation). One of the three judges found no standing while a second of the three postponed a factual decision for any later trial. Although it had granted certiorari, the Supreme Court could have revisited the question of standing to dodge a difficult decision and dismiss the case for lack of standing. However, once certiorari has been granted, such a reversal is rare. =Granting of certiorari= On June 26, 2006, the Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari.Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, 549 U.S. [ 1029] (2006). =Issues= # Whether the petitioners had standing. # Whether carbon dioxide is an \\"air pollutant\\" causing \\"air pollution\\" as defined by the CAA. If carbon dioxide is not an air pollutant causing air pollution, then the EPA has no authority under the CAA to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. If the CAA governs carbon dioxide, the EPA Administrator could decide not to regulate carbon dioxide, but only consistent with the terms of the CAA. # Whether the EPA Administrator may decline to issue emission standards for motor vehicles on the basis of policy considerations not enumerated in section 202(a)(1). =Arguments= The Petitioners argued that the definition in the CAA is so broad that carbon dioxide must be counted as an air pollutant. They claimed that the question was controlled by the words of the statute, so that factual debate was immaterial. Furthermore, the Petitioners filed substantial scientific evidence that the toxicity of carbon dioxide results from high concentrations and that causation of global warming transforms the gas into a pollutant. If the statutory definition of the CAA includes carbon dioxide, then the Federal courts would have no discretion to reach any other conclusion. The definition contained in the statute, not evidence or opinion, would control the outcome. The law's definition of air pollutant contains \\"any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical, biological, radioactive ... substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air, ...\\" Both sides agreed that CO2 and greenhouse gases are part of the second half. Petitioners argued that the use of 'including' automatically means greenhouse gases are part of the first group, 'any air pollution agent' which was not separately defined. EPA argued that this is wrong because 'Any American automobile, including trucks and minivans, ... ' does not mean that foreign trucks are American automobiles. The Petitioners asserted that the EPA Administrator's decision not to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases violated the terms of the CAA. Thus, the Supreme Court also considered whether the reasons given by the EPA were valid reasons within the CAA statute for the EPA Administrator to decide not to regulate carbon dioxide. The EPA argued that the Administrator has the discretion under the CAA to decide not to regulate. The EPA Administrator argued that other actions are already being taken to increase fuel efficiency of automobiles and that (as of 2003) scientific investigation was still under way. Thus, the EPA Administrator decided not to regulate \\"at this time\\". This case has become notable because of a widespread perception that the truth or falsehood of theories of global warming will be decided by the courts. While this could eventually occur in later proceedings, the questions before the U.S. Supreme Court here were much more narrow, and legal in nature. One of several reasons that the EPA Administrator declined to regulate carbon dioxide is uncertainty about whether man-made carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming. This has attracted great attention to the case. However, the Supreme Court only decided whether the Administrator's reason is a valid reason within the CAA. The Supreme Court did not explicitly decide if it is true or untrue that man-made carbon dioxide emissions cause global warming, although high- profile comments by Justices during oral argument are likely to affect the public debate. The Petitioners argued that scientific uncertainty is not a valid basis for the EPA Administrator to decline to regulate. The question before the Supreme Court \\"was not whether the causation is true or untrue,\\" but whether it is a valid reason for the Administrator to not regulate a pollutant.  Opinion of the Court  First, the petitioners were found to have standing.Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 526. Justice Stevens reasoned that the states had a particularly strong interest in the standing analysis.Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 518-20. The majority cited Justice Holmes' opinion in Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co. (1907): > \\"The case has been argued largely as if it were one between two private > parties; but it is not. The very elements that would be relied upon in a > suit between fellow-citizens as a ground for equitable relief are wanting > here. The State owns very little of the territory alleged to be affected, > and the damage to it capable of estimate in money, possibly, at least, is > small. This is a suit by a State for an injury to it in its capacity of > quasi-sovereign. In that capacity the State has an interest independent of > and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its > domain. It has the last word as to whether its mountains shall be stripped > of their forests and its inhabitants shall breathe pure air.\\". Second, the Court held that the CAA gives the EPA the authority to regulate tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases. The CAA provides: > \\"The Administrator shall by regulation prescribe (and from time to time > revise) in accordance with the provisions of this section, standards > applicable to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or classes of > new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines, which in his judgment > cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated > to endanger public health or welfare.\\" The CAA defines \\"air pollutant\\" as \\"any air pollution agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, chemical, biological, radioactive ... substance or matter which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air\\".Clean Air Act, . The majority opinion commented that \\"greenhouse gases fit well within the CAA's capacious definition of air pollutant.\\"Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. at 528-29. Finally, the Court remanded the case to the EPA, requiring the agency to review its contention that it has discretion in regulating carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. The Court found the current rationale for not regulating to be inadequate and required the agency to articulate a reasonable basis in order to avoid regulation. =Roberts' dissent= Chief Justice Roberts authored a dissenting opinion. First, the dissent condemns the majority's \\"special solicitude\\" conferred to Massachusetts as having no basis in Supreme Court cases dealing with standing. The dissent compares the majority opinion to \\"the previous high-water mark of diluted standing requirements,\\" United States v. SCRAP (1973). Roberts then argues that the alleged injury (i.e., Massachusetts' loss of land because of rising sea levels) is too speculative and without adequate scientific support. The dissent also finds that even if there is a possibility that the state may lose some land because of global warming, the effect of obliging the EPA to enforce automobile emissions is hypothetical at best. According to Roberts, there is not a traceable causal connection between the EPA's refusal to enforce emission standards and petitioners' injuries. Finally, the dissent maintains that redressability of the injuries is even more problematic given that countries such as India and China are responsible for the majority of the greenhouse-gas emissions. The Chief Justice concludes by accusing the majority of lending the Court as a convenient forum for policy debate and of transgressing the limited role afforded to the Supreme Court by the U.S. Constitution.Cornell University. Roberts dissenting opinion =Scalia's dissent= First, Justice Scalia found that the Court has no jurisdiction to decide the case because petitioners lack standing, which would have ended the inquiry. However, since the majority saw fit to find standing, his dissent continued. The main question is, \\"Does anything require the Administrator to make a 'judgment' whenever a petition for rulemaking is filed?\\" Justice Scalia sees the Court's answer to this unequivocally as yes, but with no authority to back it. He backs this assertion by explaining that the \\"statute says nothing at all about the reasons for which the Administrator may defer making a judgment\\"‚Äîthe permissible reasons for deciding not to grapple with the issue at the present time. Scalia saw no basis in law for the Court's imposed limitation. In response to the Court's statement that, \\"If the scientific uncertainty is so profound that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment as to whether greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, EPA must say so,\\" Scalia responded that EPA has done precisely that, in the form of the National Research Council panel that researched climate-change science. (But in fact, the panel stated that it \\"generally agrees with the assessment of human-caused climate change presented in the IPCC Working Group I (WGI) scientific report,\\" which concluded that most of the increase in global temperatures since the middle of the 20th century is \\"very likely\\" caused by man-made greenhouse gases.) Remand On remand, EPA found that six greenhouse gases \\"in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger public health and to endanger public welfare.\\" On February 16, 2010, the states of Alabama, Texas, and Virginia and several other parties sought judicial review of EPA's determination in the U.S. Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit. On June 26, 2012, the court issued an opinion which dismissed the challenges to the EPA's endangerment finding and the related GHG regulations. The three-judge panel unanimously upheld the EPA's central finding that GHG such as carbon dioxide endanger public health and were likely responsible for the global warming experienced over the past half century.

The Bisaya tribe has many similarities with the Dusun Tatana tribe, especially in terms of language. It is evident that some of their dialogical language conversations are almost identical if they have a dialogue with each other. Nowadays the Bisaya living in Sabah are Muslim, while the Bisaya living in Sarawak are mostly Christianity. In Brunei, they are referred as Dusun, Jati Dusun and Bisaya (Though they are not to be confused with the Dusun people of Sabah). The Bisaya people are also regarded as a relatives of the Dayak people whereas Bisaya was not brought into Borneo instead they are aboriginal of the land. Origin and etymology Several theories have been put forward by various researchers regarding the origins of the name of the Bisaya people. Beyer H.O. in 1926, Hester E.D. in 1954 and Harrison in 1956 suggested that the name may have come from the empire of Sri Vijaya (Sonza, 1972). However, in 1960, Eugene Vestraelen (Professor of Linguistics at the University of San Carlos, Cebu City) cautioned that the linguistic derivation of Vijaya would not be Bisaya but Bidaya, or Biraya. In 1960, John Carol suggested that the name originated from a cultural hero named Sri Visaya. Another theory is that the word Visaya (or Bisaya, as it is pronounced in the Philippines) comes from the word for the Hindu merchant, trader, herder, artisan, landowner (etc.) caste: the \\"Vaishyas\\", which can be traced back to Sanskrit, and assume that the label was given by the Sri Vijayans and others pirates and traders coming from India. History The rehabilitation of a traditional Bisaya house in the Heritage Village of Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. Bisaya's indigenous people settled in Borneo thousands of years ago. The Bisaya were a people who were loved, feared and respected by others on the island. They are skilled in agriculture, particularly in the areas such as paddy planting, ginger, sago, local ginger, tapioca, banana, yam, pepper, coconut. They also hunt animals and breed others, such as chicken, duck, goose, goat, buffalo, cows and many more. Bisaya people are skilled in catching fish either from the river or at sea, and they can hold their breath under water without drowning. One of the tragic stories of the Bisaya happened a few hundred years ago when Awang Kuyoh, son of Awang Alak Betatar was drowned by the Sulu people, who took his wife back to Sulu Island. Legend has it that the Bisaya sailor called Awang Semaun and his crew sailed around this island starting from Klias River, and he tied a handkerchief in front of the boat. When he arrived at the starting point, the handkerchief was torn and that's how this island came to be called Handkerchief Island or Pulau Sapu Tangan or Pulau Peraca in local language. The Imperial Colony called it Borneo. From Spanish records, this island was known as Borneo during the first visit of the Portuguese sailor Magellan, in service of the Spanish Crown. =Brunei Historical Centre version= The popular legend of the Bisaya origin as described Bewsher(1958), Sandin(1971) and Hussain & Newman(1987) goes as follows:- In 1370, Ma-ho-mo-sha [Maha Mokhsa] was a King of Barunai [P'o-ni]. A Chinese mission commanded by Chang Ching Tze dispatched to P'o-ni in 1370 (9th month, 3rd year of Hung-wa), found the king in a burned out capital with just 1,000 inhabitants. He sent a tribute mission to the Emperor of China in August 1371. Some versions of the Syair Awang Semaun trace the foundation of Brunei to fourteen saudara (brothers and first cousins). Other versions say they were all sons of Dewa Amas of Kayangan, a supernatural being who fell to earth in an egg at Ulu Limbang, and fathered them by fourteen different aboriginal wives: # Patih Barbai [Marbai] [Peti Barambai], Paduka Sri Pangiran Bendahara Sri Maharaja Permaisuara. The official version states that he became the second Muslim ruler as Sultan Ahmed - see below. # Awang Si Mawn [Semaun], Pangiran Temenggong. # Patih Mambang. # Patih Tuba. # Patih Sangkuna [Peti Runak]. # Patih Manggarun. # Patih Malakay. # Patih Pahit. m. Si Lampang, a captured Banteng. # Damang Sari. # Patih Sindayung. # Damang Libar Dawn, Juru Shahbandar. Emigrated to Java, where he lived for nine years. m. a Javanese lady, by whom he said to have had issue, one son and one daughter (?): a) Nakhoda Ragam (or Sultan Bolkiah - see below). a) Palingkam Kahaya. # Hapu Awang. # Patih Layla Langkung. # Awang Alak Betatar [Umuk Batata]. The official version states that he became the first Muslim ruler as Sultan Muhammad Shah. Paduka Sri Sultan Muhammad Shah[1363‚Äì1402], Sultan of Brunei, a younger son of Dewa Amas of Kayangan, by an aboriginal lady. He was chosen by the saudara to become the first ruler. Constructed his palace at Pirasung. Legends have Brunei founded some 29 reigns ago by 14 brothers of heroic stature and semi-divine descent, according to a Monograph of the Brunei Museum Journal. The exploits of the 14 founding heroes of Brunei are recounted in a very lengthy poem called the \\"Sha'er Awang Semaun.\\". Awang Alak Betatar was not the eldest, but was chosen to be their leader because of his intelligence and good looks. He was installed Sultan of Brunei and he remarried with the daughter of the Sultan of Johor. =Sabah history= The name of Borneo was the first known as Bonian among the Bisaya people. When the native bisaya converted into Islam together with their leader Awang Alak Betatar, the word was change from Bonian into Bornian due to the mother tongue of the preacher which is came from Taif, Arab Saudi. At the same time the native people had to pronounce Borneo until the Malaysia Day in 1963. Today it was known as Sabah. In 1959, Tun Datu Haji Mustapha Datu Harun met Sultan Tunku Laxamana Awang Ishak Ismail Jalil in a place called Kampung Takuli, Beaufort, Sabah. He was to convey a message of freeing the Borneo from British Colonial. Tun Mustapha asked Sultan Tunku Laxamana Awang Ishak his view regarding the new name of Borneo . The Sultan Tunku Laxamana Awang Ishak told Tun Mustapha to use Sabah as the name of the state. That is his ancestor Awang Alak Betatar mentioned the word Mongoi da sasabah every times he wants to go to the sea. The meaning is let's go fishing to the sea whereas the island was surrounded by the sea and had a lot fish. Tun Mustapha had offered Sultan Tunku Laxamana Awang Ishak to form Sabah Rulers but he rejected it because he is too old. According to the record his age is almost bicentennials. He prays someday his grandchildren will embrace all the people with the information when the times come and may them guidance by Allah the Almighty. The census of Bisaya is at least 1,000,000 people throughout Borneo (Sabah, Sarawak, Brunei and Kalimantan) and West Malaysia. Most of them lived in Sabah. =Tales from Limbang= The legend tells of an immigrant family living in the North of the Borneo Island. In this family were seven children, six boys (Peti Barambai or Pati Barabai, si Garamba, Peti Garamba, Peti Runa or Pati Begunak, Smaun or Si Maun and Alak Batata or Urak Betatar or Lok Batata or Awang Alah Bertabar) and a girl (Siti Duyah or Duri or Bunga Sunting). A boat race was used to determine who was to become the Rajah of Brunei. This race was won by Alak Betatar the youngest brother. He became the first Rajah of Brunei and later converted to Islam and became Sultan Mohammed, the first Sultan of Brunei. Peti Barambai, the eldest brother, became the Raja of Java. Si Garamba settled in the Limbang area and became the ancestor of the Bisaya's. Peti Garamba settled in the Tutong(Brunei), Peti Runa in the Kinabatangan River (Sabah) and Smaun in the Birau River (south of Tutong). Siti Duyah married a Chinese named Awang Sunting (or Ong Sum Ping) and settled near Mount Kinabalu (Sabah). The first king of Borneo In the year 977, we are told, Hianzta, king of Puni, sent envoys to China, who presented tribute with the following words: \\"May the emperor live thousands and tens of thousands of years, and may he not disapprove of the poor civilities of my little country.\\" The envoys presented a letter from the king. This was written on' what looked like the very thin bark of a tree; it was glossy, slightly green, several feet long, and somewhat broader than one inch; the characters in which it was written were small, and had to be read horizontally. In all these particulars the letter resembled the books of magic which are still written by the Battas of inland Sumatra. The message ran: \\"The king of Puni, called Hianzta, prostrates himself before the most august emperor, and hopes that the emperor may live ten thousands of years. I have now sent envoys to carry tribute; I knew before that there was an emperor, but I had no means of communication. Recently there was a merchant called Pu Lu, whose ship arrived at the mouth of my river; I sent a man to invite him to my place, and he told me that he came from China. The people of my country were much delighted at this, and preparing a ship, asked this stranger to guide them to the court. The envoys I have sent only wish to see Your Majesty in peace, and I intend to send people with tribute every year. But when I do so I fear that my ships may occasionally be blown to Champa, and I therefore hope Your Majesty will send an edict to that country with orders that, if a ship of Hianzta arrives there, it must not be detained. My country has no other articles, and I pray Your Majesty not to be angry with me.\\" The envoys were entertained and sent home with presents. How early the Arab doctrines were taught in Barunai is impossible to state with any precision. Local tradition ascribes their introduction to the renowned Awang Alak Betatar, afterwards known as Sultan Mohammad Shah. Like most of his subjects this warrior was a Bisaya, and in early life he was not a Muslim, not indeed a civilised potentate at all, to judge by conventional standards; for the chief mark of his royal dignity was an immense chawat, or loin-cloth, escorted by eighty men, forty in front and forty behind. He is the earliest monarch of whom the present Barunais have any knowledge, a fact to be accounted for partly by the brilliance of his exploits, partly by the introduction about that time of Arabic writing. After much fighting he subdued the people of Igan, Kalaka, Seribas, Sadong, Semarahan, and Sarawak [Most of the ethnics extinct due to illness and disease] and compelled them to pay tribute. He stopped the annual payment to Majapahit of one jar of pinang juice, a useless commodity though troublesome to collect. During his reign the Muruts or Lun Bawang were brought under Barunai rule by peaceful measures, and the Chinese colony was kept in good humour by the marriage of the Barunai king's brother and successor to the daughter of one of the principal Chinamen. This is an interesting account in many ways, and tallies very closely with what other evidence would lead one to suspect. For there is reason to think that Barunai, before it became Muslim, was a Bisaya kingdom under Buddhist sovereigns and Hindu influence; and nearly all the particulars given with regard to the people of Borneo are true of one or other of the races allied to Bisayas and living near Barunai to-day. =The Lost Treasure= It was believed that Awang Alak Betatar had made two weapons as the symbol of his throne. The weapons were handmade and created from the rock of star and the shape is similar to each other which is black and long sword. Sultan Awang Koyoh was the successor of his father's throne after he left Kota Klias and Awang Koyoh have keep that sword of star. Awang Alak Betatar became barunah or barunai ruler and called as Sultan Mohammad Shah. A Keris also part of a weapon which became as a symbol of Kota Klias throne. It was believed to be lost during the assassination of Awang Koyoh nearby Labuan water. Some fishermen had caught a big fish with this Keris some 60 years ago. The Keris and the Andiban were both made from gold. It was told by the eldest, when Awang Alak Betatar killed the wild buffalo or tambadau, the golden horns was discovered by Awang Alak and that inspired him to create another small and secret weapons. Language Sabah Bisaya language has 90% intelligibility of Tatana, a Dusun dialect. Bisaya in Sabah also has 58% lexical similarity with dialects of Sarawak Bisaya and 57%‚Äì59% with Brunei dialect. Music, arts and crafts The traditional musical instrument consists of Kulintangan, gong, and many of small gongs (cf. Asmahs claim that the Bisaya are supposed to be the best gong musicians). It is as if somebody just beats the gong and everyone-men, women, young and old just starts to dance. All these instruments are used in the wedding ceremony, celebrating very important people etc. Besides the musical items, the Bisayas are able to make good weapons for various purposes. There are andiban, sumpit, parang, keris and knife. Culture and tradition =Belief and customs= The majority of the Muslims Bisaya lives in Sabah (Beaufort) in contrast to majority of Bisaya live in Sarawak (Limbang & Miri) as a Christian. Though they treasure their cultural tradition of medicine, marriages, death etc., they don't actually practice it now, possibly due to the influence of the religion. Even though they would call the traditional medicine men or women known as Bobolian to perform rites in times of illness, many now would go to the clinics available around their places for treatment. =Folk dance= * Liliput dance (Sabah) * Jipin (Zapin) dance (Sabah) * Sayau Bagarus dance (grinding some sago trunk to produce sago flakes) (Sabah) * Mengalawat dance (performances as they stepping on the sago flakes to produce sago juices) (Sabah) * Mencayau dance (to celebrate victories after defeating the pirates) * Ugang Bamboo * Bubu mengalai (Sabah) or bubu dance using some spells such as: * Alai Anding =Folk songs= * Kulintangan Bisaya consist of 27 traditional songs and three berasik songs (spells for curing illness). * Badaup during paddy harvesting. =Folk games= * Tarik tali, tug of war * Gasing, spinning top * Kikit, kite playing * Lastik / Melastik, slingshot * Crossbow * Andiban or spear * Berambit / Bahambit, arm wrestling * Martial arts or silat Bisaya with bamboo music =Ceremony= * Scaling an infant on the month of Safar from Islam calendar. =Traditional attire= White shirt, Songket, Tarbus, smoking pipe, Keris, bracelet etc. =Traditional desserts= * Ambuyat * Kelopis * Bahulu * Ketupat * Kuih Cincin * Tapai Manis * Kuih Sapit * Kuih Jala * Kuih Penyaram * Kuih Lamban * Kuih Gelang Festivals =Rumbia= The leaves (roun rombia) The Rumbia's leaves can be woven into a product called Kajang. This product is used for roofing and walling material when building a house or farm hut. Young girls are trained by their elders (women ) to inherit the rumbia-weaving skill. The Rumbia'leaves known as roun rombia in Bisaya dialect. Meanwhile, the process of weaving the Rumbia's leaves known as manyarut. The woven Rumbia's leaves need to be dried under the sun. These leaves would last for two to three years, environment- friendly. The branch In the past, the branch of Rumbia tree used as wall for a house or hut ( in the farm ). The branch can be used to build chicken home, fence to guard the plants ( vegetables etc. ) and the dried branch used as a torch ( to spread the fire; to clear the land for agriculture purpose ). Meanwhile, skin of the branch can be woven into basket, mat, and others. Among the well-known woven stuff from this Rumbia parts are saging (a kind of basket carried at the back of a person), lalibu (a flat woven-basket useful during paddy harvesting), and topau (a mat used to dry the paddy seed). The trunk We start from the upper part, here we can get a punoh, this part is a delicious 'vegetable'. Can be eaten raw, sweet and soft. The punoh served as main menu (vegetable) during wedding reception among Bisaya community. Then, sago (staple food of Bisaya, young generation didn't agree with this) is extracted from the Rumbia's trunk. The skin (palunoh) of Rumbia tree can be used a firewood, floor for hut, and wall too. The trunk can be used as a bridge, it is a strong trunk and last longer. During flood, my brothers and I used to build a boat from the Rumbia tree. I missed those days, we are adult now. In case of emergency, you can get water from the roots of Rumbia tree. It tastes water, of course. =Mibulang= One of their main festivals called Babulang or Mibulang such as buffalo racing is celebrated annually in Batu Danau, Sarawak near the Brunei border.

The building was commissioned in the 110s A.D. by a consul, Gaius Julius Aquila, as a funerary monument for his father, former proconsul of Asia Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, and completed during the reign of Hadrian, sometime after Aquila's death. The library is considered an architectural marvel, and is one of the only remaining examples of a library from the Roman Empire. The Library of Celsus was the third-largest library in the Roman world behind only Alexandria and Pergamum, believed to have held around twelve thousand scrolls. Celsus is buried in a crypt beneath the library in a decorated marble sarcophagus. The interior measured roughly 180 square metres (2,000 square feet). The interior of the library and its contents were destroyed in a fire that resulted either from an earthquake or a Gothic invasion in 262 C.E.Clyde E. Fant, Mitchell GReddish, A Guide to Biblical Sites in Greece and Turkey, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003, p. 194., and the fa√ßade by an earthquake in the tenth or eleventh century.Clive Foss, Ephesus After Antiquity: A Late Antique, Byzantine, and Turkish City, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979, p. 134. It lay in ruins for centuries until the fa√ßade was re-erected by archaeologists between 1970 and 1978.Hartwig Schmidt, 'Reconstruction of Ancient Buildings', in Marta de la Torre (ed.), The Conservation of Archaeological Sites in the Mediterranean Region (Conference, 6‚Äì12 May 1995, Getty Conservation Institute), Los Angeles: The Getty Conservation Institute, 1997, pp. 46-7. History Celsus enjoyed a successful military and political career, having served as a commander in the Roman army before being elected to serve as a consul in Rome in 92 C.E. Celsus, a native of Sardis, was one of the first men from the Greek-speaking eastern provinces to serve as a consul, the highest elected office in imperial Rome. He was later appointed as proconsul, or governor, of Asia, the Roman province that covered roughly the same area as modern-day Turkey. Celsus's son Aquila commissioned the library in his honor, though it was not completed until after Aquila's death. An inscription records that Celsus left a large legacy of 25,000 denarii to pay for the library's reading material. Library of Celsus, side view The library operated as a public space for the city from its completion around 117-135 C.E. until 262. The main floor functioned as a reading room, lit by abundant natural light from the eastern windows. Shelves or armaria set into niches along the walls held papyrus book rolls that visitors could read, though borrowing would not have been permitted because copies of books were rare and labor-intensive to produce. Additional scrolls may have been held in free-standing book boxes placed around the room, in which case the library would have had a holding capacity of up to sixteen thousand scrolls. Plan of the Library of Celsus The interior and contents of the library were destroyed by fire in 262 C.E., though it remains unknown whether this fire was the result of natural disaster or a Gothic invasion, as it seems the city was struck by one of each that year. Only the fa√ßade survived, until an earthquake in eleventh or tenth century left it in ruins as well.Arete (personification of virtue) in the Celsus Library Between 1970 and 1978, a reconstruction campaign was led by the German archaeologist Volker Michael Strocka. Strocka analysed the fragments that had been excavated by Austrian archaeologists between 1903 and 1904.F. Hueber, V.M. Strocka, \\"Die Bibliothek des Celsus. Eine Prachtfassade in Ephesos und das Problem ihrer Wiederaufrichtung\\", Antike Welt 6 (1975), pp. 3 ss. In the meantime, some of the architectural elements had been acquired by museums in Vienna and Istanbul. The absent fragments had to be replaced by copies or left missing. Only the fa√ßade was rebuilt, while the rest of the building remains in ruin. Architecture Celsus, which stood in the central niche of the upper storey of the Celsus Library. It is now in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum The east-facing marble fa√ßade of the library is intricately decorated with botanical carvings and portrait statuary. Design features include acanthus leaves, scrolls, and fasces emblems, the latter being a symbol of magisterial power that alludes to Celsus's tenure as a consul. The library is built on a platform, with nine steps the width of the building leading up to three front entrances. These are surmounted by large windows, which may have been fitted with glass or latticework. Flanking the entrances are four pairs of Composite columns elevated on pedestals. A set of Corinthian columns stands directly above. The columns on the lower level frame four aediculae containing statues of female personifications of virtues: Sophia (wisdom), Episteme (knowledge), Ennoia (intelligence) and Arete (excellence). These virtues allude to the dual purpose of the structure, built to function as both a library and a mausoleum; their presence both implies that the man for whom it was built exemplified these four virtues, and that the visitor may cultivate these virtues in him or herself by taking advantage of the library's holdings. This type of fa√ßade with inset frames and niches for statues is similar to that of the skene found in ancient Greek theatres and is thus characterised as \\"scenographic\\". The columns on the second level flank four podia, paralleling the aediculae below, which held statues of Celsus and his son. A third register of columns may have been present in antiquity, though today only two remain. The interior of the building, which has yet to be restored, consisted of a single rectangular room measuring 17x11 m, with a central apse framed by a large arch at the far wall. The apse contained a podium for a statue, now lost, that likely depicted Celsus, although some scholars have suggested it was Minerva, goddess of wisdom. A crypt containing Celsus's sarcophagus was located beneath the floor of the apse. It was unusual in Roman culture for someone to be buried within a library or even within city limits, so this was a special honour for Celsus, reflecting his prominent role as a public official. The three remaining walls were lined with either two or three levels of niches measuring 2.55x1.1x0.58 m on average, which would have held the armaria to house the scrolls. These niches, which were backed with double walls, may have also had a function to control the humidity and protect the scrolls from the extreme temperature. The upper level was a gallery with a balcony overlooking the main floor, creating a lofty spatial effect inside. It could be reached via a set of stairs built into the walls, which added structural support. The ceiling was flat and may have had a central round oculus to provide more light. The design of the library, with its ornate, balanced fa√ßade, reflects the influence of Greek style on Roman architecture, which reached its height in the second century.  Portraiture of Celsus  The cuirassed statue of Celsus now in the Istanbul Archaeological Museum was one of three statues of the building's patron located on the second level of the fa√ßade. He is depicted with a strong jaw, curly hair, and a neat beard, Hellenizing portrait features that echo the stylistic choices of the building's fa√ßade. The style imitates traits of Hadrianic imperial portraiture, suggesting that it was sculpted after the lifetime of not only Celsus, but of his son Aquila as well. The choice to depict him in full armor suggests that Celsus's descendants considered his military career memorable and a source of pride.

The company came about because of the work of the ardent abolitionists, Granville Sharp, Thomas Clarkson, Henry Thornton, and Thomas's brother, John Clarkson, who is considered one of the founding fathers of Sierra Leone. The Company was the successor to the St. George Bay Company, a corporate body established in 1790 that re-established Granville Town in 1791 for the 60 remaining Old Settlers. St. George's Bay Company The Sierra Leone Company was the successor to the St. George's Bay Company that had been founded in 1790 following a mostly unsuccessful effort by the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor in 1787 to establish a free settlement for the \\"Black Poor\\" of London, many of whom were Black Loyalists, who had escaped and fought for the British following Dunmore's Proclamation during the American War of Independence). The 1787 expedition was made up of 300 of London's Black Poor, 60 English Working-class Women, and an assortment of white officials, clergy and craftsmen to assist in building the colony ‚Äì 411 men, women and children in all. Upon landing, they founded Granville Town as their base. This first colony only lasted about two and a half years, decimated by disease and later abandonment. The coup de grace occurred in 1789, when the neighbouring Temne people burned the settlement during a dispute between the Temne and slave traders.George E. Brooks, Jr. \\"The Providence African Society‚Äôs Sierra Leone Emigration Scheme 1784‚Äì1795: Prologue to the African Colonization Movement\\", International Journal of African Historical Studies 7, no. 2 (1974) pp 187‚Äì88. Although Granville Town was re-founded in 1791 under the auspices of Alexander Falconbridge, this settlement was not the basis for the colony or settlement established by the Company in March, 1792. Prime movers of the cause Both ventures were promoted by the anti-slavery activist Granville Sharp, who published a prospectus for the proposed company in 1790 entitled Free English Territory in AFRICA. The prospectus made clear its abolitionist view and stated that several respectable gentlemen who had already subscribed had done so \\"not with a view of any present profit to themselves, but merely, through benevolence and public spirit, to promote a charitable measure, which may hereafter prove of great national importance to the Manufactories, and other Trading Interests of this Kingdom\\". Among the early subscribers are many friends of Sharp involved in the Clapham Sect: Henry Thornton, William Wilberforce, Rev. Thomas Clarkson, Rev. Thomas Gisbourne, Samuel Whitbread Initial attempts to gain a royal charter for the company proved fruitless following opposition from the attorney general, Archibald Macdonald.Braidwood, p. 231. The company then proceeded to gain incorporation through act of parliament. However this too received opposition, particularly from the Committee of the Company of Merchants Trading to Africa, who called a meeting in March 1791. This led to three petitions being organised by slave trade merchants in London, Liverpool and Bristol. Slave traders in Lancaster also organised a petition as did the Africa Company. Further opposition was organised by the Standing Committee of West India Planters and Merchants, who arranged for two meetings with William Pitt, the Prime Minister.Braidwood, p. 235. Nevertheless, Henry Thornton was able to successfully guide the Sierra Leone settlement bill through parliament, despite the efforts of the Liverpool MP Bamber Gascoyne and other anti-abolitionists. On 30 May 1791, the bill was passed 87 votes to 9.Braidwood, p. 248. Colonization: the colony of Freetown Sierra Leone Company 20 cent coin In 1792, John Clarkson led over 1100 black settlers from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to establish a new colony and it was on this basis that the Nova Scotian Settlers founded Freetown, Sierra Leone. The majority of these settlers were former slaves of the American colonies, freed by the British during the American Revolution and forced to relocate after the British defeat. It was the determination of these settlers that caused Freetown to take shape and survive after they founded it in March 1792.Thomas, Lamont D. Paul Cuffe: Black Entrepreneur and Pan-Africanist (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illinois Press, 1988) p. 59 and Brooks, p. 190-191. The Company issued decimal currency in the form of dollars and cents struck by Matthew Boulton at Soho Mint and issued in 1791 (although these coins did not circulate until the founding of the Colony in 1792) and 1796. Notes on Colonial Coin: The Coins of the Sierra Leone Company 1791-1807 When war broke out between Great Britain and France (one of the French Revolutionary Wars) the Company lost supplies and a number of ships to privateers and the French navy. American merchantmen, as neutral traders, used the opportunity to establish trade. Trouble continued, though, for in September 1794 the French burned Freetown in a raid. The colonists rebuilt, and American merchants aided by selling the company vital supplies.Brooks, pp. 192-93. During these years the colony's acting governor, Zachary Macaulay, and his council agreed to accept American blacks as settlers with a gift of free Sierra Leone land if they met four criteria: they must have letters of recommendation of their upright character from their clergy, they must agree to become British subjects and abide by British law, they must secure their own passage to the colony, and they must clear at least one third of the land given to them for agriculture within two years of arrival.Brooks, pp. 196‚Äì97.

It was a piece of wood that was gripped by the wielder and was hung by a ring worn on the middle finger. Some versions were rings with a wooden peg attached on top. The ends were exposed and were usually sharp, which made them effective for paralyzing and even killing enemies quickly and without leaving a trace. They were easily hidden in the fists and were very lightweight and portable. They were usually worn in pairs. Many ninjas constructed their own shobo, although some were given from master to student. Due to the secretive nature of the ninja, there is no way of knowing exactly when and where the shobo was invented (meaning no more precise than feudal Japan) and exactly how popular it was among the ninja. It is believed this was an improvised weapon, with common origins cited as bridle bits for horses and livestock, harness rings for reins, and metal hinges for gates and doors. How the weapon was formalized is still up for debate. See also * Emeici - a similar Chinese weapon. * Suntetsu - a similar Japanese weapon.

The Perfect King: The Life of Edward III Father of the English Nation. Vintage Books London, 2006. was a daughter of Edward III and his wife, Philippa of Hainault. Joan, also known as Joanna, was born in the Tower of London. As a child she was placed in the care of Marie de St Pol, wife of Aymer de Valence and foundress of Pembroke College, Cambridge. She grew up with her sister Isabella, her brother Edward, and their cousin Joan of Kent, and she died in the Black Death that struck Europe in 1348. Life In 1338, Joan was taken on her father's journey to Koblenz, where they met Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and were his special guests at the Imperial Diet in the church of Saint Castor. Edward III had formed an alliance with Louis against Philip VI of France, but in 1341 the emperor deserted him. It is possible that Joan was betrothed to one of the sons Louis had with Margaret II of Hainaut, Philippa's older sister, and actually stayed in their court to be educated there. However, Edward III withdrew her in 1340. In 1345, she was betrothed to Peter of Castile, son of Maria of Portugal and Alfonso XI of Castile. In the summer of 1348, she left England with the blessing of her parents. Thanks to a heavily armed retinue she was, perhaps, the most protected woman of Europe at the time, and it is said that her trousseau alone required an entire ship. The travel schedule included a visit to one of her family's castles in Bordeaux. Travel to Castile Edward III had spared no expense in the preparations for Joan's journey and marriage, equipping her in the most impressive manner he could. The King loved his daughter, but it's very likely that he also wanted to make a display of power and wealth before his allies in Castile. The fleet that carried Joan and her retinue consisted of four English ships, which departed from Portsmouth and were received in Bordeaux by the awestruck mayor Raymond de Bisquale. Some say that he immediately warned Joan and her companions of the plague but that they didn't listen and proceeded to settle in the royal castle overlooking the estuary of the Gironde. Joan's entourage included three leading officials: Robert Bouchier, the former royal chancellor; Andrew Ullford, a diplomatic lawyer; and the cathedral priest of Bordeaux, Gerald de Podio, who was to see to the Princess's spiritual needs. Joan also had a remarkable Castilian minstrel, Gracias de Gyvill, who had been dispatched to England by Prince Pedro in order to entertain her with music and songs of the land of which she was to be queen. Joan was also escorted by over a hundred formidable English bowmen, some of them veterans of the Battle of Crecy, and she even travelled with a luxurious portable chapel, so that she could enjoy Catholic services without having to use the local churches all along the way to Castile. The chapel featured a couch decorated with fighting dragons and a border of vines, powdered with gold Byzantine coins, while the altar cloth was decorated with dragons and serpents. Joan's wedding dress was made with more than 150 metres of rakematiz, a thick imported silk, but she also had a suit of red velvet; two sets of 24 buttons made of silver gilt and enamel; five corsets woven with gold patterns of stars, crescents and diamonds; and at least two elaborate built-in-corset dresses, also made of rakematiz, one in green and the other in dark brown. The green was embroidered all over with images of rose arbors, wild animals and wild men, while the brown had a base of powdered gold and displayed a pattern of circles, each enclosing a lion as a symbol of monarchy. Additional items in Joan's trousseau included beds and bed curtains, ceremonial garments, riding outfits, and everyday clothes. Information concerning these can be found in her wardrobe account of 1347. Death As Joan embarked on her journey, the Black Death had not yet appeared in England, and it is unlikely that the party was aware of the danger. Despite the severe outbreak of plague in Bordeaux, at first it did not occur to Joan and her advisors to leave town. Soon, they watched in horror as the members of the entourage began falling sick and dying. Robert Bouchier, the leader of the retinue, died on 20 August. Joan feared for her life and was probably moved to the small village of Loremo, where she remained for some time. However, she could not escape the disease and became its first victim in the camp, suffering a violent, quick attack and dying on 1 July 1348. Some accounts document that Joan was buried in Bayonne Cathedral, and her statue, in Westminster Abbey, is on the South Side of her father's tomb. Aftermath Andrew Ullford, the diplomatic lawyer, was not affected by the plague and traveled to England in October to inform the king of his daughter's death. The English people were shocked: not only was she one of the earliest English victims of the epidemic, which was attacking England by then; but her death also seemed to prove that not even royalty would be spared. On 15 October 1348, Edward III sent a letter to King Alfonso of Castile terminating the marriage arrangements and describing the sorrow that he and his family were suffering after Joan's sudden death. He described her as a martyred angel looking down from Heaven to protect the royal family, and concluded with traditional and formal piety: \\"We have placed our trust in God and our life between his hands, where he held it closely through many dangers\\" On 25 October, Edward III sent an expedition to Bordeaux to retrieve Joan's body and return it for burial in London. The leader was a northern ecclesiastical lord, the bishop of Carlisle, who was overpaid by the King because of the high risk involved. What happened next is unknown. There is no record of Joan's remains being returned to England nor any account of a funeral of any kind. According to medievalist Norman Cantor, in his book The Last Knight: The Twilight of the Middle Ages and the Birth of the Modern Era (2004), Joan actually died in Bordeaux, where the mayor, in an effort to arrest the plague, set fire to the port, burning the Plantagenet castle there as well. Joan's body, inside the castle at the time, could not be recovered. Letter to Alfonso Here is an excerpt from the letter that King Edward III sent to King Alfonso of Castile (translated by Rosemary Horrox in her book The Black Death):Horrox, R. The Black Death (Manchester Medieval Sources). Manchester University Press, 1994. :We are sure that your Magnificence knows how, after much complicated negotiation about the intended marriage of the renowned Prince Pedro, your eldest son, and our most beloved daughter Joan, which was designed to nurture perpetual peace and create an indissoluble union between our Royal Houses, we sent our said daughter to Bordeaux, en route for your territories in Spain. But see, with what intense bitterness of heart we have to tell you this, destructive Death (who seizes young and old alike, sparing no one and reducing rich and poor to the same level) has lamentably snatched from both of us our dearest daughter, whom we loved best of all, as her virtues demanded : No fellow human being could be surprised if we were inwardly desolated by the sting of this bitter grief, for we are humans too. But we, who have placed our trust in God and our Life between his hands, where he has held it closely through many great dangers, we give thanks to him that one of our own family, free of all stain, whom we have loved with our life, has been sent ahead to Heaven to reign among the choirs of virgins, where she can gladly intercede for our offenses before God Himself.

The Metropolitan Police Service arrested six suspects on 5 January 2003, with one more arrested two days later. Within two days, the Biological Weapon Identification Group at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in Porton Down were sure that there was no trace of ricin on any of the articles that were found. This fact was initially misreported to other government departments as well as to the public, who only became aware of this in 2005. Reporting restrictions were in place before the public's perceptions could be corrected. The only subsequent conviction was of Kamel Bourgass, sentenced to 17 years imprisonment for conspiring \\"together with other persons unknown to commit public nuisance by the use of poisons and/or explosives to cause disruption, fear or injury\\" on the basis of five pages of his hand-written notes on how to make ricin, cyanide and botulinum. Bourgass had already been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of detective Stephen Oake, whom he stabbed to death during his arrest in Manchester. Bourgass also stabbed three other police officers in that incident; they all survived. All other suspects were either released without charge, acquitted, or had their trials abandoned. Bourgass had attended meetings of Al-Muhajiroun leading up to the plot. Public reaction Colin Powell's UN presentation slide showing alleged \\"UK poison cell\\" as part of a global network Physicians throughout the United Kingdom were warned to watch for signs that patients had been poisoned by ricin, and the public health director for London urged the public not to be alarmed following some media reports. Britain's largest circulation tabloid newspaper, The Sun, reported the discovery of a \\"factory of death\\", and other newspapers warned on their front pages \\"250,000 of us could have died\\", \\"Poison gang on the loose\\" and \\"Killer with no antidote\\". The fact that no ricin had been found was known to some government departments very early on, but this information was not revealed to the public until after Bourgass's trial two years later, although in the interim it was cited as evidence for further terrorism laws, as well as featuring in US Secretary of State Colin Powell's 5 February 2003 speech to the UN to build the case for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as part of the alleged Abu Musab al-Zarqawi global terrorist network. As late as February 2006, Chancellor Gordon Brown described it as a significant terrorism plot spanning 26 countries. Timeline of arrests and announcements * 5 January 2003 ‚Äì Police raided a flat above a pharmacy at 352 High Road, Wood Green, north London, and arrested six men on suspicion of manufacturing ricin intended for use in a terrorist poison attack on the London Underground. * 7 January ‚Äî A seventh man was arrested. * 12 January ‚Äî Five men and a woman were arrested in the Bournemouth area for terrorism involving ricin, but released without charge several days later. * 14 January ‚Äî Three men were arrested in Crumpsall, north Manchester, in a raid to detain a man who had been certified under part 4 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001. Detective Constable Stephen Oake died after being stabbed eight times with a kitchen knife by Kamel Bourgass who was also there. * 20 January ‚Äî Police raided and closed the Finsbury Park mosque for several days as part of the investigation. Seven men were arrested; another was arrested in London the next day. * 5 February ‚Äì Colin Powell, the United States Secretary of State, referred to those arrested as the \\"UK poison cell\\" of a global terrorist network in making a case for military intervention in Iraq to the United Nations Security Council. A week later he testified to the Committee on International Relations of the United States House of Representatives that this ricin had originated in Iraq, though this was disputed immediately. * 11 March ‚Äî The Home Secretary issued control orders against ten terrorist suspects just released from detention connecting them to the ricin plot, even though it was alleged to have occurred while they were in custody. Letters of apology were sent two weeks later explaining that it was a \\"clerical error\\", but that they were still terrorist suspects. * 21 March ‚Äî Two vials containing traces of ricin are found in a train station in Paris. These were said to be connected to an attack on the Russian embassy, until further tests proved that they were jars of wheat germ. * 16 September ‚Äî Several of the men were re-arrested to face deportation on terrorism charges based on information from a prisoner in Algeria. One of them, who in 1997 was sentenced to death in absentia by an Algerian court, continued to fight his deportation. Two of the jurors who found him not guilty at his trial expressed their sense of anger and betrayal at his subsequent treatment. Trials On 30 June 2004, Kamel Bourgass was convicted for the murder of DC Stephen Oake during his arrest and was jailed for life with a minimum tariff of 22 years. During periods of his imprisonment, Bourgass has been placed in segregation after he was accused by prison authorities of involvement in attacks on other prisoners and attempts to force other inmates to convert to Islam.Terrorists Bourgass and Hussain denied court challenge The trials of five defendants, including Bourgass, for conspiracy to commit murder and as part of a ricin plot, began in September and lasted until 8 April 2005. Bourgass alone was convicted and sentenced to 17 years for conspiring to cause a public nuisance by \\"plotting to spread ricin and other poisons on the UK's streets\\". Mouloud Sihali and David Khalef are convicted of possessing false passports. On 12 April 2005 the jury was dismissed after failing to reach a verdict on the charge of conspiring to commit murder, and a second trial of four further defendants was abandoned before it started. There had been a blanket ban on the media reporting on anything involving the Bourgass case for two years until the trial had ended. In October 2005, Eliza Manningham-Buller, the Director General of MI5, revealed that the evidence which uncovered the so-called ricin plot came from Mohamed Meguerba, a man who jumped bail and fled to Algeria where he was detained and probably subjected to torture.

This acts as \\"a management process which allows Corporate Information Services (IS) departments to work more effectively with users in a shorter time frame\\". Through JAD workshops the knowledge workers and IT specialists are able to resolve any difficulties or differences between the two parties regarding the new information system. The workshop follows a detailed agenda in order to guarantee that all uncertainties between parties are covered and to help prevent any miscommunications. Miscommunications can carry far more serious repercussions if not addressed until later on in the process. (See below for Key Participants and Key Steps to an Effective JAD). In the end, this process will result in a new information system that is feasible and appealing to both the designers and end users. \\"Although the JAD design is widely acclaimed, little is actually known about its effectiveness in practice.\\" According to the Journal of Systems and Software, a field study was done at three organizations using JAD practices to determine how JAD influenced system development outcomes. The results of the study suggest that organizations realized modest improvement in systems development outcomes by using the JAD method. JAD use was most effective in small, clearly focused projects and less effective in large complex projects. Since 2010, the International Association of Facilitators (IAF) has measured the significance of facilitated workshops, a la JAD, and found significant value.Gary Rush, 2013, \\"How Significant is the Value of Facilitation?\\"  Origin  Joint application is a term originally used to describe a software development process pioneered and successfully deployed during the mid-1970s by the New York Telephone Company's Systems Development Center under the direction of Dan Gielan. Following a series of remarkably successful implementations of this methodology, Gielan lectured extensively in various forums on the methodology, its benefits and best practices. Arnie Lind, then a Senior Systems Engineer at IBM Canada in Regina, Saskatchewan created and named joint application design, in 1974. This was an improvement on existing methods, which entailed application developers spending months learning the specifics of a particular department or job function, and then developing an application for the function or department. In addition to significant development backlog delays, this process resulted in applications taking years to develop, and often not being fully accepted by the application users. Arnie Lind's idea was simple: rather than have application developers learn about people's jobs, why not teach the people doing the work how to write an application? Arnie pitched the concept to IBM Canada's Vice President Carl Corcoran (later President of IBM Canada), and Carl approved a pilot project. Arnie and Carl together named the methodology JAD, an acronym for joint application design, after Carl Corcoran rejected the acronym JAL, or joint application logistics, upon realizing that Arnie Lind's initials were JAL (John Arnold Lind). The pilot project was an emergency room project for the Saskatchewan Government. Arnie developed the JAD methodology, and put together a one-week seminar, involving primarily nurses and administrators from the emergency room, but also including some application development personnel. The project was a huge success, as the one-week seminar produced a detailed application framework, which was then coded and implemented in less than one month, versus an average of 18 months for traditional application development. And because the users themselves designed the system, they immediately adopted and liked the application. After the pilot project, IBM was very supportive of the JAD methodology, as they saw it as a way to more quickly implement computing applications, running on IBM hardware. Arnie Lind spent the next 13 years at IBM Canada continuing to develop the JAD methodology, and traveling around the world performing JAD seminars, and training IBM employees in the methods and techniques of JAD. JADs were performed extensively throughout IBM Canada, and the technique also spread to IBM in the United States. Arnie Lind trained several people at IBM Canada to perform JADs, including Tony Crawford and Chuck Morris. Arnie Lind retired from IBM in 1987, and continued to teach and perform JADs on a consulting basis, throughout Canada, the United States, and Asia. The JAD process was formalized by Tony Crawford and Chuck Morris of IBM in the late 1970s. It was then deployed at Canadian International Paper. JAD was used in IBM Canada for a while before being brought back to the US. Initially, IBM used JAD to help sell and implement a software program they sold, called COPICS. It was widely adapted to many uses (system requirements, grain elevator design, problem-solving, etc.). Tony Crawford later developed JAD- Plan and then JAR (joint application requirements). In 1985, Gary Rush wrote about JAD and its derivations ‚Äì Facilitated Application Specification Techniques (FAST) ‚Äì in Computerworld.\\"A FAST Way to Define System Requirements\\", by Gary Rush, Computerworld, Volume 19 Number 40, In Depth pages ID/11 to ID/16 (pages 47 to 52), October 7, 1985. Transcript here. Originally, JAD was designed to bring system developers and users of varying backgrounds and opinions together in a productive as well as creative environment. The meetings were a way of obtaining quality requirements and specifications. The structured approach provides a good alternative to traditional serial interviews by system analysts. JAD has since expanded to cover broader IT work as well as non-IT work (read about Facilitated Application Specification Techniques ‚Äì FAST ‚Äì created by Gary Rush in 1985 to expand JAD applicability.JAD  FAST  FoCuSeD‚Ñ¢ Structured Facilitation Technique.) Key participants Executive Sponsor: The executive who charters the project, the system owner. They must be high enough in the organization to be able to make decisions and provide the necessary strategy, planning, and direction. Subject Matter Experts: These are the business users, the IS professionals, and the outside experts that will be needed for a successful workshop. This group is the backbone of the meeting; they will drive the changes. Facilitator/Session Leader: meeting and directs traffic by keeping the group on the meeting agenda. The facilitator is responsible for identifying those issues that can be solved as part of the meeting and those which need to be assigned at the end of the meeting for follow-up investigation and resolution. The facilitator serves the participants and does not contribute information to the meeting. Scribe/Modeller/Recorder/Documentation Expert: Records and publish the proceedings of the meeting and does not contribute information to the meeting. Observers: Generally members of the application development team assigned to the project. They are to sit behind the participants and are to silently observe the proceedings. 9 key steps #Identify project objectives and limitations: It is vital to have clear objectives for the workshop and for the project as a whole. The pre-workshop activities, the planning and scoping, set the expectations of the workshop sponsors and participants. Scoping identifies the business functions that are within the scope of the project. It also tries to assess both the project design and implementation complexity. The political sensitivity of the project should be assessed. Has this been tried in the past? How many false starts were there? How many implementation failures were there? Sizing is important. For best results, systems projects should be sized so that a complete design ‚Äì right down to screens and menus ‚Äì can be designed in 8 to 10 workshop days. #Identify critical success factors: It is important to identify the critical success factors for both the development project and the business function being studied. How will we know that the planned changes have been effective? How will success be measured? Planning for outcomes assessment helps to judge the effectiveness and the quality of the implemented system over its entire operational life. #Define project deliverables: In general, the deliverables from a workshop are documentation and a design. It is important to define the form and level of detail of the workshop documentation. What types of diagrams will be provided? What type or form of narrative will be supplied? It is a good idea to start using a CASE tool for diagramming support right from the start. Most of the available tools have good to great diagramming capabilities but their narrative support is generally weak. The narrative is best produced with your standard word processing software. #Define the schedule of workshop activities: Workshops vary in length from one to five days. The initial workshop for a project should not be less than three days. It takes the participants most of the first day to get comfortable with their roles, with each other, and with the environment. The second day is spent learning to understand each other and developing a common language with which to communicate issues and concerns. By the third day, everyone is working together on the problem and real productivity is achieved. After the initial workshop, the team-building has been done. Shorter workshops can be scheduled for subsequent phases of the project, for instance, to verify a prototype. However, it will take the participants from one to three hours to re-establish the team psychology of the initial workshop. #Select the participants: These are the business users, the IT professionals, and the outside experts that will be needed for a successful workshop. These are the true \\"back bones\\" of the meeting who will drive the changes. #Prepare the workshop material: Before the workshop, the project manager and the facilitator perform an analysis and build a preliminary design or straw man to focus the workshop. The workshop material consists of documentation, worksheets, diagrams, and even props that will help the participants understand the business function under investigation. #Organize workshop activities and exercises: The facilitator must design workshop exercises and activities to provide interim deliverables that build towards the final output of the workshop. The pre-workshop activities help design those workshop exercises. For example, for a Business Area Analysis, what's in it? A decomposition diagram? A high-level entity-relationship diagram? A normalized data model? A state transition diagram? A dependency diagram? All of the above? None of the above? It is important to define the level of technical diagramming that is appropriate to the environment. The most important thing about a diagram is that it must be understood by the users. Once the diagram choice is made, the facilitator designs exercises into the workshop agenda to get the group to develop those diagrams. A workshop combines exercises that are serially oriented to build on one another, and parallel exercises, with each sub-team working on a piece of the problem or working on the same thing for a different functional area. High-intensity exercises led by the facilitator energize the group and direct it towards a specific goal. Low-intensity exercises allow for detailed discussions before decisions. The discussions can involve the total group or teams can work out the issues and present a limited number of suggestions for the whole group to consider. To integrate the participants, the facilitator can match people with similar expertise from different departments. To help participants learn from each other, the facilitator can mix the expertise. It's up to the facilitator to mix and match the sub-team members to accomplish the organizational, cultural, and political objectives of the workshop. A workshop operates on both the technical level and the political level. It is the facilitator's job to build consensus and communications, to force issues out early in the process. There is no need to worry about the technical implementation of a system if the underlying business issues cannot be resolved. #Prepare, inform, educate the workshop participants: All of the participants in the workshop must be made aware of the objectives and limitations of the project and the expected deliverables of the workshop. Briefing of participants should take place 1 to 5 days before the workshop. This briefing may be teleconferenced if participants are widely dispersed. The briefing document might be called the Familiarization Guide, Briefing Guide, Project Scope Definition, or the Management Definition Guide ‚Äì or anything else that seems appropriate. It is a document of eight to twelve pages, and it provides a clear definition of the scope of the project for the participants. The briefing itself lasts two to four hours. It provides the psychological preparation everyone needs to move forward into the workshop. #Coordinate workshop logistics: Workshops should be held off-site to avoid interruptions. Projectors, screens, PCs, tables, markers, masking tape, Post-It notes, and many other props should be prepared. What specific facilities and props are needed is up to the facilitator. They can vary from simple flip charts to electronic white boards. In any case, the layout of the room must promote the communication and interaction of the participants. Advantages * JAD decreases time and costs associated with requirements elicitation process. During 2-4 weeks information not only is collected, but requirements, agreed upon by various system users, are identified. Experience with JAD allows companies to customize their systems analysis process into even more dynamic ones like Double Helix, a methodology for mission-critical work. * JAD sessions help bring experts together giving them a chance to share their views, understand views of others, and develop the sense of project ownership. * The methods of JAD implementation are well- known, as it is \\"the first accelerated design technique available on the market and probably best known\\", and can easily be applied by any organization. * Easy integration of CASE tools into JAD workshops improves session productivity and provides systems analysts with discussed and ready to use models. Challenges * Without multifaceted preparation for a JAD session, professionals' valuable time can be easily wasted. If JAD session organizers do not study the elements of the system being evaluated, an incorrect problem could be addressed, incorrect people could be invited to participate, and inadequate problem-solving resources could be used. * JAD workshop participants should include employees able to provide input on most, if not all, of the pertinent areas of the problem. This is why particular attention should be paid during participant selection. The group should consist not only of employees from various departments who will interact with the new system, but from different hierarchies of the organizational ladder. The participants may have conflicting points of view, but meeting will allow participants to see issues from different viewpoints. JAD brings to light a better model outline with better understanding of underlying processes. * The facilitator has an obligation to ensure all participants not only the most vocal ones have a chance to offer their opinions, ideas, and thoughts.

Education and early career Baker was born in Tiffin, Ohio. His father, Edwin Baker, was a merchant, and his mother, Martha Ranney Thomas, had been a schoolteacher. His health in his early life was so poor that he did not begin school until the age of 12, before which time he was taught by his mother. After graduating public school he went on to Heidelberg College. He graduated with a B.S. degree in history and mathematics at the age of 19 in 1903, and took an M.S. degree in philosophy and sociology a year later. The next year he went on to Columbia University, receiving an M.A. in political science in 1905. He studied forestry at Yale University School of Forestry from 1907 to 1908, and later did graduate work at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in agriculture. From 1908 to 1912 he worked with the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison's Agricultural Experiment Station. Baker co- authored a bulletin for the Experiment Station, which studied the climate of Wisconsin and its effects on agriculture, published in 1912. From 1910 to 1912 he also worked with the Wisconsin Soil Survey during the summers. By 1912 he took a job with the United States Department of Agriculture, where he would stay for the next thirty years. Baker's work was noticed rather quickly, in part because of his contributions to the Yearbooks from 1915 to 1938, several of which he edited. For the first eighteen years at the USDA he was devoted to studying the geographical aspects of land use. One of his first works, co- authoring Geography of the World's Agriculture (1917) with Vernor Clifford Finch, led him to even wider recognition. Shortly after its publication, Baker returned to the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison for further graduate study, in economics, and earned his Ph.D. in 1921 with a dissertation on land utilization. While there, Baker had been influenced by Henry Charles Taylor and Richard T. Ely, two notable economists, to shift his work more toward the economic aspect of geography and agriculture. In 1922 he joined the USDA's new Bureau of Agricultural Economics, headed by Henry C. Taylor. With the success of the Geography of the World's Agriculture, he instigated work on the Atlas of American Agriculture, on which he himself was planner and editor. The massive work was released in six parts between 1918 and 1936. Baker acted as a part-time professor at Clark University from 1923 to 1927, and later gave several series of lectures at other universities. With the appearance of the journal Economic Geography, Baker became associate editor, and later a contributor of a notable series of articles on regional agricultural geography of North America. His interest in farm populations started around 1920, however it was during the 1930s that this field became a major focus of the USDA. Baker was particularly interested in the migration of rural youths into urban areas. Even into his later years, populations problems occupied much of his research and energies. Baker recognized that only a minority of the world's population lived under decent living conditions. He turned his attention to improving standards for American farmers. He hoped to achieve this by raising the level of appreciation for farmers and their contributions within the United States, and studying recent trends to aid in planning and forecasting potential problems. He also tried to encourage Americans to have larger families in order to ensure successful future generations in the country. Baker had been critical of many aspects of urban life, and collaborated with Ralph Borsodi on Agriculture in Modern Life (1939), advocating a return to rural living. He himself however suggested more of a \\"rurban\\" lifestyle, which combined aspects of both urban and rural life. He married in 1925 to Alice Hargrave Crew. They had four children together- Helen, Sabra, Edwin, and Mildred- and raised them in then-suburban College Park, Maryland with five acres where they were able to raise chicken and cows and have a garden. He later bought a large farm near New Market, Virginia where he could take up his interest in soil conservation. In 1931 he was elected president of the Association of American Geographers, and received honorary doctorates from Heidelberg College in Ohio and the University of G√∂ttingen in Germany. Career at College Park, Maryland Baker left Washington D.C. for the University of Maryland, College Park in 1942, accepting an invitation to establish a Department of Geography there. Baker assembled the Department's faculty himself and attracted many students, as well as promoted many research projects. He retired from his position in July 1949 in order to devote himself to completing his various research projects. His main work at the time was the Atlas of World Resources, which was being created by the USDA and the Bureau of Mines, but also initiated the China Atlas, continuing a long interest of his in China. However, neither of these works were completed by the time of his death. Baker had always been highly dedicated to teaching and gave his time generously to students and visitors. Having suffered from health problems his entire life, he died in his home in College Park, Maryland.

Biography = Occupational background = Chadwick was a lawyer, admitted to the New York State Bar on May 30, 1850. He soon made his way to Oregon, setting up a law firm in Douglas County in the settlement of Scottsburg on April 21, 1851. Chadwick served as the town's first postmaster. =Early political career= After moving from Scottsburg to Roseburg, Chadwick ran for the newly created position of Judge of Douglas County. Later, he represented Douglas County at the State Constitutional Convention, in 1857. In the 1864 and 1868 Presidential elections, Chadwick served as a Democratic elector. Chadwick won the 1870 election to the position of Secretary of State, and was subsequently reelected in 1874. Chadwick is credited for having originated the idea while Secretary of State to make June 15 an Oregon state holiday called \\"Pioneer Day.\\"Chadwick first advanced the notion in a letter to Oregon Pioneer Association President J.W. Grim on November 19, 1873. See: Transactions of the Nineteenth Annual Reunion of the Oregon Pioneer Society for 1891. Portland, OR: A. Anderson & Co., 1891; pg. 32. The date of the occasion was selected in honor of the signing of the 1846 treaty between the United States and Great Britain formally settling their contested claims to the Oregon Territory. =Governorship= In 1877 La Fayette Grover resigned the governorship after his election to the United States Senate by the State Legislature. Chadwick, as Secretary of State and second in the gubernatorial line of succession, was inaugurated to fill out the remaining year of Governor Grover's term. Although unconstitutional under Article V, Section 1 of the State Constitution, Chadwick also kept his position of Secretary of State. When signing official documents requiring the signatures of both the Secretary of State and Governor, he would sign first on the left side, then on the right. The most notable policy of his administration was Chadwick's stand on the Nez Perce War raging in the northeastern part of the state. Chadwick was unhappy with the stalemated situation, going so far as to inspect the front lines first-hand. He aided white settlers during the conflict, and argued for much harsher punishments for rebellious and uncooperative tribal leaders than the Army's policies. At the time of the 1878 elections, Governor Chadwick declined a second term and went back to practicing law. =Death and legacy= Stephen F. Chadwick died on February 15, 1895, in Salem, Oregon.

Elaan is a mission film about five characters and their plan against one man. Produced by Ganesh Jain and Ratan Jain and directed by Vikram Bhatt, the film stars Mithun Chakraborty, John Abraham, Rahul Khanna, Arjun Rampal, Lara Dutta and Amisha Patel. The film marked the return of Superstar Mithun Chakraborty to the Bollywood film industry after starring in low budget productions based at Ooty, known as Mithun's Dream Factory for a decade. It managed to do well and was an average grosser at the Box-office. Plot Modern-day secular India is held at ransom by powerful criminal Baba Sikander (Mithun Chakraborty) and his brothers, Aftab (Milind Gunaji) and Sameer (Prithvi Zutshi). They begin by demanding money from wealthy businessmen; when their victims refuse to pay, they are killed. One of their victims is Kantilal Shah, a rich businessman. Karan Shah (Rahul Khanna) is Kantilal's adopted son. He was a mere canteen boy who was spotted and adopted by Kantilal while trying to secretly listen to a board-room discussion. He gained his father's trust over the years and was gradually given the responsibility of running the family business, much to the chagrin of his step-sister, Anjali. Upon hearing that his father's life is in danger, Karan returns from America and convinces his father not to give in to the extortionist's demands and instead ask him to provide that amount to his past victims and their families. Kantilal agrees. Then five days later, a day after his birthday, Kantilal is gunned down in the elevator along with four of his bodyguards. Anjali openly renounces Karan and asks him not to participate in her father's funeral. A shocked and devastated Karan announces to Baba that he will apprehend and bring him to justice in India, no matter where he had to look. However, Karan finds out that Baba is hiding in Italy, which does not have an extradition treaty with India. Thus, unable to take any legal action, Karan recruits some mercenaries to go with him to Italy and help him bring Baba back to India. The first man he chooses is a suspended former police inspector, Arjun Srivastav (Arjun Rampal), who had located and brutally killed his then pregnant wife's assailants on his own and now lives as a single parent with his school-going daughter. After some persuasion from Karan and his daughter alike, Arjun agrees. Arjun recommends that the second man involved be Abhimanyu (John Abraham), who is currently in Vashi Jail and had been Baba's chauffeur and hitman before being framed by Baba and his associates following a failed job. Abhimanyu is rescued in broad daylight by Arjun and his men, who were pretending to be doctors, on the pretext of a medical checkup (The escapade takes place dramatically, in a style adopted from the film Spy Game to spring Elizabeth Hadley (Catherine McCormack) from a Chinese prison.) Arjun and Karan convince Abhimanyu to help them with vital information about Baba and his gang in return for a heavy payment. He reluctantly agrees to do so. The trio then go to Venice (where Baba is said to be, based on Abhimanyu's information). There, Abhimanyu meets his girlfriend Sonia (Lara Dutta) and tries backing out of the mission by passing of Sonia as Baba's girlfriend who wants a huge amount of money for the information she would supposedly provide. Thus, under this pretext, he double crosses Arjun and Karan, takes the money, and tries escaping with the money along with Sonia. Before he can do so, both he and Sonia are kidnapped by Baba and his men. Priya (Amisha Patel), a press reporter from Aaj Tak, looking for a story on Karan earlier, has followed the two there, using a satellite tracker for mobile phones. She meets them and tells them about Abhimanyu's deceit. Despite this, The three go to rescue Abhimanyu and Sonia, in a lengthy gunfight and high speed car chase. Karan and Arjun are angry at Abhimanyu's betrayal, however the latter apologizes and agrees to help them in return for their saving his life since he intends to settle scores with Salim (Chunky Pandey), one of Baba's trusted aides who had been instrumental in helping Baba set him up. The five then go and apprehend Salim and after some effort, he divulges at gunpoint that Baba is in Munich. Abhimanyu then shoots him for his betrayal. Karan finds Baba in Munich and tells him about Salim's death much to Baba's devastation, reiterating his warning that he would fulfil his promise of bringing the latter back to India at any cost. In course of time, the group become good friends. Acting on a tip, when they go to Baba's guest house in Munich to catch him red handed, they are fooled and are then surrounded by Baba and his men. A lengthy gunfight follows, in the course of which, Arjun dies while getting into a jeep. Baba now warns Karan to leave him alone and save his own life and that of the others while there is still time. Devastated, Karan feels that bringing the others on the mission was a big mistake, much to Abhimanyu's fury. However he takes a final stand as Priya motivates him not to give up the fight at this point, reasoning that he had always been right, once when he had asked his father not to give in to Baba's demands and even now, when he had decided to gather the group to bring Baba back to India. Karan and Abhimanyu, now go to apprehend Baba as he leaves the country through the French border. Sonia and Priya alert the French Border Police as France has an extradition treaty with India. The trick works, as Baba is cornered by Karan, Abhimanyu and the French border police just as he is crossing the border. A long and devastating gunfight ensues, at the end of which many of Baba's most trusted aides are killed. Finally, Baba is left alone and stranded after Karan stops Abhimanyu from shooting him, reasoning that the terror Baba inspired in people had to end and this would thus end Baba's life in turn. Baba is sent to India, sentenced to death and hanged. Karan becomes a national hero for his feat. He reconciles with his sister and finally marries Priya. The couple adopt Arjun's daughter, Ayesha. Abhimanyu and Sonia also get married and settle down in Venice.

At the age of 15 he began playing with Earl Bostic and later studied at the New England Conservatory. In 1964 he relocated to New York and became active in the free jazz scene. Biography Logan played alto and tenor saxophone, bass clarinet, flute, piano and oboe. He collaborated with Archie Shepp, Pharoah Sanders and Bill Dixon before forming his own quartet made up of pianist Don Pullen, bassist Eddie G√≥mez and percussionist Milford Graves. After Pullen's departure, pianist Dave Burrell joined the group. Logan was a member of Byard Lancaster's band and toured with and appeared on records by Patty Waters. He recorded two albums for the ESP- Disk record label and later appeared on an album by Roswell Rudd on the Impulse! label. A 1965 press release from ESP-Disk indicates that a third album was planned, but never released, possibly due to Logan's increasingly erratic behavior. This title was supposed to have been ESP-1018, The Giuseppi Logan Chamber Ensemble in Concert,Robert Ostermann, \\"The Moody Men Who Play The New Music\\", National Observer, June 7, 1965. but this catalogue number was eventually assigned to an album by The Fugs.

Several of these are below. Bill Dixon on Logan: > [In the summer of 1964], Giuseppi Logan was 'studying' with me, meaning: he > wanted to know certain things, and I needed an alto player, so he played all > of my concerts, and occasionally I would let him have some of his things > played in the group.

Beset with personal problems, Logan vanished from the music scene in the early 1970s and for over three decades his whereabouts were unknown; however, in 2008 he was filmed by a Christian mission group just after he had returned to New York after years in and out of institutions in the Carolinas. Around this same time filmmaker Suzannah Troy made the first of many short films of Logan practicing in his preferred hangout, Tompkins Square Park. Subsequently, he was the subject of a major piece by Pete Gershon in the spring 2009 edition of Signal to Noise Magazine, which detailed the events surrounding Logan's \\"comeback\\" gig at the Bowery Poetry Club in February 2009. On April 6, 2009, Logan performed, with a group, at Local 269 in NYC as part of the RUCMA performance series.

Alfred became ill after his inoculation against the smallpox virus; his early death at the age of nearly two, along with the demise of his brother Prince Octavius six months later, was a shock to their parents. In his later bouts of madness King George would have imagined conversations with both of his youngest sons. Life Prince Alfred was born on 22 September 1780, at Windsor Castle, Windsor, England. His father was King George III, his mother Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The prince was baptised by Frederick Cornwallis, The Archbishop of Canterbury, in the Great Council Chamber at St James's Palace on 21 October 1780. His godparents were The Prince of Wales (his eldest brother), The Prince Frederick (his second brother) and The Princess Royal (his eldest sister). As his parents' fourteenth child and ninth son, his birth was no surprise but it did bring joy to his family, especially to his older sister Sophia, who, their sister Elizabeth reported, called the new baby her \\"grandson\\". =Death and aftermath= In 1782, Prince Alfred was inoculated against smallpox. The sickness proved too much for the child and in June he was taken to Deal with his governess Lady Charlotte Finch to recover. It was hoped that the sea air, bathing in the water, and horseback riding would improve his condition. While he was there, Alfred endeared himself to many, including an old woman to whom he waved. In spite of his charming disposition, he continued to break out in spots and his chest was troubling him. When he returned to Windsor in August 1782, the doctors inspected him and realized that the boy had only weeks to live. After suffering bouts of fever and continuing problems with his chest, Prince Alfred died on 20 August 1782, at Windsor Castle, Berkshire, not even two years old. Although the household did not go into mourning (it was not prescribed for royal children younger than fourteen), his parents took the loss harshly. According to Lady Charlotte Finch, the Queen \\"cried vastly\\" and was \\"very much hurt by her loss and the King also.\\" Later in August 1782 the Queen sent Finch a lock of Alfred's hair stating \\"Receive This ... as an Acknowledgement for Your very affectionate attendance upon my dear little Angel Alfred, and wear the inclosed Hair, not only in remembrance of that dear Object, but also as a mark of esteem from Your Affectionate Queen\\". Alfred was buried at Westminster Abbey, though his remains were later moved to the Royal Vault in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on 11 February 1820. His father continued to dwell on his death, and the sight of Alfred's posthumous portrait in a family painting by Thomas Gainsborough nearly a year after Alfred's death sent his three eldest sisters into tears. Six months after Alfred's death, his elder brother Octavius succumbed to the smallpox virus, further devastating the king. During one of his bouts of madness in 1812, George would have imaginary conversations with his two youngest sons. His youngest sister Princess Amelia was conceived in the months after Alfred's death, born almost exactly a year after he died. The first of George III and Queen Charlotte's children to die, Alfred died nearly seventy five years before his older sister Mary, who was the last survivor of George III and Queen Charlotte's fifteen children. Alfred is also unique among their first fourteen children for never being an older sibling while he was alive, as the only child younger than him was born after his death.

During the Grand Duchy  As of 1823 in the Grand Duchy of Finland, death sentences were commuted to transportation to Siberia or other lesser sentences. The last person to be executed in peacetime was Tahvo Putkonen, on 8 July 1825. The capital punishment was de facto abolished during the rest of the Czarist regime 1825‚Äì1917 in Finland.  From the Civil War to World War 2  Execution of a Soviet infiltrator during the World War 2 During and right after the Finnish Civil War of 1918 there were many executions, most done without due process. Approximately 1,400‚Äì1,650 Whites and 7,000‚Äì10,000 Reds were executed by the opposing side. The executions were invariably carried out by firing squad. The Shoot on the Spot Declaration allowed White commanders to summarily execute prisoners, something which was of questionable legality, but this issue became moot after general amnesties. During the Winter War and Continuation War approximately 550 death sentences were carried out. 455 (some ninety percent) of those executed were Soviet infiltrators, spies and saboteurs. The officer's authority to execute soldiers refusing to obey commands or fleeing from combat was exercised only in 13 cases. The most famous case is the execution of conscientious objector Arndt Pekurinen in autumn 1941, who was also the penultimate Finn ever to be executed for civilian crimes (conscientious objection during wartime was considered high treason). As he declined taking a rifle and going to the front line, he was sentenced to death without trial for disobedience by his commanding officer, Captain Valkonen. Nobody in his battalion volunteered for the firing squad, and Captain Valkonen had to use threat of punishment to order a soldier, Corporal Asikainen, to shoot him. Pekurinen's death was widely considered miscarriage of justice by his service mates. The last Finn to be executed for civilian crimes was Toivo \\"Kirves\\" (Axe) Koljonen, who killed a family of six with an axe in 1942. He was shot by a military police firing squad along with Soviet spies sentenced to death for espionage in 1943. The last woman executed in Finland was Martta Koskinen, shot for espionage and high treason in 1943. The last Finn to be executed for any crimes was Private Olavi Laiho, who was shot for desertion, high treason and espionage in Oulu, 2 September 1944. One day later a group of three Soviet infiltrators were shot, as the last persons to be executed in Finland.  In Post-war Finland  In independent Finland, capital punishment for crimes committed in peacetime was abolished by law in 1949, and in 1972 it was abolished entirely. In addition, the current Constitution of Finland, adopted in 2000, --specifically Chapter 2, Section 7-- prohibits capital punishment:  Methods  In the 19th century and before, as in the other Nordic countries, beheading by axe was the most common method of execution. In the 20th century, firing squads were used. The official beheading axe of Finland is today on display at Museum of Crime, Vantaa. Some notable lasts: * Last person executed in peacetime in Finland: Tahvo Putkonen, 1825, beheaded with axe for murder * Last person hanged in Finland: Taavetti Lukkarinen, 1916, at Oulu. He was hanged for high treason under Czarist Russian martial law. Instead of gallows, he was hanged in a pine tree. The tree is today protected as a memorial. * Last person executed for a civilian crime in Finland: Toivo Koljonen, 1943, by firing squad for six murders. * Last woman executed in Finland: Martta Koskinen, 1943, by firing squad for espionage and high treason. * Last Finn executed: Private Olavi Laiho, 2 September 1944, by firing squad for desertion, espionage and high treason. * Last person executed in Finland: a group of three Soviet infiltrators, 3 September 1944, by firing squad for espionage. Reappearance On 16 December 2015, Teuvo Hakkarainen, a member of Finnish Parliament and Finns Party, inquired Minister of Justice (who is also a member of the same party) if capital punishment could be re-enacted. This was in reference to the court case against two Iraqi asylum seekers, who were members of ISIS, for 11 murders. Hakkarainen commented that repeated murder would justify capital punishment, even if done by a native Finn. Some members of the Parliament condemned his suggestion.

Six months after the death of his brother Prince Alfred, Octavius was inoculated with the smallpox virus. Several days later, he became ill. His subsequent death at the age of four devastated his parents, and in particular his father. George bemoaned the death of his son, of whom he was exceedingly fond; the king's later bouts of madness would involve hallucinations of his two youngest sons.  Life  Octavius in 1782, by Thomas Gainsborough Prince Octavius was born on 23 February 1779, at Buckingham House, London, England. He was the thirteenth child and eighth son of King George III and his queen consort Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The prince's name derives from Latin octavus, \\"eighth\\", indicating that he was the eighth son of his parents. The House of Lords sent congratulations to the King on his birth. Octavius was christened on 23 March 1779, in the Great Council Chamber at St James's Palace, by Frederick Cornwallis, The Archbishop of Canterbury. His godparents were The Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel (husband of his first cousin twice- removed, for whom The Earl of Hertford, Lord Chamberlain, stood proxy); The Duke of Mecklenburg (his first cousin once-removed, for whom The Earl of Ashburnham, Groom of the Stole, stood proxy); and The Duchess of Saxe-Weimar- Eisenach (wife of his sixth cousin, for whom Alicia Wyndham, Countess of Egremont and Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Charlotte, was proxy). King George was extremely devoted to Octavius, who was too young to cause the kinds of trouble that his elder brothers were by the year of his birth. The king was affectionate and indulgent with his young children, and strove to attend their birthday parties and other events organized for their merriment; on one occasion a friend witnessed a happy domestic scene that involved George \\"carrying about in his arms by turns Sophia and the last prince, Octavius.\\" Another witness wrote George and Charlotte \\"have their Children always playing about them the whole time\\"; during most evenings the children were brought to their parents between 6 and 7 O'clock to play for an hour or two. The king also was kept informed of his children's educational progress. Octavius was close to his nearest sister Sophia, who called Octavius \\"her son\\", and went with her and their siblings, Elizabeth and Edward to Eastborne on the Sussex coast, where he could take in the fresh seaside air during the summer of 1780. When he was nineteen months old, Octavius became an older brother with the birth of his younger brother Prince Alfred. Octavius was three years of age when Alfred died on 20 August 1782, and he again became the youngest surviving child. Horace Walpole wrote to Sir Horace Mann that upon Prince Alfred's death, King George had declared \\"I am very sorry for Alfred; but had it been Octavius, I should have died too.\\" In 1820, historian Edward Holt would write of the prince's character, \\"Though Prince Octavius had not passed his fifth year, he was considered very docile, and possessed good-nature in such an uncommon degree, that he was the delight of all about him.\\" Biographer John Watkins added Octavius was \\"reckoned one of the finest of the royal progeny.\\"  Death and aftermath  Apotheosis of Prince Octavius in 1783, by Benjamin West Six months after Alfred's death, Octavius and Sophia were taken to Kew Palace in London to be inoculated with the smallpox virus. While Sophia recovered without incident, Octavius became ill and died several days later, around 8 o'clock PM, on 3 May 1783, at Kew Palace. He was four years old. As was traditional, the household did not go into mourning for the deaths of royal children under the age of fourteen. Octavius has the distinction of being the last member of the British royal family to suffer from smallpox. On 10 May, he was buried alongside his brother Alfred at Westminster Abbey. Their eldest brother, when King George IV, ordered their remains transferred to St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on 11 February 1820, at about 3 o'clock. According to Queen Charlotte, Octavius's death was unexpected; she wrote to a friend who faced a similar tragedy that \\"twice have I felt what you do feel, the last time without the least preparation for such a stroke, for in less than eight and forty hours was my son Octavius, in perfect health, sick and struck with death immediately.\\" The prince's death had a marked effect, both mentally and physically on Queen Charlotte, who at the time was pregnant with her youngest child, Princess Amelia. Octavius's death devastated his father; Walpole wrote \\"the King has lost another little child; a lovely boy, they say, of whom their Majesties were dotingly fond.\\" Shortly afterward, King George said \\"There will be no Heaven for me if Octavius is not there.\\" The day after his son's death, the King passed through a room where artist Thomas Gainsborough was completing the finishing touches on a portrait of the family. The King asked him to stop, but when he found out that the painting was of Octavius, allowed the painter to continue. When this same painting was exhibited a week later, Octavius's sisters were so upset that they broke down and cried in front of everyone. Three months after Octavius's death, his father was still dwelling on his son, writing to Lord Dartmouth that every day \\"increases the chasm I feel for want of that beloved object [Octavius].\\" In later years, King George imagined conversations with his two youngest sons. During one of the king's bouts of madness in 1788, George mistook a pillow for Octavius, who by that time had been dead for five years.

Biography Mainly a painter of oil and watercolour landscapes of his native Norfolk in England, Horace Tuck also travelled to France (particularly Dinan in Brittany), the Lake District and other parts of Britain on painting expeditions. Tuck's work was regularly exhibited in Norwich (he was a member of the Norwich Art Circle) and in London galleries, including in Bond Street. Apart from his earliest works, his paintings tend not to be dated. He trained at Norwich School of Art, where he became friendly with Alfred Munnings, and at Borough Road Training College, Isleworth, West London. Horace Tuck also illustrated books on local subjects, including Inns and Taverns of Old Norwich. His wife, Elizabeth Mary, known as Bessie, was originally one of his pupils and an artist in her own right. They were married in 1910 and lived in Branksome Road, Norwich, until Tuck retired in 1939. They then moved to Sheringham, on the Norfolk coast, where Tuck continued to paint until his death aged 75. His widow Bessie died in 1965, and there are memorials to her and to her husband at St Faiths Crematorium near Norwich. They had no children. Horace Tuck's paintings have occasionally turned up at auction in the past, but a discovery of around 200 of his paintings and a major exhibition in Holt, Norfolk in 2006 (with another scheduled for early March 2008) has created renewed interest in the artist. His later style has been compared by Simon Butler (in Lost Norfolk Landscapes: Paintings by Horace Tuck) to the work of British artists Ivon Hitchens and Paul Nash, suggesting that, despite Tuck's conventional choice of subject matter, he was not immune to the influences of modernism. Some of his works are in the collection of the Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery. References *Butler, Simon (2006). Lost Norfolk Landscapes: Paintings by Horace Tuck. Halsgrove.

In practice, they are more successful at having penalties and other fees abated than most other businesses, mainly because tax authorities have a stake in the success and longevity of bureaus simply because they make the tax man's job easier. There are several ways a bureau can move money from the client to the people whom the client must pay. The simplest way is when a bureau prints checks on blank check stock, printing the client's account number in MICR digits at the bottom of the check, resulting in the funds being drawn directly from the client when the check is cashed. Other bureaus initiate automated clearing house (ACH) transactions from the client, and remit payment either electronically or in the form of paper checks against the bureau's holding account. Because finance transactions can be enormous (thousands to hundreds of thousands per pay period per client), bureaus often consider the interest earned (\\"float\\") on those amounts in the interim to be a substantial source of revenue. The interim is the period of time between when the funds are collected from the employer (client), and either when the paper checks are cashed, or when electronic payments (in the case of taxes) become due on their due dates.  Different types of bureaus  In the United States, there are several nationwide chains for financial processing. Then there are countless local bureaus which vary in scope and size. Because local bureaus tend to only a very narrow geographic area and often see themselves as competing together against the nationwide giants rather than one another, they often band together and form alliances and trade associations whereby they share expertise and consolidate their negotiating power with their vendors. There are specific and distinct perceived differences between having finance processed by a national chain and a local bureau. National chains have experience under their belts, and have a standard set of well documented processes. Local bureaus vary in their ability to accommodate special needs, they also add a level of service that can be lost in the national arena. Local bureaus have opportunities to at meeting specific local and national needs. This is also particularly true in regions whose needs are heavily influenced by a single industry. In addition to the national and local bureau options, there are also financial providers who can accommodate any industry versus providers who maintain a very niched or specialized focus on a single industry. The existence of single-industry financial bureaus is dependent on the finance complexities of the industry itself and the desire or need to handle unique requirements. Companies should always perform their due diligence when selecting a bureau and compare both traditional providers along with those who focus on their industry. It is common practice in the US bureau industry to purchase and resell private-labeled products and from other vendors to enhance the offering. Specifically, products such as time clocks, ATM \\"pay\\" cards, savings or cafeteria plans, Workers' Compensation insurance and finance data-entry web sites, are actually the products of companies with expertise in these specific, and are generally branded so that the customer is unaware of the third party's influence. This type of arrangement is desirable to bureaus as it allows them to show a competitive portfolio of that rivals that of the national chains. Businesses may decide to outsource their finance functions to reduce the costs involved in having financial trained employees in-house as well as the costs of systems and software needed to process finance. In the UK, finance bureaus will deal with all HM Revenue & Customs enquiries and deal with employee's queries. Financial bureaus also produce reports for the businesses' account department and payslips for the employees and can also make the payments to the employees if required. Some may decide that a smaller or local bureau can offer a more consistent and personal than a large nationwide bureau that deals with several thousand financial can. Another reason many UK businesses outsource is because of the ever increasing complexity of finance legislation. Annual changes in tax codes, PAYE and National Insurance bands as well as more and more statutory payments and deductions having to go through the finance often mean there is a lot to keep abreast of in order to maintain compliance with the current legislation. Unlike in the USA, fines and penalties for compliance issues remain the responsibility of an employer, even if they have outsourced their administration.  Bureau software  At the heart of every bureau is the computer system that performs the calculations. Bureau software is created solely for finance professionals and has one purpose: to mass-produce accurate financials for many companies simultaneously. There are only a handful of bureau software vendors in the United States, and the choice of computer system used by the bureau is often a deciding factor for their clients as the software choice often determines what the bureau can regularly render. The software choice is also significant in that bureau trade associations are often formed based on the choice of software, as they generally face the same challenges and offer the same in the same manner. The common wisdom of \\"newer is better\\" that applies to most software, does not apply in the bureau industry. Due to the complexity and potential for expensive errors that goes with, moving clients from one system to another, it is very common for older software to be in just as much use as newer software. Clients generally have a low tolerance for errors, simply because finance is a high-dollar affair that can become very expensive when mistakes are made - and this results in significant apprehensiveness on the part of the bureau to simply switch from one software package to another. A bureau software package that has been in for ten years may be based on obsolete operating systems such as DOS and lack Internet functionality, but on the other hand, such software has the advantage of a proven history and a body of real-world experience using it.

Its techniques combine those of archaeology with those of diving to become Underwater archaeology. However, shipwrecks are discovered on what have become terrestrial sites. It is necessary to understand the processes and theories by which a wreck site is formed to take into account the distortions in the archaeological material caused by the filtering and scrambling of material remains that occurs during and after the wrecking process. Prior to being wrecked, the ship would have operated as an organised machine, and its crew, equipment, passengers and cargo need to be considered as a system. The material remains should provide clues to the functions of seaworthiness, navigation and propulsion as well as to ship-board life. These clues can also infer how a ship functioned, in special regards to social, political, and economic systems. These underwater shipwreck sites are protected under the UNESCO Convention.  UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage Shipwrecks that have been underwater for one hundred years or more are protected by the UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage. This convention aims at preventing looting and the destruction or loss of historic and cultural information. It helps states parties to protect their underwater cultural heritage with an international legal framework. Theories of shipwrecks =Muckelroy's model= A systematic model for the characterisation and interpretation of the archaeology of shipwrecks was first proposed by Keith Muckelroy in 1976 in a paper on the Kennemerland, which was wrecked in 1664.. Muckelroy's system model describes the evolution of the material remains of the ship from the wrecking process, subsequent salvage operations and the disintegration and rearrangements of the remains from environmental factors. Although Muckelroy considered both natural processes and human activity in his model, subsequent research has mainly expanded the environmental factors and there has been little published on the human processes. =Considering human intervention= A paper by Martin Gibbs in 2006, expands Muckelroy's model to consider human behaviour at the time of the disaster and the long term relationship between people and shipwrecks. This model uses studies of humans involved in disasters to characterise the human activity into phases around the time of the wrecking. This model considers: * Pre-impact threat phase, in which humans considering the risk may take avoiding action which results in there being no wreck, or may take unsuccessful action to mitigate the perceived threat, for example the wreck location may be the result of attempting to avoid some perceived greater threat. Stowage of cargo may also indicate consideration of threat. * Pre-impact warning phase, in which humans may take drastic action to avoid catastrophe, for example, running a vessel ashore, jettisoning cargo or running out anchors. * Impact, in which the decision is made to abandon ship or remain aboard, and, for example, attempt to refloat. * Post impact, where survivors regroup and, for example, salvage their own goods or make repairs. * Rescue and Post-disaster where the vessel is abandoned and in which third parties may be involved in salvage or in removing remains that present a hazard to navigation. Preservation of material underwater Of the many examples where the sea bed provides an extremely hostile environment for submerged evidence of history, one of the most notable, the RMS Titanic, though a relatively young wreck and in deep water so calcium-starved that concretion does not occur, appears strong and relatively intact, though indications are that it has already incurred irreversible degradation of her steel and iron hull. As such degradation inevitably continues, data will be forever lost, objects' context will be destroyed and the bulk of the wreck will over centuries completely deteriorate on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. Comparative evidence shows that all iron and steel ships, especially those in a highly oxygenated environment, continue to degrade and will continue to do so until only their engines and other machinery project much above the sea- floor.McCarthy, M., 2000, Iron and steamship archaeology : success and failure of the SS Xantho. New York : Kluwer Academic/Plenum. Where it remains even after the passage of time, the iron or steel hull is often fragile with no remaining metal within the layer of concretion and corrosion products. The USS Monitor, having been found in the 1970s, was subjected to a program of attempted in situ preservation, for example, but deterioration of the vessel progressed at such a rate that the rescue of her turret was undertaken lest nothing be saved from the wreck. Some wrecks, lost to natural obstacles to navigation, are at risk of being smashed by subsequent wrecks sunk by the same hazard, or are deliberately destroyed because they present a hazard to navigation. Even in deep water, commercial activities such as pipe-laying operations and deep sea trawling can place a wreck at risk. Such a wreck is the Mardi Gras shipwreck sunk in the Gulf of Mexico in 4,000 feet (1220 meters) of water. The shipwreck lay forgotten at the bottom of the sea until it was discovered in 2002 by an oilfield inspection crew working for the Okeanos Gas Gathering Company (OGGC). Large pipelines can crush sites and render some of their remnants inaccessible as pipe is dropped from the ocean surface to the substrate thousands of feet below. Trawl nets snag and tear superstructures and separate artifacts from their context. \\"When a ship is wrecked, it suffers many changes of state until the remains eventually reach equilibrium with their environment. Initially, the wrecking process changes it from the human organised form of a working vessel to an unstable state of structure and artefacts underwater. Natural forces act upon it during the wrecking process and continue to act until equilibrium is reached. Heavy items sink rapidly, lighter items may drift before sinking, while buoyant items may float away completely. This causes a filtering and scrambling of the material remains. The sudden arrival of a structure on the seabed will change the currents, often resulting in new scour and deposition patterns in the seabed.\\" Once underwater, chemical processes and the action of biological organisms will contribute to the disintegration. At any point in these processes, humans may have intervened, for example by salvaging items of value. Vasa, a Swedish warship that foundered and sank on its maiden voyage in 1628. It was salvaged in 1961 and is now on permanent display at the Vasa Museum in Stockholm. The wrecks, and other archaeological sites that have been preserved have generally survived because the dynamic nature of the sea bed can result in artifacts becoming rapidly buried in sediments. These sediments then provide an anaerobic environment which protects from further degradation. Wet environments, whether on land in the form of peat bogs and wells, or underwater are particularly important for the survival of organic material, such as wood, leather, fabric and horn. Cold and absence of light also aid survival of artifacts, because there is little energy available for either organic activity or chemical reactions. Salt water provides for greater organic activity than freshwater, and in particular, the shipworm, teredo navalis, lives only in salt water, so some of the best preservation in the absence of sediments has been found in the cold, dark waters of the Great Lakes in North America and in the (low salinity) Baltic Sea (where the Vasa was preserved). = Interpretation and presentation of shipwrecks = Diver trails also called wreck trails can be used to allow scuba-divers to visit and understand archaeological sites that are suitable for scuba-divinge.g. Souter, C., 2006 Cultural Tourism and Diver Education. In Maritime Archaeology: Australian Approaches. The Springer Series in Underwater Archaeology. Staniforth, M. & Nash, M. (eds) Springer, New York. One excellent example is the Florida Public Archaeology Network's (FPAN) \\"Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail.\\" The Florida Panhandle Shipwreck Trail features 12 shipwrecks including artificial reefs and a variety of sea life for diving, snorkeling and fishing offshore of Pensacola, Destin, Panama City and Port St. Joe, Florida. Otherwise presentation will typically rely on publication (book or journal articles, web-sites and electronic media such as CD-ROM). Television programs, web videos and social media can also bring an understanding of underwater archaeology to a broad audience. The Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project integrated a one-hour HD documentary, short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach. Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach. For one week in 2000 and 2001, live underwater video of the Queen Anne's Revenge Shipwreck Project was webcast to the Internet as a part of the QAR DiveLivehttp://digital.ncdcr.gov/cdm/ref/collection/p249901coll22/id/695248 educational program that reached thousands of children around the world. Created and co-produced by Nautilus Productions and Marine Grafics, this project enabled students to talk to scientists and learn about methods and technologies used by the underwater archaeology team.  Examples of famous shipwrecks  = RMS Titanic (1912) = Bow of Titanic discovered within recent years. The infamous shipwreck of the Titanic occurred on April 15, 1912. This ship was a top of the class cruise ship in its time, that held more than 2,000 passengers. Upon impact of an iceberg, the ship could not survive and sank more than 2 miles below the surface. Deep in the Atlantic, the bow of ship sank deep into the clay at the bottom of the ocean, scattering artefacts from dishes, machinery, tiles, and even the remains of passengers throughout miles of seabed. However, processes of the sea began to work against the titanic's existence. \\"Marine organisms and acidic clay consumed wood and other organic material, including human remains. Bacteria colonized and began to eat away at the steel, leaving behind tendrils and puddles of red, orange, and yellow byproducts.\\" Seventy three years after its sinking, it was discovered in 1985. Since then, in 2010 robotic vehicles allowed for realistic footage and archeologists to walk the decks of the forgotten ship. = SS Georgiana (1863) = SS Georgiana was an American steamboat, cargo ship of the Confederate States back in the mid 1800's. It was considered one most powerful confederate cruisers. However, on its maiden voyage it was scuttled and burned. In 1965, it was discovered by E. Lee Spence in Charleston, SC. \\"Today the Georgiana sits on the bottom with her huge boiler only five feet (1.5 m) under the surface. She is now covered with a wide array of sea fan, sea whips, and living corals. Large sections of the hull are still intact. In places the starboard side of the hull protrudes over nine feet (3 m) from the sand.\\"\\"Underwater Archaeology on the Georgiana,\\" by E. Lee Spence, presented before the International Conference on Underwater Archaeology, 1974 A sketched image of realistic Queen Anne's Revenge Ship = Queen Anne's Revenge - Blackbeard's flagship = This vessel was believed to be Blackbeard's flagship after artifacts have proven its origin. This ship was originally named \\"La Concorde\\" and served as a French slave ship. As the ship managed through the Middle Passage, many French and Africans had perished or were severely ill. Blackbeard and his crew came across the French Ship, and were able to obtain it and the La Concorde's crew and passengers could not fight. In 1996, a team of researchers found artifacts near historic Beaufort Inlet that confirmed the ship's origin. \\"Several diagnostic artifacts were recovered from the site, designated North Carolina shipwreck site 31CR314, including a bronze bell dated 1705, a sounding weight, an English blunderbuss barrel, a lead cannon apron and two cannonballs.\\" These 18th century artifacts, cannons, and large anchors also confirmed the ship's identity.

The proceeds went to a nonprofit foundation, the Dogwood Health Trust, which plans to distribute annual grants focused on healthcare. Mission Health in Asheville Mission Health, which traces its roots in the region back to 1885, operates six hospitals, numerous outpatient and surgery centers, home health provider CarePartners, and the region‚Äôs only dedicated Level II trauma center. Its medical staff consists of more than 1,000 physicians and is certified in more than 50 medical specialties and sub-specialties. Mission Health has seven Centers of Excellence: Cancer, Heart, Neurosciences, Orthopedics, Trauma, Women‚Äôs Health and Mission Children‚Äôs Hospital, the region‚Äôs only children‚Äôs hospital. Mission Hospital, located in Asheville, is the system‚Äôs flagship hospital and is licensed for 795 beds. It is the regional referral center for tertiary and quaternary care. Other Mission Health member hospitals include Angel Medical Center in Franklin, Blue Ridge Regional Hospital in Spruce Pine, Highlands-Cashiers Hospital in Highlands, McDowell Hospital in Marion and Transylvania Regional Hospital in Brevard.  History  Mission Hospital traces its roots to 1885, when a group of women calling themselves \\"The Little Flower Mission\\" saw a need for a hospital in Asheville that would care for those in need, regardless of their ability to pay. They raised funds by selling flowers on the streets of the city, started their hospital in a rented five-room house on what is now Biltmore Avenue near Hilliard Avenue, and expanded and relocated four times in the next seven years. By 1940, there were five small general hospitals in the city, but medical professionals had begun to see the need for a major medical center for western North Carolina. In 1947, Mission Hospital merged with Clarence Barker Memorial Hospital (at that time known as Biltmore Hospital), which was established by the All Soul's Parish in 1896 and constructed on land donated by George Vanderbilt and became Memorial Mission Hospital. Over time, Memorial Mission Hospital absorbed Victoria Hospital (formerly called Norburn Hospital, founded in 1928) and the Asheville Colored Hospital (founded in 1943). Memorial Mission Medical Center and St. Joseph's Hospital established an organizational partnership in 1996 and formally merged in 1998 as Mission-St. Joseph‚Äôs Health System. = St. Joseph's Hospital = St. Joseph's Hospital, circa 1920 St. Joseph's Hospital was established by the Sisters of Mercy in 1900 as a sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis. It functioned out of a house on French Broad Avenue and was moved to Starnes Street before the sisters purchased what became its permanent location in 1909, at that time a large house belonging to William Wallace McDowell, a Confederate major who established a militia from Western North Carolina during the Civil War. The hospital expanded its services and facilities over the years and was declared a general hospital in 1939. After numerous expansions, a more modern facility was built in 1974. = Memorial Mission Hospital = Memorial Mission Hospital, Circa 1950 After the consolidation of the smaller hospitals and the merger of Mission and Memorial Hospitals, Memorial Mission Hospital began operations with the hospitals on Reed Street and Woodfin Street in Asheville North Carolina. In 1951, the Biltmore Hospital facility was closed and construction began on a new hospital on Biltmore Avenue, across the street from St. Joseph's and was dedicated in March 1954. As technology advanced and medical procedures were becoming very complicated and expensive, Memorial Mission began looking towards St. Joseph's in the hopes of combining operations. = Becoming Mission Heath = Following Memorial Mission's purchase of St. Joseph's from the Sisters of Mercy in 1998, Memorial Mission acquired McDowell Hospital in Marion and Blue Ridge Community Hospital in Spruce Pine. Mission Health was the state's sixth-largest health system and the western North Carolina‚Äôs only not-for-profit, independent community hospital system governed and managed exclusively in western North Carolina. =Purchase by HCA= The $1.5 billion sale of Mission Health to the for-profit HCA Healthcare, announced in March 2018, was completed February 1, 2019.  Current Operations  Today, Mission Hospital is a general medical and surgical facility and teaching hospital that serves the people of Asheville, Buncombe County, and much of Western North Carolina from three locations: Mission Hospital, Mission Hospital-St. Joseph's campus and Mission Children's Hospital with more than 50 specialties. In 2020, U.S. News and World Report ranked it seventh in North Carolina and gave it a high-performing ranking in nine adult procedures and conditions. In 2020, Mission Hospital serves 18 counties of western North Carolina with six hospitals, one post- acute care rehab hospital, 124 physician practices and five walk-in urgent care locations.

The planted area was 831.75 km¬≤, of which 776 were harvested. The tobacco industry is dominated by two transnational companies: Massalin Particulares S.A. (a subsidiary of Philip Morris International, which sells the Marlboro brand, and which in turn is associated with Tabacos Norte S.A.) and Nobleza Piccardo (a subsidiary of British American Tobacco, which sells international brands such as Lucky Strike, Viceroy and Camel, as well as national ones like Jockey and Derby). Tobacco producers are concentrated in the north of the country. The provinces of Jujuy and Salta (in the north-west), and Misiones (in the north- eastern Mesopotamia), are the leading ones, with over 45,000 tonnes/year each. The other tobacco-producing provinces are Tucum√°n, Corrientes, Chaco and Catamarca. Tobacco plays an important role in the economy of the producing areas, which are comparatively poor provinces. The Argentine tobacco industry employs 500,000 people, about half of them directly involved in the planting and harvesting, only about 2% in the manufacturing of the derived products, and the rest in distribution and sales. Therefore, despite the fact that the consequences of smoking are a major health issue in Argentina, the national government supports the producers by means of a Tobacco Special Fund (Fondo Especial del Tabaco, FET), which consists in a subsidy plus easier access to credit in order to modernize the industry.  Labor Practices  An important number of Argentina's tobacco industry employees are mostly underage workers. The TVPRA List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced LaborList of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor published in December 2014 by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs underlines the existence of such practices in Argentina.

During the 20th century, most attacks were carried out by various Irish Republican Army (IRA) groups and were linked to the Northern Ireland conflict (the Troubles). In the late 20th century there were also isolated attacks by Middle Eastern terrorist groups, though it was still the fact that the vast majority of the attacks were the work of the IRA and allied groups. During the 21st century, however, most terrorist incidents in Britain have been linked to Islamic fundamentalism. An interpretation of this change is that terrorist incidents in Britain may be growing due to Britain's participation in the Iraq War and its role in the Syrian Civil War, as part of a coalition with other Western countries. Polling shows most Britons agree with the theory that their country's actions in Muslim lands provoke blowback in the form of terror attacks. Since 1970, there have been at least 3,395 terrorist-related deaths in the UK, the highest in western Europe.\\"How many people are killed by terrorist attacks in the UK?\\".

However, during the police advocacy of 90-day detention in relation to the Terrorism Act 2006 they produced documents listing all the cases about which they could not go into details. Authorities often state, without going into details, numbers of attacks prevented, e.g. 12 attacks were reported in March 2017 to have been thwarted in the previous year, some only hours before they were to have been attempted. Arrests, detentions, and other incidents related to the Terrorism Acts These are cases where either the Terrorism Acts were invoked, or which the authorities alleged were terrorist in nature at the time. This list includes both plots that were foiled at an early stage before any materials were actually assembled, and totally innocent suspects. *1997, 11 April: Eight members of the Provisional IRA - including an Irish-American that served in the US Marine - were on trial after a July 1996 plot to blow up six electrical stations knocking out electricity in the London and South East England region, foiled by police and MI5. * 2003, 5 January: Wood Green ricin plot, where police arrested six Algerian men accused of manufacturing ricin to use for a poison attack on the London underground. No poison was found, and all men were acquitted of all terror charges, except for Kamel Bourgass who stabbed four police officers during his arrest in Manchester several days later. He was convicted of the murder of the officer he killed (the others he stabbed survived). He was also convicted of plotting to poison members of the public with ricin and other poisons. Two of the suspects in the plot were subsequently convicted of possessing false passports.T cabin gate * 2003, October: Andrew Rowe arrested in Dover after being detained as he entered the Channel Tunnel in France.

A STAR is an air traffic control (ATC)-coded IFR arrival route established for application to arriving IFR aircraft destined for certain airports. Area navigation (RNAV) STAR/FMSP procedures for arrivals serve the same purpose but are used only by aircraft equipped with flight management systems (FMS) or GPS. The purpose of both is to simplify clearance delivery procedures and facilitate transition between en route and instrument approach procedures. (183 MB) Description A STAR is a flight route defined and published by the air navigation service provider that usually covers the phase of a flight that lies between the last point of the route filed in the flight plan and the first point of the approach to the airport, normally the initial approach fix (IAF). Hence, a STAR connects the en-route phase with the approach phase of the flight. A typical STAR consists of a set of starting points, called transitions, and a description of routes (typically via VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) radio beacons and airway intersections) from each of these transitions to a point near the destination airport, from where the aircraft can undertake an instrument approach (IAP) or be vectored for a final approach by terminal air traffic control. Not all airports have published STARs, but most relatively large or hard to reach (e.g., in a mountainous area) airports do. Sometimes several airports in a locality share a single STAR; in such circumstances, aircraft follow the same arrival route until the final waypoint, diverging thereafter for their chosen destination. Although the route segment of the filed flight plan does not usually change during the flight itself, the STAR to be flown might well vary according to the weather, the runway or approach in use, or the need to safely separate air traffic, among other factors. Thus a filed flight plan typically ends some distance from touchdown, where a STAR begins, and that is usually assigned and communicated to the pilot during the flight planned portion of the flight. Naming conventions for STARs vary by country and region. In Europe, they are often named after the transition waypoint, followed by a digit that is incremented with each revision of the procedure, and a letter designating the runway for which the STAR is intended. In the United States, STARs are named after waypoints, or unique features of the STAR, or geographical features, followed by a digit indicating the STAR revision. A single STAR in the United States may serve multiple runways and transitions; European STARs are more likely to be independently published for each runway and/or transition. Not all STARs are for IFR flights. Occasionally, STARs are published for visual approaches, in which case they refer to landmarks visible on the ground or other visual reference points, instead of waypoints or radio navigation aids. STARs can be very detailed (as is often the case in Europe), allowing pilots to go from descent to approach entirely on their own once ATC has cleared them for the arrival, or they can be more general (as is often the case in the United States), providing guidance to the pilot, which is then supplemented by instructions from ATC. Typically, European STARs are very runway-specific and allow approaches to be made without the controller needing to issue radar vectors frequently until short final. STARs published and used for United States air traffic tend not to have many deviations in waypoints per-runway, though they do have some.

It was unusual in that it struck at the end rather than the beginning of the recession. The panic created a credit shortage that led to a significant economic decline in the United States, turning a recession into a depression.  Background  The gold reserves of Europe were depleted and as demand for it rose, more than $150 million in gold was exported from the United States between 1882 and 1884. Beginning in 1882, the U.S. economy contracted with major available indexes such as railway revenue, coal production, imports, and domestic cotton production declining by more than 25 percent. The New York City national banks, with tacit approval of the United States Treasury Department, halted investments in the rest of the United States and called in outstanding loans. A larger crisis was averted when New York Clearing House bailed out banks in risk of failure. Nevertheless, the investment firms Grant & Ward, Marine Bank of New York, and Penn Bank of Pittsburgh failed along with more than 10,000 small firms. This was an economic crash that occurred during the Depression of 1882‚Äì1885. It was one of the eight panics that happened in 1863‚Äì1913, in the money center of Manhattan. It occurred around the time of the Gilded Age, which was a time around the end of the Civil War, and the beginning of the 1900s. It was an era when economic progress masked social problems and the siren of financial speculation caused financial foolishness in sensible people. Panics like this tended to happen in fall, during the time of greatest strain for the banking systems. Farmers needed money for crops, and the holiday season also brought demands for increase of currency and credit. Since the National Banking System couldn't supply the currency for the increase of the demand, they rose the price of currency, instead. They increased interest rates and lowered the value of banks‚Äô assets, which gave them trouble repaying deposits. It pushed them to insolvency. Because of this dynamic, it triggered more runs in chain reactions, that threatened the entire financial system. An estimation was made that 5% of all American mines and factories had been completely shut down due to this crash. This panic was confined in nearby states and cities around New York. During that time, the uncertainty about banks‚Äô stability and fear that other depositors would be the first to withdraw, triggered panics. Causes The immediate cause of the Panic of 1884 was the failure of Grant and Ward and Marine National Bank of New York City. These two firms were joined closely together as James D. Fish was a partner in both. When these two major firms collapsed, it had a ripple effect across Wall Street, causing many firms to fail. Another major cause was the aftereffects of the Panic of 1873, which involved practices such as speculative bonds and overextension of credit to fund the construction of infrastructure. In addition, this failure undermined the confidence people had in Wall Street as it rebuilt after the events of 1873, especially after it became known that John Chester Eno had embezzled over $3 million and fled to Canada. Even though the bank replenished the missing amount and avoided failure, the news was still a huge blow to any remaining good will and confidence Wall Street had and furthered the panic. Overall, the panic was mostly contained to New York but acted as a foreshadow to the Great Depression. In May 1884 the two firms, the Marine National and the brokerage firm Grant and Ward, crashed when their owners‚Äô speculative investments lost value. Shortly after the first incident, the Second National Bank suffered when it was discovered that John Chester Eno embezzled 3 million dollars and ran away to Canada. Large numbers of depositors simultaneously ran to the bank to withdraw their deposits. This wave of panic forced the bank to sell more assets, further depressing asset prices, further weakening banks‚Äô balance sheets, and further increasing the unease for the public about banks. The Metropolitan National Bank also closed after a rumor spread that the president was going to borrow money, from the bank, to use on railroad securities. Though later, this claim was proven untrue. The latter institution had financial ties to the banks around them, which raised doubts to the banks it was linked with, after its closure. This started to spread through Metropolitan's network to institutions located in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But, it was quickly contained. Result The New York Clearing House thoroughly examined the Metropolitan and realized it was a solvent. They understood that they were able to pay off their debts. They advertised this new find and loaned Metropolitan three million dollars so it could withstand the run and not crash. These successful actions were able to reassure the public that their money was safe, and the panic came to an end. This panic severely disrupted industry and commerce, even after it concluded. Other accounts also blamed the New York Clearinghouse's decision to stop publishing bank-specific information along with other actions since it is viewed to have alleviated the need for a suspension of convertibility. It is argued that this is evidenced in the way the panic was largely confined to New York.

It was produced by Gene Corman, Roger Corman's brother. Filmed in South Dakota at the same time as Ski Troop Attack, it tells the story of bank robbers fleeing in the snow who run afoul of a giant spider-like monster that feeds on humans. The film was released as a double feature with The Wasp Woman (1959). The movie began an association between Roger Corman and Monte Hellman that lasted for fifteen years. Hellman would work on several of Corman's films and he would finance several movies that Hellman would direct. Plot A group of criminals, led by the ruthless Alexander Ward, hatch a plan to steal gold bars from a bank vault in Deadwood, South Dakota. Ward sends one of his henchmen, Marty Jones, to set an explosion in a nearby gold mine; the detonation will act as a diversion for their heist. Although Marty, accompanied by local barmaid Natalie, succeeds in setting off the explosion, he encounters a beast in the mine. The beast kills Natalie, but Marty escapes with his life. The next morning, the explosive goes off as planned, and Marty and his gang succeed in stealing gold bars from the vault. Led by a local guide named Gil Jackson, they set off to a remote cabin, where they hope to be picked up by a plane. Gil is initially unaware of their plans, but he becomes suspicious when he hears reports of the robbery on the radio and discovers that they're carrying handguns. They reach the cabin without incident but, once there, a violent snowstorm delays the plane's arrival. Marty's \\"secretary\\" Gypsy is taken with the young Gil and tells him that Marty plans to kill him once the plane arrives. Gil and Gypsy take off back to town together. Marty, who still carries unpleasant memories of his encounter with the beast, has all the while been concerned about being followed. He encounters the beast again during the trip to the cabin, but his companions think he's losing his mind. Eventually, however, they become convinced of the beast's reality when they see it attack Marty's other henchman, Byron. Despite their fear of further attacks, the gang is set on tracking down Gil and Gypsy before they reach town, so they head to a nearby cave. Another snowstorm forces Gil and Gypsy to take shelter in the cave as well, which turns out to be the lair of the beast. In the final struggle, the beast kills the remaining gang members, but Marty shoots it with a flare gun before he dies. Gil and Gypsy are left to watch as the monster burns to death. Cast Production =Development= In the mid-1950s, film producer and director Roger Corman, along with his brother and fellow producer Gene Corman, hired then theatre director Hellman to direct a film from a screenplay by Roger Corman regular Griffith. According to Griffith, Corman was motived by the success of Naked Paradise. He said \\"Roger said \\"I want NAKED PARADISE using a gold mine instead of a pineapple plantation. Put it in South Dakota and add a monster.\\" I didn't know how to add a monster to that script, so I had it all wrapped up in a cocoon in a cave just threatening to break loose all the time. I don't know how it happened That became BEAST FROM HAUNTED CAVE. \\" Monte Hellman said \\"what interested me about it was that it really wasn't a monster movie. Roger liked Key Largo very much. I think that was one of his favorite movies. He kept making Key Largo just different versions of it. In this case he added a monster to it.\\"Albright p 89 Both of the Cormans had grown tired of filming in Bronson Canyon and the Los Angeles Arboretum, and wanted to film in new locations in future films.Weaver p 99 This would also enable them to hire crews out of Chicago at a cheaper rate than in Los Angeles. After getting information from the Chamber of Commerce in South Dakota, they decided to film in South Dakota's Black Hills The Black Hills themselves turned out to be too difficult to film. Gene Corman considered a mind in Lead, South Dakota, then found a disused mine in Deadwood. To amortize costs, Roger Corman produced another film, Ski Troop Attack at the same time on the same location, utilising the same screenwriter and lead actors. The two films took five weeks in all the shoot, with one day off between films, and Beast was shot first. The unit was based at the Ben Franklin Hotel. =Casting= The film's cast was mostly composed of Corman regulars Wolff, Campo, Forest, Sinatra (cousin to famous actor and singer Frank Sinatra) and Noonan. Ahlstrand, Playboy's Playmate of the Month for July 1958, also played a minor role in the film as Nathalie the barmaid. Michael Forest says he was paid $500 a week and recalls \\"what was taking place was tough on us physically.\\" =Shooting= Shooting took 13 days. Gene Corman said \\"this was the first time I had tried to shoot in snow and it was very difficult. But the picture had a whole new look.\\" Hellman says \\"it wasn‚Äôt fun to make at all. It was my first film and we had 13 days to shoot, and by noon of the first day we hadn‚Äôt gotten a shot because the equipment was all frozen ‚Äì it was 10 degrees below zero and we couldn‚Äôt get anything to run... Roger Corman, who was the executive producer, was screaming on the phone that if we didn‚Äôt get our first day's quota he was gonna be on a plane the next day and take over the picture. We managed to get it [working]; the sound was a little bit off-speed but we were able to correct it.\\" Scenes in the cave were filmed in an abandoned mine in Deadwood, where the crew was allowed to film. While shooting scenes in the cave that required the actors to use guns, the sounds reverberating from the fired ammunition would sometimes cause parts of the cave's ceiling to break off, which made some of the cast and crew members nervous while working on location. Other problems arose while filming in the mine, as the air became very stale to the point where the crew had to pump air into the cave; the problem was never completely solved due to improper equipment. The monster in the film was designed and portrayed by actor Robinson, who would later star in General Hospital. According to Robinson, the design of the beast, which he nicknamed \\"Humphrass\\", was based on a wingless hangingfly. In order to create the creature's skeletal form, Robinson added aluminum stripping to a plywood base, then covered the frame with chicken wire before wrapping it in sheets and muslin. He then soaked the frame in vinyl paint in order to waterproof the design, since it had to be used in the snow. The creature's head was fashioned out of quarter-inch aluminum wire, which was then encased in steel wire and wrapped in muslin. The creature's fangs and teeth were also constructed with aluminum wire. Robinson then placed putty and patches of crepe hair onto the design before adding spun glass in order to give it a cobwebby appearance. \\"They literally spent two dollars at the dime store\\", said Hellman. \\"It was mostly angel hair and paper machie monster.\\"Albright p 90 Forrest said, \\"I kept lookin‚Äô at it and thinking, \\"This doesn‚Äôt scare me at all!\\" [Laughs] But it was supposed to, I guess‚Äô Chris was doing the best he could under the circumstances, trying to make this thing walk when he could hardly move in it.\\" Roger Corman recalls the shoot \\"as a very tough challenge. It was unbelievably cold and snowed all the time. Hellman says he was paid to write, edit and direct, but he was unable to edit since he was not in the union, which was IA out of Chicago. He added, \\"Fools plunge in .. . I just did it, and I probably made more mistakes than the average person who makes a first film. I didn‚Äôt really have any help and I wouldn‚Äôt take any help. I had to do it on my own. Once I made my first film I considered myself a film-maker. I lost all interest in the theatre and never went back.\\" =Proposed Sequel= A sequel for the film was planned, which would have resolved the fate of the surviving characters, but it was soon canceled, resulting in the film's open ending.Weaver p 1000 Release The film was released through Filmgroup on a double bill with The Wasp Woman. =Box office= Hellman claimed to have received 2% of the profits ‚Äì which he said came to $400 over the next five years. =Critical= In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin noted that despite being \\"substantially dissimilar to most monster pieces\\", the film had \\"few positive virtues\\". The review also commented on \\"uneven acting and direction\\". Time Out gave the film a negative review, calling it \\"routine\\" with \\"nothing to distinguish it from any other grade Z horror pic of the '50s\\". Alan Jones of The Radio Times rated the film two out of five stars, noting what he called the film's \\"flair and imagination by director Monte Hellman\\", while also stating that it was \\"a painless, cost-conscious effort typical of producer Roger Corman\\". Leonard Maltin awarded the film a mixed 2 out of 4 stars, calling it a remake of Naked Paradise with a monster added in. TV Version Three years later, Roger Corman asked Hellman to four pictures for TV; they had been a little over 60 minutes and he needed them to be 80 minutes for a sale to Allied Artists‚Äô TV. He shot extra scenes for Beast from Haunted Cave, Creature from the Haunted Sea, Last Woman on Earth and Ski Troop Attack. \\"I had fun, I was autonomous, and Corman didn‚Äôt care what I shot\\", Hellman says. \\"The stock was different; I used whatever actors were still available.\\" Home media On March 20, 2001, Beast from Haunted Cave was released for the first time on DVD by Madacy as a part of its \\"Killer Creatures\\" double-feature pack alongside The Brain That Wouldn't Die. Madacy would later re-release the film in 2004 as a part of another multi-feature pack. In 2002, a \\"Special Extended Version\\" of the film was released by Synapse Video on March 26, followed by an additional release from Alpha Video on October 22. Alpha Video would re-release the film twice in 2003 as a part of multi-feature film packs. The film was re-released on four separate occasions by Platinum Disc in 2005 for various multi-feature film packs, with its final release on September 13 distributed by Genius Entertainment.

He was the Controller of BBC Radio 1 in the United Kingdom, and held that role from 1998‚Äì2011, taking over from Matthew Bannister. He was also the controller of BBC Radio 1Xtra, BBC Asian Network, BBC Popular Music and BBC Switch. He was recently appointed Chair of the UK charity Youth Music. Early life He went to Ashton Park Comprehensive School in Bower Ashton, Bristol. He then went to the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School (now an associate college of UWE). From 1978‚Äì79, he was the assistant stage manager at the Bristol Arts Centre. He later attended the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Early career Parfitt joined the BBC in 1980 working as a Studio Manager. He spent some time with BFBS in the Falkland Islands, before returning to the UK in 1984. He became a producer in BBC Education in 1985, then joined Radio 4 in 1987 and produced Pick of the Week and Bookshelf. He helped set up Radio 5, and became the network's Assistant Editor in 1989. He joined Radio 1 as Chief Assistant to the Controller in 1993. A year later he was promoted first to Editor, Commissioning and Planning and soon after to Managing Editor. In 1997, he became the network's Deputy Controller when Matthew Bannister was appointed Director of BBC Radio. BBC Management In March 1998, Parfitt was appointed Controller of Radio 1. During his time as Controller he has refocused the station on a core target audience of 16- to 24-year-old listeners. In 2002, he oversaw the launch of BBC Radio 1Xtra, a digital radio service for fans of new black music. Subsequently, Parfitt was instrumental in changes to the Radio 1 daytime output including the appointment of Chris Moyles as the Radio 1 Breakfast Show host in January 2004, as well as the 2006 reshuffle which saw Colin Murray move to 10pm. This saw a sustained improvement in RAJAR ratings with the station reaching the ten million mark in listenership. Although much of this was down to Moyles (who often referred to Parfitt as 'Parf Daddy'), many other shows particularly Scott Mills saw increases. In July 2006 Parfitt was appointed the BBC's Teen Tzar. This made him head of all teenage entertainment - with a view of making sure the BBC offers a wider choice to the 11‚Äì25 age group. In July 2007 Parfitt presented a two part series for BBC Radio 4 entitled California Dreaming. In December 2007 Bob Shennan, the Controller of Five Live moved to Channel 4 to manage its new three radio stations, leaving Parfitt temporarily in charge of Five Live and Five Live Extra and the Asian Network. In December 2008 it was announced that Parfitt's role within the BBC was to be expanded and he was taking on the role of Controller of BBC Popular Music in addition to his existing portfolio that includes Radio 1, 1Xtra, Asian Network and BBC Switch. As part of his responsibilities, the Radio 1 controller would also oversee the pan-BBC music event The Electric Proms. Parfitt had been caretaking the role since Lesley Douglas resigned from the post. In March 2009, he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro along with Radio 1 presenters Chris Moyles, Fearne Cotton and seven other celebrities for Comic Relief 2009. On 21 July 2011 it was announced Parfitt would leave Radio 1 at the end of July, after 13 years at the station. He was succeeded as Acting Controller by Ben Cooper.http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/14230748 He is a Fellow of The Radio Academy.The Radio Academy \\"Fellows\\" Censorship In December 2007, Parfitt was criticised for only authorising a cut version of The Pogues \\"Fairytale of New York\\", censoring the words 'slut' and 'faggot'. This decision was later reversed after widespread media coverage, and a decision by sister station Radio 2 to play the track uncensored.Radio 1 backs down in Pogues row ‚Äì BBC News Personal life He married Laura Druce in 1996 in Bath and North East Somerset.

Etymology The specific name or epithet, copei, is in honor of renowned taxonomist Edward Drinker Cope.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Cemophora coccinea copei, p. 58). Description The northern scarlet snake grows to 36‚Äì51 cm (14-20 inches) in total length (including tail). It is typically a gray or white base color, with 17-24 red blotches bordered by black that go down the back. The black borders on the blotches often join on the lower sides of the snake forming a line down the length of the body. The dorsal scales are smooth. The northern scarlet snake can sometimes be mistaken for the scarlet kingsnake (Lampropeltis triangulum elapsoides) or the eastern milk snake (Lampropeltis triangulum triangulum) in the areas where the geographic ranges of the species overlap. Behavior The northern scarlet snake is a secretive, burrowing species, preferring habitats of soft soils, often in open forested areas or developed agricultural land. They spend most of their time hidden, emerging to feed on small rodents and lizards, but they have a particular taste for reptile eggs, swallowing them whole or puncturing them and consuming the contents. Reproduction Mating of the northern scarlet snake occurs in March through June, with 3-8 eggs laid in mid summer, and hatching in early fall. Each hatchling is 13‚Äì15 cm (5-6 inches) in total length (including tail). Geographic distribution The northern scarlet snake is found in the United States, in: eastern Texas, eastern Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, southern Indiana, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and barely into northern Florida, with disjunct populations New Jersey, and central Missouri. Conservation status The northern scarlet snake holds no particular conservation status throughout most of its range, but it is listed as endangered species in the states of Indiana and Florida. It is only found in a single county in each state as these are the northern and southern extents of its range.

The term refers generally to activities that either enhance learning opportunities within formal education systems or broaden learning opportunities beyond formal education systems. Open learning involves but is not limited to: classroom teaching methods, approaches to interactive learning, formats in work-related education and training, the cultures and ecologies of learning communities, and the development and use of open educational resources. While there is no agreed- upon, comprehensive definition of open learning, central focus is commonly placed on the \\"needs of the learner as perceived by the learner.\\" Case studies illustrate open learning as an innovation both within and across academic disciplines, professions, social sectors and national boundaries, and in business and industry, higher education institutions, collaborative initiatives between institutions, and schooling for young learners. Inception Open learning as a teaching method is founded on the work of C√©lestin Freinet in France and Maria Montessori in Italy, among others. Open learning is supposed to allow pupils self-determined, independent and interest-guided learning. A prominent example is the language experience approach to teaching initial literacy (cf. Br√ºgelmann/ Brinkmann 2011). More recent work on open learning has been conducted by the German pedagogues Hans Br√ºgelmann (1975; 1999), Falko Peschel (2002), J√∂rg Ramseger (1977) and Wulf Wallrabenstein (1991). The approach is supposed to face up to three challenges (cf. in more detail Br√ºgelmann/ Brinkmann 2008, chap. 1): * the vast differences in experiences, interests, and competencies between children of the same age; * the constructivist nature of learning demanding active problem-solving by the learner him- and herself; * the legal requirement of student participation in decisions stipulated by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC). of 1989. Current uses of the term The term \\"open learning\\" also refers to open and free sharing of educational materials.[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=408300 See also *Active learning *Alternative education *Augmented learning *Cooperative learning *Didactic method *Distance education *Experiential education *Example choice *Language Experience Approach *Learning by teaching (LdL) *Language exchange *Lifelong learning *MIT OpenCourseWare *MIT Open Learning *Open education *OpenLearning a social online learning platform for teachers to deliver courses. *Open Learning for Development an Open Training Platform sponsored by UNESCO offering free training resources on a wide range of development topics, fostering cooperation to provide free and open content for development. *Minimally invasive education, a term used in the deployment of Internet-connected computers in public places to encourage voluntary learning. *Self-regulated learning *Social learning (social pedagogy) References =Notes= Further reading * Br√ºgelmann, H.

Since June 2018, Jordan is a regional career education hub for students enrolled at other HISD high schools. When it was its own high school it had a program for high school-aged deaf pupils. The center was named after female politician Barbara Jordan. History Barbara Jordan High School was originally Houston Technical Institute up until 1979. Houston Technical Institute split its job oriented magnet program between two schools, Milby High School and Barbara Jordan High School For Careers (original name). The 1979/80 class was the last graduating class of Houston Technical Institute. The 1980/81 class was the first graduating class of Barbara Jordan High School For Careers. During the 1984-1985 school year, the percentages of Fs at 23 of 26 HISD high school campuses decreased in the spring semester because of the state-implemented No Pass No Play rule, which requires students in high school athletic programs to attain passing grades. At Jordan and Sterling High School, the percentages of Fs remained the same.Hunt, Dianna. \\"Fewer failing grades since start of no- pass rule.\\" Houston Chronicle. Saturday June 29, 1985.

While there was widespread support among competitors in the industry, the concept was not implemented. Instead, the Telecom Act of 1996 was implemented in a form that resulted in the reduction of telecommunications competition in the local loop. The original proposal was designed and named by Roy Morris, an adjunct professor at Capitol College, and with US ONE Communications, one of the early entrants in the local telephone business (and, incidentally, one of the first to exit that business). The fundamental economic principles were developed based on earlier research and publications of Jerry Duvall, a prominent economist at the Federal Communications Commission.

If untreated, milk-alkali syndrome may lead to kidney failure or death. It was most common in the early 20th century, but since the 1990s, there has been an increase in the number of cases reported, linked to the increased use of calcium supplements to address or prevent osteoporosis. Signs and symptoms The most common symptoms are poor appetite, dizziness, headache, confusion, psychosis, and dry mouth; laboratory tests may show that a person with milk-alkali syndrome has high blood calcium, kidney failure, and metabolic alkalosis. Causes Milk-alkali syndrome is caused by taking too much calcium (usually in the form of dietary supplements taken to prevent osteoporosis) and absorbable alkali (as are found in antacid drugs).U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, U.S. National Library of Medicine. Last updated Update Date: 7 November 2013 by:Brent Wisse. Medline Plus: Milk-alkali syndrome Mechanism The mechanism by which ingesting too much calcium and alkali leads to milk- alkali syndrome is unclear, since the human body tightly regulates levels of calcium. Impaired kidney function is a risk factor but even people with healthy kidneys can develop the syndrome. Diagnosis To diagnose milk- alkali syndrome, primary hyperparathyroidism has to be excluded. Usually the PTH is suppressed. Phosphorus levels are usually decreased while creatinine and bicarbonate levels are elevated. Treatment Treatment involves having the person stop taking any calcium supplements and any other alkali agents they have been taking, and hydration.Scofield RH et al. for eMedicine. Updated: 12 Aug, 2014 eMedicine: Milk-Alkali Syndrome In severe cases, hospitalization may be required, in which case saline may be administered intravenously. If kidney failure is advanced then treatment for that is required, namely chronic dialysis. Outcomes In mild cases, full recovery is expected. In severe cases, permanent kidney failure or death may result. Epidemiology Among people hospitalized with high blood calcium, milk- alkali syndrome is the third most common cause, after hyperparathyroidism and cancer. History The name \\"milk-alkali syndrome\\" derives from a reaction that arose to a treatment for gastric ulcers created in the early 1900s by Bertrand Sippy; Sippy prescribed his patients milk and alkali on the theory that ulcers were caused by excessive gastric acid. However within a few decades, an acute hypercalcemia syndrome with a relative good outcome was identified by Cuthbert Cope in 1936 (now called Cope syndrome), and in 1949 Charles H. Burnett identified a similar but more severe syndrome, with chronically high blood calcium levels and poor outcomes. When the true cause of most gastric ulcers was identified and drugs other than antacids were developed to treat heartburn ‚Äì namely acid-reducing drugs like H2-receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors ‚Äì the incidence of milk-alkali syndrome greatly diminished. However, as a result of increased osteoporosis awareness and the routine use of calcium supplements to prevent it, the incidence has again increased.

The Internet allows the company to market themselves and attract new customers to their website where they can provide product information and better customer service. Customers can place orders electronically, therefore reducing expensive long distant phone calls and postage costs of placing orders, while saving time on behalf of the customer and company. A company striving to obtain Global Reach should provide a code of ethics, a company purchasing policy, additional contact information, adequate product information and price. The website itself should be multi-lingual, easy-to- use, and have the ability to secure customer information.  Impact of globalisation  The prominence of global reach comes as a result of globalisation which has seen the indefinite increase in worldwide communication. The term ‚Äòglobal reach‚Äô which refers to this communication is suggestive of the fact that firms are increasingly looking to expand overseas by connecting with customers that they may otherwise have been unable to. The relentless innovation of technology is allowing companies to become ‚Äúmore global in their activities‚Ä¶as capital moves more freely across borders\\". Now, many companies have adapted their online forums such as websites to appeal to their growing global customer base. The internet has been key in growing advertising for firms. The online forum has often proven to be cheaper for establishments than billboard or television advertising as was common before the substantial increase in technology as a means of business expansion. According to statistics, global internet usage has increased from c.8 in 2001 to c40.4 inhabitants per 100 in 2014, suggesting that the market reachable by companies via the internet has grown.  A means of business growth  Global Reach acts as a medium through which firms can expand beyond the region of their setup. The concept has meant that smaller firms are able to use the internet to reach markets that would only have been available to the larger firms before. The modern ability and desire of companies to grow globally means that management teams are tasked with monitoring teams and employees who may be based abroad. Global Reach refers to the growing need for communication between these firm factions. While telephone calls are common, firms are increasingly turning to emails namely for time efficiency which allows business to grow as it becomes faster to carry out requests of customers and executives within the company. The time efficiency involved in online communication between the firm and customers and transactions allows for business to move faster and for companies to concentrate their energy in other sectors. With the economic environment constantly altering, businesses need to find ways to move forward alongside new technologies. However, failing to keep up with technological advances can cause firms to lose out to competitors which may use these technical benefits more efficiently.  Wider benefits  Whilst the above improvements have proven vital and beneficial to firms, consumers have also enjoyed the rewards of such expansion through cheaper pricing due to increased competition, access to a wider array of goods and better quality products due to the ability of firms to contact a bigger range of suppliers. Popular online sale sites which have become a staple of the internet due to Global Reach initiatives has also allowed the general public to access foreign markets, most commonly those of small home-run firms. The economic concept of the multiplier affect applies in some such cases as domestic markets can prosper directly through the opportunities provided by Global Reach. Firms have also embraced the internet to enabling the user to access their websites in several languages and in cases of online retail, allowing the customer to view the products with the price tag in the appropriate currency. Businesses can use the internet to come closer to their customers. Most firm websites provide contact information for its users allowing consumers unprecedented access into the firm, helping the business to establish a loyal consumer base. Other small businesses can also benefit from one firm‚Äôs decision to move forward technologically. The internet allows businesses to publish its information to be available on a public front, potentially aiding start-up firms to review potential aims and target market. Especially relevant in the face of emerging concerns for climate change, businesses are under pressure to look forward to more environmentally sustainable means of growth, for example the availability of email as a means of contact reduces the environmental strain on paper use.

Deflation of commodities' prices drove the stock market to new lows in a trend that began to reverse only after the 1896 election of William McKinley. The failure of the National Bank of Illinois in Chicago is remembered as one of the motivating factors in the sensational Adolph Luetgert murder case. During the panic, call money would reach 125 percent, the highest level since the Civil War.  Causes  The Panic of 1896 had roots in the Panic of 1893, and is seen as a continuation of that economic depression. The drop in American gold reserves worsened the effects of the Panic of 1893, and the Panic of 1896 was given its own distinction. The Coinage Act of 1873 demonetized the use of silver in America, and the Resumption Act of 1875 further established the gold standard. This period of deflation was met with some resistance, as the agrarian Populist Party formed to protest the adoption of the gold standard, and reinstate the bimetallic standard, due to farmers‚Äô inability to repay debts at lower prices, and silver miners loss of market share. Farmers also wanted to adopt the bimetallic standard because they could sell their crops at higher prices. The Sherman Silver Purchase of 1890 allowed limited use of silver in the American economy, but did not allow unlimited coinage as supporters of the \\"Free Silver\\" movement wanted. The Silver Purchase did not work as most of the backers had intended, as a large portion of the buyers redeemed their coins with gold, causing the already pressured American gold reserves to deplete. The American gold reserves dropped to just $60 million in January 1895, which, combined with the subsequent J. P. Morgan bond episode, in which Morgan, in cooperation with the European Rothschilds, sold gold directly to the U.S. treasury, causing the public‚Äôs worry for the gold standard to increase.  Election of 1896  = William Jennings Bryan = Democratic and Populist party candidate William Jennings Bryan ran on the platform of \\"free silver\\", in which he implored Americans to drop the gold standard and reinstate the coinage of silver in order to inflate the American economy. Bryan was an orator who gave many speeches on the issue, the most famous being his \\"Cross of Gold\\" speech of July 9, 1896. In this speech, Bryan laid out his belief that the existence of multiple forms of legal tender was necessary for the health of the national economy, as farmers would benefit from being able to sell their crops at a higher price. Bryan became both the Democratic and the Populist party nominee, due in part to his stances on the issues of the gold standard, which he believed could alleviate the Panic of 1896. Bryan was a dark-horse candidate prior to his Cross of Gold speech, but his intense rhetoric resonated among many Americans who felt that a second, less valuable, form of legal tender was necessary for less wealthy Americans, and he quickly became the front-runner of the Populist and Democratic parties. Republican campaign poster from 1896 attacking free silver. = William McKinley = Republican Party candidate William McKinley wished to remain on the gold standard, unlike his opponent, Bryan. Many bankers and businessmen were disturbed by Bryan's silver rhetoric, and McKinley was able to win the election. McKinley kept the United States on the gold standard by signing the Gold Standard Act in 1900, lessening the strength of both the bimetallism movement and public fears about the Gold Standard by his successful navigation out of the Panic of 1896, as the economy recovered by 1900. The Gold Standard Act formally adopted gold as the lone standard for redeeming paper money in the United States, effectively stopping bimetallism in its tracks.  Effects  The economic hard times caused debates over whether America should remain on the gold standard or use a bimetallic standard. The continued economic hardships after the Panic of 1893 and the 1895 Morgan Bonds episode into the Panic of 1896 increased American worry about the strength of the American economy. Many members of the Populist Party took the Jewish ancestry of the Rothschilds as a negative and a wave of antisemitism emerged within the party. During the Panic, the national unemployment rate increased from 13.7% in 1895 to 14.5% in 1896, which persisted until 1898. A series of high-profile banker suicides took place in December 1896 and January 1897 in Chicago in the wake of the failure of the National Bank of Illinois.

Distribution Leopard attacking an ostrich on a mosaic from Roman Syria Its range seems to have been continuous in prehistoric times, but with the drying- up of the Arabian Peninsula, it disappeared from the inhospitable areas of the Arabian Desert, such as the Rub' al Khali. In historic times, the bird seems to have occurred in two discrete relict populations: a smaller one in the southeast of the Arabian PeninsulaPaul Yule, Die Gr√§berfelder in Samad al-ShƒÅn (Sultanat Oman) Materialien zu einer Kulturgeschichte, Deutsches Arch√§ologisches Institut, Orient-Abteilung, Orient-Arch√§ologie vol. 4, Rahden 2001.

Towards the Sinai Peninsula, it probably intergraded with the North African subspecies camelus in earlier times. It looked exactly like that form; possibly, the females were of a slightly lighter coloration. The only certain way to distinguish camelus and syriacus was the smaller size of the latter, with only marginal overlap: the tarsus was 390‚Äì465 mm long in syriacus versus 450‚Äì530 mm in camelus. Relationship with humans The Arabian ostrich has long had a significant place in the culture of the region. An adult with 11 offspring is featured on the famous prehistoric \\"Graffiti Rock I\\" near Riyadh. In Mesopotamia, it was used as a sacrificial animal and featured in artwork, painted on cups and other objects made from ostrich eggs, traded as far as Etruria during the Neo-Assyrian period. In Tang China, an ostrich was a welcome exotic gift fit for an emperor: ostriches figure in the decoration of the Qianling Mausoleum, completed and closed in 706. The Jewish view of this bird was less favorable. The fact that the female ostrich may leave the nest unattended (because the eggs are too thick-shelled to be easily broken open by predators) is the reason why the bird is contrasted with the parental instinct of the stork in the Book of Job (.Parmelee, A. (1959)Although with a nod to the beauty of the bird's plumes: ◊õ÷∞÷º◊†÷∑◊£-◊®÷∞◊†÷∏◊†÷¥◊ô◊ù (chenaf r'naim), \\"the charming wing\\") This is also the reason why the Book of Lamentations () refers to the female ostrich as heartless.

In Roman times, there was a demand for ostriches to use in venatio games or cooking. These birds usually would have come from the North African subspecies rather than from the Arabian one, as the latter was only found in the unruly frontier regions of the Roman Empire, although it is to be noted that much later, the plumes of the Arabian ostrich were considered superior material for hatmaking compared to those of the North African subspecies. Depiction from Petra, Jordan After the rise of Islam, the Arabian ostrich came to represent wealth and elegance; ostrich hunting became a popular pastime for the rich and noble (if slaughtered properly, ostrich meat is halaal to Muslims) and eggs, feathers and leather were extensively used in handicraft. Arabian ostrich products, as well as live birds, were exported as far as China. A Tang Dynasty source states that the \\"camel bird\\" inhabiting Arabia is > \\"four chi and more in height, its feet resembling those of a camel; its neck > is very strong, and men are able to ride on its back...\\". The Arabian ostrich was also discussed in Mesopotamian scholarly writings from the time of the Baghdad Caliphate, such as Zakariya al-Qazwini's cosmography 'Aja'ib al-makhluqat wa-ghara'ib al-mawjudat, the Kitab al-Hayawan (\\"Book of Animals\\") of Al-Jahiz, or Ibn Manzur's dictionary Lisan al-Arab. The Arabian ostrich is mentioned by T.E. Lawrence in Seven Pillars of Wisdom, when one Arabian tribe brings eggs to Faisal I of Iraq as a peace offering. It is mentioned that the ostrich is plentiful in that tribe's territory. =Extinction= Palestine from 1877 The widespread introduction of firearms and, later, motor vehicles marked the start of the decline towards extinction of this subspecies. Earlier hunting methods with bow, arrows and dogs had allowed most animals of a group to escape, but rifles enabled poaching and excessive game hunting to diminish the species into extinction. By the early 20th century, the Arabian ostrich had become rare. Its main stronghold was the northern An Nafud northwards to the Syrian Desert, between latitudes 34¬∞N and 25¬∞N and longitude 38¬∞E eastwards to the Euphrates Valley, and it was most plentiful in Al Jawf Province, where it associated with herds of Saudi gazelle and Arabian oryx, animals that are now extinct or very rare respectively. Some of the last sightings include an individual east of the Tall al-Rasatin at the Jordanian-Iraqi border in 1928, a bird shot and eaten by pipeline workers in the area of Jubail in the early 1940s (some sources specifically state 1941), two apocryphal records of birds suffering the same fate in 1948, and a dying individual found in the upper Wadi el-Hasa north of Petra in 1966. Remains of old eggs are still found in the former range of the southern subpopulation, which disappeared between the 1900s and the 1920s, probably mainly because of increasing aridity.

Camp purchased Cummings share in 1869 and became sole owner.Gazetteer of Lamoille and Orleans Counties, VT.; 1883-1884, Compiled and Published by Hamilton Child; May 1887 A. A. Earle published the Orleans Independent Standard in Irasburg from 1856 to 1869. He moved the paper to Barton and sold it to the Newport Express to form the Express and Standard. There were various changes of editors and ownerships but by 1883, Camp again became sole owner and editor. The paper retained this name until 1936. In the 1980s, the circulation reached a high of 5,800. The paper was later acquired by Scripps League Newspapers, which was acquired by Pulitzer in 1996. Hollinger bought the paper from Pulitzer the next year and sold it in 1999 to current owner Horizon Publications. Operations Main competitors include The Chronicle, The Caledonian-Record, radio stations WIKE, WMOO, WJJZ (FM), and television station NEK-TV. The paper grosses about $1 million annually.

A degraded anadromous stream of glacial origin, it originates at Eklutna Glacier and flows through Eklutna Lake and a canyon up to 350 feet (107 m) deep, emptying into the Knik Arm of Cook Inlet approximately 17 miles (27 km) northeast of Anchorage. It has one significant tributary, Thunderbird Creek, which enters the south bank about 1 km (0.6 mi) upstream from where the river exits the canyon and forms an alluvial fan. Due to water impoundments on the Eklutna River for power generation, Thunderbird Creek is currently the main source of water in the river. The river is located entirely within the limits of the Municipality of Anchorage. Lower dam Anchorage was largely electrified by the late 1920s, but as demand increased, Eklutna was selected as a power source because of the hydroelectric potential of the river, then known as Eklutna Creek, and Eklutna Lake. In 1927, the City of Anchorage contracted with the Anchorage Light and Power Company to construct what is now called the Old Eklutna Hydroplant. Construction included a low-head storage dam at the outlet of Eklutna Lake and a high concrete arch diversion dam (known as the Lower Dam) in the river canyon downstream of the lake. The diversion dam diverted water through a 1/4 mile-long tunnel to a turbine house near the village of Eklutna. Since its construction, the Lower Eklutna Dam has been a barrier to fish movement upstream. When the Upper Dam was brought online, the Lower Dam was shut down as a result and the Lower Eklutna Dam was allowed to fill with gravel. This dam is no longer operational and for many years was completely backfilled with sediment to a depth of approximately at the upstream face of the dam. In 2018 the old dam was removed entirely as part of a restoration project.Tunseth, Matt, For 89 years, a dam blocked salmon on the Eklutna River. It‚Äôs finally gone. Anchorage Daily News, 28 August 2018 Upper dam Military expansion in Anchorage during the 1940s stressed the capacity of the Eklutna power generation system and it was upgraded several times. In 1948 the Bureau of Reclamation recommended the construction of Upper Eklutna Dam to raise the level of Eklutna Lake to an elevation of above sea level with a tunnel intake at . Construction was completed in 1955. The new system replaced the aging storage dam at the lake outlet with a new dam that diverted water through a long, diameter concrete lined tunnel with a capacity of per second (18 m¬≥/s) to a turbine house on the south bank of the Knik River. The dam, as modified, is an earth- and rock- filled structure, long and contains approximately of material. This new plant used essentially the entire storage capacity of Eklutna Lake and no water was made available to operate the existing plant at Eklutna. The 1964 Good Friday earthquake severely damaged the dam. Because of this, a new storage dam was built downstream from the existing storage dam at the lake outlet. The new Eklutna Dam (referred to as the Upper Dam) is an earth and rockfill structure long and high containing 85,000 yd¬≥ (65,000 m¬≥) of material. The spillway is a rectangular concrete conduit through the dam with an uncontrolled overflow crest. The maximum capacity of the spillway is 3,315 ft¬≥/s (94 m¬≥/s). There are no outlet works through the dam, as the power tunnel serves in that capacity. As the Upper Dam impounds 100% of the flow from Eklutna Lake, the river's volume immediately downstream is zero.

Artists such as John Prine, Neil Young and Merle Haggard have influenced his songwriting style. Henneman began his musical career in the mid-1980s with the bands The Blue Moons and Chicken Truck, and also spent time as guitar tech/additional musician with peers Uncle Tupelo from 1990 before forming the Bottle Rockets in late 1992. History =1980s= Sometime in late 1985, Henneman's band The Blue Moons played on a triple bill in Millstadt, Illinois, which also included Uncle Tupelo predecessor the Primitives. A few years later, Jeff Tweedy was instrumental in getting Henneman's next band, Chicken Truck - an original outlaw country rock band - an opening slot for Uncle Tupelo at Cicero's in St. Louis, Missouri. Chicken Truck released several cassettes in the 1980s, including \\"The 90 Minute Tape\\" and \\"Loud Music\\", the latter of which featured so many songs that Henneman's bands were still using material from it for their albums over a dozen years later. Some of the songs from that collection were written by or with Scott Taylor, a friend from Festus, Missouri who continues to collaborate with Henneman. Chicken Truck and Uncle Tupelo remained on good terms and a frequent double bill with one another until Chicken Truck disbanded in 1990. Chicken Truck had been composed of Henneman, Mark Ortmann, and brothers Bob and Tom Parr. =1990s= After Chicken Truck broke up, Henneman played occasional shows as a solo acoustic act, and sometime in late 1990 he began working as a roadie for Uncle Tupelo, occasionally playing extra guitar or mandolin with them. He became a staple during their encores, and played lead guitar on \\"Cortez the Killer,\\" \\"Moonshiner,\\" and many other covers. He also played extensively on the albumsStill Feel Gone and March 16‚Äì20, 1992, and also on some of the Uncle Tupelo tracks that ended up on various compilations (\\"Blue Eyes,\\" \\"Movin' On\\"). Brian Henneman, Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy, and Mike Heidorn formed a band called Coffee Creek, playing country covers in small clubs and bars between Uncle Tupelo tours. In late December 1991, Coffee Creek played at Cicero's for the first time. In March 1992 Uncle Tupelo, including Brian Henneman, went to Athens, Georgia, to record their third LP at John Keane's studio, this time with Peter Buck of R.E.M. producing. Henneman played guitar, mandolin, and bouzouki on March 16‚Äì20, 1992. In 1992 Henneman recorded the solo 45rpm single \\"Indianapolis,\\" an autobiographical song which he had written about Uncle Tupelo's van breaking down on tour. It was released on Rockville Records and backed with two more originals, \\"Get Down River\\" and \\"Wave That Flag\\", featuring vocal and instrumental back-up by Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy, and Mark Ortmann. Meanwhile, manager Tony Margherita shopped demos made by Henneman, which had been recorded with leftover studio time from the Still Feel Gone sessions. When those demos garnered a record deal with East Side Digital records, Henneman formed the Bottle Rockets with drummer Mark Ortmann (Chicken Truck, Blue Moons) in 1992. Throughout 1993-94, during Uncle Tupelo's slow dissolution, the bands remained closely interconnected. In addition to Farrar and Tweedy appearing on the Bottle Rockets' debut album, Henneman and the two bands also shared the same management and often performed together. When Uncle Tupelo finally disbanded in 1994, Henneman played lead guitar on Wilco's debut, A.M.. That same year, the Bottle Rockets released their critically acclaimed album The Brooklyn Side and toured with Wilco and Son Volt in 1995.[Kasten, Roy (April 29, 2008), Fifteen Things You Might Not Know about The Bottle Rockets, on Their Fifteenth Birthday, Riverfront Times.] \\"The late '90s exacted a heavy toll on the band,\\" Peter Blackstock wrote in No Depression issue No. 48, in a feature aptly titled, \\"Hell of a Spell: What Hasn't Killed The Bottle Rockets Has Made Them Stronger.\\" Besides having their career held hostage to a staggering series of record companies they had signed contracts with that folded and/or floundered, a UPS strike holding up distribution of one of their new records as well as band personnel changes, Henneman's parents both died within six weeks of each other. The band had been touring with Lucinda Williams and had to leave the tour prematurely.Blackstock, Peter (2003) \\"Hell of a Spell: What Hasn't Killed The Bottle Rockets Has Made Them Stronger \\" pp.82-95. No Depression No. 48 =2000s= Despite these difficulties, in 2005 the Bottle Rockets stabilized from the upheavals with their good nature and trailblazing edge intact. Henneman and Ortmann got the band back on course, along with new additions John Horton and Keith Voegele; they remain the current line-up of band members. The band also re-hired their manager from the early days, Bob Andrews. As noted in The New York Times by William Hogeland, the Bottle Rockets' songwriting has been likened to Woody Guthrie's folk style in spirit, smarts, and satire. Henneman's, Ortmann's, and contributor Scott Taylor's lyrics succinctly and endearingly encapsulate the common experiences of the everyman, and are set to stirring, rousing, searing rock 'n' roll. The Bottle Rockets' first live album Live in Heilbronn Germany was released in February 2006.http://www.bloodshotrecords.com/album/live-heilbronn-germany The double- disc set was recorded on July 17, 2005 at the Burgerhaus in Heilbronn- Bockingen, Germany (which also happened to be Henneman's birthday). It was released in Europe on CD and vinyl by Blue Rose Records. Bloodshot Records released the band's next album, Zoysia, recorded at Ardent Studios in Memphis, Tennessee with producer Jeff Powell, in June 2006. Zoysia received a spot on novelist/audiophile Stephen King's Best Records of 2006 list in Entertainment Weekly magazine. In 2006, Jeff Tweedy joined Henneman and the Bottle Rockets onstage in Chicago for reunion renditions of \\"Passenger Side\\" and \\"Casino Queen\\" (both from A.M.), and a cover of Neil Young's \\"Walk On\\". The band celebrated its 15th anniversary throughout 2008 with a series of 15 special shows and a contest to win the Creston Electric Instruments custom guitar Henneman played at each of the shows. The Bottle Rockets teamed up again with producer Eric Ambel (Brooklyn Side, 24 Hours A Day, Leftovers, Brand New Year) at his Cowboy Technical Services Recording Studio in Williamsburg, Brooklyn,http://www.cowboytechnical.com to record their new album Lean Forward. It was released by Bloodshot Records on August 11, 2009.

He currently works as an instructor or advisor for numerous organizations, including Tokai University, the International Judo Federation, and the All Japan Judo Federation. He retired from competitive judo on June 17, 1985 after a remarkable career where he won five gold medals in international competitions and marked 203 consecutive victories (with 7 draws in-between) until his retirement. He received the Japanese National Prize of Honor on October 9, 1984. Biography =Competitive career= Yamashita began judo in primary school after being inspired by judo founder Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç, and had already attained a black belt by the time he reached junior-high school. Yamashita continued judo under the guidance of 1964 Summer Olympics gold medalist Isao Inokuma and 1967 World Judo Championships gold medalist Nobuyuki Sato after graduating from Tokaidai Sagami High School. His streak of 203 victories began in October, 1977, in an exhibition match held in the Soviet Union, and ended with his final match in April, 1985, where he won the All-Japan judo championships for the 9th consecutive time. Yamashita qualified for the Olympics for the first time in 1976 as a replacement during his freshman year at T≈çkai University. At age 19, he became the youngest judoka in history to win the open category of the All-Japan Judo Championships in 1977. He continued his success by winning a gold medal at the 1979 World Judo Championships, and secured a spot on the Japanese Olympic team in a highly publicized draw against 1976 Summer Olympics bronze medalist Sumio Endo. Yamashita went into the final of the 1980 All Japan championships as the favorite, but Endo put Yamashita in a Kani Basami, breaking Yamashita's fibula. The match was declared a draw even though Yamashita was hurt and unable to continue. Kani Basami had been a legal move until the match, but the seriousness of Yamashita's injury caused officials to prohibit its use in international competitions. Japan boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympics in protest of the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Yamashita was forced to look on as a spectator while his rivals competed on the Olympic stage. Yamashita won three more gold medals at the World Championships before qualifying for the Olympics for the third time in 1984. He was the only Japanese judo competitor from the boycott who also qualified for the 1984 Summer Olympics. In his only appearance at the Olympics, Yamashita tore a right calf muscle in the preliminary match against Arthur Schnabel. This put Yamashita at a huge disadvantage since he executed his throws by pivoting on his right leg. Though he managed to win the match with an Okuri-Eri-Jime, the injury caused him to visibly limp during the semi-final match against Laurent Del Colombo. Yamashita was thrown with an Osoto Gari only 30 seconds into the match, but managed to return an Osoto Gari and won the match with a Yoko- Shiho-Gatame (side four-quarter hold). He played the final match against Mohamed Ali Rashwan of Egypt. Yamashita won the final and the gold medal despite his injury. The match witnessed a remarkable fair play act from Rashwan who did not aim for Yamashita's right leg. Rashwan was even given an award from the International Fairplay Committee. Yamashita remained undefeated in both domestic and international competitions, though he drew several matches with two-time Olympic gold medalist Hitoshi Saito. Yamashita faced Saito in the final match of the All-Japan Judo Championships for 3 consecutive years from 1983 to 1985, and emerged victorious in every single one of those matches. After suffering from numerous injuries throughout his career, Yamashita decided to retire from competitive judo on June 17, 1985 at only 28 years of age. President Putin and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in 2003. =Post retirement= Yamashita served as an instructor for numerous organizations before becoming the International Judo Federation's Director of Education in September, 2003. His presence as the head coach of the Japanese judo team was felt when he strongly protested the controversial decision in a match between David Douillet and Shinichi Shinohara at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Yamashita has also compiled an instructional judo video with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who also holds a black belt in judo. The two first met during Putin's visit to Tokyo in 2005, and Yamashita has traveled to St. Petersburg to visit the President's former judo school. He is the chairman of the Japanese Olympic Committee, and on 10 January 2020 he was elected a member of the International Olympic Committee. Judo style Yamashita had a stocky build of 5 ft. 11 in. (180 cm) and weighed over 280 lbs (127 kg) during his competitive years. He stood with a left-handed stance, and his best move was the Osotogari mixed in with the Ouchi Gari. He found Ouchi to be successful and used it very frequently. He also found the Uchimata to be highly effective against non-Japanese opponents, and used it frequently during his later years. He was also extremely effective on the ground, and many of his victories came with hold or choke moves. His proficiency from both the standing position and ground position allowed him to remain unbeaten for over 9 years.

It refers to the foothills of the Alps between the rivers Inn and Traun, with the Chiemsee at its center. The political districts that contain the Chiemgau are Rosenheim and Traunstein. Wendelstein is the name of a famous mountain close by but not strictly in the Chiemgau, while Kampenwand is actually the most inviting peak south of Chiemsee. Explanation of the name The name Chiemgau and Chiemsee together with the place name Chieming allegedly go back to the Old High German personal name Chiemo (7th/8th century). At the end of the 8th century the name Chiemgau appeared for the first time in documents as Chimigaoe but it stood at that time for a smaller area around the village of Chieming. History From the New Stone Age to the Bronze and Iron Ages humans have left their traces in the Chiemgau. After that this region was settled by the Celts and later by the Romans. The Romans settled mainly near the river Alz and made a crossing for their Roman road which goes from Salzburg to Augsburg at Seebruck (Bedaium). At that time the Chiemgau was on the outskirts of the Roman province of 'Noricum'. The Chiemgau was for a long time closely connected with the Bavarian dukes and also the princebishops of Salzburg. After the secularisation of 1803, the whole Chiemgau district became part of Bavaria. The Chiemgau is a source of wood, iron and salt. The production of salt, which existed from 1619 till 1912, had a big cultural and economical influence on the Chiemgau. The Chiemgau has traditionally been horse breeding country, especially workhorses. Nature and geography The ice-age, which took place 15000 years ago, formed the foothills of the Alps and the morainic landscape. For this reason the Chiemgau is a hilly countryside with numerous grasslands, forests and fens; additional there are plenty of lakes of which the biggest one is the Chiemsee. The biggest mountains are almost 2000m high.

He served in the United States House of Representatives on three separate occasions and was the 39th Governor of Georgia from 1847 to 1851. Early life and education The George W. Towns House in Talbotton, Georgia was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 7, 1973. Towns was born in Wilkes County, Georgia to Margaret George Hardwick and John Towns in 1801. His parents were Virginians who had moved to Georgia and settled in Wilkes County. Shortly after his birth, the Towns family moved throughout Georgia, where he received a small preparatory education. He then began to study medicine in Eatonton, but after his studies were interrupted by an injury, he moved to Montgomery, Alabama, which had recently joined the Union. There, he studied law and, in 1824 was admitted to the Montgomery bar. Early career As time went by, Towns continued to gain prominence and in 1826 acquired the Alabama Journal newspaper. During that same year he married his first wife, Margaret Jane Campbell, whose poor health led to her death several days after the marriage ceremony. Following the death of his wife, Towns moved back to Georgia and settled in Talbot County. In 1828, Towns became one of the original town commissioners of Talbotton, where he also established a law office. During this period Towns served as colonel in the 65th Regiment of the Georgia Militia. Political career Towns began his 22-year political career in 1829 as a strong Unionist and opponent of nullification in the Georgia House of Representatives and Georgia Senate. He was subsequently elected to the United States House of Representatives on three separate occasions. He served a partial term in the House from 1835 to 1836 and a full term from 1837 to 1839. He later served a third non- consecutive term from 1846 to 1847. He served as the 39th Governor of Georgia from 1847 to 1851. On September 23, 1850, Towns asked the General Assembly to allow a special election to send delegates to a state convention to pass judgment on the Compromise of 1850. Towns‚Äô wife, Mary Winston Jones Towns, was the daughter of John Winston Jones, who served as Speaker of the U.S. House from 1843 to 1845. Towns and Jones served concurrently in the House for a time. By the end of his time in politics, Towns had become a radical secessionist who believed the federal government was controlled by abolitionists bent on repressing the South. Death and Legacy Towns died in Macon, Georgia on July 15, 1854, and is interred at the Rose Hill Cemetery in that town. Towns County, Georgia is named in his honor.

The panic began when the market crashed during the afternoon of May 8. Investors did not see it coming, but by 1:00pm, the decline in the market was beginning to show. First came the gradual decline in Burlington stock. It had been high all morning, but suddenly a sharp weakness came about.

From 1985 to 2001 he worked at the World Bank as an economist and Senior Adviser at the Macroeconomics and Growth Division; he was also an adjunct professor at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. Easterly then worked at the Institute for International Economics and the Center for Global Development until 2003, when he began teaching at NYU.Curriculum Vita, William Easterly, April 3, 2013  Academic work  Easterly has worked in many areas of the developing world and some transition economies, most heavily in Africa, Latin America, and Russia. Easterly is skeptical toward many of the trends that are common in the field of foreign aid. In The Elusive Quest for Growth, he analyzes the reasons why foreign aid to many third world countries has failed to produce sustainable growth. He reviewed the many ‚Äúpanaceas‚Äù that have been tried since World War II but had little to show for their efforts. Among them is one that has recently come back into fashion: debt relief. That remedy has been tried many times before, he argues, with negative results more often than positive, and calls for a more scrutinizing process.Think Again: Debt Relief, Foreign Policy In The White Man's Burden (the title refers to Rudyard Kipling's famous poem of the same name), Easterly elaborates on his views about the meaning of foreign aid. Released in the wake of Live8, the book is critical of people like Bob Geldof and Bono (‚ÄúThe white band's burden‚ÄùWilliam Easterly on Al Jazeera English's Riz Khan show) and especially of fellow economist Jeffrey Sachs and his bestselling book The End of Poverty.A Modest Proposal, A Review of \\"The End of Poverty.\\" Easterly suspects that such messianic do-good missions are ultimately modern reincarnations of the infamous colonial conceit of yore. He distinguishes two types of foreign aid donors: ‚ÄúPlanners‚Äù, who believe in imposing top-down big plans on poor countries, and ‚ÄúSearchers‚Äù, who look for bottom-up solutions to specific needs. Planners are portrayed as utopian, while Searchers are more realistic as they focus‚Äîfollowing Karl Popper‚Äîon piecemeal interventions. Searchers, according to Easterly, have a much better chance to succeed. In The Tyranny of Experts, Easterly analyzes a broader shortcoming of the development community's efforts‚Äîfailure to recognize the importance of the rights of the poor. Development, he argues, is narrowly focused on the material well-being of its intended beneficiaries. Development \\"experts\\" champion technical solutions such as mosquito nets or latrines, believing they will end poverty. Easterly argues that these technical solutions by experts fail to address the core of the problem. The lack of individual rights, including political and economic ones, prevents the poor from implementing bottom-up, spontaneously emerging solutions to development problems, and from defending their interests from abusive dictators. Development organizations often side with abusive autocrats by lauding their development achievements (which, economic analysis shows, cannot be credited to leadershttp://www.nyudri.org/wp- content/uploads/2011/10/Easterly-Pennings-2014-Jan-Leaders-and-Growth.pdf) and ignoring their dismal human rights records. The first step, Easterly argues, is to at least open a debate, a discussion about why the rights of the poor matter. Sachs responded to Easterly's arguments, leading to a prolonged debate.http://reason.com/archives/2013/10/04/the-big-aid-debate-is-over Sachs accused Easterly of excessive pessimism, overestimating costs, and overlooking past successes.. Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen has praised Easterly for analysis of the problems of foreign aid, but criticized his sweeping debarment of all plans, lacking the due distinctions between different types of problems, and not giving the aid institutions credit for understanding the points he is making.Amartya Sen, The Man Without a Plan, Foreign Affairs. March/April 2006 Easterly responded to Sachs in a letter in Foreign Policy in January 2014. Easterly has also produced a critical review of, and received a rebuttal from, Cambridge University economist Ha-Joon Chang, to which he offered a counter- rebuttal. https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2009/10/08/the-anarchy-of- success/https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2009/11/19/the-anarchy-of-success-2/ Easterly's work has been discussed in media outlets such as National Public Radio, the BBC, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, The Economist, The New Yorker, Forbes, Business Week, the Financial Times, and the Christian Science Monitor.

She operates the principal ferry service to the Isles of Scilly and is one of only three ships in the world still carrying the status of Royal Mail Ship (hence RMV ‚Äì Royal Mail Vessel). History RMV Scillonian III was purpose built for the Steamship Company by Appledore Shipbuilders Ltd of Appledore in Devon and was christened by H.R.H. Prince Charles, Duke of Cornwall on 17 May 1977 and entered service later in the same month. She is the third passenger ship to carry the Scillonian name and made her first trip to Scilly on 19 May 1977, sailing from Bideford to St Mary's.Description on Hearts of Oak The Penzance/Isles of Scilly Mail Packets. On the arrival of the new ship, critics found it \\"too big, they will never hold her, not suitable or not as good a sea boat as the old boat\\" (the same had happened when the first Scillonian went into service in 1926 and again with her replacement in 1956).\\"Scillonian III Back in Service after ¬£1,700,000 Refit\\" in Scilly up to Date, issue 120 (April 1999) , accessed 2011-08-16 Scillonian III has a length of 68 m, a beam of 11.85 m, a draft of 2.89 m, a gross tonnage of 1255.25, and a service speed of . Due to the number of tidal currents which meet off Land's End, and the need for a shallow draught to allow access to the Islands, the sea journey can be rough, causing sea sickness. For this reason the ship is fitted with a \\"Flume\\" antiroll stabiliser system. The ship is also designed to have a shallow draft and can sit on the seabed when there is insufficient water.Cornwall Council St Mary‚Äôs and Penzance Harbours Scheme Update August 2014 Scillonian III is currently in service for passengers and cargo 8 months of the year, carrying up to 485 passengers (the current licensed limit) for day trips or longer holidays to the Islands. As a preferred means of transport between Scilly and the mainland, she is a familiar sight in Penzance and St Mary's ‚Äì often photographed by tourists and also featured in the BBC series, An Island Parish. In 1998, faced with the cost of building a new ship, the Company decided to give Scillonian III a major refit, during which over 50 tons of steel were used to increase the standard of the ship. The ship also had three new generators and a new bow thruster fitted. The cost was ¬£1.7 million. In early 2007, press reports indicated that Cornwall County Council was expected to approve plans for the construction of a new ro-ro ferry at a cost of ¬£17.5 million. This vessel would be leased to the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company and would replace both Scillonian III and Gry Maritha. The scheme subsequently collapsed.Isles of Scilly ferry link: ¬£4m spent on failed scheme, July 2011. During the winter of 2012‚Äì13 the ship underwent a ¬£2 million overhaul which refurbished the passenger accommodation and also extended the ship's service life to 2018. The ship's 40th anniversary was in May 2017 and during that time she has made more than 9,000 return journeys, travelled more than and carried more than 1,458,000 passengers. Schedule From new in 1977 Scillonian III operated a year-round route through all weather conditions to service the cargo and passenger transport to and from Penzance and the island of St. Mary's, in the Isles of Scilly. At that time she would run a regular single daily service on weekdays leaving at 0915 from Penzance and then returning to Penzance from St. Mary's leaving at 1530. On Saturdays she was scheduled to run a double service leaving earlier in the morning and making a quick turnaround at lunchtime in St. Mary's and then performing a second return voyage in the afternoon. In 1990 it was decided to change the service and only run a seasonal operation. The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company Ltd. later purchased a smaller cargo vessel purely for freight and Scillonian III was put into maintenance and repair during the winter months. Scillonian III now runs between Penzance and Hugh Town, St. Mary's for about eight months only, from early spring (March/April) until autumn (October/November).Channel Images blog of photographer Chris Jones, accessed 15 August 2011Isles of Scilly Travel: By Sea (accessed 2011-08-18) Through the winter months, she is laid up in Penzance harbour and a cargo-only service to the Isles of Scilly is then provided by Gry Maritha.Isles of Scilly SS Co on www.simplonpc.co.uk, accessed 2011-08-16. The annual winter period is used to carry out a maintenance programme, during which Scillonian III is painted and undergoes technical inspections as well as surveys for passenger vessel certification by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.Scillonian III shipshape and ready, 25 February 2010 , accessed 2011-08-16. The ferry's season thus largely coincides with the tourist season on the Isles of Scilly,Scillonian sailing dates in 2010 were from 27 March ‚Äì 30 October , in 2011 from 26 March to 29 October which normally runs from Easter to the first weekend in October. The ferry is in fact so closely associated with the summer season on Scilly that for many people, \\"the sight of the ship Scillonian III [arriving in the Isles of Scilly] is a celebrated indication that spring has sprung.\\" During her months of operation, Scillonian III follows a regular schedule. The ferry normally sails six days a week from Monday to Saturday, typically leaving Penzance at 09:15 am and arriving in Hugh Town around 12:00 noon, which means a sailing time of approximately 2 hours 40 minutes. This is the vessel's standard schedule, which only sees occasional variations on Saturdays.Richard Seville: \\"Isles of Scilly Steamship Company ‚Äì RMS Scillonian III\\" in Irish Sea Shipping voyage reports (2001) On most days, when Scillonian III sails from the UK mainland at 09:15 am, she will stay in Hugh Town until 16:30 pm.Isles of Scilly Travel: Scillonian III sailing times and dates (accessed 2011-08-16) On some occasions, when changing tides or weather forecasts affect her sailings so that she has to leave Penzance at about 10:30, she will leave Hugh Town again around 15:00, and on the few days when she needs to sail from Penzance at about 08:30, she will depart Hugh Town at about 11:15. Times and dates may also change due to school holidays, special occasions and unexpected events. Two sailings a day, Sunday or night sailings are rare and usually only arranged by the Steamship Company when an exceptionally high number of passengers depend on the ferry service. This may be the case on busy weekends at the start of the summer season, around the World Pilot Gig Championships, and more regularly during the year when the air services between the Isles of Scilly and the mainland are grounded due to poor visibility (see \\"Notable events\\" below). Scillonian III is part of the emergency response and civil contingency for incidents occurring on the Isles of Scilly. Notable events On 26 March 1997, when the 300-ft container vessel Cita hit rocks off the south coast of the Isles of Scilly, the crew of the stricken vessel were rescued by St Mary's Lifeboat with the support of a helicopter from RNAS Culdrose. They returned to the UK mainland on board Scillonian III later that afternoon. As air traffic to Scilly was suspended for the day due to poor visibility on the mainland, the government authorities chartered the Scillonian III to make a night sailing from Penzance to bring officials, shipwreck specialists and police reinforcements to St Mary's.Wreck of the Cita by John B. Luxton (accessed 2011-08-16) On Monday 12 August 2002, Scillonian III could not sail because of a technical fault, leaving hundreds of tourists temporarily stranded on St Mary's. The ferry had to remain docked in Penzance while engineers worked on the fault. Travellers booked in for the sailing were advised to make alternative arrangements; however British International and Skybus services struggled to cope with the massive extra demand for seats, the problem made worse by one of British International's two helicopters being grounded. Cancellation of Scillonian III's sailing mainly affected day trip passengers to Scilly and visitors staying in guesthouses, as in many cases they could not be re-accommodated in the same guesthouse. Freight services to St Mary's were also disrupted by the cancellation, so Gry Maritha had to make a rescheduled Monday night sailing to deliver fruit and vegetables to the Isles of Scilly.Hundreds of Tourists Stranded, 11 August 2002 (accessed 2011-08-16) On 17 June 2010, a Scilly shrew made headlines on BBC Cornwall when it stowed away from the Isles of Scilly on Scillonian III. The small 2 in (5 cm) mammal was discovered in a corner of the Upper Deck as the ferry was about to arrive in Penzance and staff were clearing the area near the gangway. Paul Semmens, the Isles of Scilly Wildlife Trust's onboard marine guide, identified the animal as a shrew about two months old and looked after it for the night. The next day, the shrew was flown back from Penzance to Scilly on a Skybus plane and released back into its natural environment. Managers at the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company said they thought it could have been the smallest passenger ever to travel on Scillonian III and the Skybus.Cornish ferry stowaway shrew flown home, 17 June 2010 (accessed 2011-08-16) On 21 April 2011, Scillonian III was issued with her new certificate by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency so her carrying capacity of 600 passengers could be reinstated. This came in time for the start of the summer season on the Isles of Scilly and the World Pilot Gig Championships.Media release by the Isles of Scilly Steamship Company, 21 April 2011 On 2 May 2011, the cancellation of a Scillonian III sailing on the bank holiday after the World Pilot Gig Championships weekend left visitors stranded on St Mary's. Two sailings were scheduled that day to take gig rowers home. Scillonian III departed for the first sailing as planned, but with weather conditions worsening in the strong Easterlies and waves crashing onto the pier in Penzance it became unsafe to berth and she had to spend three hours circling in Mount's Bay, waiting until high tide with 450 passengers on board. When the second sailing was then cancelled, council staff opened up emergency accommodation at their Carn Thomas offices and Town Hall to provide shelter for visitors stranded on St Mary's.Update on Scillonian III sailing, 3 May 2011 (accessed 2011-08-16) Radio Scilly: Scillonian Sailing Cancellation Causes Chaos, 2 May 2011 (accessed 2011-08-16) On 29 June 2011, a passenger had to be airlifted from Scillonian III by a rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose after complaining about severe chest pains. The day trip visitor had become unwell around 30 minutes out of Penzance, so a doctor travelling on board asked for the helicopter. The ferry retreated to a more sheltered part of the coast, near Mousehole, so the patient could be winched up without having to cope with the strong winds.Woman airlifted from Scillonian III, 29 June 2011 (accessed 2011-08-16) On 24 May 2013, Scillonian III ran aground in St Mary's Harbour after being caught by a gust of wind, while attempting to berth by normal approach at low tide. The captain was intending to retreat and wait for the tide to rise when wind blew her shoreward and she made contact with the bottom, stranding 203 passengers for more than an hour. Two moorings were lost as a result and a smaller boat received superficial damage, but nobody was hurt and a later inspection by divers revealed that there was no damage to the Scillonian III. She left as scheduled at 4.30pm that afternoon. On Wednesday 28 August 2019, Scillonian III had to return to Penzance after it suffered a technical fault mid-crossing which caused the ship to be out of service for four days, leading to significant travel disruption between the islands and mainland. The mechanical issue related to a pump serving both engines' hydraulics and lubrication systems. Engineering teams in Penzance undertook a complex strip down and rebuild process to access and carry out repairs, complicated and further delayed when one of the replacement parts delivered was found to have a hairline fracture and had to be reordered. The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company sought to relieve the situation by using its Skybus service. A total of 52 additional Skybus flights were put on between Thursday 28 August 2019 and Sunday 1 September 2019, moving approx. 1,100 passengers due to have sailed. However, air capacity was insufficient to move all affected passengers and several hundred people remained on the islands awaiting the resumption of the ferry service. The story of 'stranded passengers' attracted local and national news coverage.Hundreds stranded in Isles of Scilly by ferry breakdown The Guardian 1 September 2019Tourists stranded on the Isles of Scilly finally evacuated after a four-day delay - iNews 1 September 2019Isles of Scilly evacuation underway to bring stranded holidaymakers home after ferry breaks down - Telegraph 2 September 2019 The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company issued a statement praising residents and businesses on the islands and its own team members, ‚Ä≥for the way they have pulled together in what have been unprecedented circumstances to deal with the issue, support passengers and ensure no one on the islands has been left without proper accommodation.‚Ä≥ The Scillonian III returned to service on Sunday 1 September 2019 and completed a double sailing on Monday 2 September 2019, clearing the backlog of affected passengers. Normal scheduled sailings resumed on Tuesday 3 September 2019.

Some time after Gry Maritha was acquired, Scillonian IIIs funnel and crane were painted blue to closer match the colours of the other ship, despite the Gry Maritha being a lighter colour blue with a white superstructure. For two seasons after the change of schedule post 1990, the lower half of her hull was painted dark blue with the upper half and superstructure, remaining white. The funnel was painted blue and white striped with a house flag, painted on the sides in the white stripe. The crane, davits and masts were painted blue. Thereafter the hull was returned to its original white colour with the flag on the side of the funnel becoming a stylized fluttering company house flag without the red lettering. Following customer feedback and comments about the change of colour, the colour scheme was returned to the original white and buff, but with the addition of the fluttering house flag, complete with the red lettering. For much of the first decade of the 21st century, Scillonian III remained in this appearance. Shortly before the start of the 2010 season, the colours of the ferry's funnel were again changed, this time to white and a black soot ring around the top with a smaller emblem from the marketing material, of the Steamship Company consists of a stylized, flag like, overall shape made up of four quadrant shapes that are not parallel, the left being blue and the right being red. The crane, masts and davits remained in the buff colour.

SCATS is based on the automatic plan selection from a library in response to the data derived from loop detectors or other road traffic sensors. SCATS uses sensors at each traffic signal to detect vehicle presence in each lane and pedestrians waiting to cross at the local site. The vehicle sensors are generally inductive loops installed within the road pavement. The pedestrian sensors are usually push buttons. Various other types of sensors can be used for vehicle presence detection, provided that a similar and consistent output is achieved. Information collected from the vehicle sensors allows SCATS to calculate and adapt the timing of traffic signals in the network. SCATS is installed at about 42,000 intersections in over 1800 cities in 40 countries. In Australia, where the system was first developed, the majority of signalised intersections are SCATS operated (around 11,000). The SCATS system is owned by the Australian state of New South Wales, whose state capital is Sydney. In December 2019, Transport for NSW, the transport and road agency in New South Wales, began to look into commercialising the SCATS system. Features =Default operation= The architecture of SCATS is at two basic levels, LOCAL and MASTER. The LOCAL is the control cabinet at the roadside, which provides the normal signal control as well as processing of traffic information deduced from the vehicle detectors. The MASTER is a remote computer which provides area based traffic control, i.e. area traffic control (ATC) or urban traffic control (UTC). Detailed traffic signal and hardware diagnostics are passed from the LOCAL to the MASTER, with the ability to notify staff when a traffic signal has a fault. SCATS is able to operate over PAPL, ADSL, PSTN and 3G IP network connections to each intersection. SCATS can also operate on a network of private cables not requiring third party telecommunications support and large parts of inner Sydney have always operated this way. =Priority levels= Public vehicle priority in SCATS (using data provided from PTIPS) caters for both buses and trams. SCATS has a facility to provide three levels of priority: * High ‚Äì In the high priority mode the hurry call facility is used. i.e. the phase needed by the tram is called immediately, skipping other phases if necessary * Medium (Flexible window) ‚Äì Phases can be shortened to allow the bus/tram phase to be brought in early. The bus/tram phase can occur at more than one place in the cycle. * Low ‚Äì takes its turn. Trams would normally be given high priority, the aim of which is to get the tram through without it stopping. Buses would normally expect to receive a medium level of priority. =Instant fault detection and quick repair= The ATC system is equipped with the function of fault detection and logging the fault detected in order to facilitate repair and maintenance. Should there be a telecommunication breakdown, the ATC junction controller concerned will switch to standalone mode and continue to function. =Traffic Adaptive Operation= ATC systems provide advanced method of traffic signal control called Traffic Adaptive Control where the operational timing plans including cycle length, splits and offsets are continuously reviewed and modified in small increment, almost on a cycle-by-cycle basis, to match with the prevailing demand measured by the detectors connected to the on-street traffic controllers. SCATS Ramp Metering System The SCATS Ramp Metering System (SRMS)Aydos J.C., O'Brien A. SCATS Ramp Metering: Strategies, Arterial Integration and Results, Proceedings of the 17th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, Qingdao, 2014 is a SCATS subsystem and controls traffic signals at the entries of motorways and integrates with SCATS intersection control for promoting integrated real-time management of the traffic corridor as a whole. The objective of SRMS, based on current traffic conditions, is to efficiently determine: * When ramp metering signals start and end ramp metering operation * The metering flow rates of the operating ramp metering signals * Which actions shall be taken to signalised intersections of the corridor to promote network-wide benefits. SRMS achieves these objectives by implementing a collection of pre-configured adaptive intelligent strategies either automatically or manually. In manual mode, the SRMS operator can create new or manipulate existing rules in order to adjust the ramp metering system for effective operation during any planned or unplanned events (e.g. incidents). SRMS is a distributed control system that operates on a central control server and road-side traffic controllers. The central control server is a component of SCATS and inherently provide integrated motorway and arterial real-time management. The road-side controllers are installed on motorway on-ramps and are used to: * Set the traffic signal times * Set the state of on-ramp changeable signs * Manage the sequences start and end ramp metering operation; and * Measure traffic states using vehicle detectors. Metering rates are determined by the local traffic signal controller or by the central control server. Metering rates can be determined in two ways: * adaptive operation, or * time-of-day-based operation typically when a communications failure or critical vehicle detector failures take place The adaptive operation optimises mainline traffic state by using real-time data from vehicle detector stations installed at several mainline locations, ramps and optionally at arterial roads. The adaptive operation determines control actions at 10 seconds intervals and applies some or all of the following strategies simultaneously: * Coordinated ramp metering * Ramp queue management * Automatic begin and end of ramp metering operation * Variation routines for integration with SCATS intersection control * Variation routines for automated incident responses and unusual circumstances * Manual controls for incident responses and unusual circumstances * Critical lane occupancy calibration * Fault-tolerant strategies * Data logging for performance reporting and off-line analysis SRMS is currently used as the Auckland ramp metering system. Simulation SCATS can be simulated in-the- loop (SCATSIM) using third party traffic simulation tools. SCATSIM offers an interface supported by Aimsun, PTV VISSIM, Quadstone Paramics and Commuter. SCATSIM offers kerb-side hardware and firmware emulation that interfaces seamless to the SCATS Region and Central Manager offering the same control strategies used in field deployments for both intersections and ramp metering (SRMS). The configuration files prepared by authorities for the Central Manager, Region, SRMS and kerb-side controllers can be re-used without modification by SCATSIM. When Commuter software was acquired by Autodesk,Commuter Software was acquired by Autodesk Azalient Ltd support for the Commuter interface was deprecated. Azalient Ltd also developed a plugin that enabled the Quadstone Paramics interface to SCATSIM. This plugin is also deprecated. History SCATS was developed in Sydney, Australia by the New South Wales Department of Main Roads (a predecessor of Transport for NSW) in the 1970s. It began to be used in Melbourne in 1982,Vehicle detectors to be installed to stop road congestion Adelaide, South Australia in 1982 and Western Australia in 1983. It is also used in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Amman, Tehran, Dublin, Rzesz√≥w, Gdynia, Central New Jersey, Accessed October 13, 2016 and soon in part of Metro Atlanta,ATCS being implemented in Metro Atlanta among several other places. In Hong Kong, SCATS is currently adopted in the area traffic control systems at Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, Tsuen Wan and Shatin. The system may be referred to by an alternative name in a specific installation. However, since deployment outside Australia, New Zealand and Singapore, localised names do not appear to be commonly used. The following are some local alternative names that have been or are in use: * Canberra \\"CATSS\\" (Canberra Automated Traffic Signal System) * Melbourne \\"SCRAM\\" (Signal Co-ordination for Regional Areas of Melbourne) * Adelaide \\"ACTS\\" (Adelaide Co-ordinated Traffic Signals) * Perth \\"PCATS\\" * Singapore \\"GLIDE\\" * Northern Territory \\"DARTS\\" SCATS is a recognised worldwide market leader in intelligent transport systems.

It was established in 1963. Its current Governor is Constantinos Herodotou The bank issued Cypriot pound banknotes and coins prior to 2008, when Cyprus adopted the euro. History Central bank of Cyprus headquarters in Nicosia Central bank with Nicosia skyline The Central Bank of Cyprus has its origins in the British Colonial Government of Cyprus, which established a Cyprus Currency Board in 1927. This followed on from the unilateral annexation of Cyprus by the British Empire in 1914, the Treaty of Lausanne, establishing the legality in international law of this British takeover, in 1923, and the full establishment of a colonial system of government in Cyprus, with the creation of a Legislative Council, in 1926.Wadan Narsey, British Imperialism and the Making of Colonial Currency Systems (London: Palgrave, 2016) p.159 The role of the Chairman of the Currency Board was held by the Accountant General, also known as the Auditor General, of the Government of Cyprus. The Board could issue notes and coins, initially denominated in the Cypriot pound, shillings and piastres, and later, following decimalization, in Cyprus pounds and mils.Kate Phylaktis, The Banking System of Cyprus: Past, Present and Future (London: Macmillan, 1995), p.42 However, the local currency was pegged at one Cyprus pound to one pound sterling meaning ultimate fiscal control still rested with the Bank of England in London and the Government of the United Kingdom. This link was maintained by the requirement that for every Cyprus pound issued by the Currency Board in Cyprus, one pound sterling issued by the Bank of England had to be deposited by the Government of Cyprus with the Crown Agents in London.As required by Article 13 of the Currency Law (Cyprus) Cap. 197. With independence from Britain in 1960, Article 118 of the Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus, which came into force on the island on 1 April 1960, gave the President and Vice-President of Cyprus the right to establish a new central bank, called in the Constitution the 'Issuing Bank' and appoint its Governor. Article 119 sets out the responsibilities of the Governor and the Issuing Bank, Article 120 states that the Governor of the Issuing Bank shall abide by future relevant laws enacted by the Republic of Cyprus, and Article 121 gives the Government of the Republic of Cyprus the right to convert the Issuing Bank into a Central Bank if it wishes. In effect, the Issuing Bank was a continuation of the former colonial Currency Board within the framework of the Constitution of the new Republic, but the Constitution gave the right to the Republic to convert it into a Central Bank if it chose to do so. A decision to do this was taken in 1963, and the Issuing Bank was replaced that year by the Central Bank of Cyprus. Following the accession of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union in 2004, the Central Bank of Cyprus became a member of the Eurozone group of central banks in 2008, when the island converted from using the Cyprus pound to the euro currency. Role of the Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus The Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus is the highest official in the Central Bank of Cyprus and is appointed by the President of the Republic. The position was established in 1963 when the Central Bank of Cyprus was established. The convention is for the Governor to serve a term of five years, but this is renewable. The Governor has the responsibility of chairing the meetings of the Central Bank's Governing Council and Board of Directors. He or she had the responsibility for setting the Central Bank's policy in relation to the Cypriot economy, but this responsibility passed to the President of the European Central Bank on 1 January 2008, which is also the date that Cyprus changed over to the euro from the Cypriot pound.

It is a procreation sonnet within the Fair Youth sequence. Structure Sonnet 14 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which consists of three quatrains followed by a couplet. It follows the traditional rhyme scheme of the form: ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Like many of the others in the sequence, it is written in a type of metre called iambic pentameter, which is based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions per line. Typically English sonnets present a problem or argument in the quatrains, and a resolution in the final couplet. This sonnet suggests this pattern, but its rhetorical structure is more closely modeled upon the older Petrarchan sonnet which arranges the octave (the first eight lines) in contrast to the sestet (the final six lines). Line 3 exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / √ó / But not to tell of good, or evil luck, (14.3) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. √ó = nonictus.  Historical Context  Some critics argue that the Fair Youth sequence follows a story- line told by Shakespeare. Evidence that corroborates this is that the sonnets show a constant change of attitude that would seem to follow a day-by-day private journal entry. Furthermore, there is an argument that the Fair Youth sequence was written to Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton. Critics believe that Shakespeare would like him to marry and have an heir so that his beauty would live forever. The historical timeline of the procreation sonnets directly relates to William Cecil Lord Burghley and the pressure he put on Southampton to marry his granddaughter Lady Elizabeth Vere (daughter of Edward de Vere). To this day the relationship between Henry Wriothesly and Shakespeare is debated due to the fact that some believe it was romantic in nature, and not platonic. Regardless most critics agree that Shakespeare wrote this sonnet in order to convince him to produce an heir.  Exegesis  Sonnet 14 contains a speaker that may not know how to predict the future or what will happen, but they do know the value of procreating to retain one's beauty throughout the ages. =Quatrain 1= Quatrain 1 has multiple references to astronomy, and other literature. Edward Dowden argues that Philip Sidney's Astrophel and Stella is an influence in this sonnet due to the nature of both of the sonnets. For example, Sonnet 26 of Sidney's Astrophel and Stella has a line \\"though duskie wits doe scorne Astrology.. who oft bewares my after following case, by only those two starres in Stella's face.\\" A. L. Rowse points out in both of these poems the speaker is unable to predict the future by using astrology, and can only predict the future through the object of their poem's eyes. According to Frederick Fleays, lines 3-4 are possible references to plagues that occurred in 1592‚Äì1593, and the dearths that followed in 1594‚Äì1596. Alfread Rollins also states there was an irregularity in the seasons in 1595‚Äì1596, which all could have influenced these lines from Shakespeare. =Quatrain 2= Lines 8‚Äì9 have influences from Ovid's Amores and Shakespeare's own \\"Love Labor's Lost\\". George Steevens points out that Shakespeare's early comedy included a line stating \\"From women's eyes this doctrine I derive.\\" In the context of Sonnet 14 it is explaining the importance of procreation, and that it is necessary. Ovid's Amores has a similar line \\"at mihe te comitem auroras usque futuram- per me perque oculos, siders rostra, tuos.\\" Both Samuel Johnson and George Steevens noted the similar meaning and that it indicates Roman influence on Shakespeare's poetry. =Quatrain 3= Lines 10-11 are saying that one can see that truth and beauty would thrive together; if only you would focus on the business of making provisions for yourself. =Couplet= Shakespeare uses the portentous polysyllabic verb prognosticate with the alliteration 'doom and date' which is the stock in the trade of astrologers. This is Shakespeare's prognostication, and it is delivered with a smile. West believed this due to the emphasis against the metre on 'this'. Line 14 is saying that when one is dead, their truths and beauties come to an end as well.

It is partially inspired by the true story of Gustave, a , giant, man-eating crocodile in Burundi, and centers on a team of American journalists who travel to Burundi to film and capture him. The film was released on January 12, 2007 worldwide. Plot In Burundi, a British forensic anthropologist is examining the corpses in a mass grave, claiming they were all killed in an identical manner. When the woman digs her shovel into what she believes is another grave, an unseen creature attacks and violently drags her into the river. The UN soldiers accompanying her fire into the water, but only her mangled corpse floats to the surface - before being devoured. In a New York City newsroom, television journalist Tim Manfrey (Dominic Purcell) is assigned by his boss, Roger (Patrick Lyster), to travel to Burundi with Aviva Masters (Brooke Langton), a reporter who deals with animal stories and has become interested in Gustave, a gigantic, fierce crocodile known to have killed hundreds of people in Africa, over the years. With the killing of the anthropologist, Gustave is suddenly a story of interest to the world. Tim doesn't want to go, knowing that Burundi is a war zone, but he has little choice, since one of his stories turns out to have been based on falsified evidence. Tim and Aviva are accompanied to Burundi by Tim's cameraman and friend, Steven Johnson (Orlando Jones) and herpetologist Matt Collins (Gideon Emery), who is intent on capturing Gustave alive. At the airport in Bujumbura they are met by a government official nicknamed Harry (Dumisani Mbebe), who tries to delay their departure by warning them of unrest in the bush, caused by a dangerous warlord who has nicknamed himself \\"Little Gustave.\\" Tim manages to overrule Harry by faking a call to Roger, and the team departs the next day, accompanied by two soldiers. When the party reach the village where the last attack occurred, they meet their guide, a licensed hunter named Jacob (J√ºrgen Prochnow), and are blessed by the local shaman. The friendly villagers later assemble a steel cage in order to capture the crocodile and take it to a nearby swamp. The first attempt to capture Gustave, by placing a goat as bait, fails, but Matt manages to shoot a tracking dart into it. The next day, Steven happens upon the shaman and his family being executed by men working for Little Gustave and films it. While the others debate airing the footage, Jojo (Gabriel Malema), a teenage villager who helped set up the cage, uses himself as live bait to capture Gustave. The beast arrives, and tries to devour him, but disappears, as Tim, Matt, and Steven race to rescue him. Meanwhile, Aviva catches one of the soldier escorts stealing money from a tent. The soldier knocks her down and attempts to rape her, but Gustave arrives and kills him. Aviva escapes unharmed, and catches up with the others. The remaining guard relays over his radio that the Americans videotaped the shaman's execution. Just as the group realizes that the soldiers work for Little Gustave, the remaining guards, believing Jacob videotaped the evidence, wounds him; Jojo intervenes, and shoots them. While Jacob's wound is being treated, Gustave attacks the group. Jacob recalls the story of how his wife, Ona, was killed by Gustave, and that he swore revenge. Jacob produces a grenade, and detonates it as Gustave grabs him in his jaws, and devours him, but the explosion fails to kill the crocodile. The next day, a helicopter arrives to airlift the survivors, but a truck arrives with two of Little Gustave's men, who fire a rocket at the helicopter. The group ducks, except for Matt, who runs after the helicopter to stop it from flying away. Matt is rammed by the truck and shot to death by the younger of the two militia members, a teenager performing what is clearly his first execution. When the driver of the truck notices the rest of the group, Tim yells for them to split up. In the ensuing chase, both of Little Gustave's men are killed: when the truck crashes into the river, the teenager is thrown out and dies on impact, while the driver is shot by Aviva when he tries to strangle Tim to death. Steven stumbles upon Gustave and struggles to escape. While Aviva stays with the injured Jojo, Tim goes to look for Steven, but finds only his camera. As they are waiting for help, Tim remarks to Aviva that he now understands the shaman's earlier words that \\"we make our own monsters.\\" Matt had earlier told the group that crocodiles frequently feed on carrion, and there is no limit to how large they can grow, given enough sustenance; it is the bodies from the civil war, floating in the river, that have given Gustave a taste for human flesh, and allowed him to reach such a gargantuan size, as the years go by. Harry arrives in a Range Rover, but Tim realizes that he is actually Little Gustave upon discovering the shaman's necklace in his possession, who wants the video evidence. Tim attempts to trick Harry by giving him the GPS tracker linked to the dart on Gustave, saying it will locate the computer with the video. Harry forces Tim and Aviva to lead them to the \\"computer.\\" While Harry holds Aviva at gunpoint, Tim and one of Harry's men follow the tracking signal to Gustave's lair, where the crocodile is sleeping. Tim finds Steven's mutilated body, and a combat knife in the scattered human remains, and stabs the guard. At the same moment, Aviva splatters Harry with Matt's container of crocodile pheromones and runs. Gustave wakes up but catches the scent of the pheromones, ignoring Tim and Aviva in favor of devouring Harry. Tim, Jojo and Aviva climb into the Range Rover, but Gustave attacks through the rear window. Tim stabs the crocodile in the mouth with a machete. It then roars in defeat, as the others manage to escape. Tim, Aviva, Jojo, and Wiley receive medical treatment and fly back home to America, watching leftover footage of Steven on his camera. The end credits state that the Burundian Civil War ended with a ceasefire in 2005, but Gustave is very much alive and still killing people in the Rusizi River of Burundi.

Its headquarters is located at 1002 West First Street in Cedar Falls. The district is in Black Hawk County and includes almost all of the Cedar Falls city limits as well as a small section of Waterloo. The area of the district is with approximately 36,000 residents. The district employs over 500 personnel in its ten schools and two support buildings.

Today, a marker commemorates the site of the Taylor home. ;Central School In 1863, the old Central School was constructed to serve grades K-12 which occupied an entire city block. In 1875, due to population increases, a west wing addition was added to the main building. ;Lincoln School In the 1890s the name was changed to Lincoln School. Later (before 1893) an east wing addition as well as a bell tower was added. ;First high school In 1900, Cedar Falls High School was constructed as the first separate high school in Cedar Falls. The building was located where the Cedar Falls Recreation Center currently resides.

The \\"sidekick\\" to Morse, Lewis is a detective sergeant in the Thames Valley Police, and appears in all 13 Morse novels. In the television adaptation, Inspector Morse, he is played by Kevin Whately. Following the conclusion of the series, Whately reprised the role as the lead character in Lewis, in which the character has been promoted to the rank of inspector. Character history =Inspector Morse= Lewis is a sergeant on the staff of the Thames Valley Police in Oxford, England, and in Inspector Morse is assistant to the eponymous Detective Chief Inspector Morse. Although Lewis's given name is Robert (Robbie), he was rarely referred to as anything but \\"Sergeant Lewis\\" or \\"Lewis.\\" The background and personality of Lewis ‚Äì a working class, easygoing family man with a Geordie accent ‚Äì is frequently contrasted with that of Morse ‚Äì Oxford educated, RP-accented, lifetime bachelor. Morse frequently uses these differences to insult or demean Lewis, perhaps from Morse's point of view in a playful manner, but Lewis is often not amused by the jabs. In his frustration, Lewis is often more in step with their joint superior Chief Superintendent Strange, himself an evident supporter of Lewis; however, despite a great respect towards Strange, Lewis is always unflinchingly loyal to Morse and follows his lead. In Inspector Morse, Lewis is often shown following a hunch that Morse criticises, and in the end Lewis is usually proved correct, or at least more correct than Morse. Near the end of the television series, Lewis moves on in his career and takes a promotion. With the end of Inspector Morse and the death of its star, John Thaw, Lewis's adventures had seemed to come to an end. In the episode \\"The Dead of Jericho\\", Lewis tells Morse \\"It's also my birthday\\". The first victim is killed on 11 June, and this utterance occurs a few days to a week later. This puts Lewis' birthday in mid-June. Lewis does not make an appearance in the episode \\"The Wench is Dead\\", as he is out of town on an inspector's course. =Lewis= In the pilot episode, Lewis returns to Oxford from a two-year stint training police in the British Virgin Islands, following the death of his wife Valerie in a hit-and-run accident. Lewis still must work partly in the shadow of the now-five-years-dead Inspector Morse, who some time prior to his death had worked a case involving one of the murder suspects as a juvenile. In the new series, Lewis gains his own junior, Detective Sergeant James Hathaway (played by Laurence Fox), a Cambridge-educated man who joined the police after giving up training for the priesthood. Another staple of the series, pathologist Dr. Laura Hobson (played by Clare Holman), who appears late in the Morse series, continues on through all of the Lewis episodes as a witty part of the team, with a cynical sense of humour and as a romantic interest to him. After Robbie retires (and before he returns to work at the request of their superior, Chief Superintendent Jean Innocent, played by Rebecca Front), Hathaway gains his own assistant, Detective Sergeant Elizabeth (Lizzie) Maddox (played by Angela Griffin). Maddox is black, married, smart, and usually very matter of fact, and occasionally shows a sense of humour in her work with James (and Robbie). In one episode, she is almost killed (an attempted murder by the villain of the episode). The popularity of the one-off episode spurred the continuation of the story into a total of nine series comprising 33 episodes, the most recent airing in 2015. In the latest series, Lewis had retired from the police force, but is brought back as a consultant to work with Hathaway, who is now a detective inspector himself. Casting Two notable differences between the Lewis from the novels and Whately's portrayal is that Lewis in the novels is Welsh and in his early sixties. However, Colin Dexter has stated that the younger Lewis is an improvement on the character he originally created.

Customers of service bureaus typically do not have the scale or expertise to incorporate these services into their internal operations and prefer to outsource them to a service bureau. Outsourced payroll services constitute a commonly provisioned service from a service bureau. The business model question One writer described the ideal service bureau customer as only needing vanilla: very little customization per customer. The phrasing is catering \\"to the bell curve of customer requirements.\\" If strawberry banana is needed, it is important to ask: :Did they develop their own platform or license or purchase it? To its customers, a service bureau offers a combination of expertise in technology, process and business-domains. The bureau business model depends on the ability to productize services and deploy them in volume to a large customer base. In the modern context, technology often becomes a key enabler to achieving this scale. Histories IBM 082 card sorter Data processing service bureaus were opened by IBM in 1932, first just in major USA cities, then internationally. The purpose was to provide access to then-state-of-the- art Tab Equipment rather than own basis. Keypunching at Texas A&M; Keypunching (a term that long-preceded \\"data entry\\") was often part of what was offered. IBM 029 Keypunch machine As Batch processing systems replaced Tab Equipment, service bureaus could offer this too.\\"...estimating batch processing charges at service bureau sites.\\" A few decades later, sharing of mainframes via Timesharing was a step forward.IBM's ad was headlined: \\"This man is sharing a $2 million computer\\" These concepts already existed - advertising and Ad agencies. Initially newspapers sold space in bulk to print space brokers; they resold the space, but individual customers made their own ads. Subsequently, the concept of having someone else write your ad took over. =Some service bureau functions= * Management of a national survey of corporate catering (300,000 questionnaires) * A specialized service bureau might be good at doing direct mail, perhaps just for a single target.e.g. car buyers. ::Founded in 1866 as an Ohio business forms printer, in 1927 they began to specialize as printers of accounting forms for car dealers. In the 1960s they added dealership computer services. =Landart: a more detailed example= Although Landart Systems, Inc (LSI) opened in 1973 as a DECsystem-20-based timesharing bureau that also did computerized typesetting, it was the 1977 introduction of the Xerox 9700 high-end laser printer which was Landart's subsequent mark of distinction. The 9700 could accept input via direct computer link or from magnetic tape, thus allowing the next step: a service they called Laserlink.\\"The company, Landart Systems, is offering LaserLink, an interactive timesharing service that combines high-speed Xerox 9700 laser printing, graphics \\"The Laserlink service consists of the Xerox 9700 Electronic Printing System with ...\\" Founded by John Gilmour, a data processing manager whose Wall Street employer folded, the initial goal was to have the various services needed to perform typesetting, financial computer graphics, word processing and general timesharing under one roof. Laserlink and another specialty, electronic publishing (which was then uncommon) allowed Landart to advance.

Biography =Early life= Vandever was born in Baltimore, Maryland, where he attended the common schools and pursued an academic course. He moved to Illinois in 1839 and to Iowa in 1851. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1852 and commenced practice in Dubuque, Iowa. He was of Dutch descent. In 1858 he was elected as a Republican to represent Iowa's 2nd congressional district in the Thirty-sixth Congress, and was re-elected in 1860 to represent it in the Thirty-seventh Congress. He was a member of the peace conference of 1861 held in Washington, D.C., in an effort to devise means to prevent the impending war. =Civil War= William Vandever by Mathew Brady In 1861, Vandever was mustered into the Union Army as colonel of the 9th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment. He commanded the 2nd Brigade in Eugene A. Carr's 4th Division at the battle of Pea Ridge. He was promoted to brigadier general of Volunteers on November 29, 1862 and sent to command a brigade in the XIII Corps of the Army of the Tennessee. He returned to the Trans-Mississippi Theater to command the 2nd Division in the Army of the Frontier at the Battle of Chalk Bluff. He reverted to brigade command under Francis J. Herron during the siege of Vicksburg. He returned to Iowa as a recruiting officer in January 1864. He joined up with William T. Sherman's army in command of the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, XVI Corps and fought at the battles of Kennesaw Mountain, Atlanta and Ezra Church. He commanded the Post of Marietta during the fall of 1864 then rejoined Sherman's army in command of the 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, XIV Corps and fought at the battle of Bentonville. He was brevetted to major general in 1865. Although his official congressional biography states that Vandever only served in Congress until September 24, 1861 (early in his second term), he never resigned his seat. Iowa's only other congressional seat (in the First District) was vacant from August 4 to October 8, 1861 because Representative Samuel Curtis had resigned his seat after receiving command of the 2nd Iowa Infantry, so for a time Iowa was effectively unrepresented in the U.S. House. In May 1862, Democratic Congressman George H. Browne of Rhode Island raised a challenge to the constitutionality of Vandever holding a military commission and commanding a regiment while remaining a member of Congress, but consideration by the House on that issue was deferred until December 1862.\\"House of Representatives,\\" New York Times, 1862-05-09 at p. 5. On March 4, 1863, the day after Vandever's second House term ended, his appointment as a brigadier general was confirmed by the Senate.\\"The New Generals,\\" New York Times, 1863-04-05 at p. 5. = Later life = He resumed the practice of law in Dubuque and was appointed United States Indian inspector by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1873, and served until 1877. Vandever moved to San Buenaventura, California in 1884. He was elected as a Republican to represent California's 6th congressional district in the House in the Fiftieth and Fifty-first Congresses (March 4, 1887 - March 3, 1891). At the time, the Sixth District included more than half of the area of the state, extending from San Diego County to Mono County. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1890. He died in Ventura, California, in 1893 and was buried in Ventura Cemetery.

It was replaced in 1961 by Tallahassee Regional Airport (now Tallahassee International Airport) and the land is now the campus of Tallahassee Community College. Some of the runways are used for parking.  History  = Origins = In 1928 the City of Tallahassee purchased a tract of land for $7028 for its first municipal airport. The land was previously a dairy farm operated (1910-1928) by Ervin Bostick Revell and Theodore B. Revell. Once the city purchased it, it was named Dale Mabry Field in honor of Tallahassee native Army Captain Dale Mabry, killed in 1922 while commanding the Army semi-rigid airship Roma on February 21, 1922, which crashed at Norfolk, Virginia. The airfield had one grass runway. The airport was dedicated on November 11, 1929, with its first manager being Ivan Munroe. Munroe was part owner and eventually full owner of Tallahassee's first airplane and was a flight instructor. Munroe also formed the Tallahassee Aircraft Company with Jeff Lewis, Frank Lewis and Dick Weeks after serving as a Navy pilot in the Jacksonville area during World War II. The company offered flight training, aerial photography and charter service. Atlantic Gulf Coast Airlines began flights at the airport during its first month. By 1934 the airport had 4 sod runways with the longest at . (Department of Commerce Airport Directory, 1934). In 1937 Dale Mabry Field had two paved runways with a single hangar at the northwest corner of the field. In 1938 Eastern Airlines began flying to Memphis, Birmingham, and Montgomery, Alabama. National Airlines began service to Jacksonville, Pensacola, Mobile and New Orleans that year. The manager was listed as Ivan Munroe. =World War II= In 1940 U.S. Senator Claude Pepper and Florida Governor Spessard Holland influenced the Army to make Dale Mabry Field a United States Army Air Forces airfield. In October 1940 military activity began with the construction of a railroad siding and drainage improvements to overcome the swamp conditions. Hundreds of laborers began clearing swampland for temporary quarters for Dale Mabry Army Air Base. The need to train pilots prompted the federal government to set a 90-day completion deadline. It was used as a fighter training base by III Fighter Command, Third Air Force during the war. In 1945 it was assigned a work detachment of some 126 German prisoners of war as an annex of Camp Gordon Johnston, a larger regional prison camp. Eastern Airlines and National Airlines continued to use Mabry, but like other civil airports, Mabry was closed to general aviation during World War II. The air base was deactivated in 1945. =Postwar use= After the war, the barracks on the field were used by male students (mostly veterans) attending the Florida State College for Women under a program called the \\"Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida\\" (TBUF). In 1947 the Florida State College for Women became the coeducational Florida State University. The TBUF program was then discontinued. The areas of Dale Mabry Field used by these students were called \\"West Campus\\". The airport was the airline airport for Tallahassee in the 1940s and 1950s, but the encroachment of the urban area led to the need for a new airport. Tallahassee Regional Airport opened in 1961, and Dale Mabry Field was closed. Tallahassee Community College The land was redeveloped in the 1960s into the campus of Tallahassee Community College. The airport was at what is now Appleyard Drive and W. Pensacola Street. The north-south runway is clearly visible, and part of it is used for parking.

It is a medium-sized parrot endemic to New Caledonia. It is called \\"horned\\" because it has two black feathers that protrude from the head and have red tips.  Description Adult birds usually measure approximately 32 cm (or about 14 inches) in length, including the tail. Like many parrots, the horned parakeet is primarily green in color. This parrot has a yellowish nape with a black and red face and bluish wings and tail. Its most striking feature is a two-feather black crest, with the crest feathers tipped in red. =Social ecology= It preferentially selects rainforest and laurel forest habitat, but will accept scrublands or savannah. It lives in humid pine forests on New Caledonia, especially when Agathis and Araucaria pines are present. Small family groups, or pairs, will forage in the canopy for their diet of nuts and seeds. It makes a nasal \\"kho-khoot\\" contact call, and also makes a wide range of shrieks and chuckles. Horned parakeets will nest either on or near the ground, and also in hollowed-out logs, or nest hollows in dead trees. Uncommon among parrots, horned parakeets have been reported nest-sharing. The number of eggs laid is usually 2‚Äì4. Incubation lasts 21‚Äì22 days (in captivity) and the time from hatching to fledging is approximately 5 to 6 weeks (again, in captivity).  Threats  This bird has declined since the 1880s, but it is still found in some range on New Caledonia and recent population estimates believe that there are over 5000 birds left. Main threats to the horned parakeet are the black rat, the wildcat, the introduced Rusa deer, logging, La Nina (wet) years, and Psittacine beak and feather disease, a severe virus which is known to affect ~42 species of parrots. Humans poaching the birds for local trade is rare, because the birds' nests are difficult to find, and more importantly, there are no ingrained local customs regarding keeping birds as pets.  Legal status  The horned parakeet is listed by the IUCN as Vulnerable, due to their restricted range and small, declining population size. These parrots are listed as CITES I as of year 2000, meaning all international commerce regarding the species is prohibited. In 2014, the European Union listed the species as Annex A, which means all intra-EU trade is prohibited. The parrots are also fully protected under New Caledonian law.  Taxonomy  In 1998, it was found through DNA studies that Eunymphicus cornutus, the horned parakeet, and Eunymphicus uvaeensis, the Ouvea parakeet, were two separate species.

Etymology The scientific name Aristolochia was developed from Ancient Greek aristos (Œ¨œÅŒπœÉœÑŒøœÇ) \\"best\\" + locheia (ŒªŒøœáŒµŒØŒ±), \\"childbirth\\" or \\"childbed\\", as in ancient times the plant was thought to be effective against infections caused by childbirth. The species Latin name littoralis means ‚Äúcoastal‚Äù. Description Aristolochia littoralis is a climbing vine that can reach about in length. The slender stems are woody and the leaves are bright green, cordate, amplexicaul, long and wide, forming a dense attractive foliage. Flowers are heart-shaped, greenish yellow with intricate purplish-brown markings. These unusual flowers are about long, grow solitary in the leaf axils and resemble Sherlock Holmes's pipe (hence the common name of \\"Dutchman's pipe\\"). The inner surface of the flared mouth is completely purplish-brown. The flowering period extends through all summer. These plants are pollinated by flies which are attracted by the unpleasant carrion-like odor produced by the flowers. The numerous winged seeds are borne in dry dehiscent capsules that split like small parachutes. As the seeds are winged they are easily dispersed by wind. Plants in the related genus Pararistolochia differ by having fleshy moist fruit that do not split. This plant contains aristolochic acid, a toxic alkaloid. Distribution The vining plant is native to southern and western South America. It is found in: *Brazil in Ceara, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Parana, Rio de Janeiro, Rondonia, Santa Catarina, and S√£o Paulo states. *Argentina in Corrientes, Entre Rios, Jujuy, Misiones, and Santa Fe Provinces. *Paraguay in Amambay, Central, Concepcion, Cordillera, Paraguari, and San Pedro Departments. *Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. It is an invasive species in Australia and in the southern United States. In Australia it is fatal to the caterpillars of two butterflies, the Cairns birdwing (Ornithoptera euphorion) and of the threatened Richmond birdwing (O. richmondia), and threatens to displace their proper host plant, A. tagala. Habitat Aristolochia littoralis prefers acid-neutral soils (pH 5.5 ‚Äì 7.0) and average moisture, in part sun to shade, at an elevation of about Cultivation This subtropical plant requires a minimum temperature of 7 ¬∞C, and in temperate regions is grown under glass. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Jean Pierre-Bloch photographed in 1986 by Olivier Meyer Biography =Socialism and resistance= Jean Pierre-Bloch was the son of an industrialist and received a law degree from the Sorbonne. He joined the SFIO at the end of the 1920s and became a journalist for Populaire, the daily newspaper of the socialist party. His political career began in 1934, when he was elected general councilor for the Aisne d√©partement (a post he would hold until 1967). He shored up his local base by becoming adjunct to the mayor of Laon the following year. In 1936 he became, with the victory of the Popular Front, the youngest deputy in the French National Assembly. In 1938, Jean Pierre-Bloch was one of few parliamentarians to oppose the Munich Agreement. As a Jew, he was particularly concerned by the fate in store for the Jews of Adolf Hitler's Germany. Having enlisted voluntarily in 1939, he was made prisoner on 23 June 1940. While in prison he re-arranged the hyphen in his name. He escaped, joined the internal Resistance in Dordogne and helped arrange (along with his wife Gaby Pierre-Bloch (d. 1996)) some of the first parachute drops into France of agents, arms and equipment sent by de Gaulle's headquarters in London. Again arrested with his wife (in Marseille) and imprisoned in October 1941 on treason charges, he escaped along with a dozen others in July 1942 courtesy of American Virginia Hall's organization and saws, keys, and money his wife (released after three months) had hidden in parcels she sent him. He then joined General de Gaulle in London, heading the civilian section of the central bureau of intelligence and action (BCRA or secret services of Free France) from 1942 to 1943. In this capacity he saw the names of all resistants. He was thus a key witness at Maurice Papon's trial, at which he participated at the age of 93. In 1943, Jean Pierre-Bloch became assistant commissioner at the Free French Ministry of the Interior. In this function, he secured the re-establishment of the Cr√©mieux decree of 1871, which had naturalized Algerian Jews as French citizens and which the Vichy regime had abrogated. He vainly proposed a similar legislative text for Muslim Algerians. = A Resistant critical of de Gaulle = An avid follower of General De Gaulle during the war, he nevertheless denounced, in De Gaulle or the Time of Contempts, the presence within the General's entourage, at least in 1942, of royalists or people closely linked to extreme-right pre-war leagues (Claude Hettier de Boislambert, admirer of Cagoule; colonel Pierre Fourcade, former member of this organization; Pierre Guillain de B√©nouville, former member of Action Fran√ßaise, instigators of the events of 6 February 1934; the General's nephew, Michel Cailliau). According to Jean Pierre-Bloch the alignment of General de Gaulle with the Republican cause was purely tactical and the Resistance had been usurped by de Gaulle. In Pierre-Bloch's view the Gaullists held a distorted view of the resistance, presenting themselves as the only great force of the Resistance, along with the Communists, forgetting the Socialists and Christian Democrats. In 1945, Jean Pierre-Bloch easily regained his seat in parliament, favoring an alliance with the French Communist Party and supporting Maurice Thorez as prime minister the following year. He resigned in 1947 in order to direct (until 1953) the SNEP, a society charged with liquidating the assets of collaborationist newspapers outlawed after the Liberation. He was a juror at the trial of Philippe P√©tain. Meanwhile, he headed the commission of the National Assembly for the coordination of Muslim affairs. In this capacity, he tried to ameliorate the lot of Algerians and participated in the preparation of the statute of 1947, which was not applied. In the 1950s and 1960s, he participated in the peace movement. In 1956 and 1967, he failed to win back his parliamentary seat. He supported de Gaulle's return to power in 1958. =Anti-racism activity= Jean Pierre-Bloch was also a director of the International League against Anti-Semitism (LICA): he was a member of the executive committee from 1937 to 1968 and then president of the International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism (LICRA) for 24 years, from 1968 to 1992, and finally honorary president from 1992 to his death. He became president of LICA after the death of its founder Bernard Lecache and directed its journal, The Right to Live. It was at his urging that mention of the fight against racism was added to the name of LICA, which became LICRA in 1979. His activism had begun in 1934, when he investigated the pogroms committed at Constantine, Algeria. From 1987 to 1989, he presided over the Consultative Commission on Human Rights by the side of the Prime Minister. =Family= Pierre-Bloch had three children with Gabrielle Sadourny: Mich√®le, Claude Pierre-Bloch, former producer and political adviser and Jean-Pierre Pierre-Bloch, former deputy (UDF-PSD) for Paris and municipal councilor (DL) in the 18th arrondissement. His grandson, David Pierre-Bloch, is a producer and a Nouveau Centre party's member. =Awards= * Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour * Knight of the Order of Academic Palms * Commander of the Order of Public Health * 1939 War Cross 6 citations * Resistance Medal with rosette * Cross of the resistance volunteer combatant * Escapees' Medal * Medal of the Supreme Soviet * Volunteer combatant's cross * Grand Officer of the National Order of Benin * Medal of a liberated France * Grand Cordon of the Order \\"Nicham Ephticar\\" * Silver-gilt Honour Medal of the Local Collectivities * Cross of Valor (Poland) * Plaque from the Millennium of the city of Paris In March 2003, rue Alexis Carrel in Paris was rechristened with Jean Pierre-Bloch's name.

He was born on June 5, 1883 in Bethel, Maine, and died in 1981 in Riverside, California, where he had served as an Associate Entomologist in the Department of Entomology of the University of California, Riverside. He obtained an A.B. degree in 1908 in Liberal Arts from Bowdoin College with a major in Greek and Latin. In 1910 he received an A.M. degree in Biology from Harvard University. From 1909-1914, Timberlake was employed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Bureau of Entomology, as ‚ÄúAgent and Expert‚Äù conducting research in biological control of pest insects. From 1914-1924 he was Associate Entomologist at the Hawaiian Sugar Planters Experiment Station in Honolulu, where his research dealt primarily with biological control using parasites and predators. In 1924 he was appointed Associate Entomologist in the Department of Biological Control at the Citrus Experiment Station of the University of California, Riverside, where he served until retirement in 1950. He continued his regular work schedule afterwards, but his eyesight slowly failed in later years and in 1980, at age 97 years, it reached the point where he could no longer continue his work. The appointment of Timberlake in the Department of Biological Control in 1924 was motivated by his extensive knowledge of the taxonomy of parasitic Hymenoptera and of predaceous ladybird beetles, groups of importance in biological control of pest insects. However, by the late 1920s and thereafter, he focused almost entirely upon the taxonomy of native bees, especially the genus Perdita. There are over 800 species of Perdita, most described by Timberlake, but also by T.D.A. Cockerell. They are almost all specialist pollinators (oligoleges) of many species of plants, especially in the Sonoran desert, where Timberlake carried out extensive collecting for decades. He described and named about 800 species of bees in total over his career, and several other species in other insect groups. He published over 100 scientific papers, mostly on bees, in addition to 8 volumes on the genus Perdita alone. His colleagues and former students throughout the world have described over 50 new species of insects, named timberlakei as patronyms in his honor. His insect collection contained about 500,000 specimens of which about 150,000 were Hymenoptera, including what was once the largest bee collection in North America, and this served as the foundation for the collection now housed in the University of California's Entomology Research Museum, containing some 4 million total specimens. He married his wife, Edith Timberlake, in 1917 in Honolulu, and they had three children. Edith was the sister of Hannah Milhous Nixon and an aunt of former President Richard M. Nixon, whose law school career she helped finance. She and the elderly scientist attended Nixon's Presidential inauguration at his invitation, and she died a few years later, in 1972. 1883 births 1981 deaths American entomologists Hymenopterists Bowdoin College alumni Harvard University alumni University of California, Riverside faculty 20th-century zoologists ","title":"Philip Hunter Timberlake"},{"id":"5721119","text":"Milton Bernard Thompson (born January 5, 1959), is an American former professional baseball outfielder, pinch hitter, and coach, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Colorado Rockies. He returned as the Cincinnati Reds‚Äô minor league hitting instructor, for the season. Over Thompson‚Äôs MLB career, he compiled a batting average of .274. Major league career Thompson's pro baseball career began, when the Atlanta Braves drafted him in the 2nd round (29th overall) of the 1979 draft out of Howard University. There, he made his big league debut, five years later, in .Thompson, Milt Baseball Library After two years in Atlanta, as a part-time left fielder, the Braves traded Thompson, along with Steve Bedrosian, to the Phillies, for Ozzie Virgil and Pete Smith. Thompson continued to impress, batting .251, .302, and .288, respectively, in his three seasons in Philadelphia. On December 16, 1988, Thompson was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals, for Steve Lake and Curt Ford, where he spent four years and posted his highest batting average ever, .307, in . Following the season, Thompson was granted free agency and elected to return to the Phillies. As a key component in the Phillies‚Äô unexpected, last-to-first 1993 National League Championship team, Thompson platooned in left field with Pete Incaviglia, in the World Series, against the Toronto Blue Jays. He remained an ever-popular fan-favorite, while having another stellar season. Perhaps Thompson‚Äôs greatest MLB performance came on April 29, 1993. That day, the Phillies left fielder really ‚Äúbrought his ‚ÄòA‚Äô Game‚Äù to the San Diego Padres‚Äô Jack Murphy Stadium. He had already gone 3-for-4 at the plate (3 singles), with 2 runs batted in (RBI), and one run scored. Then, crowning his day ‚Äî and quite possibly his big league career: With the game on the line and the Phillies ahead 5-3, in the bottom of the eighth inning and two out, the Padres had the bases loaded, bringing their slugging right-handed catcher, Bob Geren, to the plate. David West, the Phillies‚Äô left-handed relief pitcher, delivered a choice fastball that took a long ride, sailing over from home plate, and above the wall in left-center field. The fleet-footed Thompson arrived just in time, planted his feet, and made a surreal leap ‚Äî seemingly sensing in some sort of inexact prayer, where the ball was ‚Äî and cradled it into his glove‚Äôs web, retiring the side and preserving another Phillies win, in that magical 1993 season, high- fiving center fielder Lenny Dykstra all the way to the visiting dugout. On July 31, 1994, Thompson was traded by Philadelphia, to the Houston Astros, for pitcher Tom Edens. Again, following the season, Thompson was granted free agency, after being with the Astros for only a short time. As a free agent, he elected to re-sign with Houston, for another year. After the season, Thompson was again a free agent, and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers; on June 27, 1996, he was selected off waivers by the Colorado Rockies. His career with the Rockies lasted just over 5 weeks, as Thompson received his unconditional release on August 2, 1996, thus ending his big league playing career. Coaching In 1997, Thompson became the minor league outfield/base-running coordinator in the Tampa Bay Devil Rays organization. In 1998, he joined the Phillies as a minor league coach. Thompson lasted there for two seasons, until taking 2000 off, then returned as a minor league base-running/outfield coordinator, again in the Phillies farm system. In 2004, Thompson joined the major league Phillies staff as first base coach. The next year, he became the team‚Äôs hitting coach, where he remained for five-plus seasons. During Thompson's tenure as batting coach, the Phillies have led the league twice in runs scored, even though they have alternated between only 2nd and 3rd place in their respective division due to pitching difficulties. He was one of the few coaches not fired by the organization in 2005. As the hitting coach of the 2008 World Champion Philadelphia Phillies, Thompson earned the first World Series ring of his long career in baseball. He would return to the World Series in 2009, where the Phillies lost to the New York Yankees, in six games. Having played for the 1993 National League Champions, Thompson joined Larry Bowa and John Vukovich as the only Phillies in franchise history to go to the World Series as both a player and coach for the club. On Thursday, July 22, 2010, Thompson was relieved of his duties as the Phillies‚Äô hitting coach, being replaced by former Minor League hitting coach Greg Gross. Thompson was hired by the Astros that November, as their minor league outfield/base-running coordinator. He became a coach for the Kansas City Royals‚Äô Class A affiliate, the Wilmington Blue Rocks, in . Thompson joined the Reds organization, as a minor league hitting instructor, in . Personal life Thompson has four daughters. He resides in Washington Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey with his family.

He was assassinated by a Klansman for advocating civil rights for former slaves. Born and raised in a small town in upstate New York, Hinds went west at the age of nineteen and graduated in 1856 from the Cincinnati Law School in Cincinnati, Ohio. He settled in Minnesota, where he opened a private law practice and was elected district attorney of his county. Looking for a fresh start, Hinds moved to the capital city of Little Rock, Arkansas in 1865. In 1867, he was elected to represent Pulaski County as a Republican at the Arkansas Constitutional Convention tasked with rewriting the constitution to allow Arkansas' readmission to the Union following its secession and the American Civil War. At that convention, Hinds successfully advocated for constitutional provisions establishing the right to vote for adult freedmen and public education for both black and white children. Campaigning for Republican candidate Ulysses S. Grant in the 1868 presidential election, Hinds was threatened and targeted by the Ku Klux Klan. In October 1868, while travelling to a political meeting with Joseph Brooks in Monroe County, Hinds was shot to death by a Klansman. Early life Hinds was born in East Hebron, New York, to Charles and Jane Hinds. The youngest of six children, his brother Henry also became an attorney. Hinds' other siblings were brothers William, John, and Calvin, and his sister, Jane.Darrow 2015, p. 18. He attended high school at Washington Academy in Salem, New York, and college at the Albany Normal School (now University at Albany, SUNY). Hinds read law at a school in St. Louis, Missouri, before graduating from Cincinnati Law School four years after his brother Henry did so.Stevens 1904, p. 188. Career =Minnesota= In 1856, at the age of twenty-three, Hinds moved to the Minnesota Territory and settled in St. Peter, the county seat of Nicollet County west of his brother Henry in Shakopee, Minnesota. During this time, there was discussion of moving the Minnesota territorial capital from St. Paul to St. Peter. Hinds purchased several lots and opened a law practice. A bill was sent to the Governor from the Legislature to make St. Peter the capital of the future state, but an adversary hid the bill until the end of the legislative session. As a result, the capital became St. Paul. Shortly after opening a law practice, James Hinds was elected district attorney for the county.Darrow 2015, p. 19. Hinds was building a career and starting a family in St. Peter during a turbulent time in the region because of conflict between settlers and homesteaders and the Dakota Sioux, culminating in the Dakota War of 1862. He enlisted as a private in the First Minnesota Cavalry's Mounted Rangers, Company E during the conflict.Darrow 2015, pp. 20-21. By 1865, Hinds realized that St. Peter would not grow to political prominence and would remain a small farming village. Seeking a fresh start and more opportunity, in mid-1865 he relocated with his wife and two young daughters to Little Rock, Arkansas, in the throes of Reconstruction. =Arkansas= Upon reaching Arkansas, one of the eleven states of the former Confederacy, Hinds found a state heavily degraded by the Civil War. By 1865, fighting between Confederate and Union forces had ravaged the state: population declined, millions of dollars of property was lost to burning or stealing, and the antebellum labor system (slavery) was gone. Plantations, the source of most state tax revenues, lacked the slave labor which had sustained them, throwing once-powerful planters (plantation owners) into financial uncertainty. As Arkansas struggled with the new status quo, it also struggled to establish a new labor system. As with many Northerners, Hinds did not understand the grip of white supremacy, and resentment toward freedmen and Northerners, in the South at the time. He believed that in the wake of the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation and the Civil War, freedmen in the South should enjoy the same liberties as in the North, and underestimated continuing fierce resistance from Democrat whites. These sentiments were later eulogized by Logan H. Roots, a contemporary who represented Arkansas in Congress. Measures to block freedmen from voting and racial violence demonstrated that many in the state did not accept civil rights for freedmen. Hinds found himself referred to as a carpetbagger, a pejorative term used by conservative Southerners to disparage Northerners who moved south during Reconstruction. In mid-1865 in Little Rock, Hinds formed a law practice with Elisha Baxter, one of the state's leading Unionists. Baxter, who fought with the Union Army during the war, would be selected to serve on to the Arkansas Supreme Court by the newly established government and was later governor of Arkansas. In October 1867, Hinds was elected to be a delegate at Arkansas's 1868 Constitution Convention. At that Convention he was made chairman of the Committee on the Elective Franchise. The new constitution that emerged that February, ratified in March, provided voting rights for black males over the age of twenty-one and for the creation of public schools for both black and white children. Elected to Congress early that year, Hinds went to Washington D.C. in April, 1868, where he arranged for Arkansas to be the first state to rejoin the union under the 1867 Reconstruction Acts. In May 1868, Hinds was a delegate at the 1868 Republican National Convention held in Chicago. Returning to Arkansas in August, he campaigned vigorously for Republican presidential candidate Grant, and for civil rights for former slaves. Assassination Hinds was the first U.S. Congressman assassinated in office. He was murdered on the eve of the 1868 presidential election, which was a contest over civil rights and suffrage for freedmen. Republicans, led by former Union Army General Ulysses S. Grant, favored those measures, while the Democratic Party opposed them. On October 22, 1868, en route to a campaign event for Grant near the village of Indian Bay in Monroe County, Hinds and fellow Republican politician Joseph Brooks were shot. Brooks managed to stay on his horse and ride to the event to bring back assistance. Hinds was knocked off his horse by the shotgun blast to his back, and lay on the road until help arrived. Before he died, Hinds sent a message to his wife and identified his killer. He died about two hours after the attack. A Coroner's Inquest identified the shooter as George Clark, secretary of the Monroe County Democratic Party and a local Klansman. Clark was never arrested or prosecuted. A week after the attack, The Morning Republican newspaper published the story, recounting that \\"Men passing and returning soon found Mr. Hinds lying in the road still alive and rational, but conscious of the fact that his wound was of such serious nature that but a few moments more remained of his earthly career.\\" Governor Powell Clayton feared that the murder of Hinds, coming amid rising violence against Republicans and freed people, was a precursor to a general attack on state officers to seize control of the government and the polls prior to the election, but the insurrection did not take place. Hinds is interred at Evergreen Cemetery in Salem, New York. The Congressional Cemetery in Washington D.C. contains a memorial stone in his honor.

Kulvietis was born in Kulva, now in the Jonava district of Lithuania, into an old Lithuanian noble family of middle wealth. Between 1528 and 1537 he studied in many universities across Europe. At first in Cracow Academy, later, as he became aware of humanist reforms, he moved to the Catholic University of Leuven, where he studied the works of Desiderius Erasmus. He continued his education in Wittenberg, where he studied Martin Luther's teachings. In 1536 he moved to Leipzig and finally Siena, where in 1537 he was granted the title Doctor of Law. After receiving his title, Kulvietis returned to the Great Duchy of Lithuania, giving lectures in Vilnius and working under the protection of Queen Bona Sforza and King of Poland and Grand Duke Sigismund II Augustus.

Plot summary In the opening scene, a civil servant named Ivan Kuzmich Podkolyosin sits alone in his room smoking a pipe and contemplating marriage. He has hired a matchmaker (Fyokla Ivanovna), as was the custom in Russia at the time, to help find him a bride. As the two converse, the audience discovers that Podkolyosin has been in search of a bride for quite some time. The reason for his not being yet married, however, owes to his own indecisiveness rather than the lack of a suitable partner. In fact, Fyokla has found him a nice young woman named Agafya Tikhonovna. When Podkolyosin's friend Kochkaryov unexpectedly pays a visit and finds Fyokla at Podkolyosin's home, he learns for the first time of his friend's search for a bride. The fact that Podkolyosin has not mentioned it to his friend provides further proof of his indecision. Kochkaryov becomes outraged at Fyokla because she also married him, and his wife and he are unhappy with the marriage. Kochkaryov, after cleverly getting Fyokla to reveal the location of Agafya's home, informs Fyokla that her services are no longer needed and that he will proceed with the matter on his own. In the next scene, Agafya and her aunt, Arina, discuss the issue of marriage and the matchmaker walks in on them. She informs the two women that several suitors will soon be making appearances at the home. Presumably, Fyokla has just made the rounds of the town in hopes of beating out Kochkaryov and Podkolyosin, as she will not receive any money if the marriage should occur without her help. Besides Kochkaryov and Podkolyosin, three suitors arrive. The first is Yaichnitsa (which can mean either 'fried eggs' or 'omelet'). Yaichnitsa is overly concerned with the dowry and appears skeptical as to whether Fyokla has told him the truth about it. The second suitor, Anuchkin is a man of refinement and wants a bride who speaks French, a language fashionable among the upper classes, even though he doesn't speak the language himself. The third, Zhevakin, a retired navy lieutenant, has a detailed story about the time his squadron spent in Sicily, where, amazingly enough, no one speaks Russian. He is often mesmerized by female beauty. At this point, Podkolyosin and Kochkaryov arrive and everyone sits down to chat. Yaichnitsa almost immediately demands that Agafya make a decision, which makes her so uncomfortable that she leaves the room. All of the suitors wonder what happened. Once they are alone Kochkaryov tries to scare off the other suitors by calling Agafya ugly, unable to speak French and her dowry worthless. Kochkaryov later pays Agafya a visit in her room and convinces her to choose Podkolyosin over the others (she herself was indecisive about who she liked best). The other suitors all come back and Agafya and Kochkaryov together tell them off until only Podkolyosin remains. After a great deal of pushing on the part of Kochkaryov, the two become engaged. Actually, Kochkaryov had to propose because Podkolyosin was still indecisive and wanted to wait another month before proposing. Kochkaryov insists that the wedding must take place immediately as he has already ordered all of the food and the guests are waiting at the church. The bride and groom begin to get dressed and Podkolyosin muses to himself about the splendor of marriage. However, he soon changes his mind again and jumps out the window. After only a short while, Agafya wonders where he has gone. Everyone searches for him, and eventually they discover that he has escaped through the window and called a cab to take him home. The play ends with Fyokla scolding Kochkaryov for his sub-par matchmaking skills. If the grooms escapes through the door the wedding can still be put back on track, she says, but if he jumps out the window it is all over.

Built as a war memorial in 1909 for the university's fallen alumni from the Civil War, Alumni Memorial Hall originally housed U-M's Alumni office along with the university's growing art collection. Its first director was Jean Paul Slusser, who served from 1946 (first as acting director, then becoming director in 1947) to his retirement in 1957. UMMA contains a comprehensive collection that represents more than 150 years at the university, with over 20,000 works of art that span cultures, eras, and media. Admission is free, but a $10 donation is suggested. In the spring of 2009, the museum reopened after a major $41.9 million expansion and renovation designed by Brad Cloepfil and Allied Works Architecture, which more than doubled the size of the museum. The museum comprises the renovated Alumni Memorial Hall with and the new Maxine and Stuart Frankel and the Frankel Family Wing. The museum's current director is Christina Olsen, who was appointed in 2017.  Construction  Alumni Memorial Hall, first floor blueprint Alumni Memorial Hall was originally conceived in 1864 as a way to honor the University of Michigan students, faculty, and alumni who had died fighting in the Civil War. However, the project was put on hold until 1904, when a committee of Michigan alumni and professors, led by Professor Martin Luther D'Ooge and Judge Claudius B. Grant, secured a promissory note from the Board of Regents for the land the hall would eventually be built on. 310x310px With the land set aside, the Board of Regents created a committee to work in parallel with the Alumni Memorial Committee in 1905, and by the end of the year had awarded the project to the Detroit architecture firm Donaldson and Meier at the cost of $175,000. The hall's cornerstone was laid by Judge Grant and construction began in June 1908. Alumni Memorial Hall was dedicated on May 11, 1910, with a final building cost of $190,000. The hall itself was built in the neoclassical tradition with a pair of two stone columns flanking the hall's main bronze doors with two smaller side doors. The inside continues to house the Alumni Association's headquarters and the university's vast art collection alongside pieces donated by alumni, including a bust of the university's first president Henry Philip Tappan. It also housed the University Club, before the club moved across the street to the Union.

In life these were probably covered with skin, much like the ossicones of a giraffe. Protoceras was sexually dimorphic - females only had one pair of horns, on the back of the skull, which was shorter than the same pair in males. Males probably used these horns for display, impressing females and/or intimidating rivals. Due to the orientation of the horns the males probably displayed them sideways instead of frontally. Protoceras was one of the earliest and most primitive protoceratids, still possessing upper incisors and four functional toes (later genera had only two functional, hooved toes).

Ellis was a referee in The Football Association competitions and in FIFA international competitions. He refereed at the 1950, 1954 and 1958 World Cups; running the line in the 1950 FIFA World Cup Final and Third Place Play-off in 1958 and refereeing the Third Place Play-off in 1954. Refereeing career Ellis is most remembered for refereeing the notorious 1954 Battle of Berne and the first leg of the 1960-61 second round tie in the European Cup between Real Madrid and FC Barcelona. In the closing minutes of that match Ellis waved down a flag as Sandor Kocsis strode into the Madrid penalty area, and awarded a penalty when the Hungarian was fouled. The resulting score equalised the tie. Ellis also journeyed with the English touring side in Argentina in the Summer of 1953. He was the referee in charge of the abandoned game in Buenos Aires against Argentina on 17 May when it rained so much that he called the players off the field after 23 minutes. This tour began, three days before, with the representative match in the River Plate stadium. Ellis had been bitten by a mosquito and been told he could not officiate but he refused to follow the medical advice and was later dubbed 'the yellow rat' by some of the English players for his performance.'England v Argentina: World Cups and other Wars', (ed. Downing) p. 63) An Argentinian side San Lorenzo were the opponents during the abandoned game at Highfield Road, against Coventry City in January 1956. In the first half, after awarding a penalty, Ellis was kicked by Jose Sanfilippo and abandoned the game when the player refused to walk from the field of play. \\"Those people\\", Ellis wrote, \\"must learn sportsmanship and we must teach them. South Americans are more excitable and more passionate than we are. They do crazy things, impulsively, then a few minutes later they are genuinely and deeply sorry\\".Downing =1955‚Äì56 European Cup= Ellis' role in the first European Cup competition was extensive, refereeing those matches played by Hibernian from the second round until the semi-final before being selected for the Final in Parc des Princes, Paris.European Champions' Cup 1955-56 - Details, RSSSF. Ellis had been informed that he would need to provide the linesmen for the European Cup match against Rot-Weiss Essen. He wrote: \\"I managed to obtain the services of Jimmy Catlin (Rochdale) and Frank Ellis, then on the Yorkshire League and now a Football League linesman. He is my younger brother. We officiated first at the first leg and, at the request of UEFA, the same three - with Frank Ellis of the Yorkshire League still included! - were again appointed to take the second round (both legs) between Hibernian and the Swedish champions. We also acted in the second leg of the semi-final involving Hibernian and the fine French team Rheims. \\"I was chosen to referee the first-ever Final of this new competition ... Just when I thought that the linesmen ... would be there once more, the Football Association stepped in and said it would soon be regarded by others as a closed shop. Despite the request of Rheims for an 'unchanged team', I was given two linesmen this time - Messrs. J. Parkinson, of Blackburn, and Tommy Cooper, of Bolton.\\" The Final Whistle, 1962, ed. Ellis, pp. 94‚Äì5 Later life Ellis became well known in the UK for acting as a referee in the gameshow It's a Knockout, where his dipstick became internationally recognised. He also featured as a pools panellist under Lord Brabazon.Almanack: Pools panel draw a veil, The Independent, 27 March 1994. Ellis died of prostate cancer in 1999 aged 84.

In the latter part of his career he was a senior television executive with production company TWI, who produce coverage of Premier League football, international golf and tennis among other sports. He left this role in 2007. Londoner Harrison played football to what he describes as a decent level on his way to becoming a news reporter with the Daily Express. He switched to broadcasting in 1967 with BBC Radio Merseyside, taking up football commentary duties along the way. Harrison entered the BBC's Find a Commentator competition in 1969. Despite making the final six he lost out on the prize of a working trip to the 1970 FIFA World Cup to Welshman Idwal Robling. However, Harrison was to get the better deal out of it. Partly on the strength of his performance in the competition, he was offered a post as a commentator for Norwich-based Anglia Television. While Robling covered a couple of games in Mexico for the BBC, Harrison worked on the competition as part of ITV's commentary team covering seven matches. It was the first of six World Cups he would cover for ITV. Anglia's staple football programme Match of the Week chronicled a superb spell for Ipswich Town under the guidance of Bobby Robson, as well as the fortunes of Norwich City, Luton Town, Cambridge United, Peterborough United, Colchester United, Southend United and Northampton Town. Harrison worked as presenter and commentator before its eventual demise in 1983. He also covered the first leg of the 1981 UEFA Cup Final, featuring Ipswich, for Anglia and the ITV network. Network responsibilities rarely came Harrison's way outside of the World Cup. He commentated on live matches in 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982 and 1986, and also worked on the 1990 tournament. He was also a regular voice on Football League highlights on both The Big Match and Midweek Sports Special. He freelanced for BSB in its early days - covering the 1990 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Crystal Palace among other matches. He also covered matches for Eurosport, British Aerospace Sportscast and Screensport. In 1985 Harrison took over as Head of Sport at Anglia but left in 1993 frustrated at ITV's inability to maintain rights to top-flight football. He joined TWI as a producer and has worked on many shows including the long-running Futbol Mundial programme. He also occasionally commentates, notably covering the FIFA World Club Championship for international audiences since its inception in 2005. In 2005 Gerry returned to Anglia as a guest on their 50 years of ITV programme. In 2006, he hosted the first edition of Anglia Soccer Night of the season. He has also appeared as a studio guest and was seen regularly hosting Soccer Rewind on Anglia Soccer Night in the 2006/2007 season.

Origin of name Teynham village sign Teynham Street, conservation area surrounded by farmland Charters of 798 to 801 and Domesday Monachorum ‚Äì a series of Domesday-related texts kept at Canterbury Cathedral ‚Äì mention it as Teneham, Taenham, Tenaham and Tenham. In Domesday Book the name occurs as \\"Therham\\" (probably a clerical error). The historian JK Wallenberg (in 1931) suggests an Anglo-Saxon root, tynan, to enclose, followed by the Anglo-Saxon word \\"Hamm\\", a land drained by dykes. Another historian, Eilert Ekwall (in 1936), suggests an early owner named Teona, whose name is found in Teonanhyll in Berkshire. In 1590, William Lambarde wrote his book Perambulation of Kent, in which Tenham is called the towne of ten houses. He also notes that in 1533, 105 acres of good ground in 'Brennet' (a former name of Tenham, were divided in ten parcels of land to grow fruit for King Henry. J Harris, in his History of Kent (1719) calls it the \\"place of ten houses\\" (hams) but there must have been hundreds of places with 10 houses in Anglo-Saxon times. It is also possibly \\"homestead of a man called Tena\\" or \\"homestead near the stream called Tene\\". Several other etymologies have been suggested. The \\"y\\" in \\"Teynham\\" was apparently added by the Roper family, who have been Barons of Teynham from 1616. Geography It is an agricultural parish situated three miles east of Sittingbourne. The southern part of the parish is mainly devoted to agriculture, the principal crops being corn and hops with the produce of some famous orchards. Near the Swale is a large tract of land known as the Teynham Levels. This is devoted solely to the raising of sheep and cattle. At one time these marshes were not properly drained, and malaria was prevalent within the parish. So many residents got the disease that Teynham became known as an unhealthy place. The draining of the marshes eradicated this by 1953, which was carried out under the direction of a Commission formed for the purpose (and who had powers to levy a scot). The disease in the UK threatens a return to the Swale marshes, with dry habitats such as vacant pill boxes allowing over-wintering for vector species, however few carriers frequently come to the area and gradually derelict structures are being removed. History The town is a very ancient place and it is mentioned as having been the town in which Archbishops resided in early times. Kenulf, Coenwulf of Mercia, who reigned 794‚Äì819, gave the place to Christ Church, Canterbury, and afterwards a palace was built in the village or town as it was known then, which no longer exists. Archbishop Baldwin of Forde (1184‚Äì91), Hubert Walter (1193‚Äì1207), Stephen Langton (1207‚Äì29), and Raynold (1313‚Äì28) all in turn lived at Teynham. Archbishop John de Stratford in 1345, entertained King Edward III at Teynham. The church, St Mary's, in Teynham Street towards Conyer is Grade I listed, by the oldest buildings, Hinkley's Mill, Thatched Cottage, The Old Vicarage, Banks' farmhouse and cottage, Teynham Court and Crown House. The church stained glass windows date two centuries after its building, to the 15th century, restored 1873. Later King Henry III granted the town the right to hold a market and fair. Richard Harrys (or Harris ‚Äì in some accounts) who also lived at Teynham, and was a fruiterer to King Henry VIII instructed to plant 105 acres of land with cherries and apples that he had obtained from Flanders,Folkard, Richard (1892) \\"Plant Lore, Legends and Lyrics\\", 2nd edn., Sampson Low, Marston & Company, London. and thus the village is one of the earliest in which the cherry was grown in Kent and England. By 1848, Teynham had a population of 845 people. It was part of the Hundred of Teynham, in the Upper Division of the Lathe of Scray. Most of the village income was made from cherry growing, with some from hops. Its patron was still the Archdeacon of Canterbury. Amenities There are several pubs throughout the parish, some with restaurants and take-aways, there is a substantial primary school with grounds for sports/games and a few shops, and a post office, and has a library on the London Road. The most historic buildings in Teynham Street are almost all relatively near the Saxon Shore Way, marina and wharf in Conyer and consequently the village and Conyer has some guesthouses. Transport The village is accessible off the M2 from the Sittingbourne junction, with the A2 providing short distance motor journeys and an easy cycle route to Sittingbourne and Faversham.

Transport Three separate stations of the Doha Metro's Green Line (also known as the Education Line) serve Education City: the Education City station, the Qatar National Library station, and the Al Shaqab station. All three stations were opened to the public on 10 December 2019. Controversy The American universities which have established campuses in Education City have been the subject of ongoing criticism of whether it is appropriate to maintain a campus in Qatar, given the alleged Qatari links to state-sponsored terrorism, the lack of freedom of speech in the country, and the country's absolute monarchy. In an interview with Gulf News Journal, Herbert London, president of the London Center for Policy Research and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said \\"universities I think have compromised themselves\\" by having campuses in a country like Qatar where academic freedom and freedom of the press are severely limited. Along with other universities with campuses in Qatar, Georgetown has received criticism for accepting money from Qatar due to their support of terrorism worldwide and their abysmal human rights record, especially in the lead up to the 2022 World Cup. Some question if universities who profit from campuses in Qatar are thereby complicit in Qatar's alleged sponsorship of terrorism and human rights abuses. =Academic freedom= In Qatar, the monarchy has absolute authority over all aspects of life, including its strict adherence to Sharia Law. There are also strict censorship laws that at times have spilled over into Education City, despite the country's stated claims that the institutions there have total academic and intellectual freedom. In 2014, Love Comes Later, a book by Mohanalakshmi Rajakumar, English professor for Georgetown University in Qatar, Northwestern University in Qatar, and Virginia Commonwealth University School of the Arts in Qatar, was banned by the State of Qatar with no explanation. Rajakumar has stated that she wrote the book with the Qatari ‚Äúsensibilities of the public culture‚Äù in mind, meaning that the book did not include the main three objections: sex, atheism, and politics. Some art that has been displayed at VCUarts Qatar has had to be taken down as some Qatari students found it to be disrespectful to their culture, an issue that reflects the differences in conservatism and social practices that are present at the Qatari campus. In an article by The Washington Post, Susan Dun, an assistant professor of communication at NU-Q said that some professors do exercise caution with statements, written work, or speeches that may reach a wider audience than just the Education City community. Everette Dennis, the dean of NU-Q, led a six-nation survey in 2015 that was financed by the Qatar National Research Fund and asked questions such as if people think their country is ‚Äúheaded in the right direction‚Äù. While the UAE, Egypt, Tunisia, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia all had answers to the question, there was no data from Qatar as the government blocked the question from being asked to survey participants. =Freedom of speech= Students at Northwestern University in Qatar have said that they face challenges due to the lack of freedom of speech rights protecting the media. Students have been harassed and intimidated when trying to capture images that would be considered routine or not offensive in the U.S. Some faculty members maintain that this teaches students persistence and creativity in overcoming obstacles to report on a story.

Based in Giavera del Montello, Nordica is currently a division of Tecnica Group, after this corporation acquired it from Benetton in 2003. Current range of products include skis, boots, poles, and accessories such as sportswear, gloves, and bags.  History  In 1939, after years of experience as traders in hides, the brothers Adriano and Oddone Vaccari founded ‚ÄúNordica‚Äù in Montebelluna, making casual footwear. In the after-war years Nordica specialised in ski boots, although continuing to supply the market with cross-country ski shoes and climbing boots. Work was still seasonal and the equipment manual. In 1950 Zeno Col√≤ gave his name to a Nordica ski boot and to a revolutionary lining designed by Colmar. Zeno became World Champion with Nordica both in the downhill and the giant slalom of the 1950 World Championships in Aspen, Colorado and gave his name to a ski boot made by the company in Trevignano. The 60‚Äôs saw radical transformations: 1963 marked the introduction of the buckle, a fastening system conceived in Austria and applied for the first time in Italy by Nordica. The great innovation of that year, however, was the all-polyurethane ski boot; specific molds (one for the right boot and one for the left) and injection presses were developed. 1968 was a crucial year with regard to company technical decisions: the leather upper of the traditional models was plastic-coated externally using polyurethane or pvc and the cuff was raised. Nordica set up its first affiliate in the United States, which was the result of an agreement between Nordica and Rossignol. Other affiliates were opened in Austria, Japan, Switzerland, France and Germany. In 1989, the Benetton Group purchased Nordica for US$ 120 million. By the time of the acquisition, Nordica reported sales of US$ 225 million (1,7 million pairs of boots).Benetton sells Nordica back to Tecnica on SNews, 9 Jan 2003 In 2003 the Nordica brand was purchased again by the Tecnica Group,Benetton finalises the deal with Tecnica for the sale of Nordica on Benetton press release, 10 Jan 2003 after sales decreased to US$ 97,5 million on 730,000 pairs of boots plus 100,000 pairs of skis. The new corporate strategy is aimed at the ski sector with particular attention being paid to racing products and to the competition sector. The feeling between some celebrated names in skiing and the Nordica brand is confirmed once again by the great performances in the World Cup and by the recent World Championships in St. Moritz., further confirmation of Nordica competitive spirit and the great desire to be number one again. In 2006 Nordica presents XBI, a fully integrated balance improvement system. In 2009 Nordica celebrated 70 years of performance and passion; an important goal reached thanks to a great international team work, racing and freeski athletes and testman suggestions and of course high quality products that, all over these years, confirmed the high level of Nordica brand.

He made his first on-screen appearance in the show's pilot episode on 18 March 1985. Max was the patriarch of the Ramsay family and Ramsay Street is named after his grandfather. Max lived at number 24 with his wife, Maria (Dasha Bl√°hov√°) and their sons, Shane (Peter O'Brien) and Danny (David Clencie). Max departed on 2 May 1986 after Bell's contract was not renewed. He appeared in 190 episodes.http://perfectblend.net/reference/charactercounts/index.htm Casting In 1985, Neighbours started out with three families created by Watson - the Ramsays, the Robinsons and the Clarkes. Watson said that he wanted to show three families living in a small street, who are friends.Oram, James, p.25 Francis Bell was cast in the role of patriarch Max Ramsay, head of the Ramsay family. In 1986, Bell believed he was not being paid enough for his work and the demands of his character, so the decision was taken not to renew his contract.Oram, James, p.117-8 A back injury also influenced Bell's decision to leave the show. Bell said \\"I was considering resigning before my back problems flared up. Negotiations had been under way between my agent and Grundy's for some time and I had decided I didn't want to do the show any more\\". Characterisation Bell based the character of Max on a person who helped raise him in New Zealand. He said \\"Max is based on a man whom I loved, but who gave me a very hard time\\". The head of the Ramsay family, Max has been described as being \\"almost the father figure of Neighbours\\" in the early days.Wallis, Neil and Hogan, Dave, p. 63-4 He was always proud that Ramsay Street was named after his grandfather.Monroe, Josephine, p.27 He was also described as being \\"essentially a nice guy\\" who can be hard-headed, unmoving and \\"domineering at times\\". Max survives by dominating situations and he approves of those who comply. Storylines Max is a loud, uncouth plumber. He has a fractious family life and frequently argues with his wife Maria, and he is disappointed in his sensitive son Danny. Max has a better relationship with his older, more athletic son Shane. Max is a longtime rival of neighbour Jim Robinson. Max's family life is plunged into turmoil when he learns he is not Danny's father. Danny was actually the product of Maria's extra-marital affair. The marriage collapses and Max moves out of the family home, sharing a cramped flat with son Shane. His wife Maria has an affair with Richard Morrison, an insurance investigator, in mid 1985. Maria bids Richard farewell when he is transferred to work in Hong Kong. At the last minute Maria leaves Erinsborough to travel to Hong Kong with him. Max returns to the family home after Maria's departure. Max had other troubles when he loses his driver's licence for driving under the influence of alcohol. As a plumber he needs someone to drive him around to his jobs, something his new apprentice Terry Inglis takes over. Max abruptly leaves Erinsborough in early 1986. It is explained that he traveled to Queensland to visit relatives. Later, after reportedly reconciling with estranged wife Maria, he sends word he will not be returning. 23 years after Max's departure, it was revealed that Max and Anne Robinson had had an affair and Anne gave birth to a daughter, Jill (Perri Cummings). Jill had 3 children; Kate (Ashleigh Brewer), Harry (Will Moore) and Sophie (Kaiya Jones). Reception British critics suggested that as a plumber, Max would not have been able to afford the lifestyle of Ramsay Street. In Australia, they were surprised that Max chose to live in the area when he could be living elsewhere. In the 1980s, plumbers in Australia earned similar wages to doctors and lawyers. Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture gave Max a 3 out of 5 for his contribution to Neighbours, during a feature called \\"A guide to recognising your Ramsays and Robinsons\\". Deller said \\"The patriarch of the Ramsay family in the early days of Neighbours. He was married to Maria, although they had a tempestuous relationship, not least because Max was a pretty hot-headed sort. To prove that the Robinsons aren't the only family with illegitimate children, Maria had a son, Danny, with a man that wasn't Max, and he, of course, fathered Jill\\". In her book \\"Soap opera\\", Dorothy Hobson describes Max and his family as \\"more working class than other characters\\", also stating: \\"They had working-class jobs but were not represented as cloth cap wearing or dowdy, they were bright and modern and representative of a vibrant and working population.\\"Hobson, Dorothy, p.15 Andrew Mercado in his book Super Aussie Soaps brands the Ramsay family as being the backbone of the serial during the early years.Mercado, Andrew, p. 230 References  * Neighbours characters Fictional plumbers Television characters introduced in 1985 Male characters in television ","title":"Max Ramsay"},{"id":"5721368","text":"Commander Nigel David \\"Sharkey\\" Ward, (born 1943), born Nigel David MacCartan- Ward, is a retired British Royal Navy officer who commanded 801 Naval Air Squadron during the Falklands War.

Ward's first AIM-9L Sidewinder missile fell short of the C-130, but the second started a fire between the inner and outer port engines. Ward then fired 240 rounds from his Harrier's two ADEN cannons and this action broke off the wing of the enemy aircraft, sending it crashing into the sea and killing the seven crew members.ASN Aircraft accident Lockheed C-130H Hercules TC-63 Pebble IslandBritains Small Wars.com Ward flew over sixty war missions, achieved three air-to-air kills, and took part in or witnessed a total of ten kills; he was also the leading night pilot, and was decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross for gallantry.

The first was a V-shaped pair on the snout, fused at the base. The second pair was placed between the eyes and the ears and was curved inwards, the horns facing towards each other in a semicircular shape. Like giraffe ossicones, these protrusions were covered with skin. They were probably used for display and fighting. In addition to the horns, Syndyoceras also possessed tusk-like canine teeth, that it may have used to root through soil and undergrowth for food, in a similar manner to a modern musk deer.

Situated opposite Liverpool South Parkway bus and rail interchange, it is visible from trains which are travelling between the former and and the overhead passageway above platforms 1 to 4 at Liverpool South Parkway. The depot is located less than from the Freightliner intermodal terminal at Garston Docks and is also from the Stobart Rail intermodal depot in Widnes. During the days of steam locomotive operation, the shed code was 8H between 1960 and 1963 and 8J between 1963 and 1973. Since 1973, when TOPS was introduced, Allerton's depot code has been AN. History During the British Rail era, Allerton depot was responsible for maintaining all of the main line and shunting locomotives which were operating in the Liverpool area, having an allocation of Class 08 diesel shunters and a wheel lathe. Users =Merseyrail= Until 2006, when a new wheel lathe was installed at Merseyrail's Kirkdale depot, Merseyrail's Class 507 and 508 electric multiple units were regularly sent to Allerton for wheel turning, being transferred via the crossover at Hunts Cross. Other units, including Virgin CrossCountry's Class 220 and 221 diesel electric multiple units (servicing only) and goods wagons and locomotives, have previously been stabled here. =Northern Rail= From March 2011 until 31 March 2016, the depot was operated by Northern Rail. In 2011, it was announced that Network Rail had purchased the then closed Allerton TMD with the intention of refurbishing and reopening the depot for servicing of Northern Rail's fleet of Class 156 Super Sprinter diesel multiple units and the planned allocation of units, which were to cascade to Northern Rail for planned electrified services. Previously owned by the English Welsh and Scottish Railway, Allerton TMD re-opened on 10 December 2011. The first Class 319 units entered traffic in March 2015 with the completion of the first phase of the North West Electrification programme. =Northern= On 1 April 2016, when the new Northern franchise period commenced, operation of Allerton transferred to Northern. The depot retained its allocation of 29 Class 156 DMUs and twenty Class 319/3 EMUs, with an additional twelve Class 319s being allocated to the depot during 2017.

He is a foe of the Fantastic Four. Publication history Paibok's first appearance was in Fantastic Four Vol. 1, #358 (November, 1991); he was created by Tom DeFalco, Paul Ryan and Danny Bulanadi. Fictional character biography Paibok was born on the planet Tarnax IV, in the Tarnax System in the Andromeda Galaxy. His home planet was part of the Skrull Empire, but has since been destroyed. Paibok was trained at the Skrullian military academy, and became a Skrull espionage agent, and a captain in the Skrull armed forces. =Lyja and Alicia= The Skrull Empire seeks a way to defeat the Fantastic Four, who have handed them multiple defeats. Paibok suggests a subtle plan: replacing the Fantastic Four's associate Alicia Masters with Lyja, a Skrull spy and Paibok's former lover. Their relationship had not ended well. Lyja successfully impersonates Alicia and the real Alicia is held prisoner by Paibok. Eventually the Fantastic Four realize what had happened and come in search of Alicia. They confront Paibok on 'War World'. Paibok, now calling himself the \\"Power Skrull\\" after being augmented in a manner similar to the Super-Skrull, is prepared for the encounter and almost defeats the Fantastic Four and Lyja. Lyja seemingly sacrifices her life to protect the Human Torch and the Thing finally defeats Paibok. He is left for dead, buried under fallen rubble.Fantastic Four #358 (November, 1991). Marvel Comics. =The Fearsome Foursome= Paibok survived the battle and recovered Lyja's body. Seeking revenge on the Fantastic Four, he encountered Devos the Devastator, another alien who had clashed with them, and the two formed an alliance.Fantastic Four #366. Marvel Comics. Devos was able to revive Lyja, and Paibok and Devos altered Lyja's genetic structure, granting her the power of flight and the ability to project lethal energy blasts. Together, the three traveled to earth to battle the Fantastic Four again. Arriving on earth, they isolated and attacked the Human Torch in New York City, forcing him to use his Nova Flame against them ‚Äî a move which then led to his arrest for damage to the surroundings. A second attack confused and aggravated the situation, leaving the Human Torch a fugitive from the police.Fantastic Four #369-372. Marvel Comics. Alongside Devos and Lyja, Paibok witnessed the battle between the Fantastic Four and an alternate Fantastic Four. Paibok was betrayed by Lyja when she again joined the conflict and abandoned Paibok and sided with the Fantastic Four.Fantastic Four #374. Marvel Comics. Alongside Devos, Paibok attacked the Human Torch during his trial.Fantastic Four #377. Marvel Comics. Undeterred, Paibok and Devos recruited new allies ‚Äî Klaw and Huntara ‚Äî and the quartet continued their attacks on the Fantastic Four, becoming known as the Fearsome Foursome. Eventually they were able to capture their foes (including Lyja) and returned to the Skrull Throneworld to present the captives to the Empress. Paibok's triumph was short-lived, though ‚Äî once on Throneworld he discovered that Devos was a wanted criminal, a renegade with a price on his head and an entire world under his command. Devos promptly summoned his troops, took personal command of his flagship (the Death Cruiser) and attempted to destroy Throneworld. The Empress blamed Paibok for this and repaid him by ordering his death. Seeking to redeem himself, Paibok made his way on board the Death Cruiser and confronted Devos. The ship's stardrive was damaged during their confrontation and the cruiser fell into subspace ‚Äî Devos and Paibok were both believed lost along with the ship. =Freakshow= Paibok somehow escaped from subspace and struck a deal with Centaurian scientists to enhance his powers. Their treatment succeeded ‚Äî but also affected his appearance, leaving him in a cadaverous, zombie-like form. Still viewed as a traitor, he fled to Earth and assembled a band of Skrull renegades.Thing: Freakshow #3 (October, 2002). Marvel Comics. Disguised as Paul Balk, the owner of a traveling freakshow, Paibok located and tried to capture an immature Watcher, a plan that led to clashes with the Thing and a band of Kree.Thing: Freakshow #1 (August, 2002). Marvel Comics. The attempt failed and he was captured by the Kree, who left earth shortly afterwards with Paibok as their prisoner.Thing: Freakshow #4 (November, 2002).

Marvel Comics. Paibok's appearance had, without explanation, been reverted to that of a typical Skrull. The prison ship crashed on Earth, near the town of Coot's Bluff in Alaska, and Paibok immediately took command of the other survivors (Lunatik and the Blood Brothers) in an attempt to salvage the wrecked ship's technology and escape the planet. Paibok's plan also involved taking control of Coot's Bluff and using the terrified population as slave labor ‚Äî something which brought his renegades into conflict with the only other survivor of the crash, Drax the Destroyer. Initially, Paibok and his allies defeated Drax, leaving him for dead. However, Drax somehow recovered ‚Äî and then hunted down his attackers, killing Lunatik and one of the Blood Brothers. Paibok's escape plan was abandoned and, faced with death at the hands of a vengeful Drax, he activated a distress beacon that he had secretly salvaged from the wreck ‚Äî summoning another ship and surrendering himself to the authorities who had previously imprisoned him.Drax the Destroyer #4 (January, 2006).

Following the death of Annihilus, the parasites injected into Paibok to force his obedience cease functioning. He briefly joins forces with Terrax the Tamer and the Delinquent to kill Randau the Space Parasite, a being that had been slaughtering innocents. After the battle, which ends with the destruction of the planet by Terrax, he convinces the addled Delinquent to craft a spaceship.

Powers and abilities As a Skrull, Paibok possesses a heightened degree of physical malleability, an innate racial ability to shape-shift and the power of hypnosis. He is a graduate of the Skrullian military academy and is an expert in all forms of armed and unarmed combat known to the Skrulls. Paibok also has knowledge of and access to technology centuries ahead of conventional Earth science. Paibok wears body armor of unspecified materials. Paibok also has a set of additional powers thanks to biogenetic engineering by Skrull scientists. He possesses superhuman strength, stamina, and durability, the power of flight, and the abilities to transform his skin into a durable steel- like substance, project blasts of bio-electricity up to 50,000 volts, and to project bursts of cold to absolute zero from his hands and to freeze local moisture from the air, thus forming ice constructs. He possesses an immunity to the effects of his own electrostatic and cold temperature powers. In other media Paibok appears as a mini-boss in the video game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance, voiced by Khary Payton. He appears during a mission when the player must visit the Skrull homeworld that is under attack by Galactus. Initially, the player can choose either the Super-Skrull or Paibok to act as bodyguards while opening the doors for the Skrull Empress' spaceship to escape. The only exception is if your team is composed of the Fantastic Four in which case they do not trust either Paibok or Super-Skrull. Afterwards, the Skrull Empress then orders Paibok and Super-Skrull to kill the heroes while she escapes.

Randolph Turner III. Before and After Jamestown: Virginia's Powhatans and Their Predecessors. Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2002. The term Tsenacommacah comes from the Powhatan language, and means ‚Äúdensely inhabited land.‚Äù History =Origins and contact= The Powhatan were part of a powerful Chiefdom of Virginia IndianVirginia Secretary of Natural Resources ‚Äì Doug Domenech tribes, also known as the Powhatan Confederacy, that spoke an Algonquian language. The chief of the Powhatan people in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Wahunsenacawh, had originally controlled only six tribes, but throughout the late 1500s he added more tribes to his nation, through diplomacy and/or force. He added the Kecoughtan by 1598. By 1607, Wahunsenacawh controlled more than thirty tribes. The original six tribes under Wahunsenacawh were: the Powhatan (proper), the Arrohateck, the Appamattuck, the Pamunkey, the Mattaponi, and the Chiskiack. Some other affiliated groups included the Rappahannocks, Moraughtacund, Weyanoak, Paspahegh, Quiyoughcohannock, Warraskoyack, and Nansemond. Another closely related tribe of the same language group was the Chickahominy, but they managed to preserve their autonomy from the Powhatan Paramount Chiefdom. The Accawmacke, located on the Eastern Shore across the Chesapeake Bay, were paid nominal tribute to the Powhatan Chiefdom, but enjoyed autonomy under their own Paramount Chief or \\"Emperor\\", Debedeavon (aka \\"The Laughing King\\"). =Warfare= By early 1609, relations had begun to sour between the Powhatan and the English. As a result Wahunsenacawh moved his primary residence from Werowocomoco, off the York River, to Orapax (or Orapakes), located in a swamp at the head of the Chickahominy River. By 1614 Wahunsenacawh had again moved his primary residence, this time further northwest to a location on the north bank of the Pamunkey River known as Matchut. Matchut was not far from where Wahunsenacawh's brother Opechancanough ruled at Youghtanund. Wahunsenacawh died in 1618, after which the chiefdom was ultimately passed to his younger brother Opechancanough, who led the Indian Massacre of 1622 as well as a second attack in 1644. Both attacks provoked English retaliations. A peace treaty, signed in 1646, brought an end to the conflicts between the Powhatan and the English. The treaty was signed by Opechancanough's successor Necotowance ‚Äì Opechancanough himself was captured by the English and killed by an English guard in 1646.Powhatan Indian Lifeways As part of the treaty of 1646, the size of Tsenacommacah was reduced. The boundaries specified in the treaty separated Virginia Indian lands from those that were considered English-owned, and restricted crossings to those on official business. Badges were required for all visitors. The treaty also established the payment of a yearly tribute to the English, as well as delineating a number of tribal land reservations.Wood, Karenne. The Virginia Indian Heritage Trail, 2007. Among the surviving tribes of the now-dissolved Confederacy, the Appomattocs, Nansemonds and Weyanokes retreated to the south, becoming independent of Necotowance, as did the Powhites or Powhatan proper. The Pamunkey, Mattaponi, Chickahominy, Rappahannock, Kiskiack, Wiccocomico, Patawomeck, Morattico, Nanzatico, Sekakawon, and Onawmanient, occupying the peninsulas north of the York, were cut off from the southern tribes by the English enclave. The Virginia Colony long respected its southern boundary established by this treaty, refusing to recognize settlements beyond it as late as 1705. However, the ban on settling north of the York river was lifted September 1, 1649, and a wave of new immigrants quickly flooded the northern tribes, leaving them scattered and isolated on ever-shrinking patches of land. That year, the Pamunkey weroance, Totopotomoi, received for his tribe along both sides of the upper Pamunkey River,Helen Rountree, 1990, Pocahontas's People, p. 110. and the Kiskiack weroance, Ossakican was reserved on the Piankatank.Helen Rountree, 1990, Pocahontas's People, p. 116. In 1650, another treaty reserved land for the creation of Indian towns, where of land was granted per warrior. These lands became smaller and smaller in following years. Tracts were surveyed for the remaining tribes in the following decades, but these quickly shrank as they were either sold off or in some cases actually seized outright. Following Bacon's Rebellion, the Treaty of Middle Plantation was signed by many Virginia Indian leaders in 1677, limiting Tsenocommacah even further. The treaty set up six reservations, reinforced the annual tribute payment to the English, and more fully acknowledged the Virginia tribes' subjection to the King of England. =Contemporary tribes= All of the reservations, save two, were lost over the next two centuries. Even so, many of the remaining tribes still live in or near their ancestral lands. The Pamunkey and Mattaponi are the only tribes that still maintain their reservations from the 17th century. As such, these two tribes still make their yearly tribute payments, of fish and game, as stipulated by the 1646 and 1677 treaties. As far as anyone knows, the tribes have not missed a \\"payment\\" in 331 years. Every year, on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, they go to the Virginia Governor's house in Richmond to make their yearly payment. A ceremony is held in which a deer, turkey, or fish and some pottery are presented to the governor. Before the ceremony a brunch is held where the tribes are able to converse with the governor. It has not always been easy for the Mattaponi and the Pamunkey to get the necessary items for their yearly payment, but they have made it a point of honor to uphold their end of the bargain.Waugaman, Sandra F. and Danielle-Moretti Langholtz, PhD. We're Still Here: Contemporary Virginia Indians Tell Their Stories. Richmond: Palari Publishing, 2006 (revised edition).Kimberlain, Joanne. \\"We're Still Here.\\" Virginian-Pilot. June 7‚Äì9, 2009: Print. Society =Population= The population of Tsenacommacah was 14,000 to 21,000 people by 1607. The tribes shared mutually intelligible dialects of the Powhatan Language. The language, however, died out by the 1790s after the people switched to English. Much of the language has been forgotten, and is only known from two wordlists made by William Strachey and Captain John Smith. However, there have been attempts to reconstruct the language, particularly from linguists like Frank T. Siebert and Blair A. Rudes. =Lifestyle= Reconstructed Powhatan village at the Jamestown Settlement living-history museum. The Powhatan lived in Tidewater Virginia. Their homes were called yehakins, and they were made by bending saplings and placing woven mats or bark over top of the saplings. All of Virginia's natives practiced agriculture, and cultivated maize. A village became unusable as soil productivity gradually declined and local fish and game were depleted, so they periodically moved their villages from site to site. Villagers cleared the fields by felling, girdling, or firing trees at the base and then using fire to reduce the slash and stumps. The natives also used fire to maintain extensive areas of open game habitat throughout the East, later called \\"barrens\\" by European colonists. The Powhatan also had rich fishing grounds. Bison had migrated to this area by the early 15th century. The Powhatan primarily used fires to heat their sleeping rooms. As a result, less bedding was needed, and bedding materials could be easily stored during daytime hours. Couples typically slept head to foot. Powhatan men were warriors and hunters, and would run and walk extensively through the woods in pursuit of enemies or game, while women were gardeners and gatherers and would spend hours tending crops, pounding corn into meal, gathering nuts, and performing other chores. The women would construct hunting camps when the men were gone for extended periods of time. Women were also believed to serve as barbers, decorate homes, and produce decorative clothing. The Powhatan domestic economy depended on the labor of both sexes. =Religion= The native Powhatan religion has been well documented. The Powhatans believed in two primary Gods. Ahone was the creator of life. Oke was the lesser twin god who accepted sacrifices and was prayed to for help. Beneath these two were many other spirits. The Powhatan tried to appease Oke with various offerings such as jewelry and tobacco. Religious leaders were advisors to tribal leaders.https://www.historyisfun.org/learn/learning-center/how-did-the- powhatan-express-their-religious-beliefs/ It is believed that Powhatans would make offerings and pray to the sun during sunrises. Government =Capitals= Tsenacommacah originally had two capitals. The main capital was the village of Werowocomoco, located in present-day Gloucester County. The second capital, the village of Powhatan was believed to be in the present-day Powhatan Hill section of the eastern part of Richmond, Virginia, or perhaps nearby in a location which became part of Tree Hill Farm. Werowocomoco was described by the English colonists as only as the crow flies from Jamestown, but also described as downstream from present-day West Point, measurements which conflict with each other. In 2003 archaeologists initiated excavations at a site in Gloucester County that have revealed an extensive indigenous settlement from about 1200 (the late Woodland period) through the early Contact period. Work since then has added to their belief that this is the location of Werowocomoco. The site is on a farm bordering on Purtain Bay of the York River, about from Jamestown. The more than residential settlement extends up to back from the river. In 2004, researchers excavated two curving ditches of at the far edge, which were constructed about 1400 CE. In addition to extensive artifacts from hundreds of years of indigenous settlement, researchers have found a variety of trade goods related to the brief interaction of Native Americans and English in the early years of Jamestown. Around 1609, Wahunsenacawh shifted his capital from Werowocomoco to Orapakes, located in a swamp at the head of the Chickahominy River, near the modern-day interchange of Interstate 64 and Interstate 295. Sometime between 1611 and 1614, he moved further north to Matchut, in present-day King William County on the north bank of the Pamunkey River. =Leadership= Each tribe had its own name and chief (werowance/weroance or weroansqua if female), and Tsenacommacah as a whole was ruled by a paramount chief (mamanatowick) named Wahunsenacawh, or more popularly Chief Powhatan.Rountree, Helen C. Pocahontas, Powhatan, Opechancanough: Three Indian Lives Changed by Jamestown. University of Virginia Press, 2005. The Mamanatowick let their district and subordinate weroances make the final decision on how to handle hostile situations. This was made apparent with the events that took place in 1607 and the hostility with the newcomers (English settlers). Weroances and Priest were the only ones allowed to enter into religious temples. A weroance did not go to meet any visitor, visitors were escorted to see a weroance. The weroance, their wives, and councilors often dressed in the finest jewels, and tanned deer skin. Several of the weroances' personal names were known and some recorded by William Strachey and other sources.List of weroances recorded by Strachey The names of their respective chieftaincies were also commonly used as titles, exactly analogous to European peerages, so that the Weroance of Arrohattec (whose given name was Ashaquid) was often referred to simply as \\"Arrohattec\\", much as the Earl of Essex would be referred to just as \\"Essex\\" in lieu of a personal name. When the English arrived in Virginia, some of the weroances subject to the paramount chief Powhatan, or mamanatowick (Wahunsenacawh) were his own nearest male relatives: * Parahunt, Weroance of the Powhatan (proper), also called Tanx (\\"little\\") Powhatan, said by Strachey to be a son of the paramount chief Powhatan, and often confused with same. * Pochins, Weroance of the Kecoughtan, was also a son of the paramount chief, whom he had appointed there some time after slaying their previous ruler in ca. 1598. *Opechancanough, Chief Powhatan's younger brother, was a weroance of the Pamunkey, but increased in power, and came to be the effective ruler of the entire Powhatan Confederacy after Wahunsenacawh's death in 1618. In Tsenacommacah, women could inherit power, because the inheritance of power was matrilineal. In A Map of Virginia John Smith of Jamestown explains: > His [Chief Powhatan's] kingdome descendeth not to his sonnes nor children: > but first to his brethren, whereof he hath 3 namely Opitchapan, > Opechancanough, and Catataugh; and after their decease to his sisters.

The cross sits at the same spot on Cerro del Vig√≠a where early settlers once looked out for merchant ships and would-be invaders, including marauding pirates. In 1801, the settlers built a much smaller cross made of two intersecting tree trunks where an observer would constantly watch the sea and the city's port, raising different flags to either notify local merchants of incoming trade ships or alert military authorities of possible threats (a replica of this wooden cross now sits behind the current monument). Originally a hut was built accompanied by a cross from where flags were raised to signal the approach of ships as well as their port of origin. This station was run by two brothers Ricardo and Alberto Lugo, they were honored with a plaque at the base of the cross in 1984. They are descendants of Alonso Fern√°ndez de Lugo last conquistador of Spain.La Cruceta del Vig√≠a / Cross Watchtower, Ponce, Puerto Rico One of the best remembered watchmen was named Luis Castro. Nearly 200 years ago, Luis would sit atop a huge wooden cross on this hill. On the lookout for ocean vessels, it was his responsibility to determine the nationality of approaching ships. If he recognized the vessel he would raise a flag, but if a ship was thought to be carrying contraband then no flag was raised and the Spanish military would investigate. The Cruceta was built in honor of Mr. Castro and all the other watchmen who so faithfully helped protect the city during its younger years. The Cerro del Vig√≠a also served as a refugee camp for citizens during the storm of 12 September 1738, the earthquake of 10 May 1787, the tsunami of 18 November 1867, and the American invasion of 25 July 1898.La Cruceta del Vigia.

Her father was a journalist. She joined the Komsomol in 1936. In her diary, she described her life from 1936 until her death. She died during a partisan mission which started on 14 November 1941. Biography =Early life= Nina Kosterina was born in a revolutionary camp just as the Russian civil war was ending and the birth of Communism in Russia was getting under way. Her early life mirrored the struggle of millions of Russian citizens as they attempted to stabilize their world. Her father, Alexei Evgrafovich Kosterin, was a Bolshevik agitator who was arrested twice and spent three years in prison for his role in the uprising against the Czar in 1917. He married Anna Mickhailovna sometime between 1918 and 1920. Nina was their first child. Settled in Moscow by 1922, the Kosterin family proudly supported the new government. Nina began her training early as a young Communist, influenced by her family's politics and the infusion of Communist philosophy into the education system. In 1925, the family welcomed a second child‚ÄîLelya. During this period, a power struggle was playing out between Soviet leader Vladimir Lenin and two other top leaders, Leon Trotsky and Joseph Stalin. Stalin emerged as the winner. Food was scarce throughout the country and the grand experiment of Communism was undergoing growing pains as Soviet leaders tried to follow Marxist principles but salvage the country's economy. Nina apparently struggled with early learning but persisted in her studies for the next several years, greatly inspired by revolutionary teachings, her \\"job\\" as an activist and her love of learning. During this time, she began a diary (at age 15) and was soon after accepted into the Young Communist League known as the Komsomol. =Career= She started her diary by calling herself \\"an ordinary girl.\\" This diary became a window into her world until her death in 1941. From it, Nina emerged as a strong-headed, reflective, sometimes brooding teen who took herself and the world seriously. She was passionate about the arts and her role as a Young Communist. She wanted to be on a good path as a person and she was honest with herself when she struggled. She also used her diary to chronicle her roller-coaster friendships with a girl named Lena Gershman and a boy named Grisha Grinblat. In 1936, Nina welcomed another sister‚ÄîVera‚Äîand also said good-bye to her father as he was sent to the Russian Far East on assignment. She would never see him again. While away, Alexei fell out of favor with Stalin's increasingly paranoid government. He was eventually sent to a prison gulag as a \\"dangerous social element,\\" a fate suffered by many during the worst of the Stalin years. He remained imprisoned throughout World War II. Nina graduated from secondary school in 1939, eager to become a geologist. While she was at a summer geology camp as part of her college training, Germany invaded Russia. Her family evacuated Moscow but she chose to return and volunteer as a student soldier. She parachuted behind enemy lines in November and participated in partisan missions for about a month. Partisan soldiers‚Äîmen and women‚Äîwere the ‚Äúkamikazes‚Äù of the Soviet war effort, attacking and harassing the Germans in the territories they now occupied, usually through stealthy night raids. Partisans worked as explosive experts, nurses, radio operators, scouts, information gatherers, and liaisons with the local villagers. = Death = In January 1942, Nina's family received notice that she had perished during a mission in December. For years, the family lacked details about what had happened. Then, a memoir released about soldiers from the war effort found its way to the family and included an official report about her last mission. In the report, a member of the unit described how a band of twenty-two partisans‚ÄîNina among them‚Äîdeparted on a mission December 19. They slipped behind enemy lines south of Moscow near the cities of Podolsk and Narofominsk. As they went deep into the woods, they fell into a German ambush, tripping a wire that set off an explosion. Fifteen partisans, including Nina, perished. The surviving seven ended their mission and returned to their base camp to report the attack. The goal of their mission was not shared. After the war, Nina's mother and sisters returned to Moscow and found her diary tucked away in their apartment. They kept it safe and later gave it to Alexei for safe-keeping once he was released from Stalin's prisons in 1955. The diary stayed private until 1962, when the family allowed a Soviet magazine to publish it. This was possible only because the new Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, began allowing citizens to talk more openly about their experiences during the Stalin years. Many journals, diaries and memoirs started to emerge. Two years later, Nina's diary was released in Russian book form. Then, in 1968, it was released in English by American publisher, Crown Books. It became a bestseller. Alexei, who remained out of favor even with the new government due to his activism, died in 1968. Nina's mother died in 1974. Nina's youngest sister, Vera, died in 1997. As of 2004, Nina's other sister, Lelya (also known as Elena), was still living in Moscow. Sources * Ginsburg, Mirra. Translator. The Diary of Nina Kosterina, Crown Books, 1968. * Phillips, Jennifer.

History Built on the site of the original built Bristol and Exeter Railway shed, it was rebuilt under the Loans and Guarantees Act (1929) in 1934 by the Great Western Railway, allocated shed code 82A. The site scale meant that although the depot was to be the major repair and maintenance point for the Bristol divisional area, the shed was restricted to a steel-frame straight 8-road with northernlight roof pattern form, as opposed to the GWR standard-pattern turntable model like Old Oak Common. Secondly, as the depot was so close to Bristol Temple Meads, it was required to keep the depot in full operation while construction took place. The twin-ramp coal stage was of standard GWR pattern but used concrete beams and brick piers to restrict ramp width. The divisional repair shop was located to the far north of the site, close to the River Avon. There were two standard-pattern over-girder turntables on site, one to the rear of the shed, and one to the Northeast of the repair shop. Bristol Bath Road depot under British Railways, 2 August 1958, as viewed from platform 2A of Bristol Temple Meads While Bath Road handled passenger traffic locomotives, St Philip's Marsh depot on the eastern throat handled freight types. Post nationalisation, under British Railways both Bath Road (Code: BR) and St Philip's Marsh gained additional allocation from the closure of the local London Midland and Scottish Railway sheds. By 1950 it had an allocation of 93 locomotives, half of them classic GWR 4-6-0s, most of the others 2-6-2Ts for running local and regional passenger traffic. However, as it was located on a main national route, with an equally large- scale shed on the opposite throat of the station, Bath Road was one of the first sheds to be closed to steam locomotives from September 1960. Rebuilt as a diesel depot, it retained one of the turntables. The depot ceased all operation on 28 September 1995, when its last operator Great Western Trains transferred all operations to St Philip's Marsh T&RSMD.;1998 - Rail Regulator agrees closure of lines in former Bristol Bath Road depot : Office of Rail Regulation  Modern redevelopment  In 2011, the railway-level depot site was named as part of the Bristol Temple Quarter Enterprise Zone, where reduced taxes and planning controls would encourage development of new businesses. It was hoped that around 40 businesses would provide employment for 4,000 people within five years. The site was also considered to become the location for the Bristol Arena, a new 12,000 seater entertainment venue, with construction expected to start in late 2016 and set to open in 2018. Development of the Arena was repeatedly delayed and at the end of 2018, the idea of building it here were scrapped and the future for the site remains unclear.

K. Godunov in 1959, for solving partial differential equations. One can think of this method as a conservative finite-volume method which solves exact, or approximate Riemann problems at each inter-cell boundary. In its basic form, Godunov's method is first order accurate in both space and time, yet can be used as a base scheme for developing higher-order methods. Basic scheme Following the classical Finite-volume method framework, we seek to track a finite set of discrete unknowns, : Q^{n}_i = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x} \\\\int_{x_{i-1/2}} ^ { x_{i+1/2} } q(t^n, x)\\\\, dx where the x_{i-1/2} = x_{\\\\text{low}} + \\\\left( i - 1/2 \\\\right) \\\\Delta x and t^n = n \\\\Delta t form a discrete set of points for the hyperbolic problem: : q_t + ( f( q ) )_x = 0, where the indices t and x indicate the derivations in time and space, respectively. If we integrate the hyperbolic problem over a control volume [x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2}], we obtain a Method of lines (MOL) formulation for the spatial cell averages: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} Q_i( t ) = -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x} \\\\left( f( q( t, x_{i+1/2} ) ) - f( q( t, x_{i-1/2} ) ) \\\\right), which is a classical description of the first order, upwinded finite volume method. (c.f. Leveque - Finite Volume Methods for Hyperbolic Problems ) Exact time integration of the above formula from time t = t^n to time t = t^{n+1} yields the exact update formula: : Q^{n+1}_i = Q^n_i - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta x } \\\\int_{ t^n }^{t^{n+1} } \\\\left( f( q( t, x_{i+1/2} ) ) - f( q( t, x_{i-1/2} ) ) \\\\right)\\\\, dt. Godunov's method replaces the time integral of each : \\\\int_{t^n}^{t^{n+1} } f( q( t, x_{i-1/2} ) )\\\\, dt with a Forward Euler method which yields a fully discrete update formula for each of the unknowns Q^n_i . That is, we approximate the integrals with : \\\\int_{t^n}^{t^{n+1} } f( q( t, x_{i-1/2} ) )\\\\, dt \\\\approx \\\\Delta t f^\\\\downarrow\\\\left( Q^n_{i-1}, Q^n_i \\\\right), where f^\\\\downarrow\\\\left( q_l, q_r \\\\right) is an approximation to the exact solution of the Riemann problem. For consistency, one assumes that : f^\\\\downarrow( q_l , q_r ) = f( q_l ) \\\\quad \\\\text{ if } \\\\quad q_l = q_r, and that f^\\\\downarrow is increasing in the first argument, and decreasing in the second argument. For scalar problems where f'( q ) > 0 , one can use the simple Upwind scheme, which defines f^\\\\downarrow( q_l, q_r ) = f( q_l ) . The full Godunov scheme requires the definition of an approximate, or an exact Riemann solver, but in its most basic form, is given by: : Q^{n+1}_i = Q^n_i - \\\\lambda \\\\left( \\\\hat{f}^n_{i+1/2} - \\\\hat{f}^n_{i-1/2} \\\\right), \\\\quad \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{\\\\Delta x}, \\\\quad \\\\hat{f}^n_{i-1/2} = f^\\\\downarrow\\\\left( Q^n_{i-1}, Q^n_i \\\\right) Linear problem In the case of a linear problem, where f(q) = a q , and without loss of generality, we'll assume that a > 0 , the upwinded Godunov method yields: : Q^{n+1}_i = Q^n_i - u \\\\left( Q^{n}_i - Q^n_{i-1} \\\\right), \\\\quad u = a \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t } {\\\\Delta x }, which yields the classical first-order, upwinded Finite Volume scheme whose stability requires u = \\\\left a \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{\\\\Delta x} \\\\right \\\\leq 1 . Three- step algorithm Following Hirsch, the scheme involves three distinct steps to obtain the solution at t = (n+1) \\\\Delta t \\\\, from the known solution at {t = n \\\\Delta t} \\\\,, as follows: Step 1 Define piecewise constant approximation of the solution at {t = (n+1) \\\\Delta t} \\\\,. Since the piecewise constant approximation is an average of the solution over the cell of size {\\\\Delta x} \\\\,, the spatial error is of order {\\\\Delta x} \\\\, , and hence the resulting scheme will be first-order accurate in space. Note that this approximation corresponds to a finite volume method representation whereby the discrete values represent averages of the state variables over the cells. Exact relations for the averaged cell values can be obtained from the integral conservation laws. Step 2 Obtain the solution for the local Riemann problem at the cell interfaces. This is the only physical step of the whole procedure. The discontinuities at the interfaces are resolved in a superposition of waves satisfying locally the conservation equations. The original Godunov method is based upon the exact solution of the Riemann problems. However, approximate solutions can be applied as an alternative. Step 3 Average the state variables after a time interval {\\\\Delta t} \\\\,. The state variables obtained after Step 2 are averaged over each cell defining a new piecewise constant approximation resulting from the wave propagation during the time interval {\\\\Delta t} \\\\,. To be consistent, the time interval {\\\\Delta t} \\\\, should be limited such that the waves emanating from an interface do not interact with waves created at the adjacent interfaces. Otherwise the situation inside a cell would be influenced by interacting Riemann problems. This leads to the CFL condition  a_\\\\max  \\\\Delta t < \\\\Delta x/2 \\\\, where  a_\\\\max  \\\\, is the maximum wave speed obtained from the cell eigenvalue(s) of the local Jacobian matrix. The first and third steps are solely of a numerical nature and can be considered as a projection stage, independent of the second, physical step, the evolution stage. Therefore, they can be modified without influencing the physical input, for instance by replacing the piecewise constant approximation by a piecewise linear variation inside each cell, leading to the definition of second-order space-accurate schemes, such as the MUSCL scheme.

Fictional character biography Devos is an extraterrestrial vigilante dedicated to bringing peace to the universe, but holds the rather warped view that this can only be done by destroying anyone whom he deems a threat to galactic peace‚Äîtherefore, killing everyone capable of waging war. While Devos is willing to make alliances with other villains in order to further his goals, he inevitably betrays his allies (as they too are capable of waging war). In his first appearance, he battled the Fantastic Four, then fled in his escape craft while his starship was destroyed.Fantastic Four #359 He then encountered and joined forces with Paibok the Power Skrull.Fantastic Four #366 He watched Paibok alter Lyja's genetic structure, then arrived on Earth with Paibok. He joined Paibok and Lyja the Lazerfist in an attack on the Human Torch in New York City.Fantastic Four #369-371 His most notable act is probably his destruction of the Skrull Throneworld, throwing the Skrull Empire into civil war.Fantastic Four #383 (December 1993) Devos later reappears in the Annihilation miniseries in the pages of Ronan.

Chapter Five However during the 1870s the shed collapsed in a gale, burying stabled locomotives and was replaced by two gabled roof spans with numerous ducts and chimneys. When newly rebuilt, it would measure in length, with a maximum width of . These sheds were situated just north of the railway station on a siding to the west side of the West Coast Main Line, on a site now occupied by today's carpark.

The Diverting Reservoir is also connected to the nearby Croton Falls Reservoir via a channel and dividing weir allowing water to freely pass between. The water in Diverting Reservoir flows into the continuation of the East Branch, which then joins the flow of the West Branch, itself carrying the flow of the Middle Branch, amid the headwaters of the Muscoot Reservoir, the collecting point for most of the Croton Watershed. It continues into the New Croton Reservoir, the final collecting point, then the New Croton Aqueduct. Water from the Aqueduct flows into The Bronx and the Jerome Park Reservoir before entering Manhattan and joining the Catskill Aqueduct.

AdAge. Retrieved July 8, 2013. Campaign intentions Fast food advertising campaigns have changed their intent over time. After hearing years of criticism of fast food diet's harmful effects, many modern campaigns stress the availability of healthy options. The rise in awareness of proper nutrition and obesity has decreased the income of these establishments, and their marketing campaigns attempt to rectify this. Even with Fast food companies, \\"change,\\" in healthy meals and ingredients, many of the goods that are claimed and served are not what exclaimed when advertised. =Target audience= Fast food restaurants often aim some of their advertising directly at the youth population. McDonald's Happy Meals, which include a toy often tied in with a newly released family film, is a significant example. Ronald McDonald, a clown advertising mascot introduced in 1963 and designed to appeal to young children, is another. In addition, in 1987 McDonald's incorporated a Play Place in their restaurants to further advertise to children, making their restaurants a more appealing environment for children. Additionally, from 1996 to 2006, Disney was an exclusive partner with McDonald's, linking their products together. They announced the end of this deal in May 2006, with some reports saying that Disney was worried about childhood obesity. Other than Disney, McDonald's has also been partnered with Nintendo since 1985, when the Nintendo Entertainment System was first introduced. In 1987, McDonald's also created a Nintendo play land in their restaurants where kids could play on Nintendo consoles while waiting for their food. During 2007, McDonald's began to provide WiFi from the Nintendo consoles; giving children the ability to play wherever they were. With also a target audience of children releasing these new films and incorporating toys, it uses the kids to reach out to their parents pockets because of their large investments in their children lives. Other chains, such as Carl's Jr. and Burger King (see Burger King advertising), have directed advertising towards a different demographic ‚Äì young teenage and college-age men ‚Äì with trendy, often sexualized, imagery and messages that target men's supposed desire for large, meat-filled burgers and rich, satisfying food. For example, in 2005, Carl's Jr. debuted a controversial ad featuring a bikini-clad Paris Hilton writhing sensuously on an expensive Bentley luxury car while enjoying a large burger. While the ad provoked outrage from a number of groups, Carl's Jr. sales grew substantially. Regulation and criticism One of the main areas where fast food companies face regulation is the advertising of \\"junk food\\" to children. In the United Kingdom, the Children's Food Bill is intended to highly regulate the advertising of such food aimed at children. Many other countries are looking to introduce strict limitations on fast food advertising as well. Negotiations between the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and fast food companies were initiated in a collective effort to improve children's diets, though Burger King withdrew from the discussions. Some organizations have called for the watershed to apply to various unhealthy foods, including fast foods. In June 2006, the FSA called for laws preventing such food from being advertised on television before 9pm. They also called for the disassociation of television and film characters from fast food and stopping celebrities from appearing in such advertisements. The effect of these campaigns is often denied by the fast food companies and the television networks that carry their advertisements. Some networks have also claimed that tighter regulations would reduce advertising income and that would reduce the quality of children's programming. In Sweden, all advertising aimed at the under-12s is banned, including fast food adverts. Faced with restricted television, radio and print regulation, many fast food companies have started making use of Internet advertising to reach their customers. On June 3, 2004 KFC withdrew American television commercials claiming that \\"fried chicken can, in fact, be part of a healthy diet\\" after reaching a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission. Advertising authorities regularly receive complaints about fast food advertisements, with members of the public usually claiming that the wording is misleading. Not every complaint is upheld. Between September 11, 2002 and March 24, 2004 the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK investigated complaints about six McDonald's advertisements, with only two of them being upheld. The ASA used one of the upheld complaints as a case study. In 2006 the European Union passed a new law regarding the labeling of foods - any food with a nutritional claim (such as \\"low fat\\") must also highlight that it is high in something else (such as \\"high salt\\") if that is the case. While fast food is often not given a traditional label, this may affect advertising. In November 2006, the Office of Communications (Ofcom) announced that it would ban television advertisements for junk food before, during, and after television programming aimed at under-16s in the United Kingdom. This move has been criticized on both ends of the scale; while the Food and Drink Federation labelled the ban \\"over the top\\", others have said the restrictions do not go far enough (particularly because soap operas would be exempt from the ban). On 1 April 2007, junk food advertisements were banned from programs aimed at four to nine-year-olds. Such advertisements broadcast during programs \\"aimed at, or which would appeal to,\\" ten- to fifteen-year-olds will continue to be phased out over the coming months, with a full ban coming into effect on January 1, 2009. Sponsorship =Sport= Several international fast food companies have sponsored sporting events, teams and leagues. McDonald's is one of the largest sponsors, having affiliations with the NHL, Olympic Games, and the FIFA World Cup. =Television= Some fast food companies sponsor television programs. Domino's Pizza have sponsored Sky One's screenings of The Simpsons in the UK for many years (But reported because of new regulation on advertising that the deal may end). In 2005, Pizza Hut sponsored the same program when it was shown on Channel 4 - the Sky/Domino's deal continued. Fast food companies were major sponsors of the Saturday morning cartoons in the United States, where they advertised their children's meals. When McDonald's and Disney partnered, promotion of McDonald's meals were highly viewed by the youth population. This persuasion for children increased youth obesity and improper nutrition throughout the world. The withdrawal of Disney from their partnership with McDonald's was executed and since the two companies have not collaborated.

Following the privatisation of British Rail depot ownership transferred to EWS, now DB Schenker and continued as a base for diesel traction, latterly becoming a facility for storing surplus rolling stock. In 2014 ownership transferred to Locomotive Storage Limited who have been and are continuing to renovate the site. British Railways Constructed in 1957 and opened the following year, the site was built to maintain the growing fleet of British Railways diesel locomotives and multiple units used on the Midland region. It was wide, with five through roads and five of . Oil-fired boilers heated the offices, messroom, locker room and toilets, designed to accommodate up to 100, with a maximum of 80 at any one time. A fuel tank supplied three fuelling points. The depot had a 2-ton electric hoist block for unloading stores from wagons and a trichloroethylene degreasing machine.Railway Magazine March 1958 pp. 193-194 Privatisation Following privatisation the depot passed into the hands of EWS who continued to use the site for the assessment, maintenance, repairing, storing and scrapping of diesel-electric locomotives. Throughout the late 2000s and early 2010s the site fell into an increasing state of disrepair, being used for the long-term storage of DB Schenker locomotives. The site was also extensively used by Riviera Trains for the storage of rolling stock. Current Ownership In early 2014 the lease was signed for Locomotive Storage to operate and develop the facility. This included the 12 outside roads - one of which is electrified - 8 internal roads and the depot building itself, along with the dedicated paint shop and heavy lift building. Since the transfer of ownership, the site has been extensively renovated. The main building has seen the complete renewal of its roof along with internal refitting that has included the complete renovation of the living and office areas, allowing the site to become home to both Locomotive Storage Limited and LNWR Heritage's offices. The internal layout of the building has been modified, with the installation of a partition protecting three of the internal roads from dirt and dust from the workshop areas. 5 ton cranes have been installed along with heavy lifting jacks, to expand the maintenance and overhaul capabilities of the site.Steam Railway Magazine, Issue 440 April‚ÄìMay 2015, Pg 19-23 LNWR Heritage LNWR Heritage a heritage rail restoration company owned by the Royal Scot Locomotive and General Trust moved to the site in early 2015, transferring much of their operation from their former base north of the railway station at Crewe Heritage Centre. Leasing several of the roads inside the main building, LNWR Heritage can make use of 5 and 45 ton cranes, heavy lifting jacks, pit roads and dedicated workshop and paint shop facilities, aimed at providing a permanent base for their heritage rail engineering work for many years to come. Future It is planned that further developments on the site will include the construction of a dedicated boilershop, to be used by LNWR Heritage, for the overhaul of steam locomotive boilers. Locomotive Storage Ltd will also oversee the construction of a two road, roughly 250m long shed to allow the under-cover storage of carriages and other vehicles at the site. These developments will likely see changes to the current track layout at the site. References * Rail Atlas Great Britain & Ireland, S.K.

Beginning in the early 1990s, it has been a growing field of equine therapy, utilized for both day- to-day riding and post-trauma rehabilitation. Proponents list a number of positive effects, including the improvement of movement and the reduction of pain and stress responses. Scientific study is beginning to demonstrate possible benefits, although more study is needed. Practice Hands-on therapies, including massage, acupressure and joint mobilization, were one of the fastest growing equine therapy categories in the early 1990s. Equine massage uses the hands, fingers and elbows of the therapist, as well as other tools, including tennis balls and vibrating tools. During the massage, the soft tissue is manipulated with the goal of loosening tight muscles, joints, tendons, scar tissue and edema; increasing blood flow and lymphatic activity; and reducing stress. Equine massage is used in exercise warm-up and post- injury or surgery rehabilitation. Scientific study Massage in horses uses many techniques first used for human massage, and it is becoming more common in both competitive equestrian disciplines and pleasure riding. Proponents say that equine massage improves movement and reduces pain and stress responses. Research has shown that massage affects the muscular system at the cellular and fascial levels, as well as physiologic systems. Preliminary research has been conducted that demonstrates possible benefits in exercise recovery, but additional rigorous research is needed to further examine these possibilities. A 2015 study done at Western Kentucky University entitled: \\"Horses' Responses to Receiving The Masterson Method¬Æ of Integrated Equine Performance Bodywork‚Ñ¢ Treatments\\" documents changes in comfort levels after receiving bodywork. Research documentation included pre and post treatment evaluations, the treatments, owner questionnaires, and cribbing observations. Also, all evaluation and treatment sessions were videotaped with the intent of further analysis for changes in range of motion, flexibility, and comfort level as applicable. This research demonstrated that these bodywork sessions may reduce somatic pain and consequently reduce lameness, aggression and possibly cribbing. At the conclusion of this study each horse had an improved attitude, and their individual health issues were diminished. A 2013 study of 20 riding horses examined the differences in equine behavior among horses resting, receiving a massage and receiving a treatment of Tellington TTouchTM Method created by Linda Tellington-Jones. The study determined that the horses receiving TTouch had the highest levels of relaxed and positive behaviors, while the resting horses showed signs of boredom and the horses receiving massage therapy tended to move around more and behave in a less relaxed manner. The scientists who conducted the experiment confirmed that further study of various therapy techniques is needed. Regulation, training and associations In the United States, the legal requirements vary by state and are determined by each state's veterinary board. Presently, some states require veterinary supervision while others do not. Many schools offer certification programs in the areas of animal and companion massage. Some of these schools are approved by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB). The International Association of Animal Massage & Bodywork (IAAMB) is an association of animal massage and bodywork practitioners, including equine massage therapists.

Lifeguards are stationed at 23 beaches on Lake Michigan plus one inland beach, as well as, 26 indoor and 51 outdoor pools at city parks and 15 pools in public schools. The Service is the largest municipal lifeguard force in the world and is regularly observed by representatives from Japan, Australia, Ireland, Germany, California, Florida and other locales. The Service also covers more waterfront than any other individual lifeguard force in the world; Chicago beaches cover over 26 miles of the lakefront.  History  The Chicago Park District was created in 1934 by the Illinois Legislature under the Park Consolidation Act. By provisions of that act, the Chicago Park District consolidated and superseded the then- existing 22 separate park districts in Chicago, the largest three of which were the Lincoln Park, West Park, and South Park Districts, all of which had been established in 1869. Prior to the 1934 consolidation, there were separate lifeguard forces for most of the individual park districts in Chicago. Even after the consolidation, there were some lakefronts and pools operated independently by the City of Chicago itself which maintained a separate lifeguard service for city lakefronts and pools. In 1959, the City of Chicago and the Chicago Park District entered into an agreement whereby all of the City-owned lakefronts and pools would be transferred to the Chicago Park District. During the consolidation efforts, several far-sighted lifeguard supervisors, including George V. Iverson, Tom O'Brien and Joseph Mansfield, began to lay the foundation of what would become the Chicago Park District Lifeguard Service, successfully merging the City of Chicago Lifeguard Service with the Chicago Park District Lifeguard Patrol. Further contributions to the Lifeguard Service were made by Sam Leone who founded the first ever Junior Lifeguard program which was adopted by the United States Lifesaving Association.  Joseph A. Pecoraro  In 1949, he took a summer job as a lifeguard at North Avenue Beach on Lake Michigan and never left except for a two-year stint in the U.S. Army Field Artillery (where he taught swimming to the First Cavalry Division in Tokyo). Mr. Pecoraro spent much of his service at North Avenue Beach. In 1974, he became manager for all of Chicago's beaches and pools, overseeing swimming instruction, scuba instruction, lifeguard recruitment and training. He was president of the United States Lifesaving Association (USLA) (1982‚Äì1991) and continues on its Board of Directors. He travels to public health and safety conferences and among other organizations is a member of Lifesaving Associations of the United States, Ireland, Australia, Germany and F.I.S. (Federational International au Sauvetage). He has authored Chicago's \\"Lifeguard Pamphlet\\" and \\"Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation Pamphlet\\". He is viewed by many current guards to be a role model. Recently Mr. Pecoraro wrote a book detailing his time in the Service, \\"Naked Rescue\\".  Current Lifeguard Practices  Today's Lifeguard Service is run under the Supervision of Mr. Eric Fischer who took over after Janet McDonough retired in 2011. Janet McDonough took over from Mr. Jamie Anderson in 2005. Chicago Park District lifeguards undergo hours of specialized training in Water Rescue, CPR, AED Administration, Oxygen Administration, Spinal Injuries, and First Aid. The training is a combination of American Red Cross and Chicago Park District standards. Each guard must be recertified every year to continue working for the Chicago Park District. Chicago Park District lifeguards used to work from 9 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., but these hours were cut due to budget concerns. Lifeguards now work from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., regardless of sunrise and sunset times. However, Chicago's beaches open at 8 a.m., so these hours leave beachgoers unsupervised in the morning. In July 2018, a 13-year-old girl drowned at Loyola Beach, a District-owned beach. Onlookers cited a lack of lifeguards or floatation devices as reasons for her death. This led to a Change.org petition asking the city to expand lifeguard hours, put up diagrams showing what someone struggling in the water looks like, install more floatation devices at the beaches and require water safety classes in schools. As of October 2018, the petition has more than 2,000 signatures. 49th ward Alderman Joe proposed a task force to begin examining and redesigning the city's safety practices. The Park District did agree to repaint no diving signs to increase clarity, but did not expand lifeguard hours or install floatation devices.

Subsequent to that, for some years he was stationed at Georgetown University, where he served as assistant prefect and professor of French. He was ordained in September 1835. In 1836 he became assistant pastor of Holy Trinity Church in the Georgetown section of Washington, D.C., and in 1838 was transferred as assistant to St. Joseph's Church in Philadelphia. In the spring of 1844, anti-Catholic riots swept Philadelphia. Barbelin was advised to disguise himself and remove to a place of safety. Although St. Michael's and St. Augustine Church were burnt down, St. Joseph's was spared. When some rioters proposed to sack it, their leaders were heard to say, \\"Oh no, that little Frenchman won't hurt anybody\\".

Origin and status The Dominion of Melchizedek was unilaterally declared in 1990 by U.S. citizen Mark Pedley, possibly with his father, David Pedley. Mark Pedley also uses a number of pseudonyms, including \\"Tzemach Ben David Netzer Korem\\" and \\"Branch Vinedresser\\". It borrows its name from the biblical king and priest Melchizedek. When created, the DoM first laid claim to the Colombian island of Malpelo, a small island 300 miles off the Pacific coast of Colombia. Later, it claimed the Karitane Shoal in the South Pacific, which is completely submerged for part of the day; Clipperton Island, an overseas possession of France which lies 1,500 miles west of Nicaragua; and Taongi, otherwise known as Bokak Atoll, an uninhabited Micronesian atoll falling under the administration of the Government of the Marshall Islands. Representatives of the DoM were banned from entering the island of Rotuma after their involvement with dissident groups seeking to secede from Fiji, with whom they had signed agreements to lease land on the islands of Rotuma and its neighbour Solkope. It also claims the portion of Antarctica unclaimed by sovereign states, from 90 degrees to 150 degrees west, known as Marie Byrd Land. It has been described as \\"non- existent\\" by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and as a \\"non- recognised sovereignty\\" by the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. It appears on an EU list of fantasy passports issued by private individuals or organisations. Media reports have described it as a \\"virtual country\\", as a \\"ruse\\", and as a \\"phony country\\". =Marshall Islands statement= In response to one of DoM's territorial claims, the government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands issued the following statement: =Claims of Recognition= On the DoM's official website, they claim a number of nations have recognized their sovereignty, with links to supporting documents. Upon closer examination, a number of these are merely correspondence acknowledging various requests made of these established states, or appear to be responses to offers of financial support. Of the entire list, only one appears to be actual verifiable recognition: from the Central African Republic. According to the Washington Post, the Central African Republic extended diplomatic recognition to the DoM in 1993, but the Post article went on to remark, \\"...you get the feeling that the Central African Republic would recognize the State of Denial if it had a letterhead.\\" An article in the Quatloos! online anti-fraud site noted that: \\"Melchizedek has apparently obtained some sort of recognition from some smaller states ... all of which are notable for their corruption. Claims that the DoM has received recognition from any major government are purely lies.\\" Frauds linked to the Dominion of Melchizedek Soon after its inception, the DoM started selling documents purporting to charter or licence companies. By the end of the 1990s, the DoM claimed that some 300 banking licenses had been sold. DoM apologists have suggested that there is no link between Melchizedek and the illegal activities conducted by \\"banks\\" it has \\"licensed\\"; however, John Shockey, a former special assistant in the office of the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, has stated: > Melchizedek first came to my attention in June 1990, a few months after Mark > Pedley was paroled from a 1986 conviction. Inquiries were received > concerning bank names: Banco de Asia, Guardian Savings & Guaranty and > Express Bank among others. Investigations that these entities had bank > charters from the DOM and obtained through an entity named Consortium > Finance Corporation headquartered in Lake Tahoe, California. Further > investigation disclosed a principal alternately named John Hayden and Branch > Vinedresser. Shortly thereafter the FBI took Branch Vinedresser into custody > and revealed that he was Mark Pedley, who then was charged with violations > of his parole. In the same address Stockey also stated that: \\"The Dominion of Melchizedek is a fraud, a major fraud, and not a legitimate sovereign entity. Persons associated with the Dominion of Melchizedek have been indicted and convicted of a variety of crimes.\\" In 1991, in Washington, D.C, shell banks that were subsidiaries of a Melchizedekian company tried to secure loans from real banks based on fake DoM securities, but were closed down before they succeeded. One of the men involved, Steve Peterson, later pleaded guilty to fraud and theft charges in another case in Arizona after using a company chartered in DoM. In Hong Kong, Gerhard Bacher used cheques issued by phoney Melchizedek banks to open accounts in legitimate Hong Kong banks; he was sentenced to 6 months in prison. In 1995, in the UK, an organisation that was making use of a DoM licensed bank was barred from doing business. A so-called \\"60/40 Investment Programme\\" offered by Credit Bank International, run by Roger Rosemont and registered in the DoM, was a Ponzi scheme that convinced at least 1,400 people to invest over $4,000,000. Companies with links to the DoM have been used in insurance fraud schemes. In Texas in 1996, after pleading guilty to insurance fraud, Jeffrey Reynolds was sentenced to 52 months in prison and ordered to repay $475,802 in premiums he had collected for bogus insurance policies. The companies he was using had been licensed in the DoM. Later in the same year, and also in Texas, Leon Hooten's New Zealand-registered companies were prevented from selling insurance when they were found to be capitalised with worthless assets issued by the DoM. One of the most notorious victims of the scam was businessman Rog√©rio Cavaco Silva, brother of former President of Portugal An√≠bal Cavaco Silva, who in 1996 was conned out of US$ 35,000 which were supposed to guarantee a loan to complete a hotel in the Algarve. Six Portuguese perpetrators, who conned a total of 39 businesspeople (including Cavaco Silva) between 1996 and 1999, were sentenced in 2007 to several periods in prison, the highest of which was six years. The DoM has also been involved in selling passports widely regarded as fraudulent, misrepresenting them as internationally recognised. In 1998, three individuals purporting to be officials of the DoM were arrested in the Philippines. The ringleader, John Gillespie, an Australian felon who was involved in the Fine Cotton horse substitution scam, eluded capture. The passport scam grossed an estimated USD $1,000,000 from after hundreds of individuals, with some paying up to $3,500 for these documents. Across all the purported schemes DoM has been accused of involvement in, one source estimates that the total value of funds raised may exceed USD $500 million. Principal Figures =David Evan Pedley= After being convicted of several financial crimes in the 1970s, including stock fraud, David Pedley was incarcerated. He claims the charges were false and the result of a \\"witch-hunt\\" against him. While incarcerated, he started a cattle business, which his son Mark operated for him in Los Angeles, California. While in Mexican custody Pedley apparently died, though the circumstances are not clear. A closed casket funeral was held in Altadena, California in 1987. At the funeral, FBI agents approached the Pedley family and requested to fingerprint David Pedley's body. This request was denied by the family and allegedly some government regulators believe that Pedley is still alive. Pedley is the co-author, with his son, of the Melchizedek Bible. =Mark Logan Pedley= Mark Logan Pedley (born 19 July 1953), later changed to Mark Wellington, (also known as \\"Tzemach Ben David Netzer Korem\\" and \\"Branch Vinedresser\\"; Branch Vinedresser being a translation of his Hebrew name Tzemach Korem). He is the son of David Pedley and was the Head of the House of Elders, Vice President, and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the DoM. Pedley is the co-author, with his father, of the Melchizedek Bible. In 1983, Pedley was convicted of mail and interstate fraud relating to a land fraud in California and jailed for three years. Shortly after his release, he was again successfully prosecuted in 1986 for a $6 million currency fraud scheme that was operated in 1982-3; he was jailed for eight years and fined $25,000. Having been paroled in 1990, he set up the Dominion of Melchizedek. His parole was revoked in late 1991 due to a violation of his conditions, arising from his promotion of a fictitious country, and was returned to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence. In 1994, following his release, Pedley married Pearlasia Gamboa, who was made president of Melchizedek. In 2010, under the name Tzemach David Netzer Korem, he was charged with, and later pleaded guilty to, share manipulation regarding ZNext Mining. ZNext Mining was investigated by a multi-agency taskforce as part of Operation Broken Trust, a US-wide operation in 2010 that targeted investment fraud. In 2011 he was sentenced to two years in prison; he was released in 2012. =Pearlasia Gamboa= Pearlasia Gamboa was president of the Dominion of Melchizedek. She is married to Mark Pedley. She is a Filipina-American business woman who has been involved in controversial banking and investments. She was prevented from operating companies that were purporting to be banks in Indiana and California. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Gamboa in 2009, alleging that she had used fictitious reports of gold mining operations to profit by fraudulently selling shares, siphoning off more than $1 million. A judgment was ordered against her in August 2010 totaling $1.8 million; a $650,000 fine for the ZNext corporation, and $1.18 million for Gamboa personally. Gamboa was also permanently barred from selling penny stocks. She has not paid the fine and is attempting to have the decision overturned.

It consisted of a round up of stories from the BBC's various local news programmes where it had not initially been possible to show regional variations. The programme was eventually replaced by digital feeds of each regional news service, finishing in 2002. History When the BBC started digital broadcasts, the various English regional versions of BBC One and Two were not available. BBC One carried variants only for Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, whilst no variations were broadcast for BBC2; instead it had been decided to carry four variants of the new BBC Choice. Lack of English variations on Satellite was due to a single broadcast feed being able to cover the entirety of England (in reality it could cover much of north and western Europe) whilst on digital terrestrial it was due to the regional broadcast centres in England not yet being equipped to 'opt in and out' of the digital network when digital terrestrial broadcasts began in 1998. This presented a problem with two obvious solutions - either just show the BBC South East version of the channels (already used as a 'sustaining feed' in case of failure at the regional centres), or create new programming to fill the gaps. The decision was taken to go with the second option, although any non-news programming (such as the regional political slot) was filled by the South East region. Despite the name, UK Today very rarely broadcast to the whole of the UK as BBC One Scotland, BBC One Northern Ireland, and BBC One Wales were available with their own news programming from the very start of digital enjoying their own satellite feeds and being fully equipped for digital terrestrial. Only BBC Two would carry UK Today to the whole of the UK. In 2000, BBC Breakfast, a simulcast programme between BBC One and BBC News 24 was launched. Regional opt-outs on BBC News 24 carried UK Today across the UK. Main bulletins at 1.30pm and 6.30pm were originally broadcast from within the BBC News 24 studio (N8), and simulcast on that channel though the set was later moved to the same studio as the BBC One news bulletins (N6). Gradual demise UK Today was gradually replaced on BBC One as regional centres were upgraded for digital terrestrial broadcasting and the non-England versions of BBC Two went digital on both satellite and terrestrial in 2001, replacing the four regional variants of BBC Choice. In 2002 the satellite version of BBC One England started carrying the London region's programme, BBC London News, although an interactive service did allow viewers to select one of four alternate regional programmes, including South Today and North West Tonight for the main 6.30pm news bulletin. In May 2003 all regional services were made available to satellite viewers by effectively broadcasting seventeen separate feeds of BBC One, one for each region. (see BBC UK regional TV on satellite) Today Due to the minimal regional broadcasting on BBC Two in England, it was not seen as cost-effective to create digital versions of these regions. On satellite, this would have meant as many individual feeds of BBC Two as BBC One whilst in the case of digital terrestrial, a decision to encode all BBC services other than BBC One using the more efficient statistical multiplexing technique made it technically and economically much harder to provide variations without either equipping each regional centre with costly equipment or using the same method as for BBC One and suffering reduced picture quality as a result. Consequently, short BBC London bulletins continued to be broadcast throughout England on BBC Two. In 2004, all regional news bulletins were moved to BBC One and in 2006, the last remaining regional programme, The Super League Show, shown in some northern regions was also moved. Although it was still technically possible for most regions to opt out on analogue, any variation in programming was now rare. The teletext service Ceefax, did still carry regional content on BBC Two until analogue switch-off, however. During the 2006 Commonwealth Games, BBC Breakfast was shown on BBC Two, so regional opt- outs on the digital variant in England were replaced by a newspaper review for digital viewers. During the Wimbledon tennis competitions of 2008, a scheduled news bulletin was moved to BBC Two. As some regions had already switched to digital-only TV, these areas received only BBC London News instead of their local news.

Dok-7 regulates neuromuscular synapse formation by activating MuSK The formation of neuromuscular synapses requires the muscle- specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK). In mice genetically mutant for MuSK, acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) fail to cluster and motor neurons fail to differentiate. Because Dok-7 mutant mice are indistinguishable from MuSK mutant mice, these observations suggest Dok-7 might regulate MuSK activation. Indeed, Dok-7 binds phosphorylated MuSK and activates MuSK in purified protein preparations and in muscle in-vivo by transgenic overexpression. Furthermore, the nerve-derived organizing factor agrin fails to stimulate MuSK activation in muscle cells genetically null for Dok-7. Thus, Dok-7 is both necessary and sufficient for the activation of MuSK. Dok-7 signaling The requirement for MuSK in the formation of the NMJ was primarily demonstrated by mouse \\"knockout\\" studies. In mice which are deficient for either agrin or MuSK, the neuromuscular junction does not form. Upon activation by its ligand agrin, MuSK signals via the proteins called Dok-7 and rapsyn, to induce \\"clustering\\" of acetylcholine receptors (AChR). Cell signaling downstream of MuSK requires Dok-7. Mice which lack this protein fail to develop endplates. Further, forced expression of Dok-7 induces the tyrosine phosphorylation, and thus the activation of MuSK. Dok-7 interacts with MuSK by way of protein \\"domain\\" called a \\"PTB domain.\\" In addition to the AChR, MuSK, and Dok-7 other proteins are then gathered, to form the endplate to the neuromuscular junction. The nerve terminates onto the endplate, forming the neuromuscular junction‚Äîa structure which is required to transmit nerve impulses to the muscle, and thus initiating muscle contraction. Congenital Myasthenia Syndrome Homozygous mutation of Dok-7 is responsible for a form of congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) that is unique among disorders in this category because it affects muscles in the limbs and trunk but mostly spares the face, eyes, and functions of the mouth and pharnyx (chewing, swallowing and speech). Salbutamol can be effective in relieving CMS symptoms attributable to Dok-7 mutations.

Nyg√•rd (n√© Pekka Juhani Nyg√•rd; born July 24, 1941) is a Finnish- Canadian former fashion executive and accused sex trafficker. He was rated the 70th richest Canadian by Canadian Business Magazine in 2009 with a net worth of $817 million. He founded Nyg√•rd International, a company that makes women's apparel, in 1967. He resigned as chairman in 2020 after FBI raided company headquarters in its investigation of sex trafficking accusations against him by multiple women. Early life and education Nyg√•rd was born in Helsinki, Finland in 1941. His parents were Eeli and Hilkka Nyg√•rd, bakers who immigrated to Canada in 1952, settling at first in Deloraine, Manitoba (where Nyg√•rd Park would later be named in his honour in 2002). They moved shortly after to Winnipeg. In 1964, he graduated from the University of North Dakota with a business degree. Tan Jay On December 1, 1967, Nyg√•rd started working as sales manager for a new jeans line of a woman's clothing manufacturer Jacob Fashions. A few weeks later Nyg√•rd used his life savings of $8,000 and an additional loan to purchase 20% of the company from the founder Nathan Jacob. A few years later, Nyg√•rd bought the rest of the company from Jacob's daughters and renamed it Tan Jay. Nyg√•rd International Nyg√•rd apparel manufacturing company was founded in 1967 in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Its Canada headquarters is now in Toronto, Ontario with its world headquarters in Times Square, New York. Nyg√•rd's fashion concept retail store opened in Times Square in Manhattan on Friday, November 6, 2009. On February 25, 2020, Nyg√•rd stepped down as chairman of Nyg√•rd International, after their headquarters were raided in connection to sex trafficking claims. The company filed for Chapter 15 Bankruptcy in New York on March 18, 2020 and a Manitoba judge has ordered a group of Nyg√•rd companies into receivership on March 19, 2020. On April 30, 2020, A Canadian judge has given the green light to an accounting firm to sell and liquidate part of the business empire. Nyg√•rd Cay In 1987, Nyg√•rd built a compound at Lyford Cay in the Bahamas. It was partly destroyed by a fire on November 10, 2009.\\"Fire destroys Nygard's Bahamas compound\\", Winnipeg Free Press, November 10, 2009 The Cay is inspired by the Mayan civilization‚Äôs architecture. One of the major buildings is a grand-hall with a glass ceiling. On April 14, 2010, Nyg√•rd announced he was planning a $50 million renovation of Nyg√•rd Cay, which would take two years to complete and repair the damage and employ 200 construction workers. But a letter from the Bahamian prime minister's office rejected his construction application, citing the improper expansion of his property through intentional accretion of land over the seabed. Numerous famous figures have visited Nygard Cay over the years including Michael Jackson, George H. W. Bush, Robert De Niro, and Prince Andrew, Duke of York. And the house has been featured on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. The house has been described as a resort with guests paying $42,000 a night in 2009 to stay there. On September 28, 2018, Nyg√•rd Cay was seized by the Supreme Court of the Bahamas as part of a legal battle surrounding Nyg√•rd‚Äôs efforts to dredge the sea floor around the estate. Charity Peter Nyg√•rd with fashion model Nicole Midwin at the Breast Cancer Awareness Show, 2017 Nyg√•rd has supported the Canadian Breast Cancer Foundation. Nyg√•rd has been a longtime sponsor of amateur sports in the Bahamas. In June 2010, he was the main sponsor of Amateur Boxing Federation of the Bahamas' team for Continental Elite Boxing Championships invitation-only event in Quito, Ecuador. Wellington Miller, the president of the Bahamas Olympic Committee, said Nyg√•rd has contributed significantly to the Amateur Boxing Association of the Bahamas and their Olympic success. In April 2011, Nyg√•rd held the \\"2011 National Family Island Regatta\\" at Nyg√•rd Cay, which included a press conference to honor Bahamian musician \\"King\\" Eric Gibson. In the same month, Nyg√•rd also donated $10,000 to Josie Poitier, a member of Old Holy Redeemer Catholic Church, during a Passover/Good Friday Breakfast/Brunch. Lawsuits Nyg√•rd has been accused of abusive labor practices, tax evasion, sexual harassment, sex trafficking (including Child sex trafficking), and rape. *In 1978, Nyg√•rd's takeover of a sportswear designer's business in New York City led to a 12-year legal battle in New York federal court. *In 1980, the Free Press wrote that Nyg√•rd was charged with the rape of an 18-year-old girl by Winnipeg authorities. Later those charges were stayed because the girl refused to testify. It was later claimed in a lawsuit that Nyg√•rd used funds from his companies to pay her off.30-FIRST-AMENDED-COMPLAINT- amending-1-Complaint-against-Peter-J-Nygard-Nygard-Holdings-Limited-Nyga-Does- No.-1-10-v.-Nygard-et-00530195xE6B76.pdf *Nyg√•rd settled sexual harassment complaints by three former employees in Manitoba in the late 1990s. *In 1999, Nyg√•rd sued Linda Lampenius for defamation concerning her comments about Nyg√•rd's parties with naked women. The case continued until 2001 when Lampenius states she ran out of funds and had to settle, which consisted of publishing an apology in the newspaper Ilta-Sanomat. *In 2003, Nyg√•rd was sued in Florida by an American couple who claimed he deceived them into accepting jobs as managers of his Bahamas estate. The case was settled in 2007. *In 2005, after Finnish newspaper Iltalehti published an article about sex parties at Nyg√•rd's mansion, even featuring a short interview with Jessica Alba where she had to leave a party at the Nyg√•rd Cay mansion (she was there filming Into the Blue) because of the debauchery with young women going on, Nyg√•rd sued the parent company of the paper Alma Media for slander in Los Angeles. Nyg√•rd lost the case. *In 2006, Canadian tax authorities claimed Nyg√•rd underreported $15 million in taxes. Nyg√•rd argued that he severed residential ties with Canada in 1975; he was ultimately subject to taxes on an unreported $2 million. *In 2007, a dispute escalated into a battle royal encompassing no fewer than 16 legal actions between Nyg√•rd and Louis Bacon and their associates, in which both sides are claiming damages in the tens of millions of dollars and lobbing allegations of activities that include vandalism, bribery, insider trading, arson, murder, destruction of the fragile seabed, and having a close association with the Ku Klux Klan. *In 2008, Nyg√•rd was sued in Los Angeles Superior Court by a former girlfriend for slamming a door on her hand. Nyg√•rd quickly settled the lawsuit. *In 2012, Nyg√•rd launched a lawsuit against the CBC regarding copyright issues about private videos taken at his residence, which were then used in an April 2010 documentary. He had also launched a copyright complaint with the US District Court in New York and a lawsuit in Manitoba to prevent the piece from airing. He had previously sued two former employees for releasing confidential information and his lawyer claimed CBC harassed many of the employees. Nyg√•rd launched a civil suit against his neighbor and the Lyford Cay Property Owners Association alleging they conspired with the CBC to damage his reputation; he also filed a private criminal prosecution against three CBC journalists accusing them of conspiring to discredit him and his clothing empire. *In 2015 and 2017 Nyg√•rd was looked at by FBI over claims of sex trafficking. He was also investigated by the United States Department of Homeland Security for 9 months in 2016. *The Paradise Papers showed that Nyg√•rd was a shareholder of a offshore company in the Cayman Islands. https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/80134557 *In 2018, Nyg√•rd Cay was seized by the Supreme Court of the Bahamas as part of a legal battle surrounding Nyg√•rd's efforts to dredge the sea floor around the estate. *In 2019, a warrant was issued after Nyg√•rd failed to appear in court multiple times for a sentencing hearing related to two contempt of court convictions in the Bahamas. *In September 2019, the New York Times was caught up in the feud between Nyg√•rd and Louis Bacon. The suit claims that the reporters for the paper \\"tried to steer the individuals to provide information to fit a story\\" and that reporters wanted to \\"bring down\\" Nyg√•rd. *On November 15, 2019, a judge in the Bahamas sentenced Nyg√•rd to 90 days in prison and fined him $150,000 after finding he breached a court order prohibiting the disclosure of emails that were stolen from a non-profit group. *On November 24, 2019, Bahamas police began investigating six allegations of rape made against Nyg√•rd. All the alleged victims were under 16. *On January 27, 2020, Nyg√•rd faced two separate lawsuits after being accused of sexual assault. *On February 13, 2020, 10 women filed a class action against Nyg√•rd in New York, alleging that he had raped them at his Bahamas residence. They also alleged he maintained a sex-trafficking ring. Eight of the alleged victims were underaged. *On February 25, 2020, the New York headquarters of Nyg√•rd International were raided by the FBI and NYPD, in connection with sex trafficking claims. This led to Nyg√•rd stepping down from the company. *On April 22, 2020 36 new women joined a sex assault suit that was filed in February 2020. *On August 17, 2020 Nyg√•rd was sued by two of his sons on accusations of directing a known sex worker said to be \\"his girlfriend\\" to rape them. Feud with Louis Bacon In 2005 Nygard attempted to solve a parking overflow problem at Nygard cay by laying down a 15-by-20-foot concrete slab on Bacon's property. Bacon responded to this suing Nygard and obtaining a court injunction to remove it. Two years later in 2007 Bacon installed industrial-grade speakers at the edge of his property and pointed them at Nygard's house at night due to Bacon's complaints of noise at Nygard's house. In summer 2010 Bacon's house was raided by 11 Bahamian police officers, leading to the confiscation of the speakers, Bacon claimed it was the work of Nygard, a claim he denied. It has been said Nygard used his employees used Fake News sites and YouTube videos to smear Bacon as a person who ran an international drug-smuggling operation, as a person a member of the K.K.K., that Bacon been charged with Insider trading and that he was involved in murdering the Point House caretaker, Dan Tuckfield after commissioning him to set the fire at Nygard Cay. (Truckfield actually died of a heart attack.) In January 2015 Bacon filed a defamation lawsuit against Nygard over these claims. Personal life Nyg√•rd Family in 2004 Nyg√•rd was briefly married to Carol Knight in the 1970s. Nyg√•rd is said to have dated Anna Nicole Smith from 1998 to 2001. Nyg√•rd has seven children with four women.  Honors  In 2012 Nyg√•rd was awarded a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.

The planet was discovered orbiting the Sun-like star 16 Cygni B, one of two solar-mass () components of the triple star system 16 Cygni in 1996. It orbits its star once every 799 days and was the first eccentric Jupiter and planet in a double star system to be discovered. The planet is abundant in Lithium. Discovery In October 1996 the discovery of a planetary-mass companion to the star 16 Cygni B was announced, with a mass at least 1.68 times that of Jupiter (). At the time, it had the highest orbital eccentricity of any known planet. The discovery was made by measuring the star's radial velocity. As the inclination of the orbit cannot be directly measured and as no dynamic model of the system was then published, only a lower limit on the mass could then be determined. Orbit The orbit of 16 Cygni Bb (black) compared to the inner planets in the Solar System. Unlike the planets in the Solar System, the planet's orbit is highly elliptical, and its distance varies from 0.54 AU at periastron to 2.8 AU at apastron. This high eccentricity may have been caused by tidal interactions in the binary star system, and the planet's orbit may vary chaotically between low and high-eccentricity states over a period of tens of millions of years. Preliminary astrometric measurements in 2001 suggested the orbit of 16 Cygni Bb may be highly inclined with respect to our line of sight (at around 173¬∞). This would mean the object's mass may be around ; the dividing line between planets and brown dwarfs is at . However these measurements were later proved useful only for upper limits. Physical characteristics Because the planet has only been detected indirectly by measurements of its parent star, properties such as its radius, composition and temperature are unknown. A mathematical study in 2012 showed that a mass of about would be most stable in this system. This would make the body a true planet. The planet's highly eccentric orbit means the planet would experience extreme seasonal effects. Despite this, simulations suggest that an Earth-like moon, should it have formed in an orbit so close to the parent star, would be able to support liquid water at its surface for part of the year.

This includes general criticism about a lack of internal consistency, criticism related to historical materialism, that it is a type of historical determinism, the necessity of suppression of individual rights, issues with the implementation of communism and economic issues such as the distortion or absence of price signals and reduced incentives. In addition, empirical and epistemological problems are frequently identified.  General criticism  Democratic socialists and social democrats reject the idea that societies can achieve socialism only through class conflict and a proletarian revolution. Many anarchists reject the need for a transitory state phase. Some thinkers have rejected the fundamentals of Marxist theory such as historical materialism and the labour theory of value and have gone on to criticise capitalism and advocate socialism using other arguments. Some contemporary supporters of Marxism see many aspects of Marxist thought as viable, but they contend that the corpus is incomplete or somewhat outdated in regard to certain aspects of economic, political or social theory. They may therefore combine some Marxist concepts with the ideas of other theorists such as Max Weber‚Äîthe Frankfurt School provides one example of this approach. Historian Paul Johnson wrote: \\"The truth is, even the most superficial inquiry into Marx's use of evidence forces one to treat with skepticism everything he wrote which relies on factual data\\". For example, Johnson stated: \\"The whole of the key Chapter Eight of Capital is a deliberate and systematic falsification to prove a thesis which an objective examination of the facts showed was untenable\\".Johnson, Paul (2007) [1988]. Intellectuals From Marx and Tolstoy to Sartre and Chomsky by Paul Johnson (revised ed.). Perennial. .  Historical materialism  Historical materialism remains one of the intellectual bases of Marxism. It proposes that technological advances in modes of production inevitably lead to changes in the social relations of production. This economic \\"base\\" of society supports, is reflected by and influences the ideological \\"superstructure\\" which encompasses culture, religion, politics, and all other aspects of humanity's social consciousness. It thus looks for the causes of developments and changes in human history in economic, technological and, more broadly, material factors as well as the clashes of material interests among tribes, social classes, and nations. Law, politics, the arts, literature, morality and religion are understood by Marx to make up the superstructure as reflections of the economic base of society. Many critics have argued that this is an oversimplification of the nature of society and claim that the influence of ideas, culture and other aspects of what Marx called the superstructure are just as important as the economic base to the course of society, if not more so. However, Marxism does not claim that the economic base of society is the only determining element in society as demonstrated by the following letter written by Friedrich Engels, Marx's long- time contributor: > According to the materialist conception of history, the ultimately > determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real > life. More than this neither Marx nor I ever asserted. Hence if somebody > twists this into saying that the economic element is the only determining > one he transforms that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, senseless > phrase.Marx, Karl and Friedrich Engels. Selected Correspondence. p. 498 However, this also creates another problem for Marxism. If the superstructure also influences the base then there is no need for Marx's constant assertions that the history of society is one of economic class conflict. This then becomes a classic chicken or the egg argument as to whether the base or the superstructure comes first. Peter Singer proposes that the way to solve this problem is to understand that Marx saw the economic base as ultimately real. Marx believed that humanity's defining characteristic was its means of production and thus the only way for man to free himself from oppression was for him to take control of the means of production. According to Marx, this is the goal of history and the elements of the superstructure act as tools of history. Even if Singer's interpretation of Marx's intuitions on the \\"goal of history\\" is faithful to Marx's original intent, that still would not make this viewpoint necessarily true. Murray Rothbard criticized historical materialism as well, arguing that Marx claimed the \\"base\\" of society (its technology and social relations) determined its \\"consciousness\\" in the superstructure, yet, building on the arguments of Ludwig von Mises, Rothbard holds that it is human consciousness which drives the development of technology and social relations. Rothbard argues that Marx ignores how the base arises, which obscures that the true causal path is from the superstructure to the base, as human beings determine the development of technology and the social relations they wish to pursue. Rothbard quotes von Mises, who states \\"We may summarize the Marxian doctrine in this way: In the beginning there are the 'material productive forces', i.e., the technological equipment of human productive efforts, the tools and machines. No question concerning their origin is permitted; they are, that is all; we must assume that they are dropped from heaven.\\"Murray Rothabrd (1995), An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought, Volume 2, Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd, Chapter 12, pp.372-374,  Historical determinism  Marx's theory of history has been considered a variant of historical determinism linked to his reliance on dialectical materialism as an endogenous mechanism for social change. Marx wrote: > At a certain stage of development, the material productive forces of society > come into conflict with the existing relations of production or ‚Äì this > merely expresses the same thing in legal terms ‚Äì with the property relations > within the framework of which they have operated hitherto. From forms of > development of the productive forces these relations turn into their > fetters. Then begins an era of social revolution. The changes in the > economic foundation lead sooner or later to the transformation of the whole > immense superstructure. The concept of the dialectic emerged from the dialogues of the ancient Greek philosophers, but it was brought out by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel in the early 19th century as a conceptual framework for the often opposing forces of historical evolution. Historical determinism has also been associated with scholars like Arnold Toynbee and Oswald Spengler, but in recent times this conceptual approach has fallen into disuse. Terry Eagleton writes that Marx's writings \\"should not be taken to mean that everything that has ever happened is a matter of class struggle. It means, rather, that class struggle is most fundamental to human history\\".Why Marx is Right? page 34 Academic Peter Stillman believes Marx's status as a determinist is a \\"myth\\".Marx:Myths and Legends Friedrich Engels himself warned about conceiving of Marx's ideas as deterministic, saying: \\"According to the materialist conception of history, the ultimately determining element in history is the production and reproduction of real life. Other than this neither Marx nor I have ever asserted. Hence if somebody twists this into saying that the economic element is the only determining one, he transforms that proposition into a meaningless, abstract, senseless phrase.\\" On another occasion, Engels remarked that \\"younger people sometimes lay more stress on the economic side than is due to it\\". While historical materialism has been referred to as a materialist theory of history, Marx does not claim to have produced a master-key to history and that the materialist conception of history is not \\"an historico- philosophic theory of the marche generale, imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself\\". In a letter to editor of the Russian newspaper paper Otetchestvennye Zapiskym (1877), he explains that his ideas are based upon a concrete study of the actual conditions in Europe.Marx, Karl; Engels, Friedrich (1968) [1877]. \\"Letter from Marx to Editor of the Otecestvenniye Zapisky\\". Marx and Engels Correspondence. New York: International Publishers. Retrieved 11 July 2020 ‚Äì via Marxists Internet Archive. In an effort to reassert this approach to an understanding of the forces of history, Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar criticised what he considers narrow conceptual basis of Marx's ideas on historical evolution. In the 1978 book The Downfall of Capitalism and Communism, Ravi Batra pointed out crucial differences in the historical determinist approaches of Sarkar and Marx: > Sarkar's main concern with the human element is what imparts universality to > his thesis. Thus while social evolution according to Marx is governed > chiefly by economic conditions, to Sarkar this dynamic is propelled by > forces varying with time and space: sometimes physical prowess and high- > spiritedness, sometimes intellect applied to dogmas and sometimes intellect > applied to the accumulation of capital (p. 38).

Suppression of individual rights  Mao Zedong with Joseph Stalin in 1949; both of them created totalitarian governments that suppressed individual rights Various thinkers have argued that a communist state would by its very nature erode the rights of its citizens due to the postulated violent revolution and dictatorship of proletariat, its collectivist nature, reliance on \\"the masses\\" rather than individuals, historical determinism and centrally planned economy. The American neoclassical economist Milton Friedman argued that under socialism the absence of a free market economy would inevitably lead to an authoritarian political regime. Friedman's view was also shared by Friedrich Hayek, who also believed that capitalism is a precondition for freedom to flourish in a nation state. Some liberal theorists argue that any redistribution of property is a form of coercion. Daniel De Leon countered this by stating: \\"Capitalism is a fraud within a fraud. Proclaiming itself individualistic, it organizes collectively in order to promote the aims of a few. Socialism, on the other hand, [...] would secure to labor the products of its toil, now confiscated by the few, and, in this way, preserve to the workers, the majority of the population, a greater individuality than that which they now attain\\". Anarchists have also argued that centralized communism will inevitably lead to coercion and state domination. Mikhail Bakunin believed Marxist regimes would lead to the \\"despotic control of the populace by a new and not at all numerous aristocracy\\". Even if this new aristocracy were to have originated from among the ranks of the proletariat, Bakunin argued that their new-found power would fundamentally change their view of society and thus lead them to \\"look down at the plain working masses\\".  Economic  Marxian economics have been criticized for a number of reasons. Some critics point to the Marxian analysis of capitalism while others argue that the economic system proposed by Marxism is unworkable.Shleifer, Andrei, and Robert Vishny. Pervasive shortages under socialism. No. w3791. National Bureau of Economic Research, 1991.Stringham, Edward Peter. \\"Kaldor-Hicks efficiency and the problem of central planning.\\" (2001). There are also doubts that the rate of profit in capitalism would tend to fall as Marx predicted. In 1961, Marxian economist Nobuo Okishio devised a theorem (Okishio's theorem) showing that if capitalists pursue cost-cutting techniques and if the real wage does not rise, the rate of profit must rise.M.C. Howard and J.E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929‚Äì1990, chapter 7, sects. II‚ÄìIV. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press. = Labor theory of value = The labor theory of value is one of the most commonly criticized core tenets of Marxism. The Austrian School argues that this fundamental theory of classical economics is false and prefers the subsequent and modern subjective theory of value put forward by Carl Menger in his book Principles of Economics. The Austrian School was not alone in criticizing the Marxian and classical belief in the labor theory of value. British economist Alfred Marshall attacked Marx, saying: \\"It is not true that the spinning of yarn in a factory [...] is the product of the labour of the operatives. It is the product of their labour, together with that of the employer and subordinate managers, and of the capital employed\\".Bucholz, Todd. New Ideas from Dead Economists. New York: A Plume Book. 1998. pp. 166‚Äì67. Marshall points to the capitalist as sacrificing the money he could be using now for investment in business, which ultimately produces work. By this logic, the capitalist contributes to the work and productivity of the factory because he delays his gratification through investment. Through the law of supply and demand, Marshall attacked Marxian theory of value. According to Marshall, price or value is determined not just by supply, but by the demand of the consumer. Labor does contribute to cost, but so do the wants and needs of consumers. The shift from labor being the source of all value to subjective individual evaluations creating all value undermines Marx's economic conclusions and some of his social theories.Ludwig Von Mises. \\"Socialism: An Economic and Sociological Analysis\\" 2nd Ed. Trans. J. Kahane. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1951. pp. 111‚Äì222. Shimshon Bichler and Jonathan Nitzan argue that most studies purporting to show empirical evidence of the labor theory of value often make methodological errors by comparing the total labor value to total price of multiple economic sectors, which results in a strong overall correlation but this is a statistical exaggeration; the authors argue that the correlations between labor value and price in each sector are often very small if not insignificant. Bichler and Nitzan also argue that because it is difficult to quantify a way to measure abstract labor, researchers are forced to make assumptions.Cockshott, Paul, Shimshon Bichler, and Jonathan Nitzan. \\"Testing the labour theory of value: An exchange.\\" (2010): 1-15.Nitzan, Jonathan, and Shimshon Bichler. Capital as power: A study of order and creorder. Routledge, 2009, pp.93-97, 138-144 However, Bichler and Nitzan argue these assumptions involve circular reasoning: = Distorted or absent price signals = The economic calculation problem is a criticism of socialist economics or, more precisely, of centralized socialist planned economies. It was first proposed by Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises in 1920 and later expounded by Friedrich Hayek.F.A. Hayek, (1935), \\"The Nature and History of the Problem\\" and \\"The Present State of the Debate,\\" om in F.A. Hayek, ed. Collectivist Economic Planning, pp. 1‚Äì40, 201‚Äì43. The problem referred to is that of how to distribute resources rationally in an economy. The free market solution is the price mechanism, wherein people individually have the ability to decide how a good should be distributed based on their willingness to give money for it. The price conveys embedded information about the abundance of resources as well as their desirability which in turn allows on the basis of individual consensual decisions corrections that prevent shortages and surpluses. Mises and Hayek argued that this is the only possible solution and, without the information provided by market prices, socialism lacks a method to rationally allocate resources. The debate raged in the 1920s and 1930s and that specific period of the debate has come to be known by economic historians as the socialist calculation debate. In practice, socialist states like the Soviet Union used mathematical techniques to determine and set prices with mixed results.Nove, A., & Nuti, D.M. (1972). eds., Socialist Economics. Selected Readings. = Reduced incentives = Some critics of socialism argue that income sharing reduces individual incentives to work and therefore incomes should be individualised as much as possible.Zoltan J. Acs & Bernard Young. Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the Global Economy. University of Michigan Press, p. 47, 1999. Critics of socialism have argued that in any society where everyone holds equal wealth there can be no material incentive to work because one does not receive rewards for work well done. They further argue that incentives increase productivity for all people and that the loss of those effects would lead to stagnation. In Principles of Political Economy (1848), John Stuart Mill said: > It is the common error of Socialists to overlook the natural indolence of > mankind; their tendency to be passive, to be the slaves of habit, to persist > indefinitely in a course once chosen. Let them once attain any state of > existence which they consider tolerable, and the danger to be apprehended is > that they will thenceforth stagnate; will not exert themselves to improve, > and by letting their faculties rust, will lose even the energy required to > preserve them from deterioration. Competition may not be the best > conceivable stimulus, but it is at present a necessary one, and no one can > foresee the time when it will not be indispensable to progress.Mill, John > Stuart. The Principles of Political Economy, Book IV, Chapter 7. However, he later altered his views and became more sympathetic to socialism, particularly Fourierism, adding chapters to his Principles of Political Economy in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes. Within this revised work, he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system. Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained, albeit in a slightly toned-down form. The economist John Kenneth Galbraith has criticised communal forms of socialism that promote egalitarianism in terms of wages or compensation as unrealistic in its assumptions about human motivation: > This hope [that egalitarian reward would lead to a higher level of > motivation], one that spread far beyond Marx, has been shown by both history > and human experience to be irrelevant. For better or worse, human beings do > not rise to such heights. Generations of socialists and socially oriented > leaders have learned this to their disappointment and more often to their > sorrow. The basic fact is clear: the good society must accept men and women > as they are.John Kenneth Galbraith, The Good Society: The Humane Agenda > (Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Co., 1996), pp. 59‚Äì60. Edgar Hardcastle responds to this by saying: \\"They want to work and need no more inducement than is given by the knowledge that work must be done to keep society going, and that they are playing their part in it along with their fellow men and women.\\" He continues by criticising what he sees are the double standards of anti-socialists: \\"Notice how they object to the unemployed receiving a miserly dole without having to work, but never object to the millionaires (most of them in that position through inheritance) being able to live in luxurious idleness.\\" Authors like Arnold Petersen argue that arguments such as these are inaccurate as hunter-gatherers practiced primitive communism without problems such as these.Petersen, Arnold (November 2005). \\"Socialism and Human Nature\\".

In other words, the critics allege that Marx drew conclusions that actually do not follow from his theoretical premises. Once those errors are corrected, Marx's conclusion that aggregate price and profit are determined by‚Äîand equal to‚Äîaggregate value and surplus value no longer holds true. This result calls into question his theory that the exploitation of workers is the sole source of profit.M.C. Howard and J.E. King. (1992) A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929‚Äì1990, chapter 12, sect. III. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press. The inconsistency allegations have been a prominent feature of Marxian economics and the debate surrounding it since the 1970s.See M. C. Howard and J.E. King, 1992, A History of Marxian Economics: Volume II, 1929‚Äì1990. Princeton, NJ: Princeton Univ. Press. Andrew Kliman argues that since internally inconsistent theories cannot possibly be right, this undermines Marx's critique of political economy and current-day research based upon it as well as the correction of Marx's alleged inconsistencies.Kliman states that \\"Marx‚Äôs value theory would be necessarily wrong if it were internally inconsistent. Internally inconsistent theories may be appealing, intuitively plausible and even obvious, and consistent with all available empirical evidence ‚Äì but they cannot be right. It is necessary to reject them or correct them. Thus the alleged proofs of inconsistency trump all other considerations, disqualifying Marx‚Äôs theory at the starting gate. By doing so, they provide the principal justification for the suppression of this theory as well as the suppression of, and the denial of resources needed to carry out, present-day research based upon it. This greatly inhibits its further development. So does the very charge of inconsistency. What person of intellectual integrity would want to join a research program founded on (what he believes to be) a theory that is internally inconsistent and therefore false?\\" (Andrew Kliman, Reclaiming Marx's \\"Capital\\": A Refutation of the Myth of Inconsistency, Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2007, p. 3, emphasis in original). The connection between the inconsistency allegations and the lack of study of Marx‚Äôs theories was argued further by John Cassidy (\\"The Return of Karl Marx,\\" The New Yorker, 20‚Äì27 October 1997, p. 252): \\"His mathematical model of the economy, which depended on the idea that labor is the source of all value, was riven with internal inconsistencies and is rarely studied these days.\\" Critics who have alleged that Marx has been proved internally inconsistent include former and current Marxian and/or Sraffian economists, such as Paul Sweezy,\\"Only one conclusion is possible, namely, that the Marxian method of transformation [of commodity values into prices of production] is logically unsatisfactory.\\" Paul M.

Proponents of the temporal single system interpretation (TSSI) of Marx's value theory, like Kliman, claim that the supposed inconsistencies are actually the result of misinterpretation and argue that when Marx's theory is understood as \\"temporal\\" and \\"single-system\\", the alleged internal inconsistencies disappear. In a recent survey of the debate, Kliman concludes that \\"the proofs of inconsistency are no longer defended; the entire case against Marx has been reduced to the interpretive issue\\".Andrew Kliman, Reclaiming Marx's \\"Capital\\", Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, p. 208, emphases in original. = Relevance = Marxism has been criticized as irrelevant, with many economists rejecting its core tenets and assumptions.Leiter, B.

John Maynard Keynes referred to Capital as \\"an obsolete textbook which I know to be not only scientifically erroneous but without interest or application for the modern world\\".John Maynard Keynes. Essays in Persuasion. W.W. Norton & Company. 1991. p. 300 . According to George Stigler, \\"Economists working in the Marxian-Sraffian tradition represent a small minority of modern economists, and that their writings have virtually no impact upon the professional work of most economists in major English-language universities\\". In a review of the first edition of The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics, Robert Solow criticized it for overemphasizing the importance of Marxism in modern economics: > Marx was an important and influential thinker, and Marxism has been a > doctrine with intellectual and practical influence. The fact is, however, > that most serious English-speaking economists regard Marxist economics as an > irrelevant dead end. A 2006 nationally representative survey of American professors found 3% of them identify as Marxists. The share rises to 5% in the humanities and is about 18% among social scientists.Gross, Neil, and Solon Simmons. \\"The social and political views of American professors.\\" Working Paper presented at a Harvard University Symposium on Professors and Their Politics. 2007.  Social  Social criticism is based on the assertion that the Marxian conception of society is fundamentally flawed.Mirowsky, John. \\"Wage slavery or creative work?.\\" Society and mental health 1.2 (2011): 73‚Äì88. The Marxist stages of history, class analysis and theory of social evolution have been criticised. Jean-Paul Sartre concluded that \\"class\\" was not a homogenous entity and could never mount a revolution, but continued to advocate Marxist beliefs. Marx himself admitted that his theory could not explain the internal development of the Asiatic social system, where much of the world's population lived for thousands of years.Conquest, Robert (2000) Reflections on a Ravaged Century. W.W. Norton & Company. pp. 47‚Äì51.  Epistemological  Arguments against Marxism are often based on epistemological reasoning. Specifically, various critics have contended that Marx or his adherents have a flawed approach to epistemology. According to Leszek Ko≈Çakowski, the laws of dialectics at the very base of Marxism are fundamentally flawed: some are \\"truisms with no specific Marxist content\\", others \\"philosophical dogmas that cannot be proved by scientific means\\", yet others just \\"nonsense\\". Some Marxist \\"laws\\" are vague and can be interpreted differently, but these interpretations generally fall into one of the aforementioned categories of flaws as well. However, Ralph Miliband countered that Kolakowski had a flawed understanding of Marxism and its relation to Leninism and Stalinism. In Defence of Marx's Labour Theory of Value Economist Thomas Sowell wrote in 1985: > What Marx accomplished was to produce such a comprehensive, dramatic, and > fascinating vision that it could withstand innumerable empirical > contradictions, logical refutations, and moral revulsions at its effects. > The Marxian vision took the overwhelming complexity of the real world and > made the parts fall into place, in a way that was intellectually > exhilarating and conferred such a sense of moral superiority that opponents > could be simply labelled and dismissed as moral lepers or blind > reactionaries. Marxism was ‚Äì and remains ‚Äì a mighty instrument for the > acquisition and maintenance of political power.Sowell, Thomas Marxism > Philosophy and Economics (William Morrow 1985) p. 218. Many notable academics such as Karl Popper, David Prychitko, Robert C. Allen, and Francis Fukuyama argue that many of Marx's predictions have failed.\\"The End of History?\\" Francis Fukuyama.Allen, R.C. (2017). The industrial revolution: a very short introduction (Vol. 509). Oxford University Press p. 80. Marx predicted that wages would tend to depreciate and that capitalist economies would suffer worsening economic crises leading to the ultimate overthrow of the capitalist system. The socialist revolution would occur first in the most advanced capitalist nations and once collective ownership had been established then all sources of class conflict would disappear. Instead of Marx's predictions, communist revolutions took place in undeveloped regions in Latin America and Asia instead of industrialized countries like the United States or the United Kingdom. Popper has argued that both the concept of Marx's historical method as well as its application are unfalsifiable and thus it is a pseudoscience that cannot be proven true or false: > The Marxist theory of history, in spite of the serious efforts of some of > its founders and followers, ultimately adopted this soothsaying practice. In > some of its earlier formulations (for example in Marx's analysis of the > character of the 'coming social revolution') their predictions were > testable, and in fact falsified. Yet instead of accepting the refutations > the followers of Marx re-interpreted both the theory and the evidence in > order to make them agree. In this way they rescued the theory from > refutation; but they did so at the price of adopting a device which made it > irrefutable. They thus gave a 'conventionalist twist' to the theory; and by > this stratagem they destroyed its much advertised claim to scientific > status. Popper believed that Marxism had been initially scientific, in that Marx had postulated a theory which was genuinely predictive. When Marx's predictions were not in fact borne out, Popper argues that the theory was saved from falsification by the addition of ad hoc hypotheses which attempted to make it compatible with the facts. By this means, a theory which was initially genuinely scientific degenerated into pseudoscientific dogma. Popper agreed on the general non-falsifiability of the social sciences, but instead used it as an argument against central planning and all-encompassing historiographical ideologies. Popper devoted much attention to dissecting the practice of using the dialectic in defence of Marxist thought, which was the very strategy employed by V.A. Lektorsky in his defence of Marxism against Popper's criticisms. Among Popper's conclusions was that Marxists used dialectic as a method of side-stepping and evading criticisms, rather than actually answering or addressing them: > Hegel thought that philosophy develops; yet his own system was to remain the > last and highest stage of this development and could not be superseded. The > Marxists adopted the same attitude towards the Marxian system. Hence, Marx's > anti-dogmatic attitude exists only in the theory and not in the practice of > orthodox Marxism, and dialectic is used by Marxists, following the example > of Engels' Anti-D√ºhring, mainly for the purposes of apologetics ‚Äì to defend > the Marxist system against criticism. As a rule critics are denounced for > their failure to understand the dialectic, or proletarian science, or for > being traitors. Thanks to dialectic the anti-dogmatic attitude has > disappeared, and Marxism has established itself as a dogmatism which is > elastic enough, by using its dialectic method, to evade any further attack. > It has thus become what I have called reinforced dogmatism. Bertrand Russell has criticized as unscientific Marx's belief in progress as a universal law. Russell stated: \\"Marx professed himself an atheist, but retained a cosmic optimism which only theism could justify\\".Russell, Bertrand History of Western Philosophy Simon and Schuster pp. 788‚Äì89. Marxists like Thomas Riggins have claimed that Russell misrepresented Marx's ideas.

Early life Gyula Grosics was born 4 February 1926 in Dorog, Hungary. Growing up, his mother encouraged him to be a priest. Instead, Grosics began his professional football career in Dorog, playing for Dorogi B√°ny√°sz in 1943. During World War II, he briefly fought for the Axis and was captured by American forces. Career In 1947, Grosics made his debut with the Hungary national football team. With the rather shortGoalkeepers who belied their size - FIFA Grosics in the goal, the team started an unbeaten streak in 1948 that would last until the 1954 FIFA World Cup. In 1949, he attempted to defect and was caught. He was charged with espionage and treason by the secret service and placed under house arrest. The charges were eventually dropped due to lack of evidence, but Grosics was banned from the national team for two years. However, after a year he returned to the national team. He also joined the Budapest Honv√©d FC in 1950. In 1952, Grosics led the team to Olympic gold. In 1953, Hungary beat England in a game dubbed \\"The Match of the Century\\". Hungary won 6‚Äì3, becoming the first team outside the British Isles to beat England at home. He was selected as the goalkeeper of the 1954 World Cup's All Star Team. Hungary entered the 1954 FIFA World Cup on a four-year unbeaten streak and as heavy favorites. However, the team lost in the final 3‚Äì2 to West Germany, a team they defeated 8‚Äì3 in the group stage. Grosics was selected as the Team of the Tournament goalkeeper. By 1956, Hungary had recorded 42 victories with Grosics in goal, 7 draws, and just that one loss. During the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Grosics and his family fled the country and attempted to start a new life. However, they were forced to return. Grosics then transferred to Tatab√°nya B√°ny√°sz SC. The national team went into decline, but made the 1958 and 1962 World Cups with Grosics in goal. When he was banned from transferring to Ferencv√°rosi TC after the 1962 season by the Communist Hungarian Sports Ministry, he retired. In total, Grosics played 86 games for the national team. He played in 390 Hungary first division games. In 2011, the Tatab√°nya football stadium was named after him. Style of play Grosics is credited with developing the \\"sweeper-keeper\\" style of play, whereby the goalkeeper can act as an extra defender when needed. This also allowed his teammates to press deep in their opponents' half, plus Grosics' willingness to come out and challenge opposing attackers caused them to miss shots on net. Later life After retiring, Grosics went into coaching. During his career, he held positions with several Hungarian teams and the Kuwait national football team.Elhunyt Grosics Gyula (Obituary) - FC Tatabanya When Hungary became a democracy in 1990, Grosics unsuccessfully ran for parliament under the Hungarian Democratic Forum.

The March, which currently draws about two hundred and fifty to three hundred participants, is held to perpetuate the memory of the famous Royal Air Force Pathfinder Force (8 Group) from the Second World War. Recent years have seen it become an international event with members of the US Air Force and Army, Canadian Air Forces (members of 405 Sqn - one of the only two remaining operational Pathfinder Force Squadrons) and the Danish, French and German Armed forces The event starts and finishes at Royal Air Force Wyton, and is scheduled for the closest Saturday to the Mid-Summers Day. Due to the strenuous nature of this event, and the weather conditions a number of participants do not complete the course, although the percentage of finishers is increasing. There have also been more and more runners taking part The route has been modified since the Pathfinder March was first introduced in 1997, and no longer crosses the airfield as it is active during the event. Instead, the route now tracks from Warboys west to the village of Kings Ripton, before heading south and the RAF station. The route is signposted with way marker signs displaying the silhouette of a mosquito aircraft and is open all year as the Pathfinder Long Distance Walk. The route Entrants have 20 hours to complete the full 46 mile course. Walkers set off at 0400 hrs, whilst those wishing to run the distance start at 0800 hrs to allow time for the check points to be put in place at later stages of the route. All participants are encouraged to keep to the times set for the various stages of the course, otherwise they will not complete the course and be forced to retire. The route encompasses RAF Wyton, Godmanchester, Graveley Airfield, Graveley, Papworth Everard, Elsworth, Childerley, Dry Drayton, Oakington, Oakington Airfield, Longstanton, Bluntisham, Colne, Somersham, Warboys, Warboys Airfield, Kings Ripton before finishing back at RAF Wyton.
