It was also known as Berg D.I or the Berg Fighter, because it was designed by Dipl. Ing. Julius von Berg, and to distinguish it from the D.I fighter built by the parent Aviatik firm in Germany. The D.I was the first locally designed fighter aircraft to be adopted into the Austro-Hungarian Air Service (Luftfahrtruppen).The German parent company of Aviatik built the Halberstadt D.II under licence as the Aviatik D.I. This was later redesignated Halberstadt D.II(Av) when the German military changed its nomenclature, however the D.I designation was never reused. The Aviatik (Berg) D.I designation was in a different sequence, used by the Austro-Hungarian military. It was manufactured both in-house and under license by a number of subcontractors. In 1917, the D.I entered Austro-Hungarian service and saw active operations in the final years of the First World War; it was commonly used for aerial reconnaissance missions, as many fighter units continued to prefer using the German-built Albatros D.III conducting air superiority operations. Following the end of the conflict, it was adopted by the Hungarian Air Force, the Royal Romanian Air Force and the Royal Yugoslav Air Force. Development =Origins= The Aviatik (Berg) D.I has its origins within the experimental single-seater 30.14 aircraft. Work on this prototype had commenced during early 1916; aviation author George Haddow described this aircraft as being, in comparison to the later D.I, \\"ugly\\" and \\"cumbersome\\". However, it also shared many features with its subsequent production form, such as the relatively similar design of the wings. According to Haddow, it was claimed by some sources that Professor Richard Knollwer, a high-profile figure within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, has participated in the design of the 30.14.Haddow 1967, p. 3. On 16 October 1916, the first flight of the prototype occurred at Aspern; however, this test flight went badly, resulting in the death of the test pilot. In response, further modifications to the design were made and three additional prototypes were manufactured, labeled 30.19 (for tests on the ground), 30.20 (for in-flight tests) and 30.21 (as a reserve airframe). Construction of the additional test aircraft was completed during late 1916 and the test programme commenced during early 1917. During March 1917, the 30.21 suffered some damage during an eventful landing, however, it was quickly repaired and returned to the flight test programme. On the whole, the reports of test pilots who flew the prototypes were largely positive, which not only cleared the way for quantity production of the type to commence and for its adoption by the Austro- Hungarian Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops, which quickly placed multiple orders for the type. The first unit to receive production examples (with two synchronized Schwarzloses, on each side of the cylinders) of the D.I was Fluggeschwader I (FLG I, later to be renamed to Flik 101G) on the Divača airfield. According to Haddow, the prototypes had been largely representative of the initial production D.I aircraft, minor differences include the wings being fitted with greater stagger and the relocation of the aileron control cables. However, they did differ in terms of armament, the prototypes lacking any offensive weapons while production fighters were initially outfitted with a single unsynchronized Schwarzlose machine gun, located above the top wing to fire above the propeller. =Production= The D.I was manufactured both in- house and under license by a number of subcontractors.Haddow 1967, pp. 3-4. The Austrian branch of Aviatik was responsible for producing the 38, 138, 238 and 338 Series itself; all models were produced by external parties, including: * Lohner manufactured the 115 and 315 Series * Lloyd manufactured the 48, 248 and 348 Series. * MAG (Magyar Általános Gépgyár - General Hungarian Machine Works) manufactured the 84 and 92 Series * Thöne und Fiala manufactured the 101 Series * Wiener Karosserie Fabrik (WKF) (Vienna Coachwork Factory) manufactured the 184, 284 and 384 Series. The numbers given to the different series were used to indicate various pieces of information; the first digit represented the manufacturer, the following number being used as a 'type number', which would be followed by a break and addition numbers of identify the individual fighters.Haddow 1967, p. 4. The main differences between the different series was in the power of Austro-Daimler engines used (185 hp in the early production aircraft, 200 or 210 hp in the mid-production, and 225 hp in the last ones). Other key areas of change included the positioning of the machine guns, as well as various structural alterations and refinements to the radiator. By 31 October 1918, 677 Aviatik (Berg) D.I airframes of all batches had been handed over to the Austro-Hungarian Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops. While ordered from Lohner and Thöne und Fiala respectively, both the 215 and 201 Series would remain unbuilt. Design The Aviatik (Berg) D.I was a single-seat biplane fighter aircraft. The pilot sat within a high-mounted central position, providing him with a high level of visibility both below and above the upper wing; to enable this seating position, the design featured an uncommonly high decking, which was faired to offer minimal resistance where possible. Much of the design was shaped by the industrial circumstances of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; due to a lack of skilled labour, much of the airframe was as simplified as possible in order to make the type easier to manufacture and capable of being produced in relatively small facilities.Haddow 1967, p. 5. The fuselage of the D.I was rectangular-shaped, composed of a single longeron set at each corner and spaced via bulkheads in the forward section of the fuselage, which provided a mounting point for the engine bearers. Additional reinforcement was provided in the form of tubular steel diagonal struts that ran along the sides of the fuselage between the bearer and the lower wing root. Aft of the cockpit, the bulkheads were dispensed with for lighter frames composed of spruce, which were strengthened by diagonal struts; no internal wire bracing was used throughout the structure, relying upon the external plywood panels for rigidity. The wings of the D.I used an orthodox structure for the time, composed of spruce spars and leading edges. Steel tubing was used for the compression members while wires were used for internal bracing. A wire-based trailing edge gave the wing a distinctive scalloped appearance. The single- piece upper wing was fixed to the fuselage using the W-shaped struts, while the lower wing was bolted directly onto the side of the lower fuselage. Unblanced ailerons were only fitted onto the upper wing; these were hinged onto false spars set within the framework of the wing and actuated via a projecting lever set into the wing itself. During its later service, the wings had to undergo strengthening in order to support the use of more powerful engines that were adopted during the type's production run.Haddow 1967, p. 6. The D.I incorporated a relatively unconventional innovation in the form of an unusual aerofoil section. Specifically, the upper camber of the wing had a pronounced reflex curvature towards its trailing edge, while the maximum depth was further aft than was standard amongst contemporary fighter aircraft. To enable this unusual construction, the rear-portion of the ribs were somewhat thin and flexible, resulting the wing \\"giving\\" under sudden forces such as gusts of wind, but without losing equilibrium. According to Haddow, these features of the wing were attributable for the D.I's high level of stability, which allegedly did little to lessen or undermine its responsiveness to control inputs, as would normally be the case amongst typical aerodynamically stable fighters.Haddow 1967, pp. 5-6. Early production D.Is were powered by a single Austro-Daimler-built engine, capable of providing 185 hp; the majority of aircraft would be fitted with more powerful 200, 210, and 225 hp units instead. The adoption of the 225 hp engine proved to be too powerful for the airframe, requiring various changes to increase structural strength, particularly within the wing area. Regardless of the engine power, a standardised two-bladed Knoller-Jaray-built propeller was adopted, although an unusual four-bladed unit was used on a minority of aircraft (confirmed on serial number 138.106) in its place. The majority of aircraft were fitted with a car-type radiator mounted in the aircraft's nose; two different variants were used, a more common rounded-top model and a more angular flat-top unit. Alternatively, some D.Is were provided with a twin-block radiator mounted one above the other on the forward fuselage, which enabled a more streamlined nose to be adopted. Regardless of the version of the radiator used, cooling was a persistent issue suffered by the type. As a result, many D.Is would be flown with the engine cowling being completely removed by ground crews; a solution to the overheating issue was fitted on later-built aircraft in the form of a simple low-cut fringe cowl that kept the engine cylinders exposed and an elongated block radiator fixed onto the leading edge of the wing.Haddow 1967, pp. 4-5. The D.I was fitted with various armaments. It was initially armed with a single Schwarzlose machine gun, which was mounted onto braces set into the upper fuselage; this arrangement was clear of the propeller blades yet still allowed for easy in-flight access to the breach mechanism. Ammunition was stored in a drum within the fuselage decking and belt-fed to the gun via a purpose-built conduit. However, this arrangement was commonly judged to have been outmoded by the time that the D.I was entering service; accordingly, a new armament arrange was soon adopted. A twin Schewarzlose gun arrangement, which featured synchronization gear as to allow the rounds to pass directly between the propeller blades without striking them; however, the locally produced interrupter mechanism was found to be unreliable in service when the engine was ran at certain speeds.Haddow 1967, p. 7. In spite of the issue, which made the guns prone to striking the propeller blades, this newer armament arrangement was rolled out. Further changes, including the guns being set further back, were also made late on into production.Haddow 1967, pp. 7-8. Operational service In many respects, the D.I was allegedly proved to have been good combat aircraft amongst its contemporaries. It was a reasonably fast aircraft, possessing excellent flying characteristics and maneuverability, and could reach higher altitudes than most of its adversaries. In addition, the D.I was provided with a roomy and comfortable cockpit which gave a good field of view. Despite those desirable features, the new Aviatik fighter wasn't greeted with enthusiasm when it entered service in autumn 1917, as the type also had some serious defects which didn't endear it to its pilots.Haddow 1967, p. 9. The early aircraft had structural deficiencies and their machine guns were installed beyond the reach of the pilot so that when they jammed, there was nothing the pilot could do about it. These problems were later rectified with the strengthening of the airframe and the repositioning of the guns. While the original Aviatik D-I design by Julius von Berg was sound, the Series 115 aircraft license-produced by the Lohner firm at Wien-Floridsdorf were notorious for failures along the wing trailing edges in high speed maneuvers, as Lohner had deviated from Aviatik specifications by employing thinner, lighter wing ribs. The main cause of complaints was the engine's tendency to overheat far too easily. To alleviate these cooling problems, operational units tended to fly their aircraft without the engine's top panels and sometimes the side panels were also left off.Haddow 1967, pp. 9 10. The Austro-Hungarian aviation units used the D.I widely until the end of the First World War on Eastern, Italian and Balkan fronts, mainly as an escort for reconnaissance aircraft, as most of the fighter units preferred the Albatros D.III for air superiority. During 1918, a single D.I was forced down in an undamaged state on the Italian font; this undamaged example was later shipped back to the United Kingdom where it was subject to an extensive evaluation, which found it to be comparable to its various peers of the time, being particularly light, strong, and simplistic in terms of its construction. The captured aircraft was later put on public display in London. Variants The D.II was a version of the D.I with a cantilever lower wing. The model went into production in late 1918 in two Series (39 and 339), but the production aircraft were too late for operational service. The D.III high-altitude version with a 230 hp Hiero engine and the Dr.I triplane development remained as prototypes only.

He became a supporter of the reform work of Colette of Corbie, among the Poor Clare nuns, which, in turn, led a reform movement of his own branch of the Franciscan Order. He is honored as a Blessed within the Order.Egan, Andrew. \\"Henry Balme.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 16 Aug. 2015 Life De Beaume was born in Geneva to a noble family in the service of the Dukes of Savoy. He entered the Province of Burgundy of the Order of Friars Minor, possibly at the friary in Chambéry. According to one source, he was a member of the community of friars in Mirabeau when they accepted the Observant reform then growing among the Friars Minor. He soon became a noted itinerant preacher in the region. Franciscan Authors, 13th–18th century: A Catalogue in Progress \\"Henricus de Beaume\\" De Beaume was a man of exceptional worth according to the testimony of Colette of Corbie, whose confessor he became in 1406 while she was still an anchoress at the Benedictine Abbey of Corbie. He confirmed the validity of her call to reform the Poor Clares, and accompanied her to the papal court then residing in Nice. There the Antipope Benedict XIII authorized Colette's program of reform and appointed de Beaume as her guide and spiritual assistant in this.Loyal Press \\"Saints Stories for all Ages: Saint Collette\\" Several attempts at founding a community of nuns which would follow the original Rule of St. Clare were made in the County of Burgundy, with one finally taking root successfully in Besançon. Communities of friars developed alongside the monasteries of nuns which Colette went on to found. They followed the same spirit of austerity as the nuns and soon became known as the Colettine friars (Colettins). The Ministers General of the Friars Minor appointed de Beaume as the Vicar General for this new reform of the friars, and as the canonical Visitor to the monasteries of the nuns. De Beaume died at the Colettine monastery in Besançon in 1439. Abbess Colette made the decision to have his body buried in the chapter room of the monastery rather than in its chapel, not only out of her attachment to her longtime guide and support, but also to avoid the possibility of crowds being drawn to the tomb of a widely noted holy figure, which would have been disruptive to their lives. Though his cause has never been confirmed by the Holy See, he is honored within the Franciscan Order with the title of Blessed. Legacy De Beaume wrote many letters and a range of spiritual treatises for the Colettine nuns, as well as a Rule for the Coletan friars. Possessing an intimate knowledge of his penitent's life, he wrote a brief account of her marvelous gifts. The saint, however, on hearing of its existence, caused it to be destroyed. Among De Beaume's other writings is one on \\"Theologia Mystica\\", which had been mistakenly attributed to Saint Bonaventure, making him one of several Pseudo- Bonaventuran authors. On the other hand, several spiritual writings have been attributed to him in error. Now they have been identified as having been written by Hugo de Balma and Jacob of Milan, notably Hugo de Balma's De Triplici Via ad Sapientiam, Jacob of Milan's Stimulus Amoris and the Liber Soliloquiorum ad Impetrandam Gratiam et Lacrymas.

He is also the singer for the group Bombay Heavy and was the original keyboardist for Irish alternative rock group LiR. LiR (1990s) Hopkins launched his music career playing keyboard in the Dublin rock band LiR. The original lineup was David McGuiness on vocals, Robert Malone on bass, Ronan Byrne on guitar, David Hopkins on keyboards and Craig Hutchinson on drums. The band came together at the Ballyfermot Rock College, and were known as the Spontaneous Frogs before settling on the name Lir. The group signed to What Are Records and released Magico, Magico, which went to #1 on the alternative albums chart and scored a UK top 10 hit, \\"In A Day,\\" penned by Hopkins. They toured the US twelve times while Hopkins was with them, including touring with The Who. They also opened for other rock icons including U2, Ray Charles, Iggy Pop, etc. LiR are also the subject of the documentary Good Cake Bad Cake: The Story of LiR. Solo career (1994–present) In 1994, while touring in the US with LiR, Hopkins left the band and stayed in the US. After a move to San Francisco, Hopkins toured with The Who, playing keyboards for the opening band on the 1996 Quadrophenia Tour. Hopkins then released the full-length album Here Comes The Bright Light, which Dublin Event Guide dubbed \\"a classic.\\" Later he signed with independent label Reekus Records, with whom he released Amber and Green (2005) and the single \\"Merry Christmas My Love\\". The title track for Amber and Green can be heard on the soundtrack for Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj, and reached the Irish top 40 charts as did \\"Merry Christmas My Love\\". In 2007 Hopkins released the album Running with Knives. The album is featured in the soundtrack to Paris Hilton's 2008 movie The Hottie and the Nottie featuring Joel Moore. In 2009 Hopkins released the album There Are Debts. Hopkins' songs found a larger audience through wide-release motion pictures such as Paris Hilton's The Hottie and the Nottie, Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj, Speed Dating, and The Year of Getting to Know Us, starring Jimmy Fallon, Lucy Liu and Sharon Stone. Tracks from this era can also be heard throughout MTV's The Real World: Austin and Missing. Hopkins has performed his solo material with David Gray, Dan Reynolds (of Imagine Dragons), Matt Nathanson, Damien Rice, The Frames, Lindsey Stirling, Teitur, Jeff Buckley, Sinéad O'Connor, Bell X1 among others. Dan Reynolds of Imagine Dragons cites the Hopkins song \\"Jackson\\" as \\"an early and lasting influence\\" on BYUtv's Audio-Files. Bombay Heavy (2014–present) Using the nom de plume \\"Barnabus Wu\\" Hopkins is the frontman for Bombay Heavy. The group draws its influence from the likes of classic rock bands such as Pink Floyd or Led Zeppelin, playing a kind of psychedelic rock & roll; a striking contrast to David's usual singer-songwriter style. The group's debut EP features Dave Keuning and Mark Stoermer of The Killers, which is no surprise considering Bombay Heavy's connection to the Las Vegas-based power group. Two of their earliest gigs were as the opener for The Killers in 2016.

Thion, one of the most hard-working and underrated locks in world rugby, has played for France since 2003, representing them at the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia as well as captaining them in three tests in late 2005. He was also a part of the 2006 Six Nations Championship- winning side. Before playing rugby union, Thion played basketball for Entente Osny Cergy Pontoise and Pau-Orthez. In fact, he made the switch from basketball to rugby late enough in his life that under current regulations of LNR, which operates France's professional rugby union league, he does not qualify as a \\"France-developed\\" player. Thion's first club was AS Montferrand, where he stayed until 2001, then signing with USA Perpignan, where he stayed for two seasons, before moving to Biarritz, his current club. He made his debut for France on 14 June 2003 in the first of two matches against Argentina. Argentina won the match 10–6 at José Amalfitani Stadium in Buenos Aires. He was in the starting line-up of the subsequent test against the Pumas a week later, which was again won by Argentina, although only by one point, with the final score being 33–32. Thion played in the 31–23 loss to the All Blacks at Jade Stadium in Christchurch on June 28, as well as the 56–8 win over Romania on August 22. Thion started for France in their last test before the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. The game was played against England in Marseille, and was won by France by just one point, with the final score being 17–16. Thion was selected in France's 2003 World Cup squad. France made it to the semi-finals. He earned international caps for France playing in the November tests against Australia, the All Blacks and Argentina. Thion played in every match during the 2005 Six Nations Championship, as well as a test against Australia in November. After the Australian test, Thion captained France in a test match against Canada, which France won 50–6. Thion captained France on two more occasions that year, the 43–8 win over Tonga and the 26–20 win over the Springboks. In 2006, he played every match for France during the 2006 Six Nations Championship, which was won by France in the end. Biarritz made it to the 2005-06 Heineken Cup final, but were defeated by Munster. However, they went on to make it to the 2005-06 Top 14 final as well, where they beat Stade Toulousain to become the champions of France. In 2007, he helped France retain their 6 nations title, defeating Scotland in the final match by 47-19 allowing France to pip Ireland to the title. Thion then played in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, where France were hosts. France finished 4th with semi final defeat to England.

He was ordained a deacon, appointed nomophylax, and from 1178 to 1183, under Patriarch Theodosius I, he had charge of all ecclesiastical trials or cases submitted to the Patriarchate. In 1193 he became the Patriarch of Antioch, though he remained resident in Constantinople. Balsamon's best work is his \\"Scholia\\" (Greek: Σχόλια) (c. 1170), a commentary on the Nomocanon of Photios, the standard work on Eastern Orthodox ecclesiastical and imperial laws and decrees, commissioned by the Emperor Manuel I and the Patriarch Michael III.J.M. Hussey, the Orthodox Church in the Byzantine Empire (Oxford, 1986), p. 307. In his \\"Scholia\\", Balsamon insists on existing laws, and dwells on the relation between canons and laws — ecclesiastical and civil constitutions — giving precedence to the former. Balsamon also compiled a collection of ecclesiastical constitutions (Syntagma) and wrote other works, many of which concern the ongoing debate between the Eastern and Western Churches following the schism of 1054. Two of his letters were published: one treating of fasting, the other on the admission of novices into monasteries. Theodore's legacy is that he preserved the world's knowledge of many otherwise unknown source documents from early Byzantine political and theological history. His commentaries are still referenced to this day by students of Eastern Orthodox canon law, and are published in official collection of canon law known as the Pedalion (Greek: Πηδάλιον, \\"Rudder\\", so named because it is meant as a guide to \\"steer\\" the Church). Theodore also standardized the liturgical practices in usage in the Antiochian Church, to adopt the Byzantine Rite and to reject other Eastern Rites. Bibliography Balsamon's Scholia was first published by Gentian Hervet in Latin at Paris (1561), at Basle (1562); in Greek and Latin at Paris (1615), and again at Basle (1620). It is also found in Beveridge's \\"Pandecta Canonum\\", Oxford, 1672 (P. G., cxxxvii-viii). From 1852 to 1860, Rhalli and Potli published at Athens a collection of the sources of Greek canon law which contains Balsamon's commentary. Migne published his commentaries in his Patrologia Graeca, CIV, 441.

A hydrocolloid dressing is biodegradeable, breathable, and adheres to the skin, so no separate taping is needed. The active surface of the dressing is coated with a cross-linked adhesive mass containing a dispersion of gelatin, pectin and carboxymethyl cellulose together with other polymers and adhesives forming a flexible wafer. In contact with wound exudate, the polysaccharides and other polymers absorb water and swell, forming a gel. The gel may be designed to drain, or to remain within the structure of the adhesive matrix.World Wide Wounds The moist conditions produced under the dressing are intended to promote fibrinolysis, angiogenesis and wound healing, without causing softening and breaking down of tissue. The gel which is formed as a result of the absorption of wound exudate is held in place within the structure of the adhesive matrix. Most hydrocolloid dressings are waterproof, allowing normal washing and bathing.Surgical Materials Testing Laboratory Dressings Datacard: Bordered Granuflex  Uses  Hydrocolloid dressings are used to treat uninfected wounds. Dressings may be used, under medical supervision, even where aerobic infection is present; the infection should be treated appropriately. The dressing is applied to a cleaned wound. Hydrocolloid patches are sometimes used on the face for acne. Smaller sizes are used on acne, not only to get rid of acne, but to avoid acne scars. They are also used to secure nasogastric tubes or CPAP masks to the patient's face. Hydrocolloid dressings are used for pressure ulcers (also known as bed sores). They are used in the treatment of eczema, to seal steroid ointment underneath and to provide a barrier against scratching. =Effectiveness= The results of meta-analyses indicate no significant difference in healing rates between hydrocolloid dressings and other dressings (including simple dressings) for venous ulcers, or for diabetic foot ulcers. There is tentative but unclear evidence for hydrocolloid dressings for superficial and partial thickness burns. Hydrocolloid dressings were, however, superior to other substrates (i.e., alginate, film, gauze, hydrofiber, silicone) for treating skin graft donor sites.

It is the sixth in the series of stories about crashlander Beowulf Shaeffer. The short story was originally published in Crashlander (1994). The story is retold, from the point of view of Sigmund Ausfaller, in Juggler of Worlds. Plot summary Beowulf \\"Bey\\" Shaeffer, half-dreaming, fitfully remembers events leading up to the moment he is shot with an ARM punchgun, a weapon best described as a large-caliber handgun. The recent events, and his memories leading up to them, keep replaying in his head, and Shaeffer realizes that he must be inside Carlos Wu's special autodoc, and that he must be terribly damaged. When he finally awakens, Shaeffer learns he has been in the autodoc for four months and eleven days. He crawls out of the autodoc, feeling unbalanced, and finds himself on the same deserted island on which they had all landed, though he is alone. Moving to the center of the island, which is a shallow cone, he finds the corpse of a tall, headless man in the depression. It is not Carlos, Sharrol Janss, or Feather Filip. Shaeffer takes the boots, pants, and jacket, the latter torn front and back by a large hole. He finds a knife, a ration brick, some sunblock, and tannin pills in the pockets of the jacket. He barely manages to climb out of the cone’s depression then heads back to the autodoc to fix his ruined skin and feet; the yellow sun of Fafnir has ravaged his albino skin and the coral has cut his feet. After falling asleep, Shaeffer dreams of the events leading up to him reawakening in the autodoc the first time. He and Sharrol had gone to a party held at Carlos’s home in the Great Barrier Reef. There they met Feather Filip. The party was to feature small dinner dishes and recreational sex. Once there, Carlos tells them that Feather is an ARM, part of the United Nations police. After a few hours of eating and sex, Feather activates a shield to keep them from being spied upon and gets to work, knowing that anyone who’d been watching would expect that Feather had something too kinky in mind to share over surveillance tapes. Carlos worries that the ARM will care what they’re saying, but Feather says they will dismiss it as “Feather coming down after a long week.” Carlos and Feather intend to leave Earth for good. They want to go as a group, four adults and two children, to match the profile of a family on Fafnir that has fallen on hard times. They will provide the family, the Graynors, with transportation to Wunderland and funding once they are there, and under their names Carlos, Feather, Shaeffer, Sharrol and the kids Tanya and Louis will continue on to Home as Shashters (residents of Fafnir's one continent, Shasht). Sharrol is annoyed as she and Carlos had talked this over extensively, years before. Sharrol has Flatland Phobia, she cannot leave Earth, which Carlos knows. Their plan to work around that is that Sharrol, Tanya and Louis will travel in cold sleep to Fafnir then again to Home. Both Carlos and Feather have their reasons for going; Carlos is tired of the ARM supervising his every move, and Feather is about to retire and knows she will never be let off-planet and the United Nations will never approve a “schiz” (a paranoid schizophrenic) having children. Feather also tells Shaeffer the UN will never let him off Earth again as he knows too much about the Core explosion, the puppeteers and Kdatlyno, and Julian Forward’s work. Carlos told Feather he wanted to offer them the chance to come along, as they need a pilot, and Shaeffer can fill that need. They talk it over until Shaeffer and Sharrol are convinced. After landing on Mars in the hyperdrive ship \\"Boy George\\", Shaeffer and Feather leave to retrieve the ship they will use to land on Fafnir. It is a stealth lander, used during the Fourth Man-Kzin War, and the ARM thinks it’s going to the Smithsonian Luna to be displayed as the ship that Sinbad Jabar landed on Kzinhome with to invade and destroy the Patriarch’s harem. Shaeffer reads up on life and lifestyles on Fafnir; it has a 22-hour day, and the locals move at their own pace. Shaeffer, Feather, and Carlos move Carlos’ massive autodoc into the lander, put Sharrol into the intensive care cavity to sleep throughout the trip, put Tanya and Louis in the cold sleep box together, then leave in the Boy George for the three-week trip to Fafnir. Shaeffer remembered it was an uncomfortable trip; Feather kept giving him strange looks, so he avoided her until the night before they reached Fafnir, when she turned up between his sleeping plates. They were both aroused, but the next day she was all business as they exited Boy George behind Fafnir’s moon in the lander while the ship traveled on alone, passing too close to an ARM base on an asteroid that Feather was not supposed to know about, but did, then changed course hastily and left in the direction of another ex-Kzinti world, Hrooshpithtcha, to throw off their trail. In the lander, Shaeffer found a small island with no one around and used the lower jets to burn out the lamplighter nest in it, then sank the lander into the melting center. In the morning, when dawn gave them enough light, they inflated the boat, then Feather and Carlos used the gravity lift to put the freezebox with Tanya and Louis in it into it. Feather brought the lift to the autodoc and they moved it toward the boat as Feather called him. Turning toward her is the last thing Shaeffer remembers. Now, four months later, Shaeffer realizes that Feather did not just want to leave Earth, she wanted Carlos as well. But Carlos wanted Sharrol and his children, and Sharrol would not leave earth without Shaeffer. After they arrived, Carlos knew he was no longer useful to Feather. She shot Shaeffer to prove that she could and would take life, if necessary. But Shaeffer remembered seeing Carlos leaping into the boat just after he was shot. Shaeffer hides the autodoc using the gravity lift to move it into the sea at low tide. The only time he would not be able to use it is during high tide. For the next week, Shaeffer lives at sea, scooping up sunbunnies and finding clutches of eggs. Finally, on the eighth night, he sees lights near the horizon. Using mag-specs, Shaeffer sees that it is a boat, but is not moving. Sending up flares, Shaeffer begins swimming toward the boat. He doesn't want anyone to know that's where he and Carlos' autodoc had been hidden. The owners of the boat are siblings Wilhelmin and Toranaga, their boat is called the Gullfish. They had both been recently separated from their mates. They replaced his torn jacket with a new one from a locker on their boat, after he cleans out his pockets. Shaeffer presented himself as Persial January Herbert, an identity he assumed as part of setting up his accounts on Fafnir and Home using money given to him by his oldest friend on Earth, Elephant. Shaeffer tells Wil and Tor a story of having lost his wife, Milcenta, in a boating accident, then being rescued and trying to find her but ultimately becoming depressed and drinking. When a torpedo ray hits his boat, Persial gives up and starts swimming. He then decides she might still be alive under a different name. Searching the records of Fafnir for either Sharrol or Feather, he finds Sharrol alive and safe under the name Milcenta, but not Feather. The tradition on Fafnir when rescued is to give your rescuers a life gift, a present expressing your value as perceived by yourself. Twelve days after being picked up, they arrive at Booty Island. At the hotel, Shaeffer uses the styler and his rooms caller to check for Sharrol after establishing his identity as Martin Wallace Graynor. It found that Sharrol had been using autodocs, but had never made her way to Shasht, to find Carlos, Tanya, or Louis. Shaeffer thinks she may be grieving over losing him. Using a transfer booth to travel to Shasht, Shaeffer visits Outbound Enterprises, the iceliner company they were using to travel to Home. He explains that he is four months late because he’d been shipwrecked. His husband, John Graynor (Carlos) and their children Tween and Nathan (Tanya and Louis, respectively) had gone on to Home, but neither Milcenta nor Adelaide (Feather) had shown up either. However, John had left a message for Adelaide. Shaeffer persuades the clerk to read it then show it to him, so that he could know whether Milcenta was dead or not. Shaeffer alters a transfer booth card to let him go on a random walk, as users flash from booth to booth in a local area every few seconds. There is a chance he’ll come across Feather rather than Sharrol, but he decides to risk it. He believes Sharrol has likely taken a job somewhere in Pacifica, since she has not gone on to Home or Shasht. At Solarico Omni, he finds Sharrol. At first she is terrified of him and points Feather’s punchgun at him, which she kept. Keeping himself between her and a Kzin officer, Shaeffer tries to calm her fears. She recounts waking up on Fafnir, with everything feeling wrong, the light, the gravity, and Earth so far away. Then a booming sound and Shaeffer falling to the ground as Feather pointed her weapon at him. Carlos had jumped into the boat and roared away, while Feather screamed at him, Shaeffer looking dead to her. Sharrol jumped on Feather’s back and cut her throat. Feather was a trained ARM but she never took Sharrol seriously, which proved to be her last mistake. The tall, headless man on the beach was Shaeffer's corpse: He couldn't fit in the autodoc as it was designed for smaller humans.. So Sharrol could only put his head in there and hope for the best. Shaeffer and Sharrol tape messages for their benefactors, Wil and Tor in Shaeffer’s case, and the crew of Hand of Allah in Sharrol’s. They present them with life gifts: Shaeffer gives Wil and Tor silverware service for a dozen, while Sharrol gives the crew of Hand of Allah red meat and vegetables. Wil and Tor have undoubtedly turned in the torn jacket to Fafnir police but they will never know if he was a murderer, as Shaeffer had presented a plausible reason for the tears in his jacket, and there was just no evidence otherwise. They then tape a message for Carlos as John Graynor with Ms. Machti, the Outbound Enterprises desk clerk, in mind as well, letting him know that Milcenta was safe and hinting that Adelaide was 'out of the picture'. Sharrol does not want to travel again anytime soon so they plan to stay on Fafnir for a while; being underwater is second nature for Sharrol, and similar to being underground for Shaeffer, if he doesn't look out a window.

Life and career Cook was born on June 1, 1935, in Hong Kong, the fourth of six children, and a third generation missionary. During World War II, his family was imprisoned in three different concentration camps. In 1942 he was reunited with his poverty stricken family in South Africa. By 1947, the Cooks had moved to the United States, and settled in Laguna Beach, California. In 1953, Cook showed that he had talent in basketball and won the California Interscholastic Federation basketball player of the year award. He was awarded athletics scholarships to 13 different major universities but instead chose to go to Biola College. He earned a Bachelor's degree in Bible from Biola in 1957, and later received both a Master of Divinity degree and a Master of Theology degree from Talbot School of Theology. He spent several years working at Biola as both a coach and the school's athletic director. From 1963 to 1967, Cook and his wife Anna Belle served as missionaries in Cebu, Philippines with Overseas Crusades (founded by Dick Hillis). During this time, Cook traveled to 72 different countries doing various missions related activities and representing the College. Returning to Biola in 1967 as an Assistant Professor of Missions, Cook was then appointed Director of Intercultural Studies and Missions and helped to develop Biola's program in cross-cultural education. He earned his Doctor of Missiology (D.Miss.) in 1974 from Fuller Theological Seminary. Called to the presidency of O.C. Ministries (formerly Overseas Crusades) in 1978, he guided the mission organization to an increased level of financial stability and multiplied foreign field involvement. Cook served on the Biola Board of Trustees from 1980 to 1982 when he was invited by a unanimous vote of the Board to assume the seventh presidency of Biola University on June 1, 1982. Cook served for seven years on the Board of Directors of the Christian College Coalition, and one year as its chair. He also served for six years on the Board of Directors of the American Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, and served as the president of that organization for two years. He served on the Western Association of Schools and Colleges accreditation task force. He served several years as a member of the steering committee for the Fellowship of Evangelical Seminary Presidents, and for six years on the executive committee of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of California. Cook announced his retirement in 2006, a year ahead of time in order to give the university's Board of Trustees enough time to find a replacement. He stated that he wanted to allow a new president to usher in Biola's centennial celebrations. In May 2006, Cook was honored for his work at Biola at the Crystal Cathedral in Orange County, and his interview by Rev.Robert H. Schuller was viewed by an estimated 20 million viewers worldwide on the Hour of Power. On June 30, 2007, Cook retired, just prior to the official start of Biola's centennial celebration. He was one of California's longest serving university presidents.President's Retirement « Biola University Cook was noted for his strong defense of Biblical doctrine, including the key doctrine of Biblical inerrancy. Under Cook's leadership, Biola grew tremendously from a small Bible college to one of the largest evangelical universities in the nation, with nearly 6,000 total students. After an extensive search, Dr. Barry Corey was selected to become the eighth president of Biola University on May 11, 2007. Dr. Corey was formerly Vice President/Chief Academic Officer and Academic Dean at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.

Tokyo Love Story was adapted as a Japanese television drama (dorama) in 1991. It aired on Fuji Television in 11 episodes (plus one special) between January and March 1991. Actors include Yūji Oda, Honami Suzuki, and Narimi Arimori. The drama's theme song, \\"Love Story wa Totsuzen ni\\" by Kazumasa Oda is Japan's 9th best-selling single in history. Plot Mikami, Kanji, and Satomi have been friends since they were children, having grown up in the same small town in Ehime Prefecture on the island of Shikoku. Now, all three are in their early 20s and have made their way to Tokyo for different reasons. Kanji is last to arrive, having gotten a new job in Heart Sports' sales department and transferring to the Tokyo office. At work, he meets a vivacious new colleague, Rika, as well as being reunited with his best friends from home--Mikami and Satomi. Mikami is Kanji's best male friend and Satomi is their platonic female friend whom both have had a crush on since high school. The situation becomes more complicated as Kanji sees Mikami forcedly kissing Satomi, which upsets Kanji deeply. But he heals his broken heart by developing strong feelings for Rika, who is energetic, funny, encouraging and caring. However, their relationship is a bit unstable because Kanji is dating her on the rebound, and Rika has been having a (not so) secret affair with her and Kanji's boss, Waga. The affair is de-emphasized in the TV series, but in the manga, the affair is much more important. Rika gets pregnant with Waga's child (not shown in the drama version). Meanwhile, Satomi thinks that Mikami was just playing with her when he kissed her, and so she rejects him. He turns to a medical school classmate, Nagasaki, and begins pursuing her. Eventually Kanji realizes Satomi's feelings, and he chooses her over Rika.

It is mostly concerned with the public schooling systems of modern industrial societies, including the expansion of higher, further, adult, and continuing education.Gordon Marshall (ed) A Dictionary of Sociology (Article: Sociology of Education), Oxford University Press, 1998 Education is seen as a fundamentally optimistic human endeavour characterised by aspirations for progress and betterment.Schofield, K. (1999). The Purposes of Education, Queensland State Education: 2010 Accessed 2002, Oct 28. It is understood by many to be a means of overcoming handicaps, achieving greater equality, and acquiring wealth and social status.Sargent, M. (1994) The New Sociology for Australians (3rd ed.), Longman Cheshire, Melbourne Education is perceived as a place where children can develop according to their unique needs and potential. Not only can children develop, but young and older adults too. Social interactions between people through education is always causing further development no matter what age they are. It is also perceived as one of the best means of achieving greater social equality. Many would say that the purpose of education should be to develop every individual to their full potential, and give them a chance to achieve as much in life as their natural abilities allow (meritocracy). Few would argue that any education system accomplishes this goal perfectly. Some take a particularly critical view, arguing that the education system is designed with the intention of causing the social reproduction of inequality.  Foundations  Systematic sociology of education began with the work of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) on moral education as a basis for organic solidarity, and with studies by Max Weber (1864–1920) on the Chinese literati as an instrument of political control. After World War II, however, the subject received renewed interest around the world: from technological functionalism in the US, egalitarian reform of opportunity in Europe, and human-capital theory in economics. These all implied that, with industrialization, the need for a technologically skilled labour force undermines class distinctions and other ascriptive systems of stratification, and that education promotes social mobility. However, statistical and field research across numerous societies showed a persistent link between an individual's social class and achievement, and suggested that education could only achieve limited social mobility. Sociological studies showed how schooling patterns reflected, rather than challenged, class stratification and racial and sexual discrimination. After the general collapse of functionalism from the late 1960s onwards, the idea of education as an unmitigated good was even more profoundly challenged. Neo-Marxists argued that school education simply produced a docile labour force essential to late-capitalist class relations.  Theoretical perspectives  The sociology of education contains a number of theories. Some of the main theories are presented below. = Political arithmetic = The Political Arithmetic tradition within the sociology of education began with Hogben (1938)Hogben, L. (1938) Political Arithmetic: a symposium of population studies, London: Allen & Unwin. and denotes a tradition of politically critical quantitative research dealing with social inequalities, especially those generated by social stratification (Heath 2000).Heath, A. (2000) The Political Arithmetic Tradition in the Sociology of Education, Oxford Review of Education 26(3-4): 313-331. Important works in this tradition have been (Glass 1954),Glass, D. V. (1954) Social Mobility in Britain, London: Routledge and Kegan Paul. (Floud, et al. 1956)Floud, J., Halsey, A. H. and Martin, F. (1956) Social class and educational opportunity: Heinemann. and (Halsey, et al. 1980).Halsey, A. H., Heath, A. F. and Ridge, J. M. (1980) Origins and destinations : family, class, and education in modern Britain, Oxford: Clarendon Press All of these works were concerned with the way in which school structures were implicated in social class inequalities in Britain. More recent work in this tradition has broadened its focus to include gender,Gorard, S., Salisbury, J. and Rees, G. (1999) Reappraising the apparent underachievement of boys at school, Gender and Education 11(4): 441-454.Sullivan, A., Heath, A. F. and Rothon, C. (2011) Equalisation or inflation? Social class and gender differentials in England and Wales, Oxford Review of Education 37(2): 215-240. ethnic differentials Heath, A. F. and Cheung, S.-Y. (eds) (2007) Unequal Chances: ethnic minoroties in western labour markets, Oxford: Oxford University Press. and international differences.Heath, A. F. and Sullivan, A. (2011) Introduction: The democratisation of upper-secondary education?, Oxford Review of Education 37(2): 123-138. While researchers in this tradition have engaged with sociological theories such as Rational Choice Theory Breen, R. and Goldthorpe, J. (1997) Explaining Educational Differentials: Towards a Rational Action Theory, Rationality and Society 9(3): 275-305. and Cultural Reproduction Theory,Sullivan, A. (2001) Cultural Capital and Educational Attainment, Sociology 35(4): 893-912. the political arithmetic tradition has tended to remain rather sceptical of 'grand theory' and very much concerned with empirical evidence and social policy. The political arithmetic tradition was attacked by the 'New Sociology of Education' of the 1970s M. F. D. Young (ed) Knowledge and Control: New Directions for the Sociology of Education, London: Macmillan. which rejected quantitative research methods. This heralded a period of methodological division within the sociology of education. However, the political arithmetic tradition, while rooted in quantitative methods, has increasingly engaged with mixed methods approaches.Ogg, T., Zimdars, A. and Heath, A. F. (2009) Schooling effects on degree performance: a comparison of the predictive validity of aptitude testing and secondary school grades at Oxford University, British Educational Research Journal 35(5): 781-807. = Structural functionalism = Structural functionalists believe that society leans towards social equilibrium and social order. They see society like a human body, in which institutions such as education are like important organs that keep the society/body healthy and well.Bessant, J. and Watts, R. (2002) Sociology Australia (2nd ed), Allen & Unwin, Sydney Social reality is structured and differentiated and provides social science with its subject matter. This explains why individuals act as role incumbents and perform specific tasks on a regular basis as manifested at the level of observable event. The relation between teacher and student lies at heart of the realist conception of social structure. The internal relation between roles, distinct from the individual people who fill them and whom they casually affect.The relation between teacher and student is closely internal because each could not exist without each other. Functionalists view education as one of the more important social institutions in society. They emphasize that education contributes to two types of functions: manifest functions, which are the intended and visible functions of education; and latent functions, which are hidden and unintended functions. Manifest Functions There are several major manifest functions associated with education. The first is socialization. The French sociologist, Emile Durkheim, established the academic discipline of sociology, characterized schools as, \\"socialization agencies that teach children how to get along with others and prepare them for adult economic roles\\" (Durkheim 1898). Socialization involves learning the rules and norms of the society as a whole. One of the roles of schools is to teach students conformity to law and respect for authority. Education is also an important tool used by students towards upward mobility. Higher learning institutions are viewed as vehicles for moving students closer to their careers that will help them become successful. Latent Functions Education also fulfills latent functions. Much goes on in school that has little to do with formal education. The educational setting introduces students to social networks that might last for years and can help people find jobs after their schooling is completed. Another latent function is the ability to work with others in small groups, a skill that is transferable to a workplace that might not be learned in a home school setting. Socialization Social health means the same as social order, and is guaranteed when nearly everyone accepts the general moral values of their society. Hence structural functionalists believe the aim of key institutions, such as education, is to socialize children and teenagers. Socialization is the process by which the new generation learns the knowledge, attitudes and values that they will need as productive citizens. Education's primary role is to convey basic knowledge and skills to future generations. Although this aim is stated in the formal curriculum,NSW Board of Studies, K-6 HSIE Syllabus (NSW Australia) it is mainly achieved through the hidden curriculum,Harper, G. (1997) \\"Society, culture, socialization and the individual\\" in Stafford, C. and Furze, B. (eds) Society and Change (2nd ed), Macmillan Education Australia, Melbourne a subtler, but nonetheless powerful, indoctrination of the norms and values of the wider society. Students learn these values because their behavior at school is regulated (Durkheim in ) until they gradually internalize and accept them. Additionally, education is an important tool in the transmission of core values. The core values in education reflect on the economic and political systems that originally fueled education. One of the most important core value that is transmitted through the education system is individualism, the principle of being independent and self-reliant. From a very early age children learn that society seeks out and praises the best individuals. Connected to individualism, self-esteem is also developed through educational curriculum. Self-esteem is the ability to have confidence in one’s own decisions, therefore, having individualism allows for a growth in self-esteem that cannot be created without. Compared to Japanese students for example, curriculum in Japan is focused on social esteem (focusing on bringing honor to a group) rather than self-esteem. Filling roles in society Education must also perform another function: As various jobs become vacant, they must be filled with the appropriate people. Therefore, the other purpose of education is to sort and rank individuals for placement in the labor market [Munro, 1997]. Those with high achievement will be trained for the most important jobs and in reward, be given the highest incomes. Those who achieve the least, will be given the least demanding (intellectually at any rate, if not physically) jobs, and hence the least income. According to Sennet and Cobb however, \\"to believe that ability alone decides who is rewarded is to be deceived\\". Meighan agrees, stating that large numbers of capable students from working-class backgrounds fail to achieve satisfactory standards in school and therefore fail to obtain the status they deserve.Meighan, R. & Siraj-Blatchford, I. (1997) A Sociology of Educating (3rd Ed), Cassell, London Jacob believes this is because the middle class cultural experiences that are provided at school may be contrary to the experiences working-class children receive at home.Jacob, A. (2001) Research links poverty and literacy, ABC Radio Transcript In other words, working class children are not adequately prepared to cope at school. They are therefore \\"cooled out\\"Foster, L. E. (1987) Australian Education: A Sociological Perspective(2nd Ed), Prentice Hall, Sydney from school with the least qualifications, hence they get the least desirable jobs, and so remain working class. Sargent confirms this cycle, arguing that schooling supports continuity, which in turn supports social order. Talcott Parsons believed that this process, whereby some students were identified and labelled educational failures, \\"was a necessary activity which one part of the social system, education, performed for the whole\\". Yet the structural functionalist perspective maintains that this social order, this continuity, is what most people desire. this is one of the most critical thing in sociology = Education and social reproduction = The perspective of conflict theory, contrary to the structural functionalist perspective, believes that society is full of vying social groups with different aspirations, different access to life chances and gain different social rewards.Furze, B. and Healy, P. (1997) \\"Understanding society and change\\" in Stafford, C. and Furze, B. (eds) Society and Change (2nd Ed), Macmillan Education Australia, Melbourne The conflict theory sees the purpose of education as a way to maintain social inequality and a way to preserve the power of those who dominate society. Relations in society, in this view, are mainly based on exploitation, oppression, domination and subordination.Connell, R. W. and White, V., (1989) 'Child poverty and educational action' in Edgar, D., Keane, D. & McDonald, P. (eds), Child Poverty, Allen & Unwin, Sydney Many teachers assume that students will have particular middle class experiences at home, and for some children this assumption isn't necessarily true. Some children are expected to help their parents after school and carry considerable domestic responsibilities in their often single-parent home.Wilson, B. and Wyn, J. (1987) Shaping Futures: Youth Action for Livelihood, Allen & Unwin, Hong Kong The demands of this domestic labour often make it difficult for them to find time to do all their homework and thus affects their academic performance. Where teachers have softened the formality of regular study and integrated student's preferred working methods into the curriculum, they noted that particular students displayed strengths they had not been aware of before. However few teachers deviate from the traditional curriculum, and the curriculum conveys what constitutes knowledge as determined by the state - and those in power [Young in ]. This knowledge isn't very meaningful to many of the students, who see it as pointless. Wilson & Wyn state that the students realise there is little or no direct link between the subjects they are doing and their perceived future in the labour market. Anti-school values displayed by these children are often derived from their consciousness of their real interests. Sargent believes that for working-class students, striving to succeed and absorbing the school's middle class values, are accepting their inferior social position as much as if they were determined to fail. Fitzgerald states that \\"irrespective of their academic ability or desire to learn, students from poor families have relatively little chance of securing success\\".Henry, M., Knight, J., Lingard, R. and Taylor, S. (1988) Understanding Schooling: An Introductory Sociology of Australian Education, Routledge, Sydney On the other hand, for middle and especially upper-class children, maintaining their superior position in society requires little effort. The federal government subsidises 'independent' private schools enabling the rich to obtain 'good education' by paying for it. With this 'good education', rich children perform better, achieve higher and obtain greater rewards. In this way, the continuation of privilege and wealth for the elite is made possible in continuum. Conflict theorists believe this social reproduction continues to occur because the whole education system is overlain with ideology provided by the dominant group. In effect, they perpetuate the myth that education is available to all to provide a means of achieving wealth and status. Anyone who fails to achieve this goal, according to the myth, has only themselves to blame. Wright agrees, stating that \\"the effect of the myth is to…stop them from seeing that their personal troubles are part of major social issues\\". The duplicity is so successful that many parents endure appalling jobs for many years, believing that this sacrifice will enable their children to have opportunities in life that they did not have themselves. Conflict theorists believe that the educational system is maintaining the status quo by dulling the lower classes into being obedient workers. These people who are poor and disadvantaged are victims of a societal confidence trick. They have been encouraged to believe that a major goal of schooling is to strengthen equality while, in reality, schools reflect society's intention to maintain the previous unequal distribution of status and power [Fitzgerald, cited in ]. Conflict theorists point to several key factors to defend their position. First, conflict theorists look at property tax. Typically, the areas of affluent districts have more money, so they can afford to pay teachers higher salaries, purchase new technology, and attract better teachers. Students in these districts are typically white, which means a majority of minority students in the United States do not receive any of these advantages and are less likely to go to college. This connects to the conflict theorist viewpoint that the educational system is simply a perpetuator of the status quo. Additionally, conflict theorists including Bowles and Gintis argued that schools directly reproduce social and economic inequalities embedded in the capitalist economy. They believed that this conflict played out in classrooms where students were marked by larger and highly stratified economic structure. Whether or not current leaders in sociology agreed with Bowles and Gintis, they all undeniably came to operate in fields guided by these ideas. This perspective has been criticised as deterministic and pessimistic, while there is some evidence for social mobility among disadvantaged students. It should be recognised however that it is a model, an aspect of reality which is an important part of the picture. = Structure and agency =  Bourdieu and cultural capital  This theory of social reproduction has been significantly theorised by Pierre Bourdieu who aimed at analyzing social class inequalities in education. However Bourdieu as a social theorist has always been concerned with the dichotomy between the objective and subjective, or to put it another way, between structure and agency. Bourdieu has therefore built his theoretical framework around the important concepts of habitus, field and cultural capital. These concepts are based on the idea that objective structures determine individuals' chances, through the mechanism of the habitus, where individuals internalise these structures. However, the habitus is also formed by, for example, an individual's position in various fields, their family and their everyday experiences. Therefore, one's class position does not determine one's life chances, although it does play an important part, alongside other factors. Bourdieu used the idea of cultural capital to explore the differences in outcomes for students from different classes in the French educational system. He explored the tension between the conservative reproduction and the innovative production of knowledge and experience.Harker, R., (1990) \\"Education and Cultural Capital\\" in Harker, R., Mahar, C., & Wilkes, C., (eds) (1990) An Introduction to the Work of Pierre Bourdieu: the practice of theory, Macmillan Press, London He found that this tension is intensified by considerations of which particular cultural past and present is to be conserved and reproduced in schools. Bourdieu argues that it is the culture of the dominant groups, and therefore their cultural capital, which is embodied in schools, and that this leads to social reproduction. James Coleman also focused a lot on the themes of social reproduction and inequality. Coleman inspired many of the current leaders of sociology of education, but his work also led to a heightened focus on empiricism. The cultural capital of the dominant group, in the form of practices and relation to culture, is assumed by the school to be the natural and only proper type of cultural capital and is therefore legitimated. It demands \\"uniformly of all its students that they should have what it does not give\\" [Bourdieu Swartz, D., \\"Pierre Bourdieu: The Cultural Transmission of Social Inequality\\" in Robbins, D., (2000) Pierre Bourdieu Volume II, Sage Publications, London, pp.207-217]. This legitimate cultural capital allows students who possess it to gain educational capital in the form of qualifications. Those lower-class students are therefore disadvantaged. To gain qualifications they must acquire legitimate cultural capital, by exchanging their own (usually working-class) cultural capital.Harker, R., (1984) \\"On Reproduction, Habitus and Education\\" in Robbins, D., (2000) Pierre Bourdieu Volume II, Sage Publications, London, pp.164-176 This exchange is not a straightforward one, due to the class ethos of the lower-class students. Class ethos is described as the particular dispositions towards, and subjective expectations of, school and culture. It is in part determined by the objective chances of that class.Gorder, K., (1980) \\"Understanding School Knowledge: a critical appraisal of Basil Bernstein and Pierre Bourdieu\\" in Robbins, D., (2000) Pierre Bourdieu Volume II, Sage Publications, London, pp.218-233 This means that not only do children find success harder in school due to the fact that they must learn a new way of 'being', or relating to the world, and especially, a new way of relating to and using language, but they must also act against their instincts and expectations. The subjective expectations influenced by the objective structures found in the school, perpetuate social reproduction by encouraging less-privileged students to eliminate themselves from the system, so that fewer and fewer are to be found as one journeys through the levels of the system. The process of social reproduction is neither perfect nor complete, but still, only a small number of less-privileged students achieve success. For the majority of these students who do succeed at school, they have had to internalise the values of the dominant classes and use them as their own, to the detriment of their original habitus and cultural values. Therefore, Bourdieu's perspective reveals how objective structures play an important role in determining individual achievement in school, but allows for the exercise of an individual's agency to overcome these barriers, although this choice is not without its penalties. Identity Drawing on Bourdieu's ideas, Fuller (2009) adds to the theoretical understanding of structure and agency by considering how young people shape their educational identity and how this identity is often the result of messages reflected at them, for example, through grades, setting and gendered expectations. Social location is considered important but its role is complex. Her work considered the importance of understanding the ways that individuals identify within an academic discourse, a discourse that typically situates young people dichotomously; as those who will achieve and those that will not. Understanding the importance of areas such as self- efficacy, confidence and resilience in shaping educational identity at the level of agent and subsequently, educational attainment and aspirations, has been central to her most recent work.

The first unit of its type formed under that classification, JG I was formed on 24 June 1917, with Manfred von Richthofen as commanding officer, by combining Jastas 4, 6, 10 and 11. JG I became known as \\"The Flying Circus\\" () or \\"Richthofen's Circus\\" because of the bright colours of its aircraft, and perhaps also because of the way the unit was transferred from one area of Allied air activity to another – moving like a travelling circus in trains, and frequently setting up in tents on improvised airfields.  Formation  Rittmeister Manfred von Richthofen – German flying aces of WW I. Lothar von Richthofen Hermann Goering commander of Jagdgeschwader I (World War I) beside his Fokker DVII 5125/1918. He holds a walking stick \\"Geschwader Stock\\" that had been owned by The Red Baron Manfred von Richthofen. During early 1917, it became apparent to the German High Command that they would always be outnumbered in air operations over the Western Front. The average Jasta could only muster some six or eight aircraft in total for a patrol, and would often face one Allied formation after another. In order to maintain some impact and local command of the air the Jastas began (unofficially) to fly in larger, composite groups. By mid 1917 the first official grouping of Jastas saw JG I formed. Its role was simple; to achieve localized air superiority wherever it was sent and to deny Allied air operations over a specific location. The unit was thus highly mobile, and JG I and its supporting logistical infrastructure traveled to wherever local air superiority was needed, often at short notice. Initially based at Marke (Jasta 11), Cuene (Jasta 4), Bissegem (Jasta 6) and Heule (Jasta 10), Richthofen had carte blanche to select his unit commanders and recruit individual pilots into JG I, and alternately to transfer out any pilots he did not feel were up to standard. Thus 9-victory ace Leutnant Eduard Ritter von Dostler and the rising Leutnant Hans von Adam were soon posted to Jasta 6, and Lieutenant Werner Voss into Jasta 10. This policy had the effect of making the Jagdgeschwader an elite unit, but robbing lesser Jastas of their best pilots also reduced the overall standard of the average unit. JG I itself suffered a dilution of talent when competent members were posted away to command their own Jastas in late 1917, when the number of Jastas were doubled from 40 to 80.  Operations 1917  JG I was soon flying intensively over the Flanders battlefield above the Allied offensive started in June 1917. Richthofen was severely wounded in the head on 6 July, leading elements of JG I in combat with F.E.2d's of the Royal Flying Corps's No. 20 Squadron. Oberleutnant Kurt von Doering, Commanding Officer of Jasta 4, took over temporary command and Jastas 4 and 11 shot down nine Allied aircraft the next day. Richthofen reassumed command on 25 July, but left on a period of convalescence leave on 6 September. JG I was the first unit to operationally provide a trial of the new Fokker Dr.I triplane (as the Fokker F.I), the first two examples of which were received on 21 August 1917. Jasta 10's Werner Voss would be the triplane's greatest exponent, scoring 10 victories with it in just 21 days before his death in combat. Richthofen returned to JG I on 23 October, and around this time a number of fatal crashes involving the Fokker Dr.I saw JG I Technical Officer Lt. Konstantin Krefft ground the unit's triplanes until modifications were carried out in early December. The unit meantime soldiered on with the Albatros D.V.. JG I was rushed from Ypres to Cambrai by 23 November 1917, following the launch of the British offensive, and did much to stabilise the air war over the battlefield when the bad weather permitted. By the end of 1917 the success of Jagdgeschwader I meant several other similar formations were then formed in February 1918, with Jagdgeschwader II operating against both the French and the British and Jagdgeschwader III on the Ypres front. At this time Richthofen recruited Hans Kirchstein and Fritz Friedrichs from two-seater units, and Ernst Udet from Jasta 37.  1918  Poor weather in early 1918 saw little opportunity for JG I to score, although the unit were in the forefront of defensive fighter operations during the major German offensive launched on 21 March 1918. By April 1918 the formation was flying from Harbonnieres, the most south westerly airfield they were to ultimately occupy. The newly formed RAF however maintained a degree of air superiority, with heavily escorted artillery observation and reconnaissance two-seaters operating effectively over the rapidly moving ground battle below. Most of JG I's victims at this time were the low flying fighter bombers, particularly Sopwith Camels. After von Richthofen's death in April 1918, Hauptmann Wilhelm Reinhard became JG I Commanding Officer. On 10 May JG I claimed its 300th victory while on 20 May the unit received the honorary title of JG I 'Richthofen'. Soon after JG I moved to the 7th Army front to support the forthcoming Aisne offensive, commencing on 27 May. JG I moved to Guise, and then Puiseux Ferme, operating primarily against the French and the newly arrived American Air Forces. Between 31 May and 8 June JG I claimed some 43 French aircraft and balloons, and another 24 between 24 June and 28 June. Jasta 6's Lt. Hans Kirschstein was the star performer of JG I at this time, claiming 27 victories between 18 March and 14 June. By mid-June JG I was fully equipped with the Fokker D.VII, the first having been tested operationally in late May by Jasta 10. After Reinhard was killed in a flying accident on 3 July 1918, Oberleutnant Hermann Göring became JG I's third and last commander of the war on 14 July. The Geschwader moved again on 19 July to Soissons, claiming its 500th victory on 25 July. Yet another move followed on 10 August, to the 2nd Army front west of Saint Quentin. JG I's then top scorer, 53-kill Leutnant Erich Loewenhardt, was killed in an air collision on this day. Having been subjected to intensive operations over the Amiens battle in August 1918, by mid-September an exhausted JG I was withdrawn from the British part of the front, having lost all four Jasta commanders by the end of August; Lowenhardt of Jasta 10 was killed, Jasta 6's Co Lt. Paul Wenzel and Lothar von Richthofen of Jasta 11 both wounded and hospitalised, and Lt. Ernst Udet (Jasta 4) exhausted and sent on leave. JG I scored just 17 claims during September, despite the month seeing the highest losses for the Allied Air Forces of the war (The Jasta force claiming some 721 victories for the month). For the next three months the likes of Leutnant Friedrich Noltenius in Jasta 11, Jasta 6's Commanding Officer Ulrich Neckel, and Leutnant Arthur Laumann (Jasta 10) did the majority of the scoring. Thereafter until the end of the war shortages of fuel and spares, increasing Allied numerical air superiority and continual retreats in the face of Allied ground advances meant JG I struggled to emulate earlier successes. From June 1917 until November 1918, JG I claimed 644 Allied aircraft destroyed, while losing 52 pilots killed in action and 67 wounded.

Wever died in an air crash on June 3, 1936, and his successor Albert Kesselring continued the project until he left office. History One of the Dornier Do 19 prototypes in flight Wever, the chief of staff of the newly formed Luftwaffe in 1933, realized the importance that strategic bombing would play in a war. In a war with the Soviet Union he expected that German forces would not attempt to move very far east of Moscow, which would leave much of Joseph Stalin's recently relocated industry out of reach of existing bombers. Wever proposed using a strategic bomber to reduce these factories, ending the Soviet ability to fight even without the need for ground forces to advance. Under the Ural bomber program, he began secret talks with two of Germany's leading aircraft manufacturers, Dornier and Junkers, requesting designs for a long-range bomber. The two companies responded with the Dornier Do 19 and the Junkers Ju 89 respectively and the Reich Ministry of Aviation (RLM; Reichsluftfahrtministerium) ordered prototypes for both aircraft in 1935. The program was not successful and was eventually canceled. The Dornier Do 19 V1 first flew on October 28, 1936, beating the Ju 89's first flight by some six months. The Do 19 was a nine-place four-engine monoplane, using a quartet of underpowered, 1930-era BMW/Bramo 322H nine-cylinder radials of only some 650 hp output each, themselves based on the even earlier Bristol Jupiter IV British radial of only some 430 hp each from 1926 — in comparison, the prototype American Boeing Model 299 four-engined bomber of 1935 used a quartet of the more advanced, 750 hp apiece Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet radial engines, themselves first run the same year as the Jupiter IV. The Do 19 V1 possessed defensive armament emplacements in dorsal and ventral locations, with dedicated nose and tail emplacements using turrets for the first time on a German bomber in such locations — these sorts of innovations could not save the design, for which only the V1 prototype was ever completed. A Junkers Ju 89 prototype in flight The Ju 89 also inspired the Junkers Ju 90 after Deutsche Luft Hansa requested a passenger version with lower-powered engines. When the Ural bomber program was canceled, the partially completed 3rd prototype was converted to passenger layout and served as a Ju 90 prototype instead. The Ju 90 was later pressed into military service as a patrol aircraft, as it was one of the few really long-range designs available in Germany. The Ju 90, in turn, led to the small-production series of Junkers Ju 290 four engined maritime patrol and long-range reconnaissance aircraft. According to some sources, the Ju 89 was considered to be the better performing of the two Ural bomber prototypes and after the cancellation of the project on 29 April 1937 the V1 and V2 prototypes continued to carry out flying trials and briefly served with the transport unit KGrzbV 105 during the Norway invasion. James Corum contends that contrary to popular belief, it was not Kesselring who killed off the Ural bomber concept; rather it was Hermann Göring who ceased strategic bomber development in Nazi Germany before the start of World War II, upon the advice of Kesselring, Ernst Udet and Erhard Milch. Kesselring was a vocal supporter of twin engine bombers and backed up Udet who preferred dive bombers. This was the questionable decision that was made to convert the Ju 88 medium bomber and the even more disastrous decision to convert the Heinkel He 177 heavy bomber, into a form of \\"Big Stuka\\" dive bomber, on the very day it was given its RLM airframe number of 8-177 on November 5, 1937. This move countered the request of Ernst Heinkel one year later, for the third and fourth He 177 V-series prototypes to be specifically built as true, four-separately-engined heavy bomber prototypes, rather than with the specified pair of DB 606 \\"twinned DB 601\\" power systems, weighing some 1.5 tonnes apiece, required for the He 177A to have the streamlining to accomplish dive-bombing missions. Milch wanted the project canceled simply because at that stage the German airplane industry was incapable of building a large fleet of heavy bombers and would remain so. Thus, Göring shelved the project and is later supposed to have said, \\"The Führer will never ask me how big our bombers are, but how many we have.\\" However, after pleas from the Chief of Branch 1 of the Luftwaffe Operations Staff, Major Paul Deichmann, to Göring, an about face occurred in late 1937, when specifications were issued to develop an aircraft to deliver a five-ton bomb load to New York. By March 1942, the Amerika Bomber project was initiated as a resuscitation of the Ural Bomber idea. The Amerika Bomber proposal first arrived in Göring's offices at the RLM in the spring-1942 timeframe, with the Messerschmitt Me 264, Junkers Ju 390 (itself based on the earlier Ju 290) and eventually the unfinalized nose-wheel gear design version of the Heinkel He 277 emerging as major competitors. These designs emerged or arrived much later than the operational shorter-range heavy bombers of both RAF Bomber Command and the USAAF had first been flown before, and early in, World War II. As 1943 progressed, Göring bemoaned the lack of a heavy bomber fleet and cursed those who had told him the medium bomber was superior to the heavy bomber. \\"Well, those inferior heavy bombers of the other side are doing a wonderful job of wrecking Germany from end to end,\\" was his acid-tongued response. Göring also had thought, as early as the previous year, that the He 177A was actually a \\"separately engined\\", true four-engined heavy bomber — but since the A-version of Heinkel's \\"heavy\\" was actually using the cumbersome Daimler-Benz DB 606 and 610 \\"power system\\" powerplants of some 1.5 tonnes apiece in weight, and with the Greif possessing inadequately designed engine nacelles and engine accommodation for such complex and heavy \\"power systems\\" to operate safely within them, a frustrated Reichsmarschall derided the heavy powerplants as zusammengeschweißte Motoren, or \\"welded-together engines\\" on numerous occasions from August 1942 onwards. Just one month later, in September 1942, a still-fuming Göring cancelled the dive-bombing requirement for the He 177A, which to all concerned at that time had proven to be an unrealistic demand for a 30-meter wingspan bomber's airframe. As an answer to the ongoing absence of any existing German combat aircraft design that could match the abilities of the Allies' examples of four-engined strategic bombers, the He 177B development of the A-version was an attempt to solve the problem and was well underway by the summer of 1943, with four prototypes of the Daimler-Benz DB 603-powered B-version being commissioned, with three of them built and two flying by the end of 1943. The He 177B, the later Heinkel He 274 high-altitude design; and by February 1943, the paper-only Heinkel He 277 Amerika Bomber — as the Heinkel firm's trans-Atlantic range design competition's candidate, forming the eventual trio of \\"four-engine\\" development programs emerging from the He 177A design, each being done entirely separate from the others — came the closest to providing the Luftwaffe with a true heavy bomber from the Heinkel firm's engineering departments. The original He 177A design, with its troublesome coupled Daimler-Benz 606 and 610 \\"power system\\" engines, was the basis for the He 177B and He 274 and the initial inspiration for the BMW 801 radial powered He 277, whose nosewheel-equipped fuselage for its Amerika Bomber design entry had much more of the general appearance of an enlarged Heinkel He 219 for its fuselage lines and layout. The conversion of four He 177As of various models was the method of creating the flying prototypes of the initial trio of He 177B prototypes built in Austria (with the V104 fourth prototype airframe underway), and the start of the construction of a pair of He 274 prototypes to be built in France. Both the quartet of commissioned He 177B prototype airframes and pair of He 274 prototypes used four individual Daimler-Benz DB 603 engines apiece, with the 274's powerplants having additional turbocharging for high-altitude flight, and would have provided the Luftwaffe with a bombing capability on par with RAF Bomber Command's Avro Lancaster. The events of the strengthening Oil Campaign of World War II offensive against Nazi Germany's petroleum, oil and lubricant resources and infrastructure sounded the death knell for all efforts towards giving its Luftwaffe any sort of cogent strategic bombing capability, and by early July 1944, the Jägernotprogramm ended all development of German military aircraft not usable for defensive purposes, focusing solely on advanced fighter designs instead.

He studied from 1992 to 1996 at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam. This included an exchange programme to Parsons School of Art and Cooper Union in New York. Van Munster's installations are to be found mostly in public spaces, where the surroundings play an important role in the work and how it is experienced. Sometimes, he chooses a location that suits an already made sketch, and sometimes he makes a work especially for a specific location. Although his works at first glance have a cheery or boyish look about them, there is a more sensitive idea at their basis. Recurrent underlying themes are desire, homesickness and sentiment: a frozen moment of happiness or a childhood memory. The sometimes even comical appearance of his work has the effect of a layer of pink sugar frosting. This can be witnessed in his Fata Morgana [Under heaven 02], built under the A10 highway in Amsterdam. An oasis under the highway, where palm trees, banana trees and flowers grow and a waterfall splashes down off some rocks. The sun appears always to be shining. All this is made of plastic and surrounded by metres-high steel fencing. He also built a tree, complete with tree-house, on the roof of the 50 metres high Stedelijk Museum when it was housed in the Post CS building in Amsterdam [Under heaven 01] and in the Green Heart’ area of the Netherlands, he floated a log with, on it, a fox with a white flag in his paws.

The more a particular animal abounded in the Holy Land, the more frequent allusions to it may be found. Species mentioned A closer examination of the way in which references to animals are introduced, the frequency of allusions to certain species, and the date of the documents in which they are found gives a fair idea of the conditions of the area at different stages of its history. The species, for instance, called in Hebrew 're'em', was very probably the aurochs, or wild ox and totally disappeared about the time of the Babylonian captivity. The wild ass, the lion and a few others long ago became extinct in Palestine. Other species alluded to in the Bible are now extremely scarce. The Bible mentions animals from varying regions of the Middle East. The ostrich, for instance, a denizen of the torrid regions, and the camel, of the waterless districts around Palestine, are mentioned side by side with the roebuck and deer of the woody summits of Lebanon. This variety, greater probably in Palestine than in any other country in the same latitude, is attributed to the great extremes of elevation and temperature in this small area. Palestinian fauna is not as rich today as it was during the Biblical times. The land is barren today but was well wooded when the Bible was written, especially on the hills east of the Jordan River. Recent excavations in the Timna Valley discovered what may be the earliest camel bones found in Israel or even outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This is seen as evidence that the stories of Abraham, Joseph, Jacob and Esau were written after this time. Classification of animals Although no regular classification is to be sought for in the Bible, animal creation is there practically divided into four classes, often called kinds,\\"after his kind, whose seed [is] in itself, upon the earth\\" - Genesis 1:11 according to the four different modes of locomotion. Among the animals, some walk, others fly, many are essentially swimmers and several crawl on the ground. This classification, more empiric than logical, would not by any means satisfy a modern scientist. It must be known, however, if we wish fairly to understand the language of the Scriptures on the matters connected therewith. The first class, the beasts, in the Biblical parlance, includes all large, walking animals, with the exception of the amphibia, such small animals as moles, mice and the like, and humans as they were not classified as animals. Beasts are divided into cattle, or domesticated (behemoth in the strict sense), and beasts of the field, i.e. wild animals. The fowls, which constitute the second class, include not only the birds, but also \\"all things that fly\\", even if they \\"go upon four feet\\", as the different kinds of locusts. Of the many \\"living beings that swim in the water\\" no particular species is mentioned; the \\"great whales\\" are set apart in that class, while the rest are divided according to whether they have, or have not, fins and scales (Leviticus 11:9, 10). The reptiles, or \\"creeping things\\", form the fourth class. References to this class are relatively few. However, it should be noticed that the \\"creeping things\\"\\"and there were in it all kinds of four-footed animals and crawling creatures of the earth and birds of the air\\" - Acts 10:12 include not only the reptiles properly so called, but also all short-legged animals or insects which seem to crawl rather than to walk, such as moles, lizards, etc. From a religious viewpoint, all these animals are divided into two classes, clean and unclean, according to whether they can, or cannot, be eaten.Moses, et al.

Stuart - Editor Kathy Hall - Country Canada - Genre Religious - Pages 499 - ","title":"Animals in the Bible"},{"id":"5704380","text":"This is a list of animals whose names appear in the Bible. Whenever required for the identification, the Hebrew name will be indicated, as well as the specific term used by zoologists. This list will include names such as griffon, lamia, Siren and unicorn, which, though generally applied to fabulous beings, have nevertheless, because of misunderstandings or educational prejudices of the Greek and Latin translators, crept into the versions, and have been applied to real animals. In the following list D.V. stands for Douay Version, A.V. and R.V. for Authorized and Revised Version respectively. A *Addax — A kind of antelope (antilope addax) with twisted horns; it very probably corresponds to the דִּישׁוֹן (dîshõn) of the Hebrews and the pygarg of the divers translations (Deuteronomy ). *Adder — A poisonous snake of the genus Vipera. The word, unused in the D.V., stands in the A.V. for four different Hebrew names of serpents. *Ant (נְמָלָה nəmālāh; Proverbs ; ) — Over twelve species of ants exist in Israel; among them the ants of the genus Atta are particularly common, especially the Atta barbara, of dark color, and the Atta structor, a brown species. These, with the Pheidole megacephala, are, unlike the ants of northern countries, accustomed to lay up stores of grain for winter use. Hence the allusions of the wise man in the two above-mentioned passages of Proverbs. *Antelope — The word, first applied as a qualification to the gazelle, on account of the lustre and soft expression of its eye, has become the name of a genus of ruminant quadrupeds intermediate between the deer and the goat. Four species are mentioned in the Bible: *# the דִּישׁוֹן dîshon (D.V. pygarg; Deuteronomy ), commonly identified with the Addax(Addax nasomaculatus); *# the צְּבִ֖י tsebhî (Deuteronomy , etc.; D.V. roe) or gazelle, Dorcas gazelle (Gazella dorcas); *# תְא֥וֹ the'ô (; D.V. wild goat; Isaiah , D.V. wild ox), which seems to be the bubal hartebeest (†Alcelaphus buselaphus buselaphus)); and *# the יַחְמ֑וּר yáhmûr (), the name of which is given by the Arabs to the roebuck (Capreolus capreolus) of Northern Syria and to the Arabian oryx (Oryx leucoryx)) (the white antelope,) of the desert. *Ape ( qōf) — Nowhere in the Bible is the ape supposed to be indigenous to Israel. Apes are mentioned with gold, silver, ivory, and peacocks among the precious things imported by Solomon from Tharsis (1 Kings ; 2 Chronicles ). The \\"ape\\" of the KJV is what is called an Old World monkey today. \\"True apes\\" (humans, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans) were known of only later. *Asp — This word, which occurs eleven times in D.V., stands for four Hebrew names: *# פֶתֶן péthén (; Job , ; Psalms 58 (Vulgate: Ps. 57):5; Isaiah ). From several allusions both to its deadly venom (Deuteronomy 32:33), and to its use by serpent-charmers (Ps. 58 (Vulgate: Ps. 57)), it appears that the cobra (naja aspis) is most probably signified. Safely to step upon its body, or even linger by the hole where it coils itself, is manifestly a sign of God's particular protection (Ps. 91 (Vulgate: Ps. 90); Isaiah 11:8]. Sophar, one of Job's friends, speaks of the wicked as sucking the venom of péthén, in punishment whereof the food he takes shall be turned within him into the gall of this poisonous reptile (Job 20:14, 16). *# עַכְשׁוּב ‘Akhshûbh, mentioned only once in the Hebrew Bible, namely Psalm 140, but manifestly alluded to in Psalm 13, and , seems to have been one of the most highly poisonous kinds of viper, perhaps the toxicoa, also called echis arenicola or scytale of the Pyramids, very common in Syria and North Africa. *# שַׁחַל sháhál is also found only once to signify a snake, Ps. 91 (Vulgate: Ps. 90): 13; but what particular kind of snake we are unable to determine. The word Sháhál (usually meaning \\"lion\\") might possibly, owing to some copyist's mistake, have crept into the place of another name now impossible to restore. *# צֶפַע tsif‘ōnî (), \\"the hisser\\", generally rendered by basilisk in ID.V. and in ancient translations, the latter sometimes calling it regulus. This snake was deemed so deadly that, according to the common saying, its hissing alone, even its look, was fatal. It was probably a small viper, perhaps a cerastes, possibly the daboia zanthina, according to Cheyne. *Ass — The ass (male עַיִר ’ăyir, female אָתוֹן ’ăṯōn, wild פֶרֶא pere) has always enjoyed a marked favour above all other beasts of burden in the Bible. This is evidenced by more than one hundred and thirty mentions of this animal in Bible, and by the number of words in the Hebrew vocabulary used to designate the ass, by colour, sex, age, and so forth, in striking contrast with the ordinary penury of the sacred language. Of these various names the most common is חֲמוֹר (hamôr), \\"reddish\\", the hair of the eastern ass being generally of that colour. White asses, more rare, were also more appreciated and reserved for the use of the nobles (Judges ). The custom was introduced very early, as it seems, and still prevails, to paint the most shapely and valuable donkeys in stripes of different colours. In the East the ass is much larger and finer than in other countries, and in several places the pedigrees of the best breeds are carefully preserved. Asses have always been an important item in the resources of the Eastern peoples, and we are repeatedly told in the Bible about the herds of these animals owned by the patriarchs (Genesis ; 30:43; 36:24, etc.), and wealthy Israelites (1 Samuel ; , etc.). Hence the several regulations brought forth by Israel's lawgiver on this subject: the neighbour's ass should not be coveted (Exodus 20:17); moreover, should the neighbour's stray ass be found, it should be taken care of, and its owner assisted in tending this part of his herd (). :The ass serves in the East for many purposes. Its even gait and sure-footedness, so well suited to the rough paths of the Holy Land, made it at all times the most popular of all the animals for riding in those hilly regions (Genesis 22:3; Luke 19:30). Neither was it ridden only by the common people, but also by persons of the highest rank (Judges 5:10; 10:4; 2 Samuel 17:23; 19:26, etc.). No wonder therefore that Jesus, about to come triumphantly to Jerusalem, commanded His disciples to bring Him an ass and her colt; no lesson of humility, as is sometimes asserted, but the affirmation of the peaceful character of His kingdom should be sought there. Although the Scripture speaks of \\"saddling\\" the ass, usually no saddle was used by the rider. A cloth was spread upon the back of the ass and fastened by a strap was all the equipment. Upon this cloth the rider sat with a servant usually walking alongside. Should a family journey, the women and children would ride the asses, attended by the father (Exodus 4:20). This mode of traveling has been popularized by Christian painters, who copied the eastern customs in their representations of the Holy Family's flight to Egypt. :Scores of passages in the Bible allude to asses carrying burdens. The Gospels, at least in the Greek text, speak of millstones run by asses (Matthew 18:6, Mark 9:41; Luke 17:2); Josephus and the Egyptian monuments teach us that this animal was used for threshing wheat. Finally, we repeatedly read in the Old Testament of asses hitched to a plough (Deuteronomy 22:10; Isaiah 30:24, etc.), and in reference to this custom, the Law forbade ploughing with an ox and an ass together (Deuteronomy 22:10). From Is., 21:7, confirmed by the statements of Greek writers, we learn that part of the cavalry force in the Persian army rode donkeys. We should perhaps understand from IV K., vii, 7, that the Syrian armies followed the same practice; but no such custom seems to have ever prevailed among the Hebrews. With them the ass was essentially for peaceful use, the emblem of peace, as the horse was the symbol of war. The flesh of the donkey was unclean and forbidden by the Law. In some particular circumstances, however, no law could prevail over necessity, and we read that during Joram's reign, when Ben-hadad besieged Samaria, the famine was so extreme in this city, that the head of an ass was sold for 120 pieces of silver (IV K., vi, 25). *Ass, colt — This is more specially the symbol of peace and meek obedience (John 12:15, πῶλον ὄνου pōlon onou). *Ass, wild, corresponds in the Old Testament to two words, péré' and 'arôdh. Whether these two names refer to different species, or are, the one, the genuine Hebrew name, the other, the Aramaic equivalent for the same animal, is uncertain. Both signify one of the wildest and most untamable animals. The wild ass is larger and more shapely than the domestic one, and outruns the fleetest horse. Its strength joined to its nimbleness and love of freedom made it a fit symbol for the first born son of Abraham who like Joseph was separated from his father and like Joseph became a great leader[Y'shmaEL], Ismael[ gen;17;20] (Genesis 16:12). The wild ass, extinct in western Asia, still exists in central Asia and the deserts of Africa. *Attacus (Leviticus 11:22) — Instead of this Latin word, the A.V. reads bald-locust. According to the tradition enshrined in the Talmud, the common truxalis, a locust with a very long smooth head is probably signified. The Hebrew word is סָלְעָם sālə‘ām. *Aurochs, or wild ox (urus, bos primigenius), is undoubtedly the rimu of the Assyrian inscriptions, and consequently corresponds to the re'em or rêm (רְאֵם) of the Hebrews. The latter word is translated sometimes in the D.V. as rhinoceros (Numbers 23:22; 24:8; Deuteronomy 33:17; Job 39:9, 10), sometimes by unicorn (Psalm 22:21; 29:6; 92:10; ). That the re'em, far from being unicorn, was a two-horned animal, is suggested by Psalm 22:21, and forcibly evidenced by Deut. 33:17, where its horns represent the two tribes of Ephraim and Manasses. That, moreover, it was akin to the domestic ox is shown from such parallelisms as we find in Psalm 24:6, where we read, according to the critical editions of the Hebrew text: \\"The voice of Yahweh makes Lebanon skip like a bullock, and Sirion like a young re'em\\"; or Is.,34:7: \\"And the re'em shall go down with them, and the bulls with the mighty\\"; and still more convincingly by such implicit descriptions as that of Job 39:9, 10: \\"Shall the rêm be willing to serve thee, or will he stay at thy crib? Canst thou bind the rêm with thy thong to plough, or will he break the clods of the valleys after thee?\\" These references will be very clear, the last especially, once we admit the re'em is an almost untamable wild ox, which one would try in vain to submit to the same work as its domestic kin. Hence there is very little doubt that in all the above-mentioned places the word aurochs should be substituted for rhinoceros and unicorn. The aurochs is for the sacred poets a familiar emblem of untamed strength and ferocity. It no longer exists in western Asia. B *Baboon, a kind of dog-faced, long-haired monkey, dwelling among ruins (gen. Cynocephalus); it was an object of worship for the Egyptians. Some deem it to be the \\"hairy one\\" (שָׂעִיר śə‘îr) spoken of in and , but it is very doubtful whether it ever existed west of the Euphrates. *Badger Tahashim — No mention of the badger (meles taxus) is found in the D.V., whereas the A.V. regularly gives it as the English equivalent for táhásh (תַּחַשׁ). Skins of táháshim are repeatedly spoken of as used for the outer coverings of the tabernacle and of the several pieces of its furniture and utensils and tools. The old translations, and the D.V. after them, understood the word táhásh to mean a color (violet; Exodus 25:5; 26:14; 35:7, 23; 36:19; 39:34; Numbers 4:6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 25; Ezekiel 16:10); but this is a \\"misrepresentation\\" according to Talmudic writers;International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (1915, 1939): B: badger. so also is the rendering of the A.V.; for though the badger is common in Israel, yet the Hebrew name \\"most probably\\" (according to 19th and early 20th century scholars) indicates the dugong (designated halicore hemprichii 1832, and halicore tabernaculi 1843), a sirenian living in the Red Sea, the skin of which is used to the present day by Bedouin Arabs for such purposes as those alluded to in the Bible. Nevertheless, this is in contradiction to Leviticus 11:10Hewlett, John Grigg, D.D. Bible difficulties explained (1860), pages 159–163 . (KJV) \\"And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you.\\" And Leviticus 11:27 says clearly (including the badger), \\"And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.\\" Leviticus explicitly commands the Jews, \\"Ye shall not make yourselves abominable...\\" (11:41–47). Strong's Concordance BADGERS' number 8476 תחש tachash says the word is probably of foreign derivation; a (clean) animal with fur, probably a species of antelope—badger. The opinion that tahash denotes the dugong is declining in recent decades in favor of \\"blue-processed skins\\" (Navigating the Bible II) and \\"(blue-)beaded skins\\" (Anchor Bible.) *Basilisk occurs in the D.V. as an equivalent for several Hebrew names of snakes: *# Péthén (Ps. xc, 13), the cobra; had the Latin and English translators been more consistent they would have rendered this Hebrew word here, as in the other places, by asp; *# Céphá' and Cíphe 'ônî (Prov., xxiii, 32; Is., xi. 8; xiv, 29; Jer., viii, '17; *# 'éphe'éh (Isaiah 59:5), a kind of viper impossible to determine, or perhaps the echis arenicola; *# flying sãrãph (Isaiah 14:29; 30:6), a winged serpent (?), possibly also a reptile like the draco fimbriatus, which, having long ribs covered with a fringe-like skin, is able to glide through the air for short distances. *Bat — The bat (עֲטַלֵּף ‘ăṭallêf), fourteen species of which still exist in Israel is reckoned among unclean \\"winged things\\" (Leviticus 11:19; Deuteronomy 14:18). Its abode is generally in dark and desolate places such as ruins and caverns. *Bear — The bear ( ḏōḇ) spoken of in the Bible is the Ursus syriacus, scarcely different from the brown bear of Europe. Since the destruction of the forests, it is now rarely seen south of Lebanon and Hermon, where it is common. Not infrequently met in the Holy Land during the Old Testament times, it was much dreaded on account of its ferocious and destructive instincts; to dare it was accordingly a mark of uncommon courage (1 Samuel 17:34–36). Its terror-striking roars and its fierceness, especially when robbed of its cubs, are repeatedly alluded to. *Beast, wild — The expression occurs twice in the D.V., but much oftener in the A.V., and R. V., where it is in several places a substitute for the awkward \\"beast of the field\\", the Hebrew name of wild animals at large. The first time we read of \\"wild beasts\\" in the D.V., it fairly stands for the Hebrew word zîz [Ps. lxxix (Hebr., lxxx), 14], albeit the \\"singular wild beast\\" is a clumsy translation. The same Hebrew word in Ps. xlix, 11, at least for consistency's sake, should have been rendered in the same manner; \\"the beauty of the field\\" must consequently be corrected into \\"wild beast\\". In Is., xiii, 21, \\"wild beasts\\" is an equivalent for the Hebr. Ciyyîm, i. e. denizens of the desert. This word in different places has been translated in divers manners: demons (Isaiah 34:14), dragons (Psalm 73:14; Jeremiah 1:39); it possibly refers to the hyena. *Bee (דְּבוֹרָה dəḇōrāh) — Israel, according to Scripture, is a land flowing with honey (Exodus 3:8). Its dry climate, its rich abundance, and variety of aromatic flowers, and its limestone rocks render it particularly adapted for bees. No wonder then that honey bees, both wild and hived, abound there. All the different species known by the names of bombus, nomia, andrena, osmia, megachile, anthophora, are widely spread throughout the country. The hived honey bee of Israel, apis fasciata, belongs to a variety slightly different from ours, characterized by yellow stripes on the abdomen. Wild bees are said to live not only in rocks [Ps. lxxx (Hebr., lxxxi), 17], but in hollow trees (1 Samuel 14:25), even in dried carcasses (Judges 14:8). Syrian and Egyptian hives are made of a mash of clay and straw for coolness. In Old Testament times, honey was an article of export (Genesis 43:11; Ezekiel 27:17). Bees are spoken of in Bible as a term of comparison for a numerous army relentlessly harassing their enemies. Debôrah, the Hebrew name for bee, was a favourite name for women. *Beetle, given by A.V. (Leviticus 11:22) as an equivalent for Hebrew, árbéh (אַרְבֶּה), does not meet the requirements of the context: \\"Hath the legs behind longer wherewith it hoppeth upon the earth\\", any more than the bruchus of D.V., some species of locust, Locusta migratoria being very likely intended. *Behemoth (בְּהֵמוֹת ḇəhêmōṯ) is generally translated as \\"great beasts\\"; in its wider signification it includes all mammals living on earth, but in the stricter sense is applied to domesticated quadrupeds at large. However, in Job , where it is left untranslated and considered a proper name, it indicates a particular animal. The description of this animal has long puzzled the commentators. Many of them now admit that it represents the hippopotamus; it might possibly correspond as well to the rhinoceros. *Bird — No other classification of birds than into clean and unclean is given. The Jews, before the Babylonian captivity, had no domestic poultry except pigeons. Although many birds are mentioned, there occur few allusions to their habits. Their instinct of migration, the snaring or netting them, and the caging of song birds are referred to. *Bird, dyed — So does the English version, Jer. 12:9, wrongly interpret the Hebrew 'áyit (עַיִט). which means beast of prey, sometimes also bird of prey or vulture. *Bird, singing — This singing bird of Zephaniah 2:14, according to the D.V., owes its origin to a mistranslation of the original, which most probably should be read: \\"And their voice shall sing at the window\\"; unless by a mistake of some scribe, the word qôl, voice, has been substituted for the name of some particular bird. *Birds, speckled, Hebrew tsāḇūa‘ (צָב֤וּעַ, Jeremiah 12:9). A much discussed translation. The interpretation of the English versions, however meaningless it may seem to some, is supported by the Targum, the Syriac, and St. Jerome. In spite of these authorities many modern scholars prefer to use the word hyena, given by the Septuagint and confirmed by Sirach, xiii, 22 as well as by the Arabic (dábúh) and rabbinical Hebrew (çebhôá'), names of the hyena. *Bison, According to several authors, the re'em (רְאֵם) of the Bible. It belongs to the same genus as the aurochs, but is specifically different from it. The European bison (Bison bonasus) is not believed to have been present in the Bible lands, though it did live in the Caucasus. *Bittern (botháurus vulgaris), a shy, solitary, wading bird related to the heron and inhabiting the recesses of swamps, where its startling, booming cry at night gives a frightening impression of desolation. In the D.V., bittern stands for Hebr. qã'ãth (קָאַת, Leviticus 11:18; Isaiah 34:11; Zephaniah 2:14), although by some inconsistency the same Hebrew word is rendered , by cormorant, and Ps. ci (Hebr., cii), 7, by pelican. The pelican meets all the requirements of all the passages where qã'ãth is mentioned, and would perhaps be a better translation than bittern. * certainly designates, , a voracious insect; the Hebrew צְלָצַל tsəlātsal, \\"chirping\\", suggests that the cricket was possibly meant and might be substituted for \\"blast.\\" In Psalm 78:46, blast stands for חָסִיל hãsîl, \\"the destroyer\\", perhaps the locust in its caterpillar state, in which it is most destructive. *Boar, wild — The only allusion to this animal is found Psalm 80:13 (חֲזִיר מִיָּ֑עַ‪‬ר ḥăzîr mîyā‘ar, \\"forest pig\\"); however, the wild boar was undoubtedly always, as it is now, common in Israel, having its lair in the woods, and most destructive to vineyards. *Bruchus — Though it occurs once (Leviticus 11:22) as an equivalent for Hebrew, 'ârbéh (probably Locusta migratoria), the word bruchus is the regular interpretation for יֶלֶק yéléq, \\"licker\\". The biblical bruchus may be fairly identified with the beetle, or some insect akin to it. Anyway, the yéléq of Jer., 51:14,27, should have been rendered in the same manner as everywhere else. *Bubale, Antilope bubalis, or Alcephalus bubalis, which should not be confounded with the bubale (water buffalo), Bos bubalus, is probably signified by the Hebrew, תְּאוֹ the'ô, interpreted by the Douay translators, wild goat, in Deut., 14:5, and wild ox, Is., li, 20. It still exists in Israel, but was formerly much more common than now. *Buffalo (Bison bonasus) — So does the D.V. translate the Hebrew, yáhmûr, III K., iv, 23 (Hebrews 1 Samuel 5:3). Being a denizen of marshy and swampy lands, the buffalo must have been scarcely known by the Hebrews. Moreover, its coarse, unpleasant-smelling flesh seems to exclude the identification with the animal referred to in the above-mentioned passage, where we should probably read roebuck. *Buffle — Another word for buffalo, D.V., Deut., xiv, 5. According to good authorities, the oryx, or white antelope, might be here intended, the Hebrew word יַחְמוּר yáhmûr possibly meaning, as its Arabic equivalent does, both the roebuck and the oryx. *Bull (פַר par)— A symbol of fierce and relentless adversaries, Psalm 22:12. *Bullock — The bullock (עֵגֶל ‘êḡel), as yet unaccustomed to the yoke, is an image of Israel's insubordinate mind before he was subdued by the captivity (Jeremiah 31:18). *Buzzard (Hebr., רָאָה rã'ah) — Probably the ringtail of D.V. and the glede of A.V. (Deuteronomy 14:13); possibly, through a scribe's error, might be identified with the kite, דָּאָה dã'ah, of Leviticus 11:14. The buzzard, three species of which exist in Israel, has always been common there. C *Calf ( ‘êḡel; feminine עֶגְלָה ‘eḡlāh) One of the most popular representations of the deity among the Canaanites. The calf is, in biblical poetry, a figure for vexing and pitiless foes, Psalm 111:13]. The fatted calf was a necessary feature, so to say, of a feast dinner. *Camel ( gəmal; juvenile or Dromedary בִּכְרָה biḵrāh) a prominent domestic animal of the East without the existence of which life in the Arabian deserts would be impossible. It was perhaps the first beast of burden applied to the service of man. It is mentioned as such in the biblical records as early as the time of Abraham. Recent excavations in the Timna Valley discovered what may be the earliest camel bones found in Israel or even outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This is seen as evidence by some that the stories of Abraham, Joseph, Jacob and Esau were written after this time. *Camelopardalis, occurs only once in the D.V. (Deuteronomy 14:5), as a translation of zémér (זֶמֶר). The word, a mere transcription of the Latin and the Greek, is a combination of the names of the camel and the leopard, and indicates the giraffe. But this translation, as well as that of the A.V. (chamois), is doubtless erroneous; neither the giraffe nor the chamois ever lived in Israel. The wild sheep or mouflon, which still lingers in Cyprus and Arabia Petraea, is very likely intended. *Cankerworm, the locust in its larva state, in which it is most voracious. So does A.V. render the Hebrew, gãzám (גָּזָם); the word palmerworm (Dichomeris ligulella), given by the D.V. seems better. *Cat — Mention of this animal occurs not once in the Protestant Bible. It is mentioned in Baruch 6:21 as resting on the top of false gods. The cat was very familiar to the Egyptians, it seems to have been known to the Jews, as well as to the Assyrians and Babylonians, even to the Greeks and Romans before the conquest of Egypt. *Cattle — Very early in the history of mankind, animals were tamed and domesticated, to be used in agriculture, for milk, for their flesh, and especially for sacrifices. Many words in Hebrew expressed the different ages and sexes of cattle, West of the Jordan River the cattle were generally stall-fed; in the plains and hills south and east they roamed in a half-wild state; such were the most famous \\"bulls of Bashan\\". *Cerastes (Hebr., שְׁפִיפֹן shephîphõn) should be substituted in D.V. for the colourless \\"serpent\\", Gen. 49:17. The identification of the shephîphõn with the deadly horned cerastes (Cerastes hasselquistii) is evidenced by the Arabic name of the latter (shúffon), and its customs in perfect agreement with the indications of the Bible. The cerastes, one of the most venomous of snakes, is in the habit of coiling itself in little depressions such as camels' footmarks, and suddenly darting on any passing animal. *Chameleon — Mentioned Lev. 11:30, with the mole (Hebr., תַּנְשֶׁמֶת tínshéméth). In spite of the authority of the ancient translations, it is now generally admitted that the tínshéméth is the chameleon, very common in Israel; whereas the כֹּחַ kôâh is a kind of large lizard, perhaps the land monitor (Psammosaurus scincus). *Chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra) is now totally unknown in western Asia, where it very probably never existed. The opinion of those who see it in the Hebrew zémér (זֶמֶר, Deuteronomy 14:5) should consequently be entirely discarded (see ). *Charadrion (Hebrew אֲנָפָה ’ănāp̄āh, Leviticus 11:19; Deuteronomy 14:18) would be the plover; but it rather stands here for the heron, all the species of which (this is the sense of the expression \\"according to its kind\\"), numerous in Israel, should be deemed unclean. *Cherogrillus (Leviticus 11:5; Deuteronomy 14:7), a mere transliteration of the Greek name of the porcupine, corresponds to the Hebrew שָׁפָן shãphãn, translated in Psalm 103:18, as irchin, and in Proverbs 30:26, as rabbit. As St. Jerome noticed it, the shãphãn is not the porcupine, but a very peculiar animal of about the same size, dwelling among the rocks, and in holes, and called in Israel \\"bear-rat\\", on account of some resemblance with these two quadrupeds. We call it coney, or daman (Hyrax syriacus). Its habit of lingering among the rocks is alluded to, Psalm 103:18; its wisdom and defencelessness, Proverbs 30:24–26. \\"It cannot burrow, for it has no claws, only nails half developed ; but it lies in holes in the rocks, and feeds only at dawn and dusk, always having sentries posted, at the slightest squeak from which the whole party instantly disappears. The coney is not a ruminant (cf. Leviticus 11:5), but it sits working its jaws as if re-chewing. It is found sparingly in most of the rocky districts, and is common about Sinai\\" (Tristram). *Cobra (Naja haje), most likely the deadly snake called פֶתֶן péthén by the Hebrews, found in Israel and Egypt and used by serpent-charmers. *Cochineal ( šənî; Coccus ilicis) — A hemiptera homoptera insect very common on the Syrian holm-oak, from the female of which the crimson dye kermes is prepared. The complete name in Hebrew is equivalent to \\"scarlet insect\\", the \\"insect\\" being not infrequently omitted in the translations. *Cock, Hen — Domestic poultry are not mentioned till after the Babylonian captivity is what some believe but others understand the \\"seal of Jaazaniah\\" from the ruins of the biblical Judean kingdom at Mizpah, with the inscription of \\"belonging to Jaazaniah, servant to the king\\"A history of ancient Israel and Judah by James Maxwell Miller and John Haralson HayesThe New Encyclopedia of Archaeological Excavations in the Holy Land, edited by E.

In Jesus' time domestic poultry, introduced from India through Persia, had become common, and their well-known habits gave rise to familiar expressions, and afforded good and easy illustrations (Mark 13:35; 14:30, etc.). Jesus Christ compared His care for Jerusalem to that of a hen for her brood, or more accurately an ornis, Strong's Concordance – 3733. ornis: a bird, specifically a rooster or hen a bird, specifically a rooster or hen. The three times the word 'cock' appears in the D.V. it is owing to a misinterpretation of the primitive text, according to some, but to others in the context of a religious instilling vessel of \\"a girt one of the loins\\" (Young's Literal Translation) that which is \\"stately in his stride\\" and \\"move with stately bearing\\" within the Book of Proverbs 30:29–31, Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon (Saadia Gaon) identifies the definitive trait of \\"a cock girded about the loins\\" within Proverbs 30:31(DV) as \\"the honesty of their behavior and their success\\",PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18 – Michael V. Fox – Yale University Press 2009 – 704 pages identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious and spiritual instilling schema. *# Job 38:36, the word sékhwi (שֶׂכְוִי) means soul, heart: \\"Who hath put wisdom in the heart of man? and who gave his soul understanding?\\", but also \\"Sekvi means 'rooster' according to the Sages\\" The Three Blessings:Boundaries, Censorship, and Identity in Jewish Liturgy: Boundaries, Censorship, and Identity in Jewish Liturgy – Oxford University Press, Dec 24, 2010 – page 142 and hence \\"Who hath put wisdom in the heart of man? or who gave the cock understanding?\\"(DV). *# , zãrzîr (זַרְזִיר) should be translated as \\"hero\\" according to some, but to others as \\"a cock girded about the loins\\" or \\"a girt one of the loins\\"(Young's Literal Translation), \\"which most of the old translations and Rabbis understood to be a fighting cock\\".Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament HALOT 1:281 s.v. zarzir *# , where the word gébhér (גֶּבֶר), great, strong man, has been rendered according to some rabbinical conceptions, but also the Hebrew word gever was used to mean a \\"rooster\\" in addition to the meaning of \\"man, strong man\\". *Cockatrice — A fabulous serpent supposed to be produced from a cock's egg brooded by a serpent; it was alleged that its hissing would drive away all other serpents, and that its breath, even its look, was fatal. The word is used in A.V. as the regular equivalent for Hebrew צֶפַע tsif‘ōnî. *Colt — See . *Coney — See . *Coral, Hebrew רָאמָה rãmôth, should probably be substituted, Job, 28:18, for \\"eminent things\\", and Ezekiel 27:16, for \\"silk\\" in the D.V. The coral dealt with at Tyre was that of the Red Sea or even of the Indian Ocean; coral seems to have been scarcely known among the Jews. *Cormorant (Leviticus 11:17; Deuteronomy 14:17), very frequently met with on the coasts, rivers, and lakes of Israel, probably corresponds to the shãlãk (שָׁלָךְ) of the Hebrew, although this name, which means \\"the plunger\\", might be applied to some other plunging bird. *Cow — See . *Crane (Grus grus) — The word does not occur in D.V., but seems the best translation of Hebrew עָגוּר, ‘āḡūr, read in two passages: Is. 38:14, and Jer. 8:7, where its loud voice and migratory instincts are alluded to. There is little doubt that the two above indicated places of D.V., where we read \\"swallow\\", should be corrected. *Cricket, a good translation for Hebrew צְלָצַל tsəlātsal, \\"chirping\\", which besides the feature suggested by the etymology, is described Deut. 28:42, as a voracious insect. See . *Crocodile — We do not read this word in any other place than Lev. 11:29 (D.V.), where it corresponds to the Hebrew, צָב tsāḇ; the animal is, nevertheless, oftener spoken of in the Holy Books under cover of several metaphors: רַהַב ráhâb, \\"the proud\\" (Isaiah 51:9); תנין tánnîn, \\"the stretcher\\" (Ezekiel 29:3); לִוְיָתָן líweyãthãn (leviathan) [Ps. lxxiii (Hebr., lxxiv), 14; Job, xl, 20, xli, 25]. See . The Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) is still found in great numbers in the upper Nile, and its range extended into present-day Israel until the early 20th century. A remarkable description of the crocodile has been drawn by the author of the Book of Job. He depicts the difficulty of capturing, snaring, or taming him, his vast size, his impenetrable scales, his flashing eyes, his snorting, and his immense strength. Dreadful as he is, the crocodile was very early regarded and worshipped as a deity by the Egyptians. He is, in the Bible, the emblem of the people of Egypt and their Pharaoh, sometimes even of all Israel's foes. *Cuckoo, according to some, would be the bird called in Hebrew שַׁחַף shâhâph (Leviticus ; Deuteronomy ), and there reckoned among the unclean birds. Two species, Cuculus canorus and Oxylophus glandarius live in the Holy Land; however there is little probability that the cuckoo is intended in the mentioned passages, where we should perhaps see the shearwater and the various species of seagulls. D *Deer — (Hebr., אַיָּל ’ayyāl, female אַיָּלָה ayyālāh). Its name is frequently read in the Scriptures, and its habits have afforded many allusions or comparisons, which fact supposes that the deer was not rare in Israel. Its handsome form, its swiftness, its shyness, the love of the roe for her fawns, are alluded to; it seems from Prov., v, 19 and some other indirect indications that the words 'áyyãl and 'áyyãlah (deer and hind) were terms of endearment most familiar between lovers. *Demons (Isaiah 34:14) — So does D.V., translate צִיִּים֙ tsîyîm; it is certainly a mistake. The word at issue is generally believed to refer to the hyena (Hyaena hyaena), still found everywhere in caves and tombs *Dispas — The D.V., following the Vulgate (Deuteronomy 8:15) thereby means a serpent whose bite causes a mortal thirst; but this interpretation seems to come from a misunderstanding suggested by the Septuagint; the original writer most likely intended there to mean \\"drought\\" (צִמָּאוֹן tsimmā’ōn, \\"thirsty ground\\"), as the A.V. rightly puts it, and not any kind of serpent. *Dog — The dog ( keleḇ) in the East does not enjoy the companionship and friendship of man as in the western countries. Its instinct has been cultivated only insofar as the protecting of the flocks and camps against wild animals is concerned. In the towns and villages it roams in the streets and places, of which it is the ordinary scavenger; packs of dogs in a half-wild state are met with in the cities and are not infrequently dangerous for men. For this reason the dog has always been, and is still looked upon with loathing and aversion, as filthy and unclean. With a very few exceptions, whenever the dog is spoken of in the Bible (where it is mentioned over 40 times), it is with contempt, to remark either its voracious instincts, or its fierceness, or its loathsomeness; it was regarded as the emblem of lust, and of uncleanness in general. As some Muslims, to the present day, term Christians \\"dogs\\", so did the Jews of old apply that infamous name to Gentiles. A greyhound is mentioned in Proverbs 30:31. *Dove (Hebr., יוֹנָה yônah) — Though distinguishing it from tôr, the turtle-dove, the Jews were perfectly aware of their natural affinity and speak of them together. The dove is mentioned in the Bible more often than any other bird (over 50 times); this comes both from the great number of doves flocking in Israel, and of the favour they enjoy among the people. The dove is first spoken of in the record of the flood (Genesis 8:8–12); later on we see that Abraham offered up some in sacrifice, which would indicate that the dove was very early domesticated. In fact several allusions are made to dove-cotes, with their \\"windows\\" or latticed openings. But in olden times as well as now, besides the legions of pigeons that swarm around the villages, there were many more rock-doves, \\"doves of the valleys\\", as they are occasionally termed (Ezekiel 7:16; Song of Songs 2:14; Jeremiah 48:28), that filled the echoes of the mountain gorges with the rustling of their wings. The metallic lustre of their plumage, the swiftness of their flight, their habit of sweeping around in flocks, their plaintive coo, are often alluded to by the different sacred writers. The dark eye of the dove, encircled by a line of bright red skin, is also mentioned; its gentleness and innocence made it the type of trust and love, and, most naturally, its name was one of the most familiar terms of endearment. Jesus spoke of the dove as a symbol of simplicity; the sum of its perfections made it a fitting emblem for the Holy Spirit. *Dragon, a word frequently found in the translations of the Bible as substitute, so it seems, for other names of animals that the translators were unable to identify. It stands indeed for several Hebrew names: *# תַנִּ֑ thán (Job 30:29; Isaiah 34:13; 35:7; 43:20; Jeremiah 9:11; 10:22; 14:6; 49:33; 51:37; Micah 1:8; Malachi 1:3), unquestionably meaning a denizen of desolate places, and generally identified with the jackal; *# תנין tánnîn, in a few passages with the sense of serpent [Deuteronomy 32:33; Psalm xc (Hebr., xci), 13; Dan., xiv, 22-27], in others most likely signifying the crocodile [Ps., lxxiii (Hebr., lxxiv), 13; Isaiah 51:9; Ezekiel 29:3], or even a sea-monster (Ezekiel 32:2), such as a whale, porpoise, or dugong, as rightly translated in Lam., iv, 3, and as probably intended in Ps., cxlviii, 7; *# לִוְיָתָן líweyãthãn (leviathan), meaning both the crocodile [Ps., lxxiii (Hebr., lxxiv), 14] and sea-monster [Ps. ciii (Hebr., civ), 26]; *# צִיִּים֙ tsîyîm (Psalm 73:14; Jeremiah 1:39), which possibly means the hyena. :Other places, such as ; ; Ecclus., xxv, 23, can be neither traced back to a Hebrew original, nor identified with sufficient probability. The author of the Apocalypse repeatedly makes mention of the dragon, by which he means \\"the old serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, who seduceth the whole world\\" (, etc.). Of the fabulous dragon fancied by the ancients, represented as a monstrous winged serpent with a crested head and enormous claws, and regarded as very powerful and ferocious, no mention is found in the Bible. The word dragon, consequently, should really be removed from Bibles, except perhaps from and , where the draco fimbriatus is possibly spoken of. See , 4. *Dromedary — Hebrew: , biḵrāh, in Isaiah 60:6, signifies \\"a swift and finely bred camel\\". *Dugong — See . E *Eagle — So is generally rendered the Hebrew, נֶשֶׁר néshér, but there is a doubt as to whether the eagle or some kind of vulture is intended. It seems even probable that the Hebrews did not distinguish very carefully these different large birds of prey, and that all are spoken of as though they were of one kind. Anyway, four species of eagles are known to live in Israel: Aquila chrysaetos, Clanga pomarina, Aquila heliaca, and Circaetus gallicus. Many allusions are made to the eagle in the Bible: its inhabiting the dizziest cliffs for nesting, its keen sight, its habit of congregating to feed on the slain, its swiftness, its longevity, its remarkable care in training its young, are often referred to (see in particular Job 39:27-30). When the relations of Israel with their neighbours became more frequent, the eagle became, under the pen of the Jewish prophets and poets, an emblem first of the Assyrian, then of the Babylonian, and finally of the Persian kings. *Elephant — We learn from Assyrian inscriptions that before the Hebrews settled in Syria, there existed elephants in that country, and Tiglath-Pileser I tells us about his exploits in elephant hunting. We do not read, however, of elephants in the Bible until the Maccabean times. True, III Kings speaks of ivory, or \\"[elephants'] teeth\\", as the Hebrew text puts it, yet not as indigenous, but as imported from Ophir. In the post-exilian times, especially in the books of the Maccabees, elephants are frequently mentioned; they were an important element in the armies of the Seleucids. These animals were imported either from India or from Africa. *Ericus, a Latin name of the hedgehog, preserved in the D.V. as a translation of the Hebrew word קִפוֹד qíppôdh (Isaiah 14:23; 34:11; Zephaniah 2:14, the word urchin has been used) and קִפוֹז qîppôz (Isaiah 34:15). The above identification of the qíppôdh is based both on the Greek rendering and the analogy between this Hebrew word and the Talmudic (qúppádh), Syriac (qufdô'), Arabic (qúnfúd) and Ethiopian (qinfz) names of the hedgehog. Several scholars, however, discard this identification, because the hedgehog, contrary to the qíppôdh, lives neither in marshes nor ruins, and has no voice. The bittern meets all the requirements of the texts where the qíppôdh is mentioned. It should be noticed nevertheless that hedgehogs are far from rare in Israel. As to the qîppôz of Is. 34:15, read qíppôdh by some Hebrew Manuscripts, and interpreted accordingly by the Septuagint, Vulgate and the versions derived therefrom, its identity is a much discussed question. Some, arguing from the authorities just referred to, confound it with the qíppôdh, whereas others deem it to be the arrow-snake; but besides that no such animal as arrow-snake is known to naturalists, the context seems to call for a bird. *Ewe ( rəḥêl) — In Hebrew, six names at least, with their feminines, express the different stages of development of the sheep. Its domestication goes back to the night of time, so that the early traditions enshrined in the Bible speak of the first men as shepherds. Whatever may be thought of this point, it is out of question that from the dawn of historical times down to our own, flocks have constituted the staple of the riches of the land. The ewe of Israel is generally the ovis laticaudata, the habits of which, resembling those of all other species of sheep, are too well known to be here dwelt upon. Let it suffice to notice that scores of allusions are made in the Holy Books to these habits as well as to the different details of the pastoral life. F *Falcon — See . *Fallow-deer (Cervus dama or Dama vulgaris). The fallow-deer is scarce in the Holy Land and found only north of Mount Thabor. If it is mentioned at all in the Bible, it is probably ranked among the deer. *Faun — An equivalent in D.V. (Jeremiah 1:39), after St. Jerome, for Hebrew, 'íyyîm. St. Jerome explains that they were wild beings, denizens of deserts and woods, with a hooked nose, a horned forehead, and goat feet. He translated the Hebrew as fig-faun, adding to the original the adjective ficarii, possibly following in this the pagan idea which, supposing that figs incline to lust, regarded fig- groves a well fitted abode for fauns. The same Hebrew word is rendered in Is., xiii, 22 as owls, and in Is., xxxiv, 14, as monsters, which shows a great perplexity on the part of the translators. The true meaning, being \\"howlers\\", seems to point out the jackal, called the \\"howler\\" by the Arabs. *Fawn (Proverbs 5:19), for Hebrew, yá'alah, feminine of yã'el which should be regularly, as it is in several passages, rendered by wild goat (ibex syriacus). See . *Fish — Fish are mentioned extensively in the Bible, although no particular species is named. Fishermen are mentioned in both Old and New Testaments, including several of Jesus' followers. The biblical fish category includes marine mammals. (\\"Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones...\\" Lamentations 4:3 A.V. & D.V.) Jonah's fish: According to the Book of Jonah, a \\"great fish\\" swallowed the prophet Jonah (Jonah 1:17 A.V.), and he was in its belly for three days, before being vomited up. Matthew 12:40 refers to it as a whale.Matthew 12:40 (multiple versions) As early as the Wessex Gospels of 990 CE the Greek \\"κήτους\\" of Matthew 12:40 was translated as \\"hwæle\\" (whale). The Greek Septuagint translated the fish of Jonah 1:17 as \\"κήτους\\". *Flea, spoken of I K., xxiv, 15; xxvi, 20, as the most insignificant cause of trouble that may befall a man. *Flock — The flocks of Israel include generally both sheep and goats: \\"The sheep eat only the fine herbage, whereas the goats browse on what the sheep refuse. They pasture and travel together in parallel columns, but seldom intermingle more closely, and at night they always classify themselves. The goats are for the most part black, the sheep white, dappled or piebald, forming a very marked contrast...\\" (Tristram). The shepherd usually leads the flock, calling the sheep by their names from time to time; in his footsteps follows an old he-goat, whose stately bearing affords to the natives matter for several comparisons; the Arabs, indeed to this day, call a man of stately mien a \\"he-goat\\". The shepherd at sunset waters his flock, folds them ordinarily in some of the many caves found on every hillside, and with trained dogs guards them at night. *Fly — Two Hebrew words are thus translated: *# 'ãrõbh is the name of the Egyptian fly of the fourth plague; this name, a collective one, though translated as dog-fly in the Septuagint, seems to signify all kinds of flies. Flies are at all times an almost insufferable nuisance; the common house-fly, with the gnat, vexes men, while gad-flies of every description tsetse, œstru, hippoboscida, tabanus marocanus, etc., infest animals. *# Zebhûbh is likewise the collective name of the Israeli fly, but more specifically of the gad-fly. :Though a trifle less annoying than in Egypt, flies were, however, deemed a plague severe enough in Israel to induce the natives to have recourse to the power of a special god, Bá'ál-zebhûbh, the master of the flies, that they and their cattle be protected against that scourge. *Fowl — This word which, in its most general sense, applies to anything that flies in the air (Genesis 1:20, 21), including the \\"bat\\" and \\"flying creeping things\\" (Leviticus 11:19-23 A.V.), and which frequently occurs in the Bible with this meaning, is also sometimes used in a narrower sense, as, for instance, III K., iv, 23, where it stands for all fatted birds that may be reckoned among the delicacies of a king's table; so likewise Gen., xv, 11 and Is., xviii, 6, where it means birds of prey in general. In this latter signification allusions are made to their habit of perching on bare or dead trees, or of flocking together in great numbers. *Fox — Thus is usually rendered the Hebrew, shû'ãl, which signifies both fox and jackal, even the latter more often than the former. The fox, however, was well known by the ancient Hebrews, and its cunning was as proverbial among them as among us (Ezekiel 13:4; Luke 13:32). *Frog — Though not rare in Israel, this word is only mentioned in the Old Testament in connection with the second plague of Egypt. Two species of frogs are known to live in the Holy Land: the rana esculenta, or common edible frog, and the hyla arborea, or green tree-frog. The former throngs wherever there is water. In Apoc., xvi, 13, the frog is the emblem of unclean spirits. G *Gazelle (Hebr., çebî, i. e. beauty) has been known at all times as one of the most graceful of all animals. Several species still exist in Israel. Its different characteristics, its beauty of form, its swiftness, its timidity, the splendour and meekness of its eye, are in the present time, as well as during the age of the Old Testament writers, the subjects of many comparisons. However, the name of the gazelle is scarcely, if at all, to be found in the Bible; in its stead we read roe, hart, or deer. Like a few other names of graceful and timid animals, the word gazelle has always been in the East a term of endearment in love. It was also a woman's favourite name (1 Chronicles 8:9; 2 Kings 12:1; 2 Chronicles 24:1; Acts 9:36). *Gecko — Probable translation of the 'anãqah of the Hebrews, generally rendered in our versions by shrew-mouse, for which it seems it should be substituted. The gecko, ptyodactylus gecko of the naturalists, is common in Israel. *Gier-eagle — So does A.V. render the Hebrew, rãhãm (Leviticus 11:18) or rãhãmah (Deuteronomy 14:17). By the gier-eagle, the Egyptian vulture (neophron percnopterus), or Pharao's hen, is generally believed to be signified. However, whether this bird should be really recognized in the Hebrew, rãhãm, is not easy to decide; for while, on the one hand, the resemblance of the Arabic name for the Egyptian vulture with the Hebrew word rãhãm seems fairly to support the identification, the mention of the rãhãm in a list of wading birds, on the other hand, casts a serious doubt on its correctness. *Giraffe — See . Probably the תחשׁ (taḥash). (Numbers 4:5-15). Mistranslated as badger or dolphin. *Gnat — The same insect called sciniph in Ex., viii, 16, 17 and Ps. civ (Hebr., cv), 31, and known under the familiar name of mosquito, Culex pipiens, is taken in the New Testament as an example of a trifle. *Goat — Though the sacred writers spoke of the ewe more frequently than of the goat, yet with the latter they were very well acquainted. It was indeed, especially in the hilly regions east of the Jordan, an important item in the wealth of the Israelites. The goat of Israel, particularly the capra membrica, affords numerous illustrations and allusions, Its remarkably long ears are referred to by Amos, iii, 12; its glossy dark hair furnishes a graphic comparison to the author of Cant., iv, 1; vi, 4; this hair was woven into a strong cloth; the skin tanned with the hair on served to make bottles for milk, wine, oil, water, etc. The kid was an almost essential part of a feast. The goat is mentioned in Dan., viii, 5, as the symbol of the Macedonian empire. The grand Gospel scene of the separation of the just and the wicked on the last day is borrowed from the customs of the shepherds in the East. *Goat, wild, Job, xxxix, 1; I K., xxiv, 3, where it is an equivalent for yã' él, translated in Ps., ciii (Hebr., Civ), 18, as hart and in Prov., v, 19, as fawn, is most probably the ibex syriacus, a denizen of the rocky summits [Ps. ciii (Hebr., civ), 18]. It was regarded as a model of grace (Proverbs 5:19), and its name, Jahel, Jahala, was frequently given to persons (Judges 5:6; Ezra 2:56, etc.). *Grasshopper, is probably the best rendering for the Hebrew, hãgãb [Lev.11:22; Num. 13:34 (Hebrews 13:33); Isaiah 40:22; Eccles. 12:5, etc.], as in the A.V., if the Hebrew word be interpreted \\"hopper\\" as :de:Karl August Credner suggests; the D.V. uses the word locust. The grasshopper is one of the smaller species of the locust tribe. *Griffon — So D.V., Lev. 11:13 (whereas Deuteronomy , we read \\"grype\\") translates the Hebrew, pérés, the \\"breaker\\" whereby the lammergeyer or bearded vulture, gypœtus barbatus, the largest and most magnificent of the birds of prey is probably intended. The opinion that the Bible here speaks of the fabulous griffon, i.e. a monster begotten from a lion and an eagle, and characterized by the beak, neck, and wings of an eagle and the legs and rump of a lion, is based only on a misinterpretation of the word. *Griffon vulture, a probable translation in several cases of the Hebrew, néshér, regularly rendered by eagle. This most majestic bird (Gyps fulvus), the type, as it seems, of the eagle-headed figures of Assyrian sculpture, is most likely referred to in Mich., i, 16, on account of its bare neck and head. *Grype, . See . H *Haje — See . *Hare — Mentioned Lev., xi, 6; Deut., xiv, 7, in the list of the unclean quadrupeds. Several subspecies of the European hare and the Cape hare live in Israel: Lepus europaeus syriacus in the north; Lepus europaeus judeae in the south and the Jordan valley, together with Lepus capensis sinaiticus, Lepus capensis aegyptius and Lepus capensis isabellinus, The statement of the Bible that the hare \\"cheweth the cud\\" is a classical difficulty. It should be noticed that this is not the reason why the hare is reckoned among the unclean animals; but the cause thereof should be sought for in the fact that though it chews the cud, which certainly it appears to do, it does not divide the hoof. *Hart and hind — Either the fallow-deer, still occasionally found in the Holy Land, or the red deer, now extinct, or the deer generally. It has afforded many illustrations to time biblical writers and poets, especially by its fleetness (Song of Songs 2:9; Isaiah 35:6), its sure-footedness [Ps. xvii (Hebr., xviii), 34; Hab., iii, 19], its affection (Proverbs 5:19), and its habit of hiding its young (Job 39:1). *Hawk (Hebr., neç) is, in the Scriptures, a general denomination including, with the falcon, all the smaller birds of prey, the kestrel, merlin, sparrowhawk, hobby, and others, most common in Israel. *Night hawk, A.V. for Hebrew, táhmãs, more exactly translated in D.V. as owl; some bird of the latter kind is indeed undoubtedly intended, probably the barn owl (strix flammea). *Sparrow hawk (Accipiter nisus), one of the hawks of Israel, so common that it might be regarded, in reference to the Bible, as the hawk par excellence. *Hedgehog — See . *Hen, See . *Heron — Mentioned Lev., xi, 19, in the list of unclean birds, but probably in the wrong place in the D.V.; heron, indeed, should be substituted for charadrion, whereas in the same verse it stands for stork, as the A.V. correctly states it. *Hind — See . *Hippopotamus — See . *Hobby (falco subbuteo). See . *Hoopoe — See . *Hornet (Hebr., çíre'ah; vespa crabro) — One of the largest and most pugnacious wasps; when disturbed they attack cattle and horses; their sting is very severe, capable not only of driving men and cattle to madness, but even of killing them (Exodus 23:28; Deuteronomy 7:20; Joshua 24:12). *Horse — The horse is never mentioned in Scripture in connection with the patriarchs; the first time the Bible speaks of it, it is in reference to the Egyptian army pursuing the Hebrews, During the epoch of the conquest and of Judges, we hear of horses only with the Chanaanean troops, and later on with the Philistines, The hilly country inhabited by the Israelites was not favourable to the use of the horse; this is the reason why the Bible speaks of horses only in connection with war. David and Solomon established a cavalry and chariot force; but even this, used exclusively for wars of conquest, seems to have been looked upon as a dangerous temptation to kings, for the Deuteronomy legislation forbids them to multiply horses for themselves. The grand description of the war horse in Job is classical; it will be noticed, however, that its praises are more for the strength than for the swiftness of the horse. The prophet Zacharias depicts (ix, 10) the Messianic age as one in which no hostilities will be heard of; then all warlike apparel being done away with, the horse will serve only for peaceful use. *Houp (Leviticus 11:19; Deuteronomy 14:18) — The analogy of the Hebrew with Syriac and Coptic for the name of this bird makes the identification doubtless, although some, after the example of the A.V., see in the Hebrew dûkhîpháth, the lapwing. The Egyptians worshipped the houp and made it the emblem of Horus. *Striped hyena — This word is not to be found in any of the English translations of the Bible; it occurs twice in the Septuagint, Jer., xii, 9, and Ecclus., xiii, 22, being in both places the rendering for the Hebrew name çãbhûá. The hyenas are very numerous in the Holy Land, where they are most active scavengers; they feed upon dead bodies, and sometimes dig the tombs open to get at the corpses therein buried. Two Hebrew names are supposed to designate the hyena: *# çãbhûá'. This word, which has been interpreted \\"speckled bird\\", Jer., xii, 9, by modern translators following the Vulgate, has been rendered by \\"holy man\\", Ecclus., xiii, 22. Despite the authorities that favour the above-mentioned translation of Jer., xii, 9, the consistency of the Septuagint on the one hand, and on the other the parallelism in the latter passage, in addition to the analogy with the Arabic and rabbinical Hebrew names for the hyena, fairly support the identification of the çãbhûá' with this animal. *# çíyyím, rendered in divers manners in different places: wild beasts, Is., xiii, 21; demons, Is., xxxiv, 14; dragons, Ps. lxxiii (hebr., lxxiv), 14; Jer., 1, 39. I *Ibex — See . *Ibis — The word occurs twice in the D.V. (Leviticus ; Isaiah ) as an equivalent for yánshûph; some good authorities, however, though the yánshûph is mentioned among wading birds, do not admit the above identification and think that the Egyptian eagle-owl (Bubo ascalaphus), which they term great owl, is spoken of. The ibis was worshipped by the Egyptians as the emblem of Thoth. *Ichneumon — See . *Irchin — D.V. . See . J *Jackal — Frequently alluded to in Bible, though the name is read neither in the D.V. nor in any of the western translations, probably because the animal, however common in Africa and south-western Asia is unknown in European countries. The name regularly substituted for jackal is fox. The jackal seems to be designated in Hebrew by three different names: shû'ãl, \\"the digger\\"; 'íyyîm, \\"the howlers\\"; and tãn, \\"the stretcher\\", although we are unable to state the differences marked by these three names, numerous references may be found throughout the Bible to the jackal's howlings and gregarious habits. The most likely species mentioned is the golden jackal, which is the only jackal to live in the Middle East. *Jerboa — This little animal, at least four species of which abide in Syria, is nowhere nominally mentioned in the Bible; it must, nevertheless, very probably be reckoned among the unclean animals indicated under the general name of mouse. K *Kestrel — A slender falcon, most likely one of the species intended by , for it is very common in Israel. The remark of Job , strikingly points out the Tinnulus cenchris, one of the Israeli kestrels. *Kid — See . *Kind — See . *Kine — See . *Kite — As suggested by the analogy with the Arabic, the black kite (Milvus migrans) is probably meant by Hebr. dã'ah or dáyyah (Leviticus ; Deuteronomy ; Isaiah ), interpreted kite in the D.V.; it is one of the most common of the scavenger birds of prey of the country, and for this reason, is carefully protected by the villagers. Other kinds of kites, in particular the Milvus regalis, are common in Israel. L *Lamb — The Paschal Lamb was both a commemoration of the deliverance from the bondage in Egypt, and a prophetic figure of the Son of God sacrificed to free His people from their slavery to sin and death. See . *Lamia (Isaiah 34:14) — Is a translation of Hebrew, lîlîth; according to the old popular legends, the lamia was a feminine bloodthirsty monster, devouring men and children. In the above cited place, some kind of owl, either the screech or the hooting owl, is very probably meant. *Lammergeyer (gypœtus barbatus) very likely signified by the Hebrew, pérés, translated as griffon in D.V. *Larus — Lev., xi; 16; Deut., xiv, 15. See . *Horse-leech (Proverbs 30:15) — Both the medicinal leech and the horse- leech are frequently found in the streams, pools, and wells; they often attach themselves to the inside of the lips and nostrils of drinking animals, thereby causing them much pain. *Leopard — Under this name come a certain number of carnivorous animals more or less resembling the real leopard (felis leopardus), namely felis jubata, felis lynx, felis uncia, etc., all formerly numerous throughout Israel, and even now occasionally found, especially in the woody districts. The leopard is taken by the biblical writers as a type of cunning (Jeremiah 5:6; Hosea 13:7), of fierceness, of a conqueror's sudden swoop (Dan., vii, 6; Hab., i, 8). Its habit of lying in wait by a well or a village is repeatedly alluded to. *Leviathan — The word Leviathan (Hebrew, líweyãthãn), which occurs six times in the Hebrew Bible, seems to have puzzled not a little all ancient translators. The D.V. has kept this name, Job, iii, 8; xl, 20; Is., xxvii, 1; it is rendered by dragon Ps. lxxiii (Hebr., lxxiv), 14, and ciii (Hebr., civ), 26; The word leviathan means a sea-monster in Isaiah 27:1); Job 41 *Lion — Now extinct in Israel and in the surrounding countries, the lion was common there during the Old Testament times; hence the great number of words in the Hebrew language to signify it; under one or another of these names it is mentioned 130 times in the Scriptures, as the classical symbol of strength, power, courage, dignity, ferocity. Very likely as the type of power, it became the ensign of the tribe of Judah; so was it employed by Solomon in the decoration of the temple and of the king's house. For the same reason, Apoc., v, 5, represents Jesus Christ as the lion of the tribe of Juda. The craft and ferocity of the lion, on the other hand, caused it to be taken as an emblem of Satan (1 Peter 5:8) and of the enemies of the truth (2 Timothy 4:17). *Lizard — Immense is the number of these reptiles in Israel; no less than 44 species are found there, Among those mentioned in the Bible we may cite: *# The Letã'ah, general name of the lizard, applied especially to the common lizard, the green lizard, the blindworm, etc.; *# the chõmét, or sand lizard; *# the çãb, or dább of the Arabs (Uromastix spinipes); *# the kõâh, the divers kinds of monitor (psammosaurus scincus, hydrosaurus niloticus, etc.); *# the 'anãqah or gecko; *# the semãmîth or stellio. *Locust — One of the worst scourges of the East, very often referred to in Bible. As many as nine Hebrew words signify either the locust in general or some species: *# 'árbéh, probably the locusta migratoria; *# gãzãm, possibly the locust in its larva state, the palmerworm; *# Gôbh, the locust in general; *# chagab, most likely the grasshopper; *# hãsîl, \\"the destroyer\\", perhaps the locust in its hopper state, in which it is most destructive; *# hárgõl, translated in the D.V. as ophiomachus; *# yéléq, the stinging locust; *# çelãçâl possibly the cricket; and *# sôl'ãm, rendered by attacus, or bald locust (probably the truxalis). :Unlike other insects, locusts are most voracious in every stage of their existence. *Louse — According to some this species of vermin was one of the features of the third Egyptian plague. It is but too common through all eastern countries. M *Mildew — A word occurring a certain number of times in the D.V. as an equivalent for Hebrew, hãsîl, which probably means a kind of locust. *Mole — Two Hebrew words are thus rendered, The first, tînshéméth (Leviticus 11:30), would, according to good authorities, rather signify the chameleon; with the second, haphárperôth (Isaiah 2:20), some burrowing animal is undoubtedly intended, The mole of Syria is not the common mole of Europe, Talpa europaea, but a blind mole rat (Spalax typhlus), a blind burrowing rodent. *Monkey — See . Occurs in 1 Kings 10:22 (NKJV). *Mosquito — See . *Moth — Is in the D.V. besides Is., xiv, 11, where it stands for rímmah, \\"worms\\", the common rendering for two words: 'ãsh (Job 4:19), and sãs (Isaiah 51:8), the exact meaning of the former is uncertain, whereas by the latter the clothes moth is meant. *Mouflon — See . *Mouse — This word seems to be a general one, including the various rats, dormice, jerboas, and hamsters, about twenty-five species of which exist in the country. *Mule — In spite of the enactment of the Law (Leviticus 19:19), the Israelites early in the course of their history possessed mules; these animals, in a hilly region such as the Holy Land, were for many purposes preferable to horses and stronger than asses; they were employed both for domestic and warlike use. N *Night-hawk — See . O *Oryx — See . *Osprey (Hebr. עָזְנִיָּה ‘āzənîyāh) — The fishing eagle, which name probably signifies all the smaller eagles. *Ossifrage — See . *Ostrich — Still occasionally found in the southeastern deserts of Israel, the ostrich, if we are to judge from the many mentions made of it, was well known among the Hebrews. The beauty of its plumage, its fleetness, its reputed stupidity, its leaving its eggs on the sand and hatching them by the sun's heat are repeatedly alluded to. Know in Hebrew as יָעֵן (ya‘ên) or as רֶנֶנִ֥ (rənān, \\"[bird of] piercing cries\\"). The word תַּחְמָס (taḥmās) may refer to a male ostrich, but is also conjectured as \\"owl\\" or \\"swallow.\\" *Owl — A generic name under which many species of nocturnal birds are designated, some having a proper name in the Hebrew (יַנְשׁוּף yanšōp̄, אֹחַ ’ōḥ, כּוֺס kōs), some others possessing none. Among the former we may mention the little owl (Athene noctua), the Egyptian eagle-owl (Bubo ascalaphus), the great owl of some authors, called ibis in the D.V., the screech or hooting owl, probably the lîlîth (לִיִלית) of Isaiah 34, and the lamia of St. Jerome and the D.V.; the barn owl (Strix flammea), possibly corresponding to the תַּחְמָס (taḥmās) of the Hebrew and rendered by night-hawk in the A.V.; and the qîppôz (קִפוֹז) of , as yet unidentified and sometimes translated \\"arrow snake\\" or \\"tree snake.\\" *Ox — See . *Ox, wild, Is., hi, 20, probably Antilope bubalis. See . P *Palmerworm (Hebr., gãzãm) A general word for the locust, very likely in its larva state. *Partridge — Although very common in the Holy Land, the partridge is mentioned only three times in the Bible: I K., xxvi, 20 alludes to chasing it on the mountains; , to the robbing of its eggs; Ecclus., xi, 32, to the keeping a decoy partridge. Two kinds of partridges are known to abide in the hilly resorts of Israel; the francolin inhabits the plains, and various sandgrouse are found in the deserts. *Peacock — The texts where it is spoken of (1 Kings ; 2 Chronicles ) clearly indicate that it was not indigenous to Israel, but imported, probably from India. *Pelican, D.V., (Vulgate: Psalm 101), for Hebr. qã'áth, in other places is rendered by bittern, for which it might be advantageously substituted. Pelicans are usually found about marshes (Isaiah ), and are in the habit of sitting for hours in sandy desolate places (Vulgate: Psalm 101); Soph., ii, 14] after they have gorged. *Phœnix or chol might possibly be read instead of palmtree (Hebr. hôl) in Job , where the belief in its immortality seems referred to; however the sense adopted by D.V., after Vulgate and Septuagint, should not be slighted.See F. Lecocq, \\"Y a-t-il un phénix dans la Bible ?\\", Kentron 30, 2014, p. 55-82. *Pigeon — See . *Plunger — See . *Porcupine — Believed by some, on account of a certain analogy of the Hebrew qîppõd with the Arabic name of this animal, to be spoken of in the Bible. See . *Porphyrion is in Vulgate and D.V. (Leviticus 11:18), the equivalent for the Hebrew, rãhãm, translated in the Septuagint as \\"swan\\"; in the Greek version, porphyrion stands for the Hebrew, tínshéméth, interpreted as \\"swan\\" in the Latin and English Bibles. The hypothesis that the Greek translators used a Hebrew text in which the two words rãhãm and tínshéméth stood contrariwise to their present order in the Massoretic text, might account for this difference. This hypothesis is all the more probable because in , porphyrion seems to be the Greek translation for rãhãm. Whatever this may be, whether the porphyrion, or purple swamphen (Porphyrio porphyrio), or the Egyptian vulture, should be identified with the rãhãm remains uncertain. See . *Pygarg (Deuteronomy ) — This word, a mere adaptation from the Greek, means \\"white-rumped\\", a character common to many species, though the antilope addax is possibly signified by the Hebrew word dîshõn. Q *Quail (שְׂלָו śəlāw)— The description given ; ; (Vulgate: Psalm 77), and (Vulgate: Psalm 104), the references to their countless flocks, their low flying, their habit of alighting on land in the morning, together with the analogy of the Hebrew and Arabic names, make it certain that the common quail (Coturnix vulgaris) is intended. R *Rabbit (Proverbs ) — A coney. See . *Ram — See . *Raven — The Bible includes under this generic name a certain number of birds having more or less resemblance with the raven, such as the magpie, the jay, the jackdaw, the starling, etc. The raven, eight species of which are found in Israel, is by far the most common of all the birds of that country, where it is with buzzards, vultures, dogs, jackals, and hyenas, an active scavenger. Its plumage is glossy black, and its habits are frequently alluded to in Bible, for instance feeding on carcasses, wandering for its precarious meals, picking out the eyes of the newly dropped or weakly animals, resorting to desolate places, etc. The raven, when no other food is nigh, not infrequently picks out grains freshly sown; hence its surname of seed-picker, spermologos, which, later on became a synonym for ragamuffin. This name, applied to St. Paul by his sceptical listeners of Athens, has become, through a mistranslation, \\"word-sower\\" in our Bibles (Acts ). *Night raven, the equivalent in Psalm 102 (Vulgate: Psalm 101) verse 7, of the Hebrew word translated in , as screech owl, seems to mean the blue thrush (petrocynela cyanea), a well-known solitary bird of the country, which is fond of sitting alone on a roof or a rock. *Rhinoceros, , stands for Hebrew, re'em, and should consequently be rendered by aurochs. *Ringtail — So D.V., , translates rã'ah, possibly substituted by a scribe's error for dã'ah, and very likely meaning the black kite (milvus migrans). *Rooster, See . – alektór Online Parallel Bible Project – alektór: a rooster S *Satyr — So is the Hebrew sã'îr rendered , and , by R.V. (D.V.: \\"hairy one\\"). The same word in , and , is translated \\"devils\\" in all English Bibles. Sã'îr usually signifies the he- goat. In the latter passages this sense is clearly inapplicable; it seems hardly applicable in the former. The writers of Leviticus, and 2 Paralipomenon possibly intended some representation of the same description as the goat- headed figures of the Egyptian Pantheon. Concerning the sã'îr mentioned in Isaias, no satisfactory explanation has as yet been given. *Scarlet — See . *Scorpion — Very common in all hot, dry, stony places; is taken as an emblem of the wicked. *Sea gull — Its different kinds are probably signified by the word translated larus. See . *Seal — See . *Sea monster, , probably means such animals as the whale, porpoise, dugong, etc. *Serpent — A generic term whereby all ophidia are designated; ten names of different species of snakes are given in the Bible. *Shrew — So does D.V. translate the Hebr. 'anãqah, which however means rather some kind of lizard, probably the gecko. *Siren, , a translation for Hebrew tán, which, indicates an animal dwelling in ruins, and may generally be rendered by jackal. No other resemblance than a verbal one should be sought between this tán and the fabulous being, famous by its allurements, called Siren by the ancient poets. *Snail should be read instead of wax in (Vulgate: Psalm 57), to translate the Hebrew shábelûl. Unlike the snails of northern climates which hibernate, those of Israel sleep in summer. The Psalmist alludes \\"to the fact that very commonly, when they have secured themselves in some chink of the rocks for their summer sleep, they are still exposed to the sun rays, which gradually evaporate and dry up the whole of the body, till the animal is shrivelled to a thread, and, as it were, melted away\\" (Tristram). *Sparrow — The Hebrew word çíppôr, found over 40 times, is a general name for all small passerine birds, of which there exist about 150 species in the Holy Land. *Species — There is no recognition of classification by, or distinction according to, species in the Bible. *Spider — An arachnid living by millions in Israel, where several hundred species have been distinguished. Its web affords a most popular illustration for frail and ephemeral undertakings (Job ; Isaiah ); in three passages, however, the translators seem to have wrongly written spider for moth ( (Vulgate: Psalm 38)), sigh ( (Vulgate: Psalm 89), and pieces (Hosea ). *Stork — The Hebrew word hasîdhah, erroneously rendered \\"heron\\" by the Douay translators, Lev. 11:19, alludes to the well-known affection of the stork for its young. Several passages have reference to this bird, its periodical migrations (Jeremiah ), its nesting in fir-trees, its black pinions stretching from its white body (Zechariah ; D.V., kite; but the stork, hasîdhah, is mentioned in the Hebrew text). Two kinds, the white and the black stork, live in Israel during the winter. *Swallow — Two words are so rendered: derôr, \\"the swift flyer\\", which means the chimney swallow and other species akin to it (Vulgate: Psalm 83); D.V., turtle; ; D.V., sparrow], whereas sûs or sîs may be translated as \\"swift\\", this bird being probably intended in , and . *Swan — Mentioned only in the list of unclean birds (Leviticus 11:18; Deuteronomy ). The swan having always been very rare in Syria, there was little need of forbidding to eat its flesh; by the Hebrew tínshéméth, some other bird might possibly be designated. *Swine — The most abhorred of all animals among the Jews; hence the swineherd's was the most degrading employment (Luke ; cf. Matthew ). Swine are very seldom kept in Israel. T *tachash (תַּחַשׁ tāḥaš), mentioned in the Bible, its hide was used as the top-most covering of the tabernacle. *Tiger, Job (Hebr., לַיִשׁ láyísh), should be \\"lion\\". *Turtle — See . U *Urchin, Soph., ii, 14. See . V *Viper — See . *Vulture — So does D.V. render the Hebrew, אַיָּה ‘áyyah, ; ; Job, . As has been suggested above, the text of Job at least, seems to allude to the kite rather than to the vulture. Several kinds of vultures are nevertheless referred to in the Bible; so, for instance, the bearded vulture (Gypœtus barbatus), called griffon in the D.V.; the griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus), the Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), etc. In the biblical parlance vultures are often termed eagles. W *Waterhen — See . *Weasel, , must be regarded as a general name, probably designating, besides the weasel proper, the polecat and ichneumon, all very common in the Holy Land. *Whale — \\"And God created great whales...\\" ( A.V.Genesis 1:21 (multiple versions) The first created and largest of all creatures, the whales are notable as the only kind of creatures other than mankind expressly mentioned in the creation account.) Hebrew Tânnîn can also be translated as \\"sea-monster\\"; porpoises and dugongs were also known to the Hebrews. In , Jesus compared his own burial to Jonah's entombment in the forestomach of a whale. * Wild dogs, *Wolf — Frequently mentioned in the Scriptures as a special foe to flocks (; Matthew 7:15), and an emblem of treachery, ferocity, and bloodthirstiness. Wolves usually prowl at night around the sheepfolds, and, though fewer in numbers than jackals, are much more harmful. The tribe of Benjamin, owing to its warlike character, was compared to a wolf. *Worm — In English the translation for two Hebrew words: rímmah (; ; Job , A.V.); and tólá' (Exodus , etc.); these two Hebrew words are general; the former designates particularly all living organisms generated and swarming in decaying or rotten substances; the latter includes not only worms, but also such insects as caterpillars, centipedes, etc. See also *Animals in the Bible References * !

Early life Isabel of York, the only daughter of Richard of Conisburgh, 3rd Earl of Cambridge, and Lady Anne de Mortimer, was born about 1409.. Through her father, she was the granddaughter of King Edward III's fourth surviving son, Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and his first wife, Isabella of Castile.

In the years 1927-1952 the company operated under the name Powszechny Zakład Ubezpieczeń Wzajemnych and between 1952-1990 it was known as Państwowy Zakład Ubezpieczeń (State Insurance Company) as it was officially given a monopoly by the state and effectively became the largest insurance company in the country. In 1991 PZU was turned into a joint stock company controlled by the state Treasury as a consequence of the political transformation after 1989. In December 1991, the PZU Życie joint stock company was founded by polski Bank Rozwoju and Bank Handlowy in Warsaw. The PZU transferred its portfolio of life insurance contracts for PZU Życie. In 1998, in relation with the reform of the pension insurance system in Poland, PZU Życie formed PTE PZU, a joint stock company, which operates the OFE PZU (Open Pension Fund). On November 5, 1999, a share purchase agreement was concluded under which Eureko and BIG Bank Gdański SA acquired 20% and 10% respectively of the share capital of PZU. A dispute arose in connection with the implementation of the agreement, which was settled amicably in October 2009. A settlement and sale agreement were concluded between the parties. = Over the years = In 2002, the PZU Group started its activities on the Lithuanian insurance market by acquiring shares in UAB DK “Lindra” (PZU Lietuva).

Also in 2015 PZU acquired the direct insurer LINK4 in Poland and launched the PZU Zdrowie brand. In 2015, the transaction to acquire a 25.19% stake in the share capital of Alior Bank SA was completed. The next step was the transaction carried out by Alior Bank to acquire a separate part of Bank BPH, including the core business. Today the PZU SA Group holds 31.94% of shares of the Alior Bank. In December 2016, PZU together with Polish Development Fund acquired Bank Pekao - Poland's second largest bank previously owned by Italian bank UniCredit by buying a 32.8 per cent stake in the bank for the amount of PLN 10.6 billion (EUR 2.6 billion).

She was born in , on the outskirts of Dresden, Saxony. Youth In 1906 Beese decided to pursue a career as a sculptor; however, she had to leave her native Germany to study, as German art schools did not admit female students. She studied instead at Stockholm’s Royal Academy from 1906 until 1909. During this period, she learned to sail and developed an affinity for skiing. When she returned to Dresden in 1909 and she began studying mathematics, shipbuilding, and aeronautic engineering. It was during this period where she developed a desire to become a pilot. Interest in aviation Melli Beese in front of the Poulain monoplane by Charles Boutard in December 1911 In November 1910 she traveled to Johannisthal, the first airfield to open in Berlin. Here she encountered early aviators from a variety of nations, and began to search for an instructor. In December of that year, Robert Thelens agreed to help her, but shortly afterwards he quit after Beese crashed a plane and sustained multiple injuries including broken ribs, nose and leg bones. In 1911, regulations pertaining to the flight test were made more stringent, and Beese, an inexperienced flier, found it increasingly difficult to persuade more experienced aviators to teach her. Nevertheless, in May of that year she found a new instructor named Von Mossner, who allowed her to take complete control of an airplane for the first time. Beese, encouraged by this, sought to gain more flying time, and spoke with the director of Johannisthal to this end. The director, Major Von Tschudi, anticipated a stir in publicity if he allowed a female aviator to participate in the upcoming flight display, and so at the end of July 1911 Beese was allowed to fly unaided. She encountered several setbacks, including sabotage of her aircraft by other participating aviators. However, she did participate in the flight display, becoming the first female pilot in Germany on 13 September 1911. Marriage and World War I 1912 was an eventful year for Beese. Following her father's death in January, Beese opened a flying school at Johannisthal airfield, with financial assistance from her mother. That same year she used her early training in architecture to design and patent a collapsible aircraft. She worked with one of her early pupils from her flying school, Charles Boutard, on plans for a flying boat. Her relationship with Boutard became close, and the two married in 1913. After marrying Boutard, Beese became a French citizen, thus making her ineligible to work on German airfields during the war. She was eventually arrested with her husband and tried as \\"undesirable aliens\\". Charles Boutard was interned and they moved to Wittstock for the duration of the war. After the armistice between Germany and the allies was concluded, the Boutards filed suit on claims of compensation for goods confiscated upon Charles' internment. The lawsuits continued for most of the rest of her life, although the value of the claimed compensation decreased with the hyper-inflation that Germany suffered during the Weimar period. Despite the troubles suffered due to the ongoing lawsuits and the economic troubles suffered throughout Germany, Melli planned to make a film documenting her flying. Some pieces were shot and still survive, and were included in a film made by Walter Jerven in 1940. Death and legacy Commemorative plaque at the birthplace of Melli Beese in Dresden-Laubegast. The inscription reads \\"Birthplace of the first German female airplane pilot.\\" Beese's marriage deteriorated. By 1925, the couple had separated and Beese was living alone in Schmargendorf. Beese had an unfortunate accident the same year, crashing the airplane she was flying when she reapplied for her pilot's license. On 22 December of that year, she shot herself in her Berlin flat. She is buried in the cemetery at Berlin-Schmargendorf. There is a small memorial park named after her in Wilmersdorf, at the corner of Storckwinkel- and Schwarzbacherstraße. In 1992, Straße 19 in Treptow was renamed Melli-Beese- Straße. Also, there is an exhibition dedicated to her in the Heimatmuseum in Treptow, in the eastern suburbs of Berlin. Johannisthal airfield, where Beese began her career as an aviator, has disappeared beneath the changing landscape of Berlin; there is no trace of it other than local street names such as Pilotenstraße and Segelfliegerstraße.

Born exclusively as a launching platform for young Italian rock groups, in its current form, the festival lasts six days and is totally free of charge. In recent years, the festival has multiplied the number of its venues in the city and accommodated an ever-increasing number of extra-musical cultural activities.  History  The first edition of Arezzo Wave took place in 1987, entitled \\"Provincia insonne,\\" featured sixteen emerging groups from all of Italy (without any recording contract) on four nights. The concerts took place in the Fortezza Medicea di Arezzo. In subsequent years, the festival has put faith in its \\"launching\\" work, also starting in parallel to call already-famous emerging groups onto the European scene. In 1991, the Mano Negra and the Leningrad Cowboys arrived, and the \\"discoveries\\" Afterhours and Almamegretta came. Pablo Echaurren began designing the festival's sets, which have grown thanks to the generosity and financial support of various institutes, including the French Minister of Culture Jack Lang. In the years hence, the Arezzo Wave became a privileged venue for new Italian groups of the nineties: Mau Mau, Frankie Hi-NRG MC, Ritmo tribale ... The venue has relocated twice and the number of participants has grown to a point where it has definitely come to be accepted on the public stage. In the afternoon, another venue (the \\"Psycho Stage\\") began near the city center. Along with artists of such caliber as David Byrne, Nick Cave, Sonic Youth, Moby, Tricky, Ben Harper, the festival has continued to accommodate emerging Italian bands on the Psycho Stage, and has divided the nights between Italian ethnic music, techno, and hard rock. All the major Italian rock artists have passed through the Arezzo Wave: Max Gazzè, Daniele Silvestri, Jovanotti, CSI, Tiromancino, Bandabardò, Negrita, Marlene Kuntz, Morgan, Samuele Bersani, Carmen Consoli, Subsonica, ... In 2006, the 20th edition took place from 11 to 16 July. In the last two editions, the festival has offered, beyond the principal venue on stage, an afternoon venue (the \\"Psycho Stage\\") and an early-bird (the \\"Wake-up Stage\\"), cabaret contests, cinema events, and comic strips, theater, concerts of classical music in central public squares of the city. Like every year, the final program will be published on official site around the month of June 2006. For various reasons, mainly due to lack of funding from the Arezzo province, in 2007 the Arezzo Wave festival relocated to Sesto Fiorentino, a large area outside Florence, and renamed itself to Italia Wave Love Festival 2007. Despite its new name and location, this is effectively the 21st edition of Arezzo Wave. References *Giancarlo Susanna. \\"Arezzo Wave\\". Gino Castaldo (edited by). Dizionario della canzone italiana.

A prop, he was renowned for his scrummaging ability. De Villiers made his debut for France in 1999, on 28 August in a test match against Wales in Cardiff, just prior to the start of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales. Despite only having the one international cap, De Villers was included in France's World Cup squad. He came on as a replacement in the quarterfinal win over Argentina. He also played in the subsequent famous semi-final victory over the All Blacks. France made it through to the final, where they met the Wallabies. Australia won 35–12. De Villiers was selected in France's 2000 Six Nations Championship squad, and played in all of France's five matches during the tournament. He also earned another two international caps in November of that year, and was in the starting lineup in the second of two tests against the All Blacks. He cemented his position in the starting lineup, where he played all of the 2001 Six Nations Championship games as well as the June and November test matches. He played for France seven times during 2002. The following season, de Villiers won the Top 14 championship with Stade Français, defeating Stade Toulousain 32–18 in the final. In 2003 he was given a short ban for recreational drug use after traces of cocaine and ecstasy were found in a drugs test – the player denied knowingly taking drugs but was banned for bringing the game into disrepute. De Villiers played two tests against Argentina and one against the All Blacks in June 2003, but did not play at the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. Stade Français again made it to the final of the French championship, where they defeated USA Perpignan 38–20, to take the championship. He returned to French squad in time for the 2004 Six Nations Championship, as well as playing another three test matches later in the year. He earned 10 international caps for France in 2005, as well as that, Stade Français were finalists at the 2004–05 Heineken Cup and French championship, though they lost both. The following season, he won the 2006 Six Nations Championship with France. At the club level, he has had a very successful career, playing on teams that won the Bouclier de Brennus as French champions in 1998, 2000, 2003, 2004, and 2007. In December 2007, de Villiers suffered a neck injury that sidelined him for a large part of the 2007–08 season. Even after recovering, he had difficulty breaking into the Stade Français squad. On 18 April 2008, he announced his retirement from all rugby, effective at the end of the 2007–08 season. De Villiers was scrum coach for the South African National Rugby team and was regarded as a trusted aid of previous coach Heyneke Meyer. In December 2019, De Villiers has been hired as scrum assistant coach for Scotland.

The group was composed of seven states led by radical, left-wing leaders — Algeria, Egypt, Ghana, Tanzania, Guinea, Libya, Mali, and Morocco. The conflict and eventual compromise between the Casablanca Group and the Monrovia Group led to the establishment of the Organisation of African Unity. History African Unity Square (Place de l'Unité Africaine) in Casablanca The group first met in 1961 in the Moroccan port city of Casablanca, hence the alliance's name. This conference brought together some of the continent's most prominent statesmen like Gamal Abdel-Nasser of Egypt, Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana and Sékou Touré of Guinea. What united them was a belief in the need for African political unification or federation. They believed that only significant, deep integration, as has since occurred in Europe through the European Union, would enable Africa to defeat colonialism, achieve peace, foster cultural dialogue, increase the continent's geopolitical influence and promote economic development.Pierre Englebert & Kevin C. Dunn (2013), Inside African Politics, London: Lynne Pienner, p. 320–321 In other words, they believed in the transfer of many powers from national governments to a supranational, pan- African authority. Nkrumah even argued for the establishment of a pan-African army which could be deployed to fight colonialism or white minority rule across the continent. His famous Pan-Africanist slogan was 'Africa Must Unite!'Kwame Nkrumah (1963), Africa Must Unite, London: Heinemann However, the Casablanca Group was ultimately unsuccessful. Most other African leaders did not support such radical change. The ideas of its rival, the so-called Monrovia Group—which also believed in Pan-Africanism but not at the expense of nationalism and independent statehood—prevailed. In 1963, the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) was established. All the members of both the Casablanca and Monrovia groups joined, putting their differences to one side. The OAU, now the African Union, has only achieved limited integration and unity of its member states. It is a reflection of the values of the Monrovia Group and a repudiation of the ideas of the Casablanca Group. As well as disagreeing on the nature of African unity, the groups also took up conflicting positions on the then conflicts in Algeria and Congo. While the Casablanca Group's members pledged to support the Front de Liberation Nationale in its efforts fighting for Algerian independence from France, the Monrovia Group backed their enemies, the French.Pierre Englebert & Kevin C.

This species is likely to have other features similar to other Uperoleia species such as: red-orange patches in the groin and behind the knees, tubercles and large parotoid glands as well as a granular belly.

The frog is likely to breed in permanent and semi-permanent still water bodies in the Kimberly region. This species was once thought to be widespread across eastern New South Wales, but due to the similarity of frogs within the genus Uperoleia it was most likely confused with smooth toadlet.

Description Wet-season brood. Male upperside: azure blue deepening in tint towards the apex of the forewing. Forewing: a narrow black terminal edging widened towards the apex; cilia brownish black. Hindwing: costal margin broadly, dorsal margin more narrowly paler than the ground colour; a subterminal series of black spots edged outwardly with white, the spot in interspace 2 the largest, oval or round, the others smaller, transversely sublinear; a clearly defined anteciliary black line; cilia brown with a white line along their bases, often restricted to the posterior half of the wing. Underside: greyish brown. Forewings and hindwings: two subterminal and a terminal white transverse line succeeded by an anteciliary black line on each wing, the ground colour enclosed between these lines of a slightly darker shade with the appearance of somewhat maculate (spotted) transverse bands. On the hindwing near apices of interspaces 1 a, 1 and 2 enclosed between the inner of the two subterminal white lines and the terminal white line are a large round black spot inwardly edged with ochraceous in interspace 2, two minute black geminate (paired) spots in interspace 1 and a similar single spot in interspace 1 a, the latter three spots superposed on a white ground and above the white a narrow transverse short ochraceous line. Forewing: in addition four obliquely placed, transverse, white parallel fasti as follows: two, one on either side of the discocellulars extended between the subcostal vein and the dorsum; two upper discal lines broken and sinuate, extended from just below the costa, the inner lino to vein 3, the outer line to vein 1. Hindwing: crossed by five transverse parallel white fasciae besides the terminal markings already mentioned, these are all more or less interrupted and broken anteriorly and the inner four abruptly curved upwards posteriorly. Antennas, head, thorax and abdomen dark brown, the shafts of the antennas ringed with white, the thorax and abdomen at base with a little blue pubescence; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. Female upperside: pale blue with a slight purple tinge. Forewing: costa increasingly to the apex, termen decreasingly to the tornus heavily edged with black; at the apex of the wing the black occupies about one-fourth of the wing. Hindwing: markings as in the male but the subterminal line of black spots much more clearly defined; the spots larger, edged prominently on both inner and outer sides with white, which on the inner side is margined by a lunular heavy transverse black line. Underside: precisely as in the male. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen similar to those of the male. Dry-season brood. Similar to the males and females of the wet-season brood but differ as follows: male upperside: pale purplish blue fading on the discs of the wings in some specimens to white; terminal black edging to the forewing narrower; markings on the hindwing fainter, trending towards obsolescence. Underside: from very pale ochraceous white to dark earthy ochraceous; markings identical with those in specimens of the wet-season brood, but in some of the very pale specimens the white fasciae assume a pale greenish-blue metallic tint. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the wet-season specimens but paler. Female differs from the wet-season specimens only in the paler ground colour both on the upper and undersides, on the former also by the narrowness of the black edging to the forewing, and the subobsolescence of the markings on the hindwing.

As suggested by its name, this is one of the relatively few morphos that is white rather than blue. Some authorities include M. luna, which is also white, as a subspecies of M. polyphemus.  Identification  Both the upper and lower wings are bright white, with some small light brown markings. There is a row of small eyespots on the underside of the hindwings.  Host plant  The caterpillar has been known to eat Paullinia pinnata (family Sapindaceae) and Inga (family Fabaceae). Etymology The species epithet is derived from Polyphemus, a character in Greek mythology, from the small eyespots on the wing. Polyphemus was the one-eyed son of Poseidon and Thoosa. Butterfly World in the United Kingdom Public Domain photo of Morpho polyphemus butterfly. Description Account by Hans Fruhstorfer in Die Gross-Schmetterlinge der Erde:Fruhstorfer, H. 1913. Family: Morphidae. In A. Seitz (editor), Macrolepidoptera of the World, vol. 5: 333–356. Stuttgart: Alfred Kernen. \\"M. polyphemus Db. & Hew. (68c) differs from its Brazilian relatives in the chalky white upper surface of both wings with delicate mother-of-pearl gloss, and also in the projecting apex of the forewing and the sharp teeth of the hindwing. On the upper surface the black distal bordering is absent and the discocellular shows only a quite narrow stripe. The ocelli [eyespots] of the forewing are larger than in catenarius, those of the wing more distinctly white-centred. As luna Butler has described an aberration from Mexico with the black spots on both wings unusually well developed. The flight of polyphemus is extremely rapid and irregular, and according to Godman and Salvin the species ascends in Guatemala to 4000 ft. [1200 m] and is often met with near the ground in villages or also high up round the tops of trees in the timber- forest. Distributed from Mexico to Guatemala and Nicaragua, occasionally also occurring in Panama.\\" References *Smart, Paul (1976). The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Butterfly World in Color.

David Todros has just been married to Lia, the daughter of Walter and Evelyn Emerson, and the happy couple will be joining the expedition after their honeymoon. The family's happiness is dimmed, however, by allegations that David has been making and selling fake antiquities under the guise of his late grandfather Abdullah's legacy. Ramses and Nefret take on the task of ferreting out the source of the rumors - and the fakes - with fears that the Master Criminal is behind it. Meanwhile, Percy Peabody, Amelia's evil nephew, turns up as a member of the Egyptian Army and an intermittent pest. He has written a lurid (and completely false) memoir about his time in Egypt, keeps proposing to Nefret, and seems up to something, though he doesn't have the brains to be part of the plot the Emersons are investigating. Two young Americans join the Emersons' dig, Geoffrey Godwin and Jack Reynolds, whose sister sets her sights on Ramses. Ramses is also investigating the illegal drug trade.

Geography Shottesbrooke is a parish between Waltham St Lawrence on the west and White Waltham on the east. They were originally one place, Waltham, which was divided in the Saxon era. Today, as always, it is mostly farmland with some large areas of woodland in between, particularly the Great Wood. The hamlet of Cold Harbour is in the very north of the parish, with Shottesbrooke itself in the central area, between Shottesbrooke Park and Smewins' Farm, where the B3024 runs through the region. The M4 motorway crosses the south-east corner of the parish. History The Roman 'Camlet Way' between St Albans and Silchester would have crossed the parish at some point and the name 'Cold Harbour' indicates there was an inn or other stopping place nearby. In Saxon times, the manor was owned by the Royal goldsmiths and 'Alward the Goldsmith' was one of the few Saxons allowed to keep his manor here after the Norman Conquest. It is said that charcoal from the Great Wood which occupies most of the southern third of Shottesbrooke was used to melt the gold to make the Saxon Royal regalia. Shottesbrooke was created a parish, endowed with its own church and priest mainly because of national wealth and later accomplishments of successive owners of Shottesbrooke Park. It was the home of Sir William Trussell, a prominent Royal diplomat in the mid-14th century. He built the Decorated Period parish church as an ecclesiastical college in 1337. The church is renowned for its fine memorial brasses and Trussell's beautifully carved double-recessed monument. Towards the end of the reign of Edward III the church and college were almost destroyed by fire, but from the design of the existing church the damage done must have been almost entirely confined to the secular buildings. The building is remarkable both for its beauty and symmetry of design and its present good state of preservation. It is recorded that on Wednesday, 20 July 1757, a violent thunderstorm passed over Shottesbrook (a variant spelling until the 1930s), and the church was so damaged by the lightning that it had to be shut up for more than a year, during which time the parishioners attended White Waltham. It re-opened on Sunday, 24 September 1758, after repairs. The chief damage appears to have been done to the spire, which was so shaken that it was at first thought that it would have to be taken down. A gallery across the north transept (evidently an 18th-century addition, removed in 1854) was also damaged and so too the north porch. The falling stones from the spire slightly damaged the roof setting a few rafters on fire. In 1852–4 the church was thoroughly restored under the supervision of G. E. Street, R. A. Between 1870 and 1872 the village real property of £2,134 () had 148 residents spread over 23 homes, fewer than 50% of the current number.Extract from Vision of Britain, University of Portsmouth John Marius Wilson.

He was followed by Francis Cherry, the non-juror (unwilling to override his oath of recognition of the legal right to reign of the deposed Catholic monarch, James II of England) and guardian of Thomas Hearne and patron of Francis Brokesby. His friend, Henry Dodwell, the theologian, lived at Smewins. Later, Governor Henry Vansittart was in residence and his brother, Professor Robert Vansittart also grew up there.

It was purchased in 1854 after Catherine's second husband Prince Achille Murat (son of Joachim Murat, Napoleon's brother-in-law and King of Naples from 1808-1815) died in 1847. Murat was the great-grandniece of George Washington. She was a daughter of Colonel Byrd C. Willis (August 29, 1781 – 1846) and his wife Mary Lewis. Mary Lewis was the granddaughter of Fielding Lewis, George Washington's brother-in- law. Through the Lewis family, she was also a relative of explorer Meriwether Lewis. Plantation home The home was named after the Hotel de Belle-Vue in Brussels, where Catherine and Achille had lived while in Europe. It has been restored and has period furnishings. The house is now part of the grounds of the Tallahassee Museum and is located in the Old Florida section. Visitors can learn about the area's plantation communities. There are two adjacent reconstructed building, a plantation kitchen and a slave cabin. Plantation specifics The Leon County Florida 1860 Agricultural Census shows that Bellevue Plantation had the following: * Improved Land: * Unimproved Land: * Cash value of plantation: $10,000 * Cash value of farm implements/machinery: $200 * Cash value of farm animals: $510 * Number of slaves: 24 * Bushels of corn: N/A * Bales of cotton: N/A The owners During Catherine's years at Bellevue, she became involved in America's first successful preservation effort of Mount Vernon, George Washington's home, through the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association. She was appointed Vice Regent for Florida, the title given the central person in each state organizing the association's work. The state raised $3,791 toward the restoration of Mount Vernon, the largest per capita amount raised by any of the 30 contributing states. During the Civil War, Murat participated in the local \\"Soldiers Aid Societies,\\" which met as sewing circles to clothe the southern troops. Early in 1866, Napoleon III, who had come to power in France in 1849, granted Murat an annuity from the French government in consideration of her losses during the Civil War. Catherine Murat died August 6, 1867 at Bellevue. Bellevue was sold to Captain Bloxham who owned the William D. Bloxham Plantation. In June 1883, Bellevue, now at of land, was sold to E. L. Thompson of Wisconsin.

Formerly known as the Aberconwy Centre and the North Wales Theatre and Conference Centre, it is now a large arts, conference and events venue. Venue Cymru has a theatre, conference centre, and arena.  Victoria Palace  The site lies at the edge of Ty'n-y-ffrith, the 'house in the sheep pasture'. The first theatre at the site was the Victoria Palace, which opened in July 1894. It was intended to be a temporary building, and it was designed as a 1,150-seat concert hall for Jules Rivière (then aged 75) and his 42-musician orchestra. Rivière had previously performed at the Pier Pavilion before he fell out with the Llandudno Pier Company. Victoria Palace attracted eminent visiting soloists including Sir Charles and Lady Hallé who in 1894 gave a piano and violin recital with Rivière's orchestra. The Victoria Palace was the first part of a project that would have later seen the construction of a pier. The theatre was later renamed to Rivière's Concert Hall.  Llandudno Opera House  In 1900 it was renamed to the Llandudno Opera House. It hosted the Carl Rosa Opera Company.  Hippodrome  It was renamed to the Hippodrome, and was used as a roller-skating rink, a dance hall and for summer shows.  Arcadia  The theatre was purchased by Will Catlin on 3 June 1916. It was renamed as the Arcadia. The theatre had 1,147 seats, and was one of six theatres in Llandudno to last for many years. It was the home of Catlin's Peirrots and Catlin's Showtime. Ken Dodd was a regular performer. The Arcadia provided 1,147 seats in the auditorium and was the last of Llandudno's many theatres and cinemas to offer traditional seaside entertainments. It was the home of Will Catlin's Pierrots, which eventually became presented as \\"Catlin's Follies with an all star cast\\". Catlin's Follies survived the sudden death in 1953 (aged 82) of Will Catlin. The shows continued until 1968, when Llandudno Urban Council purchased the theatre. The Arcadia continued as a summer theatre under local authority ownership until 1993. It closed on 22 June 1994, and was derelict for the next decade, before being demolished in July 2005.  Aberconwy Centre  The Aberconwy Centre opened to the west of the Arcadia theatre in 1982. The conference venue had space for over 1,000 conference attendees. It also featured squash courts, sun beds and badminton courts. The centre was redeveloped in 1994, and it was renamed to the North Wales Theatre and Conference Centre. It hosted a 1,500-seat auditorium/theatre, as well as a conference hall with capacity for 800 seated, or 1,000 standing, people.  Venue Cymru  In July 2005 the Arcadia theatre was demolished to make way for an atrium and meeting and conference rooms adjoining the North Wales Theatre and Conference Centre. The building was also extended to the west. After the redevelopment, the venue hosted a new arena, capable of hosting 1,800 seated, or 2,500 standing people, increasing the overall capacity of the venue to over 5,000 people. The western extension incorporated a café, restaurant and a box office, as well as office space. The redevelopment cost £10.7 million, which was provided by Conwy County Borough Council, the European Union's Objective One Fund program, the Arts Council of Wales, Visit Wales and the Welsh Development Agency. A competition to rename the building was launched in December 2005. Several months later, the name of Venue Cymru was chosen. It was re-opened on 15 January 2007 by Andrew Davies. On 27 August 2010, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for Where We Are Tour supporting their album Where We Are and in 2016, a solo concert by the lead vocalist Shane Filan.

Biography He studied both guitar and cello in Darmstadt and Cologne. His concert career began in 1978 and brought him to about 40 countries all over the world. Invitations to international music festivals in Europe and overseas, as well as to the Royal Academy of Music (London), the Manhattan School of Music (New York) and the University of Southern California (Los Angeles), have been further highlights of his multifaceted career. 2003 - 2005 he was invited to teach as a guest professor at the Music University in Piteå (Sweden). He has made several radio, television and commercial recordings, both solo and with other musicians including the pianist Alexis Weissenberg, tenor Christoph Prégardien, cellist Peter Wolf and the Rubio String Quartet. He also publishes music, including songs by Schubert, modern works written specially for him (Karl-Wieland Kurz's I giardini del sogno,Karl-Wieland Kurz: I giardini del sogno (info) for example), his own compositions and arrangements of music from the Baroque period. Besides his career as a recitalist, Hoppstock teaches international guitar classes at the Akademie für Tonkunst Darmstadt (Academy of Music at Darmstadt, Germany). In 2013 Tilman Hoppstock has received the ”Darmstadt Music Award 2013” for his livework as guitarist, teacher, musicologist and publisher. In 2014 he obtained one's doctorate with his dissertation about 'The Polyphony in Bach's Lute Fugues'.published in PRIM Musikverlag (PRIM 1750-PEE)  Reviews  * Hoppstock is an exceptional player, with a fine sense of style and unfailing sensitivity, and a technician of the first water; his tone is refined and beautifully nuanced, his delivery is clean and sure even in the passages where the utmost dexterity is called for, and his command of varied articulation is admirable Gramophone (2/1998)initials \\"JD\\" in the music magazine Grammophone (2/1998) about the CD \\"Classic Guitar\\" (SIGNUM X75-00) * A playful interchange of light and dark shades with endless worlds of sound full of passion and conscientiousness...Tilman Hoppstock belongs to those artists who make you forget the instrument. Alexis Weissenberg (Paris, 1992)Alexis Weissenberg in a letter to Tilman Hoppstock, which had been published in Booklet SIGNUM X41-00 * Tilman Hoppstock‘s perfect performance, his extreme sensibility and a broad range of timbres and nuances, but also this extraordinary articulation in his playing makes him to one of the greatest guitarists in our century. Les Cahiers de la Guitare (Paris, No. 66/1998)Danielle Ribouilault in music magazine \\"Les Cahiers de la guitare\\" No. 66/1998 * The work is quite an extraordinary achievement and emphasizes how Hoppstock’s evolution through the years of interpreting Bach is of itself a fascinating aspect of his musicianship which deserves close attention. The quality of these recordings is first-class throughout and superbly well re-mastered, so there is none of the jarring technological dislocation that often afflicts compilations of tracks from various years. This is a recording which should be on every self- respecting guitarist’s shelf, no doubt cheek-by-jowl with Hoppstock’s published books on Bach.

After service the Royal Air Force during World War II, Sandford turned away from a career in art and studied singing. He performed in musical theatre in the West End and on tour between 1950 and 1956, including 800 performances starring in a revue called Jokers Wild with The Crazy Gang. He also began a concert career. In 1957, he was engaged by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and immediately began to perform eight principal roles in repertory, including Pooh-Bah in The Mikado. He remained with the company for 25 years until it closed, also making about twenty recordings with the company, and several recordings for Readers' Digest and others. In later years, Sandford continued to tour in and direct Gilbert and Sullivan productions, often with his former D'Oyly Carte colleague Roberta Morrell. After The International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival was established in 1994, he often performed and lectured for the festival's audiences and held master classes for its performers. Beginnings Kenneth Sandford was born Kenneth Parkin in Godalming, Surrey and raised in Sheffield, where his father became landlord of a pub.The Daily Telegraph obituary, 11 October 2004 Sandford hoped to be an artist, studying painting at the College of Arts and Crafts in Sheffield, where he won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London.Stone, David. Kenneth Sandford at the Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company website, 21 September 2004, accessed 6 April 2009 After he returned from service in the Royal Air Force during World War II, he attended that college, but he took up singing and became intrigued by the theatre.Forbes, Elizabeth. Kenneth Sandford obituary, The Independent, 23 September 2004 He began to perform in musicals, concerts and oratorios and switched to opera school. At this time he adopted his mother's maiden name as his professional surname, believing that Parkin \\"hardly rang with theatrical overtones.\\"Morrell, p. 10 Sandford played roles in several shows in the West End and on tour between 1950 and 1956, including Carousel at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane (1950-51) (understudying and appearing as Billy Bigelow); on tour as Count Igor Staniev in King's Rhapsody; as Sandy Twist in Paint Your Wagon at His Majesty's Theatre (1953-54); in Kismet (understudying and going on for Alfred Drake) and 800 performances starring in a revue called Jokers Wild with The Crazy Gang at Victoria Palace Theatre (1954-56).Kenneth Sandford profile at the Memories of the D'Oyly Carte website In April 1955, he appeared in the Royal Variety Show supporting The Crazy Gang in a bill that featured Gracie Fields, George Formby and the young team of Morecambe and Wise.The Manchester Guardian, 10 March 1955, p. 5 He also sang in concert as a tenor during this period, including a Wigmore Hall recital in April 1951 in songs by composers as diverse as Wolf- Ferrari, Rachmaninoff and Medtner.Morrell, p. 12The Times, 9 April 1951, p. 6 In 1952, he married Pauline Joyce, and the couple had a son and a daughter.Kenneth Sandford obituary, The Times, 14 September 2004 D'Oyly Carte years Sandford joined the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in 1957, for the pay of £37 and 10 shillings a week (about £700 at 2007 values)Morrell, p. 25Measuringworth.com He immediately assumed eight principal baritone roles: the Sergeant of Police in The Pirates of Penzance, Archibald Grosvenor in Patience, Private Willis in Iolanthe, King Hildebrand in Princess Ida, Pooh- Bah in The Mikado, Sir Despard Murgatroyd in Ruddigore, Wilfred Shadbolt in The Yeomen of the Guard, and Don Alhambra del Bolero in The Gondoliers. He dropped the role of Sergeant of Police in 1962 (which he found uncomfortably low for his \\"creamy and slightly breathy\\" lyric baritone voice) and added Dr. Daly to his repertoire when The Sorcerer was revived in 1971. In 1962, he played Shadbolt in a grand production of Yeomen staged by Anthony Besch at the Tower of London as part of the first City of London Festival. The Times said, \\"Mr Kenneth Sandford's lean, melancholy, decidedly sympathetic Shadbolt steals the show.\\"The Times, 10 July 1962, p. 13 By this time, the copyrights on Gilbert and Sullivan had expired and, to Sandford's delight, Besch's production was completely restaged, allowing Sandford to develop a new interpretation of the role. For the National School of Opera in 1963, Sandford took part along with Janet Baker, Jennifer Vyvyan, Marie Collier and others, in a gala at Sadler's Wells Theatre. The Times praised his \\"distinguished singing\\" and added, \\"we hope this talented singing actor will not remain forever in Savoy opera.\\"The Times, 29 July 1963, p. 14 Sandford had been invited to join the company of the Glyndebourne Festival in 1961, but with a young family to support he felt he could not abandon the security offered by his D'Oyly Carte contract, and thereafter \\"it was never the right time or the right financial deal to lure him.\\"Morrell, p. 41 Sandford sometimes bridled at the D'Oyly Carte directorial \\"traditions\\". He was originally trained in his roles by Eleanor Evans (Mrs. Darrell Fancourt), then the company's stage director. Sandford later recalled, For the 1975 D'Oyly Carte centenary season, Sandford played all his principal baritone roles as well as King Paramount in the company's first revival of Utopia, Limited since the original production. Andrew Lamb, writing in The Musical Times, thought him \\"outstanding\\" in the role.The Musical Times, June 1976, pp. 496–97 Sandford sang Ludwig in a concert performance of The Grand Duke in the same season.The Savoyard, September 1975, pp. 9-12 In addition, during that season, Trial by Jury was preceded by an original short play, Dramatic Licence by William Douglas-Home, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Richard D'Oyly Carte plan the birth of Trial in 1875. Sandford played W. S. Gilbert in the playlet. He remained with the company for twenty-five years, ending on the company's last night, 27 February 1982. After the D'Oyly Carte After the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company closed, Sandford continued his association with Gilbert and Sullivan. He acted as managing director of a touring concert group, \\"The Magic of D'Oyly Carte\\" (later called \\"The magic of Gilbert & Sullivan\\")The group changed its name after the D'Oyly Carte Opera company revived in 1988 and along with his friend and former D'Oyly Carte colleague Roberta Morrell, he appeared in and co- directed several Savoy Operas at Gawsworth Hall, Cheshire. Sandford toured North America several times with Geoffrey Shovelton, John Ayldon, Lorraine Daniels and others in a series of Gilbert and Sullivan concerts entitled \\"The Best of Gilbert & Sullivan\\", and in other concerts and productions, including at the Berkshire Choral Institute with John Reed in The Gondoliers (1985).

A native of Indiana, he joined the army during the Mexican–American War and then prospected during the California Gold Rush. After moving to the Oregon Territory, he served as a judge and member of the legislature. A Democrat, Whiteaker served as the first state Governor of Oregon from 1859 until 1862 and later was Oregon's Congressman from 1879 to 1881. He also was president of the Oregon State Senate and Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives. Early life John Whiteaker was born in Dearborn County in the southeast corner of Indiana to farmers on May 4, 1820. His parents were John and Nancy (née Smales), and he had four siblings. Growing up he only received six months of formal schooling and as a result, was almost entirely self-educated. Before moving west, he had performed odd jobs, carpentry, and volunteered for military service during the Mexican War, although his unit was never called into battle.  Career  = Gold Rush = In 1849, he joined the California Gold Rush, earning enough to move his family to Oregon. After arriving in Oregon in 1852, he settled the family on a farm in the southern portion of the Willamette Valley in Lane County. There he became active in Democratic Party activities, and was elected to office first as judge of the Probate Court for Lane County in 1856. Whiteaker then was elected as a legislator in the Territorial Legislature in 1857 representing Lane County in the House of Representatives.Oregon Legislators and Staff Guide: 1857 Regular Session (9th Territorial). Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on February 18, 2009. =Governor of Oregon= Oregon was preparing for statehood in 1857, as voters had just approved a state constitution. Whiteaker was selected as a Democratic faction's nominee in the first state gubernatorial election, held in June 1858. Whiteaker won by a margin of 1,138, and was inaugurated July 8, 1858. He did not assume office until word that Congress had passed Oregon's statehood bill on February 14, 1859. Technically, Oregon had two governors in the interim, as Territorial Governor George Law Curry was legally in charge until the state government-in-waiting was legally empowered to take control. Once in office, the new governor set out to untangle the large amounts of land claims and counter claims on public lands. He also promoted economic policies favoring home industries, products that Oregonians could make self-sufficiently. Although nicknamed \\"Honest John\\", this did not deflect his controversial stands on issues of national importance. Whiteaker held pro-slavery views which did not sit well with a population mostly in the abolitionist camp. Opponents often used this to attack him as a traitor as the United States descended into the Civil War. Prior to 1864, individual states were responsible for picking their own date to celebrate Thanksgiving. In 1859 Governor Whiteaker proclaimed the fourth Thursday of December as the Thanksgiving holiday for Oregon.McCarthy, Linda.\\"Pioneers Had No Time for Thanksgiving\\". The Oregonian. South Zoner; Pg. 01. November 25, 1993. During his final year as governor in 1861, Republican U.S. Senator Edward Baker was killed in the Battle of Ball's Bluff and Whiteaker appointed Democratic Party stalwart Benjamin Stark to fill the remainder of Baker's term.Terry, John. \\"OREGON'S TRAILS A STARK TALE OF ASCENDANCY, BITTERNESS, THENGOODBYE\\". The Oregonian. NORTHWEST; OREGON & THE WEST; Pg. A19. October 12, 2003 Whiteaker was not nominated again by the Democrats in the 1862 election, and thus left office. He stayed in local politics, winning three terms as a state representative (1866–1870), and election to the state senate in 1876. During the 1868 session he served as Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives.Elections Process and History. Oregon Blue Book. Oregon Secretary of State. Retrieved on May 30, 2008.

The Democrats had been weakened in the House, and needed one vote to prevail in their nominee for Speaker of the House. The vote was needed by March 18, 1879. Whiteaker, already on his way to Washington, received word of this urgency while on a steamer between Portland and San Francisco. Upon docking in San Francisco on March 12, he was met by a railroad agent, and rushed to a special Central Pacific Railroad express train at Oakland. The regular transcontinental train was 25 hours out of Oakland, but Whiteaker's train managed to catch up with it. He arrived in Washington on the morning of March 18, in enough time to be promptly seated by Congress and cast his vote. The trip cost $1500 at the time, an expense widely criticized by the Democrat's political opposition and the media. Many referred to it as \\"Whiteaker's ride\\". In 1880, Whiteaker ran for re-election to Congress, but was defeated by Republican Melvin Clark George by 1,379 votes. Following his defeat, he retired to his farm near Eugene. =Later life= John Whiteaker was called back into politics one more time, in 1885 when President Grover Cleveland appointed him as Oregon's Collector of Revenues at the U.S. Customs House in Portland. He moved back to Eugene after 1890, purchasing 10 city blocks in the central city. The plat, Whiteaker's Addition, is commonly known as the Whiteaker neighborhood.  Personal life  On August 22, 1847, he married Nancy Jane Hargrave and they had six children. Whiteaker remained in Eugene, Oregon until his death on October 2, 1902. He is buried there in the Masonic Cemetery. Whiteaker Elementary School is named in his honor, as is Whiteaker, a neighborhood in downtown Eugene. References Further reading * Klooster, Karl.

History and description The building which now houses the Dancehouse Theatre, on Oxford Road, Manchester, was originally designed by Pendleton and Dickson for the property developer Emmanuel Nove, a Ukrainian who came to the city in the late 19th century. The building was built in 1929-30Hartwell, Clare (2001). Pevsner Architectural Guides: Manchester. London: Penguin Books. p. 318 originally containing two large meeting halls over a parade of shops. It is clad in cream faience with orange faience detailing. Nove's initials may be seen set on the central pediment. Before the interior of the halls was completed, they were converted into two cinemas (The Regal Twins) with fashionable 1930 Art Deco interiors, the world's first multiplex. These were converted, in 1972, to a five screen complex (Studios 1 to 5) by Star Group, as the first five-cinema complex in Britain.Manchester Evening News; 26 January 1972 before closing in the 1980s. Star Group also established Studios 6-9 in Deansgate.Manchester Evening News; 26 January 1972 Dancehouse interior A lease for the derelict property was obtained in 1990 by the Northern Ballet School which, together with its sister company The Dancehouse Theatre, set about restoring the building to its former Art Deco splendour. One previously derelict 750-seat cinema was converted to create the Dancehouse Theatre, officially opened in 1994 by Princess Margaret. The next four cinemas and other areas of the building were converted into the five dance studios and associated facilities that now house the Northern Ballet School. The Dancehouse Theatre complex extends to some and comprises the theatre, three medium and two large dance studios, a green room, a café bar, theatre bar and coffee shop. The £500,000 cost of converting the theatre was largely met by donations from the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, the Arts Council of England and many other subscribers to the company's development programme.

Technically, the latter is incorrect because it has recently been found not to be a megapode, but one of two genera in the family Sylviornithidae; at the time of its description, it was believed to be a ratite. Sylviornis was never encountered alive by scientists, but it is known from many thousands of subfossil bones found in deposits, some of them from the Holocene, on New Caledonia and the adjacent Île des Pins. Recent morphological studies indicate that it was a sister taxon of Megavitiornis, in a clade outside of the Galliformes crown group. Description Skull Sylviornis was a huge flightless bird, long altogether, and weighing around on average. It is the most massive galliform known to have ever existed. It had a large skull with a high and laterally compressed beak surmounted by a bony knob. Its legs were rather short, but had strong toes with long nails. The skeleton has a number of peculiarities and differences that make Sylviornis stand apart from all other known birds: the clavicles were not fused to a furcula, the number of caudal vertebrae was very high, and the ribcage and pelvis were almost dinosaurian in appearance. The wings were reduced to small stubs. Behaviour A large proportion—up to 50% in some deposits—of the remains found were from juvenile animals. Thus, it has been theorized that Sylviornis had a clutch of at least two, more probably closer to 10 eggs, and that the average lifespan was not much more than 5–7 years, which would be extremely low for such a large bird. It was thought that the bird did not incubate its eggs but built a mound similar to the megapodes. Tumuli on the Île des Pins which were initially believed to be graves were found to contain no human remains or grave goods, and it has been hypothesized that they were in reality the incubation mounds of Sylviornis. As these mounds are up to high and wide even after nearly four millennia, they seem too large to have been made by the giant scrubfowl (Megapodius molistructor), an extinct New Caledonian species of megapode. Sylviornis neocaledoniae skull fragment and tibia, Muséum national d'histoire naturelle, Paris However, recent assessment of this bird as outside and not even particularly closely related to megapodes make the possibility that it was a mound-builder like them strictly unlikely. Ecology Little can be said about the lifestyle of Sylviornis. It was probably a slow-moving browser, and the structure of the bill and feet suggest that roots and tubers it dug up formed a major part of its diet. Extinction The bird was hunted to extinction by the Lapita ancestors of the Kanak people, who settled New Caledonia around 1500 BC. Predation by feral dogs and pigs probably also played a part. The legacy of Sylviornis persists in Kanak oral history in the form of stories giving a rough description of the bird and some of its habits. The native name was du.

Canning Street North signal box, in its present state. Birkenhead Dock Branch is a disused railway line running from the South junction of Rock Ferry, to the site of the former Bidston Dock on the Wirral Peninsula, England. The branch is approximately in length. Although called a branch, the line was accessible from both ends, from Bidston East junction and from Rock Ferry railway station. The former Mollington Street Rail Depot was branched into the line. A section of the line runs through Haymarket Tunnel and a low-level cutting through the centre of Birkenhead; visible from the road flyovers. The former Canning Street North signal box has now been demolished following fire damage, and the rails across the level crossing there have been removed due to the provision of cycle lanes on the roadway. The non-standard gates remain on the east side, but a fence has been erected on the other side despite the railway being officially out of use, rather than closed. Level crossings are also located at Duke Street and Wallasey Bridge Road. The railway lines are still partially intact. Goods yards At the northern end of the branch, disused goods yards are situated parallel to Birkenhead North TMD, Wallasey Bridge Road sidings and, adjacent to the Kingsway Tunnel approach road, Bidston Dock sidings. These two sets of sidings are also accessible by rail, through a series of points between Birkenhead North TMD and Bidston station. Up until the 1980s, goods yards around the docks were much more extensive, with lines along the sides of both East and West Float. Further lines and sidings were along Duke Street, around Vittoria Dock, along Four Bridges Road and Birkenhead Road into Seacombe, and in the area around Wallasey, Egerton and Morpeth Docks. Ownership The northern part of the track to the west of Canning Street North signal box and to the east of Wallasey Bridge Road level crossing, was owned by Mersey Docks and Harbour Company. It is presently understood to be in the ownership of Peel Holdings. The main part of this section runs parallel, on the northern side, to Corporation Road, across Duke Street, parallel Beaufort Road. The sections of the branch between and inclusive of Rock Ferry railway station, Canning Street North signal box, and the section west of Wallasey Bridge Road level crossing are understood to have been in the ownership of Railtrack and, subsequently, Network Rail. Present condition Most of the trackwork is still in place, along the line. However, most of the sidings at Bidston Dock, and all of the sidings at Wallasey Bridge Road and Mollington Street Depot have been removed. The double track formation from Bidston to Wallasey Road Bridge was lifted in 2020 to make way for a new substation as part of the Power Supply upgrade works. One remnant still in situ is an old brick electrical cubicle which was positioned adjacent to the level crossing. The track from Bidston East Junction to Bidston station has been removed, however, here, the track foundation also remains serviceable. Cavendish sidings have been removed and replaced with warehouses adjacent to West Float. Further up the line, the tunnel from Birkenhead Town to Birkenhead Woodside has been partly infilled. Two of the four tracks in the Haymarket Tunnel have been removed. Mollington Link bridge has been replaced and narrowed to a twin-track width. As yet, no track has been relaid onto the Mollington Link bridge. The line is heavily overgrown with flora, along its entire duration. There has been a degree of flytipping on the line in the centre of Birkenhead. During February and March 2016, tree clearance work was undertaken for safety reasons from Rock Ferry towards Birkenhead. History As part of the Chester and Birkenhead Railway, the railway from Rock Ferry to Birkenhead Town is one of the oldest stretches of track in the world. The line was completed and opened on 23 September 1838, less than nine years after the Rainhill Trials, across the River Mersey, on the outskirts of Liverpool. Before Monks Ferry was opened in 1844, the line was originally to a temporary terminus known as Birkenhead Grange Lane station. Grange Lane engine shed was opened on 23 September 1840. The section, from Grange Lane to Bridge End near Cathcart Street, was built into a cutting known as the Sough (pronounced \\"Suff\\"), opening the same day as Birkenhead Park, on 5 April 1847. The connection with the Great Western Railway at Green Lane Junction was made in 1847. In 1856-7, the Birkenhead Railway acquired a pair of 0-4-0T saddle tank locomotives, for use around the docks, from Sharp, Stewart. These were renumbered as 95 and 96 by the GWR, after the joint takeover of the railway, with the LNWR, in 1860. At Bidston, the line was connected to the Great Central Railway in 1896. =20th century= Ownership of the railway circa. 1913-1914 was as follows: *Rock Ferry to Canning Street North was controlled by Birkenhead Joint Railway, whose ownership was shared between the GWR and LNWR. *The track from Canning Street North to Wallasey Bridge Road was operated by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. *The route from Wallasey Bridge Road, around the remnant of Wallasey Pool, to the site of the as-yet unbuilt Bidston Dock, was operated by the Wirral Railway. =British Railways steam era= The Class 9F locomotive 92203, later named as Black Prince, worked the final steam-hauled iron ore train from Bidston Dock in November 1967. =British Rail diesel era= During the BR era, the line was used by various classes of diesel locomotive, primarily for hauling offloaded iron ore from Bidston Dock, to the John Summers Steelworks in Shotton. The John Summers wagons came under the TOPS code of PHO. Fully loaded, a train was limited to eleven of these wagons. This work was carried out by engines with a high traction capacity, usually either a Class 40 locomotive, or pairs of Class 24 or Class 25 locomotives. However, pairs of Class 20 diesels were also occasionally used, although very infrequently. This work was ceased in March 1980, when the steelworks at Shotton was closed. Between 1983 and 1985, Class 503 electric multiple units were stored at Cavendish Sidings, before scrapping. Amongst the few and final passenger workings on the line was the Birkenhead Bandit railtour, hauled by Class 40 locomotive 40122 D200, on 16 February 1985. Others included the Mersey Meanderer railtour on 19 April 1986, Hertfordshire Rail Tours' Wirral Withershins charter on 18 January 1986 and their Cheshire Cat charter, on 24 June 1989. Goods workings continued on the line, for traffic to the Spillers Mill on East Float until the late 1980s with grain wagon traffic from Whitemoor Yard. Afterwards, a thrice-weekly coal train operated on the line until 1992. Some of the last locomotives to have served within the dock complex were Birkenhead North TMD's allocation of Class 03 shunters, 03073, 03162, 03170 and 03189 all of which have been preserved. Indeed, the railways around the docks saw the last mainland use of the class by British Rail, before their withdrawal in March 1989. The last traffic along the line, from Birkenhead North to Rock Ferry, was a Class 08 shunter on 10 May 1993. Subsequently, the line was mothballed by Railtrack. However, the trackwork remains in place and various other railway artefacts are still in existence. The line has been used on only two occasions since 1993, both a day apart. In January 2008, an EWS Class 66 diesel entered the line at Rock Ferry station. =Rea Bulk Handling locomotives= The Rea Bulk Handling Company had a small fleet of nine Drewry 0-4-0DM and 0-6-0DM diesel shunters, which operated on the dock lines. The names of these locomotives included; Theseus, Wabana, Kathleen Nicholls, Pegasus, WH Salthouse, Dorothy Lightfoot, Narvik, Teucer and Pepel. A further 0-4-0DE locomotive built by the Yorkshire Engine Company, named Labrador, and of similar design to a Class 02, also worked around the Bidston Dock area. After the end of the iron ore traffic through Bidston Dock, Rea Ltd. ceased its railway activity around the docks and the remaining shunting duties were taken over by Class 03s. Future The former Railtrack has, in the past, indicated an interest in seeing the line reopened for goods services. However, Network Rail as of 2012 has not followed through with any action in this regard. The Peel Group, who are behind the multibillion-pound Wirral Waters redevelopment of the docks, announced in February 2013 that they intend on using the abandoned route to run a streetcar system. The plan involves connecting Wirral Waters to the Merseyrail network at Birkenhead North and Hamilton Square stations, utilising the stretch of dock branch trackbed along Beaufort Road and Corporation Road, with inner and outer loops around Vittoria Dock and East Float, respectively. Options to connect this new system to Conway Park and Birkenhead Park stations are also available. See also * Birkenhead Railway Notes The footbridge was taken down a few months ago.

Steven Sharpe's version of Gambler is played by Eric Goins in the television series Stargirl for DC Universe and The CW network. Publication history The Steven Sharpe III version of Gambler first appeared in 1944 in Green Lantern #12 in a story titled \\"The Gambler\\" by writer Henry Kuttner and artist Martin Nodell, as a foe of the original Green Lantern. In October 1947, the Gambler was one of the six original members of the Injustice Society, who began battling the Justice Society of America in All Star Comics #37 (Oct 1947). The Steven Sharpe V version of Gambler first appeared in New Titans #68 and was created by Karl Kesel, Barbara Kesel, and Steve Erwin. Fictional character biographies =Steven Sharpe III= Steven Sharpe III came from a long line of compulsive gamblers. When he proposed to his girlfriend Helen the day after his high school graduation, she refused unless he could prove he was not a compulsive gambler like his grandfather. She then ran off with a \\"Pool Hall\\" Charlie, another gambler, who had just won a fortune on the lottery. Sharpe vowed to become a new person after this day. As luck would have it, an armored truck crashed a few feet away from him. Seeing this as a sign, Sharpe helped himself to all of the money he could get and vowed to take whatever he could from life from that day on. He adopted the name the Gambler in remembrance of his grandfather. For the next few years, the Gambler joined a traveling carnival, where he gained his skills with disguises, pistols, and throwing knives. Sharpe was immediately successful as a criminal. He started off robbing trains and small town banks. Growing bored, he moved East to the big cities. He was spotted in Gotham City by Green Lantern while standing next to his own wanted poster. The Gambler eluded Green Lantern twice using his special Derringer, which could fire ammonia or blackout gas in addition to real bullets. When he emerged again, he had adopted a new identity after his riverboat gambling grandfather: The Gambler. As the Gambler, he earned early fame by pulling off a small town bank robbery against heavy odds. At some point, Sharpe spent time with a carnival, learning a variety of knife throws and make-up techniques to complete his disguises. So effective were his disguises that Sharpe himself claims to have forgotten his original appearance and his age to this day remains unknown. Initially, Sharpe remained in the Mississippi Delta, robbing trains, small town banks and the like. One of the first true costumed criminals, he rapidly became one of the most successful criminals and developed a cult of personality reminiscent of the gangsters of the previous decade. By 1944, the Gambler's ego was not satisfied with his Midwestern successes and took his operations to the larger cities of the East. He took the brazen tack of hanging out in post offices next to his own \\"Wanted\\" poster to provoke passers-by, two of which were Alan Scott and Doiby Dickles. Realizing that the famous criminal was in Gotham City, Scott assumed his identity as Green Lantern and pursued the criminal. He caught up with the Gambler twice, only to be thwarted by the special derringer that the Gambler kept hidden in his sleeve, one which fired ammonia or blackout gas. Finally, at a horse race, the Gambler decided to shift the odds in his favor by provoking the horses to stampede into the crowds to cover his escape. Green Lantern rounded up the beasts, however, and after the capture of his henchmen, the Gambler himself was apprehended and sent to Gotham State Penitentiary as #131313 (Green Lantern vol. 1 #12). Gambler, like most criminals in comics, was extremely adept at escaping from prison. In 1946, he wrote a note to Green Lantern telling the hero that he would escape prison and then daring the hero to stop him. When the hero arrived to search the prison, he was surprised to see his friend Doiby Dickles in a cell. The Gambler had used his mastery of disguise to confuse Green Lantern. In the confusion, Gambler managed to escape with Green Lantern's help, as well as to free all of the inmates of the prison. He used the real Dickles as a hostage to escape Green Lantern. In another escape, Gambler bribed the executioner at his own electrocution to rig the floor to be electrified instead of the chair. This incapacitated the crowd, which included Green Lantern, and allowed him to escape. Gambler clashed with Green Lantern many more times over the years. At one time, he won a gambling vessel and armed it to the teeth. Another time he helped an art collector commit insurance fraud, coming into conflict with Starman and Sandman. Gambler was one of the original members of the Injustice Society, which planned to kill the Justice Society and control the United States using an army of escaped convicts. The Gambler was able to capture the Atom, and all the other members save Green Lantern were imprisoned. This group failed miserably due to Green Lantern impersonating the Thinker after faking his death, and Gambler returned to prison. He escaped from prison again and came into conflict with The Flash and Green Lantern. He even teamed up with Icicle and Fiddler in an attempt to kill Starman. At one point, Gambler married and had a son. He had two grandchildren to whom he imparted much of his criminal knowledge. The last time that Sharpe was paroled, he traveled to Las Vegas. He fell in love with the gambling in the Taj Mahal Casino. What the Gambler did not know was that the games in this casino were rigged, and he soon lost every penny. This final defeat coupled with all of the defeats he had suffered at the hands of costumed heroes was too much for Sharpe. Using his famous Derringer pistol, he shot himself in the head. His suicide was later avenged by his granddaughter, Rebecca, who became the villain known as Hazard. His grandson, Steven V, also became a villain: the second Gambler. Due to the irregularities of comic book time and the difficulty of merging Earth-2 (which was a \\"real\\" time comic) into a new Post-Crisis Earth, the year of the Gambler's suicide was either 1) a historical 1985 or 1986, or 2) a movable \\"one year before the debut of Injustice Unlimited\\" according to Hazard's background tale told in Infinity Inc #35 (1987). As part of the Blackest Night event, Steven's III corpse is reanimated by a black power ring and recruited to the Black Lantern Corps in Blackest Night #4. In \\"DC Rebirth,\\" Gambler was seen trying to rob a bank only to be thwarted by Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz.Green Lanterns Vol. 1 #15. DC Comics. =Steven Sharpe V= After the death of Steven III, Steven Sharpe V took over his grandfather's mantle as the Gambler. While keeping his identity as the Gambler hidden and masquerading as the Joker, he reorganized and reoutfitted the Royal Flush Gang. Under his leadership, the Gang battled the New Titans, but were defeated. (New Titans #68-69) The Gambler teamed up with Amos Fortune, the Wizard (William Zard), and the second Sportsmaster, and created a super-powered \\"fight club\\" using members of the Justice Society as combatants. The fight club was broken up by Stargirl, Gypsy, and Vixen. Powers and abilities Gambler is an expert gambler, strategist, and master of disguise. Despite lacking any real superpowers, his cunning nature and talent for spotting opportunities makes him extremely unpredictable and dangerous. =Equipment= Gambler is highly skilled with his signature weapon, a derringer pistol he keeps concealed on his person and has been modified to shoot different kinds of gases depending on the situation. He also is highly trained in the use of throwing knives. In other media The Gambler appears in Stargirl portrayed by Eric Goins. First appearing in the pilot episode, Sharpe accompanies the Injustice Society in their attack on the Justice Society of America, during which he fought the JSA's leader Starman. In his civilian identity, Sharpe is the egocentric and cut-off CFO of \\"The American Dream\\", a private firm that works to economically revitalize Blue Valley. In the episode \\"S.T.R.I.P.E.,\\" Sharpe meets with his leader, Icicle, in the Injustice Society's secret headquarters underneath The American Dream to discuss whether Starman's successor, Stargirl, is a potential threat to their plans. After assisting Icicle in making preparations, Sharpe helps the ISA enact Project: New America in the two-part episode, \\"Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.\\", but after Stargirl's JSA foil their plans, he wipes the ISA's servers and escapes while his teammates are either killed or captured. The Steven Sharpe III version of Gambler appears in All-New Batman: The Brave and the Bold #7.

In these organosulfur compounds, sulfur is pyramidal. They are often prepared in situ by acidification of the corresponding sulfinate salts, which are typically more robust than the acid. These salts are generated by reduction of sulfonyl chlorides. An alternative route is the reaction of Grignard reagents with sulfur dioxide. Transition metal sulfinates are also generated by insertion of sulfur dioxide into metal alkyls, a reaction that may proceed via a metal sulfur dioxide complex. Unsubstituted sulfinic acid, when R is the hydrogen atom, is a higher energy isomer of sulfoxylic acid, both of which are unstable. Examples An example of a simple, well-studied sulfinic acid is phenylsulfinic acid. A commercially important sulfinic acid is thiourea dioxide, which is prepared by the oxidation of thiourea with hydrogen peroxide.D.

History Kingsessing Township was a township in the extreme southwestern portion of the county, roughly encompassing what is now known today as Southwest Philadelphia. It was bounded on the north by Blockley Township; on the east by Mill Creek and Schuylkill River; on the south by Delaware River and Bow Creek; and on the west by Darby Creek and Cobbs Creek. It embraces the site of the old village of Kingsessing. The township contained no other settlements of any size except Maylandville. It was traversed principally by the Darby Road and the road to Lazaretto. Its greatest length, ; greatest breadth, ; area, . This was the oldest settled portion of the county of Philadelphia. The Kingsessing settlement was started by Swedes who settled the colony of New Sweden. Most of the settlers were Finns. Dating to 1646, it was the first village settled by Europeans within the territory of Philadelphia. Fort Nya Vasa at Kingsessing, was located on the eastern-side of Cobbs Creek near Cobbs Creek Parkway and Greenway Avenue. Day, Elizabeth D.

The township and village were incorporated into the City of Philadelphia following the Act of Consolidation, 1854. For the 18th and most of the 19th centuries Kingessing was a rural township with farms, orchards and market gardens. A major botanic and horticultural garden, Bartram's Garden was located in Kingessing Township, and was frequently called the \\"Kingsess Garden.\\" By the middle of the 19th century, Kingessing was a major center for the nursery and florist gardens in Philadelphia County. The name Kingsessing or Chinsessing comes from the Lenape word for \\"a place where there is a meadow\\". The origins of Kingsessing are found in the village of the same name that roughly occupied the same site as the current neighborhood. Kingsessing became the name of the township in which the original Lenape and Swedish village stood. Population More than 80,000 people live in Southwest Philadelphia.

Transportation A number of SEPTA Subway- Surface Trolley Lines traverse the area along Chester, Woodland, and Elmwood Avenues, providing easy access to Center City through the 40th Street Portal. These also extend to Darby and Yeadon. Southwest Philly is served by 4 of the 5 Subway-Surface Lines (Trolleys) 11, 13, 34, and 36. It is also served by bus routes 12, 37, 52, 64, 108, G, and also with the Airport and Media/Elwyn Regional Rail lines. *Airport Line-Eastwick Station & Terminus at the Airport *Media/Elwyn Line-49th St & Angora Station. *Route 11 runs along Woodland Avenue to Darby *Route 13 runs along Chester Avenue to Yeadon and with some scheduled trips to Darby with route 11. *Route 34 runs along Baltimore Avenue to Angora *Route 36 runs along Elmwood Avenue to Eastwick near the Philadelphia Int'l Airport. Philadelphia International Airport, a number of oil refineries, and many heavy industrial uses are located in the Southwest section. The housing stock is diverse with ornate Queen Anne style twin mansions in the neighborhoods bordering Cedar Park, plainer and simpler styles of twins predominating closer to the airport, and newer rowhouses, many with porches, filling in many neighborhoods. The South Philadelphia Sports Complex is very close to Southwest Philadelphia. Less than 1% of Southwest is covered by trees, giving it one of the lowest ratios of shade tree cover in the city.The Benjamin Franklin Tercentenary See also *Bartram's Garden *Newkirk Viaduct Monument * References External links *Southwest Community Development Corporation *Row House Days: Tales from a Southwest Philadelphia Childhood, Jack Myers, 2005 * Populated places established in 1646 1646 establishments in North America Irish-American neighborhoods ","title":"Southwest Philadelphia"},{"id":"5705040","text":"The University of North Carolina at Wilmington Arboretum, also known as the UNCW Arboretum, is an arboretum being developed on the University of North Carolina at Wilmington campus in Wilmington, North Carolina.

Reachback, in Berne's lexicon, is the period of time during which an impending event begins to influence an individual's behavior, including his level of stress.Karl Albrecht, Stress and the Manager (1986) p. 90-1 Berne's formulation Berne, the founder of transactional analysis, coined the term in his book What Do You Say After You Say Hello?. He considered that reachback \\"is most dramatically seen in people with phobias whose whole functioning may be disturbed for days ahead at the prospect of getting into a feared situation, such as a medical examination or a journey.\\"Eric Berne, What Do You Say After You Say Hello? (1974) p. 260 For instance, a person expecting to take a trip on Monday starts getting irritable and worried on Friday. He may start trying to clear his overflowing inbox, cut short his evening relaxation, start preparing and packing for the trip, worry about what clothes to take, and so on. However, \\"for people who have unusual difficulties with anticipatory stress, the reach- back of an event such as a major vacation trip or a wedding may be several weeks.\\"Albrecht, p. 91 Berne differentiates reachback from forward planning, which is done to mitigate negative effects such as reachback. The flip side of reachback is afterburn, which is defined as the effect a past atypical event continues to have on a person's schedule, activities and mental state even after it is materially over. Berne considered that \\"each person has a sort of standard 'reachback time' and 'afterburn time' for various kinds of situations [...] domestic quarrels, examination or hearings, work deadlines, travel, visits from or to relatives, etc.\\"Berne, p. 266 =Prevention= Following William Osler's prescription for equable living day-by-day, Berne explained that \\"living day by day means living a well-planned and organized life, and sleeping well between each day, so that the day ends without reachback, since tomorrow is well planned, and begins without afterburn, since yesterday was well-organized\\".Berne, p. 268 Defense usage Reachback is also used in the US Department of Defense as the process of obtaining products, services, applications, forces, equipment, or material from organizations that are not forward deployed.Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms.

Originally constructed for the Ottoman Empire, and called Bourdjou-Zaffer, she was purchased by the British Government before completion. She was designed by the Ottoman naval architect Ahmed Pasha and built by Samuda Brothers at Cubitt Town, London under contract for the Ottoman Empire. However, in 1878 she was purchased by the British Government whilst still under construction, in a reaction to the war between the Ottoman Empire and Russia. Her sister, , which was purchased at the same time in an essentially complete state, was modified so as to fit in, as far as possible, with contemporary design in the Royal Navy. Orion, being less advanced in construction at the time of her purchase, was ultimately completed along the same lines. Her original design called for four 10-inch muzzle-loading rifles in a centrally located box battery, but this plan was upgraded to four guns during her building. She, and Belleisle were the only British ships ever to mount 12-inch calibre artillery deployed to fire only on the broadside. It was possible, because of the provision of appropriate embrasures in the battery, to bring at least one gun to bear at any angle; proponents of the turret system of armament pointed out that in the turret system two, or possibly four guns could be made to bear on the same target. Service history She was commissioned to the Mediterranean Fleet on 24 June 1878. After paying off into the Reserve at Malta in 1883 she was recommissioned in 1885, and served as guardship at Singapore until 1890, when she was demoted to the second class reserve at Malta. After refit and repair she remained in dockyard reserve at Chatham until declared non-effective in January 1902. Three months later, in April 1902, she became a depot-ship at Malta for torpedo-boats, Captain Charles Madden in command. In 1913 she was converted to a store-ship at Devonport under the name of Orontes until her sale in 1913.

He considered that \\"in most cases one or the other can be tolerated without serious consequences. It can be dangerous for almost anyone, however, if the after-burn of the last event overlaps with the reach-back from the next ... this is a good definition of overwork\\".Berne, p. 264 =Remedies= Berne considered that \\"dreaming is probably the normal mechanism for adjusting after-burn and reach-back\\",Berne, p. 267 but that sex and holidays were also useful remedies. \\"Most normal after-burns and reach-backs run their courses in about six days, so that a two-week vacation allows the superficial after-burns to burn out, after which there are a few days of carefree living. ...For the assimilation of more chronic after-burns and deeper, repressed reach-backs, however, a vacation of at least six weeks is probably necessary.\\" Other views In terms of exam stress management, \\"afterburn is the time needed after the exam to... set it to rest\\", a period of \\"afterburn time...

The rear wing of the building was constructed in 1902. In the 1970s, the building was used by a printing co- operative.

In 2001, Yorkshire Artspace moved to purpose-built premises at Persistence Works, and the building stood largely empty, other than a small part used by a recording studio. In 2005, the Works were used as a convergence centre for opposition to the G8 Finance Ministers' meeting in Sheffield. Renamed the \\"Matilda\\", it was then developed as a squatted social centre, including gig spaces, artists' studios, exhibition space, IT facilities, a cafe and several meeting spaces.

The artifact or document itself is presented for the jury's inspection. Examples may include a weapon allegedly used in the crime, an invoice or written contract, a photograph, or a video recording. The main concept behind correct evidence handling is that the item recovered is the same as that produced in the court room. The usual term applied to such handling is \\"chain of custody\\". The term denotes the links in the handling of the exhibit in question. For example, details of the item, the place, date, time it was recovered, and by whom it was recovered - the first link. The subsequent links in the chain refer to anyone required to handle the exhibit, mainly for identification purposes. The final link is the production of the item in court. This particular level of auditable handling is paramount when dealing with items of a forensic nature, as it reduces the opportunity for the defense to challenge the authenticity of the item. The chain of custody can be less stringent when dealing with property which has a unique identifying feature like a serial number. In such a case, the physical security becomes the main concern of the person recovering the item. Such security is normally achieved by booking the item into a central evidence room. The exhibits in any one law case are often labelled Exhibit A, Exhibit B, Exhibit C, etc. to distinguish between them. Other uses In personal injury cases, a legal or medical exhibit is created containing drawings or illustrations of human anatomy with graphic, medically accurate depictions of injuries and surgeries sustained by the plaintiff as a result of an accident or injury. Legal exhibits are commonly used by trial attorneys in personal injury cases to maximize the value of the case, enhance settlement negotiations, increase effectiveness of medical expert testimony and maximize trial presentation. The most common types of personal injury claims are road traffic accidents, accidents at work, tripping accidents, assault claims, accidents in the home, product defect accidents (product liability) and holiday accidents.

Biography  Julius was born to Jakob Guttmann (1845–1919) while Jakob served as Chief Rabbi at Hildesheim during the years 1874 to 1892, when Hildesheim still had a large Jewish population. Jakob himself published papers on a number of philosophical topics. The family moved to Breslau in 1880. Julius received his basic training at the Breslau Rabbinical Seminary and the University of Breslau. He was Lecturer at Breslau from 1910 to 1919, and Lecturer at the Hochschule for the Academic Study of Judaism (The Reform Seminary) in Berlin from 1919 to 1934. At that time, he became Professor of Jewish Philosophy at Hebrew University, a position which he held until his death.  Works  Guttmann is best known for Die Philosophie des Judentums (Reinhardt, 1933), translations of which are available in Hebrew, Spanish, English, Japanese, etc. The English title is The Philosophy of Judaism: The History of Jewish Philosophy from Biblical Times to Franz Rosenzweig. sees in this publication \\"the last product in the direct line of the authentic Judaeo-German 'Science of Judaism',\\" more commonly known as Wissenschaft des Judentums. While that movement did not utterly expire with the publication of Guttman's work—its spirit living on in the work of G. Scholem and H.A. Wolfson among many others—it is certainly the case that the Wissenschaft movement in Germany had by the 1930s already ceased to thrive. The original German edition of Philosophie des Judentums ends with Hermann Cohen, the primary influence on Guttman's own philosophy, while the later Hebrew edition includes Franz Rosenzweig. It is also notable that Guttman's work excludes major thinkers of the Kabbalistic school, which reflects his own attitude toward Jewish philosophy (Werblowsky 1964). = Personalities Appearing in \\"Die Philosophie des Judentums\\" = * Chiwi al- Balkhi * Saadia ben Joseph * Isaac Israeli * Solomon ibn Gabirol * Bahya ibn Paquda * Yehuda Halevy * Abraham ibn Daud * Moses Maimonides * Levi ben Gerson * Chasdai Crescas * Moses Mendelssohn * Spinoza * Solomon Formstecher * Samuel Hirsch * Nachman Krochmal * Salomon Ludwig Steinheim * Moritz Lazarus * Hermann Cohen * Franz Rosenzweig  See also  * Isaac Husik, whose English language history of medieval Jewish philosophy bears similarities to Guttmann's Philosophies of Judaism.

When sentenced to three years for hijacking a bus, Nugent refused to wear a prison uniform and said the prison guards would have to \\"...nail it to my back\\". Early life Nugent was an adolescent in Northern Ireland during the most intense years of the Troubles. On 20 March 1973, aged 15, he was standing with a friend on the corner of Merrion Street and Grosvenor Road, when a car pulled up beside them and one of the occupants asked them for directions. Another occupant of the vehicle then opened fire with a submachine gun. Nugent was seriously wounded after being shot eight times in the chest, arms and back by the loyalists in the car. His friend, Bernard McErlean, aged 16, was killed.H Block - British Jail for Irish Political Prisoners by Fr. Denis Faul and Fr. Raymond Murray 1979Sutton Index of Deaths Prison life At some point afterwards, Nugent joined the IRA. He was arrested, aged 16, by the British Army and spent five months on remand in Crumlin Road Prison, Belfast. When he was eventually tried, the case against him was withdrawn and he was released. He became an active volunteer until his arrest and internment, without trial, on 9 February 1975. He served nine months in Cage 4 of Long Kesh Detention Centre in Northern Ireland, until 12 November 1975. He was arrested and imprisoned again on 12 May 1976, for the hijacking a bus. On 14 September 1976 he was sentenced to three years, and returned to the same prison, which was renamed the Maze. He became the first republican prisoner convicted since the withdrawal of Special Category Status for those convicted through juryless courts, due to the British policy of 'criminalisation', reintroduced that March. Among other things, this change in policy meant convicted paramilitaries could no longer wear their own clothes. He refused to wear the uniform, declaring himself a political prisoner and not a criminal, beginning the blanket protest. He was soon joined by Jackie McMullan, the next prisoner to wear a blanket instead of a uniform, followed by six more Irish republican prisoners from the Beechmount area of Belfast. By Christmas 1976, the number of participants had risen to over forty prisoners.

She was head coach at the University of Arizona for 17 seasons, leading the Wildcats to the Women's National Invitation Tournament championship in 1996. She was fired by Arizona on March 17, 2008 with one year left on her contract, after a disappointing 10-20 record in her final season. Before joining Arizona in 1991, she coached the Long Beach State 49ers to a 325-71 mark over 12 seasons. During her tenure, the 49ers won at least 24 games each season, winning 10 Big West Conference titles and making 10 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances, including Final Four appearances in 1987 and 1988. Bonvicini is the all-time most successful coach in the history of University of Arizona. She guided the Wildcats to nine post-season appearances, including one Women's National Invitation Tournament championship. The Wildcats finished in the upper echelon of the Pacific-10 Conference nine years under her direction. In February 2007, Bonvicini reached the 600 win milestone, becoming the 18th coach in NCAA Division I women's basketball history to reach this mark. She coached many talented players at Long Beach, including LaTaunya Pollard, the 1983 Wade Trophy winner, 3-time 1st team All-American, 1980 Olympic Team member, and member of the women's basketball hall of fame; 2-time 1st team All-American and 1988 U.S. Olympic Team member Cindy Brown; 1985 1st team All-American Kirsten Cummings; and 2-time 1st team All-American Penny Toler, the current general manager of the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks. At Arizona, she coached one All-American, five honorable mention All-American selections, one Pacific-10 Player of the Year, and 14 Academic All-Pacific-10 selections. Entering the 2009-10 season, Bonvicini held a career mark of 612-294 as a head coach, including a 287-223 record at Arizona. In Arizona's 2003-04 season, she led the Wildcats to a perfect home record and a regular season Pacific-10 title. She is a 1975 graduate of Southern Connecticut State University, where, as a guard, she led her team to third and fourth place in the AIAW tournament (the AIAW existed prior to the NCAA allowing women to compete for national titles). Bonvicini was a finalist for the 1976 U.S. Olympic Basketball Team. Bonvicini was inducted as a player into the Southern Connecticut State University Hall of Fame in 1989, the Connecticut Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 1994 and the New England Basketball Hall of Fame in 2007. In October 1996, she was inducted as a coach into the Long Beach State Hall of Fame. Bonvicini began her coaching career under the wing of two of the game's finest coaches: Darlene May of California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and Frances Schaafsma of California State University, Long Beach. USA Basketball Bonvicini was chosen as the assistant coach of the team representing the USA in 1982 at the William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The team started out strongly, winning their first four games by 16 or more points. In the fifth game, they were matched against Australia. The game was close until the end. With a half-minute remaining, the USA held a one- point margin. The USA extended the lead to three points on two free throws, the Aussies brought it back to one with two free throws of their own, and the USA hit two free throws with two seconds left in the game to secure the 65–62 victory. The next two games were easy victories, then the USA faced unbeaten Canada in the final game. The game was very close, but the USA fell to Canada 70–67 to finish with a single loss and the silver medal. USA players Lea Henry and Paula McGee were named to the All-Tournament Team. Bonvicini was the head coach of the team representing the USA at the World University Games held in Buffalo, New York in July 1993. The USA opened with double-digit margin victories over Israel, Taiwan, and the Ukraine. Their next game was against Russia, and they held a single point lead with just over ten minutes to go in the game, but they finished strong, and won 72–55. The next game was against Cuba, which included six players from their 1992 Olympic team. The USA pulled out to a 15-point lead at halftime, had extended to an 18-point lead at one time, but Cuba proved to be too strong, and came back to defeat the USA 88–80. After beating Japan, the USA faced China, whose team also featured many members of their silver medal winning Olympic team. The USA fell behind; their comeback attempt fell two points shy of tying the game. The final score in favor of China was 75–73. The opponent in the bronze medal game was Lithuania. The USA team won 83–73 to earn the bronze medal.

Serving Nebraska since 1937, State Patrol troopers perform a wide variety of duties. Those include working with communities to improve public safety, enforcing traffic laws and drug laws, investigating crimes, and enforcing the laws and regulations pertaining to motor carriers. The current NSP Superintendent is Colonel John A. Bolduc. NSP is divided into six districts including: *Headquarters in Lincoln: Captain Lance Rodgers *Troop A in Omaha: Captain Brenda Konfrst *Troop B in Norfolk: Captain Paul Hattan *Troop C in Grand Island: Captain Jeromy McCoy *Troop D in North Platte: Captain Martin Denton *Troop E in Scottsbluff: Captain Kurt Von Minden Divisions NSP has several divisions which operate within the department, they include: *The Aviation Support Division which consists of a Bell 407 helicopter, three Turbo Cessna T206H's equipped with FLIR and downlink capabilities, and a Piper Super Cub used for traffic enforcement, observation and surveillance. The Aviation Support Division is used for many different functions including: Drug raids, presidential security, rescue missions, investigative photography, transportation, surveillance, and traffic enforcement. *The State Capitol Security Division is responsible for the daily security needs of the \\"Capitol Complex Area\\". The State Capitol is equipped with over 60 cameras that are recorded using a \\"Digital Video Recorder\\" which allows them to store video images and print out still images. *The Carrier Enforcement division operates permanent truck scales throughout the state, conducts carrier inspections and is in charge of monitoring commercial motor vehicle accidents. *Communications - Statewide, 50 Communications Specialists staff the six communications centers located in Omaha, Lincoln, Norfolk, Grand Island, North Platte and Scottsbluff. *Community Policing *Executive Protection *Internal Affairs *Investigative Services *The K-9 Division consists of 15 troopers and their police service dogs. Each dog costs about $3,500-$5,000. The division relies heavily on public support. The dogs are purchased by the Nebraska State Patrol Foundation using donations from the public. *Legal *Supply and Radio Engineering *The Traffic Enforcement division makes up about 200 troopers which are responsible for over of roads in Nebraska. *The Training Academy conducts both the Basic Recruit Camp and in service training. Training academy NSP runs their own 24-week in-resident training academy in lieu of sending recruits through the standard Nebraska Law Enforcement Training Center's 13-week course. The new Nebraska State Patrol Training Academy is co-located with the Nebraska Law Enforcement Training Center in Grand Island, Nebraska. The collocation of agencies upgraded the facilities for virtually every officer completing law enforcement certification in the State of Nebraska. The Training Academy includes: barracks to house up to 208 officers, modern classrooms, a defensive tactics room, a fitness room, a training tank, a gymnasium, a recreation area, 2 ranges (1 static shooting, 1 combat), an inspection bay and training room for commercial vehicle inspections, a police service dog training grounds/boarding area, a driving range, and a cafeteria. The State Patrol's style of instruction balances a para-military environment with an academic environment. The curriculum includes instruction in officer survival, investigations, patrolling, legal, administrative, tactical, human understanding, traffic (motor vehicle laws), and carrier enforcement. The Training Academy staff is well-versed in educational theories such as state-to-state training and adult learning guidelines. The recruits undergo nearly one thousand hours of instruction during camp. The challenge is to ensure they are absorbing and retaining the information. In accordance with the adult learning theory, classes run into the evening rather than starting too early in the morning and much of the instruction involves hands-on and scenario-based training. State- to-state training means the staff tries to present the instruction in the same conditions and environments the recruits will actually experience on the street.

Rick Hader was the brother of screenwriter Matt Hader and the uncle of Bill Hader, \\"Looking for gold on SNL\\", Tulsa World, September 12, 2008. a die-hard Chicago Cubs fan, and a high school math teacher and football coach at Union High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma before he began his career as a clown. Performances Hader's performances as Myron Noodleman began when he showed up at a school football game in the late-1980s dressed in full nerd regalia. After a few more trials, he hired an agent, attended the Baseball Winter Meetings in 1994, and honed his act through years of touring. Every summer he has performed at over 60 to 70 baseball parks across North America. He has been the celebrity attraction to numerous Nerd Night promotions. Myron's persona was reminiscent of the nerdy Jerry Lewis characters of the 1960s: he could be manic and disruptive one moment, and patiently pantomimic the next. Between innings he performed sketches that involved players, umpires, groundskeepers and sometimes fans. One of his signature skits, titled \\"Dueling Signals,\\" was performed to music with a player or coach. It started with Myron flashing a baseball coach's signal and was answered by his skit partner. The signals kept coming faster and faster until there was nothing left to do but break into some contemporary dance moves mixed with a little do-as-I-do. When each routine was over, Myron would go into the stands and circulate among the fans, providing impromptu comedy. He would help himself to a spectator's seat, refreshments, and even girlfriend. In November 2004, Myron Noodleman was bestowed the title \\"Clown Prince of Baseball\\" by baseball administrator Roland Hemond in a ceremony at the Mike Veeck Promotional Seminar at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. Hemond, now executive advisor to the general manager of the Chicago White Sox, once served as general manager for Mike's father, Bill Veeck. Veeck was the one to place the title on the previous and best-known Clown Prince of Baseball, Max Patkin. Baseball's Hall of Fame has yet to recognize Noodleman as heir to the Max Patkin legacy, though as of 2006 no rival claimant has disputed the title.

History Shaw House - showing the side view of the house The manor house of Shaw, Shaw House was built by the wealthy cloth merchant, Thomas Dolman, and completed in 1581. It is famous for its reputation as King Charles I's headquarters during the Second Battle of Newbury. However recent research has proved that, despite being at the centre of the fighting, the King never went to the house. Other Royals have visited, most notably Elizabeth I. In the 1720s, it was acquired by the flamboyant James Brydges, 1st Duke of Chandos. Although it was not the principal residence of the Duke, the family evidently spent some time in the area and the second Duke bought a wife at a sale in Newbury. Anne Wells, a chambermaid from Newbury, who became the second wife of the second Duke of Chandos After the first Duke's death in 1744 the dowager duchess lived at Shaw House till her death in 1750. Her step-son sold the property soon afterwards to the Andrews family. It was the childhood home of the historian, James Pettit Andrews. For many years it was a school. The house is currently owned and managed by West Berkshire Council as a conference venue and public attraction. Restoration Following a major restoration Shaw House opened to the public in 2008. It is also a conference venue and home to West Berkshire's Registration Service for Births, Deaths and Ceremonies. Work began in 2005 after the mansion was awarded more than £4m from the Heritage Lottery Fund. English Heritage and Vodafone also contributed to the £6m project. Visitors can now enjoy a programme of events and activities whilst wandering the house and spending time in the exhibitions and family corner. The House is open most weekends and some school holidays.

A halo car for the company, it was marketed as a personal luxury car. In 1965, the car was marketed as \\"Rambler Marlin\\". For 1966, the car featured \\"Marlin\\" identification only and was officially named \\"AMC Marlin\\", as was the 1967 model. Its fastback roof design was previewed on the 1964 Rambler Tarpon show car, based on the compact Rambler American. 1965 and 1966 model year production Marlins were fastback versions of the mid-sized two-door hardtop Rambler Classic, and 1967 brought a major redesign in which the car was given the new, longer AMC Ambassador full-size chassis. This version had a longer hood and numerous improvements including more interior room and new V8 engines.  Origin  Marlin nameplate As consumer per capita income increased in the early 1960s, the U.S. automobile market expanded. Whereas American Motors’ profitable marketing strategy under George W. Romney had concentrated on compact, economical cars, Romney's successor as CEO, Roy Abernethy, saw larger, more prestigious and luxurious models as a new profit opportunity. The objective was to compete with the \\"Big Three\\" automobile manufacturers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) by expanding AMC's model lines into additional market segments; particularly by developing a sporty, roomy, 6-passenger sedan that would occupy a unique niche in the market. The idea was that the new car would be a distinctive, low-volume model symbolizing a new Rambler look and spearheading a full product line. To be a distinctive competitor in the big league with the Big Three, it was decided that it should be flashy and intermediate-sized, and in an era when other automakers were stressing the power of muscle cars for their intermediate-sized image vehicles, the new model—the Marlin—was to feature comfort and spaciousness. Initially, in response to a proposal for a sporty youth-oriented car, a four- seat fastback design study, the Rambler Tarpon, had been built on the compact- sized Rambler American platform. This was shown as a concept car at various auto shows but AMC's current \\"GEN-1\\" V8 engine would not fit in the comparatively small Rambler chassis; also the new \\"GEN-II\\" V8 designs were still in development, and market research showed that a six-cylinder engine alone would not satisfy potential customers. Management at the small automaker wanted to change \\"its tune\\" with \\"a reasonably sporty 'upsized' response of sorts to Ford's Mustang.\\" The \\"fastback\\" appearance was a revival of sedans built after World War II, as demonstrated by the 1940s Nash Ambassador. Ultimately, and in line with Roy Abernethy's new marketing strategy, the decision was made to build the new fastback model on AMC's intermediate-sized Rambler Classic platform. The development team, under distinguished American designer Dick Teague, had to work with considerably smaller budgets than their counterparts at Detroit's Big Three to create the new Marlin. They created a large, roomy and luxurious fastback which incorporated a number of design features from the Tarpon show car. The signature roof line from the windshield with the Marlin's \\"skylight permits carrying through the true fastback line in an unbroken sweep.\\" However, the roof was raised over the rear passenger area when Abernethy, who was six-foot-four (193 cm tall), insisted on being able to sit in the back seat of the design studies. Teague worked for Chrysler as a stylist during the mid-1950s and the fastback-styling of the lost 1956 Chrysler Norseman concept car's \\"resemblance to (that of) the 1965 Rambler Marlin fastback coupe, or vice versa, was (said to be) uncanny.\\" As the car was targeted at the evolving \\"personal luxury\\" segment, its long list of standard equipment was supplemented by numerous options that enabled buyers to personalize their Marlins.  1965  = Launch = American Motors billed the Marlin as a new addition to the company's self-styled \\"Sensible Spectaculars\\" model line. Backed by extensive advertising and merchandising, the car was officially announced on 10 February 1965, and unveiled in Rambler dealer showrooms on 19 March. New car introductions, more significant in the 1960s than today, were often accompanied by special invitations and heavy publicity. The Marlin was advertised in 2,400 newspapers on its launch day, and American Motors' news releases positioned it as aimed at buyers wanting a sporty fastback that was also roomy and comfortable. This contrasted it with the smaller Barracuda and Mustang fastbacks that had arrived a year earlier. AMC's first model following the muscle car launches of the 1960s, the Marlin was intended to outflank competitors as a product they did not offer - a strategy now called \\"niche marketing\\". The initial Rambler Marlin advertisements stated \\"now in limited production.\\" Every dealership received one or two units to increase showroom traffic, whereas the production numbers are a direct reflection upon the actual number of Rambler automobile dealers and AMC sent bulletins to dealerships telling \\"How to use Marlin to sell the Rambler Classic.\\" According to Tom Coupe, AMC's vice-president for sales, \\"the basic reason we produced the Marlin, is to attract attention to American Motors.\\" The Marlin followed the signature design features of the Ford Galaxie \\"Sports Roof\\", the Plymouth Barracuda, the Mustang 2+2, and the 1965 fastback models from General Motors, including the Chevrolet Impala \\"Sport Coupe\\" versions. A book on American muscle cars says V8-powered Marlins provided appropriate performance for the streamlined appearance. = Press reaction = The new model met with a mixed reception in the press. Popular Mechanics magazine recorded 0 to 60 mph in 10.8 seconds by manually shifting the automatic transmission, and fuel economy of at a steady . Tom McCahill's road test in Mechanics Illustrated recorded 0 to 60 mph in 9.7 seconds with the 327 engine. Motor Trend magazine found the Marlin well balanced and said it added to the market's various personal performance sports cars. The San Francisco Chronicle praised it and noted effortless cruising at .\\" Hot Rod magazine ran the quarter-mile in 17.43 seconds at with the and \\"Flash-O-Matic\\" transmission. The Marlin emphasized the stretched-out hardtop (pillar-less) roofline that followed the contemporary styling vogue. Automobile Quarterly magazine thought the car very ugly and expressed dislike for the inadequacy of the rear-view window, the positions of the steering-wheel and stoplights, the softness of the front seats, and the design of the pedals. = Designer reaction = Vincent Geraci (who became chief of product design and product identity at Chrysler after AMC's buyout), viewed the Marlin as \\"an exciting program ... We took a 1965 body design and turned it into a sportier version. But enlarging the car from its original concept [the Tarpon] and raising the roof produced an adverse effect on overall appearance.\\" Carl Cameron, designer of the original Dodge Charger, named the Marlin as the only competition for his 1966 car even though, he said, the Marlin lacked some of the Charger's features and it was \\"very different\\". Contrary to the view that the Charger was a \\"clone\\" of the Marlin, Cameron said that the starting-point for his design was the fastback 1949 Cadillac, and that any similarity to the Marlin was coincidental. He added that as a result of the exceptionally tall Abernathy's insistence on being able to sit in the Marlin's back seat, \\"those cars had big squared-off roofs\\" whereas the Charger's roof treatment was \\"rounded off, much more pleasing to the eye.\\" = Vehicle appointments and options = Standard features, which focused on comfort and luxurious appearance, included deluxe exterior trim, individual reclining front seats, front and rear center armrests when bucket seats were selected, and interiors from AMC's two-door Ambassador model, including dashboard and instrument panel. On the Marlin, the dashboard was trimmed with engine-turned aluminum. Interior door panels were finished with carpeting and stainless steel trim, when many cars at the time had cheaper stamped vinyl glued to cardboard. Retractable front seatbelts were optional. The reclining bucket seats could be ordered with headrests. The Marlin was also one of the first American automobiles with front disc brakes (four-piston design, by Bendix) as standard. It had drum brakes without servo assistance on the rear. A total of 2,005 Marlins were built with the smallest engine option, a 232 I6.Marlin Production Data, \\"The Marlin Handbook - 2004\\" published by the Marlin Auto Club. Original source: annual AMC factory production documentation. The AMC- designed 4-barrel V8, often paired with an automatic transmission that had the shifter in a floor console, accounted for 42% of total production, while less than 6%, regardless of engine option, had the innovative \\"Twin-Stick\\" manual transmission (with overdrive). The center console-mounted controls offered one longer stick for the regular gears, with a second shorter lever for overdrive selection. It can be shifted as a 5-speed: from 1st to 2nd, to 2nd+OD, to 3rd, to 3rd+OD. Other options included \\"Solex\\" tinted glass (70% of production), power steering, heavy-duty suspension, \\"Twin-Grip\\" limited slip differential, air conditioning, adjustable steering wheel, power windows, and a choice of AM radio or an AM/FM monaural unit (50% of production) with \\"Duo Costic\\" rear speaker and \\"Vibra Tone\\" system to simulate stereophonic sound (stereo broadcasting was not yet widely available in the U.S.). Only 221 Marlins were built without a radio. Wide-ranging interior colors and upholstery choices were available, and options for the exterior, including accent colors for the roof and side window trim, enabled further customization. = Pricing and sales = The MSRP price was US$3,100 (US$ in dollars), compared with $3,063 for a bench seat (six-passenger) version of the Rambler Classic 770 two-door hardtop, which did not have the extra features and luxurious interior of the Marlin. 10,327 Marlins were sold in the abbreviated first year of production.

The Rambler Marlin became known as the AMC Marlin starting with the 1966 model year. All references to \\"Rambler\\" were removed from the car and promotional materials. The other changes were minor (e.g. a slight modification to the extruded aluminum grille, a front sway bar made standard on six-cylinder models, and an optional black vinyl roof cover that continued over the trunk opening). New was an electronic tach on the top of the dash. The year also saw the introduction of the fastback Dodge Charger, a derivative of the intermediate-sized Dodge Coronet, and a sporty model in direct response to the Marlin. The Charger \\"was immediately paired up in the automotive press with American Motors' year-old Marlin, another fastback specialty machine.\\" \\"The fastback Charger had been introduced in mid-season of 1966 in retaliation to the AMC Marlin, Mustang, and Plymouth's Barracuda\\". Together, the intermediate-sized Charger and Marlin were \\"unusual, distinctive and in a class by themselves.\\" General Motors and Ford also positioned products similar to the Marlin as specialized \\"personal luxury\\" coupes and introduced 2-door fastback versions of their full- and intermediate-sized car lines. AMC broadened the car's market appeal by lowering the base price to US$2,601 (US$ in dollars) and offering more options. For example: high-level trim packages that had previously been standard, as well optional floor or center console mounted 4-speed manual transmission and a dash-mounted tachometer, affected small changes in pricing and equipment that paralleled the competition. By comparison, Chrysler did a similar thing with the pricing and content of its Dodge Charger from the 1966 to the 1967 model years. Despite these changes, Marlin production fell to 4,547 in 1966. Popular Science magazine road test comparison of three 1966 sporty fastbacks (Ford Mustang, Plymouth Valiant, and AMC Marlin) highlighted the Marlin's quiet interior, high quality upholstery and positioned seats with adjustable backrests that \\"permit almost any driver to find an ideal seat-to-wheel-to- pedal relationship\\", as well as the \\"best-balanced ride on good roads and bad\\". The two-barrel V8 engine with the three-speed automatic achieved 0 to 60 mph in 11.7 seconds, and was the quietest, but least responsive of the group. The test Marlin's standard drum brakes were criticized as inadequate, with the authors recommending the optional disk brakes.  1967  1967 model was larger, less angular The front end was shared with the AMC Ambassador 1967 luxury and safety oriented interior The all-new 343 \\"Typhoon\\" V8 engine The 1967 model year saw an increase in specialty market segment that included \\"the luxurious personal cars, Thunderbird, Riviera, Marlin, Charger, Toronado and Eldorado.\\" The Marlin was made larger and more expensive for the 1967 model year. It was now built on AMC's completely redesigned wheelbase \\"senior\\" platform, i.e. the AMC Ambassador chassis. The retooling for 1967 design changes that were mostly to the \\"senior\\" line of AMC cars (Ambassador, Marlin, Rebel) cost $35 million. (US$ in dollars) The overall length of the new Marlin's body increased by with more rear seat legroom, as well as being wider resulting in of additional interior room, but in the process the car gained compared to the previous models. Making the Marlin larger was a design requirement in anticipation of the 1968 entry of the compact-platform based Javelin. Also the longer, wider car would improve product differentiation among AMC's various model lines. Motor Trend magazine compared two \\"Sporty Specialties\\" – the 1967 AMC Marlin and Dodge Charger – concluded that both are \\"caught in the middle\\" because \\"neither has the compactness of the basic sports-personal archetypes such as the Mustang or Camaro, nor the posh elegance to social climb\\" to the models such as the Cadillac Eldorado or Buick Riviera. Rather, \\"both aim at the driver who wants a sporty-type car, but who doesn’t want to give up room and comfort and isn’t ready to move into more expensive category.\\" The 1967 Marlin was part of the \\"cool\\" car sales pie that featured sporty cars with \\"the popular fastback silhouette\\". The Ambassador chassis allowed for a longer hood that harmonized better with its fastback rear end, and the body was given a less angular appearance. A bright trim strip from the door opening to the rear bumper accentuates the slightly kicked-up \\"coke bottle\\" profile of the rear fenders. The front end shared the Ambassador's vertically stacked headlights in slightly protruding nacelles, and an all-new recessed extruded aluminum grille with horizontal bars that bowed forward in the center. The grille was a black anodized version of the twin (parking and turn-signal) \\"rally light\\" grille on the Ambassador DPL models. The hood ornament was redesigned, with a small chrome marlin fish set in clear plastic inside a chrome ring. The main feature was the Marlin's fastback roof with \\"stylish elliptical C-pillars that ended \\"between two stubby, squared-off fins\\" in the rear. The decklid was the same as on the previous model, but now without the large round insignia. A bigger back window improved rear visibility. New taillights were similar to those on the first- generation car. The rear bumper was slightly different from the one used on the Ambassador and Rebel station wagons, the top edge being a continuous horizontal line that fits up against the body. Teague said the 1967 car was 'the best-looking Marlin we built.' Motor Trend magazine described the all-new styling of AMC's new full-size cars as \\"attractive\\" and \\"more graceful and easier on the eye in ’67.\\" The second-generation Marlin did not have its own catalog, but was described within the large Ambassador sales brochure. The Ambassador's standard features and options also came on the Marlin. The interiors continued to offer premium materials and fittings, including wood- grain trim, and were the same as on the Ambassador 990 and DPL two-door hardtop models (with the exception of the \\"Custom\\" package that had two matching pillows) that \\"rival more expensive cars for luxury and quality, yet are durable enough to take years of normal wear.\\" Many Marlins were ordered with the reclining buckets seats that not only featured a center armrest between them (with a center cushion for a third occupant or a floor console with gear selector), but also a foldaway center armrest for the rear seat. The interior design was new and featured a safety-oriented dashboard with the instruments and controls grouped in front of the driver, while the rest of the dash was pushed forward and away from the passengers. Protruding knobs and controls were eliminated from any area that the passenger or driver could strike them. The steering wheel was smaller than used before and the column was now designed to collapse under impact. A new lane change feature was made standard for the turn signal. An entirely new family of V8 engines was offered. The six-cylinder was still available, but rarely ordered -only 355 were built. The base V8 was the with a 2-barrel carburetor, while a pair of V8s were optional: a 2-barrel that ran on regular-fuel, as well as a high- compression (10.2:1) premium-fuel version with a 4-barrel carburetor and dual exhaust that produced at 4800 rpm and of torque at 3000 rpm. An entirely new four-link, trailing-arm rear suspension system was introduced eliminating the previous torque tube design. Motor Trend magazine's road test of the Marlin with the 343 engine reported zero to 60 mph in 9.6 seconds, and ran a 17.6-second quarter mile at with two passengers aboard, which was comparable to the performance of a Dodge Charger with a . Fuel economy with the 280 hp V8 averaged city and highway, while with the 155 hp straight-six the big Marlin averaged city and highway. The Marlin \\"also handled well\\" and featured reclining seats that are \\"well worth the extra $44.65 to anyone who travels long distances.\\" Sales of the redesigned Marlin fell to 2,545. This was partly a result of customers' diminishing confidence in the financial health of the automaker under Abernethy's leadership, partly confusion caused by AMC's move away from its loyal \\"economy\\" customer market segments into segments dominated by the domestic \\"Big Three\\" (GM, Ford, and Chrysler), and partially a reflection of cannibalism of its potential market by the successful introduction of the Javelin. Buyers did not turn to the \\"family\\"-sized fastbacks including the Dodge Charger, which saw 1967 model sales drop by half compared to its prior 1966 introductory year. Both the AMC Marlin and the very similar looking first generation Dodge Charger \\"flopped on the market as sporty car buyers were showing their preference for compact pony cars.\\" The Marlin ceased production at the end of the 1967 model year.  Racing  The Marlin \\"was an overlooked performer on the muscle car landscape\\", yet it was campaigned without factory support in motorsport venues. Roy Abernethy was opposed to corporate sponsorship of activities that glamorized speed and performance, and had instituted a prohibition on automobile racing. While the Big Three automakers in the U.S. were focusing on high performance during the early 1960s, AMC ran advertising that said: \\"Why don't we enter high- performance Rambler V-8s in racing? Because the only race Rambler cares about is the human race.\\" Nevertheless, the 1965 Marlin was an attempt to attract younger customers. The Marlin was promoted as an image-breaking model and AMC dealerships began sponsoring Ramblers in auto racing. = Dragstrip = Preston Honea achieved drag racing fame with the \\"Bill Kraft Rambler\\". The effort began in 1964 when the Bill Kraft Rambler dealership had installed a highly modified AMC Ambassador V8 engine (the 327 V8 bored out to , four carburetors, special intake manifold) in a 1964 Rambler that ran at the Fontana dragstrip. For the 1965 season, Kraft built a new \\"Bill Kraft Rambler\\", this time a fastback-bodied Marlin Funny Car on alcohol fuel and nitrous injection. The AMC engine was replaced by a Plymouth Hemi. On its first time out, the Hemi-powered car ran a 10.31-second quarter mile at . = Oval = Roy Haslam, a 1999 inductee to Victoria Auto Racing Hall of Fame, raced his AMC Marlin Super Stock (image) in Canada and the U.S. He won the July Cup and was 3rd in the season point championships. = Endurance = Brothers Larry and Don Hess raced a Marlin in the 1966 24 Hours of Daytona. Sponsored by Queen City Rambler, a Charlotte, North Carolina AMC dealership, the car ran almost stock, even with a radio antenna. The passenger seats were removed, a roll bar installed, and the factory exhaust system replaced with open headers that exited below the doors. The Marlin retired after 80 laps with overheating and steering problems, and was reportedly sold as a used car after the race.  Special versions  American Motors designers and stylists made two operational show cars. Both used the platform of the first generation Marlin and promoted Rambler's new emphasis on luxury and glamour. * The Black Marlin toured the 1965 auto shows along with attractive young women in sailors' outfits. It was finished in black with \\"a sleek and stylish interior.\\" * The Tahiti luxury version toured the shows in 1966, starting with the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. It was finished in a brilliant fireflake blue with \\"bright South Seas floral upholstery\\", and matching throw pillows. * The Marlin II was design experiment in 1965 to manufacture of a first-generation Marlin with the front end of the Ambassador. Advance product reports by Popular Mechanics indicated that the existing Marlin would remain, but a longer, Ambassador-wheelbase version would be added for the 1966 model year. Popular Science also noted that AMC was working on a larger fastback, as well as a 106 compact, Tarpon-like fastback model. The Marlin II essentially foretold the switch to the longer wheelbase platform that occurred later for the 1967 model year. The actual Marlin II design car was used by Richard Teague, and was sold in 1967. * George Barris customized a 1966 Rambler Marlin for Rader, a wheel manufacturer, to use for promotion. The car was repainted Candy Red with powdered gold leaf in the clear coat, and had Rader wheels with \\"thick wall\\" tires, a reworked mesh grille with four rectangular Cibié headlamps, and Black Pearl Naugahyde on the trunk. Later Barris worked with AMC to produce dealer-installed customizing kits for the AMX. * The roof was cut off a 1966 Marlin for the Florida Marlins, a professional baseball team based in Miami Gardens, Florida. With no seats except for the driver, the car was used in parades and on-field ceremonies at Pro Player Stadium and transported the team's mascot \\"Billy the Marlin\\" for the fans to see during the ball club's 1997 world championship season.  Legacy  = New market segments = In spite of there being \\"many who welcomed the new breed of mid-size fastbacks as a breath of fresh air\\", the intermediate-size fastback car was not a big hit in the marketplace. However, According to Consumer Reports, these cars defied \\"the usual guidelines to size and price class, and they cannot be measured against any standard\\". The Marlin had low sales overall but generated publicity and excitement, attracting potential customers to AMC dealers not only for it but other models. It also added a positive contribution margin to the company's sales, with first-year sales helping generate a profit of US$5.2 million (US$ in dollars) for AMC in fiscal 1965, despite a three-week strike by the United Auto Workers. The mid- sixties automobile market in the U.S. was marked an increasing influence of younger buyers who wanted a sporty image. Most of the \\"sportiness\\" of these was due to effective marketing. No longer satisfied with \\"standard\\" cars the market moved into new segments that included pony cars, muscle cars, and personal luxury cars. Many were heavily restyled derivatives of volume models and shared common parts. Moreover, they were image builders and big profit generators for their automakers. The objective of the Marlin was to move AMC in this direction. However, the AMC \\"had an established image as an expert in the small-car field\\", and thus faced problems in marketing the Marlin as a sporty big car.Gunnell, p. 112. Moreover, \\"the Marlin actually represented a double leap\\" for AMC: into performance, as well as personalization. The model had a good start, but sales quickly bottomed out in the 1967 model year. The automaker's anti-racing philosophy turned around after $40 million (US$ in dollars) was spent to develop a new V8 engine family and AMC turned to \\"competitive events as a means of knocking down its avidly gathered reputation for economy.\\" Although the Marlin was discontinued in 1967, it paved the way for a successful replacement—the compact 1968 AMC Javelin. Therefore, the Marlin's introduction in 1965 can be viewed as stopgap marketing move by AMC, influenced by the company's lack of a V8 engine at that time to fit the compact Rambler chassis. As a mid-sized car, the Marlin was not a dashing, affordable pony car, and after three years of production, it would \\"step aside in favor of another two-door: the hip, new Javelin.\\" = In 2002 Romney campaign = The Marlin was the subject of political controversy in Republican candidate Mitt Romney's 2002 Massachusetts gubernatorial election campaign. In a television advertisement Romney and his wife Ann tenderly describe their first date and falling in love. Mrs. Romney recalls her husband pulling up in \\"some goofy-looking car\\" and running out of gas on the way home. Romney describes being embarrassed by the fact that in high school he drove a car that he says was \\"kinda awful.\\" What Romney did not say in the ads was that the car was a brand new Marlin, from the company that was headed by his father, George W. Romney, from 1954 to 1962. The rival Shannon O'Brien campaign responded that Romney \\"actually drove a cool car\\"—a \\"personal luxury car\\" according to AutoWeek magazine. The press release by the Democratic ticket chided: \\"...the fact that Mitt Romney was embarrassed by his brand new car shows just how out of touch with regular working people he is.\\" = Crossfire similarity= Crossfire's roof, rear fenders, and rear end design resembled the Marlin's Some of the main design components of the Marlin's design returned in 2004 with the Chrysler Crossfire fastback coupé. The rear- wheel drive, two-seat sports car was developed when Chrysler was merged with German automaker Daimler-Benz (forming DaimlerChrysler) and shared most of its components with the Mercedes-Benz SLK320. The original concept car was styled by Eric Stoddard, the car was further refined by Andrew Dyson and built by the German coachbuilder Karmann. Both the Marlin and Crossfire became \\"known more for their rear view than their front styling.\\" The new coupé displayed a fastback roofline with broad rear fenders, a rear end treatment that prompted many automotive journalists to comment on the Crossfire's resemblance to the AMC Marlin. Examples include automotive journalist Rob Rothwell, who wrote \\"...when I first espied the rear lines of the Chrysler Crossfire I was instantly transported back to 1965 and my favorite car of that year, the Rambler Marlin.\\" Automotive editor to The Detroit News described the \\"distinctive boat-tail rear end that reminds more than one observer of the old Rambler Marlin.\\" Motor Trend also compared the \\"provocative boattail theme\\" of the 2004 Crossfire's sheetmetal to that of the AMC Marlin. Even the handling characteristics of the Crossfire were compared by one British journalist to \\"a detuned 1967 AMC Marlin with locked-solid suspension.\\"  Collectibility  1965–1966 Marlins at a Marlin Auto Club meet in Kenosha, Wisconsin A few of the 1967 Marlins attending a Marlin Auto Club show The distinctive Marlin has found a niche among old car hobbyists and collectors of historic vehicles as evidenced by the backing of enthusiasts with a single marque antique auto club. It offers information to those interested in \\"these uncommon and fascinating cars.\\" Although a relatively low-production model, the Marlin is a derivative of AMC's higher-volume models so it shares many common parts. Vehicles in various stages of appearance and mechanical condition can be found for sale. Plusses for collectors of the 1965 model include decent performance with optional drivetrains, historical oddity, plush, bucket-seat interior, and its still low prices; while the Marlin's \\"distinctive\\" styling, rust issues, and slow appreciation in value are minuses. The Marlin's low production numbers also means that there \\"will never have too many other Marlin owners to rub elbows with.\\" There are also many active local and national (U.S. and other nations) Rambler and AMC car clubs that welcome Marlins. = Scale models = A highly detailed Marlin promotional 1/25-scale model was manufactured under license from AMC by Jo-Han for the 1965 and 1966 model years. The only differences are their grilles and removal of the Rambler name on the 1966s. A friction model was also available from Jo-Han in 1966. Although available in a variety of single and two-tone color combinations, many of these \\"dealer promos\\" were done in aqua/dark blue two-tone plastic. Unwanted by AMC dealers as the 1966 model year neared its end, thousands of the models were given away to institutions such as children's hospitals and orphan's homes. They are now highly desirable and they command premium prices. Their value can be upwards of $200 to 400 for mint, in-the-box specimens that still have the hood ornament. Jo-Han also produced 1/25-scale plastic kits of the 1966 Marlin, (Jo-Han C1900) and reissued it in the mid-1970s in the \\"U.S.A. Oldies\\" series (Jo-Han C-3666). They are based on the promotional models, but are less valuable today. According to Steve Magnante of Hot Rod magazine, Jo-Han appears to be poised for a comeback with its most famous unassembled model kits favoring offbeat subjects, \\"but save up-this stuff is pricey.\\" Two types of die-cast toy models were sold under the Corgi Toy brand and manufactured by Mettoy Playcraft in the UK during the late 1960s. Both were done in 1:48 scale. One was a two-tone red and black Marlin with opening doors and a tow hook. The \\"Rambler Marlin Sports Fastback\\" (Corgi 263) scale model was released in 1966 and withdrawn from the market in 1969. In addition to the two-tone paint with chrome bumpers and grille, the model features a detailed interior finished in white and the front seat backs can be tipped forward (as in the actual cars). The second was a gift boxed set (Corgi GS10) with the Marlin finished in blue with a white roof and featuring a roof rack for a kayak, as well as towing a matching utility trailer with opening hatches. Released in 1968, this set had a short run of just 11 months.  Interchange  Customized 1966 Marlin with 327 V8 The following is a digest of a section in \\"The Marlin Handbook - 2004\\" prepared by the Marlin Auto Club. = First generation = Front fenders, hood, as well as front and rear bumpers are interchangeable with the 1965 and 1966 Classic. The rear bumper from 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors will interchange, as well as the dashboard, seats, and other inside trim pieces. Windshields and the doors with their side glass are interchangeable with all two-door Classic and Ambassador models. Drive train, front and rear suspension, brakes, radiators, master cylinders, trunnions, steering columns, power steering pumps, engines, transmissions, brake drums and rotors are interchangeable with 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors and Classics. Some parts are even interchangeable back to 1958 and earlier, while other components were used by AMC into the 1970s. The I6 was used through the late-1970s. This engine was stroked and became the that was used into the 1990s in Jeeps. Many engine components are shared. This engine was also upgraded into Jeep's 4-liter workhorse. It is possible to transplant this high-output fuel-injected engine into a Marlin. (See: AMC Straight-6 engine) The and V8s started out in 1956 and 1957 and were used in large Ramblers, Classics, and Ambassadors through 1966. The AMC 327 engine continued to be used in Jeep and marine applications into the mid-1970s. (See: AMC V8 engine) = Second generation = Front fenders, hood, front bumper, are interchangeable with all 1967 Ambassadors. Windshields as well as doors and their glass from all two-door Ambassadors and Rebels are also interchangeable. The 1967 Marlin similarly shares most major mechanical components with 1967 and up \\"senior\\" (Ambassador, Rebel, and Matador) models. The front suspension design was changed in 1970; however, brake components are interchangeable with later models. Mechanically, the track width for 1967, as well as 1968, was . Starting in 1969 this was increased to an even . In spite of the track width increase, the rear axle uses the same mounting points and spring locations. Therefore, complete rear-end assemblies from later models \\"bolt in\\" with some minor exceptions such as the different drive shaft rear universal joint sizes compared to those used in 1967. Starting with the 1967 model year, completely new \\"GEN-II\\" V8 engines were used in all AMC vehicles. In 1968, the high- performance V8 was added. Then in 1970 and 1971 the 290 became the , the 343 became the , while the 390 became a . Many of the V8 parts are interchangeable with the 290 and 343. All \\"GEN-II\\" engines fit into the second generation Marlin. American Motors' V8 engines were used through 1991 in the full-size SJ Jeep Wagoneer.

A masked detective, he was created by writer-artist Jack Cole for Quality Comics during the 1930s to 1940s period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. A female supervillain alien version of Midnight appeared in the fifth season of Supergirl portrayed by actress Jennifer Cheon Garcia. Publication history With writer-artist Will Eisner retaining rights to the masked-detective character the Spirit, Quality Comics publisher \\"Busy\\" Arnold, who published the comic-book version of this newspaper character, desired a hedge in case Eisner were killed or incapacitated during World War II. Arnold directed Jack Cole to create a similar character, which became Midnight.Midnight at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on February 19, 2016. Midnight debut in Smash Comics #18 (cover-dated Jan. 1941). The character became popular enough to become the cover feature with Smash Comics #28 (Nov. 1941), a position he would hold for nearly eight years until the title's cancellation with issue #85 (Oct. 1949). Fictional character biography =Dave Clark= Dave Clark is a radio announcer in Big City. He is an actor in a show named \\"The Man Called Midnight\\", about a masked crime fighter. After witnessing the collapse of a twelve-story building, he finds out that it had collapsed as a result of deliberate criminal negligence on the part of its builder, Morris Carleton. Clark decides to fight Carleton and force him to admit responsibility. To do this, he puts on a domino mask and assumes the identity of Midnight himself. After succeeding, he chooses to continue to fight crime as \\"Midnight, the eerie friend of the needy\\". In Smash Comics #21, Midnight encounters the intelligent talking monkey Gabby. By the end of the story, the death of the scientist responsible leaves Gabby in Midnight's care, and the monkey becomes Midnight's sidekick. In Smash Comics #23, Midnight and Gabby face off against mad scientist Doc Wackey who, once captured, is talked into reforming and joins forces with Midnight. Doc Wackey and Gabby would continue to serve as Midnight's sidekicks (and often comic relief) for the remainder of Midnight's run on the title. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, Midnight \\"fights ordinary gangsters, the magician Chango (whose spells are in Pig Latin), the femme fatale Circle, the maniacal Laughing Killer, the Men from Mars, the Amazonian Robustia, and others\\". Midnight was killed in Smash Comics #36, where he went to Hell at his own request so that he could attempt to fight the Devil himself. Midnight was resurrected at the end of the chapter thanks to a mad scientist. Eventually two more colorful characters joined the gang, inept private detective Sniffer Snoop and his pet Hotfoot, a baby polar bear. Like the other Quality characters, Midnight was bought by DC Comics after Quality Comics folded in 1956, but has not been extensively used. Like most other Golden Age heroes, he made an appearance in Roy Thomas' All-Star Squadron, which Thomas used to feature every Golden Age character owned by DC. He also worked with the Freedom Fighters for some time. In his sole post-Crisis appearance, a revised version of Midnight's origin written by Thomas and drawn by Gil Kane was published in Secret Origins #28. His base of operations was retconned into New York City. Midnight has not appeared since, and nothing is known of his fate after the 1940s. =Midnight II= A new Midnight was introduced in the 1990s in Ms. Tree Quarterly, but whether this Midnight has any connection to the original is unknown. Other versions *In the Elseworlds miniseries JLA: Destiny, by John Arcudi and Tom Mandrake, a version of Midnight exists in a world where Superman and Batman do not exist. This version of Midnight, named William Cole, is a former detective with the Gotham City Police Department and a senior member of Thomas Wayne's Justice League of America, formerly the Justice League of Gotham, as Midnight. In other media A female version of the character appeared in the fifth season of Supergirl portrayed by Jennifer Cheon Garcia. This version is a villain with vortex-based abilities and was imprisoned in the Phantom Zone. Ma'alefa'ak steals Kryptonian technology from a museum and uses it to free Midnight from the Phantom Zone. In her first encounter with Supergirl, Alex Danvers, Brainiac 5, and Martian Manhunter, Supergirl suspected that she will come after her because her mother Alura sent different villains to the Phantom Zone only for Martian Manhunter to admit that he was the one who banished her to the Phantom Zone for leading a White Martian attack. When Midnight attacks an evening party held by Lena Luthor, Kara uses her new suit created by Brainiac 5 to stop a black hole caused by Midnight. Afterwards, Midnight is sent back into the Phantom Zone using a Phantom Zone projector. External links * Midnight by Jack Cole from Smash Comics #32 Originally Copyrighted 1942 E.M.

He was a promoter and race car owner.  Early life  Agajanian was born in San Pedro, Los Angeles, California, just six months after his father had immigrated to the United States, with his entire family, including some cousins, out of war-torn Armenia. He grew up a hard-working young man in the family's refuse collection and hog ranching businesses, which Aggie would later oversee. At 18, Agajanian had saved enough money to buy a race car. When he told his father that he was going to become a race car driver, the elder Agajanian's reaction was not what young Aggie had hoped. Looking at the car in the garage, his father said to J.C., \\"So, you are going to be a race driver, that's fine. Just a few things I want you to do first. Go kiss your mother goodbye, pack your bags since you won't be living here anymore and while you're at it, change your name.\\"  Promoting and racing life  The racing game was brutal in the 1930s. Drivers were dying almost every other week on the dirt ovals of Southern California and Agajanian's father understandably did not want his son to become another statistic. A compromise was settled upon: J.C. could keep the car, but only in the capacity of an owner. J.C. agreed and at 18 became perhaps one of the youngest car owners in automobile racing. While Agajanian never achieved his childhood dream of becoming a race driver, he did almost everything else, from promoting races to building cars and discovering drivers. While promoting a race under the blazing desert sun in Arizona, Agajanian purchased a Stetson cowboy hat to protect his head, and thereafter he was rarely seen without one. His trademarks were his Stetson hat and high-heeled boots made especially for him in Spain. He was the Armenian heir to a fortune built on pig farming and garbage collection. J.C. was partial to the number \\"98\\" and used the number on his Indianapolis, Sprint and Midget cars, a tradition which has continued for generations in the family, including four Indianapolis 500 wins, including the ownership by J.C. in 1952 with driver Troy Ruttman and 1963 with driver Parnelli Jones and co-ownership by son Cary and business partner Mike Curb with Bryan Herta Autosports in 2011 with driver Dan Wheldon and 2016 with driver Alexander Rossi. He was instrumental in the development of the air jack for faster tire changes at Indianapolis and in the 1930s was president of the Western Racing Association. His race organizer expertise spanned the country and he became the first race organizer to present 250 United States Automobile Club events, ranging from Midget races like the traditional Turkey Night Grand Prix at various Southern California race tracks, still promoted by the family to this day, to numerous Championship Dirt Car races at state fairground tracks. From 1948 through 1971, his cars won three pole positions – the first with Walt Faulkner in 1950 – for the Indianapolis 500, set four track records and won the race twice. Troy Ruttman (1952) and Parnelli Jones (1963) both won the 500 in Agajanian machines. Agajanian also gained fame for a moment of quick thinking that may have saved victory for Parnelli Jones at Indianapolis in 1963. With the race in its waning stages and Scotsman Jim Clark closing on Jones, it became apparent that the Agajanian Willard Battery Special had developed a serious oil leak (something that USAC starter Harlan Fengler had specifically warned teams about in pre-race meetings). When Eddie Sachs crashed – allegedly in oil laid down by Jones' number 98 – Agajanian rushed up to the starter and argued that the leak was stopped, because it had dropped below the level of the crack. By this time, Lotus team owner Colin Chapman had joined the confrontation, demanding that Fengler back up his threat to disqualify cars leaking oil. By the time Jones came around again, the argument was settled. Agajanian's car stayed in the lead, and held it to the end. Chapman and the Lotus engine builder Ford were furious over the result which remains controversial to this day, although they declined to protest as Jones' car (nicknamed \\"Calhoun\\") had been the fastest in the race. Many experts believe that USAC officials were biased against Clark and the rear engine Lotus, and that had it been an American driving a roadster in second place at the time Jones would have been black flagged. He died on May 5, 1984 in Gardena, California. Family & Legacy When he died, J.C. left behind his wife, Hazel Faye Agajanian, their four children, Joan Agajanian Quinn(John J), JC Agajanian Jr.(Franci), Cary Agajanian (Judy), Christopher James Agajanian (Laura), 11 grandchildren, his youngest sister Jacqueline Agajanian Cardelucci, and his NFL star brother Ben Agajanian. Cary Agajanan is an attorney and partner at Agajanian, McFall, Weiss, Tetreault, & Crist LLP in the Los Angeles area who is also a co-owner of the motorsport operations of J.C.'s team, now known as Curb-Agajanian Performance Group with legendary musician and fellow Californian Mike Curb. The CAPG won the Indianapolis 500 as co-entrants, in 2011 and 2016 with Bryan Herta Autosport. J.C. Agajanian Jr., is an actor and comedian who shares his primary interests in motorsports with his father and brother, hosting the USAC Turkey Night Grand Prix on a number of occasions. His daughter, recipient of the 2017 Ellis Island Medal of Honor, and NGO representative for the United Nations, Joan Agajanian Quinn, is a Curator, Producer, and Journalist (for many publications including former West Coast editor for Andy Warhol's Interview magazine, Society editor for Hearst's Herald Examiner). As an Arts Advocate she was a 17 year board member on the California Arts Council & both the Beverly Hills Arts & Architectural Commissions, among others. Quinn currently Hosts Beverly Hills View & Joan Quinn Profiles TV shows. Ben Agajanian died in 2018 at age 98. Cary Agajanian notes on the law firm's Web site, '\\"As legal counsel for the Long Beach Grand Prix and Toyota, U.S.A. in the precedent setting case of Regazzoni vs. Long Beach Grand Prix, Cary convinced the Federal District Court to dismiss all claims asserted by the famed Formula One driver who was paralyzed during practice at the event based upon the waiver and release and express assumption of the risk agreement signed by the driver prior to participation. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals later upheld the case, and the well-publicized ruling marked a significant victory for the sports and leisure fields, setting the tone for future similar litigation.\\" \\"I didn't even know my dad was bald until I was a teenager,\\" joked his son, Cary. \\"He even wore the hat sitting down for breakfast in the morning. My mother was always getting on him about that.\\" Notable drivers for JC Agajanian included Al Unser, Bill Vukovich II, Walt Faulkner, Troy Ruttman and Parnelli Jones.

He was a police officer who rose to General Director of the General Directorate of Security (effectively national police chief), serving from 1993 to 1995, before entering parliament and serving as a government minister in 1996. After being sentenced to several years in prison for criminal activities relating to the Susurluk scandal, he was released on probation in April 2013. Background and personal life Mehmet Ağar was born on October 30, 1951 at the state president's official residence Çankaya Köşkü in Ankara, where his father was serving as security. During his youth, he toured several places across the country due to his father's position as police chief. He began his high school education in Ankara, continued in Haydarpaşa High School in Istanbul finishing in 1968. He studied finance in the School of Political Science at the University of Ankara on scholarship from the Turkish General Directorate of Security. Graduated in 1972, Mehmet Ağar became a police officer. Mehmet Ağar, married in 1974 Emel Ağar. The couple has a son Tolga and a daughter Yasemin. Career He later served as a police inspector in the security force for the state president. In 1976, Ağar was appointed vice district governor in İznik and Selçuk. He later became district governor in Torul and Delice. In 1980, he was assigned assistant director to the counter-terrorism section of Istanbul Police. The next year, he was promoted to director of security in Istanbul. At the same time, he became chief of the Counter-Guerrilla, a clandestine stay-behind anti- communist initiative backed by NATO and the United States. Mehmet Ağar served between 1984-1988 as the vice police chief of Istanbul for the General Directorate of Security (Turkish National Police). Ağar featured in Mehmet Eymür's controversial 1987 MIT Report that targeted former high ranking civil servants and politicians such as Ağar, Nevzat Ayaz and Ünal Erkan. In 1988, he became police chief of Ankara and in 1990 Istanbul Chief of Police. Following a brief service as governor of the police province of Erzurum between 1992–1993, he was appointed in July 1993 director general of the General Directorate of Security - in effect the national police chief. Under his leadership the Police Special Forces (Özel Harekat Dairesi) within the General Directorate of Security was run by İbrahim Şahin; Ağar supported its co- operation with the Gendarmerie against the Kurdistan Workers' Party PKK in rural areas. He resigned from the police after entering parliament in 1995.  Political career  Mehmet Ağar entered politics as deputy of Elazığ from the True Path Party (DYP) following the general elections 1995. Mehmet Ağar was appointed the Minister of Justice in 1996. He served later in the next government's coalition cabinet as the Minister of the Interior. He resigned from this post on November 8, 1996 protesting Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan's official visit to Libya. At the 1999 general elections, Ağar run for a seat in the parliament as independent deputy from Elazığ, and received the highest number of votes an independent candidate ever achieved. The True Path Party (DYP) lost the 2002 parliamentary elections and Tansu Çiller resigned as leader of the party and retired from politics. Mehmet Ağar was the only representative of the party elected in the 2002 election from Elazığ and entered the Turkish Grand National Assembly. After Çiller's resignation, Ağar was elected as the new president of the True Path Party. On May 5, 2007 it was announced that DYP and the Motherland Party (ANAP) would merge to form the Democratic Party (Demokrat Parti). For that occasion, DYP renamed itself (based on the previous party of the same name), and it was planned that ANAP would join the newly founded DP. Mehmet Agar resigned from his position as the leader of DP following the 22 July 2007 election.  Susurluk scandal  With the Susurluk scandal of 1996, his political career ended for some time when it turned out he had stayed in a hotel with the victims of the Susurluk car crash immediately before the incident. He famously said \\"I will talk if the state wants me to\\" to a commission investigating the affair. He escaped justice at the time due to his parliamentary immunity, however, he was retried starting on February 9, 2009 at the Ankara 11th High Criminal Court. If he refuses to attend his hearing, he will be escorted by the police. The Susurluk report contained the following information: (contains the Susurluk reports in English) *On 19 October 1984, when he was İstanbul Deputy Chief of Police, he held a meeting with ultra-nationalist activist Celal Adan. *On 3 July 3, 1985, while serving as Public Order Branch Director at İstanbul Police HQ, he contacted owners of a company, İbrahim Aslan and Mahmut Şahin, who were followers of the Süleymancı sect, and gave them the files and other information about the investigation carried out against members of the Süleymancı sect, which should have been kept secret. *On September 4, 1986, ultra-nationalist activist Selim Kaptanoğlu declared that \\"they had been engaged in collecting of checks and vouchers; they had collected money from the Mafia bosses in the name of Alparslan Türkeş; they had given part of this money to Alpaslan Türkeş and another part to the ultra-nationalist activists in the prisons; and while doing this they had been in close contact to the Deputy Chief of Police, Mehmet Ağar.\\" *It was determined that on December 5, 1990 he took a bribe from Kemal Kaçar of the Süleymancı sect. *He pushed for ultra-nationalists candidates to be chosen to the Police Academy in the examinations of the Academy held on September 29, 1993. *He was elected Member of the Parliament from Elazığ for True Path Party (DYP) in the general elections held on December 24, 1995. *Ağar was assigned the post of Minister of Justice in the cabinet of the 53rd Government, the coalition government of Motherland Party (ANAP) and DYP in 1996. He became Minister of the Interior in the 54th Government, the coalition government of Welfare Party (RP) and DYP formed in the same year; and he resigned on November 8, 1996. =Trial= On September 15, 2011, he was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in the Susurluk scandal as the leader of a criminal organization.

Construction and layout  Built for David Theomin in the Jacobean style to plans prepared by the London architect Sir Ernest George, (1839-1922) the house was fitted with all the latest conveniences: central heating, an internal telephone system, a service lift, a food mixer, and an electric toaster, for example. It has 35 rooms, with a total floor area of 1276 m². Theomin had acquired land on the site in 1881 when there was an existing villa. By 1901 he had bought an adjacent property and in 1904 acquired another. The existing buildings were then removed. The family was in London in 1903 and working drawings from Ernest George & Yeates are dated October 1903.Blackman, 2007 pp.8,13,17. The building is brick rendered in Moeraki gravel, with Oamaru stone facings and is roofed with Marseilles tiles. The main entrance and some principal rooms face east. A galleried hall rises through the ground and upper floors and served as a ball room. An elevated internal balcony was an eyrie from which to watch the dancing below. The youthful Miss Theomin's personal suite with its own sitting room is delicate and charming. The outlook is principally to the garden and the Town Belt bush providing attractive views and belying the proximity of the central city. The quality of the materials and the standard of the craftsmanship are high. The supervising architects were the Dunedin firm of Mason & Wales and the builder was Robert Meikle.Blackman, 2007, p.18. Olveston is not an Arts and Crafts house though something of that aesthetic is apparent. While over-furnished by later standards a lot of the contents are interesting and some are outstanding. The British architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner visited Olveston in August 1958 and described it as \\"an extremely interesting and very grand house\\". He also noted that Ernest George was one of five or six pre- eminent English architects at the time of its commission.Blackman, 2007, p.71.

He was born in Bristol, England, emigrating to Melbourne, Australia in 1874. Theomin married Marie Michaelis of Melbourne (1855-1926) in Melbourne in January 1879. In 1881 Theomin and his wife moved to Dunedin. By marriage Theomin was related to the extended Hallenstein, Fels, de Beer and Brasch families of Dunedin, patrons of the arts and learning. Charles Brasch, a New Zealand poet and editor, said of his kinsman, 'he was a jolly bouncy little man who liked a bit of swank perhaps but was kindly and quite without side'.Brasch, 1980 p.110. Theomin's fortune came substantially from importing pianos which he distributed through a New Zealand-wide chain of shops, called The Dresden, and later The Bristol Piano Company. He and his daughter Dorothy were patrons especially of music and the visual arts. The Theomins collected art, ceramics and furniture. They acquired significant Japanese material and works by W.M. Hodgkins, Frances Hodgkins, Alfred Henry O'Keeffe and Frank Brangwyn among others. The house and its contents were bequeathed to the city in 1966 by David Theomin's daughter Dorothy Theomin (1888-1966).Blackman, 2007, pp.7&72. It was opened to the public the following year, and has between 30,000 and 40,000 visitors annually. Its architectural distinction, its collections and the record it represents of a sumptuous life in Edwardian New Zealand lend it a special interest. A protected tree on the grounds fell without warning on 8 February 2009, apparently due to root failure, crushing the car of a senior guide parked outside. Notes References * Blackman, M.

He is best known for his crucial role in founding the theme park Efteling. Peter Reijnders was born in 1900 in 's-Hertogenbosch as the son of a coffee- and tobacco trader family. After making a film in 1927 about his own marriage with Helena Perquin, he devoted himself to photography and films. He also invented many small novelties that are popular with Philips Electronics. He made a number of films in the period 1927-1954, some of which gained national prizes.  Efteling  At a family gathering in 1951, Reijnders was asked by his father-in-law, mayor Van der Heijden, to investigate the possibilities for making the just-established Efteling Naturepark more attractive. Inspired by a temporary fairy tale exhibition in Eindhoven, Reijnders knew whom to ask for the design: painter Anton Pieck. Reijnders and Pieck were pivotal for the original Fairy Tale Forest, the foundation of the current Efteling themepark. Reijnders was responsible for the many creative and revolutionary technological innovations. With his wires, motors, balloons and water he made the fairy tales come to life, without ever exposing the technology to the visitor. His last visit to Efteling was in 1972, when the park received the Pomme d'Or, the highest award in the European tourist industry.

The stadium is UEFA approved, able to compete in either UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League, and is home of the Azorean regional football team. The Portuguese national team has also used the Stadium to play friendly matches (the last being a 2–0 win over Egypt, to a sold-out crowd).

It is used mostly for football matches, and is the home stadium of Varzim Sport Clube. Able to hold 7,000 people, it was built in 1929. New stadium  Varzim has its own old stadium, at Lagoa Beach, close to other sports equipment in the north area of the town. In 1999, the municipality approved construction rights for the terrain where it lies, and due to real estate speculation, it now has a huge value, between €20 and €29 million. For years, a new stadium was under debate, but a financial crisis made it urgent. Just by signing the contract-promise for selling the terrain, the club could have its debts paid and still have enough for a new stadium on another location. The new stadium would be next to the city park, where already a municipal stadium and training fields existed. Initially, it was the board's intention to adapt the existing stadium at the city park to be able for professional football venues (increasing capacity and improving its facilities), thus having it serve the needs of both Varzim and the municipality. Mayor Macedo Vieira, however, stated that the existing stadium was not to be used by Varzim because it was not built with this purpose. The political opposition argued against this decision, stating that the use of the municipal stadium would prevent Varzim from having to buy terrain and build a new stadium from scratch, thus reducing the amount of construction to be allowed on the old stadium location, because its terrain could then be sold for much less. The club was, therefore, forced to build a new stadium. The contract-promise was signed with a Portuguese-Spanish group in late 2006, with construction was expected to begin in 2009, but later postponed due to the international financial crisis.

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops describes devotions as \\"expressions of love and fidelity that arise from the intersection of one's own faith, culture and the Gospel of Jesus Christ\\". Devotions are not considered part of liturgical worship, even if they are performed in a church or led by a priest, but rather they are paraliturgical. The Congregation for Divine Worship at the Vatican publishes a Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy.Congregation for Divine Worship, Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy, Vatican City, December 2001. Catholic devotions have various forms, ranging from formalized, multi-day prayers such as novenas to activities which do not involve any prayers, such as Eucharistic adoration outside Mass, the wearing of scapulars, the veneration of the saints, the Canonical coronations of sacred Marian or Christological images and even horticultural practices such as maintaining a Mary garden. Common examples of Catholic devotions include the Rosary, the Stations of the Cross, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Holy Face of Jesus, the various scapulars, the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Seven Sorrows of Mary, novenas to various saints, pilgrimages, devotions to the Blessed Sacrament, and the veneration of saintly images.  Background  While the Catholic Church considers liturgy to be central to the life and mission of the Church, it acknowledges the benefit of popular devotions, stating in Sacrosanctum Concilium that \\"The spiritual life, however, is not limited solely to participation in the liturgy... Popular devotions of the Christian people are to be highly commended, provided they accord with the laws and norms of the Church, above all when they are ordered by the Apostolic See... These devotions should be so drawn up that they harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them.\\"Sacrosanctum Concilium, 13, Vatican City, December 4, 1963 Several factors shape the efficacy of devotional practices in eliciting feelings of devotion: a strong emotional appeal, a simplicity of form which puts them within the reach of all, the association with many others engaged in the same practices, and their derivation from the example of others considered to lead a holy life. Since the Middle Ages, popes have encouraged devotions such as Eucharistic Adoration, the Rosary and the Stations of the Cross, while maintaining the primacy of liturgy over private devotions.Vatican Directory of Devotions item 11. Pious devotions have influenced some important parts of the Catholic calendar such as the feast of Corpus Christi which arose after petitions by those following the devotion; or various Marian feasts that gradually appeared with the growth of devotions.Rev Neil J. Roy, in Encyclopedia of Catholic Devotions and Practices by Ann Ball, 2003 pages 1-16 Catholic devotions can form the basis of major community events, such as the statue of our Our Lady of Zapopan, which attracts over one million pilgrims on October 12 each year as the statue travels through the streets moving from one cathedral to another.Rowe, William. Images of power: iconography, culture and state in Latin America, p. 271, Fodor's Mexico 1996 page 242 In Catholic tradition, a wide range of practices have developed, ranging from devotions to the Holy Trinity to specific saints. The three-level hierarchy of latria, hyperdulia and dulia determines the appropriate type of worship or veneration for different situations.Summa Theologiae: Volume 41, Virtues of Justice in the Human Community by Thomas Aquinas and T. C. O'Brien 2006 pages 40-45Summa Theologica, Volume 3 by Thomas Aquinas 2007 page1633 Latria (from the Greek λατρεία, latreia) is used for worship, adoration and reverence directed only to the Holy Trinity. Dulia (from the Greek δουλεία, douleia) is the kind of honor given to the communion of saints, while the Blessed Virgin Mary is honored with hyperdulia, a higher form of dulia but lower than latria. Various unapproved acts such as the promotion of chain letters that contain prayers or the belief that the use of a statue of Saint Joseph can speed up the sale of a house have been discouraged as non-pious, superstitious and against Catholic values. In general, acts and beliefs that aim at the manipulation of divine power for specific gainful purposes are always condemned as contrary to Catholic devotional practices.  Devotions to the Holy Trinity  The Feast of the Holy Trinity is a devotional day celebrated on the first Sunday after Pentecost and honors the three Persons of God: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.Trawicky, Bernard and Gregory, Ruth Wilhelme. Anniversaries and holidays, p. 225, 2000, The Novena to the Holy Trinity may include the Glory Be prayer, as well as other prayers, although the other prayers may vary. According to the Fátima seer Lúcia Santos, in late September or October 1916, the Angel of Peace appeared for the third time to herself and the other visionaries, her cousins Francísco and Jacinta Marto, and taught them a prayer of reparation to the Holy Trinity. The Pentecost Novena to the Holy Spirit is traditionally prayed especially during the nine days between Ascension Thursday and Pentecost.Sis, Michael. \\"Pentecost Novena\\", The Roman Catholic Diocese of San Angelo The practice of novenas derives from the nine days spent in prayer by the Apostles and Disciples together with Mary from the Ascension until the Descent of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost. This is considered to have been the first novena.\\"Preparing for Pentecost: Novena to the Holy Spirit\\", Capuchin Franciscans, Province of Ireland There are a number of ways to pray the Pentecost Novena. One might pray the Evening Prayer from the Liturgy of the Hours each day, the \\"Come, Holy Spirit\\" or other prayers. It is generally prayed for an increase of the Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. Another pious practice is \\"St. Andrew's Christmas Novena\\". It is not prayed to St. Andrew, but commences on his feast day, November 30 and continues until Christmas. \\"Hail and blessed be the hour and moment in which the Son of God was born Of the most pure Virgin Mary, at midnight, in Bethlehem, in the piercing cold. In that hour vouchsafe, I beseech Thee, O my God, to hear my prayer and grant my desires through the merits of Our Savior Jesus Christ, and of His blessed Mother. Amen.\\"\\"St. Andrew's Christmas Novena\\", Dominican Nuns of Summit, New Jersey  Devotions to Jesus  Several widespread devotions in the Catholic tradition relate directly to Jesus. Official Catholic teachings consider Eucharistic adoration an important practice which \\"stimulates the faithful to an awareness of the marvelous presence of Christ and is an invitation to spiritual communion with Him.\\" In many cases Eucharistic adoration is performed by each person for an uninterrupted hour known as the Holy Hour.Christopher, Joseph P. Raccolta, 2003, pages 107-108 The inspiration for the Holy Hour is when in the Garden of Gethsemane the night before his crucifixion, Jesus asks Peter: \\"So, could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?\\". Some devotions have the form of Acts of Reparation to Jesus Christ for the sufferings and insults that Jesus endured during His Passion or for the sin of blasphemy, e.g. the Golden Arrow Prayer. Devotions involving the Sacred Heart of Jesus first appeared in the eleventh and twelfth centuries, but most current devotions are attributed to Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque (1647–1690) and was later encouraged by Pope Pius XI in Miserentissimus Redemptor. The devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus dates back to Sister Marie of St Peter in 1843 who reported visions of Jesus and Mary in which she was urged to spread the devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus in reparation for the many insults Jesus suffered in His Passion, resulting in The Golden Arrow prayer. The devotion was first approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885,Cruz, Joan Carroll. Relics, p.57, (Sep 1984), OSV Press, and further promoted by Sister Maria Pierina de Micheli based on the image from Secondo Pia's photograph of the Shroud of Turin. In 1958, Pope Pius XII approved of the devotion and the Holy Face medal and granted that the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus may be celebrated on Shrove Tuesday throughout the Church.Cruz, Joan Carroll. Saintly Men of Modern Times. (2003) Other devotions include the Divine Mercy based on the visions of Saint Faustina Kowalska,Alan Butler and Paul Burns, 2005, Butler's Lives of the Saints, Burns and Oats page 251 First Friday devotions which are related to devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and the Chaplet of the Five Wounds.  Marian devotions  Marian devotions are prominent within the Catholic tradition. In the Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae, Pope John Paul II said: \\"Since Mary is of all creatures the one most conformed to Jesus Christ, it follows that among all devotions that which most consecrates and conforms a soul to our Lord is devotion to Mary\\". The Catechism of the Catholic Church states: \\"The Church's devotion to the Blessed Virgin is intrinsic to Christian worship.\\" A wide range of Marian devotions are practiced by Catholics. Many forms of devotional expression take place. There has long been an established practice of dedicating the main side altar in Catholic churches, often called a Lady Chapels, to Mary. =Prayers= Jean- François Millet: Angelus The Angelus is a traditional prayer used to commemorate the Incarnation. It consists essentially in the triple repetition of the Hail Mary, to which in later times have been added three introductory versicles and a concluding versicle and prayer. The prayer is that which belongs to the antiphon of Our Lady, \\"Alma Redemptoris\\".Thurston, Herbert. \\"Angelus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 27 April 2020 It is prayed three times daily: at dawn, mid-day and at dusk. The manner of ringing the Angelus—the triple stroke repeated three times, with a pause between each set of three (a total of nine strokes), sometimes followed by a longer peal as at curfew—seems to have been long established.During Eastertide, the Angelus is replaced with the Regina Coeli an antiphon, dating from the tenth or eleventh century. The Rosary, or Psalter of the Blessed Virgin Mary is essentially a contemplative prayer. Family recitation of the rosary is encouraged. In the encyclical Ingruentium malorum, Pope Pius XII said regarding the custom of the family recitation of the Holy Rosary: > \\"...when, at eventide, the Christian home resounds with the frequent > repetition of praises in honor of the High Queen of Heaven...Then the > Rosary, recited in the family,...unites them piously with those absent and > those dead. It links all more tightly in a sweet bond of love, with the most > Holy Virgin, who, like a loving mother, in the circle of her children, will > be there bestowing upon them an abundance of the gifts of concord and family > peace.Pope Pius XII. Ingruentium malorum, §13, 15 September 1951. Libreria > Editrice Vaticana The Litany of Loreto is the most well-known Marian litany. =Liturgical calendar= Many devotions and pious exercises are in some way related to the liturgical feasts of the General Calendar of the Roman Rite or of the particular calendars of dioceses and religious congregations. The month of May Dedication of the month of May to MarySocias, James. Handbook of Prayers, 2006 p. 483 dates from about the seventeenth century.Thurston, Herbert. \\"Devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912] *Pious practices include the erection of a small May altar decorated with May flowers,Storey, William G. A Catholic Book of Hours and Other Devotions, pp. xiii-xi, 2007, a custom that stems from southern European countries. *Parishes and private groups often crown an image of the Blessed Virgin Mary with flowers. This is referred to as a “May Crowning.” This rite may be done on solemnities and feasts of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or other festive days, and offers an opportunity to reflect on Mary's role in the history of salvation.Lewis, Suzaanne M. \\"Crowning an Image of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\", Pastoral Liturgy In some countries, it takes place on or about May 1, however, in many United States Catholic parishes, it frequently takes place on Mother's Day. *A Mary garden is a small garden enclosing a statue or shrine of the Virgin Mary. The practice originated among monasteries and convents in medieval Europe. During the Middle Ages, people saw reminders of Mary in the flowers and herbs growing around them.Krymow, Vincenzina and Frisk, M. Jean. \\"Honoring Mary in Your Garden\\", St. Anthony Messenger \\"Herbs and Flowers of the Virgin Mary\\", Marian Library, University of Dayton The first reference to an actual garden dedicated to Mary is from the life of St. Fiacre, Irish patron saint of gardening, who planted and tended a garden around the oratory to Our Lady he built at his famous hospice for the poor and infirm in France in the 7th Century. More than 30 flowers and herbs are connected to legends about Mary's life. Saturdays Saturdays are dedicated to the Virgin Mary, designated as memorials of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This practice dates from Carolingian times (ninth century). *A Medieval devotion celebrated the three Golden Saturdays which followed the Feast of St. Michael (September 29). The golden Saturdays were observed with reception of the sacraments and festivities, especially at pilgrimage sites.Frisk, M. Jean. \\"Saturday Devotions in Honor of Our Lady\\", Marian Library, University of Dayton * Devotions to the Immaculate Heart of Mary date back to Saint Bernard. The 1830 reported vision of Saint Catherine Labouré which introduced the Miraculous Medal depicting the thorn- crowned Heart of Jesus and the pierced Heart of Mary had a significant impact on the devotion. (Many parishes hold a novena each Monday to Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal.) The practice of Reparation to the Immaculate Heart of Mary on the First Saturday was initiated in Rovigo, Italy by Mary Inglese, a Servite tertiary in 1889. It later developed into the devotion of the Five First Saturdays. =Other Marian devotions= Specific episodes in the Life of the Virgin Mary have resulted in devotions that focus on a particular aspect of her life. Examples include the Seven Sorrows of Mary that recall her sufferings from the Prophecy of Simeon to the Crucifixion of Jesus. The Seven Joys of Mary on the other hand start with the Annunciation and end with her coronation in Heaven. Still others have developed from purported apparitions such as Our Lady of Guadalupe, Our Lady of Lourdes, or Our Lady of Fatima.Notitiae, bulletin of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, 2002, pages 194-195Hermkens, Anna-Karina and Jansen, Willy. Moved by Mary: The Power of Pilgrimage in the Modern World, 2009 p. 217 Various icons, images and statues of the Virgin have been associated with reports of miraculous events such as healings and have resulted in local and national devotions, and the construction of Marian shrines. Examples include the Black Madonna of Częstochowa in Poland, and Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn in Lithuania. Among devotional articles, probably the most common are the scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel,Vauchez, Andre. Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, p. 1314, 2001, Fitzroy Dearborn Press and the \\"Miraculous Medal\\", which dates to 1830. Also Scapular of Our Lady of Good Counsel and the Scapular of the Seven Dolours of Mary Regional devotions continue to generate local support such as festivals and celebrations. The festival of Our Lady of Solitude of Porta Vaga in the Philippines has been celebrated for centuries, and its icon continues to be venerated.Aluit, Alphonso J., The Galleon guide to Philippine festivals, 1969 ASIN B004CWODBO p. 97 Each year around Pentecost, as part of a local Marian devotion, about a million people attend the Romería de El Rocío in Spain.El Rocío, Rough Guide to Spain. Retrieved 2010-04-14. In Los Angeles, California, an old custom of a Marian procession was revived in 2011 to coincide with the anniversary of the founding of the city. Various chivalric, fraternal, and religious orders, parishes, and other religious and civic organizations participate.http://www.thequeenofangels.com/wp-content/media/tidings- online20110906.pdf =Notable Marian devotions= Our Lady of Peñafrancia in Naga City, Philippines Based on apparitions Our Lady of Good Health and Our Lady of Good Help Related to a religious icon or image *Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Our Lady of Aparecida, Virgin of Candelaria, Our Lady of Šiluva, and Our Lady of Solitude, Mary Untier of Knots, and Our Lady of Lebanon Mary Help of Christians is an example of a devotion to Mary under a specific title.  Devotions to saints  Saints may be revered; they are never worshiped. Through their prayers of intercession, the saints in heaven play an integral role in the life of the Church on earth. \\"To honor the Saints is automatically to honor God, the Author of their sanctity.\\"\\"Catholic Devotion To The Saints\\", Dominican Friars in Chicago The Catechism of the Catholic Church (item 957) states: > It is not merely by the title of example that we cherish the memory of those > in heaven; we seek, rather, that by this devotion to the exercise of > fraternal charity the union of the whole Church in the Spirit may be > strengthened. Exactly as Christian communion among our fellow pilgrims > brings us closer to Christ, so our communion with the saints joins us to > Christ. Traditions vary across different cultures. Italians, for example, have a strong devotion to St. Anthony of Padua. The Tredicina refers to a thirteen- day Novena that takes places in preparation for the Feast of Saint Anthony on June 13.\\"Traditional Devotions\\", Basilica of St. Anthony in Padua There are a number of devotional practices in honor of Saint Joseph; these include the Prayer to Saint Joseph and the Novena to Saint Joseph. Saint Joseph's scapular was approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1893. Saint Joseph's Medal is a sacramental introduced in 1971 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Saint Joseph being declared the patron of the universal church. A number of local devotions and customs to Saint Joseph exist around the world, e.g. Alpine regions, Josephstragen (German for carrying Saint Joseph) takes place on the 9 days before Christmas. A statue of Saint Joseph is carried between 9 homes, and on the first day one boy prays to him, on the second day two boys pray, until 9 boys pray the 9th day. The statue is then placed near a manger in the town church on Christmas Eve. Devotions to Saint Michael involve specific prayers and novenas to him, hymns such as Te Splendor as well as the Scapular of St. Michael the Archangel and the Chaplet of Saint Michael. The Prayer to Saint Michael is also a popular prayer, composed by Pope Leo XIII.Raccolta Manual of Indulgences Published by St Athanasius Press, 2003 page 340 Devotions to Saint George are also widely practiced by Catholics, given that he is one of the most popular saints in Christianity.Roy, Christian. Traditional Festivals, p. 408, 2005, These devotions and churches built in his honor date to the 6th century.Trombley, Frank. Hellenic religion and Christianization, p. 345, Published by BRILL, 1994 Many other devotions to saints exist, such as the Novena of Grace addressed to Saint Francis Xavier and the Cord of St. Francis associated with Francis of Assisi.

Plantation specifics The Leon County Florida 1860 Agricultural Census shows that George W. Scott Plantation had the following: * Improved Land: 60 acres (¼ km2) * Unimproved Land: 50 acres (¼ km²) * Cash value of plantation: $4000 * Cash value of farm implements/machinery: $1500 * Cash value of farm animals: $5000 * Number of slaves: N/A * Bushels of corn: N/A * Bales of cotton: N/A The owners Colonel George W. Scott, merchant and farmer, came to Leon in 1852 from Pennsylvania. He was said to have a model farm. Scott fought in the American Civil War as head of \\"Scott's Cavalry\\". In 1868 Scott ran for governor as a Democratic-Conservative but was defeated. Scott experimented in a variety of crops and planted of sugar cane, cabbage, collards, rutabagas, Dutch turnips. Scott also created a 16-foot (5 m) overshot waterwheel from a pond going to corn, sugar and cotton processing. Scott came up with a revolutionary fertilizer which combined cottonseed with bone meal. Bone was obtained by black farm hands who earned a gallon of cane syrup for every 100-pound sack of animal bones. The bone were crushed with a heavy cast-iron stamp powered by a waterwheel and the meal mixed with sulfuric acid. This was then mixed with cottonseed cake to make a final product. In 1870 Scott moved to Savannah, Georgia, then Atlanta, where he built his business. By 1887, the Gossypium Phospo made by the George W. Scott Company had become one of the most noted fertilizers in the south. (Tallahassee Weekly Floridian, January 28, 1886). In 1889, Scott founded Agnes Scott College. Around 1884 or 1885 the Scott plantation was sold to a J. P. Castleman, who had moved to Tallahassee from the Dakota Territory.

The Hausser firm was founded in 1904 by Christian Hausser and his sons Otto and Max. The factory was situated in Ludwigsburg near Stuttgart.http://www.elastolin.nl/pagina57.html Scales of figures Elastolin composition figures were manufactured in 40mm (also known as 4-cm), 65mm (6.5-cm), 70mm (7-cm), and 105mm (10.5 cm) scales. Since 70-mm is approximately 3-inches, a 70-mm figure is approximately 1/24 scale. The Elastolin catalogs of the 1930s describe the 7-cm figures as being \\"normal size\\" (normalgrosse) and the 4-cm figures as Miniatur-Soldaten. The catalog numbers for the 4-cm figures began with the preface M so the catalog number for a 4-cm marching Heer Trommler (Army snare drummer) was M 47/1. Production of all figures (and all other toys) ended after the German economy was put on a \\"total war\\" footing in 1943. Heer The Heer, all wearing the correct World War II German uniform, was represented by parade ground figures that included marching officers, marching infantry men, marching flag-carriers, marching musicians, a marching panzer man in his distinctive black uniform, marching Gebirgsjager (\\"mountain troops\\"), marching musicians, and cavalry and musicians mounted on horses. The parade ground figures had troops for a guard mounting that included officers standing at attention, enlisted personnel standing at attention or at \\"present arms\\", standing flag-carriers, a panzer man saluting, standing musicians, and sentry boxes as well as standing cavalry and standing cavalry musicians. There was a figure of a drill instructor and three figures of new recruits in fatigue uniform doing training exercises. Heer combat troops included Infanterie (series 500/- and 600/-) (riflemen, grenade throwers and machine gun teams), Kavallerie (series 400/-), Artillerie [series 664/-] (crewmen for the tinplate artillery pieces), Nachrichtentruppe (\\"communications troops\\") [series 659/-] which included World War I-vintage message dog- and carrier-pigeon-wranglers, Pioniere (\\"combat engineer and construction troops\\") [series 662/-] and Krad-Schutzen (\\"motorcycle troops\\") [series 990/-] on individual two-passenger motorcycles and three-passenger sidecar models. Poison gas had been used by both sides on the Western Front during World War I, and so there was a Gasalarmschlager (\\"gas alarm striker\\") [584] and several Infanterie figures wearing gas masks. The Verwundete und Sanitatspersonal (series 656) included doctors and nurses to treat the assortment of wounded soldiers that the medic figures brought back from the battlefield. Series 656 also included a Toter Soldat (\\"dead soldier\\") [652/15]. Lagerleben (\\"camp life\\") [series 550/-] was represented by soldiers washing, cleaning, eating, reclining and their tents. There was also figure 550/36/50, a unit clerk who came ready to work with his own table, bench and typewriter. Kriegsmarine The Kriegsmarine was represented by a \\"personality\\" figure of Großadmiral Erich Raeder saluting, marching officers carrying swords, sailors carrying rifles, marching fanfare trumpeters (Fanfarenblaser) and flag-carriers (Fahnentrager) and a short set of combat figures. There are two basic sets of marching figures -— one set wears the blue winter uniform and the other wears the white summer uniform. Complete sets of marching musicians were produced for both of the seasonal colors. There are also marching sailors wearing white shirts and blue trousers. The set of Kriegsmarine combat figures includes standing, kneeling and prone riflemen, a charging rifleman, a charging officer, a rifleman swinging his rifle like a club, and a grenade thrower. All Elastolin Kriegsmarine figures of the Nazi era (1933–1945) are cataloged in series 14/-- (The catalog number for a marching Kriegsmarine Trommler [snare drummer] was 14/47/1, with 14 indicating the branch of service; the second number, 47, indicated that the figure was a marching musician, and the final number, 1, indicated that the musician was a Trommler). Luftwaffe The Luftwaffe was represented on the parade ground by several different \\"personality\\" figures of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, and two series of marching figures: Flieger (\\"fliers\\") [series 26/-] with yellow waffenfarbe (\\"arm of service color\\") and Flak (\\"anti- aircraft troops) [series 28/-] with red waffenfarbe. Both branches were represented by several types of marching officers, marching enlisted personnel with rifles (some wearing the soft field cap, others wearing the iconic stahlhelm helmet), marching flag-carriers, and complete sets of marching and standing musicians. Fliegers and Flak alike were also represented by standing (non-marching) officers and enlisted men. The marching Fliegers also included an aircrewman wearing a beige \\"flight suit\\" instead of the blue Luftwaffe uniform. The Luftwaffe also had combat troops. There were 28/664 series Flak- Artillerie crews and 28/590 Flak-Krad-Schutzen figures. These figures were the same as their Heer counterparts but with the distinctive blue-gray uniform of the Luftwaffe. Elastolin solf them sold for the same price as their Heer counterparts, but modern auction catalogs usually list them at higher prices and modern day collectors must therefore take care that any 28/664 and 28/590 figures they buy are not post-war repaints of the regular 664 and 590 figures. Paramilitary The paramilitary units include the SA (Sturm Abteilung), the SS, the LSSAH (Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler = Hitler's elite SS bodyguard unit), the RAD (Reichsarbeitsdienst = German Labor Service), NSDAP (the Nazi party), Hitler Youth (Hitler Jugend), Jungvolk (pre-teen counterpart of the Hitler Youth), BdM (female counterpart of the Hitler Youth), Marinesturm (Marine-SA; a specialized sub-unit of the SA), and several others. All the paramilitary organizations were represented by marching figures. There were complete marching bands of SA, SS and RAD musicians; also a complete band of standing (non-marching) SA musicians that included a kesselpauker (kettle drummer). The Jungfolk were represented by marching drummers, flautists and fanfarenblaser. There were SA, SS, LSSAH, RAD, Hitler Youth, Jungvolk, BdM and NSFK marching figures carrying either the German national flag or the flag of their individual organization. The SA had been the largest and most visible of the Nazi paramilitary organizations in the 1920s and on into the 1930s, and so it is not surprising that Elastolin made many types of SA figures. There SA figures in several types of uniforms—the basic \\"brown shirt,\\" another uniform with a brown jacket, and a winter uniform. The SA marchers included men carrying packs, and men with slung rifles. The parade figures also included an SA medic and an SA nurse—quick \\"first aid\\" (at the least) was often important during the Kampfzeit (\\"time of battle/struggle\\") before Hitler was appointed chancellor! There were also figures on horseback, and a small group of mounted SA musicians. Stepping outside the parade ground, there was an extensive line of SA Lagerleben figures and others representing a unit undergoing field training. Personality figures The first \\"personality figures\\" Hausser producer were Kaiser Wilhelm II and soon after Feldmarschall von Hindenburg during World War I. The \\"personality figures\\" include Hitler, von Hindenburg, Ludendorff, Göring, Hess, Goebbels, von Schirach, Großadmiral Raeder, and Generalfeldmarschall von Mackensen in Hussar uniform. There are also two personality figures of Mussolini and one of Franco. A personality figure of SA leader Ernst Röhm was dropped from the line after he was executed during the so-called \\"Night of the Long Knives\\" (a purge of the socialist wing of the Nazi party) in 1934. The figure of General von Blomberg became a generic General figure after he was forced to retire in 1938.http://www.toy-soldier- gallery.com/Articles/Personalities/Personalities3.html Hitler was represented by several uniformed figures; one was a walking figure of Hitler reviewing troops or perhaps a Nazi unit with his right arm up in his unique bent-arm salute. There was also a seated Hitler to ride in one of Elastolin's magnificent staff cars (German children knew the Führer always sat up front next to the driver and never in the back seat). There was also an early figure of Hitler in civilian attire. Göring's high profile in the German leadership was reflected by the fact that he too was represented by figures showing him in SA, NSFK and Luftwaffe uniform. There was a walking figure (26/21) of Goring reviewing troops, and as Goring was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall and then to the unique rank of Reichsmarschall a figure was produced that showed \\"the Iron Man\\" holding an appropriately large marschall's baton. Premium grade figures of Hitler, Göring, Hindenburg, Mussolini and Franco were made with headless composition bodies that were then fitted with special-made porcelain heads that captured their facial features and expressions with exceptional clarity. These command premium prices from collectors. Mussolini was available as a walking figure (25/21N) and sitting astride a horse (25/496N). Generalfeldmarshall und Reichspresident von Hindenburg was still in the catalog for several years after his death in 1934 and was available in uniform (649), in civilian attire (648), and in uniform astride a horse. All of the Nazi leaders (Hitler, Röhm, Heß, Göring, Goebbels and von Schirach) were represented by at least one figure with a movable right arm that could be raised and positioned in the German greeting (aka the \\"Heil Hitler!\\" salute). The figures of Mussolini and Franco also had arms could also positioned in the Fascist-style salute (In contrast, Wehrmacht figures saluted/\\"greeted\\" each other with the traditional right-hand-touching-cap/helmet salute). Foreign (Ausländer) forces The foreign (Ausländer) armed services were also well represented. These include British, American, Danish, Dutch, Belgian, Ethiopian, French, Swiss, Italian, Hungarian, Romanian, (British) Indian, Chinese and Japanese. The French forces include the French Army (marching and combat figures), marching French sailors, marching French colonial forces (\\"French\\" and \\"native\\"), and a short line of the elite chasseurs alpins (mountain troops). The Belgians were represented by infantry—marching figures and combat figures; there was also a short line of figures wearing the distinctive green beret of the Ardennes Rifle Corps. The Italians were represented by marching infantry and several combat figures; there were also marching officers and men of the elite bersaglieri rifle units with their broad-brimmed hats and black cockerel feathers. Italian figures in tropical uniforms, and (black) African colonial soldiers were produced in small numbers. Guards Regiments in colourful dress uniforms were produced of Great Britain's Grenadier Guards and Denmark's Royal Life Guards. Hausser-Elastolin made most of its foreign figures by adding a head with the correct helmet to a headless conventional body and then painting the figure accordingly. That is why English, American and French soldiers are armed with German-style \\"potato masher\\" hand grenades rather than the Allied \\"pineapple\\" hand grenade, and why they carry a standard German gas mask canister. However, there are also some foreign figures that were made from special castings—those of Belgian and French soldiers wearing long greatcoats being the best example. Several other European nations took note of the greater protection afforded by the German stahlhelm design and used it for their own forces. This made it possible for Elastolin to create figures representing some foreign armies simply by painting standard German figures with German heads in the color(s) of a foreign uniform. Therefore, it is helpful to have a good reference book such as Andrew Mollo's The Armed Forces of World War II to correctly identify them—particularly when distinguishing between German, Hungarian and Swiss personnel. Other Hausser-Elastolin figures from the 1930s The Hausser- Elastolin line of the 1930s was not limited to the military and paramilitary units of the time. There was also an extensive line of cowboys and Indians (the cowboys sometimes known as \\"trappers\\" in Germany), a shorter line of medieval knights and foot soldiers (Ritterfiguren), and a short line of Prussian and Austrian figures from the 18th-century wars of Frederick the Great (Friedrich der Grosse) that included personality figures of \\"der alte Fritz\\" (0/7/20) and two of his generals—Seydlitz (0/7/21) and Ziethen (0/7/22). The figure of a Prussian drummer with a black (African) face (figure 0/7/47/1M) is correct; there was an African drummer in the Prussian army at that time, however such a figure should be checked carefully with a \\"black light\\" to make sure that it is not a post-war repaint. There was an extensive lines of wild animals (menagerie-und-jagdtiere) and farm animals (haustiere), and also a line of more than 30 civilian figures for use with electric trains (Eisenbahn-Figuren). The latter included DRB (Deutsche Reichsbahn = German Railway) workers, station workers such as luggage carriers, and passengers; they were produced primarily in 7-cm (Normalgroße) although some were also available in 5-cm and 3-cm sizes. Accessories Hausser produced log cabin forts for the cowboys, castles/fortresses for the knights, houses and barns for the farmers and their animals, zoo enclosures for the wild animals, and an assortment of trench pieces and bunkers (Schutzengraben aus Holz) that allowed piece-by-piece purchase and assembly of multi-line trench systems for the soldiers. These included artillery emplacements, command bunkers, a field kitchen and a first aid station. There was an equally extensive line of tin plate military wagons (including a field kitchen and a field bakery), trucks, half-tracks, searchlights and artillery pieces. Some of the 1920s vintage models were rather generic in design, but some of the later models were accurate scale models of their real-life counterparts—the 721-1/2 leichtes Inf.-Geschutz (\\"light infantry cannon\\"), 726 schweres Langrohrgeschutz (\\"heavy long-barreled cannon\\"), 710 Schwere Feldhaubitze (\\"heavy field howitzer\\") and the 744 Panzer-Spahwagen (\\"armored scout wagen\\" = armored car) in particular.http://en.toy-soldier- gallery.com/Index.cgi?action=source&source;=details&id;=29&page;=12 Hausser Elastolin Catalogue 1939/40 Elastolin added play action value to these toys in several ways. Several of the motor vehicles had battery-powered electric motors that propelled them across the tin plate battlefield with functional electric headlights lighting the way; the truck-mounted and stationary search lights were also functional. The Nachrichtentruppe figure series included \\"radio groups\\" equipped with batteries that allowed messages to be sent and received in Morse code. Three of the Infanterie riflemen (54/624, 54/626 and 54/628) contained a cap-firing device that—when tripped—would, in theory, send a puff of smoke out the barrel of their (oversize) rifles. Many of the tin plate artillery pieces not only fired caps but projectiles as well—which, in theory were fired only at enemy soldiers and never at family pets or one's younger siblings! Enterprising young generals with the financial resources to do so could also provide their forces with engineer units using two types of man-powered water craft for crossing water obstacles, and with either a pontoon bridge or a conventional girder bridge so that horses and motor vehicles could cross as well. Post-World War II production Limited production of composition figures resumed several years after the end of World War II in 1945 subject to the strict terms of \\"de-Nazification.\\" Post-war production included the politically inoffensive Swiss figures with their black German-style helmets and black ankle boots, and a new line of American army figures wearing the dark olive uniform and \\"steel pot\\" style helmet of the WWII-era US Army. Figures representing the post-war Bundeswehr and Austrian armies went into production after West Germany and Austria were again allowed to form military forces.http://en.toy-soldier- gallery.com/Index.cgi?action=source&source;=details&id;=80 Hausser Elastolin Flyer Bundeswehr 1958 Hausser continued to use the brand name Elastolin when it began production of figures in a hard polystyrene plastic in 1955 (production of figures in the older sawdust-based composition material continued). In the years that followed the company produced Roman soldiers, Huns, Vikings, Normans, Landsknechts and 17th-century Turks. Hausser-Elastolin also manufactured personality figures of Prince Valiant and at least one or two other characters from the popular comic strip and feature film. Some of the old figure lines -- Medieval figures, \\"Trappers\\" (cowboys), American Indians and de-Nazified figures of World War-II era German soldiers—were also manufactured in plastic. Hausser had exclusive rights to produce figures for the works of Karl May, a German author whose tales of the American \\"Wild West\\" captured the imaginations of several generations of German boys, and so there are plastic figures representing several of May's best-known characters. Along with these figures came an impressive new line of catapults, siege towers, a battering ram, camp fences, and early artillery pieces. Collectors recognize several distinct production series (or types) of these plastic figures. The early lines were sold fully painted as with the older composition figures, a later line was sold unpainted. Plastic figures cannot be correctly identified or appraised in terms of value without reference to the color of the plastic. Beyond that, the rarity (and value) of some figures is also determined by the color of their clothing; some colors are rarer than others. The 1980 catalog includes Romans, Vikings, Huns, Normans/Medieval figures (including Prince Valiant and Sir Gawain), Landsknechts, Turks, American Indians, cowboys, US cavalry, Karl May characters, Arabs, US War of Independence figures (US regulars and militia, English and German), Prussian soldiers, Union and Confederate soldiers from the American Civil War, contemporary Swiss and Austrian soldiers, de-Nazified World War-II era German soldiers, and two figures representing the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The cowboys included two masked outlaws and several men wearing buckskin rather than cloth. The line also included the unfortunate prisoner tied to a tree. In addition to all the fighting men where were also some civilians—a blacksmith and several helpers with a forge and well from the Middle Ages, and a few Caucasian women and children from the American \\"Wild West\\" as the counterparts for the American Indian women and children. Each of the Revolutionary War forces could call on the services of a woman holding a cup in one hand a larger container in the other—presumably both held water. Historical personality figurers in 1980 included Götz von Berlichingen, Georg von Frundsberg and Friedrich der Große. One of the several Revolutionary War figures was certainly intended to be George Washington, but the catalog did not identify him as such. Wheeled vehicles included a four-horse Roman chariot, a Kampfwagen (battle wagen) of the European late-Middle Ages, an American stage coach drawn by two horses, and an American covered wagen (also drawn by two horses) Demise Hausser stopped manufacturing figures from composite materials in 1969. Production of plastic figures continued through 1982. The company filed for bankruptcy in June 1983 and ceased production by the end of the year. Many of the Hausser moulds were purchased by the Preiser company and are currently being reproduced in plastic.

Prior to becoming the head coach at UC Santa Barbara, Henrickson was the head coach at the University of Kansas from 2004 to 2015, combining a record of 186–171, and before Kansas, Henrickson was the head coach at Virginia Tech, where she led the Hokies to a 158–62 record, including 7 post-season appearances. Biography Henrickson is a native of Willmar, Minnesota. She has four siblings. She graduated from St. Cloud State University in 1986. When playing at SCSU, she helped win three Northern Sun Conference championships and advance to three NCAA Division II quarterfinals. In her four years at SCSU, they compiled a 97–25 record, including a 31–4 record in her sophomore season. She has records at SCSU in total points scored (4th – 1,731), rebounds (3rd – 995), free throws (1st – 507) and free throw percentage (4th – .790). She also was named to the All-Conference Team three times. Henrickson was a team captain her junior and senior years. She earned her master's degree in Physical Education in 1988 from Western Illinois University while holding the position as a graduate assistant coach with the women's basketball team. =Accolades= * 2005 Carol Eckman Award Winner * 2004–05 Kansas City Star Honorable Mention consideration for Big 12 Coach of the Year * 2004 Virginia SID Coach of the Year * 2003 Head Coach USA Jones Cup Team (Gold Medal) * 1999 National Coach of the Year Finalist * 1999 Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year * 1999 Assistant Coach USA World University =Team Performance= * 8 Postseason Appearances * Average 21 wins per season * 2 Conference Championships * 5 NCAA Appearances (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004) * 2 NCAA Sweet 16 Appearance * 3 WNBA draftees * 14 All-Conference Athletes * 3 Academic All-Americans Coaching career =Virginia Tech (1997–2004)= Henrickson was head coach at Virginia Tech for seven years, where she guided the Hokies to a record of 158–62 and seven postseason appearances. Under her leadership, Virginia Tech reached the NCAA tournament five times, the WNIT twice and won 20 or more games every season. When Henrickson took over at Virginia Tech for the 1997–98 season, she orchestrated the biggest turnaround in school history. She guided her team to a 22–10 record, the school's first Atlantic 10 Conference title and an NCAA second-round appearance just one season after the Hokies had finished last in the Atlantic 10 Conference with a 10–21 record. In 2003–04, Henrickson led the Hokies to a 23–8 overall record, including a 10–6 mark in the Big East. Virginia Tech advanced to the second round of the NCAA tournament for the second-straight year before bowing out to No. 5 Penn State. =University of Kansas (2004–2015)= In her eight years at the helm of the University of Kansas program, Henrickson had taken the Jayhawk program from the cellar of the Big 12 Conference to continually climbing toward the top of the league standings. In addition, KU has advanced to postseason play in six of her eight seasons, including in each of the last five years, highlighted by last season's NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 run. With the best postseason effort by the Jayhawks since 1998, Henrickson guided Kansas to a 21–13 record during the 2011–12 season and NCAA Tournament victories over Nebraska (57–49) and Delaware (70–64), before falling to Tennessee in the Sweet 16. All-America honorable mention, All-Big 12 Second Team selection and the nation's assist leader Angel Goodrich led the way for the Jayhawks during the NCAA Tournament. KU also had All-America honorable mention and All-Big 12 First Team honoree Carolyn Davis for the first 23 games, before a knee injury sidelined her for the remainder of the season. With more than just putting wins back on the record, Henrickson and her team set a Big 12 single-game attendance record when Kansas hosted South Florida in the 2009 WNIT Championship game, as 16,113 fans supported the KU women's basketball program in historic Allen Fieldhouse. KU finished the 2008–09 season ranked in the Top 25 on the NCAA attendance chart and ranked fourth in the country in attendance increase. KU advanced to postseason play for the fourth-straight season and fifth time overall under Henrickson in 2010–11, as the Jayhawks advanced to the second round of the Women's NIT before falling to Duquesne. KU posted its second 20-win season under Henrickson and recorded 20 or more wins for the second time in the last three seasons as the Jayhawks concluded the 2010–11 season with a 21–13 overall record. Kansas saw much of its success through Davis, a sophomore at the time, who averaged a team- leading 19.0 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game on her way to First Team All-Big 12 accolades. Davis led the Big 12 and ranked second nationally shooting 66.0 percent from the field. Additionally, KU saw the return from injury of Goodrich, who averaged 7.5 points, 6.3 assists and 1.7 steals per game on her way to being named a finalist for the V Foundation Comeback Award. In 2009–10, Henrickson guided the Jayhawks to their first national ranking in a decade. Kansas appeared in the Associated Press Poll for nine-consecutive weeks to open the season, ranking as high as No. 18. Jayhawk senior guard Danielle McCray was named the 2009 Preseason Big 12 Player of the Year and was well on her way to All-America honors prior to suffering a season-ending knee injury in early February. The injury did not keep McCray from being drafted as she was the seventh overall selection in the 2010 WNBA Draft, becoming the first Kansas player to be taken in the draft under Henrickson. In addition, Davis was named a Freshman All-American and to the Big 12 All-Freshman Team. Henrickson's 2008–09 squad had a \\"break-out\\" performance of sorts, demonstrating down the stretch of the season all the fruits of its labor. KU opened the season strong, compiling an 11–2 non-conference mark. The Jayhawks struggled early in Big 12 Conference play, opening with a 2–9 mark versus league opponents, before turning the corner. KU closed conference action winning four of its last five games, including wins over ranked teams No. 21 Iowa State and No. 5 Baylor. Kansas concluded the regular season with a 6–10 mark in Big 12 play, marking the most conference wins for Henrickson in her five seasons at KU. The Jayhawks' seventh-place finish was their highest in Henrickson's tenure. The Jayhawks advanced to the WNIT for the second- consecutive season and third time under Henrickson, only this time they were more determined than ever to make all of their hard work pay off. KU reeled off four-straight wins, including a victory over Southeastern Conference member Arkansas and a hard-fought win at New Mexico, one of the most notoriously tough places to play in all of the NCAA. Despite falling to South Florida in the title game, Kansas still finished the 2008–09 season with a 22–14 overall mark, giving the Jayhawks their most wins since the 1998–99 season. In addition to the team having a break-through season, McCray burst onto the national scene with an eye-popping season of her own. McCray, who was named First Team All-Big 12, became the first Jayhawk since Lynn Pride in 1999 to earn All-America Honorable Mention honors as she was feted by both the Associated Press and State Farm. Additionally, she collected three Big 12 Player of the Week honors and was selected as an All-American Strength and Conditioning Athlete of the Year. Following the season, McCray was invited to try out for USA Basketball's World University Games Team. After becoming one of 12 players chosen for the team, she traveled to Belgrade, Serbia for the 2009 World University Games where she helped lead the US to the gold medal. Henrickson's 2007–08 squad posted a winning record, finishing the campaign with a 17–16 mark, while two players were honored by the league coaches with McCray being tabbed All-Big 12 Honorable Mention and center Krysten Boogaard appearing on the Big 12 All-Rookie Team. The Jayhawks advanced to postseason play for the second time in Henrickson's first four seasons with a trip to the WNIT. Henrickson's young Jayhawk squad in 2006–07, consisting of seven freshmen and just two seniors, came on strong at the end of the year, winning five of their last seven games. Kelly Kohn and McCray each took home Big 12 newcomer awards as Kohn was the Big 12 Rookie of the Week (Dec. 17, 2006) and McCray was honored as a member of the Waco Tribune-Herald Big 12 All-Freshman Team. A resurgence in Jayhawks' women's basketball was quite evident throughout the 2005–06 season as Henrickson's second campaign was capped off with a berth to the WNIT – KU's first postseason appearance since 2000. Under Henrickson's guidance that season, Kansas finished 17–13 to mark its first winning season in six years. Along the way, KU set a school record with 12-straight victories to open the season and snapped a 36-game drought against ranked opponents by defeating No. 23 Texas. Using the qualities that earned her the 2005 Carol Eckman Award – an award given by the WBCA which recognizes a coach who exemplifies spirit, integrity and character through sportsmanship, commitment to the student-athlete, honesty, ethical behavior, courage and dedication to purpose—Henrickson developed Crystal Kemp and Erica Hallman into All-Big 12 selections for the second-straight year. In 2004–05, Kansas posted its most wins (12) and conference wins (five) in four seasons, and placed eighth in the Big 12 Conference—the highest Jayhawk finish in five years. In the process, Henrickson developed Kemp and Hallman into KU's first two All-Big 12 selections since 2000–01. Henrickson and her staff have not only guided their athletes to victories on the court, but many have achieved tremendous accomplishments in the classroom at KU. Under Henrickson, the overall team GPA has steadily risen since she arrived in Lawrence and during the 2007–08 school year the Jayhawks achieved a team-record 3.11 GPA. In her eight seasons, the Jayhawks have earned 27 Academic All-Big 12 Team appointments. On March 9, 2015, Henrickson had been relieved of her duties for failing to make the program a top Big 12 Conference team. Henrickson compiled a record of 186–171 while at Kansas. Head coaching record USA Basketball Henrickson served as an assistant coach, under head coach Rene Portland, of the USA representative to the 1999 World University Games (also known as the Universiade). The event was held in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. The USA team won their opening two games easily, including a mismatch against South Africa with a final score of 140–32, but lost against the Ukraine, 81–70. They earned a position in the medal rounds and defeated Lithuania in the quarterfinals. USA then took on undefeated Russia and won a close game 87–79, setting up the championship game between the USA and host Spain. After falling behind early, the USA team kept the game close, and got within five points with under two minutes to go, but Spain held on to win the gold medal. The USA team received the silver medal. Henrickson was named head coach of the team representing the USA in 2000 at the William Jones Cup competition in Taipei, Taiwan. The USA team started strong with a 32-point win over the host team, the Republic of China National Team. They then beat South Korea easily and faced Japan in the third game. Japan started out strongly, and had an 18-point lead in the first half. The USA then out scored Japan 23–3 to take a small lead at the half. The USA built a ten-point lead, but Japan cut it back to three with under a minute to go. Kelly Schumacher grabbed an offensive rebound and scored to bring the lead back to five points and the team held on for the win. Schumacher had 24 points to help the USA team beat Japan 83–80. The final game was against Malaysia, but it wasn't close, with the USA winning 79–24, to secure a 4–0 record for the competition and the gold medal.

They are currently playing in South West Premier, a league at tier 5 of the English rugby union system following promotion from South West 1 East as champions at the end of the 2018-19 season. Newbury RFC is a community rugby club using players drawn from the local community and those coached through its youth rugby program. History The club was founded in 1928 due to the efforts of Len Whittaker who left St. Bartholomews Grammar School in 1924. The first game played by the newly formed club took place on 15 September 1928 against Midlands team, Stoke RFC. This was the first of 23 games that season during which the club won 13 matches and lost 10. Even throughout the early years of the club, the standard of play encouraged such major sides as Northampton, Gloucester, Harlequins and Wasps to come and play against Newbury. The club's home ground In 1932 the club found a permanent home where they stayed until 1952 at which time the club moved to Pinchington Lane to the south of the town. It was not until 1958 that a clubhouse could be built on the site which was less than a mile from the present headquarters at Monks Lane where they have five pitches, of which three are fully floodlit. The 1938–39 season saw Newbury unofficially crowned by the local press as \\"Champions of Berkshire\\". The first game to be played after the War was on 13 April 1946 and despite the inauspicious date, the club won the match 37 – 0 against Windsor. When the league system for English rugby started in 1987, Newbury were playing in a regional league – Courage South West 1. They were relegated at the end of their first season, but by the 1990–91 season they were back in South West 1 and then promoted a second time, having finished as runners-up. By the 1994–95 season they had been relegated back into South West 1, and again finished runners-up. Unfortunately for The Blues, though, there was no promotion place for runners-up that season. The following season, however, The Blues were promoted back into the National League as champions of South West 1. The 1996–97 season saw the advent of professionalism in English Rugby, along with the reduction in the number of tiers in the league from 5 to 4. The Blues spent the season in the 4th tier (known as National 4 South at the time) and enjoyed their second successive promotion, again as champions. The next eight seasons were spent in the third tier (known as the Jewson National League 1 for the first three seasons, latterly changing to National Division 2 following the league restructure at the end of the 1999–00 season). The Blues finished 7th, 5th, 5th, 9th, 8th, 9th, and 8th, before finishing as runners-up in 2004–05 and finally achieving the fifth promotion of their league career. In their first season in the second tier of English rugby (known at the time as National Division One), The Blues finished 11th under coach Ben Ryan, and achieved exactly the same placement the following season. The Blues third season in the second tier was slightly less successful, with the team finishing in 13th place in 2007–08 under coach Chris Dossett, and in 2008-09 Newbury finished 3rd-bottom with just 4 wins under coach Ben Sturnham. In normal seasons this would have resulted in a narrow escape from relegation, but with another league restructure undertaken at the end of the season there were five teams relegated instead of the usual two, taking The Blues back down to National League One (the 3rd tier) for the first time since the 2004–05 season. The 2009–10 season saw The Blues suffer a second successive relegation under Ben Sturnham, despite winning 12 games, and they were relegated to the fourth tier (National League 2) for the first time since 1997. In 2010–11, under coach Andy Widdop, The Blues hit new lows, winning just one game and achieving an unwanted division record of 2,055 points conceded. Naturally this resulted in a last-place finish and a third successive relegation. Mike Marchant took over as coach for the 2011–12 season in National League 3 South West, but The Blues did only slightly better than the previous season, winning just two games. They were relegated at the end of the season to the sixth tier, South West Division One East. This was reported in local media at the time as being lower than the league where Newbury Blues started their league careers, although this is debatable as South West Division One East was by now the equivalent league to South West 2, where Newbury Blues spent the 1987–88 season. In 2012–13 The Blues finally arrested their slide down the divisions and managed to avoid a fifth successive relegation by winning ten games and finishing a creditable 9th in the division. Former Samoan international Ngapaku Ngapaku (known as Pux) was coach. Pux left at the end of the season, having guided The Blues to survival for the first time since 2009, and Lee Goodall took over the head coach role. 2013–14 saw The Blues finish 11th with eight wins, before winning 15 games in the 2014-15 season and finishing 6th. The 2015–16 season was The Blues most successful in a long time, with 21 wins, including a 14-game winning streak that saw them win every single game in 2016, resulting in a third place finish and only a lack of bonus points denying The Blues a play-off place (Salisbury had 20 wins to Newbury’s 21, but had picked up 14 bonus points to Newbury’s 8). Building on the previous season's success the 2016–17 season ended with The Blues in second position and into the play-off match against Clevedon RFC in April to decide who would be promoted up into National League 3 South West (renamed South West Premier for season 2017–18). With 21 wins, 1 draw and 4 losses the match statistics were the same as the previous season, but what was markedly different was in the try bonus points, with 17 against the previous season's 7. The match finished at 25–22 with Newbury the victors and promotion. On 28 April 2018 The Blues were once again relegated, despite having won 13 of the 26 games in the season https://www.newburytoday.co.uk/news/sport/24038/blues-name-paul-archer- as-new-head-coach.html. They finished with 64 points, had the best defensive record in the league after table toppers Dings Crusaders, beat Bournemouth, Maidenhead and Newtown Abbot both home and away who finished second, third and fourth in the league respectively, but unfortunately with just 7 try-scoring bonus points during the season it wasn't enough to keep out of the relegation zone and on the final day of an extended season they missed out on staying up by one point. The 2018-19 season in the Wadworth 6X South West One East division did however get off to a great start with a 67-7 away win against Stratford-Upon-Avon that was followed up with an emphatic 85-0 home win against Swindon.

She was the first female mayor of Stockholm, serving between 2004 and 2006. Background Billström's background was as the chief financial officer of Handels, the Swedish Commercial Employees' Union between 1987 and 1994. She was elected to the Stockholm City Council serving as road commissioner in 1994–98 and commissioner in opposition from 1998 to 2002. Mayoralty Billström was appointed mayor of Stockholm in 2002 by the City Council after winning the municipal election and forming a majority with the Left party and the Green party. Two of her decisions as mayor in particular were controversial, the first being the new entry toll that was introduced for vehicles entering the centre of Stockholm. The toll was decided on a state-level to ensure support by the Green Party for the newly formed Social democratic cabinet and Billström was forced to honor this agreement even though she had promised not to in the run up to the 2002 election. In 2006 a referendum was held to let the people of Stockholm determine whether they wanted the entry tolls permanented or not, with more than 51% voting yes. The entry tolls were thus enforced by the conservative majority ruling 2006–10. Billström's other decision was to turn a central building in Stockholm (Skatteskrapan på Södermalm) into student housing, which was criticised for being expensive for taxpayers. After losing the election in 2006, Billström stepped down and was replaced by Carin Jämtin.

Habitat U. geyri is found in rocky, semi-arid habitats. Geographic range U. geyri is found in parts of Algeria, Mali, and Niger. Etymology The generic name, Uromastyx, is derived from the Ancient Greek words ourá (οὐρά) meaning \\"tail\\" and mastiga (μαστίγα) meaning \\"whip\\" or \\"scourge\\", after the thick-spiked tail characteristic of all Uromastyx species. The specific name, geyri, is in honor of German zoologist Hans Geyr von Schweppenburg.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles.

Description U. geyri is a relatively small, slender species for the genus, with an average total length (including tail) of around . This lizard is usually beige or orange with lighter spots. It is one of the brightest-colored species of the genus Uromastyx. There are two phases of U. geyri, the \\"red\\" geyri and \\"yellow\\" geyri, color being their only difference. The red phase is often nearly solid reddish to neon pumpkin orange, and the yellow phase is in or near a neon- range. Females are a more pale color than the males, showing more tan variations of the coloring and much less belly coloring as well as less vivid patterns, most females having a simple \\"freckling\\" on the back. \\"Saharans\\" are medium-sized lizards, many averaging in total length, and weighing or more as adults.

Port St. Louis Louis Antoine de Bougainville The settlement was established as a French colony under the name Port Saint Louis in 1764, and within a year reached a population of 75 (most of them Acadians), with three marriages and two births recorded (once of the births was François Benoit in 1764, son of Agustin Benoit and Françoise Thériault. Sébastien died in 1839, Bay St. George, Newfoundland) – apparently the first ever in the islands' history. After three years of French possession the settlement was ceded to Spain, and all the French settlers left to be replaced by Spaniards. Acting on personal instructions by King Carlos III, the Spanish Government reimbursed the founder of Port St. Louis, Louis Antoine de Bougainville, 618,108 French livres.http://www.brasdorfirstnation.com/The_Benoit__Mikmaq_Family.php Bougainville himself sailed to Port Saint Louis on board the Boudeuse, accompanied by the Spanish ships Esmeralda and Liebre to hand the settlement over to Felipe Ruíz Puente, the first Spanish governor (1767–1773) of Puerto Soledad, as the settlement would become known. The ceremony took place on April 1, 1767, and from Puerto Soledad Bougainville set sail to make the first French circumnavigation of the world.Robson, John. A short biography of Louis- Antoine de Bougainville. Dom Pernety, 1769. (Looking eastwards). Puerto Soledad Puerto Soledad had 103 residents in 1781: the governor, two priests, a treasury official, three officers, one surgeon, 50 soldiers, 43 convicts, one mason, and one baker. They occupied some 20 buildings including dwellings, barracks for officers, seamen, convicts and troops, chapel, hospital, kiln, blacksmith and carpenter shops, etc. Eventually the number of buildings increased to about 30 in 1811, with the population dropping to 46. The settlement was protected by three batteries: San Carlos (later renamed San Marcos), Santiago, and San Felipe Batteries. Supply ships came from Montevideo to Puerto Soledad on an annual basis during the summer, bringing relief and supplies. That supply line was temporarily severed during the war waged by Spain against Britain in 1805–1808, and the British occupation of Montevideo in 1807, causing considerable hardship to the Puerto Soledad residents.Destéfani, Laurio H.

King Carlos III of Spain An indispensable source of subsistence for the small colony – as well as for the numerous English and American sealers operating on the islands – was the feral cattle introduced by the French in 1764. There were 2,180 head of cattle and 166 horses in 1778. On festive occasions the Spaniards even had their favourite corridas de toro, such as during the three-day event organized by governor Ramón Clairac y Villalonga (1787–88, 1789–90) to celebrate King Carlos IV's accession to the throne when, along with allegiance formally sworn to the new monarch comedies were performed, and twelve bulls were fought.Darwin, Charles. The Voyage of the Beagle, Chapter 9 - Santa Cruz, Patagonia, and the Falkland Islands Spain governed Puerto Soledad through its colonial administration in Buenos Aires. During its 44 years of existence the settlement had 21 governors () serving a total of 31 terms, mainly Spaniards excepting two South American criollos: Jacinto de Antolaguirre (1781–1783) born in Buenos Aires, and Francisco Javier de Viana y Alzaibár (1798–99, 1800–01) born in Montevideo. The governors were mainly naval officers with the exception of one drawn from the army. Map of Puerto Soledad; notice the pentagonal old fort, the corral, and the cemetery. Following a decision by Viceroy Francisco Javier Elío, on February 13, 1811 all the troops and settlers of Puerto Soledad were evacuated on board the brigantine Galvez to Montevideo in order to fight his Buenos Airean adversaries. A lead plaque was left at the chapel of Puerto Soledad pleading possession of the island and the settlement for King Fernando VII of Spain.Lorenz, Federico Guillermo. Malvinas, veinte años después. Todo es Historia, No. 417, April 2002, pp. 6–15. Puerto Luis During the subsequent 17 years the settlement, while frequented by sealers, had remained largely derelict, until Louis Vernet brought some settlers under the authority of Buenos Aires Province in 1828. Vernet, aware of British claims to the Falklands, had also sought permission for his expedition from the British consulate. That new settlement existed under the name Puerto Luis until 1833 when it was renamed first Anson's Harbour and eventually \\"Port Louis\\" by the British. Port Louis Port Louis remained the sole settlement and administrative centre of the islands until the capital was moved to the newly established Stanley in 1845. After this, following a 17-year eventful and occasionally turbulent existence the settlement declined in importance, eventually becoming a sheep farm.A Brief History of the Falkland Islands.

One of South Korea's most popular winter street foods, the snack is often sold at street stalls, grilled on an appliance similar to a waffle iron but with a fish-shaped mold. Red bean paste is the standard filling but many bungeo-ppang sold as street food are filled with pastry cream (called \\"choux-cream\\" in South Korea), pizza toppings, chocolate and others.  Etymology  The word bungeo-ppang is a compound of \\"carp (bungeo)\\" and \\"bread (ppang)\\". The pastry, however, contains no ingredients from its namesake fish or any other fish; rather the name comes from the shape of the pastry.  History  Bungeo-ppang was derived from a similar Japanese treat, taiyaki (baked sea bream), introduced to Korea around the 1930s when the country was under Japanese rule. According to the 2011 book Bungeoppang Has a Family Tree, bungeo-ppang began as a mix of Western waffles and Eastern dumplings, as the taiyaki itself was a Japanese adaptation of Western waffles introduced to Japan in the 18th century. The change of fish-shaped pastry continued, as the sea bream-shaped taiyaki became carp-shaped bungeo-ppang in Korea. Although bungeo-ppang's popularity did not last long, it found its way back into popularity during the 1990s with the retro craze in South Korea. Recently, bungeo-ppang is seeing higher demand, so to provide information on remaining stalls, enthusiasts nationwide created a \\"bungeoppang map.\\" Through Google Maps, users mark the stalls’ locations with brief reviews, prices and opening hours to share with others.  Preparation  Bungeo-ppang batter is made of wheat flour, baking powder, water and/or milk, and optionally eggs. The batter is poured into a fish-shaped mold in the bungeo-ppang grill, an appliance similar to a waffle iron. Sweetened red bean paste with bits of broken beans and bean husk is added, and then more batter is poured to encase the paste. The mold is then closed to grill the pastry until it is golden and crispy.

The main economy of El Triunfo is derived from agriculture, livestock and small amounts of commerce. In 1995 the population was estimated to be 747 inhabitants. El Triunfo has a long history of sending migrant workers to the United States dating back to the Bracero Program. The population of El Triunfo tends to swell during the months of September and December when many of its citizens who live and work in United States return for the Fiesta De San Miguel. It is believed that it was inhabited by Purepechas or Aztecs before the arrival of the Spaniards, because some ruins were found while the church building was being constructed. Among them, according to archaeologists depict Quetzacatl (the feathered serpent) an Aztec or Purepecha god The history of El Triunfo de San Miguel. It is believed that the inhabitants before the Spaniards arrived were either Purepechas or Aztecs. The reason for this belief is because during the construction of the new church some artifacts were found, among the items was a rock with what appears to be the symbol of Quetzacatl (the feathered serpent which is a god in both the Purepecha and Aztec cultures. The rock was found by Antonio Cabrera in 1988 as he was digging to make a well for drinking water. The official name is El Triunfo de San Miguel. It is named after its patron saint San Miguel Arcangel. Before that it was known as La Fantasma (The Phantom). Legend has it that San Miguel freed the town of the phantom and on September 29, 1925 the day of the patron saint the name was officially changed to El Triunfo de San Miguel. Every year many people descendants of San Miguel who now live in the United States or elsewhere return to San Miguel to participate in the Fiestas de San Miguel a yearly tradition that dates back a few years. The Fiestas de San Miguel is arguably one of the most anticipated celebration in the region which is eagerly awaited by everyone. In past years the Fiestas have had such notable performers such as Las Jilguerillas, Los Muecas, Los Cadetes de Linares and others. The performance by Las Jilguerillas was one of the most attended in the history of the Fiestas.

It is used in the design of digital electronics. Illustration Timing Margin Illustration In this image, the lower signal is the clock and the upper signal is the data. Data is recognized by the circuit at the positive edge of the clock. There are two time intervals illustrated in this image. One is the setup time, and the other is the timing margin. The setup time is illustrated in red in this image; the timing margin is illustrated in green. The edges of the signals can shift around in a real-world electronic system for various reasons. If the clock and the data signal are shifted relative to each other, this may increase or reduce the timing margin; as long as the data signal changes before the setup time is entered, the data will be interpreted correctly. If it is known from experience that the signals can shift relative to each other by as much as 2 microseconds, for instance, designing the system with at least 2 microseconds of timing margin will prevent incorrect interpretation of the data signal by the receiver. If the physical design of the circuit is changed, for example by giving more wire that the clock signal is transmitted on, the edge of the data signal will move closer to the positive edge of the clock signal, reducing the timing margin. If the signals have been designed with enough timing margin, only the correct data will be received.

Music was composed by Bill McCauley. The CBC aired the series at a cost of $8,000 per episode, and the BBC paid $10,000 per episode. R.C.M.P. was realistic in portraying small-town Canadian life, and often had the look of a documentary. The series used the characters’ rural isolation, the changing weather conditions, and the cultural differences between whites and natives as focal points for episode stories. Crawley had hoped to sell the series to a United States television network, and was disappointed with needing to settle for less profitable syndication status, but the American television networks weren't interested in buying a foreign series unless they were involved in its production. Though Crawley had hired Hollywood-based Bernard Girard as head of production, that did not satisfy the U.S. networks, who wanted more control over the series they broadcast, so the series was syndicated to United States television stations.  Episodes   Broadcast  The series aired on CBC in Canada, premiering on 28 October 1959, and airing its finale episode on 19 October 1960.

History Otley RUFC was founded in 1865 but broke away from rugby union in 1900 to become a rugby league club. They disbanded in 1906 and reformed as a rugby union club in 1907, the ground being at Wharfeside. In 1909-10 they won the Yorkshire Challenge Cup. Play was suspended during the First World War, but started again in 1919, and on 28 September 1921 they moved to a new and better ground at Cross Green, Otley. In the 2007–08 season they won the National Division Two title securing an immediate return to National Division One having been relegated the previous season, however they were immediately relegated again in the 2008–09 season along with fellow promoted side Manchester and three other teams due to the new professionalised format of National Division One (now the RFU Championship). Two seasons later the club was relegated again, this time to National League 2 North. The all-time leading try scorer is James Twomey, with 74 in 107 appearances between 2009 and 2013.

Conference objective  The theme of the third session of the world urban forum was: \\"Sustainable Cities – Turning Ideas into Action\\". \\"From Ideas to Action\\" was the intended outcome of the conference. Officially it was suggested that this conference would be considered a success if every participant took home and implemented at least one new idea.  Global urban context  Within the next 50 years, two-thirds of the world's population will live in urban areas. As these cities expand, the world community faces the challenge of minimizing the growing poverty crisis and improving the urban poor's access to basic facilities, such as shelter, clean water and sanitation. World Urban Forum 3 brought together thousands of the world's best thinkers on urbanization – experts, decision makers and members of public and private institutions – to zero in on solutions to these key 21st century challenges.  Defining the conference  Habitat Jam, a three-day international online event, was conceived to set the stage for the WUF3 conference. Seventy actionable ideas were collected through the Jam and were used to define themes and shape discussion topics for delegates attending the forum. Participation in Habitat Jam was open to public and private-sector organizations and individuals around the world with an interest in urban issues. While the Jam is over the discussions remain available online.  Participation  Attendance at WUF3 was estimated at 11,418 people registered from more than 100 countries. The number of participants was 9,689 while 1,847 were support staff and volunteers. The gender ratios were 46.7% female and 52.1% male.

The Damasch region is protected by the Department of Environment of Iran. The flower is called Sousan-e Chehel Cheraagh in Iran and the local area and its appearance is one of the most striking features in the area at the time of blooming.  Description  Lilium ledebourii is a persistent herbaceous plant that grows 50-150 centimeters tall. The yellow bulbs are oval and reach a diameter of 5-7 centimeters; they are highly segmented, and the scales are lance-shaped. The stem is strong and straight. The leaves stand upright, and have fine hairs on the edge; their shape is linear to lance-shaped. They are 10-14 centimeters long, and 1-2 centimeters wide. The monoecious plant blooms in June and July with a panicle of one to fifteen fragrant flowers. The flowers are actinomorphic and attached on up to 13-centimeter-long petioles. The bracts are lanceolate, and blue at the top. The six tepals are strongly reflexed and form a tiara of 4-6 cm in diameter. The basic color of the flower is white, turning green towards the base and purple towards the tepal-tips. The filaments are green, and the pollen bright red. The seed capsule, which has the shape of an inverted egg, is approximately hexagonal, 3-4.5 centimeters long and 2.5-3.2 centimeters wide. The seeds ripen until September, and their germination is delayed-epigeous: the leaves that the seedling had as an embryo become photosynthetic once they emerge from the soil.  Habitat  Lilium ledebourii occurs at altitudes around 2,100 meter. It needs a dry, sunny position in well-drained soil, it is very susceptible to moisture. In June 2012 Dr. M.R. Asef an Iranian Mycologist and researcher found Lilium ledebourii from Vaz forest in Noor (Mazandaran province)at altitudes around 1670 meter .

Reid discounted Manchester's thesis about Churchill's mental illness, and favoured the man as he struggled through stressful and depressing times. In Reid's opinion, Churchill mastered alcohol. The biography was issued in 2012, and was hailed by the trade press. The publisher's advance of USD 200,000 was insufficient to float the author through nine years of research and writing, and he needed to invest copious amounts in the finished product.

Described as \\"a classic tale of struggle, power, personalities and tripe\\", the strip was a parody of John Galsworthy's classic novel series The Forsyte Saga. However, the slightly bizarre and strange antics of the characters and those around them had a Lancashire/Cheshire lean with mangles, chimneys and soot ever present. The Fosdyke Saga was the story of Roger Ditchley, a wastrel son of tripe magnate, Old Ben Ditchley, who was deliberately disinherited by his father in favour of Jos Fosdyke. Roger, blinded by rage, seeks to regain his rightful inheritance over the next twelve years. His wicked plans are always thwarted as he enlists the most inept allies and twisted methods to attain his goal. The Fosdyke's themselves pursue the tripe business in various ways (such as selling alcoholic tripe in the USA during Prohibition) while the many Fosdyke children grow up and have adventures of their own, including joining the Royal Flying Corps during World War 1. Each book included bizarre settings such as the rugby game between a Welsh choir and a lady's casual rugby team held in a Salford hotel (the stairs collapsed in the first half), the hunt for the Tripe Naughtee and the unforgettable \\"Brain of Salford\\" competition. The series was axed from the Daily Mirror in 1985, the year after tycoon Robert Maxwell had purchased Mirror Group Newspapers. Created by well-known cartoonist Bill Tidy, who also produced cartoons for the satirical magazine Private Eye and created The Cloggies, the wry humour in this classic 1970s comic strip was very popular, if often unintelligible to those outside of the mid-north-west of England. Adaptations The Fosdyke Saga has been adapted as a TV series, a radio serial by the BBC and a stage play. The radio adaptation starred (among others) Miriam Margolyes, Enn Reitel, Christian Rodska and David Threlfall.

One of the great James River Plantations, Curles Neck has remained in active use for almost 400 years and remains a privately owned working farm which is not currently open to the public. As \\"Curles Neck Farm\\", a 5600-acre property was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2009. and Accompanying six photos at Virginia Historic Landmarks Commission, undated  History  In November 1635, a year after the formal designation of Henrico County as one of 8 shires (or counties) in the Virginia Colony, a land patent for was granted to Captain Thomas Harris, who had apparently served under Sir Thomas Dale. The tobacco farm was referred to by early settlers as \\"Longfield\\", but soon thereafter became known as Curles Neck. Captain Harris served in the House of Burgesses at Jamestown as a Burgess for Curles Neck. The source of the name Curles Neck is unknown. Many people thought that the name derived from the meandering sweeping curves of the tidal James River in the area, which can clearly be seen by map. However, the family name of Curle is recorded in various grants over a span of one hundred years in the books at the State Land Registry Office. A prominent representative of that family was the patriot Wilson Roscow Curle of the Revolutionary era. = Seat of Nathaniel Bacon = In the early 1670s, the property was owned by Nathaniel Bacon. The colonists in outlying locations such as those in Henrico and the Northern Neck came into conflict with the Colony's Royal Governor, Sir William Berkeley over taking reprisal action for alleged thefts by the Native Americans. In 1676, the tension erupted into a conflict between the colonists known as Bacon's Rebellion. Governor Berkeley was forced to retreat from Jamestown to the join loyalists on the Eastern Shore. Bacon fell ill and died in Gloucester, and the rebellion fell apart. In the aftermath, two dozen colonists were tried and hanged by Governor Berkeley. After Nathaniel Bacon was found guilty of treason post-mortem, his property was confiscated by the Crown, and later resold to William Randolph. = Revolutionary and Civil War periods = During the mid-18th century, John Pleasants donated the first Quaker meeting house at Curles Neck and was one of the trustees appointed to represent the newly formed Town of Richmond. In 1771, his slaves were granted their freedom under the terms of his will. In 1852 Charles Senff, a New York sugar merchant, purchased the then 3,250 acre Curles tract from William Allen. He also purchased two adjoining farms increasing his holdings to over 5,000 acres. Seniff built the 15-room brick Georgian Revival mansion that exists today to replace the antebellum house which had fallen into disrepair during the Civil War. = 20th century = Industrialist C. K. G. Billings bought the property in 1913 and built it into one of the most important horse breeding farms in the country. The next owner, A. B. Ruddock, started Curles Neck Dairy, which began retail operations in 1933. By the mid 20th century Curles Neck Farm under the ownership of Fred Watkins who purchased the property in 1943 had become one of the largest dairy suppliers in the eastern United States. The company's plant in the Scott's Addition section of Richmond held processing and distribution facilities, and a small retail store. The operation lasted until 1980, and generations of school children toured the large dairy barns. Eastern Air Liner crash landing, Curles Neck Farm, 1951  Eastern Airliner crash landing On Thursday 19 July 1951 Eastern Airlines Flight 601 departed Newark International Airport bound for Miami International Airport at 14:15. As it passed Philadelphia, at 14:52, the Lockheed Constellation reached cruising altitude of 18000 feet. For the next 25 to 30 minutes violent turbulence accompanied by intermittent periods of hail were encountered. The flight continued past Philadelphia for a few minutes toward Dover and the captain made a turn to the west in an attempt to avoid as much of the storm area as possible. The flight broke out in a clear area at about 15:17. The flight was able to continue VFR and descended to 8,000 feet. A second squall was encountered in the vicinity of Lynchburg at 15:50. The aircraft was slowed to 185 mph IAS, light turbulence and buffeting were experienced. After breaking out of the storm at 15:54, the buffeting became so severe that the crew believed the aircraft would disintegrate before they could reach Byrd Field (now Richmond International Airport) to attempt an emergency landing. Airspeed was further reduced, but the buffeting continued. Two minutes later, and only a few miles short of the runway, the captain radioed an emergency and the flight descended. The captain recognized Curles Neck Farm, selected the largest field, and landed straight ahead with the flaps up and the landing gear retracted. He felt it inadvisable to make any turn, lower the flaps, or otherwise to change the flight configuration, since the cause of the severe buffeting was unknown. During the last few moments of flight, as the nose of the aircraft touched high corn in a field, the copilot and flight engineer cut all switches. A power line pole at the edge of the corn field was struck by the right wing as the aircraft passed under the wires. After passing over Curles Neck Road, a section of fence was torn down and the aircraft skidded 1,100 feet through a field, another fence, and finally came to rest in a pasture 265 feet from the second fence at 15:59. A localized fire developed outside of the No 4 engine, but was quickly extinguished by rain and the local fire department who arrived at the scene within a short time. There were no fatalities as a result of the crash landing, and the Civil Aeronautics Board determined the probable cause of the accident to be the in-flight opening of the hydraulic access door, which caused extreme buffeting of the aircraft and resulted in the captain's decision to make an emergency landing. The airframe was salvaged, and removed from Curles Neck aboard a barge that was towed down the James River. The aircraft was repaired and put back in service but was ultimately written off after suffering another accident in 1953.\\"Accident description: Eastern Airlines Flight 601.\\" Aviation Safety Network.

It is a procreation sonnet within the Fair Youth sequence. In the sonnet, the poet goes through a series of images of mortality, such as a clock, a withering flower, a barren tree and autumn, etc. Then, at the \\"turn\\" at the beginning of the third quatrain, the poet admits that the young man to whom the poem is addressed must go among the \\"wastes of time\\" just as all of the other images mentioned. The only way he can fight against Time, Shakespeare proposes, is by breeding and making a copy of himself.

The sonnet is one long sentence, which helps to show the theme of time and its urgency.Gibson, Rex, ed. Shakespeare: The Sonnets. Cambridge: Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 1997. Print. It also suggests that it is one full and rounded thought, rather than many different points. There are also many contrasts showing time's power such as the words, \\"lofty\\" and \\"barren\\" when describing the trees, alluding to time's power over all of nature. This sonnet also shows the power of time, in that it is deadly and not merciful. Shakespeare shows time's power by using the descriptive words of \\"white and bristly beard,\\" \\"violet past prime,\\" and \\"sable curls all silver'd o'er with white.\\" One last image to take note of is the fact that the only way to defy time is by creating new virtues and beauties. And to do this, Shakespeare tells the young man, is by creating descendants. This fact is shown in the volta, the last two lines of the sonnet, when Shakespeare says, \\"And nothing 'gainst time's scythe can make defence, / Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence.\\"  Structure  Sonnet 12 follows the structure of a typical Shakespearean sonnet.Saccio, Peter (1998). \\"Shakespeare: The Word and the Action Part I.\\" The Teaching Company. Chantilly, VA. Print. pp. 8. It consists of 14 lines of which 12 belong to three quatrains and the last two belong to the couplet, with rhyme scheme ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Reflecting this structure, the first three quatrains develop an argument of despair, and the couplet suggests a (somewhat) hopeful resolution. However, the argument of the poem may also be seen as reflecting the older structure of the Petrarchan sonnet: lines one through eight are the octaveSaccio, Peter (1998). \\"Shakespeare: The Word and the Action Part I.\\" The Teaching Company. Chantilly, VA. Print. pp 10. which concerns the decay that occurs in nature, and these lines are connected through alliteration.Vendler, Helen (1997). The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. Lines nine through fourteen form a rhetorical sestet concerning the decay of the beloved. The first line is often cited as (appropriately) displaying a metronomic regularity: × / × / × / × / × / When I do count the clock that tells the time, :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. × = nonictus.  Critical analysis  The sonnet's position in the sequence at number 12 coincides with the 12 hours on a clock-face. Sonnet 12 also represents the first time in which the speaker's first person pronoun, \\"I\\" (also a mark on a clock's face), dominates the poem, indicating the beginning of his voice's ascendancy in the unfolding drama of the sequence.Vendler, H. The Art of Shakespeare's Sonnets, Salem Press 1998 p96-100. Helen Vendler proposes the poem holds two models of time: one of gradual decay, and one of an aggressive emblem-figure of Time with his scythe. These ideas call up two approaches of Death: one sad and innocent in which everything slowly wastes away, growing barren and aged, and one in which the reaper actively cuts them down and takes them away as if life had been murdered. As Vendler notes, the first 12 lines of the poem are associated with the innocent death of decay with time. Carl Atkins adds to this, describing how much of the imagery used is transmuted from lively, growing identities to macabre indifference, such as \\"the harvest-home .. into a funeral, and the wagon laden with ripened corn becomes a bier bearing the aged dead\\".Atkins, Carl. Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press 2007. Print. p. 53-54. These lines bring Time's aging decay into the spotlight as a natural and inexorable force in the world. The crux of Vendler's analysis comes out of the phrase 'Sweets and Beauties' in line 11. She notes that the word \\"Beauties\\" is clearly a reference back to the earlier lines containing aesthetic beauties that wither away with time, and that \\"Sweets\\" has a deeper, moral context. She holds that Beauties are outward show and Sweets are inward virtues, and that both fade with the passage of time. An example of one of the 'beauties' with a virtuous provision can be found on line 6 in the 'virtuous generosity of the canopy sheltering the herd'. In Vendler's interpretation, the act of the canopy providing the herd with shelter from the elements is given freely, without expectation or need of anything in return. Such an act is classified as generosity and so is virtuous by nature. Atkins agrees, also noting that the \\"Sweet\\" favor of the canopy will share the same fate as the beauties, fading with time as the leaves disappear. Michael Schoenfeldt's scholarly synopsis of the sonnet focuses on Vendler's analysis of the anthropomorphizing of the autumnal mortality, in particular the use of stark, particular words (barren, bier, beard) to replace, with anthropomorphic emphasis, more common descriptors (shed, corn, gathered, wagon, awn).Schoenfeldt, M. A Companion to Shakespeare's Sonnets, Blackwell Pub. 2007 pp 44-45. He views these careful linguistic choices to be essential in understanding the grim theme underlying beauty's demise. In the latter portion of her analysis, Vendler proposes a third, voluntary approach to death. All the natural images used in the poem point to including death as part of the cycle of life and imply that some things must embrace death willingly to allow for new growth to flourish. The speaker goes on to associate breeding and procreation with a new supply of budding virtue in the final lines of the poem. This surrender of beauty and the proliferation of virtue is implied as the way to triumph over Time and Death, and is the primary message from the speaker.

Munson, a Detroit businessman commissioned as a special representative of the State Department, on the sympathies and loyalties of Japanese Americans living in California and the West Coast of the United States. Munson's report was submitted to the White House on October 7, 1941, exactly two months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. The report was presented to FDR on November 7, 1941. By spring of 1941, it was increasingly apparent that Japan and the United States would become enveloped in conflict. They all fought in World War II. It had broken out with the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 and the German invasion of Poland in 1939. In July 1941, the United States, along with Britain and the Dutch East Indies, had imposed a total embargo on exports to Japan, including critical oil supplies. American military intelligence had broken top secret Japanese military codes, and a September 24, 1941, message indicated that Pearl Harbor was a possible target of a Japanese attack. President Franklin D. Roosevelt immediately designated Munson as a special representative and gave him the task of gauging the loyalty of Japanese Americans, many of whom lived on military bases and important manufacturing facilities.Leslie T. Hatamiya, Righting a Wrong: Japanese Americans and the Passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 (1994). Stanford, p. 10. Munson toured California and the Pacific Coast and interviewed Army and United States Marines intelligence officers, military commanders, city officials, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Munson found that \\"There is some Japanese problems on the West Coast, but it has not yet reached a state in which we should fear them as a country\\" concluding that there was \\"a remarkable, even extraordinary degree of loyalty among some of this generally suspect ethnic group, but there were some Issei that remained loyal to their home country, Japan, and its Emperor.\\" The Munson Report was circulated to several Cabinet officials, including Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, Attorney General Francis Biddle, and Secretary of State Cordell Hull. On January 9, 1942, Stimson sent a copy of the Munson Report to President Roosevelt, along with a memo stating that War Department officials had carefully studied the document. However, Executive Order 9066, ordering the internment of Japanese Americans, was signed on February 19. It is not known whether Roosevelt was influenced by the report itself, but he undoubtedly heard a multiplicity of suspicions.Nancy R. Bartlit and Everett M.

With an average altitude of 1236 feet above sea level, it has a very temperate climate similar to that of Jos, Plateau State. The highest peak is a very large monolith often called the Oruku rock. Description The town is made up of four clans: Anni, Egbetua, Okhe and Ikpena. With an approximated population of 100,000 and a combined population density of 5,111 per 7 km radius, it is one of the largest towns in the Local Government Area. Ososo has a unique dialect of the Ghotuo- Uneme-Yekhee branch of the Edoid linguistic lineage. Ososo shares boundaries with Okene to the north, Okpella to the East, Makeke to the west, Ojah to the South and Ogori to the north-west. It is a boundary town between Edo and Kogi States. History  According to oral tradition, the people of Ososo migrated from “Ogbe” in present-day Benin City in the 17th century during the era of fierce and violent inter-tribal wars between Benin kingdom and its neighbours and due to general disenchantment with the harsh economic realities of their day. The migration took the people first to Idah in Kogi state. Not comfortable with the people there they moved on to Ajaokuta, there to Uname - Orugbe by the river Niger and finally to Idoani in Ososo from where they expanded down from the rocks to the present location. The early settlers were attracted to Ososo because of its rocks, caves, temperate climate, springs and fertile lands. We can not rule out an affiliation with Kogi state when you look at the traditional chiefs' mode of dressing with the long red cap called oji and the name Tokura which is a title in Igala. The expansion of descendant family lineage brought about the present four clans that now comprise the town. Although there are many common family names in Ososo, a few include Akpologun, Buoro, Otaru, Ogidan, Orifa, Okogbe, Okareh, Ogedengbe, Salami, Adacha, Aiyejina, Itomo, Ayedogbon, Osheku, Obaitan, Bodunde, Arokamoni (or Arokhamoni), Okpelle, Alabi, Agbaje, Ogboriefor, Okole, Ogbokhoyani, Olanrewaju, and so on. Tourism  Rocks of Ososo. Ososo town is of granitic nature, with some elevations of volcanic origin containing precious stones of varied descriptions. Located on a plateau of dispersed rocks and undulating hills, the town continues to be a haven for tourists. Because of its rocks and climate, some Europeans established a quarry company north of the town, known as BOK Quarry some years ago. The rocks and hills of varied sizes and shapes occupy the plateau with the natural magical posture of a thousand models posing to nature's camera. The colonial administrations as early as the 19th century recognised the tourist potential of Ososo and built the then Rest House which was a sought after holiday haven for most of the white people working in Nigeria at that time. The military administrator of Edo State Mohammed Abul-Salam Onuka (1993–1994) made some attempt to develop the tourist potential of Ososo. Some other governments have attempted to raise the status of the then rest house to Tourist Centre, but attempts have not yielded the expected results. However, the tourism potentials of Ososo received a boost recently as Nigerian Breweries PLC (makers of Gulder larger beer), relaunch their 2011 Gulder Ultimate Search Season 8, in Egbetua, Ososo. Ososo town is on the boundary between Edo and Kogi States, and in a hilly and rocky area. It lies about 40 kilometres from Igarra and 200 kilometres from Benin city in Edo State. There is a non-catering Rest House on top of a hill at Ososo, which has views of parts of Kogi State to as far as the river Niger. An amusement park is being developed as part of the resort which has temperate weather for long periods in the year. From the tourist centre, a rest house renovated by the Edo state government, there are views all the way to Kogi state.

Efacec group is the worldwide leader in the fast-charging infrastructure market for electric vehicles.  History  Efacec is a Portuguese company that emerged, in 1948, from the union of the belgian group ACEC (Ateliers de Construtions Électriques de Charleroi) and CUF (Companhia União Fabril), one of the largest Portuguese business groups at the time. The Efacec project history begins, however, in 1905, with the foundation of a new company named Modern, Mechanical Sawing Society. In 1917, during the First World War, Efacec produced the first electric motors manufactured in Portugal. In 1921 The Electro-Moderna, Lda. was founded, which is the company basis for starting the Manufacturing Company of Electrical Machines, SARL. This enterprise was founded in 1948, with the capital distributed among the Electro-Moderna, ACEC, CUF and other shareholders. This recent manufacturer, headed by Antonio Ricca Gonçalves, was the starting point of Efacec project and the birth of Efacec as a brand. In 1958, the ACEC bought the CUF Group position, becoming the majority shareholder, a situation that remains after 1969, when Efacec were introducing into the stock exchange. Between 1966 and 1973, Efacec increased 2,5 times its manufacturing area and 6 times its order demand. In 1976 Efacec begins its operations in the drive systems area and hands over the first three-phase transformer of 420 kV, 315 MVA, with 450 tons of weight, the biggest three-phase unity built in Portugal. In 1981 Efacec registered 4 million escudos in internal and external sales. In 1990, this number rises to 25 million and, in 1998, for 48 million. In 1998, Efacec reaches 237,753 million Euros, having the external market reached 84,046 million Euros and a result before taxes of 6 million Euros. In 1999, Manuel Gonçalves Textile (MGT) enters the company's capital, with 10.682% of voting right. On 2 March 2000, the José de Mello Group (JMG) acquired to IPE a position of 10.56% of the Efacec voting rights. This is how the CUF Group heritage reappears, 42 years later, in the Efacec history. In 2003, Efacec defines three great areas of activity as a result of the strategic assessment that deserved the agreement of its shareholders: Energy Solutions, Transport Solutions and Engineering Services Solutions. In September 2005, Manuel Gonçalves Textile and José de Mello launched a takeover bid on the Efacec capital, despite its actions still dispersed in stock exchanges. In 2007, with the support of its two shareholders (JMG and MGT), Efacec develops a new organizational model with ten business units: Transformers; High and Medium Voltage Switchgear; Energy Servicing; Engineering; Automation; Maintenance; Environment; Renewable; Transports and Logistics. Between 2007 and 2010, the company’s turnover exceeds a thousand million euros. Efacec purchase several companies around the world and start multiple projects, such as the construction of a new power transformer plants in the USA. By the end of 2014, Efacec Power Solutions has become a group of companies that meet all the production resources, technologies and technical skills and human resource for the development of activities in the fields of Energy Solutions, Engineering, Environment, Transport and Electric Mobility, covering a vast network of subsidiaries, branches and agents across the four continents. On 23 October 2015, Winterfell Industries acquires the majority stake of Efacec Power Solutions. Efacec previous shareholders, José de Mello Group and Manuel Gonçalves Textile, became minority shareholders and new corporate bodies were elected. In early 2016, the Matosinhos group launched the Efacec 2020 program with the aim of \\"rethinking the group in its different aspects, namely products and services, skills, markets, customers, organization and governance model\\".By 2020 Efacec Power Solutions wants to grow in business volume and be among the three leading brands in the field of innovation and technology. In that year, Efacec closed the last financial year with profits of 4.3 million euros, against losses of 20.5 million euros. Efacec's revenues in 2016 stood at 431.5 million euros, up 15.5 million from the previous year, with exports accounting for 76% of the total. In August 2017, Efacec won an international project for the construction of a subway at Odense, in Denmark, in order to develop all the electromechanic elements. This project will be developed alongside COMSA and MUNCK and, for Efacec, the value of this deal is approximately 47 million euros, which reflects the dimension and integration of the solutions offered by this company. Efacec already had experience in this business area, having been involved in the construction of subways in Bergen, Norway, Dublin, Ireland, and Porto, Portugal, being it that the European market corresponds to half its turnover. In October 2018, Efacec won one of the most important tenders in the area of level crossings in Europe. The tender was launched by Trafikverket, the entity responsible for managing Sweden’s railroad and road infrastructure, and it looked to the development, certification and supply of new generation automatic level crossing protection systems. Following this international tender, Efacec, alongside a local partner, sealed the deal in a business with an estimated value of five million euros per year. This became the biggest export contract in this segment for Efacec. In February 2019, one year after the opening of Efacec’s Electric Mobility Unit, this business area grew approximately 100% in turnover (17 vs. 36 million euros), it employed over 100 people and tripled its production capacity for electric vehicle fast and ultra-fast chargers. Electric Mobility represents, at the start of 2019, 6% of Efacec’s total activity.

History  = West Pass Transportation Company = Around the turn of the 20th century outlying communities all over Puget Sound, particularly those on the many islands, were dependent on small boats and ships for delivering goods and basic transportation. The primary shipping lane from Seattle to Tacoma was along the east side of Vashon Island. Farmers and business people along Colvos Passage in Kitsap County and on the west side of Vashon Island were very dissatisfied with the unreliable boat service they received. In 1910 Captain Nelse \\"Nels\\" Christensen and John Holm formed the West Pass Transportation Company and purchased their own boat to serve this part of the island. The boat they bought was Virginia Merrill, a long gasoline-powered tug. She was renamed simply Virginia and converted for use as a small ferry. = The Virginia boats = Virginia was replaced in 1912 with Virginia II, a long ship propelled by a Corliss gasoline engine. In 1914 the West Pass Transportation Company purchased the steam ship Typhoon and renamed her Virginia III. In 1918 they purchased the steam ship Tyrus, and in 1920 they renamed her Virginia IV and put her on the West Pass route. = Construction of Virginia V = In 1921, Anderson & Company of Maplewood, Washington, began construction of Virginia V. The ship was built of local old-growth fir. She was launched 9 March 1922, and towed to downtown Seattle for the installation of her engine and steam plant. In Seattle the engine was removed from Virginia IV and installed in Virginia V. On 11 June 1922, Virginia V made her maiden voyage from Elliott Bay in Seattle to Tacoma down the West Pass. She continued to make this voyage nearly every day until 1938. = Storm of 1934 = Heavy damage to Virginia V caused by October 1934 storm On 21 October 1934, a severe Pacific storm swept through the Puget Sound. Virginia V was attempting to dock at Olalla, Washington, when the brunt of the storm hit. The powerful winds pushed the ship against the dock as the waves pounded the ship into the pilings. The result was the near destruction of the upper decks. The ship was re-built at the Lake Washington Shipyard at Houghton, near modern-day Kirkland, Washington. She was returned to service on 5 December 1934. = Camp Sealth and the Camp Fire Girls = Each summer from 1922 to 1970 (with a few interruptions around World War II) Virginia V carried girls to and from Seattle to Camp Sealth on Vashon Island for the Camp Fire Girls. Thousands of women in the Northwest recall a ride on Virginia Vee (as she was affectionately called) as the beginning of a camping adventure. = Columbia River service and bankruptcy = The West Pass Transportation Company went out of business in 1942. Virginia V, which had been operating for a while on the Seattle-Fort Worden run, was transferred to the Columbia River, where for a brief time she was placed on the Portland-Astoria run, thus becoming the last scheduled passenger vessel running on both Puget Sound and the Columbia River. Her Columbia River career was unsuccessful. Her owners were unable to pay her crew and she was libeled (legally seized for debts owed) and sold at Vancouver, Washington by the U.S. Marshals to pay her owner's debts.Newell, Gordon R., ed. H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, pp. 508-509, Superior Publishing, Seattle, Washington 1966 Virginia V was purchased by O.H. \\"Doc\\" Freeman and Joe Boles of Seattle. They resold the vessel to Jack Katz and Captain Howell Parker less than a year later. = Captain Howell Parker and The Great Steamboat Race = Captain Parker operated Virginia V carrying war workers between Poulsbo, Washington, and the Keyport Naval Torpedo Station with his wife Mary as steward and purser. After the end of World War II, the Parkers continued to operate her as an excursion vessel all around Puget Sound. In 1948 the Puget Sound Maritime Historical Society (PSMHS) was formed to preserve the Northwest's marine history. As a publicity event, the PSMHS sponsored a race between Virginia V and a similar ship, Grayline Sightseer (formerly Vashona) to be held on National Maritime Day. The Great Steamboat Race began on May 22 at 2PM. At the end of a course that ran across the Seattle waterfront, Virginia V won the race by a small margin. = Puget Sound Excursion Lines = Virginia V, on Puget Sound, about June, 1983 In 1954 Virginia V was sold to Captain Phillip Luther of Puget Sound Excursion Lines. Captain Luther sold her to Charles McMahon in 1956. McMahon extensively refurbished Virginia V, and then continued to operate her as a commercial excursion vessel around Puget Sound. In 1958 James F. \\"Cy\\" Devenny purchased controlling interest in Puget Sound Excursion Company and took over operation of Virginia V along with several other small vessels. Among these was the McNeil Island federal prison tender J.E. Overlade (ex Arcadia), built in 1928, herself one of the last survivors of the Mosquito Fleet. Devenny renamed her Virginia VI to match her more famous running mate.McCurdy, p. 509 = Northwest Steamship Company = In 1968 a group of steamboat enthusiasts formed the Northwest Steamship Company, and raised the funds to buy Virginia V from Puget Sound Excursion Company. The ship was placed on the National Registry of Historic Sites in 1973, but despite her recognition as historically significant, it was increasingly difficult for her owners to maintain her as a commercial venture. = Steamer Virginia V Foundation = In 1976 the non-profit Steamer Virginia V Foundation was formed to preserve Virginia V. The Foundation acquired her on 30 September 1980, for $127,000. = Major restoration 1995-2001 = Virginia V, September 2007 In 2002, the Foundation was able to put Virginia V back in service after a six-year, $6.5 million stem-to-stern restoration project. It included a rebuild of the steam engine, construction of a new boiler and rebuild of the superstructure using traditional tongue and groove fir planking. The Foundation was honored in 2001 with the Washington State Historical Society's \\"David Douglas Award\\" for the restoration work completed to-date. = Present day = Since 2002 the Virginia V has been providing public excursions, private charters, and visits to local maritime festivals throughout Puget Sound. Engine and boiler Triple-expansion steam engine of the Virginia V. Drip lubricator. The triple- expansion, double-acting, reciprocating steam engine is the original, installed in 1922 when it was taken from Virginia IV (formerly Tyrus). The parts were cast in 1904 at the Heffernan Engine Works in downtown Seattle as one of two identical engines built for the Army. The first engine was assembled and installed in the US Army Quartermaster Steamer Evan Thomas. Virginia Vs engine was assembled and installed in Tyrus in 1907. *Indicated Horsepower: *Maximum RPM: Approximately 200 *Cylinder Bore (Diameter): , , and (HP, IP, and LP respectively) *Stroke: The original Stoddert oil-fired, water- tube boiler was replaced in 2000 with a new Babcock & Wilcox oil-fired water- tube boiler of similar configuration. Virginia V always used oil as her fuel. The ship originally burned heavy bunker fuel. She was converted to burn #2 Diesel fuel in 2002. In recent years, the engine has developed a noise, referred to as \\"The Squeak\\". While the cause of this noise is not definitively known, it is presumed to come from the low pressure valve. There are no physical indications of scuffing, galling, or damage to components indicating a metal-to-metal contact. The squeak is more pronounced as the engine warms up, and goes away as the engine speed increases. The problem has so vexed the engineers that they have started a tongue-in-cheek fund, whereby visitors are required to donate $1 to the repair fund if they wish to talk to an engineer about it. (This fund may also be diverted to a beer fund, at the discretion of the engineer.) *Working Pressure: *Capacity: per hour of steam *Fuel: #2 Diesel Oil *Fuel Consumption: Approximately per hour  See also  *Historic preservation *List of National Historic Landmarks in Washington (state) *List of U.S. National Historic Landmark ships, shipwrecks, and shipyards *List of Puget Sound steamboats References *M.S.

Her most famous roles include starring as Virginia in Marty, as Mrs Lane in Ride Lonesome, and as Eve McHuron in the Star Trek episode \\"Mudd's Women\\". Biography =Early life= Steele was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, to Percy Davis Steele, a Bostonian of English descent and a career Marine who in 1956 was named assistant administrator of the Marshall Islands. Her mother, Ruth Covey Merritt, was a Californian of French and Danish heritage. Steele's childhood in the Hawaiian Islands brought her into contact with the Japanese and Polynesian languages, as well as English.Karen Steele profile, glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com; accessed December 29, 2016. When she was 13 years old, a surfing accident resulted in Steele's leg being cut by coral segments. She later developed osteomyelitis in the leg with infection so severe that amputation was seriously considered until a doctor brought to Hawaii from Hong Kong ended the infection. The leg had to be rebuilt with wires and metal, but after 22 operations she began rehabilitation to resume walking. Steele attended the University of Hawaii and studied acting at Rollins College in Florida for a year. After that, she found work as a cover girl and model. =Career= With Roger Smith in 77 Sunset Strip, 1959 Steele's first acting job was on the radio program Let George Do It. She subsequently appeared in the films The Clown (in an uncredited role, 1953) and Man Crazy (also 1953) as Marge. The following year, she landed the role of Millie Darrow in \\"So False and So Fair\\" on the television anthology Studio 57, but a supporting role in Marty (1955) was her highest profile film role. She played Virginia and got the part because director Delbert Mann had confused her with an actress from New York whom he and writer Paddy Chayefsky had intended to play it.Profile , tacky-times.com; accessed December 29, 2016. In 1957, she guest starred on the TV program Maverick, as Molly Gleason in the episode \\"Point Blank\\" opposite James Garner and Mike Connors.In 1958, she played the titular role in the episode \\"Madame Faro\\" of NBC's Jefferson Drum, a western series. Steele made two guest appearances on CBS's Perry Mason, as Doris Stephanek in \\"The Case of the Haunted Husband\\" (1958) and as murder victim Carina Wileen in \\"The Case of the Fatal Fetish\\" (1965). She appeared as Mae Dailey in the 1961 episode \\"Big Time Blues\\" on the ABC/Warner Brothers drama, The Roaring 20s. Earlier, she was cast in a guest-starring role in another ABC/WB series, The Alaskans. In 1962, she portrayed the part of Dolly LeMoyne in the episode \\"The Woman Trap\\" on CBS's Rawhide. Her character in \\"Survival of the Fattest\\", a 1965 episode of NBC's Get Smart, was named Mary 'Jack' Armstrong, said to be \\"the strongest female enemy agent in the world\\".Profile, allmovie.com; accessed December 29, 2016. This is a reference to Jack Armstrong, the clean-cut fictional hero of Jack Armstrong the All American Boy, an adventure series broadcast on radio from 1933 to 1951. She appeared in an early episode of Star Trek (Mudd's Women, 1966). Like many actresses, as she got older, she turned to television commercials for income. She also became involved in charitable causes and community service. In early 1970, she went on a handshake tour of service hospitals in the South Pacific, rather than accept a series that would have paid her $78,000. As a result, she lost her agent. =Personal life= In later life, she settled in Golden Valley, Arizona, and married Dr. Maurice Boyd Ruland, a psychiatrist at the Mohave Mental Health Clinic. They were married until her death from cancer at age 56 at the Kingman Regional Medical Center in Kingman, Arizona.

This was Brandon Lee's first leading role in a film (he made his acting debut with a supporting role in the television film Kung Fu: The Movie earlier that year) and the only Hong Kong production he starred in. Plot Brandon Ma (Brandon Lee) is a regular guy with a job and a girlfriend May (Regina Kent). He has two jobs, so he can support his girlfriend and his dream of owning a motorcycle. Brandon's best friend is Michael Wan (Michael Wong), an ambitious and murderous drug dealer. Michael also loves May and so he comes up with a plan using a corrupt police officer named Sharky (Lam Chung) that will win her for himself and get Brandon out of his way. It seems that the corrupt cop has been using his police connections to dominate the local cocaine trade, so Michael has him killed and uses Brandon as the fall guy. Brandon goes to jail and meets Hoi (Mang Hoi), although he thinks that he will be released soon thanks to the efforts of his good buddy Michael. However, after 8 long years, Brandon finally gets out of jail and vows revenge on Michael for betraying their friendship and stealing the love of his life. Whilst out of prison he learns that May has had his son. With the help of Hoi, Brandon tracks down Michael. Whilst engaging his guards he learns that May is dead. After killing Michael's guards, Brandon confronts and kills his former friend Michael. The movie ends with Brandon bidding farewell to his friend Hoi (who aided him in fighting Michael's guards) and leaving with his son.

In the US the film was released directly to Home media in 1998 after the passing Lee its leading star.  Reception  Upon its 1986 Hong Kong release Lee was nominated for a Hong Kong Film Award for Best New Performer in this role. In May of the following year, it was a critical success at the Cannes Film Festival and commercial one in Japan. In the Philippines, the film was number one in the country for its first five days and became a local success. At one point between its Hong Kong release and the 1992 making of Lee's first lead an American Studio film the action thriller Rapid Fire, producer Robert Lawrence screened Legacy of Rage and saw Lee's potential to be an action leading man in Hollywood, which led to their collaboration. When the film was launched in 1998 in the US, the Hong Kong action film was described as his best genre film. In News-Press, film critic Randy Myers gave it three stars describing it as a stylish, but good early film. He added that aside from its flaws it was fast paced, energetic, and Brandon showcased a lot of talent. Paul Harris of The Age gave it two stars saying it gives a glimmer into the largely unexplored talent of actor Brandon Lee, but found it wasn't up to par with The Crow due to the formulaic plot. Rob Lowing of The Sydney Morning Herald gave it three star, saying it had a generic story but praised Lee's good performance and Ronny Yu's stylish direction.

There were no Alberta-based First Nations groups signing on, but there were two First Nation bands from Manitoba, despite their location outside the designated treaty area. It is notable that despite appeals from peoples of unceded areas of Northern Manitoba and the Northwest Territories for treaty negotiations to begin, the government did not enter into the treaty process for almost 20 years. In 1879, Natives of Stanley, Lac la Ronge, and Pelican Narrows petitioned for a treaty due to the threat of starvation. In 1905, the granting of Saskatchewan with Provincial status galvanized the government to settle the issue of land rights in order to free up land for future government use. The Canadian government signed Treaty 10 with the First Nations. The territory covered almost 220,000 square kilometers and included Cree and Chipewyan First Nation tribe population. Like the other treaties, it requires the First Nations to surrender their Aboriginal Title for land claim and rights. The agreement was drafted based on the Treaty 8 text. Commissioner J. A. J. McKenna offered medical and education incentives to the affected First Nations, with commitments that their traditional food gathering practices would not be impaired by the reserve system. In recompense for how long his peoples had been requesting treaty, William Apisis, chief of the English River Band, made an unheard of request for annuity payments to be paid in arrears, dating back to the time of the first treaties. This request was denied.

Found on Fairbottom Street in the town centre, Oldham's Coliseum is a repertory theatre which celebrated its centenary in 1987. Its interior makes it a great period classic in theatre terms, and has seen the likes of local performers such as Eric Sykes, Charlie Chaplin, Dame Thora Hird and Dora Bryan tread its boards. The history of the theatre can be traced back to 1885. It was originally intended to be a permanent home for the Great American Circus, then based on Henshaw Street, but the owner of the circus, Mr Myers, was unable to pay for the completed work. Following a court case, ownership of the building was granted to Thomas Whittaker, the carpenter who had performed the work. Whittaker decided to open the Coliseum as a theatre and the first production was called Culver's Circus. Other notable owners of the theatre include Paul Yates, founder and owner of Yates' Wine Lodge. During its time, the Coliseum has opened and closed doors on numerous occasions. In 1911, in a bid to compete with the rising trend of cinema, the theatre began to show silent films in between productions. In 1918, it was bought by Dobie's Electric Theatres. In 1931 it was converted into a cinema, but its life a cinema was short-lived as the recession of 1932 hit hard and it closed its doors within 12 months. It stood empty until 1939 when a local group called The Oldham Playgoers Club were successful enough to sign the lease on the building and stage their own productions. The theatre is said to be one of the most haunted theatres in Britain. In 1947, actor Harold Norman, who was non- suspicious and refused to follow theatrical tradition when it came to The Scottish Play, died after being stabbed by a sword whilst playing the title character in Macbeth. The theatre was features in a 2004 episode of the TV series Most Haunted. The theatre was renovated in 2012.

He is best known for establishing the so-called Nuremberg School. Life He was the son of Hans Staden and Elisabeth Löbelle. The exact date of his birth is unknown; it is believed that he was born in Nuremberg in 1581 (the date on the only surviving portrait) and records show that a certain Johannes Starnn was baptised in July 1581. At 18 Staden was already quite famous and serving as organist of one of the city churches; by 1604 he was employed as court organist in Bayreuth; he got married the same year. In 1605 the court moved to Kulmbach, where Staden remained until 1610, publishing two collections of secular songs, Neue teutsche Lieder (1606) and Neue teutsche geistliche Gesäng (1609). He may have visited Bayreuth again in 1610 and returned to Nuremberg by 1611, the year his daughter was baptised there. In June 1612 he left Nuremberg again to succeed Hans Leo Hassler as court organist in Dresden. He stayed until around 1614/15, becoming organist at Nuremberg's Spitalkirche on 20 June 1616. Later that year he moved to the Lorenzkirche, succeeding Kaspar Hassler. Finally, in 1618 he accepted the most prestigious musical position in Nuremberg: organist at the Church of Saint Sebald (Sebalduskirche). He held that post until his death in 1634. Works and influence Much of Staden's work survives in printed collections. His first published works were the secular songs of Neue teutsche Lieder (1606), another Neue teutsche Lieder (1609) and Venus Kräntzlein (1610); the songs feature simplistic rhythms, are harmonically simple and feature little to no imitative counterpoint. The same can be said about his sacred songs, which he also published several collections of. Other sacred music is of considerably greater interest: Harmoniae sacrae (1616) contains some of the earliest German sacred concertos, introducing the concepts of an obligatory basso continuo, independent instrumental accompaniment and the solo concerto to Nuremberg's tradition; these features are also seen in other collections of sacred choral music. The basic style, however, remained that of the motet. Staden's instrumental music consists of around 200 pieces, including not only various dance forms but also some of the first German instrumental sonatas. These pieces could have been written for a group of performers named Nuremberg Musikkränzlein. Staden was highly acclaimed as a teacher; he was instrumental in creating the Nuremberg tradition and his most important pupil, Johann Erasmus Kindermann, would carry that tradition through Georg Caspar Wecker and Heinrich Schwemmer to the Krieger brothers and, ultimately, to Johann Pachelbel, who studied under both Wecker and Schwemmer. Other pupils of Staden included three of his sons (Johann, Adam and Sigmund Theophil Staden) and miscellaneous lesser Nuremberg composers. Apart from establishing the so-called Nuremberg school through training young musicians, Staden's activities in Nuremberg during the 1620s-30s included evaluating new music dedicated to the city (this included Samuel Scheidt's Geistliche Concerten of 1634).

The Garden was initially funded by a donation from the Charles Felix Lindberg Foundation, in special memory of himself. Lindberg was a Swedish businessman and donor, who died in 1909. The Gothenburg City Council took the initiative to the Botanical Garden in 1912. The decision was finally taken in 1915 and work started in 1916. The park was opened to the public in 1919 (the Woodlands) and in 1923 (the cultivated areas). It was first planned as ”a field for experimentation and biological demonstrations, and a nature park”. Stora Änggården was built in 1812 and renovated under the supervision of the architect Sigfrid Ericson in 1919 and is now used as staff residence. The Gothenburg Botanical Garden was inaugurated in 1923 when Gothenburg celebrated its 300th anniversary. One of the prominent botanists who created the garden was Carl Skottsberg, who made several research trips around the globe to collect the rare plants of the garden. He was appointed as the first director, and worked from 1919 until 1948. The road outside the Main Entrance is named after him (Carl Skotttsbergs gata). Donations from many sources have played a vital role in the financing of the garden, including financing the construction of the Office Building. The Office Building was designed by the Swedish architect Arvid Bjerke and completed in 1926. A wing was added in 1936 to house the herbarium. Land was donated by the City and by private persons. An adjacent plot of land was donated by the City to Gothenburg University for the construction of the Department of Biology and Environmental Sciences buildings, to the right seen from the Main Entrance. They were designed by the architects Stig Hansson and Walter Kiessling and completed in 1971. In 1975 The Woodlands containing the arboretum with a collection of exotic trees were declared as a Nature reserve in 1975 and was named Änggårdsbergen. The City of Gothenburg handed over the operation of the Garden to Region Västra Götaland Regional Council in 1998. Description Map of Gothenburg Botanical Garden. 1\\\\. Entrance area, 2.

The garden proper is about 40 hectares and there are 16,000 different species. The Rock Garden has received two stars in the Michelin Green Guide. Other sights worth seeing are The Rhododendron Valley, the Japanese Glade and the greenhouses with about 4,000 various plants, including some 1,500 orchids, a remarkable tufa apartment and the rare Easter Island Tree, Sophora toromiro. The park is unique in Sweden since it is independent of the city university. Currently it is one of the larger botanical gardens in Europe, with its 175 hectares, which include a wild nature reserve in the Änggårdsbergen hills. This reserve is also the site of the Garden’s arboretum with copses of trees from many parts of the world, in scientifically ordered collections. The cultivated part of the Garden is about 40 hectares in area, of which about half consists of beds of plants. There are also extensive lawns and shrubberies. The symbol of the garden is a white wood anemone. These flowers carpet the valleys of the Woodlands and the Nature Reserve in the spring. Park, greenhouses and buildings The topography of the botanical garden is very varied, much of it consisting of hilly terrain which lends itself naturally to boundaries drawn between different layouts with contrasting vegetation. The huge and dramatic rock garden with its 5,000 species from different continents is internationally acknowledged. Nearby is the greenly peaceful Japanese Glade where valuable plants can be seen that were collected and brought in the 1950s by former curator Tor Nitzelius straight from their wild habitats in East Asia to the botanical garden in Gothenburg. The Rock Garden at the Gothenburg Botanical Garden. The stock of over 500 species and cultivated varieties of Rhododendron offer a gorgeous, scented spectacle in the early summer. At different times of the year visitors may also enjoy the world’s largest collection of bulbs and tuberous plants brought here straight from their wild habitats. The pretty Herb Garden, the lush beds of perennials and not least the Kitchen Garden with its crop rotation and typically Swedish syringa arbour are all interesting in their special ways. The Gothenburg Botanical Garden has been well to the fore with a new outlook on how to grow annual plants; the so-called summer blooming concept. IMG 1455-Göteborgs botaniska.jpgPerennials.

This tree has become extinct in its natural habitat, but has survived in cultivated form thanks to the efforts of the Gothenburg Botanical Garden. Succulents in the greenhouse. The impressive yellow-painted country house Stora Änggården with its formal garden lies just beyond the greenhouses. It is used as a staff residence, as is the picturesque timbered Boatsman’s Cottage, also known as the Blue House. Built in 1794, it was originally situated in the old harbour area of Gothenburg, below Stigbergstorget in the residential area of Majorna. In 1917 it was taken down and rebuilt two years later in its present place near the Bamboo Thickets. The summerhouse in the Herb Garden is from the late eighteenth century. It was designed by the city engineer in Gothenburg Bengt Wilhelm Carlberg for the garden of his own country house, Kärralund. It was rebuilt in the botanical garden in 1959 after having stood for a time in a garden between the Röhsska Museum and the present-day HDK (School of Design and Crafts).

He was later promoted to the rank of Konteradmiral during World War II. Early years Fürbringer was born in Braunschweig and entered the Imperial German Navy as a Seekadett on 3 April 1907. Subsequently, he attended the Basic-Training and was assigned on Board of the School-Ship SMS Charlotte. He also attended the Naval-School and the other Special-Briefings and was promoted to the rank of Fähnrich zur See (Officer candidate). He then spent some time aboard the cruiser SMS Roon, sailing in the East Asia within the High Seas Fleet, before being transferred to the Heavy cruiser SMS Scharnhorst. During the time of his transfer, Fürbringer was promoted to the rank of Leutnant zur See on 28 September 1910. Spending another two years in Asia, Fürbringer returned home in November 1912 and subsequently he was selected for the U-Boat training. World War I He served aboard , but left prior to the U-20s sinking of in 1915. He exclusively commanded small, coastal U-boats, starting with in February 1915. He went on to command six subsequent UB and UC-type boats, during which time he was awarded the Iron Cross, Second and First class. He was a successful commerce raider, responsible for sinking 101 (mostly small, coastal) ships (totaling 97,881 GRT) and damaged five others (of 9,033 GRT). His last command was , which was depth-charged and rammed by on 19 July 1918. The Garrys commanding officer was Lieutenant Commander Charles Lightoller. In his postwar memoirs, Fürbringer accused Lightoller's crew of opening fire with revolvers and machine guns on the unarmed survivors after the sinking of UB-110. During the ensuing massacre, Fürbringer watched the skull of an 18-year old member of his crew being split open by a lump of coal hurled by a Royal Navy sailor. When Fürbringer attempted to help a wounded officer to swim, he was told, \\"Let me die in peace. The swine are going to murder us anyhow.\\" The shooting only ceased when the convoy the destroyer had been escorting and which contained many neutral- flagged ships, arrived on scene. He later recalled, \\"As if by magic the British now let down some life boats into the water.\\"Werner Fürbringer (1999), Fips: Legendary German U-Boat Commander, 1915-1918, Naval Institute Press, Annapolis. Pages 118-121. If Fürbringer's accusations were true, the Garry's commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Lightoller, committed a war crime under the Hague Convention of 1907, which explicitly forbade any killing of unarmed shipwreck survivors. 21 out of 34 crew members were killed during the sinking and alleged massacre, and Fürbringer was captured. He spent the rest of the war as a British prisoner of war.

Designer Toshio Iwai was inspired by his earlier interactive installation art piece titled Music Insects, to develop a video game at Nintendo between 1993 and late 1994. The completed product was never released by Nintendo, and the game's key elements were later developed into Maxis's 1996 PC game SimTunes. History Interactive media artist Toshio Iwai had built the installation art piece Music Insects, which he created during his time as an Artist in Residence at the San Francisco Exploratorium. Iwai's friend at Nintendo approached him, to convert his Music Insects concept into a video game in 1993. There, it was expanded into a four-piece product: one game and three creative titles. During its development from 1993 to 1994, it was previewed in several trade magazines with the name Sound Factory. A trademark for the name \\"Sound Fantasy\\" was filed by Nintendo of America on January 13, 1994 and abandoned on January 24, 1999. The resulting Super NES game Sound Fantasy was completed in 1994 and Iwai left his work at Nintendo in favor of another art residency. The September 1994 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly expected the game's release in September. It was intended to be bundled with the SNES Mouse and mouse pad (or for ¥6,800 alone) and would be packaged in a large box similar to Super NES games like Mario Paint and EarthBound. Though planned for worldwide release, the release of the finished product was canceled by Nintendo for unknown reasons. In April 2005, to celebrate the Japanese launch of Toshio Iwai's latest work, Electroplankton for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo opened an exhibit at Tokyo's Harajuku Station to focus on the new game and on Iwai himself. Nintendo made available for perusal the box art and manual for Sound Fantasy, but the game was not present. In August 2010, an exhibit titled The Man Called 'The God of Games' was shown in Harajuku in honor of Gunpei Yokoi (producer of Sound Fantasy). As part of this exhibit, Toshio Iwai hosted his own presentation called \\"The Genes of Gunpei Yokoi Inside of Me\\" where he displayed his works that had been inspired by Gunpei Yokoi: the Tenori-on musical instrument and the Sound Fantasy music game. Iwai brought the game cartridge and played it. A prototype version of the game was leaked online in April 2015. Gameplay The back of the US box art. Sound Fantasy contains eccentric concepts and untested game mechanics. Music games, especially on home consoles, were not popular in the early 1990s, and it wouldn't be until much later in the decade that they gained mainstream attention. The Sound Fantasy prototype contains four different games in one cartridge. Pix Quartet was inspired by Toshio Iwai's Music Insects. There are four insects of different colors, where the player can select different insect to each represent a different instrument. They crawl all over the screen, where the player can draw. Insects that crawl over a colored pixel make a note. Each color represents a different note for each insects. Sample Demos can be loaded to demonstrate the capabilities of this game. Beat Hopper contains three different modes: A-type, B-type and Training. A-type is a rhythm game in the style of Q-bert, where an insect on a pogo must make every block disappear after stepping on it as many times needed. Each block makes its own sound and the order does not matter. The player can improvise a song with each block. B-type requires the player to follow a path of blocks that appears every time the player touches one. The player must make as many steps as possible without losing three lives. Ice Sweeper indicates two modes: A-type and B-type. This game is a Breakout clone with a few new twists added after a few stages, such as four bats controlled by a single player. Star Fly is inspired by music boxes, where the player can set a sequence of stars in the sky, to compose a song. A higher star corresponds to a higher musical note. The player may set the speed and the tone. Reception Electronic Gaming Monthly said in 1993 that the prototype of Sound Factory is an \\"[i]nteresting edutainment game .. similar to Mario Paint\\". GamePro said in 1994, \\"What Mario Paint did for video, Sound Fantasy should do for audio.\\" 1up said that \\"Sound Fantasy made creative use of the mouse that was eventually released with Mario Paint ... [and is] essentially, a music-focused version of Mario Paint.\\" =Legacy= Having been inspired by their own independent discovery of the Music Insects art installation exhibit, Maxis eventually approached Toshio Iwai, and his gameplay elements seen in Pix Quartet were finally published in the form of the 1996 PC game SimTunes.

A Grade II* listed building, it has been described by the Theatres Trust as \\"One of the most important surviving examples of Georgian theatre architecture\\". It has a capacity for an audience of around 900. The Theatre Royal was built to replace the Old Orchard Street Theatre, funded by a Tontine and elaborately decorated. The architect was George Dance the Younger, with John Palmer carrying out much of the work. It opened with a performance of Shakespeare's Richard III and hosted performances by many leading actors of the time including Dorothea Jordan, William Macready and Edmund Kean. A major fire in 1862 destroyed the interior of the building and was quickly followed by a rebuilding programme by Charles J. Phipps, which included the construction of the current entrance. Further redecoration was undertaken in 1892; more extensive building work, including a new staircase and the installation of electric lighting, followed in 1902. Despite performances by casts including Sarah Bernhardt, the ballerina Anna Pavlova and Mrs. Patrick Campbell, the theatre was rarely very profitable. During World War II Donald Wolfit, Irene Vanbrugh, John Gielgud and Sybil Thorndike appeared, with shows including Noël Coward's Private Lives and Blyth Spirit, a performance by Ballet Rambert and light entertainment such as Charley's Aunt, but audiences declined. In 1979 the theatre was bought by a trust and, following public donations, it underwent refurbishment, with the rebuilding of the stage and the installation of a new taller fly tower for scenery and lighting. In 1997 a new 150-seat theatre, known as the Ustinov Studio, was opened. Further restoration work to the main auditorium was needed in 2010. In 2005 a children's theatre known as The Egg was opened. The complex also includes bars and restaurants. History The original entrance from Beauford Square. The fly tower which was added in 1980 can be seen above the façade. =Construction= The theatre was erected in 1805, replacing the Old Orchard Street Theatre which had obtained a royal patent in 1768 enabling the use of the title 'Theatre Royal', the first to achieve this outside London. The Orchard Street site became a church and is now a Freemason's Hall. The new theatre was first proposed in 1802 at several sites in Bath until the current site was chosen in 1804; funding was raised by the use of a Tontine, an investment plan named after the Neapolitan banker Lorenzo de Tonti, who is credited with inventing it in France in 1653. It combined features of a group annuity and a lottery. Each subscriber paid an agreed sum into the fund, and thereafter received an annuity. As members died, their shares devolved to the other participants, and so the value of each annuity increased. On the death of the last member, the scheme was wound up. Shares, which cost £200, were rapidly purchased, with the Prince Regent, who later became George IV, and his brother Prince Frederick among the subscribers. A similar scheme had previously been used for the construction of the Bath Assembly Rooms. The exterior of the building, with arches, pilasters, garlands and ornaments, which is visible from Beauford Square, was designed by George Dance the Younger who also designed the decorative sections of the interior. The main fabric of the building was by John Palmer, who supervised the construction. The ceiling was decorated with panels from Fonthill Splendens, a mile from Fonthill Abbey, which were painted by Andrea Casali and donated to the theatre by Paul Cobb Methuen. Because of the potential damage from the gas lights, which were installed in 1827, the paintings were moved by William Blathwayt to Dyrham Park. The opening night was on 12 October 1805 was a production of Richard III, with an unknown actor in the lead. Though not a success, the theatre soon established a good reputation and thrived under the management of William Wyatt Dimond. Early performances included appearances by the child actors Master Betty and Clara Fisher, with adult leads from prominent actors on the London stage including Dorothea Jordan, William Macready and Edmund Kean. In addition to Shakespeare and other serious drama, the productions included opera and comedy with Joseph Grimaldi playing the clown in a pantomime of Mother Goose in November 1815. The auditorium of the Theatre Royal in 1864 during a meeting of the British Association. First published in the Illustrated London News Between the 1810s and 1850s there were a series of changes in ownership and management. These coincided with a Puritan revival and a fall in Bath's popularity; reductions in receipts were compounded by rising payments for actors from London. As a result, the theatre underwent financial crises and fell into a period of decline. Fortunes began to improve when James Henry Chute, who was the manager of the Bath Assembly Rooms and the son-in-law of the owner Mrs Macready, took over as the manager of the theatre and once again audiences began to rise. =Fire and rebuilding= On 18 April 1862 a major fire destroyed the interior of the building including the stage, scenery, wardrobe and library, leaving just the exterior walls still standing. A new company was formed to rebuild the theatre and a competition held for designs. The winner was C.J. Phipps and rebuilding, which included the new entrance on Sawclose, quickly followed. The present main entrance to the Theatre Royal, in Sawclose, was built in 1720 by Thomas Greenway, and was previously at Beau Nash's house. Pevsner criticizes the mouldings of window- frames, frieze and volutes of the door-hood brackets as \\"characteristically overdone\\", and mentions Wood citing its \\"profuse ornament\\" which was typical of a mason rather than an architect. Chute remained as manager and employed Charles Kean and Ellen Terry to play in A Midsummer Night's Dream on the opening night, 3 March 1863. Initially the reopened theatre struggled to become profitable despite appearances by Henry Irving among others. In 1885 William Lewis took over as the lessee and was followed, in 1892, by his son Egbert Lewis. They redecorated the theatre in 1892 and attracted larger regular audiences to performances of melodrama and comedy while starting to put on Gilbert and Sullivan operas and other attractions. =20th century= In 1902 the theatre closed for nine months to enable extensive building work to be carried out in accordance with the terms of the Royal Charter. This involved a new staircase, the installation of electric lighting, a new fire curtain and hot water radiators throughout the auditorium. In 1905, on the anniversary of the opening of the Theatre Royal, numerous William Shakespeare's plays were performed by the company of actors led by Frank Benson. In 1914 the theatre impresario Arthur Carlton, from Worcester, took over the lease. As he was responsible for 14 theatres around the country at the time, he appointed Mrs D. Valantine Munro as the local manager. Performances were maintained during World War I, and in 1916 Sarah Bernhardt portrayed a wounded male French soldier in Du Théâtre au Champ d'Honneur. In the 1920s there were appearances by the Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova and Mrs. Patrick Campbell. During the Great Depression of the 1930s the theatre was not profitable and closed completely for six months. In 1938 the lease was taken over by Reg Maddox, whose family were involved with the theatre for the next 40 years. During World War II the theatre fared better, with appearances by prominent actors including Donald Wolfit, Irene Vanbrugh, John Gielgud and Sybil Thorndike. In the Post-War years, receipts suffered as audiences dwindled in the face of competition from cinema and television. Unsuccessful proposals were made for a trust to run the theatre in 1968, and in the 1970s, shares in the owning company were bought by the property developer Charles Ware, who sold to Charles Clarke, a solicitor from Bristol. Clarke was responsible for a redecoration of the building, but as profits were still small, in 1976 he sold it to Louis I. Michaels, who ran the Haymarket Theatre in London. In March 1979, the dilapidated theatre was purchased by a trust headed by Jeremy Fry for £155,000. In 1980 The following year, an appeal was launched to raise money for renovations, including the complete rebuilding of the stage, installation of a steel grid to hold stage lighting and scenery and a higher fly system, to allow major touring companies, including the Royal National Theatre under Peter Hall, to be booked to perform. The total projected cost was £3.5 million, of which £1.8 million was seen as being essential to reopening the theatre. Money and donations in kind were received from the city council, Arts Council England, Bath Preservation Trust, Leche Trust, Historic buildings council, Manifold Trust, South-West Stonecleaning and Restoration Company and many individuals. Work on the building started to designs by Dowton and Hurst. However, as insufficient funds had been raised by 1982 to complete the work, loans were negotiated with the Bristol & West and Lombard North Central with guarantees from local councils. The theatre reopened on 30 November 1982 with a performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream, featuring a cast from the National Theatre led by Paul Scofield. The event was attended by Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. =2010 refurbishment= The theatre in 2015 In October 2009, the '2010 Refurbishment Appeal' was launched by Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Royal Patron of the Theatre Royal Bath, to raise money for a programme of work to preserve the 200-year-old building, while ensuring that it remained suitable for 21st-century audiences. The £3million refurbishment by Fry, the most extensive programme of work since the theatre had been saved from virtual collapse almost 30 years before, included an expanded foyer, improved lift and disabled access to the stalls and royal circle levels, complete refurbishment of the bars and the creation of The Jeremy Fry Bar, in the former cellars of The Garrick's Head pub, and redecoration of the auditorium. Technical improvements included the rebuilding of the Main House stage, and an extensive rewiring and lighting programme around the entire building, with new fire alarm systems, air-conditioning and lighting, all designed to improve the building's efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint by some 30%. The design was by architects of the Fielden Clegg Bradley Studios, and the construction firm Midas was contracted to complete the building work. A successful campaign, led by writer and novelist Bel Mooney, who had been instrumental in previous fund-raising campaigns for the Theatre Royal Bath, saw almost a third of the money raised through donations and sponsorship, enabling work to begin away from public areas in March 2010. The theatre's Main House was closed in July 2010, to allow the work on the foyer, bars and auditorium to be completed. The official re- opening took place on Wednesday, 8 September 2010, just ten and a half months after the original campaign was launched, with the building work being completed on schedule. The ceremonial re-opening was performed on-stage by actors Penelope Keith and Peter Bowles, who were starring in the Theatre Royal's own production of The Rivals, Richard Brinsley Sheridan's classic Restoration comedy, set in and around 18th-century Bath. In 2011, the theatre won a British Construction Industry Award Conservation Award. The theatre itself is said to be haunted by several ghosts including the Grey Lady, who was an actress centuries ago. She has been seen watching productions in the Grey Lady Box, and she leaves the distinctive scent of jasmine. She has purportedly been seen and scented in recent years. Architecture and features The Garrick's Head on St John's Close The theatre, along with the neighbouring Garrick's Head public house, is a Grade II* listed building and is considered a prime example of Georgian architecture. The oldest part of the building is the former Garrick's Head on St John's Close. The three storey five bay building, with a basement, has a hipped roof with a part-balustraded parapet. Above the door is a bust of David Garrick, which was made in 1831 by Lucius Gahagan. The Beauford Square side of the building, originally designed by George Dance the Younger, is of five bays with pilasters carrying a frieze of comic and tragic muses. The central door was the main entrance for the pit and galleries. The east front, now the main entrance which opens onto Sawclose, was altered from a plain six-bay entrance by the addition of the round-arched foyer hiding four of the original bays. The 900-seat auditorium has tiers of ornate plasterwork, with red and gilt decoration, and a trompe-l'œil ceiling and glittering chandelier. It has three galleries in a horseshoe plan, supported by cast iron pillars. In 2017 the Sawclose area between the current Theatre Royal main entrance and the former Bluecoat School was made into a pedestrian-friendly shared space area for pedestrians, cyclists and cars. =Ustinov Studio= Frontage of the Ustinov Studio In 1997, a studio theatre was built at the rear of the building on Monmouth Street, called the Ustinov Studio, named after the actor Peter Ustinov. The front of the building is decorated with a bronze winged figure which was designed by his son, Igor Ustinov, entitled Hopefully. The 150-seat auditorium was originally a space for the youth theatre and small-scale touring productions, but the Ustinov programme soon expanded to encompass classical concerts, stand-up comedy (including high-profile acts such as Bill Bailey, Stewart Lee and Lucy Porter) and in-house productions. To accommodate the technical needs of these productions, a refurbishment was planned to take place throughout 2007, improving the backstage & technical facilities, the foyer, bar and auditorium. The Ustinov Studio re-opened in February 2008, with their own production of Breakfast With Mugabe, starring Joseph Marcell, Miles Anderson and Nicholas Bailey. In 2011, Olivier Award-winning director Laurence Boswell was appointed the first Artistic Director of the Ustinov Studio. In the 2012 American Season at the Ustinov Studio, Sarah Ruhl's In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play) was the winner of the Best New Play — Theatre Awards UK 2012 and nominated for three Tony Awards. The Ustinov Studio was also nominated for the prestigious Empty Space ... Peter Brook Award 2012. The Daily Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish praised the venue as a \\"constantly bubbling fount of marvels\\" at the awards ceremony. The Ustinov also received a second consecutive nomination for the 2013 awards. In Autumn 2013, the Ustinov presented The Spanish Golden Age Season, three new translations of rarely seen plays. These included the tragedy Punishment without Revenge, and the romantic comedies Don Gil of the Green Breeches and A Lady of Little Sense, which ran in repertory with a cast of ten actors in all three plays between September and December 2013. It was later transferred to the Arcola Theatre. In Summer 2014, the Ustinov Studio presented a new comedy, 'Bad Jews', and in November of the same year, a black comedy by Florian Zeller, 'The Father' starring Kenneth Cranham. Both of these plays have gone on to huge national and international success in following two years, running almost continuously on several tours and West End transfers, culminating in Kenneth Cranham winning the Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Play at the 2016 Awards Ceremony. In January 2020, the internationally acclaimed and multi-award-winning theatre and opera director Deborah Warner, was appointed Artistic Director of the Ustinov Studio. =The Egg= The front doors of The Egg In 2005 another new theatre was opened behind the Theatre Royal, The Egg, which provides professional theatre productions for children and their families, alongside workshops and youth theatre productions. It includes a cafe, which is also the venue for children's and family events, and occasional teenage arts events. Performances Alongside the weekly touring productions which make up most of its programme, the Theatre Royal hosts a Summer Season, curated by Jonathan Church. This followed on from the highly acclaimedPeter Hall Company Season, which was held from 2003 until 2011. Many plays start at the Theatre Royal before their official opening in London.

History  According to the Imperial Gazetteer of IndiaImperial Gazetteer of India, Volume 5, Page 388. the founder of Anupshahr was the bargujar clan of Rajput Raja named Anup Rai, and thus the date of foundation of present-day Anupshahr was between 1605 and 1628 (during the reign of the Moghul emperor Jahangir). Raja Anup Rai saved Jahangir during a lion hunt, by intercepting and then helping to kill a lion that attacked the emperor. Jahangir presented this area to Raja Anup Rai, and the city is named after him. Anup Rai built a fort nearby. During the period of King Tarasingh (the eighth generation from Raja Anup Singh) this area progressed much. At that time the area was known for Ayurvedic medicine and for business by boats in northern India. In the 18th century when the Mughal empire set into a decline and the former satraps attained the status of suzerain rulers Anupshahr came to be located on the western periphery of the 'Nawabi' of Oudh (Avadh) and became an important garrison. Though the Nawab of Oudh soon lost control of the area, this small town long remained a cantonment of sorts. In 1857, during the first war of independence the town of Anupshahr was the scene of incidents against British rule. One message of revolution was carried from Aligarh to Bulandshahr by Pandit Narayan Sharma on 10 May 1857. The Lord of Dadri and Sikandrabad destroyed inspection bungalows, telegraph offices and government buildings as they were symbols of foreign rule. Following recapture of Delhi by the Army of the East India Company and the subsequent assumption of direct responsibility for administering India by the British Crown the first Viceroy, Lord Canning on his march to Delhi camped at Anupshahr with his Army.

Raju discovered. On a Jain bed in the Arachalur hills, is an inscription — ‘ezhuthum punaruthan maniya vannakkan devan sathan.’ The word ‘punaruthan’ is an alteration of punarthan, which means organised. The other two inscriptions have musical syllables, which are the same when read from left to right, and vice versa; they are also the same when read from the top of a column to the bottom and vice versa. These two inscriptions show that 'Maniyan Vannakkan Devan Sathan' organised musical syllables. “This inscription, which belongs to the same period as Silappadikaram, is centuries older than the 'Kudumiyamalai inscriptions' on music, and yet the Arachalur inscription hardly draws visitors,” rues Dr.S. Raju. Dr. S. Raju says that the contribution of Kongu Jains to Tamil was immense. “Konguvelir, who wrote Perunkathai, based on Durvineetha’s Brihatkatha, must have been a Kongu Vellala Jain. A Sanskrit inscription in the Vijayamangalam Jain temple, talks of the beauty of Perunkathai. This temple was built in 678 C.E.

Arang, also known as \\"The town of temples\\" of Chhattisgarh, is a block and a Nagar Palika in Raipur District in the state of Chhattisgarh, India. It is situated near the eastern limits of Raipur City and close to Mahasamund City. Arang is an ancient town, which was ruled by the Haihayas Rajput dynasty. It is famous for its many Jain and Hindu temples which belong to the 11th and 12th centuries; these are the Mand Deval Jain temple, the Mahamaya temple, the Panchmukhi temple and the Hanuman temple. Due to the Archaeological finds of a copper plate inscription dated to the Gupta Empire, known as the Arang Plate of Bhimasena II of the clan of Rajarsitulya, has established the town's ancient history as a Hindu and Jain religious centre, which was then under the rule of Hindu kings. The Mand Deval Jain temple is the most ancient of these temples dated to the 11th century where three huge images of Digambara tirthankaras are deified in the sanctum sanctorum; these are carved in black stone and polished. Economic activity in the town is mostly related to small scale industries of rice and pulse mills, and many types of forest products. Religious tourism is receiving attention. History The name Arang is formed of two words ara meaning \\"saw\\" and anga meaning \\"body\\". According to a legend, god Krishna appeared disguised as a Brahmin before king Murddhawaja (Mordhwaj) of the Haihaya dynasty. The pious king offered him whatever dakshina he wanted. The disguised Brahmin asked for one half of the king's body. The king immediately ordered that he be sawed off, and one half given as dakshina. As he was about to be cut in half, a tear drop fell from one of the eyes. The Brahmin asked the king if the tear drop reflected his regret in accepting his request. The king replied no, adding that the half of the body which he did not ask for weeps as it too would like to be a part of the dakshina. Krishna then revealed himself and blessed the king for his devotion. Arang was ruled in ancient times by the Haihayas Rajput dynasty. Archaeological finds establishes that the town had an ancient history as the centre of Hindu and Jain religious faiths. Arang also finds mention in the Hindu epic Mahabharata. An archaeological antiquary in the form a copper plate inscription dated to the Gupta period, known as the Arang Plate of Bhimasena II of the clan of Rajarsitulya was unearthed at Arang. It attests to the reign of this dynasty over Chhattisgarh, particularly of Bhimasena II and five rulers who preceded him. It is inferred that they were vassals of the Gupta Empire. Archaeological finds in Arang also included few Jain images made of gem stones, which are now preserved in the Digambar Jain temple at Raipur.

It is built in the Bhumija style of architecture. The plinth of this temple has detailed ornamentation. It has a socle plinth that supports a pedestal, and two rows of sculptures on the wall. The temple layout plan is in a star shape known as stellate (meaning: shaped like a star, having points, or rays radiating from a center) with six \\"offsets\\". The temple rises to five floors, which is considered an unusual feature. The temple faces west and is in rundown condition. In the past, a mandapa (an outdoor pavilion) and a porch probably existed as part of the temple. The temple has three free standing large images of Jain tirthankaras deified in the garbha griha or sanctum sanctorum. These are carved ornately in black stone and highly polished. The three tirthankaras are Ajitanatha, Neminath and Shreyanasanatha. The central figure is adorned with the symbol of a wheel holding two deers in the left hand, and a globe on the right hand. The base of this image has a \\"winged figure\\" carving. Carved images also embellish the exterior faces of the temple. =Bhand Deval temple= Bhand Deval temple, which was inferred initially as a Jain temple, is dated to the 11th century.

These are labelled in dynamical genetics as dynamic mutations. Triplet expansion is caused by slippage during DNA replication, also known as \\"copy choice\\" DNA replication. Due to the repetitive nature of the DNA sequence in these regions, 'loop out' structures may form during DNA replication while maintaining complementary base pairing between the parent strand and daughter strand being synthesized. If the loop out structure is formed from the sequence on the daughter strand this will result in an increase in the number of repeats. However, if the loop out structure is formed on the parent strand, a decrease in the number of repeats occurs. It appears that expansion of these repeats is more common than reduction. Generally, the larger the expansion the more likely they are to cause disease or increase the severity of disease. Other proposed mechanisms for expansion and reduction involve the interaction of RNA and DNA molecules. In addition to occurring during DNA replication, trinucleotide repeat expansion can also occur during DNA repair. When a DNA trinucleotide repeat sequence is damaged, it may be repaired by processes such as homologous recombination, non-homologous end joining, mismatch repair or base excision repair. Each of these processes involves a DNA synthesis step in which strand slippage might occur leading to trinucleotide repeat expansion. The number of trinucleotide repeats appears to predict the progression, severity, and age of onset of Huntington's disease and similar trinucleotide repeat disorders.News Release, Weizmann Institute of Science, \\"Scientists at the Weizmann Institute, using computer simulations, have provided an explanation as to why certain genetic diseases caused by repeats in the code are “genetic time-bombs” whose onset and progression can be accurately predicted,\\" November 21, 2007, at http://80.70.129.162/site/en/weizman.asp?pi=371&doc;_id=5042.

The title is from an 1847 poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson entitled \\"Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal\\", the opening line of which is \\"Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white.\\" Publication history The novel was published (by Canongate) in hardback in the UK in 2002, with a paperback edition following the next year. Canongate also published The Apple, a selection of short stories based on characters from The Crimson Petal and the White, in 2006. Plot synopsis The novel details lives of two very opposite Victorian women, Agnes and Sugar, and the linchpin on whom they revolve: William Rackham. William, the unwilling and somewhat bumbling heir to a perfume business, is a businessman of moderate success and little self- awareness. He married the exquisitely doll-like Agnes, who embodies the Victorian \\"female ideal\\" of naive femininity, for her beauty though he barely knew her. Since she has been kept completely in the dark on sexual matters, Agnes' diaries express utter confusion over events like menstruation (she believes a demon returns periodically to \\"bleed\\" her), pregnancy, sex, or childbirth: she does not even acknowledge her young daughter, Sophie. Sophie, who takes after her father, is very carefully kept far from her mother's sight by the household staff, who otherwise disregard Agnes' desires and ignore her. Outside of the house, few know of Agnes' madness (though knowledge of it spreads during the length of the story), who presents herself as an inveterate hostess and socialite to the world during each season. William soon becomes obsessed with a worldly young prostitute named Sugar, an unconventionally intelligent and strong-willed young woman who uses the affair with William to climb to a higher perch in the rigidly stratified class system of the time. William purchases Sugar from her madame (Sugar's own mother) and sets her up in a luxurious flat of her own, where he regularly visits her on his terms. Sugar has been a prostitute since the age of 13 and views sex as a living, not a pleasure, with no physical act too taboo. She is resentful of her reliance on William's (and men in general) favour and indulges her fantasies about harming her and her fellow prostitute's clients in an explicitly gruesome novel of revenge erotica she pens in her spare time as she works to maintain William's continued interest using both her body and her mind. As William's fortunes climb from Sugar's excellent business acumen, Agnes becomes increasingly eccentric. William eventually decides to move Sugar into his household, hidden as a member of his staff. Sugar is designated as Sophie's governess and grows to genuinely love the girl as her own even as Agnes' mind begins to spiral into hallucinations of angels and William retreats to the man's world of his business dealings. Agnes catches sight of Sugar around the property and becomes convinced that Sugar is her angel come to take her to the Convent of Health. The book culminates in William losing all after having long and obliviously neglected the needs of the two women. The day before Agnes is to be moved to an asylum on the orders of William, she runs away in search of the Convent of Health on the advice of Sugar, who indulges Agnes' fantasy that she is her angel. A body is later found in the river Thames, which William believes is Agnes but that Sugar has reason to believe is not that of Agnes. After Agnes' supposed death, it is implied that William is considering courting another woman of his station rather than marrying Sugar. Sugar discovers that she has become pregnant by William and before she is able to end the pregnancy by jumping down the stairs of the house, the doctor (the same doctor who was implied to be sexually abusing Agnes) discovers the pregnancy and reports it to William. William dismisses Sugar from the household in a letter. Sugar, having grown fond of Sophie and convinced William will not care for her, takes Sophie with her when she leaves. The end implies that William never finds Sophie, Sugar or Agnes. Other characters include Henry Rackham, William's pious brother who wants to be a clergyman, and his obsession and obstacle to the cloth, and Emmeline Fox, a widow who works in the Rescue Society, which tries to reform prostitutes. Style The novel is told from the perspective of all of the main characters, and the omniscient narrator occasionally addresses the reader directly. There is also a meta-literary aspect, as Sugar is working on her own novel, Henry writes sermons, and Agnes keeps a diary. Reception The novel was generally well received by critics, with one review calling it \\"supremely literary\\" and describing the quality of the writing as \\"dizzyingly accomplished\\". In other media In 2010, the BBC announced the production of a four-part miniseries based on the novel; viewing started in April 2011. The adaptation's cast includes Romola Garai, Chris O'Dowd, Gillian Anderson, Richard E. Grant, Shirley Henderson, Amanda Hale, Mark Gatiss, Tom Georgeson and Liz White; it was adapted by Lucinda Coxon and directed by Marc Munden. The director of photography was Lol Crawley.

He was particularly known for his bilingual version of the anthem, which began in French and ended in English, in recognition of the two languages of Canada. Career Doucet's first performance of the national anthem at a Canadiens game was on 13 October 1970. Author Andrew Podnieks noted that Doucet \\"belted the anthem with an enthusiasm that energized the crowd as much as any Lafleur slapper or Robinson hip check.\\" During the inaugural Canada Cup tournament, Doucet was scheduled to sing the national anthems at a game between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union on 3 September 1976. However, the lyrics for \\"Hymn of the Soviet Union\\" were omitted since the mid-1950s due to their Stalinist content. Doucet consulted with the Université de Montréal's Russian department staff who provided a modified anthem to sing at the game. These lyrics were approved by the Soviet Union the following year for use in its national anthem. Doucet also changed the way Canadians sing their anthem. Before Doucet, the final \\"we stand on guard for Thee\\" was universally sung the way it was written: fa-mi-re-soh-ti-doh, with the 'ti' and the 'doh' falling. Doucet sang the final 'ti-doh' by raising these notes an octave above their traditional pitch. The audience of CBC's Hockey Night in Canada was so vast, and his rendition so powerful, that within a few years Doucet's version became—and remains—the accepted way to conclude O Canada. In 1980, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest civilian honour, \\"in recognition for the feeling of pride he has instilled in his fellow citizens\\".Order of Canada citation Roger Doucet died in Montreal on 19 July 1981 after sustaining a brain tumour.

Hand, Jr. for Robert Wood Johnson and J. Seward Johnson, heirs to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceuticals fortune. Hand intended to epitomize the best features of the American fishing schooner. The (sparred length; on deck), 145-ton vessel competed in transatlantic races. In 1931 the vessel was purchased by the San Francisco Bar Pilots Association, brought from the Atlantic, modified and placed in service as the pilot vessel California serving as such until retired in 1972. Design and construction The schooner was the largest vessel designed by William H. Hand, Jr., a renowned naval architect, who was a primary developer of the V-bottomed hull motorsailers. Zodiac was built in 1924 at the Hodgdon Brothers Shipyard, East Boothbay, Maine. As built the vessel was length overall, beam, design draft of and a waterline length of on design draft. Propulsion was by an Atlas , six-cylinder, four-cycle engine driving a , two-bladed propeller for a speed of about under power. Yacht Robert Hood and J. Seward Johnson sailed the yacht as far north as Nachvak, Labrador and in 1928 entered Zodiac in a race from New York to Spain with the yacht finishing fourth among the large yachts. Pilot vessel California The San Francisco Bar Pilots Association bought the schooner in 1931 on the Atlantic Coast and brought the vessel to San Francisco for modification and operation as the pilot vessel California bearing the name of an earlier vessel of the Association. The vessel was the largest schooner operated by the San Francisco Bar Pilots who operated her in peacetime and through wars until 1972 as the last sailing vessel in the United States to serve as a pilot vessel. =Modification= As a pilot boat is required to be on station during all weather and, in the case of the San Francisco Bar Pilots of the time, remain on station for about five days supporting a crew of seven hosting up to ten pilots, modification was required. The Association had the vessel modified by The Moore Dry Dock Company of Oakland, after consultation with the original designer, increased power with a Atlas-Imperial diesel engine to replace the original Atlas diesel engine that in turn required modifications to the stern to accommodate a larger shaft and diameter propeller with pitch replacing the original diameter, 2-bladed propeller. The propulsion change increased speed from approximately knots. Deck houses and accommodations were renovated to fit the needs of pilots serving long waits on station with a pilot house added that was unusual for a yacht and resembling that of a commercial vessel. The galley had an Ingle oil burner range and accommodations were heated by a steam heat system based on an Areola boiler. Modifications resulted in an increase in draft from the original designed to with a new waterline length of and displacement increasing from 210 to 245 tons. =Pilot service= California was delivered and on station in early 1932 serving as one of the pilot boats, rotating duty on the bar at five-day intervals. The other active pilot vessel was Gracie S. with Adventuress serving as backup vessel. The offshore pilot vessel station was approximately nine miles off the Golden Gate. Operating in close proximity with large ships had its risks with California losing her bow three times and once being grounded in San Francisco Bay. California was retired in 1972 to be replaced by pure motorized vessels, including a more modern vessel built in 2000. This made her one of the last three sail-powered pilot vessels in the United States, along with the Boston-based schooner Roseway, which was retired sometime between 1971 and 1973, and Adventuress, also once a San Francisco pilot boat, which was retired in 1952, and is also a registered National Historic Landmark. Sale and return to Zodiac California was sold in 1973 returning to the name Zodiac and, in the late 1970s, the private Vessel Zodiac Corporation was formed to operate and maintain her. She was professionally restored, and her rig, which had been altered during her time as a pilot boat, was returned to its original configuration. Zodiac now operates charters and cruises in Washington state's San Juan Islands and British Columbia's Gulf Islands. The not-for-profit Northwest Schooner Society partners with the corporation to provide sail training programs for youth and adults.

Addicks is an area of Houston that was formerly its own community. Addicks, a railroad stop for the Bear Creek community, was named after its original postmaster, Henry Addicks, in 1884.http://texasescapes.com/TexasGulfCoastTowns/Addicks-Texas.htm The original town site was located just south of the intersection of Patterson Road and Highway 6. The Addicks Bear Creek Cemetery contains the graves of many of the original German settlers. The town and surrounding community were destroyed by the Hurricane of 1900 but were quickly rebuilt. By 1947 the community was forced to move several miles south near the current intersection of I-10 and Highway 6 since the old location became the site for the Addicks Reservoir. Many of the old buildings can still be found. The Addicks Bear Creek Methodist Church, founded in 1879, is a historical building and can be found on the east side of Highway 6 near Addicks Dam. The church is now known as Addicks United Methodist Church . Other old buildings located near the southeast corner of I-10 and Highway 6, make up a trendy area of shops, antique stores, and restaurants.

The following schools serve Addicks: * Wolfe Elementary School (for all elementary aged pupils in Addicks) (Houston) (formerly Addicks Elementary School; the school was renamed in 1986 in honor of former school superintendent and then Addicks Elementary principal, Mr. Maurice Wolfe.) The original school mascot (Addicks Bobcats) became the Lobos (Wolfe Lobos). * Cardiff Junior High School (for pupils living north of Interstate 10) (Unincorporated Harris County) * Mayde Creek Junior High School (for pupils living north of Interstate 10) (Unincorporated Harris County) * Memorial Parkway Junior High School (for pupils living south of Interstate 10) (Unincorporated Harris County) * Mayde Creek High School (for pupils living north of Interstate 10) (Unincorporated Harris County) * James E. Taylor High School (for pupils living south of Interstate 10) (Unincorporated Harris County) Addicks was, at one time, served by the Addicks Independent School District. The last graduating class of Addicks High School was in 1948. By the mid 1950s, there were only 6 grades in Addicks Elementary School. Seventh through twelfth grades were bussed to schools in Katy. Portions of Addicks ISD later consolidated into Katy ISD in 1961. The school board at the time could have guided Addicks ISD to consolidate into Spring Branch ISD, but they chose to merge with Katy because it (Katy ISD) was still a rural district. . The rest of Addicks ISD was absorbed by other school districts. Roads * Interstate 10 * State Highway 6 * Memorial Drive * Addicks-Howell Road * Eldridge Parkway * Barker Cypress Road * Park Row Boulevard The names of many of the oldest roads in the area indicate the two towns they connect. For example, Addicks-Satsuma Road once linked the small town of Addicks with the small town of Satsuma, Texas once located near the intersection of Highway 6 and Highway 290. Remnants of this road are still in use today as a part of Highway 6 north of Interstate 10. Similarly, Addicks-Howell Road connected Addicks to the small town of Howellville once located near the intersection of Highway 6 and Westheimer Road. While most of the original Addicks-Howell Road was paved over during the re-routing of present-day Highway 6, the northernmost stretch still exists just south of its intersection with Interstate 10. Other roads that follow this convention include Addicks- Fairbanks Road (present day Eldridge Parkway north of Interstate 10) and Addicks-Clodine Road (most of which was abandoned after building of the Barker Reservoir). Jackrabbit Road was named because of the plethora of jackrabbits that once lived around and often darted across the narrow, two-lane road. Jackrabbit Road once extended from the present site of the community of Addicks north toward Fairbanks; the road intersected with then-Hempstead Highway/now SH 290. In the late 1950s, much of the dirt-and-gravel Jackrabbit Road was widened and replaced with the new FM 1960. The section of FM 1960 south of 290 toward Addicks and continuing south past Addicks was later renamed State Highway 6. Portions of Jackrabbit Road south of SH 290 remain; it is east of current SH 6.

It is situated 30 km from Hassan, 181 km from Mangalore and 195 km from Bangalore. The river Hemavati forms the entire northern boundary of the Taluk; river Kaveri runs through a portion of the south. It is well connected by road to many towns and cities of Karnataka. Holenarasipura is the nearest railway station to Arakalgud taluk and the nearest airport is in Mangalore. History It is said that Gautama rishi performed penance to Surya(Sun God) and installed the idol of Arkeshwara, the presiding deity of the local Arkeshwara temple and the town was originally called Arkapuri (city of an image of Arkeshwara, the presiding deity). Hence the name Arkalgud came into existence. It was founded by Krishnappa Nayaka, one of the Aigur (Balam) chiefs in 1568 A.D. It was then captured by Kanthirava Narasaraja I of Mysore in 1647 A.D., it was retaken subsequently by Keladi Shivappa Nayaka of Ikkeri and finally in 1694 by Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704) of Mysore. Geography and salient features Arkalgud is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc – Arkalgud It has an average elevation of . It lies partly in semi-malnad and partly in maidan tract. The total geographical area of the Taluk is 675 km2. It occupies sixth place in the District in terms of geographical area. The soil is red sandy derived from granites, gneiss and schists. The soil is red to brownish in colour, shallow to fairly deep shallow, loamy to sandy loamy in texture intermixed with fairly large amounts of coarse gravel and pebbles. They are well drained but poor in bases and water holding capacity. It is favourable for growing crops like paddy, sugarcane, coconut, potato, vegetables and plantation crops under irrigated conditions. It is suitable for growing ragi, millets, pulses, groundnut, potato and maize under rain-fed conditions. The river Kaveri enters at Kodavinahosahalli, a village in the south of Arkalgud and flows only through a small portion of about 24 km and enters Mysore district. An Anicut called Krishnarajakatte has been constructed across the river in the Taluk from which two channels viz. Kattepura channel and Ramanathapura channel take off for a length of about 24 km and 30 km respectively. The Kattepura channel runs along the south bank, past Rudrapatna; and the Ramanathapura Channel along the north bank past Konnanur and Ramanathapura to Basavapatna. The river Hemavati divides Arakalgud and Hassan taluks. The river enters in Honnathapura in the western side and flows towards to east and enters Holenarasipura taluk. The taluk receives rainfall from south-west monsoon. It is located at around above sea level. This taluk enjoys dry and cold climate during the year as the central part of the Taluk borders the Malenadu region and south-eastern portions form the southern maidan region. One can find some low hilly regions in the taluk as well as high altitude region such as Hippi-betta (3486 ft. or 1063 meters) in the western portion of the taluk.

The town is famous for its fort built in the late 18th century when Arki was the capital of the erstwhile hill state of Baghal. History Arki was the capital of the princely Hill state of Baghal, which was founded by Rana Ajai Dev, a Panwar Rajput from Dhar state in Central India. The state was founded 11th century and Arki was declared its capital by Rana Sabha Chand in 1643. Its main attraction, Arki Fort is a now a heritage hotel managed by the ruling family and a lovely place to visit. The fort was captured by the Gurkhas in 1806. Rana Jagat Singh, the ruler of Baghal, had to take refuge in Nalagarh. From 1806 to 1815, the Gurkha General Amar Singh Thapa holds Arki as his headquarters to make further advances into Himachal Pradesh as far as Kangra. The Gurkhas were, however, driven out by Rana Jagat Singh assisted by Sir David Ochterlony and the British forces during the Gurkha War in 1815–1816. Thereafter Rana Jagat Singh regained control of Arki. Rana Kishan Singh, who ruled the state from 1840 to 1867, developed the town of Arki in a planned manner. The Rana was a far-sighted ruler and built horse and mule tracks to connect Arki with Shimla and Bilaspur. Many artisans, scholars and businessman from other parts of India settled in Arki during his reign as he provided them with tax free land free of cost. The Rana was a patron of arts and had muralled interiors installed in the Arki Fort in 1850. These murals are prime attraction among tourists even today. The Last ruler of Baghal was Shri Raja Rajander Singh (1928–2010) who overhauled the administration and introduced radical constitutional reforms. After Indian independence he was an M.L.A., 1st Commandant General of Home Guards, Director of Civil Defence. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Rana Kishan Singh assisted the British forces and for which he was presented the title of Raja. Another revolt was suppressed in 1905 with the help of the superintendent of Shimla Hill States. This was as payback for the support he had received earlier to drive Gurkha out.

Blithe was portrayed in the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers by Marc Warren. Blithe's life story was featured in the 2010 book A Company of Heroes: Personal Memories about the Real Band of Brothers and the Legacy They Left Us. Youth Blithe was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After completing 3 years of high school, he enlisted for the paratroopers on August 18, 1942, in his hometown. Military service =World War II= Blithe trained at Camp Toccoa, Georgia, in August 1942 under Captain Herbert M. Sobel. Blithe jumped with the rest of Easy Company into occupied France as part of the massive Airborne invasion; however, when he landed, he found himself lost. Blithe was joined by a number of other paratroopers who were also part of the mis-drops. They teamed up together and found the rest of Easy Company. As portrayed in Band of Brothers by Marc Warren, Blithe was struck with a temporary case of hysterical blindness following the fierce fight to capture Carentan.Ambrose, p. 98 He recovered and was part of a patrol investigating a farmhouse a few days later, where he was shot in the collar bone by a sniper. He recovered from the woundAmbrose, p. 103 and received a Purple Heart on June 25, 1944. Due to his wound, on October 1, 1944, he was sent home and never returned to the European Theater of Operations. Blithe was released from the Army Hospital October 8, 1945, which has been verified by his discharge paperwork at the end of World War II. He attended the 1st annual reunion of the 101st Airborne Division Association. He returned to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and started a career with Westinghouse Electric. =Korean War and afterward= Blithe also served in Korea with the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team after the end of hostilities and later was assigned to the Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan. He never retired from military service. Death On December 10, 1967, while on active duty in Germany, Blithe felt nauseated when he returned from a weekend at Bastogne, Belgium, where he had taken part in the ceremonies commemorating the Battle of the Bulge. On December 11, 1967, Blithe was taken to the emergency room at Wiesbaden Hospital, Germany, where he was admitted with a diagnosis of a perforated ulcer. He died in the intensive care unit on December 17 after surgery, and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery with full honors. In the miniseries Band of Brothers, the closing text of the third episode incorrectly states that Blithe died in 1948 due to never fully recovering from his wound (a bullet to the neck). This was an error made by the producers.

It performs the functions of downward rotation and depression of the scapulae combined with adduction and extension of the shoulder joint. The cable lat pulldown is done where the handle is moved via a cable pulley, as opposed to doing pulldowns on a leverage machine. Muscles The standard pulldown motion is a compound movement that requires dynamic work by muscles surrounding the three joints which move during the exercise. These are the elbow in conjunction with the glenohumeral and scapulothooracic joints in the shoulder girdle. =Latissimus Dorsi= The latissimus dorsi performs extension and adduction of the arm directly to the spinal fascia. It bypasses the scapulae unlike other muscles which perform this function, so work performed by this muscle will not contribute to muscles that affect the scapulae. The lower sternal fibers of the pectoralis major also perform this role of extension and adduction to a lesser degree. The contraction of these adductor/extensor muscles can indirectly depress and downwardly rotate the scapulae; this is only required when they are pulled into elevation and upward rotation by the contraction of muscles that attach to the scapulae. If the weight were being pulled solely by the lats, for example, the scapulae would simply be pulled down by gravity, along for the ride. =Scapular= Muscles that attach to and depress the scapulae include the lower trapezius muscle and the pectoralis minor. The pec minor also works in conjunction with the rhomboid muscle and levator scapulae to perform downward rotation of the scapulae. Muscles which attach to the scapulae that adduct and extend the arm include the posterior deltoid muscles, the teres major, and minor stabilizing contribution from some rotator cuff muscles (infraspinatus and teres minor as lateral rotators, subscapularis as medial rotators). =Elbow= Muscles which flex the elbow joint such as the biceps brachii muscle, brachialis muscles and brachioradialis muscle are active to improve leverage. As the biceps originate on the scapula unlike the other two which originate on the humerus, the biceps are inclined to serve a role as a dynamic stabilizer, much as the hamstrings would during a squat. This is because, while the biceps shortens as the elbow flexes, it will also lengthen as the shoulder extends.ExRx explains muscles used A supinated grip at the forearm allows the biceps to contribute more strongly as an elbow flexor. A prone grip will rely more greatly on the other flexors, the brachialis and brachioradialis. Using a pronated grip during pull-downs tends to result in the greatest activation of the latissimus dorsi, with no difference in latissimus dorsi activity between grip widths. Similarities The pulldown is extremely similar to the pull-up, but uses moving external weights or resistance with a fixed body rather than a fixed bar and a moving body. This makes the pull-down an open-chain movement and the pull-up a closed-chain movement. The weight moved can also be adjusted to be more or less than the weight of the person doing the exercise. Form The pulldown usually uses a weight machine with a seat and brace for the thighs. The starting position involves sitting at the machine with the thighs braced, back straight and feet flat on the floor. The arms are held overhead at full extension, grasping a bar connected to the weight stack. The movement is initiated by pulling the elbows down and back, lowering the bar to the neck, and completed by returning to the initial position. =Variations= Underhand-pull-downs-2.pngNarrow grip underhand pulldown begin Underhand- pull-downs-1.pngNarrow grip underhand pulldown end File:V-bar-pull- down-2.pngNarrow grip neutral pulldown begin File:V-bar-pull- down-1.pngNarrow grip neutral pulldown end Close-grip-front-lat-pull- down-2.pngNarrow grip overhand pulldown begin Close-grip-front-lat-pull- down-1.pngNarrow grip overhand pulldown end Wide-grip-lat-pull- down-1.gifWide grip overhand pulldown begin Wide-grip-lat-pull- down-2.gifWide grip overhand pulldown end Variations can include touching the bar to the chest (sternum) versus the back of the neck, or varying hand spacing (wide versus narrow) or orientation (pronated versus supinated). The exercise can also be done using cable machines, a handle attached to a cable is pulled toward the body, this can be done while seated on a bench or stability ball, kneeling, or in a standing or squatting position. The number of repetitions and weight moved varies according to the specific training plan of the person training. The chin-up/pull-up is a very similar exercise that moves the body against a fixed bar rather than moving a bar against a fixed body. Behind neck This variation of the lat pulldown, in which the bar is pulled behind the neck, may be dangerous and less effective. Behind the neck lat pulldowns offer no biomechanical advantages. It can cause compression of the cervical spine disks, and disk damage if contact is made by striking the bar to the neck. In addition, it can cause rotator cuff injuries. =Muscle involvement= If the weight is pulled to touch the front of the chest, the rhomboid muscles' work may increase, while pulling the weight down to touch the back of the neck may work the upper trapezius muscle. =Etymology= The \\"lat\\" sometimes added before \\"pulldown\\" commonly refers to the latissimus dorsi used in the movement. Most exercises describe the muscle that is involved and the direction of the exercise e.g. biceps curl, triceps extension, leg press, hamstring curl, abdominal curl and so on. Although \\"lat\\" can be first thought as short for \\"lateral\\", the term lateral means sideways and away from the body, which only describes the direction of the humerus during the eccentric portion of the movement (during which the bar is being raised, not pulled down). This means \\"lateral\\" is not an ideal term to describe the movement, it is an adjective more appropriate in usage such as lateral raise.

FPD was founded in 1970 by Macon's First Presbyterian Church and has been described at the time of its founding as a segregation academy. History First Presbyterian Day School was founded in 1970. The First Presbyterian church founded the school the same year that a judge ordered Bibb County public schools to desegregate. The campus was located in a mostly white suburban area, some distance away from the church's headquarters in a black neighborhood downtown. These factors have led the historian Andrew Manis to conclude that the school was a segregation academy established to allow white parents to avoid sending their children to racially integrated public schools. The school has been tax-exempt since 1971 and maintains a policy of non-discrimination. Demographics The demographic breakdown of the 919 K-12 students enrolled in 2015-2016 was: *Asian - 1.7% *Black - 6.1% *Hispanic - 1.0% *White - 90.4% *Multiracial - 0.8% NCES does not gather demographic data for the 42 Pre-K students.

It was the group's first single in chart in the United Kingdom, reaching number 29.British Hit Singles & Albums, (ed 17) 2004 Lyrics As written by group leaders Roger Chapman and John \\"Charlie\\" Whitney, \\"No Mule's Fool\\" is a country-influenced rock song about a boy and his mule taking it easy on a hot day. The boy lies on the grass, daydreaming and concentrating on the only audible sound in proximity - the buzzing of a honeybee. With the temperature at 95 degrees, the boy and his mule prefer to enjoy the warmth of the day by relaxing. Aware that people think the boy and the mule - both of which are expected to be more industrious - are lazy, the boy admits as much, but adds, \\"But one day they're going to see / We're only doing what makes us happy.\\" No Mule's Fool is a quirky, fascinating, perfect little summer song, unlike any other. The grass is a drugs reference and in my mind the immoveable mule is the creature the partaker becomes when stoned (\\"I take the grass, he hits the hay …\\"). We ask nothing more than to be left alone to \\"spend our lazy days and ways just turning on\\". A country and western influence appears in the coda when the music conjures up a Quixotian image of man and mule plodding off into the sunset. A work of art. Music Charlie Whitney's acoustic guitar and a brief riff from the soprano saxophone of Jim King provide a pleasant backdrop, but the energy of the song is from the bass of John Weider, playing as a member of Family on record for the first time. Weider also provides a lilting violin solo in the middle eight. The song fades out with a quickly paced jam, with plenty of \\"pickin' and grinnin'\\" country and western guitar from Whitney. Roger Chapman's relaxed vocals add to the gentle nature of the lyrics. Trivia \\"No Mule's Fool\\" was not intended to appear on an album, but in the United States, United Artists Records placed it at the beginning of the U.S. edition of Family's 1970 album A Song For Me. \\"No Mule's Fool\\" and its B-side, \\"Good Friend of Mine,\\" were the last Family recordings to feature Jim King, who left the group shortly thereafter, as well as the first Family recordings to feature Weider.

It specializes in providing space to prepare meals ahead of time for freezing and cooking at home. There are currently 105 locations in 30 states in the United States. The company was founded by Stephanie Allen and Tina Kuna and was the first in the category of \\"Meal Assembly\\" franchises. Business concept The concept of Dream Dinners is to give busy families the opportunity to prepare home-cooked meals ahead of time. Each month a different seventeen-item menu is made available throughout the chain. The meals are purchased by servings, with a minimum of 36 servings. First time customers can order 18 servings or 9 servings, depending on the offer available at the store. A medium size meal is (3) servings while a large size meal is (6) servings. Customers are offered either public or private sessions to prepare these meals, and the store provides recipes and all required ingredients. Regular sessions provide all seventeen meals from that month's menu, while first time customers have a reduced number of choices. The firm's official website suggests a cost of \\"approximately $240, or under $6.75 per serving\\" for 12 regular or 6 large meals. Some meals are 'complete' (include side dishes), while others are not (need a salad or other vegetable side - for an additional fee). The more servings a customer orders in a single session, the lower the per-serving cost. Individual franchise locations may offer additional promotions or further discounts. Stores further offer a brochure describing a \\"self catering\\" service for parties. Media coverage Dream Dinners has been featured in the O, The Oprah Magazine, The View, profiled by the Food Network show Recipe for Success and Good Morning America. Forbes Magazine profiled Dream Dinners and other franchise businesses in the meal assembly category in a May issue. The article dated May 8, 2008 described the segment's rapid expansion followed by a precipitous rate of closings of the businesses, and detailed litigation between Dream Dinners and a group of franchisees alleging the firm misrepresented the potential value of the franchises, and improper disclosure to potential franchise buyers. In 2010, all litigation surrounding the franchise disputes was settled out of court. The trade magazine Franchise Times ran a detailed article in their November/December 2010 issue outlining the outcome and history of the complex case, which included attorney liability allegations. According to that article, “…sources stated that it was the attorneys and law firms that stepped in to take responsibility for the settlement payments”.

Kochno was born in Moscow, Russia, on 3 January 1904. His father served as a colonel in the hussars. He studied at the Imperial Lycee in Moscow before emigrating to Paris in 1920. He was close with Karol Szymanowski, who gave him as a gift a Russian translation of the chapter The Symposium from his unpublished novel Efebos.Stephen Downes, \\"Eros and Paneuropeanism\\", in Harry White and Michael Murphy, eds., Musical Constructions of Nationalism: Essays on the History and Ideology of European Musical Cultute, 1800-1945 (Cork University Press, 2001), 51-71, esp. 52, 66-7 Szymanowski also dedicated four poems to him. In 1920 he became Sergei Diaghilev's secretary, librettist, and eventually main collaborator. They were also briefly lovers. Kochno wrote the libretto of Stravinsky's Mavra (1921), George Auric's Les Fâcheux (1924), Henri Sauguet's La Chatte (1927), and of Sergei Prokofiev's ballet score The Prodigal Son (1929). In 1925, he had an affair with Cole Porter, with whom he carried on a lengthy correspondence. Upon Diaghilev's death, Kochno and Serge Lifar tried but failed to hold the Ballets Russes together. The two inherited part of Diaghilev's archives and collections, which Kochno completed and part of which was acquired by the Bibliothèque nationale de France. In 1933 he co-founded, together with George Balanchine, the short-lived but history-making company Les Ballets 1933, which made its debut that summer at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. That same year, he and Edward James commissioned Brecht and Weill's last collaboration, The Seven Deadly Sins, which Balanchine produced, directed, and choreographed. At the end of World War II, Kochno entered into a partnership with Roland Petit, with whom he founded the Ballets des Champs-Élysées. His later career included a position as ballet director with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, where he became an influential figure in post-World War II French ballet. Kochno authored several works, including Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes, a record of the Diaghilev era, and Christian Bérard, a scrapbook of artwork by Bérard, Kochno's former lover and collaborator, along with reminiscences. He died on 8 December 1990 in Paris following a fall. He was buried in the Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris, next to Wladimir Augenblick (1911–2001).

It is not to be confused with product convergence, where one product combines and replaces several others; rather, supplier convergence happens primarily through mergers and acquisitions, or through the expansion of larger companies into areas previously dominated by specialty businesses. Convergence in the Retail Industry Supplier convergence in the retail industry is often described as the creation and growth of, literally, \\"one- stop shopping\\" (Slywotzky et al. 1999), epitomized by retail giants such as Wal-Mart, whose outlets offer a wide range of products in an attempt to make competing specialty stores obsolete. Essentially, each section in large department stores, such as hardware, electronics, and clothing, consequently aims to replace competing businesses specializing in just one of those areas. While the above example deals with the combining of many different categories of products, supplier convergence can also occur with just one primary product. Examples of this trend would be the growth of book superstores such as Borders and Chapters, who have replaced many independent bookstores not by offering different products, but by offering a greater number of books that only several smaller stores combined could match. Convergence in the Technology Industry The boom of technology and the internet in recent years has been a key factor behind the trend of supplier convergence. The bundling of products together is a prime example of how a telecom/entertainment company could exploit the convergence pattern to their advantage. By offering triple play discounts to customers who subscribe to a number of services such as land-line telephone, wireless phone, internet, and digital cable, companies are encouraging customers to receive all these services from a single company rather than several different ones. The expansion of wireless networks is also a factor in supplier convergence, as one national or international wireless phone company could replace many localized ones (InterTradeIsland 2002). Websites provide another example of supplier convergence, often with regards to services rather than products. Mega-search sites such as Google and Yahoo have expanded from their humble beginnings as search engines to comprehensive information portals offering news, weather forecasts, and financial services. In doing so, they have created websites that replace or combine the services of many other specialized sites. Convergence Pattern A 2004 paper published by Microsoft explains what it calls the \\"convergence pattern\\" (Trowbridge et al. 2004); that is, the process that businesses must go through in order to achieve supplier convergence. The convergence pattern consists of three main steps: 1\\\\. \\"Successfully promote your product offerings\\" 2\\\\. \\"Emphasize the portions of the chain which command the highest perceived value\\" 3\\\\. \\"Upgrade your delivery of the lower value products\\" Benefits of Supplier Convergence Supplier convergence, when properly executed, can provide benefits to both companies and customers. The 2004 Microsoft paper by Trowbridge et al. singles out mergers and \\"bundling\\" as a particularly positive aspect of supplier convergence. By merging, it says, companies can increase their overall efficiency; that is \\"the cost of performing multiple business functions simultaneously should prove to be more efficient than performing each business function independently, and therefore drive down overall costs\\" (Trowbridge et al. 2004). This can also prove beneficial to the customers, as they can often receive a number of services and products at a better value from one company than from several smaller ones. The convergence of information suppliers, such as websites, also offers the public the ability to view and receive information from one source. Drawbacks of Supplier Convergence A key drawback to supplier convergence is that one of the main concepts of it is to force smaller companies into mergers or out of business by replacing or threatening to replace them with one large company offering different products or services. Wal-Mart and Borders, two of the superstores cited above, have received criticism for forcing local, independent stores out of business by offering convenience and prices that smaller retail stores would not be able to match. For many, this is a concerning trend, as it means local retail outlets will continue to be replaced with large, multinational firms. A drawback to supplier convergence from a business's perspective can occur when a company applies convergence in such a way that makes it inconvenient for customers, and thus backfires on the company. For example, Belgian telecom company Belgacom decided in the late 1990s to combine fixed and mobile phone services into a single subscription. The plan failed, however, when customers wanted to keep these services separate and the company had technical difficulties in producing a single bill for two services (Shankar 2003). Supplier Deconvergence Although much more rare than supplier convergence, supplier deconvergence occurs when a company offering several services or products breaks into a number of smaller companies specializing in a specific service or product (InterTradeIreland 2002). This may occur as part of a restructuring process for companies, or may be a strategic decision to associate different companies with specific services or products. Similar Types of Convergence As noted in the definition above, supplier convergence is not to be confused with product convergence, which occurs when two or more different products \\"evolve […] over time to the point where they overlap and address the same customer need\\" (Slywotzky et al. 1999). Supplier convergence does not reduce the number of products or services available, but merely the number of companies offering them. Another type of convergence is known as complementor convergence. This takes place when two or more companies become allies or form strategic partnerships in order to drive out other competitors. This is not supplier convergence because they are not merging and forming a united line of products, but simply complementing each other with a business partnership (Slywotzky et al. 1999).

It specialized in providing space for families to prepare meals ahead of time for freezing and cooking at home. Once at 165 stores, the franchise ceased operations in 2011; currently six independently owned stores exist and are entitled to use the Super Suppers name and visual branding. The concept of Super Suppers was to give busy families the opportunity to prepare home-cooked meals ahead of time. Each month a twelve-item menu would be made available throughout the chain. Clients would sign up for a session to prepare these meals, with recipes and all required ingredients provided. The standard session provided all twelve meals from that month's menu for around US$200. Each meal served six, and the firm's official website suggested a typical cost of US$3 to $3.50 per serving. The Web site further described its founder, Judie Byrd, as having \\"created Super Suppers to meet the demanding needs of busy parents who want to create quality family time around the dinner table - but don't have the extra time and energy to pull it off.\\" Byrd has authored several family-oriented cookbooks. Stores also offered alternatives including grab-and-go of pre-assembled meal preparations, call-ahead-curbside pickup of store-assembled meal preps, and a fundraising-sales program. A Super Suppers franchise in Cumming, Georgia, was profiled by the Food Network show Recipe for Success. The franchise enjoyed early success, but suffered from a number of problems attributed to growing pains, amateur management and nepotism. Most corporate leaders were members of Byrd's family, and did not have appropriate training or experience outside the fledgling Super Suppers business. In addition, while the recipes were touted to be \\"chef created and tested,\\" they often did not work once out in the field, and individual stores had to modify recipes, assembly instructions and cooking directions. The company also underestimated high food costs to support the retail pricing structure and quality required in order to meet industry standards and customer expectations. Perhaps the biggest problem for the franchise came when the corporate leaders decided to change website providers; the business, which was Internet-based, found itself without any web presence for several weeks while the web provider tried to get the system back online. It was later discovered that the new web provider had no experience in creating the type of e-commerce website required by the business, and that the former developer had disappeared. Despite these setbacks, the company continued to sell franchises and try to support existing stores with the staff they had. Eventually, new store sales ground to a halt and a growing number of existing stores closed under a burden of high operating expenses, high food costs, increased competition and lack of business experience and training. Super Suppers ceased its corporate operations in 2011; the remaining open stores were allowed to continue to use the Super Suppers branding and visual identity. Currently, none of the open stores allow customers to make their own meals, but instead either custom-make orders themselves for pickup or delivery, or have an available supply of \\"grab-n-go\\" meals ready to take and bake. Store Closings A Forbes Magazine article dated March 8, 2008, describing Super Suppers as the second-largest franchisor in the meal assembly franchise business with 165 units, traced the industry's rapid expansion followed by a precipitous rate of store closings (\\"...large chains (with more than 100 stores) have shuttered 11% of their stores...\\") and accompanying franchisee disappointment.https://www.forbes.com/2008/05/08/franchise-meal-assembly-ent- manage-competition08-cx_ml_0508mealassembly.html See also * Dinners Ready, another meal assembly kitchen with locations throughout the United States. * Dream Dinners, the originator of the meal assembly franchise concept.

Athmallik is a town and a notified area committee and a Sub division of Angul district in the state of Odisha, India.  History  Athmallik was initially an estate (jagir) which was recognized as a princely state in 1874. Athmallik was one among the 26 feudatory states of Odisha. Kaintragarh was the capital of Athmallik State, being carved out of the erstwhile Baudh ex-feudatory state. In the 11th century it became a separate princely state, established by King Prattap Deo, a scion of the Kadamba Dynasty. Prattap Deo was said to have found a Honda (Metal Vessel) which was considered to be lucky enough, after which the territory was then named as \\"Hondpa\\". In the course of time, one of the chiefs divided the ex-state into eight divisions and placed one sub-chief called \\"Malla\\" in each division with a view of suppressing the unruly tribes; on this basis the kingdom changed its name from \\"Hondpa\\" to \\"Athmallik\\". The state merged with Dhenknal from the rule of Kishore Chandra Dev in 1948 and remained under Dhenkanal District until 31 March 1993.

The use of the obscene word has caused this to be given a 12 certificate by the BBFC, which is the only episode in the series to have a more restrictive rating than PG.BBFC certificate for The Anniversary  Plot  On the morning of their wedding anniversary, Sybil recalls how Basil forgot last year. Basil has secretly invited their closest friends to Fawlty Towers for the occasion. Before they arrive, he pretends to have forgotten again in order to maintain the surprise. When Sybil asks him if the date reminds him of anything, he guesses random anniversaries, such as the battle of Agincourt, the battle of Trafalgar and Yom Kippur (none of which actually happened on 17 April). Meanwhile, Basil has allowed Manuel to cook a seafood paella from his mother's famous recipe, something he has wanted to do ever since arriving at the hotel. Their chef, Terry, complains that he is more than capable of making paella himself. While Basil tries to placate Terry, Sybil leaves in a huff, frustrated and angry believing Basil really has forgotten their anniversary again. Basil realises only too late as he chases after her car, just before the first of their friends pull into the driveway. Polly comes up with the idea of saying that Sybil is ill and resting in bed upstairs: Basil tells them she has developed what sound like horrific symptoms - she has lost her voice and has puffy eyes, but Polly mishears him and says she has \\"puffy thighs\\". Their friends are keen to see Sybil nonetheless, and Basil struggles to keep them downstairs. Virginia reminds Basil that she is a qualified nurse and becomes determined to see Sybil in order to diagnose her illness. Kitty and Reg arrive saying they saw Sybil driving in the town, but Basil assures them that it was another \\"northern woman\\" who resembles her. Alice tries to rein in her wisecracking husband, Roger, who suspects Basil is covering up for having a row with Sybil. Basil tries reverse psychology insisting the group disturb Sybil: \\"I'll just pop upstairs and tell her to stop dying so that you can all come up and identify her.\\" This naturally makes the guests feel very uncomfortable and reluctant, but Roger is not so easily dissuaded. Basil now tries to force Polly to dress up as Sybil and get into her bed in order to create the illusion that his wife is indeed incapacitated. Polly initially refuses to play any further part in the charade, annoyed at being undervalued for all the work she does for the hotel beyond her waitressing duties. She eventually relents provided Basil gives her money she needs to buy a new car, which Basil had previously avoided making a decision to loan her, but he now readily agrees. Basil stalls the guests while allowing time for Polly to get ready. When they are finally allowed in the bedroom, the lights are turned out so the guests cannot recognise Polly in disguise. Reg and Kitty trip in the dark, injuring themselves. Basil opens the curtains to provide light, revealing Polly tucked up in bed wearing Sybil's wig and sunglasses, but also with \\"foam\\" in her mouth. Through the window, Basil sees Sybil returning to the hotel, and he rushes downstairs to prevent her spoiling the deception. Sybil says she has only returned to retrieve her golf clubs and won't be staying. Rather than try to persuade her to stay, Basil says \\"I'm sure you know best, dear.\\" Convinced there is no hope for their marriage, she returns to her car where Audrey is waiting for them to play golf and forget about the drama. Then Sybil realises she has forgotten to collect her clubs. Back upstairs, Virginia insists on examining Polly, who is still impersonating Sybil upstairs. In an attempt to keep her away, Polly lashes out and hits her in the face. The guests return downstairs, many harbouring injuries, as Basil prepares to wish them goodbye. When Sybil enters the lobby, the partygoers are bewildered and confused; Basil pretends she is the \\"northern woman\\" they mentioned previously, before rushing her into the kitchenwhere Manuel and Terry are wrestling furiously amidst the mess they have made arguing over the paellaand locks her in a cupboard. After ushering the guests out, Basil declares \\"Piece of cake. Now comes the tricky bit,\\" as he returns to the kitchen to explain everything to Sybil.

Most Iraqi Turkmen are the descendants of the Ottoman soldiers, traders and civil servants who were brought into Iraq from Anatolia during the rule of the Ottoman Empire. Despite the popular reference to the Turks of Iraq as \\"Turkmen\\", they are not directly related to the Turkmen people of Turkmenistan and do not identify as such. Today, the Iraqi Turkmen form the third largest ethnic group in Iraq, after the Arabs and Kurds. According to the Iraqi Ministry of Planning, in 2013, the Iraqi Turkmen population numbered 3 million out of Iraq's 34.7 million inhabitants, with estimates being 10-13% of Iraq's population. They mainly reside in northern and central Iraq and share close cultural and linguistic ties with Turkey, particularly the Anatolian region. Ethnonyms Iraqi Turkmen folk dancers. Iraqi Turkmen girl in traditional Turkish costume. Prior to the mid-20th century the Turkmen in Iraq were known simply as \\"Turks\\". However, after the military coup of July 14, 1958, the ruling military junta introduced the name \\"Turkman/Turkmen\\". According to the Iraqi Turkmen scholar Professor Suphi Saatçi \\"The political goal of the Iraqi government was to distinguish the Iraqi Turkmen from other Turks in Anatolia, just as the Greek government used the name \\"Muslim minority\\" for those Turks living within the borders of Greece.\\" Nonetheless, the terms imposed on the Turks of Iraq was not resisted, for the word \\"Turkmen\\" historically designated the Oghuz Turks who had accepted Islam and migrated westwards from Central Asia to the Middle East. The terms \\"Turkmen\\", \\"Turkman\\", and \\"Turkoman\\" have been used in the Middle East for centuries (particularly in Iraq, Syria, and Turkey) to define the common genealogical and linguistic ties of the Oghuz Turks in these regions. Therefore, the Iraqi Turkmen (as well as the Syrian Turkmen and Anatolian Turkmen) do not identify themselves with the Turkmen people of Turkmenistan. Rather, the term \\"Turkmen\\" in the Middle East is often used to designate Turkic-speakers, particularly in the Arab areas, or where Sunni Turks live in Shitte dominated areas. History Suleiman the Magnificent defeated the Safavids on December 31, 1534, gaining Baghdad and, later, southern Iraq. Throughout the Ottoman reign, the Ottomans encouraged Turkish migration along northern Iraq. The Iraqi Turkmens are the descendants of various waves of Turkic migration to Mesopotamia beginning from the 7th century until the end of Ottoman rule (1919). The first wave of migration dates back to the 7th century, followed by migrations during the Seljuk Empire (1037–1194), the fleeing Oghuz during the Mongol destruction of the Khwarazmian dynasty (see Kara Koyunlu and Ag Qoyunlu), and the largest migration, during the Ottoman Empire (1535–1919). With the conquest of Iraq by Suleiman the Magnificent in 1534, followed by Sultan Murad IV's capture of Baghdad in 1638, a large influx of Turks—predominately from Anatolia—settled down in Iraq. Thus, most of today's Iraqi Turkmen are the descendants of the Ottoman soldiers, traders and civil servants who were brought into Iraq during the rule of the Ottoman Empire. =Migration under Arab rule= The presence of Turkic peoples in what is today Iraq first began in the 7th century when approximately 2,000–5,000 Oghuz Turks were recruited in the Muslim armies of Ubayd-Allah ibn Ziyad.. They arrived in 674 with the Umayyud conquest of Basra. More Turkic troops settled during the 8th century, from Bukhara to Basra and also Baghdad. During the subsequent Abbassid era, thousands more Turkmen warriors were brought into Iraq; however, the number of Turkmen who had settled in Iraq were not significant, as a result, the first wave of Turkmen became assimilated into the local Arab population. =Seljuk migration= The second wave of Turkmen to descend on Iraq were the Turks of the Great Seljuq Empire. Large scale migration of the Turkmen in Iraq occurred in 1055 with the invasion of Sultan Tuğrul Bey, the second ruler of the Seljuk dynasty, who intended to repair the holy road to Mecca. For the next 150 years, the Seljuk Turks placed large Turkmen communities along the most valuable routes of northern Iraq, especially Tal Afar, Erbil, Kirkuk, and Mandali, which is now identified by the modern community as Turkmeneli.. Many of these settlers assumed positions of military and administrative responsibilities in the Seljuk Empire. =Ottoman migration= A large influx of Turks continued to settle in Iraq once Murad IV recaptured Baghdad in 1638. The third, and largest, wave of Turkmen migration to Iraq arose during the four centuries of Ottoman rule (1535–1919).. By the first half of the sixteenth century the Ottomans had begun their expansion into Iraq, waging wars against their arch rival, the Persian Safavids. In 1534, under the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, Mosul was sufficiently secure within the Ottoman Empire and became the chief province (eyalet) responsible for all other administrative districts in the region.. The Ottomans encouraged migration from Anatolia and the settlement of immigrant Turkmen along northern Iraq, religious scholars were also brought in to preach Hanafi (Sunni) Islam. With loyal Turkmen inhabiting the area, the Ottomans were able to maintain a safe route through to the southern provinces of Mesopotamia. Following the conquest, Kirkuk came firmly under Turkish control and was referred to as \\"Gökyurt\\",. it is this period in history whereby modern Iraqi Turkmen claim association with Anatolia and the Turkish state. The Mosul Vilayet. With the conquest of Iraq by Suleiman the Magnificent in 1534, followed by Sultan Murad IV's capture of Baghdad in 1638, a large influx of Turks settled down in the region. After defeating the Safavids on December 31, 1534, Suleiman entered Baghdad and set about reconstructing the physical infrastructure in the province and ordered the construction of a dam in Karbala and major water projects in and around the city's countryside.. Once the new governor was appointed, the town was to be composed of 1,000 foot soldiers and another 1,000 cavalry.. However, war broke out after 89 years of peace and the city was besieged and finally conquered by Abbas the Great in 1624. The Persians ruled the city until 1638 when a massive Ottoman force, led by Sultan Murad IV, recaptured the city. In 1639, the Treaty of Zuhab was signed that gave the Ottomans control over Iraq and ended the military conflict between the two empires.. Thus, more Turks arrived with the army of Sultan Murad IV in 1638 following the capture of Baghdad whilst others came even later with other notable Ottoman figures. =Post-Ottoman era= The Misak-ı Millî (\\"national oath\\") sought to include the Mosul Vilayet in the proposals for the new borders of a Turkish nation in 1920. Following the establishment of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the Iraqi Turkmen wanted Turkey to annex the Mosul Vilayet and for them to become part of an expanded state;. this is because, under the Ottoman monarchy, the Iraqi Turkmen enjoyed a relatively trouble- free existence as the administrative and business classes. However, due to the demise of the Ottoman monarchy, the Iraqi Turkmen participated in elections for the Constituent Assembly; the purpose of these elections was to formalise the 1922 treaty with Britain and obtain support for the drafting of a constitution and the passing of the 1923 Electoral law. The Iraqi Turkmen made their participation in the electoral process conditional that the preservation of the Turkish character in Kirkuk's administration and the recognition of Turkish as the liwa's official language. Although they were recognized as a constitutive entity of Iraq, alongside the Arabs and Kurds, in the constitution of 1925, the Iraqi Turkmen were later denied this status. Since the demise of the Ottoman Empire, the Iraqi Turkmens have found themselves increasingly discriminated against from the policies of successive regimes, such as the Kirkuk Massacre of 1923, 1947, 1959 and in 1979 when the Ba'th Party discriminated against the community. Although they were recognized as a constitutive entity of Iraq (alongside the Arabs and Kurds) in the constitution of 1925, the Iraqi Turkmen were later denied this status. Culture The Iraqi Turkmen are mostly Muslims and have close cultural and linguistic ties with the Anatolian region of Turkey. =Language= Bilingual sign (Arabic and Turkish) of a Turkmen village. Bilingual sign (Arabic and Turkish) of a Turkmen village. The Iraqi Turkmen/Turkman dialects fall under the Western Oghuz branch of Turkic languages and are often referred to as \\"Iraqi Turkmen Turkish\\" \\"Iraqi Turkish\\", and \\"Iraqi Turkic\\". The dialects possess their own unique characteristics, but have also been influenced by the historical standards of Ottoman Turkish (which was the official language of administration and lingua franca in Iraq between 1534 and 1920.) and neighboring Azeri Turkic. In particular, standard (i.e. Istanbul) Turkish as a prestige language has exerted a profound influence on their dialects; thus, the syntax in Iraqi Turkmen differs sharply from neighboring Irano-Turkic varieties. Collectively, the Iraqi Turkmen dialects also show similarities with Cypriot Turkish and Balkan Turkish regarding modality. The written language of the Iraqi Turkmen is based on Istanbul Turkish using the modern Turkish alphabet. The Turkish language was recognized as a minority language in Kirkuk and Kifri in 1930, until the military junta introduced the names \\"Turkman\\" and \\"Turkmanja\\" in 1959 with the aim of politically distancing the Turks of Iraq from Turkey. Then, in 1972, the Iraqi government banned the Turkish language and schools and media using Turkish were prohibited. Further bans on the Turkish language were made in the 1980s when the Baath regime prohibited the Iraqi Turkmen from speaking Turkish in public. It was not until 2005 that the Turkmen dialects were recognized under the Iraqi constitution; since then, the Iraqi Turkmen have opened numerous Turkish schools and media exposure from Turkey has led to the standardisation of their dialects towards Istanbul Turkish and the preferable language for adolescents associating with the Turkish culture. Indeed, Iraqi Turkmens themselves (according to the 1957 census), as well as a range of linguistic sources, tend to view their language as a Turkish dialect (of Turkey), which they call Irak Türkmen Türkçesi, Irak Türkçesi, or Irak Türkmencesi. Studies have long noted the similarities between Iraqi Turkmen and certain Southeastern Anatolian dialects around the region of Urfa and Diyarbakır,. or have described it as an \\"Anatolian\\" or an \\"Eastern Anatolian dialect\\". There are also linguists who have said that Iraqi Turkmen is closer to Azeri, placing the Kirkuk dialect as \\"more or less\\"Bulut (1999:9) quoting Hussin Shahbz Hassan. 1979. Kerkük Ağz. İstanbul Üniversitesi Edebiyat Fakültesi Türk Dili ve Edebiyatı Bölümü, Doctoral Thesis. an \\"Azeri Turkish\\" dialect.  Yet, the Kirkuk dialect also shows comparable features with Urfa,. and there are other regions in the Kirkuk Governorate, such as Altun Kupri, Taza Khurmatu, and Bashir, which are said to show unity with the Eastern Anatolian dialect of Urfa. Indeed, the dialects spoken in Turkmen- dominated regions in other parts of the country – including Amirli, Kifri, Tal Afar and Tuz Khurmatu – are all said to be similar to the Turkish dialect of Urfa. Hence, there are linguists who acknowledge similarities with Azeri spoken in Iran but say that Iraqi Turkmen has \\"greater proximity to Turkish of Turkey\\". Besides their traditional dialects, the Iraqi Turkmen diaspora also communicate in standard (Istanbul) Turkish,. whilst the younger generations in Iraq (below the age of 18 in 2019) speak Istanbul Turkish with ease.. In addition, diglossia in Iraq Turkmen dialects and Istanbul Turkish has become a widespread phenomenon.. Most Iraqi Turkmen can also speak Arabic and/or Kurdish. Dialects Due to the existence of different Turkish migration waves to Iraq for over 1,200 years, the Iraqi Turkmen varieties are by no means homogeneous; dialects can vary according to regional features. Several prestige languages in the region have been particularly influential: Ottoman Turkish from 1534 onwards and then Persian after the Capture of Baghdad (1624). Once the Ottoman empire retook Iraq in 1640 the Turkish varieties of Iraq continued to be influenced by Ottoman Turkish, as well as other languages in the region, such as Arabic and Kurdish. Ottoman Turkish had a strong influence in Iraq until 1920, for it was not only the official language of administration but also the lingua franca. Indeed, Turkish has remained a prestige language among Iraqi Turkmen, exerting a profound historical influence on their dialect. As a result, Iraqi Turkmen syntax differs sharply from Irano-Turkic. In general, the Iraqi Turkmen dialects of Tal Afar (approx 700,000 speakers),. Altun Kupri, Tuz Khurmatu, Taza Khurmatu, Kifri, Bashir and Amirli show unity with the Eastern Anatolian dialect of Urfa; meanwhile, the dialects in Kirkuk, Erbil, Dohuk, Mandali and Khanaqin show similarities with Tehrani and Afshar Turkic dialects. Yet, the Kirkuk dialect also shows comparable features with Urfa, and 37.63% of the city of Kirkuk's population had self-declared their mother tongue as \\"Turkish\\" in the 1957 census which asked about language. In particular, a cultural orientation towards Turkey prevails among Iraqi Turkmen intellectuals and diglossia (Turkmen/Turkish of Turkey) is very frequent in educated circles, especially in Kirkuk. In addition, the Erbil dialect shows similarities with Turkish dialects stretching from Kosovo to Rize, Erzurum and Malatya. The Iraqi Turkmen generally also have an active command in standard Turkish due to their cultural orientation towards the Republic of Turkey. Turkish media outlets (especially satellite TV) has been influential; moreover, there are a number of private schools which teach in Turkish backed by Turkish institutions. Thus, diglossia in Iraq Turkmen and standard Turkish (of Turkey) has become a widespread phenomenon. =Politicization= Professor Christiane Bulut has argued that publications from Azerbaijan often use expressions such as \\"Azeri (dialects) of Iraq\\" or \\"South Azeri\\" to describe Iraqi Turkmen dialects \\"with political implications\\"; however, in Turcological literature, closely related dialects in Turkey and Iraq are generally referred to as \\"eastern Anatolian\\" or \\"Iraq-Turkic/-Turkman\\" dialects, respectively. Furthermore, the terms \\"Turkmen/Turkman\\" are also considered to be historically political because in the early 20th century the minority were simply recognized as Turks who spoke the Turkish language, until after the military coup of July 14, 1958, when the ruling military junta introduced the names \\"Turkman/Turkmen\\" to distance the Turks of Iraq from those in Anatolia, and then banned the Turkish language in 1972. Official status Under the British Mandate of Iraq the Turkish language was recognized as an official language in Kirkuk and Kifri under Article 5 of the Language Act of 1930. Article 6 of the Act permitted the language of education to be determined by the native language of the majority of students, whilst Article 2 and Article 4 gave Iraqi citizens the right to have court hearings and decisions verbally translated into Arabic, Kurdish, or Turkish in all cases. Upon Iraq's entry into the League of Nations in 1932, the League demanded that Iraq recognize its ethnic and religious minorities. Consequently, the Turkish language, alongside Kurdish, was to be recognized as an official language under the Iraqi constitution of 1932: \\"in the liwa of Kirkuk, where a considerable part of the population is of Turkmen race, the official language, side by side with Arabic, shall be either Kurdish or Turkish\\". According to Article 1, no law, order, or act of government was allowed to contradict the terms of the 1932 constitution, nor could it be changed in the future.. However, in 1959 the military junta introduced the names \\"Turkman\\" and \\"Turkmanja\\". More recently, Article 4 of the 2005 Iraqi Constitution recognizes \\"Turkomen\\" as an official minority language in the \\"administrative units in which they constitute density of population\\" (alongside Syriac). Adoption of the Turkish alphabet In 1997 the Iraqi Turkmen Congress adopted a Declaration of Principles, Article Three states that \\"the official written language of the Turkmen is Istanbul Turkish, and its alphabet is the new Latin alphabet.\\" By 2005 the Turkish language replaced traditional Turkmeni, which had used the Arabic script, in Iraqi schools. =Education in Turkish= Bilingual sign (Arabic and Turkish) of an Iraqi Turkmen boys secondary school. Bilingual sign (Arabic and Turkish) of an Iraqi Turkmen girls secondary school. In 2005 Iraqi Turkmen community leaders decided that the Turkish language would replace the use of traditional Turkmeni in Iraqi schools; Turkmeni had used the Arabic script whereas Turkish uses the Latin script (see Turkish alphabet). Kelsey Shanks has argued that \\"the move to Turkish can be seen as a means to strengthen the collective \\"we\\" identity by continuing to distinguish it from the other ethnic groups. ... The use of Turkish was presented as a natural progression from the Turkmen; any suggestion that the oral languages were different was immediately rejected.\\". Parental literacy rates in Turkish are low, as most are more familiar with the Arabic script (due to the Ba'athist regime). Therefore, the Turkmen Directorate of Education in Kirkuk has started Turkish language lessons for the wider society. Furthermore, the Turkmen officer for the Ministry of Education in Nineveh has requested from the \\"United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq\\" the instigation of Turkish language classes for parents.. =Media in Turkish= The current prevalence of satellite television and media exposure from Turkey may have led to the standardisation of Turkmeni towards Turkish, and the preferable language for adolescents associating with the Turkish culture.. In 2004 the Türkmeneli TV channel was launched in Kirkuk, Iraq. It broadcasts programmes in the Turkish and Arabic languages. As of 2012, Türkmeneli TV has studios in Kirkuk and Baghdad in Iraq, and in the Çankaya neighbourhood in Ankara, Turkey. Türkmeneli TV has signed agreements with several Turkish channels, such as TRT, TGRT and ATV, as well as with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus's main broadcaster BRT, to share programmes and documentaries. =Religion= The Iraqi Turkmen are predominately Muslims. The Sunni Turkmen form the majority (about 60–70%) but there is also a significant number of Turkmen practicing the Shia branch of Islam (about 30% to 40%). Nonetheless, the Turkmen are mainly secular, having internalized the secularist interpretation of state–religion affairs practiced in the Republic of Turkey since its foundation in 1923. Moreover, the fact that the Turkmen mainly live in urban areas, where they deal with trade and commerce, and their tendency to acquire higher education, the power of religious and tribal factors inherent in Iraq's political culture does not significantly affect the Turkmen.. A small minority of the Iraqi Turkmen are Catholics,Iraq's Turkmen mobilise for a post-ISIL future it is estimated their number at about 30,000. Demographics =Population= Official statistics The Iraqi Turkmen are the third largest ethnic group in Iraq. According to 2013 data from the Iraqi Ministry of Planning the Iraqi Turkmen have a population of about 3 million out of the total population of about 34.7 million (approximately 9% of the country's population). =Past censuses and controversies= An Iraqi Turkmen in Kirkuk. According to Mesut Yeğen, documents from the British Foreign Office claim that the Turkmens made a majority in the city of Erbil in 1919FO 371/4193, 27th November 1919 The 1957 Iraqi census (which is recognized as the last reliable census, as later censuses were reflections of the Arabization policies of the Ba'ath regime) recorded 567,000 Turks out of a total population of 6.3 million, forming 9% of the total Iraqi population. This put them third, behind Arabs and Kurds. However, due to the undemocratic environment, their number has always been underestimated and has long been a point of controversy. For example, in the 1957 census, the Iraqi government first claimed that there was 136,800 Turks in Iraq. However, the revised figure of 567,000 was issued after the 1958 revolution when the Iraqi government admitted that the Iraqi Turkmen population was actually more than 400% from the previous year's total.. Scott Taylor has described the political nature of the results thusly: Subsequent censuses, in 1967, 1977, 1987 and 1997, are all considered highly unreliable, due to suspicions of regime manipulation.. The 1997 census states that there was 600,000 Iraqi Turkmen out of a total population of 22,017,983, forming 2.72% of the total Iraqi population; however, this census only allowed its citizens to indicate belonging to one of two ethnicities, Arab or Kurd, this meant that many Iraqi Turkmen identified themselves as Arabs (the Kurds not being a desirable ethnic group in Saddam Hussein's Iraq), thereby skewing the true number of Iraqi Turkmen. Other estimates In 2004 Scott Taylor suggested that the Iraqi Turkmen population accounted for 2,080,000 of Iraq's 25 million inhabitants (forming 8.32% of the population) whilst Patrick Clawson has stated that the Iraqi Turkmen make up about 9% of the total population. Furthermore, international organizations such as the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization has stated that the Iraqi Turkmen community is 3 million or 9–13% of the Iraqi population. Iraqi Turkmen claim that their total population is over 3 million. Iraqi Turkmen: Push for Self-Determination Gains Momentum On the other hand, some Kurdish groups claim that the Iraqi Turkmen make up 2–3% of the Iraqi population, or approximately 500,000–800,000. =Areas of settlement= A map of Turkmeneli () on a monument in Altun Kupri (). An Iraqi Turkmen youth holding a Turkmeneli scarf. An Iraqi Turkmen woman in Istanbul, Turkey. The Iraqi Turkmen primarily inhabit northern Iraq, particularly in a region they refer to as \\"Turkmeneli\\" – which stretches from the northwest to the east at the middle of Iraq. Iraqi Turkmen consider their capital city to be Kirkuk. Liam Anderson and Gareth Stansfield describe the Turkmeneli region as follows: The Iraqi Turkmens generally consider several major cities, and small districts associated with these cities, as part of their homeland. The major cities, towns and villages claimed to be a part of Turkmeneli include: Altun Kupri, Amirli, Badra, Baghdad, Baqubah, Bashir, Daquq, Diyala, Erbil, Jalawla, Khanaqin, Kifri, Kirkuk, Kizilribat, Mandali, Miqdadiya, Mosul, Salahaddin, Sinjar, Tal Afar, Taza Khurmatu, Tuz Khurmatu, Qara Tapa, Sulaiman Bek, Yankjah. Consequently, the Turkmeneli region lies between the Arab areas of settlement to the south and Kurdish areas to the north. According to the 1957 census, the Iraqi Turkmen formed the majority of inhabitants in the city of Kirkuk, with almost 40% declaring their mother tongue as \\"Turkish\\". The second-largest Iraqi Turkmen city is Tel Afar where they make up 95% of the inhabitants. The once mainly Turkmen cities of the Diyala Province and Kifri have been heavily Kurdified and Arabized. Some Iraqi Turkmen also live outside the Turkmeneli region. For example, there is a significant community living in Iraq's capital city of Baghdad, with their size previously estimated at 300,000. An Iraqi Turkmen protest in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. =Diaspora= Most Iraqi Turkmen migrate to Turkey followed by Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. There are also Iraqi Turkmen communities living in Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Greece, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. There are many established Iraqi Turkmen diaspora communities, such as the Canadian Iraqi Turkmen Culture Association, based in Canada. Social issues The position of the Iraqi Turkmen has changed from being administrative and business classes of the Ottoman Empire to an increasingly discriminated against minority. Since the demise of the Ottoman Empire, the Iraqi Turkmen have been victims of several massacres, such as the Kirkuk Massacre of 1959. Furthermore, under the Ba'th party, discrimination against the Iraqi Turkmen increased, with several leaders being executed in 1979 as well as the Iraqi Turkmen community being victims of Arabization policies by the state, and Kurdification by Kurds seeking to push them forcibly out of their homeland.. Thus, they have suffered from various degrees of suppression and assimilation that ranged from political persecution and exile to terror and ethnic cleansing. Despite being recognized in the 1925 constitution as a constitutive entity, the Iraqi Turkmen were later denied this status; hence, cultural rights were gradually taken away and activists were sent to exile. =Massacres= Massacre of 4 May 1924 In 1924, the Iraqi Turkmen were seen as a disloyal remnant of the Ottoman Empire, with a natural tie to Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's new Turkish nationalist ideology emerging in the Republic of Turkey.. Therefore, the Iraqi Turkmen living in the region of Kirkuk posed a threat to the stability of Iraq, particularly as they did not support the ascendancy of King Faisal I to the throne. The Iraqi Turkmen were targeted by the British in collaboration with other Iraqi elements, of these, the most willing to subjugate the Iraqi Turkmen were the Iraq Levies—troops recruited from the Assyrian community that had sought refuge in Iraq from the Hakkari region of Turkey. The spark for the conflict had been a dispute between a Levi soldier and an Iraqi Turkmen shopkeeper, which was enough for the British to allow the Levies to attack the Iraqi Turkmen, resulting in the massacre of some 200 people. Kirkuk massacre of 1959 The Kirkuk massacre of 1959 came about due to the Iraqi government allowing the Iraqi Communist Party, which in Kirkuk was largely Kurdish, to target the Iraqi Turkmen.. With the appointment of Maarouf Barzinji, a Kurd, as the mayor of Kirkuk in July 1959, tensions rose following the 14 July revolution celebrations, with animosity in the city polarizing rapidly between the Kurds and Iraqi Turkmen. On 14 July 1959, Kurdish gunmen opened fire on crowds of Turkmen civilians, leaving some 20 Iraqi Turkmen dead.. Furthermore, on 15 July 1959, Kurdish soldiers of the Fourth Brigade of the Iraqi army mortared Iraqi Turkmen residential areas, destroying 120 houses. Order was restored on 17 July by military units from Baghdad. The Iraqi government referred to the incident as a \\"massacre\\" and stated that between 31 and 79 Iraqi Turkmen were killed and some 130 injured. Altun Kupri massacre in 1991 Over 135 Turkmens were massacred in 1991 during the Gulf War by the Iraqi Army.Altunköprü the ancient name of Türkmen Township =Arabization= Turks protesting in Amsterdam, the banner reads: 'Kirkuk is an Iraqi city with Turkmen characteristics'. In 1980, Saddam Hussein's government adopted a policy of assimilation of its minorities. Due to government relocation programs, thousands of Iraqi Turkmen were relocated from their traditional homelands in northern Iraq and replaced by Arabs, in an effort to Arabize the region.. Furthermore, Iraqi Turkmen villages and towns were destroyed to make way for Arab migrants, who were promised free land and financial incentives. For example, the Ba'athist government claimed that the city of Kirkuk was historically an Arab city and remained firmly in its cultural orientation. Thus, the first wave of Arabization saw Arab families move from the centre and south of Iraq into Kirkuk, many working in the expanding oil industry. Although the Turkmen were not actively forced out, new Arab quarters were established in the city and the overall demographic balance of the city changed as the Arab migrations continued. Several presidential decrees and directives from state security and intelligence organizations indicate that the Iraqi Turkmen were a particular focus of attention during the assimilation process during the Ba'th regime. For example, the Iraqi Military Intelligence issued directive 1559 on 6 May 1980 ordering the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen officials from Kirkuk, issuing the following instructions: \\"identify the places where Turkmen officials are working in governmental offices [in order] to deport them to other governorates in order to disperse them and prevent them from concentrating in this governorate [Kirkuk]\\".. In addition, on 30 October 1981, the Revolution's Command Council issued decree 1391, which authorized the deportation of Iraqi Turkmen from Kirkuk with paragraph 13 noting that \\"this directive is specially aimed at Turkmen and Kurdish officials and workers who are living in Kirkuk\\". As victims of these Arabization policies, the Turkmen suffered from land expropriation and job discrimination, and therefore would register themselves as Arabs in order to avoid discrimination.. Thus, ethnic cleansing was an element of the Ba'thist policy aimed at reducing the influence of the Iraqi Turkmen in northern Iraq's Kirkuk.. Those Iraqi Turkmen who remained in cities such as Kirkuk were subject to continued assimilation policies; school names, neighbourhoods, villages, streets, markets and even mosques with names of Turkic origin were changed to names that emanated from the Ba'th Party or from Arab heroes. Moreover, many Iraqi Turkmen villages and neighbourhoods in Kirkuk were simply demolished, particularly in the 1990s. =Turkmen–Kurdish tension and Kurdification= Iraqi Turkmen woman holding a placard written in Turkish: Kerkük'ü hiçbir güç Kürtleştiremez (\\"No power can Kurdify Kirkuk\\"). The Kurds claimed de facto sovereignty over land that Iraqi Turkmen regards as theirs, much of which included the disputed areas between Arab regions and Kurdish regions where the Turkmen are concentrated. For the Iraqi Turkmen, their identity is deeply inculcated as the rightful inheritors of the region as a legacy of the Ottoman Empire.. Thus, it is claimed that the Kurdistan Region and Iraqi government has constituted a threat to the survival of the Iraqi Turkmen through strategies aimed at eradicating or assimilating them. The largest concentration of Iraqi Turkmen was in Tal Afar and other towns and regions. The formation of the Kurdistan Region in 1991 created high animosity between the Kurds and Iraqi Turkmen, resulting in some Iraqi Turkmen being victims of Kurdification, according to Liam Anderson. The largest concentration of Iraqi Turkmen tended to be in the de facto capital of Erbil, a city in which they had assumed prominent administrative and economic positions. Thus, they increasingly came into dispute and often conflict with the ruling powers of the city, which after 1996 was the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Massoud Barzani.. According to Anderson and Stansfield, in the 1990s, tension between the Kurds and Iraqi Turkmen inflamed as the KDP and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) were institutionalized as the political hegemons of the region and, from the perspective of the Iraqi Turkmen, sought to marginalize them from the positions of authority and to subsume their culture with an all-pervading Kurdistani identity. With the support of Ankara, a new political front of Turkmen parties, the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF), was formed on 24 April 1995. The relationship between the Iraqi Turkmen Front and the KDP was tense and deteriorated as the decade went on. Iraqi Turkmen associated with the Iraqi Turkmen Front complained about harassment by Kurdish security forces. In March 2000, the Human Rights Watch reported that the KDP's security attacked the offices of the ITF in Erbil, killing two guards, following a lengthy period of disputes between the two parties. In 2002, the KDP created an Iraqi Turkmen political organization, the Turkmen National Association, that supported the further institutionalization of the Kurdistan Region. This was viewed by pro-ITF Iraqi Turkmen as a deliberate attempt to \\"buy off\\" Iraqi Turkmen opposition and break their bonds with Ankara.. Promoted by the KDP as the \\"true voice\\" of the Iraqi Turkmen, the Turkmen National Association has a pro-Kurdistani stance and has effectively weakened the ITF as the sole representative voice of the Iraqi Turkmen. Beginning in 2003, there were riots between Kurds and Turkmen in Kirkuk, a city that Turkmen views as historically theirs.The Legacy of Iraq by Benjamin Isakhan Edinburgh University Press. According to United Nations reports, the KRG and Peshmerga were \\"illegally policing Kirkurk, abducting Turkmen and Arabs and subjecting them to torture.\\" Between 2003 and 2006, 1,350 Turkmens in Tal A'far died and thousands of houses were damaged or demolished, resulting in 4,685 displaced families. Politics Between ten and twelve Turkmen individuals were elected to the transitional National Assembly of Iraq in January 2005, including five on the United Iraqi Alliance list, three from the Iraqi Turkmen Front (ITF), and either two or four from the Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan.Interesting Outcomes in Iraqi Election , Zaman Daily NewspaperThe New Iraq, The Middle East and Turkey: A Turkish View , Foundation for Political, Economic and Social Research, 2006-04-01, accessed on 2007-09-06 In the December 2005 elections, between five and seven Turkmen candidates were elected to the Council of Representatives. This included one candidate from the ITF (its leader Saadeddin Arkej), two or four from the United Iraqi Alliance, one from the Iraqi Accord Front and one from the Kurdistani Alliance.Turkmen Win Only One Seat in Kerkuk , Iraqi Turkmen Front Iraqi Turkmen have also emerged as a key political force in the controversy over the future status of northern Iraq and the Kurdistan Region. The government of Turkey has helped fund such political organizations as the Iraqi Turkmen Front, which opposes Iraqi federalism and in particular the proposed annexation of Kirkuk to the Kurdistan Regional Government.Kurds Accused Of Rigging Kirkuk Vote , Al Jazeera Tensions between the two groups over Kirkuk, however, have slowly died out and on January 30, 2006, the President of Iraq, Jalal Talabani, said that the \\"Kurds are working on a plan to give Iraqi Turkmen autonomy in areas where they are a majority in the new constitution they're drafting for the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.\\" However, it never happened and the policies of Kurdification by KDP and PUK after 2003 (with non-Kurds being pressed to move) have prompted serious inter-ethnic problems..

Among other Maratha chieftains Govind Rao Pandit lost his life in the action. Before his departure from India, the Durrani chief consigned large tracts of country to the Rohilla chieftains, and while Dhunde Khan received Shikohabad, Inayat Khan, son of Hafiz Rahmat Khan received the district of Etawah. This was then in the possession of the Marathas, and accordingly in 1762 a Rohilla force was sent under Mullah Mohsin Khan to wrest the assigned property from the Marathas. This force was opposed near the town of Etawah by Kishan Rao and Bala Rao Pandits, who were defeated and compelled to seek safety in flight across the Yamuna. Siege was then laid to the fort of Etawah by Mohsin Khan; but the fort was soon surrendered by its commander, and the district fell into the hands of the Rohillas. The occupation, however, was merely nominal at first; the zamindars refused to pay revenue to Inayat Khan and, secure in their mud forts set his authority at defiance. Strong reinforcements were sent to the Rohillas, including some artillery, under Sheikh Kuber and Mullah Baz Khan, and many of the smaller forts were levelled to the grounds; but in their ravine fortresses the zamindars of Kamait in the trans-Yamuna tract still resisted the authority of Inayat Khan. Hafiz Rahmat and Inayat Khan then came in person to Etawah and operations were vigorously pressed against the refractory zamindars. Ultimately an annual tribute was agreed to by the latter. Hafiz Rahmat then departed to Bareilly, and Rohilla garrisons were established at convenient places in the district. Meanwhile, a new minister arose at Delhi called Najib Khan, better known as Najib-ud-daula, Amir-ul- umra, Shuja-ud-daula succeeded Safdar Jang as Nawab Wazir and occupied most of the Bangash possessions as far as Aligarh, with the exception of those granted by the Durrani to the Rohillas after he battle of Pandit. But the wazir's hostility to the Farrukhabad Afghans had not abated one jot, and in 1762 he persuaded Najib-ud-daula to join him in an attack on Farrukhabad. The attack was beaten off by the aid of Hafiz Rahmat Khan and matters once more settled down peacefully. In 1766, the Marathas under Mulhar Rao, who had been awaiting their opportunity, once more crossed the Jamuna and attacked Phaphund, where a Rohilla force under Muhammad Hasan Khan eldest son of Mohsin Khan, was posted. On receipt of this news Hafiz Rahmat advanced from Bareilly to oppose the Marathas. He was joined near Phaphund by Sheikh Kuber, the Rohilla governor of Etawah, and prepared to give battle; but Mulhar Rao refused to risk an engagement and once more retired across the Jamuna. The ambitions Najib-ud- daula had been considerably irritated by the intervention of the Rohillas on behalf of Ahmad Khan Bangladesh in 1762; and though he had been too busily engaged otherwise to pursue his plans of revenge before, he began in 1770 to plot the downfall of Hafiz Rahmat Khan. Accordingly, a Maratha army was invited to Delhi for the purpose of first wresting Farrukhabad from Ahmad Khan and of afterwards invading Rohikhand. The united forces of Najib-ud-daula and the Marathas advanced from Delhi; but at Koil Najib-ud-daula fell ill and retraced his steps, leaving his eldest son, Zabita Khan to operate with the Marathas. Zabita Khan however, was by no means disposed to fight against his brother Afghans. The Marathas, knowing this, kept him practically a prisoner in their camp and he requested Hafiz Rahmat Khan to obtain his release. Hafiz Rahmat Khan accordingly opened negotiations with the Marathas for the release of Zabita Khan; but the Maratha leaders demanded as their price the surrender of the jagirs of Etawah and Shikohabad. Hafiz Rahmat Khan was not disposed to agree to those terms, and while negotiations were proceeding for buying off the Marathas Zabita Khan escaped. Several desultory engagements now took place between the Marathas and the Afghan forces. Inayat khan was summoned by his father to Farrukhabad in order that he might be consulted regarding the surrendering of his jagirs. But although Dhunde Khan agreed to give up Shikohabad Inayat Khan refused to surrender Etawah. Ultimately, disgusted with his father's arrangements he returned to Bareilly, and his father on his own responsibility sent orders to Sheikh Kuber, the Rohilla governor of Etawah, to surrender the fort to the Marathas. The Marathas now marched to Etawah, but as the orders had not yet reached him Sheikh Kuber gave them battle. Several desperate assaults were made on the fort of Etawah which were all beaten off, but finally it was handed over to the Marathas in accordance with hafiz Rahmat Khan's orders, and the Rohillas quit the district, leaving it once more in the hands of the Marathas. Later in the same year, 1771, the Marathas advanced to Delhi and reinstated the emperor Shah Alam, who had cast in his lot with them, on the throne. They were now masters of the empire and Zabita Khan determined to oppose them. Assembling his forces, he attacked the Marathas near Delhi but was signally defeated, and in 1772 the Marathas overran a large portion of Rohilkhand and captured Najafgarh, where Zabita Khan's family resided and his treasure lay. Under the Government of Oudh Zabita Khan then solicited the aid of Shuja-ud-daula, Nawab Wazir of Oudh; but the Nawab declined to interfere unless Hafiz Rahmat Khan applied on his behalf. Negotiations were commenced with Shah Alam and the Marathas for the restoration of Zabita Khan's family and the evacuation of Rohilkhand. The Marathas agreed to accept 40 lakhs of rupees, provided that Shuja-ud-daula made himself responsible for the payment; but Shuja-ud-daula now declined to enter into any such engagement unless Hafiz Rahmat Khan gave him a bond for the money. To this Hafiz Rahmat Khan consented, the bond was signed and the Marathas retired from Rohilkhand. In 1773, the Marathas proposed to attack Shuja-ud-daula and attempted to gain the help of Hifaz Rahmat Khan. The latter refused to him them. Instead he sent information to Shuja-ud-daula concerning what he had done, and on the strength of this requested restoration of his bond. Shuja-ud-daula expressed his approval of Hafiz Rahmat Khan's conduct and promised the restitution of the bond when the Marathas as had been defeated. The Marathas were defeated soon after at Asadpur by the combined forces of Shuja-ud-daula and Hafiz Rahmat Khan, with the result that they quit not only Rohilkhand but Delhi also. Shuja-ud-daula then returned to Oudh, but denied ever having promised to restore the bond. He next seduced many of the Afghan Rohillas from their allegiance to Hafiz Rahmat Khan, and then proceeded to eject the Maratha garrisons from Etawah and Shikohabad in spite of Rahmat Khan's remonstrance. He ever went further and called on Hafiz Rahmat Khan to discharge the balance of 35 lakhs due on the bond. This was only a pretext for provoking hostilities for which purpose the Nawab had already begun to assemble an army; and Hafiz Rahmat Khan having failed to pay up, the Nawab advanced to the Ganges. The last scene in the tangled history of the period closed with the defeat of Hafiz Rahmat Khan by Shuja-ud-daula who was aided by a British force, at the battle of Miranpur Katra in the Shahjahanpur district on 23 April 1774 Etawah under the Oudh Government. From 1774 to 1801, the district of Arvind remained under the government of Oudh. Little occurred to disturb it during this period and little is known regarding its history. For many years the administration of the district was in the hands of Mian Almas Ali Khan. Ails were stationed, we know, at Etawah, Kudarkot and Phaphunnd. One of those who held office at the last named placed was Raja Bhagmal or Baramal. The latter was by Caste a Jat and was sister's son to Almas Ali Khan, who was by birth a Hindu but was subsequently made a eunuch and converted to Islam. Raja Bhagmal built the fort at Phaphund and the old mosque which still bears an inscription recording thenamed of donor. Almas Ali Khan was, recording to Colonie Sleeman,\\"the greatest and best man\\" Oudh ever produced; be amassed great wealth, but having no descendant, he spent his money for the benefit of the people committed to his charge. He held court occasionally at Kudarkot where he built a fort, of which the massive ruins still remain. At Etawah the amils are said to have resided in the fort; but the building was destroyed by Shuja-ud-daula in consequence of the representations of the Etawah townspeople that, so long as the amils occupied such an impregnable residence, they would never do anything but oppress the people.http://etawah.nic.in/history2.htm Geography Boundaries and Area The district of Auraiya lies in the southwestern portion of Uttar Pradesh 26° 21\\" and 27° 01\\" north latitude and 78° 45\\" and 79° 45\\" east longitude and forms a part of the Kanpur Division. It is bounded on the north by the districts of Kannauj, western border adjoins tehsil Bharthana of the Etawah district and the district of Gwalior. The eastern frontier marches with the district of Kanpur Dehat, and along the south lie Jalaun. The total area according to the statistics of 1991-92 is calculated to be 2054 square kilometer. Topography Auraiya lies entirely in the Gangetic plain, but its physical features vary considerably and are determined by the rivers which cross it. The area of Etawah and Auraiya districts is divisible into four portions of district natural characteristics. The first of these consists of the country lying north-east of the Senger river, which runs across it from west to east almost parallel to the Yamuna; it includes the northern portions of tahsils Etawah and Bharthana. The second tract lies south of the Senger and extends as far as the high lands immediately overlooking the Yamuna. It comprises a slightly undulating switch of country covering portions of Etawah and Bharthana and the bulk of an Auraiya Tehsil of Auraiya District. The tract includes the parts of some tehsils that adjoins the river Yamuna. Beyond the Yamuna, stretching from the borders of tahsil Bah in Agra to the confluence of the Sindh, Kuwari, Chambal and Yamuna rivers, lies the high and broken country formerly known as Janibrast. These tracts differ from each other in a very marked degree though each presents general conformity within its own limits. Soils In the Pachar and Ghar tracts the soils are broadly distinguishable into dumat or loam, matiyar or clay, and bhur or sand. Besides these are found everywhere low-lying beds of clay in which water collects during the rains and rice alone can be grown; these clay beds are known as Jhabar. In the Kurka and trans-Yamuna tract several other classes of soil are met with. In the ravines of the river and the land immediately adjacent to them are found fields full of kankar and gravel, the soil of which is called Pakar; this is in fact a sandy soil mixed with gravel. Below the ravines and in the wider valleys between them the soil that is flooded by the Yamuna is called kachhar; and along the edges of the streams there is a rich strip of alluvial deposit which is known as Tir. Both kachhar and tir vary greatly in quality: some patches of these soils consist of a rich reddish clay which lets at a high rental; other portions are composed of a dark colored loam; and others again are while and sandy in appearance and less fertile. River System The rivers and streams of the Auraiya and Etawah districts jointly consist of the Yamuna its two large affluent, the Chambal and, the Kuwari; the Sengar, and its tributary Sirsa; The Rind or Arind and its tributaries the Ahenya, the Puraha and the Pandu. Demographics Inspection of Women Hospital As of 2011 India census, Auraiya had a population of 87,736. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Auraiya has an average literacy rate of 87.25%, higher than the national average of 74.37%; with 90.88% of the males and 83.23% of females literate. 12.16% of the population is under 6 years of age.  Language and Script  The language of practically the entire population is what is known as western Hindi. The returns of the census 1981 showed that this language was spoken by about 96.8 per cent of the population. In 1971, the percentage of Hindi speaking persons was 96.4. Western Hindi is split up into several subdivisions. In 1981, the language known as Hindustani or Urdu was spoken by about 3.10 per cent (3.35 per cent in 1961) of the people, representing for the most part the inhabitants of Etawah city, while the bulk of the people spoke Antarbedi, or its variant called Pachharua, so called after the tract of that name. In the trans-Yamuna portion of the district the dialect is known as Bhadauri, which is a form of Bundelkhandi, itself a branch of Hindi. It derives its name from Bhadawar, the home of the Bhadoria Rajputs. A few people also speak Punjabi, Bengali or Sindhi. Devanagari script is being used for Hindi and its allied branches such as Garhwali, Kumauni etc. and the script used for Urdu is Persian.

System  Hung Fut is considered to be a hybrid system. Its philosophies are a mixture of two martial art systems: the powerful, hard style of Hung Gar with the flowing, soft style of Fut Gar (Buddha's palm) forms that develop body coordination. Hung Fut is a combat method that uses economy of movement in order to achieve efficiency. Its strategies are to try to throw the opponent into an awkward position that makes defense difficult and counterattack unlikely. There is no need to keep contact with an opponent, as the system uses interchangeable and flexible movements. The system also includes techniques from Fut Jeung which is thought to be a Shaolin Buddhist method, and ten animal styles (snake, tiger, leopard, lion, eagle, crane, monkey, elephant, horse and dragon) as well as \\"8 Drunken Immortal\\" forms (based on the personality traits of the 8 heavenly deities of Chinese traditional religion), \\"4 Afflictions/Cripples\\" forms (a deceptive mimicry of one who is crippled) and a left-handed form (based on the legend of a famous general fighting while holding the infant son of a Chinese emperor). The left-handed form is practiced as a single-handed form, with the right held behind the back, at the waistline. As per oral communication from Grand Master Hung Kam Pui, the single handed form (Duhk Bei Kyuhn) was developed by Hung Jiu Sing for one of his students, who only had one arm. There is also a sword form that is practiced in the same fashion. This is the style that Donnie Yen used in his movie, Dragon, after learning it from Hung Kam Pui. There are somewhat different lineages and succession stories listed by various Hung Fut schools around the world. The stories of the masters vary also from account to account. As the style has moved around the world, the content of the system—number and names of forms, types of power used, stances, techniques, theory, and training methods—has also changed, leading to a large variation from school to school. 8th generation grandmaster, Tai Yim, the adopted son of Hung Yu Chung, the 7th generation grandmaster, immigrated from China to the United States in 1977. He traveled to the United States to fulfill the wish of Hung Yu Chung to spread Hung Fut to the west. He opened his first United States side school in Wheaton Maryland in 1978 and now teaches in Kensington, Maryland, a suburb outside of Washington D.C.http://www.taiyimkungfu.com Tai Yim Kung Fu The 9th Generation Masters, inducted by 8th generation Grandmaster Tai Yim include: Master Linh Thai, Master Eugene Chung, Master John Miller, Master Mike Sutton, Master Vicky Miller, Master Shelton Lee Jr, Master Ricardo Chen, and Master Jae Ha Hwang. Some of his most notable students include Joe Myers, Don Niam, Hung Stewart (International Grand Champion), Phung Lee ( International Grand Champion), Ed Pratt (National Full contact fighting and Forms Champion), Antwann Rawls (Forms and Fighting National Grand Champion), James Whitley (Forms and Fighting International Grand Champion), Philippe Prosper (Forms and Fighting International Grand Champion), Lester Solomon (Asst. Chief Instructor), Michael Hammond (Asst. Chief Instructor Forms and Fighting International Grand Champion), Stephen Roberts (Asst. Chief Instructor).http://www.taiyimkungfu.com Donniamstudio.com http://www.hungfutpai.net There are other masters of this generation who are in other countries around the world, such as in Hong Kong and Raymond Man Ying Nap in Scotland.Hung Fut Scotland In 2007, Tai Yim sent top instructors, James Whitley and Philippe Prosper to São Paulo to represent him in introducing Hung Fut Kung Fu to Brazil in the International Grandmasters Exhibition and Kung Fu Tournament with Grandmasters from the United States Traditional Kung Fu and Wushu Federation. The official Grandmaster for the 8th generation is controversial. Hung Kam Pui from Hong Kong, is the official chairman and founder of the HUNG FUT PAI CHINESE KUNG FU ASSOCIATION. A semi complete family tree, full of a definitive list of Hung Fut Pai teachers is here: Hung Fut Family Tree. NYC has a strong Hung Fut Pai branch (Hung Kam Pui) that is very active in the Hung Fut community.NYC HUNG FUT PAI BRANCH The NYC branch is run by SIFU Phil Auffray Hung Man Fu Another Sifu worth mentioning is Sifu Jai A.K.A. Lee Tai-Luhng. All of these masters practice with dedication in NYC and frequently return to China to study with master Hung Kam Pui. Unique features Hung Fut is truly an original martial art form from China. Its roots go back to the Shaolin temple. Hung Fut is a modified fighting form that has brought together the combined knowledge of many kung fu masters and styles. All Hung Fut forms start with the left side of the body. The Hung Fut system includes more than twenty weapons, the best known of which is the left- handed staff style. There are traditionally ten different staff forms taught; each successive one increases in difficulty and intensity. The staff is the first weapon taught in the system and also the last. The final staff form is the most famous and mysterious. Most commonly known as the \\"mad devil staff\\" it was traditionally passed down only to the one or few select students appointed to succeed a teacher. This form was used by the sixth generation Grandmaster, Hung Jiu Sing, also known as the \\"White Haired Devil\\", and there are several students known to have received his transmittion of this.

In May 2014, she was jailed for three counts of doing an act tending to pervert the course of justice in R v Huhne and Pryce. She was disbarred and removed from the judiciary. Legal career Briscoe studied Law at Newcastle University graduating with a 2:2, financing her studies with several casual jobs, including working in a hospice. She took an MA at the University of Warwick. She was called to the bar in 1983. After pupillage with Michael Mansfield, she joined the chambers of Barbara Calvert. In 1996 she became an assistant recorder, a part-time judge. Briscoe practised in criminal law and fraud, principally defending. She also undertook tribunal work, public inquiries, inquests and acted as president of Mental Health Tribunals. A room was named after her in the Newcastle University Students' Union building, which was later renamed after her conviction. In 2007 she unsuccessfully applied to become a QC. In October 2012 Briscoe was suspended from the judiciary after arrest and questioning by police. On 6 August 2014, Briscoe was removed as a member of the judiciary. Her honorary degree of Doctor of Laws from the University of Wolverhampton awarded to her in 2011 was removed by the university's nominations committee in August 2014. On 15 April 2016, Briscoe was disbarred as a barrister for three professional misconduct charges, which were: \\"engaging in conduct which was dishonest and discreditable to a barrister; engaging in conduct which was prejudicial to the administration of justice; and engaging in conduct which was likely to diminish public confidence in the legal profession, the administration of justice, or bring the profession into disrepute.\\" Personal life Briscoe's parents emigrated to the United Kingdom from Jamaica in the 1950s.Briscoe on The Book Show website Constance's mother Carmen had seven children, including Constance, by her husband George Briscoe. She then had another four children by Garfield Eastman. Constance attended Sacred Heart Catholic School, Camberwell. Briscoe is known for her books Ugly (2006) and Beyond Ugly (2008), in which she claims she was verbally and physically abused by her mother and stepfather as a child. She underwent facial and other cosmetic surgery at university. She often spoke publicly about her experiences. Her mother, Carmen Briscoe- Mitchell, denies these claims and sued her daughter and her publishers Hodder & Stoughton for libel. The case was concluded in Briscoe's favour, when a jury in the High Court unanimously accepted her contention that her allegations were substantially true. Briscoe's mother stated she wished to have this civil decision reversed in the light of Briscoe's later criminal conviction for perverting the course of justice. Police have confirmed she also faces criminal investigation in relation to the evidence supporting the civil judgment in her favour. Briscoe has two children from a relationship with lawyer Adam Wilson. A later long relationship with barrister Anthony Arlidge QC ended in 2010. Conviction On 6 October 2012, Briscoe was arrested in Clapham and subsequently bailed pending further enquiries, as a result of a police investigation. No announcement was made at that time as to the nature of any allegations against her. The Lord Chief Justice and Lord Chancellor suspended Briscoe from the judiciary pending the outcome of the police investigation. In February 2013, at the trial of Vicky Pryce, police stated that Briscoe's arrest related to the release of information to the press on behalf of Pryce contrary to statements Briscoe had made, and the police could not rely upon Briscoe as a \\"witness of truth\\". Pryce was a friend and neighbour of Briscoe. Briscoe was not charged but remained on police bail. On 12 June 2013 it was announced she would be charged with two counts of intending to pervert the course of justice and would attend court on 24 June 2013. The first count alleged that she provided police with two inaccurate statements, and the second alleged that she produced a copy of her witness statement that had been altered. On 1 May 2014 she was found guilty at the Old Bailey of three charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice, by lying to police, falsifying a witness statement, and providing a false document to an expert witness. On 2 May 2014 she was jailed for 16 months, she began her sentence at HM Prison Holloway.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/judge-jails-arrogant-liar-briscoe- for-16-months-92337rn5vwx Briscoe received an early release from jail in November 2014, before she had served half her sentence.

Later, Georgia Tech was chosen as the site of the 1996 Summer Olympics aquatic venue, and the Aquatic Center was constructed next to the SAC. The Aquatic Center cost $16.8 million, and featured competitions in swimming, synchronized swimming, diving, water polo, and the swimming segment of the modern pentathlon competition.1996 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 1. p. 540.1996 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 3. pp. 448, 460. The stadium had a capacity of 14,600 at the time. It also had a temporary pool for the water polo competitions seating 4,000. After the games, it has been used as a recreational facility for Georgia Tech students and faculty. Initially an outdoor stadium with a roof to protect spectators and competitors from rain, the Aquatic Center was renovated between 2001 and 2003 to enclose the Center completely. The seating capacity was reduced to 1,950. Above the Olympic pool, an upper floor of multi-purpose courts was added by suspending it from the roof; this set a record for the world's largest suspended concrete structure. At this point it was renamed to the Campus Recreation Center, or CRC. The SAC also had a smaller recreational pool outdoors, which was contained in a pressurized bubble. During the conversion to the CRC, the pool was redesigned to be larger, and was enclosed and fully connected to the rest of the facility. Technology Georgia Tech- designed solar panels cover the roof of the building and supply a significant percentage of its energy. The Campus Recreation Center is a very modern building in many ways. The roof over the competition pool is entirely covered in Georgia Tech Research Institute-designed solar panels, which produce electricity (up to 340 kilowatts, averaging about 400 megawatt-hours per year) to supplement the Georgia Tech power grid, and also heat pool water which is pumped through pipes in the roof. The competition pool is configurable for any event, with a removable bulkhead in the middle of the pool, and a false bottom that can be used to adjust the depth and slope of the pool. In addition to the competition pool, the CRC's recreational pool has six recreational lap lanes, a current channel, and a water slide.

It was considered as the highest and most prestigious office that one could attain next to the throne itself. It was established during King Beophung's 18th year as a king (531) and survived until the end of Silla. Selection The Sangdaedeung was chosen from among those men of \\"true bone\\" (jingeol) lineage in Silla's strict aristocratic social order. He presided over the Hwabaek Council (화백, 和白), an advisory and decision–making committee composed of other high–ranking officials holding the office of Daedeung (대등, 大等). The council‘s primary duties lay in rendering decisions on important state matters, such as succession to the throne and declarations of war.Lee, Ki–baik. A New History of Korea (translated by Edward W. Wagner with Edward J. Shultz). (Cambridge, MA:Harvard University Press, 1984), p. 53. Its existence dated back to the early Silla state and reflected that state‘s tribal origins. Throughout Silla history the Hwabaek Council led by the Sangdaedeung served as a check on the king‘s authority. During the middle period of Silla, following that state‘s unification of the peninsula, the focus of government authority shifted from the Hwabaek Council and Sangdaedeung to the Chancellery Office (Jipsabu, 집사부, 執事部) and its Chief Minister (Sijung, 시중, 侍中, or alternately Jungsi, 中侍), an office instituted in Silla in 651 as the highest organ in the central government apparatus. This reflected the monarchy‘s efforts to curb the power of an independent nobility by relying on the Chinese inspired Jipsabu rather than the Hwabaek Council, whose existence was predicated on age old aristocratic and clan prerogatives. In the wake of several challenges to his authority King Sinmun dared even execute the Sangdaedeung Gungwan in 681 for complicity in the revolt of Kim Heumdol (김흠돌, 金欽突). Despite these attempts to limit its power, the office of Sangdaedeung remained until the end of Silla the highest and most prestigious office one could attain short of the throne itself. In the later period of Silla, during which the throne was continuously contested, several monarchs emerged from the office of Sangdaedeung. The Sangdaedeung was also referred to as Sangsin (상신, 上臣).

This article discusses the history of prescription in English. For a more general discussion, see linguistic prescription. Origins Languages, especially standard varieties or official languages used in courts of law, for administration of government, and for the promulgation of official works, tend to acquire formally regulated norms over time. Once English became the language of administration of law in England, a form of late Middle English called chancery English became such a standard. When William Caxton introduced printing with movable type into England, the norms of his grammar and spelling were taken largely from chancery English. However, the \\"correction\\" of English grammar was not a large subject of formal study until the 18th century. Poet John Dryden remarked that the grammar in use in his day (second half of the 1600s) was an improvement over the usage of William Shakespeare. Dryden was himself the first to promulgate the rule that a sentence must not end with a preposition. Samuel Johnson's 1755 dictionary contributed to the standardization of English spelling. More influentially, the first of a long line of prescriptionist usage commentators, Robert Lowth, published A Short Introduction to English Grammar in 1762. Lowth's grammar is the source of many of the prescriptive shibboleths that are studied in schools and was the first of a long line of usage commentators to judge the language in addition to describing it. For example, the following footnote from his grammar is, in turn, descriptive and prescriptive: \\"Whose is by some authors made the Possessive Case of which, and applied to things as well as persons; I think, improperly.\\" Lowth's method included criticising \\"false syntax\\"; his examples of false syntax were culled from Shakespeare, the King James Bible, John Donne, John Milton, Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, and other famous writers. A number of his judgments were reinforced by analogies to Latin grammar, though it was his stated principle that such an analogy should not in itself be the basis for English prescriptions. Thus for example he criticises Addison's sentence \\"Who should I meet the other night, but my old friend?\\" on the grounds that the thing acted upon should be in the \\"Objective Case\\", corresponding, as he says earlier, to an accusative in Latin. (Descriptive critics, on the other hand, would take this example and others as evidence from noted writers that \\"who\\" can refer to direct objects in English.) Lowth's ipse dixits appealed to those who wished for certainty and authority in their language. Lowth's grammar was not written for children; nonetheless, within a decade of its appearance, versions of it were adapted for schools, and Lowth's stylistic opinions acquired the force of law in the classroom. Wider dissemination During the 19th century, with the rise of popular journalism, the common usage of a tightly-knit educated and governing class was extended to a more widely literate public than before or since, through the usage of editors of newspapers and magazines. A broader market for usage guides therefore developed. In general, these attempted to elucidate the distinctions between different words and constructions, promoting some and condemning others as unclear, declassé, or simply wrong. Perhaps the best-known and most historically important text of this sort was Henry Watson Fowler's idiosyncratic and much praised Dictionary of Modern English Usage. Originally published in 1926, it was extensively revised for the 1996 third edition, and remains a primary reference for many educated speakers and editors. Besides Fowler, other writers in this tradition include the 19th-century poet and editor William Cullen Bryant, and, in the 20th-century, Theodore Bernstein and William Safire. Contemporary stylebooks such as the Associated Press Stylebook, from the Associated Press in the United States, or The Times Style and Usage Guide, from The Times in the United Kingdom, are prescriptive in intent, for use by editors of their respective publications to standardise presentation. Criticism During the second half of the 20th century, the prescriptivist tradition of usage commentators started to fall under increasing criticism. Thus, works such as the Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage, appearing in 1993, attempt to describe usage issues of words and syntax as they are actually used by writers of note, rather than to judge them by standards derived from logic, fine distinctions, or Latin grammar.

Summers are long and hot, from early April to mid-October, with the monsoon season in between. Beginning of March sees a reversal in the direction of wind, from the north-western direction, to the south-western. These bring the hot waves from Rajasthan, carrying sand and are called \\"Loo\\". The months of April to May see a time of hot prickling heat. Monsoon arrives at the end of June, bringing some respite from the heat, but increasing humidity at the same time. Winter starts in late November and peaks in January and is notorious for its heavy fog. Extreme temperatures range from −0.6 °C to 43.5 °C. The annual mean temperature is 25 °C monthly mean temperatures range from 13 °C to 32 °C. The average annual rainfall is approximately 720 mm most of which is during the monsoons in July and August.

Touhey (26 February 1865 – 10 January 1923) was a celebrated player of the uilleann pipes. His innovative technique and phrasing, his travels back and forth across America to play on the variety and vaudeville stage, and his recordings made his style influential among Irish-American pipers. He can be seen as the greatest contributor to a distinctive American piping style. Life \\"Patsy\\" Touhey was born 26 February 1865, near Loughrea, County Galway, Ireland. According to Captain Francis O'Neill in his seminal work \\"Irish Minstrels and Musicians\\" Touhey was the third generation of accomplished pipers stemming from his grandfather, Michael Twohill (the original spelling, b. ca. 1800), his father James (b. 1839) and his uncle Martin, who were considered accomplished players. The family arrived in Boston around 1868, and his father arranged for Touhey's instruction from Bartley Murphy of County Mayo. However at the age of ten Patsy lost his father and awhile later laid the pipes aside. In his late teens he strayed into a Bowery music hall where John Eagan, the \\"White Piper\\" of Galway, was engaged. Enthralled by Eagan's virtuosity he took up the instrument again, and under the instruction of Eagan and Billy Taylor of Philadelphia soon became a master. Touhey and Eagan toured the northeastern United States with \\"Harrigan's Double Hibernian Co., Irish and American Tourists\\" in 1885 and 1886. This was Touhey's apparent introduction to theatrical life. Harrigan's company starred Jerry Cohan, the father of George M. Cohan, later a famous songwriter and showman. Despite a persistent legend, there is no evidence that Touhey played publicly for the step-dancing of George M. Cohan, who would have been seven or eight years old at the time. Between 1886 and 1895 Touhey appeared in several theatre productions including \\"Inshavogue\\" and \\"The Ivy Leaf.\\" At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago he played at the Irish Village, one of two rival Irish pavilions, and was later engaged for the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis (Louisiana Purchase Exposition). From about 1896 until 1921 he played in vaudeville skits, trading jokes with his wife Mary and their on and off partner Charles Henry Burke. The shows included slapstick, low-brow gags, Irish nostalgia, and a piping finale to which Mary Touhey danced. Chicago Police Chief Francis O'Neill, the prominent compiler of Irish dance tunes, called him, \\"the genial wizard of the Irish pipers . . . A stranger to jealousy, his comments are never sarcastic or unkind, neither does he display any tendency to monopolize attention in company when other musicians are present.” Touhey lived on Bristow Street in the Bronx, New York City, from at least 1900 until 1908. He and Mary lived in rural East Haddam, Connecticut 1908–1919, then in Freeport, New York 1919–1922. In 1922 he moved back to the Bronx. He died on 10 January 1923, and is buried in St. Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx. Playing style Touhey played left-handed, in a mirror image of the typical position. He used concert-pitch instruments made by the Taylor brothers of Philadelphia. In performing dance music, he played fast but deviated from strict tempo to bring out the character of the tune. He used the regulators (three keyed pipes lying under the heel of the hand) not to keep the rhythm, but to emphasise the broader structure of the piece. He combined legato passages with \\"tight\\" (staccato) ornaments—runs, triplets and backstitching—as well as crans, all executed with the highest proficiency. However, he did not employ certain ornaments in common use today, such as raising the chanter off the knee to swell a note's volume and intensity. In these ways his style contrasts with the prominent influences on current piping who stayed in Ireland—Willie Clancy, Johnny Doran, Seamus Ennis, John Potts, and Leo Rowsome. Most uilleann pipes have three drones and three regulators. Touhey's middle drone was replaced by a regulator with a single key that sounded an E-note, which would otherwise have been unavailable. Their current owner, Sean McKiernan, plays them . Some surviving recordings show how Touhey often switched smoothly from a jig or slow air to a reel. Another unusual performance device was to play as an encore the well-known American piece \\"Turkey in the Straw\\", performed in piping style. \\"He takes the audience by storm,\\" wrote Captain Francis O'Neill, \\"even when composed of mixed nationalities.” His music can be heard on three 78rpm sides recorded by Victor in 1919: two medleys of reels and one of jigs. A fourth medley comprising the Stack of Barley and other hornpipes was recorded but not released. Two of his 78 recordings may be heard on the two volume CD The Wheels of the World, which focuses on early recordings of Irish-American musicians. An earlier negotiation with Edison had fallen through over money, but as early as 1901 Touhey advertised a list of 150 tunes and recorded the cylinders one by one at home, filling orders at $10 per dozen. Several dozen of these survive, and more examples of his playing can be heard on cylinders made by Captain O'Neill. The two sources can be differentiated as either Touhey or O'Neill's voice introduces the player and the piece . It was one of O'Neill's cylinders that prompted the Gaelic scholar Father Richard Henebry to declare, \\"[Touhey's performance] has the life of a reel and the terrible pathos of a caoine. It represents to me human man climbing the empyrean heights, and when he had almost succeeded, then tumbling, tumbling down to hell, and expressing his sense of eternal failure on the way. The Homeric ballads and the new Brooklyn Bridge are great, but Patsy Touhey's rendering of 'The Shaskeen Reel' is a far bigger achievement.” Some others, notably Brother Gildas O'Shea of Kerry, disdained Touhey's style as outside the tradition. Asked whether Touhey's recordings had influenced his own playing, Gildas replied, \\"No, I was learning the pipes at the time.\\" However generally pipers were in awe of Touhey's playing; Séamus Ennis, writing in the liner notes of Dublin fiddler Tommy Potts's Liffey Banks LP, said that he and his father considered Touhey's playing \\"hyper-phenomenal,\\" and that he considered Touhey \\"the best of the men who came before my father.\\" Touhey left no children but several pupils, including Michael Carney and Michael Morris. His style can be heard in the playing of many others, most of whom were either born in or spent considerable time in the United States, including Michael Gallagher, Paddy Lavin, Tom Busby, Tom Ennis, Hugh McCormick, Eddie Mullaney, Joe Shannon and Andy Conroy. Tom Busby was a student of Carney's and described the style of these pipers in various articles and letters printed in An Píobaire, the newsletter of Na Píobairí Uilleann. This close-fingered way of playing Busby always described as the Connaught style of piping. The late Thomas Standeven studied with Busby, among others, and he in turn passed on his learning to many students, some of whom are well known in piping circles, and who went on to teach others in their turn. The style of these American-based players differs in various ways from that of players recorded in Ireland, but the possibly unique features of an American style are hard to discern now, due to the lack of recorded evidence.

During the editing of the film he clashed with producer Robert Stigwood who reportedly wanted dialogue scenes removed and replaced with more musical sequences, so that the accompanying soundtrack recording could be expanded to a double-album. Moyle refused to make the cuts so Stigwood fired him and made the cuts himself. In the eighties he wrote a novel that was never published but became the basis for his screenplay of his movie Pump Up the Volume, which he also directed. It was released in 1990. Moyle has since directed The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag (1992), Empire Records (1995), New Waterford Girl (1999) - for which he won the Best Direction Canadian Comedy Award in 2001, XChange, and the made-for-TV movies Jailbait (2000) and Man in the Mirror: The Michael Jackson Story (2004).

The commandments were introduced in the paper \\"In Pursuit of a 'Ten Commandments' for Computer Ethics\\" by Ramon C. Barquin as a means to create \\"a set of standards to guide and instruct people in the ethical use of computers.\\" They follow the Internet Advisory Board's memo on ethics from 1987. The Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics copies the archaic style of the Ten Commandments from the King James Bible. The commandments have been widely quoted in computer ethics literature but also have been criticized by both the hacker communityComputer Ethics – Lecture 10 and some in academia. For instance, Dr. Ben Fairweather of the \\"Centre for Computing and Social Responsibility\\" has described them as \\"simplistic\\" and overly restrictive.CCSR:Commentary on the 'Ten Commandments for Computer Ethics' ISC2, one of the thought leaders in the information security industry, has referred to the commandments in developing its own ethics rules.  The Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics # Thou shalt not use a computer to harm other people. # Thou shalt not interfere with other people's computer work. # Thou shalt not snoop around in other people's computer files. # Thou shalt not use a computer to steal. # Thou shalt not use a computer to bear false witness. # Thou shalt not copy or use proprietary software for which you have not paid (without permission). # Thou shalt not use other people's computer resources without authorization or proper compensation. # Thou shalt not appropriate other people's intellectual output. # Thou shalt think about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing. # Thou shalt always use a computer in ways that ensure consideration and respect for other humans. = Exegesis = * Commandment 1 *: Simply put: Do not use the computer in ways that may harm other people. *: Explanation: This commandment says that it is unethical to use a computer to harm another user. It is not limited to physical injury. It includes harming or corrupting other users' data or files. The commandment states that it is wrong to use a computer to steal someone's personal information. Manipulating or destroying files of other users is ethically wrong. It is unethical to write programs, which on execution lead to stealing, copying or gaining unauthorized access to other users' data. Being involved in practices like hacking, spamming, phishing or cyber bullying does not conform to computer ethics. * Commandment 2 *: Simply put: Do not use computer technology to cause interference in other users' work. *: Explanation: Computer software can be used in ways that disturb other users or disrupt their work. Viruses, for example, are programs meant to harm useful computer programs or interfere with the normal functioning of a computer. Malicious software can disrupt the functioning of computers in more ways than one. It may overload computer memory through excessive consumption of computer resources, thus slowing its functioning. It may cause a computer to function wrongly or even stop working. Using malicious software to attack a computer is unethical. * Commandment 3 *: Simply put: Do not spy on another person's computer data. *: Explanation: We know it is wrong to read someone's personal letters. On the same lines, it is wrong to read someone else's email messages or files. Obtaining data from another person's private files is nothing less than breaking into someone's room. Snooping around in another person's files or reading someone else's personal messages is the invasion of his privacy. There are exceptions to this. For example, spying is necessary and cannot be called unethical when it is done against illegitimate use of computers. For example, intelligence agencies working on cybercrime cases need to spy on the internet activity of suspects. * Commandment 4 *: Simply put: Do not use computer technology to steal information. *: Explanation: Stealing sensitive information or leaking confidential information is as good as robbery. It is wrong to acquire personal information of employees from an employee database or patient history from a hospital database or other such information that is meant to be confidential. Similarly, breaking into a bank account to collect information about the account or account holder is wrong. Illegal electronic transfer of funds is a type of fraud. With the use of technology, stealing of information is much easier. Computers can be used to store stolen information. * Commandment 5 *: Simply put: Do not contribute to the spread of misinformation using computer technology. *: Explanation: Spread of information has become viral today, because of the Internet. This also means that false news or rumors can spread speedily through social networking sites or emails. Being involved in the circulation of incorrect information is unethical. Mails and pop-ups are commonly used to spread the wrong information or give false alerts with the only intent of selling products. Mails from untrusted sources advertising certain products or spreading some hard-to- believe information, are not uncommon. Direct or indirect involvement in the circulation of false information is ethically wrong. Giving wrong information can hurt other parties or organizations that are affected by that particular theme. * Commandment 6 *: Simply put: Refrain from copying software or buying pirated copies. Pay for software unless it is free. *: Explanation: Like any other artistic or literary work, software is copyrighted. A piece of code is the original work of the individual who created it. It is copyrighted in his/her name. In case of a developer writing software for the organization she works for, the organization holds the copyright for it. Copyright holds true unless its creators announce it is not. Obtaining illegal copies of copyrighted software is unethical and also encourages others to make copies illegally. * Commandment 7 *: Simply put: Do not use someone else's computer resources unless authorized to. *: Explanation: Multi-user systems have user specific passwords. Breaking into some other user's password, thus intruding his/her private space is unethical. It is not ethical to hack passwords for gaining unauthorized access to a password-protected computer system. Accessing data that you are not authorized to access or gaining access to another user's computer without her permission is not ethical. * Commandment 8 *: Simply put: It is wrong to claim ownership on a work which is the output of someone else's intellect. *: Explanation: Programs developed by a software developer are her property. If he is working with an organization, they are the organization's property. Copying them and propagating them in one's own name is unethical. This applies to any creative work, program or design.

He was beatified by Pope John Paul II for his martyrdom under Communist occupation. Life Basil Hopko was born in the Rusyn village of Hrabské, in the Sáros County of the Kingdom of Hungary (present-day eastern Slovakia). His parents, Basil and Anna née Petrenko, were landless peasants. While Hopko was still an infant, his father was struck by lightning and died. His mother left him in care of her father, while she emigrated to the United States in search of work. When Hopko was 7 he was sent to live with his uncle Demeter Petrenko, a Greek Catholic priest. He attended the Evangelical gymnasium in Prešov, then Czechoslovakia, graduating with honors in 1923. Hopko studied at the Eparchial Seminary in Prešov. He had dreams of joining his mother in America, and of pursuing his priestly vocation there, but the cost of recurring health problems left him unable to afford to travel. He later wrote that when he finally decided to stay and to serve in his homeland, he was suddenly cured, and realized he had been given a sign about his calling. He was ordained a Greek Catholic priest on 3 February 1929. He served as a pastor (1929-1936) at the Greek Catholic parish in Prague, the Czechoslovak capital, where he was known for his focus on the poor, the unemployed, and students. His mother returned from America after 22 years and rejoined her son in Prague, becoming his housekeeper at the parish rectory. In 1936 he returned to teach in Prešov's Eparchial Seminary, and was awarded the title of monsignor. He had already begun graduate studies at Charles University while in Prague, and he completed his Doctor of Theology in 1940 at Comenius University in Bratislava. In Prešov he headed the eparchy's publishing division, where he edited a monthly periodical. After World War II, a growing Soviet Communist influence caused Bishop Pavol Peter Gojdič of Prešov to ask the Holy See for an Auxiliary Bishop to help defend the Greek Catholic Church. Hopko was appointed to the post on 11 May 1947. The Communist take-over of Czechoslovakia wrought havoc on the Greek Catholic Church. In 1950 it was officially abolished by the state as a religious organization, and its assets were turned over to the Russian Orthodox Church. Bishop Gojdič was arrested and was imprisoned for life. Bishop Hopko was arrested on 28 April 1950 and kept on starvation rations and tortured for weeks. Eventually he was tried and sentenced to 15 years for the \\"subversive activity\\" of staying loyal to Rome. He was repeatedly transferred from prison to prison. His health, physical and emotional, failed, and in 1964 he was transferred to a home for the aged. He never recovered his health. During the Prague Spring the Czechoslovak government legally cleared Hopko on 13 June 1968 and the Prešov Eparchy was restored. However, activists insisted that a Slovak bishop be appointed to the see, and the Holy See named the Slovak priest Ján Hirka as Bishop Hopko's successor. Bishop Hopko died in Prešov at age 72 on 23 July 1976. On 14 September 2003 Pope John Paul II beatified him at a ceremony in Bratislava, Slovakia.

Fruit2o was introduced to compete not only with the bottled water market but also with the soft drink market. Sunny Delight Beverages purchased the Veryfine Products line from Kraft in 2007.Kraft Foods to sell Fruit2O and Veryfine to Sunny Delight Beverages  Reuters Ingredients Fruit2O was originally made by Veryfine Products of Littleton, Massachusetts, which used spring water, citric acid, natural flavors, sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate (to preserve freshness) and Splenda (sucralose) as its only sweetener. When Kraft purchased the company, it discontinued making the beverage with spring water, and added the artificial sweetener Ace-K (acesulfame potassium). Recently, Veryfine Products (Late 2008?) was spun off Kraft and Fruit2O returned to only using Sucralose for a sweetener. Acesulfame K is 180–200 times sweeter than sucrose (table sugar), as sweet as aspartame, about half as sweet as saccharin, and one- quarter the sweetness of sucralose. Like saccharin, it has a slightly bitter aftertaste, especially at high concentrations. Kraft Foods has patented the use of sodium ferulate to mask acesulfame's aftertaste. Alternatively, acesulfame K is often blended with aspartame or other sweeteners. These blends are reputed to give a more sugar-like taste where each sweetener masks the other's aftertaste, and to exhibit a synergistic effect wherein the blend is sweeter than its components. The current ingredients vary slightly with each flavor, but generally include purified water, less than 2% of natural flavor, citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, sucralose (Splenda), acesulfame potassium, sodium benzoate, and potassium sorbate.

The Georgia International Horse Park (referred to by locals as The Horse Park) is located in Conyers, Georgia, United States, 30 miles (50 km) east of Atlanta. History Due to the growth of Rockdale County, Georgia, in the late 1980s, the county was looking to expand its wastewater treatment system, but they were having to find alternative uses to strict environmental regulations on the local, state, and federal levels. The City of Conyers, Georgia, found of land on Georgia State Route 138 north of Interstate 20 that would have been suitable for land application. Both the City Manager and the County Council were in the process of finding other uses for this land other than land application when Atlanta was awarded the 1996 Summer Olympics on September 18, 1990. This led to a change in plans from a city park to the development of the land that would later become the Georgia International Horse Park. As a result, an equestrian task force was developed to have the park developed, under cooperation with the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG). The proposed site was visited on August 7, 1991, with details about the land, the proposed facilities, and their post-Olympic usage. The Georgia International Horse Park became reality when it was approved by ACOG on October 21, 1991. Some of the outdoor scenes for the Netflix series Stranger Things were filmed in the park. The Centennial Olympic Games During the 1996 Summer Olympics, which ran from July 19 to August 4, over 600,000 people visited the track to witness events in equestrian, mountain biking, and the riding and running portions of the modern pentathlon events. Among the event competitors who would gain fame ten years later were Kateřina Neumannová and Michael R. Matz. Neumannová competed in the women's mountain biking competition at the 1996 Summer Olympics would later win the gold medal at the 2006 Winter Olympics in the women's 30 km freestyle mass start cross country skiing event. Matz earned a silver in Team show jumping event, and as a trainer, has two wins in Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing events and a Breeder's Cup win. Post–Olympics Legacy After the 1996 Summer Olympics, the area around the Georgia International Horse Park experienced growth surrounding the facility. This growth including several residential developments, the movement of First Baptist Church of Conyers from downtown Conyers in late 2000, and the horse park has become a multi-use facility hosting public events such as horse shows, festivals, fairs, dog shows, trade shows, concerts, obstacle course races and mountain bike events. The venue also offers facilities for private social events, such as weddings, receptions, showers, birthday parties and more. =Concert venue= The venue hosted several concerts over the years, primarily utilizing the main horse park arena and bleacher seating.

The principal activities of the Society are food retailing and funerals. It operates over 200 convenience stores and 50 funeral homes, covering the southern English counties of Berkshire, Bristol, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, Isle of Wight, Somerset, Surrey, Sussex and Wiltshire. Southern Co-op society is owned by over 160,000 members who share in the business's profits and democratically control its operations. It is a registered Industrial and Provident Society, The business of the Southern Co-op includes a natural burial ground in West Sussex and crematoria in Hampshire and Devon, as well as an online home shopping service, Co-operative Mobility. Additionally, the Co-op franchises over 20 stores that trade under the Welcome brand and has a franchise project with Starbucks. In the full year ending 27 January 2020, Southern Co-op recorded sales of £466.8m (£450.9m 2018/19) and a profit before tax of £1.18 million (£42.000 2018/19). Society membership was 145,000 in 2019/20, up from 144,000 in 2018/19. History Southern Co-op was formed in 1873 by dockyard workers who had transferred from Woolwich docks in east London to the Portsmouth dockyard. The workers had previously set up a successful Co- operative Society in Woolwich. When they arrived in Portsmouth they decided to replicate a similar set-up there. In December 1872, 30 people attended a public meeting and unanimously agreed to pay one shilling (12 old pence) for the establishment of a local Co-operative. After five months, the Portsea Island Mutual Co-operative Society's first shop opened in Charles Street on 9 May 1873. The head office was previously located at Fareham in Hampshire until, July 2011, when it moved to 1000 Lakeside, a business park in North Harbour, Portsmouth. Operations Southern co-op operates over 200 Co- operative Food stores, covering Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Sussex, Berkshire, Somerset, Surrey, Devon, Bristol, Kent and parts of Dorset and Wiltshire. Registered in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985, it is a member of Co-operatives UK, the Co-operative Retail Trading Group and a corporate member of The Co-operative Group. Southern Co-op's performance in delivering sales and margin growth last year was strong with total revenue £16m higher, an increase of +3.5%. The growth, along with careful control of margins, delivered £10.6m growth in Gross Profit to £137.1m. Profit Before Tax is £1.2m (19/20) which represents an increase of £1.1m on the total (after exceptional items) reported in the prior year. The balance sheet remains strong with Net Assets of £128m (£126m) of which, £18m is held as cash. Southern Co-op has no net debt at year end and significant banking facilities remain unused and available to support the future growth plans. The closed defined benefit pension scheme has again reported a surplus for accounting purposes this year with an increase in the surplus of £3m. Mark Smith (chief Exec) Said 'Against this challenging background, we achieved another year of total food sales growth and recorded a like for like sales increase of 3.4% which was the second consecutive year of above +3% like for like sales growth. Importantly, we also grew volume growth in 2019 with a rise of 1.4% in the number of products sold. In addition to this growth in our managed food estate we saw further expansion of our franchised Welcome convenience store business with 10 new stores opened in the year. The growth in our own store sales in part reflects the work we have done this year to deliver a better IT system infrastructure for our food business along with simplified and standardised processes for stores. During 2019 we successfully completed the roll out of a major new end to end retail IT system to more than two hundred stores. This assists with managing product range and availability, as well as providing new point of sale tills in all stores. The new technology will enable us to serve customers better going forward. We have also begun to roll out self-service check out technology across our estate. Turning to areas outside of food, during 2019, we successfully consolidated the Starbucks business operated by Cobra Cofee Ltd, that we had purchased at the end of 2018, into a single franchise alongside our original Starbucks stores. To enable us to maximise impact and efficiency, all our Starbucks activities going forward will be delivered through our Cobra Cofee Ltd subsidiary. At year end this had 20 stores trading following the successful recent addition of a new store in Horsham. Through this carefully managed diversification we can get more out of our proven capabilities as a business, spread overheads and risk, and provide additional profit growth to support the things we want to do as a co-op. Progress has been harder to come by in End of Life Services this year. This is primarily a result of lower death rates. Along with the industry as a whole, we have also seen the adverse impact of government led reviews of the national funeral market. We are confident that we remain a high quality operator in the funeral services sector. We welcome the direction towards greater regulation of the industry as a whole. This would extend the higher standards already operated by us and some others to the whole industry to the benefit of consumers. We are also aware that other changes are taking place in the funeral market with new customer demand in areas such as cremations without a ceremony. We are aligning our strategy for our End of Life business to reflect how we think these market changes will play out over the next few years. We have successfully delivered our 2019 property business plan. As part of this, we have sold some of the less strategic assets out of our freehold property portfolio. It is our intention to re-invest these proceeds into better quality real estate opportunities when they are available. At year end we continued to hold these proceeds mainly as cash'. Reducing our foodprint, we are trialling a new waste reduction initiative, called Reducing our Foodprint, which gives customers the opportunity to buy products past their best before date for a nominal value. The trial was first launched in Clanfield in December and was later extended to our Tangier Road, Portsmouth store. Customers are able to purchase selected products beyond their ‘best before’ date as this date relates to quality, not the safety of the product. This has been well received in both communities and if successful we hope to extend the trial. Reducing our Foodprint builds on other work already carried out to reduce the amount of products which are unsold because they have gone past their ‘use by’ date. As part of our sustainability plan, 100% of store waste is already diverted from landfill including foods which are broken down to produce biogas and bio- fertiliser through anaerobic digestion. Food donation A new partnership between The Co-operative Food in Freshwater and The Real Junk Food Project IOW has already made a significant difference to the community. In just six months, more than 600 boxes of bread, pastries, fruit and vegetables have been diverted from waste and transformed into hundreds of meals on the Isle of Wight. Our partnership with Portsmouth Foodcycle which is supported by three retail stores in Portsmouth has also continued. End of Life Services recycling Working with a new waste contractor in 2020, we will be looking at opportunities to improve recycling within our end of life services estate.

History In the early 1960s, young New York City-born poet John Giorno became acquainted with artists who were at the threshold of their successful careers, most notably Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein, Merce Cunningham and John Cage. Warhol would have an important impact on Giorno, as the latter became the protagonist of Warhol's film Sleep (1964), which depicts Giorno sleeping for five hours, and the unreleased Handjob, following Giorno's face while masturbating.BENEDICTUS L, Sleeping on Job provides a Leg-Up, 2004, The Age Giorno believed that, at this level, poetry was running behind. Evidently, these artists in music and painting etc., would act whenever an idea arose in their minds, while the availability and progression of poetry was limited to books and magazines, let alone multimedia or performance. Analogue to then active Pop-Art ideas, Giorno wanted to change poetry's situation by communicating to his audiences through everyday means such as telephone, television, records and so on. After all, phonographs and radio were a perfect terrain for people to listen, as Giorno called it poetry’s venue. Furthermore, these ways would offer Giorno's ideas a wide open space to explore, to reach a broad audience not limited anymore to that of the poetry magazines. From 1965 on, Giorno would explore tape and phonograph recording, along with colleagues William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin, using a variety of tape experiments such as loops and cut techniques Insight into Giorno's recordings for his electronic experiments, e.g. Suicide Sutra and Eating the Sky; downloadable at Giorno's UbuWeb Page Giorno was introduced to Bob Moog, who was working on his Moog synthesizer, on the verge of its fame. The GPS label released albums regularly until the late 1980s. Many of these albums included early recordings by later-prominent performers such as Laurie Anderson and Philip Glass as well as unique performances by Frank Zappa, Diamanda Galás, Allen Ginsberg, John Cage, and Brion Gysin, as well as Giorno and Burroughs. In the 1990s, Giorno Poetry Systems released a box set collecting its recordings of William S. Burroughs. Concept =Dial-a-Poem= After having a conversation on the phone with Burroughs in 1968, Giorno initiated the Dial-a-Poem Poets concept, which he claimed would later influence the creation of information services creation over the telephone, such as sports and stock market. Fifteen phone lines were connected with individual answering machines: people would call GPS and listen to a poem they were offered from fragments of various live recordings. Dial-a-Poem, from 1969 on, was very successful, with 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. peaks. GPS used a variety of social issues at the time, what with the sexual revolution and the Vietnam War, which would create appeal as well as shock from the reactive community.

The average rainfall is 535 mm a year and this is, moreover, erratic and spatial. As a result there is only 1 rain-fed crop a year, whose stand is from late June till December. Groundnuts are grown on these dry lands, inter-cropped with red gram, cowpea, field beans, green gram, jowar, maize and castor on the field bunds. Irrigated groundnut, mulberry, onions and sunflower are the common bore-well irrigated crops. Ragi (golden millet) and a coarse variety of paddy are cultivated under irrigation tanks. Every fifth or sixth year is a drought, followed by near famine conditions.

It was her final album for Capitol Records, her label since 1957 and, prior to that, from 1944 to 1952. Peggy Lee's stage name does not appear on the cover of this album. Its title refers to her given name and her birthplace. Recording history The recording sessions for this album took place in Los Angeles. During the sessions for this album, Lee also recorded the song \\"It Changes,\\" which was written by Robert and Richard Sherman for the 1972 Peanuts film Snoopy Come Home. \\"It Changes\\" was left off the original 1972 LP, but added to a 2004 U.K. compact disc reissue of the album by EMI. After finishing Norma Deloris Egstrom, Lee did not make any studio recordings until two years later, when she recorded \\"Let's Love\\" (written for her by Paul McCartney) for Atlantic Records in April 1974. Reception Capitol Records released \\"Love Song\\" (backed by \\"Someone Who Cares\\") as a 45\\" single in 1972. It was a minor hit, spending four weeks on the Billboard Easy Listening chart and peaking at #34 in October 1972. It was also Lee's last single for Capitol, nearly three decades after she released her first on the label.http://peggylee.com/solos/charts.html The album received a modestly positive review in Stereo Review in October 1973. The reviewer, Peter Reilly, wrote: \\"By the standards Peggy Lee herself has set (no others can take her measure), the new album isn’t particularly outstanding. But, as always, there are three or four stunning bands – 'I’ll Be Seeing You,' 'I’ll Get By' and 'Someone Who Cares' here – that reach the highest level of her accomplishments, and that is high indeed.\\"http://peggylee.com/library/731000.html To the ire of Lee's fans, the 2004 EMI reissue of this album contains a number of alternate takes that are not identified as such on the packaging. This was reportedly done because the album's original master recordings have disappeared.http://www.peggylee.com/pegleebb/read.php?f=3&i;=4026&t;=4026 Track listing #\\"Love Song\\" (Lesley Duncan) - 3:22 #\\"Razor (Love Me as I Am)\\" (Jack Schechtman) - 2:49 #\\"When I Found You\\" (Mike Randall) -3:23 #\\"A Song for You\\" (Leon Russell) - 4:44 #\\"It Takes Too Long to Learn to Live Alone\\" (Leon Carr, Robert Allen) - 3:25 #\\"Superstar\\" (Bonnie Bramlett, Delaney Bramlett, Leon Russell) - 3:57 #\\"Just for a Thrill\\" (Don Raye, Louis Armstrong) - 3:23 #\\"Someone Who Cares\\" (Alex Harvey) - 3:23 #\\"The More I See You\\" (Mack Gordon, Harry Warren) - 1:55 #\\"I'll Be Seeing You\\" (Sammy Fain, Irving Kahal) - 2:15 References External links * Peggy Lee Discography 1972 albums Capitol Records albums Peggy Lee albums Albums produced by Tom Catalano ","title":"Norma Deloris Egstrom from Jamestown, North Dakota"},{"id":"5707391","text":"Eastwick is a neighborhood in the Southwest section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. It is the southwesternmost neighborhood in the city, bordering Philadelphia International Airport and the city line with Delaware County, Pennsylvania at Cobbs Creek and Darby Creek. The Elmwood Park neighborhood borders it to the northeast. History The neighborhood is named for Andrew M. Eastwick. It was largely rural until the 1920s when swampy land was dredged to create room for an airport and other large-scale uses within the city limits. Much of the original housing built before the 1950s lacked sewer service and other urban conveniences. Residents referred to the neighborhood as \\"The Meadows.\\"*McKee, Guian A. \\"Liberal Ends Through Illiberal Means: Race, Urban Renewal and Community in the Eastwick Section of Philadelphia, 1949-1990\\", Journal of Urban History, Vol. 27 No. 5, July 2001, pp. 547–583 Residents enjoyed the ability to have a rural lifestyle within city limits; nearby creeks provided recreation in the form of swimming, bathing, and fishing. An extensive crabbing home industry was based in The Meadows. Homes ranged from traditional single-family residences with lawns and gardens to traditional Philadelphia-style row houses; sometimes, these two housing styles appeared on the same block. Brick was the predominant material used in construction. Homes were built from the early 19th century until the Second World War caused a shortage of material for new construction. The city of Philadelphia, which had been under Republican control in the 1940s, shifted in the 1950s toward reform Democrats, whose policies included community redevelopment. At the same time, city planners began to eye Eastwick as a place to relocate low-income black populations being displaced by development projects in North and West Philadelphia. Yet although planners described Eastwick as \\"open land,\\" it actually constituted an integrated community of some 19,000, the majority of whom owned their homes. Unsurprisingly, the plan faced opposition. But it nevertheless went forward. In 1958, Eastwick was declared the largest urban renewal project in the country, with the Korman Company making plans to replace the allegedly \\"poorly maintained and blighted homes\\" with newer, suburban-style construction in the 1960s and 70s. As Guian A. McKee writes in his study of Eastwick, the new development came at the expense of the existing community. It thus produced a \\"tragic irony,\\" seeing as its realization required \\"the destruction of the area's unique existing community,\\" which was one of the few integrated neighborhoods in Philadelphia at the time. Designing the project was the Greek urban planner Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis, mastermind of Islamabad, Riyadh, and Baghdad's Revolution City. In these cities, he had made a name for himself by integrating city and countryside in a way that he, and state officials, hoped would ease the transition of rural migrants to urban space. Put differently, Doxiadis's designs were seen as anti-communist. In Eastwick, Doxiadis's work took the form of row houses on cul-de-sac streets, with traffic funneled toward peripheral roads. The neighborhood was one of only three in Philadelphia that grew in population between 1970 and 1990. The John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum extends from Eastwick to Tinicum Township, Pennsylvania. Eastwick contains a large industrial area where manufacturing and distributing uses take advantage of proximity to the Airport, Interstate 95, and Center City Philadelphia. There are many gas tank farms, oil refineries, and a sewage treatment plant. The area offers affordable land for industrial uses at reportedly \\"one-third the cost of outlying suburbs,\\" while enabling companies to remain in the city where employees can utilize public transit. The neighborhood has been the site of controversy for a number of issues. Some blocks are located in a flood plain, leading to flooded, abandoned homes and vacant lots that are often used for illegal dumping. Issues of environmental regulation and brownfields cleanup have also figured into the history of Eastwick. The Philadelphia metropolitan area's main post office, formerly housed next to 30th Street Station, moved to a larger, auto-oriented facility in Eastwick in 2006. This move was long criticized by neighborhood groups. Demographics As of the census of 2000, there were 14,424 people living in the neighborhood. The racial makeup was 36.70% White, 57.47% African American, 2.68% Asian, and 0.69% from other races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.91% of the population. The median income for a household in the neighborhood was $33,320. Transportation Eastwick station along SEPTA Regional Rail's Airport Line Eastwick is served by SEPTA Subway-Surface Route 36, which runs through the neighborhood and terminates at 80th Street–Eastwick station. This station is within walking distance of the Eastwick station on SEPTA Regional Rail's Airport Line; it is the only station on the line between the airport stations and Penn Medicine station.

The computer is 100% compatible with the Tandy TRS-80 Model 1, but has some hardware enhancements. Most notable are the high-resolution color graphics, which could also be used for an 80×24 screen, with a special software driver (TRS-80 is 64×16, while 80×24 is the screen size most CP/M software needed). Other enhancements were high processor speed (4 MHz), color support, and optionally, CP/M support. The LNW-80 was also sold as a kit. The LNW supported four screen modes: * Mode 0 is the default TRS-80 screen with 64×16 characters, and 128×48 semi graphics. * Mode 1 is 480×192 monochrome. * Mode 2 uses high-resolution graphics memory to colorize the mode 0 graphics. This results in 128×48 dots with 8 colors per dot. This mode could be used to 'colorize' the standard TRS-80 games when loaded with special software. * Mode 3 uses low res character memory to colorize the high res pixels. This results in 384×192 pixels on 128×48 color fields. Per color field, a foreground and background color is selected from the basic eight colors. The colors are white, green, yellow, red, magenta, blue, blue-green and black.  Company history  LNW started by making third party extensions for the Tandy TRS-80 model 1 market. They started in 1979 or 1980 with a System Extension, a D.I.Y. kit replacement of the Tandy Expansion Interface. The LNW80 appeared at the end of 1980.

Most Upper Sixth students are also required to take General Studies. The International Baccalaureate formally used to offered however, now that is no longer the case. =Enrichment courses= The college offers a range of complementary enrichment course for students to study alongside their chosen qualifications. Many of these courses integrate a Key Skills in Communications qualification, which is necessary for those who achieved a grade C or below in English at GCSE level. If the student's chosen enrichment course does not incorporate Key Skills, then the student must study this subject separately in order to obtain a Key Skills qualification.

It is locatted at a distance of 32 km from Jaipur, on Jaipur-Ajmer Road. Demographics At the 2011 India census, Bagru had a population of 31,229. Males constituted 52% of the population and females 48%. Bagru had an average literacy rate of 71.43%, lower than the national average of 74.04%, but higher than the state average of 66.11%; with 66% of the males and 34% of females literate. 18% of the population were under 8 years of age. Economy Bagru is known for natural dyes and hand block printing. Bagru is the place of Raiger and Chhipa community. Chhipas are involved in fabric printing tradition for over 100 years.The Raigers are involved in processing and manufacturing of leather and their products (like boots, mochdi, Rajasthani Jutee and other leather goods). The Raigers export raw leather (semi processed) to big leather companies and also sell in local market (Hatwara,Jaipur). Bagru is also known for natural dyeing, indigo dyeing and wooden hand block printing over textile articles. The famous Jugal Darbar temple is located in Bagru. Here, an annual \\"Mela\\" (fair) is organized by the Bagda community which is attended by hundreds of people from neighbouring villages. This is place of peace and unites all communities. Bagru also has a fort (private property) in heart of town which is normally open for public on Gangaur Festival. Bagru is most famous for its typical wooden hand block prints. These prints of Bagru are acclaimed all over India, and are particularly known as \\"Bagru prints\\". The Prints of Bagru, unlike other prints, involve a different kind of printing. The unique method for printing employs wooden block in it. In the process, the desired design is engraved on the wooden block first and then the carved block is used for replicating the design in the preferred color on the fabric. Chippa Mohalla (Printer's quarter) is the area for those, who are interested in textile printing. One can walk into the quarter, where people are always engrossed with dyes and blocks. The three-centuries-old tradition of block printing is kept alive with the efforts of Bagru artisans. Keeping the convention, these artisans smear the cloth with Fuller's earth got from the riverside and then dip it in turmeric water to get the habitual cream color background. After that, they stamp the cloth with designs using natural dyes of earthly shades. Even today, artisans use traditional vegetable dyes for printing the cloth. Like, the color blue is made from indigo, greens out of indigo mixed with pomegranate, red from madder root and yellow from turmeric. Usually Bagru prints have ethnic floral patterns in natural colors. Bagru prints form the essential part of the block printing industry of Rajasthan. The village fabricates some of the bed covers and other materials. Nowadays this printing business is under crisis due to water crises and improper care by State Government where incentives based schemes are not available. It required a channel market to spread the popularity of handmade bedsheets under cluster program. There is no specific industrial zone to process the printing and export. All is depending on Sanganer based big traders and speculators.

The fallout from these scandals resulted in several star players receiving long suspensions, salary cuts, or being banned from professional play entirely.McKenna, Brian. Early Exits: The Premature Endings of Baseball Careers (Scarecrow Press, 2007), p. 17. The scandals led many fans in Japan to abandon the sport, and also to the sale of such illustrious teams as the Nishitetsu Lions and Toei Flyers (now the Seibu Lions and Hokkaidō Nippon Ham Fighters). The term \\"black mist\\" was a reference to a political scandal that had enveloped the administration of Prime Minister Eisaku Satō just a few years earlier; \\"bribery was said to envelop politics like a black mist.\\"Johnston, Michael. \\"Influence Markets\\", Syndromes of Corruption: Wealth, Power, and Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 79.  History  The Black Mist Scandal had multiple components, involving the yakuza and members of both Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) and professional auto racing teams. Baseball players and executives were implicated in fixing competitions in both sports. The bulk of the revelations around the scandal came out between the fall of 1969 and the spring of 1970. Eventually, more than fifteen NPB players and coaches were implicated in game- fixing and sports betting, while five auto racers were found to be involved in a race-fixing scheme. Members of nine NPB teams were implicated, with seven players coming from the Nishitetsu Lions alone. Ten NPB current and former players — including star pitchers Masaaki Ikenaga, Kentarō Ogawa, and Tsutomu Tanaka — were banned from the game for life. = Game-fixing = On October 7, 1969, the Lions front office discovered pitcher Masayuki Nagayasu taking bribes from a yakuza clan to throw games. The team announced that Nagayasu would be released after the end of the season, and the story was reported in Japanese newspapers the next day. Late in November, the executive committee presiding over the NPB at the time voted to ban Nagayasu from the league for life, the first time any player had been banned from Japanese baseball. On April 1, 1970, in an exclusive tape-recorded interview with the Shūkan Post newspaper, also broadcast on Fuji Television, Nagayasu revealed that other players on his former team were also involved in game-fixing. The NPB summoned seven players to testify about their involvement: Nagayasu, team ace Masaaki Ikenaga, pitchers Yoshinobu Yoda and Akio Masuda, catcher Kimiyasu Murakami, and infielders Kazuhide Funada and Mitsuo Motoi. Yoda and Masuda admitted their involvement. Ikenaga claimed to be uninvolved, but had not returned the ¥1 million he had received from Chunichi Dragons pitcher and former teammate Tsutomu Tanaka as an invitation to cheat. One month later, Toei Flyers pitchers Toshiaki Moriyasu and Mitsugu Tanaka were revealed to be under suspicion of throwing baseball games. A subsequent report revealed that Kintetsu Buffaloes front-office official Akira Yano had been coerced into throwing games as a player during the 1967 season. On May 25, 1970, the executive committee issued the following punishments to the accused Nishitetsu players: * Masayuki Ikenaga, Yoshinobu Yoda, Akio Masuda: Banned for lifeAssociated Press. \\"3 Suspended for Baseball for Life,\\" The Day (May 28, 1970). * Kimiyasu Murakami and Kazuhide Funada: Suspended until the end of the 1970 season * Mitsuo Motoi: Given a \\"severe warning\\" In June the committee banned the Buffaloes' Akira Yano from baseball for life. In July, Buffaloes outfielder Masahiro Doi was prosecuted for illegal gambling. He was later suspended by the NPB for a month. On July 30, 1970, the committee issued the following punishments for the Toei players: * Toshiaki Moriyasu: Banned from baseball for life * Mitsugu Tanaka: Received a warning On November 30, Hanshin Tigers pitcher Yutaka Enatsu received a stern warning from the Central League president due to \\"involvement with persons in baseball gambling.\\" On January 11, 1971, Nankai Hawks pitcher Kiyohiro Miura received a stern warning for receiving an invitation to throw games from teammate Kimihiro Satō and not reporting it. On January 29 of that year, Taiyō coach Takashi Suzuki and pitcher Shōji Sakai were barred from playing in the NPB for their involvement with the yakuza. Finally, on February 15, 1971, Lotte Orions pitcher Fumio Narita was suspended for a month for his involvement with bookmakers. = Race-fixing = On April 22, 1970, an auto racer under investigation for rule violations in a race revealed that baseball players were involved in a scheme to fix the results of races. Three men were arrested under suspicion of participating in the scheme: Chunichi Dragons pitcher Tsutomu Tanaka, Taiyō Whales pitcher Isao Takayama, and yakuza member Hirotaka Fujinawa. A few weeks later, Kentarō Ogawa, star pitcher for the Dragons, was arrested for taking part in the auto-race fixing. Later on in May, Hanshin Tigers infielder Takao Katsuragi was arrested in the auto-race scandal. In June, the NPB committee banned Ogawa from baseball for life; they suspended Katsuragi for three months. On September 8, 1970, Yakult Swallows infielder Takeshi Kuwata (who had been the 1959 rookie of the year) was arrested for his role in the auto- racing scandal. He would later receive a three-month suspension from the NPB, but his involvement effectively barred him from signing with another team, and he retired at the end of the year. =Ikenaga's reinstatement= Ikenaga's banning was fiercely contested by both Nishitetsu's front office and Ikenaga's family. His case was not taken up by the NPB until March 2005, when commissioner Yasuchika Negoro and team owners agreed on a bylaw that allowed banned players who have reformed themselves to petition for a removal of the ban.\\"Japan welcoming back players who fixed games\\", Yomiuri Shimbun (March 23, 2005).

(1883) Description The 1.5-m-long beast was related to palaeotheres, and suspected to be the ancestor of modern tapirs and rhinoceroses. Physically, it would have looked very similar to modern tapirs, although it probably lacked the tapir's characteristic proboscis. Its teeth, however, resembled those of a rhinoceros, supporting the idea of its relationship with that group.

It was established in 1993, with American orchestral conductor Michael Palmer as its artistic director. The festival's programming features orchestral and chamber music concerts among its events, which over the years have been held at a handful of local venues including Western Washington University, the Mount Baker Theatre, McIntyre Hall in Mount Vernon, and the White Salmon Lodge on the slopes of nearby Mount Baker. The resident 40-member Bellingham Festival Orchestra is composed of musicians from major European and North American orchestras. There is also a Bellingham Festival Chorus which performs with the orchestra on occasion, composed of singers from surrounding Whatcom, Snohomish and Skagit counties who are selected by audition each year. In an article dated January 13, 2007 the Bellingham Herald reported that there would not be a festival in 2007 due to cash shortfalls, according to Festival officials. However, 9 months later, in an article published on October 17, 2007 the Herald reported that the Bellingham Festival of Music had successfully reorganized its fiscal affairs and that its concerts would take place again in July 2008, with its board of directors promising a leaner fiscal approach that would be less administratively top-heavy but would maintain high artistic quality, and that Michael Palmer, one of the Festival's founders, would continue in his role as artistic director. The 2008 and 2009 Festivals were successful artistically and financially. The 2010 and 2011 Festivals proved equally successful, according to Festival Treasurer Mary Pat Thuma. The 2021 Bellingham Festival of Music is scheduled to take place in July, according to the Festival's website. A virtual festival was held in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
