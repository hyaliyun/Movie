It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 18, 2012, and was seen by around 5.06 million people during this broadcast. Plot Homer is shocked to discover that his neighbor and bowling teammate Dan Gillick is an accountant for Fat Tony II and his mob. When the government finally catches up with Fat Tony and he is forced to serve jury duty, Tony names Dan as his temporary replacement. Dan gradually becomes power-hungry from the position, and is frightened by his own change. When Fat Tony orders him to carry out a murder, he begs Homer to do anything to stop him, so Homer ties Dan to a chair in the basement, but Dan escapes and starts hunting down Fat Tony's associates, only to be inadvertently thwarted by Homer before he can kill any of them. Once the trial ends and Fat Tony is released from jury duty, he regains control of the mob. As Homer and Dan struggle over Dan's gun, it shoots a bullet into the Kwik-E-Mart, wounding Snake Jailbird, who had just been acquitted in same the trial in which Fat Tony served, as he tries to rob it. Dan opens an ear-piercing stand in the Springfield Mall, commenting that he loves the job because he gets to use an ear-piercing gun. Meanwhile, Lisa passes out during a saxophone solo at a school concert. She is diagnosed with iron deficiency and decides to add insects to her vegetarian diet in order to combat it. Although she enjoys the addition to her diet at first, the bugs start to taunt her in her dreams, prompting her to quit eating insects. She decides to release the grasshoppers she has been raising into the wild, but Bart accidentally breaks the aquarium holding them and they escape into the basement instead. They later swarm over Dan, tied up in the basement, and it is revealed that his screams prompted Homer to cut him loose, allowing him to flee and presumably start hunting down Fat Tony's associates. The grasshoppers are later rounded up and released alongside a country road, where they immediately eat a nearby corn maze down to the ground. Reception Ratings The Simpsons came second in the night in both the 18-49 demographic and total viewers. It received a 2.4 down from 3.2 last week. Critical reception Robert David Sullivan from The A.V. Club gave this episode a C, saying that \\"there's not much to laugh at in yet another flat episode\\". He especially criticized the inclusion of Carell's character, commenting, \\"Carell and his character, who has oddly normal body proportions for a Springfield resident, are not a great fit with the show.

Apparently, Coleman's Missouri Cavalry Regiment operated for some time without formal recognition, until the summer of 1864, and it was granted in July 1864 official status as a Partisan Ranger Regiment (Independent Cavalry Command) under the Partisan Ranger Act of 1862. It was only an officially independent command for a few months, before the reorganization of commands for Price's Raid in Missouri which occurred between August and October 1864.

O. Shelby occupied Northeast Arkansas, well behind Union army lines. In early June 1864, General Shelby commissioned Colonel Thomas Hamilton McCray, among others to begin raising regiments in Northeast Arkansas. By June 13, Shelby reported to General Sterling Price that McCray's efforts were bearing fruit. Colonel McCray's efforts led to the recruitment of at least three regiments, the 45th, 46th and 47th Arkansas Infantry Regiments. These 40-series regiments consisted mostly of conscripts, and absentees from existing units, organized around a small cadre of detailed from infantry regiments, which were expected to be idle during the fall and winter of 1864.Howerton, Bryan R.: \\"Re: Wm.

However, when General Sterling Price received authorization to conduct a campaign in Missouri that fall, several of the new regiments were mounted in order to accompany him. As a result, the 44th, 45th, 46th, 47th, and 48th were officially mounted infantry regiments instead of cavalry regiments. They were rarely referred to in contemporary reports and orders by numerical designation.

The confusion over which division the 46th Arkansas was assigned to and whether it was under the command of Colonel Coleman or Lieutenant Colonel Crabtree during Price's raid may be clarified by an article that Colonel Coleman wrote for the Confederate Veteran Magazine in May 1909. Coleman indicates that following Shelby's raid on Ashley's Station, he was sent north in to Missouri, ahead of Price's army, to organize new units. This he apparently did, joining Price's force in Missouri. Since Fagan's Division was intended to include all Arkansas Troops, while Marmaduke's Division was mainly Missouri troops, this would have left the 46th assigned to Fagan's Division, and probably McCray's Brigade, as described by Brigadier General Ewing and Lieutenant Jackson. Confederates often referred to regiments by the name of their commander, and Colonel Coleman's regiment is mentioned on several occasions in various reports from Price's Raid.The War Of The Rebellion: A Compilation Of The Official Records Of The Union And Confederate Armies, Series I, Vol. XLI, Part I, Reports, Washington: Government Printing Office, 1893, Pages. 28, 192, 432, 627, 642, 675, 677, 800, 801., Accessed 6 January 2011, https://books.google.com/books?id=RdYUAAAAYAAJ&pg;=PA915&dq;=Official+Records+Major+Harris+Greeno,+4th+Arkansas+Cavalry#v=snippet&q;=Coleman&f;=false The 46th was involved in the following actions during Price's Raid:Sikakis, Stewart, Compendium of the Confederate Armies, Florida and Arkansas, Facts on File, Inc., 1992, , page 120.

The execution  A member of Company A, 46th Arkansas Mounted Infantry, Private Harvey H.

Private Blackburn and the other men executed were not connected in any way with the incident, but were selected at random from among prisoners of war being held by the United States at Gratiot Street Military Prison, St. Louis, Missouri.Howerton, Bryan R. \\"In Response To: 46th Arkansas(Mounted)\\", Arkansas in the Civil War Message Board, Posted 30 October 2002, Accessed 10 January 2012, http://history- sites.com/mb/cw/arcwmb/archive_index.cgi?noframes;read=2309 Another soldier from the 46th Arkansas Mounted Infantry, John N.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 11, 2012, and in the United Kingdom on Sky 1 on April 7, 2013. The episode received mixed reviews. Plot Homer receives a large sum of money when Squeaky Voiced Teen spills hot onion rings on him. Homer uses the money as a college fund for Lisa and plans to put it in a bank, but Lenny and Carl warn him that banks are not as safe as they used to be. Following this warning, he instead puts the fund on an online poker site, which horrifies Lisa. Eventually, however, Lisa finds enjoyment in gambling her college fund to other citizens in Springfield, increasing the amount of money with every win. The gambling soon takes its toll on Lisa. During one game, she relentlessly decides to bet all of her money, but is mortified when one of the other players, revealed to be Sideshow Bob, wins the game instead, therefore winning her entire college fund. Saddened, Lisa quits gambling. Bart then approaches her, admits that he was using Sideshow Bob's image whenever he gambles online. Unfortunately, the poker site found out Bart and Lisa were underage and they are now back with the original $5,000. When asked why he did it, Bart admits that he actually loves Lisa and felt sorry for her, then demands her to not tell anyone about this exchange. Meanwhile, Homer and Marge arrive at Springfield Retirement Castle to visit Grampa. There, the staff inform them that Grampa had been missing for a while. Searching his room for clues, they find a photo of Spiro's, a restaurant where Grampa was revealed to work at. Homer is puzzled by this as he does not remember Grampa having a job there. The two go to Spiro's and talk to the manager, who points them to the direction of Rita LaFleur, a singer who worked alongside Grampa. Homer and Marge go to Rita, who tells them that she was married to Grampa and that Homer even knew this during his childhood. The relationship ended, however, when Homer was badly injured in a car accident and Grampa stayed behind to take care of him instead of accompanying Rita to Europe for a music tour the two had been planning together. Shocked by the revelation, Homer feels a new respect for his father because of the sacrifices he made for the sake of him. He and Marge then go to a winery where Grampa frequented and find him working there. Grampa refuses to go back to the retirement home, but changes his mind when Homer promises that the family will visit him more frequently. Unexpectedly, Rita pays Grampa a visit by playing his old song on the piano and he joins her. Reception Ratings The Simpsons earned a 3.2 in the 18-49 demographic up from 2.6 the previous week.

Critical reception Robert David Sullivan of The A.V.

Arriving at the voting booths, Homer is initially unable to decide whether he should vote for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, as both have their flaws. Eventually, Homer votes for Romney, but is shocked to find that he got a medical deduction for a personality implant, he has six wives all named Ann, and the government paid him taxes for five years. Before Homer can rush out of the booth to tell the press, he is sucked into a tube and gets outsourced to a factory somewhere in China, where US flags are being made. Homer is initially satisfied with the outcome because he has got a steady job until Selma comes out of the tube.  Main plot  Homer's neglect to fix a dripping faucet causes the water to seep underground and create a massive cavern underneath the town square. The ground eventually caves in, just as Marge drives her car into the hole. She and the kids manage to get out, but Marge is unable to recover her car as the hole is soon filled up with useless items and covered with an asphalt layer, burying the car. With the car gone, Marge purchases a new one, a Tissan Sensible, but she dislikes it. At first she is reluctant to reveal her reasons, but eventually tells Homer that the five seater car destroys her chances at having another baby, which she secretly wants. Homer appears to support her desire, but he is secretly horrified, feeling that three kids are enough for him to handle. Homer and Marge later find that their chances at having a baby are still nonexistent, as Homer's sperm are dead. However, Moe reveals that Homer sold some of his sperm to the Shelbyville Fertility Clinic a few years back. Homer and Marge head for the clinic, and Homer tries to divert Marge's attention by taking a historic route and stopping by several places. This plan fails, prompting him to admit his true feelings about another baby to Marge, and that he actually never wanted to be a father. This angers her and the two drive home. During a stop at a restaurant, however, Homer observes a family of six and finds that the father is enjoying himself with the fourth, youngest child. Changing his mind, he and Marge return to their original plan and arrive at the clinic. There, Marge is horrified to learn that Homer sold a lot of sperm to the clinic, resulting in a huge number of Homer-like babies. This forces her to tell Homer that they should probably wait, and Homer agrees. He takes the family to a drive-in movie and spots a set of newborn septuplets who resemble him, and he and they yell \\"D'oh!\\" at the same time. Subplot Bart and Milhouse find a message dropped by Lisa that reads in cursive, \\"The five boxing wizards jump quickly.\\" They also see Lisa sneak off into a taxicab. Intrigued, the two recruit Nelson and Ralph, both previous boyfriends of Lisa's, in hopes of profiling her mind to find the meaning of the message. While following Lisa, Nelson and Ralph find another message, also in cursive, saying, \\"Sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow.\\" The group's efforts in finding out what the messages mean go nowhere, and by this time, Principal Skinner, who is concerned from Lisa's strange disappearances, has joined them. Skinner deduces that the paper used for both messages only belongs to the previous principal of Springfield Elementary School, Meredith Milgram. The five visit her house and find Lisa there. To the kids' dismay, it turns out that she was learning cursive writing, a topic that the school cannot afford to teach. The two messages were mere practice sentences, as both consisted of every letter of the alphabet. The episode ends with the credits all written in cursive handwriting.

Despite much destruction in Tibet itself, many of these survive, the dry climate of the Tibetan plateau assisting their survival, as the wet Indian climate has reduced survival of paintings from there.

Depending on the final visible colour of a painting, specific colours for the underpainting were employed. An ochre for example has an underpainting in a bright yellow. Similar to Tibetan paintings, the traditional painting was carried out with shading systems, such as a dry or wet shading system.

It stands in St James Square, opposite the Catalpa tree. The building was listed at Grade II on 27 June 1952.Old Dispensary, Listed Buildings, accessed January 2010 The architectural historian John NewmanNewman, John (2000) The Buildings of Wales: Gwent/Monmouthshire. . University of Wales Press calls this the \\"one substantial eighteenth century house\\" in St James Street, though it is surrounded by later attractive fa√ßades. A dispensary was established here in 1857. This became the Monmouth Hospital and Dispensary, with nine beds, in 1868, and closed in 1903. The dispensary is one of 24 buildings on the Monmouth Heritage Trail, marked by a ceramic blue plaque on the wall. History A dispensary had been set up at Little Castle House, Castle Hill, in 1810, but it moved to St James Square in 1868 where it became the town's hospital, funded by local benefactors. Sir James Paget (Surgeon Extraordinary to Queen Victoria), who inspected the premises in 1873, said it was one of \\"the most convenient and best ventilated and arranged Institutions he had ever seen\\". It mainly benefitted the poor although it was the deserving poor as those on parish-relief were given a low priority. The Dispensary served as a cottage hospital, except that cases involving childbirth, hospice cases and those with mental diseases were turned away. The annual cost of each bed in 1868 was about ¬£40; this was raised by donations made at Monmouth's banks or directly at the Dispensary. The waiting room displayed the names of major benefactors, which included a gift of ¬£1,000 from John E. W. Rolls (a grandfather of Charles Rolls), who was President of the Institution. Rolls covered the cost of \\"The Hendre Bed\\" in perpetuity. The number of outpatients treated in 1876‚Äì1877 was over 1600; there were 60 inpatients. The Dispensary's catchment area extended to about eight miles outside Monmouth, including part of the Forest of Dean.Kissack, K. (1975) Monmouth ‚Äì the Making of a County Town. Phillimore Press The lack of an operating room and the difficult stairs at the Dispensary had convinced the authorities that a new hospital was essential and this led to the Dispensary's closure. The Hospital moved from St James Square in 1903 to the Cottage Hospital on the Hereford Road.Alan Sutton Publishing, Monmouth and the River Wye in Old Photographs, Alan Sutton Publishing, 1989, , page 16 In 1907, the French Sisters were running a private school in the old dispensary building, offering both boarders and day pupils lessons in French, music, painting, drawing, needlework and general education. Soon afterwards, a children's home was established here, a use which continued up to the end of the twentieth century.

Body-shape and wing-venation are generally similar to that of Oxycera except that R4+5 is usually forked, and R 2+a is faint.The basal segment of gonopods in male on the lower side is fused with the hypandrium which has two more or less elongated median outgrowths;basal segment with lateral outgrowth at apex on outer side. Nemotelus species are not lively, and are easily caught with the fingers.They occur in the neighbourhood of water, in fens and similar localities, where they often are seen on the flowers of Umbelliferae and Compositae, sometimes in large numbers. Some of them seem to prefer salt marshes.

The subsidy is paid in the form of a fee per booking of a movie, intended to match the savings that occurs by not shipping a film print. The model is designed to help redistribute the savings realized by studios when using digital distribution instead of film print distribution. History The first public demonstration of digital projection for cinema took place at ShoWest in 1999,Digital cinema#Technology demonstrations and system prototyping and it was readily apparent that the technology was further ahead than the business model. Early technology presentations attempted to claim that the technology would pay for itself through new revenues generated by new forms of content. But exhibitors knew their audience, and could see that digital projection was only a replacement technology, creating new financial liabilities, and not new revenue. It wasn‚Äôt until the rollout of digital 3-D years later in 2005 that digital projection demonstrated that it could be used to generate additional revenue. The economics were challenging. Film projectors and platters cost in the neighborhood of US$30,000, while early digital projectors cost up to US$150,000. Further, film projectors had a lifetime of 30 years with relatively small annual expenditures in maintenance and replacement parts. On the other hand, exhibitors felt they would be lucky to get 10 years of service from a digital projector, after which there would have to be a refresh in capital expenditure. Meanwhile, distributors would realize significant savings by eliminating the high cost of film prints with corresponding shipping costs, and instead distributing digital files either by satellite or hard drive. The Virtual Print Fee was designed to better balance savings and expenditures for both exhibitors and distributors. It is intended to primarily assist in the replacement of film projectors, and not assist in the purchase of new projection equipment for new construction. To give confidence to financial institutions that digital cinema technology was stable and worthy of investment, Digital Cinema Initiatives was created in 2002, resulting in the release of the first version of the DCI Digital Cinema System Specification in 2005. The DCI Specification continues to be the core specification for digital cinema, establishing the baseline technology and system requirements for which studios will release digital movies. The first set of VPF agreements executed with four major studios were announced by Christie/AIX in November 2005. Christie/AIX at that time was a subsidiary of Access Integrated Technology, now renamed Cinedigm Digital Cinema Corp. The agreements were for the rollout of digital cinema technology to 4000 screens. Since that time, numerous other Digital Cinema Deployment Agreements have been executed around the world, allowing exhibitors in nearly every territory to benefit from VPF subsidies in the conversion from film projection to digital projection.

It used to be a part of a 19th-century pharmacy factory run by famous pharmacist and alchemist Wilhelm Poehl (sometimes written William Pell). The tower is around 11 m high and 2 m wide and has no windows or doors. Almost every brick of the tower is numbered. The mysterious code and unusual location at the pharmacy yard caused numerous legends about the tower. Legends The most common legend about the tower is connected with its original owner Wilhelm Poehl, who was believed as not only a royal pharmacist but also an alchemist. In his free time he used the tower to incubate magic griffins. According to the legend the griffins were invisible and could be only seen reflected in windows at midnight. The numbers on bricks constitute a magic code and those who could decrypt the code could solve the Universal mysteries. History The tower likely was connected to the 19th century pharmacy and was a chimney for its laboratory. On the 1st of May 1994 the artist Alexey Kostroma and his project \\"Tut-i-Tam\\" installed a huge egg on the top of the tower and numbered the walls. The installation was called \\"the egg monument\\" and it was related to match of two holidays: Easter and International Workers' Day. The monument expressed the unity of workers, artists and religious people. The egg was stolen several times and installed again until it disappeared forever. The code at the same time represented the process of overall inventory which took place in the 1990s in Russia. The artist wanted to protect the tower giving it an official number.

Palmer on the Solartaxi Life Louis Palmer was raised in Luzern, Switzerland. Since he was a little child, his dream was to show the benefit of renewable energy sources and solar cars to the world. After finishing school, he became a schoolteacher. After several trips to foreign countries, he discovered his vision and took his first steps into Solar Energy. In 2007 and 2008, he was the first to circumnavigate the globe on solar power. Motivational speaker Louis Palmer is a motivational speaker at conferences worldwide. He speaks about his vision of solar energy and about his dream of a better world with renewable energy. His experience as a teacher is part of his special way of communicating to people. As a conference speaker, he has had the opportunity to speak to audiences of researchers, politicians, and students. This part of educating the audience and inspiring people to change their consumption behaviour into a reflected awareness of the environment is of great importance to him. In 2009, Palmer was awarded the European Solar Prize, and in 2011, he was awarded Champion of the Earth for his achievements. Solartaxi In 2004, with the help of sponsors and technical support, Palmer began building a solar-powered car called the Solartaxi. For the technical expertise, he worked together with the Hochschule f√ºr Technik und Architektur Luzern and three other Swiss universities. He drove around the world in his Solartaxi between 2007 and 2008, logging over 54,000 kilometers through over 40 counties. In 2008, the tour ended in Luzern after 18 months, making it the first tour around the world in a solar-powered car. During the tour his companion Erik Schmitt made a documentary film about the tour. In 2009 he was awarded the European Solar Prize for his Solartaxi. Zero Race After his Solartaxi tour, Palmer drew from his previous experience when he became the initiator and tour director of an organized race. The Zero Emissions Race took place between August 2010 and February 2011. The aim was to make it around the world in 80 days and to show what emission-free vehicles can accomplish. Palmer invited four teams to enter the competition, setting vehicle criteria that were quite concrete: They had to be propelled by an electric motor, they had to be able to drive a certain distance in a certain time, and they had to be able to carry at least two passengers. Through Zero Emissions Race, Palmer was once again able to draw attention to his vision of sustainable living. WAVE World Advanced Vehicle Expedition Pamer's third tour began on 10 September 2011 in Paris and finished on 25 September 2011 in Prague. 25 electric vehicles from eight countries joined his first WAVE across 3,000 km and eight countries. The tour stopped in around 30 cities to demonstrate to the public that electric vehicles are reliable, fun, and powerful. All vehicles had to produce their own electricity from a renewable source such as wind or solar and feed it into the grid. In December, the second WAVE took place in India. Five electric cars joined this tour from Mumbai to Bangalore and back. In 2014, 75 vehicles have already joined the tour, and Palmer set the world record for the largest electric vehicle parade with 481 vehicles, which joined the WAVE at its start in Stuttgart on May 31, 2014. Switchbus / Switzerland Explorer Together with his wife, Dr. Julianna Priskin, Palmer co-founded the Switzerland Explorer\\" with the world's first 100% electric tour bus. The aim of Switzerland Explorer is to take groups or individual tourists on sustainable tours around Switzerland. The bus was originally in service for the German army, and then it was converted to electric drive by Design-werk. It can transport up to 16 passengers and has a range of up to 300 km.

It was founded in 1966 and functioned for thirty years before being absorbed into the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) in 1996.UCAS Memorandum to Parliamentary Select Committee on Education and Employment, 26 July 1999 ADAR was based in the city of Hereford. Following the introduction of Art Foundation courses from 1963 onwards, interest among potential students increased in the range of higher education courses available nationally. Like the Central Register and Clearing House the ADAR scheme operated on a sequential rather than simultaneous basis, so that once a particular applicant had been accepted by their first choice their form did not circulate to further institutions. In 1996, the scheme had 15,200 applications which led to 9,082 acceptances, compared to 6,900 acceptances in 1991.Patel, Kam, \\"Designed for Modern Life\\", Times Higher Education Supplement, 19 September 1997 Most major branches of British higher education merged their admissions systems in the new UCAS scheme in 1992, but Art and Design admissions presented particular problems since they worked to a later timetable as a result of the important role Art Foundation courses had in developing as fully as possible a student's proposed specialism (painting, sculpture, graphic design and so on).

The gardens of the Quinta de Bolivar. The Quinta de Bolivar is a colonial house in Bogota, Colombia, that served as a residence to Simon Bolivar in the capital after the war of independence. It is now used as a museum dedicated to Bolivar's life and times. History The history of the house goes back to the late 17th century when the land was sold by the chaplain of Monserrate to Jose Antonio Portocarre√±o, a Spanish merchant, who built a country house there. After his death his heirs could not maintain the property and it had seriously deteriorated by the time the newly independent government bought it and gave it to Bolivar as a sign of gratitude for his role in the war of independence. The house was restored for his use and between 1820 and 1830 Bolivar stayed there for a short time whenever he visited Bogota. After Bolivar had to abandon the capital, he gave the house to his friend Jose Ignacio Paris. Later the house changed hands several times and throughout the 19th century it was used for the most diverse purposes: it was a health house, a brewery, a tannery and a girls school. Finally in 1919, when the property was again up for sale, the Colombian Historic Society and the Embellishment Society of Bogota began a national fund-raising campaign in order to buy it. After it had been purchased as a national monument, it became a museum with artifacts from the independence times including objects belonging to Simon Bolivar. It is also used as a venue for diplomatic and cultural events. Several important restoration projects have taken place in both the house and gardens and some infrastructure work has been undertaken to adapt the property to its current function. On January 17, 1974, in a symbolic act, √Ålvaro Fayad, a co-founder of the guerrilla movement M-19 stole Bolivar's sword leaving behind a note that began, \\"Bolivar, your sword returns to the battlefield.\\" On January 31, 1991, Antonio Navarro, a leader of the M-19, returned the sword as part of the group's peace negotiations with the government.

History The railway was built by the Great Western Railway and was authorised for construction by the Great Western Railway (Additional Powers) Act 1905, as a means to reduce goods traffic on the main line, and to reduce cartage by providing a goods facility on the opposite side of the town centre to the main railway station. The depot was built by Henry Lovatt of Wolverhampton and was partly on the site of a Masonic Temple. The line and depot opened in 1908. The line never had a regular passenger service, although occasional railway enthusiast's specials reached the line. After a reduction in demand, the line and depot closed in July 1983. Since the line's closure, part of the route of the line at the goods depot end has been reused by the A33 road, whilst the rest has become a de facto walking route although not an official public right of way. Route The walking route that now occupies much of the trackbed. After diverging south-eastwards from the Reading to Basingstoke Line at Coley Branch Junction, which was adjacent to Southcote Junction, the track was crossed by a brick and iron footbridge that formed a pedestrian link between the Reading suburbs of Coley Park and Southcote. Since the line has been closed, the bridge has been demolished and replaced by a ramp and footpath across the trackbed of the branch, which also gives access to the walking route along the trackbed. The line then entered a cutting. Emerging from the cutting, the line traversed an embankment which raised it from the surrounding Kennet flood plains. A skew arch bridge took the line over the Holy Brook, after which a semaphore signal from the junction was situated. A number of ditches and channels were culverted under the embankment, which reduced in height as the line entered Reading. The bridge which once carried Berkeley Avenue over the throat of the goods yard. At about from the junction, the line reached its first lineside industry, a jam factory belonging to the Co-operative Society that was served by sidings. At the same point today, the walking route along the trackbed finishes, and the trackbed disappears under the busy dual carriageway road that is the A33 road. After serving a sawmill, the line passed under Berkeley Avenue on a typical iron railway bridge. This bridge still exists, but today carries Berkeley Avenue over the A33. Just before the bridge, the line started to spread out into a number of sidings, which after the bridge became Reading Central Goods depot Reading Central Goods (north to left of map) The site of the goods yard today. Located between the River Kennet and the Holy Brook, the depot yard had 12 sidings‚Äîlocated in six pairs‚Äîwith accommodation for approximately 300 wagons carrying goods such as coal, timber, brick, stone, hay, straw and fertiliser. The yard served local businesses such as the Anglo-American Oil, Gascoignes (manufacturers of dairy machinery and inventors of the Kee Klamp), Baynes's timber yard and several coal merchants. The yard closed with the rest of the line in 1983, and most of the space it occupied is now occupied by the A33 road and its junction with the town's Inner Distribution Road, together with an apartment block. Originally one siding continued north-east to Simonds Brewery crossing Fobney Street on the level. At Bear Wharf, adjacent to County Lock on the Kennet, another siding was built to allow trans-shipment of goods between rail and barge, with locomotives sometimes being used to tow vessels short distances against the current. With the decline of the river's use for goods transport the wharf closed in 1969, whilst the brewery siding was severed by the building of the Inner Distribution Road, opened the same year. Today the brewery and wharf sites are occupied by housing.

He was the Regent of the Empire of Brazil from October 1835 to September 1837. Beside members of the Imperial family, he was the first to ever hold this position alone; the other was his appointed successor after his resignation, the Marquis of Olinda. Both were regents at the time Emperor Dom Pedro II was still a minor. Biography He received his early education in a clerical college of S√£o Paulo. In 1807 he was ordained priest, and soon afterward began to teach in Parahyba. In 1820 the constitutional revolution triumphed in Portugal, and Feij√≥ was sent as a representative from the province of S√£o Paulo to the Portuguese assembly () in Lisbon, to which he was admitted 11 February 1822. On 25 April, he made an eloquent speech in defense of Brazilian rights, which were threatened by the Portuguese majority. The Brazilian deputies were unsuccessful, and Feij√≥, with five others, left Lisboa secretly for Falmouth, where, on 22 October 1822, they published a manifesto explaining their conduct. Feij√≥ afterward returned to Brazil, and retired to Itu. In 1824 Dom Pedro I submitted a proposed constitution to the municipalities of the empire, which was almost unanimously accepted, except at Itu, where Feij√≥ proposed to amend it. The province of S√£o Paulo elected him successively to the legislatures of 1826-29 and 1830-33. In 1827 he proposed the abolition of clerical celibacy, and in 1828 submitted a project for the reform of municipalities. In 1831 Feijo was appointed by the regency minister of justice, and in this capacity dissolved undisciplined military bodies, checked on 7 October 1831 the revolution in the Ilha das Cobras, organized on 10 October a body of military police, and in 1832 suppressed another revolt. In 1833 he was appointed life senator, and in 1834 the electors of the empire made him regent of Brazil. On the day previous to his election as regent, he had been appointed bishop of Marianna, but had declined the dignity for political reasons. He took office as regent on 12 October 1835. As regent, he proclaimed liberal and progressive measures, but his policy met with such opposition from the conservatives that he resigned his office on 18 September 1837, retired to S√£o Paulo, and did not appear in the Senate again until 1838. He served as the President of the Senate from 1839 to 1840. In 1842, he edited a political paper called O Justiciero. In the same year a revolution broke out near Campinas, where Feijo was staying, and, although enfeebled by age and sickness, he took upon himself the responsibility of the movement, and, being defeated, was arrested, taken to Santos, and thence to Rio de Janeiro, to be tried by the Senate. He succeeded in explaining his conduct before that body, and this proved to be the last act of his political life, for he died soon afterward.

It was created in 2007 by entrepreneur James Jukes and club promoters Nigel Holliday and Matthew Smyth at a cost of ¬£2M. The major investors were Nicholas Woodhead and Scottish & Newcastle PLC. The club is located opposite Newcastle Cathedral in the city centre. The venue has a capacity of 600 people and focuses largely on table service. It has become known primarily for its celebrity customers.  History  The building at 7 Saint Nicholas Street formerly housed a pub known as Bar M, then a feature of Newcastle's Bigg Market nightlife circuit. Founder James Jukes purchased the site from Premium Bars & Restaurants PLC in 2007 for an undisclosed sum. The building was refurbished and extended, before being opened in December 2007 by Beverley Knight MBE. On 15 November 2008 the venue caused a public row over projecting a logo onto Newcastle Cathedral to create a large billboard advertisement. The Dean of Newcastle at the time, the Very Reverend Christopher Dalliston, publicly called on Newcastle City Council to ban the publicity stunt, saying ‚ÄúThese actions not only disregard the Christian faith but also the heritage of Newcastle. The lights have come into our Sunday evening worship and we are taking action.‚Äù The Council subsequently found that no laws had been broken and were unable to enforce a ban. In 2010, Jukes apologised for the stunt and donated the proceeds from a celebrity fashion show to the Cathedral to pay for decorative floodlighting. On 31 December 2010 The X Factor winner Matt Cardle reportedly ran up an ¬£8,000 bar tab at the venue celebrating New Year‚Äôs Eve and the success of his number one single When We Collide in the UK Singles Chart. On 21 March 2011 Newcastle United F.C players Leon Best and Stephen Ireland issued a public apology to the football club and its supporters after being photographed at the venue with their shirts removed on the eve of a fixture against Stoke City F.C. The incident led to the then Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew banning the entire team from the venue. On 14 May 2011 the club hosted the launch party of Newcastle Fashion Week, broadcast live on FashionTV to approximately 400 million viewers worldwide. will.i.am and fellow band members from The Black Eyed Peas attended the event. On 29 August 2011 a woman who had travelled from Manchester to celebrate her birthday at the club was attacked on the dancefloor. Northumbria Police released CCTV images of three women they wished to speak to in connection with the attack, though the perpetrators were never found. On Thursday 19 September 2013, Channel 4 broadcast its documentary Bouncers, focusing on the club's 47 year old security guard Mark Tully. On 6 June 2015 a member of security staff was shot and injured in a drive-by shooting while standing at the entrance of the venue. Witnesses described seeing a black-clad motorcycle rider pull up outside the club at around 22:45 and open fire. A 26-year-old man was arrested in connection with the attack but was later released without charge. Police publicly linked the shooting to members of a well known crime family, although this was denied by a family spokesman and no arrests were made. In the wake of the shooting MP Chi Onwurah publicly raised concerns about inadequate police CCTV coverage in Newcastle and called for change. Kanye West (left) with venue owner James Jukes The venue has had numerous celebrity visitors. Noted customers have included Kanye West, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini, Snoop Dogg and others. The club is regularly used as a location for MTV reality TV show Geordie Shore. Tup Tup Palace has received mixed reviews over the years with some publications reporting that it is overpriced and attracts pretentious people.  Ownership  The business and the leasehold of the building is owned by the operating company Tup Tup Palace Limited, registered in the United Kingdom as company number 06656176.

A vocalist, harmonica player and pianist, Gage is best known for fronting the Jet Harris Band and Dr. Feelgood although he has also led his own band, and issued solo albums featuring artists such as Gypie Mayo. Career Gage's father was a drummer, but he started his musical career as vocalist and harmonica player in a London band \\"The Sloane Squares\\", led by Gwyn Headley, in the mid-1960s. The Sloane Squares were well known for their tight music and live shows, and were supporting Jimi Hendrix when they were spotted by Jet Harris, the former Shadows bass player, who asked them to become his backing band. The Jet Harris single \\"My Lady\\" c/w \\"You Don't Live Twice\\" (1967) features Pete Gage on vocals. Gage left Jet Harris in 1968 but continued performing with numerous bands, including London based soul-blues- band The Blazers. He moved to the West Country, joining the Pink Torpedoes from 1988 to 1992. He also sang and played Hammond organ in his own band, the original Pete Gage Band from 1992‚Äì1995. The band was also known as the Pete Gage Expression, whose album, Give it With a Feeling was issued in May 1995. After the death of their frontman Lee Brilleaux, Dr. Feelgood had a year's break before agreeing to audition for a new vocalist/harpist. After an initial audition followed by a studio recording and a photoshoot, Gage joined Dr Feelgood in June 1995. After initial opposition from some long-term fans, \\"because Lee Brilleaux wasn't there\\", Gage became accepted. They resumed a heavy touring schedule and Gage recorded their 1996 On the Road Again album. He also appears on their 1997 release Twenty Five Years of Dr. Feelgood. Whilst with the Feelgoods, Gage recorded a piano-based blues-album Out of Hours, which was recorded in Finland, and released in 1997 by Finnish record company Goofin' Records. The tensions of constant touring in Dr Feelgood mounted, and it was \\"mutually agreed that Pete would stand down\\". Gage left Dr Feelgood in September 1999 to focus on various other projects, the main one being the development of his own blues band The Pete Gage Band in which he leads from the piano and highlights his gritty vocals. This band continues to feature prominently in the pubs and clubs in the South-West of England. He also continued performing with different bands in England, Spain and particularly Finland, where he has a \\"large and loyal fan base\\". An offshoot from his current blues band is The Pete Gage Blues Trio, featuring Paul Hartshorn on guitar, Duncan Kingston on double bass, and Pete himself on piano and vocals, playing classic blues standards in a laid-back style. He also spent 12 years from 2000 as the vocalist/frontman for the Mike Hoddinott Blues All-Stars In 2010, Gage made an album, Tough Talk (GRCD 6165), recorded and released in Finland. Backed by Finnish band Doctor's Order, (who normally back Johnny Spence, formerly of Johnny Kidd & The Pirates) the album features ex Feelgoods guitarist, and Gages's close friend, the late Gypie Mayo on six tracks. In May 2013 Gage played the Dagenham Roundhouse as part of the Big Blues Jam and reappeared there in September 2013 with the re-united Pink Torpedoes. Confusion There are two well-known British musicians called Pete Gage; the other, a guitarist and producer, played with Geno Washington & The Ram Jam Band, Dada, and Vinegar Joe and married Elkie Brooks, before becoming a producer for artists such as Joan Armatrading. Numerous discographies e.g. Allmusic and CD Universe confuse the artists and include both artists' output in the same list.

Carvings representing priests, hunters, farmers, kings, and mothers are usually depicted on the masks. They are used to acknowledge important roles within the community, and to honor those who perform the roles, as well as ancestors who performed those roles in the past. When not being used during performances, Epa masks are kept in shrines where they are the focus of prayers and offerings from community elders. History Epa masks originated from the seventeen kingdoms which make up the Ekiti region in the north-east of Yoruba territory. Unlike other parts of Yorubaland, Ekiti has been subject to extensive foreign influences. The area received successive waves of immigration from Ife in the sixteenth century and from the Bini in the seventeenth, as well as being the target of military raids from Ilorin and Ibadan in the middle or late nineteenth century. Until the beginning of the nineteenth century the area was considered to have formed part of the Benin empire. Consequently, its population has a complex mixed ethnic origin which has given rise to some unique traditions not previously found elsewhere in Yorubaland but which have since spread to the Iyagba, Igbomina, Oshun, Owo and Ijesha regions. It is also not surprising to find that the warrior figures often surmounting Epa masks represent heroes who proved their mettle during this long period of instability. Design Epa masks consist of a Janus faced helmet and an often elaborate figurative superstructure usually carved with a female or equestrian figure at its center. Surrounding the central figure are typically smaller figures, representing traders, musicians, hunters and other personages central to Yoruba community life. Many Epa masks bear names like 'Mother with Children', 'Owner of Many Children', 'Children Cover Me' (like a protecting cloth), 'Children are Honorable to Have', 'Bringer of Children', 'Mother of Twins', 'Nursing Mother' and many other similar appellations, which occur in the songs that accompany the dancers. The helmet is always simply carved, often with two faces, and is reminiscent of a mortar or pot. Such similarities are made explicit in the term for the helmet, tkiko ('pot'), alluding to it as a container of spiritual power and otherworldly force, ase. The eyes of one face are usually carved open, looking out to the world of the living, while those on the other are sealed, contemplating the realm of the divine and the ancestors. Much Yoruba ceremonial is concerned with the control and focusing of this divine force for the benefit of the community. The control and focusing of ase is a central theme throughout the different episodes that make up the Epa festival as well as apparently constituting a theme in other ceremonies in which Epa masks are used. The equestrian figures from episodes from the region's turbulent history incorporate representations of the channeling of ase to safeguard the conquering hero. Maternity figures invoke ase for increasing procreative abilities and fertility, while references to medicine also express the dependence of personal well-being on the judicial channeling of ase. Perhaps, then, the iconographic clue to the meaning of Epa masks is not to be found in their elaborate superstructures, but in the crude pot helmet itself as a manifestation of the efficacy of ase for communal and personal well-being. Ritual Context In north-west Yorubaland the Epa masks are kept by the head of a lineage or a town chief on behalf of the lineage or community. When in use they are choreographed as emerging from the bush, where they return once the festival is completed. Offerings may be made to a mask before it is used or during the ceremony. According to Robert Thompson, 'the Epa cult stresses the transformation of young men into stalwart specimens able to bear pain and shoulder heavy weight'. King Arowolo of lloro distinguished between the type of energy belonging to the cult of Elefon, concerned with ancestral spirits, and the cult of Epa, connected with the dignified, slow and patient masquerades of ancient men and culture heroes. While the Ekiti Yoruba share their principal deities with Yoruba from elsewhere, they also have many deities and masquerades peculiar to themselves, leading other fieldworkers to note that the distinction is less clear than Thompson suggested. In north- eastern Yorubaland, Epa and other masks are used in annual ceremonies, held in February or March in some places or as late as September in others to promote the fertility and well-being of the community. They also appear in Elefon festivals performed to celebrate the return of the warriors, to honor Ogun, the god of war and iron and to mark the growth of new crops. Elsewhere such masks were used in post-burial rites relating to titled men. In one fairly consistent episode in the festival the masquerader, supporting a mask which can often weigh 50 lbs or more, attempts to jump off a mound to augur the quality of the new year. A fall or loss of balance is read as a bad omen which may herald coming misfortune. Epa Masquerade Early writers interpreted Epa ceremonies as entirely focused on fertility. However, others have found the ceremonies to be equally concerned with warriors and the medicine God Osanyin, relating them to both physical and spiritual security. Ojo, following Carroll, has proposed that at one level the ceremonies incorporate the re-enactment of historical events. In a ceremony recorded by Heyden in lloro, Ekiti, masks surmounted by female figures were identified as the wives of the warrior Okotorojo, represented by an animal mask resembling a goat or antelope. Okotorojo, the principal figure in the festival, was chained to another man described as either having the duty to restrain the wild powers of the warrior or, paradoxically, as the representative of the power (ase) of Eleda, who always remains behind the warrior to render him invincible in battle.

Methods SFRA is a comparative method, meaning an evaluation of the transformer condition is done by comparing an actual set of SFRA results to reference results. Three methods are commonly used to assess the measured traces: * Time-based - current SFRA results will be compared to previous results of the same unit. * Type-based - SFRA of one transformer will be compared to an equal type of transformer. * Phase comparison - SFRA results of one phase will be compared to the results of the other phases of the same transformer. Process Transformers generate a unique signature when tested at discrete frequencies and plotted as a curve. The distance between conductors of the transformer forms a capacitance. Any movement of the conductors or windings will change this capacitance. This capacitance being a part of complex L (inductance), R (Resistance) and C (Capacitance) network, any change in this capacitance will be reflected in the curve or signature. An initial SFRA test is carried out to obtain the signature of the transformer frequency response by injecting various discreet frequencies. This reference is then used for future comparisons. A change in winding position, degradation in the insulation, etc. will result in change in capacitance or inductance thereby affecting the measured curves. Tests are carried out periodically or during major external events like short circuits and results compared against the initial signature to test for any problems.

It is sometimes also referred to \\"the theory of psychological reactance\\", stating that attempts to restrict a person's freedom often produce an \\"anticonformity boomerang effect\\".Brehm, S.; Brehm, J.W. (1981). Psychological reactance: a theory of freedom and control. Academic Press. Conditions and explanations Early recognition Hovland, Janis and KellyHovland, C.I., Janis, I.L., & Kelley, H. H. Communication and persuasion. New Haven. Yale University Press, 1953 first recorded and named the boomerang effect in 1953, noting that it is more likely under certain conditions: * When weak arguments are paired with a negative source. * When weak or unclear persuasion leads the recipient to believe the communicator is trying to convince them of a different position than what the communicator intends. * When the persuasion triggers aggression or unalleviated emotional arousal. * When the communication adds to the recipient's knowledge of the norms and increases their conformity. * When non-conformity to their own group results in feelings of guilt or social punishment. * When the communicator's position is too far from the recipient's position and thus produces a \\"contrast\\" effect and thus enhances their original attitudes. Later in 1957, Hovland, Sherif and Harvey further discussed the necessity of understanding these unintended attitude changes in persuasion communication and suggested possible approaches for analysis via underlying motivational processes, psychophysical stimuli, as well as ego-involving verbal material. Jack Brehm and Arthur Cohen were among the first to provide theoretical explanations. Jack Brehm first raised attention to the phenomenon a fait accompli that might conceivably create dissonance if an event has led to the opposite behavior predicted at a prior point. He conducted an experiment to examine the behaviors of eighth graders eating a disliked vegetable. About half of them were told that their parents would be informed on the vegetable they ate. Then liking the vegetable was measured before and after the procedure. The results show that for kids who indicated little or no discrepancy between serving and actually eating the disliked vegetable at home, they should experience little or no dissonance in liking the vegetable from the low to the high consequence condition. They thereby concluded that the greater was the individual's initial dislike, the greater was the pressure produced by the experiment to increase his liking. There was also larger resistance to change the attitude when the initial attitude was more extreme. However, they argued that in this experiment, the pressure to reduce dissonance increased more rapidly with increasing discrepancy than did the resistance against change, which verified Festinger's cognitive dissonance theory.Festinger, L. (1962). A theory of cognitive dissonance (Vol. 2). Stanford university press. In a follow up, Sensenig and Brehm focused on the boomerang effect in experiments and applied Brehm's psychological reactance theoryBrehm, J. W. (1966). A theory of psychological reactance. New York: Academic Press. to explain the unintended attitudinal change. Psychological reactance theory analysis Sensenig & Brehm applied Brehm's reactance theory to explain the boomerang effect. They argued that when a person thinks that his freedom to support a position on attitude issue is eliminated, the psychological reactance will be aroused and then he consequently moves his attitudinal position in a way so as to restore the lost freedom. He told college students to write an essay supporting one side of five issues and led some of them believe that their persuasive essays might influence the decision on those issues. Therefore, the people who had the impression that their preference was taken into account in the decision regarding which side they would support on the 1st issue showed attitude change in favor of the preferred position, while others who are concerned with their freedom lost move toward the intended position held by the communicator. This experiment resulted in various links in the chain of reasoning: (a) when a person's freedom is threatened, his motivational state will move toward restoration of the threatened freedom; (b) the greater the implied threatened freedoms, the greater the tendency to restore the threatened freedom will be; (c) the reestablishment of freedom may take the form of moving one's attitudinal position away from the position forced by others. Jack Brehm and Sharon Brehm later developed psychological reactance theory and discussed its applications. They also listed a series of reactions reactance can evoke in addition to the boomerang effect, which includes but is not limited to related boomerang effect, indirect restoration or vicarious boomerang effects. Cognitive dissonance theory analysis The dissonance theory by Leon Festinger has thrived the progress of social psychology research in the 1960s as it is not confined to the prediction of intended influence but can support almost all sub fields of psychology studies. Although Festinger himself was ambiguous about the role of commitment in the theory, later researchers such as BrehmBrehm, J. W. (1960). A dissonance analysis of attitude-discrepant behavior. Attitude Organization and Change, 164-97. and Cohen have emphasized its importance in providing a general conceptualization of the boomerang effect. Earlier studies by Thibaut and Strickland and Kelley and Volkhart have also provided support to this line of reasoning by Dissonance Theory despite that they were not phrased using the exact terminology. According to Cohen, dissonance theory can provide not only an explanation, but also a prediction of both the intended and the unintended influence of persuasion communication on attitudinal change. In his experiment, he presented factors that can lead to a boomerang effect, while suggesting a broader view of the unintended consequences than simply the case of a response to attempted attitude change. Cohen proposed the following dissonance formulation model for the unintended attitude change by persuasive communication. First, suppose that dissonance aroused in regard to some unspecified cognition. According to Festinger's Cognitive Dissonance Theory, we know the dissonance could be reduced by a change in the cognition. Now suppose the resistance to change is great because the actual event cannot be changed and its meaning is ambiguous (for example, the person is strongly committed to the original cognition position), then the person will resort to other forms to reduce or eliminate the dissonance. In this latter form, one can solve the discrepancy problem through the addition of elements consonant either with the original cognition, in which produced the boomerang effect. Cohen formulated a situation of \\"mutual boomerang effect\\", in which the communicator is strongly committed to convince the other person of his attitudinal position by means of a persuasion communication. Because of this strong original attitude position the communicator holds, Cohen predicts that the more distant the target person's original attitude, the more dissonance will be also experienced by the communicator. The expected \\"unintended influence\\" arises when the communicator tried to persuade the other of the worth of his own position by becoming even more extreme in that position. He asked his subjects write a strongly persuasive essay to the partners with an opposite side of attitude on an issue, who are actually confederates. The subjects here thus act as the communicator to bring their partners over to their own sides. The subjects were also asked to rate the partners' likability and friendliness before they read \\"their partner's essay\\" returned. Cohen used attitude change of the partners as the manipulation of dissonance where he randomly allocated his subjects into high-dissonance group and low-dissonance group. The results exposed strong boomerang effects for high-dissonance group. He also found out that the response to the likability and friendliness of the partners are relevant. The data showed that the difference between dissonance conditions was largely confined to and exaggerated for those subjects who originally rated their partners to be relatively more likable and friendly. Cohen's study on boomerang effect has broadened the scope of persuasive communication from merely the recipient's reaction to the persuasive message to the communicator's attempt to influence the target. Dissonance theory suggests that the basic issue is under what conditions a person strengthens his original attitude as a way of reducing some attitudinal inconsistency. Cohen suggested that, one can reduce the dissonance via boomerang when dissonance is created (a) with a strong commitment to convincing the other person, (b) with no anticipation of a further influence attempt, and (c) with no easy chance to repudiate the other person. His results on the likability have strengthened the interpretation as the low-dissonance group who found their partners likable and friendly move toward them in the attitudes more, while likability only increased dissonance for the highs. In other words, the dissonance can be reduced by becoming more extreme in the original position, thereby increasing the proportion of cognition supporting the initial stand and decreasing the proportion of dissonant cognition. Other analysis Boomerang effect is sometimes also referred to the attribution/attitude boomerang effect. Researchers applied Heider's attribution theoryHeider, F. (1958). The psychology of interpersonal relations. Psychology Press. to explain why it would occur. For example, Skowronski, Carlston, Mae, and Crawford demonstrated association-based effects in their study on spontaneous trait transference. Despite that the descriptions of other people are independent of the communicator, simple associative processes link the two together and produce boomerang phenomena. Examples of applications Consumer behavior Wendlandt and Schrader studied the resistance of consumers against loyalty programs encountered in relationship marketing. They found that (a) contractual bonds provoke reactance effects, (b) social-psychological bonds increased neither reactance nor perceived utility of the program, (c) economic bonds raised perceived utility to a certain threshold level, from which the reactance effect dominated afterwards. Their results helped managers to evaluate the effects from implementing consumer retention measures and advised a cautious and limited application of loyalty programs. Deliberate exploitation The tactic of reverse psychology, which is a deliberate exploitation of an anticipated boomerang effect, involves one's attempt of feigning a desire for an outcome opposite to that of the truly desired one, such that the prospect's resistance will work in the direction that the exploiter actually desires (e.g., \\"Please don't fling me in that briar patch\\"). Persuasive health communication Researchers have reported that some public health interventions have produced effects opposite to those intended in health communication such as smoking and alcohol consumption behaviors, and thus have employed various methods to study them under different contexts. Ringold argued that some consumer's negative reactions on alcoholic beverage warnings and education efforts can be explained concisely by Brehm's psychological reactance theory. These results suggested that boomerang effects should be considered as potential costs of launching mass communication campaigns. Dillard and Shen also emphasized the importance of reactance theory to understand failures in persuasive health communication but argued that there be a measurement problem. They thereby developed four alternative conceptual perspectives on the nature of reactance as well as provided an empirical test of each. Environmental behaviors Mann and Hill investigated the case of litter control and showed that the combination of different positive influence strategies could actually create boomerang effect and decrease the amount of appropriate disposal of waste. Schultz et al. (2007) conducted a field experiment in which the normative messages were used to promote household energy conservation where they found the descriptive message of neighborhood usage created a boomerang effect depending on the high prior household consumption. They also eliminated the boomerang effect by adding an injunctive message about social approval. Their results offered an empirical evidence for prior research on the theoretical framework for boomerang effects. Helping Schwartz and Howard discussed the occurrence of boomerang effects in helping as they found out the presence of certain factors presumed to activate norms favoring helping actually result in decreasing helping.Schwartz, S.H. and Howard, J.A., 1981. A Normative decision-Making Model of Altruism, In: J.P. Rushton and R.M. Sorrentino (Editors), Altruism and Helping Behaviour, Lawrence Erlbaum, New Jersey, 189‚Äì211. They identified three related forms of such boomerang effect in helping behavior. First, when individuals perceived the framing of a help appeal to have excessive statements of need, they become suspicious and concern the motive and the true severity of the original request (i.e., mistrust). Reactance theory was used to provide the second explanation. They stated that individuals would respond to threatened freedoms by either acting counter to the attempted social influence, or declaring themselves helpless. The third type involves undermining internalized benefits by external sanctions. National and human security Liotta attempted to understand policy decisions and future choices driven by a blurring of concerns that involve state-centric security and human security. She suggested that a boomerang effect occurs in the area in which excessive focus on one aspect of security at the expense or detriment of the other is a poor balancing of ends and means in a changing security environment and instead we should focus on both national and human security. Political beliefs Nyhan & Reifler conducted experiments in which subjects read mock news articles including a misleading claim from a politician, or such a claim followed by a correction. They found that the corrections frequently fail to reduce misconceptions for the ideological group targeted by the misinformation. They also found cases of what they called a \\"backfire effect\\" (i.e. a boomerang effect) in which the corrections strengthened belief in the misinformation. They attribute this to motivated reasoning on the part of the affected participants. Later research did not find evidence of this effect though, suggesting it was at least not prevalent.

Found in northern Europe, the wasp is notable for the mass provisioning behaviour of the females, hunting caterpillars mainly on sunny days, paralysing them with a sting, and burying them in a burrow with a single egg. The species is also remarkable for the extent to which females parasitise their own species, either stealing prey from nests of other females to provision their own nests, or in brood parasitism, removing the other female's egg and laying one of her own instead. Description Ammophila sabulosa is a large ( long) and striking solitary wasp with a very long narrow \\"waist\\" of two segments. The species can be told from A. pubescens (which is smaller, long) as the waist widens out very gradually into the \\"tail\\" of the abdomen. The pattern of the forewings also differs: the third submarginal cell makes broad contact with the cell to its front and the rear end of the abdomen has a faint metallic blue sheen. The whole body is black except for the front half of the \\"tail\\", which is orange. Behaviour video of Ammophila sabulosa in Austria The adults fly in summer on heathland and sandy places, hunting for caterpillars. The wasp grabs the upper (dorsal) side of each caterpillar, and angles her long abdomen around under the caterpillar to sting it on its lower (ventral) side, paralyzing it. The female digs burrows in sandy ground, provisions each burrow with a food supply of paralyzed caterpillars, and lays one egg, always on the first caterpillar. A female may make up to ten nests, one at a time; about half the nests are provided with one large caterpillar, and half with two to five smaller caterpillars. The burrow is sealed with stones, twigs or pieces of earth and then covered with sand. The female camouflages the nest with debris such as pine needles and pebbles unless the surface in the area is bare sand. Females are normally active only in direct sunlight. Nests are nearly always mass provisioned, which means fully stocked with enough food to take the wasp larva through to pupation, and then permanently closed. Brood parasitism Females often parasitize their own species, either stealing prey from nests of other females to provision their own nests, or in brood parasitism, removing the other female's egg and laying one of her own instead. Brood parasitism \\"appears to be a cheap and easy route to producing offspring\\", as it takes only about 30 minutes to switch eggs in an existing nest, but about 10 hours to build and provision a new nest; however, more than 80% of brood-parasitized nests were themselves parasitized by another female.  Distribution  Ammophila sabulosa is widely distributed across Eurasia with records from France, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Norway, Sweden and Finland, then ranging eastwards as far as the Russian Far East, with a very few records in India and Japan. It is also found in the southern half of Britain.  Former Subspecies  Several subspecies have been described, but none of these are presently considered as conspecific with sabulosa; * Ammophila vagabunda F.

Biography Feininger came to the United States with his parents in 1853. They settled in Columbia, South Carolina. Feininger was educated in St. Mary's College there. He displayed a talent for music, and was placed with August Koepper for instruction. He made his debut at 14, playing the violin part of a Beethoven trio (Op. 7, No. 2). Afterward, he studied music in the Leipzig Conservatory in Germany where he studied with Ferdinand David. He led an orchestra in 1863. He returned to the United States in 1864 when the Civil War was in progress, and enlisted in the Union Army, serving under General Gillmore until the war ended. After the war, he taught music, and also made his first appearance in New York as a violin soloist in 1867. In 1874, he traveled through South America on an extended tour, where he met with success as a violinist. In 1886, he made his debut as a composer in Berlin. His first concert of 7 October included his \\"Academische\\" overture (1866), his \\"Narciss\\" overture (1868), a symphony (op. 12, highly praised by Franz Liszt; 1870), and \\"Emotive Pictures\\" (1885). In 1887, his symphonies, suites and symphonic poems were performed in Berlin by an orchestra under the direction of Benjamin Bilse. Feininger's compositions also included choruses with orchestral accompaniment, and many songs in English and German. He also started an opera, \\"Die Br√ºder.\\" After a concert tour through many of the capitals of Europe, he returned to the United States and devoted himself to concert work and teaching. Feininger developed a new mode of teaching the piano, \\"based upon absolute knowledge of human character.\\" He was head of the music department of the Low and Heywood School for Girls of Stamford, Connecticut, for 32 years. He was the author of An experiential psychology of music (1909). Feininger's manuscript diary for 1911-1913, which is in Manuscripts Division of the New York Public Library, reveals a man given to bitter racial denunciations of blacks, especially of the cooks he and his wife hired and fired, and to a deep attachment to the New Thought religious movement, which also motivated Feininger to draft a dozen chapters for a book denouncing the founder of Christian Science, Mary Baker Eddy, as an \\"ignoramus\\" and fraud. The book never was published, although some fragments of it may be contained in the papers of his son Lyonel Feininger, the German Expressionist painter, at Harvard University's Houghton Library.Karl Feininger Diary, 1911-1913, MssColl 984, Manuscripts and Archives Division, New York Public Library, especially entries for January 22, April 23, and June 7, 1912. He was survived by his wife, Jane Potter Feininger, a pianist and accompanist who toured with him until 1910. For several years, she was the piano accompanist of the London Handel Society. He was also survived by a son, Lyonel Feininger, a noted painter.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. It is the oldest Arts and Crafts-style school building in Detroit, and likely one of the oldest Arts and Crafts-style schools in Michigan. History The Duane Doty School was named after former Superintendent of Schools for Detroit Duane Doty, who was appointed to that post in 1865. The original building was designed by Malcomson and Higginbotham, with construction starting in 1908 and ending in 1909. When it opened, the school contained 20 classrooms and was intended to hold 640 students from kindergarten through eighth grade. An addition costing $134,300 was completed in 1921, which added 320 students to the school's capacity. A gymnasium addition was constructed in 1928. In 1959, the building was substantially remodeled, and six new classrooms were added in the basement and first floor. By the end of 1960, enrollment in the school was 1,193 students. The building was later used as the Boykin Continuing Education Center. After major renovations completed in 2012, the building was re-opened as The Henry Ford Academy: Elementary School. Description Duane Doty School, c. 1910 The Duane Doty School is a two-story L-shaped, red brick, hipped roof structure placed on a high, windowed basement. The front facade has five bays, with the central bay projecting substantially outward. The two main entrances are located in single story vestibules flanking the main bay. The central and end bays of the school contain rows of wooden six-over-six sash windows with stone sills. The roof eaves are supported by paired or triples sets of oversized decorative brackets. A square tower behind one of the entrances pierces the roofline. A hipped roof addition dating from 1921 sits behind the building, and the flat-roofed gymnasium from 1928 extends further. Inside the building, the main entry vestibules have terrazzo floors, with staircases leading up to the first floor. The original L-shaped building has two intersecting corridors leading to classrooms. The kindergarten classrooms are located between the two main entrances at the front of the building. The additions contain a one-story auditorium on the first floor with a gymnasium below in the basement.

Abundant iron compounds are responsible for the bright brownish-red colour of the martian soil.  Elemental composition  Gamma Ray Spectrometer (GRS) Suite on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft. Similar maps exist for a number of other elements. Due to mars core it is differentiated, which‚Äîfor a terrestrial planet‚Äîimplies that it has a central core made up of metallic iron and nickel surrounded by a less dense, silicate mantle and crust. Like Earth, Mars appears to have a molten iron core, or at least a molten outer core. However, there does not appear to be convection in the mantle. Presently Mars shows little (if any) geological activity. The elemental composition of Mars is different from Earth's in several significant ways. First, Martian meteorite analysis suggests that the planet's mantle is about twice as rich in iron as the Earth's mantle.Halliday, A. N. et al. (2001). The Accretion, Composition and Early Differentiation of Mars. In Chronology and Evolution of Mars, Kallenbach, R. et al. Eds., Space Science Reviews, 96: pp. 197‚Äì230. The planet's distinctive red color is due to iron oxides on its surface. Second, its core is richer in sulphur. Third, the Martian mantle is richer in potassium and phosphorus than Earth's and fourth, the Martian crust contains a higher percentage of volatile elements such as sulphur and chlorine than the Earth's crust does. Many of these conclusions are supported by in situ analyses of rocks and soils on the Martian surface.See Bruckner, J. et al. (2008) Mars Exploration Rovers: Chemical Composition by the APX, in The Martian Surface: Composition, Mineralogy, and Physical Properties, J.F. Bell III, Ed.; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK, p. 58 for example. Much of what we know about the elemental composition of Mars comes from orbiting spacecraft and landers. (See Exploration of Mars for list.) Most of these spacecraft carry spectrometers and other instruments to measure the surface composition of Mars by either remote sensing from orbit or in situ analyses on the surface. We also have many actual samples of Mars in the form of meteorites that have made their way to Earth. Martian meteorites (often called SNC's, for Shergottites, Nakhlites, and Chassignites‚Äîthe groups of meteorites first shown to have a martian origin) provide data on the chemical composition of Mars' crust and interior that would not otherwise be available except through a sample return mission. most abundant gases by volume (Curiosity rover, October 2012). Based on these data sources, scientists think that the most abundant chemical elements in the Martian crust are silicon, oxygen, iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium, and potassium. These elements are major components of the minerals comprising igneous rocks.Press, F.; Siever, R. (1978). Earth, 2nd ed.; W.H. Freeman: San Francisco, p. 343.

On September 5, 2017, scientists reported that the Curiosity rover detected boron, an essential ingredient for life on Earth, on the planet Mars. Such a finding, along with previous discoveries that water may have been present on ancient Mars, further supports the possible early habitability of Gale Crater on Mars. Hydrogen is present as water (H2O) ice and in hydrated minerals. Carbon occurs as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and sometimes as dry ice at the poles. An unknown amount of carbon is also stored in carbonates. Molecular nitrogen (N2) makes up 2.7 percent of the atmosphere. As far as we know, organic compounds are absent except for a trace of methane detected in the atmosphere. On 16 December 2014, NASA reported the Curiosity rover detected a \\"tenfold spike\\", likely localized, in the amount of methane in the Martian atmosphere. Sample measurements taken \\"a dozen times over 20 months\\" showed increases in late 2013 and early 2014, averaging \\"7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere.\\" Before and after that, readings averaged around one-tenth that level.  Mineralogy and petrology  Planet Mars volatile gases (Curiosity rover, October 2012). Mars is fundamentally an igneous planet. Rocks on the surface and in the crust consist predominantly of minerals that crystallize from magma. Most of our current knowledge about the mineral composition of Mars comes from spectroscopic data from orbiting spacecraft, in situ analyses of rocks and soils from six landing sites, and study of the Martian meteorites. Spectrometers currently in orbit include THEMIS (Mars Odyssey), OMEGA (Mars Express), and CRISM (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter). The two Mars exploration rovers each carry an Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS), a thermal emission spectrometer (Mini-TES), and M√∂ssbauer spectrometer to identify minerals on the surface. On October 17, 2012, the Curiosity rover on the planet Mars at \\"Rocknest\\" performed the first X-ray diffraction analysis of Martian soil. The results from the rover's CheMin analyzer revealed the presence of several minerals, including feldspar, pyroxenes and olivine, and suggested that the Martian soil in the sample was similar to the \\"weathered basaltic soils\\" of Hawaiian volcanoes.  Primary rocks and minerals  The dark areas of Mars are characterised by the mafic rock-forming minerals olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar. These minerals are the primary constituents of basalt, a dark volcanic rock that also makes up the Earth's oceanic crust and the lunar maria. thumbleftAred Andromeda THEMIS colour image of olivine basalts in the Valles Marineris. Layers rich in olivine appear dark green FirstLaser Spectrum of chemical elements from ChemCam on the Curiosity Rover (\\"Coronation\\" rock, August 19, 2012). The mineral olivine occurs all over the planet, but some of the largest concentrations are in Nili Fossae, an area containing Noachian-aged rocks. Another large olivine-rich outcrop is in Ganges Chasma, an eastern side chasm of Valles Marineris (pictured). Olivine weathers rapidly into clay minerals in the presence of liquid water. Therefore, areas with large outcroppings of olivine-bearing rock indicate that liquid water has not been abundant since the rocks formed. Pyroxene minerals are also widespread across the surface. Both low-calcium (ortho-) and high-calcium (clino-) pyroxenes are present, with the high- calcium varieties associated with younger volcanic shields and the low-calcium forms (enstatite) more common in the old highland terrain. Because enstatite melts at a higher temperature than its high-calcium cousin, some researchers have argued that its presence in the highlands indicates that older magmas on Mars had higher temperatures than younger ones.Soderblom, L.A.; Bell, J.F. (2008). Exploration of the Martian Surface: 1992‚Äì2007, in The Martian Surface: Composition, Mineralogy, and Physical Properties, J.F. Bell III, Ed. Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK, p. 11. Between 1997 and 2006, the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft mapped the global mineral composition of the planet.Christensen, P.R. et al. (2008) Global Mineralogy Mapped from the Mars Global Surveyor Thermal Emission Spectrometer, in The Martian Surface: Composition, Mineralogy, and Physical Properties, J. Bell, Ed.; Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK., p. 197. TES identified two global-scale volcanic units on Mars. Surface Type 1 (ST1) characterises the Noachian-aged highlands and consists of unaltered plagioclase- and clinopyroxene-rich basalts. Surface Type 2 (ST2) is common in the younger plains north of the dichotomy boundary and is more silica rich than ST1.X-ray diffraction view of Martian soil ‚Äì CheMin analysis reveals feldspar, pyroxenes, olivine and more (Curiosity rover at \\"Rocknest\\", October 17, 2012). The lavas of ST2 have been interpreted as andesites or basaltic andesites, indicating the lavas in the northern plains originated from more chemically evolved, volatile-rich magmas. (See Igneous differentiation and Fractional crystallization.) However, other researchers have suggested that ST2 represents weathered basalts with thin coatings of silica glass or other secondary minerals that formed through interaction with water- or ice-bearing materials. \\"Yellowknife Bay\\" rocks ‚Äì rock veins are higher in calcium and sulfur than \\"Portage\\" soil ‚Äì APXS results ‚Äì Curiosity rover (March, 2013). True intermediate and felsic rocks are present on Mars, but exposures are uncommon. Both TES and the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on the Mars Odyssey spacecraft have identified high-silica rocks in Syrtis Major and near the southwestern rim of the crater Antoniadi. The rocks have spectra resembling quartz-rich dacites and granitoids, suggesting that at least some parts of the Martian crust may have a diversity of igneous rocks similar to Earth's. Some geophysical evidence suggests that the bulk of the Martian crust may actually consist of basaltic andesite or andesite. The andesitic crust is hidden by overlying basaltic lavas that dominate the surface composition but are volumetrically minor. Rocks studied by Spirit Rover in Gusev crater can be classified in different ways. The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts‚Äîalso called picritic basalts. The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic komatiites. Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic shergottites, meteorites which came from Mars. One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lie near the junction of basalt, picrobasalt, and tephrite. The Irvine-Barager classification calls them basalts.McSween, etal. 2004. Basaltic Rocks Analyzed by the Spirit Rover in Gusev Crater. Science : 305. 842‚Äì845 Sheepbed\\" mudstone (lower left) and surroundings (February 14, 2013). On March 18, 2013, NASA reported evidence from instruments on the Curiosity rover of mineral hydration, likely hydrated calcium sulfate, in several rock samples including the broken fragments of \\"Tintina\\" rock and \\"Sutton Inlier\\" rock as well as in veins and nodules in other rocks like \\"Knorr\\" rock and \\"Wernicke\\" rock. Analysis using the rover's DAN instrument provided evidence of subsurface water, amounting to as much as 4% water content, down to a depth of , in the rover's traverse from the Bradbury Landing site to the Yellowknife Bay area in the Glenelg terrain. 350pxScarp retreat by windblown sand over time on Mars (Yellowknife Bay, December 9, 2013). In the journal Science from September 2013, researchers described a different type of rock called \\"Jake M\\" or \\"Jake Matijevic (rock),‚Äù It was the first rock analyzed by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer instrument on the Curiosity rover, and it was different from other known martian igneous rocks as it is alkaline (>15% normative nepheline) and relatively fractionated. Jake M is similar to terrestrial mugearites, a rock type typically found at ocean islands and continental rifts. Jake M discovery may mean that alkaline magmas may be more common on Mars than on Earth and that Curiosity could encounter even more fractionated alkaline rocks (for example, phonolites and trachytes). On December 9, 2013, NASA researchers described, in a series of six articles in the journal Science, many new discoveries from the Curiosity rover. Possible organics were found that could not be explained by contamination. Although the organic carbon was probably from Mars, it can all be explained by dust and meteorites that have landed on the planet. Because much of the carbon was released at a relatively low temperature in Curiosity's Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument package, it probably did not come from carbonates in the sample. The carbon could be from organisms, but this has not been proven. This organic-bearing material was obtained by drilling 5 centimeters deep in a site called Yellowknife Bay into a rock called ‚ÄúSheepbed mudstone‚Äù. The samples were named John Klein and Cumberland. Microbes could be living on Mars by obtaining energy from chemical imbalances between minerals in a process called chemolithotrophy which means ‚Äúeating rock.‚Äù However, in this process only a very tiny amount of carbon is involved ‚Äî much less than was found at Yellowknife Bay. Using SAM's mass spectrometer, scientists measured isotopes of helium, neon, and argon that cosmic rays produce as they go through rock. The fewer of these isotopes they find, the more recently the rock has been exposed near the surface. The 4-billion-year-old lakebed rock drilled by Curiosity was uncovered between 30 million and 110 million years ago by winds which sandblasted away 2 meters of overlying rock. Next, they hope to find a site tens of millions of years younger by drilling close to an overhanging outcrop. The absorbed dose and dose equivalent from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles on the Martian surface for ~300 days of observations during the current solar maximum was measured. These measurements are necessary for human missions to the surface of Mars, to provide microbial survival times of any possible extant or past life, and to determine how long potential organic biosignatures can be preserved. This study estimates that a few meters drill is necessary to access possible biomolecules. The actual absorbed dose measured by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) is 76 mGy/yr at the surface. Based on these measurements, for a round trip Mars surface mission with 180 days (each way) cruise, and 500 days on the Martian surface for this current solar cycle, an astronaut would be exposed to a total mission dose equivalent of ~1.01 sievert. Exposure to 1 sievert is associated with a 5 percent increase in risk for developing fatal cancer. NASA's current lifetime limit for increased risk for its astronauts operating in low-Earth orbit is 3 percent. Maximum shielding from galactic cosmic rays can be obtained with about 3 meters of Martian soil. The samples examined were probably once mud that for millions to tens of millions of years could have hosted living organisms. This wet environment had neutral pH, low salinity, and variable redox states of both iron and sulfur species. These types of iron and sulfur could have been used by living organisms. C, H, O, S, N, and P were measured directly as key biogenic elements, and by inference, P is assumed to have been there as well. The two samples, John Klein and Cumberland, contain basaltic minerals, Ca- sulfates, Fe oxide/hydroxides, Fe-sulfides, amorphous material, and trioctahedral smectites (a type of clay). Basaltic minerals in the mudstone are similar to those in nearby aeoliandeposits. However, the mudstone has far less Fe-forsterite plus magnetite, so Fe-forsterite (type of olivine) was probably altered to form smectite (a type of clay) and magnetite. A Late Noachian/EarlyHesperian or younger age indicates that clay mineral formation on Mars extended beyond Noachian time; therefore, in this location neutral pH lasted longer than previously thought.  Dust and soils  Comparison of Soils on Mars ‚Äì Samples by Curiosity rover, Opportunity rover, Spirit rover (December 3, 2012). Much of the Martian surface is deeply covered by dust as fine as talcum powder. The global predominance of dust obscures the underlying bedrock, making spectroscopic identification of primary minerals impossible from orbit over many areas of the planet. The red/orange appearance of the dust is caused by iron(III) oxide (nanophase Fe2O3) and the iron(III) oxide- hydroxide mineral goethite. The Mars Exploration Rovers identified magnetite as the mineral responsible for making the dust magnetic. It probably also contains some titanium. The global dust cover and the presence of other wind- blown sediments has made soil compositions remarkably uniform across the Martian surface. Analysis of soil samples from the Viking landers in 1976, Pathfinder, and the Mars Exploration rovers show nearly identical mineral compositions from widely separated locations around the planet. The soils consist of finely broken up basaltic rock fragments and are highly enriched in sulphur and chlorine, probably derived from volcanic gas emissions.  Secondary (alteration) minerals  Minerals produced through hydrothermal alteration and weathering of primary basaltic minerals are also present on Mars. Secondary minerals include hematite, phyllosilicates (clay minerals), goethite, jarosite, iron sulfate minerals, opaline silica, and gypsum. Many of these secondary minerals require liquid water to form (aqueous minerals). Opaline silica and iron sulphate minerals form in acidic (low pH) solutions. Sulphates have been found in a variety of locations, including near Juventae Chasma, Ius Chasma, Melas Chasma, Candor Chasma, and Ganges Chasma. These sites all contain fluvial landforms indicating that abundant water was once present. Spirit rover discovered sulfates and goethite in the Columbia Hills.Christensen, P.R. (2005) Mineral Composition and Abundance of the Rocks and Soils at Gusev and Meridiani from the Mars Exploration Rover Mini-TES Instruments AGU Joint Assembly, 23‚Äì27 May 2005 http://www.agu.org/meetings/sm05/waissm05.htmlKlingelhofer, G., et al. (2005) Lunar Planet. Sci. XXXVI abstr. 2349 Some of the mineral classes detected may have formed in environments suitable (i.e., enough water and the proper pH) for life. The mineral smectite (a phyllosilicate) forms in near-neutral waters. Phyllosilicates and carbonates are good for preserving organic matter, so they may contain evidence of past life. Sulfate deposits preserve chemical and morphological fossils, and fossils of microorganisms form in iron oxides like hematite. The presence of opaline silica points toward a hydrothermal environment that could support life. Silica is also excellent for preserving evidence of microbes.  Sedimentary rocks  Cross-bedded sandstones inside Victoria Crater. Huygens Crater with circle showing place where carbonate was discovered. This deposit may represent a time when Mars had abundant liquid water on its surface. Scale bar is long. Layered sedimentary deposits are widespread on Mars. These deposits probably consist of both sedimentary rock and poorly indurated or unconsolidated sediments. Thick sedimentary deposits occur in the interior of several canyons in Valles Marineris, within large craters in Arabia and Meridiani Planum (see Henry Crater for example), and probably comprise much of the deposits in the northern lowlands (e.g., Vastitas Borealis Formation). The Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity landed in an area containing cross-bedded (mainly eolian) sandstones (Burns formation). Fluvial-deltaic deposits are present in Eberswalde Crater and elsewhere, and photogeologic evidence suggests that many craters and low lying intercrater areas in the southern highlands contain Noachian-aged lake sediments. While the possibility of carbonates on Mars has been of great interest to exobiologists and geochemists alike, there was little evidence for significant quantities of carbonate deposits on the surface. In the summer of 2008, the TEGA and WCL experiments on the 2007 Phoenix Mars lander found between 3‚Äì5wt% (percent by weight) calcite (CaCO3) and an alkaline soil. In 2010, analyses by the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16‚Äì34 wt%) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. The magnesium- iron carbonate most likely precipitated from carbonate-bearing solutions under hydrothermal conditions at near-neutral pH in association with volcanic activity during the Noachian Period. Carbonates (calcium or iron carbonates) were discovered in a crater on the rim of Huygens Crater, located in the Iapygia quadrangle. The impact on the rim exposed material that had been dug up from the impact that created Huygens. These minerals represent evidence that Mars once had a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere with abundant moisture, since these kind of carbonates only form when there is a lot of water. They were found with the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Earlier, the instrument had detected clay minerals. The carbonates were found near the clay minerals. Both of these minerals form in wet environments. It is supposed that billions of years ago Mars was much warmer and wetter. At that time, carbonates would have formed from water and the carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. Later the deposits of carbonate would have been buried. The double impact has now exposed the minerals. Earth has vast carbonate deposits in the form of limestone.  Spirit Rover discoveries in the Aeolis quadrangle  The rocks on the plains of Gusev are a type of basalt. They contain the minerals olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and magnetite, and they look like volcanic basalt as they are fine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and vugs).McSween, etal. 2004. Basaltic Rocks Analyzed by the Spirit Rover in Gusev Crater. Science : 305. 842‚Äì845Arvidson, R. E., et al. (2004) Science, 305, 821‚Äì824 Much of the soil on the plains came from the breakdown of the local rocks. Fairly high levels of nickel were found in some soils; probably from meteorites.Gelbert, R., et al. 2006. The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS): results from Gusev crater and calibration report. J. Geophys. Res. ‚Äì Planets: 111. Analysis shows that the rocks have been slightly altered by tiny amounts of water. Outside coatings and cracks inside the rocks suggest water deposited minerals, maybe bromine compounds. All the rocks contain a fine coating of dust and one or more harder rinds of material. One type can be brushed off, while another needed to be ground off by the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT).Christensen, P. Initial Results from the Mini-TES Experiment in Gusev Crater from the Spirit Rover. Science: 305. 837‚Äì842. There are a variety of rocks in the Columbia Hills (Mars), some of which have been altered by water, but not by very much water. The dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet. All the dust was found to be magnetic. Moreover, Spirit found the magnetism was caused by the mineral magnetite, especially magnetite that contained the element titanium. One magnet was able to completely divert all dust hence all Martian dust is thought to be magnetic. The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low thermal inertia regions like Tharsis and Arabia that have been detected by orbiting satellites. A thin layer of dust, maybe less than one millimeter thick covers all surfaces. Something in it contains a small amount of chemically bound water.Bell, J (ed.) The Martian Surface. 2008. Cambridge University Press. Gelbert, R. et al. Chemistry of Rocks and Soils in Gusev Crater from the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer. Science: 305. 829-305  Plains  Observations of rocks on the plains show they contain the minerals pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase, and magnetite. These rocks can be classified in different ways. The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts‚Äîalso called picritic basalts. The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic komatiites. Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic shergottites, meteorites which came from Mars. One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lie near the junction of basalt, picrobasalt, and tephrite. The Irvine-Barager classification calls them basalts. Plain's rocks have been very slightly altered, probably by thin films of water because they are softer and contain veins of light colored material that may be bromine compounds, as well as coatings or rinds. It is thought that small amounts of water may have gotten into cracks inducing mineralization processes). Coatings on the rocks may have occurred when rocks were buried and interacted with thin films of water and dust. One sign that they were altered was that it was easier to grind these rocks compared to the same types of rocks found on Earth. The first rock that Spirit studied was Adirondack. It turned out to be typical of the other rocks on the plains.  Columbia Hills  Scientists found a variety of rock types in the Columbia Hills, and they placed them into six different categories. The six are: Adirondack, Clovis, Wishstone, Peace, Watchtower, Backstay, and Independence. They are named after a prominent rock in each group. Their chemical compositions, as measured by APXS, are significantly different from each other. Most importantly, all of the rocks in Columbia Hills show various degrees of alteration due to aqueous fluids. They are enriched in the elements phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and bromine‚Äîall of which can be carried around in water solutions. The Columbia Hills' rocks contain basaltic glass, along with varying amounts of olivine and sulfates. The olivine abundance varies inversely with the amount of sulfates. This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but helps to produce sulfates. The Clovis group is especially interesting because the Mossbauer spectrometer (MB) detected goethite in it. Goethite forms only in the presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of past water in the Columbia Hills's rocks. In addition, the MB spectra of rocks and outcrops displayed a strong decline in olivine presence, although the rocks probably once contained much olivine. Olivine is a marker for the lack of water because it easily decomposes in the presence of water. Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form. Wishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and anhydrate (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed sulfur and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form. One type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, phosphorus, calcium, and iron. Also, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe+++ form, which would happen if water had been present. Towards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure silica were found in the soil. The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment. After Spirit stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or Mini-TES and confirmed the presence of large amounts of carbonate-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water. The carbonates were discovered in an outcrop of rocks called \\"Comanche.\\" In summary, Spirit found evidence of slight weathering on the plains of Gusev, but no evidence that a lake was there. However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates which only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component which was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars. Opportunity rover discoveries in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle The rock \\"Berry Bowl\\". Opportunity Rover found that the soil at Meridiani Planum was very similar to the soil at Gusev crater and Ares Vallis; however in many places at Meridiani the soil was covered with round, hard, gray spherules that were named \\"blueberries.\\"Yen, A., et al. 2005. An integrated view of the chemistry and mineralogy of martian soils. Nature. 435.: 49‚Äì54. These blueberries were found to be composed almost entirely of the mineral hematite. It was decided that the spectra signal spotted from orbit by Mars Odyssey was produced by these spherules. After further study it was decided that the blueberries were concretions formed in the ground by water. Over time, these concretions weathered from what was overlying rock, and then became concentrated on the surface as a lag deposit. The concentration of spherules in bedrock could have produced the observed blueberry covering from the weathering of as little as one meter of rock.Squyres, S. et al. 2004. The Opportunity Rover's Athena Science Investigation at Meridiani Planum, Mars. Science: 1698‚Äì1703.Soderblom, L., et al. 2004. Soils of Eagle Crater and Meridiani Planum at the Opportunity Rover Landing Site. Science: 306. 1723‚Äì1726. Most of the soil consisted of olivine basalt sands that did not come from the local rocks. The sand may have been transported from somewhere else.Christensen, P., et al. Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover. Science: 306. 1733‚Äì1739. Minerals in dust A M√∂ssbauer spectrograph was made of the dust that gathered on Opportunity's capture magnet. The results suggested that the magnetic component of the dust was titanomagnetite, rather than just plain magnetite, as was once thought. A small amount of olivine was also detected which was interpreted as indicating a long arid period on the planet. On the other hand, a small amount of hematite that was present meant that there may have been liquid water for a short time in the early history of the planet.Goetz, W., et al. 2005. Indication of drier periods on Mars from the chemistry and mineralogy of atmospheric dust. Nature: 436.62‚Äì65. Because the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) found it easy to grind into the bedrocks, it is thought that the rocks are much softer than the rocks at Gusev crater. Bedrock minerals Few rocks were visible on the surface where Opportunity landed, but bedrock that was exposed in craters was examined by the suite of instruments on the Rover.Bell, J., et al. 2004. Pancam Multispectral Imaging Results from the Opportunity Rover at Meridiani Planum. Science: 306.1703‚Äì1708. Bedrock rocks were found to be sedimentary rocks with a high concentration of sulfur in the form of calcium and magnesium sulfates. Some of the sulfates that may be present in bedrocks are kieserite, sulfate anhydrate, bassanite, hexahydrite, epsomite, and gypsum. Salts, such as halite, bischofite, antarcticite, bloedite, vanthoffite, or glauberite may also be present.Christensen, P., et al. 2004 Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover. Science: 306. 1733‚Äì1739.Squyres, S. et al. 2004. In Situ Evidence for an Ancient Aqueous Environment at Meridian Planum, Mars. Science: 306. 1709‚Äì1714. \\"Homestake\\" formation The rocks contained the sulfates had a light tone compared to isolated rocks and rocks examined by landers/rovers at other locations on Mars. The spectra of these light toned rocks, containing hydrated sulfates, were similar to spectra taken by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer on board the Mars Global Surveyor. The same spectrum is found over a large area, so it is believed that water once appeared over a wide region, not just in the area explored by Opportunity Rover.Hynek, B. 2004. Implications for hydrologic processes on Mars from extensive bedrock outcrops throughout Terra Meridiani. Nature: 431. 156‚Äì159. The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) found rather high levels of phosphorus in the rocks. Similar high levels were found by other rovers at Ares Vallis and Gusev Crater, so it has been hypothesized that the mantle of Mars may be phosphorus- rich. The minerals in the rocks could have originated by acid weathering of basalt. Because the solubility of phosphorus is related to the solubility of uranium, thorium, and rare earth elements, they are all also expected to be enriched in rocks. When Opportunity rover traveled to the rim of Endeavour crater, it soon found a white vein that was later identified as being pure gypsum. It was formed when water carrying gypsum in solution deposited the mineral in a crack in the rock. A picture of this vein, called \\"Homestake\\" formation, is shown below. Evidence of water Cross-bedding features in rock \\"Last Chance\\". Voids or \\"vugs\\" inside the rock Examination in 2004 of Meridiani rocks, showed the first strong in situ evidence for past water by detecting the mineral jarosite, which only forms in water. This discovery proved that water once existed in Meridiani Planum. In addition, some rocks showed small laminations (layers) with shapes that are only made by gently flowing water. The first such laminations were found in a rock called \\"The Dells.\\" Geologists would say that the cross-stratification showed festoon geometry from transport in subaqueous ripples. A picture of cross- stratification, also called cross-bedding, is shown on the left. Box-shaped holes in some rocks were caused by sulfates forming large crystals, and then when the crystals later dissolved, holes, called vugs, were left behind. The concentration of the element bromine in rocks was highly variable probably because it is very soluble. Water may have concentrated it in places before it evaporated. Another mechanism for concentrating highly soluble bromine compounds is frost deposition at night that would form very thin films of water that would concentrate bromine in certain spots. Rock from impact One rock, \\"Bounce Rock,\\" found sitting on the sandy plains was found to be ejecta from an impact crater. Its chemistry was different from the bedrocks. Containing mostly pyroxene and plagioclase and no olivine, it closely resembled a part, Lithology B, of the shergottite meteorite EETA 79001, a meteorite known to have come from Mars. Bounce rock received its name by being near an airbag bounce mark. Meteorites Opportunity Rover found meteorites just sitting on the plains. The first one analyzed with Opportunity's instruments was called \\"Heatshield Rock,\\" as it was found near where Opportunity's heatshield landed. Examination with the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES), Mossbauer spectrometer, and APXS lead researchers to, classify it as an IAB meteorite. The APXS determined it was composed of 93% iron and 7% nickel. The cobble named \\"Fig Tree Barberton\\" is thought to be a stony or stony-iron meteorite (mesosiderite silicate),Squyres, S., et al. 2009. Exploration of Victoria Crater by the Mars Rover Opportunity. Science: 1058‚Äì1061. while \\"Allan Hills,\\" and \\"Zhong Shan\\" may be iron meteorites. Geological history Observations at the site have led scientists to believe that the area was flooded with water a number of times and was subjected to evaporation and desiccation. In the process sulfates were deposited. After sulfates cemented the sediments, hematite concretions grew by precipitation from groundwater. Some sulfates formed into large crystals which later dissolved to leave vugs. Several lines of evidence point toward an arid climate in the past billion years or so, but a climate supporting water, at least for a time, in the distant past. Curiosity Rover discoveries in the Aeolis quadrangle The Curiosity rover encountered rocks of special interest on the surface of Aeolis Palus near Aeolis Mons (\\"Mount Sharp\\") in Gale Crater. In the autumn of 2012, rocks studied, on the way from Bradbury Landing to Glenelg Intrigue, included \\"Coronation\\" rock (August 19, 2012), \\"Jake Matijevic\\" rock (September 19, 2012), \\"Bathurst Inlet\\" rock (September 30, 2012). Evidence for ancient water On September 27, 2012, NASA scientists announced that the Curiosity rover found evidence for an ancient streambed suggesting a \\"vigorous flow\\" of water on Mars. On December 3, 2012, NASA reported that Curiosity performed its first extensive soil analysis, revealing the presence of water molecules, sulfur and chlorine in the Martian soil. On December 9, 2013, NASA reported that, based on evidence from Curiosity rover studying Aeolis Palus, Gale Crater contained an ancient freshwater lake which could have been a hospitable environment for microbial life. Evidence for ancient habitability In March 2013, NASA reported Curiosity found evidence that geochemical conditions in Gale Crater were once suitable for microbial life after analyzing the first drilled sample of Martian rock, \\"John Klein\\" rock at Yellowknife Bay in Gale Crater. The rover detected water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Chloromethane and dichloromethane were also detected. Related tests found results consistent with the presence of smectite clay minerals. Detection of organics On 16 December 2014, NASA reported the Curiosity rover detected a \\"tenfold spike\\", likely localized, in the amount of methane in the Martian atmosphere. Sample measurements taken \\"a dozen times over 20 months\\" showed increases in late 2013 and early 2014, averaging \\"7 parts of methane per billion in the atmosphere.\\" Before and after that, readings averaged around one-tenth that level. In addition, high levels of organic chemicals, particularly chlorobenzene, were detected in powder drilled from one of the rocks, named \\"Cumberland\\", analyzed by the Curiosity rover.

Background After the revolution of 1848 and its suppression, the cultural life of Czech people was weakened by the absolutism of the Austrian Empire's Bach government and also because a lot of intellectuals died. These included J√°n Koll√°r, Franti≈°ek Ladislav ƒåelakovsk√Ω, Josef Kajet√°n Tyl, and Karel Havl√≠ƒçek Borovsk√Ω. In 1853 two important masterpieces of Czech literature were published that avoided reflecting the political situation ‚Äì Babiƒçka (The Grandmother) by Bo≈æena Nƒõmcov√° and Kytice by Karel Jarom√≠r Erben. Ladislav Quis: Nƒõkolik slov doslovem, Almanach M√°j reprint, Prague 1909 The first manifestation of the new generation of authors appeared in the literary almanac Lada Ni√≥la published by Josef V√°clav Friƒç in 1856, which was the first to admire the legacy of Karel Hynek M√°cha. V√°clav Stanƒõk: Struƒçn√© dƒõjiny literatury ƒçesk√©, Olomouc 1905, p. 98 The authors of the young generation did not have much to publish, and the only literary periodicals were in the hands of old and conservative writers (Jakub Mal√Ω, Lum√≠r of Ferdinand B≈ôetislav Mikovec). The almanac The almanac was initiated by Jan Neruda, then a 24-year-old writer who had just entered his literary career with a collection of poems called H≈ôbitovn√≠ kv√≠t√≠ (Graveyard Flowers, 1857) which was not well received for its sorrowful scepticism. Gustav Pallas and Vojtƒõch Zelinka: Obrazov√© dƒõjiny literatury ƒçesk√©, d√≠l II., Prague 1926, p. 18 For this reason, Jan Neruda persuaded a journalist he knew, Josef Bar√°k, who was on the contrary very popular for his tough attitude against the Bach system, to be the editor. The name for the almanac is said to come from Josef V√°clav Friƒç and shows the admiration for the imposing poem by Karel Hynek M√°cha. The young authors gathered in the ballrooms of Karel Link and a caf√© in Dominican Street (now Husova ulice 352/2), Prague. The almanac was published on 16 May 1858 (the feast of John of Nepomuk) by publisher Hermann Dominikus (another publisher who was suggested by Neruda and H√°lek was not allowed to publish it by the police). The volume's first page had a dedication to Karel Hynek M√°cha, and a portrait of the poet sketched to resemble a picture of John the Baptist by Franti≈°ek Ma≈°ek (1836), in a little chapel in the compound of the ruins of Vald≈°tejn Castle. Bo≈æena Nƒõmcov√° was the only author who was paid an honorarium for her contribution, which was motivated mainly by her difficult financial situation at the time. Reception and following volumes The only extensive review was published in Kritische Bl√§tter by Ign√°c Jan Hanu≈°. Other magazines either wrote nothing or just short reports. Jakub Mal√Ω wrote several diatribes against the young authors in a P√≠sek magazine (Poutn√≠k od Otavy) which provoked the authors' activity, and in the next three years three more volumes of M√°j were published, edited by V√≠tƒõzslav H√°lek. The group received more and more attention and in the end totally seized Czech literary life. The group was called M√°jovci, and took on new members (e.g. Gustav Pfleger- Moravsk√Ω), but after the last volume (1862) it gradually split up. Authors *Josef V√°clav Friƒç (as M.

This made Meizu the first company to announce a quad-core smartphone and, later, the first to announce an Exynos 4-based smartphone, beating the Samsung Galaxy S III in marketing time (even though the latter went on sale first). The MX was the first Meizu phone to achieve extensive coverage on tech blogs and websites outside China because of its features comparable to the flagship phones of major mobile phone manufacturers. Thanks to the good reception, rumors stated the MX could arrive on Western markets.  History   Design  The first rumors about a successor of the Meizu M9 leaked out in Q4 2010, even before M9's official launch itself, suggesting that a so- called M9II phone was in development, with a dual-core processor, 4-inch screen and 1 GB of RAM. Initially, this phone was supposed to look almost identical the M9, although with upgraded hardware, and some media thought it could have been a competitor in China to the iPhone 5, rumored to be in development, as happened with the Meizu M9. In mid-April 2011 Meizu officially confirmed that the company was developing the phone, along with declaring that its name would be MX (M10, following the company's product name numeration). In this period the MX was attributed a Retina-like display resolution (1280x854 or 1200x900 pixels), which is not the one of the production models' display. The device's final design, price and release date. were changed many times, as happened before with the M9.  Release  Pre-orders for the dual-core MX started on December 15, 2011 and granted a guarantee to receive the phone exactly on January 1, 2012, the day that official distribution started through the company's flagship stores (in China and Hong Kong). On launch day many customers waited for their turn outside the stores, forming queues (not as long as the ones for the M9 though); some reports claim that Meizu wanted to avoid attracting big crowds (for a matter of public order), so the customers who pre-ordered the devices were invited to arrive at the store only after receiving a phone confirmation. Even so, people started arriving the night before January 1. Meizu assured that production and supplies would be able to meet customers' demand by 2012 Chinese New Year's Day (January 23), advising people to order the MX as soon as possible to receive it by that date. Meanwhile, the quad- core version was rumored to be going on sale around mid-2012 and on April 16, 2012 it was officially announced that it would start selling in June. Meizu, in partnership with PCCW Mobile, held a launch party in Hong Kong on June 25, 2012, formalizing the release date of the MX 4-core: June 30. On that day many customers went to pick up their new phone at Meizu stores, resulting some cities running out of stock the same day. On July 14 a new, improved dual-core model was released, replacing the old model in Meizu's product lineup. It features a 32 nm SoC, a bigger capacity battery and an improved Wi-Fi module.  Features   Models  The Meizu MX is available in two variants, differing primarily for the system on a chip they use: one model uses an Exynos 4 Dual 32 nm with a dual-core 1.4 GHz ARM Cortex-A9 CPU, an ARM Mali 400 quad-core GPU and 1 GB of RAM, while the other model, named MX 4-core, uses the Exynos 4 Quad 32 nm with a quad-core 1.4 CPU (the other characteristics being equal). Meizu declares that the Exynos 4 Quad used by the MX 4-core model has a CPU 60% faster and a GPU 50% faster, compared to the previous model, while at the same time consuming 20% less battery. The dual- core model is equipped with a 16 GB flash memory for internal storage, while the quad-core model is available with either a 32 GB or a 64 GB memory. The current dual-core model was preceded by another one, currently discontinued, which used a battery 100 mAh less powerful than the one mounted on the quad-core model, had a display with lower contrast and a Wi-Fi module with poorer reception. The present dual-core model has been updated with the corresponding components from the 4-core variant. (See the Launch and sale section for further information)  Hardware and design  The Meizu MX has a plastic body with a Gorilla Glass display cover; it measures x x and weighs . It has a classic candybar shape, being rectangular with rounded corners, and presents only one central physical button at the front, like many modern touchscreen smartphones. The MX features also two situation aware capacitive keys (which are also haptic enabled), a technology patented by Meizu; these soft keys have different functions based on the device's orientation and functions. The front of the phone, including the key and the metal border around it, is completely black, and so is the internal chassis, while the back cover is available in five different colors (pure white, ivory white, misty pink, lilac purple and milky lime). These covers are made from double-layer plastics: the bottom one is colored and the top one is transparent, giving the back a glossy finish, similarly to other smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy S III and the Huawei Honor. The MX features a 4-inch diagonal, 960x640 pixel (DVGA resolution) ASV multi-touch capacitive touchscreen display, with an aspect ratio of 3:2, supporting up to 16 million colors and with a pixel density of 288 ppi. In addition to the touchscreen input and the front keys, the device has a volume/zoom control on the right side and the power/lock button on the top. The MX doesn't have a camera shutter key, but it is possible to capture a photo using the volume key or by swiping a finger on the proximity sensor (via a software update). The Meizu MX has a VGA front-facing camera and an 8.0 MP camera on the back. The main camera has a backside illuminated CMOS sensor with autofocus; the optics have an aperture of f/2.2 and the macro focus is capable of clearly capturing objects as close as 5‚Äì10 cm. The software settings includes support for geotagging, smile detection, panorama mode and wide dynamic range.  Reception  The MX4 received generally positive reviews. Engadget gave the MX a score of 74 out of 100 possible points and praised the sharp display, great audio quality and good build quality.

He built cyclotrons at the University of California, Cornell University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During World War II, he served in the operations research group at the Office of Naval Research. Livingston was the chairman of the Accelerator Project at Brookhaven National Laboratory, director of the Cambridge Electron Accelerator, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, a professor of physics at MIT, and a recipient of the Enrico Fermi Award from the United States Department of Energy. He was Associate Director of the National Accelerator Laboratory from 1967 to 1970.  Early life  Milton Stanley Livingston was born in Brodhead, Wisconsin, on May 25, 1905, the son of McWhorter Livingston, a minister of religion, and his wife Sarah Jane. Sarah was a member of the Ten Eyck family, an influential New York family whose Dutch origins date back to the 1640s. He had three sisters. The family moved to California when Livingston was five years old, and he grew up in Burbank, Pomona and San Dimas. His father became a high school teacher and principal. His mother died when he was 12 years old, and his father later remarried. Livingston thereby acquired five half-brothers. After graduating from high school in 1921, Livingston entered nearby Pomona College, intending to major in chemistry, but he disliked the way that chemistry was being taught there, and arranged with the Professor of Physics, Roland R. Tileston, to take physics courses as well. He received his Bachelor of Arts (AB) in 1926, with a double major in physics and chemistry. Tileston arranged for him to then enter Dartmouth College with a teaching fellowship. He was awarded his Master of Arts (MA) in 1928, studying x-ray diffraction, and stayed on for another year as an instructor.  Cyclotrons  M. Stanley Livingston (L) and Ernest O. Lawrence next to a 27-inch cyclotron at the Radiation Laboratory in 1934. During that year, Livingston applied to graduate schools for teaching fellowships, and was accepted by both Harvard University and the University of California. He accepted the latter and returned to California. He wrote his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) thesis on \\"The Production of High Velocity Hydrogen Ions without the Use of High Voltages\\", a topic suggested by Ernest Lawrence, who had noticed that ions of mass M and charge e moving in a uniform magnetic field B circulate at a constant frequency independent of energy: : = { eB \\\\over Mc } In theory, therefore, if a particle traversed an electrode with a voltage V N times, it would acquire energy of NeV. Stanley's task was to verify if this would work. In January 1931, Stanley managed to do just that, using a voltage of 1 kV to accelerate hydrogen ions to 80 keV. At Lawrence's prompting, Stanley quickly wrote up his thesis and submitted it in April 1931 so that he would be eligible for an instructorship the following year. His oral exam proved more difficult. Raymond Birge started asking questions about nuclear physics, and Livingston had to admit that he knew nothing about the work of Ernest Rutherford, James Chadwick, and Charles Drummond Ellis, and had not read their 1930 monograph Radiations from Radioactive Substances. Nonetheless, Lawrence managed to persuade the examiners to award Livingston his doctorate. In what would be become a recurring pattern, as soon as there was the first sign of success, Lawrence started planning a new, bigger machine, which became known as a cyclotron. Lawrence and Livingston drew up a design for an $800 cyclotron in early 1932, with a magnet that weighed 2 tons. Lawrence then found a massive 80-ton magnet that had originally been built to power a transatlantic radio link during World War I, but was now rusting in a junkyard in Palo Alto. This allowed them to build a 27-inch cyclotron. In the cyclotron, they had a powerful scientific instrument, but this did not translate into scientific discovery. In April 1932, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton at the Cavendish laboratory in England announced that they had bombarded lithium with protons and succeeded in transmuting it into helium. The energy required turned out to be quite low‚Äîwell within the capability of the 11-inch cyclotron. On learning about it, Lawrence wired the Berkeley and asked for Cockcroft and Walton's results to be verified. It took the team until September to do so, mainly due to lack of adequate detection apparatus. Between 1932 and 1934, Livingston authored or co-authored over a dozen papers on nuclear physics and the cyclotron, but he felt overshadowed by Lawrence, and did not think that he had gotten sufficient credit for his part in designing the cyclotron, for which Lawrence would receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in November 1939. Livingston therefore accepted an offer of an assistant professorship from Cornell University in 1934. He built a 2 MeV cyclotron at Cornell with an $800 grant and the help of graduate students and the departmental shop, the first one to be built outside Berkeley. He worked with Robert Bacher and Hans Bethe, helping produce one of the three milestone papers that appeared in Reviews of Modern Physics that became known as the \\"Bethe Bible\\". He also teamed up with Bethe to demonstrate for the first time that the neutron has a magnetic moment. Livingston recalled that Bethe: Physicists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) had decided that they too needed a cyclotron, and Robley Evans hired Livingston to build a cyclotron there in 1938. Livingston became an instructor at MIT the following year, and an assistant professor the year after. The cyclotron was completed in 1940. During World War II, he worked with the cyclotron for the Office of Medical Research of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), producing radioactive isotopes of phosphorus and iron that were used as tracers in medical experiments. The result of this research was new methods of stabilizing blood, so that it could be shipped to the troops in remote theaters of war. In 1944, Livingston joined Philip Morse's operations research group at the Office of Naval Research, and he worked in Washington, DC, and London on radar countermeasures to the U-boats.  Later life  Livingston returned to MIT soon after the end of the war, but in 1946 a consortium of universities including MIT banded together to create the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island, New York, as a facility for carrying out Big Science research activities that were beyond the resources of a single academic institution. Morse was appointed as Brookhaven's first director, and he asked Livingston to take charge of building an accelerator for the new national laboratory. It was decided that it should be a new type of accelerator known as synchrotron that had been proposed by Edwin McMillan in 1945. Isidor Isaac Rabi in particular argued that it should be more powerful than any planned by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. As it turned out, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) was unwilling to fund two giant 10 GeV accelerators, but was willing to fund two smaller ones of 2.5 GeV and 6 GeV. At a meeting at which Brookhaven was represented by Morse, Livingston and Leland John Haworth, the Brookhaven team accepted the smaller one, hoping that they would be able to get it finished first and thereby have an advantage in building the 10 GeV machine. The machine, known as the Cosmotron, was approved by the AEC in April 1948, and reached its full power of 3.3 GeV in 1953. Livingston was unable to stay at Brookhaven to see the Cosmotron project completed because he faced losing his tenure at MIT, and elected to return there in 1948. At MIT he taught classes, and participated in a 1950 experiment by the Los Alamos National Laboratory to investigate the lifetimes of short- lived fission products. He still thought about accelerators, though, and in 1952, along with Ernest Courant, Hartland Snyder and J. Blewett at Brookhaven, developed strong focusing, the principle that the net effect on a particle beam of charged particles passing through alternating field gradients is to make the beam converge. The advantages of strong focusing were then quickly realised, and deployed on the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, which achieved 33 GeV in 1960. A plan to build a synchrotron at MIT and Harvard also came to fruition under Livingston's leadership, resulting in the Cambridge Electron Accelerator (CEA), which became operational in 1962. The CEA exploded on July 6, 1965, injuring eight people, one of them fatally. The National Accelerator Laboratory, was renamed the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in 1974, was established in Batavia, Illinois in 1967. Like Brookhaven, it was run by a consortium of universities. Robert R. Wilson was appointed its first director, with Livingston as his associate director They initiated the design of what became the Tevatron, a 1 TeV particle accelerator. Livingston retired in 1970, and moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico. He continued to occasionally work as a consultant at the nearby Los Alamos National Laboratory, and sometimes acted as an administrative judge for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. He married Lois Robinson while he was a graduate student at Berkeley in 1930. They had two children, a daughter, Diane, and a son, Stephen. They were divorced in 1949, and he married Margaret (Peggy) Hughes in 1952. After Peggy died he remarried Lois in 1959. He died in Santa Fe on August 25, 1986 from complications arising from prostate cancer. He was survived by his wife Lois and children Diane and Stephen.

Methods dating back to 17th century techniques developed by Nicholas Steno, including the so-called law of superposition and stratigraphy, used to estimate the geological histories of Earth and the Moon, are being actively applied to the data available from several Martian observational and measurement resources. These include the landers, orbiting platforms, Earth-based observations, and Martian meteorites. Observations of the surfaces of many Solar System bodies reveal important clues about their evolution. For example, a lava flow that spreads out and fills a large impact crater is likely to be younger than the crater. On the other hand, a small crater on top of the same lava flow is likely to be younger than both the lava and the larger crater since it can be surmised to have been the product of a later, unobserved, geological event. This principle, called the law of superposition, along with other principles of stratigraphy first formulated by Nicholas Steno in the 17th century, allowed geologists of the 19th century to divide the history of the Earth into the familiar eras of Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. The same methodology was later applied to the MoonSee Mutch, T.A. (1970). Geology of the Moon: A Stratigraphic View; Princeton University Press: Princeton, NJ, 324 pp. and Wilhelms, D.E. (1987). The Geologic History of the Moon, USGS Professional Paper 1348; http://ser.sese.asu.edu/GHM/ for reviews of this topic. and then to Mars.Scott, D. H.; Carr, M.H. (1978) Geologic Map of Mars, Misc. Invest. Set. Map 1-1083; USGS: Reston, Va. HiRISE image illustrating Steno's law of superposition. The dark-toned lava flow overlies (is younger than) the light-toned terrain at right. The ejecta of the crater at centre overlies both units, indicating that the crater is younger than both units. Another stratigraphic principle used on planets where impact craters are well preserved is that of crater number density. The number of craters greater than a given size per unit surface area (usually million km2) provides a relative age for that surface. Heavily cratered surfaces are old, and sparsely cratered surfaces are young. Old surfaces have many big craters, and young surfaces have mostly small craters or none at all. These stratigraphic concepts form the basis for the Martian geologic timescale.  Relative ages from stratigraphy  Stratigraphy establishes the relative ages of layers of rock and sediment by denoting differences in composition (solids, liquids, and trapped gasses). Assumptions are often incorporated about the rate of deposition, which generates a range of potential age estimates across any set of observed sediment layers.  Absolute ages  The primary technique for calibrating the ages to the Common Era calendar is radiometric dating. Combinations of different radioactive materials can improve the uncertainty in an age estimate based on any one isotope. By using stratigraphic principles, rock units' ages can usually only be determined relative to each other. For example, knowing that Mesozoic rock strata making up the Cretaceous System lie on top of (and are therefore younger than) rocks of the Jurassic System reveals nothing about how long ago the Cretaceous or Jurassic Periods were. Other methods, such as radiometric dating, are needed to determine absolute ages in geologic time. Generally, this is only known for rocks on the Earth. Absolute ages are also known for selected rock units of the Moon based on samples returned to Earth. Assigning absolute ages to rock units on Mars is much more problematic. Numerous attempts have been made over the years to determine an absolute Martian chronology (timeline) by comparing estimated impact cratering rates for Mars to those on the Moon. If the rate of impact crater formation on Mars by crater size per unit area over geologic time (the production rate or flux) is known with precision, then crater densities also provide a way to determine absolute ages. Unfortunately, practical difficulties in crater counting and uncertainties in estimating the flux still create huge uncertainties in the ages derived from these methods. Martian meteorites have provided datable samples that are consistent with ages calculated thus far, but the locations on Mars from where the meteorites came (provenance) are unknown, limiting their value as chronostratigraphic tools. Absolute ages determined by crater density should therefore be taken with some skepticism.  Crater density timescale  Studies of impact crater densities on the Martian surfaceTanaka, K.L. (1986). The Stratigraphy of Mars. J. Geophys. Res., Seventeenth Lunar and Planetary Science Conference Part 1, 91(B13), E139‚ÄìE158. have delineated three broad periods in the planet's geologic history. The periods were named after places on Mars that have large- scale surface features, such as large craters or widespread lava flows, that date back to these time periods. The absolute ages given here are only approximate. From oldest to youngest, the time periods are: *Pre-Noachian Represents the interval from the accretion and differentiation of the planet about 4.5 billion years ago (Gya) to the formation of the Hellas impact basin, between 4.1 and 3.8 Gya. Most of the geologic record of this interval has been erased by subsequent erosion and high impact rates. The crustal dichotomy is thought to have formed during this time, along with the Argyre and Isidis basins. *Noachian Period (named after Noachis Terra): Formation of the oldest extant surfaces of Mars between 4.1 and about 3.7 billion years ago (Gya). Noachian-aged surfaces are scarred by many large impact craters. The Tharsis bulge is thought to have formed during the Noachian, along with extensive erosion by liquid water producing river valley networks. Large lakes or oceans may have been present. *Hesperian Period (named after Hesperia Planum): 3.7 to approximately 3.0 Gya. Marked by the formation of extensive lava plains. The formation of Olympus Mons probably began during this period. Catastrophic releases of water carved extensive outflow channels around Chryse Planitia and elsewhere. Ephemeral lakes or seas may have formed in the northern lowlands. *Amazonian Period (named after Amazonis Planitia): 3.0 Gya to present. Amazonian regions have few meteorite impact craters but are otherwise quite varied. Lava flows, glacial/periglacial activity, and minor releases of liquid water continued during this period.Salese, F., G. Di Achille, A. Neesemann, G. G. Ori, and E. Hauber (2016), Hydrological and sedimentary analyses of well- preserved paleofluvial-paleolacustrine systems at Moa Valles, Mars, J. Geophys. Res. Planets, 121, 194‚Äì232, doi:10.1002/2015JE004891 The date of the Hesperian/Amazonian boundary is particularly uncertain and could range anywhere from 3.0 to 1.5 Gya. Basically, the Hesperian is thought of as a transitional period between the end of heavy bombardment and the cold, dry Mars seen today.  Mineral alteration timescale  In 2006, researchers using data from the OMEGA Visible and Infrared Mineralogical Mapping Spectrometer on board the Mars Express orbiter proposed an alternative Martian timescale based on the predominant type of mineral alteration that occurred on Mars due to different styles of chemical weathering in the planet's past. They proposed dividing the history of the Mars into three eras: the Phyllocian, Theiikian and Siderikan. *Phyllocian (named after phyllosilicate or clay minerals that characterize the era) lasted from the formation of the planet until around the Early Noachian (about 4.0 Gya). OMEGA identified outcropping of phyllosilicates at numerous locations on Mars, all in rocks that were exclusively Pre-Noachian or Noachian in age (most notably in rock exposures in Nili Fossae and Mawrth Vallis). Phyllosillicates require a water-rich, alkaline environment to form. The Phyllocian era correlates with the age of valley network formation on Mars, suggesting an early climate that was conducive to the presence of abundant surface water. It is thought that deposits from this era are the best candidates in which to search for evidence of past life on the planet. *Theiikian (named after sulphurous in Greek, for the sulphate minerals that were formed) lasted until about 3.5 Gya. It was an era of extensive volcanism, which released large amounts of sulphur dioxide (SO2) into the atmosphere. The SO2 combined with water to create a sulphuric acid-rich environment that allowed the formation of hydrated sulphates (notably kieserite and gypsum). *Siderikan (named for iron in Greek, for the iron oxides that formed) lasted from 3.5 Gya until the present. With the decline of volcanism and available water, the most notable surface weathering process has been the slow oxidation of the iron-rich rocks by atmospheric peroxides producing the red iron oxides that give the planet its familiar colour.

Description Fordilla are small bivalves with valves that are equal in size and suboval in shape. In size Fordilla specimens reach a total shell length of up to and a height of . The shells are compressed laterally and the back edge is slightly broadened. The rear adductor is less developed and smaller than the front adductor, while the small pedal retractor muscle scar is positioned near the front adductor scar. The valve hinge is usually straight to slightly convexly curved and each valve will have at most one tooth present. The external surface of the shell occasionally show faint ribbing. Similar to Fordilla, species of Pojetaia are small, with valves to less than in length. Pojetaia species have an overall shape which is suboval, with the subequal valves slightly elongated. The ligament is straight with an umbo which is central to subcentral. In contrast to Fordilla the rear adductor muscle was larger and more developed then the front adductor, with pallial muscles arranged along the valve margins. Also in contrast to Fordilla, valves of Pojetaia possess between one and three teeth, with up to two teeth per valve. The exteriors of the shells show faint ribbing and fine comarginal growth lines. The inner shell layers of Fordilla and Pojetaia species both consist of layers of carbonate, which is akin to the laminar aragonite layer found in extant monoplacophora. The structuring is similar to shell layering found in the extinct genera Anabarella and Watsonella which is thought to suggest that members of the phylum Mollusca developed nacre independently several times.

Tajik is a subdivision of Fars (Persian).http://roostayenoqol.wordpress.com/ Religion Noqol's people belong to Jafari shia faith. There is no holy shrine and clergyman in the village but they historically respect two holy shrines outside the village; Pir davood in Kohangan and Seyed Mohammad in Khafr.

Padena is located less than 150 km north-west of Persepolis, the glorious capital of Achaemenian Empire. Although, there is not a credible resource on the history of this village, mostly because of lack of scientific study, but, since this mountain region, has been one of the main source of water nearby the capital of Achaemenian Empire, it probably, inhabited and had a significant strategic importance for the world most powerful empire on fifth century B.C. There are some ruined grave nearby the village shows an unknown history. There are also, many customs, believes, traditions and words in the culture of this village trace back to the Ancient Persia.http://roostayenoqol.wordpress.com/ After invasion of Turks and Mongols to Persia, this village as same as the other Iranian farmers who was living in the rural areas has engaged in a conflict with the nomadic Turkic tribes looking for pasture for their flock of sheep. This conflict in the past millennium has been the destiny of the people of this village and the other villages in Padena. In the nineteenth century, although they were working and living in the village, all the lands of village possessed to Qashqai Khans. Some modern historical events such as; Iranian Constitutional Revolution in 1906, Oppression of Nomads ( Feudalists ) and Land Reform in 1960s made them the owners of lands of the village. Economy Agricultural products, especially red and golden apple, are the main source of income in this village. Natural Resources Water is the most important natural resource in this village. The main stream, recently canalized, used for irrigation of apple gardens, originates from the Pazanpir Peak. Kuh-e Noqol Kuh-e Noqol is a mountain peak located south of the village of Noqol. According to Peakery.com, \\"it ranks as the 172nd highest mountain in I≈üfahƒÅn and the 1535th highest mountain in Iran.

Although the mountain receives a lot of precipitation in winter, there is little water resource in the summer, which distinguishes it from the mountain of Dena (Dinar).

Although these frameworks are primarily designed to reduce ambiguity, increased efficiency is often cited as a secondary benefit. The concept has existed since at least 1971, when it was demonstrated to be an effective method of conflict resolution for married couples.  Examples  A structured communication program was initiated amongst healthcare workers in British Columbia, Canada following an agreement between employees and employers in 2006. A 2007 study researched the application of structured communication to End-Point Projection theory, which could allow for the development of web services that are able to adapt to unknown channels and/or participants. At least one company has suggested that research tools such as surveys, polls, and quizzes are a form of structured communication as well.  Limitations  Student teaching is one area in which structured communication was shown to be detrimental, as student teachers using structured communication were less efficacious than those who did not. This could be because structured communication is designed to place limits on some aspect of communication, such as questions, answers, participants, or channels, in order to guide communication to a desired outcome. These limitations could limit knowledge transfer in a teaching environment.

An exGaussian random variable Z may be expressed as , where X and Y are independent, X is Gaussian with mean Œº and variance œÉ2, and Y is exponential of rate Œª. It has a characteristic positive skew from the exponential component. It may also be regarded as a weighted function of a shifted exponential with the weight being a function of the normal distribution. Definition The probability density function (pdf) of the exponentially modified normal distribution is :f(x;\\\\mu,\\\\sigma,\\\\lambda) = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{2} e^{\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{2} (2 \\\\mu + \\\\lambda \\\\sigma^2 - 2 x)} \\\\operatorname{erfc} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu + \\\\lambda \\\\sigma^2 - x}{ \\\\sqrt{2} \\\\sigma}\\\\right), where erfc is the complementary error function defined as :\\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname{erfc}(x) & = 1-\\\\operatorname{erf}(x) \\\\\\\\\\\\ & = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}} \\\\int_x^\\\\infty e^{-t^2}\\\\,dt. \\\\end{align} This density function is derived via convolution of the normal and exponential probability density functions. Alternative forms for computation An alternative but equivalent form of the EMG distribution is used for description of peak shape in chromatography. This is as follows : f(x; h, \\\\mu, \\\\sigma, \\\\tau )=\\\\frac{h\\\\sigma}{\\\\tau} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}}\\\\exp \\\\left( \\\\frac {1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac {\\\\sigma}{\\\\tau} \\\\right)^2 - \\\\frac {x-\\\\mu}{\\\\tau} \\\\right) \\\\operatorname{erfc} \\\\left( \\\\frac {1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\\\left( \\\\frac {\\\\sigma}{\\\\tau} - \\\\frac {x-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma} \\\\right) \\\\right ) , (1) where :h is the amplitude of Gaussian, :\\\\tau=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} is exponent relaxation time. This function cannot be calculated for some values of parameters (for example, œÑ=0) because of arithmetic overflow. Alternative, but equivalent form of writing the function was proposed by Delley: : f(x; h, \\\\mu, \\\\sigma, \\\\tau )=h\\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac {1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac {x-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma} \\\\right)^2\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\tau} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2}}\\\\operatorname{erfcx} \\\\left( \\\\frac {1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\ \\\\left( \\\\frac {\\\\sigma}{\\\\tau} - \\\\frac {x-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma} \\\\right) \\\\right ) , (2) where \\\\operatorname{erfcx} t = \\\\exp t^2 \\\\cdot \\\\operatorname{erfc} t is a scaled complementary error function In the case of this formula arithmetic overflow is also possible, region of overflow is different from the first formula, except for very small œÑ. For small œÑ it is reasonable to use asymptotic form of the second formula: : f(x; h, \\\\mu, \\\\sigma, \\\\tau )=\\\\frac{h\\\\exp \\\\left( -\\\\frac {1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\frac {x-\\\\mu}{\\\\sigma} \\\\right)^2\\\\right)} {1+ \\\\frac {\\\\left(x-\\\\mu\\\\right)\\\\tau}{\\\\sigma^2}}, (3) Decision on formula usage is made on the basis of the parameter z = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\tau} - \\\\frac{x - \\\\mu}{\\\\sigma}\\\\right): :for z < 0 computation should be made according to the first formula, :for 0 ‚â§ z ‚â§ 6.71¬∑107 (in the case of double-precision floating-point format) according to the second formula, :and for z > 6.71¬∑107 according to the third formula. Mode (position of apex, most probable value) is calculated using derivative of formula 2; inverse of scaled complementary error function erfcxinv() is used for calculation. The apex is always located on the original (unmodified) Gaussian. Parameter estimation There are three parameters: the mean of the normal distribution (Œº), the standard deviation of the normal distribution (œÉ) and the exponential decay parameter (œÑ = 1 / Œª). The shape K = œÑ / œÉ is also sometimes used to characterise the distribution. Depending on the values of the parameters, the distribution may vary in shape from almost normal to almost exponential. The parameters of the distribution can be estimated from the sample data with the method of moments as follows:Olivier J. and Norberg M. M. (2010) Positively skewed data: Revisiting the Box‚àíCox power transformation. Int. J. Psych. Res. 3 (1) 68‚àí75. : m = \\\\mu + \\\\tau, : s^2 = \\\\sigma^2 + \\\\tau^2, : \\\\gamma_1 = \\\\frac{2\\\\tau^3}{(\\\\sigma^2 + \\\\tau^2)^{3/2}}, where m is the sample mean, s is the sample standard deviation, and Œ≥1 is the skewness. Solving these for the parameters gives: : \\\\hat\\\\mu = m - s \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_1}{2} \\\\right)^{1/3}, : \\\\hat{\\\\sigma^2} = s^2 \\\\left[ 1 - \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_1}{2} \\\\right)^{2/3} \\\\right], : \\\\hat\\\\tau = s \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_1}{2} \\\\right)^{1/3}. Recommendations Ratcliff has suggested that there be at least 100 data points in the sample before the parameter estimates should be regarded as reliable. Vincent averaging may be used with smaller samples, as this procedure only modestly distorts the shape of the distribution. These point estimates may be used as initial values that can be refined with more powerful methods, including maximum likelihood. Confidence intervals There are currently no published tables available for significance testing with this distribution. The distribution can be simulated by forming the sum of two random variables one drawn from a normal distribution and the other from an exponential. Skew The value of the nonparametric skew : \\\\frac{\\\\text{mean} - \\\\text{median}}{\\\\text{standard deviation}} of this distribution lies between 0 and 0.31. The lower limit is approached when the normal component dominates, and the upper when the exponential component dominates.  Occurrence  The distribution is used as a theoretical model for the shape of chromatographic peaks. It has been proposed as a statistical model of intermitotic time in dividing cells. It is also used in modelling cluster ion beams. It is commonly used in psychology and other brain sciences in the study of response times.. In a slight variant where the mean of the Normal component is set to zero, it is also used in Stochastic Frontier Analysis, as one of the distributional specifications for the composed error term that models inefficiency. Related distributions This family of distributions is a special or limiting case of the normal- exponential-gamma distribution. This can also be seen as a three-parameter generalization of a normal distribution to add skew; another distribution like that is the skew normal distribution, which has thinner tails. The distribution is a compound probability distribution in which the mean of a normal distribution varies randomly as a shifted exponential distribution. A Gaussian minus exponential distribution has been suggested for modelling option prices.Peter Carr and Dilip B. Madan, Saddlepoint Methods for Option Pricing, The Journal of Computational Finance (49‚Äì61) Volume 13/Number 1, Fall 2009 If such a random variable Y has parameters Œº, œÉ, Œª, then its negative -Y has an exponentially modified Gaussian distribution with parameters -Œº, œÉ, Œª, and thus Y has mean \\\\mu - \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\lambda} and variance \\\\sigma^2 + \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\lambda^2}.

Open to all who wished to take part, general assemblies allowed for an inclusive form of direct democracy. Such assemblies aimed to establish a consensus among all participants. Assemblies were primarily voice based with different speakers addressing the crowd in turn. The specific forms adopted by the Occupy assemblies vary across the world. Most assemblies had facilitators to keep order and ensure that, if possible, everyone had their say. The larger assemblies often restricted the speakers only to spokespeople who represented smaller working groups, however each individual was still able to provide feedback, if only by means of hand signals. General Assemblies had been used by the Occupy Wall Street movement since its planning stages in August 2011, and were held in Zuccotti Park during the occupation itself. The name \\"New York City General Assembly\\" was given to the general assemblies taking place in Zuccotti Park. The \\"NYCGA\\" website, as it was known, was maintained by the Internet Working group as a resource for all assemblies and its working group meetings. Methods Hand signals used at Occupy general assemblies which allowed continuous feedback and audience participation without the need to interrupt speakers General assemblies were the de facto decision making body of the Occupy Movement from its inception. Designed to facilitate the formation of consensus, they typically reflected egalitarian principles. They were often organized to ensure everyone had the chance to have their say, to counteract the natural tendency for the most forceful to dominate disorganized discussion. In larger assemblies such as some of the ones in New York, this was done by formal mechanisms such as the progressive stack. Another organizational feature from many larger general assemblies was to limit speaking mainly just to representatives of smaller working groups.Working groups met before the GA to decide their common positions on the issues at hand, sometimes on the bases of research carried out by their members. Often they had about 30 or less members, though popular ones were sometimes larger. This meant that each individual had a chance to speak and ask questions at work group level, while at assembly level the discussions were kept at a manageable length. In the smaller assemblies, anyone was able to make proposals for discussion. In larger assemblies, the audience got to make brief spoken responses to proposals from working groups. A queuing based system called a stack was sometimes used to manage this, with the facilitators indicating when it was a particular occupier's turn to speak. Even at the largest assemblies, individuals could always feed back to speakers and the crowd by means of hand signals. Occasionally the hierarchical relationship between general assembly and the working group was reversed ‚Äì a working group would make decisions for the assembly rather than merely feeding into it. For example, with confidential decisions that the assembly wished to hide from possible government agents or other informants, the assembly sometimes delegated executive function to a direct action committee, which was \\"empowered\\" by the assembly to plan actions such as publicity grabbing stunts that were best kept secret from the authorities until they have been executed. History The use of General assemblies for consensus based decision making can be traced to the Athenian democracy that arose around the sixth century BC in Ancient Greece. Athens' version of direct democracy was ended in 322 BC after defeat by the Macedonians. Since then formal decision making assemblies of Common people have occurred only sporadically and have been of little prominence in world affairs, with exceptions occurring as part of the direct democracy taking place in the Swiss Cantons of the late Middle Ages, and the Quaker movement which arose in the mid 17th century. In the 20th century, consensus based assemblies enjoyed a modest resurgence with the US civil rights movement of the 1960s. They grew in prevalence at around the turn of the millennium, manifesting as the spokescouncils of the 1999 anti- globalization movement and as the horizontalist assemblies that began to appear in South America as a response to the Argentine economic crisis (1999‚Äì2002). Assemblies were used from the start of the Spanish Indignados movement in May 2011 ‚Äì this is sometimes seen as the start of the wider Occupy movement, though more often it is considered an immediate precursor, with the global Occupy Movement itself starting with Occupy Wall Street. Assemblies were used during the planning stage of Occupy Wall Street, with the first one taking place by the Wall Street Bull on 2 August 2011. The first General Assembly of Occupy Wall Street itself took place in New York on the day of the movement's launch, September 17, 2011. Protesters had originally planned to hold the meeting at the Chase Manhattan Plaza, but were prevented by police action. According to journalist Nathan Schneider, protesters used Wikipedia to help identify Zuccotti Park as the location for their first assembly. There have since been thousands of general assemblies taking place across the world. Assessment General assemblies are typically experienced positively by those who choose to participate, so much so that occupiers have often been described as \\"fetishizing\\" them. Newcomers have sometimes indulged in soapboxing on their first speech, but folk typically soon chose to respect the process. The Marxist activist Larry Holmes said that the Occupy movement needed to have General Assemblies so they could create \\"real democracy\\", to oppose the existing state sanctioned institutions which he believes are controlled by financial interests. Anthropologist David Graeber has suggested the use of assemblies was a key reason why the Occupy movement gained momentum, in contrast to many other attempts to start a post crisis movement, which used more standard methods of organization but which all failed to get off the ground. The author and academic Luke Bretherton has written that general assemblies provide an \\"experience of a completely different space and time\\" so people can perceive the oppressive nature of regular reality. There has been some criticism of the model, especially concerning the time it takes to form consensus about specific demands. Nathan Schneider has suggested that an issue with assemblies is that to some extent they are incompatible with traditional political groups such as parties, unions and civil society NGOs ‚Äì which is problematic as they need to liaise with these groups to get their message actualized. The specific forms used at the London GA have been criticized for the fact that they allow even a single participant to block consensus, in contrast to GAs in the United States where some require a minimum of 10% of participants to block a motion in order to prevent it being passed. Malcolm Gladwell has suggested that relying solely on consensus-based assemblies to make decisions, while remaining leaderless, is hampering the ability of Occupy to create meaningful change. He contrasted Occupy with the civil rights movement, which he says was carefully controlled and \\"incredibly hierarchical\\", under the leadership of Martin Luther King Jr.whom Gladwell describes as \\"one of the foremost tacticians of the 20th century.\\" By January 2012 general assemblies were still popular around the world even though many of the Occupy camps had been dispersed either voluntarily or by police action. However some journalists had begun to report incidents of infighting among different groups and a general tendency for discussions to become more insular and trivial. A trend developed in the global movement for some occupiers to take significant actions autonomously without waiting for approval from an assembly. Professor Grace Davie reports that at an Occupy Wall Street meeting to discuss general assemblies, held in late December 2011, several participants expressed dissatisfaction with them. Yet other occupiers were advocating for even greater use. One of the more enthusiastic occupiers predicts a \\"coming age of General Assemblies\\" which he thinks may be \\"Humankind‚Äôs best hope\\". On 4 January 2012, The Future of Occupy Collective, an organization set up by occupiers, published their first newsletter on the future of assemblies, where they said: \\"Continuing to hold General Assemblies, in one way or another, seems more important than ever\\".

Anonymous Photograph. The Caleb Forbes Davis Collection, Keokuk Savings Bank and Trust Company, Keokuk, Iowa. Isaac Galland (May 15, 1791 ‚Äì September 27, 1858) was a merchant, postmaster, land speculator, and doctor. He is best known for selling large tracts of land around Commerce, Illinois, to founder of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- Day Saints, Joseph Smith, and the church itself in 1839. Early life Galland was born in Somerset, Pennsylvania, to Matthew Galland and Hannah Fenno during their move from Norfolk, Virginia, to the Western frontier. He was the second of five children. His siblings were Abel (March 9, 1787 ‚Äì 1857), Matthew Jr. (1794‚Äì1812), David (May 10, 1795 ‚Äì November 26, 1872), and Mary (Polly) (September 8, 1798 ‚Äì April 27, 1870). Shortly after his birth, his family relocated to land near Marietta, Ohio, which was located in Ohio's Donation Tract. \\"The remote location of the Galland homestead did not hinder Isaac's education, since his mother, an educated woman, took on the responsibility of teaching him as much as she could until he was thirteen.\\"Margaret A. Bonney, A Biographical Sketch of Galland, Bingham Sitter. American Art Journal 12, no. 3 (Summer, 1980): 76-78. Although little is known of his teenage life before his marriage at 18, according to family tradition, he left Marietta to study at The College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, when he was thirteen; some sources indicate that he left home to search for gold in Mexico, was seized by the Spanish government, and spent one year in a Santa Fe prison for \\"suspicion of evil design.\\" Adult life and relocations Galland married Nancy Harris on March 22, 1811, in Madison County, Ohio. Five years later, in 1816, he married his second wife, Margaret Knight, and moved to Washington County, Indiana. He relocated several times, living in Owen County, Indiana, by 1820 and Edgar County, Illinois, shortly thereafter. He moved to Horselick Grove (later Hancock County), Illinois, in 1824. Galland left both women behind when he traveled down the Ohio River to Indiana Territory. He studied and practiced medicine among settlers, which is why he is referred to as \\"Doctor\\" Galland in some documents. He learned \\"several American Indian languages and gained the trust of the Indians, among whom he would live and trade for much of his life\\". He married for the third time, Hannah Kinney, on October 5, 1826. In 1827, they moved to a remote site on the eastern bank of the Mississippi River at Yellow Banks, the site of present-day Oquawka, Illinois, where he established a trading post. Two years later, in 1829, Galland sold his post and moved across the river arriving in unorganized U.S. territory, four years before permanent settlement began in Iowa. He established the settlement of Nashville on the west bank of the Mississippi River in what is now Lee County, Iowa, where he practiced medicine and founded a trading post. He promoted Nashville as a future commercial center and when families joined the settlement, Galland hired a teacher and built a log house founding the first school in a what would become Iowa Territory. In the harsh frontier conditions, his wife died, leaving him with two very young children. In 1832, before the beginning of the Black Hawk War, Galland moved himself and his children back across the river to Fort Edwards at present day Warsaw, Illinois. Galland served as a colonel during the war, and at age 41, married (for a fourth and last time) on April 25, 1833, Elizabeth Wilcox. She was the sister of the commanding officer at Fort Edwards. Galland ran for Illinois state representative in 1834, but lost. In about 1836, he sat for a portrait painted by George Caleb Bingham, now in the collection of the State Historical Museum of Iowa,Ellwood C. Parry III, \\"Bingham Portrait Rediscovered in Midwest.\\" American Art Journal, Vol. 12, No. 3 (Summer, 1980), pp. 75‚Äì76 the same year that he ran for the Illinois state senate. His political opponent accused him of dishonest land dealings and Galland lost again. Galland speculated with land in the Half-Breed Tract in Lee County, Iowa Territory, which was designated for families of white traders who took Indian wives, so the legality of his land titles were questionable. In 1837, he platted the original town of Keokuk, Iowa (then in Wisconsin Territory) with David W. Kilbourne. The same year, Galland founded the newspapers Western Adventurer and Herald of the Upper Mississippi to encourage development. He bought land across the river in Illinois and \\"laid out the town of Commerce\\". In the winter of 1838‚Äì39, Galland moved from Fort Edwards to Commerce. He lived with his family \\"in a large, two-story house\\" and while there, self-published five issues of the periodical Chronicles of the North American Savage. He sold the town and 19,000 acres of land in the Half-Breed Tract of Iowa to Joseph Smith, leader of the Latter Day Saints, after their expulsion from Missouri. The Iowa land was called the Zarahemla Stake. Galland also sold Smith many acres on the Illinois side of the Mississippi River, in what was called the Military tract. The Military tract was land given to U.S. Soldiers who had fought in the War of 1812 but were paid in land instead of money. These soldiers sold, often for pennies on the dollar, their land claims to speculators like Galland. Galland then in turned sold land to the Mormons on extremely liberal payment terms. Smith renamed the settlement on the east side of the river Nauvoo and encouraged Latter Day Saints to settle there. On July 3, 1839, Galland was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and ordained an elder. He served as Smith's secretary for over a year. Within that capacity he transcribed Smith's \\"'revelations' ... and he came to the conclusion that the prophet's claim to supernatural powers was a fraud.\\"Nelson C. Roberts and Dr. S. W. Moorhead, eds. Story of Lee County Iowa. Vol. I. (Chicago: S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1914), p. 308. In 1840, he published Galland's Iowa Emigrant to promote immigration to the Iowa Territory. Around 1842, Galland withdrew from the church and moved west across the river a second time. From 1842 to 1853 he resided in Keokuk, Iowa Territory. In 1851, at age 60, Galland ran for the Iowa state legislature, but again lost. His land transactions were scrutinized, and he decided to leave \\"until his legal difficulties were resolved\\". In 1853, Galland moved to Sacramento, California, eventually settling in Petaluma, California, only to return three years later in 1856 to Fort Madison. He died there at the age of 67 years on September 27, 1858. Publication Galland wrote a booklet called \\"Galland's Iowa Emigrant\\", published in 1840. The preface of the 1950 reprint of this booklet states that \\"Dr. Isaac Galland ... arrived in what is now Lee County, Iowa in 1829, four years before permanent settlement began in Iowa. ... Despite its brevity, the booklet has the advantage of closer personal observation and longer perspective than\\" other early works.Isaac Galland, \\"Galland's Iowa Emigrant: Containing a Map and General Descriptions of Iowa Territory\\", (Chillicothe: Wm.

Background  Bhanwari Devi was born in poverty in a village in Kishangarh block of Ajmer district, in the India's Rajasthan State. Her parents worked as daily wage labourers; her father was also employed in the State's medical and health department. Devi studied in a government-run school up to Class 8. At the age of 16, she was married off to Amarchand of Borunda village in Jodhpur. At the behest of her father, Devi studied midwifery and got the job as an auxiliary nurse midwife with the same department. During the time of her murder, she was posted at a sub-centre in Jaliwada, a village in Jodhpur district. Deccan Herald reported that it was during her time as a midwife that Devi got in touch with politicians mostly from the ruling Indian National Congress (INC) in connection with her transfers and postings. The report added that \\"she was quick to realise the power of sex appeal among the politicians and bureaucrats. She not only got choice postings but also arranged it for others for a price.\\" It was reported that within a short span of time, Devi amassed wealth beyond her means as a midwife and led a lavish life maintaining several houses and cars. The CBI said that she bought expensive gold ornaments every year. It added that Amarchand remained worked as a vehicle driver during this time and \\"branded as a drunkard\\". They had three children together. The report further added that Devi became over ambitious with time and had demanded a ticket to contest the 2013 State election from the Bhopalgarh constituency. Upon being unsuccessful, she began blackmailing the said leaders demanding money in exchange for a 52-minute long video CD in which they were seen in compromising positions with her. Among them were Mahipal Maderna, a cabinet minister with the Rajasthan government, and legislator Malkhan Singh Bishnoi, the latter of who had maintained an illicit relationship with her for over a decade. She had reportedly been threatening Bishnoi of disclosing his illegitimate child (Devi's younger daughter) in a community gathering on 7 September 2011, or give at least 20 kg of gold jewellery and spend at least 50 lakh on their daughter's wedding who was only seven at the time. She also persisted that he prepare to undergo a paternity test. After Maderna appeared unwilling to buy her repeated claims in relation to the CD, on 24 August 2011, she leaked a part of the CD to a local television news channel and a newspaper which carried the photographs from the CD without directly mentioning his name but giving enough clues that it was Maderna. Devi reportedly went missing on 1 September. Her husband alleged that she was abducted on orders of Maderna. Investigation Under pressure from protests over Maderna's involvement in the murder, the Rajasthan government transferred the case for investigation to the CBI on 15 September. On 23 September, a court directed the government to register an FIR against Maderna. On being rebuked by the Rajasthan High Court about his government's inaction in the case, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot asked Maderna to resign from his post as a cabinet minister, who refused, following which he was sacked, on 16 October. Subsequently, he sacked Mahipal Maderna, one of the many key accused, from the Cabinet on 16 October 2011. The CBI said that Maderna brought in his confidante Sahiram Bishnoi, who hired Sohan Lal Bishnoi, a contractor with the Rajasthan government's Public Health Engineering Department and Devi's friend, to settle the issue. The Bishnois and Shahabuddin, a criminal, hatched a plot to get hold of the CD at any cost over a series of meetings at the Circuit House in Jodhpur in the first week of August 2011, prior to Devi's leaking of the CD. The matter was agreed to be settled for 50 lakh, and the CBI said that an advance amount of 2.5 lakh had been paid to them by Maderna, while a promise of paying the remaining amount by the September end was made. As per plan, Sohan Lal Bishnoi got into another deal with Bhanwari; he was reportedly buying her a car, a Maruti Suzuki Swift for 4.5 lakh and that an advance payment of 50,000 had been made. The CBI investigation revealed that on 1 September, Devi was lured by Sohan Lal Bishnoi to Bilara to make the remaining payment for the car. It was also subject to the verification of the CD, on board the Mahindra Bolero vehicle, belonging to Shahabuddin, which had a video CD player. He was said to have watched the entire CD then. Once in Bilara, the gang roamed around the area with Devi by the car which she reportedly resisted. This was when the three strangulated her. Subsequently, under the directions of Sahiram Bishnoi, they handed her over to some unidentified persons who were on another vehicle, a Mahindra Scorpio.  Initial evidence  On 3 November, as first evidence in the case, the CBI recovered a four-minute audio clip of a conversation between Devi and Indira, the sister of Malkhan Singh Bishnoi. In the clip, the CBI said that Bhanwari is heard speaking to Indira in Marwari language telling her that the politicians had agreed to pay her 7 crore in exchange for the CD, out of she would get 5 crore and that Sohan Lal Bishnoi would take the rest. She was also heard telling Bishnoi that the contractor Sohan Lal had struck the deal with the alleged Delhi-based high-profile power broker through one Sunil Gurjar and that the payment had already been made. She reiterated that Sohan Lal somehow got hold of duplicate CDs but the original was still with her. It transpired that Gurjar, whom Bhanwari referred to as the middleman between the Delhi-based buyer of the CD who tried to sell the CD, and Sohan Lal, is a relative of Puducherry's former lieutenant governor and minister of Rajasthan Govind Singh Gurjar. In November 2011, Shahabuddin's girlfriend Rehana leaked the audio clip of her discussion with him in the Jodhpur Central Jail, where he was lodged, in the media. During the discussion, Shahabuddin was reportedly heard telling her that Devi was handed over to the gang of Pradeep Godara, a criminal wanted by the Rajasthan Police in several cases. Shahabuddin was also heard saying that he had been falsely implicated in the case, and did not know what happened to Devi. This was the third audio clip that the CBI had in its possession. During this time, the CBI while interrogating Rehana, also questioned one Lakha Ram and Bhanwari's husband Amarchand. The latter was called to identify the jewellery, reportedly seized by the CBI from a jeweller in Jodhpur. They suspected that it belonged to Devi and that Shahabuddin had sold the jewellery while he was in the city soon after former went missing. Arrests  Shahbuddin, who carried a 25,000 cash reward on his head, was the first to surrender before the police, on 22 October 2011. During the interrogation of Maderna on 10 November, he confessed to have been in an affair with Devi. The CBI filed its preliminary chargesheet on 2 December. On the same night they arrested Maderna and was brought to Delhi two days later for interrogation. On 8 December, Devi's husband Amarchand was arrested by the CBI after he gave conflicting versions during interrogation while remaining \\"un-cooperative\\". On 19 December, Malkhan Singh Bishnoi was arrested. Upon questioning by the CBI, both he and Maderna maintained innocence. On 4 January 2012, the CBI brought Sahiram Bishnoi face to face with Maderna and two other accused, Sohan Lal Bishnoi and Shahabuddin in the Jodhpur Central Jail. On the same day, the police arrested Bishna Ram Bishnoi, another accused in the case, in Pune. He was the eleventh person to be arrested in connection with the case, all of whom maintained their innocence. Kailash Jakhar, who allegedly disposed of her body, was also found following a tip-off and arrested the same day in a major breakthrough as part of the investigation. Jakhar reportedly admitted with the police to have picked up Devi's body from the Bishnois and Shahabuddin in Bilara on 1 September 2011 and disposed her off by burning her remains somewhere in Jaloda, a village near Phalodi, a town in Jodhpur district. Jakhar was reportedly a member of the Bishna Ram Bishnoi gang, which was also then wanted by the CBI and carried a cash reward of 5 lakh on his head. The CBI had by then already arrested Bishna Ram's brother Om Prakash Bishnoi. On 6 January, the CBI claimed to know the whereabouts of disposal of Bhanwari Devi's body. The case was thus cracked by the CBI inside 100 days and were ready to file the final chargesheet by the end of that month. The 12 members arrested till then were: * Mahipal Maderna * Malkhan Singh Bishnoi * Sahiram Bishnoi * Sohanlal Bishnoi * Shahabuddin * Balia * Bishnaram Bishnoi * Om Prakash Bishnoi * Kailash Jakhar * Parasram Bishnoi, coordinator between the two gangs and Malkhan Singh's brother * Amarchand, Devi's husband * Umeshram Bishnoi, an aide of Sahiram Bishnoi On 17 January 2012, another of Bishnaram's gang, Ashok Bishnoi, who was allegedly involved in the disposal of Devi's body, surrendered before the police. Operation Watch The 'Operation Watch' was launched to collect evidences in connection to Bhanwari Devi's murder. The Rajasthan Police and the CBI accompanied by forensic experts from the Central Forensic Science Laboratory, were involved in it. While searching for evidence in the Rajeev Gandhi Lift Canal near the village of Jaloda and from Jodhpur, a cricket bat that was used to hit Bhanwari Devi on the head and two country-made pistols were recovered. The bat was found wrapped in barbed wire, presumably to ensure that it sank to the bottom of the canal. Bishna Ram Bishnoi and Kailash Jakhar, both the accused in disposing of Bhawari's body, were taken to the spot, to recreate the scene of the crime. At the end of the four-day search, body remains including part of a skull, five teeth and portions of it, and charred bone fragments; a ladies' wrist watch; jewellery parts such as beads of a necklace, a pendant, an earring, toe ring, nose pin and other broken pieces of jewellery were recovered, apart from a gunny bag and some clothes which reportedly belonged to Jakhar. Valuables belonging to his mother were identified by her son Sahil, and she was subsequently declared dead by the Rajasthan Police. As the bone fragments and other body parts such as teeth recovered remained unverified if they were Bhanwari Devi's, they were sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which held expertise in establishing DNA from the dentures, for verification. Prior to this, in February 2012, forensic experts from the AIIMS submitted a report stating that the bones were that of animals. In June, the FBI confirmed that they belonged to Bhanwari Devi. Charge sheet  In a second charge sheet the CBI projected Malkhan Singh as Bhanwari's onetime partner. Malkhan Singh used her to upstage Maderna but later allied with Maderna to murder her. Malkhan's sister Indira Devi and Bhanwari Devi planned to shoot controversial video to make it public later and malign Maderna. But contrary to Malkhan's plan Bhanwari started to blackmail Malkhan too. Additionally Indira Devi who is absconding acted as a troubleshooter for both leaders while dealing with Bhanwari. Indira interfered whenever Bhanwari threatened to go public about the tape. In the charge sheet against 13 accused, Maderna and Malkhan Singh was charged with murder, abduction, criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence. Amarchand, Bhanwari's husband charged with criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and abduction. But investigation against four persons including absconding Indira Devi are pending. In another revelation CBI said that a DNA test proved that Bhanwari's youngest daughter Gungun was fathered by Malkhan. The CBI chargesheet in the Bhanwari Devi murder case describes her as a social climber with \\"big ambitions\\". Former Rajasthan cabinet minister Mahipal Maderna and Congress MLA Malkhan Singh Bishnoi, both charged with murder, are depicted as men fond of \\"sura aur sundari\\" (wine and women). The chargesheet also mentions that Bhanwari made two video recordings, in different locations, showing Maderna and her in a \\"compromising position\\". Family Bhanwari had three children with her husband Amar Chand ‚Äî daughters Ashwini and Suhani, and son Sahil. Investigation into the murder later revealed that the father of their youngest daughter Suhani was Malkhan Singh Bishnoi. On account of abetting the murder at the behest of some politicians and accepting money for the crime, Amar Chand was arrested, and while he remained in judicial custody in January 2012, the Chief Minister of Rajasthan Ashok Gehlot promised financial compensation and assistance with work and education for them as they faced social stigma.

Description The inscription on √ñg 77 has runic text carved in the younger futhark on a serpent that encircles a cross. The inscription is damaged and cannot be classified using the runestone styles developed by Anne-Sophie Gr√§slund in the 1990s as her classification system uses the depiction of the head of the serpent, which is missing on √ñg 77. The stone was found in 1867 in the basement of a former royal family-owned building called the Kungslychan at Hovg√•rden. Before the historic significance of runestones was recognized, they were often re-used as materials in the construction of churches, bridges, and roads. The stone, which had been broken in three pieces, was repaired and then raised just north of Hovg√•rden. The runic text on √ñg 77 states that the stone was raised by a woman named either Tunna or Tonna in memory of her husband √ûorfastr, who is described using the word √≥n√≠√∞ingr. √ìn√≠√∞ingr, which with the √≥- prefix means the opposite of the Old Norse pejorative word n√≠√∞ingr, was used to describe a man as being virtuous. √ìn√≠√∞ingr is used as a descriptive word in some runic inscriptions and is translated in the Rundata database as \\"unvillainous.\\" It is used as a descriptive term on inscriptions S√∂ 189 in √Ökerby, Sm 5 in Transj√∂, Sm 37 in R√∂rbro, Sm 147 in Vasta Ed, and DR 68 in √Örhus, and appears as a name or part of a name on inscriptions √ñg 217 in Oppeby, Sm 2 in Arings√•s, and Sm 131 in Hjortholmen. The text on √ñg 77, Sm 5, and Sm 37 use the same exact phrase, manna m√¶str oni√∞ing Ä or \\"most unvillainous of men\\" to describe the deceased, and DR 68 uses a variant of this phrase. pp. 499-500.

Lloyd Kasten joined the faculty of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of Wisconsin in 1931 and spent the next 68 years pursuing and promoting research on the language and literature of medieval Spain. He produced, usually in collaboration with other scholars, editions of several works of medieval Spanish literature, and he led the teams of scholars who compiled the most thoroughly documented dictionary of the Old Spanish language in existence today. In addition, he played a key role in promoting and expanding the study of Portuguese in the United States. Early life Kasten was born in 1905 in Watertown, Wisconsin, where his first language was German. In 1926 he received his bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin in economics (or \\"commerce\\"), but he was already interested in languages, and he continued his studies at Wisconsin for a master's degree in Spanish (1927). After teaching Spanish for a year at the University of Florida, he studied at Spain's Centro de Estudios Hist√≥ricos, where his teachers included Samuel Gili Gaya, Pedro Salinas, and D√°maso Alonso, and among his classmates were Rafael Lapesa, Am√©rico Castro, and Amado Alonso. He then returned to Wisconsin to pursue a doctorate in the language, which he achieved in 1931. His dissertation,\\"Secreto de los secretos, Translated by Juan Fern√°ndez de Heredia: An Edition of the Unique Aragonese Manuscript with Literary Introduction and Glossary\\". under the mentorship of Antonio Garc√≠a Solalinde, was an edition, glossary, and literary study of a 14th-century Aragonese manuscript of the pseudo-Aristotelian Secretum Secretorum. Career Kasten worked with Antonio Solalinde in the Seminary of Medieval Spanish Studies, a research institute founded by Solalinde at the University of Wisconsin in 1931, and in 1937‚Äîafter Solalinde's death at the age of 45‚ÄîKasten assumed the directorship of the Seminary, a role which would last more than 60 years. Prominent among the institute's projects, in addition to the editing of medieval manuscripts, was the compilation of dictionaries: of Old Spanish generally,The Tentative Dictionary of Old Spanish (1946) and its greatly expanded (but still modestly titled) second edition, the Tentative Dictionary of Medieval Spanish (2001) and of the vocabulary of the works of Alfonso el Sabio in particular.Diccionario de la prosa castellana del Rey Alfonso X Beginning in the 1970s, and in collaboration with John J. Nitti, he began to enlist the aid of computers to manage the lexical data. In that period also the Seminary began to produce hardbound publications of its editions, under the slightly reconfigured name of Hispanic Seminary of Medieval Studies. His de jure retirement from teaching in 1975 did not interrupt his research activity. The Hispanic Seminary, today located in New York City under the auspices of the Hispanic Society of America, continues its publishing activities and maintains a number of online data bases. Kasten's interest in Portuguese began in the early 1930s, during a research trip to Europe, when he spent several months in Portugal studying the language. After his return to Wisconsin, he promoted the expansion of Portuguese studies there, and eventually helped to develop a doctoral program in the language which \\"produced the first major wave of Portuguese professors for American universities\\". In addition‚Äîin collaboration with others‚Äîhe was instrumental in the founding and editing of the Luso-Brazilian Review, a scholarly journal for Portuguese studies. Early in his career, Kasten collaborated with Eduardo Neale-Silva to edit reading textbooks for learners of Spanish,Lecturas escogidas, Lecturas modernas, and Lecturas amenas. and later, with Claude Leroy, he would produce also a reader for students of Portuguese.Ver√≠ssimo's Gato pr√™to em campo de neve. Kasten's impact as a mentor in the formation of new \\"Hispanomedievalists\\" and others can be seen in the more than 60 doctoral dissertations he directed, including editions of medieval manuscripts and studies of medieval literature, historical linguistics, modern Spanish and Portuguese linguistics, and Luso-Brazilian literature.

K. Whitney & Co. store in Kirtland, Ohio. Gilbert was born at New Haven, Connecticut, to Eli Gilbert and Lydia Hemingway. He married Elizabeth Van Benthusen, September 30, 1823, in Chagrin (later Willoughby), Ohio. Gilbert moved to Mentor, Ohio, which was very close to Kirtland, around 1819, and took out a large loan, which he struggled to pay off until 1826. He moved to Kirtland, in 1826 and was a partner with Newel K. Whitney in the N. K. Whitney & Co. store by 1827. In 1831 he moved to Independence, Missouri, opened a store there, and was appointed bishop's agent. Latter Day Saint Gilbert was baptized into the Church of Christ in the spring of 1831 and church founder Joseph Smith ordained him an elder on June 6, 1831. He was ordained a high priest by Smith on April 26, 1832, in Kirtland and appointed one of seven high priests in the presiding high council in Missouri. He served as a missionary in the eastern United States from June to December 1832. Gilbert was appointed to start a store in Missouri in 1831, where Whitney and Company purchased land at a central intersection. Whitney probably sent money to help support the store.

History The Wolfe Music building was built in 1927 to house the Wolfe Music store, founded in 1917 by Harry Wolfe. The commercial building itself was owned and developed by Anthony Carlin. The building was designed by Walker and Weeks, arguably one of the most important architecture firms in Cleveland's history, and contracted to the Crowell and Little Construction Company. The structure was designed with the Wolfe Music store in mind, with adequate retail, showroom, and rehearsal space. The facade is white terracotta and Georgian white marble, with a bronze and glass storefront. The Wolfe Music building was built in a time when Euclid Avenue was transitioning from the residential Millionaire's Row to a street that was quickly becoming an up-and-coming showcase for arts, culture, and commerce. Euclid avenue featured department stores, art galleries, design studios, architecture firms, and varied upscale retail such as fur coat and jewelry stores. The buildings on this stretch of Euclid Avenue were designed to be landmark buildings that stood the test of time, well represented by the Trinity Cathedral and New Amsterdam Hotel which shared this stretch of Euclid Avenue with the Wolfe Music building. The Wolfe Music building gets its name from the eponymous Wolfe Music store, which moved into the ground floor retail space at the building's inception. The store was shuttered a short time later in 1930 and the building remained vacant until 1943 when it became home to the National Register Company operating in the building from 1943-1958. From 1958-1966 the Wolfe again sat vacant until the space was taken over by the Cooper School of Art, which would remain from 1968-1978. Most recently the building was leased to a Kinko's, until the structure was purchased in 1996 by Cleveland State University, with original plans for the building to be demolished to develop a bookstore on the lot. The building had not been in use since 1996. In late 2011, the building was nominated for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, and was reviewed for local landmark status by the City of Cleveland's Landmark Commission. As of August 2015, Google Earth views show that the building has been demolished and a new structure is being raised on the site.

Facts  The respondent, Johan Heinrich Arnold, had signed an agreement of sale for a motor vehicle which provided that \\"no warranty whatsoever has been or is given to me by the seller or his agent(s).\\" The agreement had been drawn up by the appellant, Gideon Andries van der Westhuizen, the seller. Arnold had been aware when he purchased the vehicle that it was in need of repair. The discussions between Arnold and Van der Westhuizen, prior to the conclusion of the contract, had related to the condition of the vehicle. Subsequent to Arnold's taking possession of the vehicle, a bank claimed ownership of it. To avoid the bank's claim, Arnold paid the bank the amount outstanding to it. He then claimed that amount from Van der Westhuizen, basing his claim on the implied warranty against eviction. Van der Westhuizen raised the exclusion clause in defence of the claim.  Judgment  On appeal, the court held (per Lewis AJA), that the surrounding circumstances‚Äîwhat passed between the parties, their negotiations and their conduct‚Äîdid not show that the words \\"no warranty whatsoever\\" had included the implied warranty against eviction. Although the phrase had to be regarded at first blush as a complete catch-all, saving the seller from any liability that might have arisen by operation of law, or by virtue of representations or warranties, it could not, given its generality, and the absence of any evidence that the question of title had been considered or in contemplation, have excluded the most fundamental obligation of the seller: to give undisturbed possession of the merx to the buyer. The only inference to be drawn from the circumstances was that Arnold had not intended or even contemplated that he might be deprived of possession by the true owner, and yet have no recourse to Van der Westhuizen. The evidence did not show that Van der Westhuizen had any such liability in mind either.Paras 34-35. In the circumstances, then, the provision in the document that Van der Westhuizen had given no warranties whatsoever did not exclude his liability for breach of the warranty against eviction. This did not mean that the words at issue were superfluous; they referred also to express warranties which would have related to the condition of the car.Para 36. The court held further that there did not appear to be any clear authority for a general principle that exemption clauses should be construed differently from other provisions in a contract. That did not mean, however, that courts were not, or should not be, wary of contractual exclusions, since they deprived parties of rights that they would otherwise have had at common law. In the absence of legislation regulating unfair contract terms, and where a provision did not offend public policy or considerations of good faith, a careful construction of the contract itself should ensure the protection of the party whose rights had been limited, but also give effect to the principle that the other party should be able to protect herself or himself against liability insofar as it was legally permissible. The very fact, however, that an exclusion clause limited or ousted common-law rights should make a court consider with great care the meaning of the clause, especially if it was very general in its application. This required a consideration of the background circumstances and a resort to surrounding circumstances if there was any doubt as to the application of the exclusion.Para 40. The court also held (per Marais JA), that the words \\"no warranty whatsoever has been or is given to me by the seller or his agent(s)\\" were of the widest connotation, but of critical importance were the words \\"has been or is given to me by the seller or his agent(s).\\" Their ordinary meaning was that Van der Westhuizen (or his agent(s)) neither gave nor had given any guarantees or warranties whatsoever. They were certainly apt to have excluded all expressly-given warranties, whatever their content. Although the word \\"whatsoever\\" would have covered warranties both expressly and tacitly given, a warranty which arose ex lege and owed nothing to the consensus of the parties was another matter altogether. It was not a warranty which was given (either expressly or tacitly) by the seller or his agent(s). The chosen words were not apt to exclude such a warranty. Plainer language than that which appellant had chosen would have been necessary to exclude effectively such a warranty.Para 43. The decision in the Cape Provincial Division, in Arnold v Van der Westhuizen, was thus confirmed.  References   Books  * Du Plessis, Jacques, et al. The Law of Contract in South Africa.

It is the sequel to Nelson Tethers: Puzzle Agent. It was released on June 30, 2011. Gameplay Like the first game, the game structure resembles a linear adventure game - the player doesn't have an inventory, but can traverse into dialog trees with other characters. Some items or choices of dialog result in puzzles to be solved, although in some cases the puzzle has no consequence in the game's progress. The types of puzzles vary from jigsaw through maths to logic puzzles. Each of them has a basic short description about the objective of the puzzle, while some have a basic set of rules and conditions that help the player deduce the solution. The player can request three hints for each puzzle, and each hint costs the player a piece of chewing gum - gum is on shortage in the town, as the hotel clerk explains, but Nelson can collect pieces of used gum he finds at each location. The puzzles don't automatically approve the players solution, even if the player provides the correct answer - Nelson must send the answer back to HQ where it is either approved or rejected. If the solution is approved, the player is given a score depending on how many hints he used and how many failed attempts he had (the latter is represented in taxpayer dollars), and an optional further explanation is provided on how the puzzle can be solved. Plot While on vacation, Tethers appears to be disturbed by the unresolved Scoggins case, noting that the FBI appears to be trying to cover it up. Deciding to go on an unofficial investigation, Tethers leaves his colleague and admirer Jim Ingraham to look after his files before heading back to Scoggins. Upon arrival, Tethers attempts to check in at Valda's Inn, the local hotel, but receives some hostility from Martha Garret, the owner, who attempts to push him into leaving. Tethers eventually manages to rent out a room, but experiences a dream at night in which he is visited by an astronaut, just like his dream before he first went to Scoggins, this time leaving a note on the floor. Also like the previous dream, Tethers wakes up to find that he was dreaming, but the note on the floor is still there, reading \\"Isaac Davner does not exist\\" on one side while having a puzzle on the other side. The puzzle consists of the names of a number of unknown people, arranged into a jumbled order, prompting Tethers to find out more about the names mentioned so that he can solve it. Outside the hotel, Tethers learns from Darryl Boutin, a resident previously seen in the Moose Ear Diner, that the names in the puzzle refer to past residents who have mysteriously disappeared into Sasimy Woods across the past several years, one of them being Darryl's brother, Darrel. Tethers travels to the local campsite, the Wallows, to meet with Alfred Versteckt, an anthropologist whose student, Will Medlock, is also mentioned in the puzzle. Alfred, who is not native to Scoggins and is therefore quickly deemed by Tethers as being \\"helpful\\", believes that the disappearances may be related to Scoggins' folklore, namely the Hidden People. Tethers next heads to the Moose Ear Diner to meet with Sheriff Bahg, and requests access to his files on the 'missing persons' cases, but Bahg, as hostile as ever, quickly denies him. However, Glori Davner, despite previously attempting to kill Tethers, offers to distract Bahg while Tethers breaks into his office if he will promise to find her husband, Isaac. Glori claims that Isaac was being \\"troubled\\" by something, and the Brotherhood of Scoggins, led by Bjorn, had offered to take him in and help him. However, they had then locked him away in the eraser factory and given him to the Hidden People, simply telling Glori that he had been \\"chosen\\" when she questioned them. As there has been no news on Isaac's whereabouts since he was stolen away into the woods after Tethers found him, Glori has become distrustful of the Brotherhood, now believing that they are behind the many disappearances. Tethers sneaks into Bahg's office and is able to retrieve the Missing Persons files, despite being caught in the act by Bahg. Using the files, Tethers is able to complete the puzzle on the note, which then leads him to Melkorka Teterdottir, or 'Korka' for short, a puzzle- obsessed woman not unlike himself. Korka explains that she had posted the note under his door at night in an attempt to summon him, as she wishes to partner with him to solve the case. Korka herself has made a remarkable discovery concerning Isaac: his true identity is Ed Davis, a test pilot who had apparently been killed after his craft crashed into Sasimy Woods. Korka believes that the alias of Davner was forged so that Ed Davis could be declared dead, but he is actually residing in the woods as a serial killer, and is therefore responsible for the disappearances. Having become obsessed with taking down Isaac after her lover, Halldor Magnusson, had disappeared many years ago, Korka has devoted her recent years to tracking him, and now wishes to use Tethers to hunt him. Korka sends Tethers out into Sasimy Woods to find Isaac. In the woods, Tethers finds no sign of Isaac but instead finds Edvard, a member of the Brotherhood, sneaking around. Tethers follows him through the woods, but loses him and tumbles down a slope. Beneath a tree at the base of the slope, Tethers discovers the crumpled body of an astronaut, but before he can look closer, a group of Hidden People spook him and he flees, eventually ending up back at Korka's house. However, Korka quickly dismisses his findings as nonsense, believing that the Hidden People are nothing more than an urban myth. With no other leads, Tethers heads to the Brotherhood lodge to directly interrogate Bjorn, but finds that he too appears to be troubled by the disappearances, and is innocent. Bjorn reveals that the Brotherhood itself has been shrinking as its members have been vanishing into Sasimy Woods. Edvard, who Tethers had seen in the woods, had been searching for Skjoldr, another Brotherhood member who had gone missing not long ago. Bjorn also states that the Hidden People have been \\"angered\\" by something nearby, which may have something to do with their \\"choosing\\" of Isaac. Begging Tethers to find the missing people and restore the Brotherhood, Bjorn directs Tethers to the cabin of Olav Welhaven, another past member who was one of Bjorn's best friends. Tethers reaches Olav's cabin and finds that the man was a dedicated astropsychologist who had invented a complex formula linking lunacy to the phases of the Moon, most notably lunar eclipses. A set of tape recordings reveal that Olav had sent his research to NASA. Tethers realises that Olav's game-changing discovery, as well as his contact with NASA, must play an important role in the mysteries surrounding Scoggins, such as the astronaut body and the Hidden People, and revisits Korka to show her his findings. However, Korka is revealed to be an obsessive lunatic when Tethers discovers that she believes that the entire mystery revolves around the 'Kitimat Incident' - the rumoured discovery of a Sasquatch in Sasimy Woods. Believing that Alfred is the only competent person in Scoggins, Tethers returns to the Wallows to show him his findings. Alfred appears to be amazed by Olav's research, noting that when placed besides his own research into the Hidden People, it will pinpoint the creatures' home. Alfred accompanies Tethers into the woods to look for the Hidden People, but before long he disappears; Tethers searches for him and stumbles across a campsite in a large clearing. The campsite appears to have been built around a crashed lunar lander, branded as the 'Hermes II', and is occupied by a pair of astronauts. Tethers spots the remains of a skier nearby, but before he can react, the astronauts grab hold of him and sedate him. Tethers wakes up once again in Valda's Inn, but learns from a call from Ingraham that the FBI has discovered Tethers' findings involving the body of the astronaut, and a task force of Men in Black are en route to Scoggins. Tethers confronts FBI Director Jennings in the Moose Ear Diner and voices his concern that the astronauts in the woods have been murdering people, and are responsible for the disappearances, but Jennings simply warns him to back away from the case and leave Scoggins before he learns too much. Refusing to abandon the case, Tethers returns to the astronaut's body he discovered in the woods and finds that it is not really a body, but an empty suit. To his surprise, Isaac Davner appears behind him and reveals that the suit belonged to him. Isaac explains that, previously known as Ed Davis, he was in the team of astronauts who were sent to the Moon on the Hermes II mission, a secret operation in response to Olav Welhaven's research in which the team were ordered to plant a device called the 'Lunar Ray' on the surface. However, the mission had gone awry; a lunar eclipse had occurred before the team had reached the surface, causing the two astronauts on the outside of the craft to instantly go insane. With the Lunar Ray still attached to the lander, Isaac had piloted the craft back towards Earth, where it crashed into Sasimy Woods - directly on top of the Hidden People's home. The Lunar Ray had formed a barrier around the area which repelled the Hidden People, forcing them out of their habitat. Isaac had fled the crash site upon impact, running from the two insane astronauts, and had created the new identity of Isaac Davner in an attempt to forget the mission and start a new life. From there, he had settled down with Glori and begun a peaceful career as the eraser factory foreman, but the astronauts continued to haunt him in his dreams so he went to Bjorn for help. The Hidden People, who were aware that Isaac had been involved in the Hermes II mission, had \\"chosen\\" him so that Bjorn would hand him over, and they had whispered to him in an attempt to brainwash him into destroying the Ray. When Tethers had found him in the factory, and he had been dragged away into the woods, the Hidden People had actually taken him back to the lander, but he had been unable to stop the Ray and had fled back into the woods, where he has been hiding ever since. Now understanding that the Hidden People are simply being disturbed by the Ray, Tethers agrees to assist Isaac in destroying it. The two head to the lander, but find that the Men in Black have got there first, although the insane astronauts have been apprehended. The agents take the pair back to the town, returning Tethers to Valda's Inn while presumably reuniting Isaac with Glori. Tethers receives another phone call from Ingraham, who has been studying Tethers' many recordings throughout his two visits to Scoggins. Ingraham points out that there is a strange melody in the background of Olav Welhaven's recording. Realising that Olav must have had direct contact with the Hidden People in order to reach his bizarre conclusion, Tethers deduces that the melody was used to summon the Hidden People to the cabin. Tethers heads back to the cabin and replays the recording, causing a large crowd of Hidden People to enter, one of them climbing onto a stool and whispering into Tethers' ear. As a result of the whispers, Tethers experiences a strange illusion in which he contacts the Hidden People in space, apparently agreeing to assist them in destroying the Ray. When he snaps back into consciousness, he is already at the lander in his underwear, surrounded by agents. Tethers is able to sabotage the Ray, but it goes haywire and begins to zap the agents, turning them insane, Tethers is also hit by the ray and he goes insane as well. He then rushes away from the lander with the Ray, moving the barrier blocking the Hidden People away from the campsite and allowing them to return home. Tethers carries the Ray to Lake Svenz and attempts to throw it into the water, but the thick layer of ice on the surface prevents it from falling through. However, the Sasquatch which Korka had theorised about suddenly emerges from the trees near the lake and splits the ice, sinking the Ray to the bottom and finally ending its reign of lunacy over Scoggins. Despite going against his orders from Director Jennings, Tethers is allowed to return to the FBI, although Ingraham is relocated as he had assisted Tethers despite still being on shifts. Tethers receives a postcard from Isaac and Glori, who have happily reunited and are on vacation in Bermuda. The game ends as Tethers questions their safety, clearly concerned about the Bermuda Triangle.

Because of this, tuition rates had to be raised, causing fewer families to be able to afford the cost. Being in the decision process for years, the list was finalized by the Blue Ribbon Commission on January 6, 2012 at around 11:00 AM. The schools were informed soon afterward, and they were all officially announced during the press conference at 4:00 PM.  History  In December 2010, the Blue Ribbon Commission was created by Cardinal Justin Rigali to address the enrollment and financial issues. The enrollment had a 35% drop since the year 2001, and it was decided to close some schools so that the property could be sold and the profit used to help the archdiocese. Archbishop Charles Chaput became head of the archdiocese in September 2011 and pledged full support to the Blue Ribbon Commission. Rumors soon started spreading about what would become of different schools. Archbishop John Carroll High School, which turned out not being on the recommendation list, had strong rumors of it closing so that Monsignor Bonner High School and Archbishop Prendergast High School could officially merge, making a fair count of one high school closing in Delaware County. Suspense built up during the week of the announcement date, making every Archdiocesan school nervous about what would happen. On Friday, January 6 at 10:00 AM, all presidents, principals, and pastors of the Archdiocesan schools reported at Neumann University to hear of what would become of their respective schools. At 12:00 PM, assemblies were held to tell the students and faculty whether their school would close or stay open. All high schools were to be dismissed at 1:00 PM. A press conference was held at 4:00 PM that day by the Blue Ribbon Commission to officially announce which schools were closing. All closing schools completed the 2011‚Äì2012 school year and officially closed in June.  List of school closings  The following is a list of the schools that will be closing at the end of the 2011-2012 school year.  Elementary schools  There is a total of 44 out of the 156 elementary schools in the archdiocese that will close. Seven schools in Delaware County were leaked before the official announcement. The rest will be announced during the press conference at 4:00 PM. = Delaware County = * Annunciation BVM, Haverford * Holy Savior-St. John Fisher, Lower Chichester * Our Lady of Fatima, Secane * St. Cyril of Alexandria, East Lansdowne * St. Francis de Sales, Aston * St. Gabriel, Norwood * St. John Chrysostom  High schools  5 of the 17 high schools in the archdiocese will also be closing. They were all announced early in the day on January 6. No schools were closed in the counties of Montgomery or Chester. * Archbishop Prendergast High School, Delaware * Conwell-Egan Catholic High School, Bucks * Monsignor Bonner High School, Delaware * St. Hubert Catholic High School for Girls, Philadelphia * West Catholic Preparatory High School, Philadelphia  Reactions  The week after the students returned from Christmas break, from Tuesday, January 3 up to the announcements at 4:00 PM on Friday, was reportedly the most suspenseful. Many teachers, students, and parents criticized the long wait and were hoping that leaks would reveal the information early. The closing of West Catholic High School came as such a shock that the term \\"West Catholic\\" was trending on Twitter after the announcement.  Conwell-Egan High School  Teachers who were told of the announcement before the students arrived at the assemblies around 12:00 PM \\"red from crying.\\" Interviewed students of closing schools were overwhelmingly upset about the results, while students from on-the-fence schools were relieved. After the closing schools let out at 1:00 PM, many of the students were shown on news stations hugging each other and crying.  Monsignor Bonner and Archbishop Prendergast High Schools  Students and staff of these schools reportedly shared similar reactions to those of Conwell-Egan. Several students reported on how sad the situation was, and photos were released of students hugging and crying on the campus.

Life In 1657 he left for Batavia, after a training in the Dutch States Army, together with Hendrik van Rheede and Johan Bax van Herentals, who was appointed as governor of the Cape Colony. Till 1672 he was stationed on Ceylon and the Dutch Malabar. He served under Admiral Rijcklof van Goens in campaigns against the Portuguese on the west coast of India.Heniger, J. (1986) Hendrik Adriaan van Reede tot Drakenstein (1636--1691) and Hortus Malabaricus -- A contribution to the history of Dutch colonial botany, p. 9. He was then appointed in Batavia because of the Franco-Dutch War. Lostal fought against the sultans in Mataram (Java), Ternate and Bantam and seems to have been a skillful soldier. His adventures were used in a playwright by Onno Zwier van Haren.Information on the playwright in French on Persee Lostal lived in Utrecht from 1683 with his comagnon Hendrik van Rheede, a naturalist. Like Van Rheede Lostal was interested in botany and a friend of Joan Huydecoper, an Amsterdam burgomaster and one of the managers of the Dutch East India Company. In 1684 he sailed again to Batavia. During his stay at Cape of Good Hope he made a trip to the north. Together with Simon van der Stel he searched for medical or economical plants (1685). A valley north of Piketberg is named after Lostal.Port Nolloth: The Making of a South African Seaport By Patrick Carstens The area is now known for fruits and rooibos. When he arrived in the East he took seat as a member of the Council of India. Lostal owned three microscopes and was helping the blind Rumphius, a German botanist on Ambon Island, to get his books written and published. Lostal ordered Engelbert Kaempfer to do research on the components of Japanese rice paper. When Lostal died in 1696 the inheritance went to his brother Gratian in Oloron, who was probably a lawyer in the Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques. He received 1200 books in many languages, like Hebrew, Arab, Persian and Portuguese, including Malay. Lostal was one of the first who collected such books in the Malay language. His mansion and garden in Kemayoran with a Japanese pavillon was sold to Joan van Hoorn, as foreigners (c.q. his brother) were not allowed to own property on Java.

After 2007, it became a brand, originally owned by the private equity firm Sun Capital Partners, now owned by another private equity firm Sycamore Partners. In January 2017 The Limited shut down all of its 250 stores, laid off 4,000 workers and filed for bankruptcy. History Bella Cabakoff was born in Williamsburg, Brooklyn and moved to Columbus, Ohio as a toddler.Wexner obituary in the New York Times At 21, she became the youngest buyer for the Lazarus department store chain. In 1951, after spending over 20 years with Lazarus, she and her husband Harry Wexner opened a women's clothing store named Leslie's (after their son) on State Street. This store became the training ground for Leslie Wexner. In 1963, he borrowed $5,000 from his aunt and $5,000 from the bank and opened a store at the Kingsdale Shopping Center in Upper Arlington. This store was named \\"The Limited\\" because the store focused on clothing for younger women, unlike his parents' general merchandise store. Later in 1964, Bella and Harry closed their store to join their son in his venture. The original board consisted of only the three family members and longtime friend of Harry and Bella, Jim Waldron (who served as senior vice president): Bella Wexner (who served as secretary until her death in 2001), Harry as chairman (who served until his death in 1975), and Leslie, who succeeded his father as the chairman and later became CEO. He and his family continue to control 17% of LTD. In 1969, Wexner took Limited Brands public, listed as LTD on the NYSE. In 1977, The Limited moved into its main headquarters on Morse Road in Columbus. In 2009, most headquarters operations moved to New Albany, Ohio. The 1980s started a string of acquisitions: In 1982, the Victoria's Secret brand, store, and catalogue were purchased from Roy Raymond for $1 million. Also in 1982, 207 Lane Bryant stores were purchased. In 1985, the exclusive Henri Bendel store on Fifth Avenue in New York City was purchased for $10 million and 798 Lerner stores for $297 million. Finally, in 1988, 25 Abercrombie & Fitch stores were purchased for $46 million. The Limited then ended its ownership of the A&F; brand in 1996, when it was spun off into a publicly traded company. In 1980, Limited founded Limited Express, later known simply as Express. The 1990s included the initial development of the Limited Too (which was renamed Justice in 2008), Bath & Body Works, Structure, and Victoria's Secret Beauty. Galyan's, a sporting goods store, was also purchased. Later in 1998, several Bath & Body Works stores were converted to The White Barn Candle Company stores to begin a home fragrance brand. On August 3, 2007, Limited Brands transferred 75% ownership of its flagship Limited chain to buyout firm Sun Capital Partners Inc. In 2010, the remaining shares were sold to Sun Capital Partners Inc. In 2013, Diane Ellis, president and chief operating officer of Brooks Brothers, became the CEO of The Limited. In October 2016, she then left The Limited to join Chico's leaving CFO John Buell to serve as interim CEO. At the end of 2016, The Limited laid off a significant portion of its corporate workforce and women's fashion brand Altar'd State announced John Buell would be joining their team as CFO. As of the end of 2016, The Limited stores began selling inventory at significant discounts, with some news outlets reporting financial troubles for the chain. In January 2017, The Limited announced that it would be closing all 250 of its stores, cutting 4,000 jobs. At the time of this announcement, the company said it would continue to sell apparel online. On January 17, The Limited announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In February 2017, the brand was purchased by Sycamore Partners. Belk, Inc., a Southern department store in the Sycamore portfolio, became the exclusive distributor for The Limited in September 2017.

They both fled, allowing Zhu to absorb their territory.  Background and service under Zhao Kuangning  It is not known when Zhao Kuangming was born. His father Zhao Deyin had been a general under Qin Zongquan, who was a Tang military governor of Fengguo Circuit (Â•âÂúã, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan) but who later submitted to the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao and Huang's state of Qi, and, after Huang's defeat, had declared himself emperor of a new state. As part of Zhao Deyin's service under Qin, he captured Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, the later Zhongyi Circuit). Later, knowing that Qin was on the verge of defeat, he submitted to Tang and allied himself with Zhu Quanzhong the Tang military governor of Xuanwu Circuit. At Zhu's recommendation, Zhao Deyin was allowed to remain as military governor of the circuit, which was then renamed Zhongyi. He later participated in the campaigns that led to Qin's destruction.New Book of Tang, vol. 186. Zhao Kuangming, as a son of Zhao Deyin's, was given the title of literary officer at Jiangling Municipality (Ê±üÈôµ, Jingnan's capital) even in his youth. After he reached adulthood, he had military accomplishments and served successively as the prefect of Xiu (Áπ°Â∑û, in modern Guigang, Guangxi) and Xia (Â≥ΩÂ∑û, in modern Yichang, Hubei) Prefectures.History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 17. In 892, Zhao Deyin died.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. Zhao Kuangming's older brother Zhao Kuangning claimed the title of acting military governor of Zhongyi, and was later confirmed by then-ruling Emperor Zhaozong as full military governor. At one point, the major warlord Zhu Quanzhong, who had designs on seizing the Tang throne, was rebuffed by Zhao Kuangning when he inquired of Zhao Kuangning's thoughts on the matter. He was angered and sent an army to attack Zhongyi Circuit, but his army was defeated by Zhao Kuangming at Deng Prefecture (ÈÑßÂ∑û, in modern Nanyang, Henan). Thereafter, under the advice of Zhao Kuangming, Zhao Kuangning entered into an alliance with Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan).The New Book of Tang dated this battle to 904 and also indicated that it was before Zhao Kuangming's taking control of Jingnan Circuit; however, since it is clear that Zhao Kuangming took over Jingnan in 903, the dating of 904 would clearly be erroneous.  As ruler of Jingnan  In 903, Zhu Quanzhong's ally Cheng Rui the military governor of Jingnan, attempting to save another ally of Zhu's, Du Hong the military governor of Wuchang Circuit (Ê≠¶Êòå, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei), was defeated in battle by Li Shenfu, a general under Yang Xingmi the military governor of Huainan Circuit (Ê∑ÆÂçó, headquartered in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). After Cheng's death, Jiangling was temporarily taken over by the army of Wuzhen Circuit (Ê≠¶Ë≤û, headquartered in modern Changde, Hunan), but Zhao Kuangning sent an army to expel the Wuzhen army, and then commissioned Zhao Kuangming as its acting military governor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. Emperor Zhaozong (who was by this point under Zhu's physical control) initially commissioned Zhao Kuangming only as the commander of the Jingnan army (Ë°åËªçÂè∏È¶¨, Xingjun Sima) but gave him the honorary title of acting Situ (Âè∏Âæí, one of the Three Excellencies) as well. It was said that at that time, very few warlords were willing to offer tributes to the emperor, but the Zhao brothers regularly did so. By 905, Zhao Kuangming was referred to as full military governor of Jingnan. That year, Zhu, angry that Zhao Kuangning was in alliance with both Wang Jian and Yang, attacked Zhongyi along with his general Yang Shihou. They defeated the Zhongyi army, and Zhao Kuangning abandoned Zhongyi and fled to Huainan territory.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 265. Believing that he could not stand by himself, Zhao Kuangming also planned to flee to Huainan. His son Zhao Chenggui () pointed out that if he fled to Huainan as well, Yang might suspect him and Zhao Kuangning given the cumulative strengths of the two brothers in Huainan territory. Zhao Kuangming agreed, and fled to Xichuan instead. Wang Jian treated him as an honored guest and commissioned him as the military governor of Wuxin Circuit (Ê≠¶‰ø°, headquartered in modern Suining, Sichuan). Later, after Wang Jian founded Former Shu as its emperor, he made Zhao Kuangming the chief judge of the supreme court (Â§ßÁêÜÂçø, Dali Qing) and the minister of public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Gongbu Shangshu). Zhao Kuangming eventually died at the Former Shu capital Chengdu, but the year is not known.

The original services were held outdoors along Beaver Creek. A year earlier, Rev. Conrad Pluenneke had also come to the area to minister to local settlers. In absence of a structure, these ministers were circuit rider pastors. In 1859, August Engel became an additional circuit rider for the congregations. The area Methodists gradually began forming an area organization and drew up a charter. The first parsonage was built in 1861.

While he is best known as the creator and frontman of the internationally-known \\"Rockgrass\\" band Hayseed Dixie, Wheeler also performs solo and has produced and performed on albums by many other artists. He is the 2nd cousin of bluegrass music pioneer, Lester Flatt. An avid motorcycle enthusiast, Wheeler has ridden a motorcycle on every tour since 2006, logging over 200,000 miles (320,000 kilometers) across Europe and the United States. Biography Early life Wheeler was born January 7, 1970 in Nashville, Tennessee, the only child of a carpenter and agronomist. Almost entirely self- taught on his instruments, he began playing the piano at the age of 3. His father, having seen him spend hours using a tennis racquet as a pretend guitar, got him an inexpensive Fender acoustic guitar at the age of 7, and he spent much of his childhood teaching himself by playing along to records on his mother's vinyl record player. From 1987 -1995 he studied philosophy and history at universities in Tennessee and Wisconsin, paying his way through by playing in several bands which performed on the college music and fraternity party circuits of the time. Career Following university, Wheeler returned to Nashville, where he toured the United States as a backing musician playing guitar and fiddle and singing harmony for several touring acts. In 1996, he also set up his own recording studio in Nashville where he recorded demos and independent albums for numerous songwriters and bands as well as his own increasingly experimental recording projects. In the summer of 2000, Wheeler had the idea ‚Äì \\"just for something fun,\\" he has said ‚Äì to record an album of AC/DC songs played in a pseudo-bluegrass style. Singing lead and playing fiddle, mandolin and guitar, Wheeler recorded an album originally titled AC/Dixie along with local Nashville bassist Kurt Carrick, dobro player Mike Daly and guitarist Rusty Horn. The unexpected commercial success of this recording on local radio led to a record deal with Nashville-based Dualtone Records, who released the album nationally on April 17, 2001, and to Wheeler forming the band, Hayseed Dixie, in order to perform the project live. The success of the 2001 Hayseed Dixie U.S. tour and the album, which sold over 100,000 copies in the United States in its first year of release, led to Wheeler continuing with the Hayseed Dixie project through 2018, producing 15 further Hayseed Dixie recordings which have collectively sold over 800,000 copies worldwide and to more than 1,500 live performances in 31 different countries. In March 2003, the band had the unique distinction of having 3 different albums in the Top 15 of the bluegrass category of the US Billboard charts at the same time, Wheeler is also the songwriter for the majority of Hayseed Dixie's original songs, including the cult hits, \\"I'm Keeping Your Poop (In a Jar)\\" and \\"She Was Skinny When I Met Her.\\" Currently residing in Cambridge in the UK, Wheeler has recently appeared as a special guest on BBC Radio 2 programs, including the Chris Evans Breakfast Show and Simon Mayo Drivetime.

Directed by Josh Shelov, the film stars Neil Patrick Harris and Bonnie Somerville as Jeff and Sam respectively, a young couple that moves into New York City. The film centers around the effort they have to put in to get their five-year-old daughter Beatrice (Amelia Talbot) into an elite private kindergarten. This is director Josh Shelov's debut feature-film, co-written with Michael Jaeger. The film received mostly mixed to positive reviews. Plot The film opens with Jeff (Neil Patrick Harris) and Sam (Bonnie Somerville) moving from Delaware into New York City with their five-year-old daughter Beatrice. Sam takes Beatrice on visit to several schools in the city to get Beatrice admitted for the current session, only to realize that there is very little prospect in such short period. After losing hope, she enlists help of Sue Lemon (Amy Sedaris), a consultant who helps couples in getting their kids admitted into schools. Though first Sue declines to help them for citing short notice, later she agrees after seeing Sam's stubborn determination. Sue asks Jeff, who is a software programmer, to mention poetry as his profession. Jeff initially declines, however, Sam convinces him. On the day of first interview, Jeff and Sam asks Clark (Peter Serafinowicz), Jeff's college mate, to baby-sit Beatrice and leave her with him. During the visit, Clark shares a copy of sex chat he had with a prostitute with Jeff. Later at school, the couple is interviewed by Katharine Heilmann (Jenna Stern) who mistakes Clark's sex chat print copy for a poem written by Jeff and is visibly impressed. However, a freak incident involving Clark makes her decline Jeff and Sam's application. Upon failing to impress Katharine, Sam and Sue decide and plan to befriend The Player (Christopher McDonald), a rich guy who is also chairman of school committee. Thus begins a series of comic plays and lies that the couple has to go through to get approval of The Player, The Player's wife (Kate Mulgrew), and Katharine. By the end of the movie, Sam is forced to choose between living the life she has dreamed of ‚Äì but lying in order to do so ‚Äì or going back to Delaware as herself.

Music Atlanta has played a major or contributing role in the development of various genres of American music at different points in the city's history. Beginning as early as the 1920s, Atlanta emerged as a center for country music, which was brought to the city by migrants from Appalachia. During the countercultural 1960s, Atlanta hosted the Atlanta International Pop Festival, with the 1969 festival taking place more than a month before Woodstock and featuring many of the same bands. The city was also a center for Southern rock during its 1970s heyday: the Allman Brothers Band's hit instrumental \\"Hot 'Lanta\\" is an ode to the city, while Lynyrd Skynyrd's famous live rendition of \\"Free Bird\\" was recorded at the Fox Theatre in 1976, with lead singer Ronnie Van Zant directing the band to \\"play it pretty for Atlanta.\\"\\"Rock's Top Southern Sound Viewed as Lynyrd Skynyrd\\" The Robesonian, 1976-11-07. During the 1980s, Atlanta had an active Punk rock scene that was centered on two of the city‚Äôs music venues, 688 Club and the Metroplex, and Atlanta famously played host to the Sex Pistols first U.S. show, which was performed at the Great Southeastern Music Hall., \\"Atlanta punk!

Though in October 2011 the police arrested 7 persons designated as vandals, city officials assert that they have no intention of stifling the street art scene. The city's Office of Cultural Affairs selected 29 standout murals to avoid whitewashing including murals commissioned as part of the BeltLine, works created during the Living Walls conferences, but not the most famous street art space in the city, the Krog Street Tunnel.

Formerly the estate of Harry Lynde Bradley and Margaret (Peg ) Blakney Bradley, Lynden is home to the collection of more than 50 monumental sculptures collected by Margaret Bradley between 1962 and 1978. The collection features works by Alexander Archipenko, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Clement Meadmore, Marta Pan, Tony Smith, Mark di Suvero and others sited across 40 acres of park, lake and woodland. History The Lynden Sculpture Garden was the estate of the late Harry Lynde Bradley and Margaret (Peg) Blakney Bradley.Popp, S. (2010, May 23). Lynden Sculpture Garden in River Hills will open to the public on May 30. The Sunday Post, p. 16-18 Harry Bradley, an inventor and industrialist, founded the Allen-Bradley Company with his brother Lynde in 1904, building it into one of the state‚Äôs most successful manufacturing concerns. Harry married Peg in April 1926, and in 1928, they purchased property about 10 miles north of downtown Milwaukee and named it \\"Lynden.\\"Dunigan, P.S. (2010, May 27) The Lynden Sculpture Garden reveals the art of Harry and Peg Bradley. The Shepherd Express. The Bradleys took the nearly 40 acres of flat farmland and, with the help of Chicago landscape architects Langford & Moreau, created an English country park with gently rolling hills, trees and flower beds. The lake and the rustic bridge spanning the water were designed to match Harry Bradley‚Äôs memories of the municipal grounds in Kansas City where he swam as a boy. In April 1934 the Bradleys hired Carl Urban, a fourth generation gardener, to supervise the crew and the planting of the garden beds and trees. Trained in Germany and the United States, Urban observed that when he first saw the acreage behind the house it consisted mainly of corn fields with horses, sheep, goats and 13 oak trees. Over time, nearly 4,000 trees were planted on the property‚Äîseveral varieties of elms as well as Norwegian, Austrian and Scotch pines, Norway maples, a Danish plum tree, seven varieties of birch trees and Kentucky coffee trees. Urban remained on the staff and resided in the apartment in the barn until his death in 1991. Further plans to construct a botanical garden on the site were derailed by the outbreak of World War II. In 1962, Peg Bradley‚Äîalready an experienced art collector‚Äîbegan collecting the contemporary monumental sculptures that secured Lynden‚Äôs international reputation. She collected actively until her death in 1978. The collection includes sculptures by Alexander Archipenko, Henry Moore, Barbara Hepworth, Clement Meadmore, Marta Pan, Tony Smith, Mark di Suvero and many others. After the works had been purchased, Peg would sit on her porch to direct the location of wood models constructed by the staff as she chose sites for the sculptures. Some of the artists travelled to Lynden to assist with the siting and to assemble their work. The original farmhouse, built in the 1860s, was enlarged to accommodate Harry, Peg and their daughter Jane. Local architect Fitzhugh Scott provided drawings for the alterations to the barn, the bathhouse, and a diving pier and slide. Several decades later architect David Kahler designed an addition at the west end of the house for an indoor swimming pool, providing more space for the Bradleys‚Äô growing art collection. Opening to the public In 2009 the board of the Bradley Family Foundation elected to open Lynden to the public. This required an extensive renovation of the house and some of the grounds. The house has been transformed by Uihlein-Wilson Architects using sustainable building practices. The newly created public spaces include a conference room, a large classroom/studio, a gallery and a glassed-in function space overlooking the large patio.Ford, J. (2006, January 26).

Spanish Civil War and exile During the Spanish Civil War he supported the Republicans, though in a non-combatant role for fear of killing one of his six brothers, who were all on Franco's side. At the end of the war he went into exile in England, aided by a Labour MP. In England he worked in a refugee camp for evacuated Spanish children, where he met his wife Cora (n√©e Blyth). Later on he worked in news media as a translator and editor. He also published poetry. In 1972, he became chief of the London Diplomatic Office of the Spanish Republican government in exile. On 23 June 1977, 40 years after being dismissed and nearly two years after Franco's death he was politically rehabilitated as a university professor. In 1977, he was one of the founders of the new Republican Left, a Spanish party which took its name from Manuel Aza√±a's party of the same name which had been previously dissolved in 1959. He had five sons including Michael Portillo, who is a British journalist, broadcaster, former Conservative Party politician and Cabinet Minister.\\"Spanish civil war speech invented by father of Michael Portillo, says historian\\", The Guardian, 11 May 2018 References * √Ångel Luis Portillo (Ed.), Ruise√±or del destierro: poes√≠as de Luis Gabriel Portillo, Barcelona, Anthropos, 1989, External links * Biography 1907 births 1993 deaths Exiles of the Spanish Civil War in the United Kingdom People from the Province of √Åvila Spanish emigrants to the United Kingdom Spanish politicians University of Salamanca faculty University of Salamanca alumni ","title":"Luis Gabriel Portillo"},{"id":"34300445","text":"Tec de Monterrey, Mexico City Learning commons, also known as scholars' commons, information commons or digital commons, are learning spaces, similar to libraries and classrooms that share space for information technology, remote or online education, tutoring, collaboration, content creation, meetings, socialization, playing games and studying. Learning commons are increasingly popular in academic and research libraries, and some public and school libraries have now adopted the model. Architecture, furnishings and physical organization are particularly important to the character of a learning commons, as spaces are often designed to be rearranged by users according to their needs. Learning commons may also have tools, equipment, makerspaces, and/or publishing services available for borrowing or use. Along with the so-called \\"bookstore model,\\" which is focused on customer service, bookless or digital libraries, the learning commons or digital commons is frequently cited as a model for the \\"library of the future.\\" History and Development Students learning to work with Wikipedia at the learning commons of Tec de Monterrey, Mexico City Learning Commons have developed across the United States and other countries in academic libraries since the early 1990s, when they were more frequently called Information Commons. Two early examples were the Information Arcade at the University of Iowa (1992) and the Information Commons at the University of Southern California (1994). By 1999, Donald Beagle had noted its emergence as \\"...a new model for service delivery in academic libraries,\\" and proposed that the model could be characterized by offering \\"a continuum of service\\" from information retrieval to original knowledge creation. This approach, often called \\"one-stop shopping,\\" could be facilitated, Beagle suggested, though the application of strategic alignment, a management approach adapted from IT enterprise planning. Increased use of the term Learning Commons had become apparent by 2004, when the University of Southern California hosted a national conference titled \\"Information Commons: Learning Space Beyond the Classroom.\\" Beagle's white paper for this conference proposed a developmental pathway \\"From Information Commons to Learning Commons,\\" based on a typology of change adapted from research by the American Council on Education. This white paper defined an Information Commons as a library-centric \\"...cluster of network access points and associated IT tools situated in the context of physical, digital, human, and social resources organized in support of learning.‚Äù A Learning Commons, by contrast, was no longer library-centric, as ‚Äú‚Ä¶when the resources of the information commons are organized in collaboration with learning initiatives sponsored by other academic units, or aligned with learning outcomes defined through a cooperative process.‚Äù These definitions were later adopted and elaborated upon by Scott Bennett, Yale University Librarian Emeritus. Since the late 1990s, hundreds of Learning Commons have developed and morphed in response to Web 2.0 technologies and the continuous evolution of libraries and librarians‚Äô functions. Web 2.0 technologies such as blogs, social networking sites, video sharing sites and web apps, have radically impacted the way that information is exchanged and engaged in. A learning commons takes these technologies into consideration and then adapts to provide the best possible services to the new 2.0 users and students. A driving force for the institution to place various services in the library are caused by two major reasons. The first reason is the reduction of space used to house print materials which are of little use to students and faculty compared to digital resources rapidly accessible through internet based services. The second reason for learning commons advances is the prime location on campus that most libraries have managed to secure. The library often frees up space through weeding of the print collections. A synergistic service can develop in support of students with other service departments. Why a Learning Commons Students appear to have natural abilities to use emerging technology. But the reality is, while students easily grasp the entertainment and communication value of the devices they use, they need to be taught how these tools can be used in learning and critical thought. This is a task for the Learning Commons. There is growing consensus among educators that students need to learn transferable skills in order to work efficiently and successfully in our future world.https://www.accessola.org/web/Documents/OLA/Divisions/OSLA/TogetherforLearning.pdf To achieve this, students will need to become critical consumers of information, effective problem solvers, capable decision makers and innovative communicators as well. They will require the skills and ability to flow with change. And most of all, students will need to understand that these transferable skills give them the capacity to make a difference in this world... personally. A Learning Commons provides boundless opportunity for growth. It is based on a cross-curricular perspective that recognizes literacy, numeracy, knowledge, thinking, communication, and application as foundations for learning how to learn. A Learning Commons becomes the physical and virtual catalyst where inquiry, imagination, discovery, and creativity come alive and become central to growth ‚Äî personal, academic, social and cultural. The Role of Differentiated Instruction An effective Learning Commons will accommodate all learners and address multiple learning styles and learning levels. In working together, teacher-librarians in partnership with others can modify the process, content, product and environment to meet the needs of a diverse student population. The result will be empowered learners. The learning commons model creates an ideal environment for the teacher librarian to utilize teaching methods that allow for both formal and informal learning to take place. Learning Commons, Student Services, and the Institution A learning commons allows for academic libraries to provide wider ranging and more cohesive services to students and users. Meshing numerous services maintains the traditional reference and research elements of the classic library while adding exciting new services that support new technologies and service in a larger and more integrated environment.Heitsch, Elizabeth K. & Holley, Robert P. (2011): The Information and Learning Commons: Some Reflections, New Review of Academic Librarianship, 17:1, 64-77 from library to learning commons: a metamorphosis The learning commons reflects a marked shift in our conception of the library, a shift that is driven by our evolving understanding of the library's role in supporting student learning. The emergence of the learning commons as a central element in contemporary library design offers an opportunity to transform the library's role on campus from a provider of information to a facilitator of learning.Holmgren, Richard A. (2010): Learning Commons: A Learning-Centered Library Design, College & Undergraduate Libraries, 17:2-3, 177-191 Often, libraries and learning commons share responsibility for delivering college-wide outcomes: developing effective research strategies, finding and evaluating the appropriateness of resource materials for a particular topic, honing effective oral and written communication skills, and promoting good study and learning habits. The goal of a Learning Commons Librarians‚Äô work should be to encourage all students to engage in substantive ways with multiple services in the organization. Properly implemented in an academic library, this model of library service benefits all parts of the institution. A cohesiveness and purpose among the diverse elements of the library allows both the library and the school to run more smoothly and efficiently and students‚Äô needs are met in an environment that is designed to provide multiple services in a single location. The Digital Divide and Learning Commons The Digital Divide is a very real problem in academic libraries currently and will remain so for the foreseeable future. This can be a problem in a highly technological library model but when the learning commons work efficiently, the needs of these students are provided for through library orientations, research/reference classes, technology courses, one-on-one assistance, effective and in-library peer assistance. These services should be developed online as well as in person for the maximum benefit of the student user and the school. Importance of Physical Space A dedicated learning commons space can enhance learning experiences New or renovated library space is now commonly repurposed to bring students together to work, study, and socialize. The learning commons typically offer comfortable furniture for both individual and group study, modular furnishings that allow users to customize the environment to suit their needs, access to wireless networks and electrical outlets, multimedia labs and support, and often a cafe accompanied by relaxed food and drink restrictions. The Learning Commons seeks to expand and integrate the real and virtual choices learners have to share their experiences. Safe, inclusive and welcoming environments throughout a school are imperative to meet the diverse abilities and learning styles of individuals, teams and groups. Virtual learning spaces increase this potential. Learning Commons promotes Inquiry Based Learning Through the process of inquiry, individuals construct much of their understanding of the natural and human-designed worlds. Inquiry implies a \\"need or want to know\\" premise. Inquiry is not so much seeking the right answer‚Äîbecause often there is none‚Äîbut rather seeking appropriate resolutions to questions and issues. For educators, inquiry implies emphasis on the development of inquiry skills and the nurturing of inquiring attitudes or habits of mind that will enable individuals to continue the quest for knowledge throughout life.http://www.thirteen.org/edonline/concept2class/inquiry/ Challenges to Learning Commons The challenge is discovering how to reconfigure our current spaces both inside and beyond a school and a school library's walls to reflect this new reality. Access to the technology that makes it possible, obviously, is critical. Role of the School Library The school library, a key component of a Learning Commons, has an integral and transformative role to play in implementing this fresh and innovative vision for education. Every member of a school's population will ultimately participate in the creation of a Learning Commons, but the concept's early coordination and leadership will rest with school library expertise. Where properly developed, a school's library is already the hub for networking and information access. As the Learning Commons‚Äô concept grows, a school library's collection-based facilities will continuously change and expand, creating access-based services suited to a school community's needs. This process will mean changes in the operations of a school's library. Resource collections will need to be reshaped even more rapidly and readily than they are currently to reflect their communities as well as the world at large. It is the only way a library's access to the global, interconnected and interactive communication networks of the future.  Learning Commons Transformative Model (LCTM)  Developed by Dr. Alexander Jones, the LCTM sets clear goals with specific criteria of importance to measure the correlation with teaching outcomes and use of space and technology. The LCTM model includes Knowledge Building, Collaborative Engagement, Integrative Learning, Fostering Literacy, Creativity and Expression, the Development of Positive Social Maturation, Efficient use of Space and Enhanced Teaching.

History  Foundation  It was founded in 1929 in close ties with the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The building of the school was designed by the great architect Dimitris Pikionis. It was established in 1934. Alexandros Delmouzos served as its first supervisor, and Vasilios Tatakis, a well known scientist, was the first Head of School. The school started functioning in a turbid political atmosphere and the beginning was difficult.ŒíŒ±œÅŒºŒ¨Œ∂Œ∑œÇ, Œù.

ŒúŒ±ŒªŒªŒπŒ¨œÅŒ∑œÇ Œ†Œ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµŒØŒ± The presence of Delmouzos to the school brought the principles of educational demoticism. This explains why they selected staff that had premium qualifications and supported the demotic language. Œës a working method Delmouzos suggested to his colleagues the method of school work of Dewey. The Decroly methods also became very popular to the first classes of the primary school.  Difficult Times  During the World War II, the school stopped operating while in the years of the Nazi occupation of Greece, it ran under very difficult circumstances. On the 20th of September 1941 Ioannis Xirotiris took office as school director of the PSPTH and remains the longest serving director of this school (1941-1962). During the difficult years of the Nazi Occupation and the Greek Civil War that followed, Xirotiris protected many faculty members from prosecution. During the Papadopoulos dictatorship, the direction of the school was assumed by Triantaphyllos Papatheodoridis. He was unfamiliar and indifferent to the ideas and values that the school represented, therefore his ideology and attitude suited the zeitgeist of his era. He took over in 1967 and in the three years that he remained in office, he tried to eradicate the traditions of the school. During the same period, some school graduates were accused by the military Junta and prosecuted to the court martial. Some of them, when they were summoned to testify in their defense, mentioned the Experimental School, showing how proud they were for their education there.

Atlanta's largest park, Southside Park, is remote and nearly undeveloped, and the planned Westside Park in northwest Atlanta, which will be constructed on the site of a former gravel quarry, will eclipse Southside as the city's largest. Also, Perkerson Park in Southwest Atlanta is home to the city's only permanent Disc Golf course. Atlanta's neighborhoods are dotted with hundreds of neighborhood parks such as John Howell Park in Virginia-Highland and Perkerson Park in the Capitol View/Sylvan Hills area. Freedom Park is Atlanta's largest passive park, with over 200 acres of linear greenspace going through Atlanta's historic east side neighborhoods. It was designated as Atlanta's Public Art Park by the Atlanta City Council in 2007. Nature preserves View northwards up the Chattahoochee River from Atlanta at the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area Several nature preserves line the south fork of Peachtree Creek in the Morningside neighborhood, including the Morningside Nature Preserve, while part of the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area lies in the city's northwest corner. Atlanta Botanical Garden Canopy Walk at Atlanta Botanical Garden The Atlanta Botanical Garden is home to the Canopy Walk, a 600-foot elevated walkway ambling 40 feet from the ground through a 15-acre forest of mature hardwoods, and the only canopy-level pathway of its kind in the United States. Trails BeltLine Historic Fourth Ward Park, 2012 The BeltLine, a former rail corridor that forms a 22-mile loop around Atlanta's central neighborhoods, has been acquired and transformed into public space. Most of the corridor opened in the late-2000s as a walking path, with plans for development of multi-use trails and, eventually, public transit. A trail has already been constructed near the West End neighborhood, while another one, under construction as of 2012, will connect Piedmont Park to Inman Park. BeltLine projects will increase Atlanta's park space by 40%, including two new parks: Historic Fourth Ward Park, now open, and Westside Park. PATH In addition to BeltLine trails, PATH maintains a network of biking and walking trails in Metro Atlanta, including one that traverses Atlanta's east side, traveling past the Carter Center and through Freedom Park. PATH400 will be a major addition to the PATH network through Buckhead. The Cheshire Farm Trail lines the South Fork of Peachtree Creek from Lindbergh Ave. to Cheshire Bridge Road, and Maiden Trail parallels Ponce de Leon Avenue in Virginia-Highland.

He is known for his work on arterial stiffness and the propagation of waves in elastic tubes. Life and family Adriaan Isebree Moens was the son of Jan Isebree Moens (1793‚Äì1865) and Susanna Cornelia De Kater (1805‚Äì1862).http://www.genealogieonline.nl/en/stambomen-quist/I21751.php He was born on November 15, 1846, in Zierikzee, Netherlands. He married Hermine Gertrude Constance Marie Kolff van Oosterwijk (1848‚Äì1878) in 1877 and after her death, Caroline Frederika Wilhelmina Kolff Van Oosterwijk (1854‚Äì1937) in 1880. He had three children, Gertrude Hermina Moens, Suzanna Cornelia Moens and Neeltje Isebree Moens. He died on 1891 after a chronic illness. Career In 1872 after completing a course in engineering at Ghent University, Moens began to study medicine at Leiden University. He became a pathology assistant in 1874 and in 1875 (probably) he took up an appointment as assistant to Adriaan Heynsius, Professor of Physiology at Leiden. In this role he began his work on arterial wave travel using reservoirs, elastic tubes and air chambers. These studies formed the basis of this doctorate in 1877 and were published in a 145-page monograph, Die Pulscurve, in 1878. The key finding of this work was an empirical relationship that described the velocity of pulse propagation in elastic tubes. Except for a numerical constant this turned out to be identical to the theoretical prediction derived by Diederik Korteweg in 1878 and the relationship is now known as the Moens‚ÄìKorteweg equation. In 1878 he retired from physiological research and became a medical practitioner in Goes. He was offered the chair of physiology in Leiden in 1885 when Hynsius died, but he turned it down. Willem Einthoven was subsequently appointed to the post. See also * Moens‚ÄìKorteweg equation References Publications * Moens A.I. Die Pulscurve. Leiden, E.J. Brill 1878.

The album was recorded primarily during the summer of 2011 shortly after Where Is Danny?s re-release via Interscope Records. After leaving Interscope, Swain subsequently signed to Okayplayer Records, and the album was released in late September 2012. Payback was promoted by an appearance by Swain on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon alongside the Roots one week prior to the record's release. The album includes featured performances by various recording artists, and one by actress Amber Tamblyn.http://www.okayplayer.com/news/danny-evil-amber-rose-tamblyn- stream.html  Overview   Background  Shortly after Swain's previous album Where Is Danny? was re-released in 2011, Swain began to compose a satirical project to expose how listeners were more interested in music by high-profile names than in music of substance. Swain spent the remainder of 2011 assembling tracks intended for a digital download album to be released through Interscope. Swain left Interscope's digital label in late 2011 and was later picked up by Questlove's relaunched Okayplayer Records. Payback was largely ready by January 2012.https://www.complex.com/music/2012/06/interview- danny-swain-jay-zs-favorite-new-rapper-speaks-on-payback  Release  Payback, narrated by Joi Gilliam, was revamped for release on September 25, 2012. All tracks were produced by Swain. One week prior to the album's release, Swain performed \\"Evil\\" on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon with the Roots as his backing band.  Reception  Payback initially received mostly favorable reviews after being delivered to the press at the top of 2012, ultimately earning a 76% rating from review aggregator Metacritic leading up to its eventual fall release. Noting the album's scarcity and constant delays at the time, Popmatters praised Swain's candor as well as the cultural references scattered throughout the album, wondering \\"how much of the album‚Äôs more subversive elements could slip between the cracks at a time when the market behaves as though there‚Äôs simply no time or need for inspective ears\\". The production on the album was unanimously acclaimed by critics; Slant Magazine deemed the beats \\"undeniably savvy\\". Sites such as AllMusic and DJ Booth lauded Swain's emotional purging throughout the record, with both likening Payback to an on-wax \\"catharsis\\", while others such as Rolling Stone and No Ripcord chided him for the very same thing, calling Swain \\"angry\\" on an album \\"[full] of gripes\\".

Ferrandino studied Medicine at the University of Naples without completing his degree, but following instead his passion of working as a comic strip scriptwriter. At the end of the seventies, he produced a series of renowned scripts, for publications such as Nero, Lanciostory, Dylan Dog, and Mickey Mouse, reaching the peak of his scriptwriting popularity in the 1980s. In 1993, his novel Pericle il nero (Pericles the Black Man) was published by Granata Press, hardly noticed by the Italian readership. However, after being translated into French by Gallimard, the novel was republished in 1998 in Italy by Adelphi Edizioni, with great success. The story is constructed as an American noir, with a realistic Neapolitan dialect and strong characters, often verging on the grotesque as represented by the pulp literary genre. In 1999, his second novel, Il rispetto, ovvero Pino Pentecoste contro i guappi (Respect, or Pino Pentecoste against the Blabbermouths), was published by Adelphi, followed by the fairy tale Lidia e i turchi (Lydia and the Turks) published by Mondadori. Other successful novels have been published by Ferrandino, among which Spada (Sword) (2007), a reprise of Dumas' Three Musketeers. In 2007 American director Abel Ferrara produced the film version of Ferrandino's 1st novel, with Italian actor Riccardo Scamarcio in the starring role.To be released again in 2012; Release Note . Ferrandino lives in Rome, although he often spends lengthy periods in Chicago.

The name was changed in 1994 to be more congruent with the nomenclature of other medical specialty boards. The mission of the American Board of Pain Medicine is to improve the quality of pain medicine.  Goals and objectives  Goals  The following is a list of goals: # Evaluate candidates who voluntarily appear for examination, and certify or recertify as \\"Diplomates in Pain Medicine\\" those who are qualified # Maintain and improve the quality of graduate medical education in the field of pain medicine by collaborating with related organizations # Provide information about the specialty of pain medicine to the public.  Objectives  The following is a list of objectives: # Determine whether applicants have received adequate preparation in accordance with educational standards established by the ABPM # Create, maintain and administer comprehensive examinations in order to evaluate the knowledge and experience of such candidates # Issue certificates to those candidates found qualified # Develop standards and requirements for graduate medical education in pain medicine in collaboration with other concerned organizations and agencies # Serve as a central registry for public information about the certification status of physicians certified as \\"Diplomates of the American Board of Pain Medicine\\" # Provide information to the public and concerned entities about the rationale for certification in pain medicine # Facilitate discussion with the public, professional organizations, healthcare agencies, and regulatory bodies regarding education, evaluation and certification of pain medicine specialists.  Examination  ABPM administers a psychometrically-developed and practice-related examination in the field of pain medicine to applicants who have met requirements for qualification. Physicians who have successfully completed the ABPM credentialing process and examination are issued certificates as specialists in the field of pain medicine and designated as \\"Diplomates of the American Board of Pain Medicine\\". A list of currently certified ABPM Diplomats is available to medical organizations and other groups for dissemination to the public. The ABPM is not a recognized board by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). It allows non-fellowship trained physicians, as well as those who completed unaccredited fellowships to become \\"board certified\\" by them. This is in contrast to the certificate issued to those who have completed an American Council of Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) accredited fellowships which has national standards, and are regulated by the ABMS.  Initiatives  Another initiative of ABPM is to develop a full‚Äìfledged pain medicine residency training program accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education.  Maintenance of Certification program The American Board of Pain Medicine eliminated lifetime certification in 1998. Certificates issued after 1998 expire after 10 years, creating a 10-year recertification cycle. Concurrently, ABPM created the American Board of Pain Medicine MOC (Maintenance of Certification) program.American Board of Pain Medicine \\"MOC¬Æ Examination Bulletin of Information\\" Retrieved 6 January 2012.  Recognition of ABPM certification in California and Florida  California and Florida recognize ABPM certification as equivalent to an American Board of Medical Specialties certification for advertising purposes, thereby permitting ABPM diplomates to represent themselves as \\"Board Certified\\" in pain medicine.

Originally thought to be a condition of overwork and old age, the disease is now recognized as hereditary and has been seen in horses of all ages, including foals.

DSLD was once considered a condition of the legs only, as one of the most visible signs is when the fetlocks, particularly on the hind legs, collapse into a \\"coon-footed\\" position. However, microscopic examination in necropsy has shown DSLD horses can not only be affected in the tendons and ligaments of all legs and the patella, but can have affected tissues in the nuchal ligament, eyes, aorta, skin and fascia, lungs and other organs, as well as ligaments and tendons throughout the body. Because of its systemic nature, and because connective tissue is present everywhere in a biological entity, the entire body becomes affected in multiple ways as the disease progresses. Some horses have shown an iron overload in the liver as well. Ongoing research is working on the biochemical aspects of the disease and has found a problem in the transfer growth factor and decorin. It is strongly believed to be passed genetically, and those aspects are being studied in the search for a DNA marker.

The basis for such laws stems from advances in medical science and social perception which allow a fetus to be seen and medically treated as an individual in the womb and perceived socially as a person, for some or all of the pregnancy. Such laws overturn the common law legal principle that until physically born, a fetus or unborn child does not have independent legal existence and therefore cannot be the victim of such crimes. They often provide for transferred intent (sometimes called \\"transferred malice\\") so that an unlawful act which happens to affect a pregnant woman and thus harm her fetus can be charged as a crime with the fetus as a victim, in addition to crimes against any other people.  History of born alive law   Common law  The born alive rule was originally a principle at common law in England that was carried to the United States and other former colonies of the British Empire. First formulated by William Staunford, it was later set down by Edward Coke in his Institutes of the Laws of England: > If a woman be quick with childe, and by a potion or otherwise killeth it in > her wombe, or if a man beat her, whereby the child dyeth in her body, and > she is delivered of a dead childe, this is great misprision, and no murder; > but if he childe be born alive and dyeth of the potion, battery, or other > cause, this is murder; for in law it is accounted a reasonable creature, in > rerum natura, when it is born alive.Cited in \\"The New \\"Fetal Protection\\": > The Wrong Answer to the Crisis of Inadequate Health Care for Women and > Children\\" , Linda Fentiman, 2006, note 119, (abstract and download link) The phrase \\"a reasonable creature, in rerum natura\\" as a whole is usually translated as \\"a life in being\\", i.e. where the umbilical cord has been severed and the baby has a life independently of the mother.Attorney General's Reference No 3 of 1994 \\"Reasonable\\" here is used as in the 16th century, meaning \\"something that may reasonably be considered [a living creature]\\". In English law this meant that until born, the fetus was not accounted a person under criminal law, nor a separate person from its mother, and could not have the capacity to be the subject of an actus reus ('wrongful act') - a prerequisite for a criminal offense in the absence of any statute to the contrary.  Subsequent developments  In the 19th century, some began to argue for legal recognition of the moment of conception as the beginning of a human being, basing their argument on growing awareness of the processes of pregnancy and fetal development. They succeeded in drafting laws which criminalized abortion in all forms and made it punishable in secular courts. Advances in the state of the art in medical science, including medical knowledge related to the viability of the fetus, and the ease with which the fetus can be observed in the womb as a living being, treated clinically as a human being, and (by certain stages) demonstrate neural and other processes considered as human, have led a number of jurisdictions - in particular in the United States - to supplant or abolish this common law principle. Changes to the law proceed piecemeal, from case to case and from statute to statute, rather than wholesale. One such landmark case with respect to the rule was Commonwealth vs. Cass, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, where the court held that the stillbirth of an eight-month-old fetus, whose mother had been injured by a motorist, constituted vehicular homicide. By a majority decision, the Supreme Court of Massachusetts held that a viable fetus constituted a \\"person\\" for the purposes of vehicular homicide law. In the opinion of the justices, Several courts have held that it is not their function to revise statute law by abolishing the born alive rule, and have stated that such changes in the law should come from the legislature. In 1970 in Keeler v. Superior Court of Amador County, the California Supreme Court dismissed a murder indictment against a man who had caused the stillbirth of the child of his estranged pregnant wife, stating that: > [T]he courts cannot go so far as to create an offense by enlarging a > statute, by inserting or deleting words, or by giving the terms used false > or unusual meanings [...] Whether to extend liability for murder in > California is a determination solely within the province of the Legislature. Several legislatures passed laws to explicitly include deaths and injuries to fetuses in utero. The general policy has been that an attacker who causes the stillbirth of a fetus should be punished for the destruction of that fetus in the same way as an attacker who attacks a person and causes their death. Some legislatures have simply expanded their existing offences to explicitly include fetuses in utero. Others have created wholly new, and separate, offences.  Federal laws  The Born-Alive Infants Protection Act (\\"BAIPA\\" , ) extends legal protection to an infant born alive after a failed attempt at induced abortion. It passed into law on August 5, 2002.http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h107-2175 The law defines a \\"born alive\\" infant as the complete expulsion of an infant at any stage of development that has a heartbeat, pulsation of the umbilical cord, breath, or voluntary muscle movement, regardless of circumstances of birth or severance of the umbilical cord, and provides rights for such infants. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act (Public Law 108-212) recognizes a \\"child in utero\\" as a legal victim, if he or she is injured or killed during the commission of any of over 60 listed federal crimes of violence. The law defines \\"child in utero\\" as \\"a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb\\". Text of Unborn Victims of Violence Act. It applies only to certain offenses over which the United States government has jurisdiction, including certain crimes committed on federal properties, against certain federal officials and employees, and by members of the military, as well as certain crimes (including some acts of terrorism) which count as federal offenses even if outside the United States. The act explicitly provides that it may not \\"be construed to permit the prosecution\\" of any person in relation to consensual abortion, medical treatment of a mother or her fetus, or any woman with regard to her own fetus. It passed into law on April 1, 2004 and is codified under two sections of the United States Code: Title 18, Chapter 1 (Crimes), ¬ß1841 (18 USC 1841), and the Uniform Code of Military Justice: Title 10, Chapter 22 ¬ß919a (Article 119a). The law was both hailed and vilified by legal observers who interpreted the measure as a step toward granting legal personhood to human fetuses.  List of laws by state   California  ¬ß187 of the California Penal Code was amended to redefine murder to include the unlawful killing of a fetus. The term \\"fetus\\" was not initially defined. In People v. Smith (1976)129 Cal. Rptr. 498 (Ct. App. 1976). the court qualified this as signifying a viable fetus, holding that until the capability for independent existence is attained by a fetus \\"there is only the expectancy and potentiality for human life\\". They reasoned that the U.S. Supreme Court had implicitly stated in various cases dealing with abortion, that destruction of a nonviable fetus did not constitute taking a human life. As homicide was the unlawful destruction of a human life, proof was required that the unlawful destruction of a human life had in fact occurred. Thus it was held that the defendant was guilty of abortion, but not homicide. In People v. Davis (1994), the California Supreme Court examined this and concluded fetal viability was not essential for rights to exist. They reasoned that abortion cases such as Wade v. Roe discuss where to draw the line for legitimate state interest in situations where the interests of fetus and mother conflict. Such cases do not discuss, and do not preclude, a legitimate state interest in protecting the potentiality of human life perhaps arising at a different time in situations where the rights of the fetus do not have to be set against the rights of the mother. Minnesota Vehicular homicide, death to an unborn child, and injury to an unborn child are three separate offences, under the umbrella of criminal vehicular operation.

One of the largest such bodies is the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT).Mayo Clinic Certification Criteria The specific certification criteria can vary from credentialing body to credentialing body. Florida is the only state that requires certification to market oneself as a \\"sex therapist,\\" requiring 120 hours of in-depth training in sexual issues and concerns and 20 hours of sex therapy supervision. Florida Sex Therapist AASECT-Specific Criteria AASECT certified sex therapists are mental health professionals, trained to provide in-depth psychotherapy, who have specialized in treating clients with sexual issues and concerns. They are either licensed, or in the absence of available licensure, certified, registered, or clinical members of a national psychotherapy organization.AASECT website AASECT website At present, AASECT requires that applicants for sex therapist certification be current members of AASECT, have a graduate degree, post-degree clinical experience, liability insurance, and a valid state license to practice psychology, medicine, social work, counseling, nursing, or marriage and family therapy. AASECT requirements include 90 hours of courses in 15 core areas of human sexuality, and also 60 hours of training in seven specific disciplines related to sex therapy. Every AASECT certified sex therapist must agree to abide by the AASECT code of ethics, which stresses competence and integrity along with moral, ethical, and legal responsibility to safeguard the well- being of clients. Further, AASECT certification requires up to 50 hours of direct supervision by a AASECT certified sex therapy supervisor ‚Äî half of these hours can take place in small, pre-approved groups. For the vast majority of professionals in health care and human services, certification is a prerequisite to practice. AASECT credentials sexual health professionals on the basis of rigorous standards for academic preparation, supervised training and consultation, field-related experience and applied skills. Field experience and practical application of skills and competencies carried out under trained and approved supervision or consultation are crucial aspects of certification. Applicants must substantiate completion of certification requirements with academic transcripts and other formal documentation, and must also undergo peer review of their credentials. PLISSIT Model Using the PLISSIT model for Sexual Counseling, sex therapists are trained to perform all four steps (P-LI-SS-IT).Annon, J. S. (1976). Behavioral Treatment of Sexual Problems: Brief Therapy. Harper & Row. . The P-LI-SS-IT model for Sexuality Counseling: * Permission (P): The practitioner creates a climate of comfort and permission for clients to discuss sexual concerns, often introducing the topic of sexuality, thereby validating sexuality as a legitimate health issue. * Limited Information (LI): The practitioner addresses specific sexual concerns and attempts to correct myths and misinformation. * Specific suggestions (SS): The practitioner compiles a sexual history or profile of the client: :# Defining the issues and concerns of the client. :# Determining the course of how the issues have evolved over time. :# Facilitating the client's understanding of the main issues and providing options for resolution. :# Assisting the client in formulating perceptions and ideas about sources of these concerns and developing realistic and appropriate goals and solution plans. * Intensive Therapy (IT): The practitioner provides specialized treatment in cases that are complicated by the coexistence of other complex life issues which may also include psychiatric diagnoses such as depression, anxiety disorders (including obsessive-compulsive disorder), personality disorders, or substance abuse, or by interpersonal or intrapersonal conflict. Certified sex therapy treatment Certified sex therapists work with simple sexual concerns, but in addition, where appropriate, are prepared to provide comprehensive and intensive psychotherapy over an extended period of time in more complex cases. Sex therapy can help resolve various sexual issues, from concerns about sexual function or feelings that affect one‚Äôs sex life to the way one relates to a partner. Sex therapy may address: concerns about sexual desire or arousal, concerns about sexual interests or sexual orientation, sex addiction or compulsive sexual behavior, erectile dysfunction, premature ejaculation, trouble reaching orgasm (anorgasmia), painful intercourse (dyspareunia), intimacy issues related to a disability or chronic condition. Sex therapists tend to have much greater than average knowledge about the physiological processes that are a part of human sexuality.WebMD website References External links *What is a Sex Therapist *Association of Counseling Sexology & Sexual Wellness Relationship counseling Sex therapy ","title":"Certified Sex Therapist"},{"id":"34301047","text":"Associated London Scripts was a writers' agency organised as a co-operative which involved many leading comedy and television writers of the 1950s and 1960s. In the early 1950s, as The Goon Show was gaining popularity, its main writer Spike Milligan married for the first time and began a family. This reportedly sufficiently distracted him from writing scripts so much that he accepted an invitation from Eric Sykes to share his small office above a grocer's shop at 130 Uxbridge Road, Shepherd's Bush. Sykes was then writing for the radio comedy series Educating Archie starring Peter Brough and his ventriloquist dummy Archie Andrews (in which Harry Secombe was also appearing).Humphrey Carpenter Spike Milligan: The Biography, London: Hodder and Stoughton, 2003, p.155 Sykes originated the idea of forming a non-profit, co-operative writers' agency; Milligan then approached rising comedy writing partners Ray Galton and Alan Simpson with the proposal. Taking vacant space above Sykes's office, they jointly formed Associated London Scripts (ALS) with Frankie Howerd and Sykes and Howerd's then manager Stanley \\"Scruffy\\" Dale. Their original secretary (a former schoolfriend of Simpson) was Beryl Vertue, who later became the firm's business affairs manager and in-house agent. Comedian Tony Hancock briefly joined the collective and other prominent notable members included Terry Nation, Johnny Speight, Dennis Spooner and John Antrobus.Carpenter, 2003, p.156-59 The venture eventually grew to include around thirty writers, with a support staff of twelve; by 1957 it had outgrown the Shepherd's Bush offices and moved to larger premises in Kensington High Street. Around 1960, ALS sold the Kensington offices and purchased even more prestigious premises at 9 Orme Court in Bayswater Road, adjacent to Hyde Park. In 1967\\"Associated London Scripts\\", BBC Radio 4 (Comedy) website Robert Stigwood bought a controlling interest in ALS; Galton and Simpson had favoured the deal (because Stigwood was moving into film production)\\"Interview: Galton & Simpson\\", Den of Geek, 23 January 2009 but Sykes and Milligan did not, so they sold their controlling shares in the company to Stigwood, while Galton and Simpson (to their later regret) sold their share of Orme Court to Milligan and Sykes. Milligan later sold his half to Sykes, who reportedly retained the freehold on the valuable property into the 21st century. Wanting to move into production, Beryl Vertue opted to go with Stigwood becoming deputy chairman of his group; she subsequently became a leading independent producer.

The initial format for the series changes after the first series, with series one being a surreal sketch show, and series two being a sitcom. The series stars Noel Fielding, his brother Michael Fielding, Tom Meeten, Dolly Wells, and occasionally Rich Fulcher, Dave Brown, and Richard Ayoade. The first episode premiered on 26 January 2012 on E4. The music for the first series was written by Noel Fielding and Kasabian's Sergio Pizzorno, a good friend of Fielding's, under the band name Loose Tapestries. The duo were joined for the second series by Kasabian touring member, Tim Carter. It is described on the Channel 4 website as \\"a psychedelic character based comedy show half filmed and half animated\\". The first series started airing on 26 January 2012 and lasted for seven episodes. Channel 4 announced in February 2012 that Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy had been recommissioned for a second series, which started airing on E4 on 31 July 2014. The series format has switched from sketch show to sitcom, set mainly in a Hawaiian coffee shop. It features many new characters as well as the majority of characters from the first run. The series is given the subtitle Tales from Painted Hawaii. Plot Each episode is structured around a plot involving Noel and his friends, accompanied by sketches featuring strange characters who are usually not connected to the main story. The first series is set in Noel's treehouse in a red and blue jungle, while the second series Tales from Painted Hawaii is set on a fictional island in Hawaii, where Noel runs a coffee shop. There are fewer sketches in the second series than in the first, with most of the character sketches being set around the Hawaiian island. During the second series, most episodes revolve around the characters having to complete a task before the end of the show. Characters Main Characters * Noel (Series 1- ) Noel Fielding (playing an exaggerated version of himself) - Noel is portrayed as imaginative yet childlike and irresponsible. In the first series, he lives in a treehouse in a red and blue jungle, and dresses in elaborate costumes and brightly coloured face paint. In the second series, Noel is the manager of \\"Luxury Coffee\\", a coffee shop on a fictional island in Hawaii named \\"Painted Hawaii\\". He stops wearing face paint and wears the same costume, his Luxury Coffee uniform, in every episode of the second series. He is the lead singer in the band who perform the show's theme tune. * Smooth (Series 1- ) (played by Michael Fielding) - Smooth is a grey human-anteater hybrid, describing himself as \\"mixed race\\" because his father is a human and his mother is an anteater. He often serves as the voice of reason and maturity, often pointing out the flaws in Noel's plans. He plays the bass guitar in the cast band and is also shown to play the double bass. * Dolly (Series 1- ) (played by Dolly Wells) - Noel's friend and former girlfriend. She is a fashion model from Berlin, and is obsessed with fashion, art and the latest cultural trends. She is the drummer in the cast band. * Warhol (Series 1- ) Andy Warhol (played by Tom Meeten) - An exaggerated version of the famous painter, who started out as Noel's cleaner in Series 1. In Series 2 he works in the coffee shop with Noel and Smooth. He talks and acts like a robot, with his voice mimicking a voice synthesiser, and he is often neurotic and insecure. A recurring joke in the second series includes Andy meeting with other famous artists, musicians and writers from the 20th century, such as George Orwell and Yoko Ono, for leisure activities. He plays the keyboard in the cast band. Reoccurring Characters All characters listed are played by Noel Fielding, unless stated otherwise. * Secret Peter (Series 1- ), Noel's landlord.

He never appears on screen but Boombox constantly shouts at him.

He is Tony Reason's friend, a fellow music producer and sometimes appears in the same fish tank as Tony. * Joey Ramone (Series 1, 2- ), a stop- motion, plasticine version of the punk rock star, portrayed with comically long legs, blue hair and no arms.

He was up for eviction back to reality when Painted Hawaii was made into a Reality television show. * Fantasy Man (Series 1, 2- ), a superhero who goes on self-imposed quests in an electronic, operatic fantasy world similar in appearance to Tron.

He was killed off in Series 1 but still reappeared in Series 2. * Doo Rag (Series 1- ) (played by Michael Fielding), a man with a bowl haircut and moustache, who dresses in blue racing leathers.

Reception Series 1 received mixed reviews, offering both high praise and scathing criticism. The Guardian described it as a \\"neo-psychedelic riot of mirth that regurgitates decades of memories of broad, Technicolor TV entertainment from The Banana Splits onwards.\\" Stephen Armstrong wrote in The Sunday Times that \\"Fielding grins down like a fiendish blend of Peter Gabriel, Syd Barrett, Samuel Beckett and a TV-age Antonin Artaud, unsettling and hypnotising in equal measure. In these dreary times it's as subversive as Bowie appearing on Tops of The Pops in a dress.\\" Andy Johnson at Purple Revolver said that \\"if someone wanted to make TV for Salvador Dal√≠ and Rene Magritte then Noel Fielding's Luxury Comedy would be it. The artwork, decadent use of colour and reckless abandonment of the rules of form is a delight to watch.\\" On the other hand, The Yorker said \\"The plots are too obscure to follow, so one is left with a lurid array of half-animated, half-real characters spouting phrases which seem to have been generated by flicking through the dictionary at random.\\" The Scotsman said of Fielding: \\"as an absurdist comedian he's so painfully uninspired and laboured\\" and \\"I was left bewildered as to how anyone could ever fall for this charmless rubbish\\", and goes on to say \\"he patently thinks of himself as a mind-blowing surrealist bursting with astonishing ideas (A sentient chocolate finger! A Noo Yoik cop with a talking wound!). But in reality he's the tiresome equivalent of the unfunny office clown persistently proclaiming how mad he is.\\" Series 2 was rated 4/5 stars by the Daily Telegraph's Christopher Howse, who described it as \\"best watched drunk\\".

The collective focuses on themes such as migration, identity and intercultural communication and designs pictograms together with migrants which are then placed in public spaces in order to give voice to migrants living in Germany. The collective is made up of migrants and is organised non-hierarchically. Since 2004, the project has been organising exhibitions in various European cities. In 2011, the collective was awarded the German award for integration and tolerance by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel on behalf of the Initiative Hauptstadt Berlin. Migrantas views pictograms as universally understandable images and a global language. Pictograms designed by Migrantas are similar to those found all over in the world in public spaces where they are normally used in place of written language in advertising and street signs. The difference between Migrantas' pictograms is that they are used to highlight the individual, cultural, socio-economic and political aspects of migration. The pictograms are developed during workshops together with migrant groups and associations. The idea is then to make visible the feelings and everyday experiences of migrants, which migrantas argue otherwise receive very little publicity. The collective mostly works with women and encourages workshop participants to express their everyday experiences, feelings and views of life as a migrant living in a foreign culture. The sketches produced in these workshops are then developed into pictograms by the collective members themselves. Finally, the pictograms are placed in public spaces during 'urban actions' which until now have included using posters, billboards, and advertising on public transport. At the same time, migrantas also organises exhibitions of its work and the sketches produced during its workshops. Migrantas argues that this gives the migrants themselves the opportunity to receive public recognition for their own work. At the same time, this provides individuals who have very little access to the media the opportunity to publicise their own experiences of migration and immigration.

It was built in the 13th and 14th centuries. The tall spire is a notable feature, visible from a great distance. History A church here was mentioned in the Domesday Book, but nothing remains of the building. There was a two-cell church (consisting of nave and chancel) built about 1200; in the late 13th century, north and south transepts were added.St Andrew's Church, Clifton Campville: Church Guide, obtained at the church in 2009. In the 14th century the building was enlarged: the south aisle was created, incorporating the earlier south transept; an extra bay was added to the chancel which comprises the present sanctuary; the lady chapel was built on the south side adjoining the chancel; the tower and spire were built. The church seen today is essentially the building of this period. Interior The masonry of the 14th century is of dressed stone of ashlar quality, the 13th century stone is roughly squared; this difference is visible in the north wall and remnants of the original south wall. The south wall was replaced by a three-bay arcade to the south aisle. A distant view of the church from the south-west In the north wall, the westernmost of the two decorated windows has glass from the 15th century. The north transverse chapel, occupying the north transept, was probably created in the late 13th century; above it, accessed by a spiral staircase from the chancel, is a Priest's Room, with medieval details including fireplace and garderobe. The oak rood screen between nave and chancel is 15th-century, and has perpendicular tracery; there are 17th-century wooden doors in the screen. The chancel and sanctuary are long. Behind the choir stalls are 14th-century misericords, carved with foliage and figure heads. On the south wall of the south aisle is a wall painting from the early 14th century, depicting Christ seated on a throne, and Mary seated and crowned, and attendant figures of a knight and a lady. The lady chapel The lady chapel was built in the 14th century; its creation is mentioned in the Lichfield Episcopal Registers of 1361: \\"Ordination of a Chantry on the South side of the church in honour of the Holy Trinity, Mary the Mother of God... for Sir Richard Stafford and his wife Maud, and for the soul of Isabel, his former wife.\\" Sir Richard Stafford of Clifton, and Isabel Vernon, were the parents of Edmund Stafford (1344‚Äì1419), who held the rectorship of Clifton Campville his family lands, and later became Bishop of Exeter. A tomb under an arch in the north wall of the nave is thought to be the tomb of Isabel, who died c. 1350. A tomb under an arch in the south wall of the south aisle is thought to be of Sir Richard Stafford, who died in 1380.Edmund Stafford Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, accessed 4 March 2015. There are original wooden screens, through which you enter the chapel from the south aisle or the chancel. In the centre of the chapel is an alabaster tomb chest, a monument to John Vernon of Harlaston, who died in 1545, and his wife Ellen; they are shown recumbent. The organ is in the chapel; built by Brindley & Foster in 1874, it was installed in the church in 1907 and enlarged in 1975. Restoration The church bells The church was restored in the 1860s by George Edmund Street; this involved replacement of the medieval roof. There was restoration by W. D. Caroe in 1910: this included a new north porch, work to the nave roof, north transept and the tower, and rehanging of the bells. In 1984 the spire was struck by lightning, with much damage to the church. Repairs were completed in 1987.

He was deeply involved in the political controversies of his time, and was a leading opponent of the powerful Anglo-Irish magnate James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond. His elder son Nicholas also held office as Lord Chief Justice; his younger son Robert was created the first Baron Trimleston.  Family  He was born at Crickstown in County Meath, the elder son of Nicholas de Bernevall, whose wife was a Clifford. His younger brother founded the Kingsland branch of the family.Lodge, John and Archdall, Mervyn Peerage of Ireland 6 Volumes 1789 Vol.5 p.30 He married Matilda (or Maud) Drake, a member of the influential Drake family of Drakerath, County Meath, who was probably a sister of John Drake, Mayor of Dublin. The most notable of his children were his eldest son Sir Nicholas Barnewall, who like his father was Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, and his younger son Robert, 1st Baron Trimleston.Lodge and Archdall, p.30  Career  He was appointed King's Serjeant in 1422 and held that office until 1434 when he became second justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland); he was appointed Lord Chief Justice of Ireland the following year and with one short gap served in that office until his death in October 1446.Ball, F.

Butler‚ÄìTalbot feud Bernevall was regarded as a highly \\"political\\" judge and his career reflects the bitter political of the time. Fifteenth-century Ireland was deeply troubled by the long feud between James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond and his faction on the one hand, and Richard Talbot, Archbishop of Dublin and his brother John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury on the other. While some judges, notably the Cornwalsh family, which produced two Chief Barons in turn, were supporters of Ormond, Bernevall was a strong supporter of the Talbot faction.Otway-Ruthven A.J.

In 1444 Thorndon fled from Ireland, unable to bear any more dissension. He attempted to appoint Bernevall as his Deputy, but Ormond promptly declared the appointment illegal.Otway-Ruthven p. 375 Numerous accusations of wrongdoing were made against Bernevall,Griffiths, Ralph A.

Based on the biography of the same name by Nigel Nicolson, it features Janet McTeer as Vita, and Cathryn Harrison as Violet. The series was adapted by Penelope Mortimer, directed by Stephen Whittaker and produced by Colin Tucker. It was first aired on BBC Two in four parts in 1990; a three-part edited version aired in the United States on PBS in 1992 as part of the Masterpiece Theatre strand. Cast * Janet McTeer as Vita Sackville-West * Cathryn Harrison as Violet Trefusis * David Haig as Harold Nicolson * Diana Fairfax as Lady Sackville * Peter Birch as Denys Trefusis * Kathleen Byron as Lady Carnock Production Nigel Nicolson, son of Vita and Harold, originally sold the rights to his book to Patricia Hodge, who offered it to the BBC. Matt Wolf, writing in The New York Times, described Nicolson as being \\"among the severest critics\\" of the production. Nicolson said that \\"there was too much sex in it\\" and if someone were to respond that he wrote it: \\"But my answer is there's a difference between written words and the visual image. The affair could have been suggested much more delicately; it could be done by gesture and look, not necessarily by performance.\\" Whittaker and McTeer also spoke to Wolf. Whittaker found the story \\"quite remarkable\\" and said of the subjects: \\"They were trying actually to make some sense of their lives, to come to terms and explore themselves in very painful and joyous ways and to be at one with themselves.\\" McTeer said that: \\"[Vita] didn't quite fit in anywhere. She wasn't quite in the Bloomsbury set; she wasn't quite a bohemian; she didn't quite belong in the aristocracy. She was an eccentric, and eccentric people are always interesting.\\" Reception John J. O'Connor, writing for The New York Times, praised the performances of McTeer, Harrison and Haig, and said: \\"Despite offering much to admire, Portrait of a Marriage eventually wears painfully thin.\\" In the Los Angeles Times, Howard Rosenberg also praised the performances, describing them as \\"first rate\\", but said that \\"Penelope Mortimer's adaptation is without joy, giving us no one to like or even care about\\". Tony Scott in Variety concluded his review by praising the production of the drama, including costume, design, filming, editing and music, and saying: \\"Visually and dramatically Marriage is terrif\\". All three reviewers discussed the cuts made for the American audience. The production won three awards at the British Academy Television Awards in 1991 in the costume design (Dinah Collin), design (Stuart Walker) and film editor (Dick Allen) categories; Lisa Westcott was nominated in the make up category. The series also won the Grand Prize at the 1991 Banff Television Festival.

According to the Syrian government, a suicide bomber attacked buses carrying riot police shortly before an anti-government protest was to begin. It said that 26 people were killed and over 60 were injured. Most of the victims were civilians, though the Syrian government showed footage of what it claimed to be the funeral of 11 police officers killed in the attack. It was the second such bombing since an uprising against the government began in early 2011. Two weeks earlier, a double car bombing in Damascus had killed 44 people. The government blamed that attack and the 6 January attack on al Qaeda. However, the Syrian opposition accused the government of staging the attacks to justify its crackdown on the uprising. Later, the newly formed Al- Nusra Front to Protect the Levant claimed responsibility in a video.  Background  The attack occurred as Arab League monitors were in the country to see if Syria was abiding by Arab League demands that were said to have sought an end to the violence. Two weeks earlier, a double car bombing in Damascus had killed 44 people. The government blamed that attack on Islamist militants.  Bombing  Most of the initial information about the attack comes from the Syrian government and state media. It reported that, at about 10:55,\\"Terrorist Bombing in al-Midan Neighborhood in Damascus Causes Tens of Deaths and Injuries, Most Are Civilians\\" . Syrian Arab News Agency. 6 January 2012.

Retrieved 6 January 2012.\\"Syrian bomb attacks cause people to rally around Bashar al-Assad's regime\\". The Guardian. 6 January 2012. Retrieved 6 January 2012. A police officer said that he had seen a man carrying a black bag walk toward a bus and then detonate the explosives.\\"Syria unrest: Damascus blast and clashes kill many\\". BBC News. 6 January 2012. Retrieved 6 January 2012. The buses were parked outside a police station that was near a primary school and a mosque. The bomb detonated at a traffic light under a concrete flyover, shattering windows and destroying several police cars. According to Syrian state media, it was estimated that the bomb was 10 kilograms of high explosive. Syrian state news agency SANA reported that 26 were killed (including 15 who could not be identified) and 63 were hurt.\\"Bomb Kills Dozens in Damascus, Stoking Suspicions\\". The New York Times. 6 January 2012. Retrieved 6 January 2012. It also said that most of the victims were civilians but that there were security personnel among the dead. Remains, allegedly those of the bomber, were left at the scene for several hours before being taken away for DNA tests. These and other body parts were repeatedly displayed for journalists who were driven to the scene by the Ministry of Information. State-owned television showed a damaged bus with blood and police helmets on the seats. Interior Minister Mohammed Shaar said that the bomber \\"detonated himself with the aim of killing the largest number of people.\\"  Aftermath  Hundreds of government loyalists later arrived at the scene, some of whom were waving flags and chanting in support of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. According to The New York Times, people living in the neighborhood reported that about an hour after the bombing, security forces and armed loyalists went on \\"a rampage, shooting randomly and beating and arresting people in the streets\\". Despite the bombing, anti-government protests went ahead in Damascus and elsewhere. The anti-government Local Co- ordinating Committees said 14 protesters were killed in the suburbs of Damascus later that day. It also reported that nine protesters had been killed in Hama, eight were killed in Homs, three were killed in Idlib and one was killed in Deraa. SANA also reported that an oil pipeline between Hama and Idlib had been blown up by a \\"terrorist group.\\"  Perpetrators  The Interior Minister described the modus operandi and \\"intention to cause mass casualties\\" as having the \\"fingerprints of al-Qaida.\\" Syria's interior ministry said the government would \\"strike back with an iron fist\\" to what it called \\"terrorist escalation\\". Opposition groups accused the government of staging the attack to \\"sully the opposition‚Äôs image\\" and validate its own argument that it is \\"fighting blind violence rather than a pro-democracy movement.\\"\\"Syrian capital rocked by deadly explosion\\". France 24. 6 January 2012. Retrieved 6 January 2012. The Free Syrian Army (FSA), the main anti- government paramilitary group, denied involvement and condemned the attack. FSA spokesman Major Maher al-Naimi said: \\"This is planned and systematic state terrorism by the security forces of the President Bashar al-Assad\\". The Syrian National Council issued a statement reading: \\"Today's bombings, in the area that has experienced the largest of the anti-regime demonstrations, clearly bear the regime's fingerprints\\". The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood also blamed the government. On 7 January, opposition activists accused the government of making fake television footage of the aftermath. The activists pointed to three clips \\"mistakenly\\" aired by Syrian state TV. One shows what seems to be an injured man on the ground standing up just before the end of the clip. Another shows a man with a microphone (allegedly a reporter for Syrian state TV) placing \\"bags of vegetables\\" in the street to give the impression that some of the victims were civilians shopping in the nearby market. The third video shows a person putting police shields in one of the damaged vans. The same day as the bombing, Syrian opposition leader Ammar Qurabi claimed that the government was planning another bombing in Aleppo \\"to terrorize the people\\". He said he had learned of the plot from Syrian security officials.\\"Syrian opposition figure says Assad‚Äôs regime plotting a massive blast in Aleppo\\" . Al Arabiya. 6 January 2012.

Some years later, in 1918, the playwright George Bernard Shaw donated the Assembly Rooms to the people of Carlow for the promotion of technical education. Classes were centralised in these Assembly Rooms on Dublin Street from 1923 onwards.

The remodelled and refurbished school premises in Dublin Street was opened on January 26, 1936 by the Minister of Education Mr. Tom Derrig T.D.. By the 1960s the school was spread over eight different locations and was providing both a second level educational programme preparing students for the Day Vocational Certificate, the Intermediate Certificate and Leaving Certificate examinations and also education and training for apprentices and technicians. In 1968, the Department of Education gave sanction for the erection of two purpose built structures on the Kilkenny Road to cater for the expanding vocational school population. One building, opened in 1970, was called Carlow Regional Technical College which later became the Institute of Technology, Carlow. This was assigned for the education and training of apprentices and technicians. In 1972 the second building, designed to accommodate 450 second level students, opened and was called Carlow Vocational School.

Environmentalism: Ideology and Power. Nova Science Pub Inc. 2003 and social movement regarding concerns for environmental conservation and improvement of the health of the environment, particularly as the measure for this health seeks to incorporate the concerns of non-human elements. Environmentalism advocates the preservation, restoration and/or improvement of the natural environment, and may be referred to as a movement to control pollution.http://www.merriam- webster.com/dictionary/environmentalism  What type of thing is environmentalism?  Environmentalism can be described as all of the following: * a philosophy - the study of knowledge and the nature of life ** an environmental philosophy - a branch of philosophy that studies the fundamental workings of human's relation to the environment and our place in it ** a branch of ethics - environmentalism concerns moral relationships and the intrinsic value of both humans and the environment *** a branch of environmental ethics - environmental ethics describes the moral aspects that connect humans and non humans concerning the environment and what obligations human species have to non human species * Ideology - a system of ideas that focus on environmental thought and form how one thinks about maintaining the environment * Political movement - environmentalists seek to both change and create policy concerning environmental issues in order to protect the environment from further harm ** Social movement - as a collective group environmentalists seek to create social environmental change and protect environmental liberties through both radical and non radical ecological groups  Environmental movement  * Conservation movement - seeks to protect natural areas for sustainable consumption, as well as traditional (hunting, fishing, trapping) and spiritual use. ** Environmental conservation - process in which one is involved in conserving the natural aspects of the environment. Whether through reforestation, recycling, or pollution control, environmental conservation sustains the natural quality of life. * Environmental health movement - dates at least to Progressive Era, and focuses on urban standards like clean water, efficient sewage handling, and stable population growth. Environmental health could also deal with nutrition, preventive medicine, aging, and other concerns specific to human well-being. Environmental health is also seen as an indicator for the state of the environment, or an early warning system for what may happen to humans * Environmental justice - movement that began in the U.S. in the 1980s and seeks an end to environmental racism and prevent low-income and minority communities from an unbalanced exposure to highways, garbage dumps, and factories. The Environmental Justice movement seeks to link \\"social\\" and \\"ecological\\" environmental concerns, while at the same time preventing de facto racism, and classism. This makes it particularly adequate for the construction of labor-environmental alliances. * Ecology movement - involves the Gaia theory as well as Value of Earth and other interactions between humans, science, and responsibility. ** Deep ecology - ideological spinoff of the ecology movement that views the diversity and integrity of the planetary ecosystem, in and for itself, as its primary value. * Bright green environmentalism - currently popular sub-movement that emphasizes the idea that through technology, good design and more thoughtful use of energy and resources, people can live responsible, sustainable lives while enjoying prosperity. * Anti-nuclear movement - opposes the use of various nuclear technologies. ** Positions *** Nuclear disarmament *** Opposes the use of nuclear power ** Anti-nuclear groups *** Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament *** Friends of the Earth *** Greenpeace *** International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War *** Nuclear Information and

A prominent biofuels researcher of Bangladesh, her research and publications also aimed to lower dependence on petroleum based foreign oil by producing low carbon and sulphur emitting biofuels from the second generation energy crops cultivated in the unused wastelands of Bangladesh for use in home generators to supplement power. An elected member of the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh, she was also the former secretary of the Institute of Environmental Professionals ‚Äì Bangladesh in 2003, and is an Associate professor and Faculty of Environmental Science and Management at North South University and held similar teaching tenures at BRAC University and at the Department of Population Environment at IUB since 2000. Education She was born in 1961, to the Munshibari family of Comilla, where author Saleh Uddin was her older brother. She is the sister-in-law of Raihanul Abedin. Upon graduation from Eden College, she attended the University of Dhaka's Department of Soil, Water and Environment in 1977. In 1978 she studied Soil Chemistry under Dr. Iajuddin Ahmed. She graduated with a BS degree in Soil Science in 1981 and a MS degree in Soil Chemistry in 1982. She was married to Muhammad Shahid Sarwar in 1981. The same year she was awarded the First Class Honours Award by the Dhaka Education Board. In 1997 she travelled to Europe to attend the Department of Applied Plant Sciences and Plant Biotechnology for a PhD at the University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna in Austria (Institut f. Pflanzenzuchtung u. Pflanzenbau Uni. F. Bodenkultur Wien, Osterreich) as an Austrian Academic Exchange Fellow. She has also been a visiting scholar at University of Florida and Washington State University in the United States.Kamrun Nahar at ORCID Background Nahar first proposed to cultivate a non-food bioenergy crop, Jatropha curcas L. in Bangladesh as it did not need arable lands and does not compete with food. Her work focused on the increasing water deficit conditions due to global climate change and its relationship to fruit yield, particularly in combating world hunger. Her publications also center around bioenergy and food production in both the cyclical water deficit lands and the highly flooded plains of Bangladesh.DESM News (14 March 2012) Dr. Kamrun Nahar has joined DESM as an assistant professor North South University Emphasizing on land use patterns and possible cultivation areas of Bangladesh, she stressed the uses and socioeconomic benefits of the plant citing minimal production costs and ease for the production of biodiesel and other useful byproducts, compared to conventional fossil fuel. Carbon sequestration was also implied in the national scheme. Nahar, K. and Ozores-Hampton, M. (2011). Jatropha: An Alternative Substitute to Fossil Fuel.(IFAS Publication Number HS1193). Gainesville: University of Florida, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences. Retrieved (12-17-1989). Soil fertility and water deficiency In the early 1980s, Nahar began analysing the soils of different areas of the country. Twenty soil samples belonging to four pedons from Bhola District were analysed for their profile morphology, particle size distribution, and mineral composition in the clay fraction. Fine to medium-sized mottles with distinct contrast were present in almost all the horizons. Structural B (cambic) horizon has developed in all the pedons where clay content ranged from 17‚Äì42%. The texture of the soils ranged from silt loam to silty clay loam. Mica and kaolinite were the two other minerals whose abundance was nearly equal. Occurrence of small quantities of mica-vermiculite intergrades and some interstratified clay minerals was suspected. A small portion of smectites was considered to be formed authigenically in the soils from Bhola. Later, a total of twenty one soil samples belonging to five representative soil series were collected on horizon basis from the three distinct vegetative zones of Raojan Rubber garden, Chittagong and analysed for their different properties. The difference horizons of the profiles studied were truly pedogenetic. Sand was the dominant fraction of the soil which might indicate that the parent materials were arenaceous in nature. The texture of the soil ranged from loamy sand to sandy loam at the surface and sandy loam to sandy clay loam at the subsurface. The results of sand/silt ration indicate that the studied profiles did not form on uniform parent materials. Moisture percentage of air dry soils ranged from 0.3 to 2.6. A positive correlation existed between percent clay and hygroscopic moisture of the soils. Drought-resistant plants and crop yield Since then, Nahar's research focused on increasing water deficit conditions due to global climate change and its relationship to fruit yield, particularly in combating world hunger. Her publications also center around bioenergy and food production in both the cyclical water deficit lands and the highly flooded plains of Bangladesh. The influence of water stress on tomato plants and fruit quality was investigated in a pot experiment. The uptake of nitrogen, sodium, potassium, sulphur, calcium and magnesium was significantly reduced by water stress in the plants. Significant increases in glucose, fructose, sucrose in fruits and proline content in leaves showed some tendency of this crop to adjust osmotically to water stress. Water stress increased the sugar and acid contents (ascorbic, malic and citric acid) of the tomato fruits and thus improved the fruit quality. This study investigates the effects of water stress on moisture content distribution at different soil layers (pot) and on morphological characters of tomato plants. Moisture content distribution was higher at the surface and decreased with increasing stress at all growth stages. Yield and related morphological characters responded better at certain of the field capacity compared when with other treatments. A study was conducted in the experimental field of Sher-e-Bangla Agricultural University, in Dhaka, Bangladesh to study the effect of water stress on fruit quality and osmotic adjustment in different types. The plants had a tendency to adjust against drop in potential in soil by producing organic solutes such as glucose, fructose, sucrose and proline. The quality of fruits was improved as a result of the synthesis of ascorbic acid, citric acid and malic acid. No physical damage due to stress was observed in fruits, which were over 90% red. Another such test conducted studied the effect of water stress on the height, dry matter and yield of few cultivars where it was noticed that the yield was reduced due to stress but no significant difference was observed. Second- generation bioenergy crops Presiding over an event in Khagrachari. Nahar also worked on energy crops, especially their adaptability in different soil types of Bangladesh, especially wastelands choosing second generation energy crops not in high demand in the global food market and thus has little impact on food prices and food security thereby negating the food-fuel dilemma. She explored the potential of biofuel production on a limited land space for sustaining a growing population like Bangladesh. With rapidly growing urban and national population growth rate, Bangladesh's growing demand for energy with urban expansion has led to deforestation and a steady loss of arable lands, which may result in future food shortages, where she proposes a simple required land use per capita model .\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\left(X_{vi}\\\\right) \\\\times n_{vi}}{M_{vi}} \\\\right]group=note}} for establishing a relationship between the biomass production, associated crop yields, the biomass to biofuel conversion methods and the overall fuel demand, as a plan to meet the national energy and habitable land demands while considering the looming environmental effects related to energy usage.

She is the first out bisexual legislator in the history of Colombia. While in office, she has advocated for various human rights issues. One example is the push for same-sex partnership rights. Colombia legalized same-sex partnerships in 2011, and since her election to the Chamber of Representatives in 2014 Lozano remains outspoken on increasing the rights for same-sex partners. In 2014, Lozano dealt with controversy surrounding her own relationship with a fellow female Senator.  Education  Lozano received her law degree from the University of La Sabana, located seven miles north of Bogot√° in the city of Ch√≠a. She also received informal education through the Leadership Program at the National Democratic Institute in 2004. In 2010, Lozano participated in the State Department Fellowship of Local and State level governments.  Political life  Lozano's interest in politics and human rights issues began while she was a law school. During her studies, in 1998, she volunteered with the NGO Opci√≥n Colombia in the Puerto Nari√±o - Amazonas region. She worked as a legal advisor to the mayor and focused on indigenous protection. She then worked as an advisor to two independent Senators that were on the commission for Constitutional measures, Ingrid Bettancourt (from 2000-2001) and Antonio Navarro Wolff (from 2001-2005). In 2003, she co-founded the Independent Democratic Pole party, a left-wing political party. Lozano began her own political career in 2005 when she served as Mayor of the Chapinero district of Bogot√° until 2008. Afterwards, in 2011, she was elected to the city council of Bogot√°. In 2014 she was elected to the Chamber of Representatives of Colombia as a Green Alliance Party candidate in Bogot√°, becoming the country's first out LGBT legislator at the national level. In 2011, the Colombian Constitutional Court created a ruling that same-sex couples could register their relationship, under the condition that the country‚Äôs lawmakers do not pursue a bill that would give same-sex couples the same marriage rights as heterosexual couples. Two years after this ruling, the Colombian Senate rejected legislation that would have given the right to marry to same-sex couples. Lozano stated that she will continue to, ‚Äúfight to secure the recognition of gay/lesbian families.‚Äù In August 2014, Senator Viviane Morales began to collect signatures in support of a referendum that would make adoptions of children by same-sex couples beholden to a popular vote of six unrelated individuals. Lozano spoke out against this push for legislation, stating that ‚Äúhuman dignity and fundamental rights are not decided in a referendum.‚Äù Her public opposition to this proposal is another example of her fight for LGBT rights in Colombia. Other than LGBTQ issues, Lozano has supported many other initiatives during her time in office. These issues include: increasing the mobility for bicycle use within the city, political reforms to fight corruption in the government, and she is the current spokeswoman of \\"las veedur√≠as ciudadanas\\" or the citizen's watchdogs. One project that she focused on throughout 2015 focused primarily on Enrivonmental Policy. The main aim of this law project was to create environmental loyalties that would be able to monetarily compensate municipalities for their conservation and mechanisms for which these loyalties can be monitored.  Activism  Lozano, who is an out bisexual, is an activist for LGBT rights. After being elected to the House of Representatives in 2014, Lozano stated that her position shows that the, ‚Äúfight in the name of equality and respect, justice and the recognition of our rights has been achieved.‚Äù Also in May 2014, she took part in a training program in Bogot√° backed by USAID that lasted for four days, from May 30 to June 2. Many other Colombian LGBTQ activists attended alongside a number of US representatives. This training was part of USAID‚Äôs LGBTI Global Development Partnership, which aims to create a network of LGBT advocacy groups with local businesses. This initiative will invest 11 million dollars in LGBT advocacy groups in various developing countries. The program is designed to last for the next four years.  Controversy  So far, Lozano's term has not been without controversy. In 2014, Lozano was shown to be in a relationship with a fellow female senator, Claudia L√≥pez. This relationship sparked a lawsuit from a Colombian senator and Evangelical pastor, Victor Vel√°squez. He cited Article 179 of the Colombian Constitution which states that two people who are in any form of relationship cannot serve in Congress at the same time. Eventually, the charges were dropped after Lozano and L√≥pez countered that the stipulation does not apply due to the illegality of marriage equality and civil unions for same-sex couples in Colombia. Lozano and L√≥pez married in December 2019, following L√≥pez's election as mayor of Bogota.

Biography Gavin was the second son of Peter Gavin, a merchant at Leith, where the painter was born in 1827. He was educated at the Leith High School, and when about twenty-one years of age he entered the School of Design in Edinburgh, and studied under Thomas Duncan. Gavin painted a large number of familiar and rustic subjects, mainly landscape compositions with figures of children, which became very popular. Some of these, such as the Reaping Girl and Ph≈ìbe Mayflower, were reproduced in chromo-lithography. He was elected an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy in 1854. About three years later he appears to have become dissatisfied with his progress as an artist, and entered into partnership with a wine merchant; but after about a year he resumed the practice of his art. He was a regular contributor to the exhibitions of the Royal Scottish Academy, and between 1855 and 1871 exhibited a few pictures at the Royal Academy in London. In 1868 he made a tour in America, and painted several characteristic phases of negro life. Soon after his return home he went to Morocco, and resided for some years at Tangier, where he painted numerous Moorish pictures. In 1879 he became an academician, and presented as his diploma work The Moorish Maiden's First Love, a damsel caressing a beautiful white horse; this picture is now in the collections of the Royal Scottish Academy of Art & Architecture. He returned to Scotland in 1880, and continued to paint subjects of Moorish life and manners until his death, which took place at his residence, Cherry Bank, Newhaven, near Edinburgh, on 5 Oct. 1883.

At its founding it consisted of a group of young noblemen with humanistic and literary inclinations, who were also musical amateurs, coming together to perform and study music. While it was not the first academy in Renaissance Italy ‚Äì many academies were formed during the Renaissance to discuss intellectual, cultural, and humanistic issues ‚Äì it was the earliest specifically musical academy of the Renaissance. History The academy was founded on 1 May 1543 by the merging of two previous groups, the Incatenata and a previous Filarmonica.Enrinco Paganuzzi, \\"Verona.\\" Oxford Music Online, (subscription access) (accessed 6 January 2012). In its earliest incarnation, it was a small group of artists and musicians who assembled to perform and discuss music, largely for their own pleasure, with their meetings including abundant food and wine. The founders of the group were young members of Verona's aristocratic families. The six \\"regents\\" of the club took turns leading it, with their terms limited to two months. Before long they recognized the need to hire a professional teacher and composer as their maesto di musica, and in 1547 they contracted Jan Nasco, a Franco-Flemish composer from the Low Countries, to instruct them.Einstein, 192-3Howard Mayer Brown/Iain Fenlon, \\"Academy.\\" Oxford Music Online, (subscription access) (accessed 6 January 2012). Nasco's duties were strict. The group met daily, and each evening he was to instruct the members in singing, if they wished; even if they did not want instruction, he was required to be present at their meetings. He was to compose music for any poem given to him by a member of the academy, and his compositions became the property of the academy. They gave him an annual salary of 30 ducats and lodging in their palazzo. During the hours prior to nones (three o'clock) he had free time, but if a majority of the members wanted his services he was required to be available. Nasco left his post after about four years, when the members attempted to cut his salary. However, he retained friendly relations with them, sending them numerous letters from Treviso, where he obtained another job. The academy next hired Vincenzo Ruffo to fill the post, but found him negligent in his duties and kept him for only nine months. Next to fill the post was the Frenchman Lambert Courtois.Einstein, 462 Some of the other notable musicians who served as maestro di musica for the academy in the 16th century included Alessandro Romano, Ippolito Chamater√≤, Pedro Valenzuela, and Paolo Bellasio. The academy flourished with little competition for the first twenty years of its existence, having regular meetings, giving public performances, and having an annual celebratory mass at a local church ‚Äì always freshly composed ‚Äì on the anniversary of their founding (1 May). While they were initially a private club, rarely admitting outside visitors, they increased the number of public performances over the years, expanding their reputation. Their influence can be seen in the extraordinary number of books of music dedicated to them: of all the books of madrigals dedicated to academies in Italy in the 16th century ‚Äì out of over two hundred academies ‚Äì fully half were dedicated to the Veronese Accademia Filarmonica. By the late 1560s the influence of the academy was beginning to wane, with competition from other academies and groups, in particular those gathered around the most influential Veronese music patron of the time, Count Mario Bevilacqua.Einstein, 193 Other Veronese academies in the 16th century ‚Äì not all named Accademia, as some were named ridotto (retreat) ‚Äì included the Accademia dei Moderati, the Accademia dei Novelli, and the ridotto Ridolfi, in addition to the ridotto of Bevilacqua. Yet another, the Accademia alla Vittoria merged with the Accademia Filarmonica in 1564, also for a period the Accademia Filarmonica was based at the Counts Giusti in Verona.* Francesco Pona: Sileno overo Delle Bellezze del Luogo dell'Ill.mo Sig. Co. Gio. Giacomo Giusti, 1620 Angelo Tamo, Verona The academy continued, with a changing character, through the next centuries. In 1732, it built the famous Teatro Filarmonico, long considered to be one of the most beautiful theatres in Italy. The 14-year-old Mozart visited in December 1770 during his first trip to Italy with his father (it was during this visit that Saverio della Rosa painted the famous portrait of him). The Teatro Filarmonico was destroyed on 23 February 1945, during a bombing raid late in the Second World War, and was rebuilt during the 1960s. Present-day In the present day, the academy both provides a venue for concerts and organizes performances. Part of its mission is presenting Renaissance and Baroque music. In addition to hosting live performances, the Accademia maintains a museum and library, with sections both on 16th- and 19th-century music. Many of the original musical instruments used during the early years of the academy are housed in the museum. Notes References * Francesco Pona: Sileno overo Delle Bellezze del Luogo dell'Ill.mo Sig.

The DELES was developed in 2003. The DELES was designed to measure students' perceptions of their distance education social environment through six scales: # Instructor Support (Scale I, consisting of 8 items), (e.g. The instructor responds promptly to my questions). # Student Interaction and Collaboration (Scale II, consisting of 6 items), (e.g. I collaborate with other students in the class). # Personal Relevance (Scale III, consisting of 7 items), (e.g. I can relate what I learn to my life outside of university). # Authentic Learning (Scale IV, consisting of 5 items), (e.g. I work on assignments that deal with real-world information). # Active Learning (Scale V, consisting of 3 items), (e.g. I explore my own strategies for learning). # Student Autonomy (Scale VI, consisting of 5 items), (e.g. I play an important role in my learning. An additional eight-item scale of student affect (psychology), designated the Enjoyment scale, was included in the original DELES. An example item in this seventh scale reads, \\"I enjoy studying by distance education.\\" The 42 DELES items have response value options of: Never, Seldom, Sometimes, Often, and Always. The DELES focuses on students' perceptions of the learning environment to the exclusion of technical factors such as Internet connectivity or learning platform as found in other distance education learning environment instruments. Applications of the DELES The DELES has been utilized in the United States to compare social work students' perceptions of their learning environments in a face-to-face class, a blended learning (hybrid) class, and an asynchronous learning distance education version of the same class. It has also been translated into Chinese and used to identify motivation of Taiwanese adult distance education learners. The DELES has been translated into Arabic and used to determine undergraduate students' perceptions of blended learning in the Arab Open University-Bahrain Branch. The DELES has also been translated into Turkish and used to study Turkish online learning environments‚Äîthis version is referred to as the Turkish DELES (TR-DELES). A Spanish version, referred to as the Spanish DELES (Sp-DELES) has been validated and utilized with Spanish students. A Portuguese version of the DELES was developed and administered in 2009. Significance of the DELES The DELES is significant in the realm of post-secondary distance education because it was the first instrument available to seek associations between the psychosocial learning environment and student satisfaction with their distance education class. By statistically measuring associations between the six DELES scales and the scale of ‚ÄúEnjoyment,‚Äù researchers have been able to determine that Personal Relevance is the strongest positive and statistically significant contributor to student satisfaction in distance education in one setting. The Turkish DELES (TR-DELES) researchers discovered that, with their population, student satisfaction was more closely aligned statistically with Instructor Support. Conversely, the Spanish determined, with the Spanish DELES (Sp-DELES), that Active Learning and Autonomy are most influential on distance education student satisfaction. With the Portuguese version of the DELES it was determined that Student Interaction and Collaboration was most closely aligned with student satisfaction in Education courses. The DELES has consistently held up well in terms of validity and reliability in 27 independent studies, including studies where the DELES has been translated into Mandarin, Turkish, Arabic and Spanish. It has been modified for use in Malaysia and Palestine. Forms In addition to aiding researchers in associating psychosocial aspects with student satisfaction, the DELES has three forms. The same scales are used and the items are parallel; however, the wording is slightly different: * Actual form ‚Äì This is the original DELES used to determine what students perceive during a class. An item would read: ‚ÄúIn this class the instructor responds promptly.‚Äù * Preferred form ‚Äì This version is used to capture what students would like their distance learning class to be like. The same item would read: ‚ÄúIn this class I would prefer the instructor to respond promptly.‚Äù * Instructor form ‚Äì This version is used to capture the instructor‚Äôs perception of their class. The same item would read: ‚ÄúIn my class I respond promptly.‚Äù Results can be studied in various ways to gain an in- depth picture of the psychosocial nature of a given distance education learning environment. For instance, the instructor's perspective can be compared to those of the students to see how closely they are aligned or not aligned. Or, the Preferred form can be administered as a pre-test and the Actual form as a post-test and the results analysed for differences and changes.

In a career that lasted from May 1859 to July 1861, he ran twenty-four times and won fourteen races. He was regarded by experts as one of the outstanding horses of his era. After winning nine races, including the Gimcrack Stakes at York as a two-year-old in 1859 he won The Derby on his first start of 1860. Although he failed to reproduce his best form in the autumn of his three-year- old season, he returned in 1861 to win his first four races including the Ascot Gold Cup. At the end of the 1861 season, he was retired to stud where he sired the winners of many important races. His grandson, Bend Or, became the direct male ancestor of most modern Thoroughbred racehorses. Background Alice Hawthorn. The winner of 52 races and Thormanby's dam Thormanby was a lean, wiry, rather plain-looking chestnut horse with a white stripe and a white sock on his left hind leg. He was bred by Benjamin Plummer who had difficulty finding a buyer for the young horse as a yearling at the Doncaster sales before selling him privately for ¬£350 to the trainer Mathew Dawson. Dawson bought the colt for his principal patron James Merry, who was initially reluctant to complete the transaction. Dawson had to keep and feed the horse at his own expense for several months before Merry agreed to hand over the money. Dawson trained the colt at Russley Park, near Lambourn. Thormanby's dam was the outstanding race mare Alice Hawthorn (left), who won fifty-two races including the Goodwood and Doncaster Cups. The identity of his sire was officially problematic, as Alice Hawthorn was covered by two stallions, Windhound and Melbourne in 1856. Melbourne, the sire of the Triple Crown winner West Australian was, however, true-breeding bay, meaning that all his registered offspring were bay or brown. It is almost certain, therefore, that the chestnut Thormanby was a son of the less famous Windhound. This view was supported by the testimony of Mathew Dawson, who was working at the stud at the time of Thormanby's conception: he reported that Alice Hawthorn had rejected Melbourne, but been receptive to Windhound. Racing career 1859: two-year-old season Thormanby, like many of Dawson's horses, was highly tried as a two-year-old, running fourteen times. In spring he won minor races at Northampton, York and Chester and finished third to Lupellus at Epsom. The Field described him as \\"by far the best\\" of the early two-year- olds. At Royal Ascot in June Thormanby won a Biennial Stakes, beating Lupellus, and then finished second to Rupee in a field of twenty runners for the New Stakes. At Goodwood in July, he ran twice, winning the Lavant Stakes and finishing third in the Findon Stakes. He ran three times at the York meeting in August, running third in the Convivial Stakes and then winning the Eglington Stakes and the meeting's premier two-year-old race, the Gimcrack Stakes. In Autumn, Thormanby was sent to race at Newmarket, where he ran three times. He finished third in the Eglington Stakes and then won the Prendergast Stakes. On his final start of the year, he recorded his second important win, beating seven rivals to win the valuable Criterion Stakes by a length. 1860: three-year-old season James Merry, Thormanby's owner, who initially refused to pay for the future Derby winner Thormanby did not run as a three-year-old before the Derby. In spring, a colt named \\"The Wizard\\" won the 2000 Guineas in impressive style and was made favourite for the Derby. Thormanby, however, had been performing exceptionally well in training, notably when giving thirteen pounds and a decisive beating to a good colt called Northern Light. When Dawson was told that The Wizard had proved himself to be a \\"tremendous horse\\", he replied, \\"Who's afraid?\\" Dawson did, in fact, fear that attempts would be made to deliberately injure or \\"nobble\\" Thormanby and took steps to protect him, including switching his jockeys' racing colours at the last moment to confuse any potential assailants. At Epsom on 23 May, Thormanby impressed observers when he appeared in the paddock before the Derby: his coat was \\"like a mirror\\" and as he galloped to the start, he \\"hardly seemed to touch the ground.\\" He started the 4/1 second favourite in a field of thirty runners, with The Wizard being made 3/1 favourite and the American-bred colt Umpire, whose supporters included the famous boxer John C. Heenan, being also strongly fancied. The attendance for the race was estimated at up to 480,000. Ridden by Harry Custance, a lightweight jockey who had to carry twenty-two pounds of lead in his saddle to make the required weight, Thormanby raced just behind the leaders in the early stages before making his challenge on the outside early in the straight. A furlong from the finish Thormanby overtook The Wizard and went into the lead, from which point on the result was not in doubt. Thormanby won easily by one and a half lengths from The Wizard, with the outsider Horror taking third. James Merry reportedly took more than ¬£85,000 in winning bets. Thormanby was rested after the Derby before returning in September for the St Leger for which he started 9/4 favourite in a field of fourteen. Thormanby held third place turning into the straight but faded in the closing stages and finished fifth, four lengths behind the winner St Albans. Two days later Thormanby reappeared in the Doncaster Cup over two and a half miles. He was held up in the early stages before making a strong challenge in the straight, but was beaten three lengths by Sabreur, to whom he was conceding seven pounds. He was then sent to Newmarket where he was beaten two lengths by The Wizard at level weights in the Grand Duke Michael Stakes on 25 September. On his final run of the year he finished second in a sweepstakes at Newmarket. 1861: four-year-old season Thormanby's four-year-old season began at Newmarket in April, when he won the Claret Stakes, finishing thirty lengths clear of his two rivals. At the next Newmarket meeting Thormanby claimed two prizes without having to run in a competitive race. No horse appeared to oppose him and he was allowed to \\"walk over\\" in both events. At Royal Ascot in June, Thormanby contested the two and a half mile Ascot Gold Cup, at that time the most prestigious weight-for-age race of the season. He started the 6/5 favourite, with St Albans and Parmesan being regarded as his main rivals. Thormanby raced lazily, so that Custance had to \\"waken him up\\" by using his spurs, but in the straight he produced a strong run to overtake Parmesan and easily held the late challenge of the filly Fairwater to win by two lengths. On his final race, Thormanby ran poorly, finishing unplaced in the Goodwood Cup. Assessment In May 1886 The Sporting Times carried out a poll of one hundred racing experts to create a ranking of the best British racehorses of the 19th century. Thormanby was ranked seventeenth, having been placed in the top ten by sixteen of the contributors. He was the third highest British horse the 1860s behind Gladiateur and West Australian. At the end of his racing career, The Field described Thormanby as Stud career Thormanby stood as a stallion at Croft stud, near Darlington, Park Paddocks at Newmarket and the Moorlands stud near York. He was a successful stallion, siring the 2000 Guineas winners Atlantic and Charibert and being the Champion sire of 1869. He is present in the pedigrees of almost all modern Thoroughbreds through his daughter, Rouge Rose, who produced the Derby Winner Bend Or. Thormanby sired almost a hundred winners before dying suddenly at the age of eighteen in 1875. Thormanby's tail was mounted and fashioned into a whisk which was hung in the hall of Mathew Dawson's Heath House at Newmarket.

The presumption is that they are therefore generally eligible to vote, although other additional factors may cause them to be ineligible, such as lack of citizenship or a prior felony conviction. In estimating voter turnout the voting age population for a political unit is often used as the denominator for the number of individuals eligible to vote in a given election; this method has been shown to lose in accuracy when a larger percentage of the VAP is ineligible to vote. In the United States individuals become eligible to vote in political elections at age 18.  Voter file usage  In the context of voter files used for political organizing, VAP has a slightly different meaning and refers individuals who reside in a geography and who are not currently registered to vote, because under normal circumstances only individuals who are registered to vote would be included in political communications (due to cost efficiency). These VAP records are typically identified by matching a commercial marketing database to state voter registration data and flagging records which are not found to be registered to vote. Political organizations can then use those flags to include or exclude unregistered individuals in target lists for political organizing programs, such as communications that encourage voter registration or voter turnout.

In 1597 the school was heavily damaged during the Second Japanese Invasion. In 1695 it was moved to the present site and restored with the help of Confucian students from Seongdong town. The hyanggyo consists of two parts: first, the Myeongnyundang (lecture hall), which contains the Oesam outer gate and the east and west dormitories. The second is the ritual area that includes the Naesam inner gate, Daeseongjeon (Confucian shrine hall), and the east and west Mu. This style of structure forms a Jeonhakhumyo, which means that lecture hall is placed in the front and the ritual hall in the rear. Jeonhakhumyo-type hyanggyos are situated on gently-sloping sites to emphasize the sacredness of the Confucian shrine. Sujik House, next to the Hyanggyo, houses Confucian students. According to the current curator, the Goheung Hyanggyo was the wealthiest of the Confucian schools during the period just prior to the occupation. During the second occupation, the funds of the Goheung Hyanggyo were confiscated and used to build schools in the area. The occupying Japanese government took credit for building the schools, though the funds used to build the schools were actually those confiscated from the Goheung Hyanggyo. Rituals are held here every month at dawn; at those times, participants gather in the afternoons and evenings prior, staying overnight in the east dormitory and preparing for the next morning's ceremony.

Biography Early life and career Syech Albar 1939, father of Ahmad Albar Albar was born in Surabaya, East Java on 16 July 1946 to Syech Albar and his wife Farida Alhasni. Both of his parents were of Arab descent. He was the couple's fourth child. In 1958 he played in the film Djenderal Kantjil (General Kancil). Albar moved to the Netherlands in 1965. In 1970 he sang \\"Don't Spoil My Day\\" and \\"Tell Me the World\\" with Clover Leaf, which charted. After his return to Indonesia, he founded God Bless with Jockie Soerjoprajogo, Fuad Hassan, Donny Fattah, and his friend from Clover Leaf, Ludwig Lemans; Albar was lead vocalist. The band's first performance was in Taman Ismail Marzuki on 5 May 1973, and on 16 August 1973 they held the Summer 28 concert, the first (and, as of 2004, largest) open-air concert in Indonesia. The band, with Albar, also played in the 1973 comedy Ambisi (Ambition), directed by Nya Abbas Akup. God Bless In 1975, Albar and God Bless opened for Deep Purple at a concert in Jakarta. On 27 September 1975, Albar appeared on the cover of Tempo, with a full feature on him inside; the coverage compared his costume to Zorro's and described him spinning the microphone over his head as if he were competing in a hammer throw event. Other magazines, such as Junior, Aktuil, and Top, soon followed; Aktuil named him the best vocalist of 1976. In 1976, Albar and God Bless released their first album, Huma di atas Bukit (House on the Hill). The titular song was an adaptation of \\"Firth Of Fifth\\", from Genesis' 1973 album Selling England by the Pound. The same year Albar played in Laila Majenun (Laila is Possessed), directed by Sjumandjaja; \\"Huma di atas Bukit\\" was used as its theme song. Duo Kribo and other projects The following year, Albar recorded \\"Neraka Jahanam\\" (\\"Blasted Hell\\"), a duet with Ucok Harahap released on an album of the same name; the two called themselves Duo Kribo, based on their frizzy hair. The titular song was based in the concept of original sin. That same year he recorded \\"Jelaga\\" (\\"Soot\\"), a winner of Prambors FM's Teenage Song Writing Competition. Duo Kribo released their second album, Pelacur Tua (Old Prostitute), in 1978. Albar was then invited by Guruh Soekarnoputra to perform the song \\"Anak Jalanan\\" (\\"Street Children\\") at Guruh's Swara Mahardhika concert; it ran from 6 to 7 January 1979. Later in 1979 he and Harahap released their third album, Panggung Sandiwara (Theatre Stage), featuring compositions by former God Bless member Ian Antono and lyrics by poet Taufiq Ismail. He also recorded a dangdut album, Zakia, that year; the album featured six compositions by Albar and three by other artists, including Antono and Titiek Puspa. Albar later appeared in the film Irama Cinta (Rhythm of Love) along with dangdut singer Elvy Sukaesih; the pair sang five songs together. Afterwards, in 1980, God Bless released their second album, Cermin (Mirror). With God Bless later going into limbo, Albar recorded two solo albums, Dunia Huru-Hara (World of Commotion) and Syair Kehidupan (Poems of Life); he also recorded an album with Fariz RM, entitled Secita Cerita (An Idea for a Story). In 1983, Albar sang \\"Rahasia Semesta\\" (\\"Secret of the Universe\\") at the 11th National Pop Music Festival. In early 1990, Albar formed Gong 2000 with Yaya Muktio, Harry Anggoman, Donny Fattah, and Ian Antono. Their first concert, held in Senayan, Jakarta, on 26 October 1991, attracted 100,000 viewers. Together the group released four albums, Bara Timur (Ember of the East; 1991), Gong Live (1992), Laskar (Screen; 1993), and Prahara (Tempest; 2000). During the same period he was still active with God Bless, releasing Semut Hitam (Black Ants; 1988), Raksasa (Monster; 1989), and Apa Kabar? (What's Up?; 1997). Focus on God Bless In 2003, Albar and Jockie had a large fight which led to Jockie leaving the group. According to a 2011 interview with Jockie, Jockie and some fellow band members had been discussing Albar's drug habit when they decided to ask Albar to abandon drugs. When Jockie did so, Albar reportedly pulled a pistol on him. Guitarist Ian Antono confirmed that a pistol was involved, but he thought it could be a toy; he stated that the argument flared up when Jockie insulted Albar's family. On 7 February 2004, Albar and a group of Indonesian performers, including Glenn Fredly, Armand Maulana of Gigi, and Duta of Sheila on 7, held a concert to commemorate the founding of the Malaysian rock band Search. At the end of the concert the singers sang \\"Rumah Kita\\" (\\"Our House\\"), from Semut Hitam. In November 2007, Albar was arrested for possessing ecstasy and hiding a drug dealer. Tried in June 2008, he was convicted and sentenced to eight months in prison. He was paroled in July for good behaviour and counting previous time served. In the middle of 2009, Albar and God Bless released 36th. Later, in October of that year, Albar participated in a tribute concert to Chrisye, entitled \\"Chrisye: A Night to Remember\\". With God Bless, in mid-2010 he went on a national tour sponsored by PT Multi Bintang Indonesia Niaga. In June 2011, the band performed for Hard Rock Cafe Jakarta's 40th anniversary. The following month, from 22 to 24 July 2011, he and God Bless performed at the InterMusic Java Rockin' Land alongside The Cranberries and Neon Trees. Legacy In a 2009 issue, Rolling Stone Indonesia ranked several songs which Albar sang or wrote as being among the 150 best Indonesian songs of all time. God Bless' song \\"Kehidupan\\" (\\"Life\\"), which he sang, was ranked 8th, while \\"Rumah Kita\\" (\\"Our House\\") was ranked 22nd. Duo Kribo's song \\"Neraka Jahanam\\" was ranked 18th, while \\"Panggung Sandiwara\\" was ranked 21st. Gong 2000's song \\"Kepada Perang\\" (\\"To War\\") was ranked 114th. Personal life Albar married Rini S. Bono on 28 April 1978; she had previously acted with him in Laila Majenun, with whom he has three children. They divorced on 30 September 1994. In May 2011 it was reported that he would be marrying Dewi, his girlfriend, while going on the hajj. Albar is a maternal half-brother of dangdut singer Camelia Malik and father of actor Fachri Albar. His sons Ozzy and Fachri Albar are also musicians, playing in the band Jibriel; his nephew Bagoes is also a member of the band.

Production  The second season made frequent use of flashbacks, revealing Bartlet's campaign for the presidency in the period prior to events covered in the first season. The first two episodes, \\"In the Shadow of Two Gunmen, Part I and \\"In the Shadow of Two Gunmen, Part II\\", showed how many of the central characters were introduced to Josiah Bartlet, his campaign for the presidential nomination, and his election. Aaron Sorkin originally planned to have such flashbacks as a major part of the entire season, but budget and logistical demands prevented this.  Cast  The second season had star billing for eight major roles. Seven of these were filled by returning main cast members from the first season, while Moira Kelly departed the cast at the end of the previous season. Rob Lowe once again receives star billing, while Martin Sheen receives the \\"and\\" credit for his role as President Josiah Bartlet. The rest of the ensemble, now including previously recurring Janel Moloney, are credited alphabetically.  Main cast  * Rob Lowe as Sam Seaborn, Deputy Communications Director * Dul√© Hill as Charlie Young, Personal Aide to the President * Allison Janney as C. J. Cregg, White House Press Secretary * Janel Moloney as Donna Moss, Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff * Richard Schiff as Toby Ziegler, Communications Director * John Spencer as Leo McGarry, White House Chief of Staff * Bradley Whitford as Josh Lyman, Deputy Chief of Staff * Martin Sheen as Josiah Bartlet, President of the United States  Recurring cast  * Stockard Channing as Abbey Bartlet, First Lady of the United States * Kathryn Joosten as Dolores Landingham, Executive Secretary to the President * Elisabeth Moss as Zoey Bartlet, The President's youngest daughter * Tim Matheson as John Hoynes, Vice President of the United States * John Amos as Percy Fitzwallace, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff * NiCole Robinson as Margaret Hooper, Assistant to the White House Chief of Staff  Plot  The second season details the period between the end of President Bartlet's second year in office and the middle of his third. It covers a wider legislative array than the first season does, and presents issues including the rights of hate groups and the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. In this season, The West Wing characters are shown as being more capable of legislating thanks to an increased approval rating (described as a temporary \\"bubble\\" due to the shooting that ends the first season). Also vital to this theme is the new doctrine for legislating laid out in the first-season episode \\"Let Bartlet Be Bartlet.\\" The multiple sclerosis arc (also introduced in the first season) becomes central late in the second season as staff members are introduced one- by-one to the President's ailment and the public made aware. This theme remains central to the entire series. Mrs. Landingham, the longtime secretary of President Bartlet, dies in the penultimate episode, \\"18th and Potomac.\\" In the final episode, \\"Two Cathedrals,\\" Mrs. Landingham's funeral is central as is the question of whether the President will run for re-election. The season ends with the President announcing his multiple sclerosis, and concludes just moments before he answers a reporter's question: \\"Mr. President, can you tell us right now if you'll be seeking a second term?\\"  Episodes  Reception The second season received 18 Emmy Award nominations for the 53rd Primetime Emmy Awards, winning a total of 8 awards. Consecutive wins included Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (Allison Janney), Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (Thomas Schlamme for \\"In the Shadow of Two Gunmen\\"), and Outstanding Cinematography for a Single Camera Series (Thomas Del Ruth). Bradley Whitford won for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, and the series also won for Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series, Outstanding Single Camera Picture Editing for a Series, and Outstanding Single Camera Sound Mixing for a Series. Notable nominations included Martin Sheen and Rob Lowe for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, John Spencer and Richard Schiff for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, Stockard Channing for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, Oliver Platt for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series, Aaron Sorkin for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for \\"In the Shadow of Two Gunmen\\", and Laura Innes for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for \\"Shibboleth\\".

Production  The season premiere was delayed by the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. When the season did return, the first episode was a special episode titled \\"Isaac and Ishmael,\\" in which the main cast paid tribute to those affected by the attacks and informed viewers about what to expect from the delayed premiere.

Other prominent story lines include a Congressional investigation into allegations Bartlet committed electoral fraud by concealing his MS, a death threat against C.J. and the ensuing relationship she develops with the Secret Service agent assigned to protect her, and Qumari defense minister Abdul Shareef's planning of terrorist attacks against the US. The season finale resolves several of these story lines when Bartlet meets his electoral opponent and reaffirms his commitment to defeat him, finally decides to order Shareef's assassination, and, just minutes after the man who threatened her is arrested, C.J.'s Secret Service agent interrupts a convenience store robbery and is killed.  Episodes  Specials Two special episodes, not part of the official continuity, were produced to complement the series and were broadcast on NBC. Both episodes ran within the third season and were included on the season's DVD. \\"Isaac and Ishmael\\" Written by series creator Aaron Sorkin and directed by Christopher Misiano, this episode was a terrorism-themed episode produced in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The episode pushed the scheduled season premiere back a week and encouraged viewers to donate to charity‚Äîprofits from the episode and cast members' weekly pay were also donated. The episode \\"was written and produced in record time\\"--less than three weeks--and aired on October 3, 2001. Although timely and well-intentioned, the episode was criticized by James Poniewozik for being condescending and preachy. \\"Documentary Special\\" The second special interspersed the characters' fictional lives with interviews of real West Wing personnel, including Presidents Ford, Carter, and Clinton; press secretaries Marlin Fitzwater and Dee Dee Myers; presidential advisors David Gergen, Paul Begala, and incumbent Karl Rove; Secretary of State Henry Kissinger; Chief of Staff Leon Panetta; presidential personal secretary Betty Currie; and speechwriter Peggy Noonan. The documentary won a Primetime Emmy Award in 2002 for \\"Outstanding Special Class Program\\". Reception The third season received 21 Emmy Award nominations for the 54th Primetime Emmy Awards, the most-nominated season, winning a total of 4 awards. The series won its third consecutive award for Outstanding Drama Series and Allison Janney also won her third consecutive award, this time in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category. John Spencer and Stockard Channing each won for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series, respectively, after being nominated twice before. The season received several acting nominations, which included Martin Sheen for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series; Dul√© Hill, Richard Schiff, and Bradley Whitford for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series; Janel Moloney and Mary-Louise Parker for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series; Mark Harmon, Tim Matheson, and Ron Silver for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series.

Production  After the difficulties Aaron Sorkin encountered in writing Season 3, he saw Season 4 as a return to the form he and the show had previously enjoyed, saying \\"[we] came back to work, after the hiatus, and didn't feel any of that, just felt the week-to-week pressure of trying to write well.\\" In 2003, at the end of the fourth season, Sorkin and fellow executive producer Thomas Schlamme left the show due to internal conflicts at Warner Bros. TV not involving the NBC network, thrusting producer John Wells into an expanded role as showrunner. Rob Lowe departed the series after episode 17, saying he was not happy with his character Sam Seaborn and believed he did not fit in the show anymore. On December 11, 2015, in an interview with the Archive of American Television, producer John Wells said that Sorkin was unhappy with two of the cast members, and wanted one in particular removed from the show. NBC disagreed, but Sorkin \\"just stopped writing the character.\\" As the season progressed, with ratings cresting and episodes consistently going over-budget, Wells told Sorkin he would have to be more responsive to the demands of the network and the studio. When a meeting with Warner Bros. executives, backed by NBC, was held at the end of the season, Sorkin declined to make any changes to the way he worked, and quit the show.  Cast  The fourth season had star billing for ten major roles. Nine of these were filled by returning main cast members from the third season.

The season begins with the continuation of the election storyline with the president touring the nation and his staff trying to firm up presidential debates. The storyline ends in a clear victory for Bartlet less than halfway through the season in \\"Election Night\\". Other plots include Sam leaving the White House to run in a special election in California, the news of the Abdul Shareef assassination resonating both inside and outside the U.S., Will Bailey taking Sam's position after coming over from the California campaign's staff, the President and his staff facing the reality of an overseas genocide, and Vice President Hoynes being forced to resign after a sex scandal is uncovered. The fourth season ends with Bartlet's youngest daughter being taken hostage. Bartlet ends up invoking the 25th Amendment in the final episode, \\"Twenty Five.\\" Since no one had been nominated to replace Hoynes, the presidency passes to the iron willed conservative Republican Speaker of the House, Glen Allen Walken.  Episodes  Reception The fourth season received 15 Emmy Award nominations for the 55th Primetime Emmy Awards, winning a total of 2 awards.

He was appointed to the Senate of Canada on January 17, 2012, by Stephen Harper after losing in the 2011 Canadian federal election running as a Conservative Candidate in Saint-Hyacinthe‚ÄîBagot. He represents the Senate division of Victoria (Quebec). Political career Dagenais ran for a seat to the House of Commons of Canada under the Conservative banner in the 2011 Canadian federal election in Saint-Hyacinthe‚ÄîBagot. He was defeated finishing third place out of five candidates behind winner Marie-Claude Morin and defeated incumbent √àve-Mary Tha√Ø Thi Lac. Prime Minister Stephen Harper advised Governor General David Johnston to appoint Dagenais to the Senate of Canada on January 6, 2012, and he was subsequently appointed on January 17. On November 18, 2019, Dagenais announced that he was quitting the Conservative's Senate caucus to join the Canadian Senators Group due to disagreements with the leadership of Andrew Scheer, concerns over the former's social views and the \\"low importance\\" attached to Quebec voters by party leadership as the reasons for his defection. However, he is keeping his individual membership to the Conservative Party itself. Senate scandal In response to ongoing criticism of the Senate stemming from the Mike Duffy scandal, Dagenais railed against NDP MP Charmaine Borg, in a letter to the House of Commons accusing her of being a whiny, useless puppet who would not have won election if not for sympathy for Jack Layton, and of ignorance of the constitution for her support of the NDP position on abolishing the Senate. Dagenais was unapologetic for his insults and for his incorrect claim that Borg was wrong to note that the NDP supports abolition, both despite the fact that he himself was appointed to Senate after losing an election, and was the one who was wrong about NDP policy. In response, Borg launched an official complaint against the Senator.

Planning for the memorial began in 1999, and the memorial was dedicated in 2004. The memorial is in Oak Ridge Cemetery, located on the north side of Springfield, Illinois, the state capital. The memorial is a multi- element sculptural installation that centers on a 22-ton (20-tonne) white globe 12 feet (3.5m) in diameter, demonstrating the global nature of the conflict. Spreading outward from the globe are a series of black granite walls into which the names of various battles and campaigns of the war are incised. Stainless steel buttons inserted into the globe pinpoint the locations of the battles. As of 2012, frequent tribute observances gather together representatives from the diminishing headcount of veterans of this conflict. The executive board of the memorial also organizes efforts to collect oral memories from survivors. In some cases, relatives seeking information about their missing kin may contact the Memorial's executive board.

Explicitly, for any additive endomorphism f, if fg = gf for every R endomorphism g, then there exists an r in R such that f(x) = xr for all x in M. In the case of non- balanced modules, there will be such an f that is not expressible this way. In the language of centralizers, a balanced module is one satisfying the conclusion of the double centralizer theorem, that is, the only endomorphisms of the group M commuting with all the R endomorphisms of M are the ones induced by right multiplication by ring elements. A ring is called balanced if every right R module is balanced.The definitions of balanced rings and modules appear in , , , and . It turns out that being balanced is a left-right symmetric condition on rings, and so there is no need to prefix it with \\"left\\" or \\"right\\". The study of balanced modules and rings is an outgrowth of the study of QF-1 rings by C.J. Nesbitt and R. M. Thrall. This study was continued in V. P. Camillo's dissertation, and later it became fully developed. The paper gives a particularly broad view with many examples. In addition to these references, K. Morita and H. Tachikawa have also contributed published and unpublished results. A partial list of authors contributing to the theory of balanced modules and rings can be found in the references. Examples and properties ;Examples * Semisimple rings are balanced. * Every nonzero right ideal over a simple ring is balanced. * Every faithful module over a quasi- Frobenius ring is balanced. * The double centralizer theorem for right Artinian rings states that any simple right R module is balanced. * The paper contains numerous constructions of nonbalanced modules. * It was established in that uniserial rings are balanced. Conversely, a balanced ring which is finitely generated as a module over its center is uniserial. * Among commutative Artinian rings, the balanced rings are exactly the quasi-Frobenius rings. ;Properties * Being \\"balanced\\" is a categorical property for modules, that is, it is preserved by Morita equivalence. Explicitly, if F(‚Äì) is a Morita equivalence from the category of R modules to the category of S modules, and if M is balanced, then F(M) is balanced. * The structure of balanced rings is also completely determined in , and is outlined in . * In view of the last point, the property of being a balanced ring is a Morita invariant property. * The question of which rings have all finitely generated right R modules balanced has already been answered. This condition turns out to be equivalent to the ring R being balanced.

Dedicated to Martin of Tours, the building was constructed in the 12th century with 13th and 15th- century additions and restoration carried out in the late 19th century. It is a Grade I listed building. Nave looking towards the chancel and the east end The nave and chancel are of early Norman construction and built of flint with a plain tiled roof. The aisle to the north of the nave is Early English and is constructed of flint and local rag-stone. It was enlarged in the 1880s. The adjacent chapel on the north side of the chancel and the porch on the south side of the nave are Perpendicular Gothic. The tower is built in two stages of galletted rag-stone with diagonal corner buttresses. The timber-shingled broach spire was added in 1861 by R. C. Hussey. The roof structure to the chapel is original, but the rest of the roof was replaced in the 19th century. The church windows are of varying sizes and periods although mostly perpendicular in style. Over the doorway on the west side of the tower is a large rectangular three-lighted perpendicular window added in the 19th century. The windows to the nave, aisle and chapel are mainly two-lighted in design. Those to the south-east and east of the chancel and three-lighted. Internally, the nave and aisle are separated by a pair of wide plain arches and the chancel and chapel by a single arch. The large twelve-sided font is early and plain and stands on a 20th-century base, having once been built into the wall of the tower. An ornately carved four-sided oak lectern dates from 1340-50. It probably came from Boxley Abbey and has been described as \\"the finest medieval fitting in any parish church in the county\\". The church's pipe organ dates from the 1850s and was brought from the Congregational Church in Maidstone in 1973. The churchyard contains a headstone and a table tomb that are Grade II listed.

It narrates the childhood of Alexander the Great, son of king Philip II of Macedon and queen Olympias. He is tutored by the great Greek philosopher Aristotle until the age of 16 and, also thank to the friendship of Hephaiston and Ptolemy, he becomes a most charismatic and mighty warrior, ready to take on the challenge of expanding the Macedonian Empire following the assassination of his father. Plot The story starts before the birth of Alexander at Pella, when his mother Queen Olympias dreams of a snake slithering inside her bed and thrusting its seed inside her; when she recounts her dream to the priests of the Oracle of Dodona, they tell her that her child shall be the offspring of Zeus and a man, just like his hero Achilles. On the day that Alexander was born, his father Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies, and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It would later come to be said that on this day the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down because Artemis was away, attending the birth of Alexander. During his childhood, Alexander and his friends Hephaestion, Ptolemy, Seleucus, Leonnatus, Lysimachus, Craterus, Perdiccas and Philotas, are firstly educated by Leonidas. He teaches them the values of courage and pride, but also magnanimity; this would prove very important to Alexander during his campaigns. When Alexander is 13 years old, his father decides to send him (and his friends with him) to Mieza, a nearby town, for him to be tutored by Aristotle. The great philosopher teaches Alexander and his friends all the latest notions of science, philosophy and literature. Leptine, a girl that Alexander himself had saved from slavery, also joins the boys in Mieza; she will also stay very close to Alexander until his death. When back into his hometown Pella, Alexander manages to tame a wild war horse at his first attempt. He calls his horse Bucephalus and he grows very fond of him. So much so that the two share an almost human friendship. Finally, Alexander is old enough to go to war with his father's army in Cheronea, where they are victorious. Alexander greatly admires his father and his military achievements. He is also very close to his sister, Cleopatra, and to his mother. However, when Philip marries Eurydice Alexander grows harsher towards his father but much closer to his mother, jealous and unhappy about the polygamy of Philip. Things go out of hand during the banquet of the wedding, when Alexander, after Attalus offends his mother Olympias, insults Attalus and his father and is obliged to leave the palace, taking refuge to his uncle's palace. Thanks to the help of Eumenes, the court secretary, he becomes reconciled with his father and comes back to the Royal Palace just in time for Cleopatra's marriage. However, Philip is murdered during the ceremony, which causes great sorrow to the young prince. The sorrow is then replaced by the anger towards the murderer and the desire to catch the responsible. He then decidedly steps up to the throne. Many people are not convinced by the new King Alexander, however, mostly due to its young age and lack of experience. Shortly after Alexander becomes king, Eurydice's children and Attalus are killed and Eurydice herself takes her own life shortly after due to the unbearable sorrow. Alexander immediately decides to undertake a campaign in Greece and Asia to affirm Macedonia's position amongst the Pan-Hellenic League and expand its frontiers, just like his father wished to do when alive. His expedition first leads them to Thessaly and his army, now featuring many of his boyhood friends but still a few veterans from Philip's army, records the first of a long sequence of victories.

Between 2007 and 2013, he was the chief executive officer (CEO) of Christchurch City Council, succeeding Lesley McTurk. He lost his position over the city council being stripped of its building consent accreditation. Professional career Marryatt served as the CEO of Hamilton City Council, New Zealand from 1996 to 2007. Marryatt's predecessor at Christchurch City Council, Dr Lesley McTurk, resigned in January 2007 to take up the CEO-role at Housing New Zealand. Marryatt's appointment as CEO in Christchurch was announced by mayor Garry Moore on 15 February 2007. Controversy Maryatt's local government tenure has not been without controversy. He has been held responsible for the loss- making Hamilton V8 Supercars event by his opponents, notably then-mayor of Hamilton David Braithwaite, who frequently clashed with Marryatt. In late 2011 he, along with the Bob Parker-led Christchurch City Council, garnered controversy for accepting a $70,000 pay rise as the council's CEO. This culminated in a protest rally attended by some 4,000 people in February 2012. In late August of that year, it emerged that Marryatt had taken a personal grievance against city councillors. Whilst the case was settled before it went to court, the city council reimbursed his legal costs, which were between NZ$10,000 to NZ$30,000. Maryatt was also condemned by the Canterbury Employers Chamber of Commerce for his decision to grant council staff an extra 11 days leave a year without first seeking approval from elected city councillors. With effect from 8 July 2013, Christchurch City Council has been stripped of its accreditation for issuing building consents. This comes in the middle of a rebuild period following the devastating February 2011 Christchurch earthquake. City councillors found out earlier in June through the media that International Accreditation New Zealand (IANZ) had written to council and threatened to withdraw accreditation, with Marryatt replying \\"that Parker and other councillors were kept in the dark because he was confident staff were addressing issues raised by IANZ, and that the June 28 deadline would be met.\\" A Crown manager, Doug Martin, has been installed to reform the council's consenting department. Marryatt lost his job over the affair, but stayed on the payroll until November 2013 and received a total of $500,000 on departure. Parker, who had backed the controversial CEO over the years, took his part of the responsibility and decided not to stand for re-election for a third term as mayor.

It runs east-west from NC 11 in Grifton to NC 43 in Vanceboro. Route description A two-lane rural highway, it traverses through mostly farmland, as it connects the towns of Grifton and Vanceboro. The highway begins at a stop-controlled intersection with the divided NC 11 just outside of the town limits of Grifton in Lenoir County. NC 118 heads east along West Contentnea Drive through farmland for then enters Grifton and passes through small residential neighborhood for another . At an intersection with South Highland Boulevard, NC 118 turns to the northeast along this road and crosses the Contentnea Creek into Pitt County and downtown Grifton. It makes a turn towards the southeast at Queen Street where NC 118 heads through the town's central business district. After curving slowly to due east, the road heads through another residential neighborhood of Grifton before exiting the town for a more rural area. One small settlement in Pitt County through which NC 118 passes is Quinerly where some houses and streets line the south side of the road. NC 118 heads towards the southeast again where it enters Craven County, again in a mostly rural area. It curves to the east where it passes through an unnamed settlement (at the intersection of Honolulu Road and Bay Bush Road) containing some churches, cemeteries, and a farm and garden store. The road makes one more drop towards the southeast passing another unnamed settlement with houses and churches before curving one last time to the east at wooded marshland containing Swift Creek. NC 118 ends at an intersection with NC 43 within a small annexed portion of Vanceboro. The road continues east as state-maintained Dawson Lane (Secondary Road 1654) to end about later at U.S. Route 17 Business. History Established in 1932 as a new primary routing, it initially ran from U.S. Route 70 (US 70)/NC 10 (now NC 55) in Fort Barnwell to NC 43 in Vanceboro. Around 1940, it was rerouted to a new western terminus at NC 11 in Grifton. In 1969, it was extended west over an old section of NC 11 and Grifton Hugo Road to its current western terminus of NC 11.

The same year, Elmaleh formed a joint venture company with veteran oil tycoon Armand Hammer, named Isramco Inc., in which J.O.E.L. held 35%. From 1982 to 1985, Isramco Inc. drilled four wells onshore in Israel, but only approximately 9,000 Barrels were produced in total and none of the wells sustained commercial production. In 1985 Isramco and other parties formed the Negev 1 Limited Partnership to continue oil and gas exploration activities in Israel. These parties included J.O.E.L., Delek - The Israel Fuel Corporation Ltd., Naphtha Israel Petroleum Corporation Ltd. amongst others. The Negev 1 Partnership spent approximately $19.2 million for oil and gas exploration activities, including seismic exploration, and drilled two wells, both of which were dry holes. The Negev 1 Partnership had no revenues from its activities and its operations were terminated in 1988. Founding Isramco Negev 2 Partnership Following the disbandment of the Negev 1 partnership in 1988, the Isramco Negev 2 Partnership was formed by the same participants one year later, in 1989. The partnership initially held two exploration licenses - Negev Nirim and Negev Ashkelon in which two offshore wells (Yam 1 and Yam 2) were drilled and seismic and geological studies, both onshore and offshore, were conducted at a cost of $44.55 million. The financing for the exploration came from the sale of the limited partnership's units on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, which were mainly bought by small investors hoping for quick profit from the impending oil discoveries. Isramco created two additional companies: Isramco Oil and Gas Ltd., to act as the general partner for the limited partnership, and Isramco Management (1988) Ltd., to act as the nominee holder of the limited partnership units held by public investors in Israel. During 1992 and 1993 the sale of Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership units to the public in Israel raised approximately $123 million. In 1993, the Isramco Negev 2 partnership participants were granted five new offshore exploration licenses in the Mediterranean Sea: Med Tel Aviv License, Med Yavne License, Med Ashdod License, Med Hadera License, and Med Hasharon License, covering additional vast areas from the initial licenses. The same year gas flares could clearly be seen from the Yam 2 well, off the Israeli coast, and the price of partnership's units shot up by thousands of percent. But in February 1994, the partnership announced that the discovery was not economically viable and its share price crashed. Isramco was blamed for misleading investors and enthusiasm for investing in oil exploration in Israel faded away for many years. Change of ownership In August 1995, Joe Elmaliach sold his controlling stake in J.O.E.L. - Jerusalem Oil Exploration Ltd. and its subsidiaries, which in addition to Isramco Inc., included two former state- owned companies - Naphtha Israel Petroleum Corporation and Israel Oil Exploration Ltd. for $17 million to Pass-port Ltd, a company controlled at the time by Yuval Ran. During the subsequent months, control of Pass-port, J.O.E.L., Naptha, and other Isramco-related companies was taken over by businessmen Haim Tsuff and Jackob (Koby) Maimon,. Subsequent activities In 1997 Isramco Inc.'s activities were expanded to the United States through the acquisition of several interests in oil and gas properties there. (In later years Isramco Inc. activities focused exclusively on the USA, while Isramco Negev 2 partnership continued exploring for oil and gas in Israel). In 1998, Isramco drilled the Gevim 1 well located onshore approximately 2 kilometers south of the city of Sderot to a depth of 15,157 feet. The well was declared a dry hole. The total cost of the well was approximately $6.6 million. During the next 10 years Isramco Negev 2 partnership continued its offshore exploration activities in the eastern Mediterranean, with partners Delek Group and the British BG Group. In 2001, BG conducted 3D seismic studies that indicated the significant potential of the Tamar and Dalit gas fields.Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 However, exploratory drilling of these fields was delayed by the withdrawal of BG from the partnership in 2005 and was only begun after Noble Energy joined the partnership in 2007. In 2009, exploratory drilling of the Tamar gas field verified the earlier expectations. The gas field is located roughly west of Haifa in waters deep. The first well, Tamar 1, was drilled to a depth of .

At the time of discovery, Tamar gas field was the largest organic find ever discovered in the under-explored area of the Mediterranean Sea and the largest discovery in the history of Noble Energy. Noble Energy operates Tamar with a 36% working interest; Isramco Negev 2 LP holds 28.75%; Delek Drilling holds 15.63%; Avner Oil Exploration holds 15.63%; and Dor Gas Exploration holds the remaining 4%.

Abumi became the type of stirrup used by the samurai class of feudal Japan.  History  Early abumi were flat-bottomed rings of metal-covered wood, similar to European stirrups. The earliest known examples were excavated from tombs.

John Anderson, Sachiko Hori, Morihiro Ogawa, John Stevenson, Stephen Turnbull, Publisher Yale University Press, 2011, P.84 During the Nara period, the base of the stirrup which supported the rider's sole was elongated past the toe cup. This half-tongued style of stirrup (hanshita abumi) remained in use until the late Heian period (794 to 1185) when a new stirrup was developed. The fukuro abumi or musashi abumi had a base that extended the full length of the rider's foot and the right and left sides of the toe cup were removed. The open sides were designed to prevent the rider from catching a foot in the stirrup and being dragged.Samurai, warfare and the state in early medieval Japan (Google eBook), Karl F. Friday, Psychology Press, 2004 P.98 The military version of this open-sided stirrup, called the shitanaga abumi, was in use by the middle Heian period. It was thinner, had a deeper toe pocket and an even longer and flatter foot shelf. It is not known why the Japanese developed this unique style of stirrup, but this stirrup stayed in use until European style-stirrups were introduced in the late 19th century.Samurai, warfare and the state in early medieval Japan (Google eBook), Karl F. Friday, Psychology Press, 2004 P.98 The abumi had a distinctive swan-like shape, curved up and backward at the front so as to bring the loop for the leather strap over the instep and achieve a correct balance. Most of the surviving specimens from this period are made entirely of iron, inlaid with designs of silver or other materials, and covered with lacquer. In some cases, there is an iron rod from the loop to the footplate near the heel to prevent the foot from slipping out. The footplates are occasionally perforated to let out water when crossing rivers, and these types are called suiba abumi. There are also abumi with holes in the front forming sockets for a lance or banner.Blair, Claude and Tarassuk, Leonid, eds. (1982). The Complete Encyclopedia of Arms and Weapons. p.17.

Umpiring career Johnson's major league umpiring career began in 1902. After one season in the American League, he joined the National League. By 1911, Johnstone was involved in a disagreement with league president Thomas Lynch related to umpiring an unsanctioned offseason series. A 1912 salary dispute ended Johnstone's tenure in the National League. While working in the American Association in 1914, Johnstone's jaw was broken by a punch from pitcher Bill Burns. The incident, and the light punishment received by Burns, led to Johnstone's resignation from the league. Johnstone spent his final year of umpiring in the Federal League that next season. Notable games Johnstone umpired the July 31, 1908 Giants-Cardinals game in which Fred Tenney stole first base after having already reached second. At the time no rule prevented this tactic and Johnstone allowed Tenney to remain on first base. Tenney, in an attempt to draw a throw that might score the runner on third base, subsequently stole his way back to second base.

She was a pleasure craft, a war hero, a working schooner, a film star and a transporter of essential cargoes in dangerous waters. Built in 1892 she carried slate from Wales. In 1912 she was acquired by Lord Penrhyn and converted into a luxury yacht and spent two years cruising the Mediterranean. She resumed carrying cargo; it was china clay on this occasion. In April 1916, she was requisitioned as a Q-ship she featured strongly in reports at the time, however no U-boats were actually damaged. In 1919 she joined the Arklow fleet and for the next dozen years she traded on the Irish Sea. In 1934 she appeared in a film. She featured in a number of films. Mary B. was then retired. At the outbreak of World War II, she was brought out of retirement. Mary B. brought vital food to Britain and vital coal to Ireland. She travelled to Lisbon to collect American cargoes. In December 1944, she was wrecked in a storm. Early career Mary B Mitchell was built by Paul Rogers in 1892 at Carrickfergus, as a three-masted topsail schooner.Forde Maritime Arklow, p 84 She started her career exporting slate from North Wales to Hamburg. She was owned by Lord Penrhyn and served for a period as a yacht, before being put to work as a coaster,Ritchie p8 transporting china clay from Cornwall. World War I In 1916 three Arklow schooners were requisitioned by the Admiralty to be used as Q-ships, they were: Cymric, Gaelic and Mary B Mitchell. Another Q-ship was the schooner Result which was built in 1893 in the same yard as Mary B Mitchell. Result is now with the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum. They sailed the Southwest Approaches, masquerading as merchantmen, inviting attack by U-boats. Their guns were concealed, when a U-boat approached, a \\"panic party\\" would abandon the ship, while the gun crews waited for their target to come into range. The expectation was that the U-boat would approach the apparently abandoned ship and would be surprised and sunk when the guns were revealed and opened fire. Great successes were claimed and medals awarded. In April 1916 the Mary B. was requisitioned for service as a Q-ship. She was armed with a 12-pounder and two 6-pounder guns as well as two machine guns and small arms.Ritchie p97 She was commissioned on 5 May 1916 and sailed on her first patrol on 26 June 1916. On 20 June 1917, she claimed to have sunk two u-boats, and another u-boat and seen a third. On 3 August 1917 Mitchell reported exchanging fire with . A further engagement on 6 December 1916 was also reported. The Naval Intelligence Department stated that none of Mitchell's encounters resulted in the destruction of any U-boat.Rees, p 84 Nonetheless these claims were widely reported in the popular press. and Lawrie was awarded the DSO.Chatterton p74 After the war, it was concluded that Q-ships were greatly overrated, diverting skilled seamen from other duties without sinking enough U-boats to justify the strategy.Preston, p. 58 One Arklow schooner requisitioned as a Q-ship, the Cymric, did sink a submarine. Unfortunately it was , a \\"friendly fire\\" incident. Inter-war years Mary B Mitchell was \\"demobbed\\" on 24 March 1919 and sold to Captain Job Tyrrell of Crinnis Ferrybank, Arklow (note: Job Tyrrell never lived at Crinnis - he lived at Marlborough House; his son, James Tyrrell, bought Crinnis in the 30s) . She was then an \\"Arklow schooner\\". A new twin-screw auxiliary diesel engine, known as an \\"iron topsail\\", was installed. She spent the next dozen years plying the Irish Sea. Film roles In 1934 Mary B Mitchell was chartered by the British International Film Company and featured in a number of films. She was the doomed Mary Celeste in the film The Mystery of the Mary Celeste, which was released in the U.S. as Phantom Ship (1935), one of the early films from Hammer Film Productions. She featured in the 1936 film McGlusky the Sea Rover,Forde, Maritime Arklow, p52 which was released in the U.S. as Hell's Cargo.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0219915/releaseinfo#akas World War II At the outbreak of World War II there were only 56 ships on the Irish register, 14 of those were Arklow schooners. These schooners played a vital role in keeping Ireland supplied. Mary B. Mitchell carried food exports and pit props to Wales; returning with cargoes of coal. In 1943 she went on the hazardous \\"Lisbon run\\". American ships would not enter Irish waters;Burne, page 537 they brought Irish-bound cargoes to Lisbon. Ships like the Mary B. Mitchell had to collect them. Britain had declared the Bay of Biscay to be an \\"exclusion zone\\"; their objective was to prevent supplies from reaching Germany, in particular Japanese exports. However Britain needed foreign currency, which she could obtain by exporting coal to Portugal. 'Navicerts' were introduced. Ships with a navicert were permitted safe passage through allied lines. They were to follow the line of longitude at 12¬∞ west.Forde, (2000). The Long Watch, page ii. Allied convoys to Gibraltar were at least 20¬∞ west to avoid the range of German bombers. However, it was difficult for sailing ships to adhere to this straight line, particularly in the stormy conditions, common in the Bay of Biscay. Mary B. Mitchell made five of these voyages, carrying food to Britain, then British coal to Lisbon, returning with the American cargo to Ireland. Arthur Dowds was captain James Harte was sailing master and Patrick Brennan was first officer. She survived these hazardous journeys. Cymric, another Arklow schooner, which had also been requisitioned as a Q-ship in World War I, was not as fortunate. She vanished with all hands; she may have hit a mine, been torpedoed by a U-boat or bombed by the RAF who were enforcing the blockade of Germany, as was the on this same route. Sailing through the Bay of Biscay, Cymric and Mary B Mitchell now neutrals, would have been sailing the same waters as they did as q-ships three decades earlier.Forde Maritime Arklow p217 In preparation for D-day, Britain withdrew navicerts in April 1944. At this time there was a severe shortage of fuel in Ireland. Gas rationing was introduced and there was severe curtailment of rail services. The Minister for Supplies instructed the Arklow schooners to cease other imports and only to import coal. The schooners averted a possible great hardship that winter. By the autumn they had imported 40,000 tons of coal, while bringing food supplies to Britain.Forde, The Long Watch, p20 Mary B. Mitchell left Dublin for the last time on 13 December 1944; she was bound for Cumberland with a cargo of burnt-ore. She was to return with a cargo of coal. In a storm she was driven onto rocks at the entrance to Kirkcudbright Bay, and lost. Captain Patrick Brennan (the former chief officer) and his crew of eight were taken off by Kirkcudbright lifeboat, all survived. Some items from ship are on display in the Stewartry Museum. Some wreckage remains at the base of the cliff near Senwick Church. Commemoration The Mary B Mitchell is commemorated in Bangor, Wales, by a memorial plaque and a bronze weathervane which adorns the city's new shopping precinct. It was designed and made by Ann Catrin Evans and Roger Wyn Evans. The plaque gives a brief account of the ships history, while the weathervane depicts her in silhouette.

History Habsburg Empire 1789-1918 The Medal for Bravery was created by Emperor Joseph II on 19 July 1789 in order to recognize courage in combat by personnel below commissioned rank (courageous acts performed by commissioned officers could after 1757 be rewarded by appointment to the Military Order of Maria Theresa). From 1789 to 1915, the Medal for Bravery existed in three classes: Golden Medal for Bravery, Silver Medal for Bravery 1st Class and Silver Medal for Bravery 2nd Class. The latter honour was similar in design to the Golden Medal and the Silver Medal 1st Class, but considerably smaller. A fourth class, the Bronze Medal for Bravery, was introduced on 14 February 1915 during World War I. It was the same size as the Silver Medal 2nd Class. Bars denoting subsequent awards within the same class were introduced on 29 November 1915. All versions of the Medal for Bravery bore the portrait of the reigning monarch on the obverse and the inscription \\"Der Tapferkeit\\" (\\"To Bravery\\") on the reverse. Medals awarded during World War I were minted with the portrait of Emperor Franz Josef on the obverse until some months after his death. Starting in April 1917, the visage of his successor, Emperor Charles I, was substituted.http://www.theaerodrome.com/medals/austrhun/mfb.php Retrieved 6 January 2012. On 26 September 1917, Emperor Charles I amended the statutes of the Medal for Bravery and decreed that the Golden Medal for Bravery and the Silver Medal for Bravery 1st Class could now also be awarded to commissioned officers, particularly in cases where their services were not sufficient for the Military Order of Maria Theresa. Commissioned officers wore the same medals as the ranks, plus the letter \\"K\\" (in gold or silver, depending on class of the award) superimposed on the triangular ribbon.

It continues to be active and has received several awards from the Indonesian music industry. History God Bless was founded by Ahmad Albar (vocals), Jockie Soerjoprajogo (keyboard), Fuad Hassan (drums), Donny Fattah (bass), and Ludwig Lemans (guitar) in 1973. They had their first concert on 5 May 1973 at Taman Ismail Marzuki, which was followed on 16 August with the Summer 28 concert, the first (and, as of 2004, largest) open-air concert in Indonesia. During that period they also played at the Jakarta Fair, held near the National Monument. That same year the band acted in Ambisi (Ambition); Lemans left the band not long after to return to the Netherlands. In 1975 the band opened for British rock band Deep Purple when the latter played in Jakarta. They released their first album, Huma di Atas Bukit (Rice Field on a Hill), the following year. The titular song for the progressive rock album, an adaptation of \\"Firth Of Fifth\\", from Genesis' 1973 album Selling England by the Pound, went on to be used as the theme song to Sjumadjaja's film Laila Majenun (Laila is Possessed). Four years later, God Bless released Cermin (Mirror), which included more ballads and showed influences from Deep Purple and Van Halen; Abadi Soesman contributed a bit. The band, in an off-again on-again state for the next several years, released their third album, Semut Hitam (Black Ants) in 1988; the album went on to be their most successful. This was followed by Raksasa (Monster; 1989), and Apa Kabar? (What's Up?; 1997). God Bless performed a \\"duel\\" with Padi on 9 November 2011, a band twenty years their younger; held in the Hard Rock Cafe Jakarta, the duel was witnessed by over 200 people, greater than the capacity of the venue. In 2003 Jockie left the group; initially reported as being over creative differences, in October 2011 Jockie revealed that it was after a fight over Albar's drug habits. Jockie, once a drug user himself, was asked to tell Albar to stop using drugs; in response, Albar reportedly pulled a gun on him. Jockie was soon replaced by Abadi Soesman. Guitarist Ian Antono confirmed that a pistol was involved, but he thought it could be a toy; he stated that the argument flared up when Jockie insulted Albar's family. In 2007, Yaya Moekito joined the band as a drummer. After Albar was imprisoned for drug possession in November 2007 and paroled in July 2008, in mid-2009, God Bless played at the Jakarta Fair and released another album, 36th. In late 2009 the band was pictured on the cover of Rolling Stone Indonesia. The following year, the band went on a cross- country tour, playing in nine cities and accompanied by Nidji, Gigi, Andra and The BackBone, and Naif. The band also played in the 2010 Djakarta Artmosphere festival. On 14 June 2011, God Bless performed at the Hard Rock Cafe with Jibriel to celebrate founder's day; the latter group consists of two of Albar's sons, one of Jockie's, one of Antono's, and Albar's nephew Bagoes. In July, the band played at the Hard Rock Cafe Jakarta to celebrate its 40th anniversary. The following month, from 22 to 24 July 2011, the band performed at the InterMusic Java Rockin' Land alongside The Cranberries and Neon Trees. On 20 October 2011 Jockie posted on his Facebook wall that he was upset that the band continued to play songs written by him without paying royalties. Themes Tertiani Z.B. Simanjuntak, writing for The Jakarta Post, notes that God Bless often advocated the rights of the poor and working classes. Accolades In a 2009 issue, Rolling Stone Indonesia ranked two of God Bless' songs as being among the 150 best Indonesian songs of all time: \\"Kehidupan\\" (\\"Life\\"), was ranked 8th, while \\"Rumah Kita\\" (\\"Our Home\\") was ranked 22nd. In August 2011 Kompas reported that Mira Lesmana and Riri Riza have spent two years producing a documentary about the band, to be titled Rockumentary.

It is written and directed by John Shiban. In the episode, Cullen Bohannon (Anson Mount) and the search party find the Cheyenne who attacked the surveyor's camp and later derailed a train; Elam (Common) and Eva (Robin McLeavy) discuss their future, before getting a strange visitor; and the railroad crew reaches the important 40-mile mark. The episode title has several meanings ‚Äì from the Mumford & Sons song of the same name, which was heard in the episode, to the actual Hebrew word translation of man's triumph over sin. Plot The Cheyenne renegades attack Cullen and the search party. Bow and arrows and gunfire quickly become a melee. Joseph (Eddie Spears) rescues Griggs (Ty Olsson) from Pawnee Killer (Gerald Auger), who moves to kill Griggs, after a young brave had been killed. Pawnee Killer flees into the woods but is shot dead by Joseph with an arrow. The natives are defeated. Griggs aims to resume tracking the Cheyenne villagers, but no one else wants to continue helping him. Joseph and Elam agree that Durant will want proof of victory. They suggest taking the natives' scalps. Cullen declines, but Elam accepts, knowing Durant's $20-per-head bounty. Thomas C. Durant (Colm Meaney) then enlists Elam to do things \\"off the books.\\" Joseph wants to honor his brother's death by burning his body in a funeral pyre. The ritual is attended by his father, Chief Many Horses (Wes Studi), who says he mourns the loss of both of his sons, admitting that losing Joseph to the \\"white man\\" hurts him more. The McGinnes Brother's theater is back in business with newly acquired pornographic slides. Bohannon affirms his suspicions that his boxing match had been fixed and is offered a bounty of $100 by Sean McGinnes (Ben Esler) to kill the Swede. Meanwhile, Elam and Eva cuddle in his tent, discussing their future, when Mr. Toole (Duncan Ollerenshaw) calls to him outside. Toole, his head draped in cloth, is still alive, after the bullet Elam fired into his mouth exited out the back of his neck. Toole begs for forgiveness, and Elam insists that he apologizes instead to Eva. Durant witnesses the Swede (Christopher Heyerdahl) conspiring outside his railcar about the man the Pinkertons located. The Swede later enters the bar and proposes a toast to Bohannon and his company for bravely slaying the Indians. Bohannon instead rallies the bar to hit their 40-mile mark, which they accomplish triumphantly the following day. The camp celebrates, including Lily (Dominique McElligott) who orders a brandy with Bohannon at the bar. Durant sees them and interrupts to tell Bohannon that he's offering him a \\"bonus\\" ‚Äì information that the Swede is plotting against him, by sending telegrams to the authorities with evidence of Bohannon's past murders. Joseph returns to the church where Ruth (Kasha Kropinski) consoles him over the death of his brother. The two kiss by lantern-light. Meanwhile, Griggs returns to the camp, intent on killing Joseph, but finds only Reverend Cole (Tom Noonan). The reverend pleads for Griggs's forgiveness of Joseph, but Griggs insists that Joseph be killed. As Griggs turns to leave, the reverend removes the soldier's sword and chops off his head. Notes The episode's title has several usages. \\"Timshel\\" is a song on the album Sigh No More by the group Mumford & Sons. The song plays during the episode's opening battle. \\"Timshel\\" or \\"timshol\\" (◊™◊ô◊û◊©◊ú) is also a Hebrew word which has different translations, including \\"thou will rule,\\" \\"thou can rule,\\" or the more proper \\"thou mayest rule.\\" Reception Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4 out of 5 stars, saying \\"'Timshel' was a rather enjoyable piece, touching on all of the major characters.\\" However, The A.V. Club's Phil Nugent rated the episode a D, stating that Hell On Wheels \\"is the work of hacks, people whose lack of personal obsession and conflicted emotions render it an ambiguity-free zone.\\" The ninth episode was watched by 2.29 million viewers and had a 0.7 rating with the 18‚Äì49 age range ‚Äì the series' third-lowest viewership of the season.

The Norwegian Settlers Memorial is the official memorial of the U.S. state of Illinois maintained in honor of immigrants from the nation of Norway. This Memorial commemorates the Fox River Settlement, the site of the first permanent Norwegian-American immigrant settlement in the Midwest. The Memorial is situated just south of the community of Norway in LaSalle County, Illinois. It is located by the roadside of Illinois Route 71, 9 miles (14.5 km) northeast of Exit 93 on Interstate 80. Description The Memorial celebrates the first arrival in 1834 of a pioneering band of farm- seekers led by the peripatetic ethnic leader Cleng Peerson. Peerson's vessel, the Restauration, is often credited with bringing the first group of immigrants from Norway to Kendall, New York in 1825. Scandinavian farm life had been devastated in 1816 by the Year Without a Summer, and younger sons and daughters from farm families in Norway were looking for new opportunities. During the 1840s, the Fox River Settlement frequently became a stopping-off point for Norwegian immigrants who entered America. The Memorial was dedicated in 1934 to commemorate the initial arrival in the Fox River Valley of the group led by Cleng Peerson. At the time the Memorial was dedicated, many of the descendants of the Peerson party were still working the land their ancestors had taken up in 1834. Today the Memorial is an un-staffed historic site of the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. Three different plaques are located at the Norwegian Settlers Memorial. The plaque dedicated in 1934 commemorates the arrival of the first group of Norwegian-American immigrants. The second and third plaques were dedicated in 1975 to commemorate the 150th Anniversary of Norwegian-American Immigration and to dedicate the adjacent Cleng Peerson Memorial Highway. His Majesty King Olav V of Norway dedicated the Cleng Peerson plaque on October 17, 1975.

The seventh typhoon and second super typhoon of the active typhoon season, it formed from the monsoon trough that spawned a tropical cyclone on August 8 while around positioned well to the east of the Philippines. It drifted northwestward, becoming a tropical storm on August 9 and a typhoon on August 10\\\\. Betty turned westward, where it rapidly intensified before attaining peak intensity on August 11\\\\. The next day, Typhoon Betty made landfall in the central Philippines. Betty weakened rapidly over the country, but restrengthened somewhat over the South China Sea. Land interaction weakened Betty slightly before it hit central Vietnam on August 16\\\\. The next day, Betty dissipated. Across the Philippines, Typhoon Betty brought widespread flooding, which resulted in severe destruction. Damage added up to $100 million (1987 USD). In the Maguindanao and Albay provinces alone, 10,000 people were evacuated and 1,000 were homeless. However, the capital city of Manila avoided any serious damage. Nationwide, around 200,000 people were reportedly homeless, 18,000 of winch were from Marinduque and another 11,400 resided on Mindoro Island. In the former, 4,000 dwellings sustained damage, and all of the banana crop there was lost. In all, 25,518 homes received damage. Roughly 400,000 people were directly affected by the storm. Overall, 85 people were killed and 324 others were wounded. After striking the Philippines, six people were killed by Betty in Vietnam. Approximately 10,000 structures were damaged and 103 people were injured. Elsewhere, in northern Thailand, one person was killed and three others were hurt by the typhoon. Several villages were flooded, and numerous streets were damaged. Meteorological history The origins of Typhoon Betty can be traced back to a tropical disturbance that was embedded in the monsoon trough on August 7, which extended from the Marshall Islands westward to the Philippines. Intensity estimates via the Dvorak technique yielded winds of around north- northwest of Belau in the western Caroline Islands. Following a rapid increase in organization, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) for the system early on August 8. Meanwhile, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started tracking the system. Around this time, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Herming. Early on August 9, Betty intensified into a tropical storm about 1,320 km (820 mi) east-southeast of Manila during the morning of August 9. Betty continued to intensify, and by midday, the storm attained winds of . By the evening of August 9, the JMA upgraded Betty to a severe tropical storm. At 0000 UTC on August 10, both the JMA and JTWC believed that Betty attained typhoon intensity. Tracking westward Betty began an episode of explosive deepening as expected by the JTWC. At noon, the JTWC reported that Betty attained winds of , equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane on the United States Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (SSHWS). By 0000 UTC on August 11, the agency upgraded Betty to an equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. Later that day, the JMA estimated that Betty attained its peak maximum sustained wind of and a minimum barometric pressure of . However, the JTWC indicated that the system was considerably stronger, with maximum sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph). This concluded the storm intensification period; according to the JTWC, Betty strengthened in a 37-hour time frame. Furthermore, Betty was the deepest storm of the season, and one of the most powerful storms ever recorded. At peak, which it maintained for 12 hours, Betty exhibited a small but well-defined eye surrounded by very cold cloud tops. Thereafter, Betty began to weaken as it moved over the central Philippines. Accelerating, Betty continued on a westward track while passing south of a subtropical ridge. According to the JTWC, winds quickly decreased to , and by the time it emerged into the South China Sea early on August 13, the typhoon's winds had diminished to , equivalent to a high-end Category 2 on the SSHWS. The JMA estimated that Betty was slightly weaker, with winds of . Moving west- northwest, Betty began to deepen over open water. By midday, the JMA increased the intensity of Typhoon Betty to . On the morning of August 14, the JTWC remarked that Betty reached its secondary peak intensity of . Despite this, intensity estimates from the JMA note that Betty did not intensify any further. After attaining its secondary peak intensity, Betty began to deteriorate as it began to interact with Vietnam. After entering the Gulf of Tonkin, Betty made landfall south of Hanoi in northern Vietnam on August 16. At the time of landfall, the JMA estimated winds of and the JTWC estimated winds of . According to the JMA, Betty weakened to a tropical storm on evening of August 16. It then swept across Laos and eventually dissipated over northern Thailand near Chiang Mai during the evening of August 17. Preparations, impact, and aftermath Typhoon Betty near landfall in the Philippines  Philippines  Under the anticipation that Betty would strike the Philippines, weather alerts were issued in 11 provinces. Manila was placed on \\"stage three\\" alert initially, but after the storm passed south of the city, it was downgraded to \\"stage two\\" alert. School classes were suspended and residents in low-lying areas were asked to be ready to evacuate. Warnings urging residents to prepare for the storm were broadcast via television. Eighteen ships were also evacuated. Many radio stations were closed. Typhoon Betty battered the Philippines at peak intensity, bringing heavy rains while also becoming the deepest tropical cyclone to affect the island nation since Typhoon Ike of the 1984 Pacific typhoon season. It also leveled trees and crops, demolished houses, and knocked down power lines. Many highways, crops, buildings, and homes were destroyed. Two people were killed in San Pablo; four died in the city of Batangas. Five people were killed when they drowned in when their boat was capsized in the rough waters of the Pacific. One person was missing and five others were injured. In the Laguna province, three people, including a 6 year old boy were killed. In the resort of Tagaytay, many homes lost their roofs. Communication was lost in the Quezon province. Elsewhere, roughly 2,500 individuals were evacuated to shelter in Legazpi, many of whom were houses in schools and churches. However, the metropolis of Manila escaped any major damage, although power was lost in some places. Along the Maguindanao and Albay provinces, 10,000 people were evacuated and crop damage totaled $50,000; in the latter alone, 1,000 families were displaced.

Six fisherman were also listed as missing. Along southern Luzon, railway service was suspended and 11 domestic flights in and out of the country on August 12 were cancelled. The next day, Philippine Airlines called off all domestic flights, including three flights each to Hong Kong, Taipei and Tokyo were cancelled. Trading was suspended on the Manila and Makati stock exchanges for a day. Eighty-five people perished as a result of Typhoon Betty while 17 were reported missing. Nationwide, around 200,000 people were reportedly homeless, including 18,000 in Marinduque and 11,400 on Mindoro Island. A total of 25,518 homes were damaged. Roughly 400,000 people were directly affected by the storm, 371 of which were injured. Overall, damage amounted to more than PHP 2 billion ($100 million 1987 USD), including $6 million in the provinces of Batangas and Samar. Damage to roads totaled $2.1 million. Following the storm, Philippine President Corazon Aquino declared a state of calamity in more than a dozen provinces. Within a few days after Betty hit, the Philippine Airlines resumed normal flight schedules and schools were reopened. A few months following the passage of Betty, the nation itself was hit by Typhoon Nina.  Vietnam  After striking the Philippines, six people were killed by Betty in Vietnam.

Biography Fite was born in Montgomery, Alabama to Ernest Baxter and Minnie Watt Fite. His grandfather, Bloomer Rankin Fite, established a firm and practiced law in the Hamilton, Alabama area in the 1880s, with four of his sons, including Ernest Rankin's father. Ernest Baxter Fite also served in the Alabama House of Representatives and Alabama Senate for Marion County, Alabama. Fite graduated from the University of Alabama with a LL.B degree in 1939 and joined his family firm after being admitted to the bar. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant for World War II where he went overseas to fly as a navigator. After the war, he returned to law practice in 1945. He was elected to the Alabama Senate in 1946 and served as a floor leader. He ran successfully for the House of Representatives in 1950 and served five consecutive terms there, serving as speaker on two occasions. While serving in the house and senate, Fite also served as bank director for the Bank of Hackleburg and president of the Marion County Banking Company. During his time in the house, he sought improvements to his hometown of Hamilton, revamping streets and sewer systems. On February 16, 1968, Fite, then Speaker of the House, placed the ceremonial first 9-1-1 call from the town of Haleyville. The emergency system had been rushed into service by the Alabama Telephone Company in an effort show the innovative prowess of the independent telephone industry. Fite's call was answered by then-Congressman Tom Bevill. He retired from politics in 1974 due to failing health, having suffered from Parkinson's disease prior to retiring. He died of a heart attack in 1980. He was married in 1941 to Ruby Alene Morris with whom he had one son, Ernest Adams. Upon his death in 1980, Fite was described as \\"one of the most masterful members of the state legislature\\". Former governor George C. Wallace commented that \\"[today was] truly a sad day, as we experience the loss of a man who in legislative circles had already become a legend\\".

It is a small surveillance drone, which is mainly used by the United Kingdom, but has also been used by the United States to assist in the war on terror by executing reconnaissance and recovery missions.  Design and development  The Desert Hawk III was created by the Skunk Works team at Lockheed Martin as an update to the original Desert Hawk, which was developed in 2002 with its first actual flight coming in 2003. The original is slightly smaller and heavier than the DHIII, and the DHIII can stay in the air over thirty minutes longer. The Desert Hawk III is made out of a special polypropylene material. Polypropylene is mouldable when heated to a high enough temperature and returns to a solid state when the temperature is lowered back to normal. Polypropylene was chosen because of its flexibility and ability to protect the device with its rugged surface.  Powerplant  The DHIII has one electric motor driving the quiet propeller located on the nose of the plane. The motor was chosen to minimize the sound level produced by the vehicle, allowing it to get closer to a subject during missions without being heard.  Radar and Intelligence packages  There are three different intelligence packages used by the DHIII: * Synthetic aperture radar (SAR): Creates images by using radio waves that bounce off surfaces, then measuring the echos. The SAR can be used in all weather conditions, while still providing an accurate image. * Signals intelligence (SIGINT): Intercepts electronic signals, and either records them as new information or matches them to known data. * Communications intelligence (COMINT): Intercepts electronic signals, specifically communication between people, and records the information. COMINT is used to find out who transmitted the signal, their location, and how long the signal lasted.  Sensors and cameras  The DHIII is equipped with the following sensors and cameras: * Infrared sensors, which detect heat. * Electro-optical sensors, which detect changes in light. * Long wave infrared imager (LWIR), which is a unique camera that captures thermal images to show differences in heat. * Laser illuminator, which records video when it is dark with night vision technology.  Ground Control Station  The Ground Control Station (GCS), the Desert Hawk III‚Äôs remote control system, is a large briefcase that contains all of the tools needed to operate up to four Desert Hawks at once. It is equipped with tracking capabilities, multiple antennas for proper connectivity, and it is operated by a remote control similar to an Xbox 360 Controller. The GCS is portable and weighs 15 pounds. The GCS programs flight patterns for missions into the DHIII. Then, when the vehicle is in flight, the GCS uses the autopilot function to perform the programmed flights. The autopilot function allows the operator of the DHIII to focus on using the sensors, radars, and cameras to gather the needed information during the mission. However, the operator is in control during launch and landing sequences.  Performance  The DHIII is a hand-launched aircraft with specific techniques for launching and landing the vehicle.  Launch technique  The DHIII is launched manually. After the launch the ground control station takes over with the flight commands.  Landing technique  As the DHIII does not have wheels, it does not land like most airplanes do. It is important that the vehicle lands as close to horizontally as possible. To perform a proper skid landing, the operator must take into account, the angle of descent, the wind, and the terrain on which the vehicle is landing. The operator of the DHIII may bring the device around multiple times to make sure the landing goes smoothly. The aircraft is designed to break apart on impact, to dissipate its kinetic energy without causing damage to the components so they can be reused. Operational history The first order of Desert Hawk IIIs was made by the British Army in 2006. They were used by the Royal Artillery and the 32nd Regiment in Iraq. In late 2007, the United Kingdom Ministry of Defense signed a contract, worth $4.8 million, with Lockheed Martin for more DHIIIs. In 2013, there was a total 222 Desert Hawk IIIs in service for the British army, which was almost 40% of all drones in service. It was also reported that 412 DHIIIs had crashed, broken down, or been lost behind enemy lines between the years 2008 and 2013.

It was released exclusively via mail order in 1983 by American pharmaceutical and consumer goods manufacturer Johnson & Johnson.  Background  Released in 1983, Tooth Protectors is one of the earliest \\"advergames\\" or \\"promogames\\" ‚Äì games with overt tie-ins to retail products ‚Äì and one of several released that year for the Atari 2600 platform (others included M Network's Kool-Aid Man and Purina's Chase the Chuck Wagon.) Commissioned by Johnson & Johnson and developed by DSD/Camelot, it was the only game released for the Atari 2600 by either company. The game was never given a traditional retail release, but was instead available exclusively to Johnson & Johnson customers who mailed in proof of purchase stamps to the company. Today it is considered rare and valuable; the game received a rating of 9 (\\"Extremely Rare\\") from the Atari Age rarity guide.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot The gameplay is similar to that of Activision's Kaboom!, in which the player must prevent objects dropping from the top of the screen from reaching the bottom by positioning their character directly under the falling objects. In Tooth Protectors, the objects are small \\"snack\\" squares dropped by the \\"Snack Attacker\\", a menacing- looking face that moves horizontally along the top of the screen. The player's character is a small smiling face carrying a strand of dental floss above its head. The player must prevent the snack squares from reaching the row of white teeth along the bottom of the screen; repeated hits by the snacks cause the teeth to blink and disappear from tooth decay. Occasionally the Snack Attacker will dive from the top of the screen in an attempt to grab the player; the player loses a turn if the Snack Attacker succeeds. If teeth begin to decay, the player can press the joystick's fire button to call in the \\"Tooth Protectors\\": an orange toothbrush, green box of dental floss and purple dental rinse bottle move across the teeth, brushing, flossing and rinsing them.

Season summary Bournemouth struggled all season amidst an injury crisis, and when they were docked ten points by the Football League after entering administration, with debts around ¬£4 million, on 8 February, relegation appeared to be almost certain. The only bid that administrators Gerald Krasner and Begbies Traynor accepted came from a consortium led by chairman Jeff Mostyn. However, in a press conference on 3 April, Krasner said that, due to a breach of the agreement between the administrators and the consortium relating to the funding of the consortium and the sale of the club, the agreement broke down. Krasner also warned that the club might also be closed before the end of the season, unless appropriate funding came forward. In spite of off-the-field issues with the club, Bournemouth achieved a remarkable string of results in League One. By 19 April, a winning streak of five matches left Bournemouth four points away from safety with two games remaining. The winning streak was increased to six matches on 26 April with a vital 1‚Äì0 victory over Crewe Alexandra. Victory or a draw away at Carlisle United on 3 May, depending on Cheltenham Town and Gillingham's results, would ensure Bournemouth's survival in the division. Former manager Harry Redknapp commented that escaping relegation \\"would be more than a great escape, it would be a miracle\\" and added that \\"if Kevin (Bond) doesn't get Manager of the Month there's something wrong\\". Bournemouth managed to achieve a 1‚Äì1 draw in the match against Carlisle United but, with Cheltenham Town winning 2‚Äì1 at home to Doncaster Rovers, were relegated to League Two. Had Bournemouth not been given a points deduction as a result of entering administration, the club would have finished in 15th, at the expense of Crewe, who would have been relegated in their place.

On February 27, 2012 Elsevier, a major publisher, announced that it was withdrawing support for the Act.Elsevier withdraws support for the Research Works Act Later that day, Issa and Maloney issued a statement saying that they would not push for legislative action on the bill. Reception The bill was supported by the Association of American Publishers (AAP) and the Copyright Alliance.Statement from Copyright Alliance Executive Director Sandra Aistars, Re: Introduction of H.R. 3699, the Research Works Act The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, the Alliance for Taxpayer Access, the American Library Association, the International Society for Computational Biology, the Confederation of Open Access Repositories and prominent open science and open access advocates criticized the Research Works Act, some of them urging scholarly societies to resign from the AAP because of its support for the bill. Several AAP members, including MIT Press, Rockefeller University Press, Nature Publishing Group, American Association for the Advancement of Science stated their opposition to the bill but signaled no intention to leave the association. Other AAP members stated their opposition to the bill as did the Association of American Universities (AAU) and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities. Several public health groups opposed the bill. Opponents stressed particularly the effects on public availability of biomedical research results, such as those funded by NIH grants, submitting that under the bill \\"taxpayers who already paid for the research would have to pay again to read the results\\". Mike Taylor from the University of Bristol said that the bill's denial of access to scientific research would cause \\"preventable deaths in developing countries\\" and \\"an incalculable loss to science\\", and said Representatives Issa and Maloney were motivated by multiple donations they had received from the academic publisher Elsevier. An online petition ‚Äì The Cost of Knowledge ‚Äì inspired by British mathematician and Fields medalist Timothy Gowers to raise awareness of the bill, to call for lower prices for journals and to promote increased open access to information, was signed by more than 10,000 scholars. Signatories vowed to withhold their support from Elsevier journals as editors, reviewers or authors \\"unless they radically change how they operate\\". On February 27, 2012, Elsevier announced its withdrawal of support for the bill, citing concerns from journal authors, editors, and reviewers. While participants in the boycott celebrated the dropping of support for the Research Works Act, Elsevier denied that their action was a result of the boycott and stated that they took this action at the request of those researchers who did not participate in the boycott.  Related legislation and executive action The Research Works Act followed other attempts to challenge institutional open-access mandates in the US. On September 9, 2008, an earlier bill aimed at reversing the NIH's Public Access Policy ‚Äì the Fair Copyright in Research Works Act, or Conyers Bill ‚Äì was introduced as 110 H. R. 6845 in the House of Representatives at the 110th United States Congress by U.S Representative John Conyers (D-MI), with three cosponsors. It was referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary, to which Conyers delivered an introduction on September 10, 2008. After the start of the 111th United States Congress, Conyers and six-cosponsors reintroduced the bill to the House of Representatives as 111 H. R. 801 on February 3, 2009. It was on the same day referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary and on March 16 to the Subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy. On the other hand, the Federal Research Public Access Act proposed to expand the open public access mandate to research funded by eleven U.S. federal agencies. Originally introduced to the Senate in 2006 by John Cornyn (R-TX) with two cosponsors, it was reintroduced in 2009 by Lieberman, co-sponsored by Cornyn, and again in 2012. These bills proposed requiring that those eleven agencies with research expenditures over $100 million create online repositories of journal articles of the research completed by that agency and make them publicly available without charge within six months after it has been published in a peer-reviewed journal. On February 22, 2013 the Obama administration issued a similar policy memorandum, directing Federal agencies with more than $100 million in annual research and development expenditures to develop plans to make research freely available to the public within one year of publication in most cases.White House Issues Public Access Directive See also *Open-access journal *PubMed Central References External links * H.R. 3699 on Thomas ‚Äì Library of Congress * H.R. 3699 on GovTrack * Notes on the Research Works Act from the Harvard Open Access Project Internet access Open access (publishing) United States intellectual property law Proposed legislation of the 112th United States Congress ","title":"Research Works Act"},{"id":"34303517","text":"The Woolmark logo. Woolmark is a wool industry certification mark used on pure wool products that meet quality standards set by The Woolmark Company. It is a trade mark owned by The Woolmark Company, which has since 2007 been a subsidiary of Australian Wool Innovation Limited (AWI). The logo was launched in 1964 by the Woolmark Company under its previous name, the International Wool Secretariat. History The Woolmark logo was developed by the International Wool Secretariat (IWS), which had been founded in 1937. The logo was launched in August 1964 by IWS, then under the control of two Australians, William (Archer) Gunn (1914-2003) who was chairman and William Vines (1916-2011) its managing director. The two main objectives of the logo were to position wool at the top of the textile market and to ensure that products bearing the Woolmark label were made from pure new wool and manufactured to the highest standards. The logo had been selected by IWS following a competition in 1963 won by Milanese graphic artist Francesco Saroglia (most probably a pseudonym of Italian architect, graphic designer Franco Grignani). The logo was originally owned by IWS, which in 1997 changed its name to The Woolmark Company Pty Ltd. The Woolmark Company Pty Ltd and Australian Wool Innovation Limited (AWI) were subsidiaries of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, which was succeeded by Australian Wool Services Limited (AWS). AWI was de-merged from AWS in 2002 and The Woolmark Company was sold by AWS to AWI in 2007. Since 2007, the Woolmark Company has been a subsidiary of AWI, a nonprofit organization that conducts research, development and marketing along the global supply chain for Australian wool on behalf of approximately 60,000 woolgrowers that cooperatively fund the company. What remained of AWS became Graziers‚Äô Investment Company Limited, which as at March 2020 was in the process of liquidation. https://www.sheepcentral.com/20m-gic-payout-to-wool-growers-set-for-march/ The logo has been such a success that it eventually ranked with a large scallop shell or three-pointed-star in terms of consumer recognition and understanding.Ted Henzell, Australian agriculture: its history and challenges.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site on July 17, 1986. It is the second of two church buildings to exist on the site; the current one replaced a wooden structure in 1910. The church's philosophy is built on the Oxford Movement. History The parish was founded on July 17, 1860, when the Episcopal Bishop of Michigan, Reverend Samuel A. McCoskry, met with nine businessmen from Houghton and Hancock. The first clergyman sent to serve the church, upon arriving in Houghton on a Saturday, immediately departed on the vessel that had carried him. Public services were first held on September 15, 1860. The name Trinity Church was chosen at the first vestry meeting, held on July 13, 1861. The church's first permanent home was a wooden building across the Portage Canal in Hancock, built on land donated by the Quincy Mining Company. However, it was soon decided that the structure would be moved to Houghton, on land owned by Shelden, a member of the church. The church was placed on a barge overnight, but it came free of its bounds and was found floating free in the morning. It was successfully recovered and transferred to Houghton, where it remained until 1910. The wooden church was demolished in early 1910 to make way for the current church, built of brick and Jacobsville Sandstone, which was completed on Easter that same year. In 1995, a two-story addition was built to house the pastor's office. The current church was designated a Michigan State Historic Site on July 17, 1986, and an informational marker was erected on April 24, 1987. Architecture The church is a brick structure built in the Gothic Revival style. The basement fa√ßade, copings, and trim are all made of Jacobsville Sandstone. The building has a square tower at one corner capped with crenellations. The building architect was John B. Sutcliffe and interior artwork and carvings were done by Alois Lang. The interior design of the church was influenced by the Oxford Movement. The roof's wooden trusses are exposed as arches that span the nave. The church houses an Austin Organ, opus 419, which was installed in 1913.

Selivanov served as Governor-General of Irkutsk from 1906 until 1910 when he became a member of the State Council of Imperial Russia. In 1914 during World War I, Selivanov was appointed commander of the forces besieging Przemy≈õl. The siege had begun under the command of Radko Dimitriev on September 24, 1914. Dimitriev's Russian Third Army was forced to suspend siege operations during Paul von Hindenburg's offensive against Warsaw in 1914. After defeat at the battle of the Vistula River, Hindenburg and his Austrian allies retreated and Dimitriev resumed siege operations. However the Third Army was moved away from the Przemy≈õl front. General Selivanov then assumed command of the Russian siege forces which were designated the Russian Eleventh Army. Selivanov halted the frontal assaults which had characterized earlier Russian attempts to subdue the fortress. Selivanov settled into starving the garrison into submission. Defeat became inevitable for the defenders when Austrian relief efforts were turned back and Selivanov's Eleventh Army overran Przemy≈õl's northern defenses. For successfully capturing Przemy≈õl, Selivanov was awarded the Order of Saint George, 3rd Degree.

A Mormon, his second name Nitama was the MƒÅori translation of Needham, as in Needham Lambert, who was the president of the New Zealand Mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).Encyclopedia of New Zealand entry on Paewai When he was four years old, Paewai's father Niki Paiwai was admitted to Utah State University, and so Paewai started school at the Woodruff School in Logan, Utah, and was baptized in Logan at age eight. They returned to New Zealand in 1929. Paewai attended Dannevirke High School before being admitted to the University of Otago. However, at that time there was extreme prejudice against MƒÅori at Otago and he gave up his studies shortly after starting there to return to Tahoraiti, near Dannevirke. Shortly after, the LDS Church mission president at the time, Matthew Cowley, visited that location. On learning that Paewai had quit school, Cowley called him as a missionary, and then gave him his missionary assignment of returning to Otago University and completing his training as a doctor.Glen L.

In 1957, Paewai did advanced medical studies at the University of Utah. In New Zealand he is recognised as an important practitioner of public health policies by a doctor within the MƒÅori community. In 1949, Paewai married Hineapa Meha. They became the parents of eight children. Paewai spent most of his adult life in Kaikohe.

Born in Boston, Massachusetts on October 2, 1829, Winsor was the youngest of 12 children of Thomas Winsor (who died when Frederick was two) and Welthea Sprague, one of 15 children of Seth Sprague of Duxbury, Massachusetts, a famous Methodist anti-slavery leader. Winsor attended Boston Latin School, and graduated Harvard University in 1851. He was known as a great athlete at Harvard, despite serious eye problems that forced him to leave school in his senior year and have his lessons read to him in order to graduate. He then attended Harvard Medical School, graduating in 1855. That same year he began his long practice as a physician in Salem, Massachusetts. Winsor married Ann Bent Ware, daughter of Unitarian minister, professor, and abolitionist Henry Ware Jr. and Mary Lovell Pickard, on August 10, 1857 in Milton, Massachusetts. In 1861, Massachusetts Governor John Albion Andrew appointed Winsor head of the State Hospital at Rainsford Island. A year later he left his post to enlist as a surgeon in the 49th Massachusetts regiment, serving from 1862 to 1863 through the disastrous Louisiana Campaign under the command of Colonel (later General) William Francis Bartlett. During a disastrous frontal assault on Port Hudson, Louisiana on May 27, 1863, Bartlett was shot twice--once in his remaining unamputated leg and once in his wrist, shattering it. Dr. Winsor worked through the night to remove the bullet from Col. Bartlett's wrist, saving his hand. He would write a gripping account of that night years later for Atlantic Monthly: :His clear blue eye met mine steadily, his strong right hand grasped mine firmly, and the voice that could ring along the line like a trumpet had no waver in it as it said, ‚ÄúHow are you, doctor? We‚Äôve had a tough time of it. Now you must do your best for me. I can‚Äôt lose another limb, you know.‚Äù I saw that the hurt in the head could be nothing serious; a buckshot had scored the scalp to the bone, and another had done the same for the heel of his one foot. I undid the bandage that bound his left wrist, and examined it. A ball had entered on one side, and lay near the surface on the other. His eyes questioned me, and I replied, ‚ÄúI can soon take that ball out, when you are under ether. That‚Äôs a very tender place.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut you won‚Äôt take off the hand?‚Äù ‚ÄúI will do nothing without letting you know and having your consent, Colonel.‚Äù So he drank of oblivion and ceased to suffer, but his dream was not of home. ‚ÄúDoctor,‚Äù he muttered (talking in the ether sleep), ‚Äúthat‚Äôs my bridle hand, you know. Never can ride at the head of my regiment again if you take that off.‚Äù In a moment I held the bullet in my hand, and saw with joy that it was round and rather small, giving reason to hope that it had not shattered the bones badly in coming through, which could hardly have been the case had it been conical. No loose bone was to be felt, and I had the great pleasure of telling him, as he returned to consciousness, that there was good reason to hope that his ‚Äúbridle hand‚Äù would by and by hold the rein again. A smile of satisfaction and relief lit up the face which had till then been set in the resolve to bear the worst, and with the simple, hearty thanks which we surgeons had from the hundreds of men that night he was borne off to his blanket side by side with his officers. Pembroke, Bermuda. Although Winsor returned to private practice in Winchester, Massachusetts after his service, he continued to contribute to the State Board of Health, writing important state health reports such as \\"The Hygiene of School Houses\\" (1874), and \\"Water Supply, Drainage, and Sewerage from the Sanitary Point of View\\" (1876). He also founded the Unitarian Church of Winchester in 1865. Winsor died in Hamilton, Bermuda on February 25, 1889.

It is known for several works of art from the Magdalenian. Geography, geology and location The impressive Abri of Laugerie-Basse, named after the village, is located on the right side of the V√©z√®re valley, about 2 kilometers upstream from Les Eyzies. It was formed at the bottom of a 45 meters high and 500 meters long scarp slope of flat-lying limestones from the Coniacian. The 15-meter-deep Abri is located 15 meters above river level. Taking advantage of the natural conditions, the houses of Laugerie-Basse were built directly into the rocks so that building a back wall and the back half of the roof was dispensable. The prehistoric site consists of two abris: the main abri and 50 meters upstream the Abri of Marseilles. Between the abris and the V√©z√®re the D 47 runs from P√©rigueux to Les Eyzies. History In 1863 √âdouard Lartet and Henry Christy began for the first time with excavations on the main abri. At that time a small farm with a barn and a stable was standing on the excavation area. Lartet and Christy were succeeded by the Marquis de Vibraye and his assistant Franchet and shortly thereafter by Mass√©nat. The excavations on the main abri were rather chaotic for the next five decades. Only between 1912 and 1913 Denis Peyrony and Maury were able to proceed more systematically and make the first stratigraphy of the main abri. Maury then moved on to the hitherto disregarded Abri des Marseilles where he was active until 1920. Stratigraphy The stratigraphy in the main abri comprises archaeological material mainly from Magdalenian III and Magdalenian IV. There is also some marginal evidence of the Azilian. In the slope waste in front of the scarp slope remains from the Neolithic and the late Bronze Age were also discovered. The Abri de Marseilles offers a more detailed stratigraphic sequence: the original profile is still existing. From it one can conclude that the Magdalenians settled approximately 14,000 years ago directly on the existing bottom of the abri. They lived at the abri until the Magdalenian VI. Then a catastrophic collapse of the roof occurred and the settlement site was partly strewn with some huge slabs of rock and debris. Afterwards the people returned to this place, which is clearly evident from traces of settlement on and between the boulders. Thereafter the Abri des Marseilles sank completely into oblivion until the late Neolithic . Around 2000 BC members of the Artenac culture arrived who left an enormous, and in this magnitude inexplicable, ash and charcoal layer that covered the whole abri. Then further slides of the roof occurred bringing about a spectacular rock chaos with up to 10 meter high boulders. By now the main abri has been cleaned up completely, whereas the Abri des Marseilles has only been partially explored. Found artifacts Aurochs engraving Apart from stone artefacts and other tools, all in all approximately 600 art objects from the Magdalenian were recovered in Laugerie- Basse. In Laugerie-Basse Paul Hurault, 8th Marquis de Vibraye discovered in 1864 the \\"Immodest Venus\\" (French: V√©nus impudique) which gave its name to the genre of paleolithic Venus figurines. Shortly after that, around 1867-68, the Woman under the reindeer (la femme au renne) was discovered by Abb√© Landesque. A large part of these art objects is nowadays scattered in several museums all over the world. From the middle Magdalenian (stage IV) stem pierced bone rondels picturing chamoises and deer. Age The main abri was inhabited in the middle and upper Magdalenian as well as in the Azilian, which roughly corresponds to the time segment from 14,000 until 10,000 years BP. The Abri des Marseilles has had a longer settlement period, it had been inhabited during the entire Magdalenian and into the Neolithic which corresponds to the time segment from 17,000 until 7,000 years BP.

Although a similar story is told of Saint Hubert, the identification of the figure as Saint Eustace is based on the fact that Pisanello painted Saint Eustace in Sant'Anastasia. Saint Hubert's depiction in Italian art during this period is also unlikely.Gordon, p. 159 Saint Eustace is portrayed as a huntsman dressed in the height of court fashion, wearing a golden tunic and blue headdress. The patron was therefore given the opportunity to appreciate the work as a devotional piece in addition to identifying with the aristocratic pastime of hunting and chivalric ideology. The patron for whom the work was painted is, however, unknown. Suggested patrons include the Gonzaga and Filippo Maria Visconti. Leonello or Borso d‚ÄôEste, keen huntsmen, have also been proposed.Gordon, p. 163 It is possible that the saint could be a profile portrait of the patron.Dunkerton, p. 276 The hunting scene allowed Pisanello to demonstrate his considerable skill in depicting animals and birds in a naturalistic but decorative way. Drawings of them from pattern books were undoubtedly used.Dunkerton, p. 276 The animals are portrayed at various scales and scattered around a ‚Äòtipped-up‚Äô landscape not dissimilar to those visible in Netherlandish tapestries. The landscape's construction also demonstrates a familiarity with illuminations in manuscript hunting treatises, such as the canonical Livre de Chasse by Gaston Phoebus.Gordon, p. 160 The purpose of the blank scroll in the foreground of the painting is unknown. There is no evidence to suggest it ever contained any lettering. Its original intention may have been to carry the words of Christ to Saint Eustace or to bear a motto provided by the patron. It has been suggested, however, that the empty scroll is designed to demonstrate the superfluity of words in relation to images and thus refers to a contemporary humanist debate regarding the relative merits of poetry and art.Gordon, p. 189 During the course of its history, The Vision of Saint Eustace has been extensively repainted and retouched. Originally, the panel was taller (it has been cut at the top).Gordon, p. 156 The landscape has darkened because of the black underpaint and the use of malachite. The gold leaf in the tunic and harness has been regilded. Some animals, like the bear, have been entirely repainted. The saint's hat and face, however, are well preserved and the pastiglia (low gesso relief for decoration of some details), present in the harness, hunting horn and spurs, is original.Gordon, p. 156 The painting was bought by the National Gallery in 1895, catalogued as NG 1436, and is today on display in room 55.National Gallery webpage, see external links, accessed January 7, 2012 Notes References External links * National Gallery webpage, with good roving zoom view Paintings by Pisanello Collections of the National Gallery, London Mammals in art Horses in art Dogs in art Paintings of crucifixes Deer in art Rabbits and hares in art Birds in art Paintings of Saint Eustace ","title":"The Vision of Saint Eustace"},{"id":"34303982","text":"Little Arkansaw (also known as Jennings) is an unincorporated community in Boone County, Arkansas, United States.

She founded the Orange County Feminist Repertory Theater and the first chapter of the National Organization for Women in Orange County, California. Early personal life and education Rosalie Gresser Abrams was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1921. Her parents were Naomi and Albert Gresser. Eventually she married Maurice Abrams, and with their two children, they moved to Los Angeles, California in 1954. By 1960 they had moved to Anaheim. She obtained her bachelors (1971) and masters (1975), theater arts, from California State University, Fullerton. In the 1970s she took up tap dancing, and performed into her 80s. Career and activism Feminist activism in Orange County In September 1969, Abrams founded the first chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) in Orange County, California, which was also the first major feminist organization in the county. In 1970 she served as vice president and the following year, she was president. The organization would find its base membership with members of the Unitarian faith, where Abrams was an active member. Abrams stated that many of the women who attended did so in secret, not wanting their husbands to know, and that the term \\"women's liberation\\" was considered a \\"dirty word\\" at the time. That year, 1971, she found the Orange County Feminist Repertory Theater, one of the first feminist theaters in the U.S.. The theater served as a unique venue for subjects that weren't being covered by other theaters in the area, specifically related to politics and women's rights. That same year, Abrams wrote \\"Myth America: How Far Have You Really Come?\\" which allowed Abrams to express her political and social views, and help raise funds for the NOW chapter with the play's performance. The play's first performance was held in Sacramento at the first California NOW conference. Abrams and her husband funded the rental payments for the first pro-choice feminist women's health clinic in Orange County, in 1973. The couple, along with other members of NOW and regional churches, were active in fighting against violence towards pro-choice women's clinics. Abrams described their role as defending clinics \\"from being burned and destroyed, by staying overnight, sleeping in our cars, and securing the doors with our bodies.\\" Abrams, along with five other women, picketed the Orange County Medical Center, demanding women's rights for abortions, after 47 women were denied abortions at the hospital due to a moratorium being placed on the procedure. The moratorium was started after protests by physicians, claiming that they were overworked due to having to perform over 20 abortions a week. The protest was organized by Abrams and the newly founded Orange County NOW chapter. During the protest she carried a sign reading: \\"If Men Bore Children, Abortion Laws Wouldn't Exist.\\" Three years later the United States Supreme Court legalized abortion with Roe vs. Wade. In 1976, Abrams wrote and performed an original piece about Martha Beall Mitchell, which she performed during the bicentennial during the fifth annual California NOW conference. Educator and other political concerns Abrams used not only her performances as educational tools, but also has taught courses on feminist issues at various regional schools and colleges. She went on to become the \\"feminist consultant\\" for the psychology department at Fullerton College in 1975. She also did fundraising, lecturing, and facilitated discussion forums about the Civil Rights Movement, Sino-American relations, the Vietnam War, the Iraq War, the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, Central American politics and American labor rights. Later life and legacy In 1996, Abrams was awarded the Veteran Feminists of America Medal of Honor by NOW. As of 1997, Abrams had started a new program for the theater, focusing on local issues in the county and United States, believing that \\"...there are things that our country has been instrumental in doing that perpetuate the oppression of women all over the world.\\" Abrams was later diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and served as a greeter at the local Unitarian church. Rosalie Abrams died on January 4, 2010, from complications related to Alzheimer's disease. Political opinions and beliefs Abrams believed that despite strong efforts to unite women and fight sexism, those efforts \\"are now being slowly eroded.\\" She supported the passing of the Equal Rights Amendment, which she believed would help women reach not only general equality with men, but equality in the workplace. Abrams also believes that abortion rights are still in need of fighting, stating that, despite the success of Roe vs. Wade, \\"things don't happen in straight lines. The more successful you are, the worse the backlash becomes.\\" References 1921 births 2010 deaths American abortion-rights activists American women's rights activists California State University, Fullerton alumni Deaths from Alzheimer's disease Feminist theatre National Organization for Women people Actresses from Anaheim, California Actresses from Pittsburgh Neurological disease deaths in the United States 20th-century American dramatists and playwrights Activists from California ","title":"Rosalie Abrams"},{"id":"34304161","text":"Walter Lee \\"Newt\\" Joseph (October 27, 1896 ‚Äì January 18, 1953) was an American third baseman and manager in Negro league baseball.

When Colorado Springs was founded in 1871 there were already two cemeteries serving El Paso County but both were quickly found to be inadequate in serving the needs of the rapidly growing city. In 1874, the founder of Colorado Springs, General William Jackson Palmer, founded a new cemetery two miles from town. The original names were the Mount Washington or Mountain Home Cemetery. In 1877, the name was changed to Evergreen Cemetery. In 1875, the original 10 acres or so was deeded to the city of Colorado Springs and it has been a city owned and operated cemetery since then. In 1993 the cemetery was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The original 10 acres has grown to over 220 acres with 90,000 plus burials in 2014 and the cemetery still performs about 700 burials per year. Evergreen Cemetery is the final resting place of many of the people that built the city of Colorado Springs along with founders of many neighboring cities. It is also the final resting place of many of the people that made millions from the last Colorado gold rush, world renowned artists, writers and composers, philanthropists, captains of industry and business, Union and Confederate soldiers, sports figures, politicians, actors, and even an astronaut.

As the first stage of the Euregiobahn regional rail system, the service from Heerlen in the Netherlands, Herzogenrath, Kohlscheid and Aachen to Stolberg (Rhineland) came into operation in June 2001 until December 2015. The section from Stolberg - Hauptbahnhof to Stolberg-Altstadt was reopened to passengers, including the Stolberg-Altstadt station (formerly Stolberg (Rhineland) Hammer) and the stations at Stolberg Rathhaus and Stolberg M√ºhlener Bf. As a second stage the Eschweiler - Talbahn, Stolberg to Eschweiler-West Eschweiler Talbahnhof / Raiffeisen-Platz, Eschweiler-Nothberg to Eschweiler-Weisweiler and section of to Herzogenrath Alt-Merkstein, Herzogenrath August-Schmidt-Platz came into operation between September and December 2004. In December 2005, the route was extended via Alsdorf - Busch to Alsdorf - Anna Park. Finally the Euregiobahn opened two new stations in December 2007: Heerlen de Kissel and Eygelshoven Markt between Herzogenrath and Heerlen. Despite public protests in support of the Eschweiler Eschweiler- Aue was not reopened in 2004 for financial reasons. Owing to drastically reduced state funding, routes could at first be extended only sparingly. Construction of the new line from Eschweiler-Weisweiler to Langerwehe started in the summer of 2007 and it was opened on 14 June 2009. From that day trains ran from Eschweiler-Weisweiler to Langerwehe and finally in December 2009 the hourly service was extended to D√ºren. Since locations between Eschweiler- Nothberg and Langerwehe are now served by the Euregiobahn, the station at Nothberg on the Cologne‚ÄìAachen high-speed railway was closed in December 2009. November 2011 saw the first test ride on the next section of the ring to be completed, the stretch from Alsdorf - Anna Park to Alsdorf - Kellerberg and Alsdorf - Poststrasse. The official inauguration took place on 9 December 2011 when a special train on the Euregiobahn at 18:02, for invited guests only, left the Alsdorf-Anna Park track. The scheduled passenger service began on 11 December 2011. In June 2016, the ring between Stolberg, Herzogenrath and Alsdorf finally was inaugurated.

Musa's son Ahmad Pasha succeeded his father, and was the last Ridwan governor of Gaza, serving until 1690.Filiu, 2014, p. 28 Although he was noted to be amiable by disposition, he established a strict regime that was much less tolerant to Gaza's Jewish and Christian communities, which had prospered under Husayn Pasha's rule. The French consul of Jerusalem at the time, Chevalier d'Arvieux believed this policy was put in place because of Musa's fears of being portrayed as pro-Christian or pro-French; his brother Husayn Pasha headed a very tolerant and successful administration and was believed to have been deposed, imprisoned and executed by the Ottoman authorities for that reason.Meyer, p.98. Historian Dror Ze'evi described Musa as a \\"weak and unimpressive governor.\\" After the deaths of his niece Shaqra Khatun and her husband Assaf Pasha, custody of their children Muhammad Bey, Ali Bey and Mahmanud Khanim was transferred to Musa who was put in charge of their inheritance.Ze'evi, p.46. In 1663 Musa commissioned a restoration of the Great Mosque of Gaza and had his name inscribed on the mantle of its mihrab. Gaza still remained relatively prosperous under Musa's rule which was largely credited to the policies his predecessor Husayn Pasha put into place. The city continued to serve as the virtual capital of Palestine.

The Pakistan- administered portion is in the Khaplu tehsil, Ghanche District of Gilgit‚ÄìBaltistan and the Indian-administered portion is in the Nubra tehsil, Leh district of Ladakh. Chorbat stretches from the abandoned village of Khaplu to the Bogdang village of Nubra. The Khan of Chorbat moved his capital from Siksa (originally called \\"Chorbat\\") to Turtuk in the 18th century. These two villages (now in Pakistan and India respectively) are the largest villages of the Chorbat region.  Geography  Chorbat Valley near Hassanabad Chorbat Valley near Turtuk Chorbat is an indistinct region: \\"The precise dividing point from where the Chorbat area can be demarcated is at present not possible. The Chorbat area, during the last three centuries, continuously changed hands between the rulers of Khapalu and Ladakh.\\" at the border between Baltistan and Ladakh near the course of the Shyok River. It is marked by * the Chorbat La pass, the traditional border between Baltistan and Ladakh,: \\"The Chorbat Pass is the boundary of Baltistan in this direction; by this road also used to come Balti raiders, as the remains of a fort at Yogma Han≈´ prove, which the people of the valley had put up against them.\\" * the Chorbat village in Baltistan, now called Siksa, and * the town of Turtuk, presently in Nubra, which is considered its traditional capital.Nandini Mehta, Turtuk Diary, Outlook, 8 August 2011. Quote: \\"The Khan of Turtuk, Mohammad Khan Kacho of the Yabgo Dynasty of Chorbat Khaplu, to give him his title in full. His ancestors derived their power and wealth (now sadly reduced) from Turtuk's strategic location on a feeder road of the Silk Route going on to Central Asia via Skardu and Yarkand.\\" In the early decades of the Jammu and Kashmir princely state, there was a Chorbat (subdistrict) in the Baltistan (district). It stretched along the Shyok River valley from a village called Dou-U (Dawou) in the west to Chalunka in the east. Between the Chorbat village and the Chorbat La pass lies the Chorbat Lungpa valley. To the south of the Chorbat La pass, the Hanu valley carries a stream that flows down to join the Indus River near the village of Dah. The Chorbat Lungpa and Hanu valleys constituted the main route from Baltistan to Ladakh in the past. The villages in the Hanu valley as well as Dah are fortified, indicating that they experienced raids from Baltistan in the past. Being the main travel route between Baltistan and Leh, the route carried part of the Silk Road traffic, which enriched the people of Chorbat.Archita Suryanarayanan, In Ladakh‚Äôs Turtuk village, life goes on as it has since the 15th century, The Hindu, 13 October 2018. The main populated areas in Chorbat are in the Shyok River valley, comprising some 13 villages in present-day Baltistan, and 5 villages in Indian-administered Ladakh.Chorbat Valley Baltistan, VisitPakistanOnline.com, retrieved 28 July 2019. The area is said to have been originally settled by people from Ladakh. At present, the people display a mix of Ladakhi and Balti influences.: \\"The total Muslim population is about 2800 and except for a few families at Hundar (Ladakhi) all of their villages lie in the Chorbat area whose cultural belief system shows a mixture of Ladakhi and Balti influences.\\" Geographically, the wide valley of the Shyok river in \\"Lower Nubra\\" narrows to a mountain gorge near the Yagulung village (). The Shyok flows through the gorge until Khaplu, where the valley widens again.Shyok river valley between Diskit and Khaplu, OpenStreetMap, retrieved 28 July 2019. A string of villages dot this gorge, wherever possible along the banks of the river: Bogdang, Chalunka, Turtuk, Tyakshi, and Thang on the Indian side of the Line of Control; Franu, Siari, Piun, Siksa, Hassanabad, Marcha, Lunkha, and Dawou on the Pakistani side. The folklore includes all these villages in Chorbat. The valley is surrounded by high rising peaks of the Karakoram mountain range and the bank the Shyok River. The climate is hard with little rain and extremely cold winters due to proximity to Siachen Glacier and other peaks and glaciers. Chorbat occupies .  History  According to scholar Rohit Vohra, the original settlers of the area were Brog- pa Dards. Above the present day Turtuk stand the ruins of a large fortress built by them. The tradition holds that the Brog-pa Dards were Buddhist and lived under a constant danger of attack from the north, until two warriors from the 'west' called Chulli and Yandrung overran them. The Brog-pas are said to have fled and settled in the Hanu valley. The present day residents of Turtuk are divided into 'Chulli-pa' and 'Yandrung-pa', claiming descent from Chulli and Yandrung. At some later date (16th‚Äì17th centuries), Islamic missionaries came to the area. The traditions narrate the visits of 'Amir Kabir' (possibly Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani) and Sayyid Nur Baksh, who defeated the Buddhist lamas in debate and converted the people to Islam. A Yabghu (Tibetan spelling: Yagbo) family was in control of Khaplu from some uncertain date ( according to tradition). In the 18th century, the Chorbat area was given by the ruler Yabgo Yahya Khan of Khaplu to his son Yagbo Nasir Khan, who came to live in Turtuk. The present headman of Turtuk traces his descent to him.  Modern history  During the last three centuries, the Chorbat area alternatively came under the control of Khaplu and Ladakh. Between 1834‚Äì1840, the Dogra general Zorawar Singh conquered both Ladakh and Baltistan and made them part of the Sikh Empire. Under the Treaty of Amritsar, the areas were transferred to Maharaja Gulab Singh to form part of a new princely state of Jammu and Kashmir under the suzerainty of the British. Baltistan was at first administered as a with 15 , Chorbat being one of them. Later, Ladakh and Baltistan formed a joint whose capital alternated between Leh and Skardu for six months each year.  India‚ÄìPakistan conflicts  Indo-Pakistani War of 1947‚Äì1948 In 1947, after the independence of India and Pakistan, Pakistan launched a tribal invasion of Jammu and Kashmir, which provoked the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir to join India. The Gilgit Agency to the north rebelled and overthrew the Maharaja's administration. The Gilgit Scouts and the Muslim members of the Jammu and Kashmir State Forces stationed in the area organised themselves under the command of Colonel Aslam Khan, and launched an invasion on the Ladakh . By July‚ÄìAugust 1948, the Gilgit Scouts overran Kargil, Skardu and the Zoji La pass that connects Ladakh to the Kashmir Valley, reaching the vicinity of Leh. Position at the end of 1948 But Leh held, reinforced by air and a tortuous mountain caravan from Himachal Pradesh. The Indian Army raised a local militia called Nubra Guards under the command of 17-year old Chewang Rinchen, which reportedly blocked various passage routes to Leh.: Quoting Col. Mohammad Yusuf of Pakistan Army: \\"Our intelligence revealed that our repeated attacks in Nubra Valley were foiled by the personal valour of a 17 year old boy named Chhewang Rinchen; had we succeeded at Skuru, there would then have been no real obstacle to our capturing Leh.\\" The Gilgit Scouts were progressively pushed back beyond the line connecting the Chorbat La pass and Chalunka. The ceasefire line was established through these two points at the end of 1948. The entire Chorbat came under the control of Pakistan. (Bogdang, never a part of the , remained under Indian control.) Under Pakistani control, Gilgit dominated Baltistan, and both the regions were administered as a non- descript \\"Northern Areas\\" by the Federal government of Paksitan. Chorbat was merged into the Khaplu during this period. Two further wars were fought by India and Pakistan over Kashmir. In the 1965 war, the region saw some action, but the two countries returned to status quo after the war. However, the Khan of Turtuk, Yagbo Mohammad Khan Kacho, was apparently looted by the Pakistani Army of his throne and all other valuables. In the war of 1971, Rinchen's Nubra Guards, now part of Ladakh Scouts, proceeded to capture further areas of Chorbat. They first captured a peak at 18,620 feet overlooking Chalunka. Then the two companies of Karakoram Scouts defending Chalunka were overpowered, leading them to flee to Turtuk. Turtuk was then taken in four days, followed by Tyakshi and Thang. The villagers were frightened at first, but Rinchen put them at ease.Claude Arpi, Have you heard about this Indian Hero?, Rediff News, 22 December 2011.  Division between India and Pakistan  School girls in Turtuk After the 1971 war, India and Pakistan reached the Simla Agreement, whereby the ceasefire line of the war became the new Line of Control, permanently dividing Chorbat between India and Pakistan. The Baltis allege that the Pakistani prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto did not care about the Balti villages captured by India and neglected to negotiate their return.: Quoting a Balti soldier: \\"Pakistanis were not interested in these areas because they were mountain regions, although India was willing to return the villages [in the peace conversations of Simla in 1972]. The Pakistani Prime Minister Bhutto negotiated the return of villages in Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Lahore sector but not ours.\\" The villagers belonging to these villages changed their citizenship from Pakistan to India overnight. Reports indicate that India treated the villagers well and integrated them into the national mainstream. The Indian Army gets special praise in this regard.: 'Mohammad is very fond of the Indian army. ‚ÄúI admire the Indian army and all the help they provided us ‚Äì food, clothes, education. For me, upar Allah, niche Indian army,‚Äù he said.' However, the villagers that had gone to other parts of Pakistan before the war for trade, study or travel remained on the Pakistani side, never allowed to return to their homes.Shabbir Mir, Man reunites with father after 1971 war, The Express Tribune, 5 January 2016: \\"I was told my land and my family were no longer mine,\\" said Gafoor. \\"I had lost everything but hope to that war; hope for a reunion one day...\\" One member of a divided family reports going to the border carrying a white flag and a letter from the Indian Army, wanting to bring back his family. But he was detained by the Pakistani Army and refused return to home.: 'The unworldly villager, not knowing the consequences, told them that the Indian soldiers had not harmed them; instead they took good care of villagers. Hearing this, the Pakistani soldiers suspected him of being a spy for the Indian army and imprisoned him for six years.' Balti scholar Senge Sering states that Pakistan's Inter- Services Intelligence (ISI) has attempted to introduce jihad into this area. The local people are confused about their loyalties because they lived under both Pakistani and Indian control, some of them having served in the Pakistan Army before India's take-over. Many of them also have relatives living across the Line of Control who are subject to intimidation by the ISI. During the Kargil infiltration by Pakistan, some of the local people were suspected to have assisted the infiltrators. The Indian Army took some of them into custody, but later released all of them. The local people are said to be grateful for the consideration shown by the Army and currently support the Army's initiatives such as the Operation Sadbhavana.Senge H. Sering, \\"Reclaiming Nubra\\" ‚Äì Locals Shunning Pakistani Influences, Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, Delhi, 17 August 2009.  Alleged Indian intrusions  Pakistani sources allege that, in 1972, shortly after the signing of the Shimla Agreement, the Indian troops crossed the Line of Control (LoC) in the Chorbat La sector and seized about 4 square miles of Pakistani territory. In 1988, India again crossed the LoC and seized four Pakistani posts in the Qamar sector, which lies between the Chorbat Valley and NJ9842.How India de facto destroyed the Simla Agreement with Pakistan, voiceofeast.net, 10 August 2020. Resources The natural resources of the valley include agriculture, horticultural resources, the shyok River, mountains and peaks. The agriculture in the Valley is only summer based due to extreme cold in the winter where temperature goes to minus 10. The crops include some beans, maize and other food crops however communities have experimented less with the agriculture due to the natural limiting factors i.e. extreme cold. Chorbat valley consists of more than 13 villages in Pakistan and 5 villages in India. In Pakistan, the villages are Dawou, Marcha, Kuwas, Hassanabad, Partuk, Piun, Siksa, Kalaan, Sukhmos, Chhowar, Thongmus, Siari, & Franu, and in India, they are Doethang, Tyaqsi, Turtuk, Chalunka, and Beyoqdan. Surroundings The mountains and surrounding have generally no forests however there are some shrubs and herbs available which are generally used by the local communities as medicinal herbs, there is also a human-made forest of saplings which is the largest forest in the whole district. The Shyok River passing nearby the valley is one of the important resources of the area, irrigating the whole land. However the same river sometime creates havoc during summer through its unpredictable floods.

Like the vast majority of tachinid flies, Z. mima is expected to be a parasitoid of other arthropods, likely the larvae of Lepidoptera, however few or no host records exist. Identification Z. mima is morphologically similar to a number of other flies in the tribe Blondeliini, namely those in the genus Trigonospila. Like Trigonospila, Z. mima is distinctive for the alternating black and white transverse bars on the thorax. There are two whitish bars on the thorax; one adjacent to the transverse suture, and the second adjacent to the scutellum. There may also be a white triangle on the tip of the scutellum, and the subscutellum is usually white. Abdominal colouration distinguishes Z. mima from Trigonospila; the abdomen is largely brown or fulvous-yellow on the sides of the abdomen with a broad black stripe extending along the dorsal surface of the abdomen, terminating about the fourth segment. Z. mima is also easily distinguished from Trigonospila by other characters, including a heavy suffusion of black or brown along the wing margin, giving the appearance of a brown stripe adjacent to the wing margin and much longer antennae.

Mar. 27, 2015) at 4 n.1 Oral argument in the case was held in Seattle on February 6, 2015. The Ninth Circuit panel was composed of circuit judges Carlos T. Bea and Mary H. Murguia, and district judge William H. Orrick III, sitting by designation. On March 27, 2015, the Ninth Circuit panel unanimously affirmed the decision in favor of IMDb. Reaction and aftermath Two actors' unions, SAG and AFTRA, supported Hoang, saying that IMDb was \\"facilitating age discrimination\\". After the lawsuit was decided, the unions pressed the California legislature to enact legislation requiring Internet sites to remove birth dates and ages of entertainers upon their request. The legislature enacted the law, Assembly Bill 1687,Cal. A.B. 1687, enacted Sep. 24, 2016 in September 2016. In February 2018, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria struck down the law as violating the First Amendment. In June 2020, the Ninth Circuit affirmed Chhabria's judgement, holding that the statute was an unconstitutional content-based restriction that violated the First Amendment.IMDb.com v.

It is found in the sublittoral zone of the continental shelf north of Australia. Description Annachlamys flabellata grows to between and in length. The shell is inequivalve and moderately compressed. The right valve is more inflated and less convex than the left. The general shape is circular with two broad auricles extending on either side of the umbones. These have a straight hinge line which is exactly in line with the umbones. There are 18 to 20 broad radial ribs which are more prominent and have larger interstices between them on the right valve. There is also sculpturing in the form of concentric growth rings. Some or all of the ribs on the left valve are pink, orange or mauve, while the colour of the right valve is entirely white. The space between the ribs is narrower than in the otherwise similar, closely related species, Annachlamys reevei. On the inside of the valve there is often a red tinge or a concentric ring of red dots.Annachlamys flabellata Pecten site. Retrieved 2012-01-06.Annachlamys flabellata (Lamarck, 1819) Smithsonian: National Museum of Natural History. Retrieved 2012-01-06. Distribution and habitat Annachlamys flabellata is found on sandy seabeds in the neritic zone at depths of down to on the coasts of the Australian states of Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland and New South Wales, in New Guinea and in Indonesia. Biology Annachlamys flabellata is found lying on sandy seabeds covered with a thin layer of substrate. It is a filter feeder, drawing water into its gill chambers through a gap between the valves at the back of the shell. At the same time as oxygen is being absorbed by the gills, food particles, mostly microscopic algae, are sieved out and transported to the mouth and the water is expelled again. Individuals of Annachlamys flabellata become mature when they reach about in length. They seem to exhibit partial protandric sex reversal in that smaller individuals are mostly males but females predominate among larger individuals. Nevertheless, some small females do exist as do some large males. In lagoons in New Caledonia with little thermal variation, spawning takes place at intervals throughout the year but the maximum spawning period occurs in the summer from November to March. Other than this, spawning exhibits no correlation to sea temperature variations, changes in salinity and the phases of the moon. In mature individuals, the male gonads are cream coloured and the female gonads bright red. When ripe they are enlarged and visible in the live animal where they obscure the view of the animal's digestive tract. The eggs are fertilised externally and the initial trochophore larvae soon develop into veliger larvae which form part of the zooplankton and disperse with the currents. After some weeks, these settle and undergo metamorphosis before becoming juveniles.

It is a small scenic location near Wagamon en route to Peerumedu. Parunthin Para also known as 'Parunthumpara' (the eagle rock). From here, the Makarajyothi of Sabarimala is visible. The main attractions of Parunthumpara are Suicide Point and Tagor Head (a rock that appears to have the shape of Tagor, an Indian poet's, head). A nearby tourist spot is Thekkady. Parunthumpara is a small village, located between Peermade and Thekkady. The word parunth in the local language means Eagle and para means rock. It is called Parunthumpara or eagle rock because of a large area around like an eagle. It is 6 km from Peermade, 25 km from Thekkady and 3 km From National Highway 220.( Kottayam Kumily road). This area provides a bird's eye view of an endless stretch of green forest land and low-lying areas. Parunthumpara is six km from Peerumade on National Highway 220 and is increasingly being visited by tourists who are on their way to Thekkady and others as well. If the sky is clear, visitors can get the view of the Sabarimala forests. Easily accessible through the narrow ghat road from Kallar Junction, this hill station stands out for its sprawling grasslands where the families can enjoy a few quiet moments, away from the hustle and bustle of the city life. A perfect choice for those who wish to have a holiday off the beaten track and to explore the unseen and the unexplored beauty of the pristine forests around, Parunthumpara has been attracting a large number of domestic tourists during weekends. Though the place is yet to be included in the tourism map of the district, the place can stand up to any other hill stations. However, the steep hills also pose a threat to reckless visitors. There are a few deep slopes and one should be careful while visiting Parunthumpara. The District Tourism Promotion Council plans to develop Parunthumpara as a hill station and as a stopover place for tourists who come from Kumarakom to Thekkady. There are two main roads through which the domestic and international tourists reach the district ‚Äî from Nedumbassery to Munnar and from Kumarakom to Thekkady. Between these main tourism destinations, there are a few must-see places and Parunthumpara had been identified as one among them. But this place lacks basic facilities like lodging and boarding. A project had been submitted to the government for constructing a protective wall and for allotting a parking area so as to prevent the entry of vehicles on the grasslands.

Elmore Harris (b. February 23, 1855 Beamsville, Ontario ‚Äì d. December 19, 1911 Delhi, India). He was notable as the founder of the Walmer Road Baptist Church and one of the founders of Toronto Bible Training School in 1894 which soon changed its name to Toronto Bible College (now Tyndale University College and Seminary). Background Elmore Harris was the son of Alanson Harris (founder of A. Harris, Son & Co. Ltd.) & Mary Morgan. Elmore's paternal grandfather was John Harris an early Baptist pastor whose family had emigrated from New York state to the Oxford County area. Elmore's grandfather John Harris served in pastorates at Westminster (Middlesex County) and afterwards at Townsend (Haldimand County). Elmore's maternal grandfather was Thomas Morgan a minister originally from Wales who served in the U.S. and then in Southwestern Ontario. Elmore Harris married (September 7, 1877 at Brantford) Ruth Davidson Shenston (1858‚Äì1910). Ruth was the daughter of Thomas Strahan Shenston of whom the Shenstone Memorial Baptist Church in Brantford, Ontario is named. (See http://shenstonechurch.com). Together they had 5 children: Burton Shenstone, b. June 11, 1878; Helen Mary, b. February 1, 1881 (who became the mother of E. Harris Harbison); Frederick Morgan, b. June 12, 1886; Frank Elmore, b. December 7, 1890; Erdman Gordon, b. December 17, 1898. Elmore Harris was an uncle to Canadian painter Lawren Harris. Elmore remarried to Olive Marion Culham on September 6, 1911 in Toronto. Education He received his early education at the High School, Beamsville, and subsequently at St. Catharines Collegiate Institute. In 1877 Elmore Harris obtained a B.A. from the University of Toronto having previously left behind the family business to pursue pastoral studies. At the McMaster convocation in May 1899 the degree of Doctor of Divinity, D.D. was conferred. Pastorates From 1876 ‚Äì February 1882 Elmore served at Centre Street Baptist Church, St. Thomas where he succeeded Mr. Hurd. During his pastorate at Centre St. the membership nearly tripled and they built a new building. February 1882 ‚Äì October 15, 1889 Elmore served at Yorkville Baptist Church helping the church to expand into larger facilities at Bloor Street Baptist Church. (see Yorkminster Park Baptist Church (Toronto)). October 20, 1889 ‚Äì November 27, 1895 Elmore served in the pastorate at Walmer Road Baptist Church. Accomplishments During the years from 1871 to 1895, some 1,000 believers had been baptized by Mr. Harris. During his ministry in Toronto, 1882 to 1895, he organized the Bloor street church, Walmer road church, Ossington Avenue Baptist church, Century Baptist Church and Christie Street Baptist Church. Harris had a strong reputation for his expository preaching. On May 14, 1894, a group of lay people from the Toronto churches of St. Paul's Anglican, Knox Presbyterian and Walmer Road Baptist met to discuss the establishment of a training school for laypersons. This group was led by Elmore Harris, and included the well-known Casimir Gzowski Jr. (son of the builder of the Grand Trunk Railway and grandfather of broadcaster Peter Gzowski), Robert Kilgour of the Kilgour Brothers (a manufacturer of paper bags and paper boxes), John Drysdale Nasmith (a baker) and Samuel J. Moore of the business forms fame (a Sunday school leader at Dovercourt Road Baptist Church). The Toronto Bible Training School, established in 1894, resulting from this initiative, was designed to prepare laypersons to serve in the burgeoning programs of the newly developing YMCA, numerous Sunday schools springing up in Toronto and outlying areas, and a growing world movement in missions. In 1912 the name was changed to Toronto Bible College. (See Tyndale University College and Seminary). Elmore Harris served as the first President of the school. For many years Elmore Harris lectured at McMaster in Bible. In 1893 Elmore Harris joined the board of China Inland Mission-Toronto. From 1898-1903 Harris served on the Board of Governors of McMaster University. From 1906 Harris was Honorary lecturer on the English Bible at McMaster. It was stated of Elmore Harris that under his direction he had \\"done more than any other member of the Baptist denomination (whether clerical or lay), by influence and pecuniary aid, to further the cause of that church in Toronto and its suburbs.\\" Elmore Harris and his wife were at some point elected Life Members of the Upper Canada Bible Society. Upon his death he bequeathed to The Hospital For Sick Children, Toronto the payment of $2,000, been named in perpetuity in the Hospital in College street in 1912: ‚Äî \\"The Frank Elmore Harris Cot,\\" by bequest of the late Rev. Dr. Elmore Harris, Toronto; Beliefs During his tenure at Bloor Street Elmore became aware of the teaching of William Newton Clarke (1841-1912) a known Liberal theologian (who was a graduate of Hamilton Theological Seminary NY ‚Äì later Colgate Theological Seminary). Clarke taught New Testament Interpretation and Homiletics at the Toronto Baptist College from September 1883-early 1887. It undoubtedly had an influence on his later beliefs and desire to fend for the truth. Elmore Harris is named as one of the editors of the Scofield Reference Bible. He was Calvinistic and a proponent of Premillennialism and Dispensationalism. He was also an ardent Evangelical and helped build Gymnamsium YMCA type outreaches at Walmer Road Baptist Church. Harris was part of the editorial committee for the series of doctrinal tracts which were called The Fundamentals. He was considered to represent orthodox evangelical fundamentalism in the McMaster Divinity College controversy surrounding the modernist teachings of Isaac George Matthews (1871-1959) professor of Old Testament and Systematic Theology at McMaster University from 1904 to 1919 who began to be criticized in 1908, but kept his job. (Matthews had been a student pastor at First Baptist Church in Brantford (where the Harris family attended) and was a graduate of McMaster, obtaining his PhD from University of Chicago). Elmore Harris addressed the McMaster senate in 1908, \\"I feel that the attitude of the Old Testament Scriptures in the Chair of the Old Testament Literature in this institution is not the attitude of the Baptist denomination.\\"Horn (1999) p. 30 It was not only the lectures that concerned Harris but the books read by the students. Matthews view was to let the students figure things out for themselves. Harris believed that it was better for the students to be told what was right. Others like the dean of Theology (and professor of New Testament and Patristic Greek) Jones Hughes Farmer (1859-1928) noted that Baptists have always believed in personal freedom. (Ever after, McMaster was suspected by many Baptists as excessively liberal). Thomas Todhunter Shields began to take more of that role after the death of Elmore Harris. Elmore Harris was likely an organizer behind R. A. Torrey‚Äôs evangelistic campaign held at Massey Hall in Toronto around January 28, 1906. In March 1909 under the auspices of the Bible League of Canada Harris and others invited James Orr (theologian) to Toronto for a series of lectures. Elmore Harris was considered \\"a remarkable soul-winner.\\" It is also stated that he \\"lacked formal training in theology.\\" Notes References * Robertson, John Ross, (1904).

The word \\"Lanela\\" means \\"Lavanya Illa\\" which means \\"The Land with Beauty\\". Geological Survey of Lanela Ammonites Study of the Jurassic Rocks of Jaisalmer basin, Rajasthan. A research Project to evaluate ammonite fauna from the Jurassic rocks of Jaisalmer district was taken up during F.S. 1996‚Äê98 under Palaeontology Division of western region, Jaipur. Intensive field works were carried out in the area around Jaisalmer to study different litho‚Äêpackages and collect ammonite fauna to establish biozonation. The marine Jurassic succession of Jaisalmer basin has been classified into three distinct formations namely Jaisalmer, Baisakhi and Bedesar Formations in ascending order of antiquity. These are underlain by non‚Äêmarine sequence of Lathi Formation which has been dated as Liassic to Bathonian by Das Gupta (1975) and as Liassic by Lukose (1972). The calcareous Jaisalmer Formation is followed upward sequence by siliciclastic sediments of Baisakhi formation. The Baisakhi Formation in general, comprises shale, sandstone, siltstone and ironstone and is subdivided into Rupsi, Lodorva and lanella members in ascending order by Prasad (2006). The Rupsi and Lanella Members of the Formation contain profuse ammonites and can be dated as Early kimmeridgian to Late Kimmeridgian in age. The middle Lodorva Member is unfossiliferous. Geography and climate The area is sandy from one side, other side barren land, one side fertile Khadins are there and one side salt water lake is situated. Digitally processed satellite images have unearthed the hidden course of a major lost river below the sands of the Thar Desert, in the India‚ÄìPakistan (Indo-Pak) region. The great Himalayan river of the Vedic period (10 000‚Äì8000 BP) is mentioned in ancient Indian literature. It was called the ‚ÄòSaraswati‚Äô in India and the ‚ÄòHakra‚Äô in Pakistan and it dried up during 4000‚Äì3500 BP. Large numbers of archaeological sites from the Harappan civilization occur along the dry river bed. The mapped course of the river is 4‚Äì10 km wide and conforms to the size described in the Rigveda. The newly described course is validated through the drilling of tube wells in the channels and through archaeological, hydrogeological and sedimentary data. An enormous quantity of potable water has been found along these channels. The path of the (main) river course, the likelihood of the river shift and the reasons for its disappearance are discussed.

She was especially influenced by Expressionism, which began in Germany and her native Austria during her childhood.Vzplanut√≠ / Olomouc Museum, Czech Republic: Expresionistick√© tendence ve (Expressionistic Tendency of) St≈ôedn√≠ Evropƒõ 1903-1936, page 108 In 1939 she and her husband, Oscar T. Krasso, fled Austria for Mumbai (Bombay), India. While there, she asked Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi for permission to sketch him in person. At first, he refused, stating he did not seek publicity for himself, but when he heard that she was a refugee from her own country, he allowed her to make life sketches of him for one month.Interview and article in The Paper, a community newspaper, South Plainfield, NJ (January 1974) From these drawings she created a 7' by 4 1/2' oil painting of Gandhi in the Old Master style in 1945. The same year, she had a one-man show in Mumbai. Art Education In Mumbai, she began a children‚Äôs art movement in the schools. Paintings were exchanged between students in India and the United States. Some of these paintings are owned by the Columbia University Library, the Montclair Art Museum, the New York Public Library and Denver Art Museum. From 1948 to 1951 Lichtwitz Krasso taught at the Parsons School of Design in New York City, introducing puppetry to the school. In 1952, she received a Bachelor's Degree from New York University and taught in the New York City school system. She developed a system of art education for the non-congenital blind, based on the idea that people who have previously experienced color, form and space, can remember them to a certain degree. Art Techniques Lichtwitz Krasso fused Old Master techniques with those of Modern Art. She combined and adapted such Old Master elements as representational figures and applying different layers of paint with Modern Art‚Äôs distorted figures and changes in perspective. In the 1950s to the 1970s she worked in collage, often using found objects and creating sculpted or raised surfaces. Most of her later paintings were done with acrylic paint instead of oil. She experimented with acrylic polymer (plastic) media, for its bright clear color and resistance to dampness. She used acrylic polymer to make a kind of modeling paste or by soaking a cloth with this paste and sculpting it, to create a bas-relief effect. Her collages often employed common articles such as shells, nets, paper, and even bicycle chains. Legacy Lichtwitz Krasso has a series in the Albertina Museum in Vienna, and her work is in the Museum of Modern Western Art in Moscow for its permanent collection, now the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts and the Leningrad Art Museum, and in the Olomouc Museum of Art in the Czech Republic.

The subcentral TIPNIS, the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB), and the highland indigenous confederation CONAMAQ‚Äîsupported by other indigenous and environmental groups‚Äîorganised a march from Trinidad, Beni to the national capital La Paz in opposition to the project, beginning on 15 August 2011. The highway project was supported by domestic migrants, highland indigenous groups affiliated with peasant organizations, and the government. During the protests the lowland tribes peoples briefly held Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca in their protests so as to pass through a police roadblock.Bolivia's foreign minister briefly held at Amazon highway protest Newser, 27 September 2011 Defense Minister Mar√≠a Chac√≥n Rend√≥n later resigned as a result of the violent crackdown on protests on 24 September that caused four deaths; due to the adverse reaction to the government crackdown Interior Minister Sacha Llorenty also resigned. On 19 October the protest march reached the capital city of La Paz amid welcomes from the local population and the Information Minister, as security services were withdrawn from their posts guarding the presidential palace. Protests were held in the national capital La Paz, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Yucomo, Rurrenabaque, Trinidad, San Antonio, El Alto and Beni. In April 2012, a new round of protest marches commences in protest against Morales' continued support for the project. Background Despite the election of the first ever indigenous president, Evo Morales, indigenous groups have intermittently continued social protests. In 2008, the predominantly European- origin residents of Bolivia's eastern lowland provinces were successfully resisted by the indigenous groups with the solidarity of highland indigenous groups, though it was after violent protests and deaths. In 2009, the European-Bolivians also tried to protest Morales' attempts at a new constitution that would increase his term limit. However, a compromise that Morales would not run again led to the creation of a new constitution and the establishment of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. Another provision in the new constitution explicitly referred to the defence of the communal rights of the indigenous communities over their traditional tribal lands. However, a regional election that was won by right-wing party was widely celebrated in that part of Bolivia. In 1990, Morales, as a union leader in the March for Territory and Dignity, had helped create the indigenous autonomy territories. Morales' primary support base is from the coca-growing Aymara and Quechua tribes in the Chapare region. However, in the part of the Amazon Basin where the highway was scheduled to be built, they are known as \\"colonists\\" for having migrated to the region. He came to power on the promise of ending discrimination and marginalisation. Morales said that the US$420 million, highway project, funded by Brazil in the quest to access the Pacific Ocean, would be a principal part of his infrastructure plan. The highway would connect the agricultural region of Beni with the commercial crossroad of Cochabamba; it would also reduce travel time by half as it short-circuits Santa Cruz, a region that had opposed Morales' presidency. In June, he said that the highway would go ahead \\"whether they (indigenous groups) like it or not\\". In response, indigenous leaders, who had in the past been supportive of Morales, reacted adversely; this caused a rift within the ruling Movement Toward Socialism party. Some MPs of the party expressed their support for the protesters, as well as the demands of the roughly 12,000 residents of the Isiboro Secure Indigenous Territory and National Park (which is both a national park and an autonomous territory that is under the auspices of the Yuracare, Moxeno and Chiman indigenous peoples) in the Amazon Basin, which is home to 64 indigenous tribes and where the highway was proposed to be built. A study conducted prior to the protests estimated that 64 percent of the national park would be deforested in less than 18 years. Furthermore, the highway could lead to land grabs by loggers and cocaleros. The protesters also feared an \\"invasion\\" of migrants following the construction of the highway.  Parallels  Similarly, prior to the victory of left-wing candidate Ollanta Humala in Peru's election, several thousand indigenous Quechua tribes people blocked the border with Bolivia (whose post-colonial boundaries divide the Quechua tribes into at least two states) in protest against mining contracts given to a Canadian company that they said would poison Lake Titicaca, their principal source of water. They too vowed to continue their protests after Humala's election. Similarly, in March 2012, protesters in Ecuador began a cross-country march against fellow pink tide President Rafael Correa's policies for mining in the Amazon. Goals In addition to the cancellation of the highway project, protesters also demanded the resignation of President Evo Morales following a bloody crackdown on protesters. Other demands by the protesters also included a cessation of oil and gas extraction projects in the Aguarag√ºe National Park and Integrated Management Natural Area, as well as compensation for the effects of global warming. Protest marches The initial protest started in mid-August as activists from the Amazon Basin left Trinidad in the hope of reaching the national capital of La Paz to protest Morales' initiative. More than 1,700 protesters, including pregnant women and children, joined the 375-mile trek. Following a march of over a month, the protest group reached the outskirts of Yucumo, a predominantly pro-government town, where pro- and anti-government groups clashed. Following more than a week of protests, the marchers staged a larger demonstration in which they sought to circumvent a police crackdown by forcefully holding Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca to march with them. A group of female marchers grabbed Choquehuanca and insisted that he lead them through the police cordon that separated them from pro-government marchers so they could continue their journey to La Paz. Several government officials, including Minister of Interior Sacha Llorenty and Minister of Transparency Nardi Suxo, said that this was a \\"kidnapping\\" (secuestro), but Choquehuanca steadfastly refused to label it as such, saying that \\"the sisters and [female] comrades grabbed me, surely they had thought that they would pass that police encirclement with the Chancellor; I was not insulted, nor mistreated, but yes, they obliged me to walk.\\"\\"Las hermanas y compa√±eras me agarraron, seguramente han pensado que pasar√≠an con el canciller ese cerco policial, no he recibido insultos, no me maltratan pero si me obligan a caminar.\\" Prosecutor Patrica Santos, who was charged with investigating the events, received Choquehuanca's testimony to this effect on 21 November. On 25 September, the protesters' arrival in the Yucomo region led to police firing tear gas and detaining some protesters; it also led to several injuries and four deaths. Maria Carvajal, a rights activist, said that the police attacked the protest camp with \\"extreme violence\\" and that she \\"could not believe what was happening\\". The next day, protesters returned and set barricades on fire at the airport runway in Rurrenabaque in order to secure the release of 300 protesters who had been arrested, according to Mayor Yerko Nunez. Protests also occurred in the capital city of La Paz as riot police organized a security cordon around the Quemada government building, where thousands of protesters denounced the crackdown. Solidarity protests were also held in Cochabamba (the scene of similar anti-government riots prior to Morales taking office, which some said were instrumental in leading the social movements that brought Morales to powerStone, Oliver. South of the Border.), with student protests and members of the Aymara and Quechua indigenous peoples beginning a hunger strike. Other protests were also held in the Beni province and in Santa Cruz. On 28 September, several thousands again gathered to protest against the government crackdown and to defend the national park. The Central Obrera Boliviana called for a 24-hour general strike;Bolivia: General Strike Protests Crackdown on Native March though some businesses stayed open, schools and medical services were affected. The strikers marched outside the capital of La Paz to El Alto chanting \\"Evo is a fascist!\\" and \\"Evo is a lackey of Brazilian companies,\\" miners burnt sticks of dynamiteAFP: Bolivia leader asks for pardon after massive strike and the marches caused traffic delays.Bolivia protests stall traffic  Travel News The protesters were said to be encouraged by the solidarity protests in the urban areas and the general strike; they then said that the protest march would continue. One protest leader, Mariana Guasania, told a group of about 200 protesters in Rurrenabaque: \\"Long live this historic march...the march goes on\\" in the quest to see a law that would guarantee the highway would bypass the national park. On 30 September, over 10,000 protesters in La Paz carried banners that criticized Morales on the grounds that his government was \\"the worst and it should go because it attacked human beings, the indigenous compatriots who had given it their support, and now it's turned its back on them;\\" they also questioned his commitment to the rights of the indigenous peoples and the protection of \\"Mother Earth\\", that he had advocated during his election campaign.PressTV ‚Äì Bolivians protest Amazon road As of 30 September, protesters said they would further their protests even though Morales said that \\"the roads construction is suspended until the national debate is over.\\" Protests resumed over the weekend of 1 October, with about 1,000 demonstrators continuing the unfinished stretch of 250 km to La Paz. Adolfo Chavez, an indigenous leader, said that \\"We have resumed the march and our intention is not to clash with anybody. Instead of accusing the indigenous people, what the government should do is resolve the problem of the road once and for all.\\" On 19 October, almost 2,000 protesters reached the capital city of La Paz. Despite the suspension of the project the protest march continued in order to see the project canceled. Fifteen hundred protesters started the march to be joined by up to tens of thousands of protesters, according to the Al Jazeera English. As the protesters entered the city, people in La Paz cheered them by waving Bolivian flags and white handkerchiefs. As a gesture of goodwill both police and riot control vehicles were withdrawn from their positions outside the presidential palace, while the information minister offered an official welcome to the protesters.Bolivian protesters arrive in La Paz ‚Äì Americas ‚Äì Al Jazeera English 2012 Several hundred indigenous protesters began a 580-kilometer march from the eastern Amazon lowlands region to the legislative capital of La Paz in opposition to Morales' continued support for the highway project. The organizers said that if the government's support for the project continued there would be more violence. Simultaneously there were indigenous protests in Peru. Response Morales' immediate reaction to the protests was to call the marchers \\"enemies of the nation.\\" He also sought to discredit them by saying they had been brainwashed by NGOs and saying the march was yet another attempt by the U.S.A. at expanding their imperialism. Morales had said that a referendum would be held over the project in the Cochabamba and Beni departments following protests by farmers from the 16 tribes of the national park in San Antonio. He has also previously said that he would work to ensure illegal settlers in the national park were evicted. On 28 September, following the march to El Alto, he said that \\"we ask for forgiveness ‚Äì forgive me. [The crackdown] was not an instruction by the president. No one in the government would have thought such an attack could happen to our indigenous brothers.\\" He also called the protests a \\"wake-up call.\\" However, Rosario Barradas, a leader of the Conference of Indigenous People, responded to the statement saying that \\"we don't believe what he says anymore. We are reorganising to continue this. We are not going to stop until this is solved.\\" Despite the concessions, Jhonny an Osomomo chief said that: \\"If they build it correctly, so that it skirts the reserve, a road could be a good thing. For example, we have very few health supplies and doctors here and it could help keep our children healthy.\\"Bolivia's Morales suspends road project ‚Äì Americas ‚Äì Al Jazeera English In response to the crackdown on 25 September, government officials, including Defense Minister Mar√≠a Chac√≥n Rend√≥n and the ombudsman, as well as opposition figures criticised the government's reaction. Chacon said that \\"This is not the way! We agreed to do things differently.\\" She also announced her resignation. However, Communications Minister Ivan Canelas said that the police had no choice but to respond as they did. \\"The march [in the Yucumo region] was defused because it had become a source of violence.\\" Morales' Interior Minister Sacha Llorenty, who had come under pressure for his handling of the crisis, also resigned,Bolivian interior minister resigns over protest crackdown along with his deputy Marcos Farfan. On 11 October, the Chamber of Deputies of Bolivia had approved the President's decision to consult with local indigenous tribes regarding the project. ;Cancellation On 21 October 2011, Morales announced a possible postponement or cancellation of the proposed Amazon highway. Morales passed a law through the Bolivian Congress that would prohibit construction of a highway through the national park. International ‚Äì Following the clash in Yucomo, the United Nations' delegate in the country, Yoriko Yasukawa, said that \\"the most important thing for us is that they stop the violence as soon as possible. And to remind the authorities that it is their responsibility to stop violence and protect the people.\\" ‚Äì The Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador sent Morales a letter of concern. ;Media The Guardian wrote that: > Having nationalised gas and oil and introduced some immediate measures of > social welfare, it seemed that the government of Morales would indeed, as he > movingly declared at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, give priority to the > protection of \\"Pachamama\\" and the long neglected rights of Bolivia's first > nations.

The BBC echoed the sentiment saying that Morales is accused of \\"authorising excessive police force\\" and \\"putting economic development ahead of the conservation of the Amazon rainforest.\\" It also added that the social movements that supported him initially have now turned against him. It concluded that: > With opinion polls suggesting Mr Morales' popularity is falling, some > commentators are wondering if he will see out his second term in office, due > to end in early 2015. Or will he leave power like the two previous > presidents, fleeing to escape mass protests by social movements who have > learned that, in Bolivia, politics is made on the streets. Analysis Following the 2011 Bolivian judicial election, which resulted in a poor valid vote count after a campaign by the opposition to either boycott the election or cast blank ballots, Morales' standing was read as having been set back.

Kusari is a type of armour used by the samurai class and their retainers in feudal Japan. When the word kusari is used in conjunction with an armoured item it usually means that the kusari makes up the majority of the armour defence.A Glossary of the Construction, Decoration and Use of Arms and Armor: In All Countries and in All Times, George Cameron Stone, Courier Dover Publications, 1999 p. 403 History and description Rare 1800s photograph showing kusari katabira (chain armour jackets) and hachi gane (forehead protectors) with kusari shikoro (chain armour neck guards) being worn. The Japanese had more varieties of mail than all the rest of the world put together. Kusari was used in samurai armour at least from the time of the Mongol invasions (1270s) but particularly from the Nanboku-ch≈ç period (1336‚Äì1392).Brassey's Book of Body Armor, Robert C. Woosnam-Savage, Anthony Hall, Brassey's, 2002 p.92 Kusari was typically made with rings that were much smaller than their European counterparts, and patches of kusari were used to link together plates and to drape over vulnerable areas such as the underarm. Most common parts of samurai armour could be made with kusari as the main armour defense as well as many types of garments including jackets, hoods, gloves, vests, shin, shoulder, thigh guards, even kusari tabi socks. Kusari gusoku (chain armour) was commonly used during the Edo period 1603 to 1868 as a stand-alone defense. According to George Cameron Stone, > \\"Entire suits of mail kusari gusoku were worn on occasions, sometimes under > the ordinary clothing\\". During most of the Edo period, traditional armour was for the most part relegated to ceremonial use and as a display of wealth, power, class and rank, while lightweight portable armour and armoured clothing such as tatami armour and kusari karabira were still in use. While large battles were a thing of the past, revolts, peasant uprisings, clan conflicts, individual duels, assassination attempts etc. ensured that samurai still needed some kind of armour protection.Secrets of the samurai: a survey of the martial arts of feudal Japan, Authors Oscar Ratti, Adele Westbrook, Publisher Tuttle Publishing, 1991, , P.196 Edo period samurai police officers (machi-kata doshin) wore kusari garments for protection when making an arrest, Taiho- Jutsu: Law and Order in the Age of the Samurai, Don Cunningham, Publisher Tuttle Publishing, 2004, , P.46 and Ian Bottomley in his book Arms and Armor of the Samurai: The History of Weaponry in Ancient JapanIan Bottomley& A.P.

The end of the samurai era in the 1860s, along with the 1876 ban on wearing swords in public, marked the end of any practical use for mail and other armour in Japan. Japan turned to a conscription army and uniforms replaced armour.The connoisseur's book of Japanese swords, K≈çkan Nagayama, Kodansha International, 1998 p.43 Types of kusari The Japanese used many different weave methods including: a square 4-in-1 pattern (so gusari), a hexagonal 6-in-1 pattern (hana gusari) and a European 4-in-1 (nanban gusari),Ian Bottomley& A.P.

Butted or split/twisted links Butted and or split (twisted) links made up the majority of kusari links used by the Japanese. Links were either butted together meaning that the ends touched each other and were not riveted, or the kusari was constructed with links where the wire was turned or twisted two or more times. These twisted links are similar to the modern split ring commonly used on key chains. Twisted links always connected to a center butted link. Both butted and twisted links could be used on the same armour item with butted links covering certain areas and twisted links on another. =Butted links= File:6 in 1 doubled up butted kusari 2.jpgDouble butted 6 in 1 kusari.

Kusari examples Kusari was commonly used to connect the armour plates on the sangu (three extremity armours), the haidate (thigh armour), suneate (shin armour), and kote (armored sleeves), the armour for these items could also be composed almost entirely of kusari. Kusari was also used to connect the armour plates on many types of tatami armour. Kusari could also be used as the main armour for the dou/d≈ç (chest armour), for the kusazuri (tassets) of the dou/d≈ç and on the sode (shoulder armour). Many types of Japanese auxiliary armours used kusari in their construction or as the mail armour defense. Kusari katabira (chain armour jackets) were a common armour item as well as kusari zukin (chain armour hoods).
