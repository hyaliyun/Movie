By targeting prominent citizens and intellectuals for elimination, the Nazis hoped to prevent anti-Nazi activity and to weaken the resolve of the Polish resistance movement. According to an eyewitness the executions were carried out by an Einsatzgruppe unit (Einsatzkommando zur besonderen Verwendung) under the command of Karl Eberhard Schöngarth with the participation of Ukrainian translators in German uniforms.Zygmunt Albert, Kaźń profesorów lwowskich w lipcu 1941 roku, Warszawa 2004. Background Before September 1939 and the Nazi invasion of Poland, Lwów, then in the Second Polish Republic, had 318,000 inhabitants of different ethnic groups and religions, 60% of whom were Poles, 30% Jews and about 10% Ukrainians and Germans.Mały Rocznik Statystyczny 1939 (Polish statistical yearbook of 1939), GUS, Warsaw, 1939 The city was one of the most important cultural centers of interwar Poland, housing five tertiary educational facilities including Lwów University and Lwów Polytechnic. It was the home for many Polish and Polish Jewish intellectuals, political and cultural activists, scientists and members of Poland's interwar intelligentsia. After Lwów was occupied by the Soviets in September 1939, Lwów University was renamed in honor of Ivan Franko, a major Ukrainian literary figure who lived in Lwów, and the language of instruction was changed from Polish to Ukrainian.Roger Dale Petersen, Understanding ethnic violence: fear, hatred, and resentment in twentieth-century Eastern Europe, Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 124 Lwów was then captured by German forces on 30 June 1941 after the German invasion of the Soviet Union. Along with German Wehrmacht units, a number of Abwehr and SS formations entered the city. During the Nazi occupation, almost all of the 120,000 Jewish inhabitants of the city were killed, within the city's ghetto or in Bełżec extermination camp. By the end of the war, only 200–800 Jews survived. To control the population, prominent citizens and intellectuals, particularly Jews and Poles, were either confined in ghettos or transported to execution sites such as the Gestapo prison on Pełczyńska Street, the Brygidki Prison, the former military prison at Zamarstynów and to the fields surrounding the city — in the suburb of Winniki, the Kortumówka hills and the Jewish Cemetery. Many of those killed were prominent leaders of Polish society: politicians, artists, aristocrats, sportsmen, scientists, priests, rabbis and other members of the intelligentsia. This mass murder is regarded as a pre-emptive measure to keep the Polish resistance scattered and to prevent Poles from revolting against Nazi rule. It was a direct continuation of the infamous Ausserordentliche Befriedungsaktion, one of the early stages of Generalplan Ost, after the German campaign against the USSR started and the eastern half of prewar Poland fell under German occupation in place of that of the Soviet Union. One of the earliest Nazi crimes in Lwów was the mass murder of Polish professors together with some of their relatives and guests, carried out at the beginning of July 1941. History Monument to the victims in Wrocław, Poland By 2 July 1941, the individual, planned executions continued. At approximately 3 o'clock in the evening Prof. Kazimierz Bartel was arrested by one of the Einsatzgruppen operating in the area. During the night of 3/4 July, several dozen professors and their families were arrested by German detachments – each one consisting of an officer, several soldiers, Ukrainian guides and interpreters.Aneks do Informacji o działalności Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej – Komisji Ścigania Zbrodni przeciwko Narodowi Polskiemu od 1 stycznia do 31 grudnia 2006 r., Oddziałowa Komisja w Rzeszowie, zbrodnie nazistowskie, sygn. akt S 5/03/Zn, pp. 36–37 The lists were prepared by their Ukrainian students associated with OUN.Zygmunt Albert, Kaźń profesorów lwowskich – lipiec 1941/studia oraz relacje i dokumenty zebrane i oprac. przez Zygmunta Alberta Wrocław 1989, Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Wrocławskiego; , s. 180–181IPN — Oddziałowa Komisja w Rzeszowie, \\"Śledztwo w sprawie zabójstwa profesorów polskich wyższych uczelni, członków ich rodzin oraz współmieszkańców, we Lwowie w lipcu 1941 roku, podjęte na nowo z umorzenia w dniu 25 lutego 2003 roku. sygn.

The detainees were transported to the Abrahamowicz's dormitory, where despite the initial intention to kill them, they were tortured and interrogated. The head of the department in the Jewish hospital, Adam Ruff, was shot during an epileptic attack. In the early morning of 4 July, one of the professors and most of his servants were set free while the rest were either brought to the Wulka hills or shot to death in the courtyard of the Bursa Abrahamowiczów building. The victims were buried on the spot, but several days after the massacre their bodies were exhumed and transported by the Wehrmacht to an unknown place.Jak ginęły elity Rzeczypospolitej, dziennik.krakow.pl, 23 April 2007. There are accounts of four different methods used by the German troops. The victims were either beaten to death, killed with a bayonet, killed with a hammer, or shot to death.

Responsibility Walter Kutschmann in Argentina, 4 January 1975 The decision was made at the highest level of Nazi Germany's leadership.The decision regarding Kazimierz Bartel, former Polish Prime Minister, was taken by Heinrich Himmler. The direct decision maker of the massacre was the commander of the Sicherheitspolizei (Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD- BdS) in Krakau District of the General Government, Karl Eberhard Schöngarth. The following Gestapo officers also participated: Walter Kutschmann, Felix Landau, Heinz Heim (Chief of Staff Schöngarth), Hans Krueger and Kurt Stawizki. None of them were ever punished for their roles in the Lwów massacre.Wacław Szulc Wyniki śledztwa w sprawie mordu profesorów lwowskich, prowadzonego przez Główną Komisję Badania Zbrodni Hitlerowskich w: Zygmunt Albert Kaźń profesorów lwowskich – lipiec 1941/studia oraz relacje i dokumenty zebrane i oprac. przez Zygmunta Alberta Wrocław 1989, Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Wrocławskiego; , s. 177–185 ; main article in English, German and Russian. Kutschmann lived under a false identity in Argentina until January 1975, when he was found and exposed by journalist Alfredo Serra in the resort town of Miramar. He was arrested ten years later in Florida, Buenos Aires, by Interpol agents but died of a heart attack in jail before he could be extradited to then West Germany, on 30 August 1986.Gente magazine, issue 2417 , gente.com.ar; accessed 4 December 2014. Some sources contend that members of the Ukrainian auxiliaries from the Nachtigall Battalion were responsible for the murders. According to Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, this claim originated with the Soviet sources and has been disputed. Memorial has published documents which claim to document the Nachtigall participation in those events as a KGB disinformation. Stanisław Bogaczewicz, of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance said that Nachtigall soldiers took part in the arrests, but not in the murders, and that their role in this event needs further investigation.Biuletyn IPN – Kaźń profesorów lwowskich w lipcu 1941 roku], ipn.gov.pl; accessed 4 December 2014. Sociologist Tadeusz Piotrowski noted that while the Nachtigall role is disputed, they were present in the town during the events, their activities are not properly documented, and that at the very least they are guilty of the passive collaboration in this event, for not opposing the atrocities. According to a Lviv historian, Vasyl Rasevych, the claims that Ukrainians participated in the July 1941 massacre are untrue and that no archival evidence exists to support this contention., radiosvoboda.org; accessed 4 December 2014. Aftermath After World War II the leadership of the Soviet Union made attempts to diminish the Polish cultural and historic legacy of Lwów. Crimes committed east of the Curzon line could not be prosecuted by Polish courts. Information on the atrocities that took place in Lwów was restricted. In 1960, Helena Krukowska, the widow of Włodzimierz Krukowski, launched an appeal to a court in Hamburg. After five years the West German court closed the judicial proceedings. A West German public prosecutor claimed the people responsible for the crime were already dead, however Hans Krueger, commander of the Gestapo unit supervising the massacres in Lwów in 1941, was being held in a Hamburg prison, having been sentenced to life imprisonment for the mass murder of Polish Jews of the Stanisławów Ghetto committed several weeks after his unit was transferred from Lwów. As a result, nobody has ever been held responsible for the killings of the academics. In the 1970s, Abrahamowicz Street in Lviv was renamed Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński Street. Various Polish organisations have made deputations to remember the victims of the atrocity with a monument or a symbolic grave in Lviv. The case of the murder of the professors is currently under investigation by the Institute of National Remembrance. In May 2009, the monument to the victims in Lviv was defaced with red paint bearing the words \\"Death to the Lachs [Poles]\\"., wiadomosci.gazeta.pl; accessed 4 December 2014. On 3 July 2011, a memorial dedicated to the Polish professors murdered by the Gestapo on 4 July 1941 opened in Lviv.

Life and career 200x200px Born in Berlin, the son of an innkeeper, Wels in 1891 began an apprenticeship as a paper hanger and joined the SPD. From 1895 to 1897 he served in the German Army. From 1906 he worked as a trade union official, party secretary in the Province of Brandenburg and the Vorwärts press committee. In 1912 he was elected to the Reichstag and with the support of August Bebel joined the SPD executive committee the next year. In the German Revolution of 9 November 1918, Wels was a member of the Berlin Workers' council (Arbeiter-und Soldatenrat) of the SPD and USPD. He was appointed military commander of the city and consequently had to deal with the occupation of the Stadtschloss by revolutionary forces including violent fights with Freikorps units. Upon the election of Friedrich Ebert as Reich President on 11 February 1919 he acted as presiding officer of the SPD and was formally elected chairman, together with Hermann Müller, on 14 June. In 1920, Wels and Carl Legien organised the general strike that helped defeat the right-wing Kapp Putsch, after which Wels enforced the resignation of his party colleague Gustav Noske as Reich Minister of Defence. He argued for the foundation of the Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold and the Iron Front paramilitary organisations against the rising paramilitary forces of the SA, Der Stahlhelm and Rotfrontkämpferbund. From 1923 Wels also became a member of the executive of the Labour and Socialist International. After the 1930 Reichstag election, Wels advocated the toleration of the cabinet of Chancellor Heinrich Brüning, who had lost the support of the DNVP deputies. Even after the Preußenschlag of July 1932 against Otto Braun's government in the Free State of Prussia, he spoke against a general strike, but after the Reichstag election of November 1932 he rejected any negotiations with the new chancellor, Kurt von Schleicher.  Enabling Act  On 23 March 1933 Wels was the only member of the Reichstag to speak against Adolf Hitler's Enabling Act (the \\"Law for Removing the Distress of People and Reich\\"). The vote took place during the last session of the multiparty Reichstag, on 23 March 1933. Because the Reichstag building had suffered heavy fire damage in February, the March session was held in Berlin's Kroll Opera House. Despite the incipient persecution of opposition politicians and the presence of the SA, he made a speech opposing the Enabling Act, which gave the Reich cabinet the right to pass laws without the consent of the Reichstag for a period of four years. The Social Democrats were inventive and resistant but eventually overpowered by the Nazis. He stated: Speaking directly to Hitler, Wels proclaimed, All 94 SPD members of parliament who were present voted against the act. Using the powers of the Reichstag Fire Decree, the Nazis had detained several SPD deputies, and others had already fled into exile. The Communists had been banned and so could not vote. The rest of the Reichstag voted in favour. However, Nazi intimidation had worked so well that even if all 107 SPD deputies had been present and voted against it, the Enabling Act would have still passed with the required two-thirds majority for a constitutional amendment. The passage of the Enabling Act marked the end of parliamentary democracy in Germany and formed the legal authority for Hitler's dictatorship. Within weeks of the passage of the Enabling Act, the Hitler government banned the SPD, and the other German political parties chose to dissolve to avoid persecution, making the Nazi Party the only legal political party in Germany.  Exile and death  In June 1933, Wels went into exile in the Territory of the Saar Basin, which at the time was under League of Nations control. In August 1933, he was deprived of his citizenship. He then worked to build the expatriate SPD, first in Prague, then in Paris, where he died in 1939.

In its upper freshwater reaches, the river is known as the Deua River. Course and features The headwaters of the Deua River rise south of Braidwood and flow to the village of Kiora where the Deua River forms its confluence with the Moruya River. The Moruya River flows generally east, joined by two minor tributaries, past the town of Moruya, before reaching its mouth of the Tasman Sea at Moruya Heads. The river descends over its course. Barrier entrance The river has a bar at its confluence with the Tasman Sea. Work on the river training walls was concentrated in 1907, following extensive siltation of the river opening. The dredge Antleon was based there during the 1920s, when in 1924, the steamer Benandra was wrecked at the entrance. Work on the break walls was completed in 1925 when huge storms required some repairs to the training walls. The port gained greater significance in 1924 when a stone quarry was opened and used to supply granite for the pylons of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the stone for the Cenotaph in Martin Place. The Public Works Department built a wharf adjacent to the quarry fore ease of use. Extensions to the southern training walls were undertaken between 1931 and 1933, with major additional works from 1946-1954. The bar is dangerous to shipping and as a result of its hazards for smaller ships and because it prevented access by larger ones, the major settlement in the area was first developed at nearby Broulee. In 1841 a flood cleared the bar and the town of Moruya, now accessible to shipping, developed at the expense of the settlement at Broulee despite later recurring problems with the bar, not least as it was the easiest point to access the rich Araluen goldfields from the 1850s. The bar is now managed in part by a rock breakwall on the northern side of the river. History The river was previously navigable by coastal shipping to Moruya and was serviced by the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company. The Benandra, a wooden screw steamer operated by the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company to transport cargo, was lost on 25 March 1924 when it hit the sandspit near the bar. At least one person died. The Princes Highway crosses the Moruya River at Moruya. The first bridge across the Moruya River was erected in 1876. Due to frequent flooding new bridges were erected in 1900 and 1945 and, most recently, in 1966.

It is located on the Kings Highway linking Canberra with Batemans Bay. It is approximately 200 kilometres south west of Sydney, 60 kilometres inland from the coast, and fifty-five from Canberra. Braidwood is a service town for the surrounding district which is based on sheep and cattle grazing, and forestry operations.  History  European explorers reached the district in 1822 (Kearns, Marsh and Packer). The area was first settled by Europeans in the 1820s, and the town was surveyed in 1839. The village was located near the headwaters of the Shoalhaven River. The settlement was built with the labour of convicts, and many of the buildings they built around the region are still standing. Dr Wilson The town was named after Dr Thomas Braidwood Wilson. He had been a surgeon-superintendent of ships taking convicts to New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (now known as Tasmania). He was first granted land in Van Diemen's Land in 1824, which he exchanged for land near Lake George in 1825. In addition he was given 2560 acres (10 km²) which he selected in the 'new country' on two tributaries of the Shoalhaven, Monkittee and Flood creeks. In 1833, the western end of Wilson's grant was resumed and reserved for a future village and a similar area added to the eastern end in compensation. He eventually controlled a total of 12,305 acres in the area.Philip Cox & Wesley Stacey (1973), Historic towns of Australia, Melbourne, Lansdowne, p.92. He and his wife and children settled in the district in late 1836. He became a community leader and amongst other things contracted to build the first courthouse in 1837-38. In 1840 Wilson petitioned the government to build a road from Braidwood to Jervis Bay to enable faster and cheaper shipping of the wool clip to Sydney and, with Col. John Mackenzie, supplied the materials and labour for the Braidwood to Nerriga section. In 1841 Braidwood Farm had 141 residents. Wilson was sent bankrupt due to a drought in the late 1830s and the subsequent depression. He died in November 1843. His land was sold for £2,000 to John Coghill, who now owned all the land on the south, east and north of the town. Coghill built the historic house Bedervale. However, before his death, Wilson had purchased the block immediately to the north of Braidwood. He was buried on this block, high on the hill overlooking the town. A memorial and large pine tree mark the site of Wilson's grave, from which there are views of the town. The path to the grave is no longer open to the public. First Royal Commission Braidwood was the subject of Australia's first Royal Commission in 1867, inquiring into the activities of police officers and managers in the district, concerning the extent to which bushrangers had been shielded and assisted by police connivance and inactivity. The Commission identified several instances of misconduct and found the superintendent of police had failed to exercise 'strict and proper control over his men.'Report of the Commissioners, State of crime in the Braidwood District, 30 July 1867 Gold discovered Gold was discovered in 1851, and for the next two decades the district's population swelled to about 10,000. Supplies and produce to support the workforce on the gold fields came from as far afield as the Canberra region,Newman Chris (2004), Gold Creek, Reflections of Canberra's Rural Heritage, Gold Creek Homestead Working Group. (though Canberra itself would not be founded until 1913). This prosperity lasted for several years, during which some substantial commercial buildings including banks and hotels were constructed. Twentieth century Braidwood was formerly the seat of the Tallaganda local government area. However, following restructuring of local government areas by the New South Wales Government, it is now part of Queanbeyan-Palerang Regional Council. The local paper is now called the Braidwood Times. Through much of the 20th century, Braidwood was essentially in rural recession. Amongst other consequences, very little building work was carried out, and as a result the town entered the 21st century with much of its original streetscape and architecture intact. On 30 March 2006 the town and its setting were listed on the NSW State Heritage Register, following a period of unpleasant dispute between those wishing to preserve the town's charm and those wishing to develop it. Braidwood is located equidistant from Bungendore and Tarago railway stations, a distance of approximately 40 kilometres. NSW TrainLink operate multiple direct services from both railways stations to Canberra, Sydney, and provides connections across the state. Murray's coach services operate daily between Bateman's Bay and Canberra including picking up and setting down passengers in Braidwood.  Heritage listings  The Braidwood District Historical Society Museum Braidwood has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Braidwood and Its Setting * Monkitee Street: Bedervale * Wallace Street: Braidwood District Historical Society Museum * Wallace Street: Mill Complex * 119 Wallace Street: Albion Hotel Climate Braidwood has an oceanic climate (Cfb) with mild to warm summers and cold winters with frequent morning frost. Population At the , Braidwood had a population of 1,651. 78.5% of people were born in Australia and 87.2% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 32.4%, Catholic 24.0% and Anglican 20.5%.  Media  Braidwood is served by local newspaper, the Braidwood Times, which is owned by Australian Community Media. Braidwood is home to community radio station 2BRW. Operating under the name 'Braidwood Community Radio', the station can be heard on 88.9 FM. For commercial radio, Braidwood is in the Goulburn broadcast licence area with 2GN heard on 1368 AM and Eagle FM on 93.5 FM. These stations have studios in Goulburn. The town falls under the Southern NSW television licence area with stations transmitting from a tower on Mount Gillamatong, adjacent to the township. In popular culture Film and television The town has several times been used for film locations, including Robbery Under Arms (1920), Ned Kelly (1970), The Year My Voice Broke (1987), On our Selection (1995), Finding Joy (2003), The Discontinuity (2009) and Australia's Most Haunted (2013).

Its termini are both on business routes of Interstate 94 (I-94); the eastern one coincides with an intersection with I-69. Between Kalamazoo and Marshall it passes through Comstock, Galesburg, Augusta, and Battle Creek intersecting I-194/M-66 in Battle Creek and I-94 in Emmett Township. The highway now known as M-96 was originally part of M-17. Parts of M-17 that were not used for US Highway 12 (US 12) in 1926 were given the M-96 number. Additional segments of trunkline were added to M-96, one of which was an Alternate US 12 in the years afterwards. Later, US 12 was moved after the completion of I-94 in southern Michigan. Additional US 12 segments were added to M-96 at that time. The last major changes to M-96 rerouted the highway through the Battle Creek area in late 1998. Route description M-96 starts at an intersection between King Highway and Business Spur I-94 (BS I-94) east of downtown Kalamazoo. From this point, it follows King Highway over and then along the Kalamazoo River through a suburban residential area. The highway then follows Michigan Avenue east through Comstock and north of Morrow Lake. At Galesburg, M-96 turns northeast along Augusta Drive to Augusta, running through rural farmland. It turns eastward again, skirting the Fort Custer State Recreation Area and the Fort Custer National Cemetery. In Augusta, M-96 turns to follow Dickman Road to Battle Creek, passing north and east of the W. K. Kellogg Airport on Dickman and Helmer roads. On the north side of the airport, M-96 runs concurrently with both Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) and M-37. M-96 turns south on Helmer Road, separating from the other two trunklines, and then turns east crossing along Columbia Avenue. Here the highway runs along the edge of the city of Battle Creek through more residential areas and crosses the I-194/M-66 freeway next to the Riverside County Club. Near Brownlee Park, M-96 (Columbia Avenue) merges with BL I-94 (Michigan Avenue). Together BL I-94/M-96 continues along Michigan Avenue to I-94 where BL I-94 ends. M-96 passes the FireKeepers Casino Hotel, which is located just east of the ending of BL I-94, between 11 and 12 Mile Roads. M-96 continues along Michigan Avenue through farmland from Emmett to Marshall ending at an interchange with I-69/BL I-94. M-96 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-96 were the 22,953 vehicles daily between Capitol Avenue and I-194 in Battle Creek; the lowest counts were the 5,167 vehicles per day at the western terminus in Kalamazoo. The only section of M-96 that has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS), is in the Battle Creek area between the western BL I-94/M-37 junction and the I-94 interchange. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History M-96 was formed as a state trunkline in late 1926 from parts of M-17. The section of M-17 between Galesberg and Battle Creek was not utilized for US 12 and became M-96. In 1936, the Alternate US 12 trunkline was designated through the Battle Creek area along a section of highway that had previously been part of US 12. This highway was added to M-96 three years later in 1939. A rerouting of trunklines in 1941 lead to the creation of a Business US 12 (Bus. US 12). M-96 ran concurrently with Bus. US 12 and M-37 was truncated to end at M-96. US 12 was rerouted between Galesburg and Kalamazoo in 1954, and M-96 was extended along the former US 12 routing to end in Kalamazoo. M-96 was rerouted in downtown Battle Creek to one-way streets in 1958, and Bus. US 12/M-96 was extended by the end of the decade when the I-94/US 12 freeway was completed in the area. Bus. US 12 was redesignated as BL I-94 in 1960 and M-96 was shortened to end at BL I-94/M-78 running on Capital Avenue. M-37 was reextended in 1961 in Battle Creek to a concurrent routing with M-96 in 1961. M-89 was extended along the roadway used by M-96 west of Battle Creek to M-37 in 1965, truncating M-96 in the process. M-96 was reextended back to Battle Creek along Dickman Road and Fort Custer Highway from Augusta east in 1971. Several changes in Battle Creek were made to the area trunklines in 1998. M-96 was extended along BL I-94 (Dickman Road) to M-37 (Helmer Road) and along M-37 to Columbia Avenue. At Columbia, M-96 then turned west and M-37 turned east. M-96 rejoined BL I-94 along Michigan Avenue to I-94 and on to Marshall.

Location and features The Shoalhaven River rises on the eastern side of the Great Dividing Range, below Euranbene Mountain, about southwest of Sydney. The upper reaches of the river flow northwards through an upland pastoral district near the town of Braidwood. The river works its way down into a remote canyon east of Goulburn and emerges into the coastal lowlands at Nowra in the Shoalhaven district, where it is spanned by the historic Nowra Bridge. The river is joined by thirty-four tributaries, including the Mongarlowe, Corang, Endrick, and Kangaroo rivers, and descends over its course.  Berrys Canal  The estuary has two entrances, approximately apart, that flow into the Shoalhaven Bight within the Tasman Sea of the South Pacific Ocean. The southern entrance is located at Crookhaven Heads and is permanently open. The Shoalhaven River flows south via Berrys Canal to Greenwell Point, where it is joined by the Crookhaven River and then flows east past Orient Point into the bight, north of Culburra. The Berrys Canal between the Shoalhaven and the Crookhaven was constructed in June 1822 by convicts overseen by Hamilton Hume under the direction of Alexander Berry to facilitate ship transport to the original European settlement located in the region. The construction of the canal formed Comerong Island. The canal was dug using own hand tools, and was the first land navigable canal in Australia. Berrys Canal remains one of two navigable canals in New South Wales, the other being the Alexandra Canal. The northern entrance is located south of Shoalhaven Heads, and is open intermittently, at times of peak flow and during flood events.  Use for water supply  Tallowa Dam is the only major dam on the Shoalhaven, and is a part of the Shoalhaven Scheme. It impounds the river's lower reaches to form Lake Yarrunga and part of Sydney's water supply. Some water is pumped out of the lake and over the Southern Highlands into Lake Burragorang. Proposals for a much larger water storage at Welcome Reef on the upper Shoalhaven have been shelved.  Environment  The Shoalhaven River and its main tributary the Kangaroo River were once renowned as an Australian bass fishery. Unfortunately, Tallowa Dam has been a potent barrier to migratory native fish with estuarine/marine juvenile stages, blocking species including Australian bass from more than 80% of their former range in the Shoalhaven system. Recent stockings of hatchery-bred Bass in Lake Yarrunga are an attempt to remediate the situation. A fishway for Tallowa Dam was completed in August 2009. This fishway is designed to allow for the movement of bass and other native fish over the dam. Lake Yarrunga has also suffered the illegal introduction of highly damaging European carp, which are now present in high densities.  History  Indigenous history The traditional custodians of the land are Jerrinja tribal peoples the surrounding Shoalhaven River, in its lower reaches, are the Aboriginal peoples of the lower catchment are Jerrinja tribal peoples which are the traditional custodians of the Shoalhaven . Some of the culturally important Aboriginal places in the Shoalhaven include Coolangatta Mountain, Bundarwa (Beecroft Headland), Cambewarra Mountain, Didthul or Pigeon House Mountain, Kangaroo Valley, Burrill Lake, and Murramarang Aboriginal Area and its environs. European history The explorer and navigator George Bass found the entrance to the Shoalhaven River during his whaleboat voyage down the south coast of New South Wales in 1797. He gave the name Shoals Haven to the river (now known as the Crookhaven River) because of the shoals of mud and sand he found at the river mouth. Approximately west of Nowra are a series of properties along the banks of the Shoalhaven River that were a gift to the people of Australia from Arthur Boyd, his wife, Yvonne, and the Boyd Family. Entrusted to the Bundanon Trust, along with further gifts by Boyd, including copyright of all of his artwork, these properties provide an environment that promotes visual arts, writing, music and other performing arts, and the promotion of education and research in the arts.

It has a mature wave dominated, barrier estuary. From the middle reaches of its course, the state boundary between New South Wales and Queensland is located approximately north of the Tweed River. The river rises on the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range; with its watershed bordered by the McPherson, Burringbar, Condong and Tweed ranges and containing a catchment area of . The river flows generally north east, joined by eight tributaries including the Oxley and Rous rivers before reaching its mouth at its confluence with the Coral Sea of the South Pacific Ocean, south of Point Danger; descending over its course. On its journey, it passes through the major urban centres of Murwillumbah and Tweed Heads. The river's drainage basin consists mostly of the erosion caldera of the Tweed Volcano, a huge extinct volcano of which Mount Warning is the volcanic plug. The Tweed River area has a fine subtropical climate, high rainfall and fertile volcanic soils. It was originally covered by rainforest, much of which has been cleared. Some remains in several national parks and reserves. The lowlands along the river are used for farming sugar cane and other crops. The surrounding Tweed Shire is a local government area of New South Wales. Each year the river hosts a number of major aquatic events. The lower reaches of the Tweed River are a good recreational fishing site. Waterskiing, pleasure boating and rowing are other popular activities on the lower reaches of the river.

European discovery and naming The first European explorer to see the river was John Oxley, in 1823. As Surveyor General, Oxley made a close examination of the Tweed River and Port Curtis, and sources connected that investigation, principally the manuscript journal kept by Oxley, and the published Narrative of John Uniaeke, who accompanied Oxley. The following is an extract from Oxley's notebook entry for 31 October 1823: > Fri.31 October At 3[PM] made sail intending to anchor to the South of Point > Danger. At 5[PM] passed close to a Bold Headland [present-day Point Danger] > about 3 Miles North of Pt. D. [Cook's Point Danger - Fingal Head] On the > South Side of this headland we had the satisfaction to discover a > considerable river with an apparent clear entrance. Hove on for the purpose > of anchoring between the Island and the Main land [Fingal Head]. At ½ past 5 > passing too close to the Island we shoaled our \\"water to 2 ½ fms but almost > instantly deepened to 5 fms. Anchored under the lee of the Island in 7 fms > sandy Bottom being tolerably sheltered from the SSE round by the w to NE - > the distance between the Island and the Main is about 50 chains, the point > of the Main as well as the Island composed of regular Basaltic Pillars.

John Uniack made the following relevant observations. > Monday 27 October 1823: The wind being fair, we immediately got under way, > and continued our course to the northward till Friday afternoon, when it > shifted, and came on to blow so hard, that we determined to run in shore and > look out for anchorage; this we found under the lee of a small island off > Point Danger (so named by Captain Cook), about a mile from the land. While > running down for this place, we perceived the mouth of a large river about a > mile and a half to the northward; and next morning at daylight the master > was dispatched in the whale-boat to ascertain the possibility of taking the > vessel into it. Shortly afterwards, Mr. Stirling and I landed on the island > with our guns. The rocks which formed the base was evidently of volcanic > origin: it was of dark colour, full of small holes and extremely hard, while > on the western side many regular circular cavities, some of which were about > four or five yards in diameter at top, and tapered down gradually towards > the bottom, which was usually filled with round stones. > One of these holes, in particular, had a communication underneath with the > sea, and at every returning surf threw up considerable quantities of water > with a loud noise.

John Uniack also noted: > \\"The little island under which we lay received the name of Turtle Island, in > gratitude for the abundant supply of that fish which we procured from it.

The latitude of our anchorage is > 28° 8' S. and its longitude 153° 31'\\" Captain Phillip Parker King had previously surveyed that portion of the coast in the proximity of Point Danger, although adverse weather conditions prevented his examining that portion too closely. His observations, as recorded on 22 and 23 May 1819, are as follows: > 22\\\\. The next evening, Mount Warning was seen from the deck, although we > were at least seventy-eight miles from it. 23 On the 23d at noon, our > latitude was 28°9' when the Mount bore S 58° W (Magnetic). > At sunset the wind died away; and, from the land in the vicinity of the > mountain indicating every appearance of the existence of either a large > sheet of water or an opening of consequence, I was induced to remain two > days to examine the beach more narrowly; but, after beating about with a > strong south-easterly current which prevented my tracing the beach to the > northward of the Mount, and having only seen an inconsiderable opening that > communicates by a shoal channel with a small lagoon at the back of the > beach, I gave up the search; still without satisfying myself of the non- > existence of an inlet, which, if there be one, probably communicates with > the sea nearer to Point Danger. > Lieut Oxley has since (1823) discovered this to be the case, for he found a > stream empting itself into the sea, by a bar harbour close to Point Danger. > Lieutenant Oxley called it the Tweed. In the Appendix to the second volume of that work, containing a description of the ports, islands and coast between Port Jackson and Breakesea Spit, the following description of the Tweed River confirms that Captain King clearly considered Point Danger to be the southernmost of the two points: > The Tweed is a river communicating with the sea by a bar, on which there is > twelve feet of water, it is situated about a mile and a half to the north of > a small island off Point Danger, which lies in latitude 28° 8' Captain Henry Rous further examined the Tweed River in 1828, and incorrectly identified the present-day Point Danger, as the Point Danger of James Cook and recorded the name ‘Cook's Island’ rather than ‘Turtle Island’ of Oxley [Rous named Oxley's Tweed the Clarance River]: > The River Clarance, or more properly the Tweed, discovered by Mr. Oxley, but > not explored, is in lat. 28° 9', long. 153° 34' bearing N.W.½ W. from Turtle > Island distant 2 ½ miles – it is situated to the southward of a Bluff Head, > connected with the Main by a flat sandy Isthmus, 250 yards wide from high > water mark forming a boundary to the river on one side, and to capacious bay > to the northward – affording good anchorage and shelter from East Southerly > to North….There is a small river about 10 miles NW by W from the *north > bluff of Point Danger inaccessible for boats. The Tweed was named after the River Tweed in Scotland. Mouth stabilization The first training walls were built in 1891. In 1962, these walls were extended in order to maintain a deep channel. The order failed to stop the channel from shoaling and instead necessitated regular dredging and completely inhibited the longshore transport of sand northwards. The southern Gold Coast beaches were soon faced with intense erosion during storms which was not replenished. In 2001, a sand bypass system was implemented, in part based on the successful operation of the Gold Coast Seaway. The level of sand on southern Gold Coast beaches soon returned to pre-1960s levels. =Colloquial use= Even though parts of the river are a few kilometres within the New South Wales side of the border, the expression \\"North of the Tweed\\" is used to refer to the people and places of Queensland; likewise, \\"South of the Tweed\\" is a term used by Queenslanders regarding the southern states of Australia. The term probably originates from southern Australians' summer vacation trips driving along the Pacific Highway through the scenic New South Wales North Coast. The highway crosses many rivers along its route, with the Tweed being the last one before reaching the holiday destinations of the Gold Coast, just on the other side of the Queensland border. Course Upper Tweed Valley showing the caldera wall Duranbah The river begins northwest of the village called Lillian Rock. The upper reaches pass through the small villages of Kunghur, Terragon and Uki. South of Mount Warning, Doon Doon Creek and Perch Creek enter the Tweed from its southern banks, and Byrill Creek joins on the northern side near Terragon. Downstream, Korumbyn Creek and then the Oxley River enters the river at Byangum, before it flows through Murwillumbah. At Tumbulgum, the Rous River joins the Tweed. The Terranora and Cobaki creeks enter the Tweed about upstream from the mouth. South of Banora Point, the Pacific Highway crosses the river. The river's tidal influence reaches beyond Murwillumbah to Bray Park Weir. The estuary of the Tweed River is an important shorebird habitat. Flooding Flooding on the Tweed River.

Illustration of a 14th-century edition of the Decretals Papal primacy, also known as the primacy of the bishop of Rome, is a Christian ecclesiological doctrine concerning the respect and authority that is due to the pope from other bishops and their episcopal sees. English academic and Catholic priest Aidan Nichols wrote that \\"at root, only one issue of substance divides the Eastern Orthodox and the Catholic Churches, and that is the issue of the primacy.\\" The French Eastern Orthodox researcher Jean- Claude Larchet wrote that together with the Filioque controversy, differences in interpretation of this doctrine have been and remain the primary causes of schism between the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church. In the Eastern Orthodox Churches, some understand the primacy of the bishop of Rome to be merely one of greater honour, regarding him as ' (\\"first among equals\\"), without effective power over other churches. Other Orthodox Christian theologians, however, view primacy as authoritative power: the expression, manifestation and realization in one bishop of the power of all the bishops and of the unity of the Church. The Catholic Church attributes to the primacy of the pope \\"full, supreme, and universal power over the whole Church, a power which he can always exercise unhindered,\\" a power that it attributes also to the entire body of the bishops united with the pope. The power that it attributes to the pope's primatial authority has limitations that are official, legal, dogmatic, and practical. In the Ravenna Document, issued in 2007, representatives of the Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church jointly stated that both East and West accept the bishop of Rome's primacy at the universal level, but that differences of understanding exist about how the primacy is to be exercised and about its scriptural and theological foundations. Dogma within Latin and Eastern Catholic Churches The Catholic dogma of the primacy of the bishop of Rome is codified in both codes of canon law of the Catholic Church – the Latin Church's 1983 Code of Canon Law (1983 CIC) and the Eastern Catholic Churches' 1990 Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches (CCEO). The Second Vatican Council's 1964 dogmatic constitution Lumen gentium (LG) declared that the \\"pope's power of primacy\\" is by \\"virtue of his office, that is as Vicar of Christ and pastor of the whole Church,\\" and is \\"full, supreme and universal power over the Church\\" which he \\"is always free to exercise.\\" The primacy of the bishop of Rome, according to John Hardon in Catholic Dictionary, is \\"primacy of jurisdiction, which means the possession of full and supreme teaching, legislative, and sacerdotal powers in the Catholic Church\\"; it is authority \\"not only in faith and morals but Church discipline and in the government of the Church.\\" In canon 331, the \\"bishop of Roman Church\\" is both the \\"vicar of Christ\\" and \\"pastor of the universal Church on earth.\\" Knut Walf, in New commentary on the Code of Canon Law, notes that this description, \\"bishop of the Roman Church,\\" is only found in this canon, and the term Roman pontiff is generally used in . Ernest Caparros' et al. Code of Canon Law Annotated comments that this canon pertains to all individuals and groups of faithful within the Latin Church, of all rites and hierarchical ranks, \\"not only in matters of faith and morals but also in all that concerns the discipline and government of the Church throughout the whole world.\\" Heinrich Denzinger, Peter Hünermann, et al. Enchiridion symbolorum (DH) states that Christ did not form the Church as several distinct communities, but unified through full communion with the bishop of Rome and profession of the same faith with the bishop of Rome. The bishop of Rome is a subject of supreme authority over the sui iuris Eastern Catholic Churches. In canon 45, the bishop of Rome has \\"by virtue of his office\\" both \\"power over the entire Church\\" and \\"primacy of ordinary power over all the eparchies and groupings of them\\" within each of the Eastern Catholic Churches. Through the office \\"of the supreme pastor of the Church,\\" he is in communion with the other bishops and with the entire Church, and has the right to determines whether to exercise this authority either personally or collegially. This \\"primacy over the entire Church\\" includes primacy over Eastern Catholic patriarchs and eparchial bishops, over governance of institutes of consecrated life, and over judicial affairs. Primacy of the bishop of Rome was also codified in the 1917 Code of Canon Law (1917 CIC) canons 218–221. Development of the doctrine The Catholic Church bases its doctrine of papal primacy on the primacy among the apostles that Jesus gave to Peter in : and in :\\"Feed my lambs [...] Feed my sheep.\\" While acknowledging that \\"the New Testament contains no explicit record of a transmission of Peter's leadership; nor is the transmission of apostolic authority in general very clear,\\" it considers that its doctrine has a developmental history and that its teaching about matters such as the Trinity, the divinity of Christ, and the union of his two natures in a single person developed as the result of drawing out from the original revealed truth consequences that were not obvious at first: \\"Thanks to the assistance of the Holy Spirit, the understanding of both the realities and the words of the heritage of faith is able to grow in the life of the Church 'through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts'; it is in particular 'theological research [which] deepens knowledge of revealed truth'\\". Accordingly, it would be a mistake to expect to find the modern fully developed doctrine of papal primacy in the first centuries, thereby failing to recognize the Church's historical reality. The figure of the pope as leader of the worldwide church developed over time, as the figure of the bishop as leader of the local church seems to have appeared later than in the time of the apostles. That the Christian scriptures, which contain no cut-and-dried answers to questions such as whether or not there is forgiveness for post-baptismal sins, and whether or not infants should be baptized, gradually become clearer in the light of events, is a view expressed, when considering the doctrine of papal primacy, by Cardinal John Henry Newman, who summed up his thought by saying: Writers such as Nikolay Afanásiev and Alexander Schmemann have written that the phrase \\"presiding in agape\\", used of the Church of Rome in the letter that Ignatius of Antioch addressed to it in the early 2nd century, contains a definition of that Church's universal primacy; but the Catholic writer Klaus Schatz warns that it would be wrong to read, as statements of the developed Catholic teaching on papal primacy, this letter and the even earlier First Epistle of Clement (the name of Clement was added only later), in which the Church of Rome intervenes in matters of the Church of Corinth, admonishing it in authoritative tones, even speaking in the name of God. It was only later that the expression of Ignatius of Antioch could be interpreted as meaning, as agreed by representatives of both the Catholic and the Eastern Orthodox Churches, that \\"Rome, as the Church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St Ignatius of Antioch (To the Romans, Prologue), occupied the first place in the taxis, and that the bishop of Rome was therefore the protos among the patriarchs\\". The same agreement stated: Basis of claims to primacy =Peter and Paul= The evolution of earlier tradition established both Peter and Paul as the forefathers of the bishops of Rome, from whom they received their position as chief shepherd (Peter) and supreme authority on doctrine (Paul). To establish her primacy among the churches of the Western half of the empire, the bishops of Rome relied on a letter written in 416 by Innocent I to the Bishop of Gubbio, to show how subordination to Rome had been established. Since Peter was the only apostle (no mention of Paul) to have worked in the West, thus the only persons to have established churches in Italy, Spain, Gaul, Sicily, Africa, and the Western islands were bishops appointed by Peter or his successors. This being the case then, all congregations had to abide by the regulations set in Rome. Primacy of Peter the apostle Saint Peter portrayed as a Pope in the Nuremberg Chronicle Because of its association with the supposed position of Peter among the apostles, the function that, within the Catholic Church, is exercised by the Bishop of Rome among the bishops as a whole is referred to as the Petrine function, and is generally believed to be of divine institution, in the sense that the historical and sociological factors that influenced its development are seen as guided by the Holy Spirit. Not all Catholic theologians see a special providential providence as responsible for the result, but most see the papacy, regardless of its origin, as now essential to the Church's structure. The presence of Peter in Rome, not explicitly affirmed in, but consistent with, the New Testament, is explicitly affirmed by Clement of Rome, Ignatius of Antioch, Irenaeus of Lyon and other early Christian writers – and no other place has ever claimed to be the location of his death. The same witnesses imply that Peter was the virtual founder of the Church of Rome, though not its founder in the sense of initiating a Christian community there. They also speak of Peter as the one who initiated its episcopal succession, but speak of Linus as the first bishop of Rome after Peter, although some hold today that the Christians in Rome did not act a single united community under a single leader until the 2nd century. Role of Paul in the founding of the Church of Rome Irenaeus of Lyon (AD 189) wrote that Peter and Paul had founded the Church in Rome and had appointed Pope Linus to the office of the episcopate, the beginning of the succession of the Roman see. Although the introduction of Christianity was not due to them, \\"the arrival, ministries and especially the martyrdoms of Peter and Paul were the seminal events which really constituted the Church of Rome. It was from their time, and not before, that an orderly and meetly ordained succession of Bishops originated.\\" Historical development While the doctrine of the primacy of the Bishop of Rome, in the form in which it is upheld today in the Catholic Church, developed over the course of centuries, often in reaction to challenges made against exercises of authority by popes, writers both of East and West declare that from a very early period the Church of Rome was looked to as the centre of reference for the whole Church. Thus Schmemman wrote: In their The See of Peter (1927), non-Catholic academic historians James T. Shotwell and Louise Ropes Loomis, noted the following: Pope as arbiter Eastern Orthodox theologian Nicholas Afanassieff cites Irenaeus in Against Heresies 3:4:1 as illuminating that during the pre-Nicene period, the Church of Rome acted as arbiter in resolving disputes between local churches. Rome's support would ensure success, while refusal from Rome predetermined the attitude the other churches would adopt. In the aftermath of the Decian persecution, Pope Stephen I (254-257) was asked by Cyprian of Carthage (d. 258) to resolve a dispute among the bishops of Gaul as to whether those who had lapsed could be reconciled and readmitted to the Christian community. Cyprian stressed the Petrine primacy as well as the unity of the Church and the importance of being in communion with the bishops. For Cyprian, \\"the Bishop of Rome is the direct heir of Peter, whereas the others are heirs only indirectly\\", and he insisted that \\"the Church of Rome is the root and matrix of the Catholic Church\\". Cyprian wrote Pope Stephen asking him to instruct the bishops of Gaul to condemn Marcianus of Arles, (who refused to admit those who repented) and to elect another bishop in his stead.Mann, Horace. \\"Pope St. Stephen I.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 11 February 2020 It was to Pope Damasus I (366–384) that Jerome appealed in 376, to settle a dispute as to who, among three rival claimants, was the legitimate Patriarch of Antioch.\\"Letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus\\", 376, The Nicene Fathers (Schaff & Wace, ed.) T.&T.; Clark, Edinburgh In the strictest sense of the word, \\"decretal\\" means a papal rescript (rescriptum), an answer of the pope when he has been appealed to or his advice has been sought on a matter of discipline. The oldest preserved decretal is a letter of Pope Siricius in response to an inquiry from Himerius, Bishop of Tarragona, in which Siricius issued decisions on fifteen different points, on matters regarding baptism, penance, church discipline and the celibacy of the clergy.Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"Pope St. Siricius.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912 Quartodeciman controversy The Quartodeciman controversy arose because Christians in the Roman province of Asia (Western Anatolia) celebrated Easter at the spring full moon, like the Jewish Passover, while the churches in the West observed the practice of celebrating it on the following Sunday (\\"the day of the resurrection of our Saviour\\"). In 155, Anicetus, bishop of Rome, presided over a church council at Rome that was attended by a number of bishops including Polycarp, bishop of Smyrna. Although the council failed to reach agreement on the issue, ecclesiastical communion was preserved. A generation later, synods of bishops in Palestine, Pontus and Osrhoene in the east, and in Rome and Gaul in the west, unanimously declared that the celebration should be exclusively on Sunday. In 193, Victor, bishop of Rome, presided over a council at Rome and subsequently sent a letter about the matter to Polycrates of Ephesus and the churches of the Roman province of Asia. In the same year, Polycrates presided over a council at Ephesus attended by several bishops throughout that province, which rejected Victor's authority and kept the province's paschal tradition. Thereupon, Victor attempted to cut off Polycrates and the others who took this stance from the common unity, but later reversed his decision after bishops, that included Irenaeus of Lyon in Gaul, interceded and recommended that Victor adopt the more tolerant stance of his predecessor, Anicetus. This incident is cited by some Orthodox Christians as the first example of overreaching by the Bishop of Rome and resistance of such by Eastern churches. Laurent Cleenewerck suggests that this could be argued to be the first fissure between the Eastern and Western churches. According to James McCue, Victor's threatened excommunication was an \\"intradiocesan affair\\" between two local churches and did not pertain to the universal church.McCue, James. \\"The Roman Primacy in the Second Century and the Problem of the Development of Dogma\\", Theological Studies 2 (1964): 161-96 First Council of Nicaea The First Council of Nicaea was convened by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 325. Canon IV states: \\"A bishop is to be chosen by all the bishops of the province, or at least by three, the rest giving by letter their assent; but this choice must be confirmed by the Metropolitan.\\"The Seven Ecumenical Councils of the Undivided Church, (Henry R. Percival, ed.), Vol XIV of Nicene and Post Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, (ed. Philip Schaff and Henry Wace), (repr. Edinburgh: T&T; Clark; Grand Rapids MI: Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1988) Karl Josef von Hefele says that this was probably in response to Melitius of Lycopolis, who \\"had nominated bishops without the concurrence of the other bishops of the province, and without the approval of the metropolitan of Alexandria, and had thus occasioned a schism. This canon was intended to prevent the recurrence of such abuses.\\" First Council of Constantinople and its context Early manuscript illustration of the First Council of Constantinople The event that is often considered to have been the first conflict between Rome and Constantinople was triggered by the elevation of the see of Constantinople to a position of honour, second only to Rome on the grounds that, as capital of the eastern Roman empire, it was now the \\"New Rome\\". This was promulgated in the First Council of Constantinople (381) canon 3 which decreed: \\"The Bishop of Constantinople, however, shall have the prerogative of honour after the Bishop of Rome because Constantinople is New Rome.\\" Thomas Shahan says that, according to Photius, Pope Damasus approved the council of Constantinople, but he adds that, if any part of the council were approved by this pope, it could have been only its revision of the Nicene Creed, as was the case also when Gregory the Great recognized it as one of the four general councils, but only in its dogmatic utterances. The increasing involvement of Eastern emperors in church matters and the advancement of the see of Constantinople over the sees of Antioch, Alexandria and Jerusalem led successive bishops of Rome to attempt a sharper definition of their ecclesial position vis-a-vis the other bishops. The first documented use of the description of Saint Peter as first bishop of Rome, rather than as the apostle who commissioned its first bishop, dates from 354, and the phrase \\"the Apostolic See\\", which refers to the same apostle, began to be used exclusively of the see of Rome, a usage found also in the Acts of the Council of Chalcedon. From the time of Pope Damasus, the text of (\\"You are Peter and on this rock I will build my church\\") is used to support Roman primacy. Pope Innocent I (401–417) claimed that all major cases should be reserved to the see of Rome and wrote: \\"All must preserve that which Peter the prince of the apostles delivered to the church at Rome and which it has watched over until now, and nothing may be added or introduced that lacks this authority or that derives its pattern from somewhere else.\\" Pope Boniface I (418–422) stated that the church of Rome stood to the churches throughout the world \\"as the head to the members\\", a statement that was repeated by the delegates of Pope Leo I to the Council of Chalcedon in 451. =Relationship with bishops of other cities= Besides Rome, Jerusalem was also held in high prestige in the early Church, both because the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus occurred there, on account of the 1st-century Council of Jerusalem. Followers of Jesus were first referred to as \\"Christians\\" (as well as \\"Catholic\\") in Antioch and was, together with Alexandria, important in the thought of the early Church. It is important to note, however, that the three main apostolic sees of the early Church (i.e. the See of Antioch, the See of Alexandria, and the See of Rome) were directly related to Peter. Prior to becoming Bishop of Rome, Peter was Bishop of Antioch. Additionally, his disciple Mark founded the church in Alexandria. =Leo I= The doctrine of the ' (apostolic see) asserts that every bishop of Rome, as Peter's successor, possesses the full authority granted to this position and that this power is inviolable on the grounds that it was established by God himself and so not bound to any individual. In line with the norm of Roman law that a person's legal rights and duties passed to his heir, Pope Leo I (440–461) taught that he, as Peter's representative, succeeded to the power and authority of Peter, and he implied that it was through Peter that the other apostles received from Christ strength and stability. Leo argued that the apostle Peter continued to speak to the Christian community through his successors as bishop of Rome. Pope Gelasius I (492–496) stated: \\"The see of blessed Peter the Apostle has the right to unbind what has been bound by sentences of any pontiffs whatever, in that it has the right to judge the whole church. Neither is it lawful for anyone to judge its judgment, seeing that canons have willed that it might be appealed to from any part of the world, but that no one may be allowed to appeal from it.\\" The historical and juridical development of the \\"primacy of the Roman Pontiff\\" from Pope Gregory I (590–604) to Pope Clement V (1305–1314) was a doctrinal evolution in fidelity of the ' (deposit of faith). =Council of Reims= In 1049, the Council of Reims, called by Pope Leo IX, adopted a dogmatic declaration about the primacy of the Roman Pontiff as the successor of Peter: \\"\\" (literal translation is \\"it was declared that only the bishop/pontiff of the see of Rome is the primate of the universal Church and apostolic\\"). East-West Schism The dispute about the authority of Roman bishops reached a climax in the year 1054, when the legate of Pope Leo IX excommunicated Patriarch of Constantinople Michael I Cerularius. Leo IX had, however, died before the legate issued this excommunication, depriving the legate of its authority and thereby rendering the excommunication technically invalid. Similarly, a ceremony of excommunication of Leo IX then performed by Michael I was equally invalid, since one cannot be posthumously excommunicated. This event led to the schism of the Greek-rite and Latin-rite Churches. In itself, it did not have the effect of excommunicating the adherents of the respective Churches, as the tit-for-tat excommunications, even had they been valid, would have applied to the named persons only. At the time of the excommunications, many contemporary historians, including Byzantine chroniclers, did not consider the event significant. Post-schism period = Second Council of Lyon (1272–1274) = On 31 March 1272, Pope Gregory X convoked the Second Council of Lyon to act on a pledge by Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos to reunite the Eastern church with the West. Wishing to end the East-West Schism that divided Rome and Constantinople, Gregory X had sent an embassy to Michael VIII, who had reconquered Constantinople, putting an end to the remnants of the Latin Empire in the East. On 29 June 1274 (the Feast of Peter and Paul, the patronal feast of popes), Gregory X celebrated Mass in St John's Church where both sides took part. The council declared that the Roman church possessed \\"the supreme and full primacy and authority over the universal Catholic Church.\\" The council was seemingly a success, but did not provide a lasting solution to the schism. Michael's death in December 1282 put an end to the union of Lyon. His son and successor Andronikos II Palaiologos repudiated the union. = Reformation = The primacy of the Pope was again challenged in 1517 when Martin Luther began preaching against several practices in the Catholic Church, including some itinerant friars' abuses involving indulgences. When Pope Leo X refused to support Luther's position, Luther claimed belief in an \\"invisible church\\" and called the pope the Antichrist. Luther's rejection of the primacy of the Pope led to the start of the Protestant Reformation, during which numerous Protestant sects broke away from the Catholic Church. The Church of England also broke away from the Catholic Church at this time, although for reasons different from Martin Luther and the Protestants. = First Vatican Council = The doctrine of papal primacy was further developed in 1870 at the First Vatican Council, where ultramontanism achieved victory over conciliarism with the pronouncement of papal infallibility (the ability of the pope to define dogmas free from error ex cathedra) and of papal supremacy, i.e., supreme, full, immediate, and universal ordinary jurisdiction of the pope. The First Vatican Council's dogmatic constitution Pastor aeternus declared that \\"in the disposition of God the Roman church holds the preeminence of ordinary power over all the other churches.\\" This council also affirmed the dogma of papal infallibility, deciding that the \\"infallibility\\" of the Christian community extended to the pope himself, at least when speaking on matters of faith. Vatican I defined a twofold Primacy of Peter — one in papal teaching on faith and morals (the charism of infallibility), and the other a primacy of jurisdiction involving government and discipline of the Church — submission to both being necessary to Catholic faith and salvation. Vatican I rejected the ideas that papal decrees have \\"no force or value unless confirmed by an order of the secular power\\" and that the pope's decisions can be appealed to an ecumenical council \\"as to an authority higher than the Roman Pontiff.\\" Paul Collins argues that \\"(the doctrine of papal primacy as formulated by the First Vatican Council) has led to the exercise of untrammelled papal power and has become a major stumbling block in ecumenical relationships with the Orthodox (who consider the definition to be heresy) and Protestants.\\" Forced to break off prematurely by secular political developments in 1870, Vatican I left behind it a somewhat unbalanced ecclesiology. \\"In theology the question of papal primacy was so much in the foreground that the Church appeared essentially as a centrally directed institution which one was dogged in defending but which only encountered one externally\\", according to Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (the later Pope Benedict XVI). Eastern Orthodox view The Eastern Orthodox church considers the Bishop of Rome to be the '. Many theologians also believe that Peter is the rock referred to by Jesus in . However, in the keys were given not only to Peter but to all the Apostles equally. Such an interpretation, it is claimed, has been accepted by many Church Fathers; Tertullian, Hilary of Poitiers, John Chrysostom, Augustine. It has been argued that Church councils did not consider papal decisions binding. The Third Ecumenical Council was called, even though Pope Celestine I condemned Nestorius as a heretic which Michael Whelton, Catholic convert to Orthodoxy, argues shows that the council did not consider the papal condemnation as definitive. Catholic Cardinal and theologian Yves Congar stated 21st century relations with other Christian denominations In the document Responses to some questions regarding certain aspects of the doctrine on the Church of 29 June 2007 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith reiterated that, in the view of the Catholic Church, the Christian communities born out of the Protestant Reformation and which lack apostolic succession in the sacrament of orders are not \\"Churches\\" in the proper sense. The Eastern Christian Churches that are not in communion with Rome, such as the Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy and the Assyrian Church of the East, are Churches in the proper sense and sister Churches of the Catholic particular Churches, but since communion with the Pope is one of the internal constitutive principles of a particular Church, they lack something in their condition, while on the other hand the existing division means that the fullness of universality that is proper to the Church governed by the successor of St Peter and the bishops in communion with him is not now realised in history. =Efforts at reconciliation= Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission The Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC) statement of Venice (1976) states that the ministry of the bishop of Rome among his brother bishops was \\"interpreted\\" as Christ's will for his Church; its importance was compared \\"by analogy\\" to the position of Peter among the apostles. Joint worship service with the Archbishop of Canterbury At a joint service during the first official visit of the then Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie, to the Vatican, Runcie appealed to Anglicans to consider accepting papal primacy in a reunified church. At the same time, Pope John Paul II stressed that his office must be more than a figurehead. Ut unum sint John Paul II invited, in Ut Unum Sint, his 1995 encyclical on commitment to ecumenism, the \\"pastors and theologians\\" of Churches and Ecclesial Communities not in full communion with the Catholic Church to suggest how to exercise papal primacy in ways that would unite rather than divide. Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue In October 2007, the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church, agreed that the pope has primacy among all bishops of the Church, something which has been universally acknowledged by both churches since the First Council of Constantinople in 381 (when they were still one Church) though disagreements about the extent of his authority still continue. The document \\"draws an analogy among the three levels of communion: local, regional, and universal, each of which appropriately has a 'first' with the role of fostering communion, in order to ground the rationale of why the universal level must also have a primacy. It articulates the principle that primacy and conciliarity are interdependent and mutually necessary.\\" Speaking of \\"fraternal relations between bishops\\" during the first millennium, it states that \\"these relations, among the bishops themselves, between the bishops and their respective protoi (firsts), and also among the protoi themselves in the canonical order (taxis) witnessed by the ancient Church, nourished and consolidated ecclesial communion.\\" It notes that both sides agree \\"that Rome, as the church that 'presides in love' according to the phrase of St Ignatius of Antioch, occupied the first place in the taxis (order) and that the bishop of Rome was, therefore, the protos (first) among the patriarchs. They disagree, however, on the interpretation of the historical evidence from this era regarding the prerogatives of the bishop of Rome as protos, a matter that was already understood in different ways in the first millennium\\"; and \\"while the fact of primacy at the universal level is accepted by both East and West, there are differences of understanding with regard to the manner in which it is to be exercised, and also with regard to its scriptural and theological foundations\\". Discussions continued at Aghios Nikolaos, Crete, (a drafting committee) in September–October 2008; at Paphos, Cyprus, in October 2009; and Vienna, Austria in September 2010. Hegumen Filipp Ryabykh, the deputy head of the Russian Orthodox Church Department for External Church Relations said A 2008 draft text on \\"The Role of the Bishop of Rome in the Communion of the Church in the First Millennium\\" topic prepared by the Joint International Commission for Theological Dialogue Between the Catholic Church and the Orthodox Church was leaked in 2010, which the Vienna meeting asked to be revised and amplified. This document states that \\"Catholics and Orthodox agree that, from apostolic times, the Church of Rome has been recognised as the first among the local Churches, both in the East and in the West.\\" Both sides agree that \\"the primacy of the see precedes the primacy of its bishops and is the source of the latter\\". While in the West, \\"the position of the bishop of Rome among the bishops was understood in terms of the position of Peter among the apostles ... the East tended rather to understand each bishop as the successor of all the apostles, including Peter\\"; but these rather different understandings \\"co-existed for several centuries until the end of the first millennium, without causing a break of communion\\". Opposition to the doctrine American religious author Stephen K. Ray, a Baptist convert to Catholicism, asserts that \\"There is little in the history of the Church that has been more heatedly contested than the primacy of Peter and the See of Rome. History is replete with examples of authority spurned, and the history of the Church is no different.\\" The doctrines of papal primacy and papal supremacy are perhaps the greatest obstacles to ecumenical efforts between the Catholic Church and the other Christian churches. Most Eastern Orthodox Christians, for example, would be quite willing to accord the Bishop of Rome the same respect, deference and authority as is accorded to any Eastern Orthodox patriarch, but resist granting him special authority over all Christians. Many Protestants are quite willing to grant the pope a position of special moral leadership, but feel that according any more formal authority to the pope than that would conflict with the Protestant principle of solus Christus, i.e., that there can be no intermediaries between a Christian and God except for Christ. Protestant view The topic of the Papacy and its authority is among the main differences between the Catholic Church and many other Christian denominations. For those who hold to the doctrine of sola scriptura, the Bible is considered to be the sole authority on Christian doctrine and theology. It is said that Matthew 16:18–19 does not support the authority given to Peter and that the keys were given not to Peter alone but to the whole church. Some consider that Jesus was considering the proclamation made by Peter to be the rock and foundation of the faith. Others say that, even if Peter is the \\"rock\\", it does not support exclusive authority, and Peter himself believed Jesus to be the cornerstone of the church (). It is said that at the Council of Jerusalem James the Just and the Apostle Peter contribute to the decision of the council (). Opposition arguments from Church Councils *Not one Ecumenical Council was called by a pope; all were called by Byzantine emperors. The Church Fathers' writings and the Ecumenical Councils never speak of any papal election. \\"Documents of the early church were never dated by a pope, and certainly the early Fathers never had to submit their private interpretations to the imprimatur of the Vatican.\\"Peter J.

In late 2006, Elektron claimed that \\"100 became 200\\", and the prices were raised once again. This marks the third time that an additional 100 chips were being produced, each time claiming to be the \\"final run\\". This (and the fact that some aftermarket clones of original SID chips exist) has raised skepticism as to how scarce the supply actually is, and which run is actually the final run. However, since January 18, 2007 no new SidStations have been shipped. As SidStations are manufactured, the company keeps the price in relation to the demand, meaning that the initial SidStations were fairly cheap and later on, when the device was more sought-after, the price increased. The appearance of the SidStation is retro and features a small LCD-display where the sound editing is done, four assignable knobs, a keypad and a controller wheel. Different models of SidStations Besides the standard grey model of SidStation, two other models exist. The beta models of SidStations used by Elektron and their beta testers had a shining red color. Around twelve red units were made and approximately half of them were sold to early customers and beta-test partners. Some of these partners sold their units at a later time giving a handful of metallic red SidStations being owned by private people. Besides the color, these beta machines had a slightly more aggressive character due to some voltages running higher in the filter section, as well as certain beta-testing modes and the ability to upgrade the firmware to a greater extent. Elektron also sold fifty black SidStation units, which had black aluminum casing and blue LEDs, contrary to the original green ones, called the Ninja Edition. This model also came with a different set of sound patches. There is also a blue SidStation that was made as a one off, by Elektron, for a walk in customer that just happened to see the blue shell sitting unused on the shelf . Sound of the SidStation The sound of SidStation is, of course, very similar to that of the original Commodore 64. The SID chip is well known for being noisy. By design, the oscillators never stop outputting signal—even while not in use. It's this flaw, however, that is part of the character and sound of the SID chip. Most SidStations contain the 6581 R4AR incarnation of the SID chip. This version is considered the best trade-off between sound, stability and conformity (which is a big deal concerning the SID chip, since they tend to sound different from unit to unit). The SidStation is capable of producing all the waveforms of the C64, Triangle, Saw, Pulse, Mix (which is a mix between Saw and Pulse) and variable Noise. Besides this is the synth, a 4-part LFO-modulation system which can be used with Lowpass, Highpass, Bandpass and various combinations of these filters (including a Notchfilter). All of these are controllable by the four knobs on top of the SidStation.

It lies on the north bank of the River Clyde, adjacent to Uddingston and Hamilton, east-south-east of Glasgow city centre. Description and history An ancient settlement which was once primarily a mining village, and earlier the site of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679, Bothwell is an affluent commuter town that has attracted a number of local celebrities including a number of professional footballers. Thanks to a steady rise in property prices, Bothwell has a reputation as one of Glasgow's most prosperous satellites. In 2019, \\"Earls Gate\\" which overlooks Bothwell Castle was named Greater Glasgow's most expensive street, with an average price tag of £1,125,000.Where is Scotland's most expensive street?, Property Reporter, 31 December 2018 Bothwell Parish Church The houses surrounding the Main Street are of older sandstone Victorian style whereas the newer part of the Bothwell consists of estates built in close proximity to Bothwell Castle and intertwined with Bothwell Castle Golf club. The new houses have significantly increased the population. As of 2008 the population of Bothwell was estimated at 3,000, with the local council ward in combination with Uddingston established a year earlier. The majority of Bothwell's residents own their own property, and annual incomes are well above average. The average house costs £556,250. Facilities Until 1955 Bothwell had a station on the North British Railway. These are the remains in 1961 Bothwell has two primary schools (the rebuilt Bothwell PS and St Bride's RC PS),Bothwell Primary School, South Lanarkshire CouncilSt Bride's Primary School (Bothwell), South Lanarkshire Council a library and a bowling club. There are several small shops and businesses in the town's Main Street, along with a handful of pubs and restaurants. The Bothwell area has many walkways, nature trails, woodlands and greenery. A footbridge links with Blantyre on the opposite bank of the river, and leads directly to the David Livingstone Centre. The parish church (which was restored at the end of the 19th century) contains the choir of the old Gothic church of 1398. A memorial honours the poet Joanna Baillie (1762-1851) who was born in the manse. Bothwell Castle Bothwell Castle The picturesque ruin of Bothwell Castle occupies a position on a bluff above a bend in the River Clyde on the edge of Bothwell, which here takes the bold sweep famed in Scottish song as the Bothwell bank. This fortress belonged to Sir Andrew de Moray, who was fatally wounded at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297. It passed by marriage to the House of Douglas. The lordship was bestowed in 1487 on Patrick Hepburn, 3rd Lord Hailes, 1st Earl of Bothwell. When he resigned in 1491 the title passed to \\"Bell-the-Cat\\", Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus. The title ultimately passed to the Earls of Home. The castle is a fine example of Gothic architecture. It consists of a great quadrangle with circular towers on the south. At the east end stand the remains of the chapel. An unpretentious mansion was built nearby by Archibald Douglas, 1st Earl of Forfar (1653-1712), and was known as New Bothwell Castle, but suffered mining subsidence and was demolished in 1926. The castle can be accessed through scenic Clyde Walkways. Brighter Bothwell Brighter Bothwell is a local environmental group, formed in 2000 for the benefit of the whole community of Bothwell. Their objective is to enhance the environment directly through the endeavours of volunteers. Since the formation of the group, many public areas have been improved and some major projects have been undertaken including the Nature Trail, The Jubilee Garden and The Marion Gilchrist Garden. In the Beautiful Scotland campaign, the group has raised the village to Silver Gilt award standard and, in 2012, Bothwell won the prize as winner of the Small Town category. Brighter Bothwell has also encouraged the formation of two additional community groups, The Organic Growers of Bothwell and The Bothwell Scarecrow Festival. Working along with Brighter Bothwell, these groups are having a positive impact on the community. Scarecrow Festival A Jaguar E-Type at the Bothwell Festival of Transport, as part of the Bothwell Scarecrow Festival In the autumn of 2010, inspired by a number of festivals already held in villages across the UK, Brighter Bothwell developed The Bothwell Community Scarecrow Festival to extend and develop the feeling of community in Bothwell and to support the local economy. The first festival took place in September 2011, and subsequently every year after. A Bentley Continental GT featured at the Bothwell Festival of Transport, as part of the Bothwell Scarecrow Festival The festival has become very popular and the main street is filled with imaginative scarecrows from August onwards. Many local businesses make their own scarecrows, as do the local children whose gardens are also filed with scarecrows at the time of year. Yorkhill Children's foundation is the beneficiary of the event. During the 2013 festival, a new event was held at Bothwell Primary School called 'The Scarecrow Festival of Transport'. It was intended to be a celebration of transport throughout the ages. Various people from the village donated their automobiles for the event, such as Boyd Tunnock of the local company Tunnock's, and Bentley Glasgow. Sports Speedway Speedway racing was staged in the Bothwell Castle estate area in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The track was constructed on old railway land by club members who used it as a training track. Occasional team matches saw the Bothwell Bulls take on other training venues such as Newtongrange and High Beech. Tommy Miller, who rose to fame with Glasgow Tigers in 1950, and Ken McKinlay, arguably the best ever Scottish speedway rider, both started out at Bothwell. The venture, safety fence and all, moved to Chapelhall. Golf Club Bothwell Castle Golf Club was officially opened on the 16th of June 1923 by the Earl of Home (father of Prime Minister Sir Alec Douglas-Home). The course covered a 110-acre site situated between the 13th century castle and the then small village of Bothwell. In 1960 the club were unable to accept an offer to buy the course, which was purchased by a developer. By 1962, building proposals were in place resulting in the club losing 7 holes for housing, and having to develop new ground to replace these holes. This new section of the course opened in 1973. The club finally purchased the course in 1976 for £70,000, thereby securing its long-term future. The entrance to Bothwell Castle Golf Club, located on Bothwell Road. In 2002, a fire resulted in the complete destruction of the clubhouse. The club decided to build the replacement clubhouse in a new location closer to the centre of the course. Officially opened in October 2004 by Richard Cole- Hamilton CBE, the Captain of the R&A; Golf Club of St Andrews. In 1997, Lady Member Sheila Beckett produced a book on the history of the Club to commemorate its 75th anniversary. A flat, 18-hole parkland course, Bothwell is challenging for players at all levels. The building of the new clubhouse has allowed the club to revise the course layout, with several new tee positions and some new greens.

He is also a respected artist, with works in several galleries. Life Gurruwiwi was born at the mission station on Wirriku Island (also known as Jirgarri), one of the smaller islands in the Wessel Islands group. He has also self-reported being born on Milingimbi Island (also known as Yurruwi, in the Crocodile Islands), with both of these island groups being off Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, Australia. His date of birth is uncertain (the missionaries recorded his and two brothers as having the same birthdate – officially 1 January 1930), estimated 1940. He was given the European name \\"Willie\\" at some point, \\"Wulumbuyku\\" was another Aboriginal name, and his skin name was Wamut. His father was Monyu Gurruwiwi and his mother Djikulu Yunupingu. He is a member of the Gälpu clan, of the Dangu language group of the Yolngu peoples. He grew up living a traditional life in the remote area, hunting turtles with his father on a lipalipa (dug-out canoe), and with little contact with \\"balanda\\" (white people). He remembers Japanese bombers dropping bombs on his homeland during World War II, and later working alongside Japanese pearlers. The family, along with others in the clan, spent long periods on the remote island of Rrakala. They travelled across the chain of Wessel Islands from Nhulunbuy in dug-out canoes, using carved wooden paddles. As a young man Gurruwiwi lived on Galiwinku (Elcho Island), working as a lumberjack, cutting large trees by hand. He was also given the responsibility for carrying out punishment for tribal law, becoming both respected and feared. After a period when he succumbed to the destructive effects of alcohol after it was introduced to the remote areas, he says he was visited by a spirit in gaol one night and \\"found Jesus\\". He gave up drinking and devoted his life to the yiḏaki and spiritual and other studies. In 1994 he completed studies in Christian theology at Nungalinya College in Darwin, and became a respected Yolŋu lawman and as well as a Christian leader. Gurruwiwi and his family, along with some other members of the Galpu clan, live at Birritjimi (also known as Wallaby Beach) on the Gove Peninsula They live in homes constructed in the 1970s to provide accommodation for Rio Tinto mining executives, handed over to traditional owners represented by Rirratjingu Aboriginal Corporation in 2008. The houses are in very poor condition and are facing demolition, as they are no longer deemed safe. The Northern Territory Government is providing emergency repairs, but says that the Northern Land Council is responsible for the maintenance of the homes. Rirratjingu has applied for funds to help move the residents to Nhulunbuy, Gunyangara and Yirrkala, but Djalu and his son Larry are reluctant to leave Birritjimi. Family Gurruwiwi's wife is a sister of Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu, and they have several sons. Larry (Larry Larrtjaŋga Gurruwiwi) and Andrew Gäyalaŋa Gurruwiwi led the Bärra West Wind band, with Jason Guwanbal Gurruwiwi, Vernon Marritŋu Gurruwiwi, Dion Marimunuk Gurruwiwi, and Adrian Guyundu Gurruwiwi also listed as members of the band in 2010. The band and Larry are featured in the 2017 film Westwind: Djalu’s Legacy. Larry, Jason and Vernon, in their new band, Malawurr, performed in Melbourne in June 2019 to help raise funds for the new film, Morning Star (see below) ahead of their first European tour, playing at WOMAD in the UK and other festivals in England and France. The band is also scheduled to give a yiḏaki workshop and performance at the Rainbow Serpent Festival at Lexton, Victoria on 26 January 2020. Larry is the future spiritual keeper of the yiḏaki and custodian of the Yolngu songlines and healing techniques passed down by his father. Music, culture and law Gurruwiwi spent much time over several decades crafting his instruments and refining his technique. He sold his pieces to the local community arts centre, and various non-Indigenous workers and visitors. Gurruwiwi is a senior member of his clan, having learned to play and make the yiḏaki from his father, Monyu, an important leader and warrior. Monyu gave Djalu the role of primary custodian of the yiḏaki for his clan, which is significant also for the wider Yolŋu communities, because other Arnhem Land clans see the Gälpu clan as one of the primary custodians of the instrument. However, there are many other Yolŋu people with the same role within their own clan, and their own particular type of yiḏaki. Upon the death of his father, Djalu assumed the role of the elder responsible for passing on the skills as well as the cultural importance of the instrument. He became known among his people as the senior player and maker of the yiḏaki after attending many ceremonies with his brothers, who were singers, and also became fully informed in Yolŋu law. Much of the knowledge and cultural practice that he acquired is held sacred, so Gurruwiwi is held in high esteem. In 1986, his reputation as craftsman was given a world stage when several of his friends and relatives formed the musical group Yothu Yindi, and commissioned Gurruwiwi to make their yiḏakis. Yothu Yindi has both Yolŋu and balanda members and spanned cultural boundaries, going on to win several ARIA awards and international fame. Gurruwiwi's source of spiritual power has been linked to Wititj, the huge ancestral rainbow serpent. In the clan legends, the Wititj was said create thunder and lightning as it moved across the land, but is also associated with the calm freshwater systems where the spirits reside, among water lilies and palm trees. The yiḏaki sometimes also contain these qualities: some have powerful acoustics, called baywarayiḏaki, (the power of lightning and thunder); others are Djuŋgarriny, long and deep-sounding, with a gentle, soothing sound, but also powerful: the vibrations are said to stir Wititj. Art Guruwiwi's art includes printmaking and earth pigments on stringybark (also known as bark paintings). He is also a painter of sacred miny'tji and a maker of sacred raŋga, objects rarely seen by outsiders. Gurruwiwi is a respected artist, with his bark paintings on eucalyptus bark being acquired by numerous important institutions, including the National Gallery of Victoria, the Art Gallery of South Australia, the South Australian Museum, the Kluge- Ruhe Aboriginal Art Collection of the University of Virginia and many private collections. His work has been included in numerous exhibitions since 1990. Some of his themes, styles and types of work include: *Mandji-dak body painting *Clan miny’tji (designs of saltwater and freshwater areas) *Wititj (olive python) *Dhonyin (Javan file snake) *Bol’ngu (\\"the Thunderman\\") Tours and performances Gurruwiwi delivered the first Yiḏaki Masterclass at the inaugural Garma Festival of Traditional Cultures (held at Gulkula, a significant Gumatj ceremonial site about from the township of Nhulunbuy) in 1999, and has delivered all subsequent Yiḏaki Masterclasses at the Festival since. He has attended numerous other festivals and events both in Australia and abroad, including: * 2002 Rripangu Yiḏaki Festival, Eisenbach, Germany * 2003 Joshua Tree Festival, USA * 2003 Indigenous Peoples Commission cultural visit, Taipei, Taiwan * 2004 Dubai Sister Cities Forum, United Arab Emirates * 2005 Yiḏaki Festa 2005, Okuhida & Tokyo, Japan * 2005 Played for Nelson Mandela in Sydney * 2007 Mulu Music Festival, Mooloolaba, Australia At the 2015 edition of Womadelaide, he participated in an \\"Artists in Conversation\\" session as well as a performance that included Gotye and the Bärra (West Wind) musicians in Adelaide, South Australia. Awards Guruwiwi won the 2015 National Indigenous Music Award in the Traditional Song of the Year category, with East Journey, for Mokuy & Bonba.

It was directed by British filmmaker Ben Strunin, and also features Djalu's son Larry Gurruwiwi and multi-instrumentalist singer-songwriter Gotye. Initially titled Baywara (Yolngu for \\"lightning power\\", which features as a theme), the story tells of Gurruwiwi's need to pass on the sacred knowledge of the yidaki and its songlines, and Larry's initial reluctance to take on the role. The film's title echoes that of Larry's band, Bärra West Wind (Bärra being the Galpu name of the West Wind songline). The film played to full houses at the 2018 Melbourne International Film Festival. Other Gurruwiwi has also featured in other films: *2000 Yidaki. Directed by Michael Butler, narrated by Jack Thompson, produced by Michelle White for Discovery Channel *2014 In Between Songs. Written, directed, produced and co-edited by Joshua Bell and narrated by James Cromwell. In 2006, Bell spent six months in Nhulunbuy with Gurruwiwi, his wife, his sister, and various family members who came and went; they also travelled to the remote island of Rrakala, where Gurruwiwi and his family lived for long stretches when he was a child. He also features in numerous YouTube videos, which attract tens of thousands of views. Morning Star The maker of Westwind: Djalu's Legacy, Ben Strunin, was invited by Djalu and Larry Gurruwiwi to make a sequel to Westwind, which is in the process of crowdfunding the film. It follows the brothers' band, Malawurr, on tour through England, Czech Republic, Wales and France in 2019. The film will also include Larry's participation in groundbreaking medical research, \\"to quantify the effects of the traditional vibrational sound healing that he was taught by Djalu\\".

Education Fowler was born at Roydon, Essex, on 17 January 1889 to Howard Fowler, from Burnham, Somerset, and Frances Eva, daughter of George Dewhurst, a cotton merchant from Manchester. He was initially educated at home, going on to attend Evans' preparatory school at Horris Hill and Winchester College. He won a scholarship to Trinity College, Cambridge and studied mathematics, becoming a wrangler in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos. War service In World War I he obtained a commission in the Royal Marine Artillery and was seriously wounded in his shoulder in the Gallipoli Campaign. The wound enabled his friend Archibald Hill to use his talents properly. As Hill's second in command he worked on anti-aircraft ballistics in the Experimental Department of HMS Excellent on Whale Island. He made a major contribution on the aerodynamics of spinning shells. He was awarded the OBE in 1918. Academic career In 1919, Fowler returned to Trinity and was appointed college lecturer in mathematics in 1920. Here he worked on thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, bringing a new approach to physical chemistry. With Arthur Milne, a comrade during the war, he wrote a seminal work on stellar spectra, temperatures, and pressures. In 1925 he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. He became research supervisor to Paul Dirac and, in 1926, worked with him on the statistical mechanics of white dwarf stars. In 1928 he published (with Lothar Nordheim) a seminal paper that explained the physical phenomenon now known as field electron emission, and helped to establish the validity of modern electron band theory. In 1931, he was the first to formulate and label the zeroth law of thermodynamics.Y. Cengel, M. Boles, Thermodynamics - An Engineering Approach 5th ed. In 1932 he was elected to the Chair of Theoretical Physics at the Cavendish Laboratory. In 1939, when World War II began, he resumed his work with the Ordnance Board, despite poor health, and was chosen for scientific liaison with Canada and the United States. He knew America well, having visiting professorships at Princeton and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. For this liaison work he was knighted in 1942 (see MAUD Committee). He returned to Britain later in the war and worked for the Ordnance Board and the Admiralty up until a few weeks before his death in 1944. Fifteen Fellows of the Royal Society and three Nobel Laureates (Chandrasekhar, Dirac, and Mott) were supervised by Fowler between 1922 and 1939. In addition to Milne, he worked with Sir Arthur Eddington, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Paul Dirac and Sir William McCrea. It was Fowler who introduced Dirac to quantum theory in 1923. Fowler also put Dirac and Werner Heisenberg in touch with each other through Niels Bohr. At Cambridge he supervised the doctoral studies of 64 students, including John Lennard-Jones, Paul Dirac and Garrett Birkhoff. The Fowler Islands, in Crystal Sound, on the Antarctic Peninsula were named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in his honour. Personal life Fowler was a keen amateur cricketer who played as a wicket-keeper. He played for Norfolk in the Minor Counties Championship in 1908 and 1909. In 1921 he married Eileen Mary (1901–1930), the only daughter of Ernest Rutherford. They had four children, two daughters and two sons. Eileen died after the birth of their last child.

Now at Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, it is the oldest working steam engine and the oldest working engine in the world. History Originally, it was one of two steam engines used to pump water back up to the summit level of the BCN Old Main Line (Birmingham Canal) canal at Smethwick, not far from the Soho Foundry where it was made. The other engine, also built by Boulton and Watt, was at the other end of the summit level at Spon Lane. In 1804 a second Boulton and Watt engine was added alongside the 1779 engine. The engines were needed because local water sources were insufficient to supply water to operate the six locks either side of the canal's original summit. The locks could have been avoided if a tunnel had been built, but the ground was too unstable for James Brindley to build a tunnel using the techniques available at the time. In the 1780s, a cutting was constructed by John Smeaton, enabling three of the six locks on each side to be removed. The Engine Arm Aqueduct In the 1820s, Thomas Telford constructed a new canal parallel to the old in a deeper cutting, at the Birmingham Level, creating the largest man-made earthworks in the world at the time. It was spanned by the Galton Bridge. The engine was still needed, despite both these developments, and Thomas Telford constructed the Engine Arm Aqueduct carrying the Engine Arm branch canal over his New Main Line so that coal could still be transported along the arm to feed the Smethwick Engine. New Smethwick Pumping Station In 1892, a replacement engine was built in a new pumping house, now Grade II listed, next to Brasshouse Lane, as the original Smethwick Engine was considered uneconomic to repair; the latter was removed for preservation in 1897-98 to the BCN, later British Waterways, Ocker Hill depot where it remained until acquired by Birmingham City Council. It is now part of the collection of Birmingham Museums and is on display at Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum at Millennium Point. It is the oldest working engine in the world. Blue plaque at the site of the Smethwick Engine The engine house was demolished in 1897. Its original site and foundations can still be seen on Bridge Street North in Smethwick, just north of the junction with Rolfe Street. Tours of the site can be arranged through the Galton Valley Canal Heritage Centre which is based in the New Smethwick Pumping Station and regularly opened by Sandwell Museum Service and The Friends of Galton Valley. The pumping station was featured in an episode of The Water Boatman presented by Alan Herd on the Discovery Shed TV channel in November 2011.

A Jewish businessman and leading member of the Nuremberg Jewish community, Lehmann (Leo) Katzenberger, was accused of having an affair with a young \\"Aryan\\" woman, and on 14 March 1942 was sentenced to death. The presiding judge at the trial, Oswald Rothaug, was later tried at the Nuremberg trials (see Judges' Trial) and sentenced to life imprisonment.

He had a long-standing friendship with a young photographer, Irene Seiler (née Scheffler), who rented rooms in an apartment house the Katzenbergers owned and which was situated next to the firm's offices. Local gossips had for years claimed that Seiler and Katzenberger were having an affair. Trial Someone denounced Katzenberger to the authorities and he was arrested on 18 March 1941 under the so-called Rassenschutzgesetz, or Racial Protection Law, one of the Nuremberg Laws, which made it a criminal offence as Rassenschande (\\"racial defilement\\") which prohibited Aryans from having sexual relations with Jews. Leo Katzenberger consistently denied the charges, as did Irene Seiler, who claimed the relationship between them was that of a father and daughter. The investigating judge initially concluded there was too little evidence to proceed with the case. The investigation had however attracted the attention of Oswald Rothaug, a judge known for his severity and fervent support for Nazism, who arranged for the case to be brought to him. He recognised the publicity such a trial would generate and saw it as a way to display his Nazi credentials and further his career. He sent out tickets for the trial to all the prominent Nazis in Nuremberg. No conclusive evidence was presented during the trial that Katzenberger and Seiler had ever had an affair (Seiler had been Katzenberger's tenant since 1932), let alone that it had continued up until and during the war. The law at the time did not call for the death sentence for breaking the Rassenschutzgesetz. The normal sentence would have been a term of imprisonment of several years. However, the Volkschädlingsgesetz, a wartime law, allowed capital punishment if one made use of wartime regulations such as the blackout to commit a crime. Based on a single eyewitness account that Katzenberger had been seen leaving the Seiler apartment \\"when it was already dark\\", Rothaug applied this law to pass a death sentence against Katzenberger. Aftermath Leo Katzenberger was guillotined at Stadelheim Prison in Munich on 2 June 1942. Irene Seiler was found guilty of perjury for denying an affair had taken place and sentenced to two years' imprisonment—in accordance with Hitler's wishes, women were not charged under the Racial Protection Law, but could be charged with perjury or obstruction of justice. Even among some Nazi officials, the tenuous grounds on which Katzenberger had been sentenced to death caused disquiet. Oswald Rothaug was moved to a state attorney's job in Berlin in 1943 because the Justice Minister, Otto Georg Thierack, considered him unfit to be a judge. In 1947 he was placed on trial by the Americans, partly for his role in the Katzenberger trial, and sentenced to life imprisonment. He was released in December 1956, aged 59, and died in Cologne in 1967.

It is 12 kilometres north of Muswellbrook on the New England Highway. History In 1828 Thomas Potter McQueen was granted 10,000 acres, and named the small township after George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen. In 1837 Segenhoe Inn was built, which Potter McQueen named after Segenhoe Manor, in Bedfordshire, where he was born in 1791.http://upperhunter.nsw.gov.au/f.ashx/documents/6013-HistoryofAberdeen.pdf Aberdeen Post Office opened on 1 August 1856. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 1,894 people in Aberdeen. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 6.7% of the population. * 86.7% of people were born in Australia and 90.4% of people only spoke English at home. * The most common responses for religion were Anglican 34.3%, Catholic 28.2% and No Religion 17.9%. Today Aberdeen has its own pre-school, which was founded in 1977. The town contains two schools: the Aberdeen Public School, catering from kindergarten to Grade 6; and St. Joseph's High School, a Catholic co-educational high school catering for Grades 7 through to 12. Aberdeen has two churches – St Thomas's Catholic Church, and St Mark's Anglican Church. It once had a third church, St Paul's Uniting Church, which has now been turned into an art gallery called the Artemis Gallery. Next to St Thomas's Catholic Church is located St Joseph's Aberdeen High School.St Joseph's Aberdeen School Website The town has a local rugby league team, the Aberdeen Tigers. Aberdeen is on the Main North railway line, and is serviced by a daily XPLorer long-distance service in each direction between Sydney and Armidale, as well as two/three local services in each direction between Scone and Newcastle. For travellers, there are two main areas for accommodation in the town: the Aberdeen Motel, which is on the southern edge of the town; and the Segenhoe Inn, which is situated towards the northern end of town. The Commercial Hotel is also available for budget accommodation. Abattoirs Aberdeen is possibly best known for the former abattoirs in the town centre, which operated for well over 100 years, before the most recent owners - an American company called Conagra - decided to close down their New South Wales abattoirs and concentrate on their Queensland operations. One factor in closing down what was once a very important abattoir for Conagra, was that the financial cost of upgrading the Aberdeen Abattoir was deemed too high, thus the abattoir - which was the largest single employer in Aberdeen - was closed in 1999. Hundreds of people were left without work, and despite promises from both the New South Wales and Federal governments to encourage new businesses to open up in the area, nothing of note eventuated.

Van Maanen, born into a well-to-do family in Friesland, studied astronomy at the University of Utrecht (earning his Ph.D. in 1911) and worked briefly at the University of Groningen. In 1911, he came to the United States to work as a volunteer in an unpaid capacity at Yerkes Observatory. Within a year he got a position at the Mount Wilson Observatory, where he remained active until his death in 1946. He discovered Van Maanen's star. He is well known for his astrometric measurements of internal motions in spiral nebulae. Believing that nebulae were local, stellar and gaseous systems that existed in our galaxy, his measurements came to be at odds with Edwin Hubble's discovery that the Andromeda Nebula and other spiral nebulae were extragalactic objects. The speed of rotation he calculated for the nebulae, if Hubble were correct as to their extragalactic nature, would have had their Cepheid stars moving at speeds faster than that of light. In 1935, it was decided that since Hubble's calculations of extragalactic Cepheid distances were correct, ergo van Maanen's astrometric measurements had to be incorrect. In 1924 he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Known for faulty results In the first and second decade of the 20th century there was a large controversy in the astronomical world about the size of the Milky Way, the size of the universe and the nature of spiral galaxies. The result of this controversy was the great debate in Washington DC between Harlow Shapley and Heber Doust Curtis in April 1920. Shapley believed that spiral galaxies weren't systems equal to the Milky Way and in one of his arguments he used the results of Van Maanen, who measured the rotation of the spiral arms of spiral galaxies. After extrapolating his results he concluded that motion of the arms of spiral galaxies had a period of 105 years. While Curtis had stated that spiral galaxies were similar to the Milky Way and thus had to have a similar size, believed to be 5 kiloparsecs (kpc) at that time, the period of the motion was far too small for a radius of 2.5 kpc. At that period and radius, it would mean that the spiral arms rotated with a speed greater than the speed of light. Curtis agreed that if the results of van Maanen were correct, Shapley was right. But Curtis rejected the results of van Maanen due to unrealistic accuracy claimed by him. Later astronomers have re-examined the measurements of Van Maanen, and concluded he had made a serious error. The origin of van Maanen's measurement errors emerged from his stereo blink comparator, which van Maanen used to compare new plates with plates some 10–20 years old. By blinking between those two plates he could detect small discrepancies on the positions of the objects. His reference objects were the field stars fairly near the edge of the plates. However he didn't consider that due to optical effects these stars had been smeared out a little towards the edges, slightly differently between the two plates. This caused systematic errors resulting in imaginary movements. Another possible explanation is that van Maanen simply saw what he had been trained to see for years: that the \\"spiral nebulae\\" were relatively nearby and therefore ought to have a quite detectable rotation. A belief that was quite widespread in the early 20th- century and therefore very hard to ignore. This does not, however, explain supposedly corroborating findings from Mount Wilson, Lowell Observatory, Russia, and the Netherlands.Marcia Bartusiak, The Day We Found the Universe (2009) [Vintage Books, page 162] References ;Notes ;Further reading *  External links  *Angular Rotations of Spiral Nebulae, Hubble, E., ApJ, 81, 334 (1935) – NADS *Internal Motions in Spiral Nebulae, Van Maanen, A., ApJ, 81, 336 (1935) – NADS *Adriaan van Maanen and internal motions in spiral nebulae: A historical review, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 13, 1972 *Adriaan van Maanen on the significance of Internal Motions in Spiral Nebulae, Hetherington, N.S., J Hist Astron, 5. 52 (1974) – NADS *On Spiral Nebulae, van Maanen et al.

They are drawn from Spider-Man's list of enemies. The original incarnation of the group was organized by Doctor Octopus and consisted of Vulture, Electro, Mysterio, Sandman and Kraven the Hunter. While the team has had different members in its various iterations over the years, Doctor Octopus generally remained the leader across all versions. Since their introduction in comics, the Sinister Six have made appearances in various other forms of media, including animated series and video games. Publication history The Sinister Six first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1 (January 1964). Fictional team biography Original Sinister Six After suffering two defeats from Spider-Man,The Amazing Spider-Man #3 and 11-12 Doctor Octopus is separated from his tentacle pack. After his tentacle pack breaks free and helps Doctor Octopus get out of prison, he contacts every known supervillain who had crossed paths with Spider-Man. Only Electro, Kraven the Hunter, the original Mysterio, the Sandman, and the original Vulture respond. As none of the members are willing to relinquish the honor of killing Spider-Man themselves, they decide to challenge Spider-Man individually with the order in which they face him determined by a random drawing. The Sinister Six kidnap Aunt May and Daily Bugle secretary Betty Brant, holding them hostage in order to force Spider-Man to confront them. Spider-Man defeats the Sinister Six members one-by-one, mocking their decision to battle him individually instead of as a team in front of Doctor Octopus, the last one to be defeated.The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1 \\"The Return of the Sinister Six\\" In The Amazing Spider-Man #334–339, Doctor Octopus recruits Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, and Vulture, along with the demonic Hobgoblin (since Kraven the Hunter had died) as part of his plan to take over the world. However, this was a trick, part of a larger plan by which Doc Ock alone would be the master of the world, by releasing a chemical into the atmosphere that would cause pain in anyone who attempted to use cocaine; he would then sell his cure for the chemical to the rich and powerful. Sandman, who at this point in his career had reformed and was blackmailed into joining, aids Spider-Man in defeating the Sinister Six, and ultimately stopping Doc Ock's plans to conquer the world. Because Octopus' chemical is eating away the ozone layer, Spider-Man has no choice but to release the cure into the atmosphere. \\"Revenge of the Sinister Six\\" In Spider-Man #18-23, Electro, Mysterio, Vulture, and Hobgoblin reunite in a bid to take revenge on Doctor Octopus. To trick Sandman into joining them, they hit his foster family with a bomb, leading him to believe Doctor Octopus attacked them as punishment for betraying him. Sandman contacts Spider-Man and asks him to shadow the group as insurance against him being double-crossed. Doctor Octopus easily defeats the other members of the six with his newly reacquired adamantium arms, then zaps Sandman with a weapon that transforms his body into glass and beats Spider-Man nearly to death. When police surround the building, the other members of the Sinister Six agree to serve Doctor Octopus in exchange for his helping them escape. The assembled Sinister Six go off on a rampage, stealing advanced weapons and technology from several sources, including an alien dimension and a facility specializing in cybernetics. To again complete their quorum of six, they recruit Gog. Eventually, Spider-Man and several other heroes (including the Ghost Rider, Deathlok, Nova, the Hulk, and Solo) confront the villains as they are seizing a HYDRA base to gain access to deadly, world-devastating weapons. Most of the members are again incarcerated, but Vulture and Hobgoblin escape. Sinister Seven A variation known as the Sinister Seven is formed by Hobgoblin to fight Kaine after he killed Doctor Octopus and the Grim Hunter (a son of Kraven the Hunter). Hobgoblin's Sinister Seven includes the Beetle, Electro, Mysterio, Scorpion, the Shocker, and the Vulture. They finally find Kaine and a battle erupts. Spider-Man saves Kaine from being executed; the two then work together and defeat the Sinister Seven. Sandman's Sinister Six Eventually, the Sandman (who had been turned back into a villain by his former ally the Wizard)Peter Parker, Spider-Man (vol. 2) #12 and the second Mysterio (the original had committed suicide following his fight with Daredevil) form a new version of the Sinister Six, with Venom temporarily replacing Doctor Octopus and the other members consisting of Electro, the second Kraven the Hunter (another son of the dead original), and the Vulture. Sandman uses the Sinister Six in order to get revenge on Doctor Octopus for turning him into glass in \\"The Return of the Sinister Six\\" storyline. The Sinister Six are defeated again and Venom subsequently attacks the various members of the group. He nearly kills the Sandman and badly injures Electro and Kraven the Hunter before he and his symbiote are briefly separated from each other by the mysterious Senator Ward. Sinister Twelve The Sinister Twelve In Marvel Knights Spider-Man, Norman Osborn is unmasked to the public as the Green Goblin and imprisoned. Osborn contacts a group of supervillains who also bear grudges against Spider-Man, all of whom had been financed by Osborn's fortunes for years. Eager to retaliate, the villains agree to band together, and the Sinister Twelve is formed. Mac Gargan is the de facto leader of the Twelve while Osborn is in prison, and he kidnaps Peter Parker's Aunt May and threatens to kill her if Spider-Man does not help Osborn escape from jail. Spider-Man, with help from Black Cat, breaks Osborn out only to be confronted by the Vulture, the Sandman, Electro, the Chameleon, the Lizard, Hydro-Man, the Shocker, Hammerhead, Boomerang and Tombstone. Osborn, now in the guise of the Goblin, introduces them as the Sinister Twelve. Spider-Man and Black Cat are rescued by Captain America, Iron Man, Daredevil, Yellowjacket and the Fantastic Four. Furious, Goblin rockets away and kidnaps Mary Jane Watson and Spider-Man pursues him. Spider-Man and the Goblin clash upon a bridge (not the one where Gwen Stacy was killed). Finally, Osborn gives a vital clue as to Aunt May's whereabouts before being knocked into the river below. In the aftermath, Aunt May is found and saved. The rest of the Sinister Twelve are subdued by the other heroes and arrested. Civil War's Sinister Six A new version of the Sinister Six apparently bands together during the Civil War storyline. The line-up consists of Doctor Octopus, Grim Reaper, Lizard, Shocker, Trapster and Vulture. They are stopped by Captain America and his Secret Avengers off-panel and discovered bound and subdued by S.H.I.E.L.D.Civil War #2 \\"Big Time\\" Sinister Six Following the events of the \\"Origin of the Species\\" storyline which involves Doctor Octopus assembling Spider-Man's enemies into targeting Harry Osborn's baby (who Doctor Octopus thought had some of Norman Osborn's DNA), only the Chameleon, Electro, Mysterio, the Rhino, and the Sandman remain with Doctor Octopus to reform the Sinister Six when the baby does not inherit Norman Osborn's DNA. Their first plot involves sending Micro-Octobots to blow up an Air Force base. This is prevented by Spider-Man, the Avengers, and the Fantastic Four.The Amazing Spider-Man #648 Spider-Man and the Future Foundation stumble on a plot on a Caribbean Island by the Sinister Six which involves the use of a zombie pirate crew.The Amazing Spider-Man #659 During the fight with the Sinister Six, Spider-Man realizes that the Doctor Octopus, Electro, Rhino and Sandman that they are fighting are robots, while Mysterio and the Chameleon are the only real ones present. Meanwhile, the real Doctor Octopus infiltrates the Baxter Building to look for specific technology plans.The Amazing Spider-Man #660 While the adult Avengers are dealing with the eruption of Mount Etna, Tigra and the Avengers Academy students learn that Electro has broken into a French laboratory. Once on the scene, the students discover that Electro is accompanied by the rest of the Sinister Six. The Sinister Six overpower the students and Doctor Octopus steals a device containing self-sustaining power.Avengers Academy #14 Doctor Octopus and the Sinister Six later fight the Intelligencia where the Chameleon had infiltrated the group disguised as Klaw. After the Intelligencia members are defeated, the Sinister Six steal their Zero Cannon (a weapon which changes Earth's gravity field to send specific objects into space). Doctor Octopus later appears in a robot suit which would help to keep him alive.The Amazing Spider-Man #676 Doctor Octopus and Mysterio coordinate the Octobots that have infiltrated the Apogee 1 Space Station and taken over some of the crew members. When Mysterio notices that some of the Octobots were disabled, Doctor Octopus orders the Octobots to finish their mission and then destroy the space station.The Amazing Spider-Man #680 When Spider-Man arrives on the Apogee 1 Space Station, Doctor Octopus pushes a button that starts to move the Apogee 1 Space Station close to Earth. After Apogee 1 Space Station is destroyed and the crew is evacuated by Spider-Man, the Human Torch and John Jameson, Doctor Octopus tells the rest of the Sinister Six that his master plan is about to begin.The Amazing Spider-Man #681 =Ends of the Earth= In the \\"Ends of the Earth\\" storyline, all of Doctor Octopus' preparations come to fruition in a plan to conquer the world. Doctor Octopus activates a giant antenna array called the Octahedral which, in turn, activates Earth-orbiting satellites he calls the Octavian Lens. The Lens works to speed up the greenhouse effect, which in turn heats up the Earth. Upon hacking into televisions around the world, Doctor Octopus describes what his satellites are doing, and shuts them down. He says he can save the world \\"at a price\\".The Amazing Spider-Man #682 At Palazzo Senatorio, an international gathering of world leaders and the planet's greatest minds meet to discuss Doctor Octopus's supposed offer to save the world. The Avengers crash the assembly and Spider-Man captures the Chameleon, who is at the meeting disguised as, of all people...Vice President Al Gore. Spider-Man lets the Chameleon go, but he secretly places a Spider-Tracer on him, which allows Spider-Man and the Avengers to follow the Chameleon to the Mediterranean Coast where the rest of the Sinister Six is waiting. The Six subdue the Avengers, leaving only Spider-Man standing. Spider-Man is taken down when trying to gain control of Doctor Octopus's tentacles with his helmet.The Amazing Spider-Man #683 The Sinister Six then leave the area, and Doctor Octopus issues his demands: control of 200 missile facilities (for use in his plan), as well as 2 billion dollars for each of the members of the Sinister Six. In response, Spider-Man contacts Horizon Labs for help. Doctor Octopus sends the Sandman to guard one of the missile facilities in the Sahara Desert. After Spider-Man, the Black Widow, and Silver Sable enter the facility and defeat the Sandman, Doctor Octopus contacts the U.N. once again and orders them to kill Spider-Man in retaliation.The Amazing Spider-Man #684 In a subsequent missile facility raid, Spider-Man and his allies manage to defeat the Rhino, but they are unable to capture him because they are attacked by S.H.I.E.L.D (under orders from the U.N., via Doctor Octopus's demands). Forced to flee, Spider-Man and his allies then attempt to rally support from Earth's other heroes after the Titanium Man alerts them to the fact that Doctor Octopus has been recruiting other villains. Tracking down a final facility, Spider-Man learns that Doctor Octopus has already launched all of his satellites.The Amazing Spider-Man #685 However, this is revealed to be a deception created by Mysterio and the Chameleon. Spider-Man defeats the Chameleon when he attempts to attack them in a \\"Doc-Ock\\" suit of armor. Spider-Man and his allies then convince Mysterio to help them track down Doctor Octopus's base. While they find the base, they also find themselves pitted against the 'new' Sinister Six—in the form of the mind-controlled Avengers.The Amazing Spider-Man #686 Despite Doctor Octopus's confidence, the heroes prevail against their mind-controlled teammates; the Black Widow and Hawkeye are knocked out by Iron Man while he is still under Doctor Octopus's control. Spider-Man's new training, combined with Captain America subconsciously holding back, allows Spider-Man and Silver Sable to defeat Spider-Woman and Captain America, respectively. Finally, Mysterio uses an EMP generator to negate the Octobots controlling Thor, Iron Man and the Red Hulk. Now \\"Octobot\\" free, these remaining three Avengers set out to take out Doctor Octopus's missiles, while Spider-Man and Silver Sable confront Doctor Octopus in his base. The two are first met by the Rhino, who decides to drown himself and take Sable with him in an attempt to psychologically beat Spider- Man into submission, but Spider-Man musters his strength, manages to destroy Doctor Octopus's arms and equipment and ultimately hauls his foe away to a doctor.The Amazing Spider-Man #687 Marvel NOW!'s Sinister Six As part of the Marvel NOW! event, the Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus's mind in Peter Parker's body) encounters a new Sinister Six consisting of Boomerang, Overdrive, the Shocker, the Speed Demon, the Living Brain and the female Beetle that previously fought Captain America and the Black Widow. The group of villains attacks Horizon Labs, but the Superior Spider-Man defeats them, using a power-dampening field to disable their equipment. He is preparing to kill Boomerang when the still-living consciousness of Peter Parker stops him. Otto gives the villains to the NYPD and EMTs upon their arrival.The Superior Spider-Man #1, March 2013 This version of the Sinister Six (minus the Living Brain) appears in its own series Superior Foes of Spider-Man. The Sinister Six later assaulted the Owl's base. Overdrive and the Speed Demon were captured by the Owl and interrogated. The Beetle tried to blackmail the Owl into releasing them, while covertly dialing for back-up. Unimpressed, the Owl got ready to execute her when reinforcements arrived in the form of Tombstone (who was revealed to be the Beetle's father).Superior Foes of Spider-Man #6 At one point to steal valuables from the Chameleon, including a portrait of Doctor Doom, the Sinister Six allied with the Owl, where they expand the group into a \\"Sinister Sixteen\\". Besides Boomerang, the Beetle, Overdrive, the Owl, and the Speed Demon, the group consists of the Armadillo, the Bi-Beast, the Clown, the Cyclone, the Human Fly, the Kangaroo, Man Mountain Marko, the Mirage, Scorcher, Shriek, the Spot and the Squid. The team eventually broke up after Boomerang had thoroughly screwed everyone over, including himself.The Superior Foes of Spider-Man 17 =Superior Six= Following the deletion of Peter Parker's memories and acquiring the Raft as his new base which he renamed Spider-Island II, the Superior Spider-Man begins to collect former Sinister Six members and store them in his underwater lab with the implied intention to create a new team as the Superior Spider-Man. First, he acquired the sand grain that contained the Sandman's consciousness.Avenging Spider-Man #17 When Electro returned to Earth after being hurled into space by Thor, the Superior Spider-Man enlisted Thor to help defeat Electro.Avenging Spider-Man #18 The Superior Spider-Man then confiscated the Chameleon from S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.Avenging Spider-Man #20-21 The Superior Spider-Man came across Mysterion (a villain that is dressed like Mysterio) robbing the bank. Upon defeating Mysterion, the Superior Spider-Man discovered that the villain he thought was Mysterio was not Quentin Beck, but an unnamed man who bought the Mysterio gear from the Hobgoblin.Avenging Spider-Man #22 Finally, the Superior Spider-Man went up against the Vulture, who seeks to get even with the Superior Spider-Man for beating him up twice. The Superior Spider-Man managed to defeat the Vulture.Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #1 The Superior Spider-Man debuts with mind-controlled members as the supposedly-reformed \\"Superior Six\\" at the time when Lightmaster invades Alchemax to obtain an invention that would work in sync with his own light powers. The Superior Six ended up fighting the Wrecking Crew (who were hired by Lightmaster to assist him).Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #5 Due to the second Sun Girl's widespread attack, the Superior Spider-Man lost control of the Superior Six and they attacked him.Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #6 The Superior Spider-Man and Sun Girl had to team up to defeat them.Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #7 =Sinister Sixty-Six= Mojo and the Chameleon abduct Spider-Man and his X-Men students and force them to star in a show which pits them against the Sinister Sixty- Six. The group, which is not seen in its entirety, consists of holographic stand-ins of various enemies of Spider-Man like the Beetle, Carnage, the Demogoblin, Doctor Octopus, the Duster, Electro, the Gibbon, the Green Goblin, the Grizzly, Hammerhead, the Hobgoblin, the Jackal, Jack O'Lantern, the Kingpin, Kraven the Hunter, the Lizard, Morbius the Living Vampire, Mysterio, the Puma, the Rhino, the Ringer, the Sandman, the Scorpion, the Shocker, Tombstone, Shriek, Vermin and the Vulture.Spider-Man and the X-Men #3 =Swarm's Sinister Six= Spider-Man and the students of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning encounter the eighth incarnation of the Sinister Six led by Swarm and consisting of the third 8-Ball, Delilah, Killer Shrike, the third Melter and the Squid. After Hellion defeated Swarm, the other members of the Sinister Six surrendered.Spider-Man and the X-Men #4 Iron Spider's Sinister Six Purchasing a recolored and modified version of the Iron Spider armor, Miles Morales' uncle Aaron Davis forms his incarnation of the Sinister Six consisting of Bombshell, the Francine Frye version of Electro, the Roderick Kingsley version of the Hobgoblin, the Sandman, and the Spot. Their first mission was to steal a decommissioned S.H.I.E.L.D.

However, this group is unrelated to the more established lineup of criminals. It includes Cloak and Dagger, Sonique, Sauron, Blob and Phoenix. Avataars: Covenant of the Shield On the planet Earth created by the Shaper of Worlds, the Sinister Six are known as the Six Most Sinister, a group of criminals operating a tollbooth in the Webwood who are led by the Goblin King and consist of Huntsman, Jolt, Mysterium, Sandstorm, Talon, and Tentaclus. When the Champions of the Realm attempt to pass through the Webwoods, they are attacked by the Six Most Sinister, who they easily deal with and leave defeated as they move on. Marvel Zombies A zombified version of the Sinister Six appears in Marvel Zombies: Dead Days. They are seen attacking innocent civilians upon the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, but are repelled by Wolverine and Magneto. These infected members each include Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, Vulture, Sandman, Electro and Mysterio. Marvel Zombies Return In the Marvel Zombies series, the Sinister Six appear in an alternative universe that Zombie Spider- Man enters, working for the Kingpin and consisting of Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Vulture, Mysterio, Electro and Kraven the Hunter. They are quickly and violently ripped apart, bitten and zombified (except Sandman who hopefully flees by turning into sand and disguising himself as the dirt Zombie Spider- Man stood on), and end up eating Spider-Man's friends, which causes them to be killed in retaliation. The only uninfected person who could help the zombie Spider-Man avenge Aunt May and Mary Jane is Sandman. Upon him leaving and dead, Zombie Spider-Man thanked Sandman, to which Sandman replies \\"Good riddance, ya disgusting freak\\". Later, Sandman was congratulated by Uatu the Watcher for the wipeout help. Secret Wars (2015) Two versions of the Sinister Six appears in the Secret Wars storyline where they each reside in their part of Battleworld: * In the tie-in issues of Spider-Verse, the Sinister Six featured in that mini-series reside in the Battleworld domain of Arachnia. This team consists of Doctor Octopus, Kraven the Hunter, Scorpion, Mysterio, Shocker, and Vulture. Mayor Norman Osborn sent the Sinister Six to apprehend Spider-Gwen, Spider-UK, Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Girl, Spider-Man India, and Spider-Ham. During Spider-Gwen's infiltration of Oscorp, she found a list that labels her and the others as the Sinister Six.Spider-Verse Vol. 2 #2 * In Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows, the Sinister Six works under the Regency's leader Regent who captures all those with natural powers to enhance his own, leaving the Sinister Six out as they are all technology-based villains. The team consists of Doctor Octopus, Kraven the Hunter, Hobgoblin, Mysterio, Shocker, and Vulture. Regent orders them to capture the resurfaced Spider-Man after years of hiding. However, with Spider-Man now fighting to protect his child rather than himself, he kills Doctor Octopus in their first rematch while Hobgoblin was caught in an explosion and Vulture was incapacitated. Regent later recruited Beetle, Boomerang, and Rhino to fill in the membership gaps. The rest of the Six end up being defeated when the remaining Avengers emerge to help Spider-Man protect his daughter and Power Pack.Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows #2 Spider-Man: Reign An older version of the Sinister Six, dubbed the \\"Sinner Six\\" appeared in Spider-Man: Reign. This version of the team (composed of Scorpion, Electro, Mysterio, Kraven the Hunter, Sandman, and Hydro-Man) are forced into the employ of New York's fascist mayor Mayor Waters via microchips placed inside them that would detonate if they attempted to leave the city. If they succeeded in killing Spider-Man, they would be given their freedom. Scorpion was tossed out a window and presumably killed by Spider-Man. Electro and Hydro-Man were killed when Spider-Man caused the two to fall onto each other. Spider-Man defeated both Kraven and Mysterio and left them webbed up. After his long-lost daughter was killed by the Reign (policemen under Waters' control), Sandman confronts Waters who gives him the detonator. As Spider-Man is battling a series of Venom symbiotes, Sandman gives him the detonator before allowing himself to be devoured by the symbiotes. Spider-Man presses the detonator, causing the rest of the Six to presumably explode. Spider-Verse During the Spider-Verse storyline, a version of the Sinister Six called the Six Men of Sinestry resides on Earth-803 where it is set in Industrial Age New York in 1895. The team is led by the Green Goblin and composed of Doctor Octopus, Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Mysterio, and Vulture. Their objective was to steal the Mayor's plans. They battled Lady Spider and were forced to retreat after they were overwhelmed, yet they were able to accomplish their task.Spider-Verse #1 (2015) The Six Men of Sinestry appeared once more attacking Lady Spider and Spider-Man 2099 when they were fixing up Leopardon, but end up beaten by the two spiders (with Lady Spider exclaiming in passing that Sinestry is not a real word).

The group went up against Nick Fury and the Ultimates after the villains escaped a S.H.I.E.L.D. prison they were held in after each had been defeated by Spider-Man and arrested by S.H.I.E.L.D. for illegally altering their own genetic codes. Spider-Man temporarily became the sixth member as he believed that Aunt May had been kidnapped. When Spider-Man is informed that his aunt was safe in S.H.I.E.L.D custody, Spider-Man turned on the Ultimate Six and helped the Ultimates defeat the Ultimate Six. In Ultimate X-Men Annual #1, the X-Men fought simulations of the five in the Danger Room. The Ultimate Six return in \\"The Death of Spider-Man\\" storyline. It is revealed that Norman Osborn did not die as originally thought but had survived. The Goblin transforms and escapes at the first chance, breaking out fellow prisoners Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Electro, and Kraven the Hunter with Vulture as a new addition to the team.

It is their luck that they have escaped at the same time the Ultimates fight the New Avengers as there will be no one to stop them from attacking Spider-Man.Ultimate Spider- Man #156 However, Doctor Octopus does not want to kill Spider-Man stating that he and Osborn were responsible for Spider-Man's creation. Osborn retaliates by turning into the Goblin and killing Doctor Octopus.Ultimate Spider-Man #157 The remaining five villains make their way to Elijah Stern's lair where Vulture's suit is upgraded and Kraven gets a set of blasters and knives. The five go to Peter Parker's house in Queens and confront Johnny Storm and Bobby Drake.

Sandman gets back up and assists Vulture into knocking down Peter. Electro regains consciousness and is prepared to deal the final blow. Aunt May suddenly arrives on the scene, shooting Electro multiple times. This causes Electro to unleash a huge amount of electricity which renders Kraven, Sandman and Vulture unconscious. As May and Peter embrace, the Goblin gets back on his feet and prepares to attack.Ultimate Spider-Man #159 After a brutal battle through Queens, Peter finally kills the Goblin with a flaming van but is caught in its explosion. Culminated with a bullet wound earlier, Peter dies in his aunt's arms as Osborn seemingly dies with a smile in victory.Ultimate Spider-Man #160 Sinister Six In the Spider-Man 25th Anniversary Special, Peter Parker, a.k.a.

Formed in season two's two-part premiere, the Insidious Six is created by the Kingpin to settle a debt with his enemy Silvermane and consists of Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, Shocker, Chameleon, Rhino and Scorpion. When they realize the connection between Peter Parker photographing Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus and Chameleon trick Peter's Aunt May into thinking he is ill and keep her imprisoned in a fake hospital. The Insidious Six overpower and unmask Spider- Man due to the hero's temporary loss of powers, only to assume Peter came to fight them himself because he could not find the real Spider-Man. Later on, Spider-Man is able to strategically defeat them when his powers partially return. The Insidious Six return in \\"Six Forgotten Warriors\\", with Vulture replacing Mysterio, who was killed in a previous episode. They attempt to unlock a Doomsday machine, but the Chameleon betrays the group to side with his foster father, the Red Skull. After the team is defeated again, it is disbanded for good and its members return to their own lives. * The Sinister Six appear in The Spectacular Spider-Man. Introduced in the episode \\"Group Therapy\\", this iteration of the group consists of Doctor Octopus, Sandman, Shocker, Vulture, Rhino, and Electro. Similarly to the comics, Doctor Octopus is the group's founder and leader. The villains pool their resources and organize a jailbreak orchestrated by Doc Ock via Hammerhead, then go after Spider-Man, though the hero eventually defeats them using his symbiote suit. In the episode \\"Reinforcement\\", Doc Ock assumes the Master Planner alias and arranges for the Sinister Six's reformation, now with Kraven the Hunter and an android duplicate of Mysterio replacing Shocker while Doc Ock himself oversees their work from the shadows. The Sinister Six are again defeated by Spider- Man, though only the robot Mysterio is arrested as the others escaped before the police arrived. In \\"Shear Strength\\", the remaining members help Doc Ock with his plans to take over the world by hacking into the FBI servers, but Spider-Man thwarts them and captures Electro. In later episodes, only Vulture is shown to have remained by Doctor Octopus' side, and both are eventually captured in \\"Gangland\\". * The Sinister Six appear in the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series. Introduced in the second season, the group make four appearances. In their self-titled episode, the group consists of Doctor Octopus, Electro, Kraven the Hunter, Rhino, Beetle, and a mind-controlled Lizard. The Sinister Six attack Spider-Man, but he defeats them with help from his friends and fellow S.H.I.E.L.D. trainees. Lizard escapes while the others are arrested. In \\"Return of the Sinister Six\\", Doctor Octopus reforms the team with Scorpion replacing Beetle, and provides them all with high-tech armor made from stolen Oscorp technology. They are again defeated by Spider-Man and his team, with help from Iron Patriot. Doctor Octopus spends the fourth season, titled Ultimate Spider-Man vs. the Sinister 6, secretly forming a Sinister Seven with help from the terrorist organization HYDRA. While Spider- Man and the Web Warriors defeat and capture supervillains to thin out Octavius' potential candidates, the villain goes on to recruit Kraven, Electro, a demonic Green Goblin from another universe, Hydro-Man, and a mind- controlled Rhino; with Scarlet Spider acting as a mole within Spider-Man's team. They are defeated by Spider-Man and his allies in \\"The New Sinister Six\\" after Scarlet Spider defects to the heroes' side, though Doctor Octopus manages to escape. In the series finale, \\"Graduation Day\\", Doctor Octopus forms the Superior Sinister Six with Kraven, Scorpion, and a mind-controlled Vulture, Rhino, and Crossbones mutated into a new Lizard to eliminate Spider- Man after learning his secret identity. Spider-Man defeats them one last time, freeing the brainwashed villains from Doctor Octopus' control before persuading him to surrender. * The Sinister Six appears in the 2017 Spider-Man animated. Debuting in \\"The Rise of Doc Ock, Part 4\\", they were originally the Osborn Commandos, a fighting force brought together by Norman Osborn and made up of the Osborn Academy's staff and students. Their ranks consist of Doctor Octopus, Vulture, Rhino, Alistair Smythe, and Steel Spider. However, Doc Ock defects and places the team under mind control, re-branding the team as the Sinister Five. In the episode \\"Hobgoblin Pt. 1\\", Doctor Octopus also places Spider-Man under mind control and has him join the team to make it the Sinister Six. After Harry Osborn becomes the Hobgoblin to intervene, he frees Spider-Man and the rest of the team from Doctor Octopus' control. All members are defeated and arrested by the end of season one. Film =Amazing Spider-Man series= In December 2013, Sony announced two spin-offs of The Amazing Spider-Man franchise, The Sinister Six and Venom, with Drew Goddard attached to write and direct The Sinister Six. Throughout The Amazing Spider- Man 2, a line-up/set-up of the team was teased; during the end credits, weapons/technology belonging to Rhino, Vulture, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, and Kraven the Hunter were revealed, confirming them as the members, with the Green Goblin serving as the leader (however, the line-up is left in debate as Goddard stated he wanted to adopt a more classic adaptation of the group which would have included Sandman and Doc Ock as the leader). The film was said to be a redemption story for the characters, and would probably not feature Spider-Man. As the Sinister Six's original goal, however, was to kill him, there would seem to be a chance that he would appear. The film was originally scheduled for release on November 11, 2016. However, after the announcement in February 2015 of a new Spider-Man franchise with Marvel Studios, the spin-offs were postponed and eventually canceled. =Marvel Cinematic Universe= In an email from Amy Pascal leaked during the Sony Pictures hack, Pascal revealed that she planned for Tom Holland's Spider-Man to appear in a Sinister Six film set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe dependent on the success of the then- upcoming licensing agreement with Marvel Studios. Four potential Sinister Six members have so far made an appearance in the MCU. Adrian Toomes and Quentin Beck / Mysterio appeared as the main antagonists in Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home respectively. Herman Schultz / Shocker and Mac Gargan have also appeared as minor antagonists in Homecoming. Jamie Foxx is set to reprise his role as Max Dillon / Electro from The Amazing Spider-Man 2; albeit as a new incarnation of the character for the third, as yet untitled Spider-Man movie. =Sony's Marvel Universe= Following the collaboration between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures, many spin-offs that had been in development before were revived, with Venom released on October 5, 2018. Sony's December 2013 plans for their own expanded universe included a film based on the Sinister Six group of Spider-Man villains, with Drew Goddard attached to write and potentially direct. Goddard was confirmed to be directing the film in April 2014. The film was believed to have been canceled by November 2015 when Sony was focusing on its new reboot with Marvel. In October 2018, Goddard acknowledged that his script could eventually be used for a film. By December of the same year, producer Amy Pascal confirmed that the studio intends to use the script in an upcoming project and expressed the company's desire for the filmmaker to direct the film as well. =Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse= Although never officially labeled as such, Spider- Man: Into the Spider-Verse features a team of villains that shared several similar traits with the Sinister Six. The group is led by the Kingpin, and his henchmen include a female version of Doctor Octopus named Olivia \\"Liv\\" Octavius, the Prowler, the Green Goblin, the Scorpion, and Tombstone. The Kingpin's ultimate goal is to use the Super Collider, a device created by Doctor Octopus and her fellow Alchemax scientists, to access different dimensions and reunite with an alternate version of his family after his died in a car crash. However, the unstable Collider brings several alternate versions of Spider-Man into his universe. During the film, the Green Goblin is killed in an explosion during the Collider's first test and the Prowler is murdered by the Kingpin for refusing to kill the new Spider-Man upon discovering he was his nephew Miles Morales. At the end of the film, Doctor Octopus is hit by a passing truck during the final battle at the Collider while the Kingpin, the Scorpion, and Tombstone are defeated by the assembled Spider-Men and subsequently arrested by the police.

Everyone but Doc Ock were originally imprisoned at the Raft before the latter released and recruited them in an attempt to exact revenge on his former business partner turned mayor, Norman Osborn. While he shares this goal with Mister Negative, he promises the others their greatest desires in exchange for their assistance: helping Electro become a being of pure energy, removing Rhino's armor, expunging Scorpion's criminal record and erasing his gambling debts, and curing Vulture of his spinal cancer. The group clashes with Spider-Man when he interferes, though they easily defeat him during their first fight. Following this, the Sinister Six split up to attack different Oscorp properties while Doctor Octopus secures the Devil's Breath virus - a deadly chemical weapon that Oscorp developed to cure Osborn's terminally ill son Harry and also led to Mister Negative's creation - and releases it in Times Square; infecting numerous people and causing Manhattan to descend into chaos. After capturing Vulture, Electro, Rhino, and Scorpion, Spider-Man defeats Mister Negative before he can steal the cure, but Doctor Octopus escapes with it and Osborn. Spider-Man is eventually able to save Norman, secure the cure, and defeat Doctor Octopus. By the end of the game, most of the Sinister Six are re-arrested and re- imprisoned at the Raft, though Mister Negative's whereabouts are unknown.

Varley later turned this novel into the script for the 1989 film Millennium, both of which are based on Varley's short story \\"Air Raid\\", which was published in 1977. Plot introduction Millennium features a civilization that has dubbed itself \\"The Last Age\\". Due to millennia of warfare of every type (nineteen nuclear wars alone), the Earth has been heavily polluted and humanity's gene pool irreparably damaged. They have thus embarked on a desperate plan; time travel into the past, collect healthy humans, and send them to an uncontaminated planet to rebuild civilization. The time travelers can only take people that will have no further effect on the timeline: those who have vanished without a trace, or died without being observed; otherwise they would be changing the past, which risks a temporal paradox and perhaps even a catastrophic breakdown of the fabric of time. Though they collect everyone they can, they exert a great deal of effort on those destined to die in various disasters such as sinking ships and crashing airplanes (and once a century of Roman soldiers lost and dying in the North African desert). As such incidents leave no survivors to report interference and change the timeline, they can freely remove the living but soon-to-die victims, and replace them with convincing corpses they have manufactured in the future. The novel deals with several of the raids, their eventual discovery in the present day, and the fallout that results from changes to the present day reverberating into the future. The story follows Louise Baltimore, who is in charge of a \\"snatch team\\" that goes back into the past to kidnap people who would otherwise die. Because of the massive pollution and the genetic damage she has sustained, she is missing one leg and must get advanced medical treatment daily. Her natural appearance is quite ugly due to skin damage (from \\"paraleprosy\\") and other problems; however, she wears a special \\"skin suit\\" which makes her look whole and beautiful (which may or may not be real--she is an unreliable narrator), and gives her a functional artificial leg. The team she leads uses a \\"time gate\\" to appear in the bathroom aboard an airplane in flight. Dressed to look like flight attendants, they begin to bluff the passengers into entering the bathroom where they are pushed into the gate, to arrive in the future. After large numbers of people disappear, the remaining passengers become suspicious. The future team then uses special weapons to stun them before throwing them through the gate. During the removal of the passengers, they run into an unexpected hijacker. The ensuing gunplay is one-sided; one of the snatch team members is killed, and her stunner is lost. The rest of the team finishes removing the passengers and the real flight attendants. The team then scatters pre-burnt body parts around the plane so they will be found after the crash. As the plane approaches the moment when it is destined to crash, the lost weapon still has not been found. Upon returning to her present (our future), Louise is informed that the weapon that was left behind has caused a paradox and that it must be recovered to prevent a breakdown in the fabric of time. Miscellaneous information Most of the chapter titles are named after famous novels and short stories about time travel by other authors, as Varley mentions in the book's author's note: \\"The time-travel story has a long history in science fiction. The theme has been so extensively explored, in fact, that I found it no trouble to write a book with chapter titles borrowed almost exclusively from the long list of stories that served, in one way or another, as ancestors to this one.\\" Film adaptation John Varley worked on numerous drafts of a screenplay for over ten years and half a dozen directors until it was finally filmed by Michael Anderson in 1989. As of July 2014, the film holds a 13% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.Rotten Tomatoes, \\"Millennium (1989)\\". Accessed January 29, 2016. Reception Greg Costikyan reviewed Millennium in Ares Magazine #15 and commented that \\"Millennium is old-fashioned, seamless science fiction. One gets the feeling that all is done well, but most of it has been done before. Does this mean one shouldn't buy it? By no means. There is certainly little enough well-written old-fashioned science fiction being published.\\" It was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award in 1983, and for both the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1984.

The Soho Manufactory () was an early factory which pioneered mass production on the assembly line principle, in Soho, Birmingham, England, at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. It operated from 1766–1848 and was demolished in 1863. Beginnings The factory was established by the \\"toy\\" manufacturer Matthew Boulton and his business partner John Fothergill. In 1761, they leased a site on Handsworth Heath, containing a cottage and a water-driven metal-rolling mill. The mill was replaced by a new factory, designed and built by the Wyatt family of Lichfield, and completed in 1766. The cottage was later demolished and Boulton's home (Soho House) was built on the site, also by the Wyatts. Water was drawn from Hockley Brook. Production The Soho Manufactory c. 1860. The Manufactory produced a wide range of goods from buttons, buckles and boxes to japanned ware (collectively called \\"toys\\"), and later luxury products such as silverware and ormolu (a type of gilded bronze). Steam engines In 1782, it became the first site with a Watt steam engine with the sun and planet gear. It was also home to the first steam-powered mint, whose presses were subsequently used at the first Birmingham Mint. Later In later years, the Manufactory was served by canal at Soho Wharf, at the end of the short Soho Branch of the Birmingham Canal Navigations' Soho Loop. The manufactory was demolished in the middle of the 19th century and the site used for housing.

Sutton revoked this license and patronised a different group of actors, but some actors tried unsuccessfully to use the cancelled 1595 warrant in Chester in November 1602.Elizabeth Baldwin, Lawrence Clopper, David Mills, Records of Early English Drama: Cheshire Including Chester, Volume 1 (Manchester, 2007), p. 293. Lord Dudley's players were in Newcastle in March 1600.J. J. Anderson, Records of Early English Drama: Newcastle Upon Tyne, Volume 5 (Manchester, 1982), p. 133, 141. In 1615 the leader of the company was called Dishley.William Kelly, Notices Illustrative of the Drama, and Other Popular Amusements, from Manuscripts of the Borough of Leicester (London, 1865), p. 294. Political career Standing under the name Edward Sutton, Dudley was elected as one of the two knights of the shire for Staffordshire in 1584. Still only 17 years old, he was returned ahead in order of precedence of Edward Legh. It is not clear how this was achieved. Legh was made High Sheriff of Staffordshire on the day of the election and had to be given leave of absence by Parliament. Sutton made no recorded contributions in the Commons. He succeeded his father in 1586 and so was unable to stand for election in that year. Despite his apparent anxiety to serve in the councils of his country, Dudley did not take his seat in the House of Lords until 1593. Dudley's most important political intervention came through the Staffordshire election scandal of 1597.The History of Parliament: Constituencies 1558–1603 – Staffordshire Pursuing a property dispute with the Worcestershire Lytteltons, Dudley put up his brother John as a candidate, in an attempt to stop the election of Sir Edward Littleton of Pillaton Hall, a close ally of Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex. Dudley ensured success by procuring a blank election return from Thomas Whorwood, the High Sheriff, who was John Sutton's father-in-law. Littleton, cheated of certain victory, filed bills against the Dudleys and Whorwood in Star Chamber. Among his complaints against Lord Dudley was that he had personally voted for his brother in the voice vote at Stafford. As a peer, Dudley should have no part in elections to the Commons, Littleton maintained—apparently the first time this constitutional principle was expressed. The other candidate, Sir Christopher Blount, Essex's stepfather, was also offended at having been placed below Sutton on the election indenture. His wife, Essex's mother, wrote to the Earl complaining about the outrage, and Dudley was summoned before the Privy Council. However, the parliament was soon over, and it appears that Littleton chose to concentrate his efforts on the hapless Whorwood. Although his chicanery and bad manners had alienated some of the greatest in the land, the consequences for Dudley might have been worse. Landowner and industrialist Dudley spent most of his life pressured by the authorities to meet debts that were beyond his ability to pay, partly inherited from his father, and partly the result of his own poor management of his resources. Lord Dudley, like his immediate ancestors, owned substantial estates around Dudley Castle including the manors of Dudley, Sedgley and Kingswinford. He developed the mineral resources of these estates, building (probably) five blast furnaces on them. He obtained a licence to use the patent of John Robinson (or Rovenson) for making iron with pitcoal (that is, mineral coal) in 1619, and in 1622 renewed this patent in his own name. Dudley was said to be an innovator who set up an early reverberatory furnace using coal and a glassworks directed by Paul Tissac, or Tyzack, where coal rather than wood was first used as fuel. These projects brought him no profit.Lawrence Stone, Crisis of the Aristocracy (Oxford, 1965), pp. 352-3: John Wiedhofft Gough, The Rise of the Entrepreneur (London, 1969), p. 217. He brought his illegitimate son Dud Dudley home from Balliol College, Oxford to manage his ironworks, but this strategy was not entirely successful. Ultimately Edward Dudley fell out with Dud and expelled Dud from the new coke-fired blast furnace that Edward had built at Hasco Bridge on the boundary between Gornal and Himley. Debts continued to grow, and by 1593 the estate had been sequestrated. The ironworks were essential because the family's debts were already so large that Lord Edward's father's will had earmarked all the proceeds of his ironworks for 21 years to pay creditors, who were given precedence over his widow and younger children. Money issues soured relations with John, Edward Sutton's younger brother. John had been compensated for his exclusion from a portion of his father's estate by the promise of an annuity from his brother, which Edward never paid. The electoral fraud of 1597 might have helped John establish new contacts and income streams, but the parliament lasted little more than three months and the scandal made any further parliamentary career impossible for him. Always short of money, Edward Dudley fought numerous battles to maintain his inheritance and income, many of them through violence. His most bitter feud was with Gilbert Lyttelton, centred on the farm of Prestwood, near Kinver, and reached its height in the 1590s. Prestwood is at the confluence of the River Smestow and the Worcestershire Stour.History of Parliament Online: 1558–1603 Members – LYTTELTON, Gilbert (Author: S. M. Thorpe) Dudley had Lyttelton ejected by force. He then claimed the right to seize outlaws' goods on other Lyttelton estates and raided them, driving off the sheep and cattle. Extending the dispute still further, he claimed one of Lyttelton's coal mines. He had the miners arrested, confiscated the stocks of coal and set the mine on fire. The Privy Council summoned Dudley and tried to reason with him, to no effect. Lyttelton complained to the Star Chamber, which found in his favour, fining Dudley heavily for rioting and cattle rustling. It was this that led Dudley to attempt revenge by blocking Edward Littleton's election, as he was a distant kinsman of Gilbert Lyttelton. Feelings were very bitter on both sides. The Privy Council had to write to the Worcestershire assizes in July 1598, demanding action against two of Gilbert Lyttelton's sons, Stephen and John, who had attacked John Sutton and his retainers, although the Dudleys had already lost the property dispute. Marriage and family Dudley was married at the age of 14 to Theodosia Harington (d. 1649). She was the daughter of James Harington of Exton, Rutland, a lawyer and long-serving MP.History of Parliament Online: 1558–1603 Members – HARINGTON, James I (Author: Roger Virgoe) The Haringtons were the most important landowners in Rutland and Theodosia's eldest brother, John, was created Baron Harington of Exton in 1603. Dudley and Theodosia had a son and four daughters:Baron Dudley at Cracroft's Peerage :*Ferdinando Sutton (1588-1621), who married Honora Seymour, a daughter of Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp, who was considered by some a potential claimant to the throne on the death of Elizabeth I. :*Mary Sutton (1586–1645), who married Alexander Home, 1st Earl of Home. :*Anne Sutton (1589-1615), who married Hans Meinhard von Schönberg, the Palatine Ambassador to England: their son was Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg. :*Margaret Sutton (b. 1597), who married Sir Miles Hobart of Fleet Street and Little Plumstead, Norfolk, a son of Sir Henry Hobart and Dorothy Bell.Henry Sydney Grazebrook, 'An Account of the Barons of Dudley', Collections for a History of Staffordshire, vol. 9 (1880), p. 113. They had sons Miles, Tom, John and James. She was buried at St Margaret's, Westminster.The History and Antiquities of the County of Norfolk: Blofield, Brothercross,and Clacklose (Norwich, 1781), p. 36. :*Theodosia Sutton (1599-1615). Lord Dudley also had a longtime mistress Elizabeth Tomlinson, who bore him a large family of illegitimate children, at least 11 in number. Lord Dudley provided for this second family. The eldest Robert Dudley otherwise Tomlinson was given a small estate at Netherton in Dudley. Another son Dud Dudley was given a lease of Chasepool Lodge in Swindon, Staffordshire. A daughter Jane was grandmother to ironmaster Abraham Darby I. At the Star Chamber, Gilbert Lyttelton attempted to discredit Dudley by claiming that he had abandoned his wife in London without support to live with Elizabeth Tomlinson, \\"a lewd and infamous woman, a base collier's daughter\\". The Privy Council ordered Dudley to pay his wife an allowance, which he failed to do. In August 1597 he was sent to Fleet Prison. He was released after a few days, on condition that he pay maintenance of £100 annually for his wife, and £20 for each legitimate child. In less than 18 months he was back before the Privy Council, having got into arrears.Henry Sydney Grazebrook, 'An Account of the Barons of Dudley', Collections for a History of Staffordshire, vol. 9 (1880), p. 112. Dudley's legitimate son, Ferdinando, predeceased him, leaving a daughter Frances. Dudley married this granddaughter to Humble Ward, the son of a wealthy goldsmith, William Ward, who was one of his creditors. Dudley died on 23 June 1643 and was buried in St Edmund's Church, Dudley. Frances Ward inherited the estates, with their debts, and became Baroness Dudley suo jure. Humble Ward paid the debts and redeemed the estates for the benefit of themselves and their descendants.

The southern portion of the highway is signed as the Antelope Valley Freeway. The route connects Interstate 5 (I-5, Golden State Freeway) on the border of the city of Santa Clarita to the north and the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Granada Hills and Sylmar to the south, with U.S. Route 395 (US 395) near Inyokern. Legislatively, the route extends south of I-5 to SR 1 in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles; however, the portion south of the junction with I-5 has not been constructed. The southern part of the constructed route is a busy commuter freeway serving and connecting the cities of Santa Clarita, Palmdale, and Lancaster to the rest of the Greater Los Angeles area. The northern portion, from Vincent (south of Palmdale) to US 395, is legislatively named the Aerospace Highway, as the highway serves Edwards Air Force Base, once one of the primary landing strips for NASA's Space Shuttle. This section is rural, following the line between the hot Mojave desert and the forming Sierra Nevada mountain range. Most of SR 14 is loosely paralleled by a main line of the Southern Pacific Railroad, used for the Antelope Valley Line of the Metrolink commuter rail system as well as a connection between Los Angeles and the Central Valley via Tehachapi Pass. Linked with US 395, this road also connects Los Angeles with such places as Mammoth Mountain, Mono Lake, Yosemite National Park and Reno, Nevada. SR 14 was part of US 6 prior to truncation in 1964, when US 6 was a coast-to-coast route from Long Beach to Provincetown, Massachusetts. The non-freeway segment of SR 14 from Silver Queen Road north of Rosamond to Mojave is known as Sierra Highway, as is the old routing between I-5 and Silver Queen Road where SR 14 has been moved to a newer freeway alignment. Portions of SR 14 remain signed with names associated with US 6, including Midland Trail, Theodore Roosevelt Highway, and Grand Army of the Republic Highway. Route description SR 14 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. Antelope Valley Freeway Antelope Valley Freeway through the San Gabriel Mountains, with California Aqueduct at Palmdale in the foreground The southern portion of the freeway, from I-5 to the Avenue D exit near Lancaster, has been designated the Antelope Valley Freeway by the state legislature. The Antelope Valley Freeway begins in the Santa Susana Mountains at the Newhall Pass interchange by splitting from the Golden State Freeway (I-5). This is the busiest portion of the route with an annual average daily traffic (AADT) count of 169,000 vehicles per day. The freeway forms much of the eastern boundary of Santa Clarita along its route. Past Santa Clarita, the road continues northeast and crosses the Sierra Pelona Mountains and western San Gabriel Mountains via the canyon of the seasonal Santa Clara River. The ascent is mostly rugged and rural terrain, with only two small towns along the ascent, first Agua Dulce and later Acton. Between the two towns, the freeway forms the southern boundary of Vasquez Rocks Park, a county park. The highway crests the Sierra Pelona Mountains via Escondido Summit, at an elevation of , before descending and passing by Acton to the north. The highway then crests the San Gabriel Mountains via Soledad Pass, at an elevation of . The route of the highway through the mountains loosely parallels that of the main line of the Southern Pacific Railroad, which is also used for the Metrolink Antelope Valley Line. After cresting both mountain passes, the highway descends into the Antelope Valley, a large valley within the Mojave Desert. The highway crosses Angeles Forest Highway and the California Aqueduct in the descent. SR 14 serves as the primary north–south thoroughfare for the communities of Palmdale and Lancaster. Between Palmdale Boulevard (County Route N2) and Avenue D in Lancaster, SR 14 runs concurrently with SR 138. Aerospace Highway From the Pearblossom Highway exit south of Palmdale to its northern terminus at US 395 near Inyokern, SR 14 has been designated the Aerospace Highway. Between Pearblossom Highway and Avenue S, there is a vista point overlooking Lake Palmdale, which features a historic plaque that honors aviation accomplishments including the space shuttle, breaking the sound barrier and the speed record. The freeway passes the Los Angeles–Kern county line at Avenue A, and continues to run north through Rosamond and Mojave. In Rosamond, the highway passes close to Edwards Air Force Base, which was often used as one of the main landing strips for NASA's space shuttle, and as the base for the X-15 and many other air and spacecraft. The freeway portion terminates just south of Mojave, where SR 14 serves as the main street and runs through the downtown area. To the east of the route is Mojave Air & Space Port, home to the National Test Pilot School and SpaceShipOne, the first privately funded human spaceflight, as well as a vast airplane graveyard; all are visible from SR 14. The northern terminus of SR 14 near Inyokern SR 58 was formerly routed concurrently with SR 14 through Mojave, before it was rerouted onto a bypass running north and east of the town. The character of the highway changes as it leaves California City with the last interchange located at California City Boulevard. Now a divided highway with at-grade intersections, departs the corridor of the main Southern Pacific Line, to follow the crest of the forming Sierra Nevada mountains. The route continues to follow a branch line of the Southern Pacific used as a connector for the Trona Railway. The main line of the railroad proceeds towards the Central Valley via Tehachapi Pass. Though SR 14 heads away from the pass, the highway has views of the mountains and the Tehachapi Pass Wind Farm. The scenery also changes, as the highway departs the Mojave Desert and crosses Red Rock Canyon State Park. Traffic counts drop dramatically as the highway becomes more rural, with an AADT of 3,200 vehicles at the northern terminus. SR 14 continues north toward US 395 in Inyokern, much of its routing as an expressway. Towards its northern terminus, SR 14 runs briefly concurrently with SR 178\\\\. At its northern terminus, SR 14 merges with US 395 as it turns into an expressway heading north to Bishop. As US 395 the route continues to follow the crest of the Sierra Nevada, serving Owens Valley, Mammoth Mountain, Yosemite National Park and Mono Lake. History Trails Looking south at the corner of Sierra Highway and Lancaster Boulevard in Lancaster in 1913 The first road to use the general alignment of modern SR 14 was called the El Camino Sierra, or Sierra Highway, which extended from Los Angeles to Lake Tahoe. A dirt road was completed in the 1910s from what had been a pack trail. The Los Angeles Times declared El Camino Sierra complete in 1931, when the portion from Mojave to the Owens Valley, along modern US 395, was paved. During the late 19th century, the corridor of modern SR 14 was also in use by the Southern Pacific Railroad for two lines. The first is a line to connect Los Angeles with the Central Valley, via Tehachapi Pass. While significantly longer than the more direct Ridge Route (east of modern I-5), Tehachapi Pass is lower than Tejon Pass along the Ridge Route, with a longer, less steep grade on the descent into the Central Valley. This rail line remains the primary rail line to connect southern and northern California in use today, now owned and operated by the Union Pacific Railroad. The second resulted when the Southern Pacific acquired the unfinished Carson and Colorado Railroad in 1900. The Southern Pacific built a standard gauge connector to the narrow gauge Carson and Colorado line from their main at Mojave. Although plans were to eventually convert this acquired line to standard gauge, most of the line was abandoned before the conversion was complete. However, the southern portion of this line is still active and used for connections to the Trona Railway. The Midland Trail was one of the first organized coast-to-coast trails in the United States. In the trail's infancy, its routing changed numerous times. By 1925, the Midland Trail was established along what is modern State Route 168, joining El Camino Sierra in Big Pine. Other named trails that would eventually follow this route included the Theodore Roosevelt highway, and Grand Army of the Republic Highway. Parts of modern SR 14 continue to be signed with these names, and north of Los Angeles County is still officially designated \\"El Camino Sierra / Midland Trail\\" as well as the aforementioned \\"Aerospace Highway\\". U.S. Route 6 US 6 was extended from Greeley, Colorado, to Long Beach, California, on June 21, 1937. Most of this extension used the Midland Trail, although the route entered California from Nevada slightly north of the previous route of the Midland Trail, instead passing through Bishop. While being designated US 6, parts of modern SR 14 were upgraded to freeway standards. As part of the 1964 state highway renumbering, US 6 was truncated at Bishop. The portion of US 6 from Inyokern to Los Angeles was designated SR 14\\\\. Previously, the SR 14 designation was used for Artesia Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue, in the Los Angeles area, a portion of modern SR 91. Between 1963 and 1975, significant portions of US 6/SR 14 were moved to a freeway alignment. The former routing south of Mojave (and the current routing to the north) is still known as Sierra Highway. The first freeway section, from just east of Solemint Junction to Red Rover Mine Road, was completed in 1963. Further portions in the intercanyon areas of Acton to Soledad Pass were completed by 1965. By 1966, the freeway was complete as far north as Avenue P-8 (now Technology Drive) in Palmdale. The freeway was completed to Mojave by 1972. Incidents The Newhall Pass interchange, where I-5, Sierra Highway, Foothill Boulevard, San Fernando Road and the southern terminus of SR 14 meet, has been the site of a number of catastrophic incidents. The interchange has partially collapsed twice due to earthquakes: the 1971 Sylmar earthquake and the 1994 Northridge earthquake. As a result of the 1994 collapse, this interchange was renamed the \\"Clarence Wayne Dean Memorial Interchange\\", honoring a Los Angeles Police Department motorcycle officer killed when he was unable to stop in time and drove off the collapsed flyover ramp from SR 14 south to I-5 south. After both earthquakes, the collapsed portions were rebuilt and surviving portions reinforced. In 2007, two tractor-trailer trucks collided in a tunnel along the truck lanes for southbound I-5 at the interchange. A resulting fire started, soon encompassing the entire tunnel along with 30 other trucks and one passenger vehicle that were in the tunnel at the time. The truck tunnel was closed for several days for structural damage inspections and repairs. Cancelled plans Route 14 inside Red Rock Canyon SR 14 is an unfinished route, as the definition in the California Streets and Highways Code states that the route begins at SR 1 (Pacific Coast Highway), near Sunset Boulevard in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. Between the constructed end and legislative end of SR 14 are the community of Reseda and Topanga State Park. There is no paved road that directly connects these two points, with SR 27 or I-405 being the nearest through roads in this area. The interchange with Sierra Highway at Via Princessa in Santa Clarita has an unusual design, with long flyover ramps for the connections. This is the result of a freeway revolt by the residents of Santa Clarita that canceled plans for a freeway extension of SR 126. While the Via Princessa alignment of SR 126 was canceled, the city of Santa Clarita constructed the Cross Valley Connector (CVC) to connect SR 126 directly to SR 14 via Newhall Ranch Road and Golden Valley Road. The final CVC section, the bridge over the Santa Clara River, was opened on March 27, 2010. Future Rapid exurban growth in Santa Clarita, Lancaster, and Palmdale has made the Antelope Valley Freeway one of the most congested in southern California, with average rush hour speeds well below . Future predictions call for continued growth along the SR 14 corridor, including predictions of a tripling of the population of Palmdale by 2030. In response, multiple government agencies have proposed adding more transportation arteries between Los Angeles and the Antelope Valley, as well as expanding the capacity of the existing SR 14 and rail corridors. Several proposals have been made to bypass the Antelope Valley Freeway by boring a tunnel under the San Gabriel Mountains and extending the Glendale Freeway through it to the Antelope Valley. In 2003, Caltrans published a map showing potential improvements to the transportation infrastructure of southern California. The proposal showed both the unconstructed portion of SR 14 and new routes over or under the mountains to Antelope Valley. In 2005, the idea was advanced as a combination toll tunnel and surface highway. Preliminary studies estimated costs around $3 billion and suggested charging a varying toll, adjusted for the time of day, averaging around $8 for one-way passage.

He was a joint founder of the Astronomical Society of London, and it was under his name, as President of the Society in 1831, that a petition was successfully submitted to obtain a Royal Charter, whereupon it became the Royal Astronomical Society. Life He was born in Southwark in London in October 1785, the son of James South, a pharmaceutical chemist. John Flint South was his younger half-brother.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: James South He originally trained as a chemist, then as a surgeon, but his interests in astronomy overtook all things. In 1821 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London and in 1822 a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Edward Troughton. He won the Copley Medal in 1826 and the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in that same year. He was knighted by King William IV in 1831. Starting around 1826, James South made plans for a new, larger telescope, an equatorially mounted achromatic refractor (a telescope with a lens) in a new observatory. He bought a 12-inch (actually about 11.8) aperture lens from Robert-Aglaé Cauchoix in Paris for about 1000 pounds, large enough to be the biggest achromatic object lens in the world at the time. The telescope for the lens was completed, but dismantled around 1838. The next largest refractor, was at the Markree Observatory, which successfully completed a 13.3 inch refractor (also a Cauchoix of Paris lens) in the 1830s on a Thomas Grubb mount.Refracting Telescopes of the 19th Century The problem for James South's telescope was the equatorial mount. South was involved in a notorious lawsuit brought against him by the instrument maker Edward Troughton over this equatorial-mount telescope which the latter had constructed for him, and which South considered defective. Troughton sued him for payment and won. South promptly demolished the telescope mount; the 12 inch lens, which had been purchased separately, was preserved and presented to the (Dublin) Dunsink Observatory in 1862.Title: The Observatory of the Late Sir James South Journal: Astronomical register, vol. 8, pp.196-199 The Observatory mounted it on a Grubb equatorial, where it survives to the present day. (See also Great refractors) James was the second owner of the Groombridge Transit Circle of 1806 (after Stephen Groombridge). He died at the observatory on Campden Hill on 19 October 1867. Family In 1816 he married Charlotte Ellis (d.1851). She was an heiress and his new-found wealth enabled him to give up surgery and concentrate on astronomy.ODNB James South Works South and John Herschel jointly produced a catalogue of 380 double stars in 1824, reobserving many of the double stars that had been discovered by William Herschel. South then continued and observed another 458 double stars over the following year. Recognition Craters on Mars and the Moon are named in his honour.

A student of Husserl and Heidegger, he was one of the most prolific German philosophers of the twentieth century. He is known for his two books From Hegel to Nietzsche, which describes the decline of German classical philosophy, and Meaning in History, which challenges the modern, secular progressive narrative of history, which seeks to ground the meaning of history in itself. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Life Löwith was born in Munich to a Christian family of Jewish descent. He was trained in phenomenology under Heidegger, and they developed a close friendship. However this relationship became estranged with Heidegger's affiliation with Nazism, therefore Löwith had to emigrate from Germany in 1934 because of the Fascist regime. He was an important witness in 1936 to Heidegger's continuing allegiance to Nazism.Karl Löwith, \\"My last meeting with Heidegger in Rome\\", in Richard Wolin, The Heidegger Controversy (MIT Press, 1993). He went to Italy and in 1936 he went to Japan ( as did figures like Brunner) where he lectured at Tohoku University, which had its own tradition of phenomenology.Eiichiro Ishida, Japanese Culture: A Study of Origins and Characteristics (Hawaii University Press, 1974), pp. 3-4 But because of the alliance between the Third Reich and Japan he had to leave Japan in 1941 and went to the United States. From 1941 to 1952, he taught at the Hartford Theological Seminary and The New School for Social Research. In 1952 he returned to Germany to teach as Professor of Philosophy at Heidelberg, where he died.  Thought His main influences include Heidegger, Hegel, Nietzsche, and Kierkegaard. His writing after WWII can be read in the same vein as other Christian philosophers and theologians of the 20th century. Often called responses to \\"crisis\\", Christian intellectuals of this era, such as Karl Barth (protestant), Florovsky (Orthodox), and Erich Przywara (Roman Catholic), attempted to articulate an understanding of Christian faith in response to the challenges of scientism, secularism, and skepticism. From Hegel to Nietzsche Meaning in History Löwith's argument in Meaning in History is that the western view of history is confused by the relationship between Christian faith and the modern view, which is neither Christian nor pagan. He writes,\\" The modern mind has not made up its mind whether it should be Christian or pagan, it sees with one eye of faith and one of reason. Hence its vision is necessarily dim in comparison with either Greek or biblical thinking.\\" The modern view is progressive, which is to say that it believes that the trajectory of history is moving towards a fulfillment in the bettering of the world by rational and technological means. Löwith believes that the modern view is a sort of Christian \\"heresy\\" insofar that is depends on the theology that history has a linear movement, in contrast to Greek pagan cyclical view of history. In this critique Löwith is prophetic in the sense that he anticipates the way post-secular theologians will pick up a similar critique of modernity in the 1990s (such is the case in the Radical Orthodox movement). The modern historical consciousness is, according to Löwith, derived from Christianity. But, this is mistaken because Christians are not a historical people, as their view of the world is based on faith. This explains the tendency in history (and philosophy) to see an eschatological view of human progress. Löwith traces the \\"regression\\" of history as opposed to a progression through famous western philosophers and historians. Whereas most genealogies begin from the most antique to the modern, Löwith begins with the most current. He moves from Burckhardt, to Marx, to Hegel, Voltaire, Vico, Bossuet, Augustine, Orosius, and others. He argues that the closer we get to the Biblical vision of history, \\" I cannot discover the slightest hint of a \\"philosophy of history\\". By this he means that a truly theological view of history is not movement to an immanent end, but a transcendent eschatological hope in the consummation of the world. It is not a \\"philosophy\\" or attempt to systematize the movement of history. This point is clear in the epilogue of Meaning in History where he says, \\" The attempt at elucidation of the dependence of the philosophy of history on the eschatological history of fulfillment and salvation does not solve the problem of historical thinking.\\" Here he seems to argue that like the progressive view any theological view that tries to equate the happenings of history with God's action is inadequate, which reveals his true argument: We cannot understand the happening of history by reason. Returning to the idea that Löwith like Barth and others was trying to rethink Christian faith in light of the crisis of world war, Lowith's real concern is the relationship between faith and reason or more specifically faith and history. He writes,\\"The Christian hope is not a worldly desire and expectation that something will probably happen but a cast of mind based on an unconditional faith in God's redemptive purpose. Genuine hope is, therefore, as free and absolute as the act of faith itself. Both hope and faith are Christian virtues of Grace. The reasons for such an unconditional hope and faith cannot rest on rational calculation of their reasonableness. Hence hope can never be refuted by so-called facts; it can neither be assured no discredited by an established experience.\\" His analysis of the relationship between faith and the observable events of history is one of absolute disconnect, which is an idea he seems to adopt from Kierkegaard's similar argument in Practice in Christianity. Lowith's answer to the change of modernity is to say that Christianity has nothing at all to do with history or reason, rather it is about being given faith, which becomes hope in the God- man. He writes,\\" The question is therefore not the justification of absolute hope and faith by their relative reasonableness, but whether such an unconditional hope and faith can be put into man instead of God and the God- man. Hope is justified only by faith which justifies itself.\\" So, whereas the \\"liberal\\" Christianity of his contemporaries tried to accommodate or assimilate faith with reason, Lowith maintains that faith justifies itself.

He served as the first prime minister of Abkhazia after the post was established by the constitution in 1995, holding it until 1997. He returned to the post in 2002 and remained for several months into 2003, and held it for a final time in 2018 until he was killed in a car crash. Early life and career Gagulia was born on 4 January 1948 in the Gudauta district of the Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. He graduated from the Civil Engineering Department of the Belarusian Polytechnic Institute in 1972 and worked at Stroymaster as the chief engineer and the head of the construction site from 1973-1977. He spent the following 15 years as a Deputy Director of Catering at Lake Rizal and as Chairman of the Gudauta district consumer cooperatives. Political career In the year after the Republic of Abkhazia was founded, he worked at the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations of the Council of Ministers of the republic, before eventually serving as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Abkhazia from 1992-1995. During the Georgian-Abkhaz War, Gagulia was a member of the Abkhazian Defense Committee, which was responsible for the distribution of food for the Abkhaz Armed Forces. First Term as Prime Minister (1995–1997) Gagulia became the first Prime Minister of Abkhazia in 1995 following the adoption of the 1994 Constitution of Abkhazia. As prime minister Gagulia had a reputation for being the most pro-Russian of Abkhazia's prime ministers. He steadfastly opposed both reunification with Georgia and the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Georgian-Abkhaz border. He also alluded to the possibility of Abkhazia unifying with Russia. While in this role, he met with a number of foreign leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin and Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze. In 1997, Gagulia resigned from the prime ministership, citing health reasons.  Career (1997–2002)  In between his first two terms as prime minister, Gagulia served as the chair of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Abkhazia. He was also deputy prime minister under Anri Jergenia.  Second Term as Prime Minister (2002–2003)  When Jergenia was fired on 29 November 2002, Gagulia was appointed as prime minister for the second time. He only served for only 5 months until Gagulia's government filed for resignation on 7 April 2003. Earlier that day, nine Abkhazian prisoners had escaped, four of which had been sentenced to death due to their involvement in the 2001 Kodori crisis. President Ardzinba initially refused to accept Gagulia's resignation, but was forced to agree on 8 April. Vice President Valery Arshba denied on 8 April that the government's resignation was due to the prison escape, and stated that instead it was caused by the opposition's plans to hold protest rallies on 10 April.  Career after his Second Term (2003–2018)  On 15 December 2003, Gagulia was appointed head of the Presidential administration, succeeding Miron Agrba. On 18 June 2004, Gagulia resigned from his post, stating \\"There is a certain scenario to the presidential elections in Abkhazia. I don't match this scenario and thus I prefer to step down.\\" It had been suggested that Ardzinba may have also favoured Gagulia to replace him as President, but Ardzinba instead decided to back then-Prime Minister Raul Khajimba. On 24 June 2004, Gagulia was again appointed head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Abkhazia, succeeding Yuri Aqaba. Gagulia remained in that position until April 2018. Third Term as Prime Minister (2018) Gagulia was reappointed Prime Minister of Abkhazia in April 2018 by President Raul Khajimba, replacing Beslan Bartsits. Death Gagulia was killed in a car accident outside the village of Myussera, Gudauta District on 8 September 2018. He was returning from Sochi International Airport following a 3-day visit with Khajimba to Syria, which was one of the few countries that recognized Abkhazia's independence, and where a large Circassian and Abkhaz minority lives. He also met Bashar al-Assad there. A car collided with the convoy, and the impact forced Gagulia's car into the ditch. The car was driven by a 22-year-old Abkhaz man, who was, according to local authorities, \\"under the influence of narcotics\\". He died on the spot. Two others, Gagulia's bodyguard and a driver, were injured in the crash. Khajimba, who was travelling in the same convoy and witnessed the crash, suggested it was not an assassination attempt or terrorism, but rather an accident.

Author Mike Conroy has described Mephisto as \\"the tempter who could offer the endlessly soul-tormented Silver Surfer the world, even dangling the Surfer's off-limits long-distance lover in front of him. As always the case with Lee's heroes, the Surfer's goodness and nobility won out, but Mephisto was only stymied, not defeated, and the pattern was set.\\"Conroy, Mike. 500 Comicbook Villains, Collins & Brown, 2004.

The plan consisted of monthly payments which assured benefits of medical and hospital care to over two thousand employees of Los Angeles County and the Department of Water and Power and their families. The founders believed that health care could be improved by combining prepayment of services, eliminating the financial barriers faced by patients at the time of needed care, with the sharing of medical records and the ease of consultation in a medical group. The focus was on the improvement of medical care quality, rather than financial success, and many concepts in those plans built on a public health approach that encouraged prevention. The plans included prenatal care, well-baby visits, and immunizations in standard benefit packages, with small or zero co-payments, at a time that even the hospital costs of maternity stays were often excluded from traditional insurance. Ross-Loos Medical Group (1929) is the first HMO in the United States, the term \\"managed care\\" came about chiefly through the influence of U.S. President Nixon on February 17, 1971. Over several years many other employee groups, mostly governmental, joined the plan. Ross-Loos was so successful that the first small medical office on Grand Avenue in Los Angeles expanded into an enormous organization with 29 medical offices and a large multi-specialty hospital, on Temple Street, Los Angeles, by 1979. Purchases In 1980, Ross-Loos Medical Group was purchased by the Insurance Company of North America (INA) HealthPlan (see HMO International and California Medical Group and merged into its medical office operations which created over twenty-nine medical office locations throughout southern California. Its new name was \\"INA and Ross-Loos HealthPlans\\". This new operational name was in existence a short time until 1982; through a merger of the Insurance Company of North America (INA) and Connecticut General (CG) their names changed to become CIGNA. Ross-Loos Medical Group, became known as CIGNA HealthPlans of Southern California and was merged into the large CIGNA Employee Benefits Division. In 1997 CIGNA made a decision to divest itself of its \\"owned delivery system\\" or \\"staff model\\" (see HMO – staff model) and sold their operations to MedPartners. The sale to MedPartners also caused a new name change of the CIGNA \\"owned delivery system\\" in Southern California, The system became merged into the recent purchase in Southern California by Medpartners of the Friendly Hills Medical Group. In 1999, MedPartners was placed in receivership for its inability to manage the combined operations of its Southern California subsidiaries Friendly Hills Medical Group, Talbert Medical Group, Mullikan Medical Group, Vineyard Medical Group, and Riverside Medical Clinic. Those MedPartners-owned facilities were divested and sold to physician-owned delivery systems or closed. The MedPartners name was changed to Caremark Rx, the Talbert Medical Group was sold to the physicians of the Talbert Medical Group; the Riverside Medical Clinic was sold back to the member physicians, remaining in operation, with over 130 physicians; and the Mullikan and Vineyard Medical Groups were eventually closed. The Friendly Hills Medical Group was acquired by KPC Global Care, now in Chadhuri Medical Group, and briefly continued operations until it too was placed into receivership by the California Department of Corporations in 1999 and closed down. The original Ross-Loos Medical Group facilities were closed and Medical Center - Hospital on Temple Street in Los Angeles was sold to Silverlake Medical Center then eventually sold and renamed L.A. Downtown Medical Center. The original Ross-Loos Medical Group, medical offices and hospital ended with that sale in 1999 some 70 years after its beginning. Current status The names \\"Ross-Loos\\", \\"Ross Loos Medical Group\\", and \\"Ross Loos HealthPlans\\" are still owned by CIGNA Corporation and remain registered with the State of California Department of Corporations, Department of Insurance, and Department of Managed Care. A street in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles bears the name Ross Loos Place. The road leads to the Medical Center.

It runs between U.S. Route 101 near Santa Margarita and Interstate 15 in Barstow. It has junctions with Interstate 5 near Buttonwillow, State Route 99 in Bakersfield, State Route 202 in Tehachapi, State Route 14 near Mojave, and U.S. Route 395 at Kramer Junction. SR 58 also provides access to Edwards Air Force Base. At various points it is known as the Calf Canyon Highway, Carrisa Highway, Bakersfield-McKittrick Highway, Rosa Parks Highway, Rosedale Highway, Barstow-Bakersfield Highway, Kern County Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, and Mojave-Barstow Highway. Route description Spring Wildflowers off SR 58 near California Valley, CA, 2010 State Route 58 between Santa Margarita and Buttonwillow is a winding mountain road through a thinly populated area. From its westernmost terminus at US 101 near Santa Margarita, a few miles north of San Luis Obispo, SR 58 heads east along the former US 101 (El Camino Real) for one mile. SR 58 then heads east and up the winding mountain road, passing through a thinly populated area and an intersection with SR 229. Alternatives such as SR 46 to the north or SR 166 to the south are recommended, as much of this section of SR 58 is prohibited to truck traffic. However, this section of SR 58 does pass through the Carrizo Plain, which is known for its scenic beauty and geological features, including the San Andreas Fault. SR 58 then takes another winding road before joining with State Route 33 (SR 33) in the small town of McKittrick. SR 33 then splits at the north end of McKittrick before SR 58 then enters another, but brief winding road. SR 58 then proceeds northeast for several miles before changing to an east-west alignment and reaching Buttonwillow. A few miles later, SR 58 has an interchange with Interstate 5 (I-5). Approximately east of I-5, SR 58 briefly joins SR 43 before continuing east and eventually reaching the Bakersfield city limits. State Route 58 joins State Route 99 for about through Bakersfield before splitting as a freeway and heading east. SR 58 briefly enters expressway status with two at-grade intersections in the Caliente area before resuming freeway status east of Caliente. SR 58 then reaches the Tehachapi city limits and traverses the Tehachapi Pass before dropping out of the Tehachapi Mountains into the Antelope Valley at the town of Mojave. Shortly after an interchange with State Route 14, SR 58 reverts to an expressway east of Mojave before resuming freeway status bypassing North Edwards, Edwards Air Force Base, Boron, and Kramer Junction. Approximately east of an interchange with U.S. Route 395, SR 58 resumes expressway status with two lanes in each direction until just before reaching the easternmost terminus at Interstate 15 in Barstow. State Route 58 is a freeway from its south junction with SR 99 in Bakersfield (the West Bakersfield Interchange) to several miles east of Mojave (a freeway bypass of Mojave was completed in 2004), except for two at-grade intersections apart in the Caliente area. There is another at-grade intersection east of Mojave and west of the main Edwards AFB north gate exit where California City Boulevard intersects it. Other freeway segments are bypasses of Boron, Kramer Junction (a freeway bypass of Kramer and Kramer Junction was completed in 2019), and Barstow. Except for the Boron-Kramer Junction freeway bypass, SR 58 is primarily a four-lane expressway (two lanes per direction) from just east of Kramer Junction up to the Barstow bypass segment. State Route 58 takes the southernmost route through the Sierra Nevada and allows motorists to travel between Northern California and points to the east, such as Las Vegas and Interstate 40, without having to face the extreme traffic congestion of greater Los Angeles. State Route 58 and Interstate 80 are the only freeways to cross the Sierra Nevada. The route also offers an alternative to the often treacherous Donner Pass to truckers traveling from the San Francisco Bay Area to points eastward; prior to the construction of Interstate 80, the road (as U.S. Route 466) was heavily used for this purpose. SR 58 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and east of I-5 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 58 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. SR 58 has several names throughout its length, including the Blue Star Memorial Highway (for its entire length); the Kern County Korean War Veterans Memorial Highway, for the section from SR 184 to the Kern County/San Bernardino County Line; and the Rosa Parks Highway, for the section between SR 99 and SR 184. The Korean War Veterans name honors the approximately 8,120 veterans from Kern County, while the section named for Rosa Parks honors the civil rights activist. The portion of SR 58 from Barstow to Bakersfield is sometimes referred to as the Barstow–Bakersfield Highway. History Westbound 58 in the Temblor Range, descending into the Carrizo Plain A truck passes eastbound along the busy Highway 58 through the Antelope Valley. The Tehachapi Mountains are visible in the distance. State Route 58 did not exist as a California sign route until 1964, although previous to 1964, it was part of California Legislative Route 58. The other part of Legislative Route 58 is California's segment of Interstate 40; previous to 1964 it was a segment of US 66. Prior to 1964 the segment of State Route 58 between Bakersfield and Barstow was signed U.S. Route 466. Also at that time, the segment of SR 58 between State Route 33 at McKittrick and State Route 99 in Bakersfield was signed as State Route 178. Although it was proposed for signing as Route 178 in 1934, the segment of Legislative Route 58 between US 101 near Santa Margarita and State Route 33 at McKittrick was not signed prior to 1964. Note that US 466 was co-signed with US 99, now State Route 99, between Bakersfield and Famoso Junction. Between Famoso and US 101 at Paso Robles, US 466 largely became SR 46. The eastern terminus was originally at I-15 in northeastern Barstow. SR 58 was rerouted to I-15 in Barstow south of the I-40 interchange. The former eastern terminus is now known as \\"Old Highway 58.\\" Future  Extending I-40 westward to I-5: the missing link  California has long sought federal funds for an extension of Interstate 40 west of Barstow; any such extension would use the general path of SR 58, if not existing highway, at least as far west as Bakersfield, whose rapid growth has made it a significant generator of traffic in its own right. The desired highway is being built piecemeal as Caltrans has funds available, at least between Mojave and Barstow. Two at-grade intersections within of each other around mile 76, roughly halfway between Bakersfield and Mojave (Bealeville Road and California State Route 223), would have to be either closed or upgraded to interchanges for the whole of SR 58 to be up to Interstate standards. Caltrans has built bypasses of Mojave and Barstow up to Interstate standards. In the Kramer Junction area, Caltrans planned to realign and widen a 13.3-mile segment of State Route 58 from 0.4 miles west of the Kern/San Bernardino County line to a point approximately 7.5 miles east of Kramer Junction from a two-lane conventional highway to a four-lane expressway, and construct an interchange at the SR 58/US 395 junction to replace the then at-grade junction of SR 58 and US 395 in Kramer Junction. A groundbreaking ceremony for the Kramer Junction Expressway was held on January 19, 2018. The bypass was opened to traffic on October 24, 2019. In western Bakersfield, the Westside Parkway, a freeway running from the intersection of Heath Road and Stockdale Highway east to Truxtun Avenue, was completed on April 15, 2015, with interchanges in between at Allen Road, Calloway Drive, Coffee Road, and Mohawk Street. Opening in stages since 2013, the road is currently under the jurisdiction of the city of Bakersfield. As part of the Centennial Corridor project, Caltrans is building an eastern extension of the Westside Parkway to the current junction of highways 58 and 99 at the West Bakersfield Interchange, but construction has been controversial since it displaced dozens of homes and businesses; by September 2017, all but a few buildings in the path had been demolished. Once the connection to Highway 99 is completed (which is expected to occur in 2022), Highway 58 will then be rerouted onto Stockdale Highway and the Westside Parkway (and the city will transfer the latter's jurisdiction to Caltrans), with later plans to upgrade Stockdale Highway from Heath Road west to Interstate 5 as a freeway. The San Luis Obispo Planning Commission is considering a permit application for the California Valley Solar Ranch and has released a Draft Environmental Impact Report with a public comment period closure date November 1, 2010. Among the points raised in the DEIR is the aesthetic impact on the viewshed which would be particularly troublesome if large industrial scale arrays of solar panels are placed north of Route 58 in the section of road just east of Soda Lake Road. Business loops Mojave State Route 58 Business is a business route of California State Route 58 in Mojave. It provides access to downtown Mojave as Mojave-Barstow Highway. It also follows mostly the former routing of U.S. Route 466. Tehachapi State Route 58 Business is a business route of California State Route 58 in Tehachapi. It provides access to downtown Tehachapi as Tehachapi Boulevard. It also follows the former routing of U.S. Route 466 and is overlapped with State Route 202. Boron State Route 58 Business is a business route of California State Route 58 in Boron. It provides access to downtown Boron as Twenty Mule Team Road. It also follows the former routing of U.S. Route 466. It is signed from westbound Route 58 approaching the San Bernardino–Kern county line and the beginning of the Boron bypass. Major intersections Westside Parkway (Future SR 58) This exit list consists of the Bakersfield city-maintained freeway that will eventually become part of SR 58. All exits are unnumbered.

It was built to house the remains of Ali Hujwiri, commonly known as Data Ganj Baksh, a Sufi saint from Ghazni in present-day Afghanistan, who is believed to have lived on the site in the 11th century CE. The site is considered to be the most sacred place in Lahore, and attracts up to one million visitors to its annual urs festival. Location Data Darbar is located in the centre of Old City Lahore. Surrounding it are Lower Mall Road, Bhati Gate, Gawalmandi & Karbala Gamay Shah. History The shrine was originally established as a simple grave next to the mosque which Hujwiri had built on the outskirts of Lahore in the 11th century. By the 13th century, the belief that the spiritual powers of great Sufi saints were attached to their burial sites was widespread in the Muslim world, and so a larger shrine was built to commemorate the burial site of Hujwiri during the Mughal period. The shrine complex was expanded in the 19th century, and Hujwiri's mosque rebuilt.left The shrine came under Pakistani government control as part of the Auquf Ordinance of 1960, with the official aim of preventing shrine caretakers throughout the country from financially exploiting devotees. The shrine was greatly expanded in the 1980s under the rule of military dictator Zia ul-Haq, during which time the shrine became the largest in South Asia. Offices for NGOs, a library, madrasa, police station, carpark, and offices were all added under his regime. Designated spaces for musical performances, and new free kitchen were also added during that time. New markets have emerged around the site since its massive expansion. Since 1965, the mehfil-e-sama, a 2-day qawwali music festival, had been held adjacent to the shrine, which in 1992 shifted to a nearby school.  Terror attacks  On 2010, two suicide bombers attacked the shrine. At least 50 people were killed, and 200 others were hurt in the blasts. On 8 May, 2019, another blast at the same site killed twelve people included police officials Saddam Hussain, Head Constable Shahid Nazir, Head Constable Muhammad Sohail, Head Constable Gulzar Ahmad, Constable Muhammad Saleem, and security guard Rafaqat Ali near the entrance gate for female visitors.  Architecture  left The shrine of Hujwiri is housed in a Mughal era tomb crafted of carved white marble. The tomb is surrounded by a massive marble courtyard, while a new educational institution at the shrine complex utilizes modernist architecture. Significance The site is considered to be the most sacred place in Lahore. The shrine has emerged a major economic, political, and social centre in Lahore, and is one of the only places in Lahore where the extremely rich and extremely poor share space together. It is widely believed among devotees that the saint interred at the shrine is the supreme authority over all Sufi saints in the Indian subcontinent, and that no new Sufi saint could immigrate to the subcontinent without obtaining permission from the spirit of Hujwiri. Following the establishment of a shrine dedicated to Hujwiri, his tomb was visited by Muslims and non-Muslims in search of his blessings. Illustrious figures such as Baba Farid, Moinuddin Chishti, Nizamuddin Auliya, Dara Shikoh, and Allama Iqbal all paid obeisance to the shrine, and pledged allegiance to Hujwiri. Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was a frequent visitor to the shrine. Hujwiri's teachings were critical of practices associated with South Asian Islam, such as the use of drugs, and dancing. He also taught that Sufi saints were themselves still obliged to the demands of Islam, and so is revered by reformist Muslims who are critical of Sufi practice, as well as traditionalist Muslims who revere Sufi shrines. Qawwali performances are regularly held at the shrine. On special occasions, the shrine is decorated with lights, dinner is prepared for thousands of visitors, who also partake in dance while musicians play Sufi music for hours. At the boundary of the shrine, Muslim faithfuls recite the Qur'an, and pay tributes to the Prophet Muhammad. Social services The shrine provides a wide array of social services which have made it a popular hub for impoverished residents. In a custom that is 1,000 years old, up to 50,000 visitors per day are offered free food at the shrine. Patrons facing personal difficulties frequently donate money or labour to the shrine's free-kitchen fund, in line with Islam's emphasis on feeding the poor. The shrine also provides for students' education in nearby schools, and helps fund local hospitals as part of its social mission. Access The shrine remains open at all hours, and welcomes visitors who freely enter the complex. The shrine is visited by approximately 30,000 to 60,000 visitors on a daily basis, though the number can double on religious holidays, and on Thursdays  the traditional night for visiting shrines. Approximately 1,000,000 devotees visit the shrine during its annual urs festival. The shrine is served by the Bhatti Chowk station of the Lahore Metrobus. Administration The shrine is managed as part of an Auqaf foundation as part of the Auqaf Ordinance of 1960. The shrine is managed by approximately 200 full-time workers, excluding security services. The shrine produces the most revenue for the Auqaf board out of all the some 400 shrines under its control in Punjab province, and contributes approximately 33% of the board's revenue. The shrine collects 4 times more income than is spent on the shrine's upkeep. Considered to be the centre of all shrines in Punjab, religious practices and sermons are subject to more government regulation than at other shrines in Pakistan.

It was intended as a catalyst for analysis of a new cipher structure, known as Generalized Unbalanced Feistel Networks (GUFNs). The cryptanalysis proceeded very quickly, so quickly that the cipher was broken at the same workshop by Vincent Rijmen and Bart Preneel. The algorithm Schneier and Blaze based MacGuffin on DES, their main change being that the data block is not split into equal halves in the Feistel network. Instead, 48 bits of the 64-bit data block are fed through the round function, whose output is XORed with the other 16 bits of the data block. The algorithm was experimental, intended to explore the security properties of unbalanced Feistel networks. The adjacent diagram shows one round of MacGuffin. The 64-bit data block is broken into four 16-bit words (each represented by one line). The rightmost three are XORed with subkey bits derived from the secret key. They are then fed through eight S-boxes, each of which takes six bits of input and produces two bits of output. The output (a total of 16 bits) is then recombined and XORed with the leftmost word of the data block. The new leftmost block is then rotated into the rightmost position of the resulting data block. The algorithm then continues with more rounds. MacGuffin's key schedule is a modified version of the encryption algorithm itself. Since MacGuffin is a Feistel network, decryption is easy; simply run the encryption algorithm in reverse. Schneier and Blaze recommended using 32 rounds, and specified MacGuffin with a 128-bit key. Cryptanalysis of MacGuffin At the same workshop where MacGuffin was introduced, Rijmen and Preneel showed that it was vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis. They showed that 32 rounds of MacGuffin is weaker than 16 rounds of DES, since it took \\"a few hours\\" to get good differential characteristics for DES with good starting values, and the same time to get good differential characteristics for MacGuffin with no starting values. They found that it is possible to get the last round key with differential cryptanalysis, and from that reverse the last round and repeat the attack for the rest of the rounds. Rijmen and Preneel tried attacking MacGuffin with different S-boxes, taken directly from DES. This version proved to be slightly stronger, but they warn that designing an algorithm to resist only known attacks is generally not a good design principle.

Thayil (born September 4, 1960) is an American musician best known as the lead guitarist of the Seattle-based rock band Soundgarden, which he cofounded with singer Chris Cornell and bassist Hiro Yamamoto in 1984. Thayil was named the 100th greatest guitarist of all time by Rolling Stone in 2010, and the 67th greatest guitarist of all time by SPIN in 2012. Thayil has won 2 Grammy Awards as a member of Soundgarden. Biography Childhood and early life Born in Seattle in 1960, Thayil grew up in the Chicago suburb of Park Forest. His parents came from the state of Kerala in India to Seattle. His father Boniface Thayil earned a degree in chemical engineering, received employment in Chicago and moved there with his family. Thayil started writing lyrics at 12 years old. In 1977, he formed his first band in Chicago, Bozo And The Pinheads, a punk rock band. They did both original songs (written by Thayil and inspired by his punk music tastes) and cover tunes (mostly the Sex Pistols, Devo and the Ramones). Their first gig was at a school talent show for an audience of about 500 people. He played guitar in a post-punk band called Identity Crisis in 1980, and released a 7\\" inch EP called \\"Pretty Feet\\". Thayil met Hiro Yamamoto at Rich East High School in Park Forest. He graduated, along with Hiro Yamamoto and Bruce Pavitt, from the Active Learning Process School (ALPS) at Rich East High School in 1981. He and Yamamoto decided to move to Olympia, Washington, to study at The Evergreen State College, but they were unable to find jobs and decided to move to Seattle. There, Thayil earned money as a DJ for KCMU and earned a degree in philosophy at the University of Washington. In Seattle they also met Chris Cornell, a roommate, and the three formed Soundgarden in 1984. Soundgarden (1984–1997) Soundgarden became the first of Seattle's grunge bands to sign with a major label (A&M; Records). They went on to release five albums, including three which went platinum at least once, and won two Grammys. Thayil became acclaimed for his guitar work, which was typically characterized by heavy riffing, and was cited among other grunge guitarists as an influence and a pioneer of the \\"Seattle Sound.\\" In 1994, Thayil commented, \\"I think Soundgarden is a pretty good band and I'm a fine guitarist. I'm not God, but I'm certainly not average. I feel very comfortable with the fact that not many other people can do what I do on guitar. I think my guitar is happy with the way I play it.\\" Originally one of Soundgarden's main songwriters, Thayil's contributions as a writer eventually dwindled to just one song on Down on the Upside, \\"Never the Machine Forever\\", although he contributed to details in every song, as did every band member. Thayil explained that \\"Collaboration was paramount in our early music, especially right at the beginning when it was me on guitar, Hiro on bass and Chris on drums,\\" but eventually all four members became songwriters of their own, \\"all writing guitar parts that I had to learn.\\" This led him to do \\"Never the Machine Forever\\" all on his own, as Thayil thought \\"Well, if I'm going to have a song on this fucking record, I'm going to have to write lyrics.\\" While a member of Soundgarden, he has written the following songs for the band: * \\"Hunted Down\\" (Screaming Life) ... music * \\"Nothing to Say\\" (Screaming Life) ... music * \\"Tears To Forget\\" (Screaming Life) ... music (co-written) * \\"Little Joe\\" (Screaming Life) ... music * \\"Hand of God\\" (Screaming Life) ... music * \\"Kingdom of Come\\" (Fopp) ... credited to Soundgarden * \\"Flower\\" (Ultramega OK) ... music * \\"All Your Lies\\" (Ultramega OK) ... music (co-written) * \\"Circle of Power\\" (Ultramega OK) ... music * \\"Incessant Mace\\" (Ultramega OK) ... music * \\"Hands All Over\\" (Louder Than Love) ... music * \\"Get on the Snake\\" (Louder Than Love) ... music * \\"Heretic\\" (Loudest Love) ... music * \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" (Badmotorfinger) ... music (co- written) * \\"Room a Thousand Years Wide\\" (Badmotorfinger) ... lyrics * \\"New Damage\\" (Badmotorfinger) ... music (co-written) * \\"My Wave\\" (Superunknown) ... music (co-written) * \\"Superunknown\\" (Superunknown) ... music (co-written) * \\"Limo Wreck\\" (Superunknown) ... music (co-written) * \\"Kickstand\\" (Superunknown) ... music * \\"Never the Machine Forever\\" (Down on the Upside) ... music and lyrics * \\"Black Rain\\" (Telephantasm) ...music (co-written) * \\"Non-State Actor\\" (King Animal) ...lyrics (co-written) * \\"By Crooked Steps\\" (King Animal) ...music (co-written) * \\"A Thousand Days Before\\" (King Animal) ...music * \\"Blood on the Valley Floor\\" (King Animal) ...music Post- Soundgarden (1997–2010) Thayil joined singer Johnny Cash, bassist Krist Novoselic of Nirvana and drummer Sean Kinney of Alice in Chains for a cover of Willie Nelson's \\"Time of the Preacher\\", featured on the tribute album Twisted Willie, released in January 1996. After the 1997 breakup of Soundgarden, Thayil went on to contribute guitar to work by Pigeonhed and Presidents of the United States of America. More recently, he contributed guitar to the track \\"Blood Swamp\\" from the 2006 Sunn O)))/Boris album Altar, for which he also wrote liner notes. Thayil also plays lead guitar on a track called \\"V.O.G.\\" by Ascend, which features Gentry Densley (Iceburn, Eagle Twin) and Greg Anderson (Sunn O))), Engine Kid, Goatsnake). Ascend's record, titled Ample Fire Within, was released in 2008 by Southern Lord Records. In 1999, Thayil formed a punk band, the No WTO Combo, with Jello Biafra (formerly of Dead Kennedys), Krist Novoselic (formerly of Nirvana, at the time a member of Sweet 75), and Gina Mainwal (also of Sweet 75). The band was formed to celebrate and further the rampant protest activity against the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999, which was held on November 30, 1999. Originally scheduled to play at The Showbox on that same evening, police prevented the band from doing so, forcing the show to be rescheduled for the following night. This was Thayil's first live concert since the breakup of Soundgarden. The show was recorded by Mark Cavener and mixed by Soundgarden producer Jack Endino; it was released as the album Live from the Battle in Seattle in May 2000. In 2003, Rolling Stone magazine named Thayil #100 on the list of the \\"100 greatest guitarists of all time\\".Fricke, David; Edmonds, Ben; Eliscu, Jenny; Kemp, Rob; Kot, Greg; Levy, Joe; Moon, Tom; Puterbaugh, Parke; Randall, Mac; Sheffield, Rob (18 September 2003) \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\" Rolling Stone Issue 931, pp. 46-61. The list was posted to the Internet on 27 August 2003 In 2004, Thayil played guitar for Probot, Dave Grohl's heavy metal side-project; he was featured on the songs \\"Ice Cold Man\\" and \\"Sweet Dreams.\\" Thayil was a recurring participant on the Almost Live! sketch comedy show, calling things \\"lame\\" during \\"The Lame List\\" segments. In 2009, Thayil played with Soundgarden's Matt Cameron and Ben Shepherd at a show in Seattle on March 24, 2009 at the Crocodile Cafe that was headlined by Tom Morello's The Nightwatchman. It was the first time the three had played together in public since the band's 1997 breakup. The three were joined by Tad Doyle of fellow 1990s Seattle band TAD, and performed three Soundgarden songs. For the last song (Spoonman) they were joined by Tom Morello (Morello had played the song before with Audioslave). Thayil has also played with Greg Gilmore of Mother Love Bone and Danny Kelly of Heliotroupe in the group Set & Setting. Their debut performance was October 31, 2009 above the famed K Records warehouse now known as the Cherry Street Loft (\\"The Loft on Cherry\\") in Olympia, Washington. Soundgarden reunion (2010–2018) On January 1, 2010, it was announced through Facebook and Twitter posts by Chris Cornell that the official Soundgarden fanclub had been restarted. On April 15, 2010, it was announced that Soundgarden would play its first show since 1997 the following day at the Showbox at the Market in its Seattle hometown. The band played under the name 'Nudedragons', an anagram for Soundgarden. On August 5, 2010 the band played their first reunion show under the Soundgarden name at The Vic Theatre in Chicago. Three days later, on August 8, 2010, they headlined the final night of Lollapalooza in Grant Park. In September 2010, the band released the compilation album Telephantasm. November 2012 saw the release of King Animal, their first studio album since 1996. In 2012, Thayil voiced a character in Season IV: Church of the Black Klok's \\"Dethcamp\\" in the Adult Swim original series Metalocalypse. On May 18, 2017, Chris Cornell was found dead in his hotel room, cancelling the rest of their tour and the band was disbanded again in 2018, with the exception of their one-off show of Tribute to Chris Cornell in January 2019. In March 2018, it was announced that original member of the proto punk band MC5, Wayne Kramer would embark on a 35 date tour of North America for their 50th anniversary of the band's debut Kick Out the Jams recruiting Thayil to play guitar along with Brendan Canty of Fugazi, Doug Pinnick of King's X, and Marcus Durant of Zen Guerilla.

T. Selbit (1881–1938) was an English magician, inventor and writer who is credited with being the first person to perform the illusion of sawing a woman in half. Among magicians he was known for his inventiveness and entrepreneurial instinct and he is credited with creating a long list of successful stage illusions. Early life and career His birth name was Percy Thomas Tibbles and he was born in Hampstead, London. He developed an interest in magic in his youth, when he was apprenticed to a silversmith. The basement of the silversmith's shop was leased to magician and inventor Charles Morritt who used it to develop new tricks and the young Tibbles would sneak in to study these when Morritt was away. Tibbles began doing a coin and card manipulation act under the stage name P. T. Selbit, which he created by spelling his last name backwards and dropping one of the \\"B\\"s. He also used Selbit as a pen name, working as a journalist for a theatrical paper, writing a magic handbook and editing a trade journal for magicians. Between 1902 and 1908, Selbit worked in music halls under the name Joad Heteb. He had deduced audiences wanted something that seemed exotic so he donned greasepaint, robes and a wig to perform as a \\"pseudo-Egyptian\\" character. This episode reflects two characteristics that marked much of his magic career: inventive ability and an entrepreneurial desire to keep pulling in audiences with something new. In 1910 Selbit toured with an illusion titled \\"Spirit Paintings\\", in which audience members were asked to name an artist and then pictures in the style of that artist mysteriously appeared on illuminated canvases. His next tour featured a trick called \\"The Mighty Cheese\\", in which audience members were invited to try to tip over a huge circular model of a cheese wheel, which they found impossible to do because it contained a gyroscope. In 1912 Selbit began working for Maskelyne and Devant, who had come to dominate the business of magic shows in Britain with their productions at the Egyptian Hall and St George's Hall. Selbit's first role with Maskelyne and Devant was to tour music halls and American vaudeville during 1912 and 1913 presenting Devant's \\"Window of a Haunted House\\" illusion. In 1914 Selbit introduced the \\"Walking through a Wall\\" illusion at St. George's Hall. In 1919, Selbit staged a séance at his own flat in Bloomsbury. The spiritualist Arthur Conan Doyle who attended the séance was unaware of the trickery and declared the clairvoyance manifestations to be genuine.Baker, Robert A. (1996). Hidden Memories: Voices and Visions from Within. Prometheus Books. p. 234. Christopher, Milbourne. (1996). The Illustrated History of Magic. Greentrwood Publishing Group. p. 264. Correspondence with Harry Houdini Selbit had performed an illusion known as \\"Walking Through a Brick Wall\\" at St. George's Hall, London in 1913. The American magician Harry Houdini had performed the illusion a year later at Hammerstein's Roof Garden in New York, 1914.Steinmeyer, Jim. (2003). Hiding the Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible. Arrow Books. p. 281 Friends of Selbit in England stated that Houdini had originally observed Selbit perform the illusion in London and had stolen it as his own. Houdini responded by claiming that he had purchased the rights from the owner of the illusion, Sidney Josolyne.Price, David. (1985). Magic: A Pictorial History of Conjurers in the Theater. Cornwall Books. p. 198Silverman, Kenneth. (1996). Houdini!: The Career of Ehrich Weiss. HarperCollins Publishers. pp. 193-194Randi, James; Sugar, Bert Randolph. (1976). Houdini, His Life and Art. Grosset & Dunlap. p. 97 Selbit rejected the claims of Josolyne and stated that he was the originator of the illusion, this caused dispute with Houdini.\\"When Houdini Walked Through a Brick Wall\\". Retrieved 31 May 2016. In Selbit's illusion, an attractive young lady went through the wall. This was different than Houdini's illusion as he had gone through the wall himself.Christopher, Milbourne. (1998). Houdini. Gramercy Books. p. 154 The illusion worked by use of a trapdoor that went underneath the wall.Gibson, Walter B; Young, Morris N. (1953). Houdini on Magic. Dover Publications. p. 222. Sawing through a woman P. T. Selbit performing the sawing a woman in half illusion. There are many versions of the illusion of sawing through a woman or sawing a woman in half as well as other illusions that are based around that theme. There remains a debate as to the exact origins of the idea, with some suggesting there is a record of it from 1809 or that the idea can be traced back to ancient Egypt. Modern magic inventor Jim Steinmeyer has written that a description of the illusion was published by the great French magician Jean Robert-Houdin in 1858, but Robert-Houdin's idea remained just that, a written description of an effect. Selbit is generally recognised as the first magician to perform such a trick on a public stage, which he did at the Finsbury Park Empire theatre in London on 17 January 1921.Venue info from \\"Violent Magic\\", episode 6 of the BBC television documentary series Magic first broadcast in 2004 In fact, Selbit had previously performed the illusion in December 1920 before a select audience of promoters and theatrical agents at the St. George's Hall to try to persuade one of them to book him to perform it. In Selbit's version a female assistant got into a wooden box that was similar in proportion to a coffin but slightly larger. She was secured there by ropes around her wrists, ankles and neck. The box was then closed, obscuring her from view. After the box was placed in a horizontal position, Selbit sawed through the middle of it with a large hand saw. The impression given to the audience was that, because of the restraints and limited room in the box, the assistant's waist must have been in the path of the saw and she would surely have been cut through. Finally the box was opened and the assistant, still with ropes attached, was revealed as unharmed. The impact of the illusion was immense and Selbit became a box office hit. Jim Steinmeyer attributes the success and influence of the illusion not just to Selbit's inventiveness but also to his timing. By 1920 the world was tiring of older styles of magic. The changes to the public psyche wrought by the trauma of the First World War together with rapid social and technological change meant that the time was right for a new and shocking style of magic. The sawing illusion was pivotal in creating the cliché of the pretty female assistant subjected to torture and mutilation by magicians. Before Selbit, male and female assistants had both been used in illusions. In Victorian times the bulky nature of female clothes often precluded the use of a female assistant in illusions which required a performer to get into a confined space. By 1920, fashions had changed and it became not only acceptable but desirable to have a cast of attractive women displaying shapely limbs. Steinmeyer has noted that, \\"beyond practical concerns, the image of the woman in peril became a specific fashion in entertainment\\". Other magicians rapidly attempted to emulate and improve upon Selbit's trick. Within months, American magician Horace Goldin presented a version in which the assistant's head, hands and feet were seen in full view throughout the trick. Goldin was aggressive in the use of legal measures to try to prevent anyone from competing with him. When Selbit arrived in America to tour with his sawing illusion he found that Goldin had registered many possible titles for the act with the Vaudeville Managers' Protective Agency. Selbit was thus forced to bill his act as \\"The Divided Woman\\", which had less dramatic impact than the idea of sawing through a woman. Selbit tried to sue Goldin for stealing his idea but the action failed when it was ruled that Goldin's illusion was sufficiently different. The sawing illusion went through many developments after Selbit and other performers achieved fame and great commercial success for particular variants. Goldin later produced sawing illusions that dispensed with a covering box and ultimately used a large buzzsaw. Another variant, which owed something to Selbit's original, has been attributed to Alan Wakeling. However Selbit retains his place in history as the first to present a sawing trick, and thus as a figure who shaped popular perceptions of stage illusions for decades. Revival In the 1990s, the renowned English magician Paul Daniels performed an homage to Selbit on his television series Secrets. Describing the origins of the trick, Daniels performs the sawing a woman in half illusion in its original form, in the style of Selbit, also including Selbit's development of using panes of glass, giving the effect that the woman also has her head and legs cut off and her body cut in half vertically. Subsequent career and illusions Following his court battles in America, which effectively prevented him achieving the same level of success there as he had in Britain, Selbit returned home in 1922. He turned his attention to developing new illusions in the hope of creating something that would repeat the impact of sawing. He is credited with devising Girl/Man without a Middle (1924), Through the Eye of a Needle (1924), The Million Dollar Mystery, Stretching a Girl, and Avoiding the Crush, Selbit's Blocks and possibly also the Siberian Chain Escape. Although some effects were highly ingenious and several were sufficiently successful that they continued to be performed by subsequent generations of magicians, none achieved the fame of sawing. In 1928 Selbit went to the aid of Morritt, the magician from whom he had surreptitiously learned so much at the start of his career. Morritt had been arrested and charged with \\"obtaining money under false pretences\\" as the result of a misunderstanding over the way he was scraping a living from an act titled \\"Man in a Trance\\". Selbit and Will Goldston helped to fund Morritt's defence and he was eventually acquitted.

The company was listed in The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. The company was a media and property conglomerate until it was dismantled in 2002. After selling the main media business and subsequent takeover in mid-2002, the legal person of the listed company, along with its property business, was renamed into Shanghai Ming Yuan Holdings. Sing Tao Holdings and its predecessor Sing Tao Limited were majority owned by founder Aw Boon Haw, his daughter Sally Aw and other family members for almost 50 years. Facing financial troubles, Sally Aw sold the controlling stake to a private equity fund of Lazard in 1999. It was then acquired by Charles Ho's listed company Global China Technology Group in January 2001. However, in mid-2002 it was re-sold to a Chinese private company Ming Yuan Investment Group, but excluding Sing Tao's main business: newspaper (as Sing Tao Media Holdings) as well as a hotel in Canada. In February 2020, the wholly owned subsidiary in Australia was liquidated with over 20 long serving staff made unemployed without notice and their entitlements not paid by the company. Newsagents were pursued for unsold newspapers and not credited for returns. Around 1991, the group also owned a travel agency, a medical centre, a recording studio and a pharmaceutical company. History Predecessor =A family-held publisher= The predecessor of Sing Tao Holdings as a parent company of Sing Tao Group, was Sing Tao Limited, which was incorporated on 22 October 1951 as Sin Poh Amalgamated (H.K.) Limited. It replaced \\"Sing Tao Jih Pao Limited\\" as the parent company of the group, which the latter was incorporated on 29 June 1938. It was renamed to Sing Tao Newspapers Limited on 27 May 1972 and Sing Tao Limited on 13 February 1986.Filings in Hong Kong Companies Registry At first, the main business of the company was the publisher of Sing Tao Daily () and Sing Tao Wan Pao (). According to the Annual Return filed to the Hong Kong Company Registries in 1952, Aw Boon Haw owned 630 out of 1500 shares of the company; other shareholders were his sons (Aw Kow () 60; Aw Swan (), 60; Aw It Haw () 100; Aw Sze Haw () 100), daughters (Sally Aw and Aw Sing () 60 each), nephews (Aw Cheng Chye (), and Aw Cheng Taik (), 60 each) and grandson, daughters and third generation relatives (total 310 shares held by 9 persons), for a total of 18 persons. , son of Aw Boon Haw, who helped the family to found Sing Tao Daily, died in January 1951 due to a plane crash. The shareholder structure also making other newspapers that founded by Aw family in other city, did not have any relation with each other as parent company and subsidiary. Sally Aw also replaced his foster brother Aw Swan as the head of Sing Tao Daily in mid-1952, as Aw Swan allegedly borrow money by using his foster father's name without his consent. Aw Boon Haw even made a public announcement to renounce his relationship with Aw Swan. After the death of Aw Boon Haw in 1954, , Aw Cheng Chye, eldest son of Aw Boon Haw's brother Aw Boon Par (b.1888, d.1944), was the general manager of Singapore-based Eng Aun Tong, the maker of Tiger Balm, while Sally Aw, became the head of Sin Poh Amalgamated (H.K.) Limited, which she was the largest shareholder among the family member. , Sally Aw's brother, Aw Kow, was also a director of Sin Chew Jit Poh of Singapore and Malaysia; her brother, Aw Swan, was the general manager of Sin Chew Jit Poh from June 1971 to circa 1972; while her cousin Aw Cheng Taik was the managing director of Singapore Tiger Standard until it was defunct in the 1950s. Widow of Aw Hoe, Chan Sow Yong, also served as an executive of Sing Tao. , Sally Aw another brother, Aw It Haw still owned a minority stake in Sin Poh Amalgamated (H.K.), and also served as a director. Aw Toke Tone, son of Aw Hoe, was the managing director of Hong Kong Tiger Standard in 1967. =Initial public offering and diversification= The shares of Sing Tao Newspapers Limited () was once traded in Far East Exchange () and Kam Ngan Stock Exchange () from 1972, the predecessors of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (). The initial public offering price was HK$6. Sing Tao's shared was traded in [old] Hong Kong Stock Exchange Limited since 1977. Sing Tao's listing was only few years behind the listing of Haw Par Brothers International, a Singapore company held by Singapore-based branch of Aw family. Moreover, the publisher of Hong Kong Tiger Standard was changed from \\"The Tiger Standard Limited\\" to \\"Hong Kong Standard Newspapers Limited\\" circa early 1970s (the latter was incorporated on 28 August 1970). The former was owned by Aw family directly but the latter was a subsidiary of Sing Tao Newspapers Limited in the late 1970s for 55% shares. It was owned by Aw Toke Tone (), the eldest son of the late Aw Hoe for about 90% in 1970. In October 1972, it was announced that a subsidiary (provisional Chinese name ) was formed to invest in real estate. The group purchased a land lease on 838 Lai Chi Kok Road, Kowloon (New Kowloon Inland Lot No.5567) to build a printing factory and commercial floor area for lease in 1974. In 1977, it was announced that the group had formed its own recording studio and photography processing centre that open to retail customers. According to 1977–78 result announcement, Sing Tao Group had also expanded into travel agency, medical centre and pharmaceutical industry. By 1979, Sing Tao operated their printing and publishing business as ), as well as Leefung-Asco's joint venture South China Printing Co., Ltd. Sing Tao also invested 49% stake in a documentary studio Farkas Studios in 1979. =Privatization and second IPO= In 1985, the company was privatised by Sally Aw via an Australian- listed company Cereus Australia for a reported price HK$13 per share (HK$11.5 cash and 1 share of Cinclus.) However, shares owned by Aw family members would only receive HK$9 per share (HK$7.5 cash and 1 share of Cinclus). The deal also made Cinclus had a wide shareholders base to apply for listing as a replacement of Sing Tao. Sing Tao and now independent listed company (ex- Cinclus), via an investment vehicle Scilla Limited, made a high-profile purchase on a land lease (Kowloon Inland Lot No.10722) in Canton Road, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon in October 1985. The newspaper credited the land lease was the \\"Land King of Canton Road\\" (). The price was HK$630 million (HK$705 per gross floor area). It was reported that the consortium had re-sold the land lease to other real estate developer in 1986, which the location was now known as Lippo Sun Plaza, The Sun Arcade and a hotel, The Langham (Hong Kong). However, less than a year of privatisation, Sing Tao Newspapers Limited was renamed to Sing Tao Limited (); the company started another IPO in 1986 and traded on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited on 19 March of the same year. It was reported that 75% shares were old shares that was sold by Cereus Australia's wholly owned subsidiary Cereus Newspapers (Hong Kong) Limited and only 25% were new shares. In 1987, Sally Aw owned 101,385,026 number of shares directly while her nephew Aw Toke Tone owned 216,000 directly; they did not owned any of the subsidiaries of Sing Tao Limited, including \\"Hong Kong Standard Newspapers Limited\\" which Aw Toke Tone owned a minority stake in the late 1970s to 1984. Sing Tao Holdings Circa 1989 a Bermuda-incorporated company Sing Tao Holdings Limited replaced Sing Tao Limited as the holding company of the group. At the same time, Cereus Australia, the investment vehicle Aw used to privatise Sing Tao in 1985, was delisted on the Australian Securities Exchange in the same year by Kargat Pty Limited.http://www.delisted.com.au/company/cereus-australia- limitedhttp://datanalysis.morningstar.com.au/licensee/datpremium/html/Delisted_comp98.pdf The ex-parent company was engaged in property investment in Sydney. According to a book published by the Chinese University of Hong Kong, citing a document that Sing Tao Holdings was a diversified conglomerate already in 1989, which only 7.7% revenue was from the newspaper despite 50% investments were newspaper related. The company published the Sing Tao Daily, the oldest surviving Chinese language daily newspaper in Hong Kong, which is also published overseas editions in New York City, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, London, Paris, Sydney and Melbourne. The first edition was published in 1938. It also published the English business newspaper The Standard in Hong Kong. Sing Tao also published the evening edition of Sing Tao Daily, known as Sing Tao Wan Pao (). The version discontinued in 1996. The company also operates several printing businesses, most notably the South China Printing Company (1988) Limited. Sing Tao Sports Club Limited, a professional football club founded by Sally Aw and Hsu King Shing (the coach of Sing Tao SC before its incorporation), was later owned by Sing Tao Limited and Wong Yue Kai (an accountant of Sing Tao Holdings). The paid-in share capital of the club was remained unchanged for many year for just HK$200. In 1990s Sing Tao Holdings also acquired another listed company Jademan Holdings (a new Bermuda- incorporated parent company was found in 1993 to replace Jademan Holdings as the listed company) Jademan Holdings was the publisher of another newspaper Tin Tin Daily News. Culturecom Holdings was sold in 1998 to . A subsidiary, Sing Tao Newspapers (Canada 1988) Limited, was also turned to a 50–50 joint venture between Sing Tao Holdings and Toronto Star Newspapers Limited in the same year. Toronto Star Newspapers also acquired 75% stake of Canada- incorporated Sing Tao Daily Limited, the publisher of Canada edition. =Sing Tao management found guilty of fudging circulation numbers= In 1998, members of the management team were found guilty of falsifying circulation numbers for The Standard newspaper, to attract advertisers and to raise the revenue of the newspapers. According to a report by the Center for International Media Assistance, the circulation of Sing Tao Daily and most major Beijing-friendly Chinese newspapers with overseas editions were remain unaudited, and therefore vulnerable to exaggeration: > “Jack Jia, founder of the Toronto-based semiweekly Chinese News, known for > its strong reporting on topics affecting the local Chinese community, > contends that the circulation numbers of more Beijing-friendly Chinese- > language papers are inflated, giving them an unfair advantage when obtaining > revenue through advertising. Unclear figures in media directories, a lack of > transparency and of independent circulation audits by publications such as > Sing Tao, Ming Pao, and World Journal, and distribution route data relayed > by an industry insider who wished to remain anonymous lend credence to such > suspicions..\\" The Standard were audited by Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations Limited as of 2012.http://www.hkabc.com.hk/admin/reports/1381.pdf The case, later known as Hongkong Standard case or Sally Aw case () was criticised by the public by not suing Sally Aw, the chairwoman of Sing Tao Holdings. Chief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, in the \\"Report on the key issues during the second year of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China\\" made a defence for decision of the Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung. However, Tung Chee-chen, brother of Tung Chee-hwa, was an independent non-executive director of Sing Tao Holdings since December 1996, while Tung Chee-hwa also served the same position in the 1980s to the 1990s. It was reported that Tung Chee-hwa was a family friend of Sally Aw. =Takeover and dismantle= As of 1998, the company was still owned by Sally Aw, the daughter of the founder of Sing Tao Daily for 50.04%. It was reported that Aw agreed to sell 23% shares of the company, to Dublin-listed private equity fund China Enterprise Development Fund for a reported HK$115.8 million (HK$1.20 per share) in December 1998. However, Lazard Asia won the final bid to become the controlling shareholder for a reported HK$269 million (HK$1.25 per share). According to Charles Ho who bought Sing Tao Holdings in 2001 from Lazard, also made an attempt to buy Sing Tao, but collapsed. However, Cha denied any formal agreement was signed. Ho's grandfather Ho Ying-chie, also filed a bankruptcy petition against Aw in January 1999. According to Ho Ying-chie, he had lent Aw HK$270 million. According to a reporter, Cha's listed company did announced a deal with Aw to form a new holding company for Sing Tao Holdings in May 1998, but the deal collapsed in June. During Lazard as the major shareholder, Hong Kong banker Cheung Din Youn (, brother of Barry Cheung) was the chairman and Charles Ho was the honorary chairman and an independent non-executive director. In mid-1999, Sing Tao SC stopped its operation as a football club. The legal entity of the company was used for other business in 2010 as Sing Tao Media Services,https://www.hongkongcompanieslist.com/sing-tao-media- services-limited-hkyplc/ by its new owner Sing Tao News Corporation after many years of dormant. In 2000, Sing Tao Holdings re-launched The Standard in tabloid format. In January 2001, Global China Technology Group, majority owned by Charles Ho, acquired approximately 51.36% shares of Sing Tao Holdings from Astral Light Investments Limited, a subsidiary of Lazard Asia Fund A, L.P., for HK355.6 million (HK$1.65 per share). In January 2002 South China Printing, Noble World Printing, Roman Financial Press, Valiant Packaging Holdings and their subsidiaries were sold from Sing Tao Holdings to Asia Printers Group for HK$428 million; Asia Printers Group was owned by CVC Capital Partners and Citigroup. In August 2002 the shares of Sing Tao Holdings that held by Global China Technology Group (74.5%), was sold to a private company Ming Yuan Investment Group for HK163.8 million (HK$0.524 per share). Ming Yuan Investment Group was owned by Yao Yuan (). However, the shares of Sing Tao Media Holdings, a subsidiary of Sing Tao Holdings, were distributed to the shareholders of Sing Tao Holdings before the takeover by Yao. Global China Technology Group offered to the public shareholders of Sing Tao Media Holdings after the transaction, to buy the shares of Sing Tao Media Holdings by offering the shares of Global China Technology Group, in a ratio of 1 to 1.75. The deal making the shareholder of Sing Tao Holdings at that time, would owned the shares of both Shanghai Ming Yuan Holdings (ex-Sing Tao Holdings) and Global China Technology Group if they did not sell the shares before the transactions. The residual assets at the 2002 takeover was mainly property investment such as properties in Saba Road, Richmond, British Columbia and in Wyndham Place, Hong Kong. However, it excluded Colony Hotel in Toronto.

He is known for being the guitarist and band-leader of the Mars Volta from 2001 until their breakup in 2012, and is the guitarist for the alternative rock groups At the Drive-In, Antemasque and Bosnian Rainbows. He was also the bassist for the dub band De Facto. He has embarked on a solo career, both in studio and in concert, frequently described as experimental, avant-garde and/or progressive. He has collaborated with numerous artists spanning from John Frusciante to El-P. Biography Rodríguez-López was born in Puerto Rico and grew up in El Paso, Texas, and spent some of his childhood in South Carolina. He began playing the bass at age 12, but then switched to guitar at 15 because he \\"needed more strings\\". It was during this time that Rodríguez-López met Cedric Bixler- Zavala while practicing with friend Paul Hinojos. Since then Rodríguez-López has spent most of his career living and working with his close friend Bixler- Zavala. During this time he frequently collaborated with his friends and future bandmates from El Paso, which included people such as Paul Hinojos, Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Julio Venegas and the late Jeremy Michael Ward. He attended Coronado High School in El Paso. He says he enjoys the company of his close friends and family when not fulfilling obligations to his many bands and projects. Rodríguez-López has been a vegetarian for most of his life. At the Drive-In (1996–2001, 2012–2018) At 17, Rodríguez-López left El Paso to hitchhike around the country for a year in the early 1990s, during which he acquired an addiction to opiates. Eventually he got in touch with friend Cedric Bixler-Zavala who suggested he come back to El Paso. With the help of Bixler-Zavala, he was able to return to El Paso where he could begin to reclaim his life from addiction and join At the Drive-In as backup vocalist and bass guitarist. After receiving a record deal with Flipside Records and recording Acrobatic Tenement with the band, he became their full-time bassist before switching to guitar. After several years and two more critically acclaimed albums, for a variety of reasons, Rodríguez-López and Bixler-Zavala left At the Drive-In and the band went on \\"indefinite hiatus\\". The remaining members, Paul Hinojos, Tony Hajjar, and Jim Ward went on to form Sparta while the duo focused on other projects. On January 9, 2012, At the Drive-In announced that they were reforming for a tour. The Mars Volta (2001–2012) They refocused their efforts on the dub outfit called De Facto which also included Jeremy Michael Ward and Isaiah \\"Ikey\\" Owens which they had started years before while still in At the Drive-In. Eventually the same collective of musicians in De Facto would be expanded into Rodríguez-López's new band, The Mars Volta. Once again starting from scratch he wrote and toured with the band which consumed almost all his time and money. On May 25, 2003 less than a month before the release of their first full-length album, De- Loused in the Comatorium, bandmate and close friend Jeremy Ward was found dead of a heroin overdose. This event, coupled with the memories of the suicide of his friend Julio Venegas years earlier, finally convinced both him and Bixler- Zavala to quit using opiates. Since then he has been clean and credited his newfound musical work ethic on his new lifestyle. The Mars Volta's second album, Frances the Mute, would later be dedicated to Ward. During the early years of the band he also worked on a low budget movie called A Manual Dexterity which starred Jeremy Ward. The soundtrack A Manual Dexterity: Soundtrack Volume 1 was released in 2004. The release of the second volume, which was originally planned for Spring of 2005, and the film were both delayed indefinitely due to legal problems. Conflicts over ownership of certain footage and Rodríguez-López's reluctance to revisit the project which featured his late friend Jeremy Michael Ward were both cited as reasons for the delay. However, Rodríguez-López stated that he does intend to release both Volume 2 and the film at some point in the future. On February 8, 2009, he and his fellow Mars Volta bandmates won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance. On January 23, 2013, the Mars Volta officially announced that they had broken up, following a series of tweets posted by Cedric Bixler-Zavala stating that he had departed the band. Their future was uncertain at this point, although Rodriguez-Lopez has not ruled out the possibility of reuniting in the future. Omar Rodriguez Lopez Group (2005–2012, 2018) In 2005 Rodríguez-López relocated to Amsterdam, where he eventually wrote and recorded four separate albums. His first solo project was the \\"Omar Rodríguez-López Quintet\\". Rodríguez-López played several live shows in Europe with his quintet, which in 2005 also included three members of the Mars Volta Group (Juan Alderete, Marcel Rodríguez-López and Adrián Terrazas-González) and Money Mark. The songs featured on this tour later appeared on the album Omar Rodriguez. It was characterized by long, improvisational songs with Dutch titles and no lyrics. The Quintet also performed live with Damo Suzuki, parts of which were recorded and incorporated into a 25-minute EP titled Please Heat This Eventually, which was released in 2007. During this time Rodríguez-López was also working on the Mars Volta's 2006 record Amputechture and composing the score to the film El Búfalo de la Noche simultaneously to his work with the quintet. On May 29, 2007, Se Dice Bisonte, No Búfalo was released. It was the third full-length solo album by Rodríguez-López. It featured performances by Mars Volta members Cedric Bixler-Zavala, Marcel Rodríguez-López, Juan Alderete, Adrián Terrazas- González as well as cameos by Money Mark, John Frusciante, and John Theodore. It was written and recorded between 2005–2006 in California and Amsterdam. The Quintet later resurfaced in 2007, now known as \\"The Rodríguez-López Group\\" to perform on the \\"white\\" stage at the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan on July 28. Performing with the group for the first time were singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala and drummer Thomas Pridgen. Solo releases (2004–present) On October 8, 2007 the EP Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & Lydia Lunch, a collaboration with spoken word poet Lydia Lunch, was released.News for July 12, 2007 http://www.goldstandardlabs.com/news.html The Apocalypse Inside of an Orange is a double LP featuring the original quintet and was released on vinyl November 20, 2007. It was also released for digital download. Calibration, a record that Rodríguez-López recorded during his stay in Amsterdam, was released February 5, 2008. It was described as being influenced by electronic music and acid-jazz. On June 10, 2008 a recording titled Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & Jeremy Michael Ward was released. It was a collaboration between the two and was recorded in 2001 before the formation of The Mars Volta. The LP consists of various ambient tracks based on field recordings in the musique concrète tradition. Rodríguez-López has continued to release a series of albums recorded in 2001 which include Absence Makes the Heart Grow Fungus and Minor Cuts and Scrapes in the Bushes Ahead, both released in late 2008. Another new album, Old Money was released in October 2008, with a vinyl version becoming available in early 2009 on the Stones Throw record label. Sonny Kay, co-owner of the former Gold Standard Labs label with Omar, created the album covers (and has done so for the majority of future Omar releases). Two Omar Rodríguez-López solo albums were released in Europe on January 26, 2009 from the Netherlands-based record label Willie Anderson Recordings: Megaritual and Despair. Despair is best described as a field recording, while Megaritual is a collaboration jam between Omar and his brother, Marcel Rodríguez-López. In mid-2009, a new entity has been created called El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez Lopez (the New Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group) to release the first in a series of three recordings completed in 2006. Thus far these recordings have only been known as the Omar and Zach Hill collaborations. The first recording titled Cryptomnesia was released on May 5, 2009. Vocals written and performed by Bixler-Zavala were recorded in 2008. The lineup for this entity is: Omar Rodríguez-López on guitar, Cedric Bixler-Zavala on vocals, Zach Hill on drums, Jonathan Hischke on synth bass, and Juan Alderete on bass. The Omar Rodriguez- Lopez Group toured Europe in March 2009, supported by Zechs Marquise. At the end of 2009, Rodríguez-López released three albums, Los Sueños de un Hígado, Xenophanes and Solar Gambling digitally through Rodríguez-López Productions. While Xenophanes was also released on CD and vinyl, Los Suenos De Un Higado and Solar Gambling only had a limited vinyl release. Rodríguez-López also created a video for \\"Asco Que Conmueve los Puntos Erógenos\\", from Xenophanes, and posted it on YouTube on November 30, 2009. In January 2010, Ciencia de los Inútiles was released under a new group, El Trio de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez. The trio features Rodríguez-López on acoustic guitar, Ximena Sariñana on vocals and Aaron Cruz on upright bass. A video for \\"Miércoles\\" was also released. In May 2010, he released a collaboration titled Omar Rodriguez-Lopez & John Frusciante with John Frusciante, free of charge through his website, with the option to donate. All money raised will go to the Keep Music in Schools programs. On May 30, 2010, the album Sepulcros de Miel by Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Quartet was digitally released, which also featured Frusciante. The album Tychozorente was scheduled for release on November 1, 2010; however, it received an early release on September 14, 2010 as a digital download. Another album, titled Cizaña de los Amores, was digitally released on October 11, 2010. CD and vinyl versions of both albums are only available in Europe. Mantra Hiroshima, another Omar and Zach Hill collaboration, was digitally released on November 29, followed next day by Dōitashimashite, album of live material recorded in September during the Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group's first US tour. A video for \\"Agua Dulce de Pulpo\\" from the upcoming album Un Escorpión Perfumado was also released during that period, and the album itself was released on December 20 in digital form, with CD and vinyl versions to follow. On April 16, 2011, Omar released Telesterion a compilation album featuring 38 songs from Omar's solo albums. Although this has been the only release of 2011, other projects have been hinted at, such as Двойственность вздохов (Russian for Duality of Sighs), a documentary about the Omar Rodriguez-Lopez Group's Russian mini-tour, directed by Omar and shot by Paco Ibarra. The Vinyl edition of Telesterion also contained artwork for 6 solo albums that have yet to be released, and featured a new track, \\"Cásate Colmillo\\", off of an album supposedly titled The Somnambulis. On July 7, 2016, Ipecac Records announced that they are going to release 12 albums by Omar, fortnightly, till December 2016. They were recorded in the period 2008-2013 and one featured The Mars Volta line-up and a guest appearance by John Frusciante. The first album Sworn Virgins was released digitally on July 15, 2016, and featured the single \\"To Kill A Chi Chi\\". Recorded in El Paso and Zapopan, the titles include Sworn Virgins, Corazones, Blind Worms Pious Swine, Arañas En La Sombra, Umbrella Mistress, El Bien Y Mal Nos Une, Cell Phone Bikini, Infinity Drips, Weekly Mansions, Zapopan, Nom De Guerre Cabal, Some Need It Lonely. Bosnian Rainbows & Antemasque (2012–present) On April 8, 2014, Omar announced a new musical project called Antemasque with former At the Drive-In and Mars Volta bandmates Cedric Bixler-Zavala (vocals) and David Elitch (drums) as well as Flea, the bassist for the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The group released their first song, \\"4AM\\". Flea said that Antemasque is a project between Omar and Cedric, and that he is only a contributing artist. In 2012, with Mars Volta going on hiatus, Rodríguez-López formed a solo band that eventually took the name Bosnian Rainbows. It consists of Deantoni Parks (drums, keyboards), Teri Gender Bender (vocals) and Nicci Kasper (keyboards). They released one self-titled album in June 2013. , both Bosnian Rainbows & Antemasque have essentially been put on hold due to touring commitments of At the Drive-In. Other media Aside from music, Rodríguez-López is also involved in filmmaking and photography. Beginning in his At the Drive-in days he started to document all kinds of things: live shows, sound checks, dressing rooms, hotels, airport lounges, sightseeing, encounters with colleagues. Since 2001 he produced a large number of films, of which The Sentimental Engine Slayer was the first to be released. Rodríguez-López wrote, directed, produced and starred in the film, which was premiered at the International Film Festival Rotterdam in February 2010 and saw the DVD release in January 2013. Another film directed by Omar, Los Chidos, was premiered in March 2012 at SXSW. Furthermore, Rodríguez-López and Hans Zimmer worked together to compose the score for the 2009 Guillermo Arriaga film The Burning Plain. The film was his second collaboration with the writer/director after scoring the 2007 film El Búfalo de la Noche with the Mars Volta; in addition to some original material, the score also includes material used in Amputechture. Rodríguez- López's first photo book, Hunters in High Heels documenting the years from 2000 to 2006, was slated to release in 2013 but was since postponed indefinitely due to unknown reasons. Musicianship Omar, with back toward the audience, directs the Mars Volta. Style Rodríguez-López's compositional and playing style is characterized by, among other factors, riffs, melodies based in minor modes, changing meters, unresolving dissonances (in particular a heavy use of the tritone), chromatic passages, and lengthy improvisation. He is also known for his vast array of effects pedals; in a feature appearing in Guitar World, Rodríguez-López stated that he \\"began to see effects as allies in my war against the guitar\\". In that interview he also stated that he hated the guitar for a very long time. He only utilized it because it was the instrument his bandmates could \\"relate to\\". He said he \\"wrestled\\" guitar by adding effects and playing oddly to attempt \\"making it sound like anything besides this thing I hate—the guitar!\\". However, he claimed to feel more comfortable with the instrument on Amputechture. Rodríguez-López plays guitar left-handed. He has cited salsa pianist and bandleader Larry Harlow as his primary influence. Both Rodríguez-López and bandmate Cedric Bixler-Zavala have recorded with former Can lead singer Damo Suzuki for the Please Heat This Eventually EP. In the progressive rock genre in which the Mars Volta are often categorized, he has professed that he \\"like[s] a lot of those groups, particularly King Crimson and early Genesis.\\" As such, he has cited his main and clearest influence Frank Zappa, Crimson's Robert Fripp, jazz fusion guitarist John McLaughlin as well as hardcore punk and hard rock guitarists Greg Ginn and Jimi Hendrix respectively. He has also named Siouxsie, Missing Persons, Wayne Shorter as being among \\"all the greats\\" along with Steve Reich, Wayne Shorter, Tangerine Dream, Tchaikovsky, Tom Petty and Marvin Gaye.\\" He has also stated that film is a primary influence on him, likening his recording style to that of a film director, where the \\"scenes are shot out of sequence and the final creation is in the hands of the director.\\". Equipment Omar has endorsed Ibanez guitars since the Mars Volta's inception in 2001. Previously he used Squier Super-Sonic guitars while playing with At the Drive-In. He also recorded De-Loused in the Comatorium with a Gibson SG II from the early 1970s which he also used in live improv shows with Flea and John Frusciante. In 2008, Ibanez released the ORM-1 Omar Rodriguez- Lopez signature guitar, which was produced through 2012. He uses Seymour Duncan Little '59 pickups as well. Although he tunes to E standard tuning, Omar uses Ernie Ball .013-.056 gauge strings with a wound G string, saying that \\"they feel more real than the really thin ones\\". Omar also plays through an Orange Rockerverb combo amp as well. In recent years, Omar has taken a minimalist approach to his pedals, which at one point was a very complex setup. During the Mars Volta's 2011 tour with Soundgarden, he used a Boss DD5 Digital Delay, an MXR Phase 90, an Electro-Harmonix Memory Boy analog delay, a Boss PS-6 Harmonist, a Line 6 M9 Stompbox Modeler, an MXR M133 Micro Amp, an Ibanez WH10V2 wah-wah, an Ibanez TC7 tri-mode chorus, and a Line 6 DL4 delay modeler. During the Mars Volta's final shows and At the Drive-In's reunion tour, Rodriguez-Lopez switched back to a full-sized Ibanez Jetking guitar, although retaining his preferred single-pickup and volume knob configuration and 24\\" neck scale. In a recent interview with TC Electronic, he is seen using a blue Ibanez Jetking with two full-size humbuckers. Most recently, while performing with Bosnian Rainbows, Rodriguez-Lopez began to use a mid-1960s era left-handed Supro 3/4 scale guitar with a single pickup in the bridge position. Shortly afterwards, he was seen playing a custom Ibanez guitar that closely resembled his Supro. In addition, Rodriguez-Lopez now uses flatwound strings on his guitar. Rodriguez-Lopez's pedalboard for Bosnian Rainbows consisted of a Boss TU-3 Chromatic Tuner, an Empress Superdelay, a Blackout Effects Whetstone analog phaser, a Catalinbread Semaphore tremolo pedal, a Boss DD-5 Digital Delay, an EarthQuaker Devices Rainbow Machine, an Empress Fuzz pedal, a Catalinbread Calisto chorus/vibrato pedal, and a Boss SL-20 slicer. As producer Rodríguez-López is also notable for his recording, producing and songwriting techniques. He has claimed that he is \\"ignorant of music theory\\" and that thus he lacks knowledge in writing music in standard notation, claiming that his songwriting \\"comes from emotion completely\\". Rodríguez-López claims to write all of the music for his projects, then dictates the performance to the musicians involved. In addition to his producing credits with the Mars Volta and his solo albums, he also produced the only LP from the defunct LA-based band Radio Vago and in 2009, handled the production of a recording titled \\"Terra Incognita\\" from actress/singer Juliette Lewis' band The New Romantiques. Omar also produced (as well as contributed bass to) Sin Sin Sin, the debut LP from the band Le Butcherettes, which was released in 2011 on Rodriguez-Lopez Productions.

The crowned lion rampant in the first (upper left) quarter represents the Kingdom of Bohemia, which Wrocław became part of upon the death of Duke Henry VI of Silesia in 1335. In the second (upper right) quarter there is the Silesian eagle which comes from the ruling Piast dynasty. The letter \\"W\\" in the third quarter stands for both Wratislavia, the Latin name of the city, and for the name of the legendary founder of the city Wrócisław (probably Duke Vratislaus I of Bohemia). In the fourth quarter there is John the Evangelist with halo and an overturned crown as pectorale. Its blazon is: \\"Quarterly, I: Gules, a lion rampant queue fourch erect facing sinister Argent, armed and langued Or outlined Sable, crowned Or outlined Sable; II: Or, an eagle Sable charged with across its breast and wings a crescent Argent upward pointing with a crosslet Argent attached rising from the middle; III: Or, a capital letter 'W' Sable serifed; IV: Gules, the head and shoulders of St. John the Evangelist gardant Argent, with youthful face and long hair Argent outlined Sable and with halo Or outlined Sable, issuant from an inverted crown Or outlined Sable.

In 1938, this coat of arms was abolished, as the Nazi authorities viewed it as too Slavic. It was replaced by a \\"purely German\\" coat-of-arms, a shield parted horizontally, with a black Silesian eagle on the top without Christian crosslet on the breast, and an Iron Cross in red field on the bottom. This was abolished after Wrocław became part of Poland in 1945. Wrocław's arms from 1948 to 1990. Wrocław, as part of the People's Republic of Poland, changed the coat of arms again as the authorities now considered the original version as too Germanic. It was replaced by a \\"purely Polish\\" coat of arms with a Silesian black eagle on gold and a Polish white eagle on a red field. These coat of arms were used from 1948 to 1990. After the collapse of communism, the city decided to revert to the coat of arms of 1530, albeit in a more stylized form.

It is on the River Feale, from the county town, Tralee. The town of Listowel had a population of 4,820 according to the CSO Census 2016. Described by the organisers of Listowel's writers festival as the \\"Literary Capital of Ireland\\", a number of internationally known playwrights and authors have lived there, including Bryan MacMahon and John B. Keane.  Location  Bridge over the River Feale at ListowelListowel is on the N69 Limerick – Foynes – Tralee road. Bus Éireann provides daily services to Tralee, Cork, and Limerick. The nearest railway station is Tralee. Listowel used to have its own railway station on a broad gauge line between Tralee and Limerick city; however, this was closed to passengers in 1963, to freight in 1978, and finally abandoned and lifted in 1988. The station building has been preserved as a private residence. Listowel is located at the head of the North Kerry limestone plain. Positioned in the very heart of North Kerry, on the River Feale, its hinterland is an area of mainly dairy agricultural use. The barony of IraghticonnorBarony of Iraghticonnor at GENUKI. Retrieved 9 September 2010 is to the north, with the barony of Clanmaurice to the south. Surrounding villages include Asdee, Ballybunion, Ballyduff, Ballylongford, Causeway, Duagh, Lisselton, Lixnaw, Moyvane, Finuge and Tarbert.  History  In July 2000, Listowel was officially designated as one of Ireland's 26 \\"Heritage Towns\\" – in part because of modern environmental and renewal works, but also because of its architectural heritage and \\"historic importance\\".Listowel Urban District Council, Kerry Local Authorities, Annual Report  Listowel Castle  Listowel Castle Listowel's history dates back to at least 1303 when it first appears in the Plea Roll. Fortress to the Fitzmaurice family, the town developed around Listowel Castle and its square. The last bastion against Queen Elizabeth I in the Desmond campaign, Listowel Castle was built in the 15th century and was the last fortress of the Geraldines to be subdued. It fell after 28 days siege to Sir Charles Wilmot on 5 November 1600, who had the castle's garrison executed in the following days. The castle became the property of the Hare family, the holders of the title of Earl of Listowel, after reverting away from the Fitzmaurices, Knights of Kerry. It is now a national monument, and was subject to restoration by the Office of Public Works (OPW) from 2005. OPW tour guides are now based at the castle during the summer tourist season giving free tours of the castle. Another smaller castle at Woodford, Listowel, was built in the post-1600 period by the then Knight of Kerry. The effects of the famine on Listowel are commemorated by a communal grave on the outskirts of the town  Lartigue Monorailway  Listowel played a role in Irish railway history as it was the site of the world's first monorail operation. The Listowel and Ballybunion Railway was built to the Lartigue system, with a double-engined steam locomotive straddling an elevated rail. It connected the town with Ballybunion. Coaches, with a compartment on either side of the rail, had to be kept balanced. If a cow was being brought to market, two calves would be sent also, to balance it on the other side. The calves would then be returned, one on either side of the rail. In 2003, a 1000 m long replica of the original monorailway was opened.  Listowel Mutiny  Listowel was the site of a famous mutiny which occurred during the Irish War of Independence. On 17 June 1920, members of the Royal Irish Constabulary at Listowel police station refused to obey the commanding officer's orders that they be relocated to police outposts outside of the town. The Black and Tans had occupied the town barracks, forcing the redeployment, something which was both dangerous and hopeless in the face of huge local hostility to the men in question. Police commissioner Colonel Smythe wished that the RIC constables would operate with the army in countering the IRA's fight for freedom in the more rural areas. He suggested while negotiating with the constables that they would be given the power to shoot any suspect on sight. Led by Constable Jeremiah Mee, they refused, both from a point of personal safety and possibly also from a sense of sympathy with their country men struggling against the British forces. The officers were discharged after the mutiny. The episode has come down to be known as the Listowel mutiny.  Earl of Listowel  The title of Earl of Listowel is associated with the Hare family. The current incumbent Lord Listowel is Francis Michael Hare, one of the 92 hereditary peers elected to the British House of Lords. Holders of the title have included William Hare, 5th Earl of Listowel, who was a Labour politician and served as the last Secretary of State for India and Burma. Another member of the family was the Conservative politician John Hare, 1st Viscount Blakenham. He was the third son of the fourth Earl.  Industry   Kerry Co-op  In the 1970s many small dairies in Ireland started to merge so as to be able to compete with the larger milk companies within the European Economic Community (which Ireland joined in 1973). Dairies in County Kerry followed suit and with an injection of capital from milk suppliers in the county, it acquired the state-owned milk processing company and its creameries, together with its 42.5% stake in the private NKMP company. Additionally, six of the eight independent co-ops, which held the other 42.5%, were acquired and accordingly the private company became a subsidiary of the newly formed Kerry Co-operative Creameries Ltd (Kerry Co-op) which began trading in January 1974. Thus Kerry started out as the smallest of Ireland's six major agricultural co-operatives in 1974. In the period from 1974 to 1979, Kerry expanded its milk business in a similar fashion to other dairy co-ops but did so on a consistently profitable basis, which was not always typical of the traditional dairy Co-op sector. EEC entry had brought better milk prices, increased milk volumes and improved farm incomes in Ireland. Kerry Co-op grew organically simply by taking the milk that came its way, processing it and meeting other farmer requirements in terms of inputs and on-farm services. Its milk supply increased from 67 million gallons in 1974 to 87 million gallons in 1978. The new co-op acquired the independent Killarney, Limerick, Mariewasere and Ballinahina Dairies (Cork) which later became part of Kerry's Dawn Dairies structure with the addition of Galway and Moate Dairies. However, in 1979 everything changed for Kerry Co-op when the county was chosen as a pilot area for a bovine disease eradication scheme. Allied to this, milk production was further depressed due to wet summer weather in 1979 and in 1980, which meant that Kerry lost almost 20% of its milk supply. This was significant in that it happened at a time when the co-op was in the course of completing a €18 million capital expenditure programme at the NKMP plant in Listowel.version 8 homepage  Kerry Group  Kerry Group today is a leader in global food ingredients and flavours markets, and a leading branded consumer foods processing and marketing organisation in some EU markets. Headquartered in Tralee, the Group employs approximately 290 people at its manufacturing plant in Listowel.Agreement reached in pay dispute between Kerry Group and 290 Listowel workers  Education in Listowel  Listowel is serviced by many primary, post-primary and post-leaving certificate education facilities. Children between five and twelve are facilitated by Presentation Primary School for girls, Scoil Realta na Maidne, for boys, and Gaelscoil Lios Tuathail, which is a mixed school. The town has two Catholic, secondary schools, Presentation Secondary School, Listowel and St. Michael's College. The town is also served by Listowel Community College, a mixed post-primary and post-leaving certificate school. The town hosts Learning Initiative of North Kerry.  Festivals and events   Listowel Races  The origin of Listowel races can be traced back to an annual gathering at Ballyeigh, Ballybunion, about nine miles from Listowel. This event, which dates to the early nineteenth century, consisted of a variety of games, horse-racing and a pre-arranged faction fight which concluded the event. Due to disturbances surrounding these fights, the meeting at Ballyeigh was suspended and racing transferred to Listowel, where the first meeting took place in 1858. The racecourse is located beside the River Feale, and two of the three entrances to the course are accessed by bridge across the river. The racecourse is called \\"the island\\" by the locals due to this fact.Listowel Race Co It is now the joint-longest racing festival in Ireland at seven days, equal in duration to the Galway races, and second in attendances only to that event. It is the last major racing festival of the summer and the last one before Christmas. Traditionally it was a meeting where farmers came to spend/gamble the money they made from the harvest but it has since grown into something larger and more wideranging.Go Racing – Listowel The Listowel track consists of a 1-mile, 2 furlong mile oval left-handed track with National Hunt fences and hurdles. The hurdle course is adjustable after each day's racing to give new ground. The track has been extended to allow extra race permutations and to enable the Festival Meeting in September to extend to seven days. The Listowel Racecourse is within walking distance of the town centre.  Listowel Writers' Week  Listowel is home to Ireland's oldest literary festival. Since its inception in 1970 Listowel Writers’ Week has been recognised as the primary event in Ireland's literary calendar. North Kerry is the birthplace of many of Ireland's most prominent writers, including Dr. John B Keane, Dr Bryan Mac Mahon, Professor Brendan Kennelly, Seamus Wilmot, Gabriel Fitzmaurice, George Fitzmaurice, Maurice Walsh and Robert Leslie Boland. The Writers' Week Festival was established to celebrate those writers and to provide an opportunity for other Irish writers to develop their talents and meet new audiences. The concept of the Literary Workshop was first introduced at Writers’ Week in 1971 by Bryan MacMahon. Irish writers have shared their skills in poetry, fiction, theatre, and screen – with workshops in song writing, comic writing and storytelling also subsequently added. Competitions were introduced, together with a series of literary awards, which have given recognition to new writers over the last number of years. In that time many Irish and international literary figures have gathered in Listowel at the annual festival to celebrate the work of new and established writers. The total prize fund of €35,000 includes the Kerry Group Novel of the Year and The Pigott Poetry Prize. The event takes place in an atmosphere of learning and celebration which gives new and established writers an opportunity to discuss their work before a national and international audience. Under the leadership of its President Colm Tóibín, together with literary advisors Professor Brendan Kennelly, Colm Tóibín, Seamus Hosey, Lawrence Block, Michael Collins and Jennifer Johnston, Writers' Week provides a programme of literary events including lectures, readings, workshops, book launches, seminars, theatre, literary and historical tours, art exhibitions, music and dance. Participants have included: Nobel Laureate and Booker Prize-winner J. M. Coetzee, Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney, Booker Prize winners Kazuo Ishiguro, John Banville, James Kelman and Anne Enright, Poets Laureate Ted Hughes, Carol Ann Duffy, and Andrew Motion, playwrights Tom Murphy, Brian Friel, Roddy Doyle, Frank McGuinness and Hugh Leonard, poets Michael Hartnett, Leland Bardwell, John Montague, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Nuala Ní Dhomhnaill, Roger McGough, Rita Ann Higgins and Kate Cruise O'Brien, and other novelists and writers including Blake Morrison, Chris Whyte, Lionel Shriver, Colm Tóibín, Jennifer Johnston, John McGahern, Joseph O'Neill, Sebastian Barry, Joseph O'Connor, Hugo Hamilton, Edna O'Brien, Douglas Kennedy, Patrick McGrath, William Trevor, Colum McCann, Gerard Donovan, Frank McCourt, Irvine Welsh, Robyn Rowland, Andrew Lindsay, Michael Cunningham, Jane Urquhart, Anatoly Kudryavitsky, Cees Nooteboom, Michael Dibdin, Abdel Bari Atwan, Clive James, Melvyn Bragg, Alain De Botton, Lloyd Jones, Robert Fisk, Jung Chang, Terry Jones, Gabriel Byrne, and Graham Norton. John B. Keane of Listowel wrote: :\\"Beautiful Listowel, serenaded night and day by the gentle waters of the River Feale. :Listowel where it is easier to write than not to write, :Where first love never dies, and the tall streets hide the loveliness, :The heartbreak and the moods, great and small, :Of all the gentle souls of a great and good community. :Sweet, incomparable hometown that shaped and made me.\\"  Listowel Food Fair  The Listowel food Fair has been running annually since 1995. The festival promotes local artisan food products, and attracts celebrity chefs, nutritionists and artisan food entrepreneurs.  Sport  Listowel Emmets is a Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club which supports the traditional Irish sports of hurling, camogie, Gaelic football, handball and rounders, plus music, dance and the Irish language. The club has a tradition of GAA involvement and achievement since June 1885 when Listowel GAA (The Feale Amateurs) was established as a GAA branch. In 1956 Emmets GAA Club was formed and in the following year the senior, intermediate and minor North Kerry League titles were won. In 1979, the Listowel Emmets GAA pitch next to St. Michaels College was closed for redevelopment; it re-opened again in 1981, and was renamed in honour of Frank J Sheehy who was appointed as Chairman to the County Board in 1953. Listowel Celtic is the local soccer club, playing in the Premier A division of the Kerry District League. Listowel also has clubs involved in tennis, athletics, rugby, basketball, badminton and cricket. Listowel also hosts a 24hr running race; the Listowel Endurance Festival.  Architecture  Listowel's architectural features include the four-arch bridge traversing the River Feale at the entrance to the town. Dating from 1829, according to local tradition this bridge (referred to locally as the \\"Big Bridge\\") replaced a smaller wooden structure, which had been destroyed in floods. Local plasterer and builder Pat McAuliffe (1846–1921) used stucco or external plaster to decorate the façades of townhouses and shops in the town and surrounding area. A native of Listowel, McAuliffe created a number of plasterwork works, including \\"The Maid of Erin\\", which depicts a romantic image of Mother Ireland surrounded by a harp, a wolfhound and other symbols of Ireland. The Maid was at the centre of a controversy in 1999 when a new owner decided to \\"cover her dignity\\" and painted a dress on her famous bosom. A debate ensued and he was persuaded to return her to her original semi-nude state.

Its most characteristic feature is the crown-like shape of the tips of its branches. The epithet pyxidatus means \\"box-like\\"—a reference to this shape. Artomyces pyxidatus can be observed throughout Northern Canada during the growing season. In Britain, it was recorded in 2011, almost 116 years after its previous reliable report, a collection made by mycologist Carleton Reale on 20 October 1886. It is widespread but uncommon in Western Europe. The fungus produces its hard, coral-like fruiting bodies on growing wood. Basidia and basidiospores are produced on the surfaces of the branches. These fungi are considered edible when raw, but are better cooked. Some people may experience gastrointestinal upset, especially after eating a large quantity. The raw fruiting bodies have a peppery taste that usually disappears when cooked.

He was a member of the Polish Sejm from the constituency of Nowogródek. Rejtan is remembered for a dramatic gesture he made in September 1773, as a deputy of the Partition Sejm. There, Rejtan tried to prevent the legalization of the first partition of Poland, a scene that has been immortalized in the painting Rejtan by Jan Matejko. He has been the subject of many other art works, and is a symbol of patriotism in Belarus and Poland. Despite his efforts, the partition of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was legalized soon afterwards. Biography Reytan family manor in Hruszówka by Napoleon Orda Tadeusz Rejtan was born on 20 August 1742 in Hruszówka (date as given in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, some other sources give other dates). He was the son of a minor, but relatively wealthy noble, Dominik Rejtan, podkomorzy of Nowogródek and Teresa Wołodkowicz. He was likely the oldest of five brothers. His brother, Michał, would come to hold the position of pisarz (scribe) of Nowogródek. His grandfather, also named Michał, was the skarbnik (treasurer) of Mazyr. The family had been aligned to the powerful Radziwiłł family, and Tadeusz would also pledge his allegiance to them. Afterwards, he served in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania cavalry, in a chorągiew unit of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He might have participated in the Confederation of Bar (1768–1772), but historians are not certain about the validity of that claim. In 1773, in the aftermath of the War of the Bar Confederation, a special session of the Sejm (Polish parliament) was convened in Warsaw, capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by its three neighbours (Russian Empire, Prussia and Austria) in order to legalize their First Partition of Poland. That Sejm became known as the Partition Sejm. Rejtan was one of the deputies that tried to prevent the legalization of the first partition of Poland, despite threats from the foreign ambassadors. For example, Russian ambassador, Otto von Stackelberg, declared that in the face of refusal the whole capital of Warsaw would be destroyed by the Russians; other threats included executions, confiscation of estates, and increase of partitioned territory. Rejtan was a deputy to that Sejm, from the constituency of Nowogródek, and the local sejmik gave him very explicit instructions to defend the Commonwealth. On the Sejm's first day (19 April), and possibly even in the discussions on the previous days, Rejtan, working together with the Stanisław Bohuszewicz and Samuel Korsak, strongly protested against the proposal of Adam Poniński who wanted to form a confederated sejm (such as sejm would be immune to the threat of liberum veto). Rejtan's arguments were primarily legal; he argued that Poniński had no right to be the Sejm Marshal, and that there are no grounds to form a confederated sejm. He also appropriated one of the two Marshal's staffs. During a discussion with another deputy, Rejtan stated that he was aware that the foreign powers can force the issue, but his intention was to make it clear that any treaty they force through the Sejm would not be unanimously accepted. Rejtan was thus able to disrupt the proceedings on that day. He would attempt to delay and disrupt the proceedings, but he was ignored, overruled and threatened by other deputies, as on 20 April Poniński returned to the Sejm with an escort of Russian and Prussian soldiers. A quickly convened Sejm court begun deliberating on the potential illegality of Rejtan's actions, but little discussion occurred on that day. The next day, the court sentenced him to imprisonment and confiscation of goods; that was challenged by Rejtan. Eventually, on 21 April, most of the deputies had signed the act of the confederation, which was accepted by the king. Troops made it difficult for the other deputies to be present in the Sejm chambers, although a dwindling number of deputies, including Rejtan, still were present. To finish forming the confederation and elect Poniński its marshal, some confederation deputies entered the Chambers, passed a motion, and were attempting to leave. This is when Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held (leaving of the chamber signified the end of the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion). Others tried to block the passage too. Their gesture was dramatic but futile, as the leaving deputies just stepped over Rejtan, and in a commotion pushed through the others. Eventually, just a few deputies, including Rejtan, were left inside; they refused to leave, hoping to be removed by foreign troops, which would be a symbol of the foreign intervention. Around 22 April, Rejtan and the remaining colleagues left the Sejm chamber after about 36 hours of having little sleep and food (Rejtan is said to have refused to eat in the Sejm chamber, saying it would disrespect it). Eventually however, they left in return for a guarantee from the foreign diplomats that the sentence passed on him would be nullified, and no other repercussions would be carried out. Nonetheless Rejtan would face some difficulties, many orchestrated by Poniński, and had asked general Robert Scipio von Lentulus, commander of the Prussian garrison stationed in Warsaw, for an escort, which he received. Rejtan would remain in Warsaw during the next few years (the Partition Sejm lasted till 1776), but his influence diminished. He issued a print manifesto in December 1773, criticizing the current confederated sejm, and supportive of the Bar Confederation, but it received little publicity. After the partition Rejtan withdrew from political life. He never married. He spent the rest of his days in a small estate at Hruszówka, where he died on 8 August 1780. His mental health had deteriorated; according to some due to distress with the loss of a part of his homeland, but rumours about his erratic behavior date to soon after the Partition Sejm begun in 1773, before its final motions were passed in 1776. He is said to have been escorted by his brothers from Warsaw on 19 March 1775 after he had a fit, and was locked in a small family's mansion which he would never leave up till his death. Eventually he committed suicide, cutting himself with glass (most detailed accounts say he swallowed it, to prevent being taken by pursuing Russian soldiers). His exact place of burial is unknown, and exhumation in Hruszówka in 1930 failed to conclusively find his grave. Legacy . Rejtan visible on the right. Rejtan's dramatic attempt to prevent the partition earned him lasting recognition in Poland, one that began even during the proceedings, as he was lauded by some other deputies. His action was also praised as patriotic and respectable by the Prussian and Russian military commanders in Warsaw, who offered him a military escort to protect him from some confederates (particularly Poniński was holding a grudge against him). Soon, brochures and newspaper articles spread the information about his patriotic gesture throughout Poland and abroad. During the Great Sejm of 1788–1792, a decree was passed, commending Rejtan, and deputies discussed a project to put a plaque to his name in the Sejm Chambers. His gesture in the Sejm was less famously repeated by Jan Suchorzewski during that period. Stone in memory of Tadeusz Rejtan. Mausoleum Chapel, Hrushauka, Belarus He was, and to the present day is, considered a shining example of a patriot. He has been the subject of many art works, poems, songs and books. Writers who mentioned him included Stanisław Staszic, Franciszek D. Kniaźnin, Adam Mickiewicz, Józef Szujski, Leon Wegner, Seweryn Goszczyński, Jan Lechoń, Artur Oppman, Seweryna Duchińska, Maria Konopnicka, Kazimierz Brończyk, Wiktor Woroszylski, Marian Brandys, and Jerzy Zawieyski. A bust of Rejtan was funded by his family in 1860, and is in the National Museum in Kraków. A small monument of him is said to have collapsed in Kraków in 1946, soon after World War II, and was not rebuilt until 2007. A medal with his face was issued in the Grand Duchy of Poznań in 1860. Several portraits of him exist, including one by Franciszek Smuglewicz. However, his most famous depiction is that by Jan Matejko, who showed a more fictionalized version of the events at the Partition Sejm in his 1866 painting, Rejtan na sejmie warszawskim 21 kwietnia 1773 – upadek Polski (Rejtan at the Warsaw Sejm of 21 April 1773 – the Fall Of Poland). Numerous schools, streets and military units in Poland bear his name as well. Notes a Polish historian Jerzy Michalski in his 1988 entry on Rejtan in Polski Słownik Biograficzny notes that historian Wanda Konczyńska found some documents contradicting the extent of Rejtan's mental illness, and suggesting he might have taken part in some business transactions, but the evidence is not conclusive.

Developed in 1981 and released in 1982 by On-Line Systems (later Sierra Entertainment), the game was shipped with six double-sided floppy disks and contained 1,500 areas (screens) to explore along with 39 scenarios to solve. Produced at a time when most games rarely took up more than one side of a floppy, Time Zone is one of the first games of this magnitude released for home computer systems. Ports were released for Japanese home computers PC-88, PC-98 and FM-7 in 1985. Gameplay Time Zone allows players to travel through time and across the globe solving puzzles while meeting famous historical figures such as Benjamin Franklin, Cleopatra, and Julius Caesar. The game has static pictures and a text parser that understands two-word commands. Development The game used the company's existing Hi-Res Adventures engine. Roberta Williams was the designer and writer, and its development took six months and about ten other people—the first example of the modern video game-development model in which programmers, artists, and designers are separate people in a team larger than a few people—worked on the game for a year. Each of the more than 1,300 locations had its own artwork. The company hoped to release Time Zone before Christmas 1981, but did not do so until March 1982. Because of the game's difficulty, Sierra offered a telephone help line that players could call for hints. Reception BYTE wrote \\"The Guinness Book of World Records must be getting ready for a computer game category, if Time Zone is any indication of things to come. Without a doubt, it is the longest adventure game to date\\". The game received a Certificate of Merit in the category of \\"Best Computer Adventure\\" at the 4th annual Arkie Awards. Williams' brother-in-law and fellow employee, John, later said, \\"It frankly wasn't that good\\". Time Zone sold poorly; the original retail price of US$99 ($ today) may make it the most expensive computer game in history after inflation. The game was reissued the year of its release as part of the short-lived SierraVentures line.

APDS rounds are sabot rounds, firing a spin-stabilized armor penetrating sub-projectile, and were commonly used in large calibre tank guns, up until the early 1980s, but have now been superseded by armour-piercing fin- stabilized discarding sabot-tracer (APFSDS-T) projectiles used in smooth-bore guns, firing a fin-stabilized armor penetrating sub-projectile.an exemplary cut-away cross-section of the internal components of a 105mm APDS projectile However, APDS rounds are still commonly used in small or medium calibre weapon systems. For a given calibre, this type of ammunition can effectively double the armour penetration of a gun, compared to those firing armour-piercing (AP), armour-piercing, capped (APC), or armour-piercing, capped, ballistic capped (APCBC) projectiles. The saboted light armour penetrator (SLAP) concept applies this technology to small arms calibres.  History and development  The genesis of APDS was development by engineers working for the French Edgar Brandt company of saboted ammunition, in which a sub-calibre core was surrounded by a lightweight 'sabot' (from the French term 'shoe') that was retained by the round for the duration of its time in flight until impact, and was fielded in two calibers (75 mm/57 mm for the Mle1897/33 75 mm anti-tank cannon, 37 mm/25 mm for several 37 mm gun types) just before the French-German armistice of 1940. The Edgar Brandt engineers, having been evacuated to the United Kingdom, joined ongoing anti-tank ammunition development efforts there, culminating in significant improvements to the concept and its realisation. Whilst the adoption of the sabot improved the performance of the ammunition, the retention of the sabot until impact contributed additional drag that caused the performance of the shot to fall off dramatically with increasing range. What was needed was a sabot that could be discarded after leaving the barrel so that the smaller, heavier, sub-projectile could carry on at the much higher velocity imparted to the whole round while suffering less drag due to the smaller diameter and hence lower frontal area. The resulting APDS - the 'D' standing for 'discarding', projectile type was developed in the United Kingdom between 1941–1944 by Permutter and Coppock, two designers with the Armaments Research Department (ARD). In mid-1944 the APDS projectile was introduced into service for the UK's QF 6 pounder anti-tank gun and later in September 1944 for the QF 17 pounder anti-tank gun. The reason for the development of the APDS was the search for anti-tank projectiles with increased penetrating performance. It was known that high impact (terminal) velocity, or a larger diameter projectile would be required to improve penetration. A larger projectile would require a completely new weapon system and may have been too heavy to retrofit onto existing armoured fighting vehicles. Increasing the velocity of the current projectiles was also a problem due to the impact velocity limitations of steel armour-piercing (AP) projectiles, which would shatter at velocities above about 850 m/s when uncapped. A diagram of a fin stabilised discarding sabot showing its operation. To allow increased impact velocity, a stronger penetrator material was required. The chosen new penetrator material was tungsten carbide (WC), due to its greater hardness and its ability to withstand the greater shock and pressure generated during a higher velocity impact. As the density of WC (≈15.7 g/cm³) is twice that of steel (≈7.86 g/cm³), such a shot was too heavy at full bore to be accelerated to a sufficient muzzle velocity. To overcome this, a lightweight full diameter carrier shell was developed to sheathe the inner high density core. The name given to this projectile type was the Armour-Piercing Composite Rigid (APCR). The APCR projectile was about half the weight of a standard AP shot, but of the same diameter. Due to the large surface area for the gases to impinge upon the lightweight APCR projectile, it experienced a higher average acceleration in the gun barrel, in turn imparting a higher muzzle velocity. Unfortunately the low sectional density of the APCR resulted in poor carrying power (high aerodynamic drag), losing velocity and penetration rapidly over distance. To overcome these limitations the British devised a way for the outer sheath to be discarded after leaving the bore. The name given to the discarded outer sheath was the sabot (a French word for a wooden shoe). For APDS projectiles the sabot is also known as a pot, as the sabot resembles a flower pot in shape. The APDS has the advantages of the lightweight projectile with regards to bore acceleration and high muzzle velocity, but does not suffer from the high drag of the APCR in flight.  Sabot construction  The sabot of a large calibre APDS consists of a light high strength alloy full diameter pot and base unit, which is screwed together. The front part of the pot has 3-4 petals (sabots) which are covered with a centering band (often a nylon derivative). The rear half has a rubber obturator and driving band (again nylon) held in place by the screw-in base unit. The base unit, if a tracer element is attached to the sub-projectile, has a hole located at the centre. Before firing, the sub-projectile and sabot are locked together. Due to the high setback forces (g-forces), friction between the pot and sub-projectile allows spin to be transferred, thus stabilising the sub-projectile. Small/medium calibre APDS use a lightweight high strength alloy base pot and three or more plastic petals. To transfer the spin to the core in small/medium calibre weapons, the core tends to have a notch at its base. Under bore acceleration, which can be higher than 100,000 g, the uneven base is forced into the softer pot material, locking the sub- projectile to the pot and imparting spin. Not all small/medium calibre APDS rely on this technique, another method for spin coupling is by using the forward plastic petals. The petals are of a slightly larger diameter than the lands in the rifled bore. This forces the petals tightly against the core, increasing the friction between them and allowing the spin to be transferred.  Sub-projectile construction  The sub-projectile consists of a high density core with a penetrating cap, enclosed within a high strength sheath (steel) with a lightweight alloy (aluminum-magnesium alloy) ballistic cap. For modern small/medium calibre APDS projectiles, the core is not sheathed and the ballistic and penetrating caps are combined. A tracer element may be added to the APDS sub-projectile, for large calibre weapons this is part of the outer sheath, for small/medium calibre weapons it is contained within a hollow cavity in, or attached to, the base of the core. Most modern APDS projectiles use high strength shock resistant tungsten alloys. The main constituent is tungsten, alloyed or sintered with/to cobalt, copper, iron or nickel. Very few APDS use depleted uranium (DU) titanium alloy for the penetrator material, though the retired 20 mm MK149-2 Phalanx round did use DU.  Sabot discard  When a large calibre APDS is fired and while still within the bore, the setback forces shear the forward petals, partly unlocking the sub-projectile from the sabot, but still holding it rigidly within the pot. Gas pressure is used to delay the unlocking of the pins holding the rear part of the sub- projectile by gyroscopic forces. Once outside the barrel, the pins, centering band and forward petals are released or discarded by projectile spin, the aerodynamic drag removes the pot/base unit. As an APDS sub-projectile does not require driving bands and the core is supported at the base and ogive region, a far more aerodynamic projectile shape can be chosen. This, in combination with the sub-projectiles' higher sectional density, gives the resulting sub- projectile vastly reduced aerodynamic drag in comparison to the APCR. Both the higher initial velocity and the reduced drag result in high velocity at impact. This also lowers flight time and improves accuracy. Accuracy can suffer if there are unwanted sabot/sub-projectile interactions during discard.  Impact example  The sequence upon impact of the APDS projectile, for example the 120 mm L11, as used on the Chieftain tank, fired L15 APDS (muzzle velocity 1370 m/s), goes as follows: the lightweight ballistic cap is crushed, the penetrating cap then strikes the armour, distributing the shock across the whole surface of the core's nose, reducing the initial shock experienced by the core. The steel sheath surrounding the core peels away, and the core goes on to penetrate the armour. The penetration of the L15 APDS is approximately 355 mm of rolled homogeneous armour at 1000 m.  FAPDS  Many newer medium calibre APDS cores use a frangible high density alloy, the resulting projectiles are called Frangible Armour Piercing Discarding Sabot (FAPDS) for APDS types, or FRAP (Frangible Armour Piercing) for full-calibre projectiles. During penetration, a frangible projectile's core fragments into many high- velocity pieces. The effect of a frangible projectile on a lightly armoured target is much the same as a high explosive incendiary round, but with a cloud of dense, high-velocity fragments penetrating deeper into the target's interior. Upon striking heavy armour the effect of FAPDS is more akin to a standard APDS, albeit with higher fragmentation of the core, and hence lethality if the armour is perforated. FAPDS is also known as a Penetrator with Enhanced Lateral Effect (PELE).

While located outside the Melbourne metropolitan area, it is the second busiest of the four airports serving the state capital in passenger traffic. It is located north-east of the Geelong CBD and south-west of the Melbourne CBD. The airport is operated by Avalon Airport Australia Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of logistics company Linfox. Avalon is currently served by passenger airline Jetstar Airways, which began domestic flights in 2004. AirAsia X began direct international flights between Avalon Airport and Kuala Lumpur on 5 December 2018. The airport is also the site of the biennial Australian International Airshow. Unlike Melbourne Airport, Avalon Airport is not governed by the Commonwealth Airports Act. The airport has a single runway in addition to a helipad. History The airport is located on land of the original indigenous owners, the Wathaurong people,From Duck Ponds to Lara, by Lara Heritage Festival Committee, 2004 and a scatter stone area is preserved on the Avalon Airport site, out of respect for the original owners.Avalon Airport Draft Environment Plan 2013 The land has undergone many changes over the past century. In the beginning, the airport was a sheep and cattle farm and homestead, founded by James Austin, an immigrant from Glastonbury, Somerset, England. James established his farm and named the homestead \\"Avalon\\" after the isle of Avalon at Glastonbury, the mythical island in the Arthurian legend. In 1952 the Commonwealth Government bought at Avalon for just 110 pounds, as the land was deemed to be of poor quality farmland due to the abundance of volcanic rock littering the surface.From Duckponds to Lara, published by the Lara Heritage Festival, 2004, edited by Mary Budd, Caroline Delaney and John Grainger The airport was opened in 1953, to cater for the production of military aircraft. Previously, the Government Aircraft Factories at Fisherman's Bend, Melbourne had used a runway beside the factory. However, newer jet aircraft required a longer runway for safe operations, and the Fisherman's Bend runway was being encroached upon by development. A runway was built by Country Roads Board, with the first plane landing on 3 April 1953 – a four-engined Avro Lincoln heavy bomber flown from Fishermans Bend. The English Electric Canberra light bomber was under construction at same time at the new airport. In 1959, Qantas established a training base at the site. In 1961, Government Aircraft Factories combined with The Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation, and built and serviced 110 Mirage fighters at the site, and in 1970 Jindivik Target Aircraft transferred to Avalon Airport from Fishermen's Bend, adding production of 170 Nomad and 75 Hornet military jets, in addition to servicing of other jets. In 1985 the Government Aircraft Factories changed its name to Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA). Aircraft produced during this time included the CAC Sabre jet fighter, GAF Jindivik remotely piloted aircraft, and Nomad civil aircraft. Under the ASTA banner, engines for the Dassault Mirage III jet fighters were produced, as well as assembly of the F/A-18 multirole combat aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). In October 1988, the ASTA Aircraft Services division took the first Boeing 747 to Avalon for servicing and maintenance. By December 1993, fifty 747 aircraft had been through the Avalon facility, and 820 people were employed at the site. October 1995 saw a Cathay Pacific Lockheed L-1011 flown to Avalon for scrapping by ASTA Aircraft Services, in what was a one off event. Training of pilots from Japan's All Nippon Airways commenced at the airport on 8 September 1993. On 27 June 1995 Aerospace Technologies of Australia was privatised by the Commonwealth Government, selling the aircraft divisions to Rockwell Australia Limited, and the airport operations to Avalon Airport Geelong Pty Ltd. The ASTA airliner overhauling facility was closed in 1997. The first scheduled passenger flights out of the airport were operated by Hazelton Airlines, who commenced flights between Avalon Airport and Sydney in February 1995. 36-seat Saab 340 aircraft were used for the service. The service was discontinued after a short time due to a lack of passengers. Aircraft hangars at the airport. The tail of VH-EBU Nalanji Dreaming can be seen in the second hangar. Post-privatisation In 1997, the federal Government of Australia, through the Department of Defence, granted Linfox a 50-year plus a 49-year option lease of the airport. Between 1997 and 2001 Linfox developed proposals to develop the land which formed the basis of the Avalon Airport Master Plan draft, 2013. In 1992, the airport began hosting the Australian International Airshow. On 1 June 2004, Jetstar started commercial flights from the airport, in addition to their operations at Melbourne Airport. In April 2010, Tigerair Australia announced it would base two aircraft and commence operations from Avalon later that year. By June 2011 however, Tigerair Australia announced it would be withdrawing several flights from Avalon, to be operated instead from Melbourne Airport. The remaining Tigerair Australia services were withdrawn after a series of incidents that led to airline's operations being suspended by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the following month. In October 2012, the Federal Government announced that the airport's lease would be amended, allowing for the construction of a new terminal and the implementation of international flights. Avalon is the second airport in Victoria to be designated as a port of entry for freight operations.  International flights  It was announced on 4 February 2018 that AirAsia X would move their Melbourne Airport operations to Avalon Airport by the end of the year.

Future =Airport Master Plan 2015= The Avalon Airport Master Plan was prepared by Avalon Airport Pty Ltd in September 2015 and was endorsed by the Department of Defence. The document provides for a significant expansion of the airport's operations, as well as the establishment of non-aviation related developments. =Proposed rail connection= On 3 May 2011, the Victorian Minister for Public Transport committed $3 million for the planning of a rail link to Avalon Airport. In January 2013, three route options were presented. The railway line would start by running along the existing Geelong-Melbourne heavy rail corridor, and then divert towards Avalon Airport, south of Little River, at one of three locations. The eastern option would see the line break away closer to Melbourne, near Cherry Swamp Road and Little River. The central option would place the diversion 2.5 kilometres southwest, near Peak School Road at Lara. The western route option would divert from the existing line closer to Geelong, at Plains Road, Lara. Each of the three routes would run over the Princes Freeway, north east of the Beach Road interchange at Little River, running under the flight path to a new station inside the terminal. The government would need to acquire private farmland to complete the link and is considering a number different options, including a light rail service, automated driverless trains used at several international airports. On 4 August 2013, the state government indicated that it may alter its election promise to build the $250 million train line to Avalon Airport, and instead create a cheaper light rail link from Melbourne's south-west. Department documents show the government is now considering other options to meet interim demand, such as light rail, buses, or \\"driverless transport options which are used at many airports around the world\\". Facilities Since the introduction of Jetstar in 2004, the Avalon Airport terminal facilities have expanded from the original size of to nearly . Over $100 million has been invested in the airport thus far to complete the following: * An apron expansion to accommodate a further four aircraft as well as enable the opportunity to accommodate an aircraft the size of a Boeing 747. * A total of seven A320 sized aircraft can now be parked simultaneously in front of the airport terminal. * Installation of a flight information display system * Fuel farm expansion to triple storage capacity from 500,000 to 1,500,000 litres of A1 jet fuel plus installation of new fuel pipelines * Construction of a new bus, taxi and hire car road and various rerouted roads to manage incoming passenger traffic and other road infrastructure upgrades * Fuel farm electrical maintenance and demolition of unused buildings * Significant infrastructure upgrades as part of the Australian International Airshow  Passenger terminal  The current terminal facility is approximately in area and houses four gates capable of servicing aircraft up to and including the size of the Airbus A321. In its present configuration, the terminal can accommodate around six domestic departures per hour. The airport has a total of eight aircraft parking bays; there are six on the Northern Apron and two on the Eastern Apron. On the Northern Apron, the airport can accommodate five Code C Aircraft (Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 aircraft) and one Boeing 747. Avalon Airport can accommodate two Boeing 747s or two Boeing 787s on the Eastern Apron. The Eastern Apron is also a remote parking bay which doubles as a freight bay. The Airport is capable of fitting one Airbus A380 at a time on the Eastern Apron; this means it can also accommodate the freighter version of Boeing's new 747-8, which is slightly smaller. Currently the airport terminal is not equipped with aerobridges, and does not feature any guest lounges. Freight facilities The most notable freight operations include the Melbourne Formula 1 Grand Prix, V8 Supercars and Superbikes, plus some specialist charters including livestock race horses, fresh produce, military hardware, touring rock bands. The airport can facilitate loads on all aircraft types from the Airbus 380 series down, with equipment available to load via the main deck, lower deck, nose or tail end of the Aircraft, with a maximum lift of 16 tonnes. It has three dedicated freighter parking positions: Two on its Eastern and one on the Northern Freighter Aprons. Aircraft heavy maintenance Avalon Airport has six hangars in total: of hangar space, including three Boeing 747 hangars. Three of these are customised B747 hangars that were used by Qantas. The Qantas Engineering maintenance facility commenced operations on 13 May 1998. It was also responsible for the Qantas Group's aircraft commercial project work, including cabin reconfigurations and refurbishment. The Avalon Maintenance Facility was the first in Australia to develop and carry out a program for converting B737-300 passenger aircraft to freighters for Australian Air Express operations and was responsible for the modification of the new Premium Economy product for Qantas' B747-400 fleet. In 2012, Qantas announced that it would phase out operations at Avalon Airport, making the hangars available for other businesses. Airlines and destinations Other uses In July 2013, it was proposed by Geelong City Council that a theme park be built at Avalon, and they have held discussions with Village Roadshow and other companies concerning the proposal. African Safari World was a previous proposal at nearby Werribee Zoo that did not get approved. The biennial Australian International Airshow operates from Avalon Airport. The project is owned by Aviation Development Australia Limited. The event attracts a total attendance of over 195,000 across the six days, including exhibitors from the international aerospace industry and government, military, scientific and trade delegates. Ground transportation Car Avalon Airport is linked to Geelong and Melbourne by the adjacent Princes Freeway. The airport has 1,500 airport car spaces, a taxi rank and a ride-share pick-up/drop-off bay. Coach In 2017, Skybus launched services from the Melbourne CBD and Geelong to Avalon Airport. Accidents and incidents *On 6 August 1976, a prototype N24 Nomad crashed shortly after takeoff at Avalon while a flight test of modifications to the tail of the aircraft. Two of the three crew members were killed in the accident, notably including pilot Stuart Pearce, father of actor Guy Pearce. *A serious incident involving a Tiger Airways Australia Airbus A320 flight from Sydney occurred on 30 June 2011 when the crew performed a missed approach at Avalon outside of published procedures, resulting in the aircraft overflying the Geelong suburb of Leopold at a dangerously low altitude, without guidance from Air Traffic Control. The incident made national headlines and triggered a five-week grounding of the airline over a busy school holiday period while a safety audit was conducted by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

The origin of the poem was an eighty-five line long poem written in 1926, after Williams had read and been influenced by James Joyce's novel Ulysses. As he continued writing lyric poetry, Williams spent increasing amounts of time on Paterson, honing his approach to it both in terms of style and structure. While The Cantos of Ezra Pound and The Bridge by Hart Crane could be considered partial models, Williams was intent on a documentary method that differed from both these works, one that would mirror \\"the resemblance between the mind of modern man and the city.\\" While Williams might or might not have said so himself, commentators such as Christoper Beach and Margaret Lloyd have called Paterson his response to T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land and Pound's Cantos. The long gestation time of Paterson before its first book was published was due in large part to Williams's honing of prosody outside of conventional meter and his development of an overall structure that would stand on a par with Eliot and Pound yet remain endemically American, free from past influences and older forms. The poem is composed of five books and a fragment of a sixth book. The five books of Paterson were published separately in 1946, 1948, 1949, 1951 and 1958, and the entire work collected under one cover in 1963. A revised edition was released in 1992. This corrected a number of printing and other textual errors in the original, especially discrepancies between prose citations in their original sources and how they appeared in Williams's poem. Paterson is set in Paterson, New Jersey, whose long history allowed Williams to give depth to the America he wanted to write about, and the Paterson Falls, which powered the town's industry, became a central image and source of energy for the poem. Background Initial Efforts In 1926, influenced by his reading of the novel Ulysses by James Joyce, William Carlos Williams wrote an 85-line poem entitled \\"Paterson\\"; this poem subsequently won the Dial Award.Mariani, pp. 204, 263. His intent in this poem was to do for Paterson, New Jersey what Joyce had done for Dublin, Ireland, in Ulysses.Mariani, p. 263. Williams wrote, \\"All that I am doing (dated) will go into it.\\"As quoted in Mariani, p. 263. In July 1933, he reattempted the theme in an 11-page prose poem, \\"Life Along the Passaic River.\\"Mariani, pp. 343–4. By 1937, Williams felt he had enough material to start a large-scale poem on Paterson but realized that the project would take considerable time to complete.Mariani, pp. 387–8. Moreover, his then-busy medical practice precluded his attempting such a project at that time. This did not stop Williams from taking some preliminary steps in the meanwhile. He wrote the poem \\"Paterson, Episode 17\\" in 1937 and would recycle it into the major work 10 years later.Mariani, p. 414. \\"Morning,\\" written in 1938, was another poem intended for Paterson.Mariani, p. 415. In 1939, Williams sent James Laughlin at New Directions Publishing an 87-page sheaf of poems labeled \\"Detail and Parody for the Poem Paterson.\\" This collection as such was not published.Mariani, pp. 417–18. However, 15 of its \\"details,\\" titled \\"For the Poem Patterson [spelling Williams]\\" appeared in the collection The Broken Span, which New Directions released in 1941.Mariani, p. 445. Addressing The Waste Land One reason Williams deliberated on Paterson was his longstanding concern about the poem The Waste Land by T.S. Eliot, which with its overall tone of disillusionment had tapped into a much larger sense of cultural ennui that had arisen in the aftermath of World War I and become a touchstone for the Lost Generation.Mariani, p. 191. As Margaret Lloyd states in her critical reappraisal of Paterson, \\"many critics and poets indicate their poetical inclinations by aligning themselves specifically with T.S. Eliot or William Carlos Williams, and ... Paterson was, from its very conception, intended to be a 'detailed reply' (SL, 239) to the Eliot bias of modern poetry.\\"Lloyd, 23. To Williams, Eliot \\"had moved into a vacuum with his poem,\\" in Mariani's words, and taken American poetry with it. Moreover, Eliot's use of conventional meter (though varied in places by speech rhythms) did not seem endemic to American speech and thus seemed outside the course that American poetry had seemed headed since the poetry of Walt Whitman.Layng, p. 187; Mariani, p. 191. For American poetry (and by extension his own work) to progress, Williams argued, it needed to move away from foreign traditions and classic forms and essentially find its own way.Holsapple, 84. Hart Crane, with whom Williams was in contact, had felt similarly about The Waste Land.Mariani, p. 250. However, Williams dismissed Crane's reaction to The Waste Land, his long poem The Bridge, as \\"a direct step backward to the bad poetry of any age but especially to that triumphant regression [French symbolism] which followed Whitman and imitates...the Frenchman [Mallarmé] and came to a head in T.S. Eliot excellently.\\"As quoted in Mariani, p. 328, comments in brackets Mariani. Williams also studied The Cantos by Ezra Pound, the first 30 parts of which appeared in 1931. While Williams noted that Pound, in Mariani's words, \\"had managed to lift the language to new heights,\\" he had also \\"deformed the natural order of speech at times...while somehow saving the excellences and even the forms of old.\\"Mariani, pp. 311–12. Developing Form and Method Williams, according to Mariani, concluded that tackling Paterson meant \\"to find a way beyond Eliot's poetic, and beyond Pound's, as well...in sculpting the words themselves, words with hard, concrete, denotative jagged edges.\\" At the same time, the New Jersey dialect the poet wanted to set into verse could sound, as biographer Paul Mariani phrases it, \\"unrelievedly flat.\\"Mariani, p. 418. In a note that accompanied the \\"Detail and Parody\\" manuscript he sent to New Directions, Williams told Laughlin and his associate Jim Higgins, \\"They are not, in some ways, like anything I have written before but rather plainer, simpler, more crudely cut...I too have to escape from my own modes.\\" The formal solution eluded Williams into the early 1940s. In December 1943, he wrote Laughlin, \\"I write and destroy, write and destroy. [Paterson is] all shaped up on outline and intent, the body of the thinking is finished but the technique, the manner and the method are unresolvable to date.\\"As quoted in Mariani, p. 486. Finding a form of American vernacular that would facilitate poetic expression, which approximated speech rhythms but avoided the regularity of their patterns as both Joyce and Walt Whitman had done, proved a long trial-and-error process.Layne, p. 188; Mariani, pp. 418–19. This period proved doubly frustrating as Williams became impatient with his progress; he wanted to \\"really go to work on the ground and dig up a Paterson that would be a true Inferno.\\"As quoted in Mariani, p. 419. Williams also studied Pound's Cantos for clues on how to structure the large work he had in mind. Muriel Rukeyser's US1 also caught Williams' attention for its use, with a technical skill that seemed to rival Pound's in The Cantos, of such diverse and seemingly prosaic materials as notes from a congressional investigation, an X-ray report and a physician's testimony on cross- examination.Mariani, p. 417. He wrote to fellow poet Louis Zukofsky, \\"I've begun to think about poetic form again. So much has to be thought out and written out there before we can have any solid criticism and consequently well-grounded work here.\\"As quoted in Mariani, p. 418. In 1944, Williams read a poem by Byron Vazakas in Partisan Review that would help lead him to solutions in form and tone for Paterson. Vazakas had written to Williams before the poem had appeared. Williams now wrote Vazakas, praising him for the piece and urging him to collect some of his work into a book. He also asked to see more of Vazakas's work as soon as possible. According to Mariani, the way Vazakas combined \\"a long prose line\\" and \\"a sharply defined, jagged-edged stanza\\" to stand independent of each other yet remain mutually complementary suggested a formal solution.Mariani, p. 492. Williams also found an \\"extension, a loosening up\\" in tone in Vazakas's poems—an approach Williams would find seconded in the poem \\"America\\" by Russell Davenport in Life Magazine that November.Mariani, pp. 499–500. Between these works and Williams's own continued efforts, he hit upon what Mariani calls the \\"new conversational tone—authoritative, urbane, assured\\" that Williams sought for his large-scale work.Mariani, p. 500. By late June 1944, Williams was working in earnest on the notes he had accumulated for Paterson, \\"gradually arranging and rearranging the stray bits with the more solid sections\\" as he approached a \\"first final draft\\" of what would become Paterson I.As quoted in Mariani, pp. 492–3. In his preface to the revised edition of Paterson, editor Christopher MacGowan points out that, even with Williams' protracted challenges in finalizing the poem's form, he \\"seems to have always felt close to the point of solving his formal problems.\\"MacGowan, p. xi. He promised it to Laughlin for the Spring 1943 book list of New Directions. He told Laughlin April 1944 that Paterson was \\"near finished\\" and nine months later that it was \\"nearing completion.\\"As quoted in MacGowan, p. xi. Even after he had received the galley proofs of Book I in September 1945, Williams was dissatisfied and revised the work extensively. This delayed its appearance in print to June 1946. Composition Williams saw the poet as a type of reporter who relays the news of the world to the people. He prepared for the writing of Paterson in this way: The Poetry Foundation's biography on Williams notes the following source: > With roots in his [short] 1926 poem [also entitled] \\"Paterson,\\" Williams > took the city as \\"my 'case' to work up. It called for a poetry such as I did > not know, it was my duty to discover or make such a context on the > 'thought'.\\"Poetry Foundation biography on Williams While writing the poem, Williams struggled to find ways to incorporate the real world facts obtained during his research in preparation for its writing. On a worksheet for the poem, he wrote, \\"Make it factual (as the Life is factual-almost casual-always sensual-usually visual: related to thought)\\". Williams considered, but ultimately rejected, putting footnotes into the work describing some facts. Still, the style of the poem allowed for many opportunities to incorporate 'factual information', including portions of his own correspondence with the American poet Marcia Nardi and fellow New Jersey poet Allen Ginsberg as well as historical letters and articles concerning figures from Paterson's past (like Sam Patch and Mrs. Cumming) that figure thematically into the poem.Bollard (1975), p. 320 Response The Poetry Foundation biography on Williams notes the following critical response to Williams' Modernist epic: > [Williams biographer James] Breslin reported \\"reception of the poem never > exactly realized his hopes for it.\\" Paterson's mosaic structure, its subject > matter, and its alternating passages of poetry and prose helped fuel > criticism about its difficulty and its looseness of organization. In the > process of calling Paterson an \\"'Ars Poetica' for contemporary America,\\" > Dudley Fitts complained, \\"it is a pity that those who might benefit most > from it will inevitably be put off by its obscurities and difficulties.\\" > Breslin, meanwhile, accounted for the poem's obliqueness by saying, > \\"Paterson has a thickness of texture, a multi-dimensional quality that makes > reading it a difficult but intense experience.\\" Poet/critic Randall Jarrell praised Book I of the poem with the following assessment: > Paterson (Book I) seems to me the best thing William Carlos Williams has > ever written. . .the organization of Paterson is musical to an almost > unprecedented degree. . . how wonderful and unlikely that this extraordinary > mixture of the most delicate lyricism of perception and feeling with the > hardest and homeliest actuality should ever have come into being! There has > never been a poem more American.Jarrell, Randall. \\"Paterson by William > Carlos Williams.\\" No Other Book: Selected Essays. New York: HarperCollins, > 1999. However, Jarrell was greatly disappointed with Books II, III, and IV of the poem, writing the following: > Paterson has been getting rather steadily worse [with each subsequent > Book]... All three later books are worse organized, more eccentric and > idiosyncratic, more self-indulgent, than the first. And yet that is not the > point, the real point: the poetry, the lyric rightness, the queer wit, the > improbable and dazzling perfection of so much of Book I have disappeared—or > at least, reappear only fitfully.

Biography  Born in Leipzig, Walcha was blinded at age 19 after vaccination for smallpox. Despite his disability, he entered the Leipzig Conservatory and became an assistant at the Thomaskirche to Günther Ramin, who was professor of organ at the conservatory and cantor at St. Thomas'. In 1929, Walcha accepted a position in Frankfurt am Main at the Friedenskirche and remained in Frankfurt for the rest of his life. From 1933 to 1938 he taught at the Hoch Conservatory. In 1938 he was appointed professor of organ at the Musikhochschule in Frankfurt and organist of the Dreikönigskirche in 1946. He retired from public performance in 1981 and died in Frankfurt. Walcha recorded Bach's complete works twice, once in mono (1947–52), and again in stereo from 1956 to 1971. The former (mono) cycle has been digitally re-mastered and re-issued as a 10-CD boxed set. This latter stereo cycle (released 10/09/2001), has been remastered, and repackaged in a 12-CD box. This edition also contains the recording of his own conclusion of the last fugue of The Art of Fugue - previously unreleased. Walcha's completion of the last fugue of The Art of Fugue was also recorded by his former pupil George Ritchie as part of Ritchie's recording of The Art of Fugue, released in 2010. Walcha also composed for the organ. He published four volumes of original chorale preludes (published by C. F. Peters and recorded in part by, for example, Renate MeierjürgenOPAL Libraries) as well as arrangements for organ of orchestral works written by others. He lectured on organ music and composition (illustrated by his own playing) at the Hoch Conservatory and the Frankfurt Musikhochschule. One other contribution to music scholarship is his attempted completion of the final (unfinished) fugue of The Art of Fugue. Walcha taught many significant American organists of the twentieth century who travelled to Germany as Fulbright scholars: these include Robert Anderson, David Boe, Margaret Leupold Dickinson, Melvin Dickinson, Delbert Disselhorst, Betty Louise Lumby, Paul Jordan, David Mulbury, Fenner Douglass, Jane Douglass, Ray P. Ferguson, Grigg and Helen Fountain, Barbara Harbach, Charles Krigbaum, J. Reilly Lewis, George Ritchie, Russell Saunders - all of whom became major teachers and performers after their studies abroad. A section of the documentary film Desert Fugue is about Walcha, and explains how he memorised music part by part, and passed on this method of learning counterpoint to his pupils.

It occurs as black incrustations, dark to pale-brown in thin section. It has a grayish-black streak. It has a brittle to conchoidal fracture. The hardness of coffinite is between 5 and 6. It was first described in 1954 for an occurrence at the La Sal No. 2 Mine, Beaver Mesa, Mesa County, Colorado, US, and named for American geologist Reuben Clare Coffin (1886–1972). It has widespread global occurrence in Colorado Plateau-type uranium ore deposits of uranium and vanadium. It replaces organic matter in sandstone and in hydrothermal vein type deposits. It occurs in association with uraninite, thorite, pyrite, marcasite, roscoelite, clay minerals and amorphous organic matter. Composition Coffinite's chemical formula is U(SiO4)1−x(OH)4x. X-ray powder patterns from samples of coffinite allowed geologists to classify it as a new mineral in 1955. A comparison to the x-ray powder pattern of zircon (ZrSiO4) and thorite (ThSiO4) was the basis for this classification. Preliminary chemical analysis indicated that the uranous silicate exhibited hydroxyl substitution. The results of Sherwood's preliminary chemical analysis were based on samples from three locations. Hydroxyl bonds and silicon-oxygen bonds also proved to exist after infrared absorption spectral analyses were performed. The hydroxyl substitution occurs as (OH)44− for (SiO4)4−. The hydroxyl constituent in coffinite later proved to be nonessential in the formation of a stable synthetic mineral. Recent electron microprobe analysis of the submicroscopic crystals uncovered an abundance of calcium, yttrium, phosphorus, and minimal lead substitutions along with traces of other rare earth elements. Crystal structure Coffinite is isostructural with the orthosilicates zircon (ZrSiO4) and thorite (ThSiO4). Stieff et al. analyzed coffinite using the x-ray powder diffraction technique and determined that it has a tetragonal structure. Occurring naturally with U4+ cations, the UO8 triangular dodecahedra coordinate with edge-sharing, alternating SiO4 tetrahedra in chains along the c-axis. The central uranium site of coffinite is surrounded by eight SiO4 tetrahedra. The lattice dimensions of naturally-occurring and synthetic coffinite are similar, with a naturally-occurring sample from Arrowhead Mine, Mesa County, Colorado having a=6.93kx, c=6.30kx, and a sample synthesized by Hoekstra and Fuchs having a=6.977kx and c=6.307kx. Physical properties Initial examination of coffinite by Stieff et al. described the mineral as black in color with an adamantine luster, indistinguishable from uraninite (UO2). Additionally, the discoverers reported that although no cleavage is seen in coffinite, it does exhibit subconchoidal fracturing and is very fine grained. Initial samples showed a brittle texture and a hardness between 5 and 6, with a specific gravity of 5.1. Later samples from Woodrow Mine in New Mexico collected by Moench showed fibrous internal structure and exceptional crystallization. A polished thin section of coffinite has a brown color and shows anisotropic transmission of light. Optical analysis yielded a refractive index of about 1.74. Geological occurrence Coffinite was first discovered in sedimentary uranium deposits in the Colorado Plateau region, but has also been discovered in sedimentary uranium deposits and hydrothermal veins in many other locations. Samples of coffinite from the Colorado Plateau were found with black fine-grained low-valence vanadium minerals, uraninite and finely dispersed black organic material. Other materials associated with later finds from the same region were clay and quartz. In vein deposits of the Copper King Mine in Colorado, coffinite was also found to occur with uraninite and pitchblende. Coffinite is metastable compared to uraninite and quartz, thus formation of coffinite requires a uranium source in reducing conditions, as evidenced by the associated presence of low-valence vanadium minerals. Silica- rich solution provides such a reducing condition in cases where coffinite results as an alteration product of uraninite. Hansley and Fitzpatrick also noted that the brownish color of their coffinite samples was caused by organic material, leading them to conclude that coffinite can also form in low temperature conditions if organic carbon is present. This finding is consistent with the coffinite samples of the Colorado Plateau, which included fossilized wood. In China, coffinite can be found in granite in addition to sandstone. Hansley and Fitzpatrick concluded that coarse-grained coffinite most likely forms in high temperature environments. Coffinite and uraninite precipitate inside brecciated and fractured regions of altered granite at pressures between 500 and 800 bars and temperatures at 126 to 178 °C. Special characteristics A large percentage of the Earth's uranium supply is contained in coffinite deposits,Deditius, Arthur P., Utsunomiya, Satoshi, Ewing, Rodney C. (2008) The Chemical Stability of Coffinite, USiO4 Center Dot NH(2)O; 0 < N < 2, Associated With Organic Matter: A Case Study from Grants Uranium Region, New Mexico, USA. Chemical Geology, 251, 33-49. which is significant because of uranium's use in nuclear energy. Sedimentary deposits contain the most radioactive samples, as evidenced by the intensely radioactive coffinite found in the Colorado Plateau. Researchers at Harvard University, the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and several other institutions attempted unsuccessfully to synthesize coffinite in the mid-1950s after its initial discovery. In 1956, Hoekstra and Fuchs managed to create stable samples of synthetic coffinite. All of this research was conducted for the United States Atomic Energy Commission.

She previously served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dún Laoghaire constituency from 1987 to 1989.Encyclopedia of International Media and Communications, Donald H. Johnston, In 1982, Kennedy's telephone, along with those of two other journalists, was tapped by former Minister for Justice Seán Doherty. The revelation in 1992 that Charles Haughey had ordered the phone taps led to Haughey's resignation as Taoiseach. Early career Kennedy studied at Dublin Institute of Technology and began her journalistic career with a regional newspaper, the Munster Express. She moved to the Cork Examiner after less than a year, but spent only a few years there before joining The Irish Times.John Horgan: Irish media: a critical history since 1922. Routledge 2001. On the foundation of the Sunday Tribune in 1980, Kennedy joined it as the paper's political correspondent. The paper's publisher, John Mulcahy, had become familiar with Kennedy when she had contributed to his journal Hibernia. When the Tribune briefly ceased production, Kennedy moved to the Sunday Press. Early in 1987, Kennedy successfully sued the incumbent Charles Haughey-led Fianna Fáil government for illegally tapping her phone. Political career Kennedy stood in the 1987 general election as a candidate for the newly formed Progressive Democrat party in Dún Laoghaire. She came third in the poll, winning 9.4% of the first-preference vote. She was one of fourteen Progressive Democrat TDs elected to Dáil Éireann in that election — a feat the party never achieved again. Kennedy was appointed the party's spokesperson for foreign affairs.Maedhbh McNamara, Paschal Mooney: Women in Parliament, Ireland, 1918–2000, Wolfhound Press, Ireland. She stood again in the 1989 general election and won 9% of the first-preference vote but failed to retain her seat. Return to journalism Following her election defeat, Kennedy returned to The Irish Times, then edited by Conor Brady, whom she had worked with at the Tribune when he was the editor. She avoided party-political journalism for several years, but she returned to covering politics in the early 1990s, and became The Irish Times' political editor in 1999. She became the newspaper's first female editor upon the departure of Conor Brady in late 2002. One of her rivals for the editor's chair was the paper's high-profile columnist, Fintan O'Toole.Fintan O'Toole: Ship of fools: how stupidity and corruption sank the Celtic Tiger. Faber and Faber, 2009. Kennedy was paid more than the editor of Britain's top non-tabloid newspaper The Daily Telegraph, which has a circulation of about nine times that of The Irish Times. Later columnist Fintan O'Toole told the Sunday Independent: \\"We as a paper are not shy of preaching about corporate pay and fat cats but with this there is a sense of excess. Some of the sums mentioned are disturbing. This is not an attack on Ms Kennedy, it is an attack on the executive level of pay. There is double- standard of seeking more job cuts while paying these vast salaries.\\" In September 2006, Kennedy approved the publication of an article in The Irish Times giving confidential details of investigations being made into payments purported to have been made in 1993 to Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. Kennedy refused, upon request of the investigating Tribunal, to provide details of the source of the printed information. She responded that the documents had since been destroyed. Her refusal caused the Tribunal to seek High Court orders compelling her to provide details of the source. On 23 October 2007, the High Court granted the orders compelling her to go before the Tribunal and answer all questions. In its judgment, the High Court, criticising her decision to destroy the documents, said it was an \\"astounding and flagrant disregard of the rule of law\\".The Irish Times book of the year, Volume 2007. Gill & Macmillan, Dublin, 2007 In 2009, however, the Supreme Court overturned this ruling, holding that the High Court had not struck the correct balance between the journalists’ right to protect their source and the tribunal's right to confidentiality. Kennedy announced on 12 March 2011 her intention to retire from The Irish Times by September, after a nine-year term as editor. She actually retired in June, and was succeeded by news editor, Kevin O'Sullivan, who succeeded her as editor on 23 June 2011. In August 2012, she was appointed Adjunct Professor of Journalism at the University of Limerick. She has been awarded five honorary doctorates from Irish universities.

It consists of panellists singing the lyrics of one song to the tune of another song, accompanied on the piano. The four original panellists were adept at this game, and each took an individual turn. Since the death of Willie Rushton guest panellists have appeared, and the two team members occasionally sing together, presumably to compensate for the unsteadiness of a guest's voice. Guest panellists sometimes exhibit little or no musical talent - most notably the late Jeremy Hardy, whose dreadful attempts at singing were greatly anticipated by audiences - often to great comedic effect. The panellists also sometimes impersonate a singer associated with one of the songs (usually the tune). In several episodes, Graeme Garden was given a song with a tune by Bob Dylan and not only impersonated him, but broke off into a harmonica solo. Notably \\"How much is that Doggy in the Window\\", to \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\". The game has been played in several Christmas specials (requiring \\"One Carol to the Tune of Something Else\\" — in particular, singing \\"Silent Night\\" to the tune of \\"Tequila\\"), and a variant was played in the 2007 special Humph In Wonderland, in which panellists sang a Lewis Carroll poem to the tune of a song. Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden sang \\"Jabberwocky\\" to the tune of \\"Jerusalem\\", and Andy Hamilton and Rob Brydon sang \\"You Are Old, Father William\\" to the tune of \\"I Know Him So Well\\". Occasionally, some of the panellists imitate backing singers for the panellist actually singing when there is a suitable gap in the song, such as one of the 2009 episodes hosted by Jack Dee, where Barry Cryer and Graeme Garden backed Tim Brooke-Taylor. Songs used Some of the humour derives from the incongruity caused by differences between the songs involved. They may differ wildly in genre, structure, tempo, and time signature, but unlikely combinations have sometimes worked surprisingly well. Having the same metre helps. Examples include: *Barry Cryer singing \\"Love Me Tender\\" to the theme tune from The Archers *Richard Ormandy singing “Hurt” by Nine Inch Nails to the tune of \\"If I only had A Brain\\" *Barry Cryer singing \\"Old MacDonald Had a Farm\\" to the tune of \\"One\\" from A Chorus Line *Barry Cryer singing \\"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\\" and \\"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\\" to the tune of \\"The Can-Can\\". *Barry Cryer singing \\"My Old Man's a Dustman\\" to the tune of \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" *Barry Cryer singing \\"Roxanne\\" by The Police to the tune of \\"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\\". *Barry Cryer singing \\"Hanky Panky\\" by Madonna to the tune of \\"Good King Wenceslas\\". *Barry Cryer singing \\"I Predict a Riot\\" by the Kaiser Chiefs to the tune of \\"A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square\\" *Graeme Garden singing \\"Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick\\" and \\"Mr. Boombastic\\" to the tune of \\"'O Sole Mio\\" *Graeme Garden singing \\"Blame It on the Boogie\\" to the tune of The Battle Hymn of the Republic *Graeme Garden singing \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" to the tune of \\"Greensleeves\\" *Graeme Garden singing \\"Ain't Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)\\" to the tune of \\"Jerusalem\\" *Graeme Garden singing \\"Incy Wincy Spider\\", \\"Remember You're a Womble\\", \\"I'm Too Sexy\\" and \\"The Gummy Bear Song\\" to the tune of the \\"Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves\\" from Verdi's Nabucco. *Graeme Garden singing \\"My Way\\" by Paul Anka and \\"Thriller\\" by Michael Jackson to the tune of \\"The Liberty Bell March\\" (also known on the show as the theme from Monty Python). *Graeme Garden singing \\"Sorry Seems to Be the Hardest Word\\" and \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" to the tune of \\"I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside\\". *Graeme Garden singing \\"Evil Has No Boundaries\\" by Slayer to the tune of \\"Wonderful Copenhagen\\" *Graeme Garden singing \\"My Old Man's a Dustman\\" to the tune of \\"La vie en rose\\" *Graeme Garden singing \\"When I'm Cleaning Windows\\" to the tune of \\"Away in a Manger\\". *Graeme Garden singing \\"What Does The Fox Say?\\" by Ylvis to the tune of \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\" *Graeme Garden singing \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\" by Procol Harum to the tune of \\"When I'm Cleaning Windows\\". *Tim Brooke-Taylor singing \\"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\\" to the \\"Dance of the Hours\\" from La Gioconda by Amilcare Ponchielli *Tim Brooke-Taylor singing \\"What Shall We Do With The Drunken Sailor?\\" to the tune of \\"Tea For Two\\" *Tim Brooke-Taylor singing \\"On Mother Kelly's Doorstep\\" to the tune of \\"Hernando's Hideaway\\" *Tim Brooke-Taylor singing \\"Wannabe\\" to the tunes of \\"The Major-General's Song\\" and \\"Hark!

A contribution to the effectiveness of the rendition is made by the pianist (usually Colin Sell) who, given the uneven rhythm of the vocalists, often has a much more difficult task than is usually required from an accompanist. Introduction Additional humour is derived from the manner in which the host introduces and explains the game. The concept is actually simple, and well described by the game's title, but the chairman claims it to be complex and proceeds to give a long-winded and complicated \\"simple\\" explanation, which differs each time the game is played. For example: : \\"The game works like this. The teams have in front of them the words but not the music of a song which is different from another song of which they have neither the music nor the words. The tune of this second song, which is quite unlike the first song both in words and music, will be played but without the words to which the teams will substitute the other words they have from the first song which obviously will have no tune because that's made way for the tune from the other song without its words. : : \\"This might be hard to explain, so perhaps this alternative definition will help. Despite the title, each contestant will be allocated two songs, or words sung to music, but from one he will concentrate only on the lyrics while trying to disregard the tune, and from the other he will focus on the music while ignoring the words. : : \\"I know what you are thinking, which one is which? Well the first, or one song, is the set of words sung to music which no longer has the tune, and the second, or another as we know it, is the tune to some words without the lyrics but retaining the music. All you have to do is put them together, in other words -- literally -- one song to the tune of another.\\" In later episodes of ISIHAC, these monologues generally took the form of contorted analogies, ending with an extremely contrived and obvious joke at Colin Sell's expense. For example, from June 2006: : \\"A song is rather like a microscope. The vertical tube represents the tune, which carries the lenses, or words. These are assembled with precision to enable us to see the object, or hear the song. However, a song can be broken down into its component parts by separating the words from the tune, just as a microscope can have its lenses prised from the tube with pliers. :Now, I know what you're thinking, teams: wouldn't that be a case of wanton vandalism inflicted on a delicate instrument? (pause) At the piano, Colin Sell!\\" Internet-based fans have taken the silliness a step further, in true ISIHAC style, by playing the game in text-based media, such as USENET and email. Liberal use of punctuation can give readers a hint of how the metre is being applied to the lyrics. Similar examples from elsewhere Members of the Barmy Army, devoted fans of the English cricket team, are known to mock Australian cricketers and fans by singing the Australian national anthem to the tune of the nursery rhyme \\"Mary Had a Little Lamb\\", and vice versa. The Australian television comedy programme The Money or the Gun featured a different artist performing \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" every week. The Beatnix performed it to the tune of \\"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\\" and \\"Twist and Shout\\". The B-52s tribute band The Rock Lobsters performed Stairway to the tune of \\"Rock Lobster\\". Elvis impersonator Neil Pepper performed it to the tune of \\"Viva Las Vegas\\". The Australian television comedy programme Spicks and Specks features a segment \\"Substitute\\", where a panelist sings a well-known tune substituting words from an unrelated text (usually a technical text like \\"Datsun 180B Service Manual\\" or \\"2004 Australian Government Tax Pack\\"), and the remaining team-mates attempt to guess the name of the song. The host, Adam Hills sang the Australian National Anthem to the tune of the rock and roll classic, \\"Working Class Man\\", in one case accompanied by the latter's singer, Jimmy Barnes. In a 2008 stand up comedy tour, Hills performed the Dutch national anthem \\"Het Wilhelmus\\" to the tune of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\". The Scared Weird Little Guys, an Australian comedy duo, perform a similar vein of songs weekly on The Cage, the breakfast show on Triple M in Melbourne and Sydney. In their segment, \\"Stump the Scardies\\", listeners email in suggestions of songs to sing in another tune and the duo get about five minutes preparation time — usually just enough to find the guitar chords and lyrics online. This segment occurs weekly at 0845 AEST on Tuesdays. In 1989 \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic recorded \\"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\\", the lyrics of \\"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\\" (theme from The Beverly Hillbillies) to the music of the Dire Straits song \\"Money for Nothing\\". A serious example of the principle behind this game was Cliff Richard's \\"Millennium Prayer\\", in which he sang the Lord's Prayer to the tune of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" (the Clue team retaliated in the 1999 Christmas special by performing \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" to the tune of \\"Bachelor Boy\\" and vice versa). Also in recent popular culture bootlegging and bastard pop have taken this a step further, employing the practice of laying down vocals from one track over the music from another. Both \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" and \\"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\\" are examples of taking a song and writing new lyrics for the tune.

It was officially instituted on 1 November 1705 by Augustus II the Strong and bestowed on eight of his closest diplomatic and political supporters. It is awarded to the most distinguished Poles and the highest-ranking representatives of foreign countries. The Order of the White Eagle is attached to a blue ribbon slung over the left shoulder to the right side. The star of the Order, once embroidered, is worn on the left side of the chest. History 225px The badge Order of the White Eagle was originally a red enamel oval gold medal with an image of the Polish white eagle on its front side and bearing Augustus II's royal cypher over crossed swords on its reverse side worn on a light blue ribbon. This was replaced by a Maltese cross in 1709. By 1713 it was worn from the neck, with a blue sash, and a star. Although Augustus the Strong limited the number of knights to seventy-two, he only conferred the Order forty times before his death in 1733. His son, Augustus, however, awarded the Order more than three hundred times. Augustus may have been inspired to found the Order by the example of Peter the Great's recent founding of the Russian Order of Saint Andrew (of which he himself had been made one of the first knights by the Russian emperor), and above all by the example of the prestigious French Order of the Holy Spirit, with which the light blue ribbon, and the star with a bird, have a strong resemblance, and which had also inspired Peter the Great's Order of Saint Andrew. Initially the creation of the Order was strongly opposed by many of the Polish nobility since membership in the Order conferred a distinction which violated the traditional equality of all Polish nobles. Since the Order had no patron saint, Augustus II made 2 August the feast of the Order. His son, Augustus III, however, changed the Order's feast day to 3 August. After the third partitioning of Poland, in 1795, the Order was abolished, though it was renewed by 1807 and became the highest award of the Duchy of Warsaw, and after 1815 of the Kingdom of Poland, an autonomous part of the Russian Empire; it was also popular among the Russian tsars, who also conferred the Order upon themselves. After Russian troops put down the Polish uprising of 1830-31, the Order of the White Eagle was officially \\"annexed\\" by Nicholas I on 17 November 1831 and became part of the Russian Imperial honors system. The insignia of this new Imperial Russian Order of the White Eagle was modified to more closely resemble those of Russian orders. It remained in this form until the Russian Revolution of 1917, in which the Russian Empire fell. The Order of the White Eagle officially became Poland's highest decoration by act of Parliament of 4 February 1921, and the insignia was redesigned. In the interbellum the Order was awarded to 24 Polish citizens and 87 foreigners, among whom were 33 monarchs and heads of state, ten prime ministers and fifteen other ministers of state, and twelve members of royal families. After 1948, when the People's Republic of Poland came into existence, the Order of the White Eagle was no longer awarded, but it was never officially abolished. It was also used by the Polish Government in Exile. Following the collapse of communism, the Order was once again reinstated on 26 October 1992, the Polish Government in Exile having already presented the seal and archives of the Order to Lech Wałęsa, first post-communist President of Poland. The first person to be awarded the White Eagle after its reinstatement was Pope John Paul II. The President of Poland is always the Grand Master of the Order. 1713 Insignia Royal Star of Order of the White Eagle of Augustus II the Strong before 1730 Coat of Arms of Stanisław II Augustus with collana of Order of the White Eagle The 1713 badge was a Maltese cross enameled red with white borders with diamonds set in each of the balls at the eight points of the cross and with diamond set rays appearing between each of the points of the cross, i.e., a larger longer ray between each arm of the cross and a smaller ray between each of the two points of these arms. In the centre of the cross was a white enamelled eagle in high relief with spread wings and facing left and with a diamond set royal crown on its head. At the top of the cross between the two top points was a diamond studded semi-circular link through which passed a diamond studded ring through which, in turn, passed the light-blue ribbon from which it was worn. The reverse side of this Maltese cross was enamelled white with red borders and had at its center an oval gold medallion with the founder's crowned royal cypher above two crossed swords taken from his arms as the Arch-Marshall of the Holy Roman Empire. The star of the order consisted of an eight-pointed gold star with straight rays which bore a red-bordered white enamelled cross pattée with golden rays between the arms and with a golden rosette at its centre. The arms of this cross pattée bore the motto \\"Pro Fide, Lege et Rege\\" (For Faith, Law and the King) in golden letters. The King of Poland could also wear the cross from a collar of 24 alternating links of white enameled eagles, crowned and holding scepters and orbs, and dark blue enameled ovals, surrounded by gold rays, bearing alternatively full-length enamelled images of the Virgin Mary crowned, dressed in pink and pale blue and supporting the Christ Child on her left arm and holding a gold scepter in her right hand and the letters of her name, \\"MARIA\\", arranged into a stylized monogram in white enamel. This collar was made for the coronation of Stanisław II Augustus, the last King of Poland, but the coat of arms of the founder, Augustus the Strong, show the cross of the Order hanging from a collar of a very different design. Insignia during the Partitions The badge of the order consisted of a gold crowned double-headed eagle enamelled in black, with a cross superimposed upon its chest: this was a gold Maltese cross enamelled in red with white enamel outline and golden rays between the arms. A white enamel crowned eagle with spread wings, facing left (the coat-of-arms of Poland) was superimposed on the cross. On its reverse side the double-headed eagle bore in the center of its back a diminutive red-bordered white-enamelled cross pattée with a gold rosette at its center gold rays between its arms. The black double-headed eagle hung by its two crowned heads from an enamelled Russian imperial crown, which, in turn, hung from a dark blue silk moire ribbon. The star of the order consisted of an eight-pointed gold star with straight rays; the central golden disc bore a red-bordered white enamelled cross pattée with a golden rosette at its center and golden rays between the arms, surrounded by a blue enamel ring bearing the motto \\"Pro Fide, Lege et Rege\\" (For Faith, Law and the King). Insignia after 1921 Star of the modern order The badge of the order consists of a gold Maltese cross enamelled in red with white enamel outline and with golden palmette-like rays between the arms. A white enamel crowned eagle with spread wings, facing left (the coat-of-arms of Poland) is superimposed on the cross. It is worn on a plain light blue sash. This design clearly reflects a return to the essential design of the 1713 badge, but without the diamonds of the earlier badge. The reverse side of the badge bears the same Maltese Cross with golden rays as the front side and this cross bears the same design as that of the star of the order (see below), except that the arms of the cross are not enamelled red, i. e., only the outline of the cross and its central disc with its surrounding oak wreath are enamelled. The star or plaque of the order consists of an eight-pointed silver star with straight rays, with a gold Maltese cross, enamelled in red with white enamel outline and with golden palmette-like rays between the arms, superimposed upon it. The motto of the order, „Za Ojczyznę i Naród” (\\"For Fatherland and Nation\\"), appears on the arms of the cross. The central disc is in white enamel with the monogram \\"RP\\" (Rzeczpospolita Polska) surrounded by a green enamelled oak wreath.

Biography Born in St. George's, Grenada, Batson moved with his family to Trinidad at the age of 6 and then migrated from the West Indies to England when he was nine years old in 1962. Until then he had never even seen a game of football and a teacher at his school, on watching his early efforts and reflecting on his birthplace opined, \\"Well, perhaps cricket is your game.\\" However, he was signed as a schoolboy by Arsenal, and whilst at the club's academy won the FA Youth Cup of 1971. Batson signed as a professional at 17 years old at the club and eventually went on to feature for the Gunners' first team, becoming the first black player to do so. In all, he made 10 appearances for Arsenal before moving to Cambridge United in 1974. He spent four years at Cambridge, captaining the side to the Fourth Division Championship under manager Ron Atkinson in 1976–77. At Cambridge Batson made a total of 163 appearances and scored six goals altogether. When Atkinson moved to West Bromwich Albion in 1978, he successfully encouraged Batson to follow him and to team up with fellow black players Cyrille Regis and Laurie Cunningham. He then left Cambridge to transfer to West Brom in a deal worth £28,000 in all. Although not by any means the first black footballers to play professionally in England, the players nicknamed Three Degrees by Atkinson, a reference to contemporary vocal trio of the same name, were pioneering, iconic and extremely popular with West Brom's fans. This trio's fame is to such an extent that in 2012 plans were put forward for a statue of which would honor the footballing trio being purposely displayed in October 2014 at The Hawthorns. The completed statue was publicly unveiled in New Square in the town on 21 May 2019. Whilst a West Bromwich Albion player he featured in a benefit match for Len Cantello, that saw a team of white players play against a team of black players. He played 160 for the Baggies before his career was cut short in 1982 by a serious knee injury. International career He was capped three times for the England B team against the United States, Spain and Australia. Administrative career Following the end to his playing days, Batson was thereafter appointed as the deputy chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association in 1984. He then spent a total of 18 years in this position and remains as a trustee of the association. He later rejoined West Brom within the role of a managing director at the club, helping to form the West Bromwich Albion Former Players' Association in 2003. Batson in 2007, joined the body then known as the Football Licensing Agency (FLA) that's now entitled as the Sports Grounds Safety Authority. He is the longest serving member of the board of the authority. Batson was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2001 New Year Honours and Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours, both for services to football. Personal life Batson was married to Cecily, who died in September 2009.

It occurs at altitudes of 900–2,200 m on mountains with precipitation of over 1,000 mm. The current distribution of the Nordmann fir is associated with the forest refugia that existed during the Ice Age at the eastern and southern Black Sea coast. In spite of currently suitable climate, the species is not found in areas of the Eastern Greater Caucasus, which are separated from the Black Sea Coast by more than 400–500 km.  Description  It is a large evergreen coniferous tree growing to 55–61 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 2 m. In the Western Caucasus Reserve, some specimens have been reported to be and even tall, the tallest trees in the Caucasus, Anatolia, the Russian Federation and the continent of Europe. The leaves are needle-like, flattened, 1.8–3.5 cm long and 2 mm wide by 0.5 mm thick, glossy dark green above, and with two blue-white bands of stomata below. The tip of the leaf is usually blunt, often slightly notched at the tip, but can be pointed, particularly on strong-growing shoots on young trees. The cones are 10–20 cm long and 4–5 cm broad, with about 150–200 scales, each scale with an exserted bract and two winged seeds; they disintegrate when mature to release the seeds. Taxonomy The species is named by Christian von Steven after his compatriot, the Finnish zoologist Alexander von Nordmann (1803–1866), who was the director of the Odessa Botanical Gardens. Subspecies There are two subspecies (treated as distinct species by some botanists), intergrading where they meet in northern Turkey at about 36°E longitude: * Caucasian fir (Abies nordmanniana subsp. nordmanniana). Native to the Caucasus mountains and eastern Pontic Mountains of northeastern Turkey west to about 36°E. Shoots often pubescent (hairy). * Turkish fir (Abies nordmanniana subsp. bornmuelleriana). Native to northwestern Turkey, including the western Pontic Mountains as well as Uludağ and other mountains southeast of the Sea of Marmara. Often treated as a separate species, Abies bornmuelleriana.Kaya, Zeki, A. Skaggs, David Brian Neale (2008). \\"Genetic Differentiation of Abies equi-trojani (Asch. & Sint. ex Boiss) Mattf.

Turkish Journal of Botany 32 (2008) 1-10 * Trojan fir (Abies nordmanniana subsp. equi-trojani). In Turkey this subspecies is treated as a distinct species (Abies equi-trojani Asch. & Sint. ex Bois.). It is endemic to a single location on Kaz Dağı (Mount Ida) in Balıkesir Province, northwestern Turkey. This subspecies occupies an area of only 164 km2 and is assessed as \\"Endangered\\".iucnredlist.org / Abies nordmanniana ssp. equi- trojani Its shoots are usually glabrous (hairless).  Uses  The Nordmann fir is one of the most important species grown for Christmas trees, being favoured for its attractive foliage, with needles that are not sharp and do not drop readily when the tree dries out. It is also a popular ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, and along with the cultivar 'Golden Spreader' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The tree has also in Europe been used for reforestation as a way to mitigate expected forest decline caused by climate changes. The wood is soft and white, and is used for general construction, paper, etc. Gallery Abies_nordmanniana_bark_and_trunk.JPGbark and trunk in Munich botanical garden Nordmann-01.jpegChristmas tree production Abies nordmanniana.jpgFoliage References External links * theplantlist.org: Abies nordmanniana (Steven) Spach * iucnredlist.org: Abies nordmanniana ** iucnredlist.org: Abies nordmanniana ssp. nordmanniana ** iucnredlist.org: Abies nordmanniana ssp. equi-trojani * Gymnosperm Database: Abies nordmanniana * conifersaroundtheworld.com: Abies nordmanniana NBG Belgium Meise * rhs.org.uk: Abies nordmanniana * Abies nordmanniana.
