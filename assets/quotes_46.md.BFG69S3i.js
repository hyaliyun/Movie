It dates from the Roman period. The 4th century (AD) mosaic is over long. Its central panel is thought to show Bellerophon, at the court of either Iobates or Proteus, battling Chimera. Anthony Beeson, an expert on Roman mosaics, said it is \\"without question the most exciting mosaic discovery made in Britain in the last 50 years and must take a premier place amongst those Romano-British works of art that have come down to modern Britons.\\"  Discovery  The mosaic was revealed during a community archaeology project in 2017. From 2011, the project investigated three Roman sites near to the village of Boxford, which was led by the Boxford History Project, with Berkshire Archaeology Research Group, with the help of many local enthusiastic volunteers and the expertise of Senior Project Officer, Matt Nichol, who from 2013, was seconded to manage fieldwork, record the findings and help train the volunteers on behalf of Cotswold Archaeology In 2017, a villa \\"of modest size\\" was unearthed at Boxford. The mosaic was found at the eastern end of the building. Only one half of the mosaic was uncovered. It was subsequently reburied, to ensure its preservation. In 2019 the mosaic was fully uncovered, meticulously recorded and carefully backfilled upon completion.  Subject of the mosaic  Some of the most famous heroes from Greek mythology are brought to life in the stunning artwork. Hercules slays the half-man, half-horse Centaur. Pelops wins the hand of a king’s daughter by sabotaging his racing chariot. The handsome Bellerophon kills the fire-breathing Chimaera monster with the help of his flying horse Pegasus and a lance tipped with lead.

It stars Hemal Ranasinghe in the lead role, along with newcomers Chulakshi Ranathunga and Shanel Fernando. The music was composed by Chitral Somapala. It is the 1288th Sri Lankan film in the Sinhala cinema. Supporting actor Dasun Nishan committed suicide on 27 September 2017, prior to the screening of the film. The muhurath ceremony was held at Galadari Hotel, Colombo. The film has received mixed reviews from critics.  Plot  While the dancing troupe of a college was practicing for a competition, one of their members get injured. To fill up the space, the teacher decides to join Pavani who’s a very attractive girl from the junior batch and the new roommate of Vihangi who’s a leading dancer in the troupe. Vihangi is in love with a boy named Samudra who’s also a leading dancer in the troupe, but even though she gives him so many hints about that, he never seems to understand. Time flies and after they leave college everyone’s on their own separate paths of lives. Samudra becomes a famous dancer in the country. His parents arrange him a marriage from a family his father is friends with and the proposed girl turns out to be Pavani from his college. They’re both surprised and start to think they just met each other’s soulmates. They then happily marry and move to their own house. On the same day Samudra hands over a pile of letters and asks Pavani to check them and separate the bills for him and Pavani comes across a letter from Vihangi in the pile. The letter says she’s carrying Samudra’s baby with all her love which makes Pavani stressed out. She doesn’t tell this to Samudra. Samudra finds Pavani stressed out, so to make her happy, he decides to take her on a ride in his fast car and they are met with an accident where Pavani dies. Samudra is left alone with the guilt that he killed his own wife. 8 Years Later Vihangi’s daughter, Sayuri grows up and 8 years old. But she never have seen her father. Even though Vihangi is a great dancer, Sayuri hates dancing. One day at school, Sayuri finds a pretty, young lady (Pavani’s soul) playing the piano in a quiet place at her school and the lady speaks to her. Pavani says she knows Vihangi and asks Sayuri if she knows who her father is. As the person who received that letter and destroyed it, she felt like it’s her responsibility to introduce Samudra to Sayuri. Pavani convinces Sayuri to dance in the inter school ballet competition and practices her for that, promising in the end she would bring her father to her. Sayuri agrees. A colleague of Samudra visits him during one of Samudra’s visits to Sri Lanka and says Vihangi is now a teacher at a rural school and they decide to go see their old friend. But they couldn’t meet her as she wasn’t home that day. A few days later Samudra receives an invitation as the chief guest for the winner’s welcoming ceremony from the school of the winner of a competition he judged recently. During the ceremony, when the compere asks Sayuri who taught her to dance so well, she tells her father taught and adds that she’s never seen him. It turns out that Vihangi’s daughter is the winner. Vihangi invites Samudra to come over to her place for tea and Samudra politely asks her why her husband isn’t home and in reply she says he never came home and recalls the party on their last day of college where everything happened after everyone got drunk and high. Samudra then realizes that Sayuri is his daughter, but Vihangi says it’s okay to stay away from things because she doesn’t want another woman on earth to be left alone feeling the same as her. Samudra explains her how his life collapsed as Pavani died due to his carelessness. In the end, Vihangi forgives Samudra and they both forget their dull pasts, and Sayuri finds her father and they live happily ever after as a beautiful family, all thanks to Pavani.

For example, an authentication authority that participates in SAML Web Browser SSO is an identity provider that performs the following essential tasks: # receives a SAML authentication request from a relying party via a web browser # authenticates the browser user principal # responds to the relying party with a SAML authentication assertion for the principal In the previous example, the relying party that receives and accepts the authentication assertion is called a SAML service provider. A given SAML identity provider is described by an \`\` element defined by the SAML metadata schema. Likewise a SAML service provider is described by an \`\` metadata element. In addition to an authentication assertion, a SAML identity provider may also include an attribute assertion in the response. In that case, the identity provider functions as both an authentication authority and an attribute authority.

Succeeding his brother Ashur- etil-ilani (631–627 BC), the new king of Assyria, Sinsharishkun (627–612 BC), was immediately faced by the revolt of one of his brother's chief generals, Sin-shumu-lishir, who attempted to usurp the throne for himself. Though this threat was dealt with relatively quickly, the instability caused by the brief civil war may have made it possible for another general, Nabopolassar ( – 605 BC), to rise up and seize power in Babylonia. Sinsharishkun's inability to defeat Nabopolassar, despite repeated attempts over the course of several years, allowed Nabopolassar to consolidate power and form the Neo-Babylonian Empire, restoring Babylonian independence after more than a century of Assyrian rule. The Neo-Babylonian Empire, and the newly formed Median Empire under King Cyaxares (625–585 BC), then invaded the Assyrian heartland. In 614 BC, the Medes captured and sacked Assur, the ceremonial and religious heart of the Assyrian Empire, and in 612 BC their combined armies attacked and razed Nineveh, the Assyrian capital. Sinsharishkun's fate is unknown but it is assumed that he died in the defense of his capital. He was succeeded as king only by Ashur-uballit II (612–609 BC), possibly his son, who rallied what remained of the Assyrian army at the city of Harran and, bolstered by an alliance with Egypt, ruled for three years, in a last attempt to resist the Medo-Babylonian invasion of his realm.  Background  In the first half of the seventh century BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire was at the height of its power, controlling the entire Fertile Crescent, and allied with Egypt. However, when Assyrian king Assurbanipal died of natural causes in 631 BC,' his son and successor Ashur-etil-ilani was met with opposition and unrest, a common occurrence in Assyrian history.' An Assyrian official called Nabu- rihtu-usur attempted to usurp the Assyrian throne with the help of another official, Sin-shar-ibni, but the king, likely with the help of Sin-shumu- lishir, stopped Nabu-rihtu-usur and Sin-shar-ibni crushing the conspiracy relatively quickly.' However, it is possible that some of Assyria's vassals used the reign of what they perceived to be a weak ruler to free themselves from Assyrian control and even attack Assyrian outposts. In 628 BC, Josiah, an Assyrian vassal and the king of Judah in the Levant, extended his land so that it reached the coast, capturing the city of Ashdod and settling some of his own people there.' Ashur-etil-ilani's end is unclear, but it is frequently assumed, without any supporting evidence, that Ashur-etil-ilani's brother Sinsharishkun fought with him for the throne and,' ultimately, ascended to the throne in the middle of 627 BC. Roughly at the same time, the vassal king of Babylon, Kandalanu, died which led to Sinsharishkun also becoming the ruler of Babylon, as proven by inscriptions by him in southern cities such as Nippur, Uruk, Sippar and Babylon itself.'  Course of the war   Rise of Babylon  The Neo-Babylonian Empire under Nabonidus ( 556–539 BC) Sinsharishkun's rule of Babylon did not last long, as almost immediately in the wake of him coming to the throne, the general Sin-shumu-lishir rebelled. Sin-shumu-lishir was a key figure during Ashur-etil-ilani's reign, putting down several revolts and possibly being the de facto leader of the country. The new king might have endangered his position, therefore he revolted in an attempt to seize power for himself.' Sin-shumu-lishir seized some cities in northern Babylonia, including Nippur and Babylon itself and would rule there for three months before being defeated by Sinsharishkun. Babylonia's governor, Nabopolassar, possibly using the political instability caused by the previous revolt and the ongoing interregnum in the south, assaulted both Nippur and Babylon. and in the aftermath of a failed Assyrian counterattack, Nabopolassar was formally crowned King of Babylon on November 22/23 626 BC, restoring Babylonia as an independent kingdom. In 625–623 BC, Sinsharishkun's forces again attempted to defeat Nabopolassar, campaigning in northern Babylonia. The Assyrian campaigns were initially successful, seizing the city of Sippar in 625 and repelling Nabopolassar's attempt to reconquer Nippur. Another Assyrian vassal, Elam, also stopped paying tribute to Assyria during this time and several Babylonian cities, such as Der, revolted and joined Nabopolassar. Realizing the threat this posed, Sinsharishkun led a massive counterattack himself which saw the successful recapture of Uruk in 623 BC. Sinsharishkun could possibly have ultimately been victorious but another revolt, led by an Assyrian general, occurred in the empire's western provinces in 622 BC. This general, whose name remains unknown, took advantage of the absence of Sinsharishkun's forces to march on Nineveh, met an army which surrendered without fighting and successfully seized the Assyrian throne. The surrender of the army indicates that the usurper was an Assyrian and possibly even a member of the royal family, or at least a person that would be acceptable as king.' Sinsharishkun then abandoned his Babylonian campaign to defeat the usurper, accomplishing the task after roughly a hundred days of civil war; however the absence of the Assyrian army saw the Babylonians conquer the last remaining Assyrian outposts in Babylonia in 622–620 BC. The Babylonian siege of Uruk had begun by October 622 BC and though control of the ancient city would shift between Assyria and Babylon, it was firmly under Babylonian rule by 620 BC, and Nabopolassar consolidated his rule over the entirety of Babylonia. During the next years, the Babylonians scored several other victories against the Assyrians and by 616 BC, Nabopolassar's forces had reached as far as the Balikh River. Pharaoh Psamtik I, Assyria's ally, marched his forces to help Sinsharishkun. The Egyptian pharaoh had over the last few years campaigned in order to establish dominance over the small city-states of the Levant and it was in his interests that Assyria survived as a buffer state between his own empire and those of the Babylonians and Medes in the east. A joint Egyptian-Assyrian campaign to capture the city of Gablinu was undertaken in October of 616 BC, but ended in defeat after which the Egyptian allies kept to the west of the Euphrates, only offering limited support. In 616 BC, the Babylonians defeated the Assyrian forces at Arrapha and pushed them back to the Little Zab. Although Nabopolassar's attempt at taking Assur, the ceremonial and religious center of Assyria, in May of the next year failed and he retreated to Takrit, the Assyrians also failed to assault Takrit and put an end to him.  Medes intervention  Map of the Median Empire at its greatest extent (6th century BC), according to Herodotus In October or November 615 BC, the Medes under King Cyaxares invaded Assyria and conquered the region around the city of Arrapha in preparation for a great final campaign against the Assyrians. That same year, they defeated Sinsharishkun at the Battle of Tarbisu, and in 614 BC, they conquered Assur, plundering the city and killing many of its inhabitants after its capture. Nabopolassar only arrived at Assur after the plunder had already begun and met with Cyaxares, allying with him and signing an anti-Assyrian pact. Shortly after, Sinsharishkun made his last attempt at a counterattack, rushing to rescue the besieged city of Rahilu, but Nabopolassar's army had retreated before a battle could take place. In 612 BC, the Medes and Babylonians joined their forces to besiege Nineveh and after a lengthy and brutal siege, the city was taken by the allied forces, the Medes playing the major part in the city's downfall. Although Sinsharishkun's fate is not entirely certain, it is commonly accepted that he died in the defense of Nineveh.'''''' With the destruction of Assur in 614 BC, the traditional Assyrian coronation ritual was now impossible, thus Ashur-uballit II did have a coronation in Harran and took this city as his capital. While the Babylonians saw him as the Assyrian king, the few subjects Ashur-uballit II governed himself probably did not share this view. Rather, Ashur-uballit's formal title was crown prince (mar šarri, literally meaning \\"son of the king\\"). However, Ashur-uballit not formally being king does not indicate that his claim to the throne was challenged, only that he had yet to go through with the traditional ceremony. Ashur-uballit's main objective would have been to retake the Assyrian heartland, including Assur and Nineveh. Bolstered by the forces of his allies, Egypt and Mannea, this goal was probably seen as quite possible and his rule at Harran and role as crown prince (and not legitimately crowned king) probably seemed like a mere temporary retreat. Instead, Ashur-uballit's rule at Harran composes the final years of the Assyrian Empire, which at this point, had effectively ceased to exist. After Nabopolassar himself had travelled the recently conquered Assyrian heartland in 610 BC in order to ensure stability, the Medo-Babylonian army embarked on a campaign against Harran in November of 610 BC. Intimidated by the approach of the Medo-Babylonian army, Ashur-uballit and a contingent of Egyptian reinforcements fled the city into the deserts of Syria.' The siege of Harran lasted from the winter of 610 BC to the beginning of 609 BC and the city eventually capitulated. Ashur-uballit's failure at Harran marks the end for the ancient Assyrian monarchy, which would never be restored. After the Babylonians had ruled Harran for three months, Ashur-uballit and a large force of Egyptian soldiers attempted to retake the city, but this campaign failed disastrously.' Beginning in July or June 609 BC, Ashur-uballit's siege lasted for two months, until August or September, but he and the Egyptians retreated when Nabopolassar again led his army against them. It is possible that they had retreated even earlier.  Aftermath  The eventual fate of Ashur-uballit is unknown and his siege of Harran in 609 BC is the last time he, or the Assyrians in general, are mentioned in Babylonian records. After the battle at Harran, Nabopolassar resumed his campaign against the remainder of the Assyrian army in the beginning of the year 608 or 607 BC. It is thought that Ashur-uballit was still alive at this point, for in 608 BC the Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II, Psamtik I's successor, personally led a large Egyptian army into former Assyrian territory to rescue his ally and turn the tide of the war. Because there is no mention of a large battle between the Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians and Medes in 608 BC (a battle between the four greatest military powers of their day is unlikely to have been forgotten and left out of contemporary sources) and no later mentions of Ashur-uballit, it is possible that he died at some point in 608 BC before his allies and his enemies could clash in battle.' M.B. Rowton speculates Ashur-uballit could have lived until 606 BC,' but by then the Egyptian army is mentioned in Babylonian sources without any references to the Assyrians or their king. Although Ashur-uballit is no longer mentioned after 609 BC, the Egyptian campaigns in the Levant continued for some time until a crushing defeat at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC. Throughout the next century, Egypt and Babylon, brought into direct contact with each other through Assyria's fall, would frequently be at war with each other over control in the Fertile Crescent. The rapid collapse of Assyrian power remains a great mystery, but it's clear that the Medes played a role in it.

He was one of the earliest comrade of Naxal leader Charu Majumdar and member of undivided Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist). It is claimed that at the time of arrest Narayan Sanyal was next only to CPI (Maoist) the then general secretary Muppala Lakshmana Rao alias Ganapathy.  Early life  Sanyal was born in Bogra District of Bangladesh. His father was a district leader of Indian National Congress. The family of sanyal shifted to India in 1940s. After completion of the education he joined in a service of United Bank of India in Kolkata. In 1960s he left the job and participated in Far-left politics.  Political life  Sanyal was initially associated with the Man-Money-Gun group founded by Bengali revolutionary Ananta Singh, until the Naxalbari uprising erupted in 1967. In 1969, he went to Bihar and started working under Satyanarayan Singh, the then politburo member of CPI(ML). In 1971, Sanyal led pro-Majumdar unit of CPI(ML) in Bihar and organized members in the Jehanabad - Palamu belt. He was arrested in 1973 and was released in 1977 after the first Left Front government released political prisoners. In 1978, he along with others formed the group named CPI(ML) Party Unity. He became the general secretary of that group in 1987. This group was merged with CPI(ML)(People’s War) in 1998.

Founded in 2013 by Kyle Vogt and Dan Kan, Cruise tests and develops autonomous car technology. Background The earlier generation of Cruise technology, RP-1, supplemented the human driving experience by offering an autonomous on-demand feature available for the Audi A4 or S4 (2012 or later). The intention of the $10,000 kit was to eventually retrofit all vehicles into a highway autopilot system. Ultimately, Cruise determined that the greater challenge lay in conquering city driving. In January 2014, the company decided to abandon the RP-1 and produce a fully autonomous vehicle using the Nissan Leaf. In March 2016, General Motors acquired Cruise for an undisclosed amount, although reports have placed the number from \\"north of $500 million\\", to $580 million to over $1 billion. Cruise received a permit to test self-driving vehicle technology from the California Department of Motor Vehicles in June 2015, nine months before it was acquired by GM. Cruise forms the core of GM's self-driving efforts. Industry observers have noted, and GM CEO Mary Barra has stated, that GM allowed Cruise to remain responsible for both technology and commercialization, giving Cruise independence in order to avoid the pitfalls common when a large company acquires a technology startup. History After it successfully graduated from Y-Combinator, a startup accelerator that mentors up-and-coming entrepreneurs, Cruise was acquired by GM in March 2016. Upon acquisition, Cruise had around 40 employees. In a September 2016 interview with Darrell Etherington at the San Francisco TechCrunch Disrupt conference, Vogt confirmed that the company had over 100 employees. Cruise's current headcount is unknown, but multiple outlets have reported that Cruise has continued to grow rapidly. In June 2017, Mary Barra stated that Cruise has close to 200 employees. Cruise initially focused on developing direct-to- consumer kits to retrofit vehicles with limited self-driving capabilities. In 2015, Cruise changed its strategy and began writing software to be used for fully self-driving vehicles. The brand philosophy urges car owners to engage in shared ownership instead of individual ownership, in order to reduce environmental damage, the number of accidents, and congestion in big cities. Since becoming part of General Motors, Cruise has been working exclusively on developing software for making GM's Chevy Bolt electric vehicle fully autonomous. In April 2017, GM announced plans to invest $14 million to expand Cruise operations in California, adding an estimated 1,163 full-time employees by 2021. In May 2018, Cruise announced that Softbank's Vision Fund would invest $2.25 billion into the company, along with another $1.1 billion from GM itself. In October 2018, Cruise announced that Honda would be investing $750 million into the company, followed by another $2 billion over the next 12 years. In November 2018, the company got a new CEO, Dan Ammann, who had been a president of GM before accepting this position. Testing and development A Cruise Chevrolet Bolt undergoing testing in San Francisco. The vehicle is equipped with numerous Velodyne LiDAR sensors. Cruise's Chevy Bolt electric vehicles are manufactured at the Orion Township assembly plant in Michigan with \\"...drive control algorithms and artificial intelligence created by Cruise.\\" Images of Cruise's vehicles evidence that Cruise uses Lidar, radar, and cameras on its vehicles. As of September 2016, Cruise was conducting testing with a fleet of approximately 30 self-driving vehicles. By June 2017, after GM announced the mass production of 130 new Chevy Bolts used for testing, the total number of self-driving vehicles owned by GM was estimated to be 180. As of July 2017, Cruise was conducting testing on public roads in San Francisco, Scottsdale, Arizona, and the metropolitan Detroit area. In early 2017, Cruise released a series of videos showing its self-driving vehicles navigating the streets of San Francisco. In an interview with Fortune in July 2017, Vogt described the videos as \\"...the most technically advanced demonstrations of self-driving cars that have ever been put out there in public.\\" Also in July 2017, Cruise announced \\"Cruise Anywhere,\\" a program for San Francisco-based employees to use self-driving cars as a rideshare service. CEO Kyle Vogt has stated that commercial deployment will occur via a ride- sharing service platform, but what platform remains unknown.

The series premiered on CBS in the United States on February 7, 2018 and is simulcast in Canada on Global. The series is filmed at CBS Studio Center in sound stage eighteen located in Studio City, Los Angeles. Julie Chen Moonves reprises her role as host from Big Brother with Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan also returning as executive producers. The series is produced by Fly on the Wall Entertainment in association with Endemol Shine North America. The premise of the series focuses on the activities of a group of celebrity contestants, known as HouseGuests, that live in a purpose-built house, known as the Big Brother House, with no contact from the outside world for approximately a month. The HouseGuests try to avoid eviction with the aim of being the last remaining HouseGuest in order to win a grand prize of $250,000. Each season is transmitted in real-time which allows for greater viewer participation in the form of America's Vote where the public can give their favorite HouseGuest various prizes ranging from luxury items to an advantage to help them survive inside the House. Prior to the live season finale the viewers are able to vote for their America's Favorite HouseGuest with the winner getting an auxiliary prize of $25,000. The first overall season of Celebrity Big Brother worldwide premiered in the United Kingdom in 2001 while an American version of the format has been speculated since 2002. The first season of the American adaptation was announced during a live double eviction episode of the nineteenth regular season on September 7, 2017 by Julie Chen. The first season was scheduled during the February 2018 sweeps period to counterprogram NBC's coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics. The series premiere was the number one program for CBS attracting 7.27 million viewers and the highest rated season premiere since Big Brother 13. The program was often covered in the media due to the inclusion of Omarosa Manigault and her political revelations in the first season. Tamar Braxton won the second season.  Format  The series is a game show in which a group of celebrity contestants, referred to as HouseGuests, live in a custom-built set, known as the Big Brother House, constantly under video surveillance. While in the House, the HouseGuests are completely isolated from the outside world, meaning no phone, television, Internet, magazines, newspaper, or contact with those not in the House. This rule could be broken, however, in the event of a medical injury, a family emergency, or death. The format of the series is mainly seen as a social experiment, and requires HouseGuests to interact with others who may have differing ideals, beliefs, and prejudices. Though locked in the House, the HouseGuests are free to quit the game, though will not be allowed entry back into the game. Should a HouseGuest break the rules of the game, they could be expelled from the House, and unable to return. The HouseGuests compete for a grand prize of $250,000 and the runner-up is awarded $50,000. Prior to the live finale the viewers are able to award their favorite HouseGuest of the season the title America's Favorite HouseGuest with a cash prize of $25,000. The symbol used for the Power of Veto Periodically a HouseGuest will be eliminated from the competition, referred to as evicted from the House. At the start of each round, the HouseGuests compete for the title Head of Household. The Head of Household for each round is given luxuries such as their own personal bedroom, items from home and a letter of encouragement from a loved one. The winner of the Head of Household competition is immune from nominations and was instructed to nominate two fellow HouseGuests for eviction. After a HouseGuest became Head of Household he or she is ineligible to take part in the next Head of Household competition except during the final Head of Household competition where everyone is eligible to compete. The Head of Household, the two nominees and three other HouseGuests selected by random draw then compete for the Power of Veto. The winner of the Power of Veto competition wins the right to save one of the nominated HouseGuests from eviction. If the Veto winner exercises the power, the Head of Household then has to nominate another HouseGuest for eviction which at this point nominations become final. On eviction night all HouseGuests except for the Head of Household and the two nominees votes to evict one of the two nominees. Before the voting began the nominees have the chance to say a final message to their fellow HouseGuests on why they should stay. This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room by the host Julie Chen Moonves. In the event of a tie, the Head of Household will break the tie and reveal their vote in front of the other HouseGuests. The nominee with the most votes from the other HouseGuests is evicted from the House and interviewed by Julie Chen Moonves. Unlike other versions of Big Brother, the HouseGuests can discuss the nomination and eviction process open and freely. The evicted HouseGuests of the season form the Jury that votes for the winner out of the final two HouseGuests remaining in the House on the season finale, they are known as the jury members. The production team may introduce a temporary change to the format at any time known as a twist. The HouseGuests are informed of a twist by the host or by a note given to the Head of Household to read aloud to the other HouseGuests from the production team. During the show the production team is referred to as Big Brother by the HouseGuests.  Differences from Big Brother  Some aspects of the format used for Big Brother was modified or changed for the celebrity edition. Due to the condensed nature of the program evictions happen at a quicker rate with multiple evictions occurring each week. The celebrity jury members are not sequestered after their eviction and are able to catch-up on the show before voting for a winner depending on when they were evicted. In contrast jury members from the main series are sequestered in a separate house and are not allowed to watch the show except for segments that included all of the HouseGuests. They are not shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that included strategy or details regarding nominations. The live finale features the most changes when compared to the live finales from Big Brother. Five HouseGuests remained inside the House by the season finale instead of the regular three HouseGuests. Live finales of Big Brother feature a three-part final Head of Household competition with the final eviction of the season in order to reduce the number of contestants inside the House down to two. The live finale for the celebrity season was re-tooled to feature the final Power of Veto competition, an eviction then the final Head of Household competition in one part where the final Head of Household evicted two HouseGuests in order to reduce the number of contestants inside the House down to two.  Production   Background  After the first season of the British version of Big Brother proved to be a success in the ratings for Channel 4, the network collaborated with the BBC for the first British season of Celebrity Big Brother in aid of Comic Relief. The season ran for a condensed run of eight days and featured six British celebrities moving into the house used for the first British season. Due to the success of the first celebrity edition, a second season was ordered and shown exclusively on Channel 4 in November 2002. The celebrity version took a two-year break before returning for its third season in 2005, and became a regular staple alongside the regular British version. Starting with the third season, the show began to feature celebrities outside the United Kingdom alongside well known British celebrities. Many notable American celebrities have since taken part in the British version of Celebrity Big Brother. American actor Gary Busey took part in the fourteenth season in the summer of 2014 and became the first American celebrity to win Celebrity Big Brother in the United Kingdom.  Development  Julie Chen Moonves has hosted the series since its premiere. An American version of Celebrity Big Brother has been speculated since 2002, along with a celebrity version of Survivor. In an interview, Julie Chen and then CEO of CBS Corporation Leslie Moonves revealed talks of a celebrity edition of Big Brother as far back as Big Brother 2. It was rumored that CBS was looking to air a celebrity edition in the fall after Big Brother 3 with radio personality Howard Stern speculated as a possible Houseguest. Chen revealed that Paris Hilton had agreed to do it and Roseanne Barr initially agreed to take part, but then backed out. Barr would later take part in another celebrity spin-off of Big Brother called Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack in the United Kingdom in 2008, where she watched over a group of non-celebrity housemates for a day, set tasks and talked to them in the Diary Room. Julie Chen announced on September 7, 2017, during a live double eviction episode of Big Brother 19 that Celebrity Big Brother would air sometime during the winter, before the twentieth season of Big Brother in the summer of 2018.  Cast and crew  CBS confirmed that Chen would reprise her role as host for the celebrity edition with executive producers Allison Grodner and Rich Meehan returning. CBS also confirmed that the celebrity edition would be produced by Fly on the Wall Entertainment in association with Endemol Shine North America. In an interview Chen revealed that her husband Les Moonves forced her to take a pay cut for Celebrity Big Brother due to it being a condensed version. Chen returned as the host for the second season now being credited as Julie Chen Moonves. Don Wollman and Clayton Halsey also reprises their roles as a co- executive producer and editor respectively. Wollman also serves as the voice of Big Brother where he pre-records a series of statements that are played over the loud speakers inside the House. These range from asking HouseGuests to come to the Diary Room or reminding them they are not allowed to talk about production and their Diary Room sessions with other HouseGuests. Occasionally Wollman will make announcements to the HouseGuests that are not pre-recorded. Wollman's voice is primarily heard on the live Internet feeds while occasionally heard on the episodes. Halsey also serves as the narrator for the opening and closings of the broadcast episodes. In this role he recaps recent events that were aired in previous episodes during the opening while explaining what events will take place in future episodes during the closing.  Casting  Deena Katz serves as the casting director for the series she also is known for casting ABC's Dancing with the Stars. Grodner revealed she spoke with the producers of the British adaptation about their experiences with celebrities. Due to the American adaptation featuring more competitions than other formats there is no special treatment for the celebrities in order for the competitions \\"to be as fair as possible\\". Tamar Braxton won the second season and became the first ever African-American HouseGuest to win in the history of the American adaptation of Big Brother.  Production design and music  Celebrity Big Brother uses a similar title sequence and logo that was introduced with the sixteenth season of Big Brother that was designed by Charlie Co. The logo was slightly modified to remove the water effects which were replaced by faint lights while the word \\"Celebrity\\" before \\"Big\\" with \\"Brother\\" underneath. The water effect that was used as a transition and appears around the HouseGuests was removed. This was replaced with a star being used as the transition and items related to the celebrities notoriety appeared around them. The series also uses the same theme song as Big Brother during the opening title sequence which was composed by David Vanacore and Ken Berry.  Filming  A view of CBS Studio Center sound stage 18, where the house is located Filming for the series takes place at CBS Studio Center, sound stage eighteen where the sitcom Yes, Dear was filmed. Celebrity Big Brother is filmed in the same location as Big Brother since its sixth season and is referred to as the Big Brother House often shortened to House. The House has 94 high-definition cameras and over 113 microphones in order to monitor and record the HouseGuests. The first floor of the House consists of three bedrooms, storage room and the Diary Room which is accessible by the living room. The bathroom, a lounge room, backyard and a spiral staircase going to the second floor are accessed via the kitchen. The front door is located in a vestibule area that separates the living room and kitchen. The Head of Household bedroom and en suite bathroom is located on the second floor. The second floor also has a balcony with an additional lounge area where the HouseGuests can look down and see the first floor. The backyard is significantly smaller due to the majority of the backyard being used for constant competitions. During Celebrity Big Brother a roof is installed over the backyard. The pool table was brought inside from the backyard and moved to the upstairs lounge area. The spare room sometimes used for tasks in Big Brother, such as the Den of Temptation in season nineteen, is turned into an indoor gym for the celebrity edition.  Future  After the success of the first season CBS ordered a second season to air during the winter of the 2018–19 television season on May 12, 2018. The network reconfirmed the news four days later when the network revealed its 2018–19 fall prime-time schedule. After the departure of former Les Moonves from CBS Corporation on September 9, 2018, because of multiple sexual misconduct allegations, the media speculated that Julie Chen Moonves might not continue hosting Celebrity Big Brother and Big Brother. CBS later confirmed on November 27, 2018 that Chen Moonves would host the second season of the series. Celebrity Big Brother was not mentioned when CBS announced their plans for the 2019–20 television season on May 15, 2019. Kelly Kahl, president of entertainment at CBS, revealed on May 21, 2019 that a third season of the celebrity spin-off is still uncertain. On September 5, 2019 the parent series Big Brother was renewed for a twenty-second season with Chen Moonves signing a new contract to return as host. However the new contract for Chen Moonves did not include a future season of Celebrity Big Brother with CBS not announcing anything official regarding the series. On November 11, 2019, CBS announced their 2020 winter schedule, which did not include Celebrity Big Brother. As of November 2019, the renewal of the series for a third season has not occurred. Series overview  Broadcast and coverage  The main television coverage of Celebrity Big Brother is screened on CBS over thirteen episodes per season. Alongside these episode Pop shows live coverage from inside the House on Celebrity Big Brother: After Dark. CBS also makes available live Internet video feeds from the House available through CBS All Access. In order to preserve the drama for television broadcasts, CBS does not webcast certain moments that transpire in the house, including competitions and the nomination/eviction process. Slanderous statements and singing of copyrighted music are also blocked for legal reasons. Celebrity Big Brother introduced \\"Big Brother Bot\\" which is available through Facebook, Kik and Skype. The bot was renamed to \\"Big BroBot\\" when the first season launched, it allows viewers to participate in quizzes and polls, ask the bot Big Brother related questions, get highlights about what happens inside the House and cast votes that can affect the game. The show also maintains social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter. The series is also simulcast in Canada on Global. The first season was also screened in Australia on 9Go! for the first time in the history of American Big Brother under the title Celebrity Big Brother U.S.. Episodes were broadcast on a delay but were uploaded to the streaming service 9Now shortly after the American airing of the show.  Reception  The first season of Celebrity Big Brother was often reported on by various media outlets for the inclusion of Omarosa Manigault and her discussions about her time in the Trump administration. Reed Gaudens of Fansided reviewed the series premiere positively noting the series \\"could either be so bad it’s good or just plain bad. Thankfully, it’s the former\\" while saying of the HouseGuests \\"weren’t exactly the famous faces we anticipated\\" for the season. Andy Dehnart of Reality Blurred was more critical of the show noting that most of the season one Houseguests were previously on other reality shows like Dancing with the Stars and The Celebrity Apprentice. In a post season review he noted the first season had been a \\"delight\\" when compared to a season of Big Brother.  Ratings  Celebrity Big Brother had a strong series premiere with the highest ratings since the premiere of Big Brother 13 on July 7, 2011. The series debuted to 7.27 million viewers with a 1.8/7 rating in the 18-49 demographic. The remainder of the first season was scheduled as counterprogramming to NBC's coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics.

The tomb is dedicated to the Muslim mystic Bahauddin Zakariya, founder of the Suhrawardiyya order of Sufism. It considered to be one of the most important shrines in southern Punjab province, and is the prototype for Multan's distinct architectural style. Location The shrine is located in central Multan, immediately north of its old walled city. The shrine stands next to the remains of the ancient Hindu Prahladpuri Temple. Background By the 13th century, the belief that the spiritual powers of great Sufi saints were attached to their burial sites was widespread in the Muslim world, and so a shrine was built to commemorate the burial site of Bahauddin Zakariya. In keeping with Sufi tradition in Punjab, the shrine's influence is augmented by smaller shrines spread throughout the region around Multan. These secondary shrines form a wilayat, or a \\"spiritual territory\\" of the primary shrine. As home to the primary shrine, Multan serves as the capital of Bahauddin Zakariya's wilayat. The shrine's wilayat is noted to border the spiritual territory of the Shrine of Baba Farid, based in Pakpattan. History The shrine was built in 1262 before the death of Zakariya in 1268. Unusual for a dervish, the structure was paid for at the expense of Bahauddin Zakariya - highlighting his unique financial independence. Dara Shikoh unsuccessfully attempted to win the loyalty of Multan's citizens by donating 25,000 Rupees to the shrine following his defeat by his brother at the Battle of Samugarh in 1658. The shrine's sajjada nashin, or hereditary caretaker, Makhdoom Mahmud assisted British forces against Sikh forces during the Siege of Multan in 1848. The shrine's cupola and part of its upper tier were damaged during the siege by British cannonballs, but were repaired soon afterwards. This section uses content copied verbatim from this source, which is public domain. Architecture The shrine features a two-tiered design, and became the prototype for Multan's distinct architectural style. The mausoleum was built as a two-tiered structure that is the prototype for early shrines throughout southern Punjab. The mausoleum's base is the shape of a square, built over an area of . Above the square base is an octagonal tier, about half the height of the square, which is topped by a white hemispherical dome. A vast courtyard surrounds the shrine that covers several hundreds square metres. The walls surrounding the courtyard were built by the Durrani governor of Multan, Nawab Ali Mohammad Khan Khakwani in the 18th century. The mausoleum is built of brick, and is the earlier building to be decorated with glazed blue tiles, which later became a typical style of Multan and south Punjab. The use of blue tiles reflects the influence of immigrant architects from Central Asia, who were active in the region in the 13th century. A spacious brick verandah with a painted wooden ceiling was added to the shrine in 1952. Large wooden doors provide entry into the inner sanctum of the shrine from the veranda. The shrine is surrounded by hundreds of secondary graves belonging to descendants and devotees of Bahauddin Zakariya. A small mosque also forms part of the complex, and is directly adjacent to the ruins of the Prahladpuri Temple. Traditions Qawwali songs and trance-like dancing are performed nightly after evening prayers at the shrine. The shrine is important to members of the Barelvi sect of Islam, while orthodox Deobandis shun the shrine and practices performed there. Devotees at the shrine perform the ritual of mannat, or tying threads throughout the shrine as symbols of prayer. The shrine is popularly believed to protect boatsmen on the Indus River and Chenab River. A class of devotees known as Qureishi, associate themselves with Zakariya and claim descent from the Quraysh tribe of the Prophet Muhammed. The Qureishi are held in high- esteem throughout Saraiki regions in Pakistan. One of the Qureishi, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, rose to the position of Pakistan's Minister of Foreign Affairs. Administration Hereditary caretakers of the shrine, known as sajjada nashin claim descent from Zakariya. Some caretakers have been held in high-esteem, and have maintained influence in politics. Shah Mehmood Qureshi, member of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf political party, was sajjada nashin of the shrine, but was removed from this post in 2014 after protest from devotees against the alleged use of his position as a means to secure political power.

She attracted media attention when she committed suicide following an appearance on Nancy Grace. Duckett's family filed a wrongful death claim against Nancy Grace and CNN, alleging that the aggressive questioning traumatized Duckett and led to her suicide.  Early life  Duckett was born in South Korea and moved to the United States on Christmas Eve of 1985, at the age of four months, after being adopted by an American couple. She lived in Lockport, New York until she was seventeen years old, when she moved to Florida to live with her adoptive grandparents. She attended South Sumter High School with Joshua Duckett, whom she began dating. Melinda became pregnant, and gave birth to Trenton shortly after graduating high school. She and Joshua married in July 2005. The relationship between Josh and Melinda Duckett was “tumultuous” and they separated numerous times before Melinda filed for divorce in July 2006. Melinda was involuntarily committed under the Baker Act in April 2005 after Joshua alleged that she had threatened to harm Trenton. She was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder in December 2005, but the report indicated there was \\"no psychological reason that would preclude Melinda from being a capable and loving parent.\\" Duckett worked for a lawn care company until she was laid off. She became a notary public on August 1, 2006. Disappearance of Trenton Duckett Duckett reported her son missing on August 27, 2006. She told police that she went to check on Trenton in his bedroom after she had finished watching a movie, and discovered that Trenton was gone and there was a cut in the window screen above the crib. According to police, she was considered the prime suspect in her son's disappearance but no arrests were made because they hoped she would lead them to Trenton. Death Duckett was interviewed about Trenton's disappearance by Nancy Grace for a September 8, 2006, episode of Grace's television program. During the interview Grace accused Duckett of hiding something because Duckett refused to take a polygraph test and provided vague answers to questions. The day after the taping of the show, Duckett wrote a 2-page letter addressed to “the public” expressing her love for Trenton and anger over being faced with “ridicule and criticism.” She left the letter on the dashboard of her car, entered her grandparents' home, retrieved her grandfather's shotgun, entered a closet and committed suicide by firearm. Lawsuit Duckett's family blamed her death on media scrutiny, particularly from Grace. They filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her, accusing Grace of inflicting emotional distress on Duckett. In an interview on Good Morning America, Nancy Grace said in reaction to events that \\"If anything, I would suggest that guilt made her commit suicide. To suggest that a 15- or 20-minute interview can cause someone to commit suicide is focusing on the wrong thing.\\" She then said that, while she sympathized with the family, she knew from her own experience as a victim of crime that such people look for somebody else to blame. On November 8, 2010, a month before the jury trial was scheduled to start, Grace reached a settlement with the estate of Melinda Duckett to create a $200,000 trust fund dedicated to locating Trenton. According to the agreement, if Trenton is found alive before he turns 13, the remaining proceeds in the trust will be administered by a trustee, Trenton's great-aunt Kathleen Calvert, until he turns 18 and the funds are transferred for his use. If Trenton is not found alive by his 13th birthday, the funds will be transferred to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. \\"We are pleased the lawsuit has been dismissed. The statement speaks for itself,\\" a spokeswoman for CNN said. Jay Paul Deratany, a lawyer representing Duckett's family and estate, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press: \\"After four years of litigation and extensive discovery, the parties now agree that Nancy Grace, the producers of her program, and CNN engaged in no intentional wrongdoing in the course of dedicating a program to finding the missing toddler, as alleged in the lawsuit.\\" References External links * CNN Transcripts — Transcript of the Nancy Grace episode in which Duckett was interviewed 1985 births 2006 deaths 2006 in Florida American adoptees American people of South Korean descent American women of Korean descent Deaths by person in the United States Female suicides People from Leesburg, Florida People with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder September 2006 events in the United States South Korean emigrants to the United States Suicides by firearm in Florida Suicides in Florida ","title":"Death of Melinda Duckett"},{"id":"55183239","text":"Otto Mayr (born November 2, 1930) is a German mechanical engineer, historian of technology, curator, museum director, and author.

The forests cover mountains and valleys in the western Hengduan Mountains and because of the extreme topography and relative remoteness, remain one of the best preserved habitats in China. The Nujiang Langcang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests stretch from southern Qinghai and eastern Tibet Autonomous Region in the north to Yunnan Province in the south. Portions of the forests also extend into extreme western Sichuan (China) and eastern Kachin State (Myanmar). The primary physical features to support the Nujiang forests are the Nu (Salween) and Lancang (Mekong) River valleys from approximately elevation to elevation. The southern part of this ecoregion forms the core of the Three Parallel Rivers UNESCO World Heritage Site. In addition to the mountain valleys, the Nujiang Langcang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests are found across parts of the Hengduan Mountains including, from west to east, the Taniantaweng Mountains, the Gaoligong Mountains, the Nu Mountains, and the Yun Range. The mountains in this region of the Hengduan are steep and provide few opportunities for access between valleys and gorges. This has led to the isolated nature of these forests. Notable endangered and vulnerable species in the Nujiang Langcang Gorge alpine conifer and mixed forests include the Yunnan snub-nosed monkey (endemic to this ecoregion), Gaoligong pika, and Taiwania flousiana. Forests in this ecoregion have long been threatened by logging, though since the 1990s the intensity of logging has declined in China. In the Myanmar portion, however, logging is still uncontrolled.

It is situated near the intersections of E Lakeshore Drive and Addison Rd under a large shelter structure with a viewing platform and is open to the public. The rock was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and was also located near a series of crescent shaped mounds thought to be created by Pre-Columbian peoples. More mounds were documented to be on the island and another rock with inscriptions was located on the north shore of the island. Unlike Inscription Rock, this boulder was granite - likely a glacial erratic - and engraved with two upside-down figures. However now only Inscription Rock remains since island quarry workers dynamited the petroglyph rock on the north shore. Rediscovery Inscription Rock was discovered partially buried in the sand of the lake shore in 1833 and by 1915, it was appearing on postcards for tourists in the area and is still a well-visited site to this day. In 1851 Col. Eastman of the United States Army was commissioned to analyze and create detailed drawings of the rock and petroglyphs. He then submitted copies to Shingvauk, a Native American with a knowledge of pictography, for further interpretation. There are over 100 images on the rock and the carvings were noted to be similar to ones used by the Iroquois in Canada. Due to the soft nature of the limestone rock in the area, the carvings are generally believed to be less than 1,000 years old but the Inscription Rock remains one of the most significant and accessible examples of native petroglyphs in the area. Due to its proximity to the Lake Erie shoreline, it is under constant threat of further erosion by wind and wave activity.

Irones had also resigned prior to the election and did not contest it. Vice Mayor Albert W. Bennett served as acting mayor during the campaign. Bennett did not contest the election. Several civic leaders who called themselves the Civic Affairs Conference endorsed a slate of candidates for the 1935 mayoral and city council elections. The convention endorsed local businessman Percy J. Benbough as their candidate for mayor. Another challenger was Harry C. Steinmetz, a teacher at San Diego State College who ran a socialistic campaign endorsing full public ownership of all utilities. On March 26, 1935, Benbough came in first in the primary election with 34.6 percent of the votes, followed by A. Ray Sauer Jr., son of the publisher of a weekly newspaper, in second place with 20.5 percent. Steinmetz finished third with 12.4 percent of the vote, and was eliminated from the runoff. Since no candidate received a majority of the vote, Benbough and Sauer advanced to a runoff election. On April 23, 1935, Benbough came in first place in the runoff election with 54.3 percent of the vote and was elected to the office of the mayor.

Trained in Ireland as a three-year-old, he won his first two races including the Gallinule Stakes and then finished unplaced when favourite for The Derby. Later that year he recorded his biggest win in Europe when he won the Group 1 Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes. After being sold for a world record sum he was transferred to the United States where he won the Sunset Handicap in 1980. He later stood as a breeding stallion but had very little success as a sire of winners. Background Inkerman was a \\"workmanlike, short-backed\\" bay horse with no white markings bred in Kentucky by Mrs. John W. Hanes. As a yearling he was consigned to the Keeneland Select sale and was bought for $47,000 by the bloodstock agency Horse France. He entered the ownersship of Simon Fraser and was sent to Europe where he was sent into training with Vincent O'Brien at Ballydoyle. He was sired by Vaguely Noble who won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1968 before becoming a successful breeding stallion whose best progeny included Dahlia, Exceller and Empery. Inkerman's dam Crimea was a fast and precocious filly who won the Cheveley Park Stakes in 1963 and was a distant female-line descenbant of the influential British broodmare Molly Adare. Racing career 1978: three- year-old season Inkerman began his racing career in a maiden race over ten furlongs at the Curragh on 13 May and won by four lengths from his stablemate Noble Quillo. Two weeks later he was stepped up in class for the Gallinule Stakes over one and a half miles and won again, coming home six lengths clear of Encyclopedia. The colt quickly became regarded as a major contender for The Derby ten days later especially after Lester Piggott opted to ride the colt. Piggott was looking to follow up his victories on Empery 1976 and The Minstrel in 1977 and win the race for a record ninth time. Despite his lack of experience Inkerman started favourite but after racing close to the lead in the early stages he dropped away quickly in the straight and finished twenty- first of the twenty-five runners behind Shirley Heights. It was reported that the colt had \\"swallowed his tongue\\". Inkerman was equipped with a tongue strap when he ran in the Irish Derby at the Curragh on 1 July. He produced a much better performance than he had done at Epsom and finished fourth behind Shirley Heights, Exdirectory and Hawaiian Sound, beaten by less than a length and a half by the winner. The colt's next two runs were disappointing. At the end he finished fourth to Sexton Blake in the Gordon Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse after Piggott employed exaggerated waiting tactics. In the Blandford Stakes at the Curragh in August he came home third behind Valley Forge and Rathdowney, looking to be unsuited by the prevailing soft ground. On 23 September the third running of the Joe McGrath Memorial Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse on 23 September saw Inkerman, with Piggott in the saddle, start the 13/8 favourite in a seven-runner field. Seton Blake started second favourite ahead of the filly More So while the best of the other runners appeared to be the four-year-old Orchestra (winner of the John Porter Stakes). Inkerman went to the front soon after the start and never looked to be in the slightest danger of defeat as he turned into the straight with a clear advantage and won by four lengths from Sexton Blake. In October Inkerman was put up for auction at Hollywood Park and was sold for $1,000,000, a world record auction price for a horse in training. He remained in the United States and ran thenceforth in the colours of Edward Hudson. For his efforts in 1978, Inkerman was given a rating of 126 by the Independent Timeform organisation, making him even pounds inferior to their top-rated three-year-old Ile de Bourbon. In the official International Classification he was rated six pounds behind Ile de Bourbon, making him the seventh-best three- year-old colt of the season in Europe. 1979: four-year-old season In 1979 Inkerman was based in California where he was trained by Charlie Whittingham. The colt took time to acclimatise to North American racing and was beaten in his first three starts before winning an allowance race at Hollywood Park on 17 June. In July he was stepped up in class and showed improved form to finish third in both the American Handicap and the Sunset Handicap. 1980: five-year-old season In 1980 Inkerman continued to race exclusively in California. He was beaten in allowance races on his first two starts and than ran second to Bold Tropic in the American Handicap. On 21 July on his final racecourse appearance, he made his second attempt to win the Sunset Handicap. Ridden by Willie Shoemaker, he won the race, beating his front-running stablemate Obraztsovy into second place. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Inkerman was retired to become a breeding stallion in the United States. He appears to have attracted little interest from breeders and sired no winners of any consequence. His last reported foals were born in 1988.

It is also the first academic journal which provides authors with step-by-step templates for them to use to write their papers. The journal's founders are John R.

History and publication process Cureus was originally started as PeerEMed in 2009, and was re- launched under its current name in December 2012. Under its system, after an article is published, anyone can review it, but the reviews of experts will be given a higher score. Its peer-review process involves asking experts to review a given article in a few days, which results in its peer reviews taking much less time than those of most other journals do. Adler told Retraction Watch in 2015 that \\"Yes Cureus has an unusually fast review process, which is an important part of the journal’s philosophy.

He married Sarah Westcombe, daughter and heiress of Daniel Westcombe of Enfield, on 26 August 1756. In 1761 he was Lieutenant-colonel in the Herefordshire militia. In 1741 he succeeded to both the Rowlstone estate of his father and that of his cousin William Scudamore of Kentchurch Court. The Scudamore family was one of the oldest in Herefordshire and had an interest both in the county and in the borough of Hereford. In a by-election in 1764, Scudamore was returned as Member of Parliament for Hereford after a contest. He was returned unopposed in all his subsequent elections to 1796. Scudamore died on 4 July 1796 from a chill after a strenuous hunt in his park, soon after his re-election in the 1796 general election. The Gentleman's Magazine said of him “as a useful and disinterested Member of Parliament, and an active magistrate, he was deservedly respected”. He left 2 sons and a daughter.

During the military action, the Royalists under the command of Prince Rupert successfully besieged the Parliamentary garrison of Lichfield in Staffordshire under the command of Colonel Russell. Prelude Earlier in the war the Royalists had occupied the Close at Lichfield; Lord Brook, at the head of the Warwickshire and Staffordshire levies for Parliament, had besieged and taken the Close; during the siege Lord Brook had been killed. King Charles I wanted Lichfield re-taken and turned into a Royal garrison, because the Royalists were in considerable need of ammunition, and their chief supply was drawn from the northern counties. The convoys had, however, to pass through districts sympathetic to Parliament and as: A Royalist party little inferior in strength to an army was necessary to convoy any supply of ammunition from Yorkshire to Oxford. It was, therefore, resolved to establish a Royalist garrison at Lichfield, thereby forming a centre from which escorts could be sent to convoy whatever was required. Among the orders given to Rupert for the Lichfield expedition was that he should teach the population of Birmingham a lesson for their disloyalty to the Crown, both for being a manufacturing arsenal for Parliament, and especially for the insults they had put on the King in October, 1642, before the Battle of Edgehill, in plundering the Royal Coach. Rupert's mission was, therefore, threefold. Punish Birmingham, garrison Lichfield, and clear the country as far as possible. To do this he was given a force of 1,200 horse and dragoons and 600 or 700 foot. He left Oxford on 29 March 1643 via Chipping Norton, Shipston-on-Stour, and Stratford-on-Avon; and was in Henley-in-Arden on Easter Saturday 31 March. He spent Easter Sunday there and then advanced on the unwalled town of Birmingham on Easter Monday. After the Royalist victory at the Battle of Camp Hill, Rupert stayed in Birmingham overnight and on Easter Tuesday, 4 April, he marched to Walsall; and the next day he reached Cannock, where he halted. On Saturday 8 April he marched on to Lichfield. Siege Arriving on the 8 April 1643, Rupert at once summoned the city to surrender. Colonel Russell, the governor, sent back the following answer: Rupert accordingly began the siege. After a week's work, on Sunday 16 April, the breaches were considered practicable. Rupert ordered an assaulted the place, but the Royalists were repulsed. The siege was continued until Friday, 21 April, when Rupert again ordered an assaulted the place and this time the Royalists took it with a help of an explosive mine — said to have been one of the earliest used in England — blowing up part of the wall of the Close. On this taking place the garrison surrendered on terms. Aftermath The Parliamentary garrison was allowed to march out of Lichfield with bag and baggage, and sent under a convoy to the Parliamentary stronghold of Coventry. Rupert had now completed his task, and took steps to return to Oxford. He did not stay long at Lichfield. The day after the surrender, leaving some of his force to garrison the town, he set out for to Oxford, arriving on 24 April 1643 He then was shot in the back by Robert Stallion in 1645.

The law was signed in by California governor Jerry Brown in October 2015, making California the fifth state to allow physicians to prescribe drugs to end the life of a terminally ill patient, often referred to as physician-assisted suicide. In May 2018, a state trial court ruled that the law was unconstitutionally enacted, but the following month, the law was reinstated by a state appeals court; the law was affirmed by the California State Supreme Court.https://www.deathwithdignity.org/states/california/ History In January 2015 Senate Bill 128 was introduced by Democrat Senators Lois Wolk and Bill Monning, eventually becoming PART 1.85. End of Life Option Act added to Division 1 of the California Health and Safety Code. The act includes definitions and procedures which must be fulfilled, a statement of request for aid-in-dying drugs which must be signed and witnessed and a final attestation of intent signed 48 hours before self-administering the drug. The bill was initially revealed by the family of right to die advocate Brittany Maynard, the 29-year-old terminally ill campaigner who had exercised her right to die in the state of Oregon in November of the previous year, and who had partnered with Compassion and Choices to become the public face of the right to die campaign. Maynard had been a resident of California, her family pointing out she would have preferred to die at home. The bill was modeled on Oregon's Ballot Measure 16 Death with Dignity Act which has been in force since 1994, after the California Medical Association, which represents physicians in the state, withdrew its longstanding opposition on May 20, 2015, by the recommendation of its Council of Ethical Affairs (CEA). Members of the Council included Chair Dean Hadley, M.D., Frank Staggers, Jr., M.D., William Arroyo, M.D., Charles Binkley, M.D., Christopher Fichtner, M.D., C. Freeman, M.D., John Hoff, M.D., James Hornstein, M.D., Monica Manga, M.D., Jack Chou, M.D., Jim Peterson, and Trishna Narula. Consultants to the Council included William Andereck, M.D., David Lerman, M.D., Robert Peters, M.D. and Miriam Cotler, Ph.D. In the run up to its enactment the bill received considerable opposition from religious organizations including the Catholic archdiocese and in July 2015 the bill was held up as it did not receive the required number of votes to proceed to the assembly health committee. The California End of Life Option Act was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on October 5, 2015, with Brown taking the unusual step of releasing a heartfelt message in which he indicated his dilemma regarding the consideration of the ethical issues involved and that he felt unable to deny the right of choice to others.. The bill was finally enacted on June 9, 2016, making California the fifth state to have a law enabling some of its residents to die of their own volition at a time of their choosing, after Oregon, Washington, Montana, and Vermont. Because the bill was passed during a special session, it did not take effect until June 2016. By the end of 2016, 250 people had exercised the right to begin the process, 191 received a prescription for the medication, of whom it is known 111 took their own lives, 21 dying of natural causes. Under the terms of the bill the individual must be over the age of 18 and possessing full capacity to make an independent decision to end his or her own life as well as be able to administer the drugs him or herself. Participation in all aspects of the bill is voluntary for all involved and the application must be made to both an attending and consulting physician with a gap of no fewer than 15 days, and should either physician request one, a mental health specialist such as psychiatrist or licensed psychologist. The patient must also be certified by the physician as having a life limiting illness with estimated less than 6 months to live and other palliative care options must have been previously discussed and considered. The law does not specify which drugs must be prescribed. Californian residents who have spoken to the media to publicize the law and are known to have exercised their right to die include: ex-Peace Corps and homeless charity worker Robert Stone, former Marine and insurance broker Tom House, right-to-die campaigner Brittany Maynard who moved to Oregon to be able to fulfill her right to die, retired psychologist Tom Minor who initially failed to find a doctor to support him and Democratic politician Warren Church. Under the law cause of death is given as the original illness on the death certificate and no mention is made of the act or of suicide. Criticism Previous similar bills have been rejected on at least four other occasions in the state of California and residents voted against a proposal in a ballot in 1992, however a report published by Compassion and Choices collating more recent regional and national independent opinion polls on the right to die issue shows that the US public consistently supports or strongly supports medical aid in dying. Criticism has also come from Life Legal Defense Foundation who have stated that there is no way to tell whether the process is voluntary or whether some degree of persuasion may be involved. Criticism has also been made of the potential to exclude Californians based on income and medical care coverage, with Medicare and other insurers not covering the cost of barbiturates to end life. Death With Dignity estimates the cost can reach $5000 as of 2017. Given that the cost for such drugs per individual runs between $1.50 and $50 compared to the inordinate cost of treatment for complex, life-threatening diseases like cancer, opponents and society in general are more often concerned about disenfranchised Californians choosing assisted death because other options are too expensive. The law nevertheless makes overt coercion or deception of patients a felony. See also * Act 39 in Vermont * Assisted suicide in the United States * Baxter v.

The symbol is used in both Christianity and Judaism to represent the Messianic Age. In addition, in Christianity, according to a sermon by Augustine, the lion stands for Christ resurrected, the lamb for Christ's sacrifice (\\"He endured death as a lamb; he devoured it as a lion.\\"--Augustine, Sermon 375A). Isaiah 35:9 casts a lion as metaphorically forbidden in the future paradise (\\"No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there\\"); yet, Isaiah 65:25 and 11:6–7, respectively reference such formerly ravenous beasts as becoming peaceable: \\"The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; but the serpent—its food shall be dust!\\"; \\"The wolf shall live with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the kid, the calf and the lion and the fatling together, and a little child shall lead them.\\" \\"In like a lion, out like a lamb\\" is a proverb having to do with March weather. It has been speculated that its origin is from astrological Leo (lion) being followed by Aries (ram). Examples In the 1830s, American Quaker artist Edward Hicks began painting a series of paintings on the theme of the Peaceable Kingdom. Seal of the Community of Christ (c. 1950s; since the 1960s it has been simplified, e.g., braiding around circumference removed) The kingdom-of-peace motif has been popular among various so-called Christian \\"Restorationist\\" groups. The lamb and lion have been used informally in Community of Christ since the Latter Day Saints' \\"Kirtland\\" period. Its original formal iteration, prominently featuring the lion, the lamb, and child, along with the motto Peace, was designed by Joseph Smith III, Jason W. Briggs, and Elijah Banta, and approved in the denomination's General Conference in 1874. The Worldwide Church of God (now Grace Communion International) had used a seal depicting the lamb, the lion and a child.

Among his works is a painting of Toni Morrison held in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. In 2002, McCurdy was commissioned to paint a portrait of US Representative Martin Sabo for the US Capitol. Robert McCurdy begins his painted portraits with a photograph, asking his sitters to address the unseen viewer directly and to make no gestures. He seeks an image that has no implied past or future but exists in the eternal present. McCurdy's goal is to provide a neutral environment in order to maximize the highly personal nature of the encounter between subject and viewer. McCurdy's skillfully executed paintings focus the viewer's traditional response to the image of a human being: the coda of his paintings is the gaze, not the sitter's setting and story, compelling and recognizable though that story may be. Among those who have stood for McCurdy are the Dalai Lama, Nelson Mandela, Jane Goodall, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Toni Morrison, Neil Armstrong, Muhammad Ali and Warren Buffett, among others. His methodology includes taking hundreds of photos in an effort to arrive at the one that will best yield what he is striving to achieve: a moment suspended, when the viewer catches the gaze of the rendered image – and holds it, without the veil of distracting thought or judgement. That brief and elemental moment between the viewer and the image being viewed is what the artist hopes to achieve. His minimalist approach in the presentation of a figure is one the artist has determined is the sustainable moment captured during the sitting, the image whose cues as to space and time have been most successfully set aside. The artist removes any clue or comment as to time, place, history or judgement, leaving the viewer's initial and whole engagement in the exchange of a gaze. Robert McCurdy has been exhibiting his photography and paintings for the past forty years. Select showings and collections include the National Portrait Gallery, Washington, D.C.; Frye Museum, Seattle; Norton Museum of Art, West Palm Beach, Florida; Le Tresors des Arts, Gstaad, Switzerland; Jack Shainman Gallery, New York; Nancy Solomon Gallery, Atlanta, Georgia; Henry Art Gallery, University of Washington; Venetia Kapernikas Gallery, New York, Berry-Hill Galleries, New York, among others.

Rector Very Reverent Abbot Tikhon (Gayfudinov). www.holyskete.com Founded in 1953 as parish church of Protection of Our Most Holy Lady Theotokos in Russian Cossack settlement New Kuban. The revival of the parish began after the transformation of the parish Church to the Holy Virgin Protection skete in autumn 2015. Since 2016, the skete celebrations are held every first Sunday of the month and holidays. The skete is home to a Russian Orthodox cemetery. The brethren care for the grounds and tombstones, and those who wish can purchase land for family burial.  History  In 1952 \\"Kuban Cossack Army Abroad\\" (Кубанское казачье войско за рубежом) created \\"free cossack stanitsa\\" New Kuban (Вольная общеказачья станица Новая Кубань). In 1953 parish of Holy Protection of the Mother of God was established, consisting primarily of Russian people who could not conceive of life and activities without their Orthodox traditions Construction of Holy Protection Church began in 1953 with the blessing and direct participation of Archbishop Nikon (Rklitsky) of Washington & Florida. Since November 1963 priest Nikolai Nekliudoff appointed rector of the Church. In early 1964, a parish school and library were organized at the church, and a Russian cemetery founded on the parish grounds. Thanks to efforts of fr Nikolai Nekliudoff, a stone church was built in the style of Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville. Frescos for the church were completed by the renowned iconographer of the Russian Diaspora, Archimandrite Cyprian (Pyzhov) of Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, NY, while the iconostasis was the work of layman Dmitry Alexandrow (later Bishop Daniel of Erie). A bell-tower with five bells acquired from Rhodesia (Africa) was built, where particularly melodious bells were made. The Cossack church became a place where hundreds of Cossack refugees would gather and work tirelessly to preserve their traditions and way of life. In the years to follow, the church nourished not only \\"New Kuban\\", but also surrounding towns. As the years went by, the Cossacks aged and the younger generations moved away. For many years after the repose of the last rector – Archpriest Nikolai Nekludoff – in 2004, the divine services were held very rarely, and the parish was placed under the supervision of Archpriest Liubo Milosevich of the neighboring Holy Trinity Church in Vineland. After Archpriest Nikolai Nekludoff's death his widow Adelaida Nekludoff has led prayer services. When he wasn't replaced, parishioners opted to attend Orthodox churches nearby rather than hear Mrs. Nekludoff read. The peace and tranquility of the surroundings of the church and, with time, the decreasing number of active parishioners, has led to the realization that this location is an ideal spot for the establishment of a small monastic community. In the autumn of 2015, Metropolitan Hilarion (Kapral) of Eastern America & New York signed a directive organizing Holy Protection Male Skete at the former parish. For the community’s spiritual nourishment and rebirth, Abbot Tikhon (Gayfudinov) was assigned as rector of the skete. Among the several dozen churches founded by the Cossacks, Holy Protection Church was one of the few remaining. In connection with which Eastern American and New York Diocese made an effort to prevent its closing and to ensure its future growth. October 14 2015 the feast of the Protection of the Mother of God, the festal Divine Liturgy was celebrated by Eastern American Diocesan secretary Archpriest Serge Lukianov, Abbot Tikhon (Gayfudinov; Skete rector), Priest Anatoly Revitskyy (cleric of New Kuban Church), Priest Eugene Solodky, Protodeacon Leonid Roschko (cleric of St. Alexander Nevsky Diocesan Cathedral in Howell, NJ), and Deacon Dimitri Krenitsky (cleric of New Kuban Church). Faithful from Washington, New York, and New Jersey gathered at the Skete for the patronal feast day. A festal luncheon was then served for the clergy and faithful. After twenty years, weekly divine services have resumed since February 3, 2016, of this year, and will be held on Saturdays and great feasts (Hours at 9:30 AM, Divine Liturgy at 10:00). During the first week of Great Lent of 2016, Metropolitan Hilarion of Eastern America & New York visited Holy Protection Skete. On Wednesday the 16th and Thursday the 17th of March, he led the reading of the Great Penitential Canon of St. Andrew of Crete, co-served by skete rector Abbot Tikhon (Gayfudinov). This was the first hierarchal service in the skete in the past 25 years, since Metropolitan Vitaly (Ustinov) served there.

The CSPPA was believed to have been some combination of Palestinians, Armenian nationalists, and Lebanese Marxists, though it was later reported that they were mainly instigated by Hezbollah, sponsored by the Iranian state. The CSPPA demanded the release of Anis Naccache, from the Iranian state network; Georges Ibrahim Abdallah, member of the Lebanese Armed Revolutionary Factions (LARF); and Varadjian Garbidjan, member of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia (ASALA). , a Tunisian convert to Shia Islam was in 1987 found by the counter-terrorism agency Direction de la surveillance du territoire (DST) to have been the leader of the group of eighteen terrorists directed by Hezbollah from Beirut. During the trials it was claimed that the attacks were ordered by Iran to stop France from selling arms to Iraq for use in the Iran–Iraq War, rather than the prisoners' releases. Thirteen bombings including attempts were committed, the first in December 1985, a second wave in February and March 1986, and the third and most notorious wave in September 1986, targeting sites across the French capital. It caused a total of 20 deaths (including seven who died later from their wounds in hospitals) and 255 people were wounded. Background In 1984, Hezbollah-linked Islamic Jihad Organization terrorists were arrested while plotting bombings against a plane from Zürich Airport, and against the United States embassy in Rome. In 1985 the group was responsible for attacks including the El Descanso bombing in Madrid that killed eighteen people and wounded 82, the hijacking of TWA Flight 847 from Athens, and bombings in Copenhagen that killed one person and wounded 22. France applied a policy in response to attacks from Middle Eastern terrorism in Europe called the \\"sanctuary doctrine\\" by analysts, in which French authorities would not interfere with the activities of transnational terrorist groups operating in France as long as they did not attack France or French interests directly. A wave of bombings began in Paris in early 1985 with the bombing of a Marks & Spencer department store, and of the Jewish Rivoli Beaubourg cinema. Overview Two bombings on the same day occurred in December 1985. It came a day after Communist Combatant Cells attacks in Belgium and near Paris, and a bomb against a courthouse in Liège. This naturally created suspicion that they were linked, although eventually none of the three were. Following three bombings in February 1986, thousands of extra police officers were sent out to patrol various areas in Paris. On 20 March 1986, a bomb killing two people took place within an hour of Jacques Chirac being named French Prime Minister under François Mitterrand, while simultaneously being Mayor of Paris. Chirac subsequently launched further increased security in public places, while promising \\"draconian\\" anti-terrorism measures. At the same time he began a policy of \\"normalisation\\" of relations with Iran and Syria. After initially seeming to put a stop to attacks, a renewed bombing campaign in September 1986 turned out to become the most intense and is said to have \\"virtually paralyzed Paris.\\" In addition, fifteen riot police companies were sent to Paris to reinforce security, while police raced to investigate more than a hundred bomb scares reported by members of the public. Attacks A plaque commemorating the victims of the 17 September 1986 attack at rue de Rennes. * 7 December 1985, two bombs exploded, at the Galerie Lafayette and the Galerie Printemps, wounding 43 people.

The attack killed seven people and wounded 60, making it the deadliest of the bombings. Investigation The CSPPA (Comité de solidarité avec les prisonniers politiques arabes et du Proche-Orient) remained a mystery group at the time. A French defector claimed that the attacks were indirectly sponsored by Iran, Syria and Libya, which each had strained relations with the French state. One of the prisoner demands was Anis Naccache, who was convicted of attempting to assassinate former pre- Revolution Iran premier Shapur Bakhtiar. Armenian militants and Lebanese far- left militants were also thought to be involved. The CSPPA acronym was also used before by an Armenian group supporting prisoners of ASALA and Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide (JCAG), led by Jean-Marc Toranian. ASALA's involvement was strongly noted by the authorities due to the CSPPA's demand of releasing Varoujan Garbidjian, who was in prison over the 1983 Orly Airport attack. In October 1986, a handwritten statement signed by ASALA spokesman Vahran Vahrania and delivered to a western news agency in Beirut threatened more violence against France unless Garbidjian and the other Middle Eastern prisoners were released. The ASALA claimed co-responsibility for the September 1986 attacks in Paris. Jacques Chirac believed that the FARL was responsible due to the prison sentencing of its member Georges Ibrahim Abdallah at the time. However others, including Syria, claimed it was linked to the Iran–Iraq War, and it was later found out that the links between the CSPPA and the FARL were pretty weak, and that the main entity behind the group was Iran. Iran's involvement led to some to describe the attacks as having a dimension of Shia Islamic terrorism. Investigations of the hijackers of TWA Flight 847 and Air Afrique Flight 56 were among the factors that helped lead investigators towards Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Lebanese militia, and the cell behind the attacks. In early 1987, following the arrest of Mohammed Ali Hammadi in West Germany, the DST identified Fouad Ali Saleh as the leader of a group of eighteen terrorists directed by Hezbollah from Beirut as being behind all the attacks. Previously, several other groups had been speculated to have been behind the attacks or falsely claimed responsibility. Saleh's group was in addition to Tunisians connected to Lebanese Hezbollah operatives responsible for mass-casualty bombings including the bombing of the United States embassy in Beirut and the Beirut barracks bombings in 1983. Arrests and convictions After the Paris City Hall bombing in September 1986, twelve people of Arab origin, mostly Tunisians, were detained and expelled from France. Later, in a police raid on 21 March 1987, Saleh and seven other suspects, two Lebanese French citizens and five Tunisians were arrested, among them a nephew of Hezbollah leader Sheik Ibrahim al-Amin. Police seized two automatic pistols, ammunition and methyl nitrate during the raid. Saleh was charged in November 1987 by a special anti-terrorism court in France, and was in 1992 found guilty of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy, and sentenced to life in prison. A Tunisian former Sunni Muslim who converted to Shia Islam before moving to Iran and studying for two years in the religious seminaries of Qom in the early 1980s, Saleh had begun preaching and proselytising to people both in public places and private, which reportedly led him to be recruited by Hezbollah agents. During the court case he proclaimed his motivation for the attacks as being \\"a fighter advocating for the Islamic cause.\\" Aftermath In September 1986, the French government allegedly sent officials to Syria, concluding a deal with the government in which support for terrorism in France would cease, in return for French arms, economic and diplomatic support to Syria. A similar deal was reportedly made with Iran the next year. After the arrest of the Saleh group in 1987, Tunisia broke off diplomatic relations with Iran, accusing the country of recruiting Tunisians to carry out terrorist attacks. France initially accused Iran of \\"instigating the 1986 bombing campaign and of giving support to a cell of North African terrorists,\\" and a subsequent diplomatic row caused France to sever its ties with Iran. France eventually allowed , who was wanted for questioning in connection with the Paris attacks, to leave the Iranian embassy in Paris for Iran in order to secure the release of two French hostages who had subsequently been kidnapped by Hezbollah in Beirut, a move that was condemned by the United Kingdom and the United States for setting a \\"dangerous precedent\\" in dealing with hostage situations. After several more gestures were made by France, including the expulsion of Iranian opposition leaders from the country, the conflict and further attacks ceased. In France the attacks triggered \\"profound changes\\" in the organisation and legislative base for French counter-terrorism. In Belgium the attacks had a major part in Belgian police starting to investigate political Islam, leading directly to the establishment of a specific office dedicated entirely to Islamic radicalism in the Brussels Gendarmerie anti-terrorism unit. After the terror attacks of 1986, France was largely free of attacks from international terrorism for the next eight years, when a series of attacks were carried out by the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA).

There is substantial economic cooperation between the two countries, with Qatar being one of the largest foreign investors in Morocco. A $2 billion joint venture between Qatar's sovereign wealth fund and Morocco was established in 2011. Politically, Qatar supports Moroccan claims on Western Sahara, although political relations have historically been sporadic due to Qatar's cordial relations with Algeria and perceived biases perpetuated by its global news corporation, Al Jazeera. During the 2017 Qatari diplomatic crisis, Morocco offered to mediate the dispute, and even sent humanitarian aid to Qatar, which had been banned from using the land, air and sea routes belonging to several of its neighboring countries. Diplomatic representation Qatar maintains an embassy in Morocco's capital city Rabat. Morocco has an embassy in Doha, Qatar. Diplomatic visits King Mohammed VI of Morocco, who assumed power in 1999, made his first official visit to Qatar in June 2002. Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani made his first visit to Morocco in October 2002. In July 2005, he traveled to Morocco for an official two-day visit. Diplomatic cooperation Western Sahara Qatar has confirmed its support for Morocco over Western Sahara, however their support is sporadic and unstable due to perceived bias news from Al Jazeera and its interview with a number of Sahrawi dissidents opposing Moroccan Government.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTDyYovnBOs However, with the Qatar crisis occurred in 2017, Al Jazeera has shifted into a more pro-Moroccan stance, in line with the Qatari Government.https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2016/09/making-sense- tension-western-sahara-160914131548054.html Political After Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani successfully deposed his father Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani in 1995, he was not immediately accepted by Hassan II. Qatar had uncertain relations with Morocco in the years proceeding Hamad's succession, mainly due to Qatar's existing relations with Algeria and Al Jazeera's unfavorable coverage of Morocco. In June 2000, Morocco withdrew its ambassador to Doha in response to Qatar casting a vote for Germany rather than Morocco in the host selection for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The two countries agreed to resume normal diplomatic relations in October 2000. Nonetheless, relations continued to experience highs and lows. Qatar's purchase of British-made weapons for Algeria was not received well by Rabat, and Moroccan media criticized Qatar- based Al Jazeera for producing programs that were dubbed \\"anti-Moroccan\\". =2017 Qatari diplomatic crisis= On 5 June 2017, a number of states led by Saudi Arabia cut ties with Qatar. Morocco stated that it would remain neutral in the crisis, and on 11 June, extended an offer for mediation of the dispute. On 13 June, Morocco stated that it would send food aid to Qatar amidst its isolation from the sea, air and land routes belonging to the blockading countries. The Moroccan Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed that the food aid was sent in line with the spirit of the holy month of Ramadan. Although the Moroccan government has maintained a neutral stance, Morocco's leading party, the Justice and Development Party, proclaimed its support for Qatar in the dispute. Displeased with Morocco's neutrality, certain media outlets in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, two of the blockading countries, have brought up the issue of Western Saharan independence in an attempt to influence Morocco to support the boycott of Qatar. Foreign aid In December 2013, Qatar pledged $1.25 billion to Morocco in foreign aid. The aid is part of a five-year package deal arranged by four members of the GCC to supply $5 billion worth of aid to Morocco, in an attempt to bolster its political security. Economic A joint venture fund was set up between Morocco and Qatar's sovereign wealth fund in November 2011. It was reportedly valued at $2 billion, with both partners contributing equal funding. Morocco and Qatar's trade volume was valued at $70 million in 2015. In 2016, Qatar ranked fifth in direct foreign investment in Morocco. Media In 1981, Qatar and Morocco signed a media agreement which entailed co-operation and exchange of news and data between the two countries' media organizations. Morocco was selected as host of Al Jazeera's North African news show, Al-Hasad al-Magharibi, in 2006. It was deemed an appropriate venue for the show's base of operations due to Morocco's lenient media laws relative to its neighbors. At the beginning of 2008, Moroccan authorities rescinded the network's permission to broadcast the show in the country under the pretense of technicalities. They then withdrew the accreditation of journalist Hassan Rachidi in June 2008 when he reported on a report released by a Moroccan-based human rights organization. This was followed by the revocation of two more journalists' accreditation in 2009, and in October 2010, the authorities officially revoked the accreditation of all of Al Jazeera's Morocco-based journalists. On 29 October, Morocco announced it would be shutting down all of Al Jazeera's operations in the country. The main reason cited by authorities was the perceived favoritism towards Western Saharan independence. Bilateral relations between the two countries did not suffer from the incident. In a broadcasting of the 2011 Pan Arab Games by Qatar-based Al Kass Sports Channels, the map displayed on the screen depicting Morocco's territories did not include the disputed Western Sahara due to an alleged technical error. Despite Qatar's previous affirmations recognizing Moroccan sovereignty over Western Sahara, a group of Moroccan hackers launched an operation called 'Moroccan Vengeance', in which they would target websites belonging to the Qatari government. Qatar's 2022 World Cup Facebook page and the official page of the Pan-Arab Games were among the hacked websites.

The U.S.-led Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF–OIR) anti-ISIL coalition provided extensive air support while SDF personnel composed the majority of the ground forces; CJTF-OIR special forces and artillery units were also involved in the campaign.Operation Inherent Resolve Official Twitter. Marched 25, 2019. The ground campaign stalled and was paused in early 2018 due to the Turkish-led invasion of Afrin, but resumed on 1 May 2018 with the new phase named by the anti-ISIL Coalition as Operation Roundup. The third phase started on 10 September 2018 but was once again halted due to Turkish artillery attacks on SDF positions near the Syria-Turkey border on 31 October. The SDF and the Coalition announced the resumption of the offensive on 11 November. After a string of steady successes following the capturing of ISIL's Hajin stronghold and a ten-day pause for civilian evacuations, the SDF launched its final assault on the remainder of the Middle Euphrates River Valley (MERV) pocket on 9 February 2019. The first phase of the campaign was concurrent with another SDF operation, the Raqqa campaign conducted against Raqqa, ISIL's then-capital city and stronghold in Syria, as well as with the Central Syria campaign, the Eastern Syria campaign, and the Battle of Deir ez-Zor, in which the Syrian Army (SAA) was also capturing territory from the Islamic State; the Iraqi Army's Western Iraq campaign against ISIL was also underway. The entirety of the SDF's campaign was also concurrent with the Syrian Army's Syrian Desert campaign.  Background  On 25 August 2017, around 800 fighters from the Syrian Elite Forces defected to the SDF's Deir ez-Zor Military Council. On the same day, Ahmad Abu Khawla, commander of the Deir ez-Zor Military Council, announced that it would launch an offensive north of Deir ez-Zor within several weeks. Just before the start of the offensive, the SDF received a large amount of new weaponry and ammunition from the U.S.-led CJTF–OIR Coalition.  The campaign   Initial phase  The SDF officially announce the campaign, 9 September 2017 The SDF launched their ground operation on 8 September 2017 by attacking ISIL- held villages in the northern Deir ez-Zor countryside; on the next day, the campaign was officially announced in the al-Shaddadah Subdistrict, with the stated aim of expelling ISIL from all areas north and east of the Euphrates river. During the course of the next two days, the SDF rapidly advanced and captured numerous villages. According to pro-Syrian opposition media, this quick initial progress was due to ISIL forces retreating from areas that were difficult to defend in the face of heavy CJTF–OIR airstrikes. On 10 September 2017, the SDF fought its way into the fortified 'Industrial City', directly north of Deir ez-Zor city, while capturing more nearby villages. On 12 and 13 September, the SDF captured several locations at Deir ez-Zor's northern entrance (including the former Brigade 113 and al-Niran Battalion bases, the Sadkob station and part of the sheep market) as well as the silos and cotton storages in the Industrial City. Anti-ISIL forces also made further progress in the desert north of Deir ez-Zor, where it advanced 60 km. Despite these successes for the SDF, ISIL began offering stiffer resistance and began launching repeated counterattacks supported by VBIEDs in an attempt to stall the offensive and/or recapture territory. Meanwhile, the SDF leadership stated that their forces would not attack Syrian government troops, which were simultaneously battling ISIL on the west side of the Euphrates. On 15 September, Ahmad Abu Khawla, commander of the SDF's Deir ez-Zor Military Council, however, stated that it will not allow Syrian government forces to cross the Euphrates. The next day reportedly Syrian or Russian aircraft bombed SDF positions on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, injuring six SDF fighters. In response, CJTF–OIR stated that while they were putting their \\"full efforts into preventing unnecessary escalation among forces that share ISIS as our common enemy\\", \\"Coalition forces and partners always retain the right of self- defense\\". In this context, Institute for the Study of War expert Chris Kozak said that neither Russia nor the United States had an interest in escalating a conflict between themselves. \\"The real threat [is instead] that the partner forces on the ground—the SAA and the SDF—come close [to confrontation] before the US and Russia can slow them down.\\" The Syrian government and the SDF are rivals in the Deir ez-Zor Governorate, as both sides want to capture the region's natural resources (most importantly its oil fields). On 17 September, the SDF captured a textile factory and a roundabout 7 km from Deir ez-Zor city. = Opening of a second front = On 20 September, the SDF opened a second front against ISIL east of Deir ez-Zor, near the border with Iraq, and seized six villages alongside the M7 highway in quick order, advancing towards the oil-rich eastern countryside of Deir ez-Zor. On 21 September, Russia warned it would attack SDF fighters if provoked.Russia says will target U.S.-backed fighters in Syria if provoked, Reuters, 21 September 2017 As a response to the SDF advances, ISIL began to launch raids into SDF-held areas in southern al-Hasakah Governorate, reportedly ambushing and killing several SDF fighters on 21 and 24 September. ISIL counterattacks did little to impede the SDF offensive, however, with the SDF proceeding to capture the Al-Izba and Conoco gas fields, the Derro oil fields, and the Al-Bazikh mountain chain. On 25 September, Russian aircraft, as well as Syrian and Russian artillery, bombarded SDF troops at the Conoco gas field, causing several casualties. The SDF responded by stating that \\"Russian and regime forces have mounted a treacherous attack against our forces,\\" and that they would \\"use [our] legitimate right to self-defense\\". Further Russian bombing was reported on 27 September, with the SOHR stating 6 civilian casualties in Marat, to the east of the Euphrates River, opposite the Deir ez-Zor Military Airbase.Air strikes cause casualties and injuries in the east of the Euphrates River, and shelling kills one person in the vicinity of Al-Lataminah, SOHR, 27 September 2017 Iranian missile strikes on ISIL in the southern and eastern parts of the province were also reported on 24 September.Iran strikes IS bases on Syria- Iraq border with drone, AP, 24 September 2017 Despite the Russo-Syrian airstrike incidents, the SDF continued the offensive and pushed ISIL out of numerous villages over the following days. At al-Suwar, however, the SDF troops met fierce resistance on 24 September, and a heavy battle ensued; after six days of fighting the town finally fell. The SDF then attempted to further advance in al-Suwar's surroundings, while ISIL launched counterattacks to retake it. Meanwhile, on 28 September, Yasser al-Dahla of The Gathering of al- Baggara Youth group was arrested by SDF military police on accusations of not effectively participating in the offensive and a \\"lack of military discipline\\". The Gathering of al-Baggara Youth denied these charges, and criticized the Deir ez-Zor Military Council of denying Euphrates Shield fighters who defected to the SDF to join the Gathering. Dahla reportedly threatened to cease his group's participation in the Deir ez-Zor offensive. On 30 September, the SDF took control of the Jafra oil fields, which was one of the \\"most important sources of income for IS\\". Between 1 and 9 October, the SDF captured several more villages and repelled further ISIL counterattacks, with ISIL resistance in these areas being mostly light. This was due to ISIL relocating many of its troops from its frontlines with the SDF in order to face the encroaching Syrian Army. ISIL prisoners of war in the custody of the SDF after surrendering during the campaign in October 2017. Between 9 and 10 October, the SDF captured four villages while advancing on the eastern bank of Euphrates river. Around a dozen SDF fighters were executed after ISIL recaptured al-Jazrah oilfield on 12 October. Many SDF fighters were killed and executed on 15 October after ISIL attacked their positions on the provincial border between al-Hasakah and Deir ez-Zor, infiltrating several checkpoints and outposts along the main road between Al-Salhiyah and Sor. Syrian military reports said on 19 October that the SDF had allowed Russian troops to enter and take control of Conoco gas field, despite both the SDF and the SAA trying to take control of al-Omar gas field from ISIL. Laila al-Abdullah, the spokesperson of the SDF, announced that they had captured the al-Omar oil field after a military operation in early hours of 22 October, and were clashing with ISIL fighters in an adjacent housing complex. SOHR stated that it had entered the oilfield after pro-Syrian government forces withdrew following an ISIL attack on them. The SDF, later in the month, started advancing towards Abu Kamal and reportedly captured sites south of the oilfields. ISIL counterattacked on 29 October in an attempt to recapture the oilfield and was able to capture large territory along its perimeter while killing 6 SDF fighters. By November 2017, the SDF had reached the western outskirts of Markadah. On 3 November, the SDF captured six villages while advancing on three different fronts. One village on the eastern bank of the Euphrates was captured near the Al-Busayrah axis, about southeast of Deir ez- Zor city. Two villages around northeast from the city and located near the border with Iraq were also captured. In addition, three villages east of Deir ez-Zor city and located on the bank of the Khabur river were captured by the SDF. On 6 November, the SDF cleared an ISIL pocket at Khabur after two SDF pincers met on both sides of the river and captured six villages, about east of Deir ez-Zor city. = Slowing down of the campaign = ISIL POW with a self-inflicted wound. As the organization's military continued to retreat in eastern Syria, an increasing number of its fighters shot themselves in order to lag behind and be captured by the SDF. On 7 November, the SDF captured a village while advancing on the southwest along Khabur. The SDF captured the key town of Markadah on 8 November. On 12 November, the SDF captured Al- Busayrah and all neighboring villages, thereby completely eliminating an ISIL pocket to east of Euphrates. The SDF captured the Tanak oil fields on the next day. On 14 November, the SDF pushed southwards along the river, capturing a village and killing 11 ISIL militants. By the next day, they had advanced within to the border with Iraq, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). After ISIL lost Al-Qa'im and Abu Kamal, to the Iraqi and Syrian Army, respectively, ISIL moved its de facto capital to the Syrian city of Hajin, in the Middle Euphrates Valley. The SDF's Deir Ezzor Military Council reached the Iraqi border on 25 November, through the northern countryside of Albu Kamal, effectively cutting off the Syrian Arab Army from the border crossings to the north of the town. The United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) announced in February 2018 that Shaykh Abu Anas al-Furati, a senior ISIL commander, was killed in an airstrike on Hajin on 27 November. The YPG declared on 3 December that it had completely captured the eastern countryside of Deir Ezzor. SDF captured three villages south of Deir Ezzor city on 9 December. During the clashes, it was struck by a car bomb in a village, with Amaq News Agency stating deaths of 15 SDF fighters. The alliance was meanwhile aided by Russian airstrikes. The SDF's Deir Ezzor Military Council reported on 12 December that their forces had captured several towns along the eastern bank of the Epuhrates, including Hasiyat, Jayshiyah, Jadleh, Al-Bahrah, and Gharanij after a brief battle. Taking advantage of ISIL's concentration on attacking the Syrian Army on the western bank, during the week, the SDF took over several towns controlled by the group. SDF's official media wing reported capture of Jurdi Al-Sharqi on 13 December after a brief battle. SOHR meanwhile stated that 23 civilians had been killed by airstrikes carried out by the US- led Coalition in an ISIL-controlled village on the eastern banks. The U.S. DoD announced in February that ISIL military commander Abd al Rahman Filipini, was killed near Hajin due to airstrikes on the same day. On 16 December, the SDF, led by the Deir Ezzor Military Council, captured several sites, including towns of Abu Hardub and Hasiyat. This allowed them to secure complete control over the Murad Oil Field, located northeast of Abu Hardub, thus leaving the remaining populated areas to secure from ISIS east of the Euphrates, stretching from the town of Hajin, down towards the border with Iraq, within the administrative district of Abu Kamal. ISIL counterattacked SDF positions along Euphrates on 22 December, attempting to push back towards Al-'Umar oil fields. Pro-SDF media stating to having foiled the attack and having killed 21 ISIL fighters. ISIL-affiliated media stated on 29 December that they had struck SDF in a car-bomb attack amidst a counterattack near Al-Bahrah village. It stated to have so far killed 3 SDF fighters and wounded 7 in the battle. Later on 29 December, according to both pro-Syrian opposition and pro-Kurdish sources, on 29 December, the SDF captured four towns and villages to the north of ISIL stronghold of Haijan. The advance bypassed the Shaitat tribal region, encircling ISIL in the area. SDF stated it had killed 67 ISIL fighters while capturing the villages. The four settlements reported captured were Al-Bahrah, Al-Kahawi, Al-Jabal and Kushkiyah. SOHR on the next day reported heavy fighting between both groups on the eastern banks with ISIL managing to capturing Abu Hamam. Later on the same day, SDF captured the town of Khara’ij and the village of Al-Marsama Gharbi. It also entered Abu Hamam. ISIL stated on 31 December that 20 SDF fighters and 50 others had been wounded in a car bombing carried out by a German jihadist on them, at al-Bahra. On 1 January 2018, it was announced that the YPG/YPJ's Anti-Terror Units had killed ISIL commander Hisen Ayid el-Bilebil Ebu el-Walid, the mastermind of July 2016 Qamishli bombings, in al-Busayrah. SOHR stated on the same day that 12 civilians were killed in air strikes on ISIL-held Susa village. Meanwhile, Kurdish sources stated that the SDF had captured the town of al-Sabha. = Gharanij and ISIL attacks = Pro-Kurdish and pro-Coalition sources reported on 2 January that the SDF had captured towns of Abu Hardub and Al-Nabayi, killing at least 17 ISIL fighters. The U.S. DoD announced in February that ISIL military commander Abd al Rahman al Tamimi was killed in airstrikes near Hajin on the same day. On the next day, the SDF announced capture of towns of Muhamidah, ‘Ard Al-Zir and Al-Majeed. They were also engaged in heavy clashes for control of Abu Hamam and Hajin. On 4 January, it was reported that they had captured the ISIL stronghold of Gharanij. The U.S. DoD announced in February that Haytham al Jazairi and Hassan al Jazzari, part of ISIL's immigration logistics group, were killed in airstrikes on 6 January near Khara’ij and Abu Hammam respectively. An ISIL counterattack on 7 January on Al-Bahra failed. ISIL official media stated it had recaptured Gharanij on 9 January in addition to killing 20 SDF fighters. SOHR reported on 10 January that SDF had released more than 400 Syrian ISIL members in Deir Ezzor. It added that out of the 400, 120 former ISIL fighters had joined the SDF. The US-led anti-ISIL Coalition however later on 15 January denied the allegations that SDF had recruited former ISIL fighters. ISIL-affiliated media stated that an Uzbek suicide bomber killed or injured 20 SDF fighters during the night on 10 January. The U.S. DoD announced in February that ISIL brigade commander Aysh al Dagestani was killed in an airstrike near Kashmah on 12 January. ISIL captured Gharanij for the third time in three weeks from SDF following a counter-attack on 13 January. Meanwhile, pro-Kurdish and Coalition sources stated 100 ISIL fighters had been killed during the overall battle for the town, while ISIL stated 50-70 SDF fighters had been killed in the battle. On 16 January, a VBIED attack in Gharanij forced the SDF to retreat from some parts of the town, though retaining control of half of it. Pro-ISIL Wafa Media announced on 18 January that former German rapper Denis Cuspert had been killed by an airstrike during a battle in Gharanij. Cuspert was a fighter, recruiter and propagandist for ISIL. It released reported images of his corpse, stating he died on 17 January. The Coalition later stated that 145-150 militants were killed in US airstrikes on an ISIL headquarters near al-Shafaah on the same day. = Entering the Middle Euphrates Valley = French artillery fires at ISIL positions during the campaign After capturing Gharanij, the SDF in February shifted their attention to secure complete control of Al-Bahrah, whose control had changed twice. The capture of Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, members of ISIL's cell called \\"The Beatles\\", was reported in February. The two had been caught a month earlier near Deir ez- Zor, in the Euphrates Valley. ISIL attacked SDF positions in al-Bahrah twice with VBIEDs on 10 February, resulting in dozens of dead and wounded in their ranks. Amaq stated on 11 February that the SDF had been accidentally bombed by the Coalition during clashes with ISIL in al-Sosa area near Iraqi border. According to a source in Iraqi Popular Mobilisation Units (PMU) on 12 February, their forces had rescued 11 SDF fighters encircled by ISIL near the Iraqi-Syrian border. The SDF announced on 18 February that Sjoerd Heeger, a Dutch member of theirs, was killed fighting ISIL on 12 February. Syria's state-run news agency SANA stated US airstrikes killed 16 people in al-Bahrah on 19 February and 12 in Hajin on 21 February. SOHR stated that US airstrikes on al-Shaafah on 26 February killed 25 civilians. The Pentagon acknowledged on 5 March that the Turkish military operation in Afrin had led to an \\"operational pause\\" in the offensive. A spokesman Major Adrian Rankine- Galloway stated that they had seen SDF fighters leave the offensive in Middle Euphrates Valley to fight elsewhere. On 6 March, the SDF announced that it had shifted 1,700 members from frontlines in the Middle Euphrates Valley to Afrin.  The campaign resumes  U.S. Marines fire mortars at a known ISIL position in the Middle Euphrates Valley in October 2018 On 1 May 2018, the SDF, backed by the US-led Coalition, and in coordination with the Iraqi Armed Forces, announced the restart of the offensive to clear the Iraqi-Syria border and middle Euphrates river valley of ISIL remnants, in what the Coalition called Operation Roundup. On 3 May, Syriac Military Council and SDF spokesperson Kino Gabriel stated that SDF forces had advanced 8 kilometers (4.97 mi.) into ISIL territory on the al-Bughuz axis along the Iraqi border near the Euphrates river valley. On 8 May, an official YPG Twitter account posted images of SDF forces using mine-resistant ambush protected vehicles (MRAPs) partaking in an assault on ISIL front lines. The vehicle was previously unauthorized to be provisioned to SDF forces; Pentagon spokesman Marine Maj. Adrian Rankine-Galloway confirmed to Military Times that the US is providing MRAPs to the Syrian Arab Coalition, which he called \\"an essential component of the SDF.\\" On 10 May, Coalition forces announced the capturing of five senior ISIL commanders in a joint cross-border raid with SDF and Iraqi forces, in what Coalition officials called a \\"significant blow\\" to ISIL. The news prompted US President Donald Trump to announce on Twitter: \\"Five Most Wanted leaders of ISIS just captured!\\" = Capturing the Syrian-Iraqi border = Video about the capture of a border town during the campaign By 13 May, the SDF had reportedly besieged and imposed full control over al-Baghuz Tahtani village – the first settlement seized from ISIL since the resumption of the desert offensive – on the east bank of the Euphrates, officially cutting ISIL access to the Iraqi border along the river. By 14 May, the SDF were conducting mine and tunnel clearing operations in al-Baghuz Tahtani as they had said to have taken a total of 64 kilometers of territory from ISIL. SOHR also reported that 18 ISIL fighters were killed in Coalition airstrikes in the town of al-Bahrah, further north along the river. Also on the same day, USCENTCOM commander Joseph Votel, Coalition commander Paul E. Funk II and other US personnel held a meeting with SDF leaders to \\"gain a better understanding of the fight against Daesh in the Middle Euphrates River Valley.\\" On 17 May, after several weeks of clashes, the SDF captured a number of border posts near Abu Kamal, completely besieging ISIL's Middle Euphrates Valley pocket between SDF forces and Syrian Army forces. By 20 July, after a couple months of clashes, the SDF had fully cleared ISIL from the southeastern al-Hasakah countryside, significantly reducing ISIL's border region pocket to the eastern Deir ez-Zor Province. On 4 August, the SDF fully captured the remainder of ISIL's Iraqi–Syrian border pocket in the eastern Deir ez-Zor countryside, reducing ISIL's territorial control to a single pocket in the Middle Euphrates Valley, in the area between Hajin and Abu Kamal. The SDF subsequently began preparations for the third and final phase of the operation, while ISIL launched counter-attacks in the al-Malh oil well area. Experts considered it likely that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was hiding in this last pocket.  Third phase  A sandstorm near the Iraqi-Syrian border on 13 June 2018. The Islamic State often used sandstorms and poor weather conditions as cover for their ground assaults On 10 September, the SDF began to advance from 4 different fronts towards the areas controlled by the ISIL – the pocket with Hajin, al-Susa, al-Shafa, and the neighboring villages straddling the eastern banks of the Euphrates river. On the following day, 11 September, the third and final phase of the operation officially commenced, under the code name of \\"Terrorism Defeat Battle\\". According to the SDF, the first defense lines of ISIL were broken on September 13. On 20 September, the SDF fully captured Al-Baghuz Fawqani and secured the destroyed bridge to al-Bukamal. On the same day, ISIL launched a counterattack targeting the SDF in Al-Baghuz Fawqani; in the counterattack, ISIL stated to have killed 20 fighters from the Syrian Democratic Forces. On 25 September, the SDF captured the village of Ash Shājilah, north of Al-Baghuz Fawqani. The next day, ISIL conducted multiple SVBIED attacks on SDF positions in Al-Baghuz Fawqani, reportedly killing and injuring scores of SDF-affiliated Kurdish fighters, with a heavy firefight occurring soon after between ISIL and American-backed Kurdish forces in the town. Despite heavy resistance, the SDF continued to advance north of Al- Baghuz Fawqani and captured parts of al-Marashidah village, just southwest of al-Susah. = ISIL breakout = The furthest extent of SDF advances prior to Islamic State counterattacks in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, 25 October 2018. On 10 October, ISIL launched a large counterattack under the cover of a large sandstorm, which resulted in the death of a French YPG volunteer, while they also managed to capture an MRAP-style vehicle from the Syrian Democratic Forces near the town of Baghuz Fawqani. On 12 October, ISIL continued its counterattack, which resulted in the killing and capturing of at least 45 SDF fighters, as well as the recapture of multiple positions. On 19 October, ISIL reportedly infiltrated and crossed through areas held by Syrian governmental forces and their allies, to reinforce its Euphrates pocket from the Syrian Desert. On 20 October, The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated that the international Coalition had carried out two \\"massacres\\" via airstrikes in al- Susah, resulting in the deaths of 58, including 41 civilians, with ISIL only receiving 11–17 casualties in the strikes; 10 children were also reported to have been killed. On 22 October, the SDF launched a new assault on ISIL positions in al-Susah, resulting in half of the town being captured and al- Marashidah being cut off. They also disabled an ISIL SVBIED by killing the driver, reportedly with a sniper rifle. On 23 October, the SDF continued their advance after clashes continued through the night. ISIL attempted to counterattack and reportedly used 4 SVBIEDs on SDF positions in Susah. Under heavy air and artillery support, the SDF repelled the offensive and restarted the attack. In the morning, they took the village of Hawi al Susah, which is adjacent to the town of Susah. In Hajin, sporadic clashes continued between the two sides. On 24 October, fighting in Susah was still intense. Over the night, ISIL launched several assaults using armored cars and SVBIEDs to break through the encirclement of Marashidah, in which they still had fighters, and to push back the SDF before they can consolidate their positions. Under heavy artillery bombardment, they temporarily opened a corridor, which allowed some of their units to escape. The SDF stated to have killed 10 fighters themselves, as well as destroying a vehicle and a SVBIED, while the Coalition reportedly killed another 41 ISIL militants with airstrikes and artillery. On the same day, the Coalition stated on Twitter to have bombed a mosque in Susah that was being used by ISIL as a fighting position. The Euphrates pocket by 31 October 2018, showing SDF territorial loss after ISIL counterattacks On 27 October, ISIL launched a massive counterattack under the cover of a sandstorm, and managed to recapture parts of al-Susah, and they also reached the outskirts of al-Baghuz Fawqani. The SDF's Deir ez-Zor Military Council suffered heavy losses, and YPG units were moved to the frontline in order to stabilize the front. After even further setbacks, the SDF retreated from all captured positions in the Hajin pocket on October 28, effectively concluding their seven-week offensive without any gains. ISIL continued its counterattack on 29 October with the group retaking control of the towns of Marshidah, Mouzan, Safafinah, Shajlah, and Baghouz al-Fawqani as well as al-Susah from the SDF, forcing the Kurds to retreat after becoming overwhelmed. In response to the successful ISIL counterattack along the Iraqi-Syrian border, the Popular Mobilization Forces were deployed along the Iraqi side of the border in the Anbar Governorate, in fears of an ISIL cross-border infiltration. On Twitter, pictures from the town of Jabal al-Baghouz showed ISIL flags being raised in the town. Coalition spokesman Colonel Sean Ryan said that Coalition elements were helping \\"expedite\\" SDF reinforcement and resupply efforts, stated that ISIL was making a \\"last stand\\" in the pocket. After skirmishes between Turkish Armed Forces and Kurdish elements in Kobanî and Tell Abyad, the SDF once again halted the offensive against ISIL. Despite the main offensive being on hold, on 6 November, the SDF Press Office announced that 49 ISIL fighters had been killed after the Islamic State launched attacks on the Hajin front that were repulsed within the previous 24 hours; three tunnels, 10 compounds, and a \\"bomb-laden vehicle\\" were all destroyed by the SDF. In addition, the Coalition bombed 27 targets. On the same day, the Iraqi Al Mada newspaper reported that the PMU had crossed into Syrian territory and seized 30 fortified border posts in areas previously abandoned by the SDF due to the 26 October ISIL counterattack. US commando prepares to launch a RQ-20 Puma scout drone near Hajin, 19 November On 11 November, the SDF announced that they had restarted the offensive. During the intermediary period of halted ground operations, the Coalition continued a heavy bombardment campaign targeting ISIL fighting positions, tunnels, mortars, staging areas, and weapons caches. It was reported that individual houses of ISIL commanders were being given out by spies, as well as locations of weapons caches, and that ISIL had executed a civilian on charges of being a spy, but this was not confirmed by any official source. On 23–24 November, around 500 ISIL fighters took advantage of foggy, low-visibility weather to attempt a breakout of the Hajin pocket, by launching a \\"broad\\" counterattack north of Hajin towards al- Bahrah, Gharanij, and the al-Tanak oilfield, killing at least 47 SDF soldiers - 29 on Saturday alone – in the assaults; in turn, 39 ISIL militants were killed in both ground clashes and Coalition airstrikes. The village of al- Bahrah was reportedly captured by ISIL, while the other two assaults were repelled. The SOHR added that Coalition air raids also killed 17 civilians – including five children – during the clashes. Coalition spokesman Sean Ryan denied receiving reports of civilian casualties and that close air support had been \\"very limited\\" due to bad weather. Furthermore, ISIL stated to have captured at least 10 SDF fighters – including a commander – during the counterattack, with the group subsequently releasing images and video to corroborate the statement. By 26 November, as ISIL fighters had largely retreated back to their previous positions after Coalition-supported SDF push back, the fighting had reportedly killed over 200 people as more bodies were recovered on the 25th. SOHR reported 51 civilians had been killed and 92 SDF fighters were killed in the weekend fighting, the \\"largest number of SDF fighters killed (by IS) in a single battle since it was founded\\". = Battle of Hajin = CJTF-OIR Coalition ISR drone footage of an ISIL gunman shooting from within the Hajin hospital, 9 December 2018 On 3 December, local activist sources reported that SDF forces had advanced on ISIL's de facto capital of Hajin and had broken into the town after overrunning ISIL defenses on its northwestern flank from al-Bahrah. By 4 December, SDF forces had reportedly advanced into the northern sector of Hajin, capturing the local hospital and the al-Hawamah neighborhood and market area. On 6 December, Redur Khalil, an SDF commander, confirmed their forces had pushed into Hajin and had taken portions of the town, including some neighborhoods and a mosque, but not the hospital, amidst ongoing heavy clashes. By 7 December the SDF had taken about half of the town and had also opened a humanitarian corridor for Hajin, allowing over 1,000 civilians – mostly women and children – to flee ISIL's embattled capital. The Coalition stepped up airstrikes to support the SDF's advance, with a 5 December press release detailing multiple strikes conducted near Hajin targeting ISIL supply routes, tunnels, fighting positions and trucks. Syrian state media stated a Coalition airstrike in Hajin on 7 December completely destroyed the local hospital along with killing eight civilians, all from the same family. The Coalition denied civilian casualties in their airstrikes and disputed that the hospital was destroyed. On 11 December, Coalition spokesman Col. Sean Ryan confirmed to Talk Media News that the Hajin hospital was not bombed on 7 December and that SDF units began receiving small arms fire from ISIL elements on the second and third floors of the facility on 8 December as it was being used as a \\"command and control node\\" by the terror group due to its strategic location. The next day an explosion occurred at the building, to which the Coalition stated was the result of rigged explosives placed by ISIL; when SDF units captured the hospital on 10 December, they reported the building was \\"heavily mined with IEDs\\" in the remaining structure. On 11 December, the SDF, along with reversing some of ISIL's recent gains and making fresh advancements in Hajin, managed to recapture the border town of al-Baghuz Tahtani, securing the entire Syrian-Iraqi border once again and regaining much of the lost territory from the October ISIL counterattacks. By 12 December, the Coalition estimated there were still 2,500 of the \\"most hardened\\" ISIL fighters in the Hajin holdout. US Special Presidential Envoy to the anti-ISIL Coalition Brett H. McGurk said \\"We've gotten to a point where almost every ISIS fighter is wearing a suicide vest, the extent of IEDs and placements, it's very, very difficult fighting and so it's taking some time.\\" Since the initial break-in of western Hajin, recent SDF front line advances in the town had been modest and methodical as ISIL reportedly had placed many mines and IEDs in residential areas, dug an extensive tunnel network, and had snipers placed in taller buildings – along with reportedly using stranded civilians as human shields, according to SDF fighters on the ground. Furthermore, 2,500 civilians had by now fled towards SDF territory as the SDF reported to have killed 55 ISIL militants since entering Hajin. By 13 December heavy clashes continued in the town center as Coalition airstrikes continued to bombard ISIL positions. As the SDF advanced, capturing two more hospitals in the process, ISIL detonated 5 booby trapped vehicles in an attempt to hinder SDF progress, but the traps failed. Later in the day, SOHR and local unofficial sources reported that Islamic State defenses in Hajin had collapsed and the jihadist forces were fleeing to the stronghold's eastern outskirts; Kurdish Twitter accounts showed the SDF flag perched atop the main bazaar, signaling the SDF had indeed captured the town center. By dawn on 14 December, SDF forces – spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG – fully captured Hajin as ISIL defenses collapsed, due to an intensified ground push supported by increased Coalition airstrikes. The capture of Hajin town proper deprived the Islamic State of a significant command and control hub, and the terror network's last chunk of significant urban territory; ISIL's battered militants, aided by tunnel networks, withdrew south to the rural village areas east of the Euphrates river and west of SDF positions along the Iraqi border. SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali confirmed that sporadic pockets of ISIL elements were still harassing and counterattacking Hajin post-capture in the surrounding fields and outskirts and that the fight for the town was \\"difficult\\" as the entrenched ISIL fighters the SDF besieged were hardened veterans from Iraq and Syria \\"fighting to the death\\", putting up stubborn resistance and stiff defenses. Europe-based Syrian opposition activist Omar Abu Layla stated that disagreements among ISIL ranks over hierarchy between Iraqi and Syrian fighters helped \\"speed up the collapse\\" of the extremist group's defenses in the town. SOHR added that since the launch of the third phase of the Deir ez- Zor campaign on 10 September, 922 ISIL gunmen, 539 SDF fighters, and 324 civilians – of which were 113 children and 72 women – had died in the deadly fighting for the enclave. SOHR continued that the majority of the civilian casualties were from international Coalition airstrikes. = Clearing the Euphrates pocket = With the capture of the Hajin stronghold – the Islamic State's last de facto capital – on 14 December, ISIL fighters retreated to the remaining rural villages still under their grasp within the pocket. SDF commander-in-chief Mazlum Kobane said that at least 5,000 ISIL fighters were still in the remaining pocket. He said about 2,000 are foreign members, mostly Arabs and Europeans with their families. The U.S. estimated there were still a diehard contingent of 2,500 ISIL fighters entrenched within the remaining enclave as the Islamic State still controlled the villages of Al-Susah, Al- Marashidah, Al-Shaafah, al-Baghuz Fawqani, al-Shajla and surrounding settlements. It was reported that more than 700 prisoners including deserters were executed by ISIL since it lost Hajin. An SDF-U.S. checkpoint, 23 December 2018 On 14 December, SDF forces reportedly advanced south of Hajin, pushing towards the towns of Abu Hassan and Abu Al-Khatir amidst ongoing clashes. It was also reported that ISIL was attempting to break through SDF defenses and retake Baghuz Tahtani, in the southern sector of the pocket, on the Iraqi border. By 21 December, after capturing the al-Qal'ah area southwest of Hajin, SDF troops reportedly made a major advancement in the town of Abu al-Khatir, as Coalition airstrikes pounded ISIL units and forced them to fall back to the town center. Local sources also reported that ISIL had made Al-Susah its new headquarters. On 25 December, local sources confirmed the SDF had taken the key town of Abu al-Khatir after days of clashes, with the help of continued Coalition airstrikes, securing an adequate buffer zone around Hajin; subsequent clashes were reported in Abu Hassan as the SDF continued its advance southward, down the Euphrates. The SOHR reported that the SDF had rounded up 262 ISIL militants trying to flee among the civilian exodus from the region by 25 December; 5,500 civilians had so far reportedly fled the pocket since the announcement of the withdrawal of US troops from Syria on 19 December. Local activist sources reported on the 28th that the SDF had captured half of Al-Kashmah with ISIL still occupying the southern half; capturing Al-Kashmah would put the SDF within adequate striking distance of Al-Shaafah for the first time. The SDF made limited advances on the Al-Kashmah front and the al-Susah axis against ISIL forces by 30 December, with SDF contact lines reportedly reaching near the immediate eastern outskirts of al- Susah, while the SDF controlled around 70 percent of Al-Kashmah, with fierce clashes raging. By 31 December, the SDF had fully captured Al-Kashmah and were fighting for control of Al-Shaafah, the last major town from the northern approach before ISIL's Al-Susah. On 5 January 2019, two British special forces soldiers (presumably from the Special Air Service) were injured in an attack carried out by ISIL; one Kurd also died. US troops evacuated the two soldiers. On 7 January, the SOHR reported that ISIL units took advantage of bad weather and launched a counteroffensive against the SDF in the pocket, killing 23 and wounding others, while ISIL suffered 9 casualties. By the next day, the SDF had repelled the offensive and had gained more ground from ISIL near the Iraqi border. On the same day, Coalition warplanes and artillery continued to bombard the town of Al-Shaafah, as the SDF continued its approach towards Al- Susah. On 9 January the SDF released images of eight foreign ISIL fighters their units had captured during a recent \\"special operation\\". The captured included Russian, German, Uzbek, Tajik, Ukrainian and Kazakh nationals, as well as an American teenager. On 10 January the SDF reportedly fully captured Al-Shaafah after expelling ISIL fighters in a counterattack. The SDF continued to advance on the Abu Badran area. With continued US and French airstrikes in support, SDF forces reportedly captured most of Abu Badran after overrunning ISIL defenses in the northern portion of the village on 13 January. After the recent gains in the pocket against ISIL and ramping up their attacks in the previous two days, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali told Reuters that ISIL \\"are living the final moments and realize that this battle is the battle to eliminate them.\\" On 15 January, the SDF's Deir ez-Zor Military Council, the spearheading fighting force during the campaign, launched a final major push south to storm al-Susah, after capturing Abu Badran and the al-Ulay'at region from ISIL forces. At the time, it was believed that ISIL's central command was headquartered at al-Susah and that their leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi may also potentially be held up there. On the same day, reports emerged – particularly from the SOHR – that the SDF had already pushed ISIL out of al-Susah, but this was not confirmed by the SDF or the Coalition. Frontline reports confirmed the SDF had fully taken al-Susah by 17 January, with ISIL combatants ultimately retreating further southward to avoid being overrun. The loss of al-Susah was a heavy blow against the Islamic State, as the terrorist organization's territorial control in the pocket had dwindled to four key towns: Al- Marashidah, Mozan, al-Shajlah, and as-Safafinah (though clashes still continued at Al-Baghuz Fawqani). Following the capture of al-Susah, reports emerged of shelling in al-Marashidah and of ISIL targeting SDF units in al- Susah with VBIEDs. On the next day, the SDF's media center released a report detailing their recent engagements. Under near-constant Coalition air support, SDF fighters advanced 1.5 km, capturing 32 new points on a secondary front line of the Al-Susah axis, leading to separate heavy clashes with ISIL, in which SDF troops seized ammo and weapons from slain ISIL fighters, including SDF troops detonating four ISIL motorbikes loaded with explosives. Afterward, ISIL once again took advantage of bad weather and launched raids on SDF frontline positions, but were repelled. The SDF reported that 88 ISIL fighters had been killed, while they lost 10 of their own fighters with an additional 30 wounded. On 20 January, the SOHR reported that Coalition airstrikes on Al- Baghuz Fawqani had killed six civilians, including four children, as well as killing 10 ISIL militants. Coalition airstrikes reportedly intensified after the ISIL-claimed Manbij bombing that claimed the lives of four Americans. SDF fighters near Hajin, 22 January 2019 By 22 January, the SDF had managed to capture 75 percent of as-Safafinah, after capturing the Mozan rural area, confining ISIL to just two remaining villages – al-Shajlah and al-Marashidah – along the Euphrates River. Heavy clashes continued on the outskirts of al- Shajlah and the al-Baghuz Fawqani front, with half of the latter town under SDF control. As ISIL's territorial control was being squeezed out due to the string of recent losses, a massive influx of fleeing civilians ensued, with hundreds leaving the increasingly-small pocket on 22 January, most of them family members of ISIL militants. The civilian exodus continued, as SDF and Kurdish social media accounts posted pictures reportedly showing the relatives of Islamic State fighters fleeing; many of them included nationals from France, Pakistan, Iraq, and Turkey. Morale among remaining jihadist fighters hit an all-time low, with the fighters surrendering in the dozens (as per ANHA) to hundreds (as per SOHR) with reportedly over 60 fighters – 50 of them foreign – surrendering to the SDF in recent days. SOHR reported that 4,900 people – including 470 surrendered ISIL fighters – had fled the enclave since 21 January, 3,500 on 22 January alone. Meanwhile, the whereabouts and fate of ISIL's elusive leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi were still unknown. The SOHR also reported that the new wave of departures meant that a total of 27,000 people had by now fled the enclave since early December 2018. Zana Amedia, an SDF spokesman, attributed their ground momentum in recent weeks to a change of investment tactics after their frontlines collapsed in late October 2018, due to an aggressive ISIL counterattack during a sandstorm. “After that, the leadership took a decision to change tactics, and moved us to attacking on two — or even three — axes so that the small force that ISIS has cannot counter,” said Amedia. “Right now, the operation is going on two axes — from the north, we are attacking the village of Al-Marashidah, and from the south, the village of Baghuz.” The SDF fully overran and recaptured al-Baghuz Fawqani on 23 January, after weeks of desperate ISIL resistance there ended with the collapse of their forces; the SDF promptly began mine-clearing and sweeping operations in the surrounding farms and communities, to find any hiding enemy militants. The capture of Baghuz Fawqani prompted the SOHR to proclaim the imminent defeat of ISIL in Deir ez-Zor, with the jihadist group only possessing 10 square km of remaining territory in the Middle Euphrates Pocket, and the remainder of their die-hard combatants holed up in scattered homesteads among the irrigated fields and orchards on the north bank of the valley. The US-led Coalition declined to say when it expected the SDF to capture the last chunk of ISIL territory, with spokesman Sean Ryan instead emphasizing that the bigger goal of the operation was to minimize and degrade ISIL's insurgency and terror capabilities by depriving them of physical space to operate. \\"We try to stay away from timelines as it is more about degrading the enemy's capabilities,\\" Ryan said. On the same day, the villages of as- Safafinah and al-Shajlah were also reported to have been overrun by the SDF backed by heavy French and American shelling, leaving al-Marashidah as the last stronghold in ISIL's grip – merely 0.01 percent of the territory its self-proclaimed caliphate once held. = ISIL's last stand = On 24 January, SDF forces began swiftly crossing the northern bridge into al- Marashidah – ISIL's then-final stronghold – forcing ISIL to withdraw towards the center of the town. In response, ISIL launched a counterattack and regained parts of al-Shajlah before the attack was repelled. By the next day, another counterattack allowed ISIL to regain parts of western Baghuz Fawqani, to the south of the area, with ISIL attempting to break the SDF's siege with suicide attacks. During ISIL's attempted breakout, Syrian Arab Army units that had deployed across the river targeted the Islamic State's poorly established positions at the town as well, indirectly assisting the Kurds. 35 ISIL fighters were killed and another 21 captured during the failed breakout attempt; in turn, 16 SDF fighters were killed and at least 30 were injured. At this point, SDF commander Mazloum Kobani predicted that the SDF would complete their campaign and end ISIL's military presence within a \\"month\\", only declaring victory after establishing control over the captured lands. On 25 January, ANHA reported that 150 ISIL fighters surrendered to the SDF in al- Baghuz Fawqani, with most of them being foreign fighters. The front lines at Baghuz Fawqani remained fluid on the 26th as Coalition bombardment continued on the village with ISIL continuing stiff resistance in south Marashidah as units from the Free Syrian Army's Kurdish-aligned Northern Democratic Brigade reportedly clashed with ISIL in northern Marashidah. Reports also emerged that an ISIL commander named Bashar Al-Mughbel was killed in Coalition airstrikes in Baghuz Fawqani as SOHR reported that Coalition air raids and short-range missile strikes on hamlets and other civilian areas had killed 42 people in the pocket in recent days, including 13 civilians consisting of seven Syrians linked to ISIL – including three children from the same family – and six Iraqi non-combatants. Overnight clashes between the 26th and 27th killed 19 ISIL and 11 SDF fighters, SOHR reported, adding that the aerial bombardment was some of the fiercest in two weeks. Additionally, 4 SVBIEDs targeted SDF positions when ISIL mounted another counterattack to break the siege. By 27 January it became clear that Kurdish and US officials did not believe ISIL's leader Abu Bakr al- Baghdadi was still holed up in the pocket. “He would have to be stupid to stay in the last pocket until the end,” SDF spokesman Zana Amedi said. “He would have escaped a long time ago before the situation deteriorated for them so much. He’s not dead, and he’s not in these villages, either.” On 28 January the SDF managed to capture parts of northern Al-Marashidah and besieged ISIL within a space of only 4 square kilometers of land, boxing them up against the Euphrates.As clashes continued, SDF commander Heval Roni commented, \\"Geographically speaking, there are only four square kilometres left under IS control, stretching from Baghouz to the Iraqi border\\". He also stated that the dwindling number of remaining ISIL officers and commanders were mostly Iraqi. Meanwhile, SOHR reported some 2,000 people, including 300 ISIL gunmen, had fled the area since the 27th; among the commotion, the SDF captured a local ISIL commander and a body guard.  Civilian exodus  By 28 January, ISIL was reported to have parts of al-Marashidah, al-Arqoub, Safafinah, and Baghuz Fawqani villages still under their control, as well as some orchards in the town of Al-Susah. On 29 January, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali told Reuters that instead of an all-out storming of the last bastion of ISIL territory, the SDF's advance had slowed due to the large presence of civilians, many of whom were wives or children of ISIL fighters. Bali added that they were conducting \\"precise operations\\", which took more time. He added that the SDF had also refused an offer from the jihadists via mediators to surrender the territory in return for safe passage out. The International Rescue Committee charity organization said it was helping tend to a sudden influx of more than 10,000 people, almost all of whom were women, children, and elderly people, who had arrived at an internally displaced persons camp in Al-Hawl in northeastern Syria, since the previous week. The IRC said most of them were exhausted, extremely hungry, and thirsty as they fled ISIL territory, with many arriving barefoot. Meanwhile, acting U.S. Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan stated that the remaining territory will be taken in a few weeks. On 30 January, it was reported that a Coalition air raid over Marashidah killed Mohammed Mahmoud al-Abadi (Abu Osama al-Qurashi), a senior ISIL figure that held several positions in the Islamic State, including commander of the “Islamic Police”, Minister of Oil, and senior security commander. Meanwhile, the Kurdistan Region's Special Office for Yezidi Abductees Affairs reported that SDF units had freed three Yazidi prisoners from ISIL – aged 12, 30, and 40 – during their ongoing conquest against ISIL. Islamic State jihadists reportedly abducted these women when they entered the Sinjar region in 2014. On 15 January an Iraqi official stated that ISIL elements were still trafficking Yazidi women across Iraq and Syria despite the collapse of their \\"caliphate\\". On 31 January, the SDF made limited advances between Safafinah and Baghuz Fawqani while also advancing on Arqoub (western Marashidah), a strategically important sector for ISIL as they've used the bridge there to cross the river to escape to their refuge in the Syrian desert. Later, the SDF pulled back from some areas of Baghuz Fawqani to avoid harming civilians. More than 150 people were rescued. By the end of the month, ISIL reportedly still controlled Baghuz Tahtani on the Iraqi border as well after an SDF tactical retreat. With the large number of civilians fleeing the war zone, the SDF had significantly slowed down their advance by February 1, in fear of ISIL using non-combatants as human shields. SDF-ISIL clashes in the pocket also decreased in intensity as ISIL tried to negotiate for a safe passage to evacuate towards the Turkish border. The SDF and the Coalition rejected this, instead demanding a full surrender from the remaining jihadists and their commanders. Meanwhile, it was reported that after the previous ISIL commander was killed, a Saudi named al- Jazrawi was in command of the remaining pocket. During this lull in ground clashes, civilians continued to leave ISIL areas in droves with SDF and American SOF soldiers handing out water, nappies and MREs to the families of ISIL members and other civilians at makeshift screening centers set up to help process the outflow of people; among the often haggard, famished, and dust- covered IDPs, males were screened separately in search of fleeing ISIL militants, who were known to be mixing in with the innocent civilians. In the early morning of 5 February, 5 Turkish families surrendered themselves along with other women and children. On February 6, 12 Iraqi families, 14 Syrian families, four Azerbaijani families, and two Canadian women surrendered themselves to the SDF. Five ISIL child soldiers aged between 14 and 15 also surrendered. Meanwhile, the Coalition carried out two airstrikes on Baghuz Fawqani after an Iraqi drone was shot down, in the first airstrikes in days. Voice of America report on the Al-Hawl refugee camp, 7 February 2019 On 6 February, US President Donald Trump, while at a summit of 79 foreign ministers and officials that have partaken in the global coalition against ISIL, predicted a formal announcement of a final victory against ISIL as early as the upcoming week despite front line advances recently being halted. \\"Remnants - that's all they have, remnants - but remnants can be very dangerous,\\" Trump said in regards to ISIL. \\"Rest assured, we'll do what it takes to defeat every ounce and every last person within the ISIS madness\\". In regards to captured militants, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said that the SDF is detaining foreign ISIL fighters on a \\"daily basis.\\" Suspected militants captured by the SDF are usually eager to be sent home, something the Kurdish administration also wants. Human Rights Watch has warned that any transfers of suspected foreign militants and their relatives out of Syria should be a transparent process. On 7 February, the SDF captured Al-Marashidah and its western district of Arqoub, as well as other areas nearby, completely besieging the remaining ISIL fighters in the town of Al-Baghuz Fawqani, to the south of Al-Marashidah. Later on the same day, SDF commander Adel Cudi stated that the SDF controlled 80% of Baghuz Fawqani and were advancing slowly against the last ISIL-held positions. Late on 8 February, Mustafa Bali said that the SDF would launch a final assault on the remainder of the enclave once civilians had been completely evacuated. \\"There is of course a safe corridor and civilians are coming out daily, and this reduces their number in Baghouz until we can be sure the town is free of civilians,\\" Bali said. \\"We will launch an attack to end the Daesh presence or they will turn themselves in. There are no other options for them. We confirm there are no negotiations and no intention to have negotiations,\\" he added.  Final assault  The SDF's conquest of the ISIL enclave from 30 November 2018 to 23 March 2019 On the evening of 9 February, the Syrian Democratic Forces announced that they were launching the final \\"decisive\\" battle, after nearly ten days of evacuating 20,000 civilians, most of whom were ISIL family members. Redur Kalil, the SDF's senior public relations officer, told The Times newspaper that a number of foreign hostages were possibly being held in the enclave. The operation began with a heavy preemptive bombardment during the afternoon, from the SDF missile and mortar teams and Coalition warplanes. The Coalition estimated ISIL still had around 1,000–1,500 of its most loyal jihadist fighters still fighting within the enclave, though the SDF and SOHR estimated that ISIL still had around 3,000 fighters within the enclave. Between 9–10 February, the SDF was able to capture a total of 2 square kilometers and seized control of 41 tactical points. The SDF reported the deaths of 37 ISIL members, along with the destruction of 19 locations, one enemy motorbike, four roads, one mortar, and one weapons cache in the preemptive airstrikes leading up to the assault, while only losing two of their own. The Syrian government stated the recent airstrikes had killed several civilians, including four people near a makeshift refugee camp near Baghuz. On the morning of 11 February, the SDF repelled another ISIL counterattack, as another 1,500 civilians fled the area in a column of 17 trucks filled with men, women, and children, some identifying as Iraqi. The SDF advance was gradual and precise, as hundreds of civilians continued to stream out of the war zone into SDF-Coalition screening centers, set up to filter out fleeing jihadists. On 12 February, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali announced that ISIL had only control over 1 square kilometer of territory, and that all those remaining in the area were ISIL militants and their families. On 16 February, one week into the battle, SDF commander Jiya Furat stated that the besieged pocket was reduced to an encircled 700 square meters and that a declaration of victory against ISIL in the pocket was soon to come. The battle had stalled into a standoff by late February, as the SDF chose to wait until every possible civilian fled the remaining territory before storming it, delaying declaration of victory and extending the battle into a protracted siege. Attrition became a larger factor as the surrounded jihadists were letting their families, other hostages, and more expendable fighters leave due to dwindling food resources from the SDF's encirclement, with hundreds of civilians and dozens of surrendering militants regularly flowing out of the enclave. The evacuees included shattered families that lost loved ones and wounded, exhausted and hungry men, women, and children. A number of the fleeing wives were interviewed by international media, giving accounts of their journey to and conditions under ISIL's \\"caliphate\\", some describing how they lived in dug-up holes with hoisted tents to protect against airstrikes. While some were more critical, others proclaimed their continuing devotion to the idea of the Islamic State, even after surrender. \\"We weren't going to leave, but the Caliph said women should leave,\\" said one mother, referring to ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi reportedly ordering women and children to leave. \\"I wanted to stay. It is an Islamic State. It is land of Islam,\\" she added. SDF officials have denied they are negotiating with ISIL, but Coalition spokesman Sean Ryan confirmed on 6 March that negotiations were taking place, through which the SDF was \\"diligently\\" trying to find out information regarding any hostages held by ISIL. The camp at Al-Baghuz Fawqani under nighttime siege, 12 March 2019 By 9 March, one month into the protracted battle/stand-off, many evacuating ISIL militants and their families remained unrepentant and devoted to the \\"caliphate\\". Around two dozen interviewed evacuees described their last days in the besieged camp and how ISIL's Hisbah religious police continued to maintain order and religious enforcement in the camp amidst SDF-Coalition encirclement. The Hisbah oversaw the civilian evacuations from ISIL's end, seeing the SDF's evacuation attempts as facilitating their longevity. According to media reports, a number of the evacuees sometimes berated and harassed reporters and photographers at evacuation areas. Others spoke about their situation; many were still devoted to ISIL and hoping for future \\"conquests\\", while some were more ambivalent. They saw the caliphate's collapse as punishment from God due to corruption among ISIL leadership and officials. On 17 March, the SDF released their figures on the operation since 9 January: 34,000 total civilians evacuated, 29,600 ISIL fighters and their family members surrendered, including more than 5,000 fighters, 1,306 ISIL militants killed, and 520 captured in operations. In turn, they put their casualties at 11 dead and 61 injured. On 23 March, the SDF announced full liberation of ISIL's enclave, concluding the battle of Baghuz Fawqani and capping off the campaign. The whereabouts of ISIL's leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi remained unknown as the SDF transitioned into counterinsurgency operations.  SDF-government clashes  During the night of 7 February 2018, US forces attacked positions of pro-Syrian government forces with airstrikes, following a pro-government incursion on the frontline with the SDF, stating it was out of self-defense of an SDF headquarters with US observers in Khusham. US officials estimated that more than 100 members of the pro-government forces were killed. Russian Ministry of Defense however stated that the pro-government forces were conducting reconnaissance missions against ISIL. An injured pro-government fighter also stated that SDF forces had infiltrated during the airstrikes in Tabiyyah region but were repelled. There were also reports by pro-opposition sources that clashes had erupted between SDF and SAA and allied pro-government forces. Pro-government Al-Masdar News downplayed these statements and suggested they might have been a scare campaign led by opposition media. On 29 April 2018, the Syrian Army launched an assault on four SDF-held villages on the eastern side of the Euphrates River, initially capturing them. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), nine pro-government and six SDF-affiliated fighters were killed in the clashes. SDF spokesperson Kino Gabriel stated that the clashes were \\"supporting terrorism and an attempt to obstruct the war against terrorism\\". Several hours later, the SDF stated they recaptured all of the villages they lost, Some local sources stated that US-led coalition jets hit pro-government forces attacking the SDF, although the Pentagon stated they only conducted warning airstrikes and did not hit the pro-government troops directly.  Aftermath   ISIL insurgency  On 5 November 2018, the United States's Department of Defense Inspector General determined that ISIL had evolved into \\"an effective clandestine\\" insurgency force operating largely underground in both Iraq and Syria as it lost all territory in Iraq and only possessed 1 percent of Syrian territory at the time. The large scale simultaneous campaigns by the majority-Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces, the Syrian government, and the Iraqi government to incrementally wrest territory from the Islamic State degraded the terror group's ability of power projection and access to the resources and manpower it once took advantage of years prior. As ISIL lost more and more territory in both Iraq and Syria and became cornered in small pockets of territory such as in al-Safa in the Syrian Desert and in the Hajin-Euphrates pocket, the veteran remnants of the group, as is seen with many organizations that utilize guerrilla warfare tactics and strategy, became increasingly dependent on insurgent strategies rather than the previous grand offensives it was able to conduct. As well as bolstering its propaganda efforts, many scattered ISIL fighters and loyalist sleeper cells melted into the local populace and continued terror bombings and attacks, prompting major counterinsurgency operations. On 17 January 2019, the SDF – after nearly capturing all of ISIL's Euphrates pocket – said, \\"With the help of the (U.S.-led) coalition, we will escalate our military operations to eliminate Daesh remnants and chase down their sleeper cells,\\" stating their readiness to wage counterinsurgency operations against the Islamic State post-campaign. On 29 January the US Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats released his Worldwide Threat Assessment, stating that ISIL \\"very likely will continue to pursue external attacks from Iraq and Syria against regional and Western adversaries, including the United States.\\" With the terror group's loss of physical territory, \\"ISIS will seek to exploit Sunni grievances, societal instability, and stretched security forces to regain territory in Iraq and Syria in the long term,\\" returning to its \\"guerrilla warfare roots while continuing to plot attacks and direct its supporters worldwide\\". The assessment added that it did not expect the Assad government to focus on clearing ISIL from Syria post-US withdrawal.  ISIL suspects and detainees  On 21 February 2019, an Iraqi official stated that the SDF had transferred 150 ISIL militants to Iraqi authorities under a deal involving a total of 502, making it the single largest repatriation of ISIL members thus far. On 24 February, the Iraqi Government stated that they received 13 more ISIL suspects from the SDF. Some Iraqi officials stated that all 13 were of French origin. The Syrian Democratic Forces released 283 Syrians that were held for ISIL affiliation on 3 March. SDF authorities said the freed \\"have no Syrian blood on their hands,\\" suggesting that they did not take part in any fighting. The move came after lobbying from tribal chiefs and other local officials. On 20 April, Kosovo repatriated 110 of its citizens from Syria, including 72 children, 32 women, and four men suspected of fighting for ISIL. The men were arrested upon arrival back into the country. They flew back with the help of the U.S. military before police escorted them to an army barracks near the capital, Pristina.

Burnett (later, Cynthia Burnett-Haney; May 1, 1840 - July 24, 1932) was an American educator, lecturer, temperance reformer, and newspaper editor. In 1929, she was recognized by the Florida Newspaper News as Florida's oldest active newspaper woman. Burnett passed her early life in Ohio, but her first temperance movement work was done in Illinois, in 1879, later answering calls for help in Florida, Tennessee, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. In 1885, she was made state organizer of Ohio, and the first year of this appointment, she lectured 165 times, besides holding meetings in the daytime and organizing over 40 unions. Her voice failing, she accepted a call to Utah as teacher in the Methodist Episcopal College, in Salt Lake City. While living there, she was made territorial president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and eight unions and 15 legions were organized by her. Each month, one or more meetings were held by her and the work was further endorsed in a column of a Mormon paper which she edited. Later, she spent a year as state organizer in California and Nevada, and for these efficient services in the West she was made a national organizer in 1889. She spent later years as preceptress of her alma mater, which has become Farmington College. Early life and education Cynthia Samantha Burnett was born in Niles, Ohio, on May 1, 1840. Burnett's early life was divided between home duties and study. Career At the age of 17, she was both a teacher in the public schools near her home and a student in the neighboring academy. The American Civil War affected her life, and she resolved to study for four years in the Western Reserve Seminary, in her own county, from which she was graduated in the classical course in 1868. She at once accepted the position of preceptress and teacher of Latin in Orwell Normal Institute. Three years later, she took the position of teacher of languages in Beaver College. Failing health made a change of climate necessary, and she went to the old home of her mother in Virginia, where she had charge of a training school for teachers. Two years were spent in the Methodist Episcopal College in Tullahoma, Tennessee. There, she became interested in the \\"New South,\\" and many letters to the press in defense of their struggling people. At the first opportunity after the crusade, she donned the white ribbon. Her first public work was done in 1879, in Illinois. Later, she answered calls for help in Florida, Tennessee, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. In 1885, she was made State organizer of Ohio. The first year she lectured 165 times, besides holding meetings in the daytime and organizing over 40 unions. Her voice failing, she accepted a call to Utah, as teacher in the Methodist Episcopal College in Salt Lake City. She was made territorial president of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Eight unions and 15 loyal legions were organized by her. Each month, one or more meetings were held by her in the penitentiary. She edited a temperance column in a Mormon paper. Tabernacles and schoolhouses were open to her, and through the assistance of missionaries and Mormons alike, she lectured in many towns. Unable any longer to work so hard, and believing that her real place was in the lecture field, she accepted a call to southern California as State organizer. She spent one year there and in Nevada, during which time, 150 lectures were given by her. For efficient service in the West she was made National organizer in 1889, but was soon after called home by the serious illness of her mother, and she remained near or with her parents thereafter. She continued her work as State organizer until she accepted the position of preceptress in her alma mater, now Farmington College. Personal life and death After coming to Stuart, Florida, she married Dr. Horace J. Haney (1834-1912). Though they divorced in 1903, she stayed in Stuart. Haney Circle in Stuart was named on her behalf. Burnett died July 24, 1932 in Port Saint Lucie, Florida, and is buried in Fernhill Memorial Gardens and Mausoleum in Stuart.

Cliff original Cliff recorded \\"Trapped\\" as a single that was released in 1972. It was released on Island Records and backed with \\"Struggling Man\\",Thompson, Reggae & Caribbean Music, p. 492. although some websites list the two reversed in some markets (the record saw release in areas that included the United Kingdom, Ghana, and the Caribbean region, but not the United States). Both songs were written during a downturn in Cliff's career that followed his 1960s hits and preceded the mid-1970s successes of the film The Harder They Come. \\"Trapped\\" was arranged by Del Newman and produced by Cat Stevens. Cliff had recorded Stevens' \\"Wild World\\" a couple of years earlier, and here Stevens assembled a production recalling those found on his 1967 album Matthew and Son. The artist credit was billed on the 45-rpm label as being from Jimmy Cliff and Jamaica, the latter apparently being the backing group heard on the record. Writer Dave Marsh has termed the lyric \\"a cruel and vivid crescendo that build[s] to the point of snapping and end[s] each verse and chorus with an expostulated 'Trapped!'\\" In contrast, Lindsay Planer of All Music Guide has termed the song \\"optimistic and funky\\". :Well it seem like I've been playin' the game way too long :And it seems the game I played has made you strong. :Well when the game is over, I won't walk out a loser, :And I know that I'll walk out of here again :And I know that someday I'll walk out of here again : :But now I'm trapped, oh yeah! ... In any case, in this original arrangement for Cliff, the lyric is set against an up-tempo, perky reggae beat with organ, horns, and backing vocals. The Cliff single did not attract much notice at the time and the song fell into obscurity. As Cliff later stated, \\"The single came out on the bottom of the British charts and fell out again. ... It wasn't put out on an album at all.\\" In fact, it did not place at all on the UK Singles Chart's top 100. \\"Trapped\\" was subsequently included on Cliff's mid-1970s compilation album Goodbye Yesterday but that record, too, soon became hard to find. The compilation version may have been edited to have a slightly shorter running time of 3:25. Bruce Springsteen version While on the European leg of The River Tour in Spring 1981, Springsteen purchased a cassette tape of Jimmy Cliff music in Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. He discovered \\"Trapped\\" on it and decided to incorporate it into his act, making an arrangement for the E Street Band that replaced the reggae rhythm with a straight rock one. He additionally substantially recast it as a slower, dirge-like piece framed by Roy Bittan's synthesizer punctuated by arena-style choruses. Springsteen's take on the song was first performed on 29 May 1981, during the opening night of a six-show run at Wembley Arena in London; this was a crucial show for Springsteen in getting past his uncertain past in London dating to the Born to Run tours, and biographer Marsh has termed Springsteen's inclusion of an unknown song in such a show a mark of his artistic fortitude.Marsh, Glory Days, pp. 44–46. \\"Trapped\\" remained in the set list during Springsteen's homecoming leg in the U.S. later in 1981.Marsh, Glory Days, p. 74. \\"Trapped\\" remained in Springsteen's repertoire during the 1984–85 Born in the U.S.A. Tour. One such performance was at Meadowlands Arena in New Jersey on 6 August 1984, which was recorded and later released in April 1985 as one of the previously unreleased selections incorporated on the superstar charity recording for famine relief efforts in Ethiopia, the album We Are the World.We Are the World album liner notes. The album became a chart-topper and sold several million copies, and this \\"Trapped\\" gained considerable airplay, the most of any of the tracks on the album other than the title song.Marsh, Glory Days, p. 302. Among Springsteen audiences it became a favorite during later performances on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour and, with its Springsteen-like themes of both troubles and hope, has often been considered one of the show's anthems.Marsh, Glory Days, p. 290. Though Springsteen's rock version wasn't released as a single, it peaked at number one on the Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart. Regarding Springsteen's version of the song, Cliff commented in 1988, \\"I look at it as a compliment. ... He's an artist in his own right and he's written a lot of good songs, too. It's good when an established artist does your work and does it in his way. I've also done other people's work. I recorded Cat Stevens' 'Wild World', a big hit in Europe, and I did it my way. From a commercial point of view, I didn't gain from ['Trapped']. All the royalties were donated to the cause and I gained in the moral sense that I have done something for the cause.\\" Critical response to Springsteen's \\"Trapped\\" was positive. Ken Tucker of Knight-Ridder Newspapers wrote that the Springsteen recording was \\"easily the most powerful music on We Are the World, and for a reason that seems to have eluded the creators of the album's title song: Springsteen understands that to make a donation (of money, of time, of talent) isn't enough; you have to make a statement as well, to let your audience know where you stand. Springsteen's choice is brilliant. Singing in the words of a black man who is railing eloquently about the political oppression closing in on him, leaving him 'trapped', Springsteen offers an exciting performance of a significant song.\\" Al Walentis of the Reading Eagle wrote that it was one of only two songs on the album that \\"showcase material that ranks with the singers' most potent\\", the other being Tina Turner's interpretation of The Motels' \\"Total Control\\", and said that it \\"starts off tense and edgy then revs up\\" in a manner that resembles Springsteen's \\"Backstreets\\". Eric Thurm of The A.V. Club, writing in 2014, commented, \\"The album's best cut – Bruce Springsteen's live rendition of Jimmy Cliff's 'Trapped' – works because, in contrast to the rest of We Are The World, it's deeply specific. The song's narrator is the one who's 'wearing the same old chains,' rather than a faceless mass – he's channeling one person instead of millions, which is what renders most of the album devoid of personality.\\" Later history In the view of music writer Dave Thompson, the success of Springsteen's \\"Trapped\\" help improve Cliff's visibility, along with the Jamaican's direct involvement in the same year's Artists United Against Apartheid. Cliff re-recorded \\"Trapped\\" for release on his 1989 album Images (which in the United Kingdom was called Save Our Planet Earth) on the label Cliff Sounds and Films. Here it was longer, with a running time of 4:33, and had vocal phrasings and emphases that more closely resembled Springsteen's, albeit still with a reggae beat. It was released as a 7-inch and 12-inch single, the latter of which also contained various remixes for radio and club use. This single did not chart. Cliff performs the songs in his concerts, often sounding fairly close to the Springsteen version in some of his singing, although the music remains definitely his. In November 1989, Springsteen jumped onstage during a Cliff performance at The Stone Pony in Asbury Park, New Jersey and the two performed a long version of \\"Trapped\\" together in a manner that more closely resembled Cliff's original than Springsteen's interpretation. The original recording of \\"Trapped\\" was included on Cliff's 2003 Anthology compilation. A live performance is part of his 2013 release The KCRW Session. Springsteen has continued to perform the song, including during the 1992–93 \\"Other Band\\" Tour, where the replacement of the E Street Band did not alter fan reaction to the number. Writer Daniel Cavicchi has analyzed the audience reaction to his arrangement as the \\"power of the moment\\" in the quiet portions in between when \\"everyone sang angrily, punching a fist in the air to punctuate the lines\\" of the chorus. \\"Trapped\\" has continued to make appearances during the 1999–2000 Reunion Tour and in the various tours of the Reunion Era beyond. \\"Trapped\\" was included as one of the items on the bonus disc of the 2003 compilation The Essential Bruce Springsteen. In 2014, \\"Trapped\\" was named by Rolling Stone magazine as one of the top ten best Bruce Springsteen \\"deep cuts\\", one which many do not realize is not a Springsteen original.

It started after the law intending to allow the 2017 Catalan independence referendum was denounced by the Spanish government under Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy and subsequently suspended by the Constitutional Court until it ruled on the issue. Some international media outlets have described the events as \\"one of the worst political crises in modern Spanish history\\". Puigdemont's government announced that neither central Spanish authorities nor the courts would halt their plans and that it intended to hold the vote anyway, sparking a legal backlash that quickly spread from the Spanish and Catalan governments to Catalan municipalities—as local mayors were urged by the Generalitat to provide logistical support and help for the electoral process to be carried out—as well as to the Constitutional Court, the High Court of Justice of Catalonia and state prosecutors. By 15 September, as pro-Catalan independence parties began their referendum campaigns, the Spanish government had launched an all-out legal offensive to thwart the upcoming vote, including threats of a financial takeover of much of the Catalan budget, police seizing pro-referendum posters, pamphlets and leaflets which had been regarded as illegal and criminal investigations ordered on the over 700 local mayors who had publicly agreed to help stage the referendum. Tensions between the two sides reached a critical point after Spanish police raided the Catalan government headquarters in Barcelona on 20 September, at the start of Operation Anubis, and arrested fourteen senior Catalan officials. This led to protests outside the Catalan economy department which saw Civil Guard officers trapped inside the building for hours and several vehicles vandalized. The referendum was eventually held, albeit without meeting minimum standards for elections and amid low turnout and a police crackdown ended with hundreds injured. Local hospitals reported figures of up to 4 injured people, 2 of them in critical state, one for a gum ball shot and the other one due to a heart attack. Also Spanish Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that up to 431 officers were injured bruised or even bitten. On 10 October, Puigdemont ambiguously declared and suspended independence during a speech in the Parliament of Catalonia, arguing his move was directed at entering talks with Spain. The Spanish government required Puigdemont to clarify whether he had declared independence or not, to which it received no clear answer. A further requirement was met with an implicit threat from the Generalitat that it would lift the suspension on the independence declaration if Spain \\"continued its repression\\", in response to the imprisonment of the leaders of pro- independence Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and Òmnium Cultural, accused of sedition by the National Court because of their involvement in the 20 September events. On 21 October, it was announced by Prime Minister Rajoy that Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution would be invoked, leading to direct rule over Catalonia by the Spanish government once approved by the Senate. On 27 October, the Catalan parliament voted in a secret ballot to unilaterally declare independence from Spain, with some deputies boycotting a vote considered illegal for violating the decisions of the Constitutional Court of Spain, as the lawyers of the Parliament of Catalonia warned. As a result, the government of Spain invoked the Constitution to remove the regional authorities and enforce direct rule the next day, with a regional election being subsequently called for 21 December 2017 to elect a new Parliament of Catalonia. Puigdemont and part of his cabinet fled to Belgium after being ousted, as the Spanish Attorney General pressed for charges of sedition, rebellion and misuse of public funds against them. Background The recent increase in support for Catalan independence has its roots in a Constitutional Court ruling in 2010, which struck down parts of the regional 2006 Statute of Autonomy that granted new powers of self-rule to the region. The ruling came after four years of deliberation concerning a constitutional appeal filed by the conservative People's Party (PP) under Mariano Rajoy—then the country's second-largest party, in opposition to the government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party—and was met with anger and street protests in Catalonia. Shortly afterward the PP took power in Spain, and after a massive independence demonstration took place in Barcelona on 11 September 2012—Catalonia's National Day—the Catalan government under Artur Mas called a snap regional election and set out to initiate Catalonia's process towards independence. After a pro-independence coalition formed by the Junts pel Sí alliance and the Popular Unity Candidacy won a slim majority in the Parliament in the 2015 regional election, Carles Puigdemont replaced Mas as President of the Generalitat. Puigdemont promised to organise a binding independence referendum based on results from a multi-question, non-binding vote in 2014, when about 80% of those who voted were believed to have backed independence for the region, and up to 91.8% supported Catalonia becoming a state—albeit on an estimated turnout around or below 40%. The Catalan government invoked the right of people to self-determination and Catalonia's political, economical and cultural background to back up its proposal for a referendum on Catalan independence. The Government of Spain, now with Mariano Rajoy as Prime Minister, opposed such a vote, arguing that any referendum on Catalan independence would go against the country's 1978 Constitution, as it made no provision for a vote on self-determination. On 9 June 2017, Puigdemont announced that the planned independence referendum would be held on 1 October the same year. The Catalan government criticised the attitude of the Spanish government in refusing to negotiate a referendum and accused it of behaving undemocratically. Start of crisis Referendum suspended Pro- independence supporters during a rally on 11 September 2017 On 6 September 2017, the ruling Junts pel Sí (JxSí) coalition and its parliamentary partner, the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), passed the Law on the Referendum on Self- determination of Catalonia in the Parliament of Catalonia that was to provide the legal framework for the intended independence referendum scheduled for 1 October. The way in which the law had been pushed through Parliament became an issue of controversy. Catalan opposition parties accused JxSí and CUP of fast- tracking the law through parliament, not allowing them to appeal the law before being put up to vote. Some months later the Spanish Constitutional Court endorsed the reform of the Parliament regulation that allowed passing the law. Shortly after the parliamentary vote, in which most of the opposition MPs walked out from the chamber without voting on the bill, the Catalan regional government signed the decree calling the referendum. The People's Party-led Spanish government under Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced that it would appeal the bill to the Constitutional Court, which agreed to hear all four of its unconstitutionality appeals and subsequently suspended the law and the referendum until it could rule upon the matter. Despite the referendum suspension, the Catalan government announced it would proceed with the vote anyway. This prompted Attorney General José Manuel Maza to ask security forces to investigate possible preparations from the Catalan government to hold the vote, as well as announcing he would present criminal charges against members of both the regional parliament and government for voting and signing off the referendum. The national government proceeded to deploy a series of legal measures intended to nullify the referendum, while also warning local councils in Catalonia to either impede or paralyse efforts to carry out the vote. Previously, local mayors had been given 48 hours by the regional government to confirm the availability of polling stations for 1 October. On 7 September and under a similar procedure as the day previously, pro-independence lawmakers in the Parliament of Catalonia passed the legal framework that was to prevail the Spanish one should a majority vote for the 'Yes' to independence choice. Within the next two days, nearly 74% of Catalan municipalities—comprising about 43% of the Catalan population—had agreed to provide the necessary polling stations for the referendum, whereas many of the most-populated urban areas—representing 24% of Catalan inhabitants—had voiced their opposition to the vote. The largest city and capital of Catalonia, Barcelona—accounting for about 20% of the region's population—was caught in the middle, with its local mayor, Ada Colau, refusing to make a statement whether the municipality would provide logistic support to the referendum or not while rejecting putting public servants at risk; she, however, voiced her support for the people's right to vote in a fair and legal referendum. Concurrently, President of Catalonia Carles Puigdemont, Vice-President Oriol Junqueras, the entire Catalan government as well as parliamentary officials allowing the referendum law to be put to vote in Parliament—including Parliament Speaker Carme Forcadell—faced charges of disobedience, misusing public funds and making deliberately unlawful decisions as elected officials as the High Court of Justice of Catalonia agreed to hear the criminal complaints filled by state prosecutors. Judicial and police action On 8 September the Attorney General of Catalonia, José María Romero de Tejada, presented two complaints to the High Court of Justice of Catalonia (TSJC) against him Government and the Bureau of Parliament for crimes of disobedience, prevarication and misappropriation of public funds, as announced the day before the Attorney General José Manuel Maza. These complaints included the guarantee request for the members of the Government as well as a request for a notification to all mayors of Catalonia to prevent any \\"personal or material resource, including local\\" resources being provided for the celebration of referendum. The court was also asked to notify the Catalan media managers of the prohibition of inserting institutional advertising or propaganda of the referendum. These complaints were admitted by the TSJC on 14 September without accepting the request for a deposit for the members of the Government. A decision on 13 September from Spain's public prosecutors to order a criminal probe of all local mayors who had publicly announced they would help stage the independence referendum—totalling over 700—came the day after the Constitutional Court had accepted the Spanish government's request to suspend the second of the two laws that had been approved by the secessionist majority in the Catalan parliament the previous week. The probe meant that prosecutors could choose to present criminal charges—or even arrest, if failing to answer the summons—local mayors who disobeyed the Constitutional Court's ruling. As part of a series of moves to block the Catalan referendum, prosecutors had also instructed police officials to seize ballot boxes, election flyers and other items that could be of use in the illegal vote, whereas the Constitutional Court had instructed regional government officials to show how they were preventing the vote from going ahead within a 48-hour deadline. In response, the Catalan government sent a letter to Treasury Minister Cristóbal Montoro announcing that it would stop sending weekly financial accounts to Spain's central government, a previously-established obligation that was meant to verify whether the region was using public money for the promotion of its independence drive as well as a requirement for the region's access to a funding programme to autonomous communities established in 2012. The Spanish government then proceeded to take direct control of most of Catalonia's invoice payments. In a search on 19 September, Spanish police seized significant election material which had been in store by referendum organizers at the offices of a private delivery company in Terrassa. These included voting cards contained in envelopes with the Catalan government's logo. The next day, the Civil Guard raided Generalitat offices and arrested fourteen senior officials from the Catalan government—most notably, these included , deputy to regional Vice-President Oriol Junqueras. This came after mayors from towns supporting the referendum were questioned in court by state prosecutors. Regional premier Carles Puigdemont condemned the actions as \\"anti-democratic and totalitarian\\", accusing the Spanish government of 'de facto' imposing a state of emergency and of suspending Catalonia's autonomy after it took effective control over Catalan finances. Public protests occurred in Barcelona after news of the arrests emerged, with left-wing political party Podemos and Barcelona mayor Ada Colau joining the growing criticism of Mariano Rajoy's government crackdown on public servants, dubbing it as an \\"authoritarian regression\\". The previous day, the Congress of Deputies had voted down a motion from Ciudadanos to support the Spanish government's response to the referendum, which was rejected by 166 votes to 158. Rajoy defended his government's actions in that \\"What we're seeing in Catalonia is an attempt to eliminate the constitution and the autonomous statute of Catalonia... Logically, the state has to react. There is no democratic state in the world that would accept what these people are trying to do. They've been warned and they know the referendum can't take place\\". Rajoy also called for the Catalonia government to give up its \\"escalation of radicalism and disobedience\\", calling for them to \\"Go back to the law and democracy\\" and dubbing the referendum a \\"chimera\\", as tens of thousands gathered in the streets of Barcelona and other Catalan cities to protest police actions. The Spanish government did not rule out invoking Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, which would allow the central government to adopt \\"the necessary measures to compel regional authorities to obey the law\\"—in practice, allowing for the autonomy's effective suspension and direct rule of the region. On 21 September, the Catalan government acknowledged that the raid and arrests in the previous day severely hampered the referendum's logistics by preventing any alternative election data centre to be established in time for the vote to take place. Nonetheless, Catalan Vice-President Junqueras called for people to turn out and mobilise on 1 October, turning the social response into a \\"censure motion to Rajoy\\", stating that \\"If there is any possibility of change in Spain, democracy must triumph in Catalonia\\". As street protests continued throughout Catalonia, additional police reinforcements were sent by the Spanish government to block any moves to hold the referendum on 1 October. Spanish prosecutors formally accused some protesters in Barcelona of sedition, after several Civil Guard patrol cars had been vandalised on Wednesday night. By 23 September, the Spanish government announced that the Mossos d'Esquadra—the regional police force—were to be subordinated to a single command dependent of the Spanish government and that the Interior Ministry would assume co-ordination over all security forces in Catalonia. The previous day, several hundred students had announced a permanent occupation of the historic building of the University of Barcelona, protesting the state's actions. Development Referendum and subsequent events Demonstration in Barcelona during the general strike held in Catalonia on 3 October 2017. Despite the suspension, the Catalan referendum was held on 1 October 2017, as scheduled by the Generalitat. Over 12,000 officers from the National Police Corps and the Civil Guard were deployed throughout Catalonia in an effort to close off polling stations and seize all election material to prevent the vote from taking place. The Spanish government was forced to call off police raids after clashes with protesters resulted in two people seriously injured, one for a gum ball shot against the eye and the other one due to a heart attack. 893 civilians and 111 agents of the Nacional Police and the Civil Guard were reported to have been injured. According to some Spanish media these previously reported figures may have been exaggerated. The Guardian's columnist, Peter Preston, said the number of injured \\"hadn't been independently checked\\" while he still described the police action as \\"violent and frightening\\". However, the Official College of Doctors of Barcelona (Col·legi de Metges de Barcelona) stated that \\"professionalism and independence of doctors can not be questioned because they act under a deontological code to attend and diagnose patients\\". The judge who is currently investigating the accusations of police violence had already identified 218 people injured on 10 October, 20 of whom were police officers. The events of 1 October sparked a public outcry in Catalonia, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets to protest Spanish police violence. Demonstration in Manresa on 3 October 2017. On 3 October 2017, as huge protest rallies and a general strike took place in Catalonia, King Felipe VI delivered an unusually strongly worded televised address in which he condemned the referendum organizers for acting \\"outside the law\\", accusing them of \\"unacceptable disloyalty\\" and of \\"eroding the harmony and co-existence within Catalan society itself\\". He also warned the referendum could put the economy of the entire north-east region of Spain at risk. Reactions to the King's speech were mixed. Party officials from the PP and Ciudadanos praised the King's \\"commitment to legality\\", whereas leaders from Unidos Podemos and Catalunya en Comú criticised it as \\"unworthy and irresponsible\\", paving the way for a harsh intervention in Catalan autonomy. PSOE's leaders expressed support for the King's words in public, but were reported to be privately dissatisfied that the King had not made any call to encourage understanding or dialogue between the Spanish and Catalan governments. On 5 October the Constitutional Court of Spain suspended a future parliamentary session (scheduled for 9 October) that was planned in order to push for a Declaration of Independence. On 5 October, Banco Sabadell, the second-largest bank based in Catalonia, announced its decision to move its legal headquarters out of the region amid economic uncertainty over the future of Catalonia's political situation ahead of a projected unilateral declaration of independence the ensuing week, which had seen sharp falls in the group's share prices the previous day and rating agencies downgrading the region. Concurrently, CaixaBank, the biggest bank in the region and the third largest in Spain, also announced it was considering redomiciling outside Catalonia. This sparked a massive business exit in the ensuing hours, with companies such as Abertis, Gas Natural, Grifols, Fersa Energias Renovables, Agbar, Freixenet, Codorníu, Idilia Foods, San Miguel Beer and Planeta Group also announcing or considering their intention to move their HQs out of Catalonia. The Spanish government announced on Friday 6 October that it would issue a decree allowing companies based in Catalonia to move out of the region without holding a shareholders' meeting. On 11 October, Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art announced that it was repatriating its collection of Art & Language works on loan at Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art (MACBA) since 2010. Within two weeks, more than 1,000 business and firms would move out of Catalonia. Simultaneously, far-right groups increasingly took to the streets throughout Spain in a quest to defend Spanish unity, with some gatherings leading to violent scuffles in Barcelona and Valencia. The Mossos d'Esquadra were put under investigation for disobedience, accused of not complying with a command from the High Court of Justice of Catalonia to prevent the referendum and with their passivity allowing polling stations to open. In an ambiguous speech during a parliamentary session in the Parliament of Catalonia on 10 October, Puigdemont declared that \\"Catalonia had earned the right to be an independent state\\" and that he defended \\"the mandate of the people of Catalonia to become an independent republic\\". However, he immediately announced that parliament would suspend a formal declaration of independence in order to pursue dialogue with the Spanish government. Puigdemont and other pro-independence deputies then signed a symbolic declaration of independence with no legal effect. Puigdemont's move came after pressure resulting from the business exit on the previous days as well as pleas from Barcelona's mayor Ada Colau and European Council President Donald Tusk urging him to step back from declaring independence. This was met with disappointment from thousands of pro- independence supporters who had gathered nearby to watch the session on giant screens, as well as criticism from the CUP, who voiced their discontent at Puigdemont's decision not to proclaim a Catalan republic right away and did not rule out abandoning the Parliament until the signed declaration of independence was effective. On 17 October, the National Court ordered Jordi Sànchez and Jordi Cuixart—leaders of pro-independence groups Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and Òmnium Cultural—to be preventively put into jail without bail pending an investigation into alleged sedition for having played central roles in orchestrating massive protests aimed at hindering Civil Guard activity. They were accused of leading the protest of tens of thousands of people that surrounded the Catalan economy department offices on 20–21 September 2017 heeding a call made by Òmnium Cultural and ANC, during which three vehicles of the Civil Guard were vandalised and their occupants forced to flee into the Economy Department building, a court clerk remained trapped until midnight inside the building and had to flee by the roof, while several agents were trapped throughout the night as demonstrators shouted outside \\"You won't get out!\\". The Civil Guard agents cornered into the building made 6 calls for help to the autonomous police force of Catalonia Mossos d'Esquadra which were ignored, the first of them performed at 9:14 am with the subject: \\"Urgent - Request for support to Mossos\\". According to the judge the actions of Sànchez and Cruixat are into the scope of sedition, a felony regulated by the article 544 and subsequents of the Spanish Criminal Code: Pro-independence politicians and organizations, including Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, have referred to Cuixart and Sànchez as political prisoners. The Spanish Justice Minister Rafael Catalá argued that they were not \\"political prisoners\\" but \\"imprisoned politicians\\". An article published in El País argued that according to the criteria established by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) Sànchez and Cuixart could not be considered \\"political prisoners\\". Amnesty International issued an official statement considering the charge of sedition and the preventive imprisonment as \\"excessive\\" and called for their immediate release, but several days later made it clear that it did not consider them \\"political prisoners\\". Some Catalan media, such as La Vanguardia, reported that footage from the incident showed Cuixart and Sànchez trying to call off the protests, contradicting that part of the judicial order imprisoning them which said that they had not tried \\"to call off the demonstration\\". Independence declaration and direct rule On 11 October, after an extraordinary cabinet meeting intended to address the events on the previous day, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced he was formally requiring the Catalan government to confirm whether it had declared independence before 16 October at 10am, with a further 3-day deadline until 19 October to revoke all deemed illegal acts if an affirmative answer—or no answer at all—was obtained. This requirement was a formal requisite needed to trigger article 155 of the Spanish Constitution, a so-called \\"nuclear option\\" that would allow the Spanish government to suspend Catalonia's political autonomy and impose direct rule from Madrid. Pressure mounted within the pro-independence coalition as the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) demanded an unambiguous affirmation of Catalan independence, threatening to withdraw its parliamentary support from Puigdemont's government if he rescinded his independence claim. In his formal response to Rajoy's requirement hurrying the initial five-day deadline, Puigdemont failed to clarify whether independence had been declared and instead called for negotiations over the following two months. The Spanish government replied that this was not a valid response to its requirement and doubted that Puigdemont's offer for dialogue was sincere due to his lack of \\"clarity\\". The refusal from the Catalan government to either confirm or deny independence triggered a second deadline for them to backtrack before direct rule was imposed. The Spanish government subsequently offered to abort the incoming move to suspend self-rule if the Catalan government called for a regional election, but this was ruled out by the latter. On 19 October, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy confirmed that the Spanish government would trigger Article 155 and move to suspend Catalonia's autonomy after a cabinet meeting scheduled for 21 October, following a letter from Puigdemont in which he said that the independence declaration remained suspended but that the Catalan parliament could choose to vote on it if Spain continued its \\"repression\\". Subsequently, Rajoy announced the Spanish government would take direct control over the Generalitat of Catalonia, proceeding to remove Puigdemont and the entire Catalan government from their offices and call a regional election within six months, pending Senate approval. Special Senate Commission on the Invocation of Article 155 of the Spanish Constitution (presidency). On 26 October, one day ahead of the scheduled enforcement of Article 155 by the Spanish Senate, it was announced that Puigdemont had chosen to dissolve the Parliament of Catalonia within the coming hours and call for an emergency snap election on or around 20 December in order to prevent direct rule from Madrid. This move sparked an outcry within pro-independence ranks, as they wished to hold a vote for a unilateral declaration of independence in response to the Spanish government's move to trigger Article 155. In the end Puigdemont chose not to dissolve Parliament, allegedly because of the Spanish government's refusal to call off the Article 155 procedure even though an election was called by Puigdemont. A debate over a possible declaration of independence then went ahead as planned in the Parliament of Catalonia later that day and into the next morning, simultaneous to the Spanish Senate debating the enforcement of Article 155. At the end of the debate, the Catalan parliament voted for a unilateral declaration of independence, by secret ballot, which was backed 70–10, with two MPs casting a blank ballot, with all MPs from Citizens, the Socialists' Party of Catalonia and the People's Party boycotting the vote because of its illegality for violating the decisions of the Constitutional Court of Spain, as the lawyers of the Parliament of Catalonia warned. Demonstration under the slogan \\"Freedom for Political Prisoners, We are a Republic\\" on 11 November 2017 Subsequently, on 28 October, Mariano Rajoy dismissed the Executive Council of Catalonia, dissolved the Parliament of Catalonia and called a snap regional election for 21 December 2017, after obtaining the Senate endorsement to the invoking of Article 155, and handed coordination over Generalitat of Catalonia functions to Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Sáenz de Santamaría. On 30 October, as Spanish Attorney General José Manuel Maza called for charges of rebellion, sedition and embezzlement against Puigdemont and other Catalan leaders, it transpired that the ousted President and five of his ministers had fled to Belgium. Puigdemont, however, declared that he was not in Belgium \\"to seek asylum\\" and that he would respect the 21 December election, but also noting that he would not return home until \\"a fair judicial process was guaranteed\\" in Spain. Concurrently, lack of civil unrest and work resuming as normal throughout Catalonia showed direct rule from Madrid taking hold, with Spanish authorities reasserting administrative control over Catalan territory with little resistance. On 31 October, the independence declaration was suspended by the Constitutional Court of Spain. Spain's National Court () summoned Puigdemont and 13 other members of his dismissed government to appear on 2 November to respond to the criminal charges pressed against them. It was later ordered by the judge that eight members of the deposed Catalan government—including Puigdemont's deputy and ERC leader, Oriol Junqueras—be remanded in custody without bail after testifying for posing a flight risk, with a ninth—Santi Vila—being granted a €50,000 bail. Spanish prosecutors sought a European Arrest Warrant for Puigdemont and four other members who had remained in Belgium and refused to attend the hearing. The EAW demanding Puigdemont and his allies' arrest was officially issued to Belgium the next day, on 3 November, which Belgium said they would \\"study\\" before making any decisions. The detention of the former Generalitat members led to increased protests in Catalonia, with thousands calling for \\"freedom\\" for whom they viewed as \\"political prisoners\\". Puigdemont declared from an undisclosed location in Belgium that he regarded the detentions as \\"an act that breaks with the basic principles of democracy\\". In contrast, a separate case against other Catalan lawmakers was adjourned by the Supreme Court () after all six of them, including Catalan parliament speaker Carme Forcadell, showed up to the summons. Puigdemont and the four other cabinet members turned themselves in to Belgian authorities on 5 November, awaiting a decision by the federal prosecutor on whether to hand them over to Spain or decline the warrant. They were released by the judge on the same day on conditions, such as they would not be able to leave the country without prior consent and would have to provide details to the police about their accommodation. On 5 December, six jailed members of the deposed government were freed on bail, while four others, including Oriol Junqueras, were required to remain imprisoned. The next day, Spain withdrew the EAW against Puigdemont just over a month after issuing it to Belgian authorities. On 18 November, while in office, Attorney General José Manuel Maza suddenly died and was succeeded ad interim by Luis NavajasLuis Navajas, teniente fiscal del Supremo, releva a Maza hasta que el Gobierno designe un sucesor until the appointment on 11 December of Julián Sánchez Melgar. Regional election and investiture Lawyers Jessica Jones, Ben Emmerson and Rachel Lindon take case of Catalonia's jailed politicians to the United Nations, February 2018 The 21 December regional election called by Rajoy resulted in pro-independence parties retaining a reduced majority with 70 seats overall, with Puigdemont's coalition, Together for Catalonia, performing above expectations. With 36 seats, the main anti-independence party, Citizens, emerged as the largest in the Parliament, whereas Rajoy's People's Party was severely mauled after being reduced to 4.2% of the share and 4 out of 135 seats. Inés Arrimadas, Citizens' leader in the region, announced she would not try to form a government on her own, instead waiting and see how negotiations between pro-independence parties evolved, due to them commanding a majority against her hypothetical candidacy. As the candidate of the most-voted party within the pro-independence bloc, Puigdemont intended to be re-elected as President, but this was hampered by the fact he risked being arrested by Spanish authorities upon returning from Brussels. Further, pro- independence parties could only command 62 seats—six short of a majority—as in practice eight of their elected deputies were either in Brussels with Puigdemont or in preventive detention. After the Catalan parliament elected Roger Torrent as new speaker, Puigdemont was proposed as candidate for re- election as President of the Generalitat. However, facing arrest on possible charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds, the Catalan parliament delayed Puigdemont's investiture after Constitutional Court ruled that he could not assume the presidency from abroad. With other pro- independence leaders assuring the pro-independence movement should outlive Puigdemont in order to end the political deadlock, the former Catalan president announced on 1 March he would step his claim aside in order to allow detained activist Jordi Sànchez, from his Together for Catalonia alliance, to become President instead. However, as Spain's Supreme Court did not allow Sànchez to be freed from jail to attend his investiture ceremony, Sànchez ended up giving up his candidacy on 21 March in favour of former Catalan government spokesman Jordi Turull, who was also under investigation for his role in the referendum. Protest march in Barcelona in support of Carles Puigdemont on 15 April 2018 Turull was defeated in the first ballot of a hastily convened investiture session held on 22 March, with only his Together for Catalonia alliance and ERC voting for him and the Popular Unity Candidacy abstaining, resulting in a 64–65 defeat. The next day and less than 24 hours before he was due to attend the second ballot, the Supreme Court announced that thirteen senior Catalan leaders—including Turull—would be charged with rebellion over their roles in the 2017 unilateral referendum and subsequent declaration of independence. Llarena sent five of them, including Turull and Carme Forcadell, previous Catalan Parliament speaker, to preventive jail; being the others already in preventive jail or exile. In anticipation of this ruling and in order to avoid appearing in court, Marta Rovira—ERC's general secretary and deputy leader to jailed Oriol Junqueras—fled the country to Switzerland in self-exile. As a result, the Parliament speaker Roger Torrent cancelled Turull's second investiture ballot. Thousands took the streets of dozens of Catalan cities to show discomfort with the decision of the court. The European Arrest Warrant against Puigdemont was reactivated just as he was in a visit to Finland, but he had already left the country for Belgium before Finnish authorities received it. On his way to Belgium on 25 March he was caught and detained in Germany while crossing the border from Denmark. On 4 April he was released on bail after the state court in Schleswig rejected extraditing him for rebellion, though he may still be extradited on corruption charges. Ultimately, though, Spain dropped its European arrest warrant, ending the extradition attempt. Puigdemont was once again free to travel, and chose to return to Belgium. Alleged international interference Russian President Vladimir Putin condemned Catalonia's independence referendum as \\"illegal\\".\\"'Illegal' Putin condemns Catalonia referendum and will continue to treat Spain as one\\". Express.co.uk. 28 September 2017. However, an analysis by the George Washington University School of Media and Public Affairs of over five million social media messages found that some Russian media and accounts on social networks related to Venezuela allegedly collaborated on disseminating negative propaganda against the Spanish government days before and after the referendum. Russia's RT and Sputnik would use Venezuelan social bots that would typically promote the Bolivarian government in Venezuela to criticize the Spanish government and police violence against citizens in Catalonia. Social bots, anonymous accounts and official state media accounts shared 97% of the anti-Spain messages while only 3% of the messages were shared by real social media members. Leaders of the George Washington University study displayed concern about the findings, stating that \\"democratic systems have the obligation to investigate these signs and implement systematic methods of monitoring and responding to alleged disruptions of foreign agents\\" and that it appeared the authors of the propaganda are the same as the ones who allegedly interfered in the 2016 United States presidential election and Brexit. The Spanish Ministry of Defence and the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation later said it had confirmed that Russian actors and Venezuela had attempted to destabilize the nation and Europe by means of propaganda, though it would not confirm if the Russian government was directly involved and warned that similar misinformation actions may take place in future elections. NATO officials also made comments stating that Russia has been attempting to undermine Western governments through disinformation campaigns. Members of Catalonia's separatist groups have denied allegations of foreign interference. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in response: \\"Probably they are arranging this kind of scandalous, sensational hysteria in order to distract the attention of their electorate from their inability to resolve their problems at home.\\"\\"Russia Calls Spain's Accusations It May Have Meddled In Catalonia Vote 'Hysteria'\\". Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. 16 November 2017. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on 15 November: \\"The Spanish authorities, NATO, and the newspapers did not bring up a single worthwhile argument to back these claims. We consider these claims to be groundless, and more likely a deliberate or inadvertent continuation of the same hysteria that is now happening in the United States and a number of other countries.\\" References 2017 in Catalonia 2017 in politics 2017 protests 2017 beginnings 2018 in Catalonia 2018 in politics Spanish constitutional crisis Catalan independence movement Constitutional crises Politics of Catalonia Politics of Spain Protests in Spain September 2017 events in Spain October 2017 events in Spain November 2017 events in Spain December 2017 events in Spain January 2018 events in Spain ","title":"2017–2018 Spanish constitutional crisis"},{"id":"55185384","text":"María Elena Avila (born April 18, 1953) is a Mexican-born American entrepreneur, philanthropist and civic leader in California.

Plot Jake Armstrong, Nathan Park, and Ricardo Perez were three ordinary teenagers living in the technological hub Charter City until they were doused in a substance known as \\"Flexarium\\" during an accident. Their newfound superpowers garnered the attention of Jonathan Rook, the CEO of Rook Unlimited and benefactor to Charter City himself. Rook offers them their freedom from the authorities over the accident in exchange for enlisting the trio as Charter City's superhero team known as the Flex Fighters. Agreeing on the terms that Rook and everyone else won't know their real identities, Jake becomes Stretch, Nathan becomes Wingspan, and Ricardo becomes Omni-Mass. In their first days as superheroes, the Flex Fighters receive hard training from Malcolm Kane (Rook's second-in- command) while fighting against numerous villains including Stretch Monster, who benefices many of them, and also shared a past with Dr. Racine Cleo / Dr. C (Rook's former mentor) and her ninja companion Riya Dashti / Blindstrike (Stretch's classmate and love interest). In their last mission, the Flex Fighters discover in horror that Jonathan Rook and Stretch Monster are the same person and therefore, he has been their enemy the whole time. Rook intends to use Dr. C's \\"HyperFlexarium\\" formula to create an army of monsters and conquer the world. With the help of Dr. C and Blindstrike, the Flex Fighters escaped from Rook, but he then frames them in public for the rampage he caused over the city.

Production Stretch Armstrong was originally released in 1976 by Kenner Products. In 1987, Kenner was acquired by Tonka, which was later acquired together in 1991 by Hasbro. All of rights to Kenner's products were transferred to Hasbro in 2000, when the latter shut down Kenner's office. There have been several attempts to adapt the property into a television series or film, with the latter, as a live-action film, have failed attempts by Disney (in 1994), Universal (in 2008) and Relativity Media (in 2012). Originally announced and developed as a live-action series starring a teenage version of the 1970s superhero, the idea was eventually retooled as an animated series targeted to children before bringing in Cook as producer, based on his work with The Spectacular Spider- Man TV series. Shortly thereafter, Burke and Wyatt were hired to produce and write. The series was designed to have episodic stories that also serialize into a larger plot over the course of the first season's 26 episodes. The first footage from the series was shown at HasCon on September 10, 2017. The series is animated by Digital eMation in South Korea.

This parade is held annually in Minsk on July 3 and is one of the most frequently held military parades in Eastern Europe, as well as the former Soviet Union. It is held every year except years that celebrate Victory Day (9 May), to which Victory Day Parades are held.  Summary  The celebrations begin as the parade commander (usually the Deputy Defense Minister) arrives to take command of the parade formations from a commander of the first company participating in the parade. At 10am, the President of Belarus arrives on Victors Avenue and gets on the central grandstand to await the start of the parade. The parade commander gives the order to begin the review of the Minsk Garrison by the Defence Minister of Belarus, the parade presenting arms at this juncture. The Deputy Defense Minister of Belarus then reports to the Defense Minister on the status of the parade. Following the report, to the tune of the Central Band of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus playing inspection tunes, both the parade commander and the Defense Minister then review the parade mounted in their vehicles and the Minister, once the vehicles stop upon each company of troops assembled, then congratulates them on the holiday. After this, the defense minister's car heads to the central tribune to the tune of Motherland My Dear (Радзіма мая дарагая) so that the minister can report to the president on the readiness of the parade once his limouine stops in front of the presidential grandstand, following which he disembarks and arrives there, following which the parade is ordered at ease. The president then delivers an address to the nation and congratulates the citizens on the holiday. At the end of the speech, My Belarusy is played by the Central Band of the Armed Forces, with a 21-gun salute being fired in the background. The commander of the parade then gives the order for the Minsk Garrison to commence the parade while at the same time the linemen take their places to mark the distance of the troops marching past. The order now concluded, the parade then marches off in quick time with the drummers of the Corps of Drums of the Minsk Suvorov Military School setting the pace. As the Corps' bandmaster orders the halt, the massed bands start playing a military march (usually Letter from the 45th by Igor Luchenko as the first song) as he salutes while the drummers swing on the eyes right position. The drummers are just the first of the large ground column of an estimated 2,900 service personnel that marches past the presidential grandstand.

Following an internship and residency at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), he became a clinical associate at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Disease (NIAMS) where, under the guidance of Ed Rall, he studied the effects of androgens on thyroid function, thyroxine metabolism, and thyroxine-binding protein. In 1957, he began a two-year clinical research fellowship with Sir Edward Pochin at the University College Hospital Medical School, London, pioneering in the use of radioactive iodine for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Following his time in London, he returned to HMS and the MGH and worked his way up the ranks, becoming chief of the endocrine unit at the MGH in 1964, assistant chief of medical services at the MGH in 1967, associate professor of medicine at HMS and physician at the MGH in 1970, and associate chairman of medicine in 1971.

Dr. Daniel Federman, Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami His most recent topics reflectively expressed his broad and humane interests: “Protecting Research Participants”, “The physician’s responsibility toward hopelessly ill patients”, “The endocrine patient”, and “The education of medical students: sounds, alarms, and excursions”.  Personal life  While Federman was a medical student doing a three-month clerkship in medicine, he met his wife Elizabeth (Betty) Buckley, who was head nurse - the youngest head nurse ever - at Massachusetts General Hospital. MGH Trustees needed to vote to allow Betty to work in that role, since she was only 22 at the time. He later commented that he could not learn everything she had to teach him in her role there. As Dean for Medical Education of Harvard Medical School, he handed his daughter her diploma at her HMS graduation. He was an avid sailor who also enjoyed a wide array of musical styles - he loved opera and was an accomplished square dance caller. He was proud of narrating Peter and the Wolf for The Longwood Symphony Orchestra, the volunteer non-profit orchestra based in Boston, Massachusetts and composed of medical professionals. He often taught (a) think out loud, (b) stick to the basics, and (c) be kind as key 'fundamentals' in medical education. His wife Betty passed on November 14, 2008.Legacy.com obituary for Elizabeth (Betty) Federman, nee Buckley, published in The New York Times on November 19, 2008 She had been born in Nashua, NH, the daughter of Charles and Mary Buckley and had a brother Charles Buckley.

Life  Park Ra Yeon was born in Boseong, South Korea in 1951. She studied Korean literature at Korea National Open University and received her master’s and doctoral degrees at the University of Suwon and Wonkwang University, respectively. She made her literary debut when her poem “Seoure saneun pyeongganggongju” (서울에 사는 평강공주 Princess Pyeonggang Living in Seoul) won the Dong-a Ilbo New Writer's Contest in 1990. Her first poetry collection of the same name, published in 1991, was received well by critics and readers for the compassion and subtlety in her writing. Park went on to publish Seojeongui chu (서정의 추 The Pendulum of Lyricism) in 1993, Saengbam kkajuneun saram (생밤 까주는 사람 Someone Who Peels Raw Chestnuts For Me) in 1993, Chumchuneun namja siseuneun yeoja (춤추는 남자 시쓰는 여자 He Dances, She Writes Poetry) in 1995, Neoege sedeureo saneun dongan (너에게 세들어 사는 동안 While I Am Your Tenant) in 1996, Gongjungsogeui nae jeongwon (공중 속의 내 정원 My Garden in the Air) in 2000, Uju doragasyeotda (우주 돌아가셨다 The Universe Has Passed Away) in 2006, Bicheui saseoham (빛의 사서함 Postbox of Light) in 2009, and Norangnabiro beonjineun ohu (노랑나비로 번지는 오후 The Afternoon Seeping into a Yellow Butterfly) in 2012. She won the 3rd Yun Dongju Literature Award in 2008 and 5th Hyesan Park Dujin Literary Award in 2010.  Writing  Recurring themes in Park Ra Yeon’s poetry include poverty, loneliness, sadness, pain, and parting. The tone of her poems, however, remains bright, hopeful, and compassionate. Literary critic Oh Saeng-geun writes: “Her poetry is founded on a rich supply of tears and sadness, but far from being tragic or pathetic, it provides fertile ground for a beautiful and healthy vitality.” In Park’s poetry, pain always leads to hope, and her personas find new love in spite of their scars. Her poems do not exaggerate emotions or thoughts, using simple and natural language. They show a positive attitude toward life and the world based on the faith that there is a divine power. They also contain an almost maternal instinct to give back life to the injured and the dead. On her 2012 poetry collection Norangnabiro beonjineun ohu (노랑나비로 번지는 오후 The Afternoon Seeping into a Yellow Butterfly), poet Shin Kyeong-nim observes that “Park’s work combines the familiar sensibilities of traditional Korean lyric poetry with the Modernist thirst for something new.”  Works  Poetry Collections 1\\\\. 『서울에 사는 평강공주』(문학과지성사, 1991) Princess Pyeonggang Living in Seoul.

Early life Douw was born on March 23, 1720 in Albany, New York. He was the only surviving son of nine children born to Petrus Douw (1692–1775), of an old Dutch family, and Anna (née Van Rensselaer) Douw (1696–1756). His siblings included Magdalena Douw (1718–1796), who married Harmen Gansevoort (1712–1801), Maria Douw (1725–1759), who married Johannes Gansevoort, and Rachel Douw (1736–1806). His maternal grandparents were Hendrick van Rensselaer (1667–1740), director of Fort Crailo, the Eastern patent of the Rensselaerswyck manor, and Catharina Van Brugh, herself the daughter of merchant Johannes Pieterse Van Brugh (1624–1697) and sister of Pieter Van Brugh (1666–1740), mayor of Albany from 1699 to 1700 and again from 1721 to 1723. Through his sister Maria, he was uncle to Brig. Gen. Peter Gansevoort (1749–1812) and State Senator and Assemblymen Leonard Gansevoort (1751–1810). Career He worked as a skipper on the Hudson River but eventually returned to Albany to run the family store. During the Seven Years' War, or the French and Indian War as it was known in the colonies, which took place from 1754 to 1763, he was a Captain of the Colonial Militia and the first Judge of Albany County Court, serving from 1757 to 1775. From 1750 to 1760, he was City Recorder (Deputy Mayor) of Albany. In 1760, Douw was appointed as mayor of Albany, New York, serving from 1761 to 1770, following Sybrant Gozen Van Schaick. He was succeeded by Abraham Cuyler. From 1761 until the 1780s, he was a member of the Colonial General Assembly of New York. In 1774, and again in 1775, he served as Commissioner of Indian Affairs in for the Province of New York. During the first New York Provincial Congress, which was convened in New York City on May 22, 1775, Douw served as vice-president with Peter Van Brugh Livingston as president. During the American Revolution, he was a member of the Albany Committee of Correspondence. Following the establishment of New York State, Douw served in the new government as a member of the New York State Senate, beginning on July 1, 1785 serving in the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, 15th, and 16th New York State Legislatures. He retired from the Senate on June 30, 1793 after representing one of five seats for the Western District which consisted of Albany, Montgomery, Herkimer, Ontario, Otsego, Saratoga and Tioga counties. Following Virginia's Ratifying Convention in June 1788, where they became the tenth state to ratify the United States Constitution, New York held their Convention held in Poughkeepsie, New York in July 1788 presided by Gov. George Clinton. Despite Douw's vote against ratification, New York became the eleventh state to ratify on July 26, 1788. By 1790, his household owned 14 slaves.

Peter Robert Livingston (1737–1794) and granddaughter of Robert Livingston, 3rd Lord of Livingston Manor, in 1795, and lastly to Catherine Douw Gansevoort (1782–1848), daughter of Leonard Gansevoort, Jr. and Maria Van Rensselaer (1760–1841), in 1811. * Maria Douw (1760–1818), who married her cousin, John De Peyster Ten Eyck (1756–1798), the son of Tobias Coenraedt Ten Eyck, in 1782. He was a lifelong friend of General Philip Schuyler, and after his death it was said of him that he was \\"a true patriot; in civil and domestic relations, he was considered a pattern, and no man in Albany died more regretted.\\" He was described as: > He was tall and dignified, standing six feet two inches, as straight as an > arrow; said by some to be handsome.

History Groginet began his career as a (French buccaneer) in 1683, sailing a 70-man, 6-gun ship named St. Joseph (or St. Francis) alongside fellow Frenchman L’Escayer. In March 1685 they and other Frenchmen joined forced with English buccaneers Francis Townley, Edward Davis, Charles Swan, and Peter Harris. With the addition of troops from Mathurin Desmarestz and Pierre le Picard the French contingent had grown so large that the English gave them the captured Spanish prize ship San Rosario (Sainte-Rose or Santa Rosa). In exchange Groginet gave Davis French commissions to sail against the Spanish. That May they combined to attack the Spanish treasure fleet. The buccaneers had the advantage in number of ships and men but were heavily outgunned by the large Spanish galleons: only Davis’ and Swan's ships had cannon. When Groginet's unarmed 308-man ship kept its distance and held off engaging the Spanish, Davis called off the attack. The English blamed Groginet's reluctance for the plan's failure and the fleet split up. The French under Groginet raided up the coast into Nicaragua, looting towns along the way. At Remedios (or possibly Quibo) they were caught ashore when Spanish vessels appeared, who attacked and burned the French ships. Groginet and his buccaneers marched overland and by 1686 were planning to head across the Isthmus of Darien when they were found and rescued by Townley, who had split his forces from Swan's. Together they attacked Spanish settlements in Grenada in April before splitting up again in May. Groginet met with an English force again in January 1687, and combined forces to sack Guayaquil. Groginet was wounded in the attack; he was carried back to sea where he died in April. The following month Davis and his company learned of Groginet's death, and heard that Townley had himself been killed the previous September in Panama. George Dew then took command of the Englishmen's forces while le Picard took the French , planning to march back to the Caribbean and sail the West Indies instead.

Written by David H. Goodman & Brigitte Hales and directed by Alex Kalymnios, it premiered on ABC in the United States on November 17, 2017. In the episode, the first of a two-hour outing, Hook's encounter with Rapunzel and its ties to Alice is revealed in a flashback, while Rogers search for a missing woman comes into play in the present day, and Ivy's scheme to take down Victoria accelerates into disarray. Plot Opening sequence The Witch's secret garden and a magic stone is featured in the background. In the Characters' Past In the Wish Realm, shortly after Snow White and Prince Charming have stopped Regina from casting her curse, Regina approaches Hook to inform him of the turn of events and tells him that she's in need of magic if they are to have any hope of carrying out their planned missions. Hook agrees to venture off into another realm to obtain magic for her from a witch. Upon reaching the top of the witch's tower, Hook finds a woman named Rapunzel, who claims to have been magically locked in the tower by the witch and instructs him to locate a golden flower that could help the both of them. While in the garden, Hook and Smee awaken a giant gnome but are able to find the flower. Hook sends Smee back to the crew, while he goes back to Rapunzel and offers his assistance. Rapunzel thanks him, but suddenly starts seducing him, and they have intercourse. The next morning, a baby appears in the tower as Rapunzel reveals herself to have been the witch Gothel in disguise. Gothel explains to Hook that the baby is a product of their night together and that she had planned it so that she could escape, as the tower's spell requires someone in her bloodline to be left behind in her place. Gothel jumps out of the tower and leaves Hook and the baby behind. Hook returns to his crew and decides to hand over the Jolly Roger to Smee, as he tells Regina that he's calling off his mission against the Dark One to deal with a more important matter. He returns to the tower to raise his newborn daughter, whom he decides to name Alice (who later grows up to be the same Alice from Wonderland). In Seattle In Hyperion Heights, Rogers is more determined than ever to find out what happened to Eloise Gardener. Henry insists on helping him get to the bottom of the case and they also recruit the street-wise Tilly. However, Victoria has been made aware of Rogers' mission and tells Weaver to throw him off of the case. After some digging, Tilly reports back to Rogers and Henry and tells them that some fellow street kids had informed her that Eloise had died a while back. Rogers is devastated by the news but is still feeling as if something isn't quite right. In a talk with Weaver about the conclusion of the case, Rogers realizes that Weaver and Tilly had conspired to feed him false information. Weaver is awake as Rumple, and probably knows about the Hook/Gothel/Alice ordeal, so he warns Rogers that the Eloise Gardener he seeks is not who he thinks she is. Despite this, Rogers heads over to Belfrey Towers to confront Victoria. Around the same time, Victoria is about to carry out a different consequence to a continuously uncooperative Gothel. However, Rogers arrives and finds the two women, mistakenly believing that Gothel is the missing girl and addresses her as Eloise, an identity she is all too willing to assume as he rescues her from Victoria. The police show up to arrest Victoria, who tells Drizella that she has yet to comprehend the true threat Gothel poses to the world. Tilly also shows up to the scene to apologize to Rogers for lying but he only tells her how disappointed he is in her. He drives away from the scene in an ambulance with Gothel, and Gothel glares at Tilly, recognizing her as the child she abandoned. In between the events, Regina tries to put some distance between Henry and Jacinda, who are working together on the food truck. She offers Jacinda a job at the bar, and when Jacinda is about to take the next step with Henry, Regina suggests that getting involved with a man might not be the best move in the eyes of Child Protective Services. Jacinda ends up blowing off a date with Henry due to this advice. Henry shows up later that night to deliver the good news that Belfrey has been arrested, and Jacinda runs off to getLucy, only to be greeted by Child Services, who takes Lucy away from Jacinda.

He is one of only two bucking bulls to win the title in three consecutive years. He is also the 2017 Professional Rodeo Cowboy Association (PRCA) Bucking Bull of the Year. Bruiser and Bodacious are the only bulls to win both titles and they also did it in the same year: Bruiser did it in 2017 and Bodacious in 1995. Bruiser was the PRCA Reserve Bucking Bull of the Year in 2015. Bruiser tied for the PBR title in 2016 with two other bulls (his brother, SweetPro’s Long John, and Pearl Harbor), and the tiebreaker went to him. Bruiser won the 2017 PBR title in a close race against Pearl Harbor. Bruiser won the title outright in 2018. Bruiser was also the American Bucking Bull (ABBI) Classic Final winner in 2015. He has won several other notable titles. SweetPro’s Bruiser is still actively bucking in the PBR and the PRCA.  Background  Bruiser was born on March 2, 2011, in Ardmore, Oklahoma, on the Rockin P Ranch owned by D&H; Cattle Company. D&H; Cattle Company is run by Dillon Page and his son H.D. Page. Bruiser is co-owned by Buck Cattle Company. Bruiser's breed is American Bucking Bull. His sire is 009 Show Time and his dam is Page T8. Show Time's grandsire is Wolfdancer. Show Time's granddam is AR 009, a daughter of Bodacious. Show Time was a two-time PBR World Finalist. Page T8's grandsire is three-time World Champion bull Little Yellow Jacket. In 2011, the PBR selected Little Yellow Jacket as the inaugural recipient of Heroes & Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor bull. His maternal granddam is a Mossy Oak Mudslinger daughter. Mossy Oak Mudslinger was also a D&H; Cattle Company bull, and he won the 2006 PBR World Champion Bull title. In 2017, the PBR selected Mossy Oak Mudslinger as that year's Heroes & Legends Celebration: Brand of Honor bull. Bruiser is a half-brother to the late 2015 PBR World Champion Sweet Pro's Long John. They share the same sire, but have different dams. While the Mossy Oak Mudslinger bloodline is especially well-known and easy to credit, H.D. Page gives just as much credit to the bulls' sire, Show Time. \\"It is awesome,\\" Page had said in 2015. \\"It speaks volumes of the work for Show Time. He has created the Classic Champ and the World Champ.\\" Bruiser and Long John, have \\"similar bucking styles and 2015 statistics\\", but Page says \\"their personalities at home are completely opposite\\". \\"Bruiser is your best friend,\\" Page said. \\"He tries to get along with you and Long John, one day he wants you to scratch him on the top of his head and the next day he will run you over.\\" Page called Bruiser his favorite bull. \\"Bruiser is what makes it worthwhile,\\" he said. \\"He is fun every morning. He is a character. If you don't go by and scratch him, he will just be over there screaming at you to come over there and love on him.\\"  Career  Bruiser competes on the PRCA. He also competed on the Built Ford Tough Series (BFTS) and now the Unleash the Beast Series (UTB) of the PBR.  2014 season  In Bruiser's debut into professional bucking, he started out in 2014 by bucking on a lower level tour of the PBR. He then bucked in an event of the PRCA. He followed that up by bucking on the BFTS including the PBR World Finals. He was ridden for a qualified ride three times this season as follows: On May 10, at the J.W. Hart PBR Challenge, a Touring Pro Division event in Decatur, Texas, 2004 World Champion Mike Lee rode Bruiser for 91 points, taking home first and second place. Bruiser was still a young bull then, just 3 years old. Bruiser scored 45 bull points on the ride. On Friday night, August 29, at the PBR BFTS WinStar World Casino & Resort Invitational in Thackerville, Oklahoma, Joao Ricardo Vieira rode Bruiser for 88.75 points to win Round 1. Bruiser received a bull score of 44 points for the ride. Joao also attempted Bruiser again at the PBR BFTS World Finals at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, but was bucked off in 3.44 seconds. Bruiser was marked a 44.50 bull score. On Saturday night, October 25, at the PBR BFTS World Finals, J.B. Mauney won Round 4 with a 93.25-point score on Bruiser, despite breaking his jaw in a collision with the bull at the buzzer. It was his best scored ride since he covered Smackdown for 93.75 points at the 2013 PBR BFTS World Finals.  2015 season  Some notable outs (trips out of the bucking chute) for Bruiser this season were as follows: In January, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, at a PBR BFTS event, Bruiser bucked off J.W. Harris in 4.29 seconds and was marked 44.75 bull points. In February, in Arlington, Texas, at the PBR Iron Cowboy event, Joao Ricardo Vieira rode Bruiser to win the second round by making a qualified ride for a season-high 90.50 points. Bruiser was marked 44.25 bull points. In May, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, at a PBR BFTS event, Guilherme Marchi was bucked off by Bruiser in 1.50 seconds. Bruiser was marked 45.25 bull points. On Saturday night, July 25, in Guymon, Oklahoma, at the Kasey Hayes/Stormy Wing Velocity Tour event, Kaique Pacheco rode Bruiser for a qualified ride that was scored an outstanding 94.00 points. Bruiser was marked a very high 46 bull points. The ride did not qualify for the 90-Point Club as it was not on the BFTS, but it is still notable as rides over 90 points are rare. Pacheco was the first right-handed rider to make a ride on Bruiser. Pacheco found that Bruiser required maximal effort to ride to the buzzer. In September, in Springfield, Missouri, Renato Nunes, was bucked off by Bruiser in 7.41 seconds, almost making the buzzer for 8 seconds. Bruiser was marked 46.25 bull points. Also that weekend, Valdiron de Oliveira was bucked off Bruiser for 4.29 seconds. Bruiser was marked 46 bull points. = 2015 ABBI Classic Finals = Round 1 of the PBR BFTS finals featured the top bulls of the American Bucking Bull (ABBI) in a Classic Finals round. The ABBI Classic Finals is a competition for 3- and 4-year-old bucking bulls. Bruiser had the highest score that night, scoring 89.75 points for the ride, and a bull score of 46 points. Bruiser was 3 years old when he won the Classic Finals for $200,000, and his total ABBI $462,782 career earnings is an ABBI record. = 2015 PBR World Finals = The 2015 World Champion Bull contender finalists were announced for 2015 as follows: Jared Allen's Air Time, Chad Berger's Smooth Operator, Julio Moreno's Roy, Rob Smets' Jeremiah and three bulls from D&H; Cattle: Bruiser, Long John, and Stone Sober. The finalists were selected in a vote of the top 35 bull riders. The winner is the bull that scores the highest total bull points from two outs during the PBR World Finals at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. This was Bruiser's and Long John's first year as finalists. Bruiser had a chance to win both titles for the first time in the same year, the PBR World Champion bull and the ABBI Classic Champion. He finished the regular season with an average bull score of 44.76 out of a possible 50 and a buckoff rate of 84.38 percent. He was ridden two times out of a total of eight attempts this year. He was also the top bull of the Springfield, Missouri, event with a high score of 46.25 points. On October 21, Wednesday night, Round 1 of the PBR BFTS Finals, Bruiser bucked for the first of his two outs. He bucked off Eduardo Aparecido in 2.94 seconds for a score of 44.75 points. His owner Page recognized that the bull \\"bucked hard, but it wasn't his best day\\" and the out was short of the 46-47 points needed to help him win the World Champion Bull title and surpass the other bulls Page had in contention (Long John and Stone Sober). On Saturday night, Round 4, J.B. Mauney rode Bruiser for 92.75 points. But after the whistle had blown, Bruiser yanked Mauney down and hit him in the chest. It was enough to prevent Mauney from further competition, keeping him from a chance to win the finals event, but he still won the World Championship. According to Lambert, Air Time and Smooth Operator were the frontrunners going into the finals. \\"I think it is those two and everyone else,\\" Lambert said. \\"If those two slip up, there are about five bulls that can be better.\\" Air Time scored 47 in his first out with Renato Nunes. Page's bull Long John scored 45.25 on Thursday night with a 2.72 second buckoff of Alexandre Cardozo. Page knew Long John would need a very high score on his second out if he hoped to catch up to Air Time. Then Long John was marked 47.25 points after tossing Fabiano Vieria in 7.41 seconds in the BFTS Championship Round. Both scores combined to give Long John a total finals score of 92.5 points. Smooth Operator, who recently had been performing at a sub-par level for him, finished second to last with a 42-point and 42.75 point set of outs at the finals. After the finals, Berger took the bull for a check-up and was surprised to discover the bull \\"had been trying to compete with a lower back/pelvis injury\\". In his second out, Air Time labored in the bucking chute with Ryan Dirteater and left the chute poorly and scored only 42.5 points in a 4.28 second buckoff, which left him with a total final score of 89.5 points. Long John won the championship with 92.5 points, and Bruiser came in second with 90 points. = 2015 PRCA National Finals Rodeo = Page usually runs Bruiser to several rodeos in the PRCA in the summer to keep him qualified for the National Finals Rodeo (NFR). In 2015, Long John was competing in both circuits too. Both bulls headed to the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, for the Thursday, December 3, beginning of the NFR. Long John had already been voted the runner-up to the 2015 Bucking Bull of the Year, Crystal Deal. This was the first time Bruiser and Long John competed in the same event in the PRCA. At the finals, in Round 2, Bruiser bucked off Kody DeShon in 4.00 seconds and was marked for a bull score of 46 points. In Round 9 Bruiser bucked off Joe Frost in 4.00 seconds and was marked a bull score of 45 bull points. = 2015 summary = Although he did not become the first ABBI Classic Champion to also win the World Championship, Bruiser did well, finishing the finals with 90 points, including 45.25 points in one of the finals outs. When Page found out Mauney had drawn Bruiser, he was very enthusiastic. Page knew it was too late for Bruiser to win the championship, so he rooted for Mauney. \\"It was a little too late for Bruiser. It was a great ride. When J.B. draws great bulls, you can look for great things to happen. As a stock contractor, that is who you want on them.” Mauney and Vieira were the only two riders to conquer Bruiser in nine BFTS outs this season. In Thackerville, Oklahoma, Mauney rode Bruiser for 92.25 points and took over the No. 1 ranking. Vieira conquered Bruiser for 90.5 points and won the Iron Cowboy event. Pacheco conquered Bruiser for 94 points in Guymon on the Velocity Tour. That season Bruiser's average on the BFTS was 45.22 per out. Page says \\"He just never failed in however many outs he has had since he was 2 years old\\". Page added that if all bulls were that consistent, \\"everyone would be in the bull business\\".  2016 season  Bruiser debuted this season riding in the third BFTS event of the year at Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Mason Lowe rode him for 91 points and Bruiser was marked a 44.25 bull score. Lowe reflected after riding Brutus for 91 points two months later that his ride on Bruiser is his favorite and it was his first 90-point ride in the PBR. Bruiser followed that up with a streak of seven buckoffs. = Young Guns Challenge = \\"Jess Lockwood, still gnawing on his mouthpiece, grabbed his bull rope and briskly walked out of the arena to a dark corner of the Wise County Fairgrounds.\\" Derek Kolbaba soon followed him after bucking off Long John. Bruiser was one of the bulls at the Young Guns Challenge at the J.W. Hart PBR Challenge Velocity Tour event in Decatur, Texas, in early June, where rookies were given a shot at the rankest (difficult) bulls from the BFTS. Young Jess Lockwood was matched up with Bruiser. Lockwood appeared to be about to win, when Bruiser \\"switch[ed] into high gear\\" at 6.57 seconds. Bruiser was scored 46.5 points for his efforts, and was the high marked bull of the event. \\"He was good. That is Bruiser,” Lockwood said shaking his head toward the ground. “He is going to go one way and switch it up the other. He let me know he was going the other way and I was ready. I was just a tick out of there and just missed the corner by a bit. I tried to cut loose and Cody Lambert said I missed the front by just half an inch. From there, if you are not going front you are going back and that’s what happened.” = Bruiser matures = When 2004 World Champion Mike Lee rode a three-year-old Bruiser in 2014 at a Touring Pro Division event the bull was virtually unknown at the time and very immature. Since then Lee has been on over 1,000 bulls to date, especially on the rankest bulls in the PBR. Lee said that the five-year-old Bruiser this year is a very different bull who has matured immensely. In July, in Vernal, Utah, at a PRCA event, Cole Melancon rode Bruiser for a qualified ride for a very high score of 92.50 points. Bruiser was marked 46 bull points. Bruiser's maturity showed itself on a Saturday in July in Guymon, Oklahoma, at the Kasey Hayes and Stormy Wing Touring Pro Division Invitational. Bruiser bucked off Douglas Duncan in 2.87 seconds for a 47.50 point bull score. The score does not count towards his BTFS series tour. It was Bruiser's first 47+ score at a PBR sanctioned event. Owner Page and the commentators elaborated on how rank his efforts were and how it represented \\"another example of how different he is from Air Time and Long John\\". He might be easier to follow because his timing is perfect, while the other two bulls are more \\"volatile\\". But Cody Lambert said \\"Bruiser is still so strong and fast that riders aren’t going to be able to just nod for the gate and hang on for 8 seconds\\". At the time of this out, Bruiser's highest bull score on the BFTS is 46.5 set on a buckoff of Eduardo Aprecido with a 2.94 second buckoff earlier in the season. So far this season, Bruiser is 7-1 on the BFTS and his career average is 45.28 points per out. Mason Lowe rode Bruiser for 91 points in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, in his season debut and, since then, Bruiser has bucked off seven consecutive riders. \\"I will get them to Tulsa, Thackerville, and Springfield as long as they are healthy and doing good,\\" Page said. \\"Both of them bulls (Long John and Bruiser) are so explosive that it is hard to keep them 100 percent when they are giving that kind of effort. You need to give them a week between outs.\\" On October 8, Saturday night at the DeWALT Flexvolt Invitational in Nampa, Idaho, Bruiser bucked off Mason Lowe in 2.56 seconds in a career high 46.75-point bull score in a rematch. He also became the high marked bull of the event. Bruiser has bucked off 11 straight riders since his first meetup with Lowe in Oklahoma City in his season debut. The 5-year-old bull has matured this season and now he weighs 1,750 pounds. Bruiser matured into a tougher bull to ride, which Page and J.W. Hart suggested give the bull a fair chance of winning the championship. On October 15, Saturday night in San Jose, California, Bruiser bucked off Tanner Byne in 2.93 seconds to earn a bull score of 45.25 points. The score took him to the top of the World Champion bull standings. After this ride, Page took Bruiser home to rest until the PBR World Finals.  Pre- finals  Page says the bull has never been injured even though he gives it all each time out. Bruiser all performs at his highest potential due to this. Bruiser led the bull race with four scores of 46 points or higher. He has scored 45 points or higher in 9 of 13 BFTS outs; this makes him a serious contender leading up to the finals. At the beginning of November, right before the PBR World Finals, Bruiser's hocks swelled up, and Page became very concerned. While loading the bull into his pen at the South Point Hotel, Casino and Spa in Las Vegas, Nevada, Page noticed it. At first, Page thought he had to decide between the bull's health or an opportunity for his first World Championship. Page and his associates came up with a way to use \\"poultice mud on Bruiser’s hocks and ankles to try and draw out the inflammation\\". Since Bruiser's temperament is gentle, they were able to work on him constantly for about four days. = 2016 PBR World Finals = On October 25, the PBR announced the contenders for the World Champion Bull. The finalists were: Sweet Pro's Bruiser (D&H; Cattle Company/Buck Cattle Co.), Pearl Harbor (Dakota Rodeo-Berger/Struve), Air Time (Jared Allen's Pro Bull Team), Sweet Pro's Long John (D&H; Cattle Co./Buck Cattle Co.), Seven Dust (J.A.R.S. Bucking Bulls/Gene Owen), Crossfire (Dakota Rodeo-Berger/Struve), Cochise (Gene Owen/Jane Clark), Stone Sober (D&H; Cattle Company) and Hey Jack (Gene Owen/Jane Clark). The winner was the bull with the total highest accumulated score during the PBR BFTS Finals. The PBR BFTS Finals were held at the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada, for the first time at the beginning of November. It took Bruiser two outs to win the World Champion Bull title. He was known all season long as the most consistent performer and proved on Championship Sunday. He earned the title in his second out by throwing off Brazilian champion Dener Barbosa at the 7.15-second mark and garnering himself a 46.25 bull score. When added to his first out's bull score, he had a total of 90.75 points. There was a three-way tie with the total score of 90.75 points with Bruiser, his brother and previous reigning champion Long John, and Pearl Harbor. The tie was broken by PBR ground rules for a World Finals. The rule was the sum of a bull's best eight outs. So Bruiser attending the finals as the No. 1 ranked season bull gave the tie breaker to him. Bruiser is now the 16th different title holder in PBR history. His first out was a third time meeting up with Mason Lowe the Thursday before in Round 1 where he bucked Lowe off in 5.66 seconds but was only scored 44.25 points. Even then, Lowe still believes Bruiser deserves the World Champion Bull title. \\"He is better if he is not laid off,\\" Page said. \\"He is a better bull if he is in his everyday work clothes. That is probably the reason I went to the last few events that moved him into the lead and on the average. He had a couple of great outs there toward the end of the season. That ended up being the dealbreaker.\\" Once again, Air Time was not a factor in the race due to misfortune. This time, Air Time hooked himself near the chutes right after getting out of the chute clean in a trip with Mauney. Mauney partially dislocated his shoulder and was awarded a re-ride. Air Time finished second to last. = Bruiser's stats = In his three-year career to date, Bruiser is 18–5 and has a 45.14 point bull score average. His average ride score is 91.25 points. Page says Bruiser is consistent into the gate to the left. He will not fake a rider out. The riders \\"know his pattern and what he is going to do. He isn’t going to change it up\\". = 2016 PRCA National Finals Rodeo = Page spent June trying to get Bruiser to enough PRCA rodeos to qualify for the NFR in December this year. In July, Bruiser bucked off Jeff Bertus in 3.8 seconds for a 46 point score, and he bucked off Garrett Vig for a 45 point score in 2.1 seconds at a rodeo in Belle Fourche, South Dakota. Page believes Bruiser bucking in the rodeos is all that is needed for the riders to decide to vote him in for the PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year or not, and that there is not much he can say to sway them. This is the second year Bruiser and Long John have qualified and competed at the NFR. The bulls and their owners arrived in Thanksgiving to start preparing. Page mentioned that the NFR has a new bull riding director, who is more accepting of bulls of Page's calibre. Bruiser first bucked in Round 3 and bucked off Jeff Askey in 4.00 seconds for a bull score of 46.50 points. On December 9, in Round 9 of the NFR, Brennon Eldred, won the round by riding Bruiser with a very high score of 94.5 points. \\"It's something I knew was possible with the bull I had tonight, because he is a champion bucking bull (the top bucking bull of the 2015 WNFR)\\", Eldred said. \\"That's the greatest bucking bull in the world. I was happier than a gopher in fresh dirt when I drew him\\". His ride on Bruiser tied for the 7th highest score at the NFR. It also tied for the highest at the Thomas & Mack Center since J.W. Harris' 94.5 ride back in 2010. = 2016 summary = Bruiser finished this season with 14 BFTS consecutive buckoffs. The only one to ride him was Mason Lowe in Bruiser's season-debut in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, for 91 points. Bruiser averaged 45.3 points per out. He was marked 46 or higher points one-third of the time. Heading into the World Champion Bull race of the BFTS World Finals, Bruiser had the highest average. However, he \\"underperformed\\" in the second round with a low score for bucking off Lowe, earning only 44.5 points for a 5.66-second out. Bruiser came back from that disappointment by tossing Dener Barbosa in 7.5 seconds for a 46.25 point bull score in the championship round on Sunday. Bruiser's first out with that low score of 44.5 needed a really high score in his second out to have any chance of winning the championship. Bruiser was a point and a half away from the lead. His second out with a 46.25 point bull score put him in a tie with two other bulls. Page says that \\"Since he has been a 2-year-old he has been that kind of athlete\\", and that \\"His personality makes him that much more special\\". Stock contractor Melissa Pate, friends with the Pages, also added that \\"A lot of people talk about how he might be a little easier, and maybe for some people he is, but it takes the world's best to get it from him.\\" This year at Finals three bulls actually tied for their scores, Bruiser, Long John, and Pearl Harbor. The tiebreaker went to Bruiser.  Season 2017  Bruiser traveled to Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, to make his season debut at the PBR Chesapeake Energy Arena for the Express Employment Professionals Invitational. Bruiser bucked that weekend in the Championship Round with other world champion bull contenders from last year, including 2015 World Champion SweetPro's Long John, Pearl Harbor, Jared Allen's Air Time, Stone Sober, Hey Jack, Seven Dust and Cochise. On Sunday, January 22, Derek Kolbaba picked Bruiser and rode him for a total score of 92 points. Bruiser's bull score was 45.50 points. The ride ended Bruiser's BFTS buckoff streak of 14 consecutive buckoffs, which started with this same event last January. He came in third in the event among bulls with only Pearl Harbor and Long John scoring higher marks. Bruiser was last ridden on the BFTS by Mason Lowe for 91 points in his 2016 debut at this event. Experts, including J.W. Hart, are picking Bruiser as the favorite for the world champion this year due to his consistency and accomplishments in the PBR, ABBI, and PRCA. \\"He is going for another PBR title,\\" Lambert said. \\"He can wind up as one of the most decorated bulls in PBR history with all of the money he has won in the ABBI. He was the top bull at the NFR (in 2015) and he crossed over into rodeo and should have been the PRCA champion.\\" In February at a PRCA event at the San Antonio Stock Show and Rodeo, in San Antonio, California, Roscoe Jarboe rode Bruiser for 91 points. Bruiser was scored a very high bull score of 48 points. After two similar trips, Bruiser has qualified for the NFR the last two seasons. Page is aiming for the NFR again by getting the minimum requirement of 8 outs. On February, 21, Bruiser's half-brother and 2015 World Champion Sweet Pro's Long John died. He was almost 7 years old and a strong contender to win the title again. He was also a fan favorite. Long John was certain to be a world champion bull contender again this year. On Saturday, March 11, in the Verizon Arena, during the PBR Bad Boy Mowdown, in North Little Rock, Arkansas, it took Bruiser 6.49 seconds to jerk back toward the right in order to rip Joao Ricardo Viera's rope out of his left riding hand. Bruiser scored 46 bull points for the out. \\"Outstanding trip for Bruiser\\", CBS Sports Network commentator J.W. Hart said on the air. \\"He is back in the World Championship mix\\". Bruiser was the No. 2 bull in the world. However, this 46 point score has him tied with Pearl Harbor for the most 46 point scores through 10 weeks. In February, in Arlington, Texas, at the AT&T; Stadium, during the PBR Iron Cowboy event, he bucked off 2012 PRCA World Bull Riding Champion Cody Teel in 2.69 seconds to go back-to- back in 46 point scores. On Sunday afternoon, March 19, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at the WisePies Arena aka The Pit, at the PBR Ty Murray Invitational presented by the Isleta Resort and Casino, Stormy Wing rode Bruiser in the BFTS Round for 95.25 points, which won him the event. The ride is tied for the fifth-highest score in PBR history with Mauney's iconic ride on three-time World Champion Bull Bushwacker in 2013. Bruiser was marked 46.75 bull points. 7x PRCA World Champion Murray said Wing will not ever forget this ride. Since the start of the PBR season, Bruiser and Pearl Harbor have distinguished themselves from the other bulls, even the other world champion contenders, and have been vying for bull dominance all year long. Since Kolbaba got a qualified ride on Bruiser for 92 points in Oklahoma City in January, Bruiser has bucked off five consecutive riders. On Saturday night, April 1, in the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, at the PBR First PREMIER Bank PREMIER Bankcard Invitational, Bruiser bucked Derek Kolbaba off in 2.22 seconds to earn a bull score of 46.25 seconds in the 15/15 Bucking Battle. He was named the YETI \\"Built for the Wild\\" Bull of the Event for his bull score as he had the highest bull score of the night. He also was the only bull to score over 46 points that night, both Air Time and Pearl Harbor were second and third place behind him with scores in the 45 point range. On Sunday afternoon, April 9, in Billings, Montana, in the PBR Stanley Performance In Action Invitational, presented by Cooper Tires, at the Rimrock Arena, J.B. Mauney had made his way into the Championship Round. He won the round with an excellent ride on Bruiser for an extremely high 94.25 points. It was his second qualified ride on the Bruiser. Bruiser was marked 46.25 bull points for his participation. Mauney won his first event of the year. Mauney first made a qualified ride on Bruiser in Round 4 of 2015 BFTS World Finals. Bruiser had the second highest score of the event; his closest competitor Pearl Harbor earned a very high bull score of 47.50 points. Lambert and bull rider Kolbaba say Bruiser is the bull riders should draw as he is likely to become one of the greatest bulls of all time. Lambert says Bruiser is rideable as long as you do everything right. He says Bruiser gets ridden more than bulls like Pearl Harbor and TLWs Big Cat, but that does not matter to his bull scores, which is how the champion is determined. In early May, one of Bruiser's closest competitors, Air Time, took himself out of the running when he injured his back in an out at the Last Cowboy Standing event in Las Vegas, Nevada. His competition status remained unknown until August 12, when a PBR press release announced that Jared Allen and Matt Scharping were retiring the bull to avoid another potential injury. Air Time was in the running for the title many years, but there were many mishaps that prevented him from closing on it. Losing both Long John and now Air Time essentially brought the world champion race to a duel between Bruiser and Pearl Harbor. On September 2, Bruiser was ranked No. 2 in the World Champion Bull standings. Bruiser trailed the No. 1 bull Pearl Harbor by a tiny bit more than a quarter of a point. (46.28 to 46). The bull had just bucked at a PRCA rodeo in Lawton, Oklahoma, where he had thrown off Trevor Kastner off in 6.41 seconds and been marked 47 bull points. Despite the excellent bull score, Page felt the bull was not bucking with his complete intensity. Having just come off some time with cows, \\"Page decided to try bucking Bruiser from a right-handed delivery\\". Three weeks later, at a PRCA rodeo in Caldwell, Idaho, Cole Melancon rode Bruiser for 90 points, and Bruiser scored 46 bull points. Page felt he was bucking well out of the right considering this was his first time out of that side. Page had planned to leave Bruiser as a left-hand delivery for his match up with Cody Teel in the 15/15 Bucking Battle. Teel met up with Bruiser before in his BFTS debut at Iron Cowboy in February and was bucked off in 2.69 seconds. The PBR event in Thackerville, Oklahoma, was the first event for Bruiser since he was ridden by Mauney for 94.25 points in Billings, Montana. Bruiser's weight had fluctuated in a typical manner for having come from some time on the cows for breeding. For 2017, the world champion bull title was based on the top eight outs during the BFTS season events plus two outs at the PBR World Finals. The bull with the highest aggregate score of those 10 outs earns the title and a $100,000 bonus. The bull that has the best regular season standing earns $25,000, and second place takes $10,000. As far as Bruiser's eight highest scores needed for the finals, a score of 45.5 points or higher would have allowed him to drop his lowest score (45.25 points). He only made 45.25 in Thackerville, though. However, Page had not been that concerned about the standings. He knew this race came down to the final two outs at the World Finals. Page said the finals will come down to a close race between his bull Bruiser and Pearl Harbor. On Saturday, September 2, in Thackerville, Oklahoma, at the PBR Winstar World Casino and Resort Invitational, in the 15/15 Bucking Battle, Bruiser was matched up with Cody Teel for the second time. Bruiser bucked off the PBR rookie in 1.90 seconds to earn a bull score of 45.25 points. On Saturday night, September 9, in Springfield, Missouri, at the BFTS 15/15 Bucking Battle presented by Bass Pro Shops in the JQH Arena, Bruiser was matched up with Jess Lockwood. This was their second outing together. It took Bruiser 6.06 seconds to buck Lockwood off, but it was an exceptional out for the bull, as he scored a very high 47.25. This score earned him the YETI \\"Built for the Wild\\" Bull of the Event. Bruiser was named the top bull for the sixth time this season. Bruiser bucked so hard he accidentally threw Lockwood such that his head hit the bull's back on the dismount, nearly breaking Lockwood's back and rendering him unconscious. = 2017 PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year = On October 23 the PRCA announced the winners of the 2017 Pendleton Whisky \\"Let 'er Buck\\" Stock of the Year awards. The Bull of the Year award went to D&H; Cattle's Sweet Pro's Bruiser. Bruiser was the alternate at the 2016 NFR. Bruiser was also the Bucking Bull of the NFR this season (and back in 2015). Bruiser never gave up a qualified ride for less than a 90 point score in the PRCA for the entire year, and only two riders made qualified rides on him. In February, in San Antonio,Texas, Roscoe Jarboe scored 91 points on him. Jarboe's score on Bruiser tied for the third highest score in the PRCA that year. In August, in Caldwell, Idaho, Cole Melancon scored 90 points on him. This is D&H; Cattle's second Bucking Bull of the Year title winner, who also had Shepherd Hills Tested win in 2013. H.D. Page expected Bruiser to win in 2016; he only won second place. Page did not expect it in 2017 but the bull riders apparently saw Bruiser as the worthy champion and voted him in this year. Bruiser competed in the finals this year at 6 years old and weighing 1,900 pounds. = 2017 PBR World Finals = Heading into the PBR World Finals, Bruiser and Pearl Harbor were almost tied for the lead. Pearl Harbor led 46.38 points to Bruiser's 46.34 points. Bruiser came in as the \\"reigning World Champion Bull that riders have won close to $1.5 million on\\". Bruiser is the clear choice of whom the bull riders prefer to ride, given Pearl Harbor's explosive bucking style on a 1,900 pound frame. Pearl Harbor won the season championship by a fraction of a point and also won $25,000 for his owner, Chad Berger. The method for determining the World Champion Bull remained the same as the previous year. Some of the other world champion bull contenders included TLW's Big Cat, Seven Dust, Jack Shot, and Spotted Demon. Although these bulls had lower scores than the two leaders, there was always a chance on of the top two might be eliminated through injury or a call for a re-ride or foul. Lambert says that \\"The rest of the bulls are great, but Pearl Harbor and Bruiser are the elite class\\". At the end of the regular season, Bruiser was 10-4 on the BFTS, meaning 10 buckoffs, 4 qualified rides. His season average was 45.95. Pearl Harbor was 11-1 for the regular season with a 46.02 point average. On November 2, Thursday, in Round 2, Bruiser took the lead in the first of two outs for the World Champion Bull race. Bruiser came out of the chute and immediately threw Resende to the dirt in only 1.91 seconds. It was the second fastest buckoff of the season for Bruiser and his second highest bull score. Bruiser claimed his second highest bull score and second fastest buckoff with that out. \\"It was just that first jump and I was pretty happy,\\" stock contractor H.D. Page said. \\"He is always the same. He just walked in there like he was going to go to sleep, but that is just his deal. He is cool as a cucumber.\\" Resende felt that Bruiser bucked even better than usual. He scored a 47 point bull score which moved him into first place over Pearl Harbor, who bucked off Laclan Richardson in 5.97 and scored 45.25 bull points. Bruiser's lead is just .17 points. Their next scheduled out was not until November 5, Sunday. On Sunday, November 5, in the Championship Round, Bruiser was matched up with Ryan Dirteater. He bucked Dirteater off in 7.19 seconds; Bruiser almost got ridden for 8 seconds. Bruiser scored 46 bull points for the buckoff. Thus, Bruiser became the 2017 World Champion Bull at the PBR BFTS World Finals and Pearl Harbor became the Reserve World Champion Bull. Bruiser's outs of 47 points on Emilio Resende and 46 points on Ryan Dirteater combined totaled more than Pearl Harbor's or any other world champion bull contender. He also won the 2017 Bull of the Finals Championship. \\"This is what I do for a living,\\" stock contractor H.D. Page said. \\"I've seen a lot of good bulls, but I've never come across one as good as this one. We've had some bulls be crowned World Champion Bull before, but this bull is just so cool and so ready to work and just a great athlete. It's more special.\\" There was a $100,000 award for the title and an additional $25,000 for the Bull of the Finals title. Bruiser became the fourth bull in PBR history to win back- to-back titles. He joined Bodacious in becoming the only other bull to win both the PBR World Champion Bull title and the PRCA Bull of the Year title. \\"We'll never, ever see another Bruiser,\\" Lambert said. \\"We're among greatness right now, and we better enjoy it and appreciate it because it won't last long.\\" Pearl Harbor came in second place after Dener Barbosa rode him during the Championship Round on Sunday for 89.5 points where he was scored 45.75 bull points. Filling out the other three spots in the top five were Bad Beagle, Jack Shot, and Cochise. Bruiser joins these other bulls to successfully repeat his title: two-time World Champion Dillinger, three-time World Champion Little Yellow Jacket, two-time World Champion Bones, and three- time World Champion Bushwacker, All of these bulls won back-to-back titles except Bones who won two titles a year apart. Bushwacker's owner, Julio Moreno, was noted for saying that Bruiser \\"is rightfully in the conversation as one of the greatest bucking bulls in PBR history\\". On Sunday, Bruiser's out with Ryan Dirteater, Bruiser used 7.19 seconds to buck him off. Bruiser \\"almost got tripped up leaving the bucking chutes\\". However, when he recovered, he was right back to his same powerful self that got him to this championship race. He \\"leapt so high that he was almost leaping completely above the arena signage\\". \\"Well he had such a good day the first day,\\" stock contractor H.D. Page said. \\"I just needed him to have a consistent day today. The first jump out of there (Sunday) I thought he was going to fall. He had a terrible jump. It's been a tough year and tough competition, but Bruiser has been a great bull all year.\\" = 2017 PRCA National Finals Rodeo = Although the Bucking Bull of the Year is voted on, decided, and announced in October, the bulls still compete in the NFR in December. Bruiser competed in 2 rounds of the 10 this year. In round 3, he was matched with Boudreaux Campbell whom he bucked off in 7.8 seconds, almost getting ridden. He earned an excellent bull score of 47.50 points. In round 9 he was matched up with Ty Wallace whom he bucked off in 4.10 seconds and he earned another excellent bull score of 47.00 bull points. = Season summary = Bruiser concluded his season with a 12-4 record. His season average bull score was 46.02, which is a career high for the bull. Bruiser scored 45 points or higher for all 16 of his outs this season, including that out with Jess Lockwood in Springfield, Missouri, where he earned a record high score of 47.25 bull points. Even though Lockwood was knocked unconscious at that out, Bruiser has an even composure. He is a competitor for eight seconds, then he is friendly in the back pens or in the pasture with his owners. H.D. and Lambert both say that the combination of great bucking bull but gentle disposition is a rare one. In fact, Lambert says \\"We’ll never, ever see another Bruiser\\". Hart says \\"He’ll be in the conversation of all-time best bull, but I don’t think he’s in the conversation for the rankest...The degree of difficulty is just not near that of Bushwacker or Dillinger, but he’s got the show\\". In March 2017, bull rider Stormy Wing rode Bruiser for 95.25 points, which is his highest marked ride score to date in his career. A perfect ride score is 100 points. Bruiser has gone out over 20 times for each of the last three seasons at all levels competing on both tours by competing all over the country. With his two wins this season on the PRCA and the PBR, he became the fourth back-to-back PBR World Champion Bull. He also became the second bull (after Bodacious) to win both titles: PBR World Champion Bull and PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year titles. Both bulls won their two titles in the same year. Bruiser in 2017, and Bodacious in 1995.  Season 2018  One of the next record within Bruiser's reach this season is Little Yellow Jacket's PBR record of three consecutive World Champion Bull titles. He was voted the top bull three consecutive years (2002-2004) as the PBR used to decide its World Champion Bull by a vote of its top bull riders. Bruiser has won his two titles by the sum of bull scores and performance at the PBR World FInals in the last two seasons. If Bruiser wins the title this year, he will tie Little Yellow Jacket's record. According to Lambert, he has already entered an elite category having won two titles in the PBR and the PRCA Bucking Bull of the Year. \\"If Bruiser does it this year, it is better than Little Yellow Jacket because he also has won a PRCA Bull of the Year, he has been the top bull at the NFR and at the PBR Finals, and he has won an ABBI championship,\\" Lambert said. \\"He is not as rank as Bushwacker, but neither is Little Yellow Jacket or any other bull in the history of bulls.\\" Bushwacker is the only other bull to win three PBR titles in 2011, 2013, and 2014. Bushwacker also won the ABBI championship. Bruiser and Pearl Harbor start this season as the favorites to win the title. On January 21, in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, at a PBR Unleash the Beast Series (UTB) event, Express Employment Professionals Invitational at the Chesapeake Energy Arena, in the Championship Round, Ryan Dirteater rode Bruiser in a qualified ride for a career-high 93.25 points. Dirteater considered it a revenge ride for Bruiser's buck off of him in the 2017 PBR World FInals. Bruiser was marked 45.50 bull points in his season debut. Dirteater won the event thanks to his ride on Bruiser. On Saturday night, February 3, in Anaheim, California, at a PBR (UTB) event, the Anaheim Invitational, Cody Nance rode Bruiser for 88.75 points to obtain a qualified ride in the Championship Round. Bruiser was marked an average score of 44.25 for a bull of his calibre. Nance won the Championship Round and the event after Bruiser was his third qualified ride that weekend. In February, at a PRCA event, the San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo, in San Antonio, Texas, Bruiser rebounded after Nance's ride by bucking off two bull riders. In Round 2 he bucked off Chase Dougherty in 7.09 seconds and was marked 46.50 bull points. In Round 3 he bucked off Tate Smith in 3.70 seconds for a bull score of 45.00 points. On the weekend of February 25, in Arlington, Texas, at a PBR (UTB) event, at the WinStar Casino & Resort Invitational, the Iron Cowboy, Bruiser bucked off Emilio Resende in 5.39 seconds for a bull score of 46.00 points. Pearl Harbor also scored a 46 point bull score for bucking off Teel in 6.16 seconds. The bulls shared the YETI \\"Built For the Wild\\" Bull of the Event. On Saturday night, March 3, in North Little Rock, Arkansas, at a PBR (UTB) event, the Bad Boy Mowdown at Verizon Arena, in the Championship Round, 2017 World Champion Jess Lockwood made yet another attempt to ride Bruiser. This was their third matchup, and the third time Bruiser has bucked off Lockwood. Bruiser threw him off in 4.89 seconds after he turned back to the right, away from Lockwood's hand. Bruiser was marked a high score of 46.50 bull points for the buckoff. Lockwood has had his fill of \\"making mistakes\\" against Bruiser, and he was annoyed with himself for failing to win his first (UTB) event slip by. \\"He made me look stupid like he did the last two times,\\" Lockwood said. \\"He bucks hard and I am not cowboying up and getting him rode. He is just leaving me each time.\\" Bruiser edged out Old Fort Days and Pearl Harbor to be named the YETI Built for the Wild Bull of the Event. On March 9 weekend, in Duluth, Georgia, at a PBR (UTB) event, the Duluth Invitational at the Infinite Energy Arena, in the Championship Round, Bruiser bucked off Cody Teel in 6.47 seconds. Bruiser was marked 45.75 bull points for the buckoff. Teel thought he had a good hold of the bull, but Bruiser found another gear midway and thrust Teel off. The two met for the third time, and the score is 3-0 in Bruiser's favor. Bruiser won the YETI Built For The Wild Bull of the Event title. Teel's helmet was wrecked in the buckoff. On Sunday afternoon, March 18, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at a PBR (UTB) event, at the Dreamstyle Arena aka The Pit, at the Ty Murray Invitational, presented by Isleta Resort & Casino, Bruiser bucked off Brennon Eldred in 4.71 seconds for a very high bull score of 47.25 points and tied his career high score. Bruiser bucked so hard Eldred \\"felt his knee pop\\". The bull kicked his back legs up over the chutes while Eldred fell off. Lambert said he would have scored Bruiser 48 points. Bruiser had no competition from Pearl Harbor that weekend as the bull fouled himself. On Friday night, on March 23, in Glendale, Arizona, at a PBR (UTB) 15/15 Bucking Battle event, at the Ak- Chin Invitational, presented by Cooper Tires, Bruiser and Pearl Harbor both bucked off their riders with exceptional enough bucking displays that the judges marked both of them with very high scores of 47+. Bruiser ejected Ryan Dirteater after 6.67 seconds for a bull score of 47.50 points. It was his second 47-point outing in two weeks, last week having scored on a ride with Brennon Eldred. Bruiser burst out of the bucking chute while gaining strength steadily and Dirteater ran out of his own drive at 6.67 seconds. Cody Nance survived a huge jump on Pearl Harbor, staying aboard for 5.94 seconds, but was ultimately unable to best the bull's strength. Pearl Harbor was marked 47.25 points for the out, which tied his career-highest score. It was great rebound performance after he hipped himself last weekend. Bruiser made the highest score of the weekend; Pearl Harbor's Chad Berger had hoped for the top-marked bull, but was satisfied to see the bull get a clean out of the chute. \\"Just the way he blew out of there and kicked and come around to the left,\\" Berger said. \\"He blew ahead and come back around the right,\\" Berger said. :It would take a hell of a hand to get by him when he bucks like that. I was just real impressed with his power, his change of direction. Everything.\\" In addition to their close bull scores, both \\"had drawn a rider with a no-quit attitude that gave each bull a strong test\\" and helped them get strong scores. \\"I am always for the bull, but I still like the guys too,\\" Page said. \\"I think it is the best thing ever when they can be 94-95. I am still looking for the highest score.\\" Berger added, \\"It really did. (Nance) gritted it out and rode him about as long as anybody does or a little bit longer. He has been the hardest guy to buck off on the tour.\\" Bruiser is 8-2 to date, and Pearl Harbor is 8-0. Bruiser's season average to date is 45.97 points. Pearl Harbor's average is 45.69 points. There is a little more than a quarter of a point difference between them. The next closest competitor is Spotted Demon, a 10 year-old bull who recently posted his second 46-point score of the season. He is only .72 points behind Bruiser. He needs four more outs to qualify for the championship bull race. On Saturday, April 21, in Billings, Montana, at a PBR (UTB) event, at the Rimrock Auto Arena, the Stanley Performance In Action Invitational presented by Cooper Tires, at the 15/15 Bucking Battle, Bruiser bucked off Claudio Montanha, Jr., in 4.67 seconds and earned a bull score of 46.25 points. Bruiser went left out of the bucking chute and starting spinning, the force sending Montanha off after a couple spins. For the sixth time this season, Bruiser was named the YETI \\"Built for the Wild\\" Bull of the Event. Bruiser's score narrowed the gap on World No. 1 Pearl Harbor to an incremental .03 points. Pearl Harbor was pulled out of the event due to a neck strain injury. This season, it was Bruiser's second fastest buckoff. It was also his six consecutive buckoff. On Tuesday, April 24, Pearl Harbor died of a blood clot near his brain at the age of 6 years old. At the time, Pearl Harbor was the No. 1 bull in the PBR World Standings. He had a 46.25-point average and was 10-0 on the (UTB). \\"I was a huge fan of Pearl Harbor,\\" said H.D. Page. \\"I wanted Bruiser to beat him every week, but there were weeks I knew we got beat. I am a huge fan of bull riding and watching a great bull like that buck, I would go buy a ticket to watch those great bulls buck. He sure will be missed. The rivalry between him and Bruiser has been there and it was just heating up. It was really fun. I was never upset when he won because those are two great bulls. Now it is like a fight that went unfought kind of deal.\\" \\"He was one of the best two bucking bulls in the world these past couple of years,\\" Lambert said. \\"He was harder to ride than Bruiser, but he didn't quite have the flash to beat him; and Bruiser is one of the all-time greats, and so is Pearl Harbor. Pearl Harbor is in the conversation with the all-time greats even though he hasn't won a championship.\\" In May, in Las Vegas, Nevada, at a PBR (UTB) event, the Last Cowboy Standing, presented by Ariat, at Helldorado Days, inside the Thomas and Mack Center, during Round 3 Kaique Pacheco was randomly matched up with Bruiser. Pacheco retained his usual cool when riding the bull for a career-high 92.75 points. Bruiser turned left out of the bucking chute as he typically does. He then turned back into Pacheco's right- hand at the 4-second mark. Pacheco earned a bonus payout of $26,000 due to the ride being the high-marked ride of the weekend. The ride also brought his total earnings at the Last Cowboy Standing this weekend to a career-best $160,291.67. The ride marked Pacheco's third time on Bruiser. Their first ride was in 2015 when they were still very new to the PBR. Pacheco rode the bull in a lower level tour at Guymon, Oklahoma, for 94 points back then. Pacheco explained how Bruiser was the best bull for him. The judges marked Bruiser 45.5 bull points and ended his streak of three consecutive outs with 46.25 plus scores. Bruiser heads into the summer break as the No. 1 bull in the World Standings. The next elite series event is in August.

Dated 1743, this is a late example The Luck of Edenhall, a 13th-century enamelled glass cup made in Syria or Egypt Enamelled glass or painted glass is glass which has been decorated with vitreous enamel (powdered glass, usually mixed with a binder) and then fired to fuse the glasses. It can produce brilliant and long-lasting colours, and be translucent or opaque. Unlike most methods of decorating glass, it allows painting using several colours, and along with engraving, has historically been the main technique used to create the full range of image types on glass. All proper uses of the term \\"enamel\\" refer to glass made into some flexible form, put into place on an object in another material, and then melted by heat to fuse them with the object. It is called vitreous enamel or just \\"enamel\\" when used on metal surfaces, and \\"enamelled\\" overglaze decoration when on pottery, especially on porcelain. Here the supporting surface is glass. All three versions of the technique have been used to make brush-painted images, which on glass and pottery are the normal use of the technique. Enamelled glass is only one of the techniques used in luxury glass, and at least until the Early Modern period it appears in each of the leading centres of this extravagant branch of the decorative arts, although it has tended to fall from fashion after two centuries or so. After a brief appearance in ancient Egypt, it was first made in any quantity in various Greco-Roman centres under the Roman Empire, then medieval Egypt and Syria, followed by medieval Venice, from where it spread across Europe, but especially to the Holy Roman Empire. After a decline from the mid-18th century, in the late 19th century it was revived in newer styles, led by French glassmakers. Enamel on metal remained a constant in goldsmithing and jewellery, and though enamelled glass seems to virtually disappear at some points, this perhaps helped the technique to revive quickly when a suitable environment arrived. It has also been a technique used in stained glass windows, in most periods supplementary to other techniques, and has sometimes been used for portrait miniatures and other paintings on flat glass. Techniques Glass is enamelled by mixing powdered glass, either already coloured (more usual) or clear glass mixed with the pigments,Gudenrath, 23–24 with a binder such as gum arabic that gives a thick liquid texture allowing it to be painted with brushes. Generally the desired colours only appear when the piece is fired, adding to the artist's difficulties. As with enamel on metal, gum tragacanth may be used to make sharp boundaries to the painted areas. The paint is applied to the vessel, which has already been fully formed; this is called the \\"blank\\" . Once painted, the enamelled glass vessel needs to be fired at a temperature high enough to melt the applied powder, but low enough that the vessel itself is only \\"softened\\" sufficiently to fuse the enamel with the glass surface, but not enough to deform or melt the original shape (unless this is desired, as it may be). The binding and demarcating substances burn away.Ward, 57–59; Carboni, 203; Gudenrath, 23–27, and throughout, has very full details of manufacturing processes. Until recent centuries the enamel firing was done holding the vessel in a furnace on a pontil (long iron rod), with the glassmaker paying careful attention to any changes in the shape. Many pieces show two pontil marks on the base, where the pontil intruded on the glass, showing it had been on the furnace twice, before and after the enamels were applied. Modern techniques, in use since the 19th century, use enamels with a lower melting point, enabling the second firing to be done more conveniently in a kiln.Gudenrath, 23–27, and throughout, has very full details of manufacturing processes. Gudenrath is emphatic that kiln firing of enamels is not found before the 19th century, and criticises Carboni and many others for propagating this \\"misunderstanding\\" – see 69–70. In fact some glassmakers allowed for a deforming effect in the second firing, which lowered and widened the shape of the vessel, sometimes very greatly, by making blanks that were taller and more narrow than the shape they actually wanted.Gudenrath, 50–58 The enamels leave a layer of glass projecting very slightly over the original surface, the edges of which can be felt by running a finger over the surface. Enamelled glass is often used in combination with gilding, but lustreware, which often produces a \\"gold\\" metallic coating is a different process. Sometimes elements of the \\"blank\\", such as handles, may only be added after the enamel paints, during the second firing.Gudenrath, 35–36, 52 Glass is sometimes \\"cold painted\\" with enamel paints that are not fired; often this was done on the underside of a bowl, to minimize wear on the painted surface. This was used for some elaborate Venetian pieces in the early 16th century, but the technique is \\"famously impermanent\\", and pieces have usually suffered badly from the paint falling off the glass.Gudenrath, 23 Some modern techniques are much simpler than historic ones. For instance, there now exist glass enamel pens.Enameling ebook, Delphi Glass Mica may also be added for sparkle. History The Tutmose III jar, c. 1425 BC Ancient The history of enamelled glass begins in ancient Egypt not long after the start of making glass vessels (as opposed to objects such as beads) around 1500 BC, and some 1400 years before the invention of glassblowing. A vase or jug, probably for perfumed oil, found in the tomb of the pharaoh Tutmose III and now in the British Museum dates to about 1425 BC. The base glass is blue, and it has geometrical decoration in yellow and white enamels; it is 8.7 cm high.Gudenrath, 28 However, and rather \\"incredibly\\", this is the only known enamelled glass piece from before (about) the first century AD.Gudenrath, 30; British Museum page Enamel was used to decorate glass vessels during the Roman period, and there is evidence of this as early as the late Republican and early Imperial periods in the Levant, Egypt, Britain and around the Black Sea.Rutti, B., Early Enamelled Glass, in Roman Glass: two centuries of art and invention, M. Newby and K. Painter, Editors. 1991, Society of Antiquaries of London: London.So Rutti; Gudenrath, 33 has Roman examples \\"beginning in the early decades of the empire\\". Designs were either painted freehand or over the top of outline incisions, and the technique probably originated in metalworking. Production is thought to have come to a peak in the Claudian period and persisted for some three hundred years, though archaeological evidence for this technique is limited to some forty vessels or vessel fragments. Among a variety of pieces, many perhaps fall into two broad groups: tall, clear drinking glasses painted with scenes of sex (from mythology) or violence (hunting, gladiators), and then low bowls, some of coloured glass, painted with birds and flowers. This latter group appear to date to about 20–70 AD, and findspots are widely distributed across the empire, indeed many are found beyond its borders; they may have been made in north Italy or Syria.Gudenrath, 33 The largest group of survivals comes from the Begram Hoard, found in Afghanistan, a deposit of various luxury items in storerooms, probably dating to the 1st century AD, or perhaps later. In the past they have been dated to the 3rd century. The group has several goblets and other pieces with figures. It is thought these pieces were made in a Roman centre around the Mediterranean, perhaps Alexandria.Whitehouse, 441–445, these are his \\"Group 10\\".

This is ended in spectacular fashion by a 10th or 11th-century Byzantine bowl in the Treasury of Saint Mark's, Venice. This is of very high quality and shows great confidence in using the technique, which had no doubt been reborrowed from enamel on metal, although Byzantine enamel uses brush painting very little.Gudenrath, 40–42; also Gudenrath, William, et al. “Notes on the Byzantine Painted Bowl in the Treasury of San Marco, Venice.” Journal of Glass Studies, vol. 49, 2007, pp. 57–62. JSTOR Some other, technically similar works, one possibly from the same workshop, are also extant. Section on pages 180-183 (including illustrations) Islamic Mosque Lamp of Amir Qawsun (d. 1342), Egypt, with the symbol of his office as the Sultan's cup- bearer.\\"Mosque Lamp of Amir Qawsun\\", Metropolitan Museum the whole bottle There is little surviving Byzantine enamelled glass, but enamel was much used for jewellery and religious objects, and appears again on glass in the Islamic Mamluk Empire from the 13th century onwards,Osborne, 335, though individual dates, especially of pieces with figural decoration, have been controversial in recent years – see Ward, 55–57 used for mosque lamps in particular, but also various types of bowls and drinking glasses. Gilding is often combined with enamels. The painted decoration was generally abstract, or inscriptions, but sometimes included figures. The places of manufacture are generally assumed to have been in Egypt or Syria, with any more precise locating tentative and somewhat controversial.Carboni, 199-207, and entries following; Ward, 55; Gudenrath, 42 Enamels used oil-based medium and a brush or reed pen, and the physical properties of the medium encouraged inscriptions, which are useful for determining dates and authorship. According to Carl Johan Lamm, whose two-volume book on Islamic glass (Mittelalterliche Glaser und Steinschnittarbeiten aus dem Nahen Osten, Berlin, 1929/30) has long been the standard work, the main centres, each with its own style, were in turn Raqqa (1170–1270), Aleppo (13th century), Damascus (1250–1310) and Fustat (Cairo, 1270–1340). However this chronology has been disputed in recent years, tending to push dates later, and rearranging the locations. In particular there is disagreement as to whether elaborate pieces with figural decoration are early or late, effectively 13th or 14th century, with Rachel Ward arguing for the later dates.Ward, 55–57; Carboni, 204 The shape of mosque lamps in this period is very standard; despite being suspended in the air through their lugs when in use, they have a broad foot, a rounded central body, and a wide flaring mouth. Filled with oil, they lit not only mosques, but also similar spaces such as madrassas and mausoleums. Mosque lamps typically have the Quranic verse of light written on them, and very frequently record the name and title of the donor, an important thing as far as he was concerned, as well as the name of the reigning sultan; they are thus easy to date reasonably precisely. As Muslim rulers came to have quasi-heraldic blazons, these are often painted.Ward, 57; Carboni, 203, 207; Enamelled glass became more rare, and of rather poorer quality, in the 15th century. This decline may have been partly due to the sack of Damascus by Tamerlane in 1401, as has often been claimed, though by then Cairo was the main centre.Carboni, 207; Ward, 70–71 Some secular vessels have painted decoration including figures; some of this may have been intended for non-Islamic export markets, or Christian customers, which is clearly the case with a few pieces, including a bottle elaborately painted with clearly Christian scenes that may commemorate the election for a new abbot at a Syrian monastery.Carboni, 242–245 (# 121). He is aware only of this bottle and the two beakers in Baltimore, mentioned below. Other pieces show the courtly scenes of princes, riders hawking or fighting, that is found in other media in contemporary Islamic art, and sometimes inscriptions make it clear these were intended for Muslim patrons.Carboni, 226–227, 241–242, 247–252 After mosque lamps, the most common shape is a tall beaker, flaring towards the top. This was made somewhat differently from the mosque lamps, the flaring apparently done in the course of the second firing.Gudenrath, 43-46 These often have figural decoration, although the Luck of Edenhall, perhaps the finest of the group, does not. Some have decoration of fishes or birds,Fish; birds and other humans, often on horseback.Example in Louvre, and Freer Sackler The Palmer Cup in the Waddesdon Bequest (British Museum) shows an enthroned ruler flanked by attendants,Contadini, Anna (1998), \\"Poetry on Enamelled Glass: The Palmer Cup in the British Museum\\", in: Ward, R, (ed.), Gilded and Enamelled Glass from the Middle East.

Venice, c. 1480, perhaps by Angelo Barovier It is now known that the technique was being used in Venetian glass from the late 13th century, mostly to make beakers.Aldrevandini Beaker, British Museum Until about 1970 it was thought it did not appear in Venice until around 1460,Osborne, 335 and surviving early Venetian pieces were attributed elsewhere. The Aldrevandin(i) Beaker in the British Museum is now regarded as a work of about 1330, having once been thought to be much later. It is an armorial beaker that is, unusually, inscribed with the name of its maker: \\"“magister aldrevandin me feci(t)” - probably the decorator.Gudenrath, 47-50; Aldrevandini beaker, British Museum It is \\"the iconic head of a group of more or less similar objects\\" and arguably \\"the most widely known and published medieval European glass vessel\\". It is large and \\"has considerable visual “gravity.” When it is held, however, it is shockingly lightweight\\" with in most parts, the glass sides \\"scarcely more than a millimeter thick\\".Gudenrath, 48 Angelo Barovier's workshop was the most important in Venice in the mid-15th century – in the past his family was credited with introducing the technique. Much Venetian glass was exported, especially to the Holy Roman Empire, and copied increasingly expertly by local makers, especially in Germany and Bohemia.Gudenrath, 62–63 By the 16th century the place of manufacture of pieces described as \\"facon de Venise\\" (\\"Venetian style\\") is often hard to discern. Armorial glass, with a painted coat of arms or other heraldic insignia, was extremely popular with the wealthy. The painting was often not done at the same time or place as the main vessel was made; it might even be in a different country. This remains an aspect of enamelled glass; by the 19th century some British-made glass was even being sent to India to be painted. The Reichsadlerhumpen or \\"Imperial Eagle beaker\\" was a large beaker, holding as much as three litres, presumably for beer, showing the double-headed eagle of the Holy Roman Empire, with the arms of the imperial various territories on its wings. This was a popular showpiece that did not need customised designs. It was probably first made in Venice, but was soon mainly made in Germany and Bohemia.Osborne, 335; Gudenrath, 62–65 By the 17th century, \\"German enamelling became stereotyped within a limited range of subjects\\", most often using the humpen beaker shape. The earliest dated enamelled humpen is from 1571, in the British Museum;Gudenrath, 62 a late example, dated 1743, is illustrated above. Another standard design was the Kurfürstenhumpen or \\"Elector's beaker\\", showing the Electors of the Holy Roman Emperor, often in procession on horseback, in two registers, or alternatively seated around the emperor. Drinking glasses with royal arms are often called hofkellereihumpen (court cellar beaker). Other subjects are seen, including religious ones such as the Apostelhumpen, with the twelve apostles, hunting scenes, standard groups of personifications such as the Four Seasons, Ages of Man and the like, and pairs of lovers.Osborne, 335, 401 In Renaissance Venice, \\"betrothal\\" pieces were made to celebrate engagements or weddings, with the coats of arms or idealized portraits of the couple.Venetian betrothal goblet, Victoria and Albert Museum Milk glass cup and saucer, imitating porcelain. Venice, c. 1730–45 Enamelled glass ceased to be fashionable in Italy by around 1550, but the broadly Venetian style remained popular in Germany and Bohemia until the mid-18th century, after which the remaining production was of much lower quality, though often bright and cheerful in a folk art way. It is sometimes called \\"peasant glass\\", though neither the makers nor customers fitted that description.Osborne, 335; Gudenrath, 64-65 Enamelled glass was now relatively cheap, and the more basic styles were no longer a luxury preserve of the rich. By this time a new style using opaque white milk glass had become popular in Italy, England and elsewhere. The glass was hard to distinguish visually from porcelain, but much cheaper to make, and the enamel painting technique was very similar to the overglaze enamel painting by then the standard for expensive porcelain. The English makers specialized in small vases, typically up to seven inches tall, usually with a couple of chinoiserie figures; London, Bristol and south Staffordshire were centres.Gudenrath, 65–66; Osborne, 401 Even smaller perfume or snuff bottles with stoppers were also being made in China itself, where they represented a cheaper alternative to materials such as jade.Osborne, 335–336 A distinct style that originated with the glassmaker Johann Schaper of Nuremberg in Germany around 1650 was the schwarzlot style, using only black enamel on clear or sometimes white milk glass. This was a relatively linear style, with images often drawing on contemporary printmaking. Schaper himself was the best artist to use it, specializing in landscapes and architectural subjects. The style was practiced in Germany and Bohemia until about 1750, and indeed is sometimes used on a large scale on German windows much later.Osborne, 335–336, 693–694; Gudenrath, 64 In the 19th century there was increasing technical quality in many parts of Europe, initially with revivalist or over-elaborate Victorian styles; the Prague firm of Moser was a leading producer. In the later part of the century fresher and more innovative designs, often anticipating Art Nouveau, were led by French makers such as Daum and Émile Gallé.Osborne, 336, 401–403 It was for the first time possible to kiln-fire pieces, greatly simplifying the process and making it more reliable, reducing the risk of having to reject pieces and so allowing more investment in elaborate decorative work.Gudenrath, 66–68 German stained glass of 1444; only the \\"olive-green\\" parts are enamel Most pieces were now relatively large vases or bowls for display; the style related to design movements in other media such as art pottery, the Arts and Crafts movement, but was often especially well suited to glass. This style, culminating in Art Nouveau glass, was normally extremely well made, and often used a variety of techniques, including enamel. The best known American firm, making Tiffany glass, was not especially associated with the use of enamel, but it frequently appears, often as a minor element in designs. On flat glass Enamelled glass is mostly associated with glass vessels, but the same technique has often been used on flat glass. It has often been used as a supplementary technique in stained glass windows, to provide black linear detail, and colours for areas where great detail and a number of colours are required, such as the coats of arms of donors. Some windows were also painted in grisaille. The black material is usually called \\"glass paint\\" or \\"grisaille paint\\". It was powdered glass mixed with iron filings for colour and binders, which was applied to glass pieces before the window was made up, and then fired.Investigations in Medieval Stained Glass: Materials, Methods, and Expressions, xvii, eds., Brigitte Kurmann-Schwarz, Elizabeth Pastan, 2019, BRILL, , 9789004395718, google books It therefore is essentially a form of enamel, but is not usually so called when talking about stained glass, where \\"enamel\\" refers to other colours, often applied over the whole surface of one of the many pieces making up a design . Enamel on metal was used for portrait miniatures in 16th-century France, and enjoyed something of a revival after about 1750. Some artists, including Henry Bone, sometimes painted in enamels on glass rather than the usual copper plate, without the change in base material making much difference to their style. Jean-Etienne Liotard, who usually worked in pastel, made at least one genre painting in enamels on glass.Swoboda, Gudrun, \\"Point of View #2: Jean-Etienne Liotard (1702–1789), Painter of Extremes\\", 7-10, 14, in KHM Ansichtssache #2, Vienna, online Gallery Venitian glass circa 1330 with enamel decoration derived from Islamic technique and style.jpgAldrevandini beaker, a Venetian glass with enamel decoration derived from Islamic technique and style.

Qatar is a heavy investor in Tunisia, and ranks second globally in terms of foreign direct investments in Tunisia. The two enjoyed close political relations during the Ennahda Movement's assumption of power in Tunisia in 2011. Diplomatic representation Qatari embassy in Tunisia Qatar maintains an embassy in Tunisia's capital city Tunis, while Tunisia has an embassy in Doha, Qatar. Diplomatic visits In June 2017, during the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis, Qatar's State Minister for Foreign Affairs, Sultan bin Saad Al Muraikhi, met with Tunisian president Beji Caid Essebsi to discuss international matters of interest. Diplomatic cooperation Political During the reign of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali as President of Tunisia, Qatar's media network Al Jazeera often denounced his actions, and its editorial line embraced the Tunisian Revolution, which led to his ouster in 2011. Relations between Qatar and Tunisia improved immensely between 2011 and 2013, when Ennahda Movement-affiliated candidate Hamadi Jebali was declared Prime Minister of Tunisia in the 2011 Tunisian Constituent Assembly elections. Cooperation in all fields gradually started picking up traction; for instance, the two governments signed ten bilateral agreements in 2012. One of the agreements involved the Qatar Armed Forces enlisting Tunisian military personnel within its ranks. When Ennahda relinquished power in 2014, Qatar continued supporting Tunisia's government in the form of financial aid and loans. Qatar also cast Tunisia in a positive light through two of its most influential news organizations, Al-Araby Al-Jadeed and Al Jazeera. Qatar's ambassador to Tunisia paid $2.2 million for Tunisia to host an international investment conference in November 2016. Moreover, during the conference, Qatar pledged $1.25 billion in aid to Tunisia in an effort to help improve its economy. The Qatar-Tunisia Joint Higher Committee was formed to deliberate over issues of mutual interest. =2017 Qatari diplomatic crisis= On 5 June 2017, a number of states led by Saudi Arabia cut ties with Qatar. Tunisia adopted a neutral stance on this issue, calling for the parties to negotiate a solution to the dispute. Moncef Marzouki, president of Tunisia from 2011 to 2014, supported Qatar's position against the blockading countries. Economic Qatar is among the largest Arab investors in Tunisia. Qatar's investments in Tunisia in 2015 exceeded QR 4 billion, making it Tunisia's most important Arab partner and second-most important global partner in terms of foreign direct investment.

Sheet vinyl flooring is vinyl flooring that comes in large, continuous, flexible sheets. A vinyl sheet floor is completely impermeable to water, unlike vinyl floor tile, which comes in stiff tiles, and vinyl planks, which come in interlocking strips. It is sometimes called linoleum after a similar product of different (oiled linen) chemical composition. Vinyl flooring is extensively used because it is water-impervious, fairly durable, adjustably resilient and insulating, easy to install, available with a variety of appearances, and inexpensive. Custom-print vinyl sheet flooring may cost an order of magnitude more, if ordered commercially, However, vinyl flooring has environmental concerns in manufacturing, use, and disposal.Affidavit of the Senior Public Health Scientist, New York State Office of the Attorney General Structure The three basic categories of vinyl sheet flooring are homogeneous, inlaid, and layered composite. Vinyl flooring differs in manufacturing process and polyvinyl chloride content. Composite manufacturing begins with a fibrous backing sheet. This was often felt or paper (before 1980, often with asbestoshttps://www.bergmanlegal.com/asbestos-stopped-in- vinyl-sheet-flooring/); more modernly, it is generally fiberglass. This sheet is coated in vinyl and plasticizer. The resulting sheet is printed and possibly embossed (the print layer). Then the sheet is coated again with one or more protective wear layers, the topmost of which may be polyurethane, to avoid waxing.http://www.madehow.com/Volume-4/Vinyl-Floorcovering.html Cushioned vinyl sheet was developed in the 1960s. It features closed-cell-foam lower layers. A cushioned floor has more give and spring. Low-VOC vinyl flooring is certified by the industry group Resilient Floor Covering Institute. However, it still emits volatile organic compounds such as phenol; ventilation may not appreciably lower concentrations. Durability and sustainability See also sustainable flooring Manufacture of polyvinyl chloride involves polymerizing vinyl chloride. Vinyl chloride is a known carcinogen and has other negative health effects. Its escape into the environment is a concern. Other ingredients in vinyl flooring vary widely, and some are harmful. The thickness of the sheet and the wear layer determines the durability of the floor; unlike linoleum, vinyl flooring is usually not homogenous, and once it wears through the print layer, it will be obviously damaged. Thinner floors may also tear. While it is possible to wax or otherwise resurface vinyl floors, it is not often done. Vinyl floors can be recycled, but currently almost never are. They are landfilled rather than used as raw materials in a closed loop. Vinyl floor's life cycle environmental impact is worse than that of linoleum. Landfilled vinyl can leach phthalates (commonly added to flooring for flexibility). Incinerated vinyl produces polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), dioxins, and other toxic chemicals. It can produce polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), especially at higher temperatures. Fire risks Vinyl flooring decomposes and releases toxic gasses, mostly hydrogen chloride, long before bursting into flames. This can kill fire victims and firefighters working without a SCBA. Vinyl fires are also hard to extinguish, due to the impermeability of vinyl. Functions As it does not let water through, sheet flooring is suitable for kitchens and bathrooms. Some types can be used in wet rooms. Because the closed-cell foam backing of vinyl sheet can be varied, it can be given the resilience profile of sprung performance floor, suitable as a sports or dance floor. It can make a permanent or portable dance floor which can be laid on problematic surfaces such as concrete. Some sheet vinyl flooring can be used outside. Installation Cross-section contrasting, left, a conventional floor, center, a bathtub floor of the sort used for wetrooms, with an impermeable sheet floor sealed (in red) to an impermeable wall covering; right, a concealed bathtub floor Sheet vinyl flooring should be allowed to rest in the room it will be installed in, to avoid having to make multiple cuts as it relaxes. Any unevennesses in the subfloor will show through the sheet flooring, so they must be smoothed in advance. Bathtub floors may join the sheet flooring to the wall after bending it up the wall like skirting-board. As the vinyl is impervious, they help avoid water infiltration into the subfloor, and are most common in wetrooms. Sheet flooring may also be used with conventional skirting board, in imitation of rigid flooring. A concealed bathtub floor may be hidden behind skirting board (if the lower part of the back of the skirting board is cut away) or under a built-in cabinet. This also decreases the precision with which the sheet must be cut. The flooring may be glued down over its entire area, glued down only around the edges, or unglued, depending on the area. Depending on the size of the room and sheet, seams may need to be sealed. Vinyl flooring may also be sealed to a waterproof wall surface to make a wetroom. Hot air weld guns with plastic welding rods are often used to fix vinyl flooring in place. This is done by feeding a welding rod into the weld gun nozzle and heating the vinyl and the welding rod along the gap between two vinyl tiles. Appearance This parquet floor is fitted to the size and shape of the room. This is only possible with sheet vinyl if it is custom-printed. Vinyl sheet flooring is usually made with skeuomorphic patterns that imitate wood, stone, or tile. The texture of these materials is imitated using embossing and specific top coats; the appearance is duplicated using a print layer. Recent improvements in printing technology have made for higher-resolution images. A minority of sheet vinyl is printed with non- skeuomorphic designs; these may be drawn images resembling carpet patterns, or be photographic images such as rippled water, sand, or nebula images. Printable sheet vinyl flooring is now also available; it can be custom-printed by the manufacturer with any image file. This allows customization of the pattern to the dimensions of the room, and can include cutting lines for easy installation.

The grounds of the temple are a National Historic Site. History The Shoku Nihongi records that in 741, as the country recovered from amajor smallpox epidemic, Emperor Shōmu ordered that a monastery and convent be established in every province, the . In the late Nara period, after the establishment of a centralized government under the Ritsuryō system, the Yamato court sent a number of military expeditions to what is now the Tōhoku region of northern Japan to bring the local Emishi tribes under its control. After the establishment of Taga Castle, Yamato forces gradually pushed into the hinterland of what is now Miyagi Prefecture, establishing several fortified settlements along with several large-scale Buddhist temples. The Mutsu Kokubun-niji was located approximately 700 meter east of the Mutsu Kokubun-ji and 10 kilometers from Taga Castle. The temple claims that it was originally of the Tendai sect, and that it was destroyed in perhaps the Kamakura period, and was restored during the late Muromachi period as a monastery by the chieftain of the Kokubunji clan, a local warlord who ruled the area where the provincial temples were once located. It converted to Sōtō sect in 1570. The temple was destroyed and rebuilt on several occasions, and most of its written records have been lost; however, it enjoyed the patronage of the ruling Date clan of Sendai Domain during the Edo period. Mutsu Kokubun-niji ruins Site of the Mutsu Kokubun-niji Kondō The rebuilt temple was not located on the same site as the original temple, whose location eventually became lost. However, an earthen mound in a nearby field had long been called the \\"Kannon-zuka\\". In 1948, it was determined that this was actually the remains of the ordination platform of the original temple. In an excavation survey in 1964, the foundation stones of a 9.8 by 8.53 meter Kondō were discovered, along with a large amount of Sue ware and Haji ware pottery and roof tiles. The style of these roof tiles was identical to that of the Mutsu Kokubun-ji, leading archaeologists to conclude that the temple had been built at the same time. In a subsequent survey, a large-scale stilt pillar was found on the north side of the site of Kondō, suggesting the possibility of a Pagoda. The exact layout of the temple is unknown, but it appears to have measured 180 to 190 meters east-west width by 240 to 250 meters north-south, on a natural embankment at an altitude of about 11 meters formed by the Hirose River. A groove trace extending parallel to the west side of the estimated temple area has been found, indicating the possibility of a moat. The relics date from the late 8th century to the 10th century, and a large number of broken tiles and shards were found together in a midden, which may indicate that they were destroyed by an earthquake known to have occurred in 869 AD.

It was constructed in the early to middle Kofun period, or around the late 4th to early 5th century AD, as the tomb of one or more of the gōzoku ruling the Miyagi Plain region. The site is a National Historic Site. Overview The Tōmizuka Kofun is located on a natural embankment on the northern bank of the Hirose River at an altitude of about 10 meters, it is the fifth largest tomb in the Tōhoku region and the second largest in Miyagi prefecture after the Raijinyama Kofun. The tumulus has a total length of about 110 meters. The circular portion has a diameter of 63 meters and height of 6.5 meters. The square portion has a width of 37 meters and height of 2.5 meters. While this keyhole-shaped kofun has a characteristic shape, it is unusual is that the square front part is extremely lower than the round rear part.The tumulus is surrounded by an irregularly shaped moat with a width ranging from 10 meters to more than 40 meters in places. The surrounding area the southern Sendai Plain is noted for extensive Yayoi period remains. The kofun was excavated by the Sendai City Board of Education in 1968 and 1972, with further work conducted in 1975 in preparation for the creation of a park. No haniwa or fukiishi were discovered. The circular mound was found to contain a burial chamber with two clay sarcophagus which are presumed to have each held a bamboo-shaped wooden coffin. The number of grave goods found was extremely few for the size of the kofun, and were all found in the east sarcophagus. Only one quartz cylindrical bead, four glass balls and 18 pieces of a black- lacquered bamboo comb were excavated. Fragments of Haji ware pottery used for ritual purposes were also found. These artifacts are preserved at the Sendai City Museum. In 1947, when Japan was under American occupation, half of the circular portion of the tumulus was destroyed for dirt to expand nearby Kasuminome Air Field. Japan National Route 4 also cuts across the site diagonally, truncating one edge of the square portion of the tumulus. The site is now preserved as a public park. The site is located approximately 3.5 kilometers southeast of Sendai Station.

Moffatt; Miss Jessie (1871) Tom Hales rode many of his winners, but the rider for the 1876 Melbourne Cup was Peter St. Albans, whose real name was Bowden. One of the greatest patrons of his and his son's training stables was Herbert Power (1833–1919), for whom the Herbert Power Stakes was named. The property and stables were in March 1886 sold to John Crozier, jun. (1843–1916) of South Australia for a reputed £37,000. :After making some improvements and bringing in a few good mares, Crozier in 1890 sold St. Albans for £70,000 to W. R. Wilson, the (unrelated) Broken Hill mining magnate, who installed C. Leslie Macdonald as manager. Wilson then rented \\"Kingston estate\\" at Queenscliff, where he trained a small number of horses, including Nitre and Reaper. This stables would become the nucleus of his son James Wilson, Jr.'s stables \\"Bonny Vale\\". After his horse Blinker failed in the Victoria Derby of October 1904 Wilson and his jockey Conquest were called before the stewards and cautioned. Blinker came a good third in the Melbourne Cup a few days later, adding credence to the stewards' suspicions. Wilson then retired from racing. William Wilson (c. 1859 – 3 May 1890) was a jockey; his most notable ride was on Don Juan, which he rode to victory in the 1873 Melbourne Cup. James Wilson, Jr. (c. 1856 – 16 November 1935) also rode as a jockey, beginning on New Year's Day 1869, when, weighing and dubbed \\"Young Jim\\" Wilson, he competed at Flemington. He soon became well known, but was not of a slim build like his brother and turned to Australian rules football, playing for Geelong, which he captained in 1878 and 1879. Geelong was one of the six clubs which in 1897 broke away from in the Victorian Football Association (VFA) to found the more professional Victorian Football League (VFL). He was also a good cricketer, champion boxer and billiard player. After seeing the successes of his sons, James Wilson (senior) purchased \\"Frankfurt\\" estate for them as a racetrack. He then helped James Wilson Jr. purchase the adjoining \\"Kingston estate\\" and \\"Bonny Vale\\" at Queenscliff and achieved considerable success as a trainer of thoroughbred horses. Notable wins included: *Australian Cup: Pendil (1909) *AJC Metropolitan Handicap: Sir Andrew (1923) *Oakleigh Plate: Perspective (1926) *AJC St Leger: Sir Andrew (1923) Brimming and Monodia *VRC St Leger: Silver King (1885); Danaus (1911); Nautical (1921) For Herbert Power: *Sydney Cup: Diffidence (1899) *Melbourne Cup: Merriwee (1899) *VRC Oaks: Wilari (1911) *VRC St Leger: Wilari (1912) *Victoria Derby: Merriwee (1899), Wilari (1911) His own horses included: *Ascot Vale Stakes: Newhaven (1896) *Australian Cup: The Rover (1921), part owner *Caulfield Guineas: Ringmaster (1885); and Danaus (1910) *Caulfield Futurity Stakes: Palmer (1900) *AJC Champagne Stakes: Outlook (1918)) *Debutant Stakes: Scotland *Maribyrnong Plate: Newhaven (1895); and Philio (1910) *AJC Metropolitan Handicap: Sir Andrew (1923) *Oakleigh Plate: Perspective (1926); later sold to S.

Mackay for 5,000 guineas. *Toorak Handicap: King's Bounty (1917) *Victoria Derby: Newhaven (1896), later won 1896 Melbourne Cup trained by W. S. Hickenbotham and sent to England. Other good horses were The Quiver, Practical, and Brimming. Bobadil was a successful sire for the stud. A long-time jockey for both Wilsons was Chris Moore (c. 1864 – 3 September 1934), who was disqualified for a year after failing to start on Quiver at the Oaks Stakes (1894). Other jockeys for the Bonny Vale stables were James E. Pike, Dempsey, W. Duncan, R. Lewis, A Wilson and A. Fullarton. Strong of build and will like his father, James Wilson, Jr. was reticent, shunned publicity, and formed few friendships. He was not one to start a fight, but if provoked would not step back, and could use his fists to good effect. Like his father he could be abrupt and overbearing but on the right occasion could be relaxed and entertaining. He was declared insolvent in 1934 as a result of the Great Depression and \\"Bonny Vale\\" was sold. He died in a private hospital after some months of poor health. His remains were buried in a private ceremony at the Point Lonsdale Cemetery. Family James Wilson (26 December 1828 – November 1917) married Esther Amelia (c. 1841 – 19 February 1872). Among their children were: *Eldest daughter (Anna) Maria Wilson (c. 1853 – 14 February 1946) married Edward Rogers Sparrow (c. 1847 – 1 October 1918) on 18 April 1882 *James Wilson, Jr. (c. 1856 – 16 November 1935) married Jessie Cunningham ( – ), daughter of George Cunningham previously MLA for South Grant, on 10 December 1884.

He was born and died in London. Wilson was educated at Harrow School and at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was a successful schoolboy cricketer, playing in the Eton v Harrow match at Lord's in both 1899 and 1900, and in the second of these matches he scored 79 and 24 as a middle-order right-handed batsman and took four Etonian wickets with his right-arm slow bowling. At Cambridge, he bowled very little and won a Blue by playing as a reliable batsman in the University Match against Oxford University for three seasons from 1902 to 1904, having failed even to have a trial match in 1901. He captained the Cambridge side in 1904 and was criticised for delaying the second innings declaration so that Frederick Marsh could break the University Match record for the highest individual score, the match ending in a draw. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack wrote that the delay \\"was clearly a mistake\\" and that \\"the chance of winning the match should have outweighed all considerations of personal distinction\\", though it added that rain and missed catches also contributed to Cambridge's failure to win. Wilson was an all- round sportsman at Cambridge, winning blues for lawn tennis and rackets, and the obituary for him in The Times in 1932 stated that he had seen rackets as his principal sport, though he was unable to continue as a player because of indifferent health. After leaving Cambridge University with a Bachelor of Arts degree, he played in only one further first-class cricket match, a game for the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1906. Wilson became a schoolmaster at Rossall School in Lancashire, but did not take to the profession and became instead a sporting journalist, reporting on cricket, rackets and tennis principally, before the First World War, for the Daily Mirror, where he developed a distinctive \\"light\\" conversational style of reportage which was very popular. On the outbreak of war, he joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, later being commissioned into the Royal Fusiliers and being wounded in service. After the war, most of his journalism was for The Times and more serious in tone, and he claimed to have reported on more than 20 different sports. Wilson's son, Peter Wilson, followed him into sports journalism and was sports editor of the Daily Mirror in the 1950s and 1960s, known as \\"The Man They Can't Gag\\" for his forthright opinions; Peter Wilson's own son, Julian Wilson, was the horse-racing correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corporation.

Having successfully evaded the Allies since late 1917, the German Schutztruppe under Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck waged a guerilla campaign in Portuguese East Africa, attacking and raiding settlements as well as forts in the search of supplies while inflicting as much damage as possible on the Allies. All the while, the Schutztruppe was chased by the British King's African Rifles, which finally cornered the Germans at the village of Lioma on 30–31 August 1918. Led by George Giffard, the British forces almost managed to encircle and destroy the Schutztruppe, but in the end the Germans broke out and successfully retreated. Although greatly weakened by the fighting at Lioma, the Schutztruppe was thus able to remain active until the end of the war. Background This picture shows the terrain around Gurúè, which is similar to that of Lioma. Lioma is located in a valley, surrounded by tall hills, often with steep slopes and cliffs. At the time of the battle, the highlands around Lioma were covered by dense bush interspersed with trees, making it an extremely difficult battlefield environment. After suffering heavy casualties throughout 1917 and being unable to hold territory in German East Africa any longer, Lettow- Vorbeck decided to invade Portuguese East Africa in hopes of acquiring sufficient supplies to continue the war. In this he was successful: While the German troops were able to forage food by plundering the countryside, the Schutztruppe defeated the Portuguese colonial and metropolitan forces several times, most notably during the Battle of Ngomano, thereby capturing large quantities of weapons, ammunition and medical supplies from the enemy. Historian Gregg Adams even comments that the Portuguese became \\"the unwilling quartermasters for the Schutztruppe\\". With the Portuguese proving unable to defeat the German forces, the British had to bear the brunt of the fighting in Mozambique, and thus began to aggressively pursue Lettow-Vorbeck's small army. By August 1918, the Schutztruppe was heading north to return to German East Africa, while the British under Jacob van Deventer had begun to concentrate their forces in the area of Regone and Lioma in an attempt to encircle their enemy. Though Lettow-Vorbeck had received intel about the British plans, his forces were once again in dire need of supplies and Regone harbored a large supply depot. As result, the German commander planned a quick assault against the vulnerable village in order to capture as many supplies as possible: Speed was crucial for this plan, as Lettow-Vorbeck would have to outrace the British before they could reinforce Regone or catch up with him. Rough terrain, rain and fog hindered and delayed the Schutztruppe, however, so that when it reached Regone on 26 August, the British had already fortified and reinforced it. At this point, the Germans could only have taken Regone by a prolonged siege for which they had no time, so that Lettow-Vorbeck chose to call off the attack. His forces bypassed Regone and instead began to march to Lioma, another supply depot. Unknown to the Germans, a British battalion (1/1st KAR) already managed to reinforce the village on 28 August, while two other battalions also force-marched toward Lioma. Between the British forces at Regone and the units that gathered at Lioma the Schutztruppe would be trapped, and if everything went according to van Deventer's plans, destroyed. While British skirmishers harassed the approaching German forces, the 1/1st KAR under Maj Alexander Charles Masters dug in at Lioma: They formed a square defensive perimeter south of the village, and three small platoon outposts were also set up west, east and south of the British positions. Thus prepared, the Lioma garrison waited for the Schutztruppe, which would arrive in the area on 30 August.  Opposing forces   Germans  Schutztruppe askaris and carriers late into the war, when there was little uniformity left among the depleted and exhausted German forces, who had make do with whatever equipment, clothing and supplies they could capture. By 1918, the once strong Schutztruppe, which had successfully resisted the allies for four years, was much depleted and exhausted. Of its peak strength of around 15,000 soldiers in 1916 just about 1,600 were left. Many African as well as European soldiers had deserted or surrendered as the allies overran their home areas in German East Africa, wages were no longer paid, and life in the army became harder and more brutal. Many of the soldiers also became unfit for combat due to the extreme food shortages and disease under which the Schutztruppe suffered. Driven from their territory and unable to regularly recruit or train new soldiers, manpower shortages among the common soldiers were severe, while officers and NCOs became irreplaceable. This was particularly problematic because the Schutztruppe's ability to continue to function as coherent, effective fighting force largely rested upon its experienced and capable leadership. Nevertheless, most of the black soldiers who had already served since before the war were still staunchly loyal to Lettow-Vorbeck by 1918, with their fighting spirit and morale remaining largely unshaken. Even though they suffered from exhaustion, poor supplies, hunger, excessive heat or cold, and an increasingly experienced and stubborn opponent in form of the King's African Rifles during the fighting in Portuguese East Africa, these core cadres refused to give up – be it out of loyalty to their comrades, economic self-interest, desire for revenge, or sheer will to survive. Battle-hardened, experienced in mobile bush-warfare, and possessed by a strong esprit de corps after years of warfare, they still constituted a force to be reckoned with. Lettow-Vorbeck himself would judge after the Battle of Lioma that his men had fought \\"brilliantly\\" in face of the odds. Willpower alone could not substitute for adequate supplies and reinforcements, however, so that the Schutztruppe's effective combat power had still much declined by 1918, and the Germans could no longer meet strong enemy formations head-on without risking their own destruction.  British  King's African Rifles soldiers rest near Mssindyi, German East Africa, September 1917. The British soldiers that faced the Schutztruppe at Lioma were part of the King's African Rifles (KAR), a long neglected branch of the British colonial forces. Having proven themselves to be among the most effective opponents of the Schutztruppe, the KAR were drastically expanded, strengthened and reorganized after 1915. Their tactics and strategies were adapted to the mobile German bush warfare, and better equipment and weaponry was given to the British askaris. Unlike the Germans, whose supply and recruitment prospects deteriorated as the war went on, the KAR could replenish its ranks. The massive expansion of the KAR meant, however, that most of its troops were fresh recruits and thus inferior in experience to the hardened Schutztruppe. At Lioma, for example, the 1/1st KAR mostly consisted of recent recruits from Nyasaland (modern-day Malawi) formed around a cadre of veterans. Furthermore, the extremely poor quality or non- existence of roads in Mozambique greatly hindered the supply of the large numbers of KAR soldiers who chased the small Schutztruppe. As result, both British white officers as well as askaris had to live off the land and often were, just like their German counterparts, near starvation. In one case, when \\"the officers and men [of one unit] were inspected at the end of their stint in the field they were described as resembling the victims of famine. Their experience of the hardships of war in East Africa was typical, not exceptional.\\" Despite these adverse conditions, the British native soldiers generally proved themselves to be tenacious and very capable fighters, motivated by a variety of reasons, most of them rooted in traditional African concepts of loyalty and their comparable high wages. The white and black officers and NCOs of the King's African Rifles also led by example and like their Schutztruppe counterparts suffered heavy losses, though unlike the Germans the British could relatively quickly replace them. New British white officers often could not speak Swahili (the regional lingua franca), however, hindering communications with their men. One of the most important British commanders during the operations in Mozambique was Lt-Col George Giffard; leading a brigade (K.A.R. 2nd Col. or \\"KARTUCOL\\") specifically to find and destroy Lettow-Vorbeck's remaining troops, he was highly regarded by both his own forces and respected by the Germans. His troops would relieve the Lioma garrison on the battle's second day. Battle Engagement at Lioma (30 August) Dense bush such as seen here greatly hindered visibility at Lioma and concealed enemies, thus making it necessary for the 1/1st KAR to set up vulnerable outposts and sent out scouts in order to prevent the Schutztruppe from surprising them. The Schutztruppe arrived at area surrounding Lioma on 30 August. The British forces at Lioma had noticed the German approach hours before the latter's arrival, and thus could strengthen their defenses accordingly. Indeed, as the German columns (Abteilungen, short: Abt) advanced on the village, one of the relief units, namely 3/2nd KAR under Lt-Col Charles George Phillips, arrived around 12.00 and deployed north-east of 1/1st main position at Lioma. While the newly arrived battalion was deploying, the Schutztruppe's vanguard, formed by Abt Müller, encountered a detached platoon of 1/1 KAR east of Lioma, resulting in a first skirmish, whereupon the leading soldiers of Abt Müller retreated southwards. When Lettow-Vorbeck learned of this firefight, he incorrectly assessed that the British had not yet fortified their positions due to the minimal defenses of the encountered forward outpost. Believing that the enemy positions were still vulnerable, he consequently ordered Abt Göring and Abt Müller to flank 1/1st KAR's main position, while Abt Poppe was sent against and overran the British outpost around 14.30. An attempt by the British to relief the detached platoon failed, though Hptm. Poppe was seriously wounded during the British counter-attack. As result of the German encirclement movement, communication between 1/1st and 3/2nd KAR was severed. Around 16.30, the Germans launched their determined attack on 1/1st KAR's main position with around 1,000 men and 30 machine guns. The assault began with Abt Müller attacking from the east and north, followed by Abt Poppe from the south. At the same time, 3/2nd KAR launched a number of counter-attacks against the Germans, capturing Abt Müller's baggage and reserve ammunition, and blocking Abt Göring's attempt to also flank 1/1st KAR. Unable to advance further, Hptm. Karl Göring consequently ordered part of his force to oppose 3/2nd KAR, while the rest charged 1/1 KAR's western perimeter. The vigorous, unnerving German attacks scattered 1/1 KAR's carriers and caused many casualties, among them several senior officers of the battalion killed or wounded, including Major Masters, who had to be replaced by Captain Stanley Conway John as commanding officer of 1/1 KAR. Nevertheless, the 1/1st KAR's askari held firm and reportedly displayed \\"excellent\\" shooting. One small German group actually succeeded in breaking into the northwestern corner of the British defensive square, but they were quickly killed. The Schutztruppe continued its attacks until 22.30, when the mounting casualties among his troops led Göring to the conclusion that a continued engagement was futile, whereupon he ordered a withdrawal. The German units subsequently retreated south to rejoin the rest of their forces. Escape of the Schutztruppe (31 August) Lieutenant colonel George Giffard, whose attempt to encircle and destroy the Schutztruppe were hindered by the terrain and reluctance of 1/2nd KAR to press the attack. In course of the following night, Lettow-Vorbeck came to the conclusion that his forces had to escape Lioma toward the east; he knew that the Schutztruppe needed a respite and that more enemy units were converging on his position. On the other side, 2/2nd KAR had reached Lioma, while 1/2nd KAR was closing in on the Nalume River crossing to the village's east; thus, by early 31 August, three British battalions were in the vicinity of Lioma, with a fourth marching to blockade the most important eastern escape route. Lt-Col Giffard, who had arrived with 2/2nd KAR and now took command over all present British forces, consequently saw a good opportunity to finally encircle and crush the Schutztruppe. The German forces began to move northeast towards the Lioma-Muanhupa road at 9.00 on 31 August, after regrouping during the night. In order to speed up their advance, they left behind seriously wounded and sick Schutztruppe personnel as well as prisoners. These were later captured by the British. The German vanguard was once again formed by the columns of Müller and Göring, the main body was led by Gen. Maj. Kurt Wahle, while Hptm. Stemmermann was left in charge of the rearguard. Lettow-Vorbeck would freely move through the force to oversee its advance and take command wherever he was most needed. Even though they sent out patrols to learn about the Schutztruppe's location throughout the night, the British only received reports about Lettow-Vorbeck's movement at 10.00. Thereupon Giffard ordered 2/2nd KAR and half of 3/2nd KAR to move eastwards, and 1/2nd KAR to march west in order to engage and encircle the German forces between them. 1/1st KAR, badly shaken by the previous day's fighting, was to remain at Lioma to guard the British baggage and reserve ammunition, while the other half of 3/2nd KAR was held as mobile reserve. Two companies of 2/2nd KAR came up against the German vanguard's flank on the Lioma-Muanhupa road around 12.00, immediately starting a stubborn, but stagnant firefight with Abt Müller and Abt Göring. Other elements of the 2/2nd and 3/2nd KAR attempted to flank this vanguard and attack the German main body in order to scatter its carriers and capture its supplies, which would have meant a heavy logistical blow for the Schutztruppe. Well covered by the bush and the rugged hills, however, the German main body evaded the British to the west and managed to move eastwards along the road, and then on a trail into the northern hills. After encountering 2/2nd and 3/2nd KAR, Lettow-Vorbeck initially assumed that he could possibly destroy them with a determined counter-attack using all his forces; this plan was dropped, however, when it became clear that the German main body had already too far advanced northwards to be called back for an assault. Meanwhile, unknown to the Germans, 1/2nd KAR marched southwest along the Lioma-Muanhupa road, and encountered parts of the Schutztruppe's rearguard by 14.30. Completely surprising the defenders, 1/2nd KAR managed to overrun a whole enemy field hospital largely unopposed. Hindered in its advance only by a few snipers, 1/2nd KAR then moved into the northern hills, where the German main body and the remaining rearguard were located, and promptly came under machine gun fire. This only briefly halted the King's African Rifles soldiers, and overall the German rearguard offered only light resistance to 1/2nd KAR until it was forced to retreat northwards in disorder around 15.00. The Schutztruppe on the march. Difficult terrain such as seen here could greatly hinder effective operations, as it was the case at Lioma. While this was happening, Lettow-Vorbeck had already ordered his western units to retreat after Hptm. Göring was wounded. Having lost several officers and NCOs on the battle's first day, he could simply risk no more casualties among them. As there was almost no communication possible between the different detachments due to the problematic terrain, Lettow-Vorbeck noticed the attack on his rearguard units only when he had begun to ascend the northern hills with the withdrawing Abt Göring and Abt Müller. By then it had become too late for the German commander to make contact with or aid the now beleaguered forces of Stemmermann and Wahle. That the Germans did not suffered more casualties among their rearguard was thanks to the false reports of captured German askaris, who massively exaggerated the Schutztruppe's remaining strength when being questioned by 1/2nd KAR. Thus discouraged, the latter stopped its pursuit of the Germans, regrouped, and only resumed to cautiously advance at 16.00. The British forces coming from the east and west finally met around 17.00, by which all German units had managed to successfully escape northwards. Due to the difficult terrain, however, the communications between the retreating Schutztruppe forces had \\"become hopelessly muddled\\" and order had also largely broken down: The western vanguard units, attempting to climb the steep northern granite hills, had become lost, while the situation among the main body was also chaotic. Only late into the night was Lettow-Vorbeck, who was still with Abt Müller and Abt Göring, able to reestablish contact and eventually reunite with the main body under Wahle. One German detachment under Hptm. Köhl even became so completely lost that it was only able to reunite with the rest of the Schutztruppe after several days.  Aftermath  Captured Schutztruppe soldiers wait for their rations at a prisoner-of-war camp. The Germans suffered heavy casualties at Lioma, though Lettow-Vorbeck's force nevertheless remained active. While the British had failed to finally crush the Schutztruppe, they had inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans, though the actual number of losses is disputed. Lettow-Vorbeck claimed that he had lost 29 killed, 27 wounded, 34 missing, and 5 captured, while British claims are around 222 killed, missing or captured, of whom 22–26 were Whites. These differences may stem from the Germans not counting non-combatants such as medical personnel as casualties. Regardless of the exact numbers, several of the Schutztruppe's irreplacable senior officers and NCOs were killed, captured or wounded, which was a heavy blow. The Germans had also failed in taking Lioma and thus could not replenish their supplies; instead, they had lost 50,000 rounds of ammunition, crucial medical stores, and around 200 carriers, who had been scattered in course of the battle. Miller judged that \\"the Germans had been more than bruised at Lioma; but for the almost total disorder and confusion [on both sides] that marked the two-day action, they would have been wiped out.\\" Edward Paice calls the battle of Lioma a \\"narrow escape\\" for the Germans. Taken together with their casualties during the Battle of Pere Hills, another \\"near thing\\" soon after Lioma, Lettow-Vorbeck's forces lost 15% of their combat strength. Many of those wounded at Lioma did not recover enough to be combat-ready again; among them was Göring. Furthermore, a lung epidemic broke out among the Schutztruppe in September 1918, further reducing the Germans' manpower and undermining their morale. Many of the surviving white Germans increasingly began to question Lettow-Vorbeck's intention to continue fighting for what they perceived as lost cause. Nevertheless, the Schutztruppe did not surrender, and resumed their march northwards. After Pere Hills, it travelled the remaining distance to German East Africa largely unopposed, and would, albeit greatly reduced in strength and numbers, continue to stay in action until the end of the war. For the British, Lioma had been \\"the best chance [...] to inflict a decisive defeat upon the Schutztruppe\\". Lt-Col Giffard subsequently attributed the failure to encircle the Germans to the difficult communications between the British units and the missing information about enemy troop movements, this being \\"the difficulty which is always the same in the Bush of getting information accurately and quickly\\". The British casualties at Lioma were mostly unreported; it is only known that 1/1st KAR suffered 32 killed, 59 wounded, and 15 missing. After the battle four Distinguished Conduct Medals were awarded to European, and seven African Distinguished Conduct Medals to African soldiers of the 1/1st and 1/2nd KAR for gallantry, while the Distinguished Service Order was awarded to the commanders of 1/1st KAR (Alexander Charles Masters), 1/2 KAR (Edward Beckford Bevan) and 3/2 KAR (Charles George Phillips).

Later, at the age of 13, he was taught by a neighbor how to play guitar. After that, Denis stopped playing the bayan, which he studied at the music school, and began to write his songs. In parallel with guitar lessons, he learned how to play the piano by himself, visited the poetic and theatrical circles in the Balakovo House of Culture, sang in the vocal-instrumental ensemble. In 1992, at the age of 16, he got third place at a city competition of variety art with a performance of his own song. Because of this, Maidanov was among the young performers of the studio \\"MUZ-A\\" in the city's House of Creativity and in parallel became songwriter of the soloists repertoire. He has consistently worked in the House of Creativity as head of the VIA, methodologist and head of the \\"Club of High School Students\\". At school Denis was successful, but after nine classes he was forced to drop out and enter a chemical technical college because of financial reasons. While studying at the technical school, the future artist decided to enter the Moscow State Art and Cultural University (MGUKI); for this, he studied at the evening school in parallel with the technical school with the intention to receive a certificate a year earlier before the official deadline. In 1995, when he succeeded, Denis entered the correspondence department of MGUKI in the specialty \\"Manager- director of show programs\\"; At admission he had significant competition – 72 people for 6 seats. In MGUKI he studied directing and acting.Официальный сайт Дениса Майданова In parallel to his studies Denis Maidanov worked; first at a car-wash, then his mother managed to arrange him a job as a repairman-fitter at the Syzran oil refinery. Despite the good salary, Denis left the factory after a year of work, realizing that this is not his profession. Also during this period he directed the VIA and theater studio in the Balakovo House of Creativity; There was a recording studio which Denis used to record his first songs and for subsequently selling them to local Volga musicians. In 1999, Denis Maidanov graduated from MGUKI. Then he became director of the Musical Theater and the head of the music department of the House of Creativity of the city of Balakovo. In 2001, he moved from Balakovo to Moscow for permanent residence. Career in Moscow In 2001, Denis Maidanov came to Moscow, starting to work there as a composer-songwriter for Russian performers. In the initial period of his life in Moscow he lived with friends with whom he studied at the Moscow State University of Culture and Arts. Over the next two years, due to the lack of permanent earnings, Denis changed 15 places of residence; at times he had to spend the night at the station and in the metro. The first significant earnings (150 US dollars) he received in the same year from producer Yuri Aizenshpis for writing the lyrics of the song \\"Behind the Fog\\" for singer Sasha Gradiva. Subsequently, this song became winner of the \\"Song of the Year 2002\\" festival, bringing Denis Maidanov his first musical award. Gradually Maidanov received recognition, and many Russian artists began singing his songs, in particular, Nikolai Baskov, Filipp Kirkorov, Turetsky Choir Art Group, Alexander Buinov, Mikhail Shufutinsky, Aleksandr Marshal, Lolita Milyavskaya, Jasmin, Joseph Kobzon, Tatiana Bulanova. He also wrote a number of songs and soundtracks for a number of Russian films and serials. In 2008 Denis switched from writing songs for other performers to recording and performing his own songs. After he wrote the song \\"This radio is Avtoradio\\" which the president of AvtoRadio Alexander Varin commissioned, Varin, having listened to the recording of Denis's solo songs, invited him to put the song \\"Eternal Love\\" on the air, insisting that Maidanov should start his own performing career. After about six months, the song entered the rotation of other radio stations, and later Maidanov received the Golden Gramophone for it. \\"Eternal Love\\" was the artist's first hit, and still remains among his most famous songs.Денис Майданов: Мы с Москвой долго мучили друг друга — Собеседник«Вечная любовь» Дениса Майданова - Аргументы и Факты In June 2009, Denis released his first album \\"I'll Know That You Love Me ...

While working at the Beatrix Hospital in Gorinchem, the Netherlands, he pioneered surgical laparoscopy and was the first worldwide to perform an appendectomy assisted by laparoscopy in 1975. Henk de Kok was the youngest of a large family in the Netherlands and the 4th doctor among his siblings. His older brother, dr J.J.M de Kok (1919-1994) was both a surgeon as well as a gynecologist at the Amphia Hospital in Oosterhout. He had learnt the use of the laparoscopic procedure in Paris from the groundbreaking gynecologist Professor Raoul PalmerRaoul_Palmer (1904-1985). As a medical doctor in training, Henk regularly came to visit his older brother during his residency and was allowed to assist in operations. Henk became fascinated by the potential use of the procedure for other purposes besides gynecology. Settinglin in as surgeon in 1971 at the Beatrix hospital in Gorinchem, he initially started using the laparoscopy to inspect patients with unexplained abdominal complaints and/or take biopsies. However, following four years of research, he performed his first laparoscopic appendectomy in 1975. During the next two years, dr de Kok developed a new surgical method that was a minimally invasive procedure, leading to considerable less scaring, performing his procedure successfully on 30 patients. While the procedure was new, Dr de Kok's largest research work evolved around the question of when an appendix should be removed. Following classic theory, the appendix would only be removed when it was about to be ruptured or had ruptured. Dr de Kok's theory was that the appendix was often the cause of patients suffering from severe bouts of abdominal pain, even if the appendix had not yet ruptured and could be taken out pro-actively. His first publication describing his theory around the appendix as well as the use of the laparoscopy during surgery was published in a Dutch academic journal in 1977appendectomy. Another well known doctor, the gynecologist Dr Kurt Semm Kurt_Semm (1927-2003), also performed an early laparoscopic appendix and published his findings in 1980.

During the rest of his medical career, dr de Kok continued to research his theory, publish articles  including in the controversial and non-peer reviewed Medical Hypotheses  and speak at conferences, most notably the International Laparoscopy Congress in Miami, USA, (Feb 1981) to popularise the use of laparoscopy in surgical practice.

In the meantime, Roman, who can not understand why Katya does not answer any of his letters (all of Katya's letters are intercepted her grandmother), calls Tatyana Nikolaevna. She mistakes him for Mikhail (Leonid Filatov), her lover with whom she had a falling-out, and tells him never to call again. Pained and uncertain, Roman accidentally overhears a telephone conversation between his grandmother and his mother, and finds out the truth: the grandmother is not sick at all, and all of this is merely an act to prevent him from seeing Katya any more. Shocked by the betrayal of those close to him, Roman locks himself in his room. The grandmother tries to reach him. Roman looks out his window and sees Katya, who has come to Leningrad. Roman tries to leave the room, but his grandmother tries to keep him from Katya and her \\"vicious\\" family. Roman opens the window and calls to Katya; but he slips on the windowsill and breaks the frame, and falls to the ground. His fall is mitigated by a snowdrift. Katya runs to him and tries to help him stand, but in the end they fall back together into the snow. They are watched by two children, a boy and a girl.

Description Their bodies are 3.5 centimetres long. They have long hind legs and antennae and their total length is 25 centimetres. Males have large spines (fused setae) on their antennae. The adult female is distinguished from the male by having a slightly curved, scimitar-like ovipositor that extends from the rare of her abdomen and is almost as long as her body. They are a chocolate-brown colour with paler back edges to their segments that give them a banded appearance. Taxonomy P. acanthoceras are closely related to P. waipuense and P. waitomoense and they could be treated as a single species. Cook et al. (2010) follow W.F. Kirby (1906) and Karny (1937) in treating Pachyrhamma as a neuter noun, and thus use a neuter suffix for the species name, i.e. acanthoceras rather than acanthocera.

Life Keen was born in the northern London borough of Finchley in late 1938, and spent his early years under the Blitz during World War II, during which his father, a former grocer, served in the Signal corps. He left school at 16 before finishing his secondary school education, and was trained in stained glass craftsmanship and lithography at Hornsey School of Art. He practiced his trade, primarily as an art restorer, in Norwich for a decade, In the late 1960s he decided he preferred a different career direction, completed his secondary schooling, and, in 1970, enrolled in a course of anthropology at University College London, studying under Mary Douglas. He graduated with a B.Sc in 1973. During his undergraduate years, he undertook some fieldwork in the Jura. His initial intention was to pursue work in the field of Oceania studies, possibly in Indonesia. Just at that time, Derek Freeman had delegated Nicolas Peterson to organize a post-graduate research scholarship for work on Aboriginal religion as evinced in song symbolism among men in northern Australia, particularly in Arnhem Land. Keen proved successful in his application, and he began his fieldwork by setting up camp at Milingimbi in September 1974, where he stayed for 14 months, and followed it up with a 10-month stint at Nanggalala on the mainland. He learnt Djambarrpuyŋu at Milingimbi while focusing his research on the nexus between kinship, social organisation and religious rituals. Particularly with regard to ceremonial rites, his first year of intense fieldwork on the island yielded a rich harvest of over 100 hours of recordings of mortuary song cycles. Before returning to Canberra, he spent a month at Oenpelli assisting the Northern Land Council in mapping out the aboriginal landscape in order to prepare an indigenous report perspective for the Fox Inquiry on uranium mining in the area. This marked the beginning of many contributions Keen would make in subsequent years to the cause of Aboriginal land rights. Keen completed his doctoral dissertation, 'One Ceremony, One Song', in 1978, and obtained his PdD the following year. He took up a teaching appointment at the University of Queensland and, after several years, returned to the ANU for a post as senior lecturer in 1987. The following year he edited a volume of essays Being Black(1988) whose quality Nicolas Peterson, writing in 2015, stated was 'yet to be surpassed.' He spent the academic year 1992-1993 at Oxford University and, in 2000, was a visiting professor at the National Museum of Ethnology in Osaka. Keen retired to Harold's Cross in 2002 but continues to be active in the field. Evaluations While one reviewer of his 1994 monograph Knowledge and Secrecy in an Aboriginal Religion, had the impression Keen's approach echoed that of Meyer Fortes, for P. G. Toner, Keen's work creatively took on board elements of the heterodox approach in Australian anthropology associated with the name of Les Hiatt.

With their new album 'Melancholy Disco', Witchingseason continue to explore the balance between lo-fi and high-energy alt-rock, with the hypnotic vocals of Reynolds. Their first EP 'Celosia', attracted critical success, with airplay on BBC Radio 1's Daniel P Carters Rock Show, DAB station Planet Rock and their debut music video on UK 'Scuzz TV'. Since their formation, Witchingseason have released 5 singles, an eponymous EP and Celosia (along with a music video for their hit single 'The Healer'), and more recently their debut studio album; Melancholy Disco. Witchingseason broke into the mainstream in 2017, with Metal Talk describing the band as (having a) \\"...macabre and ethereal low-fi sludgy sound...\\" and their album Celosia as \\"...a wealth of rocking talent, gasoline drenched guitars and doom sensibilities which are all beautifully demonstrated in the track 'Celosia' and the hypnotic blues rock of 'Codeine'. Heavy and impressive guitar riffs are teamed with fierce drum beats and all stitched together with Tom Reynolds' coarse and captivating vocals.\\" The band's self- released singles and EP's have sold thousands worldwide, with Grande Rock saying of Witchingseason \\"It's not hard to see how this sound can make an impact, its immediacy speaks for itself and is the reason why not too long ago the band were able to play a huge live show at the prestigious 100 Club in London.\\" Their debut album 'Melancholy Disco', preceded by singles 'Melancholy Disco' and 'Afraid of the Dark' were released in November 2018 to positive critical reviews.  History   Formation and first EP (2014–2016)  Witchingseason was formed in Essex in 2014 by guitarist/vocalist Tom Reynolds and bassist James R Willians, who then recruited drummer Wayne Summers to form the hard rock trio. They cite their influences as artists such as Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, Queens of the Stone Age and Masters of Reality, forging their own grungy, gritty, psychedelia-tinged alt.rock sound. Following the departure of James L Willians in 2015, Jack Turner (formerly of Leogun) joined the band, lending his signature 'weaving bass' into the mix. In 2017, blues bassist Gary Summers joined the group, replacing Jack Turner, and in 2018 Brendan Stone Leak added a second guitar and keyboards leading to the band's ethereal apocalyptic sound. Known for their hard work and intimidating live performances, the first few singles and self-titled EP garnered some positive reviews, but it wasn't until their singles 'Spiders' and 'Codeine' and then the EP 'Celosia' that Witchingseason attracted critical interest.  Celosia (2016–2017)  With their first, self-released full EP; Celosia, Witchingseason received much critical praise and a renewed interest in the band. This led to some national press coverage and radio / TV play of the album's single; The 'Healer'.  Melancholy Disco (2018)  Witchingseasons first, self-released full studio album; Melancholy Disco, featuring previously released singles 'Melancholy Disco' and 'Afraid of the Dark' (for which there was an accompanying music video).  Phantom Transmission (2018)  Recording 'Melancholy Disco' at Tom Donovan (of Monster Florence) Studio, the band recorded additional 'Bootleg-style' live studio video recordings to accompany the album. Typically deliberately over-mastered, the resulting videos showcases the band's talent for twisting their otherwise mainstream rock sound to produce an eerie, ethereal and apocalyptic feel that gives them their unique identity.  Live (2014–2018)  The band began touring small to medium venues in 2015 and soon received notable attention from the press and media due to their energetic and intimidating live performances and soon began to gain a quickly growing fan base. This led to Witchingseason playing prestigious venues such as the 100 Club in London and supporting acts like StoneWire on their tour. The band have aligned themselves with a number of charitable organisations, such as Musicians Against Homelessness, Safe Gigs for Women, and OxJam (for which they played the Camden Festival in 2017). Staunch supporters of live music in and around the Camden area, Witchingseason have played a number of events for Camden Rocks Presents, including the 2017 festival (Headlined by Maximo Park and Public Image Limited) and the run up to the 2018 festival. With a love for playing live, Witchingseason continue to play live shows throughout the UK, currently promoting their debut studio album 'Melancholy Disco'.

It sought to award a license for the construction and operation of a casino in York County, Maine by a qualified entity as spelled out in the proposed law, with tax revenue generated by the casino to go to specific programs. The wording of the proposed law effectively permitted only one company, Capital 7, to be awarded the license. The ballot measure was defeated, with 83% of voters opposing it. The effort to put the question on the ballot generated controversy due to how the petition drive and campaign for the casino were funded and conducted, as well as the fact that the casino would have effectively not been given out by a competitive process. The campaign committees supporting the question had record fines levied against them from authorities related to violations of Maine campaign finance law. Background An initial effort to place a referendum for a York County casino on the ballot for November 2016 failed after Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap announced on March 2, 2016 that only 36,000 of the 91,000 signatures turned in were valid, when roughly 61,000 were required. 36,000 signatures were rejected because the signature of the petition circulators on the petitions did not match the signature on file. 19,000 more were invalidated because they did not belong to registered voters. Horseracing Jobs Fairness, the group supporting the proposal, sued Dunlap to get the signatures reinstated, but the suit was rejected. The signature gathering effort was criticized by several state and local officials for alleged misleading claims by signature gatherers, such as one in Bangor telling potential signers that it would \\"help uplift the spirits of the people of Bangor\\" when York County is over 120 miles from Bangor. Dunlap's office received several complaints about false claims by petition gatherers, but said there was nothing they could do as false claims are constitutionally protected free speech, and that it was the responsibility of the signer to ask about the proposal. Those collecting signatures in the 2016 effort were offered $10 a signature, compared to a 2014 effort to ban bear baiting while hunting, which offered $2 a signature. Horseracing Jobs Fairness then resumed gathering signatures and submitted 65,000 more in December 2016, with Dunlap validating 53,000 of them on January 23, 2017, which when combined with previously validated signatures was enough to place the question on the November 2017 ballot. Dunlap announced the final wording of the question that will appear on the ballot on September 7, 2017. It will read, \\"Do you want to allow a certain company to operate table games and/or slot machines in York County, subject to state and local approval, with part of the profits going to the specific programs described in the initiative?\\". The proposal was criticized for limiting applicants for the license to \\"an entity that owned in 2003 at least 51 percent of an entity licensed to operate a commercial track in Penobscot County\\". The only entity that meets that criterion is Capital 7, which is largely owned by developer Shawn Scott. Though the company must be given the license, it can be sold after it is obtained. Shawn Scott did this in 2003 after convincing Maine voters to authorize the opening of the Hollywood Casino Bangor, selling it to Penn National Gaming. Until April 2017, Shawn's sister Lisa Scott appeared as the sole funder of the campaign. After the Maine Ethics Commission began an investigation of the campaign, Lisa revealed that most of the money comes from both domestic and offshore investment firms connected to Shawn. The investigation revealed that $4 million was spent just to get the question on the ballot. Lisa stepped down from the campaign at the end of August 2017, stating that she did not want to be a distraction from the campaign. Ethics commission fines On November 3, 2017, the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices voted in a series of 4-1 votes to levy fines totaling $500,000 against the four ballot question committees involved in the campaign for Question 1. The fines were related to violations of Maine's campaign finance disclosure laws from those committees and Lisa Scott, being what the commission called a pattern of evasion in disclosing who was funding the campaign. One commissioner said that there seemed to have been an effort to conceal the involvement of Shawn Scott in the funding of the campaign. The amount of the fines was a record for the commission, being almost 10 times that of the previous record, though it was not the maximum permitted by law. Members of the commission who voted for the high fines said that believed a law passed by voters in 2015 required the steeper fines, and they wished to send a message that the public has a right to know where money for campaigns comes from. The one commissioner who voted against the fines, Bradford Pattenshall, stated that the felt the high fines were \\"grossly disproportionate\\" to the offenses and did not see the violations as nefarious. Lawyers representing Lisa Scott and the campaign committees have said the fines were excessive and that the Commission had \\"put its thumb on the scale\\" for the upcoming vote. They pledged to appeal the fines in court. The Commission also voted 5-0 that a campaign committee led by Shawn Scott was only a donor to the other committees, and as such did not need to register as a political action committee. A spokesperson for Shawn, former Maine Attorney General Andrew Ketterer, said that Shawn had been \\"vindicated\\" and that the ruling was proof he had complied with the spirit and letter of the law. Campaign By September 15th, 2017, no formal opposition to the proposal had emerged, and no television advertising had been purchased in Maine's media markets regarding the question. Supporters released a TV ad on September 27th. Opponents, organizing under the name A Bad Deal for Maine PAC, launched a website the week of October 7th. Supporters have spent $1.55 million on their campaign, as well as incurring $1 million in debt, according to their October 5th campaign finance report. The only contribution listed on the October 5th finance report of opponents was $30,000 on a poll funded by Churchill Downs Incorporated, which owns the Oxford Casino in Oxford County. Shawn Scott began to take a higher profile as the election approached, appearing in advertisements, holding news conferences, and representing the campaign at debates.

History Ryn Castle is a late fortress built by the Teutonic Order. The fortress was built in the place of a former, smaller stronghold, as ordered by the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order Winrich von Kniprode in c. 1377, to serve as a convent and a headquarters for launching attacks against the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to its east. In 1410, after the Teutonic defeat at the Battle of Grunwald, the castle's fortifications were dismantled, limited to one Gothic building in the eastern part of the castle-complex. At the onset of the Thirteen Years' War, in 1455, the castle was occupied by local peasants, later recovered by George von Schlieben, whom massacred the peasants in front of the castle at the Battle of Ryn. In 1525, the castle became the residence of the Duke of Royal Prussia. During the Deluge, in 1657, the castle was burned down by Tatars. By the beginning of the nineteenth-century, the castle was a private residence. After being bought back, in 1853, the Prussian authorities reutilised it into a prison. The castle burned down in 1881. After 1945, the castle was adapted to serve as a community centre, a small museum and the municipal council. After 1990, the town authorities sold the property to a private person, that adapted it into a four-star hotel (Hotel Zamek Ryn****).

The Lingnan School () of painting, also called the Cantonese School, is a style of painting from the Guangdong or Lingnan region of China.Croizier, R. C. (1988). Art and Revolution in Modern Japan the Lingnan (Cantonese) school of painting, 1906-1951 (Vol. 29). Univ of California Press. This school reflects a style of painting founded in the 19th century in Guangdong province by Two Gaos and one Chen - Gao Jianfu, Gao Qifeng and Chen Shuren, also known as \\"The three greats of Lingnan\\" (). The Lingnan style of painting was revolutionary and innovative compared to traditional Chinese painting, influenced by Western European visual arts and by the early Qing painter, Yun Shouping (1633–1690). In the late 19th century, scholars in China broke through entrenched conservative thoughts and began to actively seek to create and promote new schools and styles of art. This not only cultivated a large amount of ideological progress among social elites but also gave birth to the \\"eclectic fusion of the Han Chinese and Western style, ancient and modern\\" Lingnan school. The Lingnan school advocates the introduction of Western painting styles with the integration of Han Chinese and Western paintings, in the spirit of revolution of Oriental arts, while maintaining traditional Han Chinese painting techniques. This school of painting enjoys considerable fame among Han Chinese peoples. Along with Cantonese opera and Cantonese music, they are known as the \\"three fineries of Lingnan\\" (Jyutping: Ling5 Naam4 Saam1 Sau3; Traditional Chinese: 嶺南三秀). Meanwhile, the Lingnan school is listed along with Beijing and Tianjin painting school and Shanghai school as the three pillars of modern Chinese painting. Name The term \\"Lingnan School\\" was not coined by Lingnan painters. During their era, Gao Jianfu, Gao Qifeng and Chen Shuren, with their bold and innovative style, were given the title of \\"The Three Greats of Lingnan.\\" This contributed to the formation of the name \\"Lingnan school\\". However, Chan expressed his dissatisfaction with the title \\"Lingnan school\\" as he felt that it suggested that the school was merely regional and that it did not reflect the absorption of overseas styles and the idealism of innovation in Han Chinese paintings. Gao Jianfu never used the name \\"Lingnan school of painting,\\" and would rather call it \\"eclectic.\\" \\"Lingnan painting\\" refers to the work of painters in the Guangdong province in general. Techniques According to Wang Lipu's view, Lingnan school is characterized by: #Blank space focus: Lingnan paintings, in line with traditional Han Chinese painting styles, are focused on the \\"presence of both the real and the surreal\\", and \\"paying attention to the places without ink\\" - inheriting the traditional techniques of ink wash paintings. #Strokes focus: Lingnan school's strokes are complex and anti-tradition, with the goal of achieving magnificence and vividness. #Bright coloring: Influenced by impressionism, Lingnan paintings focus on the light performance. Most of the colors are very bright, in stark contrast to the traditional ink wash painting, which in turn is pale, stressing \\"With paleness comes the soul of pens and ink\\". #Rendering of background colors: Since the Tang dynasty poet- artist Wang Wei put forward the idea that ink wash was superior,唐，王维，《山水诀》：“夫画道之中，水墨最为上，肇自然之性，成造化之功” In general, Han Chinese painting styles focus on the use of ink wash and abstain from coloring. Lingnan school does the opposite.
