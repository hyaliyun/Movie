Almost all boys were boarders. The school was founded to prepare pupils for a career as officers in the armed services, many of them going on to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, or the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. History The college was founded in 1874. Its first headmaster, Cormell Price, was a housemaster at Haileybury College and took twelve Haileybury boys with him to the new school.Brian Gardner, The Public Schools: an historical survey (Hamilton, 1973), p. 188 USC suffered financial difficulties and closed in 1903. Its boys were ultimately absorbed by St Mark‚Äôs School, Windsor in 1906. That was soon renamed as ‚ÄúImperial Service College‚Äú and itself merged with Haileybury College in 1942. As at virtually all boys' schools of its era, corporal punishment (strokes of the cane) was used, but USC was very unusual in that the cane was applied to the student's upper back (as described by Kipling) rather than the buttocks.

He was also a member of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC). A self- described \\"communist/socialist\\", he was a leading figure in the No to EU ‚Äì Yes to Democracy campaign. Crow joined London Transport in 1977 and soon became involved in trade unionism. He was regarded as part of the Awkward Squad, a loose grouping of left-wing union leaders who came to power in a series of electoral victories beginning in 2002.According to Oliver Morgan in The Observer, 17 February 2002: \\"Crow's is the demeanour of a growing number of radical leaders in their forties who see little point in being nicely turned out and moderate merely to keep in power a party that ignores the interests of their members\\". After he became leader, the RMT's membership increased from around 57,000 in 2002 to more than 80,000 in 2008, making it one of Britain's fastest-growing trade unions.Bob Crow: workers' friend?, BBC, 5 September 2007 Crow was a polarising figure in British politics. Supporters praised him as a champion of the working class and a successful trade unionist; critics argued that he held London to ransom with strikes.  Early life  Born at 162 Burrow Road, Epping, Essex to Lillian (n√©e Hutton) and George Crow; his background was working-class, a fact of which he remained proud throughout his life. Crow's father was a docker who taught him to read both the Morning Star and the Financial Times, but to disbelieve everything in the latter. His father also was a lifelong member of the Transport and General Workers Union. His family subsequently moved to Hainault. He left school at 16 and joined London Transport, there becoming involved in union politics. His first job was making the tea, then he worked as part of a tree-felling group in 1977, before moving onto heavy track repairing. In 1983, he was elected as a local representative to the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) and in 1985 became NUR national officer for track workers. During his formative years, the British trade union movement was dominated by such prominent figures as Jack Jones, Hugh Scanlon, Joe Gormley, and Len Murray. As a result, he commented that \\"Starting my career with these people in charge of unions, and working in a nationalised industry with people who had put in 30 or even 40 years of service helped shape my views.\\"  Trade union career and politics  In 1990 the National Union of Railwaymen merged with the National Union of Seamen to form the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT), and the following year Crow became the London Underground representative on the National Executive. In 1991, he became assistant general secretary, and on 14 February 2002 Crow was elected by the membership to succeed Jimmy Knapp as general secretary. He received 12,051 votes in the election ‚Äì nearly twice as many as the other two candidates put together (Phil Bialyk received 4,512 votes and Ray Spry-Shute received 1,997). Six weeks earlier on 1 January 2002, Crow was attacked outside his home by two men wielding an iron bar.BBC News, Rail union leader attacked, 4 January 2002 He speculated that he was the victim of hired employer muscle,Arriving now, Comrade Bob , Observer, 17 February 2002 although it is possible that the culprits were members of far right activist groups who were active in Dagenham at the time. Crow was a member of the General Council of the Trade Union Congress. From 2006 until his death he was a member of the Executive Board of the International Transport Workers Federation, the global trade union for transport workers. Under Bob Crow's leadership, the RMT affiliated to the World Federation of Trade Unions and he was regularly invited to attend, in his capacity as general secretary of the RMT, the presidential council of the WFTU. At the time he became general secretary, he had a strong negotiating position as the industry was booming, and was the leader of one of the only British trade unions which still wielded industrial strength. =Communist Party and Socialist Labour Party= Crow identified as a \\"communist/socialist\\", and between 1983 and 1997, was a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain and then the Communist Party of Britain. He described his political philosophy with a quote from Argentine Marxist‚ÄìLeninist revolutionary Che Guevara: \\"Hasta la victoria siempre!\\" (\\"Forever onwards until the victory!\\"). He kept a bust of communist leader Vladimir Lenin in his office. He described the aims of a trade-unionist as to secure \\"Job security, being safe, best possible pay, best possible conditions, decent pensions, and a world that lives in peace.\\" In 1997 he briefly joined Arthur Scargill's Socialist Labour Party (SLP), and was always a strong supporter of Scargill for his commitment to trade unionism. Crow rejected the argument that Scargill was responsible for the defeats of the miners and the union movement more generally. Crow was a founding member of the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition for several years up until his death. Previously he gave his support to the now disbanded Socialist Alliance, and believed all socialist parties should unite. In the 2005 general election, he endorsed Robert Griffiths, the Communist Party of Britain candidate in Pontypridd, calling him \\"a champion of workers' rights\\".What future for unions? (2005 interview) Griffiths went on to win 233 votes (0.6%), coming last out of the six candidates. In the 2010 Local Election, he publicly supported the directly elected Mayoral candidate in the London Borough of Hackney Monty Goldman and the candidate for Leabridge Ward Mick Carty. =Campaign for a New Workers' Party= Crow was an outspoken critic of Tony Blair, who \\"squandered a massive landslide from an electorate hungry for change, poured billions of public pounds into private pockets and accelerated the growing gap between rich and poor\\". He deemed the policies implemented by Blair's New Labour project to be \\"near enough identical\\" to those of the Conservatives. Speaking at the founding conference of the National Shop Stewards Network in July 2007, Crow called for a new party for the working class. =RMT industrial action= After Transport for London offered workers an inflation-adjusted pay rise, Crow described TfL's approach to pay as \\"confrontational\\". In response to the RMT declaring a 48-hour strike on 10 June 2009, Crow wrote in The Guardian Comment is free section the purpose of the move: \\"On London Underground, bosses are threatening to tear up an agreement aimed at safeguarding jobs, and have refused to rule out compulsory redundancies. Up to 4,000 jobs are at risk as part of a multibillion-pound cuts package that can be traced directly back to the collapse of Metronet and the failure of the PPP.\\" \\"RMT have made it clear we expect managers to abide by the existing job security agreements and we would simply not be doing our job as a union if we allowed the tube to treat our members as cannon fodder who can be hired and fired at will\\", adding that \\"It wasn't our members who created the downturn and we will not be bullied into accepting that they should be forced to pay for an economic crisis that was cooked up by the bankers and the politicians.\\" Rail managers recognised Crow as a moderate within the RMT; he faced calls from figures to the left of him who were more eager to use industrial action. He was also criticised by RMT members on the right of his position; Crow repeatedly championed the cause of the lowest-paid workers, such as cleaners, whose jobs were often outsourced to separate companies. Sectors of the more highly-paid RMT membership were critical of Crow for this support, believing it inefficient. =No to EU ‚Äì Yes to Democracy= In March 2009, Crow announced that the RMT would be fronting the No to EU ‚Äì Yes to Democracy platform with an array of socialist organisations and individuals for the 2009 European Parliament elections. No2EU ‚Äì Yes to Democracy stood for a Europe of \\"independent, democratic states that value its public services and does not offer them to profiteers; a Europe that guarantees the rights of workers and does not put the interests of big business above that of ordinary people\\". As the party leader and lead candidate in London, Crow was \\"not against workers coming into the country\\", unlike other Eurosceptic groupings, but he was against \\"two workers from different countries competing against each other on different rates of pay\\" and added that \\"Our main role will be out there among working people, giving them our support and helping to save their industries from privatisation\\". No2EU secured 153,236 votes, compared to an RMT membership of 80,000. The party achieved 1% of the popular vote in Britain, giving them the 12th largest share of the vote, behind Scargill's Socialist Labour Party and the far-right British National Party. This was insufficient for a seat in the European Parliament. In London, where Crow was a candidate, the party secured 17,758 votes, equating to the tenth largest share of the vote. In this region, No2EU secured a larger share of the popular vote than the Socialist Labour Party. =Accusations of cronyism= Critics within his own union suggested he was filling posts with \\"henchmen\\". Crow insisted that the appointment of his wife as chief executive of the RMT credit union was legitimate as she was the only applicant for the position, and he had interviewed her for the role. =Accusations of champagne socialism= Political opponents and sections of the press frequently offered criticism of Crow for what they described as a lavish lifestyle which they consider to be inconsistent with his socialist credentials. The total employment costs figure of ¬£145k was frequently mentioned by the press as \\"wages\\" or \\"salary\\". It was pointed by a journalist for the Independent that the correct figure for salary was around ¬£96,000, and this was also mentioned by Crow in interview. According to the latest figures available from the Trades Union Certification Officer, as of 2012 Bob Crow's basic salary at the RMT was ¬£89,805. The union also paid ¬£10,313 of National Insurance contributions to the state and ¬£34,429 into his pension pot in 2012. No car or chauffeur was provided. Crow responded to the criticisms by claiming \\"I'm worth it\\". In an article commenting on his contribution to the RMT union, the Telegraph agreed that it was a merited figure for Crow who \\"represented the interests of his members with a single-minded determination\\". The newspaper concluded Crow \\"wanted the best deal for the people who paid his salary ‚Äì and they continued to reward him because he delivered it.\\". =Final years: 2010‚Äì14= Crow faced increasing media scrutiny. He was criticised in April 2013 after the death of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher when he stated: \\"As far as I'm concerned she can rot in Hell.\\" In January 2014 Crow went on a three-week luxury cruise holiday from Bermuda to Brazil. Paparazzi photographed him on Copacabana Beach, although in his response to press he asked \\"What do you want me to do? Sit under a tree and read Karl Marx all day?\\". When a Daily Mirror reporter asked him if he felt sorry for commuters, he responded: \\"Course I feel sorry for them. But they know our fight isn't with them. It's with Transport for London. And what do they expect a trade union to do? If you join one you expect it to fight for your rights and your job ‚Äì and that's what I'm doing.\\" Crow died in the early hours of 11 March 2014 at Whipps Cross University Hospital after suffering an aneurysm and heart attack.  Personal life  On one hand, Crow was known for his robust political views and macho interests: described by George Eaton of the New Statesman as \\"an apologist for Stalinism\\", he also wished the UK to withdraw from the European Union. Since childhood, he had supported Millwall Football Club, and as RMT leader he kept a photograph of the club on the wall of his office. He was known to be a fan of boxing, and in an interview from 2011, claimed to work out six days a week, and be able to bench-press one hundred and twenty kilos (265 lb). He also had a pet Staffordshire bull terrier whom he named Castro after the Cuban Marxist‚ÄìLeninist leader Fidel Castro. On the other hand, those who got to know Crow saw much more subtle aspects to his character: The Guardian described Crow as having \\"a very keen brain and strong emotional intelligence\\", while The New York Times deemed him to be both \\"confrontational and charismatic\\" and \\"sharp and shrewd\\". Crow took a keen interest in the weather and owned a barometer, informing press that if he had not become a trade unionist then he would have liked to have become a weather man. Despite the many portrayals as a radical socialist Crow was rather seen to be very pragmatic in outlook, and was described as \\"too shrewd for doctrine\\". Although believing that it was morally right to punish murder by capital punishment, he did not support the death penalty in practice, claiming too little faith in the criminal justice system. Similarly, he claimed that he would happily support the Conservative Party if by doing so he could achieve the renationalisation of the railways. Crow's marriage to Geraldine Horan, on 12 June 1982, by whom he had a daughter, Kerrie-Anne, and two grandsons, Daniel and Jamie Atlee, ended in divorce. He later entered a long-term relationship with Nicola Hoarau, with whom he had another daughter, Tanya. Writing in the New Statesman, George Eaton thought Crow to have been \\"more hurt than most realise by the press intrusion into his private life\\". Crow had a distinctive south-east accent described variously as Cockney or soft-spoken Essex. In later life, he lived in a three-bedroom council house in Woodford Green, eastern Greater London, but some newspapers criticised him for doing so whilst receiving a high salary. He defended his actions, asserting that \\"I was born in a council house, as far as I'm concerned I will die in one.\\" Although Crow frequently played up to the extreme leftist caricature of himself created by the press, in particular describing bankers as greedy \\"spivs\\", he was once asked by a journalist from the Financial Times how he would feel if his children had chosen careers in banking: in response he pointed out that he was happy for them to live their lives, and revealed that his brother was a stockbroker but that he was more concerned about the fact his brother supported Arsenal F.C.. In 2011, lawyers acting for Crow wrote to the Metropolitan Police asking for any evidence or information that they may have uncovered in respect of the News International phone hacking scandal. Crow had suspicions that \\"journalists may have had access to private information about my movements and my union's activities that date back to the year 2000\\". Legacy After Crow's death, the former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone stated that \\"The only working-class people who still have well-paid jobs in London are [RMT] members\\" Crow had a polarising effect in British politics, becoming \\"the left's favourite firebrand and the right's favourite villain.\\" To supporters, he was a working-class hero who successfully stood up for the rights of RMT members. Deemed highly successful in his job, during his leadership of the RMT, membership rose from 59,000 to 78,000, while London tube drivers' pay rose to ¬£52,000, nearly twice the national average wage. Discussing Crow's contribution, former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone noted that \\"The only working-class people who still have well-paid jobs in London are [RMT] members\\". The Guardian asserted that he \\"managed to popularise the cause of trade unions at a time of declining membership and increasing hostility\\". BBC News commented that he had managed to become \\"one of the UK's best-known characters at a time when the rest of the nation's trade union movement had faded into comparative obscurity\\". However, Crow was regularly criticised by both the right and the centre-left. Critics saw him as a bully who improved the status of RMT workers at the expense of commuters. The Daily Express deemed him a \\"champagne socialist\\" for his lavish lifestyle. Following Crow's death, tributes were offered by figures from the trade union movement. TUC Secretary-General Frances O'Grady called him \\"an outstanding trade unionist, who tirelessly fought for his members, his industry and the wider trade union movement\\". Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, stated that Crow \\"was admired by his members and feared by employers, which is exactly how he liked it... It was a privilege to campaign and fight alongside him because he never gave an inch.\\" Tributes were also offered by politicians on the political left. Livingstone asserted that the RMT leader was \\"broadly right on most key issues\\" and that \\"He fought really hard for his members.\\" Leader of the Labour Party Ed Miliband commented that \\"I didn't always agree with him politically but I always respected his tireless commitment to fighting for the men and women in his union. He did what he was elected to do, was not afraid of controversy and was always out supporting his members across the country.\\" A poster marking Crow's death placed at Bethnal Green tube station.His death also drew responses from the political right. Conservative Mayor of London Boris Johnson stated: \\"I'm shocked. Bob Crow was a fighter and a man of character... Whatever our political differences, and there were many, this is tragic news... Bob fought tirelessly for his beliefs and for his members. There can be absolutely no doubt that he played a big part in the success of the Tube, and he shared my goal to make transport in London an even greater success.\\" A spokesman speaking for Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron commented that \\"The Prime Minister expresses his sincere condolences to Mr Crow's family and friends.\\" Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party, tweeted to express his sadness at Crow's death, commenting that \\"I liked him\\" and that he had found common ground over their mutual anti- EU sentiment. On his death, management at Transport for London placed posters marking his death at tube stations throughout London as a mark of respect. =Bob Crow Brigade= The Bob Crow Brigade is a group of volunteers from the UK and the Republic of Ireland fighting as part of the International Freedom Battalion (IFB). The IFB consists of leftist foreign volunteers fighting alongside the People's Protection Units in the Syrian Civil War in support of the Rojava Revolution and against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The group has expressed solidarity with the RMT and striking rail workers in the UK. Steve Hedley, senior assistant general secretary of the RMT, said: \\"Bob would have been honoured that young people from Britain would fight the forces of evil in his name. A great admirer of the international brigades that fought in Spain, Crow would of course have drawn the parallels with the new international brigades fighting clerical fascism and defending Yazhidi, Muslim and Christian workers from slavery and persecution.\\" References External links * BBC profile * The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) * \\"Rail union leader praises communist 'workers' champion'\\" *Obituary of Bob Crow in Socialist Worker * Biography of Bob Crow by Gregor Gall - Bob Crow: Socialist, leader, fighter - A political biography =News items= * Bob Crow: You Ask The Questions The Independent, 29 June 2009 * Independent article September 2007 1961 births 2014 deaths Communist Party of Britain members Communist Party of Great Britain members English communists English trade unionists General Secretaries of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers Members of the General Council of the Trades Union Congress People from Hainault People from Shadwell Socialist Labour Party (UK) members ","title":"Bob Crow"},{"id":"244657","text":"William Russell (born 23 August 1947) is an English dramatist, lyricist and composer.

The word may sometimes be used as a metonym, to refer to the entire food item served on a skewer, as in \\"chicken skewers\\". Skewers are used while grilling or roasting meats and fish, and in other culinary applications. In English, brochette is a borrowing of the French word for skewer. In cookery, en brochette means 'on a skewer', and describes the form of a dish or the method of cooking and serving pieces of food, especially grilled meat or seafood, on skewers; for example \\"lamb cubes en brochette\\". Skewers are often used in a variety of kebab dishes.  Utensil  Metal skewers are typically stainless steel rods with a pointed tip on one end and a grip of some kind on the other end for ease of removing the food. Non-metallic skewers are often made from bamboo, as well as hardwoods such as birch, beech, or other suitable wood. Prior to grilling, wooden skewers may be soaked in water to avoid burning. A related device is the rotisserie or spit, a large rod that rotates meat while it cooks.  History  Pair of Minoan firedogs, 17th century BCE. Evidence of the prehistoric use of skewers, as far back as the Lower Paleolithic, has been found at a 300,000-year-old site in Sch√∂ningen, Germany. A stick with a burnt tip was found to have been used to cook meat over a fire. Excavations of the Minoan settlement of Akrotiri unearthed stone \\"fire dogs\\" used before the 17th century BCE. In these supports there are pairs of indentations that may have been used for holding skewers.To Vima (in Greek), 6-2-2011 (picture 2 of 7) Homer in Iliad (1.465) mentions pieces of meat roasted on spits (·ΩÄŒ≤ŒµŒªœåœÇ). In Classical Greece, a small spit or skewer was known as ·ΩÄŒ≤ŒµŒªŒØœÉŒ∫ŒøœÇ (obeliskos),·ΩÄŒ≤ŒµŒªŒØœÉŒ∫ŒøœÇ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus, dim. of ·ΩÄŒ≤ŒµŒªœåœÇ (obelos), ·ΩÄŒ≤ŒµŒªœåœÇ. and Aristophanes mentions such skewers being used to roast thrushes.Acharnians 1007 The story is often told of medieval Middle Eastern soldiers - usually Turkish or Persian, depending on the storyteller - who cooked meat skewered on their swords. One of the most well-known skewered foods around the world is the shish kebab. The earliest literary evidence for the Turkish word (shish) as a food utensil comes from the 11th-century Diwan Lughat al-Turk, attributed to Mahmud of Kashgar. He defines shish as both a skewer and 'tool for arranging noodles' (minzam tutmaj), though he is unique in this regard as all subsequent known historical references to shish define it as a skewer.  Examples of skewered foods  =Kebab= A large variety of dishes cooked on skewers are kebabs (meat dishes prevalent in Middle Eastern cuisine and the Muslim world), or derived from them. Examples include Turkish shish kebab, Iranian jujeh kabab, Chinese chuan, and Southeast Asian satay. The Greek souvlaki is also part of this heritage. However, \\"kebab\\" is not synonymous with \\"skewered food\\", and many kebab dishes such as chapli kebab are not cooked on skewers. On the other hand, English speakers may sometimes use the word kebab to refer to any food on a skewer. =Other= Dishes, other than kebabs, prepared with skewers include American city chicken and corn dog, Brazilian churrasco, indigenous Peruvian anticucho, Italian arrosticini, Japanese kushiyaki and kushikatsu, Korean jeok and kkochi, Nepali sekuwa, Portuguese espetada, Vietnamese nem n∆∞·ªõng and ch·∫°o t√¥m, and Chinese shaokao. Appetizers and hors d'oeuvres may often be skewered together with small sticks or toothpicks; the Spanish pincho is named after such a skewer. Small, often decorative, skewers of glass, metal, wood or bamboo known as olive picks or cocktail sticks are used for garnishes on cocktails and other alcoholic beverages. Many types of snack food, such as candy apples, bananacue, ginanggang, elote, and tanghulu, are sold and served \\"on a stick\\" or skewer, especially at outdoor markets, fairs, and sidewalk or roadside stands around the world.

It is considered a classic of the Harlem Renaissance, and it is likely Hurston's best known work. The novel explores main character Janie Crawford's \\"ripening from a vibrant, but voiceless, teenage girl into a woman with her finger on the trigger of her own destiny\\".National Endowment for the Arts website. Set in central and southern Florida in the early 20th century, the novel was initially poorly received. Since the late 20th century, it has been regarded as influential to both African-American literature and women's literature.Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Zora Neale Hurston: Critical Perspectives Past and Present (New York: Amistad, 1993), p. xi. TIME included the novel in its 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923. Plot synopsis Janie Crawford, an African-American woman in her forties, recounts her life starting with her sexual awakening, which she compares to a blossoming pear tree kissed by bees in spring. Around this time, Janie allows a local boy, Johnny Taylor, to kiss her, which Janie's grandmother, Nanny, witnesses. As a young slave woman, Nanny was raped by her white owner, then gave birth to a mixed-race daughter she named Leafy. Though Nanny wanted a better life for her daughter and even escaped her jealous mistress after the American Civil War, Leafy was later raped by her school teacher and became pregnant with Janie. Shortly after Janie's birth, Leafy began to drink and stay out at night, eventually running away and leaving Janie with Nanny. Nanny, having transferred her hopes for stability and opportunity from Leafy to Janie, arranges for Janie to marry Logan Killicks, an older farmer looking for a wife. However, Killicks doesn't love Janie and wants only a domestic helper rather than a lover or partner; he thinks she doesn't do enough around the farm and considers her ungrateful. When Janie speaks to Nanny about her desire for love, Nanny, too, accuses Janie of being spoiled and, soon afterwards, dies. Unhappy, disillusioned, and lonely, Janie leaves Killicks and runs off with Jody (Joe) Starks, a glib man who takes her to the all-black community of Eatonville, Florida. Starks arranges to buy more land, establishes a general store, and is soon elected mayor of the town. However, Janie soon realizes that Starks wants her as a trophy wife to reinforce his powerful position in town and to run the store, even forbidding her from taking part in the town's social life. During their twenty-year marriage, he treats her as his property, criticizing her, controlling her, and physically abusing her. Finally, when Starks's kidney begins to fail, Janie says that he never knew her because he would not let her be free. After Starks dies, Janie becomes financially independent through his estate. Though she is beset with suitors, including men of means, she turns them all down until she meets a young drifter and gambler named Vergible Woods, known as \\"Tea Cake\\". He plays the guitar for her and initially treats her with kindness and respect. Janie is hesitant because she is older and wealthy, but she eventually falls in love with him and decides to run away with him to Jacksonville to marry. They move to Belle Glade, in the northern part of the Everglades region (\\"the muck\\"), where they find work planting and harvesting beans. While their relationship is volatile and sometimes violent, Janie finally has the marriage with love that she wanted. Her image of the pear tree blossom is revived. Suddenly, the area is hit by the great 1928 Okeechobee hurricane. Tea Cake is bitten by a rabid dog while saving Janie from drowning and becomes increasingly jealous and unpredictable. When he tries to shoot Janie with his pistol, she fatally shoots him with a rifle in self-defense and is charged with murder. At the trial, Tea Cake's black male friends show up to oppose her, but a group of local white women arrive to support Janie. After the all-white jury acquits Janie, she gives Tea Cake a lavish funeral. Tea Cake's friends forgive her, asking her to remain in the Everglades. However, she decides to return to Eatonville. As she expected, the residents gossip about her when she returns to town. The story ends where it started, as Janie finishes recounting her life to Pheoby.  Themes  = Gender roles = The novel explores traditional gender roles and the relationship between men and women. Nanny believes that Janie should marry a man not for love but for \\"protection\\". Janie's first two husbands, Logan Killicks and Jody Starks, both believe Janie should be defined by her marriage to them. Both men want her to be domesticated and silent. Her speech, or silence, is defined by her physical locations, most often. For example, Starks forces her silence at the store, a public‚Äîand therefore, male space at the time. He says, \\"... Muh wife don't know nothin' bout no speech-makin'. Ah never married her for nothin' lak dat. She's ah woman[,] and her place is in de home.\\" Janie is also forbidden from socializing with the townspeople on the porch. Tea Cake is Janie's last husband, who treats her as more of an equal than Killicks and Starks did, by talking to her and playing checkers with her. Despite this, Tea Cake does hit Janie to show his possession over her. Thus, Janie's life seems defined by her relation to domineering males. = Masculinity and femininity = Scholars argue that, in Their Eyes Were Watching God, the role of masculinity is portrayed through the subordination and objectification of women. In a reflection of post-slavery Florida, black men are subordinate only to their white employers and adhere to white patriarchal institutions of masculinity in which women are held in a positive social regard only if they are attractive, are married, or have attained financial security via previous marriages. Black women, specifically, face greater oppression, as their own struggle for independence was considered counter-productive to the greater fight for equality for black Americans as a whole. Nanny explains this hierarchical structure early on to Janie when she says, \\"Honey, de white man is de ruler of everything...white man throw down the load and tell de nigger man to pick it up. He picks it up because he has to, but he doesn't tote it. He hands it to his womenfolks.\\" In other words, it would say that blacks were dealing with the oppression from the white people since white was viewed as \\"superior\\". In the book, men view women as an object to pursue, acquire, and control through courting, manipulation, and even physical force. Janie's journey for the discovery of her self-identity and independence is depicted through her pursuit of true love‚Äîher dream‚Äîthrough marriages to three different men. Each of the men she marries conforms in some way to gender norms of the day. The role of femininity is portrayed through the symbolism of property, mules, and elements in nature. Women in the book are considered a trophy prize for males, to simply look pretty and obey their husbands. The analogy of the Mule and Women is stated repetitively in the book and is used to represent the gender role of women. Janie's Nanny explained to Janie at a young age how African- American women were objectified as mules. \\"De nigger woman is de mule uh de world so far as Ah can see.\\" Mules are typically bought and sold by farmers, usually to be used to work until exhaustion. Later in the book, Janie realizes that Nanny's warnings were true when she identifies with an abused mule in Eatonville. She sees herself as a working animal with no voice, there for the amusement of others and at the expense of her own free will. This identification is shown in the book when the townspeople are laughing at the mule that Jody had eventually bought and rescued (in an attempt to manipulate Janie). However, Janie doesn't laugh alongside the townspeople as she is shown to empathize with the mule (\\"Everybody was having fun at the mule-baiting. All but Janie\\") and she feels disgusted by the situation. The mule represents the feminine gender role in the story by which men suppress and degrade women who are stereotyped as unable to think for themselves and needing constant guidance from men. These stereotypes \\"become a chain on the American women, preventing them from developing individuality, and from pursuing their personal happiness\\" and ultimately what forces them to mold into their gender role.  Janie Crawford  Janie Crawford is the main character of Their Eyes Were Watching God. At the beginning of the story, she is described as naive, beautiful, and energetic. However, as the story progresses, Janie is constantly under the influence and pressure of gender norms within her romantic relationships. As she navigates each of her relationships with men, Janie ultimately loses her confidence and self-image, conforming to roles that the husbands want her to fill. In Janie's first relationship, she was given as a wife by Nanny at an early age and was told that love may come with marriage but that it was not important. However, as time passed, Janie was unable to love Logan. \\"She began to cry. 'Ah wants things sweet wid mah marriage lak when you sit under a pear tree and think.'\\" As time passed on, Logan began forcing gender roles onto Janie, telling her that he would buy a mule for her so that she could work. However, Janie was strong-minded and Logan made little progress on changing Janie. Janie raised her voice, but still, she remained susceptible to suppression and abuse. \\"You ain't got no particular place. It's wherever Ah need yuh. Git a move on yuh, and dat quck.\\" Then, in Janie's second relationship, she left Logan Killicks in an attempt to pursue a better future with her new husband, Joe Starks. Joe was the Mayor of Eatonville and achieved incredible wealth, placing Janie in a higher status than her peers, since she was \\"sleeping with authority, seating in a higher chair\\". Janie believed that her life would change for the better. However, she was confined in the roles of a housewife and was made to be Joe's prized possession. \\"The king's mule, and the king's pleasure is everything she is there for, nothing else\\". In Janie's third and last relationship, she was able to experience true love, on her own terms, with her third husband Vergible \\"Tea Cake\\" Woods. Janie was older than Tea Cake by nearly twelve years. He loved and treated her better than her previous husbands. While she was no longer strictly confined by the gender roles placed upon her by her previous husbands, she was still easily influenced and manipulated by Tea Cake. Janie was forced to shoot and kill Tea Cake in self defense after he developed rabies.  Logan Killicks  Logan Killicks is Janie's first husband. Shortly after Nanny observes Janie sharing her first kiss with boy named Johnny Taylor‚Äîand therefore showing signs of puberty‚Äîshe informs Janie that she was promised to Logan Killicks, a widower, from a young age for her own well-being and protection. Logan owns a farm with 60 acres of land. He grows and sells potatoes as well as chops and delivers wood. He has one mule to plow the fields and decides that he needs to add another to the stable. Though Janie hopes that it will grow, there is never any gentleness or love between her and Logan. She is 15 or 16 years old when she is married off to Logan and later, she grows to resent her grandmother for selling her off, like a slave. Their marriage is purely based on logic, work and convenience‚Äî he is a man with property and he needs a wife while Nanny is an aging woman raising her grandchild alone, and she needs to secure Janie's future. There is little regard for Janie's happiness as Nanny believes Logan to be a good husband based on his financial prospects alone. Logan has traditional views on marriage. He believes that a man should be married to a woman, be his property, and work hard. Everyone contributes to tending the family land. He believes Janie should work well from dawn to dusk, in the field as well as the house, and do as she is told. She is analogous to a mule or other working animal. He is not an attractive man by Janie's description of him and seems to be aware of this. As such, his prospects at finding a mate based on attraction and his age are slim, thus the reason for approaching Nanny early on about an arrangement of marriage to Janie when she comes of age. During the course of their brief marriage, Logan attempts to subjugate Janie with his words and attempts to make her work beyond the gender roles in a typical marriage. He does not appreciate her streaks of independence when she refuses his commands and he uses her family history to try to manipulate her into being submissive to him. At one point, he threatens to kill her for her insubordination in a desperate and final attempt to control her.  Joe \\"Jody\\" Starks  Joe \\"Jody\\" Starks is Janie's second husband. He is charismatic, charming and has big plans for his future. Janie, being young and naive, is easily seduced by his efforts to convince her to leave Logan. Ultimately, Joe is successful in gaining Janie's trust and so she joins him on his journey. Joe views Janie as a princess or royalty to be displayed on a pedestal. Because of her youth, inexperience, and desire to find true love, Jody easily controls and manipulates her into submitting to his male authority. Joe Starks is a man who is strong, organized and a natural leader. He has money from his time working for white men and he now aims to settle in a new community made up of African-Americans, a place in its infancy where he can make a name for himself. Joe quickly establishes himself as an authoritative figure around the town which has no determined name or governance of any kind when he and Janie arrive. With the money he has, he buys land, organizes the townsfolk, becomes the owner-operator of the general store and post office, and is eventually named Mayor of Eatonville. Joe strives for equality with white men, particularly the mayor of the white town across the river from Eatonville. To attain this status he requires nice things: the largest white house, a nice desk and chair, a gilded spitoon, and a beautiful wife. He is a larger-than-life character and during their time in Eatonville, he has grown an equally large belly and taken up the habit of chewing nice cigars, both of which cement his status with the locals as an important man around town. Joe, like most of the men in the book, believes that women are incapable of thinking and caring for themselves. He likens them to children and livestock that need constant tending and direction. ‚ÄúSomebody‚Äôs got to think for the women and chillen and chickens and cows. God, they sho don't think none fo themselves.‚Äù Jody is a jealous man, and because of this he grows more and more possessive and controlling of Janie. He expects her to dress a certain way (buying her the finest of clothes, with tight corsets) and requires that she wear her long, beautiful hair‚Äîsymbolic of her free spirit and femininity‚Äî covered and up in a bun, so as not to attract too much unwanted attention from the other men in Eatonville. He considers her long hair to be for his enjoyment alone. He excludes her from various events and the social gatherings in Eatonville to further his dominance and control over her. He restricts her from being friendly with the other townswomen, requiring her to behave in a separate and superior manner.  Vergible \\"Tea Cake\\" Woods  Tea Cake is Janie's third and final husband. He is her ideal partner in her search for true love. He is charismatic, charming, funny, and creative with a tendency to embellish stories. To Janie, he is larger than life, wise, and genuinely cares for her. Tea Cake is loving towards Janie and respectful of her as her own individual person. Unlike her previous two marriages, Tea Cake never stops trying to make her happy. He is more than willing to share with her what he has learned from his own experiences and show her the greater world outside of her own existence. He enjoys being with Janie and playing the role of a teacher. Through Tea Cake, Janie learns to shoot a rifle, play checkers, and fish among other activities. However, Tea Cake shows tendencies of patriarchal dominance and psychological abuse towards Janie. He isn't always truthful with her and shows some of the same characteristic traits exhibited by Joe Starks and Logan Killicks. For instance, he keeps her from working with the rest of the people down on the muck because he believes she is above common folk. Consequently, until Janie asserts herself with Tea Cake and joins the others in working, she gains a bit of a reputation for thinking herself better than everyone else. In a show of male dominance in their relationship, Tea Cake takes $200 from Janie without her knowledge or permission and spends it on a nice guitar and a lavish party with others around town without including her in the festivities. While accounting for his spending of her money, he tells Janie that he had to pay women that he deemed unattractive $2 each to keep them from the party. He then gambles the remaining amount to make the money back and excludes her from the gambling scene. What differentiates him from Joe in this regard is that Janie regularly confronts him and he acquiesces to her demand that she not be excluded from aspects of his life. Another tendency that Tea Cake shares with Joe is his jealousy and need to maintain some amount of control over Janie. When he overhears another woman speaking poorly to Janie about Tea Cake and attempting to set her up with her brother, Tea Cake decides to take matters into his own hands. First, he discusses with Janie, a conversation he overheard between her and Mrs. Turner, a local caf√© owner. He criticizes Mrs. Turner's appearance (like Janie, she is mixed-race) and then successfully executes an elaborate plan to ruin her establishment. Finally, he slaps Janie around in front of Mrs. Turner and others to show them that he is in charge and to assert his ownership over her. In the end, Tea Cake plays the role of hero to Janie when he saves her from drowning and being attacked by a rabid dog. Tea Cake himself is bitten and eventually succumbs to the disease. Not able to think rationally and enraged with jealousy, he physically attacks Janie and she is forced to shoot and kill Tea Cake. Therefore, she effectively ends her emotional attachment to the men in her life and the desire to seek out and realize her dream of true love. = Liberated woman = Janie is searching for her own voice and identity throughout the novel. She is often without a voice in relation to her husbands as she will not fight back. Janie is also faced with situations that make her feel that her value as an African- American woman is little to none. She is seen as distinct from other women in the novel, who follow traditions and do not find a life independent of men. Janie's physical appeal becomes a basis of Starks and Tea Cake to have jealousy and belittle her looks. Starks orders Janie to cover her long hair as other men are attracted to it. Similarly, Tea Cake remarks on Janie's lighter skin and her appeal to Mrs. Turner's brother. But Janie begins to feel liberated in her marriage with Tea Cake because he treats her as an equal and mostly does not look down on her. As a result, she loves him more than she did the other two spouses. Janie does not find complete independence as a woman until after the death of Tea Cake. She returns to Eatonville with her hair down and she sits on her own porch chatting with her friend Pheoby. By the end of the novel, she has overcome traditional roles and cultivates an image of the \\"liberated black woman.\\"  Liberation from racial history  Janie grew up under the care of her grandmother, Nanny. Her experiences as a slave and freedwoman shaped the way Nanny saw the world. She hoped to protect Janie, by forcing her to marry Logan Killicks, although he was older and not attractive. Janie followed her grandmother's advice but found that it wouldn't be as easy to love him as Nanny had suggested. African Americans believed in marriage during the early 20th century because they had been prevented from such legal protection under slavery. Unhappy in her marriage to Logan, Janie runs off with Starks and commits bigamy. After the death of Starks, Janie meets Tea Cake and they fall in love. Her community thought he was a broke nobody and were suspicious of him. Tea Cake wasn't the perfect man, but better than expected by the community of Eatonville.  Liberation from domestic violence  During the early 20th century, the African-American community asked African-American women to set aside self-realization and self- affirmation values. They imposed male-dominated values and often controlled who women married. Janie suffered domestic violence in her marriages with Joe Starks and Tea Cake. Starks initially seemed to be good for Janie, but later beat her several times, in an effort to exert his authority over her. Despite her husband's physical and emotional abuse, Janie did not complain, behavior that was approved by the townsmen. Domestic abuse was not entirely disapproved by the African-American community, and men thought it was acceptable to control their women this way.Patterson, Tiffany Ruby (2005). Zora Neale Hurston : And A History Of Southern Life. Philadelphia: Temple University Press. . After Starks' death, Janie was freed from his abuse. Tea Cake showed his respect of her.McGowan, Todd (1999). \\"Liberation and Domination: Their Eyes Were Watching God and the Evolution of Capitalism\\". MELUS. 24: 109‚Äì128. Although Tea Cake was not a perfect husband, he was the only husband of hers that gave her the chance to love.  Liberation from sexual norms  The early 1900s was a time in which patriarchal ideals were accepted and seen as the norm. Throughout the novel, Janie on multiple occasions suffers from these ideals. In her relationships, she is being ordered around by the man, but she did not question it, whether in the kitchen or bedroom. Janie in many ways expresses her growing distance from the sexual and social norms. After the death of Starks, Janie goes to his funeral wearing black and formal clothes. But for Tea Cake's funeral, she wears workers' blue overalls, showing that she cared less for what society thought of her as she got older. In addition, critics say that Tea Cake was the vehicle for Janie's liberation. She went from working in the kitchen and indoors to working more \\"manly\\" jobs, such as helping in the fields, fishing, and hunting. Tea Cake offered her a partnership; he didn't see her as an object to be controlled and possessed through marriage. = Value of women in a relationship = Throughout the novel, Hurston vividly displays how African American women are valued, or devalued, in their marital relationships. By doing so, she takes the reader on a journey through Janie's life and her marriages. Janie formed her initial idea of marriage off the beautiful image of unity she witnessed between a pear tree and a bee. This image and expectation sets Janie up for disappointment when it came time to marry. From her marriage to Logan Killicks to Tea Cake, Janie was forced to acknowledge where she stood as a powerless female in her relationship. Starting with her marriage to Logan, Janie was put in a place where she was expected to prove her value with hard work. On top of all the physical labor expected from her, Janie endured constant insults and physical beatings from her male counterparts. Hoping for more value, Janie decides to leave Logan and run off with Joe Starks. However, in reaction to this decision, she's only faced with more beating and devaluement. Joe expected her stay in the home, work in the kitchen, and when she was in public, Janie was expected to cover her hair and avoid conversation with the locals. With one last hope, Janie engaged in a marriage with Tea Cake, a younger man, and things finally seemed to look up for her, even though she was still expected to help in the fields and tend to her womanly duties. Overall, throughout her marriages, Janie experienced the hardships that most African American women went through at that time. From the physical labor to the physical beatings, Janie was presented with the life that a woman was expected to live. [See detailed argument and synopsis in Addison Gayle, Jr.'s article, \\"The Outsider\\"] Janie was able to feel like a woman in her third marriage with Tea Cake. In her first marriage with Logan she was being controlled by her husband. She didn't feel like a woman in her first marriage. She didn't feel any love or affection either. In her second marriage with Jody, she was able to experience independence as a woman. With Jody's death, she became in charge of the store and his property. She was able to experience freedom and an economic stable life. She learned about ownership, self determination, self ruling, and home ruling. In her last marriage with Tea Cake Janie experienced true love. But she also learned who she was as an African American woman. Throughout her marriages she learned how to value herself as a woman, an African American woman, and a hard working woman. The novel is written in dialect and colloquial language that expresses it as a story of a black woman from Southern United States. Throughout the novel, Janie serves both as protagonist as well as occasional narrator, detailing the events of her life, her three marriages, and the aftermath of each, that eventually lead to her return to Eatonville. This is done with two contrasting writing styles, one in standard English prose when the narration is done in third person, and the other making use of black Southern vernacular in dialogue. The theme of having a voice and being able to speak out is a prevalent theme throughout the novel. During her first two marriages to Logan Killicks and Joe Starks, Janie is subjugated and held under their rule, the former comparing her to another mule to work his field and the latter keeping her in a powerless position of domesticity. Throughout both marriages she finds herself without the ability to speak out or to express herself, and when she tries she is usually shut down. This leaves her feeling like a \\"rut in the road,\\" the isolation taking its toll until she finally confronts Joe and attacks his ego with a verbal assault against his manhood. The effect this takes is that it leaves Joe resenting Janie and in effect destroys what is left of their marriage. When Janie marries Tea Cake, we see how language affects the way Janie begins to feel about herself. The way Tea Cake speaks to her allows her to find the freedom in her own voice and to begin to learn how to use it. We are able to see how language helps Janie grow as a person once she learns that her voice is her power. = Race = While the novel is written about Black people in the South, it is not primarily a book about a racist society. Nanny is the first character to discuss the effects of slavery. \\"Ah was born back due in slavery so it wasn't for me to fulfil my dreams of whut a woman oughta be and to do. Dat's one of de hold-backs of slavery.\\" The novel is mostly concerned with differences within the black community. Starks is compared to the master of a plantation, as he has a huge house in the centre of the town. \\"The rest of town looked like servants' quarters surrounding the 'big house'. Starks becomes a figure of authority because he has money and is determined to create the first black town. But his plans seem to result in a town where people impose their own hierarchy. \\"Us talks about de white man keepin' us down! Shucks! He don't have tuh. Us keeps our own selves down.\\" When Janie marries Tea Cake and moves to the Everglades, she becomes friendly with Mrs. Turner. This woman compliments Janie on her light skin and European features, from her mixed-race ancestry. Turner disapproves of her marriage to Tea Cake, as he is darker skinned and more \\"African\\" looking. Inspirations and influences Perhaps the strongest inspiration for Hurston's writing of Their Eyes Were Watching God was her former lover Percival Punter.King. The Cambridge Introduction to Zora Neale Hurston. p. 25. Hurston writes in her autobiography that the romance between Janie and Tea Cake was inspired by a tumultuous love affair. She described falling in love with the man as \\"a parachute jump\\".Hurston, Zora. Dust Tracks on a Road: An Autobiography. New York: J. B. Lippincott, 1942, p. 205. as cited in Bloom, Harrold. Bloom's Guides ‚Äì Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 15. Like Janie in the novel, Hurston was significantly older than her lover. Like Jody, Punter was sexually dominant and sometimes violent.Bloom, Bloom's Guides ‚Äì Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God, p. 15. Hurston wrote Their Eyes Were Watching God three weeks after the tumultuous conclusion of her relationship with Punter. She wrote in her autobiography that she had \\"tried to embalm all the tenderness of [her] passion for him.\\"Hurston, Dust Tracks on a Road, p. 188. as cited in Bloom, Bloom's Guides ‚Äì Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God, p. 15. With this emotional inspiration, Hurston went on to paint the picture of Their Eyes Were Watching God using her personal experience and research as a template. In 1927, a decade before writing Their Eyes Were Watching God, Hurston traveled south to collect folk songs and folk tales through an anthropological research fellowship arranged by her Barnard College mentor Franz Boas.King, The Cambridge Introduction to Zora Neale Hurston. p. 7. The all-black Eatonville of Their Eyes Were Watching God is based on the all-black town of the same name in which Hurston grew up. The town's weekly announced in 1889, \\"Colored People of the United States: Solve the great race problem by securing a home in Eatonville, Florida, a Negro city governed by negroes.\\"The Eatonville Speaker, 1889. cited in Lester, Neal. Understanding Their Eyes Were Watching God. London: The Greenwood Press, 1999, p. 148. The hurricane that symbolizes the climax of Hurston's story also has an historical inspiration; in 1928, \\"a hurricane ravaged both coastal and inland areas of Florida, bringing torrential rains that broke the dikes of Lake Okeechobee near Belle Glade\\".Bloom, Bloom's Guides ‚Äì Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God. p. 14. Scholars of the African diaspora note the cultural practices common to the Caribbean, Africa, and the United States in Their Eyes Were Watching God.Wall, Cheryl A. Their Eyes Were Watching God ‚Äì A Casebook. New York: Oxford University Press, 2000. p. 6. Hurston wrote Their Eyes Were Watching God while living in Belle Glade, at the home of Harvey Poole, who, as manager of one of the local labor camps, informed her tremendously about bean picking, and the labors of African-Americans on the muckland. The book was also written while on a Guggenheim Fellowship in Haiti to research Obeah practices in the West Indies.Miles, Diana. \\"Diana Miles on Female Identity and Rebirth\\".

Reception =Initial reception= Hurston's political views in Their Eyes Were Watching God were met with resistance from several leading Harlem Renaissance authors. Novelist and essayist Richard Wright condemned Their Eyes Were Watching God, writing in a review for New Masses (1937): > Miss Hurston seems to have no desire whatsoever to move in the direction of > serious fiction‚Ä¶ [She] can write; but her prose is cloaked in that facile > sensuality that has dogged Negro expression since the days of Phyllis > Wheatley... Her characters eat and laugh and cry and work and kill; they > swing like a pendulum eternally in that safe and narrow orbit in which > America likes to see the Negro live: between laughter and tears.Wright, > Richard.

Ralph Ellison said the book contained a \\"blight of calculated burlesque.\\"Ellison, Ralph. As cited in Burt, Daniel. The Novel 100. Checkmark Books, 2003, p. 366. Alain Locke wrote in a review: \\"when will the Negro novelist of maturity, who knows how to tell a story convincingly‚Äîwhich is Miss Hurston's cradle gift, come to grips with motive fiction and social document fiction?\\"Locke, Alain. Opportunity, 06 01, 1938. (accessed April 18, 2012). The New Republics Otis Ferguson wrote: \\"it isn't that this novel is bad, but that it deserves to be better\\". But he went on to praise the work for depicting \\"Negro life in its naturally creative and unselfconscious grace\\".Ferguson, Otis. The New Republic, October 13, 1937. (accessed April 18, 2012). Not all African-American critics had negative things to say about Hurston's work. Carter G. Woodson, founder of The Journal of Negro History wrote, \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God is a gripping story... the author deserves great praise for the skill and effectiveness shown in the writing of this book.\\" The critic noted Hurston's anthropological approach to writing, \\"She studied them until she thoroughly understood the working of their minds, learned to speak their language\\".Forrest, Ethel. \\"Book Reviews\\" The Journal of Negro History. January 1, 1938. (Accessed April 12, 2012). Meanwhile, reviews of Hurston's book in the mainstream white press were largely positive, although they did not translate into significant retail sales. Writing for The New York Times, Ralph Thompson states: \\"the normal life of Negroes in the South today‚Äîthe life with its holdovers from slave times, its social difficulties, childish excitements, and endless exuberances... compared to this sort of story, the ordinary narratives of Negroes in Harlem or Birmingham seem ordinary indeed.\\"Thompson, Ralph. \\"Books of the Times.\\" The New York Times. October 6, 1937. accessed March 30, 2012. For the New York Herald Tribune, Sheila Hibben described Hurston as writing \\"with her head as with her heart\\" creating a \\"warm, vibrant touch\\". She praised Their Eyes Were Watching God as filled with \\"a flashing, gleaming riot of black people, with a limitless sense of humor, and a wild, strange sadness\\".Hibben, Sheila. \\"Book Review\\".

September 26, 1937. As cited in King, The Cambridge Introduction to Zora Neale Hurston. p. 113. =Rediscovery= As universities across the country developed Black Studies programs in the 1970s and 1980s, they created greater space for Black literature in academia. Several prominent academics, including Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Addison Gayle, Jr., established a new \\"Black Aesthetic\\" that \\"placed the sources of contemporary black literature and culture in the communal music and oral folk tradition\\".Spencer, Stephen. \\"On Hurston's Contribution to the Canon.\\" Bloom's Guides ‚Äì Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God. Edited by Harold Bloom. New York: Infobase Publishing, 2009, p. 87. This new respect coupled with a growing Black feminism led by Mary Helen Washington, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, and others would create the space for the rediscovery of Hurston. Hurston first achieved a level of mainstream institutional support in the 1970s. Walker published an essay, \\"Looking for Zora\\", in Ms. magazine in 1975. In that work, she described how the Black community's general rejection of Hurston was like \\"throwing away a genius\\". The National Endowment for the Humanities went on to award Robert Hemenway two grants for his work to write Hurston's biography.Carby, Hazel. \\"The Politics of Fiction, Anthropology, and the Folk: Zora Neale Hurston.\\" Bloom's Interpretations ‚Äì Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God.

In 1975, the Modern Language Association held a special seminar focusing on Hurston. In 1981 professor Ruth Sheffey of Baltimore's Morgan State University founded the Zora Neale Hurston Society. Hurston had attended the school, then known as Morgan Academy, in 1917.Bray, Rosemary L. \\"Renaissance for a Pioneer of Black Pride.\\" The New York Times, 02 09, 1990. In 1978, Harper and Row leased its rights to Their Eyes Were Watching God to the University of Illinois Press.

March 5, 2005. (accessed April 3, 2012). With so many new disciplines especially open to the themes and content of Hurston's work, Their Eyes Were Watching God achieved growing prominence in the last several decades. It is now firmly established in the literary canon. On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Their Eyes Were Watching God on its list of the 100 most influential novels. Critical analysis *In Maria J. Johnson's article \\"'The World in a Jug and the Stopper in [Her] Hand': Their Eyes Were Watching God as Blues Performance,\\" she states that Hurston's novel takes a similar structure and aesthetic to blues culture. Johnson also shows how the contrast of Hurston's images, such as the pleasure and pain dynamic of the bee, can be seen in songs by singers like Bessie Smith.Johnson, Maria J. \\"'The World in a Jug and the Stopper in [Her] Hand': Their Eyes Were Watching God as Blues Performance\\". African American Review, 32(3) 1998: 401‚Äì414. MLA International Bibliography. EBSCO. October 23, 2012. *The article \\"The Cognitive Construction of the Self in Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God\\", by Patrick S. Bernard, highlights the connection between the construction of self and cognition in Hurston's novel. According to Bernard, cognition is the inner essence of an individual that embodies the idea of \\"thinking, seeing, speaking, and knowing\\", but is often determined by one's exterior environment. Janie, the protagonist, uses her cognitive skills to find her identity and throughout the novel develops her cognition further. While Janie is living in a sexist society, she continues to rise above her opposition, specifically that of her three husbands. Bernard demonstrates that: > In a conversation with Jody, Janie defends 'womenfolk,' disagreeing with the > sexist claim that God made men \\"different\\" because they turn \\"out so smart\\" > (70). When she states that men \\"don't know half as much as you think you > do,\\" Jody interrupts her saying, 'you getting too moufy Janie... Go fetch me > de checker-board and de checkers' (70‚Äì71) so that he and the other men could > play (Bernard 9). :The comment from Jody, Janie's second husband, attempts to suppress her voice and manipulate her thoughts. Rather than acting submissive to Jody, Janie for a brief moment contends with Jody by telling him how men misunderstand women. Jody fears that Janie's thinking will lead to her gaining more knowledge and naturally to speaking her mind, eventually leading to Janie achieving the power of knowledge to recognize and change the mistreatment and unfairness she has been receiving. Bernard proposes the idea that Jody's relationship with Janie represents society's assumption that women are of limited cognition. This assumption positions women in subservient roles that limit their ways of thinking, speaking, and seeing. :In addition to bringing up Janie's relationship with Jody, Bernard emphasizes how her relationships with her other husbands influenced her cognition. He points out the fact that Logan Killicks, Janie's first husband, mistreated her by severing any beginning form of self-construction by treating her as an infant. Bernard also brings forth the idea that Janie's construction of selfhood blossoms when Tea Cake, her third husband, allows her to participate in experiences unimaginable to her. While Logan Killicks gives her no opportunity of expressing herself, Jody overpowers her expressive voice; Tea Cake allows her construction of self to mature link between self construction and cognition. Bernard's main point therefore is that self-construction is influenced by cognition, that is, knowing, thinking, seeing and speaking are important to the construction of self in Zora Neale Hurston's novel. *In \\"The Hierarchy Itself: Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God and the Sacrifice of Narrative Authority,\\" Ryan Simmons argues that Hurston made a statement against models of authority that supplant an oppressive system with other oppressive systems and offered an alternative. By models of authority, he means the narrative voice of the author and Janie's narrative voice. Hurston represented the different ideologies of Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Du Bois through the characters of Logan Killicks and Joe (\\"Jody\\") Starks. Like Washington, Logan models the path of \\"gradual progress\\" that would not threaten the white-dominated sphere of power and Hurston presents his practices as a tradeoff between liberty and modest prosperity. Joe models the path advocated by Du Bois, which is one of assertion of dignity and less compromise. However, the issue shown by Joe's eventual isolation from the community dialogue he helped establish and Janie's overpowering of him through a usurpation of authority, Hurston shows that the weakness with Joe's approach is that it mirrors that of white suppression. :Instead, Hurston introduces a third way of achieving self-autonomy through Tea Cake. He represents an independence from reliance on communal validation, and instead serves as a mirror for Janie to discover her narrative power. In relation to the author's narrative power, Tea Cake is the epitome of a good reader, one that is receptive to the transformative message of the text. Language is the understanding and sharpening of one's identity while communication comes second. In Hurston's innovative narrative, she is attempting to fulfill the \\"ideal narrative\\", which is one that nurtures and changes both the reader and the author.Simmons, Ryan. \\"The Hierarchy Itself: Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God and the Sacrifice of Narrative Authority\\". African American Review 36.2 (Summer 2002): 181‚Äì93. Print. *In the article ‚Äú‚ÄòThe Kiss of Memory': The Problem of Love in Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God,‚Äù author Tracy L. Bealer argues that Janie's quest for her ideal form of love, as symbolized by the pear tree in bloom, is impossible within her existing sociohistorical environment. The forces of racial and patriarchal hierarchies lead Tea Cake, who generally treats Janie as his intellectual and communal equal, to beat her in order to display his dominance to their peers. Bealer asserts that the novel's depiction of Tea Cake, abuse and all, is intentionally ambivalent in order to simultaneously promote intersubjective love and to indict racism and sexism. *William M. Ramsey, in his article \\"The compelling ambivalence of Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God,\\" posits that the novel stands as an unfinished and unrealized work. He backs this claim by noting the short amount of time Hurston spent writing as well as statements made by Hurston in her autobiography. Ramsey also note how the numerous contradictions inherent in the novel (Tea Cake's treatment of Janie, Janie's idealization of Tea Cake, Janie's expectations of a utopian \\"pear tree\\" marriage, etc.) have led to wildly different interpretations and ultimately, a richly ambivalent text. :He also suggests that Tea Cake's death is \\"Hurston's vicarious revenge on Arthur Price,\\" a former lover that Hurston left to pursue a research fellowship in the Caribbean. *In the article \\"Naming and Power in Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes were Watching God,\\" Sigrid King comments that \\"Naming has always been an important issue in the Afro-American tradition because of its link to the exercise of power.\\" Their names are a form of power. King also says that \\"Nanny teaches Janie the same lessons she learned about naming: Names are bound within the white male power structure, and the most s black woman can hope for is to endure within them\\". Nanny tells Janie that names are powerful are used to take power away from people and in the book we see thar Nanny's name is her role in society and not an actual name. Hurston is aware of the power that names have and she chooses to have Janie start off the book without having a name.https://blogs.baruch.cuny.edu/modernnovel/files/2018/06/King-on- Hurston.pdf *In the article \\"Racial and sexual politics of Their Eyes are Watching God from a spatial perspective\\", Lihua Zhao argues that Janie is a victim of racism and gender sexism which leads to her poor character attributes in a lead black female novel. Zhao comments on the novel saying \\"Janie's determined and consistent ignorance of racial spatial division implies her weak black identification, the horrible damage done by racism. Her vague and brief feminist consciousness suggests the brainwash of patriarchy is so successful that it is very hard to eliminate.\\" Zhao states that in order to bring attention to a social political issue, we must first expose the problem in a meaningful manner like how Hurston has in her novel. *In the article \\"Mules and women: identify and rebel‚ÄîJanie's identity quest in \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God'\\", Hongzhi Wu explores the symbolism of the mule in Hurston's novel claiming that it provides a deeper meaning of the external issues of racism. Wu states, \\"In all these animal talks they expressed their hatred of the abuses and exploitation from the white world; their despise of their white master's ignorance and viciousness; their acclamation of the black people's industriousness and intelligence; and they also expressed their hope of salvation.\\" The mule acts as a metaphor for the exploitation and mistreatment of the black community by the white superiority race. Adaptations for theater, film and radio *In 1983, the graduate repertory Hilberry Theater at Wayne State University produced To Gleam It Around, To Show My Shine, which is based on Their Eyes Were Watching God. The play was written by Bonnie Lee Moss Rattner and directed by Von Washington. It has been produced numerous times by other companies. *Oprah Winfrey served as executive producer of the made-for-TV adaptation Their Eyes Were Watching God in 2005. Harpo Productions sponsored the film, directed by Darnell Martin and with a screenplay written by Suzan-Lori Parks, Misan Sagay and Bobby Smith, Jr. *In 2011, the novel was adapted as a radio play for BBC World Drama, dramatized by Patricia Cumper. The play first aired on February 19, 2011. *In 2012, a live radio play performance of Their Eyes Were Watching God, written by Arthur Yorinks, was broadcast on February 29 and March 1 to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the book's publication.Itzkoff, Dave. \\"Radio Play of 'Their Eyes Were Watching God' Is Set\\" The New York Times, February 8, 2012.

It follows a Dutch-American villager in colonial America named Rip Van Winkle who meets mysterious Dutchmen, imbibes their liquor and falls asleep in the Catskill Mountains. He awakes 20 years later to a very changed world, having missed the American Revolution. Inspired by a conversation on nostalgia with his American expatriate brother-in-law, Irving wrote the story while temporarily living in Birmingham, England. It was published in his collection, The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. While the story is set in New York's Catskill Mountains near where Irving later took up residence, he admitted, \\"When I wrote the story, I had never been on the Catskills.\\"Pierre M. Irving, The Life and Letters of Washington Irving, G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1883, vol. 2, p. 176.  Plot  \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" is set in the years before and after the American Revolutionary War in a village at the foot of New York's Catskill Mountains where Rip Van Winkle, a Dutch-American villager, lives. One autumn day, Van Winkle wanders into the mountains with his dog Wolf to escape his wife's nagging. He hears his name called out and sees a man wearing antiquated Dutch clothing; he is carrying a keg up the mountain and requires help. Together, the men and Wolf proceed to a hollow in which Rip discovers the source of thunderous noises: a group of ornately dressed, silent, bearded men who are playing nine-pins. Van Winkle does not ask who they are or how they know his name. Instead, he begins to drink some of their liquor and soon falls asleep. When he awakens on the mountain, he discovers shocking changes: his musket is rotting and rusty, his beard is a foot long, and his dog is nowhere to be found. He returns to his village, where he recognizes no one. He arrives just after an election, and people ask how he voted. Never having cast a ballot in his life, he proclaims himself a faithful subject of King George III, unaware that the American Revolution has taken place, and nearly gets himself into trouble with the townspeople until one elderly woman recognizes him as the long-lost Rip Van Winkle. King George's portrait on the inn's sign has been replaced with one of George Washington. Van Winkle learns that most of his friends were killed fighting in the American Revolution. He is also disturbed to find another man called Rip Van Winkle; it is his son, now grown up. Van Winkle also discovers that his wife died some time ago but is not saddened by the news. He learns that the men whom he met in the mountains are rumored to be the ghosts of Henry Hudson's crew from his ship, the Halve Maen. He also realizes that he has been away from the village for at least 20 years. His grown daughter takes him in and he resumes his usual idleness. His strange tale is solemnly taken to heart by the Dutch settlers, particularly by the children who say that, whenever thunder is heard, the men in the mountains must be playing nine-pins.

Composition and publication history First installment of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. included \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" After a failed business venture with his brothers, Irving filed for bankruptcy in 1818. Despondent, he turned to writing for possible financial support, although he had difficulty thinking of stories to write. He stayed in Birmingham, England where his brother-in-law Henry Van Wart had opened a trading firm. The two were reminiscing in June 1818 when Irving was suddenly inspired by their nostalgic conversation. Irving locked himself in his room and wrote non-stop all night. As he said, he felt like a man waking from a long sleep. He presented the first draft of \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" to the Van Wart family over breakfast. \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" was one of the first stories Irving proposed for his new book, The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent. Irving asked his brother Ebeneezer to assist with publication in the United States. As Irving wrote, \\"I shall feel very anxious to hear of the success of this first re-appearance on the literary stage ‚Äì Should it be successful, I trust I shall be able henceforth to keep up an occasional fire.\\" 2,000 copies of the first octavo-sized installment, which included \\"Rip Van Winkle\\", were released on June 23, 1819, in Baltimore, Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, published by Cornelius S. Van Winkle, and sold at a somewhat expensive 75 cents. A British edition was published shortly afterward, by John Miller, who went out of business immediately thereafter. With help from his friend Walter Scott, Irving was able to convince John Murray to take over British publication of the Sketch Book. Following the success of Rip Van Winkle in print and on stage, later celebrated editions were illustrated by Arthur Rackham (Heinemann, 1905) and N.C. Wyeth (McKay, 1921). Themes and literary forerunners In the tenth chapter of his book Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers, the third- century AD Greek historian Diogenes La√´rtius relates the story of the legendary sage Epimenides of Knossos, who was said to have been a shepherd on the island of Krete. One day, Epimenides followed after a sheep that had wandered off and, after becoming tired, went into a cave under Mount Ida and fell asleep. When he awoke, he continued searching for the sheep, but could not find it, so he returned to his father's farm, only to discover that it was under new ownership. He went home, only to discover that the people there did not know him. Finally, he encountered his younger brother, who had become an old man, and learned that he had been asleep in the cave for fifty-seven years. According to the different sources that Diogenes relates, Epimenides lived to be 154, 157, or 299 years old. Multiple sources have identified the story of Epimenides as the earliest known variant of the \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" fairy tale. In Christian tradition, there is a similar, well-known story of \\"The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus\\", which recounts a group of early Christians who hid in a cave circa 250 AD, to escape the persecution of Christians during the reign of the Roman emperor Decius. They fell into a miraculous sleep and woke some 200 years later during the reign of Theodosius II, to discover that the city and the whole Empire had become Christian. This Christian story is recounted by Islam and appears in a famous Sura of the Quran, Sura Al- Kahf.Quran Surah Al-Kahf The version recalls a group of young monotheists escaping from persecution within a cave and emerging hundreds of years later. Another similar story in the Islamic tradition is of Uzair (usually identified with the Biblical Ezra) whose grief at the Destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians was so great that God took his soul and brought him back to life after Jerusalem was reconstructed. He rode on his revived donkey and entered his native place. But the people did not recognize him, nor did his household, except the maid, who was now an old blind woman. He prayed to God to cure her blindness and she could see again. He meets his son who recognized him by a mole between his shoulders and was older than he was.Ibn Kathir, Stories of the Prophets, translated by Shaikh muhammed Mustafa Gemeiah, Office of the Grand Imam, Sheikh al-Azhar, El-Nour Publishing, Egypt, 1997, Ch.21, pp.322-4 (see Uzair#Islamic tradition and literature). In Judaism, there is the story of Honi ha-M'agel, a miracle-working sage of the 1st century BC, who was a historical character but to whom various myths were attached. One of them recounts that Honi was journeying on the road and he saw a man planting a carob tree. He asked him: How long does it take to bear fruit? The man replied: Seventy years. ha-M'agel then further asked the man: Are you certain that you will live another seventy years? The man replied: No. But I am planting this not for myself, but for the other generations to come after me and the generations to follow those. Honi then shrugged as he walked away from the man. Later that day, he sat down to take a rest. But he slept for seventy years, and rocks had formed a tent-like structure around him. When he woke, he saw a man picking a tree with carobs all over it. He asked: Are you the man that planted this tree? The man replied: No. But my father told me that his father planted this tree for me.Babylonian Talmud Taanit 23a Hebrew/Aramaic text at Mechon-Mamre The story of \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" itself is widely thought to have been based on Johann Karl Christoph Nachtigal's German folktale \\"Peter Klaus\\", which is a shorter story set in a German village. It tells of a goatherd named Peter Klaus who goes looking for a lost goat. He finds some men drinking in the woods and, after drinking some of their wine, he falls asleep. When he wakes back up, twenty years have passed.A translation of the tale is available on Wikisource: Peter the Goatherd. In many ways, the story is a classic European fairy tale of a man who is actually rewarded for helping the fairies move their barrel. They advance him to a time in life where he is free of his nagging wife and is now old enough for it be respectable for him to take it easy and play with children, working when he wants to instead of when he has to, supported by his loving, grown children. The theme of independence is also explored; the young Van Winkle lives in British America and is a subject of the King; the old Van Winkle awakes in a country independent of the Crown. On a personal level, the awakened Van Winkle has gained another form of \\"independence\\": being widowered from his shrewish wife. In Orkney, there is a similar folktale linked to the burial mound of Salt Knowe, adjacent to the Ring of Brodgar. A drunken fiddler on his way home hears music from the mound. He finds a way in and finds the (trolls) having a party. He stays and plays for two hours, then makes his way home to Stenness, where he discovers 50 years have passed. The Orkney Rangers believe this may be one source for Washington Irving's tale because his father was an Orcadian from the island of Shapinsay and would almost certainly have known the story. In Ireland, the story of Niamh and Oisin has a similar theme. Oisin falls in love with the beautiful Niamh and leaves with her on her snow white horse, bound for Tir Na nOg ‚Äì the land of the ever-young. Missing his family and friends, he asks to pay them a visit. Niamh lends him her horse, warning him never to dismount, and he travels back to Ireland. But 300 years have passed; his family and fellow warriors are all dead. When Oisin encounters some men trying to move a boulder, he reaches down to help them, the girth of the horse's saddle snaps, and he falls to the ground. Before the watching eyes of the men, he becomes a very, very old man. Author Joe Gioia suggests the basic plot strongly resembles, and may have originated with, an upstate New York Seneca legend of a young squirrel hunter who encounters the mystic \\"Little People\\", and after a night with them returns to his village to find it overgrown by forest and everyone gone: that single night had lasted a year. The story also bears some similarities to stories from east Asia, including the third century AD Chinese tale of \\"Ranka\\", as retold by Lionel Giles in A Gallery of Chinese Immortals, and the eighth-century Japanese tale \\"Urashima Tar≈ç\\". The Hindu story of Muchukunda from the Bhagavatam also displays many similarities to the story of \\"Rip Van Winkle\\". The theme is taken up in numerous modern works of science fiction. In H. G. Wells's The Sleeper Awakes, a man who sleeps for two hundred and three years wakes up in a completely transformed London where he has become the richest man in the world. In the original Buck Rogers book, the protagonist falls asleep under the influence of a gas in a mine, sleeps for four centuries and wakes to find America under the rule of Mongol invaders ‚Äì whereupon he places himself at the head of the freedom fighters. In Roger Zelazny's science-fantasy series The Chronicles of Amber, protagonist Corwyn experiences drinking and revelry in an underground lair with otherworldly people who try to entice him into slumber; he knows this is a centuries-of- sleep trap and resists; the passage is similar in theme to both \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" and especially the Orkney story. Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, under which a person traveling at near light speed would experience only the passage of a few years but would return to find centuries had passed on Earth, provides a broad new scope to express essentially the same literary theme ‚Äì for example, in the opening chapter of Ursula K. Le Guin's Rocannon's World. In Robert Heinlein's Time for the Stars, Earth sends out a fleet of relativistic ships to explore the galaxy, their crews hailed as stalwart pioneers ‚Äì but after a century, which they experience as only a few years, faster-than-light ships are developed and the earlier ones are recalled, their crews discovering that they had become unwanted anachronisms on a changed Earth. The protagonist notices a newspaper headline disparagingly announcing the arrival of himself and his shipmates as \\"yet another crew of Rip Van Winkles\\". The Queen song '39 is similarly a tale of relativistic space travelers returning to their home planet to find a century has elapsed.

The fastest known species of tiger beetle, Cicindela hudsoni, can run at a speed of , or about 125 body lengths per second.Cornell News, Jan. 16, 1998 When tiger beetles chase prey at high speeds they go blind temporarily, Cornell entomologists learn As of 2005, about 2,600 species and subspecies were known, with the richest diversity in the Oriental (Indo-Malayan) region, followed by the Neotropics.Pearson, D.L. & F. Cassola, 2005 Description Tiger beetles often have large bulging eyes, long, slender legs and large curved mandibles. All are predatory, both as adults and as larvae. The genus Cicindela has a cosmopolitan distribution. Other well-known genera include Tetracha, Omus, Amblycheila and Manticora. While members of the genus Cicindela are usually diurnal and may be out on the hottest days, Tetracha, Omus, Amblycheila and Manticora are all nocturnal. Both Cicindela and Tetracha are often brightly colored, while the other genera mentioned are usually uniform black in color. Tiger beetles in the genus Manticora are the largest in size of the subfamily. These live primarily in the dry regions of southern Africa. The larvae of tiger beetles live in cylindrical burrows as much as a meter deep. They are large-headed, hump-backed grubs and use their humpbacks to flip backwards, for the purpose of capturing prey insects that wander over the ground. The fast- moving adults run down their prey and are extremely fast on the wing, their reaction times being of the same order as that of common houseflies. Some tiger beetles in the tropics are arboreal, but most run on the surface of the ground. They live along sea and lake shores, on sand dunes, around playa lakebeds and on clay banks or woodland paths, being particularly fond of sandy surfaces.Werner, K. 2000 Tiger beetles are considered a good indicator species and have been used in ecological studies on biodiversity. Several species of wingless parasitic wasps in the genus Methocha (family Thynnidae), lay their eggs on larvae of various Cicindela spp., such as Cicindela dorsalis.Burdick, D.J. and Wasbauer, M.S. (1959). \\"Biology of Methocha californica Westwood (Hymenoptera: Tiphiidae).\\" Wasmann Jour. Biol. 17:75-88. Department of Environmental Conservation Adaptations Tiger beetles display an unusual form of pursuit in which they alternatively sprint quickly toward their prey, then stop and visually reorient. This may be because while running, the beetle is moving too fast for its visual system to accurately process images. To avoid obstacles while running they hold their antennae rigidly and directly in front of them to mechanically sense their environment.Blinded by speed, tiger beetles use antennae to 'see' while running Fossil record The oldest fossil tiger beetle yet found, Cretotetracha grandis, comes from the Yixian Formation in Inner Mongolia, China, and dates to the early Cretaceous Period, 125 million years ago. Most fossils found are grey or yellow silty mudstone. Traits that identify Cretotetracha as Cicindelinae include long mandibles shaped like sickles, simple teeth arranged along the mandible's inner surface, antennae that attach to the head between the base of the mandibles and the eye. The left mandible is approximately 3.3 mm and the right mandible is approximately 4.2mm long. A long body form roughly around 8.1mm where the combined eyes and head are wider than the thorax, and long running legs. Previously known Mesozoic fossils of tiger beetles have been described from the Crato Formation, about 113 million years ago and Oxycheilopsis cretacicus from the Santana Formation, 112 million years ago, both in Brazil. Taxonomy Museum specimen of Manticora sp. from Mozambique. The rare Salt Creek tiger beetle, Cicindela nevadica lincolniana Cicindela aurofasciata from India, showing the large eyes and mandibles Most tiger beetles run on the ground living on sand and lake shores Cicindela chinensis One of species in Gunung Belumut Recreational Forest. Tiger beetles were traditionally classified as the family Cicindelidae but most authorities now treat them as the subfamily Cicindelinae of the Carabidae (ground beetles). The most recent classifications, however, have relegated them to a monophyletic subgroup within the subfamily Carabinae, though this is not yet universally accepted. Accordingly, there is no consensus classification for this group, at any level from family down to subspecies, and it can be exceedingly difficult to decipher the taxonomic literature surrounding this group. Many genera are the result of the splitting of the large genus Cicindela, and many were described by the German entomologist Walther Horn.

Early life and education  Frits Zernike was born on 16 July 1888 in Amsterdam, Netherlands to Carl Friedrich August Zernike and Antje Dieperink. Both parents were teachers of mathematics, and he especially shared his father's passion for physics. He studied chemistry (his major), mathematics and physics at the University of Amsterdam.  Academic career  In 1912, he was awarded a prize for his work on opalescence in gases. In 1913, he became the assistant of Jacobus Kapteyn at the astronomical laboratory of Groningen University. In 1914, Zernike and Leonard Ornstein were jointly responsible for the derivation of the Ornstein‚ÄìZernike equation in critical- point theory. In 1915, he obtained a position in theoretical physics at the same university and in 1920 he was promoted to full professor of theoretical physics. In 1930, Zernike was conducting research into spectral lines when he discovered that the so-called ghost lines that occur to the left and right of each primary line in spectra created by means of a diffraction grating, have their phase shifted from that of the primary line by 90 degrees. It was at a Physical and Medical Congress in Wageningen in 1933, that Zernike first described his phase contrast technique in microscopy. He extended his method to test the figure of concave mirrors. His discovery lay at the base of the first phase contrast microscope, built during World War II. He also made another contribution in the field of optics, relating to the efficient description of the imaging defects or aberrations of optical imaging systems like microscopes and telescopes. The representation of aberrations was originally based on the theory developed by Ludwig Seidel in the middle of the nineteenth century. Seidel's representation was based on power series expansions and did not allow a clear separation between various types and orders of aberrations. Zernike's orthogonal circle polynomials provided a solution to the long-standing problem of the optimum 'balancing' of the various aberrations of an optical instrument. Since the 1960s, Zernike's circle polynomials are widely used in optical design, optical metrology and image analysis. Zernike's work helped awaken interest in coherence theory, the study of partially coherent light sources. In 1938 he published a simpler derivation of Van Cittert's 1934 theorem on the coherence of radiation from distant sources, now known as the Van Cittert‚ÄìZernike theorem.  Death  He died in the hospital at Amersfoort, Netherlands in 1966 after suffering illness the last years of his life. His granddaughter is journalist Kate Zernike.New York Times Weddings: Kate Zernike and Jonathan Schwartz\\" September 25, 2005  Honours and awards  In 1946, Zernike became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1953, Zernike won the Nobel Prize in Physics, for his invention of the phase-contrast microscope, an instrument that permits the study of internal cell structure without the need to stain and thus kill the cells. In 1954, Zernike became an Honorary Member of The Optical Society (OSA). Zernike was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS). The university complex to the north of the city of Groningen is named after him (Zernike park), as is the crater Zernike on the Moon. Zernike's great-nephew Gerard 't Hooft won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1999. The Oz Enterprise, a Linux distribution, was named after Leonard Ornstein and Frederik Zernike.

In the Garhwal Himalaya of India, a practice called baranaja involves sowing 12 or more crops on the same plot, including various types of beans, grains, and millets, and harvesting them at different times. Due to this, multiple cropping became more prevalent in Asian countries.

All other functions are first-order functions. In mathematics higher-order functions are also termed operators or functionals. The differential operator in calculus is a common example, since it maps a function to its derivative, also a function. Higher-order functions should not be confused with other uses of the word \\"functor\\" throughout mathematics, see Functor (disambiguation). In the untyped lambda calculus, all functions are higher-order; in a typed lambda calculus, from which most functional programming languages are derived, higher-order functions that take one function as argument are values with types of the form (\\\\tau_1\\\\to\\\\tau_2)\\\\to\\\\tau_3. General examples * \`map\` function, found in many functional programming languages, is one example of a higher-order function. It takes as arguments a function f and a collection of elements, and as the result, returns a new collection with f applied to each element from the collection. * Sorting functions, which take a comparison function as a parameter, allowing the programmer to separate the sorting algorithm from the comparisons of the items being sorted. The C standard function \`qsort\` is an example of this. * filter * fold * apply * Function composition * Integration * Callback * Tree traversal * Montague grammar, a semantic theory of natural language, uses higher-order functions Support in programming languages =Direct support= The examples are not intended to compare and contrast programming languages, but to serve as examples of higher-order function syntax In the following examples, the higher-order function \`twice\` takes a function, and applies the function to some value twice. If \`twice\` has to be applied several times for the same \`f\` it preferably should return a function rather than a value. This is in line with the \\"don't repeat yourself\\" principle.

Scheme (define (add x y) (+ x y)) (define (f x) (lambda (y) (+ x y))) (display ((f 3) 7)) (display (add 3 7)) In this Scheme example, the higher- order function \`(f x)\` is used to implement currying. It takes a single argument and returns a function. The evaluation of the expression \`((f 3) 7)\` first returns a function after evaluating \`(f 3)\`. The returned function is \`(lambda (y) (+ 3 y))\`. Then, it evaluates the returned function with 7 as the argument, returning 10. This is equivalent to the expression \`(add 3 7)\`, since \`(f x)\` is equivalent to the curried form of \`(add x y)\`.

In this Erlang example, the higher-order function \`or_else\`/2 takes a list of functions (\`Fs\`) and argument (\`X\`). It evaluates the function \`F\` with the argument \`X\` as argument. If the function \`F\` returns false then the next function in \`Fs\` will be evaluated. If the function \`F\` returns \`{false,Y}\` then the next function in \`Fs\` with argument \`Y\` will be evaluated. If the function \`F\` returns \`R\` the higher-order function \`or_else\`/2 will return \`R\`. Note that \`X\`, \`Y\`, and \`R\` can be functions. The example returns \`false\`.

The following C code computes an approximation of the integral of an arbitrary function: #include double square(double x) { return x * x; } double cube(double x) { return x * x * x; } /* Compute the integral of f() within the interval [a,b] */ double integral(double f(double x), double a, double b, int n) { int i; double sum = 0; double dt = (b - a) / n; for (i = 0; i < n; ++i) { sum += f(a + (i + 0.5) * dt); } return sum * dt; } int main() { printf(\\"%g \\", integral(square, 0, 1, 100)); printf(\\"%g \\", integral(cube, 0, 1, 100)); return 0; } The qsort function from the C standard library uses a function pointer to emulate the behavior of a higher-order function. Macros Macros can also be used to achieve some of the effects of higher-order functions. However, macros cannot easily avoid the problem of variable capture; they may also result in large amounts of duplicated code, which can be more difficult for a compiler to optimize. Macros are generally not strongly typed, although they may produce strongly typed code. Dynamic code evaluation In other imperative programming languages, it is possible to achieve some of the same algorithmic results as are obtained via higher-order functions by dynamically executing code (sometimes called Eval or Execute operations) in the scope of evaluation. There can be significant drawbacks to this approach: *The argument code to be executed is usually not statically typed; these languages generally rely on dynamic typing to determine the well-formedness and safety of the code to be executed. *The argument is usually provided as a string, the value of which may not be known until run-time. This string must either be compiled during program execution (using just-in-time compilation) or evaluated by interpretation, causing some added overhead at run-time, and usually generating less efficient code. Objects In object-oriented programming languages that do not support higher-order functions, objects can be an effective substitute. An object's methods act in essence like functions, and a method may accept objects as parameters and produce objects as return values. Objects often carry added run-time overhead compared to pure functions, however, and added boilerplate code for defining and instantiating an object and its method(s). Languages that permit stack-based (versus heap-based) objects or structs can provide more flexibility with this method. An example of using a simple stack based record in Free Pascal with a function that returns a function: program example; type int = integer; Txy = record x, y: int; end; Tf = function (xy: Txy): int; function f(xy: Txy): int; begin Result := xy.y + xy.x; end; function g(func: Tf): Tf; begin result := func; end; var a: Tf; xy: Txy = (x: 3; y: 7); begin a := g(@f); // return a function to \\"a\\" writeln(a(xy)); // prints 10 end. The function \`a()\` takes a \`Txy\` record as input and returns the integer value of the sum of the record's \`x\` and \`y\` fields (3 + 7). Defunctionalization Defunctionalization can be used to implement higher-order functions in languages that lack first-class functions: // Defunctionalized function data structures template struct Add { T value; }; template struct DivBy { T value; }; template struct Composition { F f; G g; }; // Defunctionalized function application implementations template auto apply(Composition f, X arg) { return apply(f.f, apply(f.g, arg)); } template auto apply(Add f, X arg) { return arg + f.value; } template auto apply(DivBy f, X arg) { return arg / f.value; } // Higher-order compose function template Composition compose(F f, G g) { return Composition {f, g}; } int main(int argc, const char* argv[]) { auto f = compose(DivBy{ 2.0f }, Add{ 5 }); apply(f, 3); // 4.0f apply(f, 9); // 7.0f return 0; } In this case, different types are used to trigger different functions via function overloading. The overloaded function in this example has the signature \`auto apply\`.

From 1956 through 1970, he co-anchored NBC's top-rated nightly news program, The Huntley‚ÄìBrinkley Report, with Chet Huntley and thereafter appeared as co- anchor or commentator on its successor, NBC Nightly News, through the 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s, Brinkley was host of the popular Sunday This Week with David Brinkley program and a top commentator on election-night coverage for ABC News. Over the course of his career, Brinkley received ten Emmy Awards, three George Foster Peabody Awards, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He wrote three books, including the 1988 bestseller Washington Goes to War, about how World War II transformed the nation's capital. His books were largely based on his own observations as a young reporter in the city. Early life Brinkley was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, the youngest of five children born to William Graham Brinkley and Mary MacDonald (n√©e West) Brinkley. He began writing for a local newspaper, the Wilmington Morning Star, while still attending New Hanover High School. He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Emory University, and Vanderbilt University, before entering service in the United States Army in 1940. Following a medical discharge, he worked for United Press International in several of its Southern bureaus. In 1943, he moved to Washington, D.C., looking for a radio job at CBS News. Instead, he took a job at NBC News, became its White House correspondent, and in time began appearing on television. Career In 1952, Brinkley began providing Washington reporting on NBC Television's evening news program, The Camel News Caravan (the name changed over time), hosted by John Cameron Swayze. In 1956, NBC News executives considered various possibilities to anchor the network's coverage of the Democratic and Republican political conventions, and when executive J. Davidson Taylor suggested pairing two reporters (he had in mind Bill Henry and Ray Scherer), producer Reuven Frank, who favored Brinkley for the job, and NBC's director of news, Joseph Meyers, who favored Chet Huntley, proposed combining Huntley and Brinkley. NBC's top brass consented, but they had so little confidence in the team that they withheld announcing it for two months.Frank, Reuven. Out of Thin Air: The Brief Wonderful Life of Network News. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991, pp. 100‚Äì102. Their concern proved unfounded. The pairing worked so well that on October 29, 1956, the two took over NBC's flagship nightly newscast, with Huntley in New York City and Brinkley in Washington, D.C., for the newly christened Huntley‚ÄìBrinkley Report. Brinkley's dry wit offset the serious tone set by Huntley, and the program proved popular with audiences turned off by the incessantly serious tone of CBS's news broadcasts of that era. Brinkley's ability to write for the ear with simple, declarative sentences gained him a reputation as one of the medium's most talented writers, and his connections in Washington led CBS's Roger Mudd to observe, \\"Brinkley, of all the TV guys here, probably has the best sense of the city ‚Äî best understands its moods and mentality. He knows Washington and he knows the people.\\"\\"An Accident of Casting,\\" The New Yorker (1968-08-03), p. 41. Most often described as \\"wry\\", Brinkley once suggested on the air that the best way to resolve the controversy over whether to change the name of Boulder Dam to \\"Hoover Dam\\" was to have former president Herbert Hoover change his name to \\"Herbert Boulder\\". Another example of Brinkley's wryness was evinced on the third night of Chicago's infamous Democratic Convention of 1968. After continuous abuses of NBC correspondents made on the floor of the convention ‚Äî namely, interference and shadowing of the media staff by supporters of Hubert Humphrey, presumably with connections to political boss Richard J. Daley ‚Äî Brinkley criticized Daley's alleged interference with freedom of the press following Senator Abraham Ribicoff's stormy nomination of George McGovern. Perhaps in reply to a control room request for objectivity and alluding to Daley's refusal to be interviewed by NBC's John Chancellor earlier in the evening, Brinkley was heard over the noise of the McGovern demonstration saying, \\"Mayor Daley had his chance!\\" (i.e., \\"now give the McGovern people theirs\\").http://www.museum.tv/exhibitionssection.php?page=466 part seven Huntley and Brinkley's nightly sign-off ‚Äî \\"Good night, Chet,\\" Brinkley would intone; \\"Good night, David,\\" Huntley would reply ‚Äî entered popular usage and was followed by the beginning of the second movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony as the program credits rolled. The Huntley‚ÄìBrinkley Report was America's most popular television newscast until it was overtaken, at the end of the 1960s, by the CBS Evening News, anchored by Walter Cronkite. Brinkley and his co-anchor gained such celebrity that Brinkley was forced to cut short his reporting on Hubert Humphrey in the 1960 West Virginia primary because West Virginians were more interested in meeting Brinkley than the candidate.\\"An Accident of Casting\\", The New Yorker (1968-08-03), p. 34. From 1961 to 1963, Brinkley anchored a prime time news magazine, David Brinkley's Journal. Produced by Ted Yates, the program won a George Foster Peabody Award and two Emmy Awards.Thomas A. Mascaro, \\"They Beat the Clock‚ÄîNBC's Innovative Newsmagazine, David Brinkley's Journal (1961‚Äì1963)\\", Television Quarterly. When Huntley retired from the anchor chair in 1970, the evening news program was renamed NBC Nightly News (not insignificantly employing the suffixes of Huntley and Brinkley's surnames for the sake of continuity), and Brinkley co- anchored the broadcast with John Chancellor and Frank McGee. In 1971, Chancellor was named sole anchor, and Brinkley became the program's commentator, delivering three-minute perspectives several times a week under a reprise of the earlier title, David Brinkley's Journal. By 1976, though, NBC had decided to revive the dual-anchor format, and Brinkley once again anchored the Washington desk for the network until October 1979. But the early years of Nightly News never achieved the popularity of Huntley-Brinkley Report, and none of several news magazine shows anchored by Brinkley during the 1970s succeeded. An unhappy Brinkley left NBC in 1981; NBC Magazine was his last show for that network. Almost immediately, Brinkley was offered a job at ABC. ABC News President Roone Arledge was anxious to replace ABC's Sunday morning news program, Issues and Answers, which had always lagged far behind CBS's Face the Nation and NBC's Meet the Press. Brinkley was tapped for the job and in 1981 began hosting This Week with David Brinkley. This Week revolutionized the Sunday morning news program format, featuring not only several correspondents interviewing guest newsmakers, but concluding with a roundtable discussion. The format proved highly successful and was soon imitated by ABC's NBC and CBS rivals as well as engendering new programs originating both nationally and from local stations. For a brief period after Washington-based World News Tonight anchor Frank Reynolds was diagnosed with hepatitis that ultimately claimed his life on July 20, 1983, Brinkley returned to the network anchor desk as Reynolds' substitute from Washington. This arrangement lasted until July 4; when Reynolds' eventual successor as the network anchor, Peter Jennings, was brought in from his post in London. As part of ABC's commemoration of World War II, Brinkley and the News division produced the special, The Battle of the Bulge: 50 Years On, with Brinkley hosting and interviewing survivors of the battle, Allied and Axis. The special, which aired at Christmas 1994, was critically acclaimed and widely viewed. Retirement Days before he announced his retirement from regular news coverage, Brinkley made a rare, on-air mistake during evening coverage of the 1996 United States presidential election at a moment when he thought he was on commercial break. One of his colleagues asked him what he thought of the prospects for Bill Clinton's re-election. He called Clinton \\"a bore\\" and added, \\"The next four years will be filled with pretty words and pretty music and a lot of goddamn nonsense!\\" One of his team pointed out that they were still on the air. Brinkley said, \\"Really? Well, I'm leaving anyway!\\" Brinkley offered Clinton an apology during a one-on-one interview a week or so later. Brinkley last broadcast as host of This Week was November 10, 1996, but he continued to provide short pieces of commentary for the show until 1997. He then fully retired from television. He had been an electronic journalist for over fifty years and had been anchor or host of a daily or weekly national television program for just over forty years. His career extended from the end of the radio age to the age of the internet. In addition to his ten Emmys and three Peabodys, Brinkley also received the Alfred I. duPont Award in 1958.All duPont‚ÄìColumbia Award Winners , Columbia Journalism School. Retrieved 2013-08-06. In 1982, he received the Paul White Award for lifetime achievement from the Radio Television Digital News Association. In 1988, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. In 1992, President George H. W. Bush awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor. Bush called him \\"the elder statesman of broadcast journalism\\" but Brinkley was much more humble. In an interview in 1992, he said, \\"Most of my life, I've simply been a reporter covering things and writing and talking about it.\\" Personal Life David Brinkley married the former Flora Ann Fischer in 1946, and had three sons, later divorcing in 1972. Brinkley is the father of the late historian and former Columbia University provost Alan Brinkley and the late Stanford journalism professor and Pulitzer Prize‚Äìwinning writer Joel Brinkley. Soon after, Brinkley would later marry Susan Melanie Benfer that same year in 1972, with Benfer bringing daughter Alexis from another marriage. The second union lasted until Brinkley's death. Death Brinkley died in 2003 at his home in Houston from complications of a fall suffered at his vacation home in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, according to his son, John Brinkley. His body is interred at Oakdale Cemetery, Wilmington, North Carolina.

In the field of classical music, France has produced several prominent romantic composers, while folk and popular music have seen the rise of the chanson and cabaret style. The earliest known sound recording device in the world, the phonautograph, was patented in France by √âdouard-L√©on Scott de Martinville in 1857. France is also the 5th largest market by value in the world, and its music industry has produced many internationally renowned artists, especially in the nouvelle chanson and electronic music. Classical music =Medieval= French music history dates back to organum in the 10th century, followed by the Notre Dame School, an organum composition style. Troubadour songs of chivalry and courtly love were composed in the Occitan language between the 10th and 13th centuries, and the Trouv√®re poet-composers flourished in Northern France during this period. The fiddle was their instrument of choice. By the end of the 12th century, a form of song called the motet arose, accompappnied by traveling musicians called jongleurs. In the 14th century, France produced two notable styles of music, Ars Nova and Ars Subtilior =Renaissance= Petits Chanteurs de Passy, Pavane composed by Thoinot Arbeau (1519 - 1595). Burgundy, which was the mostly French-speaking area unified with the Kingdom of France in 1477, had become a major center for musical development in the musical continent Europe. This was followed by the rise of chansons and the Burgundian School. =Baroque= Influential composers included Jean-Baptiste Lully, √âlisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre, Louis Couperin, Fran√ßois Couperin and Jacques Champion de Chambonni√®res. Jean Philippe Rameau, a prominent opera composer, wrote an influential treatise on musical theory, especially in the subject of harmony; he also introduced the clarinet into his orchestras. In the late Renaissance and early Baroque period, a type of popular secular vocal music called Air de cour spread throughout France. = Opera = The first French opera may be Ak√©bar roi du Mogol, first performed in Carpentras in 1646. It was followed by the team of Pierre Perrin and Cambert, whose Pastoral in Music, performed in Issy, was a success, and the pair moved to Paris to produce Pomone (1671) and Les Peines et les Plaisirs de l'Amour (1672). Jean-Baptiste Lully, who had become well known for composing ballets for Louis XIV, began creating a French version of the Italian opera seria, a kind of tragic opera known as trag√©die lyrique or trag√©die en musique - see (French lyric tragedy). His first was Cadmus from 1673. Lully's forays into operatic tragedy were accompanied by the pinnacle of French theatrical tragedy, led by Corneille and Racine. Lully also developed the common beat patterns used by conductors to this day and was the first to take the role of leading the orchestra from the position of the first violin. The French composer Georges Bizet composed Carmen, one of the best-known and most popular operas. =Classical era= Claude Balbastre was an organist, harpsichordist and fortepianist. He was one of the most famous musicians of his time. Henri-Montan Berton, son of Pierre, is principally remembered as a composer of operas, most of which were first performed at the Op√©ra-Comique. Ch√©lard earned his living for much of his career as a violist at the Paris Opera. His 1827 opera Macbeth was a flop in Paris, but a great success in Munich. Jeanne-Hippolyte Devismes married the director of the Paris Op√©ra. Her only known works are a song, \\"La Dame Jacinthe\\", and an opera, Praxitƒóle, which was a success and ran for 16 performances. Harpsichordist and composer Jacques Duphly contributed to Jean-Jacques Rousseau dictionary, for articles relating to the art of playing the harpsichord. =Romantic era= One of the major French composers of the time, and one of the most innovative composers of the early Romantic era, was Hector Berlioz. In the late 19th century, pioneers such as Georges Bizet, Jules Massenet, Gabriel Faur√©, Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy revitalized French music. The last two had an enormous impact on 20th-century music - both in France and abroad - and influenced many major composers such as B√©la Bart√≥k and Igor Stravinsky. Erik Satie was also a very significant composer from that era. His music is difficult to classify. Petits Chanteurs de Passy composed by Gabriel Faure. =20th century= The early 20th century saw neo-classical music flourish in France, especially composers such as Lili Boulanger, Nadia Boulanger, Albert Roussel and Les Six, a group of musicians who gathered around Satie. Later in the century, Olivier Messiaen, Henri Dutilleux and Pierre Boulez proved influential. The latter was a leading figure of Serialism while Messiaen incorporated Asian (particularly Indian) influences and bird song and Dutilleux translated the innovations of Debussy, Bart√≥k and Stravinsky into his own, very personal, musical idiom. The most important French contribution to musical innovation of the past 35 years is a form of computer-assisted composition called \\"spectral music\\". The astonishing technical advances of the spectralist composers in the 1970s are only recently beginning to achieve wide recognition in the United States; major composers in this vein include G√©rard Grisey, Tristan Murail, and Claude Vivier. Since 1998, musical works patented by Ren√©-Louis Baron made a significant step in the two domains of algorithmic music and artificial intelligence. Folk music Traditional styles of music have survived most in remote areas such as the island of Corsica and mountainous Auvergne, as well as the more nationalistic regions of the Basques and the Bretons. In many cases, folk traditions were revived in relatively recent years to cater to tourists. These groupes folkloriques tend to focus on very early 20th-century melodies and the use of the piano accordion. =Paris= In 1900 in Paris, a new style of waltz emerged, the \\"Valse musette\\" an evolution of Bal-musette also known as \\"French Waltz\\". Aimable, √âmile Vacher, Marcel Azzola, Yvette Horner, Andr√© Verchuren were famous accordionists who played valse musette. There is also Yann Tiersen and its Am√©lie (soundtrack) of Am√©lie from Montmartre. =West France= The West of France comprises the Pays de Nantes, the provinces of Vend√©e, Anjou and Maine, and the Poitou-Charentes region. Traditions of ballad-singing, dance-songs and fiddle-playing have survived, predominantly in Poitou and the Vend√©e. J√©r√¥me Bujeaud collected extensively in the area, and his 2-volume work \\"Chants et chansons populaires des provinces de l'ouest: Poitou, Saintonge, Aunis et Angoumois\\" (Niort, 1866) remains the principal scholarly collection of music and songs. In recent decades John Wright and Claude Ribouillault (amongst others) have done much to collect, analyse and promote the surviving traditions. The Marais Breton of Vend√©e is noted particularly for its tradition of veuze playing - which has been revived by the bagpipe-maker and player Thierry Bertrand - and for traditional singers such as Pierre Burgaud. Folk dances specific to the West of France include the courante, or maraichine, and the bal saintongeais. Bourr√©es in triple time have been noted in the 19th century by Bujeaud, and more recently, in Angoumois. Circle- or chain-dances accompanied by caller- and-response singing have been noted in the West, and also in other regions such as Gascony, Normandy and Brittany. Notable contemporary folk musicians include Christian Pacher and Claude Ribouillault (Poitou) and the group La Marienne (Vend√©e.) Brittany Alan Stivell, a Celtic musician and singer. Distinctly Celtic in character, the folk music of Lower Brittany has had perhaps the most successful revival of its traditions, partly thanks to the city of Lorient, which hosts France's most popular music festival: Festival Interceltique de Lorient. The documented history of Breton music begins with the publication of Barzaz-Breizh in 1839. A collection of folk songs compiled by Hersart de la Villemarqu√©, Barzaz-Breizh re-branded and promoted Breton traditions and helped ensure their continuity. Sonneurs couples, consisting of a bombard and a biniou (bagpipe), is usually played at festo√π-noz (Fest Noz) celebrations (some are famous, such as Printemps de Chateauneuf). It is swift dance music and has an older vocal counterpart called kan ha diskan. Unaccompanied call and response singing was interspersed with the gwerz, a form of ballad. Probably the most popular form of Breton folk is the bagad pipe band, which features native instruments such as biniou and bombard alongside drums and, in more modern groups, biniou braz pipes. Modern revivalists include Kevrenn Alre Bagad and Bagad Kemper. Alan Stivell is perhaps the most influential folk-rock performer of continental Europe. After 1971's Renaissance of the Celtic Harp, Breton and other Celtic traditional music achieved mainstream success internationally. With Dan Ar Braz, he then released Chemins de Terre (1974), which launched Breton folk- rock. This set the stage for stars such as Malicorne in the ensuing decades. In later years much has been done to collect and popularize the musical traditions of the Pays Gallo of Upper Brittany, for which the singer Bertran √îbr√©e, his group √îbr√©e Alie and the association DASTUM must take much credit. The songs of Upper Brittany are either in French or in Gallo. Modern Breton folk music includes harpists such as Anne-Marie Jan, Anne Auffret and Myrdhin, while singers Kristen Nikolas, Andrea Ar Gouilh and Yann-Fanch Kemener have become mainstream stars. Instrumental bands, however, have been the most successful, including Gwerz, Bleizi Ruz, Strobinell, Sonerien Du and Tud. =Central France= Central France includes the regions of Auvergne, Limousin, Morvan, Nivernais, Bourbonnais and Berry. The lands are the home to a significant bagpipe tradition, as well as the iconic hurdy-gurdy and the dance bourr√©e. There are deep differences between the regions of Central France, with the Auvergne and Limousin retained the most vibrant folk traditions of the area. As an example of the area's diversity, the bourr√©e can come in either duple or triple meter; the latter is found in the south of the region, and is usually improvised with bagpipes and hurdy-gurdy, while the former is found in the north and includes virtuoso players. Bagpipe and Hurdy-gurdy The hurdy-gurdy, or vielle-√†-roue, is essentially a mechanical violin, with keys or buttons instead of a fingerboard. It is made up of a curved, oval body, a set of keys and a curved handle, which is turned and connected to a wheel which bows the strings that are stopped by the keys. There is a moveable bridge, a variable number of drones and optional sympathetic strings. Other forms of the hurdy-gurdy are found all over Europe. The bagpipe is found in a wide array of forms in France. The cabrette and grande cornemuse from Auvergne and Berry are best known. These forms are found at least as far back as the 17th century. Prominent bagpipers include Bernard Blanc, Fr√©d√©ric Paris and Philippe Prieur, as well as bandleader Jean Blanchard of La Grande Bande de Cornemuses and Quintette de Cornemuses. Fr√©d√©ric Paris is also known as a member of the Duo Chabenat-Paris, who use elements such as mixed polyphonic ensembles and melodies based on the bourr√©e. Bernard Blanc and Jean Blanchard, along with √âric Montbel from Lyon, were among the musicians who formed the basis of La Bamboche and Le Grand Rouge. It was these two bands who did more than anyone to revitalize the traditions of Central France during the 1970s folk revival. The festival of St. Chartier, a music festival held annually near Ch√¢teauroux, has been a focal point for the music of Auvergne and Limousin. The regions of Morvan and Nivernais have produced some traditional stars, including Faubourg de Boignard and Les M√©n√©triers du Morvan, respectively. The Nivernais collector Achille Millien was also notable in the early part of the 20th century. =South France= Basque Country The music of the French Basque Country (east of the Basque Country) should be considered against a Pyrenean cultural background. Up to recent times and still ttun-ttun and xirula should be highlighted in traditional folk music (especially in the province of Soule) as a tabor and pipe like pair. Mixel Etxekopar or Jean Mixel Bedaxagar have played a major role in Basque traditional music as xirula players as well as traditional singers. Other popular performers such as Benat Achiary take on a more experimental approach. These performers refer to a former tradition collected and restored by figures such as Etxahun Iruri (1908‚Äì1979) where singing improviser poets (bertsolaris) played an important role in popular culture. This bertsolari tradition relies almost exclusively on younger generations, and efforts are being made now to restore it along the lines of the \\"southern\\" tradition, i.e. of the Spanish Basque Country. Music from the Basque Country nowadays caters to almost all the tastes of music, with a wide range of music being played in Basque, from choral music (Oldarra in Biarritz) to elaborate music bands (e.g. Bidaia) to ska or hardcore trends, while it's much praised lately for the fine bare voices that have arisen with the likes of Maddi Oihenart, Maialen Errotabehere or Amaren Alabak, to mention but a few. Corsica Corsican polyphonic singing is perhaps the most unusual of the French regional music varieties. Sung by male trios, it is strongly harmonic and occasionally dissonant. Works can be either spiritual or secular. Modern groups include Canta u Populu Corsu, I Muvrini, Tavagna and Chjami Aghjalesi; some groups have been associated with Corsican nationalism. Corsican musical instruments include the caramusa (cornemuse bagpipe), cetera (16-stringed lute), mandulina (mandolin), pifana (a type of gemshorn) and urganettu (diatonic accordion). Popular music Poster from the cabaret Moulin Rouge in Paris (1890), the spiritual birthplace of the French Cancan dance. The 19th century saw the apogee of the Cabaret style with Yvette Guilbert as a major star. The era lasted through to the 1930s and saw the likes of √âdith Piaf, Charles Trenet, Maurice Chevalier, Tino Rossi, F√©lix Mayol, Lucienne Boyer, Marie-Louise Damien, Marie Dubas, Fr√©hel, Georges Guibourg and Jean Sablon. During the 50s and 60s, it was the golden age of Chanson Fran√ßaise: Juliette Gr√©co, Mireille Mathieu, Georges Brassens, Jacques Brel, Gilbert B√©caud, Monique Serf (Barbara), L√©o Ferr√©, Charles Aznavour and Alain Barri√®re. The Y√©y√© style was popular in the 1950s and 60s with Sheila, Claude Fran√ßois and Fran√ßoise Hardy. =Musette= Musette is a style of French music and dance that became popular in Paris in the 1880s. Musette uses the accordion as main instrument, and often symbolizes the French art of living abroad. √âmile Vacher (1883-1969) was the star of the new style.World Music: Africa, Europe and the Middle East Page 113 Simon Broughton, Mark Ellingham, Richard Trillo - 1999 \\"Emile Vacher Once the accordion took over from the cabrette in the bals- musette, Vacher (1883-1969) was the star of the new style.\\" Other popular musette accordionists include Aimable Pluchard, Yvette Horner and Andr√© Verchuren. In 2001, the musette-style was a huge international success through the album Am√©lie composed by Yann Tiersen. =Cancan= The Cancan, also called French-Cancan, is a high-energy and physically demanding musical dance, traditionally performed by a chorus line of female dancers who wear costumes with long skirts, petticoats, and black stockings. The main features of the dance are the lifting and manipulation of the skirts, with high kicking and suggestive, provocative body movements. The Infernal Galop from Jacques Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld is the tune most associated with the Cancan. The Cancan first appeared in the working-class ballrooms of Montparnasse in Paris in around 1830. It was a more lively version of the Galop, a dance in quick 2/4 time, which often featured as the final figure in the Quadrille. =Cabaret= Cabaret is a typical form of French musical entertainment featuring chanson, music, dance, comedy and spectacles. The audience usually sits at tables, often dining or drinking, and performances are sometimes introduced by a master of ceremonies. The first cabaret was opened in 1881 in Montmartre, Paris, by Rodolphe Salis and was called Le Chat Noir (The Black Cat). Built in 1889, Moulin Rouge is famous for the large red windmill on its roof. Other popular French cabarets include the Folies Berg√®re and Le Lido. Cabarets were a key venue in the careers of many singers such as Mistinguett, Josephine Baker, Charles Trenet and Edith Piaf. More recently, Patricia Kaas embodies the revival of the French cabaret style. Patricia Kaas, incarnation of the new French cabaret spirit. =Chanson= Chanson Fran√ßaise is the typical style of French music (chanson means \\"song\\" in French) and is still very popular in France. Some of the most important artists included: √âdith Piaf, Juliette Gr√©co, Mireille Mathieu, Jacques Brel, Georges Brassens, Gilbert B√©caud, Monique Serf (Barbara), L√©o Ferr√©, Charles Aznavour, Salvatore Adamo and Dalida plus the more art-house musicians like Brigitte Fontaine. Also during the 1950s one of the more representative of Montmartre cabaret singers was Suzanne Robert. Dalida in 1961 During the 1970s, new artists modernized the chanson Fran√ßaise (Michel Fugain, Renaud, Francis Cabrel, Alain Souchon, Jacques Higelin, Alain Chamfort, Joe Dassin) and also in the 80s (√âtienne Daho, T√™tes Raides) till now (Benjamin Biolay, Zaz, Vincent Delerm, B√©nabar, Jean-Louis Murat, Miossec, Juliette, Mano Solo, Jacques Higelin, Matthieu Chedid, Mathieu Boogaerts, Daniel Darc, Maurane, Christina Goh, Renan Luce). Singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg began as a jazz musician in the 1950s and spanned several eras of French popular music including pop, rock, reggae, new wave, disco and even hip hop. Le Petit Guignol (about a puppet show) performed by L√ñhstana David. =Y√©y√©= Y√©y√© is a style of popular music that emerged from France in the early 1960s. The y√©-y√© movement had its origins in the radio programme Salut les copains, which was first aired in October 1959. Most famous Y√©y√© stars include Johnny Hallyday, Eddy Mitchell, Richard Anthony, Dick Rivers and the popular girls such as France Gall, Sheila, Sylvie Vartan, and artists who fuse various music genres such as Chantal Goya, Dalida or Claude Fran√ßois. These were popular female teen idols, and included Fran√ßoise Hardy, who was the first to write her own songs. Contemporary music =Nouvelle Chanson= =Jazz= =Pop= The more commercial and pop part of Chanson is called Vari√©t√© in French, and included Vanessa Paradis, Patricia Kaas, Patrick Bruel, Marc Lavoine, Pascal Obispo, Florent Pagny, Francis Cabrel, √âtienne Daho, Alain Souchon, Laurent Voulzy and Jean-Jacques Goldman. The superstar status of diva Myl√®ne Farmer inspired pop- rock performers such as Zazie, Lorie, Aliz√©e, and R&B; singers like N√¢diya and Ophelie Winter. More recently, the success of musical television shows have spawned a new generation of young pop-music stars including Nolwenn Leroy, Gr√©gory Lemarchal, Christophe Willem, Julien Dor√© and √âlodie Fr√©g√©. The French-Caribbean singer Shy'm enjoys a status of popstar in France since her first album in 2006, as well as her male counterpart Matt Pokora. Notable pop- rock groups include Niagara and Indochine. Michel Sardou is also known for his love songs (\\"La maladie d'amour\\", \\"Je vais t'aimer\\"). =Rock= Christian Andreu of Gojira, one of the most famous French metal bands. Though rock was not extremely popular until the 70s, there were innovative musicians in France as the psychedelic rock trend was peaking worldwide. Jean-Pierre Massiera's Les Maledictus Sound (1968) and Aphrodite's Child's 666 were the most influential. Later came bands such as Magma, Martin Circus, Au Bonheur des Dames, Trust, T√©l√©phone, Noir D√©sir, and guitarist and singer Paul Personne. In the early 70s, Breton musician Alan Stivell (Renaissance de la Harpe Celtique) launched the field of French folk-rock by combining psychedelic and progressive rock sounds with Breton and Celtic folk styles. Progressive Rock France became one of the leading producers of prog rock in the 1970s. Aficionados worldwide were enamoured by recordings such as Ange's Le Cimetiere des arlequins, Pulsar's Halloween, Shylock's Ile de Fievre, Atoll's L'Araignee-Mal and Eskaton's Ardeur. Most well-known, however, may be the band Magma which created its own genre, Zeuhl music. Eighties Rock (1980) In the 1980s, French rock spawned myriad styles, many closely connected with other Francophone musical scenes in Switzerland, Canada and especially Belgium. Pub rock (Telephone), psychobilly (La Muerte), pop punk (Les Thugs), synthpop and punk rock (B√©rurier Noir, Bijou and Gill Dougherty) were among the styles represented in this era. Beginning in the 1980s, Les Rita Mitsouko became very popular throughout Europe with their unique blending of punk, new wave, dance and cabaret elements. Punk rock had arisen in the 1970s and continued into the next decade, perhaps best represented by Oberkampf and M√©tal Urbain. 80s progressive rock peaked early in the decade, with Dun's Eros, Emeraude's Geoffroy and Terpandre's Terpandre, all from 1981, representing the genre's pinnacle. =Metal= French heavy metal bands include Gojira, Dagoba, Anorexia Nervosa, Hacride, Eths, Loudblast, Carcariass, Massacra, Gorod, Kronos, Yyrkoon, Benighted, Necrowretch, and Fairyland. Many of these bands play in the death metal and/or thrash metal styles. France also has a large black metal movement, including, Belenos, Deathspell Omega, Nocturnal Depression, Blut Aus Nord, Peste Noire, Vorkreist, Arkhon Infaustus, Merrimack and Antaeus, and the organization known as Les L√©gions Noires made up of such bands as M√ºtiilation, Vlad Tepes and Torgeist. The 'shoegaze' black metal movement also has many bands hailing from France, such as Alcest, Les Discrets and Amesoeurs. Daft Punk in Miami, FL. =Electronic= Electronic music, as exemplified by Jean Michel Jarre and Cerrone, achieved a wide French audience. The French electro-pop duos Air and Daft Punk and techno artists Laurent Garnier and David Guetta found a wide audience in the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, both locally and internationally. Groups such as Justice, M83, Phoenix, T√©l√©popmusik and Klingande continue to enjoy success. =Dance= In 2009, David Guetta sold more albums outside France than any other French artist. Quels sont nos artistes les mieux export√©s en 2009 ? - Charts in France French house is a late 1990s form of house music, part of the 1990s and first decade of the 21st-century European dance music scene and the latest form of Euro disco. The genre is also known as \\"Disco house\\", \\"Neu-disco\\" (new disco), \\"French touch\\", \\"filter house\\" or \\"tekfunk\\". The early mid/late 1990s productions was notable for the \\"filter effect\\" used by artists such as Daft Punk.village voice > music > Daft Punk by Scott Woods Other productions use more mainstream vocals and samples. French house is greatly influenced by the 1970s Euro disco and especially the short lived space disco music style (a European (mostly French) variation of Hi-NRG disco), and also by P-Funk and the productions of Thomas Bangalter The first French house experiments (at the time called \\"disco house\\" and \\"neu disco\\") became notable in the international market between 1997 and 1999. Daft Punk, Stardust and Cassius were the first international successful artists of the genre and their videos show their \\"space disco\\" roots. Several artists played important roles in popularizing the genre, which, in 2000, achieved international success. Bob Sinclar's single \\"I Feel For You\\" charted in several countries, including Germany, Italy, and Spain. Etienne de Cr√©cy's album Tempovision charted at #57 in France and included the successful single \\"Am I Wrong.\\" In September, the French house group Modjo released \\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight), which debuted at #1 in the UK and became a top-ten hit in thirteen countries. Galleon followed the next year. Today most French house bands and artists have moved on to other music styles, notably a French variation of electro, that is danced on the milky way/Tecktonik style. =Disco= The Village People, co-founded by the two French composers Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo, was a major international disco group. Notable French disco singers also include Dalida, Sheila and B. Devotion, Ottawan, Cerrone, Patrick Hernandez and F.R. David, respectively known for their worldwide hits Monday, Tuesday... Laissez-moi danser (1979), Spacer (1979), D.I.S.C.O. (1979), You're OK / T'es OK (1980), Supernature (1977), Born to Be Alive (1979) and Words (1982). =Hip-Hop= Hip hop music was exported to France in the 1980s, and French rappers and DJs such as David Guetta and MC Solaar, also had some success. Hip hop music came from New York City, invented in the 1970s by African Americans. By 1983, the genre had spread to much of the world, including France. Almost immediately, French performers (musicians and breakdancers) began their career, including Max-Laure Bourjolly and Traction Avant. Popularity was brief, however, and hip hop quickly receded to the French underground. Hip-hop was adapted to French context, especially the poverty of large cities known as banlieues (\\"suburbs\\") where many French of foreign descent live, especially from the former colonial countries (West Africa and Caribbean). If there is some influence of African musics and of course American hip hop, French hip-hop is also strongly connected to French music, with strong reciprocal influences, from French pop and chanson, both in music and lyrics. Paname City Rappin (1984, by Dee Nasty) was the first album released, and the first major stars were IAM, Supr√™me NTM and MC Solaar, whose 1991 Qui S√®me le Vent R√©colte le Tempo, was a major hit. Through the nineties, the music grew to become one of the most popular genres in France with huge success of the pioneers (IAM, Supr√™me NTM) and newcomers (Minist√®re Amer, Oxmo Puccino, Lunatic). France is the world's second-largest hip-hop market. The most popular rappers of the 2000s are Diam's, Booba and Kenza Farah with successful artists more underground such as La Rumeur, la Caution and TTC. Music of Martinique and Guadeloupe =Zouk= Zouk is a fast jump-up carnival beat originating from the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, popularized by the French Antillean band Kassav' in the 1980s. Very rapid in tempo, the style lost ground in the 1980s due to the strong presence of kadans or compas, the main music of the French Antilles. Today, zouk is the French Antilles compas,Peter Manuel, Musics of the Non- Western World, Chicago press University 1988p74 also called zouk-love In Africa, Kassav's zouk and the Haitian compas they featured, gained popularity in francophone and lusophone countries. It is also particularly popular in North America in the Canadian province of Quebec. =Bouyon= Bouyon (Boo- Yon) is a form of popular music of Dominica, also known as jump up music in Guadeloupe and Martinique. The best-known band in the genre is Windward Caribbean Kulture (WCK), who originated the style in 1988. Over the years, thanks to inter-trade with the Dominicans and the mass participation of Guadeloupe at the World Creole Music Festival, the flagship group as Triple kay and MFR band began to democratize and local artists were inducted including the remix Allo Triple kay with Daly and \\"Big Ting Poppin 'Daly alone. A popular offshoot within the bouyon is call bouyon hardcore, a style characterized by its lewd and violent lyrics. Popular Bouyon gwada musicians include, Wee Low, Suppa, Doc J, Yellow gaza, etc. =French Antilles hip hop= The French Antilles hip hop is a style of hip hop music originating from the French departments of Guadeloupe and Martinique in the Caribbean. Usually in French and Antillean creole, the French Antilles hip hop is most popular in the French Antilles and France. Overseas music upaupa, a traditional dance from Tahiti (1900). ;French Polynesia ;R√©union island S√©ga music is a popular style that mixes African and European music. The most popular sega musicians include Ousanousava, Baster, Maxime Laope. Maloya music has a strong African element reflected in the use of slave chants and work songs. The most popular sega musicians include Dany√®l Waro, Firmin Viry, Granmoun L√©l√©, Mars tou s√®l. International music Jacques Brel. French language is spoken worldwide and many international artists contribute to French music. =Europe= The greatest Belgian chansonnier was Jacques Brel, whose classic songs have been covered by several international artists. Others such as Salvatore Adamo, Axelle Red, Lara Fabian, Maurane, Selah Sue, Fr√©d√©ric Fran√ßois and Annie Cordy have also enjoyed some success in France and other French-speaking countries. =America= Quebec singers are very popular in France, and both nations have influenced each other in terms of music styles. Quebec artists have been taking the French stage quite extensively. Notable singers that have performed in France included: C√©line Dion, Diane Tell, C≈ìur de pirate, Garou, Isabelle Boulay, Lynda Lemay and many others. Roch Voisine and Natasha St-Pier, who are of Acadian heritage, reached the top of charts in France with their famous songs \\"H√©l√®ne\\" (1989) and \\"Tu trouveras\\" (2002). Rock singer Avril Lavigne, whose father is of French origin (born in Lorraine), is also popular in France, and she obtained her French passport and citizenship in 2011.Lavigne means \\"Vineyard\\", and Avril means \\"April\\", in French language Anggun during her concert in Le Trianon, Paris (2012). Salvatore Adamo and Charles Aznavour are widely recognized in America =Asia= One of the most famous French-speaking Asian artists is Anggun, a French-naturalised singer from Indonesia, best known for her single La Neige au Sahara (Snow on the Sahara) written by Erick Benzi. The song was released in 1997 as her debut international single in 33 countries worldwide, and made the charts in Europe (#1 in Italy), America (#16 in USA Billboard), and Asia (#1 in Indonesia, #3 in Malaysia). French music also found surprising favorable reception in Japan, where the language and culture from France is often seen as romantic. Some Japanese groups use the French language, such as Malice Mizer or Versailles, named after the Ch√¢teau de Versailles. Salvatore Adamo Charles Aznavour and Mireille Mathieu are widely recognized in Japan. =Africa= Beginning in the 1920s, Ra√Ø music developed in Algeria as a combination of rural and urban music. Often viewed as a form of resistance towards censorship, many of the conventional values of the old ra√Ø became modernized with instruments, synthesizers and modern equipment. Later performers added influences from funk, hip hop, rock and other styles, creating most notably a pop genre called lover's ra√Ø. Performers include Rachid Taha and Faudel. Originating of the city of Oran, ra√Ø shot to the top of the French, Swiss and Dutch charts in 1992 with the release of Khaled's single Didi.

The conjectures concern the generating functions (known as local zeta-functions) derived from counting the number of points on algebraic varieties over finite fields. A variety over a finite field with elements has a finite number of rational points (with coordinates in the original field), as well as points with coordinates in any finite extension of the original field. The generating function has coefficients derived from the numbers of points over the extension field with elements. Weil conjectured that such zeta-functions for smooth varieties should be rational functions, should satisfy a form of functional equation, and should have their zeroes in restricted places. The last two parts were quite consciously modeled on the Riemann zeta function, a kind of generating function for prime integers, which obeys a functional equation and (conjecturally) has its zeroes restricted by the Riemann hypothesis. The rationality was proved by , the functional equation by , and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis by . Background and history The earliest antecedent of the Weil conjectures is by Carl Friedrich Gauss and appears in section VII of his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae , concerned with roots of unity and Gaussian periods. In article 358, he moves on from the periods that build up towers of quadratic extensions, for the construction of regular polygons; and assumes that is a prime number such that is divisible by 3. Then there is a cyclic cubic field inside the cyclotomic field of th roots of unity, and a normal integral basis of periods for the integers of this field (an instance of the Hilbert‚ÄìSpeiser theorem). Gauss constructs the order-3 periods, corresponding to the cyclic group of non-zero residues modulo under multiplication and its unique subgroup of index three. Gauss lets \\\\mathfrak{R}, \\\\mathfrak{R}', and \\\\mathfrak{R} be its cosets. Taking the periods (sums of roots of unity) corresponding to these cosets applied to , he notes that these periods have a multiplication table that is accessible to calculation. Products are linear combinations of the periods, and he determines the coefficients. He sets, for example, (\\\\mathfrak{R}\\\\mathfrak{R}) equal to the number of elements of which are in \\\\mathfrak{R} and which, after being increased by one, are also in \\\\mathfrak{R}. He proves that this number and related ones are the coefficients of the products of the periods. To see the relation of these sets to the Weil conjectures, notice that if and are both in \\\\mathfrak{R}, then there exist and in such that and ; consequently, . Therefore (\\\\mathfrak{R}\\\\mathfrak{R}) is the number of solutions to in the finite field . The other coefficients have similar interpretations. Gauss's determination of the coefficients of the products of the periods therefore counts the number of points on these elliptic curves, and as a byproduct he proves the analog of the Riemann hypothesis. The Weil conjectures in the special case of algebraic curves were conjectured by . The case of curves over finite fields was proved by Weil, finishing the project started by Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves over finite fields. Their interest was obvious enough from within number theory: they implied upper bounds for exponential sums, a basic concern in analytic number theory . What was really eye- catching, from the point of view of other mathematical areas, was the proposed connection with algebraic topology. Given that finite fields are discrete in nature, and topology speaks only about the continuous, the detailed formulation of Weil (based on working out some examples) was striking and novel. It suggested that geometry over finite fields should fit into well- known patterns relating to Betti numbers, the Lefschetz fixed-point theorem and so on. The analogy with topology suggested that a new homological theory be set up applying within algebraic geometry. This took two decades (it was a central aim of the work and school of Alexander Grothendieck) building up on initial suggestions from Serre. The rationality part of the conjectures was proved first by , using -adic methods. and his collaborators established the rationality conjecture, the functional equation and the link to Betti numbers by using the properties of √©tale cohomology, a new cohomology theory developed by Grothendieck and Artin for attacking the Weil conjectures, as outlined in . Of the four conjectures the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was the hardest to prove. Motivated by the proof of of an analogue of the Weil conjectures for K√§hler manifolds, Grothendieck envisioned a proof based on his standard conjectures on algebraic cycles . However, Grothendieck's standard conjectures remain open (except for the hard Lefschetz theorem, which was proved by Deligne by extending his work on the Weil conjectures), and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was proved by , using the √©tale cohomology theory but circumventing the use of standard conjectures by an ingenious argument. found and proved a generalization of the Weil conjectures, bounding the weights of the pushforward of a sheaf. Statement of the Weil conjectures Suppose that is a non-singular -dimensional projective algebraic variety over the field with elements. The zeta function of is by definition :\\\\zeta(X, s) = \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\sum_{m = 1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{N_m}{m} q^{-ms}\\\\right) where is the number of points of defined over the degree extension of . The Weil conjectures state: 1. (Rationality) is a rational function of . More precisely, can be written as a finite alternating product :\\\\prod_{i=0}^{2n} P_i(q^{-s})^{(-1)^{i+1}} = \\\\frac{P_1(T)\\\\dotsb P_{2n-1}(T)}{P_0(T)\\\\dotsb P_{2n}(T)}, where each is an integral polynomial. Furthermore, , , and for , factors over as \\\\textstyle\\\\prod_j (1 - \\\\alpha_{ij}T) for some numbers . 2. (Functional equation and Poincar√© duality) The zeta function satisfies :\\\\zeta(X,n-s)=\\\\pm q^{\\\\frac{nE}{2}-Es}\\\\zeta(X,s) or equivalently :\\\\zeta(X,q^{-n}T^{-1})=\\\\pm q^{\\\\frac{nE}{2}}T^E\\\\zeta(X,T) where is the Euler characteristic of . In particular, for each , the numbers , , ‚Ä¶ equal the numbers , , ‚Ä¶ in some order. 3. (Riemann hypothesis) for all and all . This implies that all zeros of lie on the \\"critical line\\" of complex numbers with real part . 4. (Betti numbers) If is a (good) \\"reduction mod \\" of a non-singular projective variety defined over a number field embedded in the field of complex numbers, then the degree of is the th Betti number of the space of complex points of . Examples =The projective line= The simplest example (other than a point) is to take to be the projective line. The number of points of over a field with elements is just (where the \\"\\" comes from the \\"point at infinity\\"). The zeta function is just :. It is easy to check all parts of the Weil conjectures directly. For example, the corresponding complex variety is the Riemann sphere and its initial Betti numbers are 1, 0, 1\\\\. =Projective space= It is not much harder to do -dimensional projective space. The number of points of over a field with elements is just . The zeta function is just :. It is again easy to check all parts of the Weil conjectures directly. (Complex projective space gives the relevant Betti numbers, which nearly determine the answer.) The number of points on the projective line and projective space are so easy to calculate because they can be written as disjoint unions of a finite number of copies of affine spaces. It is also easy to prove the Weil conjectures for other spaces, such as Grassmannians and flag varieties, which have the same \\"paving\\" property. =Elliptic curves= These give the first non-trivial cases of the Weil conjectures (proved by Hasse). If is an elliptic curve over a finite field with elements, then the number of points of defined over the field with elements is , where and are complex conjugates with absolute value . The zeta function is : . Weil cohomology Weil suggested that the conjectures would follow from the existence of a suitable \\"Weil cohomology theory\\" for varieties over finite fields, similar to the usual cohomology with rational coefficients for complex varieties. His idea was that if is the Frobenius automorphism over the finite field, then the number of points of the variety over the field of order is the number of fixed points of (acting on all points of the variety defined over the algebraic closure). In algebraic topology the number of fixed points of an automorphism can be worked out using the Lefschetz fixed point theorem, given as an alternating sum of traces on the cohomology groups. So if there were similar cohomology groups for varieties over finite fields, then the zeta function could be expressed in terms of them. The first problem with this is that the coefficient field for a Weil cohomology theory cannot be the rational numbers. To see this consider the case of a supersingular elliptic curve over a finite field of characteristic . The endomorphism ring of this is an order in a quaternion algebra over the rationals, and should act on the first cohomology group, which should be a 2-dimensional vector space over the coefficient field by analogy with the case of a complex elliptic curve. However a quaternion algebra over the rationals cannot act on a 2-dimensional vector space over the rationals. The same argument eliminates the possibility of the coefficient field being the reals or the -adic numbers, because the quaternion algebra is still a division algebra over these fields. However it does not eliminate the possibility that the coefficient field is the field of -adic numbers for some prime , because over these fields the division algebra splits and becomes a matrix algebra, which can act on a 2-dimensional vector space. Grothendieck and Michael Artin managed to construct suitable cohomology theories over the field of -adic numbers for each prime , called -adic cohomology. Grothendieck's proofs of three of the four conjectures By the end of 1964 Grothendieck together with Artin and Jean-Louis Verdier (and the earlier 1960 work by Dwork) proved the Weil conjectures apart from the most difficult third conjecture above (the \\"Riemann hypothesis\\" conjecture) (Grothendieck 1965). The general theorems about √©tale cohomology allowed Grothendieck to prove an analogue of the Lefschetz fixed point formula for the l-adic cohomology theory, and by applying it to the Frobenius automorphism F he was able to prove the conjectured formula for the zeta function: :\\\\zeta(s)=\\\\frac{P_1(T)\\\\cdots P_{2n-1}(T)}{P_0(T)P_2(T)\\\\cdots P_{2n}(T)} where each polynomial Pi is the determinant of I ‚àí TF on the l-adic cohomology group Hi. The rationality of the zeta function follows immediately. The functional equation for the zeta function follows from Poincar√© duality for l-adic cohomology, and the relation with complex Betti numbers of a lift follows from a comparison theorem between l-adic and ordinary cohomology for complex varieties. More generally, Grothendieck proved a similar formula for the zeta function (or \\"generalized L-function\\") of a sheaf F0: :Z(X_0, F_0, t) = \\\\prod_{x\\\\in X_0}\\\\det(1-F^*_xt^{\\\\deg(x)}F_0)^{-1} as a product over cohomology groups: :Z(X_0, F_0, t) = \\\\prod_{i}\\\\det(1-F^* tH^i_c(F))^{(-1)^{i+1}} The special case of the constant sheaf gives the usual zeta function. Deligne's first proof of the Riemann hypothesis conjecture , , and gave expository accounts of the first proof of . Much of the background in l-adic cohomology is described in . Deligne's first proof of the remaining third Weil conjecture (the \\"Riemann hypothesis conjecture\\") used the following steps: =Use of Lefschetz pencils= *Grothendieck expressed the zeta function in terms of the trace of Frobenius on l-adic cohomology groups, so the Weil conjectures for a d-dimensional variety V over a finite field with q elements depend on showing that the eigenvalues Œ± of Frobenius acting on the ith l-adic cohomology group Hi(V) of V have absolute values =qi/2 (for an embedding of the algebraic elements of Ql into the complex numbers). *After blowing up V and extending the base field, one may assume that the variety V has a morphism onto the projective line P1, with a finite number of singular fibers with very mild (quadratic) singularities. The theory of monodromy of Lefschetz pencils, introduced for complex varieties (and ordinary cohomology) by , and extended by and to l-adic cohomology, relates the cohomology of V to that of its fibers. The relation depends on the space Ex of vanishing cycles, the subspace of the cohomology Hd‚àí1(Vx) of a non- singular fiber Vx, spanned by classes that vanish on singular fibers. *The Leray spectral sequence relates the middle cohomology group of V to the cohomology of the fiber and base. The hard part to deal with is more or less a group H1(P1, j*E) = H(U,E), where U is the points the projective line with non-singular fibers, and j is the inclusion of U into the projective line, and E is the sheaf with fibers the spaces Ex of vanishing cycles. =The key estimate= The heart of Deligne's proof is to show that the sheaf E over U is pure, in other words to find the absolute values of the eigenvalues of Frobenius on its stalks. This is done by studying the zeta functions of the even powers Ek of E and applying Grothendieck's formula for the zeta functions as alternating products over cohomology groups. The crucial idea of considering even k powers of E was inspired by the paper , who used a similar idea with k=2 for bounding the Ramanujan tau function. pointed out that a generalization of Rankin's result for higher even values of k would imply the Ramanujan conjecture, and Deligne realized that in the case of zeta functions of varieties, Grothendieck's theory of zeta functions of sheaves provided an analogue of this generalization. *The poles of the zeta function of Ek are found using Grothendieck's formula ::Z(U,E^k,T) = \\\\frac{\\\\det(1-F^* TH^1_c(E^k))}{\\\\det(1-F^* TH^0_c(E^k))\\\\det(1-F^* TH^2_c(E^k))} :and calculating the cohomology groups in the denominator explicitly. The H term is usually just 1 as U is usually not compact, and the H can be calculated explicitly as follows. Poincar√© duality relates H(Ek) to H(Ek), which is in turn the space of covariants of the monodromy group, which is the geometric fundamental group of U acting on the fiber of Ek at a point. The fiber of E has a bilinear form induced by cup product, which is antisymmetric if d is even, and makes E into a symplectic space. (This is a little inaccurate: Deligne did later show that E‚à©E‚ä• = 0 by using the hard Lefschetz theorem, this requires the Weil conjectures, and the proof of the Weil conjectures really has to use a slightly more complicated argument with E/E‚à©E‚ä• rather than E.) An argument of Kazhdan and Margulis shows that the image of the monodromy group acting on E, given by the Picard‚ÄìLefschetz formula, is Zariski dense in a symplectic group and therefore has the same invariants, which are well known from classical invariant theory. Keeping track of the action of Frobenius in this calculation shows that its eigenvalues are all qk(d‚àí1)/2+1, so the zeta function of Z(Ek,T) has poles only at T=1/qk(d‚àí1)/2+1. *The Euler product for the zeta function of Ek is ::Z(E^k,T) = \\\\prod_x \\\\frac{1}{Z(E^k_x,T)} :If k is even then all the coefficients of the factors on the right (considered as power series in T) are non-negative; this follows by writing ::\\\\frac{1}{\\\\det(1-T^{\\\\deg(x)}F_xE^k)} =\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\sum_{n>0}\\\\frac{T^n}{n}\\\\text{Trace}(F_x^nE)^k\\\\right) :and using the fact that the traces of powers of F are rational, so their k powers are non-negative as k is even. Deligne proves the rationality of the traces by relating them to numbers of points of varieties, which are always (rational) integers. *The powers series for Z(Ek, T) converges for T less than the absolute value 1/qk(d‚àí1)/2+1 of its only possible pole. When k is even the coefficients of all its Euler factors are non-negative, so that each of the Euler factors has coefficients bounded by a constant times the coefficients of Z(Ek, T) and therefore converges on the same region and has no poles in this region. So for k even the polynomials Z(E, T) have no zeros in this region, or in other words the eigenvalues of Frobenius on the stalks of Ek have absolute value at most qk(d‚àí1)/2+1. *This estimate can be used to find the absolute value of any eigenvalue Œ± of Frobenius on a fiber of E as follows. For any integer k, Œ±k is an eigenvalue of Frobenius on a stalk of Ek, which for k even is bounded by q1+k(d‚àí1)/2. So ::\\\\alpha^k\\\\le q^{k(d-1)/2 +1} :As this is true for arbitrarily large even k, this implies that ::\\\\alpha\\\\le q^{(d-1)/2}. :Poincar√© duality then implies that ::\\\\alpha=q^{(d-1)/2}. =Completion of the proof= The deduction of the Riemann hypothesis from this estimate is mostly a fairly straightforward use of standard techniques and is done as follows. *The eigenvalues of Frobenius on H(U,E) can now be estimated as they are the zeros of the zeta function of the sheaf E. This zeta function can be written as an Euler product of zeta functions of the stalks of E, and using the estimate for the eigenvalues on these stalks shows that this product converges for <q‚àíd/2‚àí1/2, so that there are no zeros of the zeta function in this region. This implies that the eigenvalues of Frobenius on E are at most qd/2+1/2 in absolute value (in fact it will soon be seen that they have absolute value exactly qd/2). This step of the argument is very similar to the usual proof that the Riemann zeta function has no zeros with real part greater than 1, by writing it as an Euler product. *The conclusion of this is that the eigenvalues Œ± of the Frobenius of a variety of even dimension d on the middle cohomology group satisfy :: \\\\alpha \\\\le q^{d/2+1/2} :To obtain the Riemann hypothesis one needs to eliminate the 1/2 from the exponent. This can be done as follows. Applying this estimate to any even power Vk of V and using the K√ºnneth formula shows that the eigenvalues of Frobenius on the middle cohomology of a variety V of any dimension d satisfy :: \\\\alpha^k \\\\le q^{kd/2+1/2} :As this is true for arbitrarily large even k, this implies that ::\\\\alpha \\\\le q^{d/2} :Poincar√© duality then implies that ::\\\\alpha = q^{d/2}. *This proves the Weil conjectures for the middle cohomology of a variety. The Weil conjectures for the cohomology below the middle dimension follow from this by applying the weak Lefschetz theorem, and the conjectures for cohomology above the middle dimension then follow from Poincar√© duality. Deligne's second proof found and proved a generalization of the Weil conjectures, bounding the weights of the pushforward of a sheaf. In practice it is this generalization rather than the original Weil conjectures that is mostly used in applications, such as the hard Lefschetz theorem. Much of the second proof is a rearrangement of the ideas of his first proof. The main extra idea needed is an argument closely related to the theorem of Jacques Hadamard and Charles Jean de la Vall√©e Poussin, used by Deligne to show that various L-series do not have zeros with real part 1. A constructible sheaf on a variety over a finite field is called pure of weight Œ≤ if for all points x the eigenvalues of the Frobenius at x all have absolute value N(x)Œ≤/2, and is called mixed of weight ‚â§Œ≤ if it can be written as repeated extensions by pure sheaves with weights ‚â§Œ≤. Deligne's theorem states that if f is a morphism of schemes of finite type over a finite field, then Rif! takes mixed sheaves of weight ‚â§Œ≤ to mixed sheaves of weight ‚â§Œ≤+i. The original Weil conjectures follow by taking f to be a morphism from a smooth projective variety to a point and considering the constant sheaf Ql on the variety. This gives an upper bound on the absolute values of the eigenvalues of Frobenius, and Poincar√© duality then shows that this is also a lower bound. In general Rif! does not take pure sheaves to pure sheaves. However it does when a suitable form of Poincar√© duality holds, for example if f is smooth and proper, or if one works with perverse sheaves rather than sheaves as in . Inspired by the work of on Morse theory, found another proof, using Deligne's l-adic Fourier transform, which allowed him to simplify Deligne's proof by avoiding the use of the method of Hadamard and de la Vall√©e Poussin.

The work was written for private performance by an ad hoc ensemble of two pianos and other instruments, and lasts around 25 minutes. History Following a disastrous concert tour of Germany in 1885‚Äì86, Saint-Sa√´ns withdrew to a small Austrian village, where he composed The Carnival of the Animals in February 1886. It is scored for two pianos, two violins, viola, cello, double bass, flute (and piccolo), clarinet (C and B), glass harmonica, and xylophone. From the beginning, Saint-Sa√´ns regarded the work as a piece of fun. On 9 February 1886, he wrote to his publishers Durand in Paris that he was composing a work for the coming Shrove Tuesday, and confessing that he knew he should be working on his Third Symphony, but that this work was \\"such fun\\" (). He had apparently intended to write the work for his students at the √âcole Niedermeyer, but it was first performed at a private concert given by the cellist Charles Lebouc on Shrove Tuesday, 9 March 1886. A second (private) performance was given on 2 April at the home of Pauline Viardot with an audience including Franz Liszt, a friend of the composer, who had expressed a wish to hear the work. There were other private performances, typically for the French mid-Lent festival of Mi-Car√™me, but Saint-Sa√´ns was adamant that the work would not be published in his lifetime, seeing it as detracting from his \\"serious\\" composer image. He relented only for the famous cello solo The Swan, which forms the penultimate movement of the work, and which was published in 1887 in an arrangement by the composer for cello and solo piano (the original uses two pianos). Saint-Sa√´ns did specify in his will that the work should be published posthumously. Following his death in December 1921, the work was published by Durand in Paris in April 1922 and the first public performance was given on 25 February 1922 by Concerts Colonne (the orchestra of √âdouard Colonne). Carnival has since become one of Saint-Sa√´ns's best-known works, played by the original eleven instruments, or more often with the full string section of an orchestra. Normally a glockenspiel substitutes for the rare glass harmonica. Ever popular with music teachers and young children, it is often recorded in combination with Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf or Britten's Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra. Movements There are fourteen movements, each representing a different animal or animals: {align=right  } = I \\"Introduction et marche royale du lion\\" (Introduction and Royal March of the Lion) = Strings and two pianos: the introduction begins with the pianos playing a bold trill, under which the strings enter with a stately theme. The pianos play a pair of glissandos going in opposite directions to conclude the first part of the movement. The pianos then introduce a march theme that they carry through most of the rest of the introduction. The strings provide the melody, with the pianos occasionally taking low chromatic scales in octaves which suggest the roar of a lion, or high ostinatos. The two groups of instruments switch places, with the pianos playing a higher, softer version of the melody. The movement ends with a fortissimo note from all the instruments used in this movement. = II \\"Poules et coqs\\" (Hens and Roosters) = Strings without cello and double bass, two pianos, with clarinet: this movement is centered around a pecking theme played in the pianos and strings, which is quite reminiscent of chickens pecking at grain. The clarinet plays a small solo above the strings. The piano plays a very fast theme based on the crowing of a rooster's Cock-a-Doodle-Doo. = III \\"H√©miones (animaux v√©loces)\\" (Wild Donkeys Swift Animals) = Two pianos: the animals depicted here are quite obviously running, an image induced by the constant, feverishly fast up-and-down motion of both pianos playing figures in octaves. These are dziggetai, donkeys that come from Tibet and are known for their great speed. = IV \\"Tortues\\" (Tortoises) = Strings and piano: a satirical movement which opens with a piano playing a pulsing triplet figure in the higher register. The strings play a slow rendition of the famous \\"Galop infernal\\" (commonly called the Can-can) from Offenbach's operetta Orph√©e aux enfers (Orpheus in the Underworld). = V \\"L'√âl√©phant\\" (The Elephant) = Double bass and piano: this section is marked Allegro pomposo, the perfect caricature for an elephant. The piano plays a waltz-like triplet figure while the bass hums the melody beneath it. Like \\"Tortues,\\" this is also a musical joke‚Äîthe thematic material is taken from the Scherzo from Mendelssohn's incidental music to A Midsummer Night's Dream and Berlioz's \\"Dance of the Sylphs\\" from The Damnation of Faust. The two themes were both originally written for high, lighter-toned instruments (flute and various other woodwinds, and violin, accordingly); the joke is that Saint-Sa√´ns moves this to the lowest and heaviest-sounding instrument in the orchestra, the double bass. = VI \\"Kangourous\\" (Kangaroos) = Two pianos: the main figure here is a pattern of \\"hopping\\" chords (made up of triads in various positions) preceded by grace notes in the right hand. When the chords ascend, they quickly get faster and louder, and when the chords descend, they quickly get slower and softer. = VII \\"Aquarium\\" = Part of the original manuscript score of \\"Aquarium\\". The top staff was written for the (glass) \\"Harmonica\\". Violins, viola, cello (string quartet), two pianos, flute, and glass harmonica: this is one of the more musically rich movements. The melody is played by the flute, backed by the strings, and glass harmonica on top of tumultuous, glissando-like runs and arpeggios in pianos. The first piano plays a descending ten-on-one, and eight-on-one ostinato, in the style of the second of Chopin's √©tudes, while the second plays a six-on-one. These figures, plus the occasional glissando from the glass harmonica towards the end‚Äîoften played on celesta or glockenspiel‚Äîare evocative of a peaceful, dimly lit aquarium. = VIII \\"Personnages √† longues oreilles\\" (Characters with Long Ears) = Two violins: this is the shortest of all the movements. The violins alternate playing high, loud notes and low, buzzing ones (in the manner of a donkey's braying \\"hee-haw\\"). Music critics have speculated that the movement is meant to compare music critics to braying donkeys. = IX \\"Le Coucou au fond des bois\\" (The Cuckoo in the Depths of the Woods) = Two pianos and clarinet: the pianos play large, soft chords while the clarinet plays a single two-note ostinato; a C and an A, mimicking the call of a cuckoo bird. Saint-Sa√´ns states in the original score that the clarinetist should be offstage. = X \\"Voli√®re\\" (Aviary) = Strings, pianos and flute: the high strings take on a background role, providing a buzz in the background that is reminiscent of the background noise of a jungle. The cellos and basses play a pickup cadence to lead into most of the measures. The flute takes the part of the bird, with a trilling tune that spans much of its range. The pianos provide occasional pings and trills of other birds in the background. The movement ends very quietly after a long ascending chromatic scale from the flute. = XI \\"Pianistes\\" (Pianists) = Strings and two pianos: this humorous movement (satirizing pianists as animals) is a glimpse of what few audiences ever get to see: the pianists practicing their finger exercises and scales. The scales of C, D, D and E are covered. Each one starts with a trill on the first and second note, then proceeds in scales with a few changes in the rhythm. Transitions between keys are accomplished with a blasting chord from all the instruments between scales. In some performances, the later, more difficult, scales are deliberately played increasingly out of time. The original edition has a note by the editors instructing the players to imitate beginners and their awkwardness.\\"Les ex√©cutants devront imiter le jeu d'un d√©butant et sa gaucherie.\\" After the four scales, the key changes back to C, where the pianos play a moderate speed trill-like pattern in thirds, in the style of Charles-Louis Hanon or Carl Czerny, while the strings play a small part underneath. This movement is unusual in that the last three blasted chords do not resolve the piece, but rather lead into the next movement. Title page to \\"Fossils\\" in the manuscript including drawing by the composer = XII \\"Fossiles\\" (Fossils) = Strings, two pianos, clarinet, and xylophone: here, Saint-Sa√´ns mimics his own composition, the Danse macabre, which makes heavy use of the xylophone to evoke the image of skeletons playing card games, the bones clacking together to the beat. The musical themes from Danse macabre are also quoted; the xylophone and the violin play much of the melody, alternating with the piano and clarinet. Allusions to \\"Ah! vous dirai-je, Maman\\" (better known in the English-speaking world as Twinkle Twinkle Little Star), the French nursery rhymes \\"Au clair de la lune\\", and \\"J'ai du bon tabac\\" (the second piano plays the same melody upside down [inversion]), the popular anthem \\"Partant pour la Syrie\\", as well as the aria \\"Una voce poco fa\\" from Rossini's The Barber of Seville can also be heard. The musical joke in this movement, according to Leonard Bernstein's narration on his recording of the work with the New York Philharmonic, is that the musical pieces quoted are the fossils of Saint-Sa√´ns's time. = XIII \\"Le cygne\\" (The Swan) = Two pianos and cello: a slowly moving cello melody (which evokes the swan elegantly gliding over the water) is played over rippling sixteenths in one piano and rolled chords in the other (said to represent the swan's feet, hidden from view beneath the water, propelling it along). A staple of the cello repertoire, this is one of the most well-known movements of the suite, usually in the version for cello with solo piano which was the only publication of this work in Saint-Sa√´ns's lifetime. More than twenty other arrangements of this movement have also been published, with solo instruments ranging from flute to alto saxophone. A short ballet, The Dying Swan, was choreographed in 1905 by Mikhail Fokine to this movement and performed by Anna Pavlova. Pavlova gave some 4,000 performances of the dance and \\"swept the world.\\" = XIV Final (Finale) = Full ensemble: the finale opens on the same trills in the pianos as in the introduction, which are soon reinforced by the wind instruments, the glass harmonica and the xylophone. The strings build the tension with a few low notes, leading to glissandi by the piano before the lively main melody is introduced. The Finale is somewhat reminiscent of an American carnival of the 19th century, with one piano always maintaining a bouncy eighth-note rhythm. Although the melody is relatively simple, the supporting harmonies are ornamented in the style that is typical of Saint-Sa√´ns' compositions for piano; dazzling scales, glissandi and trills. Many of the previous movements are quoted here from the introduction, the lion, the donkeys, hens, and kangaroos. The work ends with a series of six \\"Hee Haws\\" from the donkeys, as if to say that the donkey has the last laugh, before the final strong group of C major chords. Musical allusions As the title suggests, the work follows a zoological program and progresses from the first movement, ', through portraits of elephants and donkeys (\\"Those with Long Ears\\") to a finale reprising many of the earlier motifs. Several of the movements are of humorous intent: * ' uses the theme of Jean-Philippe Rameau's harpsichord piece ' (\\"The Hen\\") from his Suite in G major, but in a quite less elegant mood. * ' depicts piano students practicing scales. * ' makes good use of the well-known \\"Galop infernal\\" from Jacques Offenbach's operetta Orpheus in the Underworld, playing the usually breakneck-speed melody at a slow, drooping pace. * ' uses a theme from Hector Berlioz's \\"Danse des sylphes\\" (from his work The Damnation of Faust) played in a much lower register than usual as a double bass solo. The piece also quotes the Scherzo from Felix Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream. It is heard at the end of the bridge section. * ' quotes Saint-Sa√´ns' own ' as well as three nursery rhymes, \\"J'ai du bon tabac\\", (Twinkle Twinkle Little Star) and , also the song \\"Partant pour la Syrie\\" and Rossini's aria, \\"Una voce poco fa\\" from The Barber of Seville. * The ' section is thought to be directed at music critics: they are also supposedly the last animals heard during the finale, braying. Ogden Nash verses In 1949, Ogden Nash wrote a set of humorous verses to accompany each movement for a Columbia Masterworks recording of Carnival of the Animals conducted by Andre Kostelanetz. They were recited on the original album by No√´l Coward, dubbed over or spliced in between sections of the previously recorded music.http://www.discogs.com/Andr√©-Kostelanetz-And-His-Orchestra-No√´l-Coward- Ogden-Nash-Saint-Sa√´ns-Ravel-Carnival-Of-The-Anim/release/7472182 The poems are now often included when the work is performed, though usually recited before each piece. The conclusion of the verse for the \\"Fossils\\", for example, fits perfectly with the punchline-like first bar of the music: :At midnight in the museum hall :The fossils gathered for a ball :There were no drums or saxophones, :But just the clatter of their bones, :A rolling, rattling, carefree circus :Of mammoth polkas and mazurkas. :Pterodactyls and brontosauruses :Sang ghostly prehistoric choruses. :Amid the mastodontic wassail :I caught the eye of one small fossil. :\\"Cheer up, sad world,\\" he said, and winked‚Äî :\\"It's kind of fun to be extinct.\\" Cultural references The theme of the prologue of the 1991 soundtrack of the Disney film Beauty and the Beast is intentionally based on the 'Aquarium' movement, as explained by Oscar winner composer Alan Menken in this master class, as a means of promoting French music in a French original fairy tale. Notable audio/video performances *In 1976, Warner Brothers broadcast Bugs and Daffy's Carnival of the Animals on CBS, with a full orchestra conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas and featuring Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck as the duo pianists. This is an abridged version of the work, omitting the \\"Tortoise\\", \\"Characters with Long Ears\\", \\"Cuckoo\\" and \\"Swan\\" movements and using the \\"Pianists\\" music over the ending credits. *Gary Burghoff acted as host and narrator for a 1976 filmed performance released by Twin Tower Enterprises. The performance was filmed at the San Diego Zoo and was performed by the Mormon Youth Symphony Orchestra, and has been released on both VHS and DVD. *In 1984, Video Artists International released a taped performance of the original chamber orchestra version of The Carnival of the Animals (VAI 69096), conducted by Paul Lustig Dunkel, using the Ogden Nash verses and featuring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close as narrators. The performance was taped in commemoration of the 15th anniversary of Hospital Audiences, Inc. before an audience of invited patients from New York City area hospitals and nursing homes and has only been released in VHS format. *An all-star cast recording was released on CD by Dove Audio () performed by the Hollywood Chamber Orchestra conducted by Lalo Schifrin with all proceeds going to charity.

It is distinct from photomicrography, photographing microscopic subjects with a camera which is not particularly small. Definition Subminiature ‚Äî \\"very much reduced in size\\", Oxford English Dictionary. A subminiature camera is a class of camera that is very much smaller than a \\"miniature camera\\". The term \\"miniature camera\\" was originally used to describe cameras using the 35 mm cine film as negative material for still photography;L.A.Mannheim, Miniature Camera, p725-723, The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, MacMillan, NY,1956 so cameras that used film smaller than 35mm were referred to as \\"sub- miniature\\".\\"The term \\"subminiature\\" referred to use of a film gauge narrower than 35mm. Often this was 16mm film, perforated or unperforated --Ralph Jacobson, The Manual of Photography 7th ed, 1978, Focal Press, p149\\"SUBMINIATURE CAMERA A common reference to a group of cameras using formats smaller than 35 mm. \\"---The Focal encyclopedia of photography - Page 85T.L.GREEN Ultra miniature Camera Technique, Scope and Limitations, The Focal Press London 1965 The smallest of these are often referred to as \\"ultra- miniature\\". Lipstick cameras and other small digital cameras are not included, because they don't use film. The smaller subminiature cameras, called ultraminiature cameras, particularly Minox, are associated with spying. In short, some people define \\"subminiature camera\\" as one that uses film smaller than 35mm (even though some of these cameras are larger than full-framed 35mm cameras), but others define it any camera that has a film format smaller than the standard 35mm format of 24x36mm (even though some of these cameras are larger than full-framed 35mm cameras).  Types  There are many subminiature cameras. Minox, followed by Tessina, GaMi, Rollei, Yashica, Mamiya, Gemflex and Minolta are the best-known manufacturers. All made small, precision cameras and a few were still in production in 2006 but by 2011, only the Minox TLX model was still in production. Getting film and processing for most smaller cameras is a challenge as they are no longer manufactured or supported. Most require cutting your own film and home-processing. The best known subminiature formats are‚Äîin increasing size‚ÄîMinox (8√ó11 mm), Kodak disc (8√ó11 mm), 16 mm (10√ó14 mm), Super 16 mm (12√ó17 mm), 110 film (13√ó17 mm), 17.5mm for HIT camera( for example TONE camera), and the Advanced Photo System (APS) with different aspect ratios on 24 mm film. While many subminiature cameras were inexpensive and poorly manufactured (thus giving the format a bad name), Minox, Gami, Edixa, Rollei, Pentax and Minolta made quality cameras capable of producing fine results‚Äîeven when enlarged. Some of these formats, or non-standard cartridges loaded with an otherwise standard cin√© format, are best described as specialised (e.g., Minox); half-frame 35 mm uses standard 35 mm film; cameras such as 110 and disc were aimed at the mass market. The first subminiature single lens reflex is the Russian Narciss camera produced in 1961-65. First making an appearance in the late 19th century, often as concealed cameras, subminiature cameras became popular soon after WWII when many consumer markets required small, inexpensive cameras. Friedrich Kaftansky's Mini-flex was designed in 1931, on the market in 1933. Walter Zapp's Riga Minox appeared in 1938. Kodak's introduction of the 110 camera in the 1970s and the Kodak disc camera in the 1980s brought the subminiature camera to the forefront of the photographic market. The many cheap, poorly made cameras that soon appeared drove Kodak out of the market. 1/3 scale mini twin lens reflex using Minox film Various formats of subminiature camera have come and gone over the years as newer formats have replaced older one. In addition, many larger format cameras, especially 35 mm, become smaller in size and weight‚Äîpartly due to the consumer demand for subminiature cameras‚Äîand were able to replace some subminiature formats. For example, full-frame 35 mm cameras, such as the Minox 35 and the Olympus XA, were made as small as earlier half-frame subminiature cameras such as the Olympus Pen, using moderate wide-angle fixed lenses to minimise lens barrel depth. Some subminiature formats, such as the Minox and 110 formats, continue in production. Most other subminiature cameras are still usable if film can be obtained, particularly if the photographer is prepared to do the processing. Subminiature camera film * 16mm perforated or unperforated bulk roll film by Agfa, Kodak, Fujifilm in 100 ft to 1000 ft. * Using film slitter to slit 35mm roll film into Minox format film or 16mm film. Subminiature photography technique ;Focusing The process of focusing a subminiature camera is the same as any other camera: * Unit focusing: the entire lens is moved back and forth relative to the film plane. Examples: Minox B, C, LX, TLX; Edixa 16, Tessina. Minox 110, Monolta 16 * Front element focusing: Rollei 16, Rollei 110. * Fixed focus, feasible with the great depth of field of short focal length lenses: Minox EC, Minox ECX. * Internal focusing is not used. The small size of the camera and film require the use of a lens with short focal length, and hence great depth of field. This simplifies focusing to some extent. Minox TLX attached to a 400x microscope The simplest system is to use a lens with fixed focus set at the hyperfocal distance. This will produce images that are acceptably sharp from infinity to some near plane (usually five to eight feet away). This system is used in most cheaper cameras. More complex systems allow variable focus, through a dial or slider. Many cameras with this system have distance markings on the control; it is up to the user to set the focus according to the distance to the subject. Most Minox cameras use this system. Some subminiature cameras include a rangefinder, for example the Minox 110. These increase the size. Autofocus or through-the-lens focusing systems are not used on subminiature cameras to reduce the size requirements. ;Macro photography Subminiature cameras are less suited to macro photography than larger cameras, although the relatively large depth of field at close distances is an advantage. Where concealment is required, subminiature cameras are required; they (particularly the various Minox models) are well known as spy cameras, where they were used to photograph documents close up.

Noted for his outstanding combination of power hitting and speed, he was the first player to have more than two seasons of 30 home runs and 30 stolen bases, doing so a record five times (the record was matched only by his son Barry), and was the first to accomplish the feat in both major leagues; he became the second player to hit 300 career home runs and steal 300 bases, joining Willie Mays. Together with Barry, he is part of baseball's most accomplished father-son combination, holding the record for combined home runs, RBIs, and stolen bases. A prolific leadoff hitter, he also set major league records for most times leading off a game with a home run in a career (35) and a season (11, in ); both records have since been broken. Baseball career Born in Riverside, California, Bonds played varsity high school baseball at Riverside Polytechnic High School and signed with the Giants in . His sister, Rosie, was a 1964 Olympic hurdler. His brother, Robert, won two gold medals in the hurdles at the high school track and field state finals in 1960, and was an NFL Draft pick in 1965. In 1964 he was a High School All- American in track & field, while also being named Southern California High School Athlete of the Year. Playing in the Giants' minor league system, he was Most Valuable Player of the class-A Western Carolinas League. He hit a grand slam in his third at bat in his first major league game, June 25, 1968, becoming just the second player, and the first in MLB's modern era, to hit a grand slam in his debut game. The first was Bill Duggleby in 1898. Bonds was named to the 1968 Topps All-Star Rookie Team. Bonds was remarkable during his era for his combination of power and speed, but also for his propensity to strike out. In his first full season in , he set a major league record with 187 strikeouts, while also leading the NL in runs. He broke his own strikeout record a year later with 189. That record lasted until , when Adam Dunn broke it by striking out 195 times. This mark now belongs to Mark Reynolds with 223 in 2009. Bonds' 1970 total currently ranks tenth on the all-time single-season strikeout list. When Bonds retired, he ranked third in career strikeouts with 1,757, behind Willie Stargell's 1,912 and Reggie Jackson's 1,810. Bobby Bonds hit 39 home runs and had 43 stolen bases in 1973 ‚Äì the highest level of home runs and stolen bases (39+ of each) until Jos√© Canseco of the Oakland Athletics in 1988. Barry and Bobby had 1,094 combined home runs through 2007 ‚Äì a record for a father-son combination. He was a three-time Gold Glove Award winner (1971, 1973‚Äì74), and a three-time All-Star (1971, 1973 and 1975, winning the All-Star MVP award in 1973). Bonds, circa 1969 In 1970 he stole a career-high 48 bases, the highest total by a Giant since Frankie Frisch in 1921. Bonds was second in the NL with 134 runs and was fourth in doubles (with 36) and total bases (with 334). He also hit 10 triples, which was third in the league and his 48 stolen bases was 3rd in the league. In 1971 he finished fourth in the NL in runs batted in and second in runs, leading the Giants with a .288 average as they won the National League West title, earning their first postseason berth since the 1962 World Series. A bruised rib cage limited his play in the 1971 NLCS, his only postseason appearance; he was a late-inning replacement for rookie Dave Kingman in Game 1, and did not play in Game 2 before starting the final two games, batting 2-for-8 in the series. That season, he placed fourth in the NL MVP award voting. In 1972 Bonds scored 118 runs, which was second in the NL (the third straight season he was second in runs scored) and his 26 home runs was ninth in the circuit while his 44 stolen bases was 4th in the league. In 1973, he placed third in the MVP voting after hitting a career-high 39 home runs, 11 of them to start a game, and leading the league in runs a second time. Bonds was named the NL Player of the Year by The Sporting News in 1973 and was also named an outfielder on TSN's American League All-Star Team in 1977. In 1975 Bonds broke Eddie Yost's career record of 28 leadoff home runs. His eventual record of 35 stood until Rickey Henderson broke it in 1989, and his NL record of 30 was broken by Craig Biggio in 2003. His single-season mark of 11 was broken by Brady Anderson in 1996. His 32 home runs was fourth in the AL and his 30 stolen bases were eighth in the league. Bonds, circa 1975 After being traded to the New York Yankees after the 1974 season, Bonds became one of the sport's most-traveled figures, playing for seven more teams over seven seasons, with more than one season for only the California Angels (1976‚Äì77).

A German blockade cut off food and fuel shipments from farm towns. Some 4.5 million were affected and survived thanks to soup kitchens. Loe de Jong (1914‚Äì2005), author of The Kingdom of the Netherlands During World War II, estimated at least 22,000 deaths occurred due to the famine. Another author estimated 18,000 deaths from the famine.. Most of the victims were reportedly elderly men. The famine was alleviated by the liberation of the provinces by the Allies in May 1945. Prior to that, bread baked from flour shipped in from Sweden, and the airlift of food by the Royal Air Force, the Royal Canadian Air Force, and the United States Army Air Forces ‚Äì under an agreement with the Germans that if the Germans did not shoot at the mercy flights, the Allies would not bomb the German positions ‚Äì helped to mitigate the famine. These were Operations Manna and Chowhound. Operation Faust also trucked in food to the province. Causes food ration coupons from World War II A letter of commemoration given to a grocer whose shop served as a Red Cross point giving out the \\"Swedish bread\\" Operation Manna ‚Äì \\"Many Thanks\\" written in tulips, Holland, May 1945. Towards the end of World War II, food supplies became increasingly scarce in the Netherlands. After the landing of the Allied Forces on D-Day, conditions became increasingly bad in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands. The Allies were able to liberate the southern part of the country, but ceased their advance into the Netherlands when Operation Market Garden, the attempt to seize a bridge across the Rhine at Arnhem, failed. The Allied advance into Germany was delayed by supply problems as the port of Antwerp was not usable until the approaches had been cleared in the Battle of the Scheldt. But Montgomery had given priority to \\"Market Garden\\"; and to the capture of the French Channel ports like Boulogne, Calais and Dunkirk, which were resolutely defended and had suffered demolitions, see Operation Market Garden . After the national railways complied with the exiled Dutch government's appeal for a railway strike starting September 1944 to further the Allied liberation efforts, the German administration (under Wehrmachtbefehlshaber Friedrich Christiansen) retaliated by placing an embargo on all food transports to the western Netherlands. By the time the embargo was partially lifted in early November 1944, allowing restricted food transports over water, the unusually early and harsh winter had already set in. The canals froze over and became impassable for barges. Food British soldiers serving food to Dutch children at a St Nicholas Day party in Holland, 7 December 1944. Malnourished Dutch child in The Hague Food stocks in the cities in the western Netherlands rapidly ran out. The adult rations in cities such as Amsterdam dropped to below 1000 calories (4,200 kilojoules) a day by the end of November 1944 and to 580 calories in the west by the end of February 1945.Z. Stein, (1975). Famine and Human Development: The Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944‚Äì1945. Over this Hongerwinter (\\"Hunger winter\\"), a number of factors combined to cause starvation in especially the large cities in the West of the Netherlands. The winter in the month of January 1945 itself was unusually harsh prohibiting transport by boat for roughly a month between early January 1945 and early February 1945. Also, the German army destroyed docks and bridges to flood the country and impede the Allied advance. Thirdly, Allied bombing made it extremely difficult to transport food in bulk, since Allied bombers could not distinguish German military and civilian shipments. As the south-eastern (the Maas valley) and the south-western part of the Netherlands (Walcheren and Beveland) became one of the main western battlefields, these conditions combined to make the transport of existing food stocks in large enough quantities nearly impossible. The areas affected were home to 4.5 million people. Butter disappeared after October 1944, shortly after railway transport to the western parts of the Netherlands had stopped in September due to the railway strike. The supply of vegetable fats dwindled to a minuscule seven- month supply of 1.3 liters per person. At first 100 grams of cheese were allotted every two weeks; the meat coupons became worthless. The bread ration had already dropped from 2,200 to 1,800 and then to 1,400 grams per week. Then it fell to 1,000 grams in October, and by April 1945 to 400 grams a week. Together with one kilogram of potatoes, this then formed the entire weekly ration. The black market increasingly ran out of food as well, and with the gas and electricity and heat turned off, everyone was very cold and very hungry.Banning (1946), p 93 In search of food, young strong people would walk for tens of kilometers to trade valuables for food at farms. Tulip bulbs and sugar beets were commonly consumed. Furniture and houses were dismantled to provide fuel for heating. In the last months of 1944, in anticipation of the coming famine, tens of thousands of children were brought from the cities to rural areas where many remained until the end of the war. Deaths in the three big cities of the Western Netherlands (The Hague, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam) started in earnest in December 1944, reaching a peak in March 1945,The number of officially reported extra deaths in March 1945 in The Hague alone was 1,380; part of this number probably also included identified victims from Allied bombardments (550 deaths on March 2 (see Bombing of the Bezuidenhout) and German reprisals, on the other hand not all extra deaths were included in this number (in a bureaucracy there is no death without a(n identified) body). but remained very high in April and May 1945. In early summer 1945 the famine was brought quickly under control. From September 1944 until May 1945 the deaths of 18,000 Dutch people were attributed to malnutrition as the primary cause and in many more as a contributing factor. End of the famine The Dutch Famine ended with the liberation by the Allies of the western Netherlands in March 1945. Shortly before that, some relief had come from \\"Swedish bread\\", which was baked in the Netherlands from flour shipped in from Sweden. Shortly after these shipments, the German occupiers allowed coordinated air drops of food over German-occupied Dutch territory by the Royal Air Force and Royal Canadian Air Force from 29 April to 7 May (Operation Manna), and by the U.S. Army Air Forces from 1 to 8 May (Operation Chowhound). The Germans agreed not to shoot at the planes flying the mercy missions, and the Allies agreed not to bomb German positions. Operation Faust also trucked in food to Rhenen beginning on 2 May, utilizing 200 vehicles. Rhenen was also occupied by the Germans. Legacy The Dutch famine of 1944‚Äì45 was a rare case of a famine which took place in a modern, developed, and literate country, albeit one suffering under the privations of occupation and war. The well-documented experience has helped scientists to measure the effects of famine on human health. The Dutch Famine Birth Cohort StudyCarried out by the departments of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Gynecology and Obstetrics and Internal Medicine of the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam, in collaboration with the MRC Environmental Epidemiology Unit of the University of Southampton in Britain. found that the children of pregnant women exposed to famine were more susceptible to diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, microalbuminuria and other health problems.. Moreover, the children of the women who were pregnant during the famine were smaller, as expected. However, surprisingly, when these children grew up and had children those children were thought to also be smaller than average. This data suggested that the famine experienced by the mothers caused some kind of epigenetic changes that were passed down to the next generation. Despite this, a subsequent study by the same author failed to find a correlation between maternal exposure to famine and birth weight of the next generation. The discovery of the cause of coeliac disease may also be partly attributed to the Dutch famine. With wheat in very short supply there was an improvement at a children's ward of coeliac patients. Stories tell of the first precious supplies of bread being given specifically to the (no longer) sick children, prompting an immediate relapse. Thus in the 1940s the Dutch paediatrician Dr. Willem Dicke was able to corroborate his previously researched hypothesis that wheat intake was aggravating coeliac disease.. Later Dicke went on to prove his theory. Audrey Hepburn spent her childhood in the Netherlands during the famine and despite her later wealth she had lifelong negative medical repercussions. She suffered from anemia, respiratory illnesses, and ≈ìdema as a result.. Subsequent academic research on the children who were affected in the second trimester of their mother's pregnancy found an increased incidence of schizophrenia in these children. Also increased among them were the rates of schizotypal personality and neurological defects. Some studies have suggested that epigenetic damage caused by the famine has caused increased morbidity in the grandchildren of Hongerwinter survivors.

This Purusha Sukta varna verse is now generally considered to have been inserted at a later date into the Vedic text, possibly as a charter myth. Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton, a professor of Sanskrit and Religious studies, state, \\"there is no evidence in the Rigveda for an elaborate, much-subdivided and overarching caste system\\", and \\"the varna system seems to be embryonic in the Rigveda and, both then and later, a social ideal rather than a social reality\\". =Shrauta Sutras= Ancient texts describing community-oriented Vedic yajna rituals mention four to five priests: the hotar, the adhvaryu, the udgatar, the Brahmin and sometimes the ritvij.Mahendra Kulasrestha (2007), The Golden Book of Upanishads, Lotus, , page 21 The functions associated with the priests were: * The Hotri recites invocations and litanies drawn from the Rigveda. * The Adhvaryu is the priest's assistant and is in charge of the physical details of the ritual like measuring the ground, building the altar explained in the Yajurveda. The adhvaryu offers oblations.Robert Hume, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 3.1, Oxford University Press, pages 107‚Äì109 * The Udgatri is the chanter of hymns set to melodies and music (sƒÅman) drawn from the Samaveda. The udgatar, like the hotar, chants the introductory, accompanying and benediction hymns. * The Brahmin recites from the Atharvaveda. * The Ritvij is the chief operating priest.Mohr and Fear (2015), World Religions: The History, Issues, and Truth, , page 81 According to Kulkarni, the Grhya-sutras state that Yajna, Adhyayana (studying the vedas and teaching), dana pratigraha (accepting and giving gifts) are the \\"peculiar duties and privileges of brahmins\\". =Brahmin and renunciation tradition in Hinduism= The term Brahmin in Indian texts has signified someone who is good and virtuous, not just someone of priestly class. Both Buddhist and Brahmanical literature, states Patrick Olivelle, repeatedly define \\"Brahmin\\" not in terms of family of birth, but in terms of personal qualities. These virtues and characteristics mirror the values cherished in Hinduism during the Sannyasa stage of life, or the life of renunciation for spiritual pursuits. Brahmins, states Olivelle, were the social class from which most ascetics came.Patrick Olivelle (2011), Ascetics and Brahmins: Studies in Ideologies and Institutions, Anthem, , page 60 Dharmasutras and Dharmashastras The Dharmasutras and Dharmasatras text of Hinduism describe the expectations, duties and role of Brahmins. The rules and duties in these Dharma texts of Hinduism, are primarily directed at Brahmins. The Gautama's Dharmasutra, the oldest of surviving Hindu Dharmasutras, for example, states in verse 9.54‚Äì9.55 that a Brahmin should not participate or perform a ritual unless he is invited to do so, but he may attend. Gautama outlines the following rules of conduct for a Brahmin, in Chapters 8 and 9:RC Prasad (2014), The Upanayana: The Hindu Ceremonies of the Sacred Thread *Be always truthful *Teach his art only to virtuous men *Follow rules of ritual purification *Study Vedas with delight *Never hurt any living creature *Be gentle but steadfast *Have self-control *Be kind, liberal towards everyone Chapter 8 of the Dharmasutra, states Olivelle, asserts the functions of a Brahmin to be to learn the Vedas, the secular sciences, the Vedic supplements, the dialogues, the epics and the Puranas; to understand the texts and pattern his conduct according to precepts contained in this texts, to undertake Sanskara (rite of passage) and rituals, and lead a virtuous life.Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, , pages 90‚Äì91 The text lists eight virtues that a Brahmin must inculcate: compassion, patience, lack of envy, purification, tranquility, auspicious disposition, generosity and lack of greed, and then asserts in verse 9.24‚Äì9.25, that it is more important to lead a virtuous life than perform rites and rituals, because virtue leads to achieving liberation (moksha, a life in the world of Brahman). The later Dharma texts of Hinduism such as Baudhayana Dharmasutra add charity, modesty, refraining from anger and never being arrogant as duties of a Brahmin.Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, , pages 136‚Äì137 The Vasistha Dharmasutra in verse 6.23 lists discipline, austerity, self-control, liberality, truthfulness, purity, Vedic learning, compassion, erudition, intelligence and religious faith as characteristics of a Brahmin.Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, , pages 267‚Äì268 In 13.55, the Vasistha text states that a Brahmin must not accept weapons, poison or liquor as gifts.Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, , page 284 The Dharmasastras such as Manusmriti, like Dharmsutras, are codes primarily focussed on how a Brahmin must live his life, and their relationship with a king and warrior class.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 16, 62‚Äì65 Manusmriti dedicates 1,034 verses, the largest portion, on laws for and expected virtues of Brahmins.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 41, for specific examples see 132‚Äì134 It asserts, for example, John Bussanich states that the ethical precepts set for Brahmins, in ancient Indian texts, are similar to Greek virtue-ethics, that \\"Manu's dharmic Brahmin can be compared to Aristotle's man of practical wisdom\\",John Bussanich (2014), Ancient Ethics (Editors: J√∂rg Hardy and George Rudebusch), Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, , pages 38, 33‚Äì52, Quote: \\"Affinities with Greek virtue ethics are also noteworthy. Manu's dharmic Brahmin can be compared to Aristotle's man of practical wisdom, who exercises moral authority because he feels the proper emotions and judges difficult situations correctly, when moral rules and maxims are unavailable\\". and that \\"the virtuous Brahmin is not unlike the Platonic-Aristotelian philosopher\\" with the difference that the latter was not sacerdotal.John Bussanich (2014), Ancient Ethics (Editors: J√∂rg Hardy and George Rudebusch), Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, , pages 44‚Äì45  History  According to Abraham Eraly, \\"Brahmin as a varna hardly had any presence in historical records before the Gupta Empire era\\" (3rd century to 6th century CE), when Buddhism dominated the land. \\"No Brahmin, no sacrifice, no ritualistic act of any kind ever, even once, is referred to\\" in any Indian texts between third century BCE and the late first century CE. He also states that \\"The absence of literary and material evidence, however, does not mean that Brahmanical culture did not exist at that time, but only that it had no elite patronage and was largely confined to rural folk, and therefore went unrecorded in history\\".Abraham Eraly (2011), The First Spring: The Golden Age of India, Penguin, , page 283 Their role as priests and repository of sacred knowledge, as well as their importance in the practice of Vedic Shrauta rituals, grew during the Gupta Empire era and thereafter. However, the knowledge about actual history of Brahmins or other varnas of Hinduism in and after the first millennium is fragmentary and preliminary, with little that is from verifiable records or archeological evidence, and much that is constructed from ahistorical Sanskrit works and fiction. Michael Witzel writes, =Normative occupations= Brahmins in white dress performing the Bhumi Puja ritual yajna around fire The Gautama Dharmasutra states in verse 10.3 that it is obligatory on a Brahmin to learn and teach the Vedas.Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, , page 94 Chapter 10 of the text, according to Olivelle translation, states that he may impart Vedic instructions to a teacher, relative, friend, elder, anyone who offers exchange of knowledge he wants, or anyone who pays for such education. The Chapter 10 adds that a Brahmin may also engage in agriculture, trade, lend money on interest, while Chapter 7 states that a Brahmin may engage in the occupation of a warrior in the times of adversity. Typically, asserts Gautama Dharmasutra, a Brahmin should accept any occupation to sustain himself but avoid the occupations of a Shudra, but if his life is at stake a Brahmin may sustain himself by accepting occupations of a Shudra.Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, , page 89 The text forbids a Brahmin from engaging in the trade of animals for slaughter, meat, medicines and milk products even in the times of adversity. The Apastamba Dharmasutra asserts in verse 1.20.10 that trade is generally not sanctioned for Brahmins, but in the times of adversity he may do so. The chapter 1.20 of Apastamba, states Olivelle, forbids the trade of the following under any circumstances: human beings, meat, skins, weapons, barren cows, sesame seeds, pepper, and merits.Patrick Olivelle (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, , page 31 The 1st millennium CE Dharmasastras, that followed the Dharmasutras contain similar recommendations on occupations for a Brahmin, both in prosperous or normal times, and in the times of adversity.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 124‚Äì126 The widely studied Manusmriti, for example, states: An ascetic from renunciation tradition (1914) The Manusmriti recommends that a Brahmin's occupation must never involve forbidden activities such as producing or trading poison, weapons, meat, trapping birds and others. It also lists six occupations that it deems proper for a Brahmin: teaching, studying, offering yajna, officiating at yajna, giving gifts and accepting gifts.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 125, 211‚Äì212 Of these, states Manusmriti, three which provide a Brahmin with a livelihood are teaching, officiating at yajna, and accepting gifts.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , page 212 The text states that teaching is best, and ranks the accepting of gifts as the lowest of the six. In the times of adversity, Manusmriti recommends that a Brahmin may live by engaging in the occupations of the warrior class, or agriculture or cattle herding or trade. Of these, Manusmriti in verses 10.83‚Äì10.84 recommends a Brahmin should avoid agriculture if possible because, according to Olivelle translation, agriculture \\"involves injury to living beings and dependence of others\\" when the plow digs the ground and injures the creatures that live in the soil.Patrick Olivelle (2011), Ascetics and Brahmins: Studies in Ideologies and Institutions, Anthem, , page 39 However, adds Manusmriti, even in the times of adversity, a Brahmin must never trade or produce poison, weapons, meat, soma, liquor, perfume, milk and milk products, molasses, captured animals or birds, beeswax, sesame seeds or roots. =Actual occupations= Adi Shankara a proponent of Advaita Vedanta, was born in a Brahmin family, and is credited with unifying and establishing the main currents of thought in Hinduism.Johannes de Kruijf and Ajaya Sahoo (2014), Indian Transnationalism Online: New Perspectives on Diaspora, , page 105, Quote: \\"In other words, according to Adi Shankara's argument, the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta stood over and above all other forms of Hinduism and encapsulated them. This then united Hinduism; (...) Another of Adi Shankara's important undertakings which contributed to the unification of Hinduism was his founding of a number of monastic centers.\\"Shankara, Student's Encyclop√¶dia Britannica - India (2000), Volume 4, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (UK) Publishing, , page 379, Quote: \\"Shankaracharya, philosopher and theologian, most renowned exponent of the Advaita Vedanta school of philosophy, from whose doctrines the main currents of modern Indian thought are derived.\\" David Crystal (2004), The Penguin Encyclopedia, Penguin Books, page 1353, Quote: \\"[Shankara] is the most famous exponent of Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy and the source of the main currents of modern Hindu thought.\\"Christophe Jaffrelot (1998), The Hindu Nationalist Movement in India, Columbia University Press, , page 2, Quote: \\"The main current of Hinduism - if not the only one - which became formalized in a way that approximates to an ecclesiastical structure was that of Shankara\\". Historical records, state scholars, suggest that Brahmin varna was not limited to a particular status or priest and teaching profession. Historical records from mid 1st millennium CE and later, suggest Brahmins were agriculturalists and warriors in medieval India, quite often instead of as exception. Donkin and other scholars state that Hoysala Empire records frequently mention Brahmin merchants \\"carried on trade in horses, elephants and pearls\\" and transported goods throughout medieval India before the 14th-century.RA Donkin (1998), Beyond Price: Pearls and Pearl-fishing, American Philosophical Society, , page 166SC Malik (1986), Determinants of Social Status in India, Indian Institute of Advanced Study, , page 121 The Pali Canon depicts Brahmins as the most prestigious and elite non-Buddhist figures. They mention them parading their learning. The Pali Canon and other Buddhist texts such as the Jataka Tales also record the livelihood of Brahmins to have included being farmers, handicraft workers and artisans such as carpentry and architecture.Stella Kramrisch (1994), Exploring India's Sacred Art, Editor: Stella Miller, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 60‚Äì64 Buddhist sources extensively attest, state Greg Bailey and Ian Mabbett, that Brahmins were \\"supporting themselves not by religious practice, but employment in all manner of secular occupations\\", in the classical period of India.Greg Bailey and Ian Mabbett (2006), The Sociology of Early Buddhism, Cambridge University Press, , pages 113‚Äì115 with footnotes Some of the Brahmin occupations mentioned in the Buddhist texts such as Jatakas and Sutta Nipata are very lowly. The Dharmasutras too mention Brahmin farmers. According to Haidar and Sardar, unlike the Mughal Empire in Northern India, Brahmins figured prominently in the administration of Deccan Sultanates. Under Golconda Sultanate Telugu Niyogi Brahmins served in many different roles such as accountants, ministers, revenue administration and in judicial service. The Deccan sultanates also heavily recruited Marathi Brahmins at different levels of their administration During the days of Maratha Empire in the 17th and 18th century, the occupation of Marathi Brahmins ranged from administration, being warriors to being de facto rulers After the collapse of Maratha empire, Brahmins in Maharashtra region were quick to take advantage of opportunities opened up by the new British rulers. They were the first community to take up Western education and therefore dominated lower level of British administration in the 19th century. Similarly, the Tamil Brahmins were also quick to take up English education during British colonial rule and dominate government service and law. Eric Bellman states that during the Islamic Mughal Empire era Brahmins served as advisers to the Mughals, later to the British Raj. The East India Company also recruited from the Brahmin communities of Bihar and Awadh (in the present day Uttar Pradesh) for the Bengal army Many Brahmins, in other parts of South Asia lived like other varna, engaged in all sorts of professions. Among Nepalese Hindus, for example, Niels Gutschow and Axel Michaels report the actual observed professions of Brahmins from 18th- to early 20th-century included being temple priests, minister, merchants, farmers, potters, masons, carpenters, coppersmiths, stone workers, barbers, gardeners among others.Niels Gutschow and Axel Michaels (2008), Bel-Frucht und Lendentuch: M√§dchen und Jungen in Bhaktapur Nepal, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, pages 23 (table), for context and details see 16‚Äì36 Other 20th-century surveys, such as in the state of Uttar Pradesh, recorded that the primary occupation of almost all Brahmin families surveyed was neither priestly nor Vedas-related, but like other varnas, ranged from crop farming (80 per cent of Brahmins), dairy, service, labour such as cooking, and other occupations.Ramesh Bairy (2010), Being Brahmin, Being Modern, Routledge, , pages 86‚Äì89 The survey reported that the Brahmin families involved in agriculture as their primary occupation in modern times plough the land themselves, many supplementing their income by selling their labor services to other farmers.Noor Mohammad (1992), New Dimensions in Agricultural Geography, Volume 3, Concept Publishers, , pages 45, 42‚Äì48G Shah (2004), Caste and Democratic Politics in India, Anthem, , page 40 =Brahmins, bhakti movement and social reform movements= Raja Ram Mohan Roy, a Brahmin, who founded Brahmo Samaj Many of the prominent thinkers and earliest champions of the Bhakti movement were Brahmins, a movement that encouraged a direct relationship of an individual with a personal god.Sheldon Pollock (2009), The Language of the Gods in the World of Men, University of California Press, , pages 423-431 Among the many Brahmins who nurtured the Bhakti movement were Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Vallabha and Madhvacharya of Vaishnavism,; Ramananda, another devotional poet sant.Ronald McGregor (1984), Hindi literature from its beginnings to the nineteenth century, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, , pages 42‚Äì44William Pinch (1996), Peasants and Monks in British India, University of California Press, , pages 53‚Äì89 Born in a Brahmin family,David Lorenzen, Who Invented Hinduism: Essays on Religion in History, , pages 104‚Äì106 Ramananda welcomed everyone to spiritual pursuits without discriminating anyone by gender, class, caste or religion (such as Muslims).Gerald James Larson (1995), India's Agony Over Religion, State University of New York Press, , page 116Julia Leslie (1996), Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition, Routledge, , pages 117‚Äì119 He composed his spiritual message in poems, using widely spoken vernacular language rather than Sanskrit, to make it widely accessible.

For example, the Brahmins Raja Ram Mohan Roy led Brahmo Samaj and Dayananda Saraswati led the Arya Samaj.Noel Salmond (2004), Hindu iconoclasts: Rammohun Roy, Dayananda Sarasvati and nineteenth-century polemics against idolatry, Wilfrid Laurier Univ. Press, , pages 65‚Äì68Dorothy Figueira (2002), Aryans, Jews, Brahmins: Theorizing Authority through Myths of Identity, State University of New York Press, , pages 90‚Äì117 In Buddhist and Jaina texts The term Brahmin appears extensively in ancient and medieval Sutras and commentary texts of Buddhism and Jainism. In Buddhist Pali Canon, such as the Majjhima Nikaya and Devadaha Sutta, first written down about 1st century BCE, the Buddha is attributed to be mentioning Jain Brahmins and ascetics, as he describes their karma doctrine and ascetic practices: Modern scholars state that such usage of the term Brahmin in ancient texts does not imply a caste, but simply \\"masters\\" (experts), guardian, recluse, preacher or guide of any tradition. An alternate synonym for Brahmin in the Buddhist and other non-Hindu tradition is Mahano. Outside South Asia: Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Indonesia Among the Hindus of Bali, Indonesia, Brahmins are called Pedandas.Martin Ramstedt (2003), Hinduism in Modern Indonesia, Routledge, , page 256 The role of Brahmin priests, called Sulinggih,Martin Ramstedt (2003), Hinduism in Modern Indonesia, Routledge, , page 80 has been open to both genders since medieval times. A Hindu Brahmin priestess is shown above. Some Brahmins formed an influential group in Burmese Buddhist kingdoms in 18th- and 19th-century. The court Brahmins were locally called Punna. During the Konbaung dynasty, Buddhist kings relied on their court Brahmins to consecrate them to kingship in elaborate ceremonies, and to help resolve political questions. This role of Hindu Brahmins in a Buddhist kingdom, states Leider, may have been because Hindu texts provide guidelines for such social rituals and political ceremonies, while Buddhist texts do not. The Brahmins were also consulted in the transmission, development and maintenance of law and justice system outside India. Hindu Dharmasastras, particularly Manusmriti written by the Brahmin Manu, states Anthony Reid, were \\"greatly honored in Burma (Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), Cambodia and Java-Bali (Indonesia) as the defining documents of law and order, which kings were obliged to uphold. They were copied, translated and incorporated into local law code, with strict adherence to the original text in Burma and Siam, and a stronger tendency to adapt to local needs in Java (Indonesia)\\".Anthony Reid (1988), Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce, 1450‚Äì1680: The lands below the winds, Yale University Press, , pages 137‚Äì138Victor Lieberman (2014), Burmese Administrative Cycles, Princeton University Press, , pages 66‚Äì68; Also see discussion of 13th century Wagaru Dhamma-sattha / 11th century Manu Dhammathat manuscripts discussionOn Laws of Manu in 14th century Thailand's Ayuthia kingdom named after Ayodhya, see David Wyatt (2003), Thailand: A Short History, Yale University Press, , page 61; Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, , pages 269‚Äì272 The mythical origins of Cambodia are credited to a Brahmin prince named Kaundinya, who arrived by sea, married a Naga princess living in the flooded lands.Jonathan Lee and Kathleen Nadeau (2010), Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife, Volume 1, ABC, , page 1223 Kaudinya founded Kambuja-desa, or Kambuja (transliterated to Kampuchea or Cambodia). Kaundinya introduced Hinduism, particularly Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva and Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva), and these ideas grew in southeast Asia in the 1st millennium CE.Trevor Ranges (2010), Cambodia, National Geographic, , page 48 Brahmins have been part of the Royal tradition of Thailand, particularly for the consecration and to mark annual land fertility rituals of Buddhist kings. A small Brahmanical temple Devasathan, established in 1784 by King Rama I of Thailand, has been managed by ethnically Thai Brahmins ever since. The temple hosts Phra Phikhanesuan (Ganesha), Phra Narai (Narayana, Vishnu), Phra Itsuan (Shiva), Uma, Brahma, Indra (Sakka) and other Hindu deities.HG Quadritch Wales (1992), Siamese State Ceremonies, Curzon Press, , pages 54‚Äì63 The tradition asserts that the Thai Brahmins have roots in Hindu holy city of Varanasi and southern state of Tamil Nadu, go by the title Pandita, and the various annual rites and state ceremonies they conduct has been a blend of Buddhist and Hindu rituals. The coronation ceremony of the Thai king is almost entirely conducted by the royal Brahmins.Boreth Ly (2011), Early Interactions Between South and Southeast Asia (Editors: Pierre-Yves Manguin, A. Mani, Geoff Wade), Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, , pages 461‚Äì475 Modern demographics and economic condition Percentage of Brahmins in each state. Data is from recent caste censuses. According to 2007 reports, Brahmins in India are about five percent of its total population.Eric Bellman, Reversal of Fortune Isolates India's Brahmins, The Wall Street Journal (29 December 2007) The Himalayan states of Uttarakhand (20%) and Himachal Pradesh (14%) have the highest percentage of Brahmin population relative to respective state's total Hindus.

The film explores a wide range of philosophical issues, including the nature of reality, dreams and lucid dreams, consciousness, the meaning of life, free will, and existentialism. It is centered on a young man who wanders through a succession of dream-like realities wherein he encounters a series of individuals who engage in insightful philosophical discussions. The film was entirely rotoscoped, although it was shot using digital video of live actors with a team of artists drawing stylized lines and colors over each frame with computers, rather than being filmed and traced onto cels on a lightbox. The film contains several parallels to Linklater's 1991 film Slacker. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reprise their characters from Before Sunrise in one scene. Waking Life premiered at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival. Plot An unnamed young man lives an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and eventually progresses toward an existential crisis. He observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other characters‚Äîranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant- goers and friends‚Äîabout such issues as metaphysics, free will, social philosophy, and the meaning of life. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence, but rather, focus on a random isolated person, a group of people, or a couple engaging in such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film also touches upon existentialism, situationist politics, posthumanity, the film theory of Andr√© Bazin, and lucid dreaming, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name. Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she greets him and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself that she is a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters, but he begins to despair about being trapped in a dream. The protagonist's final talk is with a character (played by Richard Linklater) whom he briefly encountered previously, earlier in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's view that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only accept God's invitation. The protagonist is last seen walking into a driveway when he suddenly begins to levitate, paralleling a scene at the start of the film of a floating child in the same driveway. The protagonist uncertainly reaches toward a car's handle, but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees. He rises into the endless blue expanse of the sky until he disappears from view. Cast *Wiley Wiggins plays the protagonist. The film features appearances from a wide range of actors and non-actors, including: * Eamonn Healy * Timothy \\"Speed\\" Levitch * Adam Goldberg * Nicky Katt * Ethan Hawke * Julie Delpy * Steven Prince * Caveh Zahedi * Otto Hofmann * Richard Linklater * Alex Jones * Kim Krizan * Louis H. Mackey * Steven Soderbergh * David Sosa * Robert C. Solomon * Steve Brudniak * David Martinez Production In a 2001 interview, Linklater estimated that the idea for the film came \\"before I was even interested in film, probably 20 years ago\\". Despite the long gestation process in his head, Linklater noted that before he came up with the idea of rotoscoping, the film \\"didn't quite work\\" calling it \\"too blunt, too realistic\\" stating that \\"I think to make a realistic film about an unreality the film had to be a realistic unreality\\". Adding to the dream-like effect, the film used an animation technique based on rotoscoping. Animators overlaid live action footage (shot by Linklater) with animation that roughly approximates the images actually filmed. This technique is similar in some respects to the rotoscope style of 1970s filmmaker Ralph Bakshi. Rotoscoping itself, however, was not Bakshi's invention, but that of experimental silent filmmaker Max Fleischer, who patented the process in 1917. A variety of artists were employed, so the feel of the movie continually changes, and gets stranger as time goes on. The result is a surreal, shifting dreamscape. The animators used inexpensive \\"off-the-shelf\\" Apple Macintosh computers. The film was mostly produced using Rotoshop, a custom-made rotoscoping program that creates blends between key frame vector shapes, which also makes use of virtual \\"layers\\", and designed specifically for the production by Bob Sabiston. Linklater used this animation method again for his 2006 film A Scanner Darkly. Release Waking Life premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2001, and was given a limited release in the United States on October 19, 2001. =Reception= The film has an average score of 82/100 (\\"universal acclaim\\") on review aggregator Metacritic, based on 31 reviews. Based on 145 reviews compiled by Rotten Tomatoes, 81% of the critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.44/10. The website's critical consensus reads \\"Waking Lifes inventive animated aesthetic adds a distinctive visual component to a film that could easily have rested on its smart screenplay and talented ensemble cast.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four, describing it as \\"a cold shower of bracing, clarifying ideas\\". Ebert later included the film on his list of \\"Great Movies\\". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly awarded the film an \\"A\\" rating, calling it \\"a work of cinematic art in which form and structure pursues the logic-defying (parallel) subjects of dreaming and moviegoing,\\" while Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote it was \\"so verbally dexterous and visually innovative that you can't absorb it unless you have all your wits about you\\". Dave Kehr of The New York Times found the film to be \\"lovely, fluid, funny\\" and stated that it \\"never feels heavy or over-ambitious\\". Conversely, J. Hoberman of The Village Voice felt that Waking Life \\"doesn't leave you in a dream... so much as it traps you in an endless bull session\\". Frank Lovece felt the film was \\"beautifully drawn\\" but called its content \\"pedantic navel-gazing\\". Nominated for numerous awards, mainly for its technical achievements, Waking Life won the National Society of Film Critics award for \\"Best Experimental Film\\", the New York Film Critics Circle award for \\"Best Animated Film\\", and the \\"CinemAvvenire\\" award at the Venice Film Festival for \\"Best Film\\". It was also nominated for the Golden Lion, the festival's main award. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2008 ‚Äì AFI's 10 Top 10: Nominated Animation Film =Home media= The film was released on DVD in North America in May 2002. Special features included several commentaries, documentaries, interviews, trailers, and deleted scenes, as well as the short film Snack and Drink. A bare-bones DVD with no special features was released in Region 2 in February 2003. A Blu-Ray was released in Germany and the UK. Soundtrack The Waking Life OST was performed and written by Glover Gill and the Tosca Tango Orchestra, except for Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, Op. 9, No. 2. The soundtrack was relatively successful. Featuring the nuevo tango style, it bills itself \\"the 21st Century Tango\\". The tango contributions were influenced by the music of the Argentine \\"father of new tango\\" Astor Piazzolla.

Equality gives rise to challenging questions, which are not altogether easy to answer. In the philosophy of language, the distinction between sense and reference was an innovation of the German philosopher and mathematician Gottlob Frege in 1892 (in his paper \\"On Sense and Reference\\"; German: \\"√úber Sinn und Bedeutung\\"), reflecting the two ways he believed a singular term may have meaning. The reference (or \\"referent\\"; Bedeutung) of a proper name is the object it means or indicates (bedeuten), whereas its sense (Sinn) is what the name expresses. The reference of a sentence is its truth value, whereas its sense is the thought that it expresses.\\"On Sense and Reference\\" [\\"√úber Sinn und Bedeutung\\"], Zeitschrift f√ºr Philosophie und philosophische Kritik, vol. 100 (1892), pp. 25‚Äì50, esp. p. 31. Frege justified the distinction in a number of ways. #Sense is something possessed by a name, whether or not it has a reference. For example, the name \\"Odysseus\\" is intelligible, and therefore has a sense, even though there is no individual object (its reference) to which the name corresponds. #The sense of different names is different, even when their reference is the same. Frege argued that if an identity statement such as \\"Hesperus is the same planet as Phosphorus\\" is to be informative, the proper names flanking the identity sign must have a different meaning or sense. But clearly, if the statement is true, they must have the same reference.\\"On Sense and Reference\\", p. 25 The sense is a 'mode of presentation', which serves to illuminate only a single aspect of the referent.\\"On Sense and Reference\\", p. 27 Much of analytic philosophy is traceable to Frege's philosophy of language.Jeff Speaks, \\"Frege's theory of reference\\" (2011) Frege's views on logic (i.e., his idea that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the arguments of a mathematical function) led to his views on a theory of reference. Background Frege developed his original theory of meaning in early works like Begriffsschrift (concept script) of 1879 and Grundlagen (foundations of arithmetic) of 1884. On this theory, the meaning of a complete sentence consists in its being true or false,Gareth Evans, The Varieties of Reference, Oxford: Clarendon 1982, p. 8 and the meaning of each significant expression in the sentence is an extralinguistic entity which Frege called its Bedeutung, literally meaning or significance, but rendered by Frege's translators as reference, referent, 'Meaning', nominatum, etc. Frege supposed that some parts of speech are complete by themselves, and are analogous to the arguments of a mathematical function, but that other parts are incomplete, and contain an empty place, by analogy with the function itself.\\"Function and Concept\\", p. 16. Thus \\"Caesar conquered Gaul\\" divides into the complete term \\"Caesar\\", whose reference is Caesar himself, and the incomplete term \\"‚Äîconquered Gaul\\", whose reference is a concept. Only when the empty place is filled by a proper name does the reference of the completed sentence ‚Äì its truth value ‚Äì appear. This early theory of meaning explains how the significance or reference of a sentence (its truth value) depends on the significance or reference of its parts. Sense Hesperus Phosphorus Frege introduced the notion of \\"sense\\" (German: Sinn) to accommodate difficulties in his early theory of meaning.Cassin, B., Apter, E., Lezra, J., & Wood, M., eds., Dictionary of Untranslatables: A Philosophical Lexicon (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2014), p. 965. First, if the entire significance of a sentence consists of its truth value, it follows that the sentence will have the same significance if we replace a word of the sentence with one having an identical reference, as this will not change its truth value.\\"On Sense and Reference\\", p. 32. The reference of the whole is determined by the reference of the parts. If the evening star has the same reference as the morning star, it follows that the evening star is a body illuminated by the Sun has the same truth value as the morning star is a body illuminated by the Sun. But it is possible for someone to think that the first sentence is true while also thinking that the second is false. Therefore, the thought corresponding to each sentence cannot be its reference, but something else, which Frege called its sense. Second, sentences that contain proper names with no reference cannot have a truth value at all. Yet the sentence 'Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep' obviously has a sense, even though 'Odysseus' has no reference. The thought remains the same whether or not 'Odysseus' has a reference. Furthermore, a thought cannot contain the objects that it is about. For example, Mont Blanc, 'with its snowfields', cannot be a component of the thought that Mont Blanc is more than 4,000 metres high. Nor can a thought about Etna contain lumps of solidified lava.See Frege's undated letter to Philip Jourdain, published in Frege's Philosophical and Mathematical Correspondence, ed. Gottfried Gabriel, Hans Hermes, Friedrich Kanbartel, Christian Thiel and Albet Veraart, transl. Hans Kaal, Oxford: Blackwell 1980. (See also Frege's letter to Russell dated 1904, in the same collection.) Frege's notion of sense is somewhat obscure, and neo-Fregeans have come up with different candidates for its role.Sam Cumming, Names, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy 2013. Accounts based on the work of CarnapMeaning and Necessity, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1947. and Church‚ÄúA Formulation of the Logic of Sense and Denotation‚Äù, in P. Henle, M. Kallen, and S. K. Langer, eds., Structure, Method, and Meaning, New York: Liberal Arts Press, 1951 treat sense as an intension, or a function from possible worlds to extensions. For example, the intension of ‚Äònumber of planets‚Äô is a function that maps any possible world to the number of planets in that world. John McDowell supplies cognitive and reference-determining roles.‚ÄúOn the Sense and Reference of a Proper Name‚Äù, Mind, 86: 159‚Äì85, 1977. Michael Devitt treats senses as causal-historical chains connecting names to referents, allowing that repeated \\"groundings\\" in an object account for reference change.Devitt, M., Designation, New York: Columbia University Press, 1981. Sense and description In his theory of descriptions, Bertrand Russell held the view that most proper names in ordinary language are in fact disguised definite descriptions. For example, 'Aristotle' can be understood as \\"The pupil of Plato and teacher of Alexander\\", or by some other uniquely applying description. This is known as the descriptivist theory of names. Because Frege used definite descriptions in many of his examples, he is often taken to have endorsed the descriptivist theory. Thus Russell's theory of descriptions was conflated with Frege's theory of sense, and for most of the twentieth century this \\"Frege‚ÄìRussell\\" view was the orthodox view of proper name semantics. However, Saul Kripke argued compellingly against the descriptivist theory. According to Kripke,Kripke, S. A., Naming and Necessity, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980, pp. 48-49. proper names are rigid designators which designate the same object in every possible world. Descriptions such as \\"the President of the U.S. in 1969\\" do not designate the same in every possible world. For example, someone other than Richard Nixon, e.g. Lyndon B. Johnson, might have been the President in 1969. Hence a description (or cluster of descriptions) cannot be a rigid designator, and thus a proper name cannot mean the same as a description.Naming and Necessity, p. 57. However, the Russellian descriptivist reading of Frege has been rejected by many scholars, in particular by Gareth Evans in The Varieties of Reference and by John McDowell in \\"The Sense and Reference of a Proper Name\\", following Michael Dummett, who argued that Frege's notion of sense should not be equated with a description. Evans further developed this line, arguing that a sense without a referent was not possible. He and McDowell both take the line that Frege's discussion of empty names, and of the idea of sense without reference, are inconsistent, and that his apparent endorsement of descriptivism rests only on a small number of imprecise and perhaps offhand remarks. And both point to the power that the sense-reference distinction does have (i.e., to solve at least the first two problems), even if it is not given a descriptivist reading. Translation of Bedeutung As noted above, translators of Frege have rendered the German Bedeutung in various ways. The term 'reference' has been the most widely adopted, but this fails to capture the meaning of the original German ('meaning' or 'significance'), and does not reflect the decision to standardise key terms across different editions of Frege's works published by Blackwell.According to Beaney (The Frege Reader, Oxford: Blackwell 1997, p. 36) 'the decision was taken at a meeting in the early 1970s attended by Michael Dummett, Peter Geach, William Kneale, Roger White and a representative from Blackwell. The translation of Bedeutung by 'meaning' was unanimously agreed after lengthy discussion'. The decision was based on the principle of exegetical neutrality, namely that 'if at any point in a text there is a passage that raises for the native speaker legitimate questions of exegesis, then, if at all possible, a translator should strive to confront the reader of his version with the same questions of exegesis and not produce a version which in his mind resolves those questions'.Long, P. and White, A., 'On the Translation of Frege's Bedeutung: A Reply to Dr. Bell', Analysis 40 pp. 196-202, 1980, p. 196. See also Bell, D., \\"On the Translation of Frege's Bedeutung\\", Analysis Vol. 40, No. 4 (Oct., 1980), pp. 191-195. The term 'meaning' best captures the standard German meaning of Bedeutung, and Frege's own use of the term sounds as odd when translated into English as it does in German. Moreover, 'meaning' captures Frege's early use of Bedeutung well,Beaney, p. 37 and it would be problematic to translate Frege's early use as 'meaning' and his later use as 'reference', suggesting a change in terminology not evident in the original German. Precursors =Antisthenes= The Greek philosopher Antisthenes, a pupil of Socrates, apparently distinguished \\"a general object that can be aligned with the meaning of the utterance‚Äù from ‚Äúa particular object of extensional reference\\". According to Susan Prince, this \\"suggests that he makes a distinction between sense and reference\\". p. 20. The principal basis of Prince's claim is a passage in Alexander of Aphrodisias' ‚ÄúComments on Aristotle's 'Topics'‚Äù with a three-way distinction: # the semantic medium, Œ¥Œπ' ·ΩßŒΩ ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒøœÖœÉŒπ # an object external to the semantic medium, œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œø·Ωó ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ # the direct indication of a thing, œÉŒ∑ŒºŒ±ŒØŒΩŒµŒπŒΩ ... œÑ·Ω∏ ...Prince 2015, pp. 518‚Äì522 (Antisthenes' literary remains: t. 153B.1). =Stoicism= The Stoic theory of lekta refers to a correspondence between speech and the object referred to by the speech, as distinct from the speech itself. This has been cited as an anticipation of the distinction between sense and reference.R. W. Sharples (1996), Stoics, Epicureans and Sceptics: An Introduction to Hellenistic Philosophy. Routledge, p. 23. =John Stuart Mill= The sense-reference distinction is commonly confused with that between connotation and denotation, which originates with John Stuart Mill.See section ¬ß5 of book I, chapter i of Mill's A System of Logic According to Mill, a common term like 'white' denotes all white things, as snow, paper. But according to Frege, a common term does not refer to any individual white thing, but rather to an abstract concept (Begriff). We must distinguish between the relation of reference, which holds between a proper name and the object it refers to, such as between the name 'Earth', and the planet Earth, and the relation of 'falling under', such as when the Earth falls under the concept planet. The relation of a proper name to the object it designates is direct, whereas a word like 'planet' has no such direct relation to the Earth at all, but only to a concept that the Earth falls under. Moreover, judging of anything that it falls under this concept is not in any way part of our knowledge of what the word 'planet' means.Frege, \\"A critical elucidation of some points in E. Schroeder's Vorlesungen Ueber Die Algebra der Logik, Archiv fur systematische Philosophie 1895, pp. 433-456, transl. Geach, in Geach & Black 86-106. The distinction between connotation and denotation is closer to that between concept and object, than to that between 'sense' and 'reference'.

The problem of empty names is that empty names have a meaning that it seems they should not have. The name \\"Pegasus\\" is empty;W. V. O. Quine, \\"On What There Is\\", The Review of Metaphysics 2(5), 1948. there is nothing to which it refers. Yet, though there is no Pegasus, we know what the sentence \\"Pegasus has two wings\\" means. We can even understand the sentence \\"There is no such thing as Pegasus.\\" But, what can the meaning of a proper name be, except the object to which it refers? Overview There are three broad ways which philosophers have tried to approach this problem. # The meaning of a proper name is not the same as the object (if there is any) it refers to. Hence, though \\"Pegasus\\" refers to nothing, it still has a meaning. The German philosopher Gottlob Frege seems to have held a theory of this sort. He says that the sentence Odysseus was set ashore at Ithaca while sound asleep' obviously has a sense. ... the thought [expressed by that sentence] remains the same whether 'Odysseus' has reference or not.\\" Bertrand Russell may also have held a similar theory, that a proper name is a disguised definite description that signifies some unique characteristic. If any object has this characteristic feature, the name has a referent. Otherwise it is empty. Perhaps \\"Aristotle\\" means \\"the teacher of Alexander\\". Since there was such a person, \\"Aristotle\\" refers to that person. By contrast, \\"Pegasus\\" may mean \\"the winged horse of Bellerophon\\". Since there was no such horse, the name has no referent. This is the so-called description theory of names. The difficulty with this account is that we may always use a proper name to deny that the individual bearing the name actually has some characteristic feature. So, we can meaningfully say that Aristotle was not the teacher of Alexander. But if \\"Aristotle\\" means \\"teacher of Alexander\\", it would follow that this assertion is self-contradictory, which it is not. Saul Kripke proposed this argument in a series of influential papers in the 1970s. Another difficulty is that different people may have different ideas about the defining characteristics of any individual. Yet we all understand what the name means. The sole information carried by the name seems to be the identity of the individual that it belongs to. This information therefore cannot be descriptive, it cannot describe the individual. As John Stuart Mill argued, a proper name tells us the identity of its bearer, without telling us anything else about it. Naming is rather like pointing. # A theory that became influential following Kripke's attack is that empty proper names, have, strictly speaking, no meaning. This is the so-called direct-reference theory. Versions of this theory have been defended by Keith Donnellan, David Kaplan, Nathan Salmon, Scott Soames and others. The problem with the direct-reference theory is that names appear to be meaningful independently of whether they are empty. Furthermore, negative existential statements using empty names are both true and apparently meaningful. How can \\"Pegasus does not exist\\" be true if the name \\"Pegasus\\", as used in that sentence, has no meaning? # There are no empty names. All names have a referent. The difficulty with this theory is how to distinguish names like \\"Pegasus\\" from names like \\"Aristotle\\". Any coherent account of this distinction seems to require that there are, i.e. there exist, objects that do not exist. Given that \\"Pegasus does not exist\\" is true, it follows that the referent of \\"Pegasus\\" does not exist. Hence there is something--the referent of \\"Pegasus\\"--that does not exist. Some philosophers, such as Alexius Meinong have argued that there are two senses of the verb \\"exists\\", exemplified by the sentence \\"there are things that do not exist\\". The first, signified by \\"there are\\", is the so-called \\"wide sense\\", including Pegasus, the golden mountain, the round square, and so on. The second, signified by \\"exist\\" is the so-called \\"narrow sense\\", encompassing only things that are real or existent. The difficulty with this \\"two sense\\" theory is that there is no strong evidence that there really are two such distinct senses of the verb \\"to be\\".  Fictional entities  Some philosophers employ the related concepts of \\"fictional entities\\" (such as Sherlock Holmes) who are deliberate inventions, and of \\"mythical entities\\" (such as Vulcan) that result from accidental mistakes.Braun, David. \\"Empty Names, Fictional Names, Mythical Names.\\" No√ªs 39(4) (2005): 596‚Äì631.

In particular, \\"curse\\" may refer to such a wish or pronouncement made effective by a supernatural or spiritual power, such as a god or gods, a spirit, or a natural force, or else as a kind of spell by magic or witchcraft; in the latter sense, a curse can also be called a hex or a jinx. In many belief systems, the curse itself (or accompanying ritual) is considered to have some causative force in the result. To reverse or eliminate a curse is sometimes called \\"removal\\" or \\"breaking\\", as the spell has to be dispelled, and is often requiring elaborate rituals or prayers.  Types  Ancient Greek curse written on a lead sheet, 4th century BC, Kerameikos Archaeological Museum, Athens. The study of the forms of curses comprise a significant proportion of the study of both folk religion and folklore. The deliberate attempt to levy curses is often part of the practice of magic. In Hindu culture the Sage or Rishi is believed to have the power to bless (ƒÄshirvada or Vara) and curse (Shrapa). Examples include the curse placed by Rishi Bhrigu on king Nahusha and the one placed by Rishi Devala. Special names for specific types of curses can be found in various cultures: * African American hoodoo presents us with the jinx and crossed conditions, as well as a form of foot track magic which was used by Ramandeep, whereby cursed objects are laid in the paths of victims and activated when walked over. * Middle Eastern and Mediterranean culture is the source of the belief in the evil eye, which may be the result of envy but or, more rarely, is said to be the result of a deliberate curse. In order to be protected from the evil eye, a protection item is made from dark blue circular glass, with a circle of white around the black dot in the middle, which is reminiscent of a human eye. The size of the protective eye item may vary. * German people, including the Pennsylvania Dutch speak in terms of hexing (from hexen, the German word for doing witchcraft), and a common hex in days past was that laid by a stable- witch who caused milk cows to go dry and horses to go lame. * Kuru curse is a Prion infection caused by Cannibalism (eating one's own species), and does not involve any bacteria or virus. This curse effects the violator and his/her decedents. Animals feasting on their own species will also be victims of this curse, such as cow eating other cows will get infected with mad cow disease. Bible Shimei curses David, 1860 woodcut by Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld According to the Catholic Encyclopedia article Cursing, the Bible depicts God cursing the serpent, the earth, and Cain (, ,On Genesis 3:17 cf. Andreas Dorschel, 'Entwurf einer Theorie des Fluchens', Variations 23 (2015), ¬ß 29, pp. 167‚Äì175, pp. 174‚Äì175 ). Similarly Noah curses Canaan (), and Joshua curses the man who should build the city of Jericho (). In various books of the Hebrew Bible there are long lists of curses against transgressors of the Law (, , etc.). The 10 Plagues of Egypt, preceding the 10 Commandments, can be seen as curses cast from the rods of Aaron and Moses acting on instruction from the God of Israel, in order to enable the enthralled to come free from the yoke of enforced serfdom, slavery and the like. In the New Testament, Christ curses the barren fig-tree (), pronounces his denunciation of woe against the incredulous cities (), against the rich, the worldly, the scribes and the Pharisees, and foretells the awful malediction that is to come upon the damned (). The word curse is also applied to the victim of expiation for sin (Galatians 3:13), to sins temporal and eternal (; ).\\" Egyptians and mummies Limestone donation-stele from Mendes, 3rd Intermediate Period, Dynasty XXII. The inscription celebrates a donation of land to an Egyptian temple, and places a curse on anyone who would misuse or appropriate the land. There is a broad popular belief in curses being associated with the violation of the tombs of mummified corpses, or of the mummies themselves. The idea became so widespread as to become a pop-culture mainstay, especially in horror films (though originally the curse was invisible, a series of mysterious deaths, rather than the walking-dead mummies of later fiction). The \\"Curse of the Pharaohs\\" is supposed to have haunted the archeologists who excavated the tomb of Pharaoh Tutankhamun, whereby an imprecation was supposedly pronounced from the grave by the ancient Egyptian priests, on anyone who violated its precincts. Similar dubious suspicions have surrounded the excavation and examination of the (natural, not embalmed) Alpine mummy, \\"√ñtzi the Iceman\\". While such curses are generally considered to have been popularized and sensationalized by British journalists of the 19th century, ancient Egyptians were in fact known to place curse inscriptions on markers protecting temple or tomb goods or property. Objects Ancient Greek cursed object against enemies in a trial, written on a lead figurine put in a lead box, 420-410 BC, Kerameikos Archaeological Museum, Athens. Cursed objects are generally supposed to have been stolen from their rightful owners or looted from a sanctuary. The Hope Diamond is supposed to bear such a curse, and bring misfortune to its owner. The stories behind why these items are cursed vary, but they usually are said to bring bad luck or to manifest unusual phenomena related to their presence. Busby's stoop chair was reportedly cursed by the murderer Thomas Busby shortly before his execution so that everyone who would sit in it would die. As plot devices Curses have also been used as plot devices in literature and theater. When used as a plot device they involve one character placing a curse or hex over another character. This is distinguished from adverse spells and premonitions and other such plot devices. Examples of the curse as a plot device are the following: * Rigoletto‚Äî Count Monterone places a curse on Rigoletto. Rigoletto blames the climactic death of his daughter on the curse. * Romeo and Juliet‚Äî A dying Mercutio curses the Montagues and Capulets with \\"A plague 'o both your houses.\\" (Often quoted as \\"a pox on both your houses.\\") * Sleeping Beauty ‚Äî Evil witch Maleficent casts a curse on Princess Aurora to die on her 16th birthday. * Beauty and the Beast ‚Äî Enchantress punishes a conceited prince by transforming him into a hideous beast. * Shrek ‚Äî Princess Fiona was cursed by a witch; to be human by day, but ogre by night. * There Will Be Blood ‚Äî Daniel Plainview was cursed by Eli Sunday through \\"blessing\\" of Daniel's oil rig and through \\"baptism\\". * Drag Me To Hell - Christine Brown was cursed by Sylvia Ganush to experience 3 days of torture, then the lamia will drag her to hell. Sports A number of curses are used to explain the failures or misfortunes of specific sports teams, players, or even cities. For example: * No first-time winner of the World Snooker Championship has successfully defended his title since the event was first held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield in 1977. This has been widely attributed to a Crucible Curse. * The Curse of the Billy Goat was used to explain the failures of the Chicago Cubs baseball team, who did not win a World Series championship between 1908 and 2016, and a National League pennant between 1945 and 2016. * There was a famous curse called the Curse of the Bambino on the Boston Red Sox Major League Baseball team. After the Red Sox sold Babe Ruth, who had won 3 of the 5 Red Sox World Series titles at the time, to the New York Yankees where he won his final 4 titles, it took the Red Sox 86 years to win another World Series (1918-2004). In 2004 the Red Sox made history in the American League Championship Series (ALCS) coming back from 0 games to 3, winning 4 games in a row against their archrivals the New York Yankees blowing out game 7 in the Bronx 10 to 3, this is cited as one of the greatest comebacks in sports history. The Red Sox secured the AL Pennant and then went on to sweep the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series, 4 games to 0 ending the curse once and for all. Three years later they would win sweep again in the 2007 World Series against the Colorado Rockies, and in they added a third championship by defeating the Cardinals 4 games to 2. * The Krukow Kurse was used to explain the San Francisco Giants' failure to ever win the World Series until 2010. It is attributed to Mike Krukow (a former pitcher for the Giants and a current broadcaster for the team) based upon his yearly pre-season predictions that the Giants \\"have a chance\\" to win the World Series. Once Krukow stops making such predictions‚Äîsays the legend‚Äîthe Giants will, in fact, win the World Series. However, the Giants went on to win the World Series in 2010. It was during the same year that Krukow's partner, Giants broadcaster, Duane Kuiper stated \\"Giants baseball, it's torture!\\", due to the large amount of close games that they played. This phrase was adopted by fans and became a rallying cry throughout the second half of the season and the playoff run. * Marketing experts have highlighted the curse of Gillette, given the mishaps that happen to sports stars associated with the brand.

Harrison (September 20, 1930 ‚Äì January 28, 2020) was an American radio personality, primarily in New York City, for over 50 years. Harrison is the only DJ to be a WMCA \\"Good Guy\\", a WABC \\"All-American\\", and on the WCBS-FM line-up when the New York station flipped to the \\"Jack\\" format in June 2005. He was known as New York's \\"Morning Mayor\\".  Early  Harry M. Harrison was born on Sept. 20, 1930 in Chicago, Illinois to Harry Harrison and Mary (McKenna) Harrison. He attended a seminary with the intention of becoming a priest. Bedridden with rheumatic fever for nearly a year, he kept his ear glued to the radio, which decided him on a broadcasting career. He began his radio career at WCFL in 1953, later hosting a morning show at WPEO in Peoria before moving to New York City. Career =WCFL, Chicago, Illinois (1953‚Äì1954)= Harrison worked at WCFL as a summer replacement, yet remained there eight months, substituting for the permanent DJs. =WPEO, Peoria, Illinois (1954‚Äì1959)= Harrison became program director at WPEO, Peoria and hosted the morning show as the \\"Morning Mayor of Peoria.\\" In just six months, Harrison made WPEO the top station. =WMCA, New York (1959‚Äì1968)= In 1959, Harrison joined WMCA, New York, as the mid-day \\"Good Guy.\\" Joe O'Brien (mornings) and Harrison gave WMCA a \\"one-two punch\\" for over eight years. Harrison, along with wife Patti, and children Brian Joseph [\\"B.J.\\"], Patti, Patrick, and Michael called the New York suburbs \\"home\\". In 1965, he recorded the holiday narration \\"May You Always\\", which was released as a single on Amy Records and made the Billboard Christmas singles chart that year. Other WMCA \\"Good Guys\\" included Jack Spector, B. Mitchel Reed, Dan Daniel and Johnny Dark, and talk show host Barry Gray. Harrison became popular with his \\"Housewife Hall of Fame‚Äù feature, and participated in the 1966 WMCA Good Guy picnic. Often, he scored the highest ratings on WMCA. and WABC program director Rick Sklar took note. =WABC‚ÄìAM, New York (1968‚Äì1979)= In 1968, when WABC morning man Herb Oscar Anderson left the station, Rick Sklar hired Harrison to replace him. Harrison was followed in the WABC day by Ron Lundy. Every year, Harrison played seasonal songs, such as his holiday greeting \\"May You Always‚Äù in the winter (the Amy records single of this song made the Billboard Christmas charts in 1965), and Allan Sherman's summer camp novelty, \\"Hello Muddah, Hello Fadduh\\", throughout the summer months. WABC personalities included, along with Harrison; Charlie Greer, Scott Muni, Bob Lewis, Lundy, Johnny Donovan, Dan Ingram, Bruce Morrow aka \\"Cousin Brucie\\", Chuck Leonard, Bob Cruz, Frank Kingston Smith, and Roby Yonge, and Jay Reynolds. Harrison had a number of \\"trademark\\" phrases, such as \\"Morning, Mom\\"; \\"Every brand new day should be unwrapped like a precious gift\\"; \\"Stay well, stay happy, stay right here\\"; and \\"Harry Harrison wishing you all the very best... because that's exactly what you deserve!‚Äù Also, on the last day of every year, Harrison would bring his four children to work with him and at the end of his shift, he would join them in giving listeners New Year's wishes. Harrison was let go from WABC as the station changed direction in November 1979. =WCBS‚ÄìFM, New York (1980‚Äì2003)= On March 24, 1980, Harrison became the morning personality at WCBS-FM (101.1), playing oldies music. In 1984, with Lundy joining the station, they were once again heard back-to-back. Harrison would interact with Morning Crew engineer Al Vertucci, Phil Pepe, who reported sports, and joke about \\"wacky weather\\" and toupee warnings with Irv ‚ÄúMr. ‚ÄúG‚Äù Gikofsky (weather), Mary Jane Royce, and Sue Evans. At 7:20 AM, Harrison opened the \\"birthday book\\" and announced listener and celebrity birthdays. On March 19, 2003, after a 44-year career in New York radio, Harrison left WCBS-FM, saying \\"I am not retiring.\\" His farewell to his loyal radio friends (from 5:30 to 10:00am) was held before a live audience at the Museum of Television and Radio in New York City. It offered old airchecks plus guest appearances by WCBS-FM colleagues Don K. Reed, Bobby Jay, Steve O'Brien, Randy Davis and Dan Taylor, his replacement, as well as his son and daughter, Patti.

They are usually leavened by baking powder.The acid-base reaction effected by baking powder mixed with the water-based liquids in the dough releases gas that causes the bread to rise during baking. Yeast is a living organism that releases gas under low-temperature conditions as it rises before baking. The yeast bodies continue rising so long as sufficient nutrients and proper warmth exist. During baking the temperature exceeds that which the yeast bodies can tolerate, and they die. History Cornbread, prepared as a muffin Native Americans had been using ground corn (maize) as food for thousands of yearsTeosinte was known in Rio Balsas (Mexico) valley from 9000 BP and was introduced in what is now the United States by the Anasazis circa 1000 AD before Europeans arrived in the New World. European settlers, especially those who resided in the English Southern Colonies, learned the original recipes and processes for corn dishes from the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Creek, and soon they devised recipes for using cornmeal in breads similar to those made of grains available in Europe. Cornbread has been called a \\"cornerstone\\" of the cuisine of the Southern United States. Cornmeal is produced by grinding dry raw corn grains. A coarser meal (compare flour) made from corn is grits. Grits are produced by soaking raw corn grains in hot water containing calcium hydroxide (an alkaline salt), which loosens the grain hulls (bran) and increases the nutritional value of the product (by increasing available niacin and available amino acids). These are separated by washing and flotation in water, and the now softened slightly swelled grains are called hominy. Hominy, pozole in Mexican Spanish, also is ground into masa harina for arepas, tamales and tortillas. This ancient Native American technology has been named nixtamalization. Besides cornbread, Native Americans used corn to make numerous other dishes from the familiar hominy grits to alcoholic beverages (such as Andean chicha). Cornbread was popular during the American Civil War because it was very cheap and could be made in many different forms‚Äîhigh-rising, fluffy loaves or simply fried (as unleavened pone, corn fritters, hoecakes, etc.). Types of cornbread Cornbread is a popular item in Southern cooking enjoyed by many people for its texture and aroma. Cornbread can be baked, fried, or (rarely) steamed. Steamed cornbread is mushy, chewier, and more like cornmeal pudding than what most consider to be traditional cornbread. Cornbread can also be baked into corn cakes. =Baked cornbread= Home-baked cornbread made with blue cornmeal Cornbread is a common bread in United States cuisine, particularly associated with the South and Southwest, as well as being a traditional staple for populations where wheat flour was more expensive. Cornbread, especially leftovers, can be eaten as a breakfast. It is also widely eaten with barbecue and chili con carne. In parts of the southern and southwestern United States, cornbread, accompanied by pinto beans, has been a common lunch for many people. It is still a common side dish for many suppers, often served with butter. Cornbread crumbs are also used in some poultry stuffings; cornbread stuffing is particularly associated with Thanksgiving turkeys. In the United States, northern and southern cornbread are different because they generally use different types of corn meal and varying degrees of sugar and eggs.Cooks Illustrated Magazine, Baking Illustrated. Brookline, MA: America's Test Kitchen, 2004, Southern cornbread has traditionally been made with little or no sugar and smaller amounts of flour (or no flour), with northern cornbread being sweeter and more cake-like. Southern cornbread traditionally used white cornmeal and buttermilk. Other ingredients such as pork rinds are sometimes used. Cornbread is occasionally crumbled and served with cold milk or clabber (buttermilk), similar to cold cereal. In Texas, Mexican influence has spawned a hearty cornbread made with fresh or creamed corn kernels and jalape√±o peppers and topped with shredded cheese. Cornbread is typically eaten with molasses in the southern states and with butter and honey in the northern states of America. Skillet-fried or skillet-baked cornbread (often simplified to cornbread or skillet bread) is a traditional staple in the rural United States, especially in the South. This involves heating bacon drippings, lard or other oil in a heavy, well-seasoned cast iron skillet in an oven, and then pouring a batter made from cornmeal, egg, and milk directly into the hot grease. The mixture is returned to the oven to bake into a large, crumbly and sometimes very moist cake with a crunchy crust. This bread tends to be dense and is usually served as an accompaniment rather than as a bread served as a regular course. In addition to the skillet method, such cornbread also may be made in sticks, muffins, or loaves. A slightly different variety, cooked in a simple baking dish, is associated with northern U.S. cuisine. The batter for northern-style cornbread is very similar to and sometimes interchangeable with that of a corn muffin. A typical contemporary northern U.S. cornbread recipe contains half wheat flour, half cornmeal, milk or buttermilk, eggs, leavening agent, salt, and usually sugar, resulting in a bread that is somewhat lighter and sweeter than the traditional southern version. Unlike fried variants of cornbread, baked cornbread is a quick bread that is dependent on an egg-based protein matrix for its structure (though the addition of wheat flour adds gluten to increase its cohesiveness). The baking process gelatinizes the starch in the cornmeal, but still often leaves some hard starch to give the finished product a distinctive sandiness not typical of breads made from other grains. =Cracklin' bread= A primarily Southern dish consisting of cornbread with pork cracklings inside. It can be prepared with any method but a skillet is most common as it allows for making the cornbread crispier. =Corn pone= Corn pone (sometimes referred to as \\"Indian pone\\") is a type of cornbread made from a thick, malleable cornmeal dough (which is usually egg-less and milk-less) and cooked in a specific type of iron pan over an open fire (such as a frontiersman would use), using mostly bacon grease, but later, butter, margarine, shortening, or cooking oil. Corn pones are a staple of Southern U.S. cuisine, and have been discussed or referenced by many American writers, including Mark Twain.http://www.paulgraham.com/cornpone.html. Retrieved 7 November 2013 In the Appalachian Mountains, cornbread baked in a round iron skillet, or in a cake pan of any shape, is still referred to as a \\"pone\\" of cornbread (as opposed to \\"hoe cakes\\", the term for cornbread fried in pancake style); and when biscuit dough (i.e., \\"biscuits\\" in the American sense of the word) is occasionally baked in one large cake rather than as separate biscuits, this is called a \\"biscuit pone\\". The term \\"corn pone\\" is sometimes used derogatorily to refer to one who possesses certain rural, unsophisticated peculiarities (\\"he's a corn pone\\"), or as an adjective to describe particular rural, folksy or \\"hick\\" characteristics (e.g., \\"corn pone\\" humor). This pejorative term often is directed at persons from rural areas of the southern and midwestern United States. A character in the Lil' Abner comic strip, General Jubilation T Cornpone, was a mythical Civil War general from Dogpatch known for his retreats and imputed cowardice. President John F. Kennedy's staffers, who were mostly Northeastern Ivy League elites, openly mocked Texan Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's rural speech patterns, referring to Johnson behind his back as 'Uncle Cornpone' or 'Rufus Cornpone'.The Passage of Power: The Years of Lyndon Johnson, pub. Deckle Edge, , =Hot water cornbread= Cooked on a rangetop, one frying method involves pouring a small amount of liquid batter made with boiling water and self- rising cornmeal (cornmeal with soda or some other chemical leavener added) into a skillet of hot oil, and allowing the crust to turn golden and crunchy while the center of the batter cooks into a crumbly, mushy bread. These small (3-4\\" diameter) fried breads are soft and very rich. Sometimes, to ensure the consistency of the bread, a small amount of wheat flour is added to the batter. This type of cornbread is often known as \\"hot water\\" or \\"scald meal\\" cornbread and is unique to the American South. =Johnnycakes= Johnnycakes on a plate Pouring a batter similar to that of skillet-fried cornbread, but slightly thinner, into hot grease atop a griddle or a skillet produces a pancake-like bread called a johnnycake. This type of cornbread is prevalent in New England, particularly in Rhode Island, and also in the American Midwest and the American South. It is reminiscent of the term hoecake, used in the American South for fried cornbread pancakes, which may date back to stories about some people on the frontier making cornbread patties on the blade of a hoe. =Hushpuppies= A thicker buttermilk-based batter that is deep-fried rather than pan-fried, forms the hushpuppy, a common accompaniment to fried fish and other seafood in the South. Hushpuppy recipes vary from state to state, some including onion seasoning, chopped onions, beer, or jalape√±os. Fried properly, the hushpuppy will be moist and yellow or white on the inside, while crunchy and light to medium-dark golden brown on the outside.

Germany is the largest music market in Europe, and third largest in the world. German classical music is one of the most performed in the world; German composers include some of the most accomplished and popular in history, among them Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Friedrich H√§ndel, Ludwig van Beethoven, Felix Mendelssohn, Johannes Brahms, Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (also recognized as Austrian) was among the composers who created the field of German opera. One of the most famous film score composers is Hans Zimmer. German popular music of the 20th and 21st century includes the movements of Neue Deutsche Welle (Nena, Hubert Kah, Alphaville), Disco (Boney M., Modern Talking, Dschinghis Khan, Milli Vanilli, Bad Boys Blue), Metal/Rock (Rammstein, Scorpions, Accept, Helloween), Punk (Die √Ñrzte, B√∂hse Onkelz, Nina Hagen, Die Toten Hosen), Pop rock (Sandra, Enigma, Michael Cretu, Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer) and Indie (Tocotronic). Famous female singers were Marlene Dietrich and Hildegard Knef. German Electronic music gained global influence, with Kraftwerk and Tangerine Dream being pioneer groups in this genre. The Electro and Techno scene being internationally popular with Paul van Dyk and Scooter. Germany hosts many large rock music festivals. The Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festival is among the largest in the world. Since about 1990 the new-old German capital Berlin has developed a diverse music and entertainment industry.  Minnesingers and Meistersingers  The beginning of what is now considered German music could be traced back to the 12th-century compositions of mystic abbess Hildegard of Bingen, who wrote a variety of hymns and other kinds of Christian music. After Latin-language religious music had dominated for centuries, in the 12th century to the 14th centuries, Minnesinger (love poets), singing in German, spread across Germany. Minnesinger were aristocrats, traveling from court to court, who had become musicians, and their work left behind a vast body of literature, Minnelieder. The following two centuries saw the Minnesinger replaced by middle-class Meistersinger, who were often master craftsmen in their main profession, whose music was much more formalized and rule-based than that of the Minnesinger. Minnesinger and Meistersinger could be considered parallels of French troubadours and trouv√®re. Among the Minnesinger, Hermann, a monk from Salzburg, deserves special note. He incorporated folk styles from the Alpine regions in his compositions. He made some primitive forays into polyphony as well. Walther von der Vogelweide and Reinmar von Hagenau are probably the most famous minnesingers from this period.  Classical music  Germans have played a leading role in the development of classical music. Many of the best classical musicians such as Bach, H√§ndel, Beethoven, Schumann, Brahms, Wagner, Mahler, or Schoenberg (a lineage labeled the \\"German Stem\\" by Igor Stravinsky) were German. At the beginning of the 15th century, German classical music was revolutionized by Oswald von Wolkenstein, who travelled across Europe learning about classical traditions, spending time in countries like France and Italy. He brought back some techniques and styles to his homeland, and within a hundred years, Germany had begun producing composers renowned across the continent. Among the first of these composers was the organist Conrad Paumann. The largest summer festival for classical music in Germany is the Schleswig- Holstein Musik Festival. = Chorale = Beginning in the 16th century, polyphony, or the intertwining of multiple melodies, arrived in Germany. Protestant chorales predominated; in contrast to Catholic music, chorale was vibrant and energetic. Composers included Dieterich Buxtehude, Heinrich Sch√ºtz and Martin Luther, leader of the Protestant Reformation. Luther happened to accompany his sung hymns with a lute, later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of Germany in the 20th century. = Opera = J. S. Bach W. A. Mozart, 1777 Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te (1791) is usually said to be the beginning of German opera. An earlier starting date for German opera, however, could be Heinrich Sch√ºtz's Dafne from 1627. Sch√ºtz is said to be the first great German composer before Johann Sebastian Bach, and was a major figure in 17th-century music. In the 19th century, two figures were paramount in German opera: Carl Maria von Weber and Richard Wagner. Wagner introduced devices like the Leitmotiv, a musical theme which recurs for important characters or ideas. Wagner (and Weber) based his operas of German history and folklore, most importantly including the Ring of the Nibelung (1874). Into the 20th century, opera composers included Richard Strauss (Der Rosenkavalier) and Engelbert Humperdinck, who wrote operas meant for young audiences. Across the border in Austria, Arnold Schoenberg innovated a form of twelve-tone music that used rhythm and dissonance instead of traditional melodies and harmonies, while Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht collaborated on some of the great works of German theater, including Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny and The Three-Penny Opera. Following the war, German composers like Karlheinz Stockhausen and Hans Werner Henze began experimenting electronic sounds in classical music. Germany is also very well known for its many subsidised opera houses, such as Semperoper, Munich State Theatre and the Bayreuth Festspielhaus. = Baroque period = Baroque music, which was the first music to use tonality in the modern sense, is also known for its ornamentation and artistic use of counterpoint. It originated in Northern Italy at the end of the 16th century, and the style migrated quickly to Germany, which was one of the most active centers of early Baroque music. Early German Baroque composers included Heinrich Sch√ºtz, Michael Praetorius, Johann Hermann Schein, and Samuel Scheidt. The culmination of the Baroque era was undoubtedly in the works of Johann Sebastian Bach and Georg Friedrich H√§ndel in the first half of the 18th century. Bach established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and adapted rhythms, forms, and textures from Italy and France. Bach wrote numerous works, including preludes, cantatas, fugues, concertos for harpsichord, violin and wind, orchestral suites, the Brandenburg Concertos, St Matthew Passion, St John Passion and the Christmas Oratorio. H√§ndel was a cosmopolitan composer that wrote music for virtually every genre of his time. His most famous works include the orchestral suites Water Music, Music for the Royal Fireworks and the oratorio Messiah. Another important composer was Georg Philipp Telemann, one of the most prolific musicians in history. = Classical era = Ludwig van Beethoven By the middle of the 18th century, the cities of Vienna, Dresden, Berlin and Mannheim had become the center for orchestral music. The Esterh√°zy princes of Vienna, for example, were the patrons of Joseph Haydn, an Austrian who invented the classic format of the string quartet, symphony and sonata. Later that century, Vienna's Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart emerged, mixing German and Italian traditions into his own style. Mozart was a prolific and influential composer who composed over 600 works, many acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, concertante, chamber, operatic, and choral music. He is among the most popular of classical composers, and his influence on subsequent Western art music is profound; Ludwig van Beethoven composed his own early works in the shadow of Mozart. = Romantic era = Robert Schumann Carl Maria von Weber Johannes Brahms Richard Wagner Franz Schubert in 1825 (watercolor by Wilhelm August Rieder) The following century saw two major German composers come to fame early‚ÄîLudwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert. Beethoven, a student of Haydn's in Vienna, used unusually daring harmonies and rhythm and composed numerous pieces for piano, violin, symphonies, chamber music, string quartets and an opera. Schubert created a field of artistic, romantic poetry and music called lied; his lieder cycles included Die sch√∂ne M√ºllerin and Winterreise.John Deathridge, \\"The Invention of German Music, c. 1800\\", United and Diversity in European Culture c. 1800, ed. Tim Blanning and Hagen Schulze (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 35‚Äì60. Franz Schubert was extremely prolific during his lifetime. His output consists of over six hundred secular vocal works (mainly Lieder), seven complete symphonies, sacred music, operas, incidental music and a large body of chamber and piano music. He is ranked among the greatest composers of the late Classical era and early Romantic era. Early in the 19th century, a composer by the name of Richard Wagner was born. He was a \\"Musician of the Future\\" who disliked the strict traditionalist styles of music. He is credited with developing leitmotivs which were simple recurring themes found in his operas. Carl Maria von Weber was a composer, conductor, pianist, guitaristMax Maria Weber, Carl Maria von Weber: The Life of an Artist, translated by John Palgrave Simpson, two volumes (London: Chapman and Hall, 1865), 1:52, 62, 94, 137, 143, 152, 177, 211, 244, 271, 278; John Warrack, Carl Maria von Weber, second edition (Cambridge, New York, and Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 1976), 67, 94, 107, 141. and critic, one of the first significant composers of the Romantic school. His operas Der Freisch√ºtz, Euryanthe and Oberon greatly influenced the development of the Romantic opera in Germany. Felix Mendelssohn was a composer, pianist, organist and conductor of the early Romantic period. He was particularly well received in Britain as a composer, conductor and soloist. He wrote symphonies, concerti, oratorios, piano music and chamber music. Robert Schumann was a composer and influential music critic. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Romantic era. Schumann's published compositions were written exclusively for the piano until 1840; he later composed works for piano and orchestra; many Lieder (songs for voice and piano); four symphonies; an opera; and other orchestral, choral, and chamber works. Johannes Brahms honored the music pioneered by Mozart and Beethoven and advanced his music into a Romantic idiom, in the process creating bold new approaches to harmony and melody. The later 19th century saw Vienna continue its elevated position in European classical music, as well as a burst of popularity with Viennese waltzes. These were composed by people like Johann Strauss the Younger. Richard Strauss was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early modern eras. He is known for his operas, which include Der Rosenkavalier and Salome; his lieder, especially his Four Last Songs; and his tone poems. Strauss, along with Gustav Mahler, represents the late flowering of German Romanticism after Richard Wagner, in which pioneering subtleties of orchestration are combined with an advanced harmonic style. = 20th century = Paul Hindemith Carl Orff The first half of 20th century saw a split between German and Austrian music. In Vienna, Arnold Schoenberg and his pupils Alban Berg and Anton Webern moved along an increasingly avant-garde path, pioneering atonal music in 1909 and twelve-tone music in 1923. Meanwhile, composers in Berlin took a more populist route, from the cabaret- like socialist operas of Kurt Weill to the Gebrauchsmusik of Paul Hindemith. In Munich there was also Carl Orff, who was influenced by the French Impressionist composer Claude Debussy. He began to use colorful, unusual combinations of instruments in his orchestration. His most popular work is Carmina Burana. Many composers emigrated to the United States when the Nazi Party came to power, including Schoenberg, Hindemith, and Erich Korngold. During this period, the Nazi Party embarked on a campaign to rid Germany of so-called degenerate art, which became a catch-all phrase that included music with any link to Jews, Communists, jazz, and anything else thought to be dangerous. Some figures such as Karl Amadeus Hartmann remained defiantly in Germany during the years of Nazi dominance, continually watchful of how their output might be interpreted by the authorities. After the dissolution of the Third Reich, musicians were also subjected to the Allied policy of denazification. But here, the supposed non-political nature of music was able to excuse many, including Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler and Herbert von Karajan (who had actually joined the Nazi Party in 1933). They both claimed to have concentrated mainly on music and to have ignored politics, but also to have conducted pieces in ways that were meant to be \\"gestures of defiance.\\"Monod, David, Settling Scores: German music, denazification, and the Americans, 1945‚Äì1953 (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press, 2005) In West Germany in the second half of the 20th century, German and Austrian music was largely dominated by the avant-garde. In the 60s and 70s, the Darmstadt New Music Summer School was a major center of European modernism; German composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen and Hans Werner Henze and non-German ones such as Pierre Boulez and Luciano Berio all studied there. In contrast, composers in East Germany were advised to avoid the avant-garde and to compose music in keeping with the tenets of Socialist Realism.Kmetz, John, et al., \\"Germany\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 20 Oct. 2008 Music written in this style was supposed to advance party politics as well as be more accessible to all.Mehner, Klaus, \\"Deutschland ab 1945: Deutsche Demokratische Republik\\", vol. 2, Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart, ed. Ludwig Finscher (Kassel: B√§renreiter, 1995), 1188‚Äì1191 Hanns Eisler and Ernst Hermann Meyer were among the most famous of the first generation of GDR composers. More recently, composers such as Helmut Lachenmann and Olga Neuwirth have extensively explored the possibilities of extended techniques. Hans Werner Henze largely dissociated himself from the Darmstadt school in favour of a more lyrical approach, and remains perhaps Germany's most lauded contemporary composer. Although he had lived outside the country since the 1950s and until his death in 2012, he remained influenced by the Germanic musical tradition.  Folk music  Germany has many unique regions with their own folk traditions of music and dance. Much of the 20th century saw German culture appropriated for the ruling powers (who fought \\"foreign\\" music at the same time). Heino, is a Schlager and Volksmusik singer. In both East and West Germany, folk songs called \\"volkslieder\\" were taught to children; these were popular, sunny and optimistic, and had little relation to authentic German folk traditions. Inspired by American and English roots revivals, Germany underwent many of the same changes following the 1968 student revolution in West Germany, and new songs, featuring political activism and realistic joy, sadness and passion, were written and performed on the burgeoning folk scene. In East Germany, the same process did not begin until the mid-70s, where some folk musicians began incorporating revolutionary ideas in coded songs. Popular folk songs included emigration songs from the 19th century, work songs and songs of apprentices, as well as democracy-oriented folk songs collected in the 1950s by Wolfgang Steinitz. Beginning in 1970, the Festival des politischen Liedes, an East German festival focusing on political songs, was held annually and organized (until 1980) by the FDJ (East German youth association). Musicians from up to thirty countries would participate, and, for many East Germans, it was the only exposure possible to foreign music. Among foreign musicians at the festival, some were quite renowned, including Inti-Illimani (Chile), Billy Bragg (England), Dick Gaughan (Scotland), Mercedes Sosa (Argentina) and Pete Seeger (United States), while German performers included, from both East and West, Oktoberklub, Wacholder and Hannes Wader. Oom-pah is a kind of music played by the brass bands; it is associated with beer halls. = Bavaria and Swabia = Bavarian folk music is likely the most well known outside of Germany. Yodeling and schuhplattler dancers are among the stereotyped images of German folk life, though these are only found today in the southernmost areas, and to cater to tourists. Bavarian folk music has played a role in the Alpine New Wave, and produced several pioneering world music groups that fuse traditional Bavarian sounds with foreign styles. Around the turn of the 20th century, across Europe and especially in Bavaria, many people became concerned about a loss of cultural traditions. This idea was connected to the Heimatschutz movement, which sought to protect regional identities and boundaries. What is considered Bavarian folk music in modern Germany is not the same as what Bavarian folk music was in the early 20th century; like any kind of folk or popular music, styles and traditions have evolved over time, giving birth to new forms of music. The popularity of the Volkss√§nger (people's singer) in Bavaria began in the 1880s, and continued in earnest until the 1920s. Shows consisting of duets, ensemble songs, humor and parodies were popular, but the format began changing significantly following World War I. Bally Prell, the \\"Beauty Queen of Schneizlreuth\\", was emblematic of this change. She was an attractive tenor who sang lieder, chanson and opera and operetta. Swabian folk music is most popularly represented by acts like Saiten Fell and Firlefanz and the singer-songwriter (and player of the hurdy-gurdy and guitar) Thomas Felder. =Christmas carols= Some Christmas carols familiar in English are translations of German Christmas songs (Weihnachtslieder). Pastoral Weihnachtslieder are sometimes called Hirtenlieder (shepherd songs). Three well-known examples are \\"O Tannenbaum\\" (\\"O Christmas Tree\\"), from a German folksong arranged by Ernst Ansch√ºtz; \\"Silent Night\\" (\\"Stille Nacht, heilige Nacht\\"), by the Austrians Franz Xaver Gruber and Joseph Mohr; and \\"Still, still, still\\", an Austrian folksong also from the Salzburg region, based on an 1819 melody by S√ºss, with the original words, slightly changed over time and location, by G. G√∂tsch.  Early popular music  Marlene Dietrich Between World War I and World War II, German music branched out to form new, more liberal and independent styles. = Kabarett = The first form of German pop music is said to be cabaret, which arose during the Weimar Republic in the 1920s as the sensual music of late-night clubs. Marlene Dietrich and Margo Lion were among the most famous performers of the period, and became associated with both humorous satire and liberal ideas. = Swing Movement = The strict regimentation of youth culture in Nazi Germany through the Hitler Youth led to the emergence of several underground protest movements, through which adolescents were able better to exert their independence. One of these consisted mainly of upper middle class youths, who based their protest on their musical preferences, rejecting the v√∂lkisch music propagated by the Party in place of American jazz forms, especially Swing. While musical preferences are often a feature of youthful rebellion‚Äîas the history of rock and roll shows‚Äîjazz and especially Swing were particularly offensive to the Nazi hierarchy: not only did they promote sexual permissiveness, but they were also associated with the American enemy and worse, with the African race they considered inferior. On the other hand, Joseph Goebbels assembled some of the now jobless musicians from Germany and conquered countries into a big band called Charlie and His Orchestra.  Popular music from West Germany  After World War II, German pop music was greatly influenced by music from USA and Great Britain. Apart from Schlager and Liedermacher, it is necessary to distinguish between pop music in West Germany and pop music in East Germany which developed in different directions. Pop music from West Germany was often heard in East Germany, had more variety and is still present today, while East German music has had little influence. In West Germany, English-language pop music became more and more important, and today most songs on the radio are English. Nevertheless, there is great diversity in German language pop music. There is also original English- language pop music from Germany, some having international success (for instance the Scorpions and James Last), but little with enduring broad success in Germany itself. There was very little English pop music from East Germany. Germany has also had a thriving English-language pop scene since the end of the war, with several European and American acts topping the charts. However, Germans and German-oriented musicians have been successful as well. In the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century such European pop acts were popular as well as artists like Sarah Connor, No Angels and Monrose who performed various types of mainstream pop in English. Many of these acts have had success all over Europe and Asia. = Schlager and Volksmusik = Schlager is a kind of vocal pop music, frequently in the form of sentimental ballads sung in German, popularized by singers such as Gitte H√¶nning and Rex Gildo in the 1960s, though not without a wide range within the style (Modern Schlager, Schlager-Gold, ). Schlager is strictly separated from international pop music and is only played on special format radio stations (sometimes mixed with international Oldies). An important part of Schlager is volkst√ºmliche Musik, a Schlager-like interpretation of traditional German folk themes that is very popular in German speaking countries, especially among the older generation. Schlager has a wide variety, and the artists with many different styles for example Heino, Katja Ebstein, Wolfgang Petry, Guildo Horn, Roland Kaiser, Helene Fischer and many others. = Liedermacher = Liedermacher (Songwriter) has sophisticated lyrics and is sung with minimal instrumentation, for instance only with acoustic guitar. Some songs are very political in nature. This is related to American Folk/Americana and French Chanson styles. Famous West German Liedermacher are Reinhard Mey, Klaus Hoffmann, Hannes Wader and Konstantin Wecker. A famous East German Liedermacher was Wolf Biermann. Herman van Veen from the Netherlands was also very popular in Germany. Several Liedermacher artists also record special albums for children. = Rock = The US military radio station American Forces Network (AFN) had a great impact on German postwar culture, starting with AFN Munich in July 1945, which was formative for the further development of German rock and jazz culture. Bill Ramsey, a senior producer at AFN Frankfurt in 1953 who came from Ohio, later became famous as a jazz and Schlager singer in Germany (while remaining almost unknown in the US). Prior to the late 1960s however, rock music in Germany was a negligible part of the schlager genre covered by interpreters such as Peter Kraus and Ted Herold, who played rock 'n' roll standards by Little Richard or Bill Haley, sometimes translated into German. Genuine German rock first appeared around 1968, just as the hippie countercultural explosion was peaking in the US and UK. At the time, the German musical avant-garde had been experimenting with electronic music for more than a decade, and the first German rock bands fused psychedelic rock from abroad with electronic sounds. The next few years saw the formation of a group of bands that came to be known as Krautrock or Kosmische Musik groups; these included Amon D√º√ºl, who later became the world music pioneers Dissidenten, Tangerine Dream, Popol Vuh, Can, Neu! and Faust. = Neue Deutsche Welle = Nena Neue Deutsche Welle (NDW) is an outgrowth of British punk rock and new wave which appeared in the mid-to late 1970s. It was arguably the first successful unique German form of Pop music, but was limited in its stylistic devices (funny lyrics and surreal composition and production). Though it was a huge success in Germany itself in the 1980s, this was not long-lasting mostly due to over-commercialization. Some artists became famous internationally like Nena, Trio, Falco (from Austria) and Joachim Witt. = Popular artists = In the 1980s and 1990s most German-language popular music was sung by male solo artists. Very popular singers are Udo J√ºrgens, Udo Lindenberg, Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer, Marius M√ºller- Westernhagen, Peter Maffay and BAP. Udo J√ºrgens has maintained a large following since the late 60s and still sold out entire soccer stadiums during concerts in 2012. Gr√∂nemeyer also has managed to maintain his success up to today. Maffay developed from Schlager to rock and has a large but delimited fan base‚Äîhe is seldomly played on the radio. BAP, who sing in K√∂lsch, the dialect of their hometown Cologne, enjoy success nationwide. = Hamburger Schule = Hamburger Schule (School of Hamburg) is an underground music- movement that started in the late 1980s and was still active till around the mid-1990s. It has similar traditions as Neue Deutsche Welle and mixed all that with punk, grunge and experimental pop music. Hamburger Schule has been an important part of Germany's youth and gave the term \\"Pop\\" a new definition, as now it was \\"ok\\" (or \\"cool\\") to sing in the German language. Hamburger Schule also includes intellectual lyrics with postmodern theories and social criticism. Important artists are Blumfeld, Die Sterne and Tocotronic.  Popular music from East Germany  = Ostrock = By the early 1970s, experimental West German rock styles had crossed the border into East Germany and influenced the creation of an East German rock movement referred to as Ostrock. On the other side of the Iron Curtain, these bands tended to be stylistically more conservative than in the West, to have more reserved engineering, and often to include more classical and traditional structures (such as those developed by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht in their 1920s Berlin theater songs). These groups often featured poetic lyrics loaded with indirect double-meanings and deeply philosophical challenges to the status quo. As such, they were a style of Krautrock. The best-known of these bands were The Puhdys, Karat, City, Stern-Combo Mei√üen and Silly Only a few individual songs, such as \\"Am Fenster\\" by City and \\"√úber sieben Br√ºcken mu√üt Du geh'n\\" by Karat, found wide popularity outside the GDR. There was also a wide diversity of underground bands. Out of this scene later grew the internationally successful band Rammstein (see Neue Deutsche H√§rte below).  Popular music from reunified Germany  = Modern popular music = Silbermond at the Donauinselfest 2009 In the 1990s, German-language groups had only limited popularity, and only a few artists managed to be played on the radio, for example Nena, Herbert Gr√∂nemeyer, Marius M√ºller-Westernhagen, Die √Ñrzte, Rammstein, Rosenstolz or Die Prinzen. In the mid-2000s the German band Wir sind Helden found success with a new style of German-language pop-rock. This success was followed by several other bands and artists that led to a new boom of German-language music and a broader acceptance of existing German- language recording artists, such as: *Sportfreunde Stiller * Juli * Silbermond * Kraftklub * Klee * MIA. *Polarkreis 18 *2raumwohnung *Revolverheld * Annett Louisan *Tim Bendzko *Andreas Bourani *Mark Forster *Philipp Poisel = Indie and Alternative rock = Popular anglophone alternative rock and crossover bands from Germany that managed to find success domestic and abroad include Beatsteaks, Donots, Blackmail, Reamonn, H-Blockx, Itchy Poopzkid, Guano Apes and Die Happy. The Notwist, an indie rock band, had great critical and commercial success with their album Neon Golden. =Euro Disco= Boney M. *Boney M. *Modern Talking *Bad Boys Blue *Fancy *Silent Circle *Goombay Dance Band *London Boys *Lian Ross *Arabesque *Silver Convention = Synthpop and Eurodance = Modern Talking In the late 1980s (prior to reunification) and the 1990s, Synthpop and Eurodance became popular throughout Germany. Often, different styles were mixed in between these to attract a broad variety of audiences. Successful representatives of these styles were: * Sarah Connor * Culture Beat * Modern Talking * Sandra * Hubert Kah * The Underdog Project * Mousse T. * Milli Vanilli * Groove Coverage * Haddaway * Captain Hollywood Project * E-Rotic * Monrose * No Angels * Mr. President * Fun Factory * Sash! * Peter Schilling * Captain Jack * Lou Bega * Alphaville (band) *R.I.O. *Cascada * Real McCoy * Snap! * Camouflage * A Touch of Class (British based) * Antique (Greek-Swedish based) = Reggae, dancehall, ska = Popular bands and performers include Culcha Candela, Dr. Ring-Ding, Gentleman, Hans S√∂llner, Jan Delay, Mamadee, Milky Chance, Oceana, Patrice, Peter Fox and Seeed. = R&B;, soul, funk = Notable R&B;, Soul and Funk artists include Ay·ªç, Cassandra Steen, Denyo, Miss Platnum, Nadja Benaissa, Nneka, S√∂hne Mannheims and Xavier Naidoo. = Hip hop = Hip hop in Germany arrived in the early 1980s, and graffiti and breakdancing became well-known quickly, even in socialist East Germany. German hip hop \\"started out as a transnational youth subculture.Von Dirke, Sabine. \\"Hip Hop Made in Germany, From Old School to the Kanaksta Movement.\\" German Pop Culture p. 108Brown, Timothy S. \\"'Keeping it Real' in a Different 'Hood: (African-) Americanization and Hip-hop in Germany.\\" In The Vinyl Ain't Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture p. 147 The commercial success started in 1992 with the hit \\"Die Da\\" from Die Fantastischen Vier from Stuttgart. The R√∂delheim Hartreim Projekt tried to establish a \\"gangster\\" rap. An early influential group was Advanced Chemistry including Torch. They sparked an interest in speaking out for the immigrants and used rap as a way to defend themselves.Bennett, Andy. \\"Hip-Hop am Main, Rappin' on the Tyne: Hip-hop Culture as a Local Construct in Two European Cities.\\" In That's the Joint!: The Hip-hop Studies Reader, 177‚Äì200.

New York; London: Routledge, 2004. Fettes Brot from Hamburg, has been successful since their beginning. They sing about funny topics, such as infidelity and boasting about their prowess with women. Whereas hip hop had a peak of success in the early first decade of the 21st century, gangster rap became a controversial part of German music and youth culture just as late as 2004 with Aggro Berlin. Some of Germany's hip hop artists are: Cro, Kool Savas, Sido, Samy Deluxe, Bushido, Marteria, Eko Fresh and Afrob. = Punk = Campino, lead singer of Die Toten Hosen Punk music in Germany has a long and diverse history. When bands like the Sex Pistols and The Clash became popular in West Germany, a number of Punk bands were formed, which led to the creation of a German punk scene. Among the first wave of bands were Male, from D√ºsseldorf, founded in 1976, PVC, from West Berlin, and Big Balls and the Great White Idiot, from Hamburg. Early German punk groups were heavily influenced by UK bands, often writing their lyrics in English. The main difference is that German punk bands hadn't yet become political. Beginning in the late 1970s and early 1980s there were new movements within the German punk scene, led by labels like ZickZack Records, from Hamburg. It was during this period that the term Neue Deutsche Welle (New German Wave) was first coined by Alfred Hilsberg. Many of these bands played experimental post-punk, often using synthesizers and computers. Among them were The Nina Hagen Band, as well as Fehlfarben and Abw√§rts, from Hamburg. Both are still active, though they've changed their style several times. In response to these developments, some bands played a more aggressive style of punk rock, because they didn't consider the experimental bands Punk. There are few German language bands who managed to be successful for a longer period. The best known are the punk bands Die √Ñrzte and Die Toten Hosen. Both were formed in the early 1980s but have very different approaches to punk. As successful as those two bands in number of sales and number one albums but much lesser accepted by the public and normally not played by German media but with a huge fan community were B√∂hse Onkelz. Digital hardcore band Atari Teenage Riot is particularly well known in the United Kingdom and Japan as well as in German autonomist circles. = Heavy metal = The Scorpions were the first German heavy metal band to be highly successful overseas, ultimately selling more than 100 million albums worldwide. Germany has a long and strong history with heavy metal. It is considered by many to be one of Europe's heaviest contributors to the scene. The genre is quite popular and mainstream within the country. Early hard rock/heavy metal was brought to German soil with the success of Scorpions and Accept. Germany is today known for its large metal festivals including Wacken Open Air and Summer Breeze Open Air. Germany has a strong tradition of speed metal and power metal. Early speed metal bands include Running Wild, Grave Digger, Rage, and to some extent Warlock. The European style of power metal, developed in Germany, was popularized by German bands like Blind Guardian, Helloween and Gamma Ray, and gained international recognition. In many cases these bands initially started out playing speed metal, but later switched to power metal. More recently, a new generation of power metal-influenced bands like Masterplan, Orden Ogan, Kissin' Dynamite and Powerwolf is becoming more and more popular in Germany and abroad. Running Wild are also considered a pioneer of the pirate metal genre with the release of their 1987 album Under Jolly Roger, which was one of the first pirate-themed heavy metal albums. Three local variants of metal subgenres exist in Germany. The Teutonic thrash metal scene is represented by such groups as Exumer, Violent Force, Sodom, Kreator, Protector, Tankard and Destruction. Medieval metal, a branch of folk metal, incorporates German traditional music with industrial metal. Notable bands include Subway to Sally, In Extremo, Corvus Corax, Wolgemut and Schandmaul (the last is considered folk rock in Germany). Another variant, Neue Deutsche H√§rte, a form of industrial metal, is detailed below. Bands from the genres of death metal, deathcore, metalcore, doom metal, black metal and a cappella metal are: Absurd, Agathodaimon, Annisokay, Atrocity, Bethlehem, Caliban, Crematory, Dark Fortress, Deadlock, Debauchery, Desaster, Die Apokalyptischen Reiter, Disbelief, Endstille, Eskimo Callboy, Equilibrium, Falkenbach Finsterforst, Fleshcrawl, Golem, Grailknights, Heaven Shall Burn, His Statue Falls, Katharsis, Leaves' Eyes, Moonblood, Morgoth, Nargaroth, Neaera, Necrophagist, Nocte Obducta, Obscura, The Ocean, The Ruins of Beverast, Secrets of the Moon, Suidakra, Van Canto, War From a Harlots Mouth, and We Butter The Bread With Butter. Neue Deutsche H√§rte Rammstein at Madison Square Garden, New York City Neue Deutsche H√§rte (engl. \\"New German Hardness\\") is a term for an extremely popular German variant of Industrial metal. It combines the common sound of metal with elements of gothic and industrial music as well as electronic samples and is mostly sung in German. It is known for morbid and provocative lyrical themes and over-the-top stage shows often featuring fire, pyrotechnic, stunts and other special effects. It draws its audience from both the metal and goth scene. Some bands, especially Rammstein and Oomph!, have gained mainstream success and, despite their lyrics being mostly in German, have also found success in non-German-speaking countries. Other famous artists include Stahlhammer (from Austria), Megaherz, Unheilig, Eisbrecher, Tanzwut, and Joachim Witt. Medieval metal Medieval metal or medieval rock is a subgenre of folk metal that blends hard rock or heavy metal music with medieval folk music. Medieval metal is mostly restricted to Germany where it is known as Mittelalter-Metal or Mittelalter- Rock. The genre emerged from the middle of the 1990s with contributions from Subway to Sally, In Extremo, Schandmaul and Wolgemut. The style is characterised by the prominent use of a wide variety of traditional folk and medieval instruments. = Goth = Germany is the home of a vivid Goth scene, and has a large scene of musicians from the spectrum who are typically known as Goth musicians. Most notable artists are Lacrimosa, Lacrimas Profundere, Xmal Deutschland, Das Ich, Deine Lakaien, Illuminate, Untoten, Erben der Sch√∂pfung (from Liechtenstein), No More, Girls Under Glass or Project Pitchfork. Leipzig is home of the largest event of this subculture worldwide called the Wave-Gotik-Treffen, regularly hosting 25,000 attendants. The WGT is closely followed by the annual M'era Luna festival in Hildesheim. Neue Deutsche Todeskunst (engl. \\"New German Death Art\\") is a German death-obsessed Dark Wave style of music that blends Death rock, German Rock, Gothic Rock, and neo-classical music with German philosophical texts and a theatrical stage show. It is restricted to Germany where it emerged in the early 1990s from bands such as Das Ich, Lacrimosa, Relatives Menschsein and Goethes Erben. Many NDT artists are known for their use of Classical Latin. = Electronic music and techno = Kraftwerk 2004 live in Stockholm Germany has the largest electronic music scene in the world and has a long tradition in and influence on almost all genres of electronic music. The band Kraftwerk was one of the first bands in the world to make music entirely on electronic equipment, and the band Tangerine Dream is often credited as being among the originators and primary influences of the \\"Berlin School\\" of electronic music, which would later influence trance music. Some other bands like Liaisons Dangereuses, Tyske Ludder, Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft and Die Krupps created a style later called Electronic body music. Recently a few electronica artists have become successful in the mainstream, such as Monika Kruse, Marusha, Bl√ºmchen and MIA. Artists on the cutting edge of German-language techno include Klee. Both Einst√ºrzende Neubauten (collapsing new buildings, translated literally) and KMFDM (no pity for the majority, translated literally) are considered by many industrial and electronic music fans as the godfathers of their genre. Their sounds developed the modern styles of groups such as NIN, Marilyn Manson, Rammstein, and New Order. Einst√ºrzende Neubauten can be recognized by their Prince-esque logo, which has been subliminally fused into several mainstream American movies (such as a tattoo in the movie Bug, directed by William Friedkin, starring Harry Connick Jr.). KMFDM has released many songs in English, making them more accessible to their huge American and worldwide audience. In the 1990s, Germany was one of the most successful contributors to the Eurodance genre, with notable German-based acts including Snap!, Kristeen, Culture Beat, La Bouche, Captain Jack, Captain Hollywood Project, Fun Factory and Haddaway. Since 2006 producer and DJ Paul Kalkbrenner gained popularity in Germany. He nowadays is one of the most famous performers of electronic music. Trance music is a style of electronic music that originated in Germany in the very late 1980s and early 1990s, upon German unification. Following the development of trance music in Germany, many Trance genres stemmed from the original trance music and most trance genres developed in Germany, most notably \\"Anthem trance\\" or also called \\"uplifting\\" or \\"epic\\" trance, progressive trance, and \\"Ambient trance\\". One of the most notable event referring to this scene was the Love Parade festival with up to 1.5 million participants from all over the world. Scooter are by far the most successful German dance act, having found huge national and international success. In recent years, German DJs have found worldwide success in the popular edm genre, most notably Paul Kalkbrenner, Cascada, Felix Jaehn and Robin Schulz. Other popular and influential German DJs and dance projects include Paul van Dyk, WestBam, DJ Quicksilver, ATB, Ian Pooley, Jam & Spoon, Lexy & K-Paul, Blank & Jones, Sven V√§th, Dune, ItaloBrothers, Groove Coverage, Novaspace, International Pony and Anthony Rother. = Klezmer in Germany and Eastern Europe = Klezmer is a musical Jewish genre that consists of mainly instrumental songs. In Germany, Klezmer expanded significantly after the fall of the Berlin Wall in the mid-1980s. As Klezmer was expanding, so was the Yiddish folk movement, and the two genres became intertwined to a certain extent. In the 1980s while Klezmer was seeing tremendous growth, many Jews in Eastern Europe turned to Klezmer as a means of understanding their communist backgrounds and showing their remembrance to those who experienced the Holocaust. Once Klezmer groups started to tour outside of Europe in the 1980s, Americans gained immediate interest in the music genre. Henry Sapoznik created the first American Klezmer band, known as Kapelye, which toured all around Europe. The spread of Americans playing Klezmer brought a new tone to the genre which captured large audiences. Most American groups who played Klezmer added a hint of American rock into their performances, which was different than the traditional sound of Klezmer in Eastern Europe. It was uncomfortable at first for many of the American Klezmer bands to play in Germany because of the trauma that had occurred there. Despite Germany's background, the American Klezmer groups knew Germany was a place they had to play because of Klezmer's popularity there. Over time, Klezmer's audience expanded in Germany and the American Klezmer bands were able to adjust. Giora Feidman is arguably one of the most influential Klezmer musicians. Feidman created a new perspective for Klezmer, and shared a new ideology for how the music genre could be viewed and appreciated. Feidman gained a large amount of popularity from his work on the musical play, Ghetto, which associated him and his style with the Holocaust. He brought a new theme to Klezmer music which focused on the remembrance of the Holocaust, and a way of \\"healing\\" the trauma caused by the Holocaust. Feidman turned Klezmer into a form of personal expression, in which he tried to unite all people (especially the Jews and Germans) and all things through Klezmer. He completely shifted the ideology of Klezmer and explained how Klezmer is in everything, it is even a way to get in touch with religion and communicate with God. However, some people believe Feidman took his ideology too far and turned Klezmer into something that it never intended to become. During the 1980s Klezmer underwent significant transformation, and by the middle-late 1990s Klezmer experienced a new wave of change. Klezmer became a name for many different trends far from where it originated. Klezmer was known as a political statement, a method of healing, amateur musicians getting together and playing music, a way to reconnect with lost traditions. = Jazz = = World music = Germany was the starting point of the international career of Cuban-born singer & songwriter Addys Mercedes.

Career Scantlin formed Puddle of Mudd in 1991. They released their debut EP Stuck in 1994, followed by a demo album called Abrasive in 1997. Four years later, the band added three new members and released their debut album Come Clean. In 2003, they released their second album, Life on Display. Their third album, Famous, was released in 2007, followed by Songs in the Key of Love & Hate in 2009 and Welcome to Galvania in 2019. Scantlin sometimes tours with Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell, joining Cantrell in playing acoustic renditions of Alice in Chains songs. He was also one of the musicians who participated in Alice in Chains' reunion tsunami benefit show, and was one of many artists who worked with Carlos Santana on his album All That I Am for the song \\"Just Feel Better\\". The song was recorded twice with both Scantlin and Steven Tyler, but only Tyler's version appears on the album. Personal life Scantlin has a son named Jordan (born 1997) from a previous relationship. He married Jessica Nicole Smith in January 2008. They divorced in May 2012. During an October 2017 show in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, Scantlin apologized to the audience for his on-and-offstage behaviour in previous years and admitted to struggling with addiction. He then announced his sobriety and began playing the song \\"Uh Oh\\", which he had previously written to address his problems. Controversies In March 2002, Scantlin and his then-fianc√©e, actress Michelle Rubin, were both arrested for allegations of domestic violence after witnesses reported seeing the couple fighting on the side of California's Highway 126 while on their way to a video shoot. Several witnesses reported seeing Scantlin forcing Rubin into a Jeep Cherokee driven by an unknown third person. Scantlin and Rubin were released after posting $20,000 bail each. During a February 22, 2004 show in Toledo, Ohio, Scantlin admitted to the audience that he was too intoxicated to continue after only four songs. Frustrated, his bandmates walked off. On September 24, 2007, Scantlin was banned from Graceland after entering an off-limits swimming pool. On December 11, 2011, Scantlin was pursued by the IRS for non-payment of back taxes in the region of $60,000. On April 4, 2012, Scantlin was arrested for cocaine possession, driving under the influence, and driving without a license in Culver City, California. He agreed to attend rehab to erase his potential five-year jail sentence. On September 4, he was arrested for drunken disorderly conduct on a cross-country flight from Boston to Los Angeles. The plane had to make an emergency landing in Austin, Texas, where Scantlin was charged with public intoxication. In May 2013, Scantlin was arrested on domestic violence charges after he allegedly dragged his ex-wife and pulled her by the arm or shirt. In July, he was arrested on charges of felony vandalism after he used a buzzsaw to destroy property on his neighbor's patio. On January 4, 2014, Scantlin was sued by American Express for non-payment of debt. During a show at Trees Dallas on April 16, he threw a microphone and beer into the audience, as well as appearing to threaten and attempt to physically attack members of the audience. He also received criticism as he appeared to be lip-syncing during the performance. On January 16, 2015, Scantlin was arrested at Denver International Airport after taking a joyride on a baggage carousel and entering a restricted area. During a show on April 2, he smashed his guitar, headphones, and part of the drumkit before walking out. On April 15, he was arrested and charged for disorderly conduct at Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport. On July 26, he was arrested in the early morning after leading sheriff deputies on a high-speed chase in excess of 100 mph through Renville County, Minnesota. He faced a felony charge of fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle and two gross misdemeanors of driving under the influence, but the charges were dropped. On August 5, he was arrested for driving under the influence in Sturgis, South Dakota. On January 10, 2016, Scantlin tried to re-enter the house he had lost via foreclosure the previous year, and was arrested for destroying property inside the residence. On April 2, he was arrested at his Los Angeles home. In February, during a concert in Northampton, Pennsylvania, Scantlin berated the sound manager and threatened to call the \\"Kansas City Mafia\\" on him before ending the show early. On August 16, he was caught drinking just before a flight to Louisville, Kentucky. He was removed from the flight and had to cancel a scheduled performance in Louisville. On August 23, Scantlin's neighbors called police after witnessing him rigging a fake bomb onto his vehicles in an attempt to deter thieves from entering them. The mock explosive, consisting of wires attached to the car motor and a gas tank, caused the bomb squad to be called and four surrounding buildings to be evacuated. On September 9, 2017, Scantlin was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport after he tried to board a plane with a BB gun. His bail was set at $850,000.

Despite its low population (129 residents as of the Canada 2016 Census), it is the largest community and only public community on Ellesmere Island. The settlement at Grise Fiord, created by the Canadian Government in 1953 through a forced relocation of Inuit families from Inukjuak, Quebec, is the northernmost public community in Canada. It is also one of the coldest inhabited places in the world, with an average yearly temperature of .

Eight Inuit families from Inukjuak, Quebec (on the Ungava Peninsula), were relocated after being promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife. They were told that they would be returned home after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn, for it would have damaged Canada's claims to sovereignty in the area; the Inuit were forced to stay. Eventually, the Inuit learned the local beluga whale migration routes and were able to survive in the area, hunting over a range of each year.McGrath, Melanie.

Knopf, 2006 (268 pages) Hardcover: Paperback: In 1993, the Canadian government held hearings to investigate the relocation program.

In 2009, Looty Pijamini was commissioned by Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated to build a monument to commemorate the Inuit who sacrificed so much as a result of the Government relocation of 1953 and 1955. Pijamini's monument, located in Grise Fiord, depicts a woman with a young boy and a husky, with the woman sombrely looking out towards Resolute Bay. Amagoalik's monument, located in Resolute, depicts a lone man looking towards Grise Fiord. This was meant to show separated families, and depicting them longing to see each other again.\\"Carvers chosen for Arctic monuments\\" , Northern News Services. Retrieved 1 June 2011.

Grise Fiord was the location for a 1995 BBC documentary entitled Billy Connolly: A Scot in the Arctic, in which the comedian Billy Connolly camped alone for a week on the pack ice near to the settlement, armed with a rifle to protect him from polar bears. Geography Grise Fiord Located at the southern tip of Ellesmere Island, Grise Fiord is one of three permanent settlements on the island. Grise Fiord lies north of the Arctic Circle. Grise Fiord is the northernmost civilian settlement in Canada, but Environment Canada has a permanent weather station at Eureka, and at Alert there is a permanent Canadian Forces Base (CFS Alert) and weather station; both locations are further north on the island. Grise Fiord is cradled by the Arctic Cordillera mountain range. Community and fiord names Just to the north of the community is the actual fiord, Grise Fiord. It means \\"pig inlet\\" in Norwegian. Otto Sverdrup from Norway named it so during an expedition around 1900 because he thought the walrus in the area sounded like pigs. The Inuktitut name is ('), which means \\"place that never thaws\\". Living conditions Artist Looty Pijamini in his shop The population of Grise Fiord is declining, and consists of around 129 permanent residents, a decrease of 0.8% (1 person) from the 2011 census. The houses are wooden and built on platforms to cope with the freezing and thawing of the permafrost. Hunting is still an important part of the lifestyle of the mostly Inuit population. Quota systems allow the villagers to supply many of their needs from populations of seals, walruses, narwhal and beluga whales, polar bears and muskox. Ecotourism is developing as people come to see the northern wildlife found on Ellesmere and surrounding islands. =Transportation= There are no connecting roads on Ellesmere Island, so Grise Fiord is connected to the rest of the world by a small airstrip (Grise Fiord Airport), in length. Surrounded by mountains, it has one of the most difficult approaches for aircraft; it is cautioned that only very experienced pilots of Pilatus PC-12, DHC-6 Twin Otter, and DHC-7 aircraft attempt the approach. For local travel needs, the villagers use all- terrain vehicles in the summer and snowmobiles in the winter. During the winter months travel is limited to the town site and a small patch of land to the east called Nuvuk due to mountains and ice fields that cut the town off from the rest of the island. Small boats are used in summer to reach hunting grounds, or hunting sea mammals on the ocean. Once a year large ships (sealift) arrive with supplies and fuel. =Economy, development, and sustainability= The local co-operative is the main place to purchase supplies. There are local guide and outfitting operations, which are an important source of income for many families. Carving, traditional clothing and other Inuit crafts are also important sources of income. Due to the extreme location, the economy is subsistence-based. Because of the potential for avalanches and falling rocks from mountains, there is no room for expansion. =Communications= RCMP station In 1970, Bell Canada established what was then the world's most northerly telephone exchange (operated since 1992 by Northwestel). It is in the 867 area code (formerly 819 before October 1997) with its only exchange code of 980. The community has been served by the Qiniq network since 2005. Qiniq is a fixed wireless service to homes and businesses, connecting to the outside world via a satellite backbone. The Qiniq network is designed and operated by SSI Micro. In 2017, the network was upgraded to 4G LTE technology, and 2G-GSM for mobile voice. In 2019, Bell Mobility became available to Grise Fiord.CTS 2018: It's not easy to bring wireless to the top of the worldCompetitive cell service coming to all Nunavut communities by 2019 =Crime and safety= A Simon Fraser University study of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) activity in the Baffin Region states that Grise Fiord had the lowest rate of criminal offences of all communities examined in 1992,Curt Taylor Griffiths, Gregory Saville, Darryl S.

The Ecology of Language Paradigm Tsuda is well known as a critic of the hegemony of English and as an advocate of linguistic and cultural pluralism. He believes that the domination of English is tantamount to linguicism and linguicide, and that addressing the problem of linguistic hegemony is crucial to the development of human and cultural security.Yukio Tsuda, \\"Anglomania Muddies Japan's Self-Image,\\" Asahi Evening News, January 23, 1997, p. 8.Yukio Tsuda, \\"Language Problems in Intercultural Communication: Review and Suggestions,\\" Studies in Language and Culture, Vol. 10, No. 1, 1988, pp. 17-30.Yukio Tsuda, \\"Speaking Against the Hegemony of English,\\" in Special Research Project: Civil Society, the State and Culture in Comparative Perspective (Annual Report), Tsukuba, Japan: University of Tsukuba, 2005, pp. 235-244. In an article in The San Matean, a San Mateo Community College newspaper, dated March 19, 2007, Tsuda was quoted to say: \\"It is more important to be students learning other languages than being a teacher only teaching one.\\" He proposed the \\"ecology of language\\" paradigm as opposed to the \\"diffusion of English\\" paradigm. Tsuda urges international and intercultural communication scholars to recognize the hegemony of English as a subject of academic inquiry in the fields especially in the English-speaking countries. He also suggests that English-language teaching professionals incorporate the ecology of language paradigm into the contents and methods of teaching as well as teacher education. Finally, he insists that both native speakers and non-native speakers of English learn the philosophy of the ecology of language so that they will become more sensitive to the ethical aspects of international and intercultural communication.Yukio Tsuda, \\"The Hegemony of English and Strategies for Linguistic Pluralism: Proposing the Ecology of Language Paradigm,\\" in Molefi Kete Asante, Yoshitaka Miike, and Jing Yin (Eds.), The Global Intercultural Communication Reader (2nd Ed.), New York, NY: Routledge, 2014, p. 455.

He was the eldest child of Sun Jian, who was killed during the Battle of Xiangyang when Sun Ce was only 16. Sun Ce then broke away from his father's overlord, Yuan Shu, and headed to the Jiangdong region in southern China to establish his own power base there. With the help of several people, such as Zhang Zhao and Zhou Yu, Sun Ce managed to lay down the foundation of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period. In 200, when the warlord Cao Cao was at war with his rival Yuan Shao in the Battle of Guandu, Sun Ce was rumoured to be planning an attack on Xuchang, Cao Cao's base. However, he was assassinated before he could carry out the plan. Sun Ce was posthumously honoured as \\"Prince Huan of Changsha\\" (Èï∑Ê≤ôÊ°ìÁéã) by his younger brother Sun Quan when the latter became the founding emperor of Eastern Wu. Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi) describes Sun Ce as a handsome man who was full of laughter. He was also a generous and receptive man who employed people according to their abilities. As such, his subjects were willing to risk their lives for him. One detractor named Xu Gong, in a letter to Emperor Xian, compared Sun Ce to Xiang Yu, the warrior-king who overthrew the Qin dynasty. As a result, Sun Ce was also referred to as the \\"Little Conqueror\\" in popular culture. Early life and career Born in 175, Sun Ce was the eldest son of Sun Jian, a military general serving under the Eastern Han dynasty. In 190, a year after Emperor Ling died, the warlord Dong Zhuo usurped power, placing in the throne the puppet Emperor Xian. Regional warlords in eastern China then launched a campaign against Dong Zhuo. Sun Jian rendered his service to Yuan Shu, one of the leaders of the coalition. The attempt to oust Dong Zhuo soon failed and China slid into a series of massive civil wars. In the next year, Sun Jian was sent by Yuan Shu to attack Liu Biao, governor of Jing Province, but he was killed in an ambush. Sun Ce brought his father's body to Qu'e (Êõ≤Èòø; present-day Danyang, Jiangsu) for burial and settled his mother down before heading for Danyang, where his maternal uncle Wu Jing was the governor. There he raised a small militia a few hundred in strength. This small force was far from sufficient for him to establish his own power so in 194 Sun Ce went to Yuan Shu. Yuan Shu was very impressed with Sun Ce and often lamented that he had no son like him. He also returned Sun Jian's former division of troops to Sun Ce. Initially, Yuan Shu promised to appoint Sun Ce the governor of Jiujiang but eventually gave the governorship to Chen Ji (Èô≥Á¥Ä). Later, when Yuan Shu was denied a large loan of grains from the governor of Lujiang, he sent Sun Ce to attack the latter, promising to make Sun Ce the governor of Lujiang should he succeed. When Sun Ce did, however, Yuan Shu again went back on his words and appointed someone else instead. The disappointed Sun Ce then began to contemplate leaving. Meanwhile, Liu Yao, who was by imperial decree the governor of Yang Province, occupied Qu'e as the regional seat Shouchun was already occupied by Yuan Shu. He then forced Wu Jing back west across the Yangtze River to Liyang (Ê≠∑ÈôΩ; present-day He County, Anhui). However, Yuan Shu claimed to be the rightful governor and sent Wu Jing and Sun Ce's cousin Sun Ben to attack Liu Yao. After they were unable to break down Liu Yao's defences for more than a year, Sun Ce requested to lead forces to assist the effort. Conquest of Wu territory Sun Ce's territory around 200 CE The northern part of Yang Province where Sun Ce was active in detail. Several locales of relevance are pinpointed on this map. Map showing the major warlords of the Han dynasty in the 190s, including Sun Ce Though Yuan Shu knew Sun Ce intended to leave, he believed the latter would not be able to defeat Liu Yao. Thus he deployed the young general off with merely a thousand odd troops and a tiny cavalry force. Along with a few hundred more willing followers, Sun Ce proceeded to Liyang, where he boosted his strength to more than 5,000. He then launched an offensive across the Yangtze River and successfully occupied the strategic position of Niuzhu (ÁâõÊ∏ö; southwest of present-day Ma'anshan, Anhui) in 195. Two of Liu Yao's allies then came south from Pengcheng and Xiapi respectively to aid him. Sun Ce chose to first attack one of them, Ze Rong, who made camp south of Moling. After suffering initial defeat in the hands of the aggressor, Ze Rong fell back in defence and refused to engage in battle. Sun Ce then marched further north and attacked Xue Li (ËñõÁ¶Æ) in Moling. Although Xue Li soon gave up the city and escaped, Liu Yao's subordinate Fan Neng (Ê®äËÉΩ) and others had regrouped their forces and launched a renewed attack on Niuzhu. Turning back, Sun Ce defeated Fan Neng and secured Niuzhu. He then began a second offensive against Ze Rong. However, he was struck by a stray arrow in the thigh. Returning to Niuzhu, he sent out false words that he was killed in battle. The exulted Ze Rong then sent a force to attack. Sun Ce led the enemies into an ambush and annihilated them. When Ze Rong heard that Sun Ce was still alive, he further reinforced his defences. Sun Ce then temporarily gave up attacking Ze Rong and focused his forces on Qu'e. After all the surrounding areas were taken over by Sun Ce, Liu Yao gave up the city and escaped south to Nanchang, capital of Yuzhang Commandery, where he died later. Hua Xin, administrator of Yuzhang, joined Sun's forces. As Sun Ce implemented strict discipline among his troops, he won the instant support of the local people and gathered many talented men, such as Chen Wu, Zhou Tai, Jiang Qin, Zhang Zhao, Zhang Hong, Qin Song, and L√º Fan. He then pushed his force deeper into Yang Province and conquered Kuaiji along the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay, whose governor Wang Lang surrendered. Sun Ce made Kuaiji his base city and struck out at the wandering bandit army led by Yan Baihu. Yan Baihu sent his younger brother Yan Yu (Âö¥Ëºø) to offer Sun Ce a position alongside Yan Baihu, but Sun Ce showed no mercy and personally slew the emissary. As Yan Yu was known among Yan Baihu's men as a fierce warrior, his death struck fear into their hearts and they were soon defeated. Sun Ce then appointed his relatives and a trusted subject to govern Danyang and Yuzhang, from which he divided a new commandery named Luling (Âª¨Èôµ). His campaign, from the occupation of Niuzhu to the conquest of the entire region southeast of the Long River, took less than a year. He then defeated and received the services of Zu Lang (Á•ñÈÉé), the Chief of Danyang, and Taishi Ci, the leader of the remnants of Liu Yao's forces; he then urged the surrender of Hua Xin, another one of the remnants of Liu Yao's forces. Thus, with the exception of the scattered but still numerous army of Yan Baihu, the lands south of the Yangtze were mostly pacified. The barbarians of Shanyue tribe, however, were not easily dealt with. To counter the frequent rebellions of the Shanyue (who would continue to rebel for many years), Sun Ce appointed He Qi to a military rank with orders to subdue the Shanyue. He Qi became a highly successful general later; truly, his appointment by Sun Ce was the first important step to Wu's eventual subjugation of the Shanyue. Later life Statues of Sun Ce (right) and Sun Quan (left) In 197, Yuan Shu declared himself emperor ‚Äì an act deemed treasonous against the Han dynasty. In a letter to Yuan Shu, Sun Ce denounced the move and broke ties with the former. In an effort to garner support from Sun Ce, the rising warlord Cao Cao then recommended him to be appointed General Who Attacks Rebels (Ë®éÈÄÜÂ∞áËªç) and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Wu (Âê≥‰æØ).Sun Ce was supposed to inherit his father's peerage \\"Marquis of Wucheng\\" but he gave it to his younger brother, Sun Kuang. In 199 Yuan Shu died of sickness along with his short-lived Zhong Dynasty. His cousin Yuan Yin (Ë¢ÅËÉ§) feared Cao Cao and gave up Shouchun. Bringing along Yuan Shu's coffin and his former troops, he headed to Wan County (ÁöñÁ∏£; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui) to seek refuge under Liu Xun (ÂäâÂã≥). As Liu Xun had insufficient food supplies in his realm to support the additional troops, he led a force south to pillage Haihun (Êµ∑Êòè; east of present-day Yongxiu County, Jiangxi). Sun Ce was en route to attack Huang Zu in Xiakou when he received the news. He then turned back and captured the poorly-defended Wan County, taking over all of Yuan Shu's 30,000 former troops. Hearing that his base city had been taken, Liu Xun headed west and sought help from Huang Zu, who sent a 5,000-strong naval force to assist him. Sun Ce pressed forward and defeated Liu Xun, who escaped north to Cao Cao. Sun Ce annexed more than 2,000 former troops and 1,000 ships of his enemy and came upon Huang Zu. Despite reinforcements from Liu Biao, Huang Zu was utterly defeated. During the battle, Sun Ce slew Liu Biao's officer, Han Xi (ÈüìÂ∏å), and completely routed Huang Zu's son, Huang She (ÈªÉÂ∞Ñ). The victorious Sun Ce in 199 looked poised to take over the entire southern China. As he was threatened by rival Yuan Shao in the north and could not divide his attention, Cao Cao attempted to further reinforce the alliance with Sun Ce by marrying the daughter of his relative Cao Ren to Sun Ce's youngest brother Sun Kuang. Sun Ce in turn agreed to marry Sun Ben's daughter to Cao Cao's son Cao Zhang. The former administrator of Wu Commandery, Xu Gong, had long opposed Sun Ce. Xu Gong wrote to Emperor Xian, recommending the emperor to summon Sun Ce to the capital as he deemed Sun Ce to be a hero comparable to Xiang Yu and too dangerous to be allowed to occupy a territory. However, the letter was intercepted by an official loyal to Sun Ce, who attacked and then had Xu Gong executed. Xu Gong's former servants then kept a low profile and waited for chance to revenge. In the year 200, Cao Cao engaged in the decisive Battle of Guandu with Yuan Shao along the shores of the Yellow River, leaving the capital and his base city Xuchang poorly guarded. Sun Ce is said to have then plotted to attack Xuchang under the banner of rescuing Emperor Xian, who was a figurehead under Cao Cao's control. Preparations were underway for the military excursion when Sun Ce ran into three former servants of Xu Gong during a solo hunting trip. One of them managed to plant an arrow into Sun Ce's cheek before Sun Ce's men arrived and slew the assassins. Many differing accounts of Sun Ce's death exist (see below). One generally accepted scenario is that he died that same night. Another possible scenario has Sun Ce living for quite some time. The physician told Sun Ce to rest still for a hundred days to allow the wound to heal, but Sun Ce looked into the mirror one day and, seeing his scar, became so enraged that he slammed his table. The large movement caused the wound to break and he died in the same night. Although he was survived by one son, Sun Ce passed his legacy to his younger brother, Sun Quan. When Sun Quan declared himself emperor of the state of Eastern Wu in 222, he honoured Sun Ce with the posthumous title \\"Prince Huan of Changsha\\" (Èï∑Ê≤ôÊ°ìÁéã). Sun Ce was succeeded by a posthumous son, Sun Shao (Â≠´Á¥π), as well as at least two (possibly three) daughters, married to Gu Shao and later Zhu Ji (Êú±Á¥Ä), and Lu Xun respectively. Sun Shao bore one son, Sun Feng (Â≠´Â•â), who was executed by Sun Hao for alleged treason due to his popularity.Sanguozhi vol. 46. Dispute over cause of death Sun Sheng (Â≠´Áõõ) in his Exposition on Disparities and Similarities (Áï∞ÂêåË©ï) discounted the theory that Sun Ce made plans to attack Xuchang. He believed that although Sun Ce was a rising power, he was threatened in the west by Huang Zu, who was defeated but not eliminated, in the north by Chen Deng, governor of Guangling Commandery, and in the south by indigenous tribes yet to be assimilated. These prevented Sun Ce from striking far out at Xuchang and moving the emperor to southeastern China. He further argued that Sun Ce died on the fifth day in the fourth month of 200, before the Battle of Guandu even took place. Pei Songzhi, who annotated the Records of the Three Kingdoms, rebutted Sun Sheng, arguing that Huang Zu was newly broken and had yet to recollect his forces while the indigenous tribes were scattered and not much of a threat. Pei Songzhi believed that the first objective of Sun Ce's planned northward excursion was to attack Chen Deng, which would provide a platform for capturing Xuchang. On the other hand, Cao Cao and Yuan Shao had been engaging in skirmishes and small-scale battles before Sun Ce's death. Thus there was in fact no discrepancy in timing. A historically implausible legend regarding Sun Ce's death involves a popular Taoist priest of his time, Gan Ji (Âπ≤Âêâ), whom he regarded as a sorcerer. Despite petitions from his subjects and his own mother, Sun Ce ordered Gan Ji's execution. According to In Search of the Supernatural (ÊêúÁ•ûË®ò) by Gan Bao (Âπ≤Á´á), a compilation largely based on legends and hearsay, Sun Ce began to see apparitions of Gan Ji ever since the execution of the latter. After he was injured by assassins, Sun Ce was told by the physician to rest still to allow the wound to heal. However, he looked into the mirror one day and saw Gan Ji's face, whereupon he let out a cry and slammed the mirror. His wound broke and he died shortly. This version was adopted and further dramatised in the 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, in which Gan Ji's name was taken to be \\"Yu Ji\\" (‰∫éÂêâ).The Chinese characters for \\"Gan\\" (Âπ≤) and \\"Yu\\" (‰∫é) in this case look very similar. It is believed that Luo Guanzhong made an error when referring to historical texts. Family In popular culture =Chinese opera= In Peking opera, Sun Ce's role is usually that of a hero or tragic hero, while his brother, Sun Quan is usually portrayed as a villain at worst or self-seeking at best. Several operas even toy with the idea that Sun Quan had Sun Ce assassinated so that he could take control of the warlord state, though there is no historical evidence to support this view. In the opera Fenghuang Er Qiao, Sun Ce borrows 3,000 troops from Yuan Shu and allies with the Qiao army, which is led by the Two Qiaos. Sun Ce, the protagonist of the opera, eventually gains Da Qiao's hand in marriage through a martial arts contest with the help of Zhou Yu and Xiao Qiao. =Film= In the Shaw Brothers Studio film The Weird Man, Sun Ce has Yu Ji executed and the sorcerer becomes a vengeful ghost. In this film Sun Ce is portrayed as the anti-hero and Yu Ji as the hero due to the controversy between them in the novel. The 1993 Hong Kong film Ninja in Ancient China is also adapted from this story except Yu Ji's apprentices try to avenge him. =Comics and anime= In the anime Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi, Sun Ce fights alongside his father against Dong Zhuo and is befriended by Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei, with whom he trains to become a hero. The protagonist of the manga/anime Ikki Tousen, Sonsaku Hakufu, is loosely based on the historical figure Sun Ce (\\"Sonsaku Hakufu\\" being the Japanese reading of Sun Ce's name and courtesy name). Her guardian, Shuuyu Koukin, bears the same name and personality as Zhou Yu. In the anime K≈çtetsu Sangokushi, Sun Ce is portrayed as a once kind-hearted and virtuous hero who was corrupted by the power of the Imperial Seal, causing him to kill its protector. In the Chinese manhua The Ravages of Time, Sun Ce is a cunning, ruthless and manipulative character. =Video games= Sun Ce is featured as a playable character in Koei's Dynasty Warriors video game series, as well as Warriors Orochi, a crossover between Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors. Sun Ce is also a legendary character in Creative Assembly's Total War: Three Kingdoms, the newest part of the Total War video games series which was released on May 23, 2019. Sun Ce is also a playable character in the fighting game Sango Fighter 2. =Card games= In the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering there is a card named \\"Sun Ce, Young Conqueror\\", in the Portal Three Kingdoms set.

Educated in Canada, he has worked in his native United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. His most famous role is likely that of vampire-turned-police detective Nick Knight in the Canadian television series Forever Knight. Early life and training Geraint Wyn Davies was born on 20 April 1957 in Swansea, Wales, the son of a Congregationalist Christian preacher. At the age of 7 he moved with his family from Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire to Canada, where he attended Upper Canada College. He first acted at age 12, appearing in a school production of Lord of the Flies. He went on to study at the University of Western Ontario, where he studied economics before dropping out to pursue an acting career. His professional stage debut was in 1976 in Quebec City, when at 19 he appeared in The Fantasticks, Red Emma and A Midsummer Night's Dream. Stage career Davies moved from Quebec to London's Centre Stage theatre company, and later played the lead in The Last Englishman with the British Actors Theatre Company. He spent two seasons with Theatr Clwyd, touring Britain in Enemy of the People and Hamlet (for which he received the Regional Theatre Best Actor award), and a season with the Chichester Festival, in Henry VIII. In Canada he appeared over several seasons with the Shaw Festival and Stratford Festival of Canada. He gained a reputation for his performances in The Music Cure, Candida, Cyrano de Bergereac, The Vortex, Goodnight Disgrace, Henry V and The Three Musketeers. He sang his way through the Rodgers and Hart musical The Boys from Syracuse. Other performances include My Fat Friend in Los Angeles and Sleuth with Patrick Macnee in Toronto. In 2004 he appeared in Washington, D.C. in the title roles of Cyrano de Bergerac .\\"From 'Lear' To 'Cyrano', Just Following His Nose\\", washingtonpost.com; accessed 2 December 2015. In April 1996, Davies appeared as Petruchio in Shakespeare's The Taming of The Shrew, directed by Patrick Tucker of the Original Shakespeare Company. This three-performance run was presented as Shakespeare's own players may have done - with sparse rehearsal, eclectic costuming and rotating roles. In Spring 1998 he appeared in the Moises Kaufmann production Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Gross Indecency earned the Garland Award for \\"Best Ensemble Cast from Backstage West\\" that year. In August 1999 Davies starred in Leon Pownall's one-man show An Evening with Dylan Thomas at the Atlantic Theatre Festival in Nova Scotia, Canada. The following summer he returned to the Atlantic Theatre Festival in Pownall's Dylan Thomas and Shakespeare: In the Envy of Some Greatness. August 2001 saw the completion of Pownall's Dylan Thomas trilogy with Stranger in Paradise. In mid-2002, he returned to the Stratford Festival Theatre's main stage in My Fair Lady, as Henry Higgins, a role he alternated with Colm Feore. He reprised the role of Dylan Thomas at the Festival's Studio Theatre, and returned to the Atlantic Theatre Festival in August 2003 to perform Hughie (a one-act play by Eugene O'Neill). The evening was topped off by a presentation of The Sermon by David Mamet. 2004 saw Davies appear at the Lincoln in New York as Edmund to Christopher Plummer's King Lear. In the summer of 2004 he starred in the title role of Cyrano in Barry Kornhauser's adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac at The Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C., for which he won the Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Resident Play. The next year, in 2005, he was Dylan Thomas for seven weeks in Do Not Go Gentle at the Arclight Theatre in New York City. While there he did a reading of Tennessee Williams's letters at the New York Public Library, and performed in a reading of Eugene O'Neill's Days Without End. In September 2005, he joined in a reading of R. L. Stevenson's Treasure Island in Washington, D.C., and in October took part in a staged reading of a new play by Austin Pendleton entitled H6R3, which blends Shakespeare's plays Henry VI and Richard III. In 2006, he returned to The Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C. to perform Don Armado in Michael Kahn's 1960s version of Shakespeare's Love's Labor's Lost. Following the American run the play moved to the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford- Upon-Avon in the UK for a limited run. He was nominated but did not win The Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor, Resident Play for Don Armado. While in D.C. he participated in a reading of London Assurance by Dion Boucicault. Early in 2007 he headlined as Richard III by Shakespeare at The Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C. He, along with friend Brent Carver, opened Toronto's CanStage production of The Elephant Man in mid-October.

The character of Zev was portrayed by three actresses during the series' run and the character of Zev has had three incarnations. Zev's character was originally played by Lisa Hynes, after which she was portrayed by Eva Habermann and Xenia Seeberg. Habermann portrayed Zev for the first six episodes of the series, after which the character was renamed Xev and portrayed by Seeberg. Background The character was born on the planet B3K, where she was sold by her parents to the Wife Bank. During her initial years Zev was raised by computers that taught her to become a perfect wife. As a result, the character became overweight and was rejected by her bridegroom. Zev was then sentenced to become a love slave by being run through a device called the Lusticon, intended to transform her into a beautiful and brainless servant. Before the process could be successfully completed, a carnivorous reptile called a cluster lizard attempted to eat her but was fused to her DNA in the process. This enabled Zev to free herself. She then substituted the detached robot head of a 790 robot in the machine to be subjected to brainwashing. This prompted the robot to fall in love with her. Zev's character died early in the second season in the episode \\"Terminal\\", but was re-animated in the next episode by the character Lyekka as a present for Stanley Tweedle. The character was renamed Xev (the pronunciation remaining the same) and was thereafter portrayed by a different actress, Xenia Seeberg. During the series' run the character has had feelings for Kai, which remained unrequited throughout the series. Seeberg has described the character as being one of the more moral characters of the show, but that her aspect as a potential love slave still factored heavily into the character's motivations. Cluster lizard As Zev and Xev, the character has the ability to transform into a cluster lizard and shares many similarities with the fictional creature. Cluster Lizards are portrayed as being very vicious reptilian creatures resembling centipedes that can curl up into a wheel-like shape and travel at considerable speeds. Otherwise they resemble by appearance a small Sandworm. They reproduce in mating cycles every seven years and are used as a form of capital punishment by His Divine Shadow.

During his life, he held various military and political offices, including Postmaster General, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Secretary of State for the Northern Department. He is also known for the claim that he was the eponymous inventor of the sandwich. Biography =Early years= John Montagu was born in 1718, the son of Edward Montagu, Viscount Hinchingbrooke. His father died when John was four, leaving him as his heir. His mother soon remarried and he had little further contact with her.Rodger p.1-2 He succeeded his grandfather as Earl of Sandwich in 1729, at the age of ten. He was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge, and spent some time travelling, initially going on the Grand Tour around Continental Europe before visiting the more unusual destinations of Greece, Turkey, and Egypt which were then part of the Ottoman Empire.Rodger p.4-5 This led him later to found a number of Orientalist societies.Rodger p.7-8 On his return to England in 1739, he took his seat in the House of Lords as a follower of the Duke of Bedford, one of the wealthiest and most powerful politicians of the era. He became a Patriot Whig and one of the sharpest critics of the Walpole government, attacking the government's strategy in the War of the Austrian Succession. Like many Patriot Whigs, Lord Sandwich was opposed to Britain's support of Hanover and strongly opposed the deployment of British troops on the European Continent to protect it, instead arguing that Britain should make greater use of its naval power.Rodger p.13-18 He gained attention for his speeches in parliament. His oratory earned him a reputation for clearly setting out his argument even if he lacked natural eloquence.Rodger p.19 =Political career= In 1744, the Duke of Bedford was invited to join the government, now headed by Henry Pelham, taking the post of First Lord of the Admiralty. Sandwich joined him as one of the commissioners of the Admiralty, in effect serving as deputy under Bedford. The experienced Admiral Lord Anson also joined the Admiralty board and was an influential figure. Bedford spent much of his time at his country estate, and much of the day-to-day running of the Admiralty fell to Sandwich and Anson.Rodger p.20-39 Anson had control of the training and discipline of the navy, while Sandwich focused on the administration. Following a proposal by Admiral Edward Vernon, the concept of a Western Squadron was pioneered, which proved very successful.Rodger p.35-37 This marked a radical shift in British naval strategy, and led to British success at the Battles of Cape Finisterre. The following year, Sandwich took a commission as a colonel in the British Army as part of the response to the Jacobite rising and the prospect of a French invasion. In order to boost the relatively small British army, a number of units were raised by prominent figures, and Sandwich served in the regiment formed by Bedford. While serving in The Midlands, he fell seriously ill with fever and nearly died.Rodger p.38-39 After his recovery, he returned to his duties at the admiralty. He remained an army officer for the rest of his life, remaining on the half-pay list and eventually rising to the rank of general, even though he took no further active part in the army. =Congress of Breda= In 1746 he was sent as a plenipotentiary to the Congress of Breda, and he continued to take part in the negotiations for peace until the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was concluded in 1748. Sandwich was also made ambassador to the Dutch Republic during the talks. Using the resources of the British secret service, Sandwich was able to outmanoeuvre his French counterpart by intercepting the latter's secret correspondence.Baker-Smith p.144 His service at Breda drew him to the attention of the influential Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, who lobbied for him to be given high office when he returned home. It is possible that during his time at Breda, he played a role in the 1747 Dutch Revolution which brought William IV, Prince of Orange wider powers, something supported by Britain as they hoped the Prince would improve the Dutch Republic's military performance in the ongoing war in the Low Countries. However, there is no firm evidence of this. =First Lord of the Admiralty (first and second spells)= In February 1748 he became First Lord of the Admiralty, retaining this post until June 1751. By 1751 Newcastle, who had previously admired Sandwich for his forthright and hardline views, had increasingly begun to distrust him and his relationship with The Duke of Bedford whom Newcastle regarded as a rival. Newcastle engineered the dismissal of both of them, by sacking Sandwich. Bedford resigned in protest, as Newcastle had calculated, allowing him to replace them with men he considered more loyal personally to him. The Duke of Bedford was a long-standing patron of Sandwich, and his support helped him further his career. Portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds. For the next few years Sandwich spent time at his country estate, largely avoiding politics, though he kept in close contact with both Bedford and Anson and Britain's participation in the Seven Years' War. Partly thanks to naval reforms pioneered by Anson and Sandwich the Royal Navy enjoyed a series of successes and was able to blockade much of the French fleet in port. In 1763 he returned to the Admiralty in the government of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, and encouraged a major rebuilding programme for the Royal Navy. Bute was a Tory who wished to bring the war to an end, which he did with the Treaty of Paris. It was during this time that Sandwich first met Martha Ray who became his long-standing mistress. He was soon dismissed from the office, but was offered the influential position of Ambassador to Madrid. =Northern Secretary= In August 1763 Sandwich became Secretary of State for the Northern Department, in the government of George Grenville who had replaced Bute. While filling this office he took a leading part in the successful prosecution of the radical M.P. John Wilkes for obscene libel. Although he had been allegedly associated with Wilkes in the notorious Hellfire Club (also known as the Monks of Medmenham), recent scholarship has suggested that the two had a more distant but cordial relationship than the friendship which was popularly portrayed at the time.Rodger p.99-100 John Gay's The Beggar's Opera was played in Covent Garden shortly thereafter, and the similarity of Sandwich's conduct to that of Jemmy Twitcher, betrayer of Macheath in that play, permanently attached to him that appellation. Wilkes was eventually expelled from the House of Commons. He held the post of Northern Secretary until July 1765. His departure from the post coincided with the end of George Grenville's term as prime minister. He hoped to return to office swiftly, provided a united opposition could be formed.Rodger p.111 In The State Tinkers (1780), James Gillray caricatured Sandwich (on left) and his political allies in the North government as incompetent tinkers. Sandwich was postmaster general from 1768 to 1771 and briefly secretary of state again from December 1770 to January 1771. =First Lord of the Admiralty (third spell)= Sandwich served again as First Lord of the Admiralty in Lord North's administration from 1771 to 1782. He replaced the distinguished Admiral Sir Edward Hawke in the post.Whiteley p.85 His appointment to the post followed the Falklands Crisis which had nearly seen Britain go to war with Spain over the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean after the Capture of Port Egmont by Spanish forces. War had only been averted when Louis XVI of France refused to back the Spanish over the dispute.Black p.152 Both France and Spain resented what they considered British hegemony following the Seven Years' War, and desired to overturn the imbalance of power; war was widely expected to break out between the nations in the near future. In 1774, only three years into his third term, Sandwich commissioned a series of ship models and a model of Chatham Dockyard as a gift to George III in an attempt to interest his king in naval matters. However, Sandwich's overall administration of the navy in the lead up to and during the American War of Independence was traditionally portrayed as being incompetent, with insufficient ships being ready for the outbreak of war with France in 1778. In 1775, Sandwich spoke vociferously in opposition to a plan for British America put forth by Benjamin Franklin and the Earl of Chatham. When Britain and France went to war, Sandwich advocated a strategy of concentrating the British fleet in European waters to deter invasionSyrett p.18-22 in opposition to his colleague, Lord Germain, who pushed for more ships to be sent to North America. The cabinet largely followed Sandwich's policy, retaining footholds on the American coast which could be used as naval bases, while retaining the bulk of the fleet at home. Sandwich's problems increased when Spain entered the war on France's side in 1779 giving the Bourbon fleets a numerical advantage over the Royal Navy. Prior to 1778 Keppel failed to persuade Sandwich to ignore technical difficulties and \\"copper sheath only a few ships\\"; he was later possibly unfairly to make political capital out of this in The London Magazine, March 1781. He had remarked that coppering \\"gave additional strength to the navy\\" and he reproached Lord Sandwich with having \\"refused to sheath only a few ships with copper\\" at his request, when he had since ordered the whole navy to be sheathed. The lack of coppering the navy was one of the key reasons leading to Britain losing the Thirteen Colonies. In 1778 the new Navy Board Controller Charles Middleton, who had the major problem at the time with supplying over 100 ships for the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783), compounded that year by French opportunism in declaring war on Britain to support the American rebels, effectively turned what was a local civil war into a global conflict. Others followed: Spain in 1779 and the Netherlands in 1780. Middleton took the view that Britain was \\"outnumbered at every station\\", and the navy was required to \\"extricate us from present danger\\". He understood that coppering allowed the navy to stay at sea for much longer without the need for cleaning and repairs to the underwater hull, making it a very attractive, if expensive, proposition. On 21 January 1779 he wrote to the Admiralty, and petitioned King George directly. The King backed him for what was an expensive process for an untested technology, and in May 1779 he placed orders at the Portsmouth Docks for coppering a total 51 ships within a year. During 1779 a combined Franco- Spanish fleet was able to sail into the English Channel to threaten the coast of Cornwall in the initial stage of a Franco-Spanish invasion of Britain. Sandwich was criticised for the failure of the smaller British Channel Fleet to prevent this, although the invasion never materialised. After 1778, the primary objective in the war was maintaining control over the sugar-rich West Indian archipelago The lucrative sugar trade in the Caribbean was reckoned at the time as being of more importance to British interests than the 13 colonies. The sugar trade was paying for the costs of the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783) and the Anglo-French War (1778‚Äì1783). The Royal Navy's newly coppered ships as yet untested were used successfully by Rodney in defeating the French at the Battle of the Saintes off Dominica in February 1782. By the time Sandwich's administration ended, he would take full credit for coppering the fleet as one of his great achievements when defending his record in office in January 1782. =Personal life= Dorothy, wife of 4th Earl of Sandwich, or his sister Elizabeth Courtenay, by Francis Cotes, RA, 1758. For several years Sandwich had as a mistress Fanny Murray, the subject of Wilkes' An Essay on Woman (1763), but he eventually married Dorothy Fane, daughter of the 1st Viscount Fane, by whom he had a son, John, Viscount Hinchingbrooke (1743 ‚Äì 1814), who later succeeded as 5th Earl. Sandwich's first personal tragedy was his wife's deteriorating health and eventual insanity. During his wife's decline, Sandwich started an affair with the talented opera singer Martha Ray. During their relationship, Ray bore him at least five and perhaps as many as nine children, including Basil Montagu (1770 ‚Äì 1851), writer, jurist and philanthropist.'Covent Garden : Part 2 of 3', Old and New London: Volume 3 (1878), pp. 255-269. \\"Miss Ray had borne to Lord Sandwich no less than nine children, five of whom were then living. One of these afterwards attained distinction, Mr. Basil Montague, Q.C., eminent both as a lawyer and as a man of letters, who died in 1851.\\" According to several sources, Sandwich was unable to provide adequately and permanently for his mistress and their children; she therefore encouraged the suit of Captain James Hackman, who later exchanged the army for the clergy. Date accessed: 14 October 2008 Tragedy was to strike again in April 1779 when Ray was murdered in the foyer of the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden by a jealous suitor, James Hackman, Rector of Wiveton. Sandwich never recovered from his grief. The events surrounding Ray's murder were depicted in a popular novel Love and Madness (1780) by Herbert Croft. A mezzotint print of the Earl engraved by Valentine Green, after Johann Zoffany, published 30 August 1774 In a famous exchange with the actor Samuel Foote, Sandwich declared, \\"Foote, I have often wondered what catastrophe would bring you to your end; but I think, that you must either die of the pox, or the halter.\\" \\"My lord\\", replied Foote instantaneously, \\"that will depend upon one of two contingencies; ‚Äì whether I embrace your lordship's mistress, or your lordship's principles.\\" This retort is often misattributed to John Wilkes. Sandwich retired from public duty in 1782, and lived another ten years in retirement at what was then the family seat, Hinchingbrooke House, Huntingdonshire,Hinchingbrooke House. dying on 30 April 1792. His title of Earl of Sandwich passed to his eldest son, John Montagu, 5th Earl of Sandwich, who was 48 at the time. Sandwich was buried in All Saints' Church in Barnwell, Northamptonshire, of which only the chancel survives, kept to preserve the Montagu tombs. Legacy Sandwich retired in 1782. Despite holding a number of important posts during his career, Sandwich's incompetence and corruption were legendary, inspiring the saying: \\"Seldom has any man held so many offices and accomplished so little.\\" Recently, some historians have begun to suggest that Lord Sandwich was not perhaps as incompetent as suggested, but that previous historians have placed too much emphasis on sources from his political enemies. =The sandwich= The modern sandwich is named after Lord Sandwich, but the exact circumstances of its invention and original use are still the subject of debate. A rumour in a contemporaneous travel book called Tour to London by Pierre-Jean Grosley formed the popular myth that bread and meat sustained Lord Sandwich at the gambling table. But Sandwich was into many bad habits, including the Hellfire Club, and any story may be a creation after the fact.Hexmaster's Factoids: Sandwich Lord Sandwich was a very conversant gambler, the story goes, and he did not take the time to have a meal during his long hours playing at the card table. Consequently, he would ask his servants to bring him slices of meat between two slices of bread, a habit well-known among his gambling friends. Other people, according to this account, began to order \\"the same as Sandwich!\\", and thus the \\"sandwich\\" was born.Sandwiches, History of Sandwiches The sober alternative to this account is provided by Sandwich's biographer N. A. M. Rodger, who suggests that Sandwich's commitments to the navy, to politics, and to the arts mean that the first sandwich was more likely to have been consumed at his work desk. =Islands named after Sandwich by Capt James Cook= Lord Sandwich was a great supporter of Captain James Cook. As First Lord of the Admiralty, Sandwich approved Admiralty funds for the purchase and fit-out of the Resolution, Adventure and Discovery for Cook's second and third expeditions of exploration in the Pacific Ocean. He also arranged an audience with the King, which was an unusual privilege for a lower ranking officer.Quanchi, Historical Dictionary of the Discovery and Exploration of the Pacific Islands, page 221 In honour of Sandwich, Cook named the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) after him, as well as Montague Island off the south east coast of Australia, the South Sandwich Islands in the Southern Atlantic Ocean and Montague Island in the Gulf of Alaska.etymonline.com Hinchinbrook Island was named for the House owned by the Montagu family. Lord Sandwich donated the various items given him by Cook to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge.Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology: Captain James Cook He also met the young Ra'iatean Omai, whom Cook had brought to Europe, and took him to his country estate for a week, presenting him with a suit of armour. Cricket Like his friends John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford and George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, Sandwich was keen on cricket. The earliest surviving record of his involvement in the sport comes from 1741 when, as the patron and captain of the Huntingdonshire county team, Sandwich and Halifax formed the Northamptonshire & Huntingdonshire team which twice defeated Bedfordshire, first at Woburn Park and then at Cow Meadow, Northampton.Maun, pp. 106‚Äì107.Waghorn, Cricket Scores, p. 27. Music After his naval career, Sandwich turned his energy toward music. He became a great proponent of \\"ancient music\\" (defined by him as music more than two decades old). He was the patron of the Italian violinist Felice Giardini, and created a \\"Catch Club\\", where professional singers would sing \\"ancient\\" and modern catches, glees, and madrigals. He also put on performances of George Frideric Handel's oratorios, masques, and odes at his estate. Sandwich was instrumental in putting together the Concert of Ancient Music, the first public concert to showcase a canonic repertory of old works.

It is a serious concern to apple and pear producers. Under optimal conditions, it can destroy an entire orchard in a single growing season. The causal pathogen is Erwinia amylovora,Type strain NCPPB 683 (dead link 3 December 2019) a Gram-negative bacterium in the order Enterobacterales. Pears are the most susceptible, but apples, loquat, crabapples, quinces, hawthorn, cotoneaster, Pyracantha, raspberry and some other rosaceous plants are also vulnerable. The disease is believed to be indigenous to North America, from where it spread to most of the rest of the world. Fire blight is not believed to be present in Australia though it might possibly exist there. It has been a major reason for a long- standing embargo on the importation of New Zealand apples to Australia. Japan was likewise believed to be without the disease, but it was discovered in pears grown in northern Japan. Japanese authorities are, however, still denying its existence, and the Japanese scientist who discovered it is believed to have committed suicide after his name was leaked to affected farmers. In Europe it is listed as a quarantine disease, and has been spreading along Hawthorn (Crataegus) hedges planted alongside railways, motorways and main roads. History In the early 1800s, E. amylovara was the first bacterium that could be used in experiments to demonstrate that it did indeed cause disease in plants. It is accepted that this destructive crop bacterium had initially originated in North America. Today, E. amylovara can currently be found in all the provinces of Canada, as well as in some parts of the United States of America; states include Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Other American countries of its occurrence include but are not limited to Mexico and Bermuda. On the African continent, E. amylovora has been confirmed in Egypt. It is believed that the pathogen was first introduced into Northern Europe through bacterial ooze from fruit containers in the 1950s, imported from Northern America. During the 1950s-1960's, E. amylovora had spread through much of Northern Europe, yet leaving large areas of Germany and France seemingly untouched by the disease of which the bacteria cause a devastating disease known as \\"fireblight\\". This was short lived, as E. amylovora made its presence known when it was discovered in the later 1990s in Germany. Nonetheless by the 1980s the E. amylovora bacteria had been found in the Eastern Mediterranean, although its appearance in this region is thought to be an isolated appearance and not as a result of local transmission. Finally from the years 1995-1996 cases of fireblight had begun to be reported in countries such as Hungary, Romania, Northern Italy and Northern Spain. Symptoms Fire blight on a pear tree caused by Erwinia amylovora Tissues affected by the symptoms of Erwinia amylovora include blossoms, fruits, shoots, and branches of apple (Pomoideae), pear, and many other rosaceous plants. All symptoms are above ground and are typically easy to recognize. Symptoms on blossoms include water soaking of the floral receptacle, ovary, and peduncles. This results in a dull, gray-green appearance at 1‚Äì2 weeks after petal fall, and eventually tissues will shrivel and turn black. The base of the blossom and young fruit show similar symptoms as infection spreads. Opaque white- or amber-colored droplets of bacterial ooze can be seen on the infected tissue when the environment is high in humidity. Shoots show similar symptoms but develop much more rapidly. A ‚ÄúShepherd's Crook‚Äù can be seen when the tip of the shoot wilts, and diseased shoot leaves typically have blackening along the mid-vein and then die. In number, diseased shoots give the tree a blighted appearance. Initial infection of blossoms and shoots can spread to larger tree limbs. Branches will darken and become water soaked. Advanced infection develops cracks in bark and a sunken surface. Wood under the bark will become streaked with black discoloration. Immature fruit forms water-soaked lesions and later turned black. Bacterial ooze can be found on these lesions. Severe infections result in fruit turning entirely black and shriveling.Johnson, Kenneth B. \\"Fire Blight of Apple and Pear.\\" The American Phytopathological Society. The Plant Health Instructor, 2000. Web. 15 Nov. 2016. A primary inoculum of this disease is typically from cankers formed the season before. The factors that determine whether or not cankers become active are not well known, but it is thought that cankers found on larger tree limbs are more likely to become active. It is also thought that age may be a factor.Beer, Steven V., and Norelli, John L. \\"Fire Blight Epidemiology: Factors Affecting Release of Erwinia Amylovora by Cankers.\\" Phytopathology 77.9 (1977): 1119-125. Web. 15 Nov. 2016. Dissemination Gala apple branch with ‚Äúscorched‚Äù leaves after a severe fire blight infection. Honeybees and other insects, birds, rain and wind can transmit the bacterium to susceptible tissue. Injured tissue is also highly susceptible to infection, including punctures and tears caused by plant- sucking or biting insects. Hailstorms can infect an entire orchard in a few minutes, and growers do not wait until symptoms appear, normally beginning control measures within a few hours. Once deposited, the bacterium enters the plant through open stomata and causes blackened, necrotic lesions, which may also produce a viscous exudate. This bacteria-laden exudate can be distributed to other parts of the same plant or to susceptible areas of different plants by rain, birds or insects, causing secondary infections. The disease spreads most quickly during hot, wet weather and is dormant in the winter when temperatures drop. Infected plant tissue contains viable bacteria, however, and will resume production of exudate upon the return of warm weather in the following spring. This exudate is then the source for new rounds of primary infections. The pathogen spreads through the tree from the point of infection via the plant's vascular system, eventually reaching the roots and/or graft junction of the plant. Once the plant's roots are affected, the death of the plant often results. Over pruning and over fertilization (especially with nitrogen) can lead to watersprout and other midsummer growth that leave the tree more susceptible. Erwinia amylovora typically makes its entry into its host xylem or cortical parenchyma. It can also enter through stomata, lenticles and hydathodes. It is dispersed by rain and or insects naturally, but this mode of dispersal is very ineffective and can only be effective for local transmission of the pathogen. Aerosols are also suspected in playing a role in its transmission due to the detection of E. amylovora in Mediterranean regions. In composition the pathogen is composed of short rods with rounded ends made motile by many peritrichous flagellae. E. amylovara is a gram negative bacterium (as stated above). Fire blight microorganisms are spread through different effectively means also, for example, downpour or water sprinkling, bugs, and winged animals, other tainted plants, and unclean cultivating instruments. The most extreme danger of presentation to this bacterium is pre-summer or late-spring as it rises up out of dormancy. Shockingly, there is no solution for fire blight; in this way, the best fire blight cures are standard pruning and expulsion of any tainted stems or branches. It might likewise assist with staying away from the overhead water system, as water sprinkling is one of the most well-known approaches to spread the disease. There should be cautious attention towards the digging tools, particularly those that have been presented to the microscopic organisms. The tools should be sterilized to be disinfected in an alcohol arrangement containing three sections denatured alcohol to one section water. Ethanol and denatured alcohol are altogether different. While ethanol liquor isn't noxious and very protected to utilize, denatured alcohol is a poisonous dissolvable customarily utilized as Shellac thinner. The diluted household bleach (one part bleach to nine parts water) can likewise be utilized. Continuously make a point to altogether dry the tools to forestall consumption. It can also help with assisting to oil them down also.https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/plant- problems/disease/fire-blight-remedies-and-symptoms.htm Management Spraying plants with streptomycin or injecting plants with oxytetracycline can prevent new infections. The widespread use of streptomycin spray has led to antibiotic resistance in some areas, such as California and Washington. Certain biological controls consisting of beneficial bacteria or yeast can also prevent fire blight from infecting new trees. The only effective treatment for plants already infected is to prune off the affected branches and remove them from the area. Plants or trees should be inspected routinely for the appearance of new infections. The rest of the plant can be saved if the blighted wood is removed before the infection spreads to the roots. There is no known cure; prevention is the key. E. amylovora needs to be destroyed externally, before it enters the cell. This is simply because once it enters the host, it spreads during the endophytic phase of pathogenesis. Once this happens external control methods become ineffective. The ideal control method is to apply copper and antibiotics to the plant externally. This is the only effective method and it is indeed preventative. Currently it has been noted that E. amylovora has developed a resistance to the antibiotic streptomycin, as do most bacteria due to their flexible ability to transfer preferential genes promoting resistance to certain antibiotics horizontally from species not even similar to it as all bacteria can. Phytosanitary measures have been employed as the best sanitary measures against E. amylovora dispersal. High risk countries are encouraged not to import plants susceptible to the pathogen into their territory because, once the bacteria become established in an area it is nearly impossible to eradicate the disease. Nurseries and orchards in such regions are placed on strict phytosanitary surveillance measures and well-monitored. Imported and infected crops are destroyed as soon as they are noticed since the bacteria spreads very rapidly and eradication methods are usually costly and inefficient. Current fire blight strategies depend upon phytosanitary measures to lessen inoculum in the plantation and the utilization of splash medicines to forestall contamination, particularly blossom infections. Decreasing essential inoculum in the plantation by removing remainder holdover cankers during winter pruning is a set up as a basic method of control fire blight disease. In seriously influenced plantations, social practices that moderate the development pace of the tree will likewise slow the pace of canker improvement. This incorporates retaining irrigation water, nitrogen fertilizer, and agriculture. Also, practices that decrease tree injuring and bacterial development can diminish auxiliary disease. This incorporates controlling bugs, for example, plant bugs and psylla, constraining utilization of appendage spreaders in youthful plantations, and avoiding use of overhead sprinklers.https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/disandpath/prokaryote/pdlessons/Pages/FireBlight.aspx Importance Besides the historical importance of being the first bacterium proven to be a plant pathogen, it is extremely economically important. Control and loss costs are estimated approximately $100 million a year in the USA. Specifically, in Michigan in the year 2000, $42 million in losses is estimated because of the removal of about 400,000 apple trees.Aƒáimoviƒá SG, Zeng Q, McGhee GC, Sundin GW and Wise JC (2015) Control of fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) on apple trees with trunk-injected plant resistance inducers and antibiotics and assessment of induction of pathogenesis-related protein genes. Front. Plant Sci. 6:16. Web. 15 Nov. 2016. Warm, humid, and wet weather in May resulted in this epidemic. While approximately $68 million is estimated in losses in Washington and northern Oregon. E. amylovora is spread all through the USA and worldwide causing severe damage although it is unlikely to cause severe damage in northern Europe. As long as E. amylovora is not introduced to Central Asia where wild apple trees still grow, it will not modify any ecosystems. Biodiversity is not impacted either, as no plant species are threatened with extinction due to this pathogen. Growing pears in Emilia- Romagna in Italy is a traditional activity for some families, and fire blight threatens this tradition that has been passed down for several generations.\\"Erwinia Amylovora (fireblight).\\" The Centre for Agriculture and Bioscience International. N.p., n.d. Web. 15 Nov. 2016. In southern Germany apple and pear trees have been a part of the landscape for a long time, and are difficult to protect. The decline of apple and pear trees from their landscape can be expensive to replace and could have a negative effect on tourism. In the long-run, fire blight is a very important factor of economy and society. A predetermined number of apple cultivars are answerable for an enormous extent of yearly creation. Shoppers and general stores prize these cultivars for their appearance, quality, flavor, and storability, while cultivators additionally esteem their plantation attributes and prepared market coming about because of purchaser request. To hold the desirable qualities of a fruiting cultivar while presenting malady opposition qualities through ordinary reproducing techniques is for all intents and purposes unimaginable due to apple's heterozygosity, long age time, and self- incongruence. Hereditary designing offers an appealing option since it can possibly give quicker outcomes, resistance qualities can be acquired from numerous sources, the statement of local apple qualities can be altered, and the attractive characteristics of the changed cultivar or rootstock can be safeguarded. Pathogenesis Pathogenicity depends on many different factors such as the production of the siderophore desferrioxamine, metalloproteases, plasmids, and histone-like proteins. However, some essential factors of pathogenicity are variations in the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and the mechanism of type III secretion system and its associated proteins.Piqu√©, N√∫ria, David Mi√±ana-Galbis, Susana Merino, and Juan Tom√°s. \\"Virulence Factors of Erwinia Amylovora: A Review.\\" International Journal of Molecular Sciences 16.6 (2015): 12836-2854. Web. 15 Nov. 2016. EPS helps bacterial pathogens avoid plant defenses, ‚Äúclog‚Äù the host‚Äôs vascular system, protect bacteria against desiccation and attach to both surfaces and one another. One EPS is amylovoran, a polymer of pentasaccharide repeating units. If a strain of E. amylovora can not produce amylovoran it is not pathogenic and can not spread in plants. Levan is another EPS, and a lack of it will slow development of symptoms. Type III secretion systems are used for exporting and delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of host plants. This system mainly consists of Hrc proteins. Motility is another major virulence factor.Vrancken, K., Holtappels, M., et al. (May 2013). Pathogenicity and infection strategies of the fire blight pathogen Erwinia amylovora in Rosaceae: State of the art. Microbiology 159(5):823-832. Web. 15 Nov. 2016 Since E. amylovora is not an obligate biotroph, it is able to survive outside the host which allows it to spread in many ways such as rain.

Originally chartered in 1867 as the Albany Collegiate Institute in Albany, Oregon, the college was relocated to Portland in 1938 and in 1942 adopted the name Lewis & Clark College after the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Contemporarily, it has an undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences, a School of Law, and a Graduate School of Education and Counseling. Lewis & Clark is a member of the Annapolis Group of colleges with athletic programs competing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division III Northwest Conference. Just over 2,000 students attend the undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences, with a student body from more than 50 countries across six continents as well as most U.S. states. The School of Law is best known for its environmental law program, while the Graduate School of Education & Counseling is active in community engagement and social justice. Today, the three schools and their supporting offices occupy the campus, centered on the M. Lloyd Frank Estate on Palatine Hill in the Collins View neighborhood of Southwest Portland. History Albany College Administration Building. Like many modern universities, the institution that would eventually become Lewis & Clark was initially intended to provide secondary as well as higher education for a specific religious community, in this case Presbyterian pioneers in Oregon's Willamette Valley. To this end the Presbyterian church incorporated Albany Academy in 1858,Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. making Lewis & Clark one of four Oregon colleges with foundations predating Oregon's statehood (along with Willamette University, Pacific University, and Linfield College). Within a decade of its founding, Albany Academy began to focus more exclusively on higher education, changing its official name to the Albany Collegiate Institution in 1866. Lewis & Clark's official founding date comes from the current charter, which has been legally valid since the Presbyterian church reincorporated the Albany Collegiate Institution as Albany College in 1867. Unlike most Oregon colleges of the pioneer era, the college has been coeducational since the first class, which graduated in 1873. The early campus of in Albany was situated on land donated by the Monteith family. In 1892, the original school building was enlarged, and in 1925 the school relocated south of Albany where it remained until 1937. Albany College established a junior college to the north in Portland in 1934, with the entire school moving to Portland in 1939. The campus grounds later became home to the federal government's Albany Research Center. In 1942 the college trustees acquired the Lloyd Frank (of the historic Portland department store Meier & Frank) \\"Fir Acres\\" estate in southwest Portland, and the school name was changed to Lewis & Clark College. The original school mascot, the Pirates, was changed to the Pioneers in 1946. Academics The three schools of the college include the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), the Law School, and the Graduate School of Education and Counseling. CAS departments include Art, Art History, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biology, Chemistry, Chinese, Classics, Computer Science, Dance, East Asian Studies, Economics, English, Environmental Studies, Ethnic Studies, Foreign Languages, French Studies, Gender Studies, German Studies, Hispanic Studies, History, International Affairs, Japanese, Latin American Studies, Mathematics, Music, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Physics, Political Economy, Political Science, Psychology, Religious Studies, Rhetoric and Media Studies, Russian, Sociology and Anthropology, and Theatre. Lewis & Clark offers approximately 36 study abroad programs in various countries, and since the 1960s, more than 60% of all Lewis & Clark undergraduates have studied abroad. =Admissions profile= For the Class of 2022 (enrolling fall 2018), Lewis & Clark received 6,139 applications, admitted 4,528 (73.8%), and enrolled 562 students. For the freshmen who enrolled, the middle 50% range of SAT scores was 1230-1390, the ACT Composite range was 27‚Äì31, and the average high school grade point average was 3.90. Rankings The 2020 annual ranking of U.S. News & World Report categorizes Lewis & Clark as 'more selective' and ranks it tied for the 72nd best liberal arts college in the U.S.; U.S. News & World Report also ranked it tied for 51st in undergraduate teaching and 89th for \\"Best Value\\" among liberal arts colleges. Forbes in 2019 rated it 184th in its America's Top Colleges ranking, which includes 650 military academies, national universities, and liberal arts colleges and 69th among liberal arts colleges.

Lewis & Clark's forested campus sits atop Palatine Hill in the Collins View neighborhood of Portland and is contiguous with the Tryon Creek State Natural Area. Campus buildings include an award-winning environmentally sustainable academic building (John R. Howard Hall), as well as notable historic architecture such as the Frank Manor House (designed by Herman Brookman) and Rogers Hall (formerly Our Lady of Angels convent of The Sisters of St. Francis). Due in large part to the college's natural environment, Lewis & Clark was named one of America's top ten \\"Most Beautiful Campuses\\" by the Princeton Review, Travel+Leisure as well as an independent architecture blog. =Residence halls= Stewart Residence Hall. All students are required to live on campus for the first two years, unless already a Portland resident. Residence halls include SOA (Stewart-Odell-Akin), Forest (Alder, Manzanita, Juniper, Spruce, and Ponderosa), Hartzfeld, Holmes, Platt-Howard, Copeland and also include East, Roberts, and West, the on-campus apartments. Lewis & Clark College residence halls are co-ed. While individual rooms generally house one gender, students may opt otherwise under the college's gender-neutral housing policy. Student life =Sustainability= Roses are abundant at Lewis & Clark College Wind power provides 100% of the college's total electricity, and LEED-\\"certified\\" level must be met for all of the college's projects. =Athletics= Lewis & Clark maintains 9 male and 10 female varsity sports teams, and athletic facilities including Pamplin Sports Center and Griswold Stadium. Lewis & Clark athletic teams are called the Pioneers, and team colors are orange and black. The Pioneers compete mainly in the Northwest Conference against eight other NCAA Division III institutions in the Pacific Northwest. One in five undergraduates are officially designated student athletes. Recent accomplishments in varsity athletics include the men's rowing team winning its conference, women's swim team winning third in conference, and men's and women's basketball both earning third in conference. In the 2011 season, the women's cross-country team placed seventh at West regionals, with the men's team placing 13th. The 2011-2012 men's basketball team lost in the NWC semifinals putting them in 4th place in the conference. Additionally, the women's team of that same year placed second in the NWC and made an appearance in the NCAA DIII National tournament. The volleyball and basketball teams play in Pamplin Sports Center. The football, soccer and track and field events take place at Griswold Stadium. A large number of smaller club and intramural sports such as Rugby, Ultimate Frisbee, and Boffing enjoy broad participation. Lewis & Clark students have invented several intramural competitive sports, including Ninja and Wolvetch, which are popular at Lewis & Clark but seldom played elsewhere. While some varsity athletic events are well attended, there has long been tension between varsity athletes and non-athletes regarding perceived social and cultural differences, as well as the substantial financial support varsity sports teams enjoy. = Food = Lewis and Clark has two on-campus dining halls: Fields Dining Room and the Trail Room. Meal services are provided by Bon App√©tit Management Company. Fields Dining room is often referred to as \\"The Bon.\\" Additionally, there are two caf√©s on campus: Maggie's Caf√© on the residential side and The Dovecote on the academic side. =Transportation= Pioneer Express shuttle bus starting a trip to downtown Portland, in 2016 Throughout the year the college operates a shuttle bus between campus and downtown Portland, the Pioneer Express (also referred to as the \\"Pio Express\\" or just, \\"the Pio\\"). TriMet line 39 operates between the college and the Hillsdale neighborhood, where students can transfer to buses to downtown Portland. First-year students are not permitted to have cars on campus.

The Group of Seven, also sometimes known as the Algonquin School, was a group of Canadian landscape painters from 1920 to 1933, originally consisting of Franklin Carmichael (1890‚Äì1945), Lawren Harris (1885‚Äì1970), A. Y. Jackson (1882‚Äì1974), Frank Johnston (1888‚Äì1949), Arthur Lismer (1885‚Äì1969), J. E. H. MacDonald (1873‚Äì1932), and Frederick Varley (1881‚Äì1969). Later, A. J. Casson (1898‚Äì1992) was invited to join in 1926, Edwin Holgate (1892‚Äì1977) became a member in 1930, and LeMoine FitzGerald (1890‚Äì1956) joined in 1932. Two artists commonly associated with the group are Tom Thomson (1877‚Äì1917) and Emily Carr (1871‚Äì1945). Although he died before its official formation, Thomson had a significant influence on the group. In his essay \\"The Story of the Group of Seven\\", Harris wrote that Thomson was \\"a part of the movement before we pinned a label on it\\"; Thomson's paintings The West Wind and The Jack Pine are two of the group's most iconic pieces. Emily Carr was also associated with the Group of Seven, though never an official member. Believing that a distinct Canadian art could be developed through direct contact with nature, the Group of Seven is best known for its paintings inspired by the Canadian landscape, and initiated the first major Canadian national art movement. The Group was succeeded by the Canadian Group of Painters in 1933, which included members from the Beaver Hall Group who had a history of showing with the Group of Seven internationally. Collections Large collections of work from the Group of Seven are located at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa as well as the Ottawa Art Gallery (home to The Firestone Collection of Canadian Art) and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. The National Gallery, under the directorship of Eric Brown, was an early institutional supporter of artists associated with the Group, purchasing art from some of their early exhibitions before they had identified themselves officially as the Group of Seven. The Art Gallery of Ontario, in its earlier incarnation as the Art Gallery of Toronto, was the site of their first exhibition as the Group of Seven in 1920. The McMichael gallery was founded by Robert and Signe McMichael, who began collecting paintings by the Group of Seven and their contemporaries in 1955. History Red Maple, 1914, by A. Y. Jackson, National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa Tom Thomson, J. E. H. MacDonald, Arthur Lismer, Frederick Varley, Frank Johnston and Franklin Carmichael met as employees of the design firm Grip Ltd. in Toronto. In 1913, they were joined by A. Y. (Alexander Young) Jackson and Lawren Harris. They often met at the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto to discuss their opinions and share their art. This group received monetary support from Harris (heir to the Massey- Harris farm machinery fortune) and Dr. James MacCallum. Harris and MacCallum jointly built the Studio Building in 1914 in the Rosedale ravine to serve as a meeting and working place for the new Canadian art movement. MacCallum owned an island on Georgian Bay and Thomson worked as a guide in nearby Algonquin Park, both places where he and the other artists often travelled for inspiration. Gas Chamber at Seaford, 1918, by Frederick Varley, Canadian War Museum, Ottawa The informal group was temporarily split up during World War I, during which JacksonBrandon, Laura. (2008). and VarleyDavis, Ann. (1992). became official war artists. Jackson enlisted in June 1915 and served in France from November 1915 to 1917, at which point he was seriously injured. Harris enlisted in 1916 and taught musketry at Camp Borden. He was discharged in May 1918 after suffering a nervous breakdown. Carmichael, MacDonald, Thomson, Varley and Johnston remained in Toronto and struggled in the depressed wartime economy. A further blow to the group came in 1917 when Thomson died mysteriously while canoeing in Algonquin Park. The circumstances of his death remain unclear. The seven who formed the original group reunited after the war. They continued to travel throughout Ontario, especially the Muskoka and Algoma regions, sketching the landscape and developing techniques to represent it in art. In 1919, they decided to make themselves into a group devoted to a distinct Canadian form of art which did not exist yet, and began to call themselves the Group of Seven. It is unknown who specifically chose these seven men, but it is believed to have been Harris. By 1920, they were ready for their first exhibition thanks to the constant support and encouragement of Eric Brown, the director of the National Gallery at that time. Prior to this, many artists believed the Canadian landscape was not worthy of being painted. Reviews for the 1920 exhibition were mixed, but as the decade progressed the Group came to be recognized as pioneers of a new, Canadian, school of art. After Frank Johnston moved to Winnipeg in the fall of 1921, some years passed before A. J. Casson was invited to join in 1926. Franklin Carmichael had taken a liking to him and had encouraged Casson to sketch and paint for many years. The Jack Pine, 1916‚Äì17, by Tom Thomson, National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa The Group's champions during its early years included Barker Fairley, a co-founder of Canadian Forum magazine, and the warden of Hart House at the University of Toronto, J. Burgon Bickersteth. The members of the Group began to travel elsewhere in Canada for inspiration, including British Columbia, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and the Arctic. After Samuel Gurney Cresswell and other painters on Royal Navy expeditions, these were the first artists of European descent who depicted the Arctic. Soon, the Group made the decision that to be called a \\"national school of painters\\" there should be members from outside Toronto. As a result, in 1930 Edwin Holgate from Montreal, Quebec became a member, followed by LeMoine FitzGerald from Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1932. The Group's influence was so widespread by the end of 1931, and after J. E. H. MacDonald's death in 1932, they no longer found it necessary to continue as a group of painters. They announced that the Group had been disbanded and that a new association of painters would be formed, known as the Canadian Group of Painters. The Canadian Group‚Äîwhich eventually consisted of the majority of Canada's leading artists‚Äîheld its first exhibition in 1933, and continued to hold exhibitions almost every year as a successful society until 1967. Legacy The Group of Seven has received criticism for its reinforcement of terra nullius presenting the region as pristine and untouched by humans when in fact the areas depicted have been lived in for many centuries. This sentiment was expressed by Jackson, who in his 1958 autobiography wrote, In 1966, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario incorporated the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, an art gallery with an institutional focus on the Group of Seven, along with \\"their contemporaries and on the aboriginal peoples of Canada\\". In addition to housing a collection of works by the Group of Seven, the museum property also contains the burial ground for six members of the group, including A.Y. Jackson,A.Y. Jackson , McMichael Canadian Art Collection Arthur Lismer,Arthur Lismer , McMichael Canadian Art Collection Frederick Varley,Frederick Varley , McMichael Canadian Art Collection Lawren Harris,Lawren Harris , McMichael Canadian Art Collection Frank Johnston,Frank Johnston , McMichael Canadian Art Collection and A.J. Casson;A.J. Casson , McMichael Canadian Art Collection along with four of the artists' wives. The McMichael cemetery is situated in the small patch of consecrated land bordered by trees, with graves marked by large chunks of the Canadian Shield. The idea to use the property as a burial ground for the group was first proposed to the institution by Jackson in 1968. In 1995, the National Gallery of Canada compiled a Group of Seven retrospective show, for which they commissioned the Canadian rock band Rheostatics to write a musical score. That score was released on album as Music Inspired by the Group of Seven. Contemporary painter Rae Johnson has derived much of her style from the Group of Seven, as do many other artists. Recognition On September 18, 1970, Canada Post issued 'The Group of Seven', designed by Allan Robb Fleming and based on a painting, \\"Isles of Spruce\\" (1922), by Arthur Lismer and held in the Hart House Permanent Collection, University of Toronto. The 6¬¢ stamps are perforated 11, and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited. On June 29, 1995, Canada Post issued 10 stamps, each based on a painting of a member of the group (7 original members and 3 additional members): * Francis Hans Johnston, Serenity, Lake of the Woods * Arthur Lismer, A September Gale, Georgian Bay * James Edward Hervey MacDonald, Falls, Montreal River * Frederick Horsman Varley, Open Window * Franklin Carmichael, October Gold * Lawren Stewart Harris, North of Lake Superior * Alexander Young Jackson, Evening, Les √âboulements * Alfred Joseph Casson, Mill Houses * Lionel LeMoine FitzGerald, Pembina Valley * Edwin Headley Holgate, The Lumberjack On May 7, 2020, Canada Post honoured the centennial of the Group's first exhibition, at the Toronto Gallery of Art (May 7, 1920), by issuing seven stamps, featuring paintings by each of the original members.Canada Post celebrates centennial of Group of Seven's first exhibition, Canada Post news release, Ottawa, May 6, 2020 The stamps were produced in a booklet of seven self-adhesives, and on a souvenir sheet of seven gummed stamps.

The Group is notable for its equal inclusion of men and women artists, as well as for its embrace of Jazz Age modernism. They painted a variety of subjects, including portraits, landscapes, urban scenes and still lifes, in a mix of Modernist and traditional styles. Members The ten female artists who are together known as the Beaver Hall Group were: *Nora Collyer *Emily Coonan *Prudence Heward *Mabel Lockerby *Mabel May *Kathleen Morris *Lilias Torrance Newton *Sarah Robertson *Anne Savage *Ethel Seath All ten of the group's participants had studied under William Brymner (1855‚Äì1925), a prominent Canadian artist who encouraged them to explore new modernistic approaches to painting. In an era when women artists were viewed as little more than hobbyists and were left out of the mainstream world of professional art, the Beaver Hall Group was the first Canadian artists association in which women played a central role. History The group was formally founded in May 1920, inaugurated through the efforts of Randolph Stanley Hewton, Edwin Holgate, Mabel May and Lilias Torrance Newton.http://artcore.ca/beaverhall.html The group's name derives from 305 Beaver Hall Hill, the location of the downtown Montreal studio where its members shared space. It counted among the founding members eleven men and eight women. In addition to Hewton, Holgate, May and Newton, original members included Mabel Lockerby, Anne Savage, Albert H. Robinson and President of the group, A.Y. Jackson. The first Beaver Hall exhibition took place January 17, 1921. In his opening speech, Jackson emphasized the right of the artist to paint what they feel \\"with utter disregard for what has hitherto been considered requisite to the acceptance of the work at the recognized art exhibitions in Canadian centres. 'Schools' and 'isms' do not trouble us,\\" Jackson stressed, \\"individual expression is our chief concern\\". He identified its goals as being those of the Group of Seven, and over the years Jackson maintained the contact between Toronto and Montreal, supporting and stimulating the Montreal artists through regular visits and correspondence. He kept them informed of events in Toronto and arranged for their works to be included in the Group of Seven exhibitions. Both the Montreal Gazette and La Presse gave generous coverage to the vernissage. The association only survived for two years, during which time they held only four exhibitions with many different artists exhibiting among them. In 1924, the Beaver Hall Group gave up their rented studio but maintained their working studios at home. Many of the women from the Beaver Hall Group exhibited with the all-male Group of Seven internationally. When the Group of Seven formally disbanded in 1932, the women of the Beaver Hall Group helped establish the Canadian Group of Painters in 1933, to provide exhibition opportunities. Nevertheless, Group artists maintained an information association into the early 1960s. The current understanding of the Beaver Hall Group as a group of Montreal-based women painters can be traced back to Nora McCullough's (National Gallery of Canada liaison to Western Canada) 1966 traveling exhibition \\"The Beaver Hall Hill Group\\". Until that time, the ten women who had continued their informal network after the disbanding of the formal Beaver Hall Group had not had a name for their association. McCollough's aim was to expose the talent of Quebec's women artists to western Canada. Anne Savage and A.Y. Jackson had told her about the original Beaver Hall Group and the name of the group became somehow confused with the name of the street, which is how the exhibition got its name. More recently, curators have discovered a new dimension of Canadian modernism in the Beaver Hall Group. In contrast to the familiar modernist icons of the Toronto-based Group of Seven, the Montreal Beaver Hall painters were occupied with distinctly urban subjects: industry, fashion, and city life. Commenting on a recent exhibition, 1920s Modernism in Montreal: The Beaver Hall Group at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, co-curator Brian Foss said, \\"As fascinating and important as the Group of Seven was, it wasn't the only word on Canadian Modernism. Hopefully visitors will be struck by the extraordinary vibrancy, diversity and sheer quality of the art, and will come away with enhanced admiration for the real contributions Montreal artists made to Modernist art in this country.\\" References Further reading * Des Rochers, Jacques and Brian Foss (2015).

In temperate continental climates, these storms are not necessarily restricted to the winter season, but may occur in the late autumn and early spring as well. Very rarely, they may form in summer, though it would have to be an abnormally cold summer, such as the summer of 1816 in the Northeastern United States.  Snow  Snowstorms are storms where large amounts of snow fall. of snow is enough to create serious disruptions to traffic and school transport (because of the difficulty to drive and maneuver the school buses on slick roads). This is particularly true in places where snowfall is not typical but heavy accumulating snowfalls can occur. In places where snowfall is typical, such small snowfalls are rarely disruptive, because of effective snow and ice removal by municipalities, increased use of four-wheel drive and snow tires, and drivers being more used to winter conditions. Snowfalls in excess of are usually universally disruptive. A massive snowstorm with strong winds and other conditions meeting certain criteria is known as a blizzard. A large number of heavy snowstorms, some of which were blizzards, occurred in the United States during 1888 and 1947 as well as the early and mid-1990s. The snowfall of 1947 exceeded with drifts and snow piles from plowing that reached and for months, temperatures did not rise high enough to melt the snow. The 1993 \\"Superstorm\\" manifested as a blizzard in most of the affected areas. Large snowstorms could be quite dangerous: a snowstorm will make some unplowed roads impassable, and it is possible for automobiles to get stuck in the snow. Snowstorms exceeding especially in southern or generally warm climates will cave the roofs of some homes and cause the loss of electricity. Standing dead trees can also be brought down by the weight of the snow, especially if it is wet or very dense. Even a few inches of dry snow can form drifts many feet high under windy conditions. = Dangers of snow = a 2016 blizzard, New York City. Accumulating snow can make driving motor vehicles very hazardous. Accumulation of snow on roadways reduces friction between tires and the pavement, which in turn lowers the maneuverability of a vehicle considerably. As a result, average driving speeds on public roads and highways are reduced by up to 40% while heavy snow is falling. Visibilities are reduced by falling snow, and this is further exacerbated by strong winds which are commonly associated with winter storms producing heavy snowfall. In extreme cases, this may lead to prolonged whiteout conditions in which visibilities are reduced to only a few feet due to falling or blowing snow. These hazards can manifest even after snowfall has ended when strong winds are present, as these winds will pick up and transport fallen snow back onto roadways and reduce visibilities in the process. This can even result in blizzard conditions if winds are strong enough.https://www.weather.gov/mkx/wwa-impacts Heavy snowfall can immobilize a vehicle entirely, which may be deadly depending on how long it takes rescue crews to arrive. The clogging of a vehicle's tailpipe by snow may lead to carbon monoxide buildup inside the cabin.https://www.weather.gov/dmx/wintersafety Depending on the temperature profile in the atmosphere, snow can be either wet or dry. Dry snow, being lighter, is transported by wind more easily and accumulates more efficiently. Wet snow is heavier due to the increased water content. Significant accumulations of heavy wet snow can cause roof damage. It also requires considerably more energy to move and this can create health problems while shoveling when combined with the harsh weather conditions. Numerous deaths as a result of heart attacks can be attributed to snow removal. Accretion of wet snow to elevated surfaces occurs when snow is \\"sticky\\" enough which can cause extensive tree and power line damage in a manner similar to ice accretion during ice storms. Power can be lost for days during a major winter storm, and this usually means the loss of heating inside buildings. Other than the obvious risk of hypothermia due to cold exposure, another deadly element associated with snowstorms is carbon monoxide poisoning which can happen anytime combustion products from generators or heating appliances are not properly vented. Finally, partially or fully melted snow on roadways can refreeze when temperatures fall, creating black ice. A sudden rise in air temperature is can result in the rapid melting of snow. This can create flooding issues if the snowpack has sufficient water content, and this can be significantly exacerbated by heavy rainfall and by ice jams which may have formed on area rivers during prolonged subfreezing temperatures. The re- freezing of previously melted snow creates potholes in roadways. This process is accelerated when water is melted and refrozen multiple times. Fog is also known to occur during rapid melting of snow. Avalanches and cornices occur when significant amounts of snow falls on mountains.  Freezing rain  Heavy showers of freezing rain are one of the most dangerous types of winter storm. They typically occur when a layer of warm air hovers over a region, but the ambient temperature a few meters above the ground is near or below , and the ground temperature is sub-freezing. While a snowstorm is somewhat manageable by the standards of the northern United States and Canada, a comparable ice storm can paralyze a region: driving becomes extremely hazardous, telephone and power lines are damaged, and crops may be ruined.Smith A.B. and R. Katz, 2013: U.S. Billion-dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Data sources, Trends, Accuracy and Biases. Natural Hazards, 67, 387‚Äì410, doi:10.1007/s11069-013-0566-5 Notable ice storms include an El Ni√±o- related North American ice storm of 1998 that affected much of eastern Canada, including Montreal and Ottawa, as well as upstate New York and part of New England. Three million people lost power, some for as long as six weeks. One- third of the trees in Montreal's Mount Royal park were damaged, as well as a large proportion of the sugar-producing maple trees. The amount of economic damage caused by the storm has been estimated at $3 billion Canadian. The Christmas Day Ice Storm of 2000 caused devastating electrical issues in parts of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The city of Texarkana, Arkansas experienced the worst damage, at one point losing the ability to use telephones, power and running water. In some areas in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas and eventually Louisiana, over an inch of ice accumulated from the freezing rain. The Ice Storm of December 2002 in North Carolina resulted in massive power loss throughout much of the state, and property damage due to falling trees. Except in the mountainous western part of the state, heavy snow and icy conditions are rare in North Carolina. The Ice Storm of December 2005 was another severe winter storm producing extensive ice damage across a large portion of the Southern United States on December 14 to 16. It led to power outages and at least 7 deaths. In January 2005, Kansas had been declared a major disaster zone by President George W. Bush after an ice storm caused nearly $39 million in damages to thirty-two counties. Federal funds were provided to the counties during January 4-6, 2005 to aid the recovery process. The January 2009 Central Plains and Midwest ice storm was a crippling and historic ice storm. Most places struck by the storm, saw or more of ice accumulation, and a few inches of snow on top of it. This brought down power lines, causing some people to go without power for a few days, to a few weeks. In some cases, some didn't see power for a month or more. At the height of the storm, more than 2 million people were without power.  Graupel  Ice crystals fall through a cloud of super-cooled droplets‚Äîminute cloud droplets that have fallen below freezing temperature but have not frozen. The ice crystal plows into the super-cooled droplets and they immediately freeze to it. This process forms graupel, or snow pellets, as the droplet continues to accumulate on the crystal. The pellets bounce when they hit the ground.  Ice pellets  Out ahead of the passage of a warm front, falling snow may partially melt and refreeze into a frozen rain drop before it reaches the ground. These ice pellets are called sleet in most of the US. Because it is easily seen and does not accumulate ice, it is not as dangerous as freezing rain.  Rime  Rime is a milky white accumulation of super-cooled cloud or fog droplets that freeze when they strike an object that has a temperature of , the freezing point of water. The process is called riming when super-cooled cloud droplets attach to ice crystals in the formation of graupel. Rime ice can pose a hazard to an airliner when it forms on a wing as an aircraft flies through a cloud of super-cooled droplets.

SQLite has bindings to many programming languages. Design Unlike client‚Äìserver database management systems, the SQLite engine has no standalone processes with which the application program communicates. Instead, the SQLite library is linked in and thus becomes an integral part of the application program. Linking may be static or dynamic. The application program uses SQLite's functionality through simple function calls, which reduce latency in database access: function calls within a single process are more efficient than inter-process communication. SQLite stores the entire database (definitions, tables, indices, and the data itself) as a single cross-platform file on a host machine. It implements this simple design by locking the entire database file during writing. SQLite read operations can be multitasked, though writes can only be performed sequentially. Due to the server-less design, SQLite applications require less configuration than client‚Äìserver databases. SQLite is called zero-conf because it does not require service management (such as startup scripts) or access control based on GRANT and passwords. Access control is handled by means of file-system permissions given to the database file itself. Databases in client‚Äìserver systems use file-system permissions that give access to the database files only to the daemon process. Another implication of the serverless design is that several processes may not be able to write to the database file. In server-based databases, several writers will all connect to the same daemon, which is able to handle its locks internally. SQLite, on the other hand, has to rely on file-system locks. It has less knowledge of the other processes that are accessing the database at the same time. Therefore, SQLite is not the preferred choice for write-intensive deployments. However, for simple queries with little concurrency, SQLite performance profits from avoiding the overhead of passing its data to another process. SQLite uses PostgreSQL as a reference platform. \\"What would PostgreSQL do\\" is used to make sense of the SQL standard. One major deviation is that, with the exception of primary keys, SQLite does not enforce type checking; the type of a value is dynamic and not strictly constrained by the schema (although the schema will trigger a conversion when storing, if such a conversion is potentially reversible). SQLite strives to follow Postel's rule. History D. Richard Hipp designed SQLite in the spring of 2000 while working for General Dynamics on contract with the United States Navy. Hipp was designing software used for a damage- control system aboard guided-missile destroyers, which originally used HP-UX with an IBM Informix database back-end. SQLite began as a Tcl extension. The design goals of SQLite were to allow the program to be operated without installing a database management system or requiring a database administrator. Hipp based the syntax and semantics on those of PostgreSQL 6.5. In August 2000, version 1.0 of SQLite was released, with storage based on gdbm (GNU Database Manager). SQLite 2.0 replaced gdbm with a custom B-tree implementation, adding transaction capability. SQLite 3.0, partially funded by America Online, added internationalization, manifest typing, and other major improvements. In 2011 Hipp announced his plans to add a NoSQL interface (managing documents expressed in JSON) to SQLite databases and to develop UnQLite, an embeddable document-oriented database. SQLite is one of four formats recommended for long-term storage of datasets approved for use by the Library of Congress. Features SQLite implements most of the SQL-92 standard for SQL, but lacks some features. For example, it only partially provides triggers and cannot write to views (however, it provides INSTEAD OF triggers that provide this functionality). While it provides complex queries, it still has limited ALTER TABLE function, as it cannot modify or delete columns. SQLite uses an unusual type system for a SQL-compatible DBMS: instead of assigning a type to a column as in most SQL database systems, types are assigned to individual values; in language terms it is dynamically typed. Moreover, it is weakly typed in some of the same ways that Perl is: one can insert a string into an integer column (although SQLite will try to convert the string to an integer first, if the column's preferred type is integer). This adds flexibility to columns, especially when bound to a dynamically typed scripting language. However, the technique is not portable to other SQL products. A common criticism is that SQLite's type system lacks the data integrity mechanism provided by statically typed columns in other products. The SQLite web site describes a \\"strict affinity\\" mode, but this feature has not yet been added. However, it can be implemented with constraints like \`CHECK(typeof(x)='integer')\`. Tables normally include a hidden rowid index column, which gives faster access. If a database includes an Integer Primary Key column, SQLite will typically optimize it by treating it as an alias for rowid, causing the contents to be stored as a strictly typed 64-bit signed integer and changing its behavior to be somewhat like an auto-incrementing column. Future versions of SQLite may include a command to introspect whether a column has behavior like that of rowid to differentiate these columns from weakly typed, non-autoincrementing Integer Primary Keys. SQLite with full Unicode function is optional. Several computer processes or threads may access the same database concurrently. Several read accesses can be satisfied in parallel. A write access can only be satisfied if no other accesses are currently being serviced. Otherwise, the write access fails with an error code (or can automatically be retried until a configurable timeout expires). This concurrent access situation would change when dealing with temporary tables. This restriction is relaxed in version 3.7 when write-ahead logging (WAL) is turned on, enabling concurrent reads and writes. Version 3.6.19 released on October 14, 2009 added support for foreign key constraints SQLite version 3.7.4 first saw the addition of the FTS4 (full-text search) module, which features enhancements over the older FTS3 module. FTS4 allows users to perform full-text searches on documents similar to how search engines search webpages. Version 3.8.2 added support for creating tables without rowid, which may provide space and performance improvements. Common table expressions support was added to SQLite in version 3.8.3. In 2015, with the json1 extension and new subtype interfaces, SQLite version 3.9 introduced JSON content managing. As per 3.33.0 version release max db size is 281 TB. Development and distribution SQLite's code is hosted with Fossil, a distributed version control system that is itself built upon an SQLite database. A standalone command-line program is provided in SQLite's distribution. It can be used to create a database, define tables, insert and change rows, run queries and manage an SQLite database file. It also serves as an example for writing applications that use the SQLite library. SQLite uses automated regression testing prior to each release. Over 2 million tests are run as part of a release's verification. Starting with the August 10, 2009 release of SQLite 3.6.17, SQLite releases have 100% branch test coverage, one of the components of code coverage. The tests and test harnesses are partially public-domain and partially proprietary. Notable uses =Middleware= * ADO.NET adapter, initially developed by Robert Simpson, is maintained jointly with the SQLite developers since April 2010. * ODBC driver has been developed and is maintained separately by Christian Werner. Werner's ODBC driver is the recommended connection method for accessing SQLite from OpenOffice.org. * COM (ActiveX) wrapper making SQLite accessible on Windows to scripted languages such as JScript and VBScript. This adds SQLite database capabilities to HTML Applications (HTA). =Web browsers= * The browsers Google Chrome, Opera, Safari and the Android Browser all allow for storing information in, and retrieving it from, a SQLite database within the browser, using the Web SQL Database technology, although this is rapidly becoming deprecated (namely superseded by IndexedDB). Internally these Chromium based browsers use SQLite databases for storing configuration data like site visit history, cookies, download history etc. * Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird store a variety of configuration data (bookmarks, cookies, contacts etc.) in internally managed SQLite databases. Until the advent of Firefox version 57 (\\"Firefox Quantum\\"), there is a third-party add-on that uses the code supporting this functionality to provide a user interface for managing arbitrary SQLite databases. * Several third-party add-ons can make use of JavaScript APIs to manage SQLite databases. =Web application frameworks= * Laravel * Bugzilla * Django's default database management system * Drupal * Trac * Ruby on Rails's default database management system * web2py =Various= * Adobe Systems uses SQLite as its file format in Adobe Photoshop Lightroom, a standard database in Adobe AIR, and internally within Adobe Reader. * As with most Apple software, Apple Photos uses SQLite under the hood. * Evernote uses SQLite to store its local database repository in Windows. * Skype * The Service Management Facility, used for service management within the Solaris and OpenSolaris operating systems * Flame (malware) * BMW IDrive Sat Nav system =Operating systems= SQLite is included by default in: * Blackberry's BlackBerry 10 OS * Symbian OS * Nokia's Maemo * Google's Android * Linux Foundation's MeeGo * LG's webOS * NetBSD * FreeBSD where starting with 10-RELEASE version in January 2014, it is used by the core package management system. * illumos * Oracle Solaris 10 where the Service Management Facility database is serialized for booting. * Apple adopted it as an option in macOS's Core Data API from the original implementation in Mac OS X 10.4 onwards, and also for administration of videos and songs, and in iOS for storage of text messages on the iPhone. * MorphOS since version 3.10 * Tizen * Windows 10 Programming language support Language bindings to SQLite for a large number of programming languages exist, including: See also * Comparison of relational database management systems * List of relational database management systems * SpatiaLite References =Citations= =Sources= External links by D.

It is traditionally popular because, according to the Christian Bible, Saint Andrew was one of the earliest disciples of Jesus and one of the twelve Apostles.  Origin of the name  The name derives from the Greek word ·ºÄŒΩŒÆœÅ (anƒìr), genitive ·ºÄŒΩŒ¥œÅœåœÇ (andr√≥s), that refers to man as opposed to woman (whereas man in the sense of human being is ·ºÑŒΩŒ∏œÅœâœÄŒøœÇ, √°nthropos). The original male Greek name, Andr√©as, represents the hypocoristic, with endearment functions, of male Greek names composed with the andr- prefix, like Androgeos (man of the earth), Androcles (man of glory), Andronikos (man of victory). The same root ·ºÄŒΩŒ¥œÅ-, andr- denoting the male gender is found e.g. in misandry (the hatred of the male sex), andrology (male physiology), androgens (male hormones) and polyandry (the practice of taking more than one husband at the same time). In the year 2006, it was the third most popular name in Italy with 3.1% of newborns. It is one of the Italian male names ending in a, with others being Elia (Elias), Enea (Aeneas), Luca (Lucas), Mattia (Matthias), Nicola (Nicholas), Tobia (Tobias). In recent and past times it has also been used on occasion as a female name in Italy and in Spain, where it is considered the legitimate feminine form of Andr√©s/Andreo/Andreu (Andrew). Outside of Italy, the name is generally considered a female name.  Usage  * In Czech, Slovak, Polish, Slovenian, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Scandinavian languages and Spanish, Andrea is a feminine name. Masculine forms are Andrej, Ond≈ôej, Andrzej, An≈æe, Andrew, Andreas, Andr√°s, Andreo, Andr√©s, Anders, Andries or Andre. * In Albanian Andrea is a masculine name; its native form is Endri. * In Romansh Andrea is also a masculine name. * In Italian, Andrea is a primarilyDizionario della lingua italiana ‚Äì Volume VII, p. 529 masculine name. * In Bulgarian Andrea is used as the feminine form of \\"Andrei\\". * In Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia, Andrea is a feminine name; Andreja can be used as female name, while Andrija, Andro and Andrej are masculine forms. The only exception is Istria, where Andrea is a male name. * In Romania Andreea is a feminine name and it is written with an extra \\"e\\". However, the feminine variation Andrea is also used. Andrea as etymon means knitting needle in Romanian. Andrei is the masculine form. * Andr√©a is a Brazilian Portuguese form of Andrea also used in Portugal along with Andreia. * In Dutch, Andrea is used as a female name, although the variant Andr√©e is found in French. *In Spanish, Andrea and a variation spelled Andressa are used as female variants for Andreo and Andr√©s. **In Basque, Andrea and Andere exist as female names. Two etymons merge in the former: the most widespread form with a Greek root, 'man', and the Basque- Aquitanian ancient form \\"andere(a)\\", present-day \\"andere(a)\\" and \\"andre(a)\\", 'madam', 'lady' (used mainly as title, e.g. \\"Andramari\\", 'Lady/Virgin Mary'), as opposed to \\"jaun\\", 'lord'. In popular usage it can ultimately mean 'adult woman'. ** In Catalan, Andrea is used as the feminine form of \\"Andreu\\".

She was married to Taoiseach and 3rd President of Ireland, √âamon de Valera. Background She was born Jane O'Flanagan in Balbriggan. Her father, Laurence, was a carpenter and was a native of Kildare who moved to Balbriggan and married a local girl, Margaret Byrne. The couple emigrated to New York City, where their daughter Mary was born in 1871. The family returned to Balbriggan in 1873, and Sin√©ad was born there in 1878. She trained as a teacher and worked first in Edenderry, before taking up a post at a national school in Dorset Street, Dublin in around 1901. The 1901 census records her as 'Jane Flanagan', living with her parents and three siblings at 6 Richmond Cottages in Dublin. Marriage and children In her spare time, she taught Irish at the Leinster College of the Gaelic League in Parnell Square. One of her Irish students was √âamon de Valera, then a teacher of mathematics. On 8 January 1910, they were married. Together they had five sons, Vivion, √âamon, Brian, R√∫aidhr√≠ and Terence (Terry), and two daughters, M√°ir√≠n and Emer. On 9 February 1936, Brian, then aged twenty, was killed in a riding accident in the Phoenix Park. Due to a combination of his imprisonment, political activities, and fundraising tours of the United States, the family saw relatively little of √âamon de Valera in the 1916 to 1923 period. He was also away from home frequently during the early years of his political career. Sin√©ad de Valera played little or no public role during her husband's fifty years in public life. Literary output Sin√©ad de Valera wrote thirty-one books for children, in both English and Irish. Among her works were plays such as Cluichidhe na Gaedhilge (1935) and story collections such as The Emerald Ring and Other Irish Fairy Stories (1951), The Stolen Child and Other Stories (1961), The Four-leafed Shamrock (1964) and The Miser's Gold (1970). Spouse of president Her husband was inaugurated as President of Ireland on 25 June 1959, two days after retiring as Taoiseach. They immediately took up residence at √Åras an Uachtar√°in.

It was released in the United States on February 6, 2009, and in Canada on April 3, 2009. Plot 1998: Eric Bottler reunites with his old high school buddies Linus, Hutch, Windows and Zoe at a Halloween party. There is tension between Bottler and his old friends, due to Bottler being the only one that matured since high school; now a car salesman at his father's dealership, Bottler finds that his friends have not changed a bit since high school. The number one thing they still have in common is their love of Star Wars. The gang expresses their anticipation for the latest installment to the franchise, The Phantom Menace. Linus proposes an idea that Bottler and he had been plotting since they were children: to infiltrate Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of the film, but Bottler dismisses this. The next day, Hutch and Windows meet Bottler at work and inform him that Linus is dying from cancer. The doctors estimate that he only has roughly four months to live; Episode I comes out in six. To make peace with his former best friend, Bottler decides to go through with their plan and infiltrate Skywalker Ranch. The four begin their trip to Texas, where they have to meet Rogue Leader, a girl Windows is having an online relationship with, for information on getting into the Ranch. While on the road, Hutch decides to take a detour to Riverside, Iowa (the future birthplace of Captain James T. Kirk) in an attempt to start a fight with some Trekkies. Hutch gets his wish after attacking a Trekkie by the name of Admiral Seasholtz (Seth Rogen) in retaliation to Seasholtz insulting Han Solo, to which Hutch responds by running down their statue of Captain Kirk and Khan. The boys' van breaks down and they stumble upon a biker bar. Once inside they ask for help and a glass of water that costs $100. Refusing to pay, Hutch tries to pass himself off as a tough guy who just got out of prison, only to discover that they are in a gay bar. In order to pay for the drink, they are forced to become the \\"midnight entertainment\\" and strip to the music of Menudo, which goes terribly wrong when Hutch displays his one testicle. They are saved by a man named \\"The Chief\\", who fixes their van after they pass out from eating guacamole laced with peyote. He gives a bag of this to Linus as a parting gift. After arriving in Texas, Windows meets Rogue Leader, who to his horror is a 10-year-old girl. The group is then assaulted by her uncle, Harry Knowles, who beats up Windows and tells him to never talk to his niece again. After explaining their situation, Harry quizzes them to prove they are true fanboys, then gives them information on one of his contacts that knows how to successfully enter Skywalker Ranch. They are told to meet Harry's contact in Las Vegas, but on their way there they are arrested for fleeing a police vehicle and possession of peyote. Zoe arrives to bail them out of jail, and ‚Äî having traveled halfway across the country to get them ‚Äî insists on accompanying them on their journey. Eric is reluctant to continue when the judge (Billy Dee Williams) gives him a message from his father to come home or lose his job, but the others convince him to carry on by calling the journey their \\"Death Star\\", the one great thing that will live with them forever. Once in Las Vegas, Hutch and Windows attempt to have sex with some girls while Bottler and Linus go to meet Harry's contact. They are shocked to find that his contact is none other than William Shatner, who gives them the information they need and leaves. As they leave, they are attacked by Seasholtz and his Trekkie friends, who were attending a Star Trek convention in the same hotel. Meanwhile, Hutch and Windows discover that the girls they were with are escort girls and flee when their angry pimp, Roach (also played by Seth Rogen), wants them to pay up. Windows also learns that Zoe is in love with him. The group escapes their adversaries but Linus is injured in the process. When taken to the hospital, Linus is informed by a doctor (Carrie Fisher) that he must return home for the sake of his health. When the group feels the situation has become hopeless, Eric refuses to give up on their plan and manages to inspire the gang to continue, reminding them that Star Wars means very much not just to Linus, but to all of them. The group leaves the hospital and eventually makes it to Skywalker Ranch. Shortly after breaking into the ranch and marveling at the collection of original props and costumes used in the films, they are discovered by security guards and are caught after a brief chase. The Head of Security tells them of their impending doom when he receives a phone call from George Lucas himself. Lucas tells him that he will drop all charges if they can prove to him that they are \\"fanboys\\". The five are individually quizzed, including questions designed to show that they do not know much about the opposite sex (of which only Zoe is able to answer), after which the Head of Security confirms that they are fanboys and Lucas drops all charges. Being aware of Linus's illness, Lucas allows him to watch the film alone while his friends wait outside. After the film ends, Bottler joins his friends around a campfire and mends his friendship with Linus. Weeks later, Linus dies of his illness. On May 19, 1999, Bottler, Windows and Zoe emerge from their tent they used to camp out in while waiting in line for the first showing of Episode I. Bottler has followed his and Linus's dream by becoming a comic book artist, Hutch has finally started his own detailing business, and Windows and Zoe are now in a relationship. Hutch arrives at the theater with beers he smuggled in, which they use to toast Linus's memory. Just before the film starts, Bottler comments \\"What if the movie sucks?\\" Cast * Jay Baruchel as Windows * Dan Fogler as Harold \\"Hutch\\" Hutchinson * Sam Huntington as Eric Bottler * Chris Marquette as Linus * Kristen Bell as Zoe * David Denman as Chaz * Christopher McDonald as Big Chuck * Billy Dee Williams as Judge Reinhold * Danny Trejo as The Chief * Ethan Suplee as Harry Knowles * Seth Rogen as Admiral Seasholtz / Alien / Roach * Isaac Kappy as Garfunkel There are numerous cameos related to Star Wars and other science-fiction/cult-hit films including Carrie Fisher, Jason Mewes, Kevin Smith, Jaime King, Danny McBride, Ray Park, Craig Robinson, Joe Lo Truglio, Lou Taylor Pucci, Will Forte and William Shatner. In Park's role, he acts as a Skywalker Ranch security guard who says, \\"Time for you to get mauled, boy,\\" as he pulls out two nightsticks in response to Windows threatening him with a toy lightsaber. Production =Development= After George Lucas was given an advance screening of the rough cut of the film, he enjoyed it and gave it his \\"stamp of approval\\", and even offered the original Star Wars sound effects for use in the film. Filmmaker and Star Wars fan Kevin Smith also viewed an early version of the film and asked for (and was given) a cameo in the film. The film was originally to be released on August 17, 2007. The film was pushed back once more to January 2008 because director Kyle Newman was given more funding to shoot additional scenes that the original budget did not include. Getting the cast back together would only be possible in September 2007, thus the film's release date had to be moved to 2008. The film was again pushed back because the reshoots could not take place before November/December 2007. These reshoots were directed by Steven Brill and not by Newman. On January 14, The CineManiac reported that the film was being re- edited to remove the cancer plot from the film and replace much of it with raunchy, vulgar humor. Ain't It Cool News picked up the story and confirmed that the two different versions of the film (with and without the cancer subplot) were screened to different test audiences in Burbank, California in January 2008 to see which one would rate higher. As for a new release date, Newman stated in a Movie Geeks United! interview that the film would hopefully come out in April 2008. Upon hearing about the changes being made to the film, an internet campaign was begun to protest the plot changes and demand that the original version with the cancer storyline be released in theaters. Brill retaliated in a derogatory manner, calling fans \\"losers\\" in online correspondence which ended up released to the public. In one exchange, Brill called a fan \\"dumb\\" and threatened to \\"hunt him down\\" in a profanity-laden emailed response to a letter of complaint. In an interview Newman chastised Brill's behavior, saying: A rough cut of the full film (that included the cancer storyline) was shown in public for the first time at Star Wars Celebration Europe on July 14, 2007. On July 9, 2008, Newman confirmed in a TheForce.net interview that the cancer plot would be included in the final cut of the film. Newman was given just 36 hours to reassemble his film, and edit back in the key motivational cancer plotline. The final cut of the film was screened on July 24, 2008 in San Diego at Comic-Con. It was announced there that Fanboys would be released to theaters on September 19, 2008, but soon after, the official Weinstein Company website announced that this had changed to November 26, 2008. The final release date was finally pushed to February 6, 2009. Release =Theatrical run and box office= Fanboys was released on February 6, 2009 in eight US markets. The film expanded into 10 more cities on February 20, 2009, including a special screening in Columbus, Ohio that day, followed by a Q&A; session after the film with Kyle Newman, Ernie Cline, Matt Perniciaro and Kevin Mann. According to Cline's pre-show speech, he wanted to hold a special screening with fans in his home state, since he grew up in nearby Ashland, Ohio, and the story was set in a fictional town similar to Ashland. The film expanded its release to seven more markets on February 27, 2009, to 13 more on March 13, 2009, and an additional 9 on March 20, 2009. On April 3, 2009, it was released in Canadian theaters. The film was also released on May 7, 2009 in Denmark and showed for approximately three weeks, it was released in Germany on July 30, 2009. Fanboys was not profitable. The film's budget was approximately $3.9 million, but the film made only $960,828. =Critical reception= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 32% based on 97 reviews and an average rating of 4.8/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"This undercooked, sporadically funny road movie is a sop to Star Wars fanatics, but the uninitiated will find little to enjoy.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 45 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".https://www.metacritic.com/movie/fanboys Roger Ebert gave the film out of 4 stars, calling it \\"an amiable but disjointed film that identifies too closely with its heroes. Poking a little more fun at them would have been a great idea.\\" James Berardinelli gave it out of 4 stars, saying it was \\"mostly a middling road picture that doesn't do a lot more than any average, forgettable entry into the tired genre.\\" Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz of At the Movies recommended to \\"Skip It\\". Lyons said, \\"It was a great premise; it just unfortunately did not come together\\", and Mankiewicz commented that \\"it devolves into nothing more than a silly road trip movie.\\" =Home media= The DVD was released on May 19, 2009, the day of the 10th anniversary of The Phantom Menace. The DVD and Blu-ray were also released in Canada on June 2, 2009. The region 2 DVD was released on October 4, 2010.

He was officially credited with 72 victories, making him the top Canadian and British Empire ace of the war. He was an Air Marshal and a Victoria Cross recipient. During the Second World War, Bishop was instrumental in setting up and promoting the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. Early life Bishop as an officer cadet of the Royal Military College of Canada, c. 1914 Bishop was born in Owen Sound, Ontario.McCaffery 1988, p. 2. He was the third of four children born to William Avery Bishop Sr. and Margaret Louisa (Green) Bishop. His father, a lawyer and graduate of Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto, Ontario, was the Registrar of Grey County.McCaffery 1988, p. 3. Attending Owen Sound Collegiate and Vocational Institute, Bishop earned the reputation of a fighter, defending himself and others easily against bullies. He avoided team sports, preferring solitary pursuits such as swimming, horse riding, and shooting.Greenhous 2002, p. 29. Bishop was less successful at his studies; he would abandon any subject he could not easily master, and was often absent from class.McCaffery 1988, p. 4. At the age of 15, Bishop built an aircraft out of cardboard, wooden crates and string, and made an attempt to fly off the roof of his three-story house. He was dug, unharmed, out of the wreckage by his sister. In 1911, Billy Bishop entered the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario, where his brother Worth had graduated in 1903.Greenhous 2002, p. 30. At RMC, Bishop was known as \\"Bish\\" and \\"Bill\\". Bishop failed his first year at RMC, worked hard his second year but in his third year was caught cheating.Greenhous 2002, p. 31. First World War When the First World War broke out later in 1914, Bishop left RMC and joined The Mississauga Horse cavalry regiment.McCaffery 1988, pp. 10‚Äì11. He was commissioned as an officer but was ill with pneumonia when the regiment was sent overseas.McCaffery 1988, p. 14. After recovering, he was transferred to the 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles, a mounted infantry unit, then stationed in London, Ontario.Greenhous 2002, p. 34. Bishop showed a natural ability with a gun, and excelled on the firing range: he put bullets in a target placed so far away others saw only a dot due to his seemingly \\"super-human\\" eyesightMcCaffery 1988, pp. 17‚Äì18. They left Canada for England on 6 June 1915 on board the requisitioned cattle ship Caledonia.McCaffery 1988, p. 18. On 21 June, off the coast of Ireland, the ship's convoy came under attack by U-boats. Two ships were sunk and 300 Canadians died, but Bishop's ship was unharmed, arriving in Plymouth harbour on 23 June.McCaffery 1988, pp. 20‚Äì21. =As an observer= Bishop quickly became frustrated with the mud of the trenches and the lack of action. In July 1915, after watching an RFC aircraft return from a mission, Bishop said \\"it's clean up there! I'll bet you don't get any mud or horse shit on you up there. If you die, at least it would be a clean death.\\"McCaffery 1988, p. 22. While in France in 1915 he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps. As there were no places available for pilots in the flight school, he chose to be an observer.McCaffery 1988, pp. 24‚Äì25. On 1 September, he reported to 21 (Training) Squadron at Netheravon for elementary air instruction.Greenhous 2002, p. 38. The first aircraft he trained in was the Avro 504, flown by Roger Neville.McCaffery 1988, p. 26. Bishop was adept at taking aerial photographs, and was soon in charge of training other observers with the camera. The squadron was ordered to France in January 1916 and arrived at Boisdinghem airfield, near Saint-Omer, equipped with R.E.7 reconnaissance aircraft.McCaffery 1988, pp. 28‚Äì29. Bishop's first combat mission was as an aerial spotter for British artillery.McCaffery 1988, p. 29. At first, the aircraft could not get airborne until they had offloaded their bombload and machine guns.McCaffery 1988, pp. 31‚Äì32. Bishop and pilot Neville flew over German lines near Boisdinghem and when the German howitzer was found, they relayed coordinates to the British, who then bombarded and destroyed the target.McCaffery 1988, pp. 34‚Äì35. In the following months, Bishop flew on reconnaissance and bombing flights, but never fired his machine guns on an enemy aircraft.McCaffery 1988, p. 36. During one takeoff in April 1916, his aircraft engine failed, and he badly injured his knee.McCaffery 1988, p. 39. The injury was aggravated while on leave in London in May 1916, and Bishop was admitted to the hospital in Bryanston Square. While there he met and befriended socialite Lady St Helier, who was a friend to both Winston Churchill and Secretary for Air Lord Hugh Cecil.Greenhous 2002, p. 43. After Bishop's father suffered a small stroke, St Helier arranged for Bishop to recuperate in Canada,Greenhous 2002, p. 45. and he thereby missed the Battle of the Somme. Bishop returned to England in September 1916, and, with the influence of St Helier,Greenhous 2002, p. 46. was accepted for training as a pilot at the Central Flying School at Upavon on Salisbury Plain. His first solo flight was in a Maurice Farman \\"Shorthorn\\".McCaffery 1988, pp. 42‚Äì45. =Aerial combat= In November 1916 after receiving his wings, Bishop was attached to No. 37 Squadron RFC at Sutton's Farm, Essex flying the BE.2c. He was officially appointed to flying officer duties on 8 December 1916. Bishop disliked flying at night over London, searching for German airships, and he soon requested a transfer to France.McCaffery 1988, p. 46. Bishop and a Nieuport 17 fighter in Filescamp, 1917. On 17 March 1917, Bishop arrived at 60 Squadron at Filescamp Farm near Arras, where he flew the Nieuport 17 fighter.McCaffery 1988, pp. 47, 51. At that time, the average life expectancy of a new pilot in that sector was 11 days, and German aces were shooting down British aircraft 5 to 1.McCaffery 1988, p. 49. Bishop's first patrol on 22 March was less than successful. He had trouble controlling his run-down aircraft, was nearly shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and became separated from his group.McCaffery 1988, pp. 57‚Äì58. On 24 March, after crash-landing his aircraft during a practice flight in front of General John Higgins, Bishop was ordered to return to flight school at Upavon. Major Alan Scott, the new commander of 60 Squadron, convinced Higgins to let him stay until a replacement arrived.McCaffery 1988, pp. 60‚Äì61. The next day, Bishop claimed his first victory when his was one of four Nieuports that engaged three Albatros D.III Scouts near St Leger.McCaffery 1988, p. 64. Bishop shot down and mortally wounded a Lieutenant Theiller, but his engine failed in the process.Shores (1991) has 12-victory ace Theiller as being killed in battle against 70 Squadron Sopwiths on 24 March; therefore Bishop's claim does not match with known losses. Bishop landed in no man's land, from the German front line. After running to the Allied trenches, Bishop spent the night on the ground in a rainstorm.McCaffery 1988, p. 65. There Bishop wrote a letter home, starting, \\"I am writing this from a dugout 300 yards from our front line, after the most exciting adventure of my life.\\" General Higgins personally congratulated Bishop and rescinded his order to return to flight school.McCaffery 1988, p. 66. On 30 March 1917, Bishop was named a flight commanderMcCaffery 1988, p. 67. with a temporary promotion to captain a few days later. On 31 March, he scored his second victory.McCaffery 1988, p. 68. Bishop, in addition to the usual patrols with his squadron comrades, soon flew many unofficial \\"lone-wolf\\" missions deep into enemy territory, with the blessing of Major Scott. As a result, his total of enemy aircraft shot down increased rapidly. On 8 April, he scored his fifth victory and became an ace.McCaffery 1988, p. 79. To celebrate, Bishop's mechanic painted the aircraft's nose blue, the mark of an ace. Former 60 Squadron member Captain Albert Ball, at that time the Empire's highest scoring ace, had had a red spinner fitted.McCaffery 1988, p. 81. Bishop's no-holds-barred style of flying always had him \\"at the front of the pack,\\" leading his pilots into battle over hostile territory. Bishop soon realized that this could eventually see him shot down; after one patrol, a mechanic counted 210 bullet holes in his aircraft.McCaffery 1988, pp. 95‚Äì96. His new method of using the surprise attack proved successful; he claimed 12 aircraft in April alone, winning the Military Cross for his participation in the Battle of Vimy Ridge.McCaffery 1988, p. 96. The successes of Bishop and his blue-nosed aircraft were noticed by the Germans, and they began referring to him as \\"Hell's Handmaiden\\". Ernst Udet called him \\"the greatest English scouting ace\\" and one Jasta had a bounty on his head.McCaffery 1988, p. 102. On 30 April, Bishop survived an encounter with Jasta 11 and Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron.McCaffery 1988, pp. 104‚Äì106. In May, Bishop received the Distinguished Service Order for shooting down two aircraft while being attacked by four others. On 2 June 1917, Bishop flew a solo mission behind enemy lines to attack a German-held aerodrome, where he claimed that he shot down three aircraft that were taking off to attack him and destroyed several more on the ground. For this feat, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), although it has been suggested that he may have embellished his success. His VC (awarded 30 August 1917) was one of two awarded in violation of the warrant requiring witnesses (the other being the Unknown Soldier),Greenhous 2002, p. 13. and since the German records have been lost and the archived papers relating to the VC were lost as well, there is no way of confirming whether there were any witnesses. It seems to have been common practice at this time to allow Bishop to claim victories without requiring confirmation or verification from other witnesses.Shores et al. 1991, p. 76. Bishop in the cockpit of his Nieuport 17, c. August 1917. During this period, Bishop became the highest scoring flying ace in the Royal Flying Corp. In July, 60 Squadron received new Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, a faster and more powerful aircraft with better pilot visibility. In August 1917, Bishop passed the late Albert Ball in victories to become (temporarily) the highest scoring ace in the RFC and the third top ace of the war, behind only the Red Baron and Ren√© Fonck.McCaffery 1960, p. 143. At the end of August 1917, Bishop was appointed as the Chief Instructor at the School of Aerial Gunnery and given the temporary rank of major. =Leave to Canada= Bishop returned home on leave to Canada in fall 1917, where he was acclaimed a hero and helped boost the morale of the Canadian public, who were growing tired of the war.McCaffery 1960, p. 155. On 17 October 1917, Bishop married his longtime fianc√©e, Margaret Eaton Burden. After the wedding, he was assigned to the British War Mission in Washington, D.C. to help the Americans build an air force. While stationed there, he wrote his autobiography entitled Winged Warfare.McDonnell, Capt. Darach \\"The Flying Career of William Avery Bishop.\\" gwpda.org, 23 April 2006. Retrieved 10 November 2009. =Return to Europe= Upon his return to England in April 1918, Bishop was promoted to Major and given command of No. 85 Squadron, the \\"Flying Foxes\\".McCaffery 1960, p. 167. This was a newly formed squadron and Bishop was given the freedom to choose many of the pilots. The squadron was equipped with SE5a scout planes and left for Petit Synthe, France on 22 May 1918.McCaffery 1960, pp. 178‚Äì179. On 27 May, after familiarizing himself with the area and the opposition, Bishop took a solo flight to the Front. He downed a German observation plane in his first combat since August 1917,McCaffery 1960, p. 184. and followed with two more the next day.McCaffery 1960, p. 185. From 30 May to 1 June Bishop downed six more aircraft, including German ace Paul Billik, bringing his score to 59 and reclaiming his top scoring ace title from James McCudden, who had claimed it while Bishop was in Canada, and he was now the leading Allied ace.McCaffery 1960, p. 186. The Government of Canada was becoming increasingly worried about the effect on morale if Bishop were to be killed, so on 18 June he was ordered to return to England to help organize the new Canadian Flying Corps.McCaffery 1960, p. 192. Bishop was not pleased with the order coming so soon after his return to France. He wrote to his wife: \\"This is ever so annoying.\\"McCaffery 1960, p. 191. The order specified that he was to leave France by noon on 19 June. On that morning, Bishop decided to fly one last solo patrol. In just 15 minutes of combat, he added another five victories to his total. He claimed to have downed two Pfalz D.IIIa scout planes, caused another two to collide with each other, and shot down a German reconnaissance aircraft.McCaffery 1960, pp. 194‚Äì195. On 5 August, Bishop was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and was given the post of \\"Officer Commanding-designate of the Canadian Air Force Section of the General Staff, Headquarters Overseas Military Forces of Canada.\\" He was on board a ship returning from a reporting visit to Canada when news of the armistice arrived. Bishop was discharged from the Canadian Expeditionary Force on 31 December and returned to Canada. By the end of the war, he had claimed some 72 air victories, including two balloons, 52 and two shared \\"destroyed\\" with 16 \\"out of control\\".Shores et al. 1991, pp. 77‚Äì78. Historians including Hugh Halliday and Brereton Greenhous (both of whom were official historians for the Royal Canadian Air Force) suggested that the actual total was far lower. Brereton Greenhous felt the actual total of enemy aircraft destroyed was only 27.Halliday, Hugh Valour Reconsidered: Inquiries into The Victoria Cross, p.145 Post-war career After the war, Bishop toured the principal cities in the United States and lectured on aerial warfare. He established an importing firm, Interallied Aircraft Corporation,Special, \\"Court Decision May Bar British Planes From U. S.\\", Chicago Daily Tribune, Saturday 10 July 1920, Volume LXXIX, Number 165, page 1. and a short-lived passenger air service with fellow ace William Barker, but after legal and financial problems, and a serious crash, the partnership and company were dissolved. In 1921, Bishop and his family moved to Britain, where he had various business interests connected with flying. In 1928, he was the guest of honour at a gathering of German air aces in Berlin and was made an Honorary Member of the Association. In 1929 he became chairman of British Air Lines. However, the family's wealth was wiped out in the crash of 1929 and they had to move back to Canada, where he became vice-president of the McColl-Frontenac Oil Company. =Second World War= Bishop in uniform as an Air Marshal, 1942. He was promoted to the position shortly after the outbreak of World War II. In January 1936, Bishop was appointed the first Canadian air vice-marshal. Shortly after the outbreak of war in 1939, he was promoted to the rank of Air marshal in the Royal Canadian Air Force. He served during the war as Director of the Royal Canadian Air Force and was placed in charge of recruitment. He was so successful in this role that many applicants had to be turned away.\\"Who's Who: William Bishop.\\" firstworldwar.com. Retrieved 7 September 2008. Bishop created a system for training pilots across Canada and became instrumental in setting up and promoting the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, which trained over 167,000 airmen in Canada during the Second World War. In 1942, he appeared as himself in the film Captains of the Clouds, a Hollywood tribute to the RCAF.IMdb listing Captains of the Clouds By 1944 the stress of the war had taken a serious toll on Bishop's health, and he resigned his post in the RCAF to return to private enterprise in Montreal, Quebec, before retiring in 1952. His son later commented that he looked 70 years old on his 50th birthday in 1944. However, Bishop remained active in the aviation world, predicting the phenomenal growth of commercial aviation postwar. His efforts to bring some organization to the nascent field led to the formation of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal. He wrote a second book at this time, Winged Peace, advocating international control of global air power.Bashow, Lieutenant-Colonel David. \\"The Incomparable Billy Bishop: The Man and the Myths.\\" billybishop.net, 14 February 2006. Retrieved 14 October 2011. With the outbreak of the Korean War, Bishop again offered to return to his recruitment role, but he was in poor health and was politely refused by the RCAF. He died in his sleep on 11 September 1956, at the age of 62, while wintering in Palm Beach, Florida. His funeral service was held with full Air Force Honours in Toronto, Ontario. The body was cremated and the ashes interred in the family plot in Greenwood Cemetery, Owen Sound, Ontario. A memorial service for Air Marshal Bishop was held in St Paul's Church, Bristol, England, on 19 September 1956. Family On 17 October 1917, at Timothy Eaton Memorial Church in Toronto he married Margaret Eaton Burden, his longtime fianc√©e and daughter of Mr C. E.

In 1967, Bishop was inducted into the International Air & Space Hall of Fame.Sprekelmeyer, Linda, editor. These We Honor: The International Aerospace Hall of Fame. Donning Co. Publishers, 2006. . An award is also named in honour of Bishop. The Air Force Association of Canada approved the establishment of a trophy to commemorate the late Air Marshal W.A. Bishop, VC, in recognition of his \\"outstanding contribution to the legacy of excellence in Canadian aviation\\". The home Bishop grew up in was later re-purposed into the Billy Bishop Home and Museum. Billy Bishop's childhood home was re-purposed into the Billy Bishop Home and Museum in 1987. The museum is located in Owen Sound, Ontario. The museum has exhibits on the family, Bishop himself and veterans. There is a permanent exhibit with information on Bishop at the Grey Roots Museum and Archives, just south of Owen Sound. Bishop's life has also been the subject of a number of works in media.

It also led indirectly to a 1983 CBC Television documentary called The Kid Who Couldn't Miss, produced by the National Film Board of Canada.\\"The Kid Who Couldn't Miss.\\" NFB.ca. Retrieved: 14 October 2011. The show, a \\"docudrama\\" combining known history for credibility with fictitious \\"mock interviews\\" with actors portraying Bishop and others, suggested that Bishop faked his famous attack on the German aerodrome.McCaffery 1960, p. 196. In one particularly contentious scene, his mechanic claims that the damage to his fighter was confined to a small circle in a non-critical area, implying that Bishop had landed his aircraft off-field, shot holes in it, and flown home with claims of combat damage. In reality, his mechanic was his biggest supporter, and the scene was entirely fictitious. The mechanic insisted that Bishop had not fabricated the damage. Canadian authors Dan McCaffery and David Bashow also presented circumstantial evidence that Bishop did not fake the attack. After years of controversy over Bishop's record, mainly because very few of his claimed victories were witnessed by anyone else or could be confirmed from the few surviving German records, the show led to an inquiry by the Canadian government in 1985. The Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology discredited the documentary, saying it was an unfair and inaccurate portrayal of Bishop. There is some dispute about whether Bishop or Mick Mannock had the highest score of any British Empire First World War fighter ace. The Canadian Encyclopedia states: \\"Investigation by a Senate sub- committee exposed a number of minor errors in this apparent 'documentary' and confirmed that statements had been wrongly attributed and incidents shifted in time for dramatic effect. However, the senators were unable to demonstrate that Bishop's claims were valid, and consequently recommended only that the film be labelled as docu-drama\\". Some of Bishop's other claims have also been challenged. While combat reports and claims of both sides are littered with well-intentioned errors and accidental duplicate claims, there are two phases of Bishop's life in which German records can provide no supporting evidence. In his book on Victoria Cross airmen of the First World War, author Alex Revell quotes aviation historian Philip Markham's view about German records of the events of 2 June 1917 (the day of Bishop's VC award): \\"Not a shred of evidence to support Bishop's claims.\\" Referring to Bishop's claims in early to mid-1918, Revell says another aviation historian, Ed Ferko, carried out extensive research on Germans records in 1987. Revell says that Ferko failed \\"to match a single victory claim made by Bishop against a known German loss for the day, time or place in question.\\" However, distinguished First World War aviation historian Peter Kilduff says in his biography (Billy Bishop VC: Lone Wolf Hunter) that Bishop may have had as many as 21 matches in piecemeal German records. Kilduff also makes a case for the unreliability of German records. He cites examples in which masses of data were destroyed by retreating German forces and instances of the German former air ministry having been guilty of \\"obfuscation\\" in denying losses when casualties had been incurred.Kilduff 2014, pp. 6, 7, 8.

This family comprises about 2850 known species in about 45 genera worldwide (Christenhusz & Byng 2016 ). They are dicotyledons, and occur mainly in warm temperate and tropical regions, especially Southeast Asia and South America. Many are aromatic evergreen trees or shrubs, but some, such as Sassafras, are deciduous, or include both deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs, especially in tropical and temperate climates. The genus Cassytha is unique in the Lauraceae in that its members are parasitic vines. Overview The family has a worldwide distribution in tropical and warm climates. The Lauraceae are important components of tropical forests ranging from low-lying to montane. In several forested regions, Lauraceae are among the top five families in terms of the number of species present. The Lauraceae give their name to habitats known as laurel forests, which have many trees that superficially resemble the Lauraceae, though they may belong to other plant families such as Magnoliaceae or Myrtaceae. Laurel forests of various types occur on most continents and on many major islands. Although the taxonomy of the Lauraceae is still not settled, conservative estimates suggest some 52 genera worldwide, including 3,000 to 3,500 species. Compared to other plant families, the taxonomy of Lauraceae still is poorly understood. This is partly due to its great diversity, the difficulty of identifying the species, and partly because of inadequate investment in taxonomic work. Recent monographs on small and medium-sized genera of Lauraceae (up to about 100 species) have revealed many new species. Similar increases in the numbers of species recognised in other larger genera are to be expected. Description Most of the Lauraceae are evergreen trees in habit. Exceptions include some two dozen species of Cassytha, all of which are obligately parasitic vines. The fruits of Lauraceae are drupes, one-seeded fleshy fruit with a hard layer, the endocarp, surrounding the seed. However, the endocarp is very thin, so the fruit resemble a one-seeded berry. The fruit in some species (particularly in the genera Ocotea and Oreodaphne) are partly immersed or covered in a cup-shaped or deep thick cupule, which is formed from the tube of the calyx where the peduncle joins the fruit; this gives the fruit an appearance similar to an acorn. In some Lindera species, the fruit have a hypocarpium at the base of the fruit. Distribution and uses Because the family is so ancient and was so widely distributed on the Gondwana supercontinent, modern species commonly occur in relict populations isolated by geographical barriers, for instance on islands or tropical mountains. Relict forests retain endemic fauna and flora in communities of great value in inferring the palaeontological succession and climate change that followed the breakups of the supercontinents. *Many Lauraceae contain high concentrations of essential oils, some of which are valued for spices and perfumes. Within the plants, most such substances are components of irritant or toxic sap or tissues that repel or poison many herbivorous or parasitic organisms. *Some of the essential oils are valued as fragrances, such as in the traditional laurel wreath of classical antiquity, or in cabinet making, where the fragrant woods are prized for making insect- repellant furniture chests. *Some are valued in cooking, for example, bay leaves are a popular ingredient in European, American, and Asian cuisines. *Avocados are important oil-rich fruit that are cultivated in warm climates around the world. *Many species are exploited for timber. *Some species are valued as sources of medicinal material. These genera include some of the best-known species of particular commercial value: *Cinnamomum: cinnamon, cassia and camphor laurel *Laurus: bay laurel *Persea: avocado Loss of habitat and overexploitation for such products has put many species in danger of extinction as a result of overcutting, extensive illegal logging, and habitat conversion. Conversely, some species, though commercially valuable in some countries, are regarded as aggressive invaders in other regions. For example, Cinnamomum camphora, though a valued ornamental and medicinal plant, is so invasive as to have been declared a weed in subtropical forested areas of South Africa.Henderson, L. \\"Alien weeds and Invasive Plants\\" Agricultural Research Council, Agricultural Research Council, Pretoria South Africa, Ecology Lindera melissifolia: This endangered species is native to the southeastern United States, and its demise is associated with habitat loss from extensive drainage of wetlands for agriculture and forestry.US Fish and Wildlife Service: Species Recovery Plan: Lindera melissifolia. Lauraceae flowers are protogynous, often with a complex flowering system to prevent inbreeding. The fruits are an important food source for birds, on which some Palaeognathae are highly dependent. Other birds that rely heavily on the fruit for their diets include members of the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Ramphastidae, amongst others. Birds that are specialised frugivores tend to eat the whole fruit and regurgitate seeds intact, thereby releasing the seeds in favourable situations for germination (ornithochory). Some other birds that swallow the fruit pass the seed intact through their guts. Seed dispersal of various species in the family is also carried out by monkeys, arboreal rodents, porcupines, opossums, and fishes. Hydrochory occurs in Caryodaphnopsis. The leaves of some species in the Lauraceae have domatia in the axils of their veins. The domatia are home to certain mites. Other lauraceous species, members of the genus Pleurothyrium in particular, have a symbiotic relationship with ants that protect and defend the tree. Some Ocotea species are also used as nesting sites by ants, which may live in leaf pockets or in hollowed-out stems. Defense mechanisms that occur among members of the Lauraceae include irritant or toxic sap or tissues that repel or poison many herbivorous organisms. Trees of the family predominate in the world's laurel forests and cloud forests, which occur in tropical to mild temperate regions of both northern and southern hemispheres. Other members of the family however, occur pantropically in general lowland and Afromontane forest, and in Africa for example there are species endemic to countries such as Cameroon, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Congo. Several relict species in the Lauraceae occur in temperate areas of both hemispheres. Many botanical species in other families have similar foliage to the Lauraceae due to convergent evolution, and forests of such plants are called laurel forest. These plants are adapted to high rainfall and humidity, and have leaves with a generous layer of wax, making them glossy in appearance, and a narrow, pointed-oval shape with a 'drip tip', which permits the leaves to shed water despite the humidity, allowing transpiration to continue. Scientific names similar to Daphne (e.g., Daphnidium, Daphniphyllum)Sunset Western Garden Book, 1995:606‚Äì607 or \\"laurel\\" (e.g.,Laureliopsis, Skimmia laureola) indicate other plant families that resemble Lauraceae. Some Lauraceae species have adapted to demanding conditions in semiarid climates, but they tend to depend on favorable edaphic conditions, for example, perennial aquifers, periodic groundwater flows, or periodically flooded forests in sand that contains hardly any nutrients. Various species have adapted to swampy conditions by growing pneumatophores, roots that grow upward, that project above the levels of periodic floods that drown competing plants which lack such adaptations. Paleobotanists have suggested the family originated some 174¬±32 million years ago (Mya), while othersLi et al.2004 do not believe they are older than the mid-Cretaceous. Fossil flowers attributed to this family occur in Cenomanian clays (mid-Cretaceous, 90-98 Mya) of the Eastern United States (Mauldinia mirabilis). Fossils of Lauraceae are common in the Tertiary strata of Europe and North America, but they virtually disappeared from central Europe in the Late Miocene. Because of their unusual fragility, the pollens of Lauraceae do not keep well and have been found only in relatively recent strata. Deciduous Lauraceae lose all of their leaves for part of the year depending on variations in rainfall. The leaf loss coincides with the dry season in tropical, subtropical, and arid regions. Laurel wilt disease, caused by the virulent fungal pathogen Raffaelea lauricola, a native of southern Asia, was found in the southeast United States in 2002. The fungus spreads between hosts via a wood-boring beetle, Xyleborus glabratus, with which it has a symbiotic relationship. Several Lauraceae species are affected. The beetle and disease are believed to have arrived in the US via infected solid wood packing material, and have since spread to several states. http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/00000000/opmp/Redbay%20Laurel%20Wilt%20Recovery%20Plan%20January%202015.pdf Classification Ocotea obtusata with unripe fruit with an appearance similar to an acorn Cassytha filiformis fruits Classification within the Lauraceae is not fully resolved. Multiple classification schemes based on a variety of morphological and anatomical characteristics have been proposed, but none are fully accepted. According to Judd et al. (2007), the suprageneric classification proposed by van der Werff and Richter (1996) is currently the authority. However, due to an array of molecular and embryological evidence that disagrees with the groupings, it is not fully accepted by the scientific community. Their classification is based on inflorescence structure and wood and bark anatomy. It divides Lauraceae into two subfamilies, Cassythoideae and Lauroideae. The Cassythoideae comprise a single genus, Cassytha, and are defined by their herbaceous, parasitic habit. The Lauroideae are then divided into three tribes: Laureae, Perseeae, and Cryptocaryeae. The subfamily Cassythoideae is not fully supported. Backing has come from matK sequences of chloroplast genes while a questionable placement of Cassytha has been concluded from analysis of intergenetic spacers of chloroplast and nuclear genomes. Embryological studies also appear contradictory. One study by Heo et al. (1998) supports the subfamily. It found that Cassytha develops an ab initio cellular-type endosperm and the rest of the family (with one exception) develops a nuclear-type endosperm. Kimoto et al. (2006) suggest Cassytha should be placed in the tribe Cryptocaryeae because it shares a glandular anther tapetum and an embryo sac protruding from the nucellus with other members of the Cryptocaryeae. The tribes Laureae and Perseeae are not well supported by any molecular or embryological studies. Sequences of the matK chloroplast gene, as well as sequences of chloroplast and nuclear genomes, reveal close relationships between the two tribes. Embryological evidence does not support a clear division between the two tribes, either. Genera such as Caryodaphnopsis and Aspidostemon that share embryological characteristics with one tribe and wood and bark characteristics or inflorescence characteristics with another tribe blur the division of these groups. All available evidence, except for inflorescence morphology and wood and bark anatomy, fails to support separate tribes Laureae and Perseeae. The tribe Cryptocaryeae is partially supported by molecular and embryological studies. Chloroplast and nuclear genomes support a tribal grouping that contains all the genera circumscribed by van der Weff and Richter (1996), as well as three additional genera. Partial support for the tribe is also attained from the matK sequences of chloroplast genes as well as embryology. Challenges in Lauraceae classification The knowledge of the species comprising the Lauraceae is incomplete. In 1991, about 25-30% of neotropical Lauraceae species had not been described. In 2001, embryological studies had only been completed on individuals from 26 genera yielding a 38.9% level of knowledge, in terms of embryology, for this family. Additionally, the huge amount of variation within the family poses a major challenge for developing a reliable classification. Phytochemistry The adaptation of Lauraceae to new environments has followed a long evolutionary journey which has led to many specializations, including defensive or deterrent systems against other organisms. Phytochemicals in the Lauraceae are numerous and diverse. Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids include aporphines and oxoaporphines, as well as derivatives of morphinans. Essential oils include terpenoids, benzyl benzoates, allylphenols, and propenylphenols. Lignans and neolignans are present, along with S-methyl-5-O-flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, cinnamoylamides, phenylpyrroles, styryl pyrones, polyketides (acetogenins), furanosesquiterpenes, and germacranolidous, heliangolidous, eudesmanolidous and guaianolidous sesquiterpene lactones. Genera Recent taxonomic revisions of the family include these genera: These genera have traditionally been considered separate within Lauraceae, but have not been included in the most recent treatments: References Further reading * Lauraceae in L.

She was named for Oliver Hazard Perry, an American naval hero who was victorious at the 1813 Battle of Lake Erie. Oliver Hazard Perry (FFG-7) was the first ship and, as of 2019, the only ship of the U.S. Navy to bear the name (although there were five previous US Navy ships named for Oliver Hazard Perry - four named USS Perry and one named USS Commodore Perry). Oliver Hazard Perry was in service from 1977 to 1997 and was scrapped in 2005. The class was originally intended as austere \\"low\\" category guided missile frigates (compared with the high capability ) for General Purpose and Anti-Air convoy escort. They were built under a cloud of controversy, with their very light gun armament and lack of redundancy and duplicated systems in event of ship being hit. They were regarded by the Reagan administration and Secretary John Lehman as not part of the 500 ship navy plan, but ultimately proved useful as anti-submarine ships if fitted to carry Seahawks and towed arrays and into the 21st Century as low grade patrol ships making up the numbers in a USN desperately short of escorts.  History  Oliver Hazard Perry was ordered from Bath Iron Works on 30 October 1973 as part of the FY73 program, and was laid down on 12 June 1975, launched on 25 September 1976, and commissioned on 17 December 1977. She was ordered as PFG-109 but was redesignated as FFG-7 in the 1975 fleet designation realignment on 1 June 1975, before she was laid down. = Launch incident = During her launch ceremony on 25 September 1976, the ship found herself briefly stuck on the slip-way. Film star John Wayne appeared from the crowd of watching dignitaries, climbed the launch ceremony platform, and gave the bow of the frigate ‚Äì which was by this time starting to move slightly ‚Äì a shove with one hand, and so John Wayne famously appeared to have 'pushed' a US warship down her slip-way.All Star Party for John Wayne (1976)- Charles Bronson honors John Wayne!, YouTube (beginning 42 seconds into the clip) = Shock Trial Testing = Oliver Hazard Perry was one of the few lead ships to be subjected to shock trials. These series of trials conducted early in the life of the ship put this steel hull / aluminum superstructure to the test. The proximity of the tests (seen in associated pictures), caused many of the machine mounts and components to become warped or damaged. This damage created alignment problems for the engineering and combat systems teams in the years to come. The ship regularly required waivers on machine performance due to the warping of many mounting brackets. The shock tests also created cracks in the aluminum superstructure that required frequent repairs. However, this did not affect the overall readiness of the ship, nor did it prevent Oliver Hazard Perry from achieving the record for the most-ever hours put on the GE LM2500 Main Propulsion engine.US Navy OPPE Results, 1984 to 1989, US Navy archives = Fate = After 19.2 years of active service, Oliver Hazard Perry was decommissioned on 20 February 1997, in Mayport, FL under the last Commanding Officer, CDR Robert F. Holman, USNR. Though she was stricken on 3 May 1999, Oliver Hazard Perry was held in the museum donation category at the former Navy shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A group had hoped to bring her to Toledo, Ohio as a museum ship and a memorial for the Battle of Lake Erie. The group was unable submit a viable financial plan together in time so the Perry was sold for scrap in December 2005.

McInerney (1899‚Äì1956). Ordered from Bath Iron Works on 27 February 1976 as part of the FY75 program, McInerney was laid down on 16 January 1978, launched on 4 November 1978, and commissioned on 15 December 1979. McInerney remained in service until 31 August 2010, when the ship was decommissioned and transferred to the Pakistan Navy. After a major overhaul and refurbishment, the ship was renamed Alamgir (F260), and entered service in early 2011. US Navy career =1980s= McInerneys mission was to provide multi-threat protection for military and merchant shipping, amphibious task forces and underway replenishment groups. During her first two years of service, McInerney was the U.S. Navy test platform for the LAMPS MK- III (SH-60B helicopter) anti-submarine warfare system and the Recovery Assist, Secure, and Traverse (RAST) system. To be able to accommodate the SH-60B, McInerney was the first Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate to receive a lengthened stern. Her efforts during this period earned her a Meritorious Unit Commendation. In 1981, McInerney appears to have been part of Destroyer Squadron 8. McInerneys first major deployment to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean began in November 1982. During this deployment she embarked a LAMPS Mk-I (SH-2 Seasprite) helicopter detachment. McInerney made brief port visits to Tangiers, Morocco, and Catania, Sicily and supported the Multi- National Force in Beirut, Lebanon (earning her the Navy Expeditionary Medal). After transiting the Suez Canal, McInerney operated in the Indian Ocean and made port calls to Karachi, Pakistan, Columbo, Sri Lanka, and Mombasa, Kenya. She also crossed the equator en route to Diego Garcia. Following this deployment, McInerney operated in the Caribbean and visited Port Limon, Costa Rica and Tela, Honduras. She received the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Citation with the Operational Distinguishing Device, for her efforts in law enforcement during this period. In October 1984, McInerney deployed again to the Middle East in the midst of the Iran/Iraq Tanker War. She had been fitted with the Phalanx CIWS and also carried a LAMPS Mk-I (SH-2 Seasprite) helicopter detachment. During this deployment she visited ports in Djibouti, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Pakistan, and Palma, Spain. McInerney returned from this cruise in March 1985, and conducted law enforcement operations and other fleet exercises. In May 1986, USS McInerney began a 10-month-long overhaul (extended Selected Restricted Availability) in Boston, MA. During this yard period she received the AN/SQQ-89(V)2 Anti- Submarine Warfare Suite, fin stabilizers, and the Single Audio System. The RAST equipment was also reinstalled and made operational. In August 1988, McInerney was underway for her third deployment‚Äî this one to the Mediterranean. This deployment was highlighted by McInerney being awarded the COMSIXTHFLT \\"Hook 'Em\\" Award for excellence in Anti-Submarine Warfare and a Meritorious Unit Commendation. On the morning of 21 December, McInerney received a distress call from the cement tanker Jenneastar, southwest of Sardinia, Italy. The crew had abandoned the ship when she began to list 25 degrees to port and started taking on water in bad weather. Ten Polish crewman and two Ghanaian stowaways were rescued and transported to Naples, Italy. McInerney returned from the Mediterranean in February 1989, and departed for the Northern Atlantic in the spring of 1989. Anti-Submarine Warfare operations led McInerney above the Arctic Circle, and McInerney returned to Mayport in May 1989. =1990s= McInerney deployed to the Middle East in January 1991 and was awarded her second \\"Hook 'Em\\" Award after a brief ASW operation in the Mediterranean Sea. McInerney then entered the Persian Gulf in support of coalition forces against Iraq. McInerney performed in every warfare area during the conflict, including convoy escort, mine warfare, anti-air and anti- surface operations. McInerney earned the Navy Unit Commendation, the Combat Action Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, the Southwest Asia Service Medal with Bronze Star, the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia) and the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait) for her wartime service. The ship returned from the Middle East in July 1991 after escorting more than 50 merchant vessels through the mine-swept waters to Kuwait ports. Her continued, proven prowess earned her the Battle \\"E\\" for efficiency, and the COMNAVSURFLANT ASW Award, designating her as the top AN/SQQ-89-configured ASW platform on the East Coast. McInerneys humanitarian efforts, throughout her career, include assisting the tug Taurus in the Jacksonville Operating Area, transferring a wounded merchant seaman during the Tanker War, rescuing sailors from the sinking motor vessel Jenneastar in the Mediterranean and escorting merchant ships carrying needed supplies to the ports of Kuwait through mine-swept channels in the aftermath of Operation Desert Storm. In 1999, McInerney participated in the UNITAS 40‚Äì99 deployment to South America UNITAS along with . =2000s= McInerney completed a highly successful SOUTHCOM Counter-Drug Operations Deployment in November 2003.

Garfield on July 2, 1881. Guiteau falsely believed he had played a major role in Garfield's victory, for which he should be rewarded with a consulship. He was so offended by the Garfield administration's rejections of his applications to serve in Vienna or Paris that he decided to kill Garfield, and shot him at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington, D.C. Garfield died two months later from infections related to the wounds. In January 1882, Guiteau was sentenced to death for the crime, and was hanged five months later. Executed two days short of the anniversary of his crime, Guiteau remains by far the longest-lived presidential assassin in US history, and the only one put to death under federal law. Early life and education Guiteau was born in Freeport, Illinois, the fourth of six children of Jane August (n√©e Howe) and Luther Wilson Guiteau, whose family was of French Huguenot ancestry. He moved with his family to Ulao, Wisconsin (near current-day Grafton), in 1850 and lived there until 1855, when his mother died. Soon after, Guiteau and his father moved back to Freeport. He inherited $1,000 ($ today) from his grandfather as a young man and went to Ann Arbor, Michigan, to attend the University of Michigan. Due to inadequate academic preparation, he failed the entrance examinations. Despite cramming in French and algebra at Ann Arbor High School, during which time he received numerous letters from his father concerning his progress, he quit, and in June 1860 joined the utopian religious sect the Oneida Community, in Oneida, New York, with which Guiteau's father already had close affiliations. According to Brian Resnick of The Atlantic, Guiteau \\"worshiped\\" the group's founder, John Humphrey Noyes, once writing that he had \\"perfect, entire and absolute confidence in him in all things\\". Despite the \\"group marriage\\" aspects of that sect, he was generally rejected during his five years there, and his name was turned into a play on words to create the nickname \\"Charles Gitout\\". He left the community twice. After leaving the first time, he went to Hoboken, New Jersey, and attempted to start a newspaper based on the Oneida religion called The Daily Theocrat. This failed and he returned to Oneida, only to leave again and file lawsuits against Noyes. Guiteau's father, embarrassed, wrote letters in support of Noyes, who had considered Guiteau irresponsible and insane. Career Guiteau worked as a clerk at a Chicago law firm and passed a cursory examination to attain admission to the bar. He was not successful as a lawyer, arguing only one case in court, and the bulk of his business was in bill collecting. In 1869 he met and married librarian Annie Bunn. She later detailed his dishonest dealings, describing how he would keep disproportionate amounts from his collections and rarely give the money to his clients. In 1872, Guiteau and his wife moved to New York City one step ahead of bill collectors and dissatisfied clients. Guiteau took an interest in politics and identified with the Democratic Party. He supported Horace Greeley, the Liberal Republican and Democratic candidate for president against incumbent Republican Ulysses S. Grant. Guiteau prepared a disorganized speech in support of Greeley, which he delivered once. Greeley was badly defeated, but during the campaign Guiteau became convinced that if Greeley won, he would appoint Guiteau as Minister to Chile. Guiteau was physically abusive with his wife; when she wanted a divorce in 1874, he obliged by having sex with a prostitute who then testified to his infidelity. He next turned to theology. He published a book on the subject called The Truth which was almost entirely plagiarized from the work of Noyes. By 1875, Guiteau's father was convinced that his son was possessed by Satan. Conversely, Guiteau himself became increasingly convinced that his actions were divinely inspired, and that his destiny was to \\"preach a new Gospel\\" like Paul the Apostle. He wandered from town to town lecturing to any and all who would listen to his religious ramblings, and in December 1877 gave a lecture at the Congregational Church in Washington, D.C. Guiteau spent the first half of 1880 in Boston, which he left owing money and under suspicion of theft. On June 11, 1880, he was a passenger on the SS Stonington when it collided with the SS Narragansett at night in heavy fog. The Stonington was able to return to port, but the Narragansett burned to the waterline and sank, with significant loss of life. Although none of his fellow passengers on the Stonington were injured, the incident left Guiteau believing that he had been spared for a higher purpose. Guiteau's interest then turned again to politics. During the 1880 presidential campaign, the Republican Party was largely split into factions ‚Äì the Stalwarts, led by Roscoe Conkling, who supported Ulysses S. Grant for a third term, and the Half-Breeds, who supported James G. Blaine. Guiteau decided to support the Stalwarts and wrote a speech in support of Ulysses S. Grant called \\"Grant against Hancock\\", which he revised to \\"Garfield against Hancock\\" after Garfield (not affiliated with either faction) won the Republican nomination. Ultimately, Guiteau changed little more than the title and any mention of Grant in the speech itself. The speech was delivered at most twice, and printed copies were passed out to members of the Republican National Committee at their summer 1880 meeting in New York, but Guiteau believed himself to be largely responsible for Garfield's victory over Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock that November. He insisted he should be awarded a consulship for his supposedly vital assistance, first asking for Vienna, then deciding that he would rather have the one in Paris. Guiteau's personal requests to Garfield and his cabinet as one of many job seekers who lined up every day to see them in person were continually rejected, as were his numerous letters. By the early days of Garfield's administration, which commenced in March 1881, Guiteau was living in Washington, D.C., destitute and forced to sneak from rooming house to rooming house without paying for his lodging and meals, and to walk around the cold, snowy city in a threadbare suit, without a coat, hat or boots. He spent his days in hotel lobbies reading discarded newspapers to keep track of the schedules of Garfield and his cabinet and making use of the hotels' complimentary stationery to write them letters pressing his claim for a consulship. In the spring, he was still in Washington, and on May 14, 1881, he once more encountered Secretary of State James G. Blaine in person and inquired about a consular appointment; an exasperated Blaine finally snapped \\"Never speak to me again on the Paris consulship as long as you live!\\" President James A. Garfield with Secretary of State James G. Blaine after being shot by Guiteau, as depicted in a period engraving from Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper.\\"The attack on the President's life\\". Library of Congress. =Assassination of Garfield= Guiteau considered himself a loyal Republican and a Stalwart, and his narcissistic personality convinced him that his work for the party was critical to Garfield's election to the presidency. Later convinced that Garfield was going to destroy the Republican Party by scrapping the patronage system, and distraught after his final encounter with Blaine, he decided the only solution was to remove Garfield and elevate Vice President Chester A. Arthur, an acolyte of Senator Roscoe Conkling, the Stalwart leader who managed Grant's 1880 campaign and was not on friendly terms with Garfield. Guiteau felt that God told him to kill the president; he felt that such an act would be a \\"removal\\" as opposed to an assassination. He also felt that Garfield needed to be killed to rid the Republican Party of Blaine's influence. Borrowing $15 from George Maynard, a relative by marriage, Guiteau set out to purchase a revolver. He knew little about firearms, but believed he would need a large-caliber gun. While shopping at O'Meara's store in Washington, he had to choose between a .442 Webley caliber British Bulldog revolver with wooden grips or one with ivory grips. He preferred the one with the ivory handle because he thought it would look better as a museum exhibit after the assassination. Though he could not afford the extra dollar for the ivory grips, the store owner dropped the price for him. He spent the next few weeks in target practice ‚Äì the recoil from the revolver almost knocked him over the first time he fired it. Guiteau's pistol was recovered after the assassination, and even photographed by the Smithsonian in the early 20th century, but it has since been lost. On one occasion, Guiteau trailed Garfield to the railway station as the President was seeing his wife off to a beach resort in Long Branch, New Jersey, but he decided to postpone his plan because Garfield's wife Lucretia was in poor health and Guiteau did not want to upset her. Having been alerted to the president's schedule by a newspaper article, on July 2, 1881, he lay in wait for Garfield at the since-demolished Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station, getting his shoes shined, pacing, and engaging a cab to take him to the station later. As Garfield entered the station, looking forward to a vacation with his wife in Long Branch, Guiteau stepped forward and shot Garfield twice from behind, the second shot piercing the first lumbar vertebra but missing the spinal cord. As he surrendered to authorities, Guiteau said: \\"I am a Stalwart of the Stalwarts. ... [Chester A.] Arthur is president now!\\"Staff (July 3, 1881) New York Herald Path of the Bullet that wounded President Garfield After a long, painful battle with infections, possibly brought on by his doctors' poking and probing the wound with unwashed hands and non-sterilized instruments, Garfield died on September 19, eleven weeks after being shot. Most modern physicians familiar with the case state that Garfield would have easily recovered from his wounds with sterile medical care, which was common in the United States a decade later,Schaffer, Amanda (July 25, 2006) \\"A President Felled by an Assassin and 1880s Medical Care\\" The New York Times while Candice Millard argues that Garfield would have survived Guiteau's bullet wound had his doctors simply left him alone. However, Garfield's biographer Allan Peskin stated that medical malpractice did not contribute to Garfield's death; the inevitable infection and blood poisoning that would ensue from a deep bullet wound resulted in damage to multiple organs and spinal bone fragmentation.Peskin (1978), p. 607. 1881 political cartoon showing Guiteau holding a gun and a note that says \\"An office or your life!\\" The caption for the cartoon reads \\"Model Office Seeker\\". =Trial and execution= Once Garfield died, the government officially charged Guiteau with murder. He was formally indicted on October 14, 1881, on the charge of murder, which was previously attempted murder after his arrest. Guiteau pleaded not guilty to the charge. The trial began on November 17, 1881, in Washington, D.C. The presiding judge in the case was Walter Smith Cox. Although Guiteau would insist on trying to represent himself during the entire trial, the court appointed Leigh Robinson to defend Guiteau. In less than a week of trial, Robinson retired from the case. George Scoville then became lead counsel for the defense. While Scoville's legal experience lay in land title examination, he had married Guiteau's sister and was thus obliged to defend him in court when no one else would. Wayne MacVeagh, the U.S. Attorney General, served as the chief prosecutor. MacVeagh named five lawyers to the prosecution team: George Corkhill, Walter Davidge, retired judge John K. Porter, Elihu Root, and E.B. Smith.Christiansen, Stephen G. \\"Charles Guiteau Trial: 1881 ‚Äì Was Guiteau Insane?\\" Law Library: American Law and Legal Information Guiteau's trial was one of the first high-profile cases in the United States where a defense based on a claim of temporary insanity was considered. Guiteau vehemently insisted that while he had been legally insane at the time of the shooting (because God had taken away his free will), he was not really medically insane, which was one of the major causes of the rift between him and his defense lawyers. Edward Charles Spitzka, a leading alienist, testified as an expert witness. Spitzka had stated that it was clear \\"Guiteau is not only now insane, but that he was never anything else.\\" While on the stand, Spitzka testified that he had \\"no doubt\\" that Guiteau was both insane and \\"a moral monstrosity\\". Spitzka came to the conclusion that Guiteau had \\"the insane manner\\" he had so often observed in asylums, adding that Guiteau was a \\"morbid egotist\\" with \\"a tendency to misinterpret the real affairs of life\\". He thought the condition to be the result of \\"a congenital malformation of the brain\\". George Corkhill, who was the District of Columbia's district attorney and on the prosecuting team, summed up the prosecution's opinion of Guiteau's insanity defense in a pre-trial press statement that also mirrored public opinion on the issue. A cartoon depicting Guiteau as a dangerous fool Guiteau became something of a media sensation during his entire trial for his bizarre behavior, which included his frequently cursing and insulting the judge, most of the witnesses, the prosecution, and even his defense team, as well as formatting his testimony in epic poems which he recited at length, and soliciting legal advice from random spectators in the audience via passed notes. He dictated an autobiography to the New York Herald, ending it with a personal ad for \\"a nice Christian lady under 30 years of age\\". He was oblivious to the American public's hatred of him, even after he was almost assassinated twice himself. He frequently smiled and waved at spectators and reporters in and out of the courtroom. Guiteau sent a letter in which he argued that Arthur should set him free because he had just increased Arthur's salary by making him president. At one point, Guiteau argued before Cox that Garfield was killed not by the bullets but by medical malpractice (\\"The doctors killed Garfield, I just shot him\\"). Throughout the trial and up until his execution, Guiteau was housed at St. Elizabeths Hospital in the southeastern quadrant of Washington, D.C. While in prison and awaiting execution, Guiteau wrote a defense of the assassination he had committed and an account of his own trial, which was published as The Truth and the Removal. To the end, Guiteau was making plans to start a lecture tour after his perceived imminent release and to run for president himself in 1884, while at the same time continuing to delight in the media circus surrounding his trial. He was found guilty on January 25, 1882, and sentenced to death. After the guilty verdict was read, Guiteau stepped forward, despite his lawyers' efforts to tell him to be quiet, and yelled at the jury saying \\"You are all low, consummate jackasses!\\" plus a further stream of curses and obscenities before he was taken away by guards to his cell to await execution. Guiteau appealed his conviction, but his appeal was rejected. Twenty-nine days before his execution, Guiteau composed a lengthy poem asserting that God had commanded him to kill Garfield to prevent Secretary James G. Blaine‚Äôs \\"scheming\\" to war with Chile and Peru. Guiteau also claimed in the poem that Vice President Chester A. Arthur knew the assassination had saved the United States and that Arthur's refusal to pardon him was the \\"basest ingratitude\\". Guiteau also (incorrectly) presumed that now-President Arthur would pressure the Supreme Court into hearing his court appeal. He was hanged on June 30, 1882, in the District of Columbia, just two days before the first anniversary of the shooting. A drawing of the jail where Guiteau was confined after his arrest. While being led to his execution, Guiteau was said to have continued to smile and wave at spectators and reporters. He notoriously danced his way to the gallows and shook hands with his executioner. On the scaffold, as a last request, he recited a poem called \\"I am Going to the Lordy\\", which he had written during his incarceration. He had originally requested an orchestra to play as he sang his poem, but this request was denied.Guiteau's poem forms the basis for the song \\"The Ballad of Guiteau\\" in Stephen Sondheim's musical Assassins; it is sung as the character cakewalks up the steps to the gallows. As per request with the executioner, Guiteau signaled that he was ready to die by dropping the paper. After he finished reading his poem, a black hood was placed over the smiling Guiteau's head and moments later the gallows trapdoor was sprung, the rope breaking his neck instantly with the fall. Guiteau's body was not returned to his family, as they were unable to afford a private funeral, but was instead autopsied and buried in a corner of the jailyard. Upon his autopsy it was discovered that Guiteau had the condition known as phimosis, an inability to retract the foreskin, which at the time was thought to have caused the insanity that led him to assassinate Garfield. With tiny pieces of the hanging rope already being sold as souvenirs to a fascinated public, rumors immediately began to swirl that jail guards planned to dig up Guiteau's corpse to meet demands of this burgeoning new market. Fearing scandal, the decision was made to disinter the corpse.Yanoff, pp. 398‚Äì99 The body was sent to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland, which preserved Guiteau's brain as well as his enlarged spleen discovered at autopsy and bleached the skeleton. These were placed in storage by the museum. Parts of Guiteau's brain remain on display in a jar at the M√ºtter Museum in Philadelphia. Psychological assessment Allan McLane Hamilton said in 1881 that he believed that Guiteau was sane when he assassinated Garfield. An autopsy of Guiteau's brain revealed that his dura mater was abnormally thick, suggesting he may have had neurosyphillis, a disease which causes mental instability; he could have contracted the disease from a prostitute. George Paulson, formerly the chair of neurology at the Ohio State University, disputed the neurosyphillis diagnosis, arguing that Guiteau suffered from both schizophrenia and \\"grandiose narcissism\\". In 2014, the criminal psychologist Kent Kiehl diagnosed Guiteau as a psychopath, giving him a score of 37.5 out of 40 on the PCL-R scale. In popular culture The life of Guiteau, focusing on his psychological disturbances and his plan to kill Garfield, is the subject of \\"Portrait of an Assassin\\", a radio play by James Agate Jr. The play was produced as Episode 1125 of CBS Radio Mystery Theater and was first broadcast on October 8, 1980. Guiteau is depicted in Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's musical Assassins, wherein he mentors Sara Jane Moore, a woman who attempted to assassinate Gerald Ford. Guiteau sings parts of \\"I am Going to the Lordy\\" in the musical's song \\"The Ballad of Guiteau\\". In the American Dad! episode \\"Garfield and Friends\\", Hayley Smith uses Guiteau's DNA to revive him and uses him like a bloodhound to track down a revived Garfield. In the alternate history short story \\"I Shall Have a Flight to Glory\\" by Michael P. Kube-McDowell in the 1992 anthology Alternate Presidents by Mike Resnick, Guiteau and Garfield are allies against Samuel J. Tilden, who has become a tyrannical president. Actor Will Janowitz plays Guiteau in the 2016 PBS documentary American Experience: Murder of a President. The Ramblin' Jack Elliott song \\"The Death of Mister Garfield\\" recounts the assassination and the reactions of a fictional witness. Johnny Cash learned the song from Elliott, and later recorded a re-worked version as \\"Mr. Garfield\\".

In many cases where the term is used, a financial investor, referred to as a 'corporate raider', takes control of another company and then auctions off the acquired company's assets. The term is generally used in a pejorative sense as such activity is not considered helpful to the company. The proceeds of the sale of assets may be used to lower the company's net debt. Alternatively, they may be used to pay a dividend to equityholders, leaving the company with lower net worth ‚Äì i.e. the same level of debt but fewer assets (and weaker earnings) to support that debt. With a lower level of assets, some argue that the business is rendered less financially stable or viable. For example, the sale-and-leaseback of a building would lead to an increased rental bill for the company. Asset stripping is highly controversial topic within the financial world. The benefits of asset stripping generally go to the corporate raiders, who can slash the debts they may have whilst improving their net worth. However, since asset stripping often results in thousands of employees losing their jobs without much consideration of the consequences to the affected community, the concept can be unpopular in the public sphere. One particular example of where asset stripping cost a significant number of workers their jobs was in the Fontainebleau Las Vegas LLC case. After the takeover, 433 people lost their jobs when assets were sold off and the company was stripped. Asset stripping has been considered to be a problem in economies such as Russia or China which are making a transition to being market economies. In these situations, managers of a state-owned company have been known to sell the assets they control, leaving behind nothing but debts to the state. History Early innovators of asset stripping were Carl Icahn, Victor Posner, and Nelson Peltz; all of whom were investors in the 1970s and 1980s. Carl Icahn performed one of the most notorious and hostile takeovers when he acquired Trans World Airlines in 1985. Here Icahn stripped TWA of its assets, selling them individually to repay the debt assimilated during the takeover. This particular corporate raid formed the idea of selling a company's assets in order to repay debt, and eventually increase the raider's net worth. One of the biggest corporate raids that failed to materialize was the takeover of Gulf Oil by T. Boone Pickens. In 1984, Pickens attempted to acquire Gulf Oil and sell its assets individually to gain net worth. However, the purchase would have had been severely detrimental to Chevron; a customer of Gulf Oil. Therefore, Chevron stepped-in and merged with Gulf Oil for $13.2 billion, which at that time was the biggest merger between two companies. In 2011, BC Partners acquired Phones 4u for a fee in the region of ¬£700 million. At this point in time Phones 4u had already entered administration and had deep financial struggles. However, this did not prevent BC Partners from taking a ¬£223 million dividend in order to pay off some of its own debts. Under the ownership of BC Partners, Phones 4u had very little financial freedom to expand and claim back the contract of EE. In September 2014 O2, Vodafone and Three decided to withdraw the rights for Phones 4u to sell their products. Due to the already poor financial situation of Phones 4u, the company had no alternative but to sell its individual assets and close down. The net worth of Phones 4u's assets, estimated to exceed ¬£1.4 billion, provided BC Partners with the credit to pay off some of its debts and significantly improve its net worth. In the United Kingdom The process of asset stripping is not an illegal practice. If a corporate raider sells the target company's assets individually and pays off its debts the financial regulators have no room for investigation. However, some firms perform the process illegally and if found guilty may incur a substantial fine or even prison. Asset stripping by private equity firms in Europe is now regulated pursuant to the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive. =Phoenixing= This is one of two methods a corporate raider can use to strip assets illegally. For this method to work, the corporate raider and the targeted firm must have the same director. Assets of the targeted firm are transferred to the corporate raider to ensure they remain safe from debt collectors. This process lets the corporate raider improve their net worth while leaving liabilities with the targeted company. =Liquidation= This method acts on completely fraudulent terms, and results in a higher punishment from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Here, corporate raiders take ownership of a company on hostile terms, transfer the assets to their name, and then put the dilapidated firm into liquidation. This ensures that the corporate raider improves their net worth, and has no liability to deal with the firm recently placed into liquidation.

She was previously the host of the podcast WebbAlert and a monthly columnist for the United States edition of FHM, where she contributed a monthly video game column titled \\"Tips from the Gaming Goddess\\".Lycos Retriever.com Morgan Webb: Maxim Magazine She began working at independent game studio Bonfire Studios in March 2017 in a production role.http://www.bonfirestudios.com/about-us  Career  Born in Los Angeles,http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2007/12/10/women-working-in- games-g4s-morgan-webb-talks-x-play-and-being-a-pin-up/ Webb attended UC Berkeley from 1996 to 2000. She developed computer skills in her free time there, and after graduating from college worked for a dot-com company as a website administrator. After the company went under during the dot-com bubble burst of 2000, her friend Catherine Schwartz got her hired at TechTV in 2001, and Webb became employed as the associate producer and web researcher for The Screen Savers. Throughout 2002 and 2003, she also regularly co-hosted TechTV's Call for Help with Chris Pirillo. In April 2003, Webb left The Screen Savers to co-host X-Play with Adam Sessler. Webb is one of the six TechTV personalities to survive the massive layoffs resulting from the May 2004 merger of G4 and TechTV. Only Adam Sessler and Webb remained with the network after G4's change in format. After Sessler's employment was terminated in April 2012, Webb was the only original TechTV personality remaining on the network. Morgan Webb during the Halo 3 launch in New York City, 2007 In August 2005, Webb became a contributing game columnist for FHM, alongside her regular hosting duties on X-Play. Her monthly column was titled \\"Tips from the Gaming Goddess\\". Readers were encouraged to email Webb their video-game-related inquiries; she would then answer one question each month. In February 2007, Webb wrote her final column for the magazine, which discontinued its U.S. publication in March. She also hosted the short-lived Free Stuff on G4. From August 2, 2007, to January 25, 2009, Webb had a daily video blogging initiative called WebbAlert. These videos were 5 to 6 minutes in length, and each consisted of a recap of popular technology news of the day. On occasion, Webb departed from the regular news format in favor of an episode on one particular topic of interest. Examples included a recap of the annual TED Conference, a viral video special showcasing \\"future 'Darwin Award' winners\\", and tech-centric \\"Holiday Buyer's Guides\\". In January 2009, Webb suspended WebbAlert indefinitely due to issues with maintaining it on a daily basis concurrently with her hosting duties on X-Play. On February 25, 2009, G4 announced that Webb would be the host of their new show G4 Underground, a weekly series that profiles a wide range of people and topics that are of interest to the \\"internet generation\\". It premiered March 29, 2009. After airing more than 1300 episodes, X-Play aired its final episode on January 23, 2013. From June 11, 2013 through June 13, 2013, Morgan co-anchored Microsoft's nightly Xbox @ E3 Live streaming event coverage on Xbox Live, reuniting her with former G4 personalities Kevin Pereira, Blair Herter, Jessica Chobot, Blair Butler and Tina Summerford. Morgan worked as a consultant and creative advisor for Activision Blizzard, where she also produced and hosted Blizzard's now-defunct monthly World of Warcraft discussion program WoW Source. In September of 2017, Morgan announced her employment at Bonfire Studios where she helps organize the community and other various functions.https://blog.bonfirestudios.com/welcome-to-bonfire- studios-d3ca69d83b0d  Personal life  As an infant and small child, Webb appeared in advertisements for Gerber baby food, Kenner Toys, and an ad for McDonald's, where she recited the ingredients of the Big Mac to a game of Pat- a-cake. Though Webb's parents refused to let her watch television, she made up for it by playing video games. She began with an Atari, primarily the game Combat, but as technology progressed, The Legend of Zelda and Phantasy Star became two of her favorite games. After Webb graduated from high school, she left home to attend UC Berkeley. There she earned a bachelor's degree in rhetoric (with a minor in Italian) in 2000.

Duncan (1896-1975). Ordered from Todd Pacific, Seattle, Washington on 27 February 1976 as part of the FY75 program, Duncan was laid down on 29 April 1977, launched on 1 March 1978, and commissioned on 15 May 1980, CDR Ross D. Barker in command. History Duncan, former PF-111, was sponsored by Mrs. Aniela Mateja Duncan, widow of the ship's namesake. In December 1982, Duncan developed a fissure in her superstructure during a storm. It was a class design deficiency that occurred on other frigates. In January 1984, Duncan was transferred to the United States Navy Reserve Fleet and Selected Reserve (SELRES) members provided for a portion of the ship's manning. Duncan and her crew were awarded the Battle Effectiveness Award five times for 18 month time periods ranging from July 1981 to June 1983 and July 1986 to December 1990. Duncan participated in Port of Hueneme Harbor Days in October 1992. In March 1993, sailors aboard Duncan rescued four fisherman from Ecuador who were stranded on their disabled fishing boat in the Pacific Ocean. Duncan towed their boat to safety in Manta, Ecuador. Duncan and her crew were nominated for the Humanitarian Service Medal in March 1993, but no unit award was given. =1992 Sitka port visit= Duncan participated in Sitka, Alaska's 125th anniversary Alaska Day celebration, 18 October 1992. The port visit became notorious following allegations of sexual misconduct with minors by crew members and the event's relative proximity to the Tailhook scandal and subsequent investigation. After Duncan was decommissioned, the story re- appeared in national media in 1996, following investigative reporting by the Dayton Daily News' Russell Carollo, due to complaints that the Navy didn't adequately punish the sailors involved. A grand jury in Sitka indicted two Duncan sailors on sexual assault charges, but the cases were dismissed in January 1997 due to prosecutorial delay and the Judge's determination that the two had already been tried by the Navy. A 22-year-old Ensign had faced court martial, but pleaded down to a letter of reprimand. Later, he also received an other than honorable discharge. The second sailor, a 23-year-old enlisted man, also faced court martial, but his charges were dropped by the court's presiding officer. =Decommissioning= Duncan was decommissioned on 17 December 1994 and stricken on 5 January 1998, Duncan was sold to Turkey on 5 April 1999 for use as a parts hulk. She was the first Perry frigate to be decommissioned, in commission for just 14.6 years. At the time, the Soviet Union had recently collapsed and Duncan was one of the oldest, unmodified, short hulled frigates in the fleet. She lacked some of the options others in her class had been modified with. For example, as a short hull ship, she did not have SH-60 Seahawk capability and a RAST to haul down the helicopter and transport it into the hangar. She also lacked a towed array sonar (TACTAS) and the MK-92 COherent Receiver Transmitter (CORT) modification.

Ahenakew was born at the Sandy Lake Indian Reserve in Saskatchewan. He and his wife, Grace Ahenakew, had five children.Aboriginal Faces of Saskatchewan Military and political career Ahenakew served in the Canadian Forces from 1951 to 1967, during which time he was stationed in Germany, Korea (during the Korean War), and Egypt. An alternate source indicates he served with the Canadian Armed Forces Engineers Corps in Canada, Egypt and Germany from 1962 to 1968 and attained the rank of Sergeant. In 1967, upon leaving the army, Ahenakew accepted a position with the Saskatchewan government, and became active in the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN). He was elected to the position of FSIN president in 1968 (until 1979). He stated that his military experience heavily influenced his choice to pursue politics: \\"I could see that what was happening to our people was the same kind of exploitation and degradation I had seen in Korea and Egypt.\\" During his time as FSIN president he released a report entitled \\"Indian Education in Saskatchewan,\\" and played a role in the founding of the Saskatchewan Indian Cultural College and the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College in 1972. He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Regina in 1977 and in 1978 he received the John Stratychuk award from the Saskatchewan Human Rights Association. Ahenakew received the Order of Canada in the degree of Member in 1978. His citation read: \\"Member of a United Nations committee and of the World Indigenous Peoples Council. His many years of service to Indians and M√©tis in Saskatchewan culminated in his election as Chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indians, which has revolutionized Indian education in his province.\\" He was stripped of the Order of Canada in 2005 after making controversial remarks about the Holocaust. On March 9, 1981, he was appointed Director of the Saskatchewan Public Service Commission's Special Programs Unit. In 1982, he was elected Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, a national representative body for Canadian aboriginals. Controversy surrounding anti-semitic remarks On December 13, 2002, Ahenakew gave a speech to an FSIN group, which was attended by James Parker, a reporter from the Saskatoon StarPhoenix. He made references to \\"goddamn immigrants\\" in Canada during his speech. During a question-and-answer session following his lecture, Ahenakew said that Jews were a disease in Germany and that Hitler was trying to \\"clean up Europe\\" when he \\"fried six million of those guys.\\" He also stated that Israel and the United States (specifically mentioning George W. Bush) were going to start the next world war. > The Germans used to tell me, and I got to know them well because I played > soccer against them and with them and so forth. But they used to tell me > that you guys are blessed. What we know about the Indians in Canada. They > are blessed. But that blessing is being destroyed by your immigrants that > are going over there. Especially the Jews, they said. The Second World War > was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between > Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well. But there's going to be > a war because the Israelis and the \\"Bushies\\" ‚Äì you know, the bully, the > bigot in the United States ‚Äì tells you that if you're not with me you're > against me. After the session concluded, the StarPhoenix reporter asked him to clarify these remarks, and he explained that while serving in the army after the war, Germans had told him the Jews had provoked the war. The StarPhoenix quoted him as further saying: > The Jews damn near owned all of Germany prior to the war. That's why Hitler > came in. He was going to make damn sure that the Jews didn't take over > Germany, or even Europe. That's why he fried six million of those guys, you > know. Jews would have owned the goddamned world. And look what they're doing > now, they're killing people in Arab countries. The reporter asked how Ahenakew could justify the Holocaust. The StarPhoenix quoted Ahenakew as replying: > How else do you get rid of a disease like that, that's going to take over, > that's going to dominate? = Public reaction = The comments were first circulated in the Canadian national media several days later, and were quickly condemned as antisemitic by Jewish groups, aboriginal leaders and Canadian politicians alike. Both Perry Bellgarde, president of FSIN, and Matthew Coon Come, AFN national chief, were quick to distance themselves from Ahenakew's comments. In June 2003, Ahenakew was formally charged by the Saskatchewan Justice Department with promoting hatred. In an interview in the July/August 2003 edition of This Magazine, Ahenakew expressed to reporter Alex Roslin his dissatisfaction with what he called \\"racial control\\" of the media, saying that \\"when a group of people, a race of people, control the world media, something has to be done about it.\\" The article also quotes claims that Ahenakew had long held racist beliefs against Jews, Blacks and other ethnic groups that had been shielded from the public. In connection with the remarks from 2002, which were recorded on tape with his knowledge, Ahenakew was later convicted in July 2005 of willfully promoting hatred against Jews. Ahenakew apologized for the remarks, saying they did not represent his beliefs and that he was \\"caught up in the heat of the moment. I was attempting to spark debate on what has been happening to our First Nations people.\\" At his trial, he later recanted his apology and blamed his outburst on his diabetes, some wine and a change in medication, a defense that was rejected by the court and he was subsequently fined $1,000. Despite this, he retained his belief that the Jews started the Second World War. Jewish groups, aboriginals and politicians later called for Ahenakew's membership in the Order of Canada to be revoked. The Governor General revoked Ahenakew's membership shortly after his trial. In June 2006, the decision was overturned by the Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench on the grounds that the trial judge failed to properly take into account that the remarks were uttered in the midst of an angry confrontation with a reporter, and therefore may not have constituted a \\"willful\\" promotion of hatred. A new trial was ordered. =Second trial= Ahenakew was retried in Saskatoon in 2008. In February 2009, Saskatchewan Provincial Court Judge Wilfred Tucker acquitted Ahenakew because his statements, while \\"revolting, disgusting and untrue\\" did not show an intent to incite hatred. Death Following a long battle with cancer, Ahenakew died on March 12, 2010 at a hospital in Shellbrook, Saskatchewan, aged 76.

The pericardial sac has two layers, a serous layer and a fibrous layer. It encloses the pericardial cavity which contains pericardial fluid. The pericardium fixes the heart to the mediastinum, gives protection against infection and provides the lubrication for the heart. It receives its name from Ancient Greek peri (œÄŒµœÅŒØ; \\"around\\") and cardion (Œ∫Œ¨œÅŒ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ; \\"heart\\"). Structure The pericardium is a tough double layered fibroelastic sac which covers the heart. The space between the two layers of serous pericardium (see below), the pericardial cavity, is filled with serous fluid which protects the heart from any kind of external jerk or shock. There are two layers to the pericardial sac: the outermost fibrous pericardium and the inner serous pericardium. =Fibrous pericardium= The fibrous pericardium is the most superficial layer of the pericardium. It is made up of dense and loose connective tissue, which acts to protect the heart, anchoring it to the surrounding walls and preventing it from overfilling with blood. It is continuous with the outer adventitial layer of the neighboring great blood vessels. =Serous pericardium= The serous pericardium, in turn, is divided into two layers, the parietal pericardium, which is fused to and inseparable from the fibrous pericardium, and the visceral pericardium, which is part of, or in some textbooks synonymous with, the epicardium. Both of these layers function in lubricating the heart to prevent friction during heart activity. The visceral layer extends to the beginning of the great vessels (the large blood vessels serving the heart) becoming one with the parietal layer of the serous pericardium. This happens at two areas: where the aorta and pulmonary trunk leave the heart and where the superior vena cava, inferior vena cava and pulmonary veins enter the heart. In between the parietal and visceral pericardial layers there is a potential space called the pericardial cavity, which contains a supply of lubricating serous fluid known as the pericardial fluid. Pericardial recesses are small spaces in the pericardial cavity. Pericardial fluid filling these recesses may mimic mediastinal lymphadenopathy. When the visceral layer of serous pericardium comes into contact with heart (not the great vessels) it is known as the epicardium. The epicardium is the layer immediately outside of the heart muscle proper (the myocardium). The epicardium is largely made of connective tissue and functions as a protective layer. During ventricular contraction, the wave of depolarization moves from the endocardial to the epicardial surface. =Anatomical relationships= A transverse section of the thorax, showing the contents of the middle and the posterior mediastinum. The pleural cavity and the pericardial cavity are exaggerated since normally there is no space between the pleurae or between the pericardium and heart. Pericardium is also known as cardiac epidermis. pleural cavities c, and the diaphragm e. * Surrounds heart and bases of pulmonary artery and aorta. * Deep to sternum and anterior chest wall. * The right phrenic nerve passes to the right of the pericardium. * The left phrenic nerve passes over the pericardium of the left ventricle. * Pericardial arteries supply blood to the dorsal portion of the pericardium. Function * Sets heart in mediastinum and limits its motion * Protects it from infections coming from other organs * Prevents excessive dilation of the heart in cases of acute volume overload * Lubricates the heart Clinical significance 3D still showing the pericardium layer. Inflammation of the pericardium is called pericarditis. This condition typically causes chest pain that spreads to the back that is worsened by lying flat. In patients suffering with pericarditis, a pericardial friction rub can often be heard when listening to the heart with a stethoscope. Pericarditis is often caused by a viral infection (glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, or coxsackievirus), or more rarely with a bacterial infection, but may also occur following a myocardial infarction. Pericarditis is usually a short-lived condition that can be successfully treated with painkillers, anti-inflammatories, and colchicine. In some cases, pericarditis can become a long-term condition causing scarring of the pericardium which restricts the heart's movement, known as constrictive pericarditis. Constrictive pericarditis is sometimes treated by surgically removing the pericardium in a procedure called a pericardiectomy. Fluid can build up within the pericardial sack, referred to as a pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusions often occur secondary to pericarditis, kidney failure, or tumours and frequently do not cause any symptoms. However, large effusions or effusions that accumulate rapidly can compress the heart in a condition known as cardiac tamponade, causing breathlessness and potentially fatal low blood pressure. Fluid can be removed from the pericardial space for diagnosis or to relieve tamponade using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis. For cases of recurrent pericardial effusion, an operation to create a hole between the pericardial and pleural spaces can be performed, known as a pericardial fenestration. The congenital abscence of pericardium is rare. However, if it happens, it is usually occurs on the left side. Those affected usually do not have any symptoms and they are usually discovered incidentally. About 30 to 50 percent of the affected people have other heart abnormalities such as atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, bicuspid aortic valve, and lung abnormalities. On chest X‚Äìray, the heart looks posteriorly rotated. Another feature is the sharp delineation of pulmonary artery and transverse aorta due to lung deposition between these two structures. If there is partial abscence of pericardium, there will be bulge of the left atrial appendage. On CT and MRI scans, similar findings as chest X‚Äìray can be shown. The left sideded partial pericardium defect is difficult to see because even a normal pericardium is difficult to be seen on CT and MRI. A complete pericardial defect will show the heart displaced to the left with part of the lungs squeezed between inferior border of heart and diaphragm.

The changes are first recorded in the log, which must be written to stable storage, before the changes are written to the database. In a system using WAL, all modifications are written to a log before they are applied. Usually both redo and undo information is stored in the log. The purpose of this can be illustrated by an example. Imagine a program that is in the middle of performing some operation when the machine it is running on loses power. Upon restart, that program might need to know whether the operation it was performing succeeded, succeeded partially, or failed. If a write-ahead log is used, the program can check this log and compare what it was supposed to be doing when it unexpectedly lost power to what was actually done. On the basis of this comparison, the program could decide to undo what it had started, complete what it had started, or keep things as they are. WAL allows updates of a database to be done in-place. Another way to implement atomic updates is with shadow paging, which is not in-place. The main advantage of doing updates in-place is that it reduces the need to modify indexes and block lists. ARIES is a popular algorithm in the WAL family. Modern file systems typically use a variant of WAL for at least file system metadata; this is called journaling.

The Ship sponsor was Mrs. Olga Clark, the widow of Admiral Clark. In July 1982, Clark recovered three sailors that were washed overboard from the aircraft carrier in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Spain. A fourth sailor was not recovered and was lost at sea. In December 1992, Clark was nearby when the crew of an F-14 was forced to eject during training operations off the coast of Virginia. Clarks helicopter rescued the radar intercept officer and a United States Coast Guard helicopter rescued the pilot. In April 1994, Clark changed homeports from Newport, Rhode Island, to Norfolk, Virginia. The ship had previously been homeported in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania from the mid-1980s to 1992 and Mayport, Florida before that.

It includes all protists whose plastids contain chlorophyll c such as some algae, diatoms, oomycetes, and protozoans. It is probably a polyphyletic group whose members independently arose as separate evolutionary group from the common ancestor of all eukaryotes. As it is assumed the last common ancestor already possessed chloroplasts of red algal origin, the non-photosynthetic forms evolved from ancestors able to perform photosynthesis. Their plastids are surrounded by four membranes, and are believed to have been acquired from some red algae. Chromista as a biological kingdom was created by British biologist Thomas Cavalier-Smith in 1981 to differentiate some protists from typical protozoans and plants. According to Cavalier-Smith, the kingdom originally included only algae, but his later analysis indicated that many protozoans also belong to the new group. As of 2018, the kingdom is as diverse as kingdoms Plantae and Animalia, consisting of eight phyla. Notable members include marine algae, potato blight, dinoflagellates, Paramecium, brain parasite (Toxoplasma) and malarial parasite (Plasmodium). Biology Structure of typical chromists compared with plant cell (left) Members of Chromista are single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes having basically either or both features: #plastid(s) that contain chlorophyll c and lies within an extra (periplastid) membrane in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (typically within the perinuclear cisterna); #cilia with tripartite or bipartite rigid tubular hairs. Even though the kingdom includes diverse organisms from algae to malarial parasites (Plasmodium), they are genetically related and are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor with all other eukaryotes but in an independent line of evolution. As a result of evolution, many have retained their plastids and cilia, while some have lost them. Molecular evidences indicate that the plastids in chromists were derived from red algae through secondary symbiogenesis in a single event. (In contrasts, plants acquired their plastids from cyanobacteria through primary symbiogenesis.) These plastids are now enclosed in two extra cell membranes, making a four membrane envelope, as a result of which they acquired many other membrane proteins for transporting molecules in and out of the organelles. The diversity of chromists arose from degeneration, loss or replacement of the plastids in some lineages. There was also additional symbiogenesis of green algae, the genes of which are retained in some members (such as heterokonts), as well as bacterial chlorophyll (indicated by the presence of ribosomal protein L36 gene, rpl36) in haptophytes and cryptophytes. History and groups The name Chromista was first introduced by Cavalier-Smith in 1981; the earlier names Chromophyta, Chromobiota and Chromobionta correspond to roughly the same group. It has been described as consisting of three different groups: *Heterokonts or stramenopiles: brown algae, diatoms, water moulds, etc. *Haptophytes *Cryptomonads Cavalier-Smith later (in 2009) stated his reason for making a new kingdom, saying: Since then Chromista has been defined in different ways at different times. In 2010, Cavalier-Smith himself indicated his desire to move Alveolata, Rhizaria and Heliozoa into Chromista. Some examples of classification of the Chromista and related groups are shown below. =Chromophyc√©es (Chadefaud, 1950)= The Chromophyc√©es (Chadefaud, 1950), renamed Chromophycota (Chadefaud, 1960), included the current Ochrophyta (autotrophic Stramenopiles), Haptophyta (included in Chrysophyceae until Christensen, 1962), Cryptophyta, Dinophyta, Euglenophyceae and Choanoflagellida (included in Chrysophyceae until Hibberd, 1975). =Chromophyta (Christensen 1962, 1989)= The Chromophyta (Christensen 1962, 1989), defined as algae with chlorophyll c, included the current Ochrophyta (autotrophic Stramenopiles), Haptophyta, Cryptophyta, Dinophyta and Choanoflagellida. The Euglenophyceae were transferred to the Chlorophyta. =Chromophyta (Bourrelly, 1968)= The Chromophyta (Bourrelly, 1968) included the current Ochrophyta (autotrophic Stramenopiles), Haptophyta and Choanoflagellida. The Cryptophyceae and the Dinophyceae were part of Pyrrhophyta (= Dinophyta). =Chromista (Cavalier-Smith, 1981)= The Chromista (Cavalier-Smith, 1981) included the current Stramenopiles, Haptophyta and Cryptophyta. =Chromalveolata (Adl et al., 2005)= The Chromalveolata (Cavalier-Smith, 1981) included Stramenopiles, Haptophyta, Cryptophyta and Alveolata. Classification Chromista classification In his original classification in 1981, Cavalier-Smith included three phyla under Chromista, such as: #Heterokonta #Haptophyta #Cryptomonada In 2010, Cavalier- Smith reorganised Chromista to include SAR supergroup (such as Stramenopiles, Alveolata and Rhizaria) and Hacrobia (Haptista, Cryptista). In 2015, he and his colleagues made a new higher-level grouping of all organisms as a revision of seven kingdoms model. In it, they classified Chromista into 2 subkingdoms and 11 phyla, namely: #Subkingdom Harosa (=Supergroup SAR) ##Phylum Ciliophora ##Phylum Miozoa ##Phylum Bigyra ##Phylum Ochrophyta ##Phylum Pseudofungi (=Oomycota) ##Phylum Cercozoa ##Phylum Retaria #Subkingdom Hacrobia ##Phylum N.N. (=nomen nominandum, name unknown) - i.e. the classes Endohelea, Picomonadea and Telonemea ##Phylum Cryptista ##Phylum Haptophyta ##Phylum Heliozoa Cavalier-Smith made a new analysis of Chromista in 2018 in which he classified all chromists into 8 phyla (Gyrista corresponds to the above phyla Ochrophyta and Pseudofungi, Cryptista corresponds to the above phyla Cryptista and \\"N.N.\\", Haptista corresponds to the above phyla Haptophyta and Heliozoa):: #Subkingdom Harosa ##Phylum Miozoa ##Phylum Ciliophora ##Phylum Gyrista ##Phylum Bigyra ##Phylum Cercozoa ##Phylum Retaria #Subkingdom Hacrobia ##Phylum Cryptista ##Phylum Haptista =Phylogeny= Controversy Molecular trees have had some difficulty resolving relationships between the different groups. All three may share a common ancestor with the alveolates (see chromalveolates), but there is evidence that suggests that the haptophytes and cryptomonads do not belong together with the heterokonts or the SAR clade, but may be associated with the Archaeplastida. Cryptista specifically may be sister or part of Archaeplastida.

Interactive fiction engine Simutronics' products GemStone IV, DragonRealms, Modus Operandi, and Alliance of Heroes are text-based multiplayer games built on a proprietary Interactive Fiction Engine (IFE) written in the C programming language. The IFE is responsible for managing the server's memory, interacting with the game's database, and communicating with the clients. It also includes an interpreter for the proprietary GemStone Scripting Language (GSL), a relatively simple language which abstracts away most of the complex details that the IFE handles. Originally, many core game commands (such as those relating to movement and inventory management) were implemented directly by the IFE. Over time, most of those have been migrated to GSL to allow for easier modification. HeroEngine HeroEngine is a 3D game engine and server technology platform developed specifically for building MMO-style games, based around a system similar to the IFE using the Hero Script Language (HSL). Originally developed for the company's own game Hero's Journey - which never made it to the testing stage - the engine has since been licensed by other companies. Simutronics sold the HeroEngine to Idea Fabrik, Plc. on August 5, 2010.

In 1994, GEnie claimed around 350,000 users. Peak simultaneous usage was around 10,000 users. It was one of the pioneering services in the field, though eventually replaced by the World Wide Web and graphics-based services, most notably AOL.Simutronics Timeline  Early history  GEnie was founded by Bill Louden on October 1, 1985Remarks by William Louden, GM, GEnie (9/88) and was launched as an ASCII text-based service by GE's Information Services division in October 1985, and received attention as the first serious commercial competition to CompuServe. Louden was originally CompuServe's product manager for Computing, Community (forums), Games, eCommerce, and email product lines. Louden purchased DECWAR source code and had MegaWars developed, one of the earliest multi-player online games (or MMOG), in 1985. The service was run by General Electric Information Services (GEIS, now GXS) based in Rockville, Maryland. GEIS served a diverse set of large-scale, international, commercial network-based custom application needs, including banking, electronic data interchange and e-mail services to companies worldwide, but was able to run GEnie on their many GE Mark III time-sharing mainframe computers that otherwise would have been underutilized after normal U.S. business hours. This orientation was part of GEnie's downfall. Although it became very popular and a national force in the on-line marketplace, GEnie was not allowed to grow. GEIS executives steadfastly refused to view the service as anything but \\"fill in\\" load and would not expand the network by a single phone line, let alone expand mainframe capacity, to accommodate GEnie's growing user base. (Later, however, GE did consent to make the service available through the SprintNet time-sharing network, which had its own dial- up points of presence; an Internet-to-SprintNet gateway operated by Merit Network also made the text-based parts of the service available through telnet.) GEnie log-in screen from February 1993, as it would have appeared on an Apple IIe The initial price for connection, at both 300 bits per second and the then-high-speed 1,200 bits per second, was $5‚Äì6 per hour during \\"non- prime-time\\" hours (evenings and weekends) and $36 an hour (to discourage daytime use) otherwise, later adjusted to $6 per hour and $18 per hour, respectively. A speed of 2,400 bit/s was also available at a premium. Later, GEnie developed the Star*Services package, soon renamed Genie*Basic after Prodigy threatened a trademark lawsuit over the use of the word \\"Star\\". It offered a set of \\"unlimited use\\" features for $4.95 per month. Other services cost extra, mirroring the tiered service model popular at the time. GEnie's forums were called RoundTables (RTs), and each, as well as other internal services, had a page number associated with it, akin to a Web address today; typing \\"m 1335\\", for instance, would bring you to the GemStone III game page. The service included RTs, games, mail and shopping. For some time, GEnie published a bimonthly print magazine, LiveWire. GEnie's early chat room was called the LiveWire CB Simulator,The Information Center's guide to LiveWire CB Simulator after the citizens' band radios popular at the time.  Games  GEnie had a reputation for being the home of excellent online text games, similar to the \\"doorway\\" games on bulletin board systems but often massively multiplayer. Also, there were graphical games using then-state-of-the-art non- textured 3D graphics on PCs with VGA displays. Top titles included: * Kesmai's Air Warrior (3D graphics) * Simutronics's GemStone, later GemStone III * AUSI's Dragon's Gate * Simutronics' CyberStrike (3D graphics‚Äîlater spun off and expanded into the stand-alone CyberStrike 2, with textured 3D graphics, lighting effects, etc.) * Kesmai's Multiplayer BattleTech: EGA Other major titles included: * AUSI's Galaxy II * NTN Trivia * Kesmai's Stellar Warrior‚ÄîGEnie's first multiplayer online game * Kesmai's Stellar Emperor‚Äîthe GEnie version of Kesmai's Compuserve game MegaWars III * J. Weaver Jr.'s RSCARDS * Jim Dunnigan's Hundred Years' War * Simutronics' DragonRealms * Simutronics' Orb Wars * Federation II * Simutronics' Modus Operandi * A-Maze- ing * Diplomacy Online * Bob Maples's Castle Quest  RoundTables  A RoundTable on GEnie was a discussion area containing a message board (\\"BBS\\"), a chatroom (\\"RealTime Conference\\" or RTC) and a Library for permanent files. They were part of an online community culture that predated the Internet's emergence as a mass medium, which also included such separate entities as CompuServe forums, Usenet newsgroups and email mailing lists. Most RoundTables were actually operated not by GEnie employees but by independent contractors working from home, which was standard practice for online services at the time. The contractors received royalties on time spent in their forums. In the most popular forums, this revenue stream was often substantial enough to hire one or two part-time or full-time staffers. Many RoundTables also had a number of unpaid assistants, working for a \\"free flag\\" (which granted them free access to that RoundTable) or an \\"internal account\\" (which granted free access to all of the service). Rise and fall By May 1986 GEnie claimed to have 12,000 subscribers, up from 3,000 in February. Although it for years was the second-largest service provider after CompuServe, GEnie failed to keep up when Prodigy and America Online produced graphics-based online services that drew the masses. Programs such as Aladdin, which had been developed earlier by an independent developer and eventually supported by GEnie, helped many of the newcomers who came to GEnie from Prodigy and AOL adjust; these were the equivalent of modern-day email programs and newsreaders, incorporating a more user-friendly interface which automated message and mail downloading and posting. In addition, GEnie took its time developing an Internet e-mail gateway, which opened on July 1, 1993. GE sold GEnie in 1996 to Yovelle, which was later taken over by IDT Corp. IDT attempted to transition GEnie (now without the all-uppercase \\"GE\\") to an Internet service provider, but ultimately failed. IDT also funded the development of a GUI for the text-based service; this client was actually released, but the service did not survive long enough for it to become popular. Visitors to GEnie dropped with the growth of other online services and fell dramatically following a very sudden change in the fee structure in 1996. The users were notified with only 12 hours' notice that all Basic (flat-rate) services would cease to exist, while prices of the other services would rise dramatically. By the final year, insiders reported fewer than 10,000 total users. On December 4, 1999, it was announced that GEnie would close for good on December 27 due to the year 2000 problem. Remaining users gathered in chat areas of the few RoundTables remaining to say goodbye. But GEnie did not close for four more days, and a dwindling number watched at the close of each day. The RoundTables and all areas of GEnie, except the Top page, became unavailable slightly before midnight on December 30, 1999. Legacy Several books, TV shows, films and other projects had their genesis and inspiration on GEnie. One example is the Babylon 5 television show, created by J. Michael Straczynski, which was first announced publicly in GEnie's Science Fiction RoundTables. The SFRTs served as the show's first online \\"home\\" and were the source of many in-jokes and references throughout its run. Bill Louden, the original creator of GEnie, formed a group of investors to buy the Delphi online service from News Corp, where he led the transition of the service from text-only to the Web (and from a pay-per-hour to an advertising-supported revenue model). Notable users Many well-known personalities were early adopters of the online medium, and were a prominent presence on GEnie, either active in one of its RoundTables, or frequent public participants in GEnie's CB Chat. * Tom Clancy, author, participated in the chat area and he played games such as GemStone II with his children. * Peter David, self-styled \\"writer of stuff\\", such as comic books, television and film novelizations, screenwriting and many original novels and short stories * Cory Doctorow, co-author of the Boing Boing blog and science fiction novelist, was active on GEnie's Science Fiction RoundTable * Damon Knight, author, founder of Science Fiction Writers of America, SFWA Grand Master * Wayne Knight, actor (Seinfeld, Jurassic Park), was an occasional visitor to the ShowBiz RT * Michael Okuda, Star Trek graphics designer frequented the SFRT * Richard Pini, husband of Wendy Pini, and editor/publisher of her cult favorite fantasy (with SF elements) comic book series ElfQuest. * Daniel Pinkwater, frequent presence in Writer's Ink * Jerry Pournelle, science fiction author and political commentator, had his own RoundTable. * J. Michael Straczynski, television writer, producer and creator of Babylon 5 * Wil Wheaton, current \\"geek author\\" and actor (Wesley in Star Trek: The Next Generation), was a frequent presence in the chat area, and often visited the Sports RoundTable. The Science Fiction RoundTable (SFRT) became the official online forum of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), which led a number of science fiction writers to join GEnie. Besides those already mentioned, they included Dafydd ab Hugh, John Barnes, Keith DeCandido, Steven Brust, Michael A. Burstein, Debra Doyle, Neil Gaiman, Joe Haldeman, Katharine Kerr, Michael Kube-McDowell, Paul Levinson, George R.R. Martin, Rich Normandie, Raven Oak, Mike Resnick, Robert J. Sawyer, J. Neil Schulman, Josepha Sherman, Susan Shwartz, Martha Soukup, Michael Swanwick, Judith Tarr, Harry Turtledove, Lawrence Watt-Evans, Leslie What, and Jane Yolen. Occasional but less frequent visitors included K. W. Jeter and Ken Grimwood. Science fiction editors Gardner Dozois, Scott Edelman, Peter Heck, Tappan King, Beth Meacham, Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Teresa Nielsen Hayden, Sheila Finch and Dean Wesley Smith were also frequent participants.

They are filamentous and heterotrophic, and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction of an oospore is the result of contact between hyphae of male antheridia and female oogonia; these spores can overwinter and are known as resting spores. Asexual reproduction involves the formation of chlamydospores and sporangia, producing motile zoospores. Oomycetes occupy both saprophytic and pathogenic lifestyles, and include some of the most notorious pathogens of plants, causing devastating diseases such as late blight of potato and sudden oak death. One oomycete, the mycoparasite Pythium oligandrum, is used for biocontrol, attacking plant pathogenic fungi. The oomycetes are also often referred to as water molds (or water moulds), although the water-preferring nature which led to that name is not true of most species, which are terrestrial pathogens. Oomycetes were originally grouped with fungi due to similarities in morphology and lifestyle. However, molecular and phylogenetic studies revealed significant differences between fungi and oomycetes which means the latter are now grouped with the stramenopiles (which include some types of algae). The Oomycota have a very sparse fossil record; a possible oomycete has been described from Cretaceous amber.  Etymology  Oomycota comes from the Greek œâœåŒΩ (oon, 'egg') and ŒºœçŒ∫Œ∑œÑŒ±œÇ (mykitas, 'fungus'), referring to the large round oogonia, structures containing the female gametes, that are characteristic of the oomycetes. The name \\"water mold\\" refers to their earlier classification as fungi and their preference for conditions of high humidity and running surface water, which is characteristic for the basal taxa of the oomycetes.  Morphology  The oomycetes rarely have septa (see hypha), and if they do, they are scarce, appearing at the bases of sporangia, and sometimes in older parts of the filaments. Some are unicellular, while others are filamentous and branching.  Classification  Simplified phylogeny. Asexual structures (sporangia) in Saprolegniales, Albuginales and Peronosporales Sexual structures (only oogonia, antheridia not shown) of Saprolegnia. Previously the group was arranged into six orders. * The Saprolegniales are the most widespread. Many break down decaying matter; others are parasites. * The Leptomitales have wall thickenings that give their continuous cell body the appearance of septation. They bear chitin and often reproduce asexually. * The Rhipidiales use rhizoids to attach their thallus to the bed of stagnant or polluted water bodies. * The Albuginales are considered by some authors to be a family (Albuginaceae) within the Peronosporales, although it has been shown that they are phylogenetically distinct from this order. * The Peronosporales too are mainly saprophytic or parasitic on plants, and have an aseptate, branching form. Many of the most damaging agricultural parasites belong to this order. * The Lagenidiales are the most primitive; some are filamentous, others unicellular; they are generally parasitic. However more recently this has been expanded considerably. * Anisolpidiales Dick 2001 ** Anisolpidiaceae Karling 1943 * Lagenismatales Dick 2001 ** Lagenismataceae Dick 1995 * Salilagenidiales Dick 2001 ** Salilagenidiaceae Dick 1995 * Rozellopsidales Dick 2001 ** Rozellopsidaceae Dick 1995 ** Pseudosphaeritaceae Dick 1995 * Ectrogellales ** Ectrogellaceae * Haptoglossales ** Haptoglossaceae * Eurychasmales ** Eurychasmataceae Petersen 1905 * Haliphthorales ** Haliphthoraceae Vishniac 1958 * Olpidiopsidales ** Sirolpidiaceae Cejp 1959 ** Pontismataceae Petersen 1909 ** Olpidiopsidaceae Cejp 1959 * Atkinsiellales ** Atkinisellaceae ** Crypticolaceae Dick 1995 * Saprolegniales ** Achlyaceae ** Verrucalvaceae Dick 1984 ** Saprolegniaceae Warm. 1884 [Leptolegniaceae] * Leptomitales ** Leptomitaceae Kuetz. 1843 [Apodachlyellaceae Dick 1986] ** Leptolegniellaceae Dick 1971 [Ducellieriaceae Dick 1995] * Rhipidiales ** Rhipidiaceae Cejp 1959 * Albuginales ** Albuginaceae Schroet. 1893 * Peronosporales [Pythiales; Sclerosporales; Lagenidiales] ** Salisapiliaceae ** Pythiaceae Schroet. 1893 [Pythiogetonaceae; Lagenaceae Dick 1994; Lagenidiaceae; Peronophythoraceae; Myzocytiopsidaceae Dick 1995] ** Peronosporaceae Warm. 1884 [Sclerosporaceae Dick 1984] Phylogenetic relationships Pythium sp.

Albugo candida (Albuginales) on shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris, Brassicales). =Internal= =External= This group was originally classified among the fungi (the name \\"oomycota\\" means \\"egg fungus\\") and later treated as protists, based on general morphology and lifestyle. A cladistic analysis based on modern discoveries about the biology of these organisms supports a relatively close relationship with some photosynthetic organisms, such as brown algae and diatoms. A common taxonomic classification based on these data, places the class Oomycota along with other classes such as Phaeophyceae (brown algae) within the phylum Heterokonta. This relationship is supported by a number of observed differences between the characteristics of oomycetes and fungi. For instance, the cell walls of oomycetes are composed of cellulose rather than chitin and generally do not have septations. Also, in the vegetative state they have diploid nuclei, whereas fungi have haploid nuclei. Most oomycetes produce self-motile zoospores with two flagella. One flagellum has a \\"whiplash\\" morphology, and the other a branched \\"tinsel\\" morphology. The \\"tinsel\\" flagellum is unique to the Kingdom Heterokonta. Spores of the few fungal groups which retain flagella (such as the Chytridiomycetes) have only one whiplash flagellum. Oomycota and fungi have different metabolic pathways for synthesizing lysine and have a number of enzymes that differ. The ultrastructure is also different, with oomycota having tubular mitochondrial cristae and fungi having flattened cristae. In spite of this evidence to the contrary, many species of oomycetes are still described or listed as types of fungi and may sometimes be referred to as pseudofungi, or lower fungi.  Biology  = Reproduction = Life cycle of Phytophthora infestans (Peronosporales) on potato. Most of the oomycetes produce two distinct types of spores. The main dispersive spores are asexual, self-motile spores called zoospores, which are capable of chemotaxis (movement toward or away from a chemical signal, such as those released by potential food sources) in surface water (including precipitation on plant surfaces). A few oomycetes produce aerial asexual spores that are distributed by wind. They also produce sexual spores, called oospores, that are translucent, double-walled, spherical structures used to survive adverse environmental conditions. = Ecology and pathogenicity = Unidentified water mold on dead larval mayfly. culture of Achlya sp. (Saprolegniales) isolated from a stream. Sea trout suffering from UDN with secondary Saprolegnia infections. Many oomycetes species are economically important, aggressive algae and plant pathogens.Agrios, George N. (2005). Plant Pathology. 5th ed. Academic Press. link. Some species can cause disease in fish, and at least one is a pathogen of mammals. The majority of the plant pathogenic species can be classified into four groups, although more exist. * The Phytophthora group is a paraphyletic genus that causes diseases such as dieback, late blight in potatoes (the cause of the Great Famine of the 1840s that ravaged Ireland and other parts of Europe), sudden oak death, rhododendron root rot, and ink disease in the European chestnut * The paraphyletic Pythium group is more prevalent than Phytophthora and individual species have larger host ranges, although usually causing less damage. Pythium damping off is a very common problem in greenhouses, where the organism kills newly emerged seedlings. Mycoparasitic members of this group (e.g. P. oligandrum) parasitize other oomycetes and fungi, and have been employed as biocontrol agents. One Pythium species, Pythium insidiosum, also causes Pythiosis in mammals. * The third group are the downy mildews, which are easily identifiable by the appearance of white, brownish or olive \\"mildew\\" on the leaf undersides (although this group can be confused with the unrelated fungal powdery mildews). * The fourth group are the white blister rusts, Albuginales, which cause white blister disease on a variety of flowering plants. White blister rusts sporulate beneath the epidermis of their hosts, causing spore-filled blisters on stems, leaves and the inflorescence. The Albuginales are currently divided into three genera, Albugo parasitic predominantly to Brassicales, Pustula, parasitic predominantly to Asterales, and Wilsoniana, predominantly parasitic to Caryophyllales. Like the downy mildews, the white blister rusts are obligate biotrophs, which means that they are unable to survive without the presence of a living host.

This catch-all term covers many people: tour managers, production managers, stage managers, front of house and monitor engineers, lighting directors, lighting designers, lighting techs, guitar techs, bass techs, drum techs, keyboard techs, pyrotechnicians, security/bodyguards, truck drivers, merchandise crew, and caterers, among others. Road crew appearances The road crew are generally uncredited, though many bands take care to thank their crew in album sleeve liner notes. In some cases, roadies have stepped in to help out with playing onstage. *On June 12, 1993, while performing \\"Bullet in the Head\\" in Reykjavik, Iceland, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello and bassist Tim Commerford switched out with their guitar and bass technicians, respectively. *The Doobie Brothers' lighting roadie, Bobby LaKind, eventually became a full member of the band. After observing LaKind goofing around on the congas after a concert, the band took notice of his talent and asked him to join as a sideman for studio sessions in 1976. He became a full member in 1979 and performed as a vocalist, songwriter, percussionist and backup drummer for live shows. *Pink Floyd listed theirs on the rear sleeve of Ummagumma and recorded them speaking on The Dark Side of the Moon.

It operated charter flights to the Dominican Republic from Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport in San Juan, Rafael Hern√°ndez Airport in Aguadilla and Eugenio Mar√≠a de Hostos Airport in Mayag√ºez. The airline has now ceased operations. History The airline was established in 2003 by Lazaro Canto (Founder and Chief Executive). In the June 7 edition of the newspaper El Vocero, the management of Fina Air announced that the airline would begin flying on July 15, 2003, connecting San Juan and Mayag√ºez with six Dominican Republic destinations. The airline planned to expand to other countries within the Caribbean by 2005 and acquire jet aircraft. The July 15 date, however, was later changed to October 2. The 2005 expectations for acquiring jets and opening new routes were never met. Services Apart from operating regularly scheduled services from Aguadilla, they also rented airplanes to United States immigration services, to return illegal immigrants from the Dominican Republic back home. Fina Air was partnered with the U.S. group called Viva Airlines. The people involved left a list of unpaid debts, lawsuits, and unhappy investors after the death of Chief Executive Officer Lazaro Canto. Fleet The Fina Air fleet of 3 Saab 340 aircraft have been purchased by an aircraft leasing company and were later operated by RegionsAir as Continental Connection, flying out of Cleveland. The airline did try to purchase 2 McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 aircraft but the purchase was cancelled. After several flights cancelled from July to August 2005, the airline Fina Air conducted an activity in the Dominican Republic to compensate customers affected in the months of December and January, which granted money in cash awards and added works of art by members of the Oro S√≥lido music band and by Johnny Ventura, all customers signed documents stating that they were pleased with the agreed compensation. One of Fina Air's SAAB 340 airplanes later crashed in Argentina, as Sol L√≠neas A√©reas Flight 5428. Livery Because Puerto Rico is politically a part of the United States, Fina Air (not to be confused with the cargo airline Fine Air), had the American flag painted on their planes' fuselages. However, most of Fina Air planes carried the colors of the Puerto Rican flag.

Lemmon. This program was originally designed to run under Windows 95. All future development of the program was ceased in 2003 just one year before its author's death on 1 May 2004; even so, Proxomitron is still viable and used on modern Windows platforms such as Vista and Windows 10. Premise The program is generally used to block pop-ups and banners, to remove embedded sounds and animation from web pages, to alter or block JavaScript, and to modify the appearance and content of web pages.  Overview  Properly configured, Proxomitron intercepts HTTP traffic between the user's browser and web servers. The program is capable of altering web page content by removing or adding text. Additionally, it can add, modify, or delete HTTP message headers, be configured to block connections or redirect requests based on the web page address, and be configured to route connections through a remote proxy. The user can monitor connections and filter activations, if desired. Program operation is dictated through the use of a configuration file containing specialized filters which can be written, edited, deleted, enabled or disabled by the user via the program's graphical user interface. (Third- party filters can also be imported, or \\"merged,\\" into the configuration.) The filters utilize a \\"matching\\" language similar to the standard regular expressions used in text editing. Additional files, such as \\"blocklists\\" and SSL DLLs, can extend filtering capabilities. Use of the program requires knowledge of the Proxomitron scripting language, and some familiarity with at least one of HTTP, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The scripting interface was not designed to be user-friendly. Because of these complications, the program can be difficult to customize for novice or non-technical users. A default set of filters is included with the program; advanced filters and filter sets written by experienced users are also available online. (See external links.)  Features  The following items are the basic applications and features of the program: ; Filter page content : Using the scripting language, filters are prepared with editing commands to match and replace text in the downloaded page. Specific pages can be targeted for filtering by matching the page's URL with a specified pattern. ; Filter HTTP headers : Separate filters for incoming and outgoing HTTP headers can be used to modify the values of existing headers, add new headers, or delete headers. One example of such usage would be for cookie management. ; Variables : Filters can use local variables (per filter) or global variables (available to all filters per request) to capture/store text for further test matching, to reinsert content into a new location, or to write content to lists. Preset variables are also available, e.g., the page's URL. ; Special commands : A number of special commands are available for use by filters or in URLs; e.g., a filter-based command can check if the user presses a particular key, or a URL-embedded command can direct Proxomitron to filter a local file. ; Create lists for filters : Text files (known as \\"blocklists\\") can be used as sources for patterns for filter matches. ; Create standard lists : Text files (known as \\"logfiles\\") can be used by filters to append captured data to a list. ; Create session lists : Memory-only text files can be generated and used by filters to build temporary blocklists, or permanent blocklists can be configured to only allow filters to add memory-only \\"session\\" data. ; Insert files : Local text files containing plain text, HTML snippits, css, or scripts can be independently retrieved and written into the web page by filters. ; Reroute traffic : Filters can redirect requests to different web pages or to local files, either by sending the new location as a directive to the browser or by \\"transparently\\" connecting to the new location directly. ; View traffic between server and browser : The log window permits the user to see the HTTP traffic between the browser and server. This can (optionally) include any POSTed data. ; Provide alerts : Filters can be configured to have Proxomitron generate its own alert or confirmation popup containing user-supplied text. ; Uncompress data on the fly : With the ZLIB library, the Proxomitron can uncompress GZIP compressed data streams and filter pages delivered in compressed modes. ; Filter \\"secure\\" channels : With libraries to provide the SSL routines, the Proxomitron can filter secure, encoded streams. Since this forces the proxy to act as a \\"man in the middle\\", this should not be used in most cases. ; Chain to remote proxies : Proxomitron can test remote proxies, maintain a list of proxies to utilize, and be configured to rotate the remote proxy connections. ; Run program or URL : Proxomitron can be configured to launch an external program or URL (as specified in the program settings) upon startup, or on demand via the Launch icon or a menu option. Launching programs and URLs from filters can also be accomplished through the use of an undocumented $EXEC command. ; Change interface textures : The user can select bitmap images (referred to as \\"textures\\") for tiling interface backgrounds and button and tab faces, or simply disable this feature. An internal set of default bitmaps (admittedly \\"psychedelic\\") are included with the program. ; Debug : A special viewing of the page source showing which filters matched what page content can be sent to the browser for debugging purposes. A test window is also available from the filter editor dialogs for testing matches and checking filter efficiency. License The program was distributed under a \\"ShonenWare\\" license; it was free to use, but if the user purchased a Shonen Knife CD and convinced Lemmon that he or she had listened to it, then Lemmon would consider that to be sufficient to register that user.  History  The first public release of Proxomitron (Naoko 2) was in 1999 as a download via Simtel. Releases that followed were all named \\"Naoko\\" (for Naoko Yamano) followed by a release number. (Release versions were 3, 3(b), 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5.) The May 2003 release of Naoko 4.5 was followed very quickly by the removal of the program's web site and Lemmon's declared termination of continued development of Proxomitron. A subsequent release, however, was made in June 2003, primarily to revert a new behavior related to remote proxy connections that had been designed into the May version. After the release of Naoko 4.5 (June), development was permanently discontinued and the official site had the message: This reads in Japanese and translates to \\"it went out\\" or \\"gone.\\" The original home webpage is no longer accessible. Lemmon's mirror redirect was changed to display a different final message from the author a short time later. The author, Scott R. Lemmon, died 1 May 2004 at age of 36.  Current status  As this was a closed-source project, Proxomitron is no longer being maintained or developed; however, the Proxomitron program is still functional, and there is a community of users who provide support for it through electronic forums. Filters, filter sets, compatible DLLs and other files, and GUI patches to restyle and/or update Proxomitron's graphical user interface are also being provided by users. Many current browsers do contain features similar to those provided by Proxomitron filters ‚Äì blocking advertisements and pop-ups, for example. Other browser features or add-ons, such as Greasemonkey for Firefox and user stylesheets for Firefox and other browsers via the Stylish addon, also allow for local modification of web pages.

They are each syntheses of African, European, Indian and Indigenous influences, largely created by descendants of African slaves (see Afro-Caribbean music), along with contributions from other communities (such as Indo-Caribbean music). Some of the styles to gain wide popularity outside the Caribbean include, bachata, merenque, palo, mombo, denbo, baithak gana, bouyon, cadence-lypso, calypso, chutney, chutney-soca, compas, dancehall, jing ping, parang, pichakaree, punta, ragga, reggae, reggaeton, salsa, soca, and zouk. Caribbean is also related to Central American and South American music. The history of Caribbean music originates from the history of the Caribbean itself. That history is one of the native land invaded by outsiders; violence, slavery, and even genocide factor in. Following Christopher Columbus' 1492 landing, Spain claimed the entire region as its own. That didn't sit well with either the natives or Spain's European neighbors; within a few years, bloody battles raged across the islands of the Caribbean, fought by Spain, France, England, Denmark, and the Netherlands. All these battles (and diseases brought from Europe) decimated the native tribes, with entire cultures wiped out. Thus the Caribbean was colonized as part of the various European empires. the native culture was further eroded when the Europeans imported African slaves to work the sugar and coffee plantations on their island colonies. in many cases, the native cultures -and the native musics- were replaced with those brought over from Africa. At this point, whatever common Caribbean culture existed was splintered. Each of the European powers carved out their own cultures on their respective islands. Even with the ending of colonial period, this is the Caribbean we have today - a series of subtly different cultures from island to island. This island-specific culture also informs the music of the Caribbean. Every island has its distinct musical styles, all inspired, to one degree or another, by the music brought over from the African slaves. As such, most Caribbean music, however unique to its own island culture, includes elements of African music - heavy use of percussion instruments, complex rhythmic patterns, and call-and-response vocals. That said, it's important to recognize the musical styles unique to each island. In many cases, the difference between one style and another comes down to the rhythms utilized in each music; there is almost a different rhythm for every island. The complex deep origins of Caribbean music are understood with a knowledge of Western Hemisphere colonial immigration patterns, human trafficking patterns, the resulting melting pot of people each of its nations and territories, and thus resulting influx of original musical influences. Colonial Caribbean ancestors were predominantly from West Africa, West Europe, and India. In the 20th and 21st centuries immigrants have also come from Taiwan, China, Indonesia/Java, and the Middle East. In addition, neighboring Latin American and North American (particularly hip hop and pop music) countries have naturally influenced Caribbean culture and vice versa. One must understand these influences to have a deep understanding of the resulting Caribbean music that reflects the culture of the people. Although there are musical commonalities among Caribbean nations and territories, the variation in immigration patterns and colonial hegemony tend to parallel the variations in musical influence. Language barriers (Spanish, Portuguese, English, Hindustani, Tamil, Telugu, Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Yiddish, Yoruba, African languages, Indian languages, Amerindian languages, French, Indonesian, Javanese, and Dutch) are one of the strongest influences. The divisions between Caribbean music genres are not always well-defined, because many of these genres share common relations and have influenced each other in many ways and directions. For example, the Jamaican mento style has a long history of conflation with Trinidadian calypso. Elements of calypso have come to be used in mento, and vice versa, while their origins lie in the Afro-Caribbean culture, each uniquely characterized by influences from the Shango and Shouters religions of Trinidad and the Kumina spiritual tradition of Jamaica. Music from the Spanish-speaking areas of the Caribbean are classified as tropical music in the Latin music industry. Antigua and Barbuda =Benna= Benna is an uptempo Antiguan folk song, also spelled bennah and known as ditti. It is characterized by lyrics that focus on scandalous gossip, performed in a call and response style. It has also been a means of folk communication, spreading news and political commentary across the island.

It is led by a single singer, who improvises. Lyrics often concern local figures and events of importance. Quimbe is a topical song form from the Dutch Antillean St Maarten. It traditionally accompanies the ponum dance and drumming, but is now often performed without accompaniment. Lyrics include gossip, news and social criticism, and use clever puns and rhymes. Performance is often competitive in nature. Tumba is a style of Cura√ßao music, strongly African in origin, despite the name's origin in a 17th-century Spanish dance. Traditional tumba is characterized by scandalous, gossiping and accusatory lyrics, but modern tumba often eschews such topics. It is well known abroad, and dates to the early 19th century. It is now a part of the Carnival Road March.

Other genres include: * Chutney * Chutney Soca * Dancehall *Calypso Haiti =Compas / kompa= Compas, short for compas direct, is the modern m√©ringue (mereng in creole) that was popularized in the mid-1950s by the sax and guitar player Nemours Jean-Baptiste. His m√©ringue soon became popular throughout the Antilles, especially in Martinique and Guadeloupe. Webert Sicot and Nemours Jean-Baptiste became the two leaders in the group. Sicot then left and formed a new group and an intense rivalry developed, though they remained good friends. To differentiate himself from Nemours, Sicot called his modern m√©ringue, Cadence rampa. In Creole, it is spelled as konpa dir√®k or simply konpa. It is commonly spelled as it is pronounced as kompa. =M√©ringue= Evolving in Haiti during the mid-1800s, the Haitian m√©ringue (known as the mereng in creole) is regarded as the oldest surviving form of its kind performed today and is its national symbol. According to Jean Fouchard, mereng evolved from the fusion of slave music genres (such as the chica and calenda) with ballroom forms related to the French-Haitian contredanse (kontradans in creole). Mereng's name, he says, derives from the mouringue music of the Bara, a tribe of Madagascar. That few Malagasies came to the Americas casts doubt on this etymology, but it is significant because it emphasizes what Fouchard (and most Haitians) consider the African-derived nature of their music and national identity. M√©ringue has lost popularity to konpa. =Mizik rasin= Mizik rasin is a musical movement that began in Ha√Øti in 1987 when musicians began combining elements of traditional Haitian Vodou ceremonial and folkloric music with rock and roll. This style of modern music reaching back to the roots of Vodou tradition came to be called mizik rasin (\\"roots music\\") in Haitian Creole or musique racine in French. In context, the movement is often referred to simply as rasin or racine. Starting in the late 1970s (with discontent surrounding the increasing opulence of the Duvalier dictatorship), youth from Port-au-Prince (and to a lesser extent Cap-Ha√Øtien and other urban areas) began experimenting with new types of life. Fran√ßois Duvalier's appropriation of Vodou images as a terror technique, the increase in U.S. assembly and large-scale export agriculture, the popularity of disco, and Jean-Claude Duvalier's appreciation of konpa and chanson fran√ßaise disillusioned many youth and love. To question the dictatorship's notion of \\"the Haitian nation\\" (and thus the dictatorship itself), several men began trying a new way of living, embodied in the Sanba Movement. They drew upon global trends in black power, Bob Marley, \\"Hippie\\"-dom, as well as prominently from rural life in Haiti. They dressed in the traditional blue denim (karoko) of peasants, eschewed the commercialized and processed life offered by global capitalism, and celebrated the values of communal living. Later, they adopted matted hair which resembled dreadlocks, but identified the style as something which existed in Haiti with the term cheve simbi, referring to water spirits. In the 1990s, commercial success came to the musical genre that came to be known as mizik rasin, or \\"roots music\\". Musicians like Boukman Eksperyans, and Boukan Ginen, and to a lesser extent RAM, incorporated reggae, rock and funk rhythms into traditional forms and instrumentation, including rara, music from kanaval, or traditional spiritual music from the rural hamlets called lakous, like Lakou Souvnans, Lakou Badjo, Lakou Soukri, or Lakou Dereyal. =Twoubadou= Twoubadou is another form of folk music played by peripatetic troubadours playing some combination of acoustic, guitar, beat box and accordion instruments singing ballads of Haitian, French or Caribbean origin. It is in some ways similar to Son Cubano from Cuba as a result of Haitian migrant laborers who went to work on Cuban sugar plantations at the turn of the century. Musicians perform at the Port-au-Prince International Airport and also at bars and restaurants in P√©tion-Ville. =Other= * Cadence rampa (kadans) * Coumbite (kombite) * Haitian Gospel * Haitian hip hop (rap krey√≤l) * Haitian rock (rock krey√≤l) * Kontradans * Mini-jazz * Rab√≤day * Rara * Rara tech * Vodou drumming * Zouk  Honduras  The music of Honduras is varied.

While sometimes used in a broader sense to refer to most types of Jamaican music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that originated following on the development of ska and rocksteady. Ska is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s, and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and calypso with American jazz and rhythm and blues. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the upbeat. Mento is a form of Jamaican folk music that uses topical lyrics with a humorous slant, commenting on poverty and other social issues. Sexual innuendos are also common. Mento was strongly influenced by calypso, the musical traditions of the Kumina religion and Cuban music. During the mid-20th century, mento was conflated with calypso, and mento was frequently referred to as calypso, kalypso and mento calypso; mento singers frequently used calypso songs and techniques.

Jw√© uses raunchy lyrics and innuendos to show off verbal skills, and to express political and comedic commentaries on current events and well-known individuals. One well-known technique that has entered Lucian culture is lang d√©viv√©, which is when the singer says the opposite of his true meaning. Other genres include: * Calypso * Extempo * Kont * Soca * Zouk * Dancehall * Dub * Reggae Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Big Drum is a style found in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and elsewhere in the Windward Islands, especially Carriacou. It is accompanied by drums traditionally made from tree trunks, though rum kegs are now more common. Satirical and political lyrics are common, performed by a female singer called a chantwell and accompanied by colorfully costumed dancers. Big Drum is performed at celebrations like weddings and the launchings of new boats. Chutney-soca is another genre. Suriname Kaseko is a music genre that originated in Suriname. The term Kaseko is probably derived from the French expression casser le corps (break the body), which was used during slavery to indicate a very swift dance. It is a fusion of numerous popular and folk styles. It is rhythmically complex, with percussion instruments including skratji (a very large bass drum). Songs are typically call-and-response. Other genres include: * Baithak Gana * Indo- Caribbean * Aleke * Kawina Trinidad and Tobago =Calypso= Calypso is a Trinidadian music, which traditionally uses a slow tempo to accompany vocalist-composers, or calypsonians. Songs are often improvised and humorous, with sexual innuendo, political and social commentary, and picong, a style of lyricism that teases people in a light-hearted way. Calypso is competitively performed in calypso tents at Carnival. Calypso uses rhythms derived from West Africa, with cut time, and features dance as an important component. Calypso's roots were frequently ascribed to the Bahamas, Jamaica, Bermuda or the Virgin Islands. Calypso can be traced back to at least 1859, when a visiting ornithologist in Trinidad ascribed calypso's origins in British ballads. and While calypso has a diverse heritage, calypso became a distinct genre when it developed in Trinidad. The word caliso refers to topical songs in the dialect of Saint Lucia, and may be linguistically related to the word calypso. =Cariso= Cariso is a kind of Trinidadian folk music, and an important ancestor of calypso music. It is lyrically topical, and frequently sarcastic or mocking in the picong tradition, and is sung primarily in French creole by singers called chantwells. Cariso may come from carieto, a Carib word meaning joyous song, and can also be used synonymously with careso. =Chutney= Chutney is a form indigenous to the southern Caribbean, popular in Guyana, Trinidad, Jamaica and Suriname. It derives elements from traditional Indian music and popular Trinidadian Soca music. =Soca= Soca is a style of Caribbean music originating in Trinidad and Tobago. Soca originally combined the melodic lilting sound of calypso with insistent cadence percussion (which is often electronic in recent music), and Indian musical instruments‚Äîparticularly the dholak, tabla and dhantal‚Äîas demonstrated in Shorty's classic compositions \\"√èndrani\\" and \\"Shanti Om\\". During the 80's, the influence of zouk as popularized by the French Antillean band Kassav' had a major impact on the development of modern soca music. =Other= * Afrosoca * Chut-kai-pang * Chutney-soca * Caribbean pop * Gospelypso * Indo-Caribbean * Kaiso * Pan music * Parang * Pichakaree * Rapso * Yahdees Venezuela * Musica llanera * Merengue * Gaita * Tambores Virgin Islands =Careso= *Careso is a Virgin Islander song form, which is now entirely performed for special holiday and appreciation or education events, by folkloric ensembles. It is similar to quelbe in some ways, but has more sustained syllables, a more African melodic style and an all female, call and response format with lyrics that function as news and gossip communicator, also commemorating and celebrating historical events. =Other= * Scratch band * Bamboula * Masquerade music =Quelbe= Quelbe is a form of Virgin Islander folk music that originated on St. Croix, now most commonly performed by groups called scratch bands. Traditionally, however, quelbe was performed informally by solo singers at festivals and other celebrations. Hidden meanings and sexual innuendos were common, and lyrics focused on political events like boycotts.

multinational consumer electronics and commercial electronics manufacturing company headquartered in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan. Its products include calculators, mobile phones, digital cameras, electronic musical instruments, and analogue and digital watches. It was founded in 1946, and in 1957 introduced the world's first entirely electric compact calculator. It was an early digital camera innovator, and during the 1980s and 1990s the company developed numerous affordable home electronic keyboards for musicians along with introducing the world's first mass-produced digital watches. History Casio was established as Kashio Seisakujo in April 1946 by Tadao Kashio (Ê®´Â∞æÂø†ÈõÑ 1917‚Äì1993), an engineer specializing in fabrication technology. Kashio's first major product was the yubiwa pipe, a finger ring that would hold a cigarette, allowing the wearer to smoke the cigarette down to its nub while also leaving the wearer's hands-free. Japan was impoverished immediately following World War II, so cigarettes were valuable, and the invention was a success. After seeing the electric calculators at the first Business Show in Ginza, Tokyo in 1949, Kashio and his younger brothers (Toshio, Kazuo, and Yukio) used their profits from the yubiwa pipe to develop their calculators. Most of the calculators at that time worked using gears and could be operated by hand using a crank or using a motor (see adding machine). Toshio possessed some knowledge of electronics and set out to make a calculator using solenoids. The desk-sized calculator was finished in 1954 and was Japan's first electro- mechanical calculator. One of the central and more important innovations of the calculator was its adoption of the 10-key number pad; at that time other calculators were using a \\"full keypad\\", which meant that each place in the number (1s, 10s, 100s, etc ...) had nine keys. Another distinguishing innovation was the use of a single display window instead of the three display windows (one for each argument and one for the answer) used in other calculators. Casio Computer Co., Ltd. was formed in June 1957. That year, Casio released the Model 14-A, sold for 485,000 yen,Casio desktop calculator by Dentaku Museum. the world's first all-electric compact calculator, which was based on relay technology. In the 1980s, Casio's budget electronic instruments and its line of affordable home electronic musical keyboard instruments became popular. The company also became well known for the wide variety and innovation of its wristwatches. It was one of the earliest manufacturers of quartz watches, both digital and analog. It also began selling calculator watches during this time. Casio also introduced one of the first watches that could display the time in many different time zones of the world and with features like recording temperature, atmospheric-pressure and altitude. In the later years, Casio's wristwatches were fitted with receivers to synchronise with radio towers around the world and Global Positioning System for timekeeping accuracy. A number of notable digital camera innovations have also been made by Casio, including the QV-10, the first consumer digital camera with a liquid-crystal display (LCD) on the back (developed by a team led by Hiroyuki Suetaka in 1995), the first consumer three-megapixel camera, the first true ultra-compact model, and the first digital camera to incorporate ceramic lens technology, using Lumicera. = Price fixing = In July 2019, the company's UK arm, Casio Electronics Co. Ltd , was fined ¬£3.7 million after admitting resale price maintenance (a form of price-fixing) between 2013 and 2018, in breach of the United Kingdom's Competition Act 1998. Products Casio's products include watches, calculators, electronic keyboards and other digital products such as digital cameras (Exilim series), film cameras, cash registers, laptops and sub- notebook computers, mobile phones, PDAs (E-Data Bank), electronic dictionaries, digital diaries (early PDAs), electronic games, computer printers, clocks, and portable televisions. In the 1970s and 80s, Casio was best known for its electronic (including scientific) calculators, electronic musical instruments and affordable digital watches incorporating innovative technology. Today, Casio is most commonly known for making durable and reliable electronic products.Review: Casio:History The G-Shock range of shock- resistant watches is also very popular, with the original 1983 G-Shock DW-5000C being highly sought-after by collectors. The scientific calculators made by Casio especially the CLASSWIZ series of calculators are known for being affordable while incorporating a host of functions as compared to their competitors. Casio also makes products for local markets, including \\"Prayer Compass\\" watch series designed to help Muslims pray on time and in the right direction. =Calculators= Scientific calculators Casio fx-991EX \\"CLASSWIZ\\" scientific calculator Casio calculators include: * Graphing ** FX-9860G / GII / SD ** FX-9860G Slim ** ClassPad 300 Plus / 330 ** ClassPad II fx-CP400 ** fx-CG10 / 20 / 50 ** fx-CG500 ** Algebra FX 2.0 Plus ** FX 1.0 Plus ** CFX-9850GC Plus ** CFX-9850GB Plus ** CFX-9800G ** fx-9750G Plus / GII ** fx-8500G, 8000G ** fx-7500G, 7400G Plus / GII ** fx-7000G (ca. 1985) ** VI-9850GB Plus ** RM 7000/9000 * Programming ** fx-5800P, 3950P, fx-3650P, 50F Plus (2000s) ** fx-4500PA, 4500P ** fx-5500LA, 5500L ** fx-3900PV, 3900P (1990s) ** fx-4800P ** fx-3600P (1980s) ** fx-4000P, 3500P, 3800P, fx-5000F, 50F (late 1980s) ** FX-850P ** FX-702P (ca. 1981) ** FX-603P, FX-602P (1981) ** fx-180P, 390PV (Program) (early 1980s), fx-180PV, ** FX-502P, 501P (ca. 1979) * Professional ** fx-FD10 Pro (2014) (Surveying calculator for civil engineering) * V.P.A.M.

branches. The first of this gens to obtain the consulship was Manius Tullius Longus in 500 BC, but the most illustrious of the family was Marcus Tullius Cicero, the statesman, orator, and scholar of the first century BC. The earliest of the Tullii who appear in history were patrician, but all of the Tullii mentioned in later times were plebeian, and some of them were descended from freedmen.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography & Mythology, vol. III, p. 1183 (\\"Tullia Gens\\"). The English form Tully, often found in older works, especially in reference to Cicero, is now considered antiquated. Origin The nomen Tullius is a patronymic surname, derived from the old Latin praenomen Tullus, probably from a root meaning to support, bear, or help.Chase, pp. 145, 146. The Tullii of the Republic sometimes claimed descent from Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome, who according to some traditions was the son of Servius Tullius, a prince of Corniculum who was slain in battle against the Romans under Lucius Tarquinius Priscus, the fifth Roman king.Cicero, Brutus, 62, Tusculanae Quaestiones, i. 16. However, the Roman historians report that the Tullii were one of the Alban noble families that came to Rome after the destruction of their city during the reign of Tullus Hostilius, the third King of Rome.Livy, i. 30. This would probably make the Tullii one of the gentes minores, the lesser patrician houses of the Republic.Wiseman, \\"Legendary Genealogies\\", p. 158. Praenomina The main praenomina used by the Tullii were Marcus and Lucius. To these, the Tullii Cicerones added Quintus. Manius is found only among the patrician Tullii at the beginning of the Republic, and there are individual instances of Sextus and Tiberius. Branches and cognomina The patrician Tullii bore the cognomen Longus, tall, but only one of them appears in history.Chase, p. 110. The notable plebeian families bore the surnames Decula and Cicero. The latter, among the most famous of Roman cognomina, belongs to a common class of surnames derived from familiar objects.Chase, p. 113. This family came from Arpinum, the inhabitants of which were granted Roman citizenship in 188 BC. Plutarch reports that the surname was given to an ancestor of the orator, who had a cleft in the tip of his nose in the shape of a chickpea, or cicer. At the beginning of his career, Cicero was urged to adopt a more auspicious surname, but he declined, stating that he would make the name famous.Plutarch, The Life of Cicero, 1. Most other surnames found with the Tullii of the Republic belonged to freedmen, but a number of the family bore no cognomen.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 707, 708 (\\"Cicero\\"). Members =Early Tullii= * Servius Tullius, according to one tradition, the prince of Corniculum, husband of Ocrisia, and father of Servius Tullius, the sixth King of Rome, fell in battle when Corniculum was taken by Lucius Tarquinius Priscus.Livy, i. 39.Dionysius, iv. 1, 2. * Servius Tullius Ser. f., the sixth King of Rome, traditionally reigned from 578 to 534 BC. He is said to have defeated Veii, enlarged the sacred boundary of Rome, and enclosed the city with a stone wall, established the Temple of Diana, and an alliance with the Latins, and undertook significant reforms of the Roman constitution, establishing the Comitia Centuriata and the Servian tribes.Ovid, Fasti, vi. 573 ff, 625 ff.Valerius Maximus, i. 8 ¬ß 11.Dionysius, iv. 1‚Äì40.Cicero, De Republica, ii. 21, 22.Livy, i. 39‚Äì48.Zonaras, vii. 9.Niebuhr, History of Rome, vol. i, pp. 249, 398 ff.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 1184‚Äì1190 (\\"Servius Tullius\\"). * Marcus Tullius, one of the duumviri sacris faciundis in the reign of Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and last King of Rome, was paid by a certain Petronius Sabinus to allow him to copy one of the Sibylline books. The king punished Tullius by having him sewn into a leather sack, and cast into the sea.Valerius Maximus, i. 1. ¬ß 13.Dionysius, iv. 62. * Manius Tullius Longus, consul in 500 BC, besieged the city of Fidenae when its inhabitants revolted, but withdrew his army when the Fidenates sought to negotiate a peace. He and his colleague then suppressed a conspiracy to restore the Tarquins. While opening the Ludi Romani, Tullius was badly injured when he fell from his chariot. He died three days later.Livy, ii. 19.Dionysius, v. 52‚Äì57.Zonaras, vii. 13.Cicero, Brutus, 16. * Manius Tullius Tolerinus, according to Festus, one of several persons burned at the Circus Maximus in 486 BC, possibly on the charge of conspiring with Spurius Cassius Viscellinus.Festus, 180 L.Valerius Maximus, vi. 3. ¬ß 2. * Attius Tullius, a leader of the Volscians early in the fifth century BC, who gave shelter to Gaius Marcius Coriolanus following his exile from Rome, and encouraged him to take up arms against the Romans.Livy, ii. 35‚Äì40.Dionysius, viii. 1‚Äì5, 10‚Äì13.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Coriolanus\\", 22, 23, 26‚Äì28, 31, 39.Niebuhr, History of Rome, vol. ii, note. 217. * Sextus Tullius, a centurion primus pilus in 358 BC, sought permission from the dictator Gaius Sulpicius Peticus to engage the Gauls in battle. He and his colleagues fought with conspicuous bravery. His martial prowess was displayed again in the following year, when he served under the consul Gaius Marcius Rutilus at Privernum.Livy, vii. 13‚Äì16. =Tullii Cicerones= * Marcus Tullius Cicero, grandfather of the orator, was one of the leading men of Arpinum. In 115 BC, the consul Marcus Aemilius Scaurus complimented him on his industry and foresight when he and his brother-in-law, Marcus Gratidius, petitioned on behalf of their city for the right to vote by ballot.Cicero, De Legibus, ii. 1, iii. 16, De Oratore, ii. 66. * Marcus Tullius M. f. Cicero, father of the orator Cicero, was a learned man of literary interests, and moved to Rome in order to provide the best of education for his sons. He kept company with the leading orators and jurists of his day, and died in 64 BC, the year his son was elected consul.Cicero, De Legibus, ii. 1, De Oratore, ii. 1, De Officiis, iii. 19, Epistulae ad Atticum, i. 6. * Lucius Tullius M. f. Cicero, uncle of the orator, was a close friend of Marcus Antonius, the orator, with whom he traveled to Cilicia during the latter's government there. He provided his nephew with regular correspondence for a number of years.Cicero, De Oratore, ii. 1. * Marcus Tullius M. f. M. n. Cicero, the orator, was consul in 63 BC, when he suppressed the conspiracy of Catiline, although he was later exiled for having put the conspirators to death without a trial. After his recall, he generally opposed the first triumvirate, and Caesar in particular, although Caesar deeply admired him, and gladly pardoned him for siding with his enemies. He played no part in Caesar's assassination, but was widely viewed as sympathetic to the murderers, and placed himself in opposition to the second triumvirate, by which he was proscribed and put to death. Cicero was the most eminent of the Roman orators, and one of the leading scholars of Roman history and institutions. His vast body of surviving speeches, treatises, and correspondence forms one of the most important sources of Roman history.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, pp. 708‚Äì746. * Quintus Tullius M. f. M. n. Cicero, the younger brother of Cicero, was praetor in 62 BC, and subsequently governor of Asia. He was one of Caesar's generals during the Gallic Wars, but later supported Pompeius during the Civil War. After Caesar's murder, he was proscribed and put to death by the triumvirs. * Lucius Tullius L. f. M. n. Cicero, the cousin and close friend of the orator, whom he accompanied to Athens in 79 BC, and assisted during the trial of Verres. The people of Syracuse honoured him for his efforts on their behalf. Marcus was deeply aggrieved when Lucius died in 68, while still a young man.Cicero, De Finibus, v. 1, In Verrem, iv. 11, 61, 64, 65, Epistulae ad Atticum, i. 5. * Tullia M. f. M. n., or Tulliola, the beloved daughter of Cicero, married first Gaius Calpurnius Piso Frugi, who died in 57 BC, then briefly to Furius Crassipes, whom she divorced, then in 50 to Publius Cornelius Dolabella, by whom she had two sons; one who died in infancy, and another, Lentulus, who probably died in childhood. Tullia and Dolabella were divorced before the birth of their second son, and she died shortly afterward, to her father's great sorrow.Orelli, Onomasticon Tullianum, vol. ii., pp. 596, 597.Drumann, Geschichte Roms, vol. vi, pp. 696 ff. * Quintus Tullius Q. f. M. n. Cicero, son of Quintus Cicero, attempted to hide his father from the triumvirs, and was tortured, then put to death along with his father, who gave himself up in the hope of saving his son. * Marcus Tullius M. f. M. n. Cicero, son of the orator, joined the liberatores, Brutus and Cassius after the murder of his father and uncle in the proscription of the triumvirs. He obtained the pardon of Octavian after the Battle of Philippi, and later took his side against Marcus Antonius. He was consul in 30 BC. =Others= * Publius Tullius Albinovanus, a partisan of Marius, whom Sulla outlawed in 88 BC. Later a legate of Gaius Norbanus, Albinovanus obtained Sulla's pardon by inviting Norbanus' chief officers to a banquet, where he treacherously murdered them, then betrayed Ariminium to Sulla's forces.Appian, Bellum Civile, i. 60, 62, 91.Florus, iii. 21. ¬ß 7. * Marcus Tullius Decula, consul in 81 BC, during the dictatorship of Sulla.Cicero, De Lege Agraria, ii. 14.Gellius, xv. 28.Appian, Bellum Civile, i. 100. * Marcus Tullius, claimed that his neighbor, Publius Fabius, with whom he was engaged in a property dispute, had murdered several of his slaves. Cicero spoke on his behalf in a partially-preserved speech. He does not seem to be identified with any of the other Marci Tullii known from this period of history.Drumann, Geschichte Roms, vol. v, pp. 258 ff. * Lucius Tullius, an eques, was leader of those who collected the taxes from the scriptura, the cattle grazed upon public land, in Sicily in the time of Verres.Cicero, In Verrem, iii. 71. * Lucius Tullius, a friend of Titus Pomponius Atticus, served as a legate under Cicero during his government of Cilicia. Cicero did not consider his performance adequate.Cicero, Epistulae ad Atticum, v. 4, 11, 14, 21, Epistulae ad Familiares, xv. 14. ¬ß 8. * Marcus Tullius M. l. Tiro, a scribe and freedman of Cicero, became a notable author in his own right. He wrote on the Latin language, and a life of Cicero, which has been lost; he may have been the chief compiler and preserver of Cicero's correspondence. He was credited with inventing a variety of shorthand, and to have lived to the age of one hundred.Gellius, xiii. 9.Cicero, Epistulae ad Familiares, liber xvi, Epistulae ad Atticum, iv. 6, vi. 7, vii. 2, 3, 5, xiii. 7, xvi. 5.Martial, Epigrammata, xiv. 202.Manilius, Astronomica, iv. 197.Seneca the Younger, Epistulae, 90.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Cicero\\", 41, 49.Drumann, Geschichte Roms, vol. vi, p. 409. * Marcus Tullius M. f.

Roman gentes ","title":"Tullia gens"},{"id":"245073","text":"The School of Night is a modern name for a group of men centred on Sir Walter Raleigh that was once referred to in 1592 as the \\"School of Atheism\\". The group supposedly included poets and scientists Christopher Marlowe, George Chapman, Matthew Roydon and Thomas Harriot. There is no firm evidence that all of these men were known to each other, but speculation about their connections features prominently in some writing about the Elizabethan era. Name Robert Persons SJ, who denounced Raleigh's \\"School of atheism\\" Raleigh was first named as the centre of \\"The School of Atheism\\" by the Jesuit priest Robert Persons in 1592, but \\"The School of Night\\" is a modern name: the theory that this so-called school was a clandestine intellectual coterie was launched by Arthur Acheson, on textual grounds, in Shakespeare and the Rival Poet (1903). The new wording derives from a passage in Act IV, scene 3 of Shakespeare's Love's Labours Lost, in which the King of Navarre says \\"Black is the badge of hell / The hue of dungeons and the school of night.\\" Acheson's proposal was endorsed by notable editors John Dover Wilson and Arthur Quiller Couch in their 1923 edition of Love's Labours Lost. There are, however, at least two other recorded renderings of the line, one reading \\"suit of night\\" and the other as \\"scowl of night\\". The context of the lines has nothing to do with cabals: the King is simply mocking the black hair of Rosaline, his friend Berowne's lover. John Kerrigan explains that the line is perfectly straightforward as it stands, a riposte to Berowne's praise of his dark-haired mistress as \\"fair\\", and any attempts to load it with topical significance are misleading; the simple meaning of \\"black is the school where night learns to be black\\" is all that is required. In 1936 Frances Yates found an unpublished essay on scholarship by the Earl of Northumberland, an associate of Raleigh and supposed member of the movement, and interpreted the earl's mockery of the \\"precious affectations\\" found among scholars as inspiring the key celibacy theme of the play. The supposition is discounted as fanciful by some, but nonetheless received acceptance by some prominent commentators of the time.Kerrigan (1982): \\"This theory has recently fallen into disrepute‚Ä¶ Still, the notion...persists among readers and theatregoers...and it is worth driving another nail into its coffin.\\" Atheism It is alleged that each of these men studied science, philosophy, and religion, and all were suspected of atheism. Atheism at that time was a charge nearly the equivalent of treason, since the English monarch after Henry VIII's reforms was the head of the Church of England, and to be against the church was, ipso facto, to be against the monarch. However, it was also a name for anarchy, and was a charge frequently brought against the politically troublesome. Richard Baines, an anti-Catholic spy for her Majesty's Privy Council, whose \\"task was presumably to provide his masters with what they required\\", charged in an unsworn deposition that he had heard from another that Marlowe had \\"read the Atheist lecture to Sr. Walter Raleigh [and] others\\". This tale of hearsay, from a paid informer, failed to substantiate the charges of atheism against the group, but it did include a promise of more evidence to be revealed at a later date.\\"an anonymous informer‚Äôs unsupported allegations...hearsay...\\": Kelsall (1981: 8) In culture Since the early 1990s (by which point the School of Night hypothesis had fallen out of mainstream academic favour), the School of Night has frequently been represented in fiction. A play titled The School of Night, by Peter Whelan, dealing with the relationship between Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe, was presented by the Royal Shakespeare Company at The Other Place theatre in November 1992. The School of Night also figures prominently in novels: The Scholars of Night (1988) by John M. Ford, a Cold War thriller involving an undiscovered Christopher Marlowe play; A Dead Man in Deptford (1993) by Anthony Burgess; Veronica (1996) by Nicholas Christopher; The School of Night (2001) by Alan Wall, a story of a present-day researcher who becomes obsessed by connections between Shakespeare's plays and members of the \\"school\\"; The School of Night (2010) by Louis Bayard; and Shadow of Night (2012) by Deborah Harkness. The School of Night is also the name of a group of actors and improvisers inspired by the original group and brought together under the auspices of the celebrated theatrical maverick Ken Campbell. The idea is that this group of poets, playwrights, scientists and thinkers might have collectively written the plays attributed to the Bard. The modern-day School of Night shows feature improvisation in the style of poets and playwrights suggested by the audience, and generally includes the creation (or in the jargon of the show 'channeling') of a lost Shakespearean masterpiece.

She was best known for her role as scheming fashion editor and businesswoman Maggie Cameron an original character in television soap opera Number 96. The series creator and writer David Sale, stated she was the first major bitch on television, long before Alexis Carrington (Joan Collins)Giles, Nigel \\"NUMBER 96: Australia's Most Notorious Address\\" published by Melbourne Books 2007 Early life and training Welch was born Auckland, New Zealand. Welch started her acting career aged 18 in 1940 when she arrived in Sydney from New Zealand with her parents on holiday. In Sydney she won a competition that led to her being trained by J. C. Williamson's theatre company, and she also began acting on Australian radio. Her training with J. C. Williamson led to a succession of theatre roles with the company.Atterton, Margot. (Ed.) The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Australian Showbiz, Sunshine Books, 1984. p 230 Theatre career During Robert Morley's Australian theatre tour in 1949 she played his young mistress in his co-scripted play Edward, My Son. Her other stage roles include Australian productions of Harvey with Joe E. Brown, Simon and Laura and The Deep Blue Sea with Googie Withers and John McCallum, the lead role opposite Emrys Jones in Double Image, and a featured role with Sir Robert Helpmann in Nude with Violin by No√´l Coward. Welch appeared as the enchantress Morgan le Fey in J. C. Williamson's production of Camelot in the early 1960s, a role she played for two and a half years. She subsequently took one of the lead roles in four-handed comedy Any Wednesday, appeared in productions of There's A Girl In My Soup, and The Band Wagon. The nurse in Loot, by Joe Orton featured in A Delicate Balance, playing Julia by Edward Albee and took the lead role in a production of Frederick Knott's Wait Until Dark, a role for which she was critically acclaimed. Welch played in Melbourne and Sydney in Hal Porter's Australian play Eden House. She had a major role in the Sydney Theatre Company's season of the Stephen Sondheim musical, A Little Night Music\\" at the Sydney Opera House in 1990. Television roles Through the 1960s she also had guest roles in Australian television drama series. In the late 1960s she appeared in the Crawford Productions adventure series Hunter (1967), and played various guest roles in the top-rated Crawford Productions police dramas Homicide and Division 4. In 1971 Welch appeared in an episode of popular situation comedy series The Group. After that show's writer David Sale, who had earlier been impressed by the performance she gave in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation-Artransa Films science fiction children's series Phoenix 5 (1970), saw her in the relatively minor role in The Group, he promised to write something especially for her next time. When he created Number 96 he kept his word, creating the role of corrupt businesswoman and fashion editor Maggie Cameron for her. Number 96 Appearing in Number 96 from its inception in March 1972, Welch's character Maggie emerged as a popular bitch-figure in the top-rated serial. Welch says she partly based her characterisation of Maggie on the Mrs Robinson character played by Anne Bancroft in feature film The Graduate.Maggie - The Tough Girl with a Soft Centre, TV Week, 19 October 1974, p 25 In 1973 Welch left Number 96 temporarily to again act on stage opposite Robert Morley, this time in How the Other Half Loves. She returned to the series after that, and also reprised the role in the feature film version of Number 96 released in 1974. In 1975 Number 96 suffered a drop in ratings so a bomb storyline was developed as a dramatic way to write out several characters. The story went to air in September, and Maggie was revealed to have been the person who planted the bomb and her character written out the series by being sent to prison. Welch returned for a guest appearance in 1976 when Maggie's trial was shown, and she appeared in the show's final episode in 1977 where it was explained that Maggie had been released from prison. Other television roles After Number 96 Welch continued to make guest appearances in Australian television series, including roles in Glenview High (1977), The Outsiders (1977), Young Ramsay (1978), and in legal drama Case for the Defence (1978). Through the 1980s Welch played small featured roles in several Australian television movies and feature films, including Undercover (1983), and guest starred in two episodes of A Country Practice. She died in 1993 in Australia, aged 71.

He took the name Homeromastix (·ΩâŒºŒ∑œÅŒøŒºŒ¨œÉœÑŒπŒæ \\"Homer whipper\\"; gen.: ·ΩâŒºŒ∑œÅŒøŒºŒ¨œÉœÑŒπŒ≥ŒøœÇ) later in life. Biography According to Vitruvius (vii., preface), Zoilus lived during the age of Ptolemy Philadelphus, by whom he was crucified as the punishment of his criticisms on the king; but this account should probably be rejected as a fiction based on Zoilus' reputation. Vitruvius goes on to state that Zoilus also may have been stoned at Chios or thrown alive upon a funeral pyre at Smyrna. Either way Vitruvius felt it was just as well since he deserved to be dead for slandering an author who could not defend himself. Zoilus appears to have been at one time a follower of Isocrates, but subsequently a pupil of Polycrates, whom he heard at Athens, where he was a teacher of rhetoric. Zoilus was chiefly known for the acerbity of his attacks on Homer, chiefly directed against the fabulous element in the Homeric poems. Zoilus also wrote responses to works by Isocrates and Plato, who had attacked the style of Lysias of which he approved. However, the Homeric Question led to his name becoming a byword for harsh and malignant criticism: in antiquity he gained the name \\"Homeromastix,\\" \\"scourge of Homer\\"; in the modern period, Cervantes calls Zoilus a \\"slanderer\\" in the preface to Don Quixote and there is also a (now disused) proverb, \\"Every poet has his Zoilus.\\" Since his writings do not survive, it is impossible to know whether this caricature is justified.
