The test was developed by Halbert White, who observed that in a correctly specified model and under standard regularity assumptions, the Fisher information matrix can be expressed in either of two ways: as the outer product of the gradient, or as a function of the Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood function. Consider a linear model \\\\mathbf{y} = \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta} + \\\\mathbf{u}, where the errors \\\\mathbf{u} are assumed to be distributed \\\\mathrm{N}(0, \\\\sigma^2 \\\\mathbf{I}). If the parameters \\\\beta and \\\\sigma^2 are stacked in the vector \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} \\\\beta & \\\\sigma^2 \\\\end{bmatrix}, the resulting log-likelihood function is :\\\\ell (\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}) = - \\\\frac{n}{2} \\\\log \\\\sigma^2 - \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\sigma^2} \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{y} - \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta} \\\\right)^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\left( \\\\mathbf{y} - \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\mathbf{\\\\beta} \\\\right) The information matrix can then be expressed as : \\\\mathbf{I} (\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}) = \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\ell (\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}) }{ \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta} } \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\ell (\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}) }{ \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta} } \\\\right)^{\\\\mathsf{T}} \\\\right] that is the expected value of the outer product of the gradient or score. Second, it can be written as the negative of the Hessian matrix of the log-likelihood function : \\\\mathbf{I} (\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}) = - \\\\operatorname{E} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\ell (\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}) }{ \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta} \\\\, \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}^{\\\\mathsf{T}}} \\\\right] If the model is correctly specified, both expressions should be equal. Combining the equivalent forms yields : \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta}(\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 \\\\ell(\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}) }{ \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta} \\\\, \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}^{\\\\mathsf{T}} } + \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\ell(\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}) }{ \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta} } \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\ell (\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}) }{ \\\\partial \\\\mathbf{\\\\theta} } \\\\right] where \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta} (\\\\mathbf{\\\\theta}) is an (r \\\\times r) random matrix, where r is the number of parameters. White showed that the elements of n^{-1/2} \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta} ( \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} ), where \\\\mathbf{\\\\hat{\\\\theta}} is the MLE, are asymptotically normally distributed with zero means when the model is correctly specified.

It is one of two genera in the family Dipteridaceae. Description Species of Dipteris grow from creeping rhizomes,F. O. Bower and have large stalks to the sporangium and annulus. The rhizomes have bristles (or hairs) and the fronds have uniseriate hairs (having one line or series). All species of Dipteris have spore-capsules that are carried on the lower surface of the broad lobed frond.A. C. Seward The fronds can reach up to 50 cm long. Taxonomy Caspar Georg Carl Reinwardt first published the genus in 1825, by describing Dipteris conjugata Reinw. which is the best known species. In 1839, R. Brown reduced the genus to a subgenus of Polypodium. In 1901, Konrad Christ published Die Farnkrauter der Erde't, within which he included the genus Dipteris in the family Polypodiaceae, (a subdivision of the Polypodiacea). It was then later placed into a separate genus,A. C. Seward Bower (1928), Ching (1940) and Pichi-Sermolli (1958) all having recreated the family Dipteridaceae, then comprising only one genus, Dipteris,Indian Botanical Society, Memoirs, Issue 4, page 9, 1963 due to the differences in sporangium, stomata and gametophte.Peter H.

It contains 16 mounds. Abalos Colles is one of the named features in the vicinity of Planum Boreum, the Martian North pole. It is named after one of the classical albedo features on Mars located at latitude 72¬∞N, longitude 70¬∞W. Its name was officially approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2003. It extends from latitude 74.81¬∞N to 78.78¬∞N and from longitude 284.54¬∞E to 293.39¬∞E (66.61¬∞W ‚Äì 75.46¬∞W). Its centre is located at latitude 71.65¬∞N, longitude 76.83¬∞W, and has a diameter of 235.83 km. The Abalos Colles mounds are of irregular, angular, or conical form. The tops of the conical forms can feature craters, and can also be flat. Their height varies between less than a hundred to less than 700 metres, with top diameters in the range of 20 km. The northernmost boundary of the dune field of Abalos Undae is located in the southwest channel that separates Abalos Colles from the main ice cap, and from there the dune field extends southwest all the way to the lowlands of Vastitas Borealis. Formation Close-up of an Abalos Colles mound The Abalos Colles stratigraphy shows similar characteristics with the Rupes Tenuis basal unit, and it is considered a remnant of a larger, contiguous ancient north polar basal unit. The Abalos Colles formation is considered to be the result of large-scale erosion episodes of the Rupes Tenuis basal unit. Probable erosion mechanisms include crater impact which formed ejecta that subsequently covered and protected the ancient basal unit. Conical mounds with flat or cratered tops could have been formed by layer accumulations on top of impact craters which then eroded to varying degrees, depending on the size of the original crater. At the southern boundary of Chasma Boreale, a sequence of mounds of Abalos Coles with flat, pitted or cratered tops, show similar morphological characteristics to small Icelandic shield volcanoes of basaltic origin. Adjusted to account for the difference in topology between the two planets, both the terrestrial and Martian volcanoes share similar side slopes and volume to diameter ratios, the latter being defined as the volcanic productivity index.

Her fame peaked in the 1950s, in what is known as Sri Lanka's 'gramophone era'. Early life De Silva was born in 1930 to G.F. de Silva (owner/managing director of Safety Tours; a former manager at the De Zoysa Company and surveyor at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce) and D.L. Sahabandu, in British Ceylon. An only child, Boralessa grew up in a family with close ties to the Ceylonese arts industry, primarily due to her father G.F. de Silva's work as a playwright and producer, and his patronage of the arts in general. Her first public performance took place in 1938, when she sang welcome songs for performances of two of her father's plays: The Sad State of Lanka and Election Echo, gaining the attention of her uncle, G.R. Edward, in the audience. Edward then convinced Boralessa's parents to allow him to perform a duet with her on Radio Ceylon later that year; she successfully auditioned for Radio Ceylon in 1940, before a panel consisting of Gunapala Malalasekera, S.L.B. Kapukotuwa, and B.S. Wijeyratne, becoming part of their in-house roster of live singers. As a child singer at Radio Ceylon, Boralessa would initially sing simpler songs, performing live with radio orchestras sourced by her father, quickly being promoted to an A-grade artist in late 1940. Her first solo song was Chandra de piya. By the mid-1940s, Boralessa was a fairly well-known artist, and had caught the attention of a number of more senior members of the local music industry - one of whom was Sunil Shantha, who visited Boralessa's home in 1946 to invite her to perform with him. Boralessa and her family accepted the offer, leading to the release of Ralle Nagenne that same year. Career The release of Ralle Nagenne is regarded to have been the turning point in Boralessa's career, the association with an artist like Shantha contributing considerably. Inspired by artists such as Wasantha Senanayake, Vincent de Paul Peiris, Susil Premarathna, Grace Sahabandu, Priscilla Opatha, C.T. Fernando, Kanthi Wakwella and Mohideen Baig, she would go on to perform both solo songs (mostly devotional - and patriotic music) and duets with notable artists such as H.R. Jothipala, Haroon Lanthra, Dharmadasa Walpola and Sisira Senarathne, and eventually with her idol C.T. Boralessa expressed a desire to enter the playback music industry, but could not visit India for recording due to objections by her parents. Nevertheless, the early 1950s saw Vivienne enter the peak of her popularity, under the guidance and training of musicologists and composers such as H.W. Rupasinghe (\\"Rupasinghe master\\"), Lionel Edirisinghe and Eddie master. Notable songwriters that contributed to her career during this (and later) periods include: *Sarath Wimalaweera *Karunaratne Abeysekera *Dharmadasa Dias *Premakeerthi de Alwis *C. Weerasekara *Dayananda Kumarasiri *Wasanthasiri Kusumpola *Rangajeewa Salgado Boralessa's work was scored by some of Sri Lanka's most well-known composers, with B.S. Perera, Victor Perera, Premasiri Khemadasa, Sanath Nandasiri and Clarence Wijewardena among them. Boralessa was also signed on to the HMV label (then under the local oversight of Cargills (Ceylon)) by Gabrielle Gunaratne in 1950. Some of Vivienne's more well-known songs include: *Dura pena thanithala (Far-seen plains) *Nangi nangi Rupika (Sister Rupika) *Nawathinna Tissa (Tissa, desist) *Sambudu mangalle (Blessed (Buddhist) festival) *Budu magula langama ewi (The Buddhist festival draws near) *Ma Sanghabodhi swamine (My Lord Sanghabodhi) While most of Boralessa's work was recorded on gramophone, she released a CD-based album containing her most popular tracks, entitled Sambudu Mangalle, in 2009. De Silva-Boralessa was the only artist to perform at the 2500th- (1955) and 2550th (2006) Buddha Jayanti as well as the 2600th (2011) Sambuddhatva Jayanthi celebrations held in Sri Lanka; she performed \\"Me pin bime\\" (\\"On this hallowed ground\\"), a song written for the occasion, in a duet alongside her son, Kapila at the latter occasion. She was also awarded the Kalabooshana award by the Sri Lankan Government for her services to the country's music industry. Personal life Vivienne de Silva- Boralessa married C.D.S. Boralessa (d. 11 March 2013) in 1953 at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo. The two met at the wedding of Vivienne Boralessa's uncle G.R. Edward, where Boralessa had approached her as a fan of her work. They had six children- Udaya, Ajith, Indrani, Devapriya, Kapila and Madhavi. Kapila Boralessa is himself a member of the Sri Lankan music scene and, along with his sister Indrani, holds the rights to their mother's estate. Vivienne de Silva-Boralessa died on 2 April 2017 at the Sri Jayawardenepura General Hospital after a brief period of illness.

Tokyo: Nichigai Associates, p. 625. The follower who administers the Sazuke to the suffering person acts as a mediator through which Tenri-O-no-Mikoto grants the blessing of a cure.„Äå„Åï„Åö„Åë„Äç \\"Sazuke,\\" „ÄéÊîπË®ÇÂ§©ÁêÜÊïôËæûÂÖ∏„Äè Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten, p. 369. English equivalent: A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, pp. 362‚Äì365.  Bestowal  In her lifetime, Nakayama Miki bestowed the Sazuke to her most devout followers. After she passed in 1887, Izo Iburi bestowed the Sazuke in her place. Initially, followers who distinguished themselves during Nakayama's physical lifetime would receive the Sazuke spontaneously as a divine direction. Increased demand for the Sazuke led to the creation of a standard lecture system known as the Besseki in 1889 or 1890. This system continues to this day. Nowadays, members who wish to receive the Sazuke are asked to attend nine lectures that cover Nakayama's life and teachings. Sazuke of Hand Dance Nakayama and Iburi bestowed several forms of the Sazuke during their lifetimes, but today only one form is practiced ‚Äì the \\"Sazuke of Hand Dance,\\" or the \\"Sazuke of Ashiki Harai.\\" The person administering this grant chants \\"Ashiki harai tasuke tamae, Tenri-≈å-no- Mikoto\\" three times with accompanying hand movements and then chants \\"Namu tasuke tamae Tenri-≈å-no-Mikoto\\" three times while stroking the afflicted area. This process is repeated two more times. Besseki  Outdated forms   Earliest forms  During Nakayama Miki's lifetime, the Sazuke was a generic term that referred to any grant that she bestowed on her followers. The first set of these grants included the Sazuke of the Fan, the Sazuke of the Gohei, and the Sazuke of Fertilizer, bestowed from 1864 to 1867. = Sazuke of the Fan = Nakayama began to bestow the Sazuke of the Fan in the spring of 1864, to about 50 to 60 people.The Life of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo ‚Äî Manuscript Edition (third edition), p. 38. With this Sazuke, followers had the ability to inquire the divine will and receive a response by reading the movements of a fan received from Nakayama.„ÄåÊâá„ÅÆ„Åï„Åö„Åë„Äç \\"≈çgi no Sazuke,\\" „ÄéÊîπË®ÇÂ§©ÁêÜÊïôËæûÂÖ∏„Äè Kaitei Tenriky≈ç jiten, p. 103. English equivalent: A Glossary of Tenrikyo Terms, pp. 361‚Äì362. The follower would place the fan on his lap, ponder over the illness of a person, and then interpret whether or not there whether or not the person would recover based on which direction the fan moved. Nakayama banned the Sazuke of the Fan around 1868, and one conjecture for the reason this Sazuke was banned was that \\"God's will was not conveyed as it should have been; some egotistic, personal interpretations were mixed\\" in inquiries.Nakayama, Shozen. \\"The Theory of Doctrine and the Practice of Faith.\\" In The Theological Perspectives of Tenrikyo: In Commemoration of the Centennial Anniversary of Oyasama / edited by Oyasato Research Institute, Tenri University, p. 20. A passage from the Osashizu, dated 1890 June 21, calls Sazuke of the Fan as an \\"old path.\\" The Sazuke of the Fan is mentioned in Song Six and Song Twelve of the Mikagura-uta. = Sazuke of the Gohei = The Sazuke of the Gohei is similar to the Sazuke of the Fan, except that a gohei was used in place of a fan. = Sazuke of Fertilizer = The recipient of this Sazuke would make an offering of three g≈ç Âêà (about a third of a pint) each of rice-bran, ashes, and soil. When this mixture was placed in a field, Nakayama said that the mixture would be just as effective as one da ÈßÑ (about 300 pounds) of night soil.„Äé„Åä„Åµ„Åß„Åï„ÅçÊ≥®Èáà„Äè Ofudesaki chushaku, p. 60; Fukaya, Tadamasa. Commentary on the Mikagura-uta, The Songs for the Tsutome, p. 43. The Sazuke of Fertilizer is mentioned in the Ofudesaki, Song One of the Mikagura-uta, as well as Anecdotes of Oyasama (story #12).  For the healing of illness  In December 1874, Nakayama Miki began to bestow grants that allowed followers to petition the divine to heal physical ailments.Áü¢ÊåÅËæ∞‰∏â Yamochi Tatsuzo. „ÄéÁ®øÊú¨Â§©ÁêÜÊïôÊïôÁ•ñ‰ºùÂÖ•ÈñÄÂçÅË¨õ„Äè Kohon Tenrikyo Oyasama-den nyumon jikko, p. 128. According to Nakayama's hagiography, she bestowed different forms of the Sazuke to followers on December 26: > \\"First, I bestow the Grant of Breath to Nakata. Second, the Grant of Boiled > Rice to Matsuo. Third, the Grant of Hand Dance to Tsuji, which is to be > performed with an innocent heart like that of a three-year-old child. > Fourth, the Grant of the Kanrodai-Teodori to Masui, which is to be performed > in one accord, all firmly united.\\"The Life of Oyasama, pp. 93‚Äì94. = Sazuke of Breath = The person administering this grant would breathe on the afflicted area of an ill person.„Äå„Åï„Åö„Åë„Äç \\"Sazuke,\\" „ÄéÊîπË®ÇÂ§©ÁêÜÊïôËæûÂÖ∏„Äè Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten, p. 370. or breathe on sheets of rice paper called o-iki no kami (literally, \\"paper of the sacred breath\\"). This grant is mentioned in the Ofudesaki, usually with the Sazuke of Hand Dance.The Sazuke of Breath is mentioned with the Sazuke of Hand Dance in Ofudesaki VI:106 and Ofudesaki XII:50. It is mentioned on its own in Ofudesaki VI:108. = Sazuke of Boiled Rice = The person administering this grant would place three g≈ç of clean rice in a bag, immerse it three times in boiling water, and have the afflicted person eat three grains from it. = Sazuke for the Family = Another name for this grant was the Sazuke of Stroking Hands. = Sazuke of the Kanrodai- Teodori = This grant was similar to the Sazuke of the Hand Dance, except that sections two and three of the Mikagura-uta were performed instead of section one. Out of all the grants by Nakayama Miki and Izo Iburi, this one was the least commonly bestowed. = Sazuke of Water = The person administering this grant would sip water three times from a cup and then have its recipient drink the rest. = Sazuke of Sacred Water with the Food of Heaven = This grant was similar to the Sazuke of Water except white sugar was added to the water.

An inscription on the upper back part of the fountain reads: \\"PRESENTED TO THE CITY OF SALEM OREGON / BY / BREYMAN BROTHERS / 1904\\". The fountain originally served as a watering trough for horses and, according to the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department, remains Willson Park's only historic structure from the era of the second capitol building. History The fountain was donated to the city of Salem by the family of businessman Werner Breyman in 1904, and installed near Cottage Street as a memorial to pioneers. It was visible from the homes of both Breyman brothers. In the late 1930s, a statue installed atop the fountain was put into storage and went missing. In the 1950s, a sculpture of an eagle replaced the doughboy statue, and flowers grew where horses once drank. According to family members, the sculptures adorning the fountain were melted and used as scrap metal during World War II. The fountain's condition was undetermined by the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\\" program in August 1993.

Education  After earning her Doctorate in Astronomy from Case Western Reserve University in 1967, Nancy Houk was a postdoctoral student at Case Western and the Kapteyn Laboratory in the Netherlands. During her undergraduate years at the University of Michigan, Houk researched at the Maria Mitchell Observatory, a memorial to Maria Mitchell, America's first woman professional astronomer.  Career  Houk joined the Astronomy Department at the University of Michigan in 1970 as a Research Associate, followed by promotions to Research Associate in 1973, the Associate Research Scientist in 1977, then Research Scientist in 1985.  Research  Houk led the effort to establish a comprehensive database of stellar temperatures and luminosities. Houk's photographic observations of stars were made using the University of Michigan 0.61-m Curtis Schmidt telescope located at Cerro Tololo Interamerican Observatory (CTIO). CTIO, established in 1960, is a campus of astronomical telescopes located east of La Serena, Chile at an altitude of 2200 meters. CTIO is part of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory (NOAO). The telescope that Houk used was moved from Portage Lake Observatory in Michigan to CTIO in 1966. Houk began her observations in 1971. By 2014, the project had assembled five volumes covering the sky from the south celestial pole to +5¬∞ declination, consisting of 162,900 stars in total. The plates images are spectral images, taken with an objective prism at the front of the telescope. The images provide information about the physical properties of stars such as their composition of atomic elements and molecules, mass, temperature, rotational properties, age, distance, spectra classification and more. Houk used this data to construct the fundamental diagram used in astrophysics called the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram that forms the basis of modern astrophysics.  Astronomical Photographic Data Archive  Houk retired in 2001 and donated half her plate collection which surveyed the entire southern hemisphere night sky to the Astronomical Photographic Data Archive (APDA) in 2004. The other half of her collection resides in Japan. APDA, located at the Pisgah Astronomical Research Institute, plans to digitize her photographic plates. Nancy Houk transferring her collection to APDA. Standing next to her is Michael Castelaz, PARI Research Director in 2004 who accepted Nancy Houk's collection on behalf of APDA.

History The slave ship Beckford Galley (sometimes Bedford Galley) left England in June 1698 for west Africa and Madagascar under Captain John Harris, who was notoriously cruel to his crew. When they put in at Tulear on Madagascar in late 1698 or early 1699, the crew conspired with a number of pirates from ashore, led by John Ryder. He had been a gunner on one of Emperor Aurangzeb's ships and had been aboard the frigate Mocha when Robert Culliford mutinied and seized it. Culliford accepted a general pardon for pirates offered at √éle Sainte-Marie but Ryder and several others remained behind where they‚Äôd made their way to Tulear. Ryder's group and Beckford Galleys crew murdered Harris, stole the ship, and put ashore anyone unwilling to turn to piracy. The unwilling crew reported Ryder's attack, resulting in the Council of Trade and Plantations issuing warnings about Ryder to governors of the American colonies in case they headed back across the Atlantic. The pirates elected Evan Jones as their new captain, with Ryder as his quartermaster. Sailing back up the coast of western Africa, they had little success. At Abraham Samuel‚Äôs pirate trading port in St. Augustine, they encountered the slave ship Prophet Daniel under Captain Appel; his cargo master was John Cruger, who was later an alderman in New York, and eventually mayor. Jones pulled alongside Prophet Daniel, hailed them, and invited them to drink ashore. Cruger and some of his crew recognized Jones and a few of his sailors as fellow denizens of Westchester, New York, and never suspected treachery. At a signal that night, Jones' men boarded Prophet Daniel and seized it. Cruger hired some of Samuel's warriors to attack the two ships with musket fire from shore, but they had little effect. When Cruger tried to have Samuel's men cut the ships‚Äô anchor cables, Samuel revealed that Jones had paid him off, promising him slaves and the Prophet Daniel. Jones and Beckford Galley sailed away, with some of Prophet Daniels crew (and possibly Appel as well) aboard. Samuel confiscated all of Cruger's guns and supplies and sold Prophet Daniel to Edward Woodman and three other pirates, while Cruger was forced to buy passage back to New York aboard a merchantman. There is some evidence that New York merchant Frederick Philipse may have been involved in Prophet Daniels capture; Philipse had long been involved in trading goods to pirates in exchange for slaves, and had a rival slave-ship in the area at the time. Jones tried to recruit other Madagascar pirates to Beckford Galley, some of whom refused (a few who hadd sailed with Robert Colley and Joseph Wheeler), preferring like Culliford to accept a pardon and wait for a passing merchant to return them to America. By September 1699 the ship (possibly renamed Tulear Galley or \\"Tolier Galley\\") needed repairs. Returning to Tulear, they captured a brigantine which they sank after looting it for supplies and slaves, again putting ashore anyone who refused to join them. They then cruised up the eastern coast of Africa taking several small ships. Returning to St. Augustine to careen, they beached the ship carelessly and broke its keel. Jones and Ryder‚Äôs further activities are not known; one source said they later joined Culliford‚Äôs crew. Among Jones' crew was future pirate Captain David Williams, who would also go on to sail with Culliford as well as under a number of other Madagascar-based pirate captains. As a New York alderman years later, Cruger remembered his ordeal with Jones' pirates. Captain Peter Solgard of HMS Greyhound engaged pirates Edward Low and Charles Harris off Delaware Bay in 1723, mauling Low's ship and driving him off while capturing Harris after a lengthy battle. Cruger was among the aldermen who rewarded Solgard for his bravery. See also * Capture of the schooner Fancy ‚Äì a description of Solgard's battle against Harris and Low.

Life Sz√©cs√©nyi came from the powerful and prestigious Sz√©cs√©nyi noble family. He was born in 1317, as the second son of Thomas Sz√©cs√©nyi, Voivode of Transylvania and his first wife, an unidentified daughter of landowner Paul Visontai. One of his brothers was K√≥nya Sz√©cs√©nyi, Ban of Croatia.Engel: Geneal√≥gia (Genus Kacsics, 4. Sz√©cs√©nyi branch) Michael was blind in his left eye due to a childhood-related cataract throughout his life, according to a contemporary document. As a younger son of his family, Sz√©cs√©nyi entered ecclesiastical career, which rapidly progressed due to his father's influence, who also became a relative to the Angevin dynasty after his second marriage to Anne, Duchess of Auschwitz. At the age of 15, Michael was made Canon of Esztergom by Pope John XXII in 1332. In the following year, he was elected Provost of Pressburg (today Bratislava, Slovakia), when he still was in \\"puberty age\\", as a document recorded. Consequently, a certain Thomas the Red served as \\"administrator\\" of the provostry beside him. Sz√©cs√©nyi remained in his position until 1342. He frequently resided in his manor at Visegr√°d, near the royal court. Subsequently, he was also elected a member of the collegiate chapter of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. During his minority, Sz√©cs√©nyi's two tutors were John, a canon of Pressburg and Nicholas Zalai, a canon of Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r. Sz√©cs√©nyi was elected Bishop of V√°c on 11 October 1341, replacing Dominican friar Rudolph, who died in office. His election was confirmed by the newly elected Pope Clement VI on 8 July 1342. The pope permitted his consecration by every bishop in his papal breve on 15 November 1343. Sz√©cs√©nyi held the bishopric for more than twenty years. At the end of 1362 or early 1363, he was transferred to the Diocese of Eger. He first appeared as Bishop of Eger on 19 February 1363. His election was confirmed by Pope Urban V on 28 November 1363. In April 1363, Sz√©cs√©nyi acquired the village of Demj√©n and its mill from the Eger Chapter, in exchange for the tithe of G√∂ncruszka. In the following years, he had several conflicts with the chapter. For instance, he unlawfully occupied the half of ecclesiastical estates in the eastern side of the Eger valley, for which the chapter protested against him on 3 March 1365. In the next year, King Louis I made it possible for the realm's nobles to designate the Diocese of Eger as heirs in their last wills. In 1367, Sz√©cs√©nyi handed over the Makovica Castle (today Zborov in Slovakia) to baron Peter Cudar for 200 gold ducats per year. In December 1371, Sz√©cs√©nyi held a three-day synod in his diocese, dedicated to its patron saint John the Apostle. Under his bishopric, the construction of the cathedral continued, as a letter from Pope Gregory XI proved it in 1372. In the same year, he acquired the village of B√°tor, Heves County from the B√°thory family on the occasion of a lawsuit. In 1375, Nicholas, Bishop of Milkovia styled himself as a subordinate to the Diocese of Eger. Sz√©cs√©nyi was last mentioned as a living person on 13 March 1377. He died before 2 October 1377.

Licensed to serve Providence, Rhode Island, United States, it serves the Providence metropolitan area. It first began broadcasting in 1955 under the call sign WPFM, and from 1966 until 2017 operated under the ownership of Brown Broadcasting Service (a non-profit organization run by Brown University students but independent of the university) as alternative rock radio station WBRU (now an Internet radio station). The station is currently owned by the Educational Media Foundation. History WJAR-FM (1948‚Äì1953) The first occupant of 95.5 FM in Providence was WJAR-FM, owned by The Outlet Company along with WJAR (920 AM, now WHJJ) and WJAR-TV (then on channel 11, now on channel 10). WJAR-FM signed on in May 1948 as a full-time simulcast of the AM station; its transmitter location in Rehoboth, Massachusetts was shared with WJAR-TV, which went on the air the following year. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) cancelled the WJAR-FM license at Outlet's request on January 19, 1953. WPFM (1955‚Äì1965) A construction permit for a new station on 95.5 FM was issued to Plantations Broadcasting Corp. on May 25, 1955; it went on the air June 5, 1955 as WPFM. In 1958, the station was acquired by Golden Gate Corp. for $10,000; at the time, Golden Gate's president, Harold C. Arcato, also had interests in WRIB (1220 AM, now WSTL) and WNET (channel 16, now WNAC-TV channel 64). WPFM began broadcasting 24 hours a day on September 1, 1958; Arcato stated that it was the first FM radio station in New England to operate full-time. During the 1960s, the station had affiliations with the QXR Network and the CRB Network. WBRU (1966‚Äì2017) Golden Gate Corp. purchased WHIM (1110 AM, now WPMZ) and WHIM-FM (94.1 FM, now WHJY) in 1964, under the condition that it sell WPFM and its one-third stake in WLKW (990 AM, later known as WALE). In 1965, WPFM was sold to Brown Broadcasting Service for $30,000; the new owners changed the call letters to WBRU. The station, which had been off the air, resumed broadcasting February 21, 1966; the first program to be transmitted from the new station was a panel show which discussed the Peace Corps. In 1969, WBRU adopted a progressive rock format; in 1988, it shifted from album-oriented rock to alternative rock. Sale to Educational Media Foundation; switch to K-Love In March 2017, the station's board of directors passed a resolution to begin seeking a buyer for the station, after 60 years of being owned and operated by the independent non- profit Brown Broadcasting Services organization. Several alumni of the station opposed the resolution. On August 25, 2017, it was announced that Brown Broadcasting Service had sold the 95.5 FM license to Educational Media Foundation, a Christian music broadcaster, which plans to take over the frequency on September 1.

Norman to divide Hadrosauroidea into the basal taxa with compressed manual bones and a pollex, and the derived taxa that lack them. The clade is defined as all the taxa closer to Edmontosaurus regalis than Probactrosaurus gobiensis. This results in different taxon inclusion depending on the analysis. Classification Hadrosauromorpha was first used in literature by David B. Norman in 2014 in a discussion of phylogenetics of Hypselospinus. In his 2014 paper Norman references another of his publications as the authority for Hadrosauromorpha, a chapter in the book Hadrosaurs. However, the book was in fact published later, in 2015. Following Article 19.4 of the PhyloCode, the authorship of the clade is thus Norman (2015), while the authorship of the definition is Norman (2014). Definition Hadrosauromorpha was defined by Norman (2014 and 2015) as hadrosauroid taxa closer to Edmontosaurus regalis than Probactrosaurus gobiensis. This definition was contested by Mickey Mortimer, who stated that to follow the PhyloCode the taxon Hadrosaurus must be included in the definition, as it is the type genus of Hadrosauromorpha. By this definition, Norman (2015) considered Hadrosauromorpha to include Hadrosauridae, as well as the taxa Tethyshadros and Bactrosaurus. Norman in 2014 had included more taxa in Hadrosauromorpha, those of Norman (2015) as well as Levnesovia, Gilmoreosaurus and Telmatosaurus, the last of which was considered inside Hadrosauridae by Norman in 2015. Another phylogenetic analysis by Xing et al. in 2014 also found that Eolambia and Protohadros, both found outside Hadrosauromorpha by Norman, fell within his definition, as well as a large number of other taxa. Phylogeny Many different versions of phylogenies have been conducted on the group of hadrosauromorphs. Norman (2014) created his own analysis, which includes 105 different morphological characters and 27 select ornithopod taxa. His phylogeny is shown below, using his specific clade definitions: Norman's definitions have been heavily criticized by Mickey Mortimer as being unnecessary changes which cause more confusion to classification. Other phylogenetic analyses, like that of Xing et al. shown below, use traditional clade definitions (Hadrosauromorpha has been added as defined) and have recovered different results. Huehuecanauhtlus has also been found as one of the most derived hadrosauromorphans, between Gilmoreosaurus and Hadrosauridae. Skull and restoration of Eolambia, possibly one of the most basal hadrosauromorphans Description Skeleton of Probactrosaurus, the taxon just outside Hadrosauromorpha Probactrosaurus was selected as the outgroup to Hadrosauromorpha because of numerous differences that Norman (2014) thought to be significant. The tooth crowns in the dentary are asymmetrical and have multiple vertical ridges; there is a foramen in the surangular; and the quadrate bone has a more prominent depression for the articulation of the jugal. None of these features are found in the skulls of the more derived hadrosauromorphans. The premaxilla contacts the prefrontal, and the jugal contact with the ectopterygoid bone of the palate is reduced. In the appendicular regions, hadrosauromorphans the scapulae are not J shaped, instead having an overhanging projection. The lower forelimb bones are more slender in both hadrosauromorphans and Probactosaurus, unlike their more robust ancestors. Probactosaurus, however, possesses the basal condition of having a small, conical pollex, like in earlier ornithopods such as Iguanodon or Hypselospinus. This absence of a pollex is also linked to a reduction of the carpal bones, and a less mobile manus. The ilium bones of Probactrosaurus are more angular than in hadrosauromorphs, which lack a brevis shelf. It was also identified that the femoral shaft is straight in hadrosauromorphans and the pedal bones are truncated References Iguanodonts Cretaceous dinosaurs ","title":"Hadrosauromorpha"},{"id":"55116196","text":"Sadie Marie Hainline Callan (April 14, 1886 - January 26, 1970) was an Advertising Agency owner and a publicity and campaign manager.

Early life Mills was born in Bigga, New South Wales and after attending the local primary school went to high school in Goulburn before attending college in Sydney where he trained as a teacher. His rugby league career began with local teams in Bigga and Goulburn. After completing his college course Mills took a teaching post in Grenfell, New South Wales where he played for the local rugby team. Professional rugby career At various times during the early decades of the 20th century there was a ban on British rugby league teams signing players from outside the United Kingdom. The most recent ban dated from 1923 and existed because of fears from the Australian league authorities that the best players would be attracted to play in Britain rather than stay at home and develop the game at home. By 1927 the British clubs wanted the ban lifting and in June 1927 the ban was lifted. The Grenfell team were at this time coached by Huddersfield player, Ben Gronow. Gronow recommended Mills to Huddersfield and with days of the transfer ban being lifted Mills had signed a contract with Huddersfield and arrived in England in time for the start of the 1927‚Äì28 season. Mills scored his first try for Huddersfield on his debut, scoring the only points of the game, a 3‚Äì0 victory over Castleford on 27 August 1927. For the 1927‚Äì28 season and the following five seasons Mills was to be Huddersfield's top try scorer and for two seasons, 1928‚Äì29 and 1931‚Äì32 he was the league's top try scorer. Mills played and won in two Championship finals, 1928‚Äì29 (2‚Äì0 vs Leeds), and 1929‚Äì30 (10‚Äì0 in a replay against Leeds after a 2‚Äì2 draw). Huddersfield won the Yorkshire League in the same two seasons. In 1931 Mills won a Yorkshire Cup winners medal as Huddersfield beat Hunslet 4‚Äì2 in the 1931‚Äì32 Yorkshire Cup final at Headingley. The quartet of winning all four different cups was completed in 1933 as Mills was a member of the team that triumphed in the 1932‚Äì33 Challenge Cup final and he scored a try as Huddersfield beat Warrington 21‚Äì17 at Wembley on 6 May 1933. During the 1934‚Äì35 season Mills requested a transfer from Huddersfield and was placed on the transfer list with a fee of ¬£600, but before any transfer was agreed Mills was injured playing against Bradford Northern in April 1935. Mills did not play for the rest of the season and despite surgery, the injury was so severe that Mills was advised to retire from playing at the end of 1935. In total Mills made 386 appearances for Huddersfield, scoring 288 tries, and in a sport where injuries were common played 123 consecutive games between 28 December 1929 and 5 September 1932. Mills was never considered for selection for the Australian national team and the only representative honours he achieved were to play twice for the Other Nationalities against England in 1929 and 1930, his only international try being scored in the 1930 game. Teaching career Mills held several teaching posts in England both while playing rugby and after his retirement from the game. During the Great Depression of the early 1930s he was in charge of the youth section of a training centre for unemployed young people in Huddersfield. Personal life Mills was married three times. The first marriage was to Edna Naylor in July 1926 in Sydney. In 1931 she petitioned for divorce on the basis of Mills's desertion of her by his move to England to play rugby. They had one child. In August 1932 Mills married Marie Johnson in England. By 1951 Mills and Johnson has divorced and Mills married for a third time to Vera Shaw in Lancaster, Lancashire, England.

The roadway functions at the western portion of Ring Road; however, unlike Ring Road, it is an arterial road with no interchanges.  Route description   Pasqua Street  Pasqua Street is divided into two sections. The northern section is a four lane arterial road that runs north from Sherwood Drive, past Ring Road, to an interchange with Highway 11. North of Highway 11, it leaves Regina and passes through the Sherwood Industrial Park before downgrading to a country road. The southern section of Pasqua Street begins at 3 Avenue N (one block south of Sherwood Drive), and is residential street that continues south to Wintergreen Estates (located just north of the Trans-Canada Highway), where it becomes Koester Road. The southern section is discontinuous, divided by two railways and Evraz Place (formerly known as Regina Exhibition Park). Pasqua Street is named after Chief Joseph Pasqua, a Plains Cree chief of the Qu'Appelle Valley in the mid-19th Century. Pasqua is a Cree word for prairie.  Lewvan Drive  Lewvan Drive is a four lane arterial road that begins at an interchange with the Trans- Canada Highway (Highway 1), travels north past the Regina International Airport, and ends at Sherwood Drive where the roadway continues as the northern section of Pasqua Street. Downtown Regina can be accessed via Saskatchewan Drive. Lewvan Drive is named after Lew Van Ostrand, an early settler south of Regina. When the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway arrived in 1911, the company purchased the townsite from Ostrand and combined the first two parts of his name to name the railroad in his honour.  History  Pasqua Street originally ran continuous as a collector road through western Regina, but as the city grew it did not have the capacity to function as a major north-south artery. The Lewvan Expressway (later renamed Lewvan Drive) was constructed along a former CN rail line which ran parallel to Pasqua Street, allowing for limited access and grade-separated railway crossings, and was completed in 1984. As part of the project, at-grade railway crossings along Pasqua Street were closed resulting in it being segmented.  Major intersections  From south to north.

She scored 1176/1200 in the 12th standard exams in the Tamil Nadu State Board. This would have secured her a medical seat, if only the State Board marks had been considered for admission. In NEET-UG 2017, Anitha secured 12.33 percentile while scored 86/720 marks. The minimum eligibility cut-off for making it into the merit list was 40 percentile for students in the reserved category. The minimum eligibility cut-off for making it into the merit list was 40 percentile ( [107 to 130] out of 720 marks ) for students in the reserved category., while it was 50 percentile for general category ( [131 to 697] out of 720 marks ). Anitha scored 12.33 percentile while admission was 14.9 for reserved and 18.2 for general categories for 2018 admission. Admission to medical colleges is based on NEET rank calculated by the percentage/percentile arrived with the highest score and not on the marks obtained in NEET exam. On 1 September 2017, she committed suicide by hanging. Her death created a major controversy in Tamil Nadu where the National Eligibility and Entrance Test for medical admissions was strongly opposed. She has become a cause celebre as a victim of the system. Background Anitha belonged to a poor Dalit family in Kuzhumur village, Ariyalur district in rural Tamil Nadu. Anitha was the daughter of a daily wage labourer and her mother had died when she was young. She was brought up by her grandmother and lived in a house without even a toilet. She studied in a Tamil Medium school and was amongst the toppers in her district and she was the only student in Ariyalur district to score 100% marks in Physics and Mathematics in the 12th standard examination. Anitha always wanted to become a doctor. She saw that it was not possible for poor rural students to afford expensive coaching needed to prepare for NEET exams and only if medical admission selections were done based on the 12th standard marks alone would rural students be able to get seats. Anitha was unable to meet the cutoff and secure a seat through NEET. Anitha was offered an aeronautical engineering course seat at the Madras Institute of Technology but as she only wanted to be a doctor she did not take up the offer. She would have been the first from her community in her village to become a doctor.  NEET court case The Tamil Nadu government originally considered reserving 85% of the seats to Tamil Nadu State Board students. The Madras High Court dismissed it after an appeal. Later Tamil Nadu government had also promised exemption from National Eligibility and Entrance Test for one year. However the Supreme Court of India dismissed Tamil Nadu government's plea after the central government refused to support Tamil Nadu's ordinance seeking exemption from NEET for one year. Anitha implead herself in the petition in the Supreme Court against NEET claiming it was against the interests of rural students after a case was filed by Central Board of Secondary Education students represented by senior advocate Nalini Chidambaram, wife of P. Chidambaram, who argued that admissions should be made only basis of NEET. After the Supreme Court of India verdict which stated that admissions should be made only based on NEET. Nalini Chidambaram stated, \\"Any further appeal against NEET can only be done to God,\\" and that the Tamil Nadu government could no longer do anything for State Board students after the Supreme Court verdict. The BJP led Central Government of India wants to implement NEET, but the state government did not approve NEET. The syllabus of Tamil Nadu schools were different from NEET syllabus. There was no clear understanding of the NEET syllabus. The government also did not take any steps to educate the students. Being from poor family, not having access to any NEET materials she was heart broken. If medical admissions had been held on the basis of Plus Two scores as was in vogue for the past decade, Anitha having scored centum in Physics, 199 in Chemistry and 194 in Biology (she also scored centum in Mathematics), would have secured a cut-off of 196.75 out of 200. Considering that the MBBS cut-off for Scheduled Caste candidates last year was only 191.25 last year, she would have, in all probability, bagged a seat in a sought after Government medical college. However, as admissions were conducted solely on the basis of NEET scores, Anitha did not qualify as she had scored just 86 marks out of 720 in the test. Anitha committed suicide by hanging herself nine days after the verdict. Protest #JusticeForAnitha protests at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi Her suicide led to protests all over Tamil Nadu against NEET after her death. Anitha's family refused Tamil Nadu government's compensation offer. The large scale protests led to the Supreme Court of India to ask the Tamil Nadu Government to control the protests.

Demonstrations and riots quickly reached neighboring southern towns. Protestors accused the government of rampant corruption, and demanded that the prime minister Zaid Al-Rifai be sacked; martial law be lifted; the electoral laws be reformed; and restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of the press be removed. The Jordanian economy was suffering a recession during that time after Jordan disengaged from the West Bank in 1988. King Hussein responded to the protests by sacking Al-Rifai, lifting martial law that had been in place since 1957, and resuming parliamentary elections that had been paused since 1967. The King also appointed a royal commission to draft the National Charter, a document with a timetable for reforms and democratization acts. Jordan held parliamentary elections on 8 November 1989, the first in 22 years, and the National Charter was drafted in 1990. Some Arab countries, primarily Saudi Arabia, were apprehensive about Jordan's democratization. Background A general election took place in 1967 just before Jordan lost the West Bank, and when the parliament's tenure ended in 1971, no elections could be held due to the fact that the West Bank was under Israeli occupation. In 1984, Hussein appointed a parliament from both banks of the Jordan River. Jordan's disengagement from the West Bank (renouncing claim of sovereignty and cutting administrative links) the previous year in July 1988, proved to be depressing for the economy. Jordan's foreign debt was double that of its gross national product (GNP). Jordan was combating an economic crisis with austerity measures, Western economists attributed the crisis due to government overspending. The Jordanian dinar had lost a third of its value in 1988. An IMF statement read: \\"Jordan agreed to strengthen foreign reserves, reduce inflation through tight credit policies and improve the current account balance. It also pledged to reform the tax system and reduce its budget deficit.\\" Protests On 16 April, the Government increased prices of gasoline, licensing fees, alcoholic beverages and cigarettes, between 15% to 50%, in a bid to increase revenues per an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF agreement was to enable Jordan to reschedule its $6 billion debt, and obtain loans totaling $275 million over 18 months. On 18 April, riots from Ma'an spread to other southern towns like Al-Karak and Tafila, where the New York Times reported that around 4,000 people gathered in the streets and clashed with the police. 6 protestors were killed, and 42 were injured, while 2 policemen were killed and 47 were injured in the clashes. Despite the fact that the protests were triggered by a troubling economic situation, the crowd's demands became political. Protestors accused the government of rampant corruption, and demanded that the prime minister Zaid Al-Rifai be sacked; martial law be lifted; the electoral laws be reformed; and restrictions on freedom of expression and freedom of the press be removed. Response Hussein relented to the demands by dismissing Zaid Al-Rifai, and appointing Zaid ibn Shaker to form a new government. In 1986 a new electoral law was passed, thus the decision to reintroduce parliamentary elections went smoothly. The cabinet passed amendments to the electoral law that excluded articles dealing with West Bank representation. In May 1989 just before the elections, Hussein announced his intentions of appointing a 60-person royal commission to draft a reformist document named the National Charter. The National Charter sought to set a timetable for democratization acts. Although most members of the commission were regime loyalists, it included a number of opposition figures and critics. Parliamentary elections were held on 8 November 1989, the first in 22 years (since 1967).Dieter Nohlen, Florian Grotz & Christof Hartmann (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume I, p148 The National Charter was drafted and ratified by parliament in 1991.

First struggles occurred at the very beginning of the existence of two conflict parties (7th and 8th century), they intensified in the 9th century, lessened during the 10th century, but intensified again since the beginning of the 11th century. From the year 1000 Venetian forces managed to subjugate a lot of coastal towns of the Byzantine Theme of Dalmatia, which was ceded from the Byzantine Emperor to the Croatian King. From the 1030s however, after the fall of Doge Otto Orseolo, Croatian kings Stjepan I and his son Petar Kre≈°imir IV succeeded in taking almost the whole coast back, so the latter carried the title King od Croatia and Dalmatia. Since 1085, following the agreement between Venice and Byzantine Empire, Venetians subsequently conquered the significant part of the Croatian coastline. During the 12th century, after Croatia entered a personal union with the Kingdom of Hungary, Croato-Hungarian kings Coloman and B√©la II managed to return a considerable territory of Dalmatia and Croatian Littoral to their kingdom, but occasional conflicts almost never ceased. Since that Croatian‚ÄìVenetian wars were technically theaters of the more wider Hungarian‚ÄìVenetian Wars. When Louis the Great, the new young king (ruled 1342‚Äì1382), decided to expel Venetians from his country, he launched a large campaign in 1356‚Äì1358 and forced them to withdraw from Dalmatia. Zadar Peace Treaty was signed on 18 February 1358 and the whole coast from eastern Istria to southern Dalmatia was set free. In 1409 the Republic of Venice used the opportunity of the dynastic struggle that occurred and bought Dalmatia for 100,000 ducats from the Croatian anti-king Ladislaus of Naples, establishing Venetian Dalmatia. Croatian Littoral and eastern Istria remained parts of Croatia, where Croats, together with their allies, rejected Venetian efforts to subject them and fought against Venetians in conflicts like War of the Holy League and Uskok War. Thus a couple of decades after the purchase of Dalmatia by Venice, the Croatian‚ÄìVenetian Wars became part of larger conflicts of the world's Great powers and were turned into the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian wars and Habsburg‚ÄìVenetian wars. Warfare until 887 Conflicts between Venetians and Croats, as well as other Slavic nations or tribes on the Adriatic coast, including Narentines, began very early, in the 7th and 8th century, because the Venetians demanded free passage for their merchant galleys and did not want to pay taxes to Croats. In the 9th century Venetian Doge Giovanni I Participazio fought against Narentines, but concluded a peace treaty in 830. A few years later another warfare broke out, but ended with a new peace treaty of 839 among Doge Pietro Tradonico, Duke Mislav of Croatia and Prince Dru≈æak (Drosaico) of the Narentines. Occasional hostilities started again a bit later and repeated several times during next years. The situation even worsened after Duke Domagoj acceded the Croatian throne (ruled 864-876). John the Deacon, Venetian Chronicler, wrote at the beginning of the 11th century that Domagoj was pessimus Sclavorum dux (meaning the worst Duke of Slavs), because of the latter's numerous wars, especially against the Venice the Arabs. The Venetian navy under command of Doge Orso I Participazio attacked Croatian territory in 865, having some success, and another peace agreement followed, securing the safe passage of Venetian ships in the Adriatic Sea. In 871 or 872 a new intense naval-commercial war on the sea between Croats and Venetians broke out, ending after Domagoj's death. One of the decisive battles for dominance in the Adriatic Sea in that period happened on 18. September 887 between the Narentines and Venetians at Makarska. Doge Pietro I Candiano led personally his fleet in a campaign against Narentines but they crushed his forces and killed him in the battle. Situation between 887 and 1000 Following Pietro Candiano's death, the Venetians started to pay Croats and Narentines an annual tribute for the right to sail and trade in the northeastern Adriatic. Between 887 and 948 there was no new war recorded between Venetians and Croats. In 948 Doge Pietro III Candiano launched a naval campaign to combat Narentines, but his military attempt failed. The result was a peace treaty that made the Most Serene Republic of Venice pay taxes for safe passage for the next 50 years. This situation lasted until the end of the 10th century. Having come to power, Doge Pietro II Orseolo began the period of southeastern expansion of Venice, refusing to pay tribute to Croats and launching military expeditions against them. After the death of King Stjepan Dr≈æislav in 997, Kingdom of Croatia was weakened due to the dynastic crisis and civil war that broke out among his three sons for the throne succession. This enabled Venetians in the following years to take control over Croatian towns and islands in the theme of Dalmatia. Warfare after 1000 The Venetian Armada led by Orseolo succeeded in taking over coastal towns from Rab (Arba) in the north to Dubrovnik (Ragusa) in the south, including islands of Vis (Issa), Lastovo (Lagosta) and Korƒçula (Curzola), either with using armed forces or calm surrender. The bloodiest conflict was the battle of Lastovo in 1000, at the end of which the town of Lastovo was completely destroyed and the survivors displaced. The Republic of Saint Mark secured its suzerainty over the area until the 1030s, after which the Croatian King Stjepan I, having come to power, took control over the town of Zadar. He and his son Petar Kre≈°imir IV succeeded in taking other coastal towns back from Venetians. Since 1085 however, following the Byzantine‚ÄìVenetian Treaty of 1082, Venice subsequently conquered a large part of the Croatian coastal and maritime territory. Depiction of the Siege of Zadar made by Andrea Vicentino In 1105 the new Croatian king, Coloman of Hungary, launched campaign against Venetians, which was approved by Byzantine Emperor, and returned the northeastern Adriatic coast under the crown. Ten years later, Doge Ordelafo Faliero managed to retake some of the disputed area: he conquered Zadar and several other towns but lost his life in a battle. A peace treaty was then concluded, according to which Zadar devolved upon Venice, while Biograd, ≈†ibenik, Trogir and Split remained in the Kingdom of Croatia in personal union with Hungary. A new Venetian military campaign was undertaken in 1125 and Doge Domenico Michele's forces captured Split and Trogir. King B√©la II liberated these two towns in 1133, but until the end of the 12th century several further naval campaigns of Venice followed, so that the warfare was almost permanent. In 1180 King B√©la III managed to free Zadar and the whole area between the rivers Krka and Neretva. Since Venetians did not give up subjugating Zadar, another war between Venice and the town of Zadar (supported by the King) broke out and lasted twenty years (1183-1203), ending with the Crusaders' capture of the town. Crusaders' capture of Zadar in 1202 The Crusaders' capture of Zadar was a consequence of an agreement between the crusaders and the Republic of Venice for transport across the sea, whose price far exceeded what the crusaders were able to pay. As a solution Venetians proposed that the crusaders help them capture Zadar, a constant battleground between Venice on one side and Croatia and Hungary on the other. Although many crusaders had refused to take part in the siege of the catholic town, the attack started in November 1202. After fierce fighting, Zadar fell on 24 November and the Venetians and the crusaders pillaged the town. After spending the winter in Zadar, the crusaders continued their campaign (Fourth Crusade) in the first days of the springtime. In 1203, Pope Innocent excommunicated the whole crusading army, along with the Venetians, for taking part in this attack, but Zadar remained under the control of Venice. Period between 1203 and 1358 During the periodical Venetian reign in Zadar in the 13th century and the first half of the 14th century, the citizens of Zadar rebelled several times against the authorities of the Most Serene Republic and had support of the Croato-Hungarian kings. Major armed conflicts were recorded in 1242, 1247, 1311 and 1345‚Äì1346. At the same time, the Venetian authorities forced Dubrovnik to accept their governor, after the local Rector Damjan Juda refused it and committed suicide in 1205. Having installed its own governor, Venice subsequently took control over the southernmost part of Croatian lands. In the north, Venetians ruled western and southern Istria from the 13th and 14th century, after military interventions in major towns, as follows: in Pula in 1148, 1243, 1267, 1331 and 1397; in Rovinj in 1283, in Poreƒç in 1354, in Novigrad in 1270 and 1358, in Umag in 1269 and 1370. The Republic wanted all the time to take central and eastern Istria as well, but never succeeded in achieving permanent control over Pazin area and eastern coast of the peninsula, despite many heavy military clashes with their German owners, whose seat was in the Pazin Castle. Although the local population was primarily Croatian, the feudal owners were of German descent and carried the title of Margraves of Istria. In 1342 Louis the Angevin became Croato-Hungarian king and the pushing of Venetian forces from the northeastern Adriatic area soon became one of the principal goals of his foreign policy. In 1346 he tried to help citizens of Zadar during the Venetian siege, but failed. In summer 1356 he launched a large military campaign and attacked all the Venetian held territories of his country. Within a year and a half, his armies entered Zadar, Split, Trogir, ≈†ibenik and other Croatian coastal towns. In the Treaty of Zadar, which was signed on 18 February 1358 in the Monastery of St. Francis, the Republic of Venice renounced all Dalmatian towns and islands between the Gulf of Kvarner and the Town of Draƒç/Durazzo (in present-day Albania) in favour of King. Uskoks attacking Venetian galley during the Uskok War Situation after 1358 The peace period after the Treaty of Zadar lasted in Dalmatia approximately 50 years. Following the dynasty crisis at the end of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th century, and the struggle for the crown between Sigismund of Luxembourg and Ladislaus of Naples, the latter sold in 1409 his rights over Dalmatia to the Republic of Venice for the sum of 100,000 ducats. This led to the formation of the Venetian Dalmatia, while Croatian Littoral, including the island of Krk, remained part of Croatia. Several decades later a new rising military force came to the area from the east, the mighty Ottoman Empire, and caused a new series of wars on the Croatian coast: Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian wars, Ottoman‚ÄìHabsburg wars and Habsburg‚ÄìVenetian wars (which included War of the Holy League, Uskok War and others).

The NW&CCR; was one of many underground railway schemes proposed for London following the opening in 1863 of the Metropolitan Railway, the world's first underground railway, but was one of only a few to be authorised by Parliament. The company struggled to raise funding for the construction of its line and was twice renamed, to the Euston, St Pancras and Charing Cross Railway and the London Central Railway, before the proposals were abandoned in 1874. North Western and Charing Cross Railway The Metropolitan Railway opened to the public on 10 January 1863 and was quickly seen as being a great success, carrying 9.5 million passengers in its first year. On 27 November 1863, the NW&CCR;'s private bill was announced, one of many speculative underground railways being promoted that hoped to emulate the MR's success. The NW&CCR;'s act received Royal assent on 29 July 1864, but most of the others were unsuccessful. The NW&CCR;'s proposed line was to run between the London and North Western Railway's (L&NWR;'s) terminus at Euston and the South Eastern Railway's (SER's) terminus at Charing Cross (then still under construction), with both mainline companies supporting the proposals. Like the MR, the NW&CCR; was to be constructed as a cut and cover tunnel running beneath roads and a new road south of Oxford Street was to be constructed along the proposed route. At the northern end, branches were proposed to connect to the MR near Portland Road (now Great Portland Street) and Gower Street (now Euston Square) stations and to the L&NWR; and the Midland Railway north of Euston station. At the southern end, the line was to come to the surface to connect to the SER's tracks on Hungerford Bridge. In 1866, a further act gave permission for the NW&CCR; to make agreements with the L&NWR; and the SER to operate trains over its line and to agree fares. The mainline companies were each to be offered half of the NW&CCR;'s shares. To fund construction of the railway, The NW&CCR; intended to pay the contractors constructing the line in its shares, which, it was expected, would increase in value and pay dividends once the railway was operational. This was a common method of payment for capital-intensive railway projects. To pay for the actual works during construction period, contractors were financed by banks; however, before work could start on the NW&CCR; a number of contractors and banks failed in the Panic of 1866, a major crash in the London and international stock markets, after which the NW&CCR; found it impossible to raise the funding it needed to begin construction and the proposals were abandoned in 1869. Euston, St Pancras and Charing Cross Railway and London Central Railway In November 1870, the NW&CCR;'s proposals were revived under a new name. The Euston, St Pancras and Charing Cross Railway (EStP&CCR;) proposals were similar to those of the NW&CCR.; A station was to be provided at Gower Street parallel and adjacent to the MR's station there to provide an interchange between the lines. Additional to the NW&CCR;'s proposals, two additional tunnels would have extended eastwards from the Gower Street station to connect to Euston station and the Midland Railway's recently opened St Pancras station. After the EStP&CCR; tunnel had passed under the MR's tunnel near the junction of Tottenham Court Road and Euston Road, the line would have run roughly south by south-east on the west side of Whitfield Street to the next station at Goodge Street and then a station at Oxford Street. South of Oxford Street, the line continued on a more southerly route to Leicester Square where a station was to be built on the north side of the square. The route would then have turned south-west to pass north of the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields before reaching the final station on the north side of Strand opposite the mainline station. Beyond the station the EStP&CCR; continued under Strand before rising to the surface between the mainline station and Villiers Street on a viaduct which would have connected to the SER's bridge over the River Thames as planned by the NW&CCR.; The tunnels were to be wide and high for use by the mainline companies' trains. Vents were to be provided along the route to allow smoke and steam to escape from the tunnels. Between Oxford Street and Chandos Street, a new road was to be constructed over the railway to which the Metropolitan Board of Works agreed to contribute ¬£200,000. The estimated costs of constructing the tunnels and new road were ¬£1.4 million and ¬£280,000 respectively. The EStP&CCR; act received Royal assent on 14 August 1871. Following this, the company changed its name to the London Central Railway (LCR), but, again, the company struggled to raise funding for the construction. In 1873, an extension of time was obtained to grant the LCR additional time to construct the railway, but proposals for an additional connection to King's Cross station and to the MR at St Pancras were rejected. The LCR's financial situation failed to improve and the proposal was abandoned again in 1874.

The Life of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo (Á®øÊú¨Â§©ÁêÜÊïôÊïôÁ•ñ‰ºù K≈çhon Tenriky≈ç Ky≈çso den), or The Life of Oyasama, is the biography of Nakayama Miki published and authorized by Tenrikyo Church Headquarters. The Life of Oyasama is one of the supplemental texts (Ê∫ñÂéüÂÖ∏ jun-genten) to the Tenrikyo scriptures, along with The Doctrine of Tenrikyo and Anecdotes of Oyasama. History Background Efforts to compile a biography of Nakayama Miki began not long after her death in 1887. An instruction recorded in the Osashizu, dated 13 October 1890, requested that the followers produce a record of Nakayama's life.Nakayama, Shozen. \\"The Doctrine and Practice of Tenrikyo.\\" The Theological Persepctives of Tenrikyo: In Commemoration of the Centennial Anniversary of Oyasama. ed. Oyasato Research Institute, Tenri University. Tenri, Japan. 1986. p.9. In response to this request, Nakayama Shinnosuke, the first Shinbashira, supervised the composition of the script for the Besseki lectures, which was completed in 1896. Based on this script, Nakayama Shinnosuke wrote a biography dated 3 July 1898 (referred to as the katakana version) and another one around 1907 (the hiragana version). Nakayama Shinnosuke's hiragana version became the basis of future biography compilations including The Life of Oyasama.Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion (1997). Ky≈çsoden hensan shi [Compilation history of the Foundress' biography]. In Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten. (pp. 279-280). Tenri, Japan: Tenriky≈ç D≈çy≈´sha. Besides Nakayama Shinnosuke's writings, a number of other writings containing biographical information were produced by various individuals. When the Tenrikyo followers made a written request in December 1886 to establish a church, four early Tenrikyo leaders ‚Äì K≈çda Ch≈´sabur≈ç, Shimizu Yonosuke, Moroi Kunisabur≈ç, and Masuno Sh≈çbei ‚Äì submitted Saisho no yurai (ÊúÄÂàù‰πãÁî±Êù•) along with the request. In 1891, Hashimoto Kiyoshi wrote Tenriky≈çkai yurai ryakki (Â§©ÁêÜÊïô‰ºöÁî±Êù•Áï•Ë®ò), which was written to be submitted to groups outside the church. During the church's efforts to obtain sectarian independence at the turn of the century, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters commissioned biographies from non- Tenrikyo writers, Udagawa Bunkai in 1900 and Nakanishi Ushir≈ç in 1902. Around this time Tenrikyo followers such as Okutani Bunchi and Masuno Michioki independently wrote biographies as well. In 1925, the Department of Doctrine and Historical Materials was founded. The department gathered historical materials and produced \\"The Life of Oyasama; with Revised Historical Data\\" (Âæ°ÊïôÁ•ñ‰ºùÂè≤ÂÆüÊ†°Ë®ÇÊú¨) around 1936.The Theological Persepctives of Tenrikyo: In Commemoration of the Centennial Anniversary of Oyasama. p.9.Oyasato Institute for the Study of Religion (1997).

This was later published in volumes 29, 30, 32, 37, and 47 of the journal Fukugen (Âæ©ÂÖÉ). Compilation In 1952, a group of scholars of Tenrikyo Church Headquarters known as the \\"K≈çki Committee\\" began to prepare a number of drafts of Oyasama's biography. In so doing, they decided to use the research of Nakayama Shinnosuke as the primary historical reference. The first draft was put together by an early Tenrikyo theologian, Ueda Yoshinaru, in the same year. All drafts from the first draft to the seventeenth draft (released 26 August 1955) were referred to as Tenriky≈ç ky≈çso den s≈çan (Â§©ÁêÜÊïôÊïôÁ•ñ‰ºùËçâÊ°à). The eighteenth draft was prepared on 18 October 1955. From this draft to the twenty-second draft (17 March 1956) are referred to as Tenriky≈ç ky≈çso den k≈çan (Â§©ÁêÜÊïôÊïôÁ•ñ‰ºùÁ®øÊ°à). After the release of the twenty-first draft in February 1956, the \\"16th Doctrinal Seminar\\" was held to discuss aspects of the draft that still needed improvement. Upon revision of the twenty-second draft, The Life of Oyasama, Foundress of Tenrikyo was published on October 26, 1956. Since its first publication, The Life of Oyasama has gone through two revisions. The first revision, published on 26 December 1981, made several historical corrections and additions. The second revision, published on 26 January 1986, changed certain expressions deemed unsuitable. The English translation has gone through three editions, the first in 1967, the second in 1982, and the third in 1996. Content The biography is labeled as a \\"manuscript edition\\" (Á®øÊú¨ k≈çhon) because further revisions may be made to the text in the future as more research is done.Preface to The Life of Oyasama: \\"...more detailed research and studies remain to be made on the numerals, notes, words, and phrases.\\" Further reading *Nakayama, S.

It transposes Bach's original down from the original E minor into B minor, with the steady sixteenth note figuration that was originally given by Bach to the left hand being instead assigned to the right hand. Siloti also adds a repeat of the entire work, in order to allow for a change of voicing where the melody in the left hand is emphasized. The chords in the left hand are arpeggiated; however according to Siloti's daughter Kyriena (to whom the work was dedicated), he would omit the arpeggiation on the first pass and restore it on the repeat in order to heighten the effect of the left-hand melody. It has been performed by many pianists, most famously Emil Gilels. The date of the arrangement is uncertain: it was first published by A. Gutheil of Moscow, and was performed by Siloti in public for the \\"first time\\" (according to an announcement in the Manchester Guardian) in February 1912.

He was a founder fellow of Kellogg College (1990) and is now dean of degrees and emeritus fellow of Kellogg College. He was educated at the Priory Grammar School, Shrewsbury (1953-1960), University College London (1960-1963) and Linacre College, Oxford (1964-1966). Trevor Rowley was a postgraduate student under the landscape historian W. G. Hoskins at Oxford University. After a short period teaching at a teacher training college in Birmingham, where he also worked as a part-time tutor for the Birmingham University Extra-Mural Department, he returned to Oxford in 1969. He was the first Staff Tutor in Archaeology and Local Studies, in what was then the Delegacy for Extra Mural Studies, based at Rewley House. During his time as Staff Tutor, later Director of Archaeology, he developed a thriving archaeology programme, which included conferences, professional training and excavations. From 1990 to 2000 he was the Deputy Director of what had by then become the Oxford University Department for Continuing Education. During this time he was responsible for several major initiatives, including collaboration with the Open University on award bearing courses, which eventually led to the department offering the part-time postgraduate degrees, the first part-time qualification provided by Oxford University. He was also responsible for creating the Oxford Experience based at Christ Church, Oxford, a popular and successful summer school programme that still runs over six weeks each summer. In 2000 he took early retirement to concentrate on full-time writing and lecturing.

He was considered a key theoretician for the development of the concrete art movement in Argentina in the 1940s and was a founding member of the international Latin American abstract art movement, Grupo Mad√≠.  Early life and education  Rothfuss was born in Montevideo, Uruguay. In 1938, Rothfuss studied art at C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes in Montevideo. He studied with the artists Guillermo Laborde and Jos√© C√∫neo. In the early 1940s, he studied at the Academia de Bellas Artes in Montevideo.  Career  In 1939 while at an Emilio Pettoruti art show, Rothfuss met and became friends with the artist, Carmelo Arden Quin. In 1942, Rothfuss moved from Uruguay to Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he lived until 1945. Rothfuss soon became friends with fellow artists, Gyula Kosice, Tom√°s Maldonado, Carmelo Arden Quin. In 1944, Rothfuss was part of the group of artists who created and edited the magazine called Arturo, which existed for only one issue, and included fellow artists, Carmelo Arden Quin, Edgar Bailey, Gyula Kosice, Ra√∫l Lozza, Tomas Maldonado, and Lidy Prati. Rothfuss contributed an article called: \\"El marco. un problema de la pl√°stica actual (The frame: A Problem of Plastic Arts Today),\\" which became an important text on the theory and movement of art towards geometry. Rothfuss was stating what was then a revolutionary idea, that he was advocation for the removal of the frame of the painting, saying that it got in the way of the art. In 1945, Rothfuss participated in two seminal concrete art exhibitions called Arte Concreto-Invenci√≥n in Buenos Aires. In 1945, Rothfuss participated in Asociaci√≥n Arte Concreto-Invenci√≥n's first two concrete art exhibitions organized at the homes of Swiss born psychoanalyst, Enrique Pichon-Rivi√®re, and German-Argentinian photographer, Grete Stern. Rothfuss also participated in the group's third exhibition organized in October 1946 at the Argentinian Society of Plastic Arts. During this time, to illustrate the concrete nature of his work, Rothfuss used nontraditional materials like diamonds and employed notched and irregular shapes in his artwork. From 1945 to 1950, Rothfuss created sculptures that had moving parts. In 1946, Rothfuss joined the Asociaci√≥n Arte Concreto-Invenci√≥n, a concrete art group founded by Tom√°s Maldonado in 1944. Other artists in the group included Alfredo Hlito, Lidy Prati, Manuel Espinosa, Enio Iommi, Raul Lozza among others. In 1946, Gyula Kosice, Carmelo Arden Quin, and Rothfuss founded the Grupo Mad√≠p.

The creek originates in the Doty Hills and is a tributary to the Chehalis River. The South Fork of Garrard Creek, ; Bloomquist Creek, ; and Kellogg Creek, , add to its length. The creek was originally called Barker Creek after Henry Barker, a native from Tennessee, who built a settlement in 1870 at the mouth of the creek. His stay in the settlement was short, and was transferred in 1874 to Oliver Brewer, a minister, and his family. In 1872, James Garrard and his family, settlers from Illinois, took a claim and became one of the first permanent residents in the valley. Garrard Creek road is named after the creek with one end near the mouth of the creek and primarily running along the south fork. Brooklyn Road has one end near the intersection of Garrard Creek and the other end outside of the watershed. The two roads are the only major roads serving the Garrard Creek Valley.

Metropolitan Museum of Art Portrait of Erasmus is a late period 1526 woodcut engraving by the German artist Albrecht D√ºrer. The portrait was commissioned by the Dutch Renaissance humanist Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam (c.1466-69 ‚Äì 1536) when the two men met in the Netherlands between 1520 and 1521. Erasmus was then at the height of his renown, and required representations of himself to accompany his writings. It was not completed until some six years later, but proceeds a number of preparatory sketches made at that time. It is not a close representation of Erasmus' physical characteristics, for which has sometimes been criticised, including by Erasmus himself, and by Martin Luther, with whom Erasmus had a prolonged and thorny relationship.Although an early supporter, by 1526 Erasmus had distanced himself from Luther in bitter terms It is today viewed by art historians as a pioneering capture of his moral integrity, intellectualism and scholarship, and is one of the most popular and recognisable portraits of the sitter. Commission Albrecht D√ºrer, Portrait of Erasmus, sketch: black chalk on paper, 1520. Erasmus was a renowned humanist scholar and theologian. He respected D√ºrer's stature, and seemingly greatly admired his work, but more his graphic woodcuts and drawings than his paintings.A taste that may have been more influenced by his humanist favour for economy over aesthetics. See Silver; Smith, 63 On January 8, 1525, Erasmus wrote, \\"I wish I could also be portrayed by D√ºrer. Why not by such an artist? But how could it be accomplished? He began my portrait in charcoal at Brussels, but he has probably put it aside long ago. If he could do it from my medal or from memory, let him do what he has done for you, that is, add some fat\\". In 1528, after the portrait was complete he wrote, \\"is it not more wonderful to accomplish without the blandishment of colors what Apelles accomplished with their aid?\\"Stechow, 123 The implication being that D√ºrer could achieve more with bare black lines than other 16th century artists -including D√ºrer himself- with expansive colours.Silver; Smith, 35 They met at least three times, during D√ºrer's 1520-21 visit to the Netherlands. Erasmus commissioned a portrait,Silver; Smith, 63 as he required a large number of portraits of himself to send to his correspondents and admirers throughout Europe. As recorded in his dairies, D√ºrer sketched Erasmus a number of times in charcoal during these encounters, but it was six years before he completed the engraving.\\"Erasmus of Rotterdam\\". Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 1 September 2017 Description Erasmus is shown in half-length, serious minded, standing and writing in his study.W√∂lfflin, 270 Before him are a number of books, intended to indicate his scholarship. The books serve a deeper purpose, indicating that both men made their names as a result of developments in printing.Hayum, 658 The lilies in a vase probably refer to the purity and incorruptibility of his mind and intentions. The Latin and Greek script behind him is framed on the wall as if a picture, and reads \\"This image of Erasmus of Rotterdam was drawn from life by Albrecht D√ºrer. The better portrait will his writings show. 1526. AD\\".D√ºrer extensively used the letters \\"AD\\", the Latinate form of his name, as his monograph in paintings, drawings and woodcuts. Art historical evaluation Hans Holbein, Portrait of Desiderius Erasmus. c 1520‚Äì40. Royal Collection, London Although the work is widely known and popular, early to mid 20th art historians viewed it with reserve. Both Heinrich W√∂lfflin and Erwin Panofsky described it in generally favourable terms, although W√∂lfflin wrote that it \\"lacked life\\",Hayum, 650 especially when compared to Hans Holbein's portraits of Erasmus. Similarly, Max Friedl√§nder described it as \\"hesitant\\" and without conviction. D√ºrer was not seeking to exactly reproduce the sitter's physical appearance, but more to represent \\"the better portrait will his writings show\\"; indicating that his words, rather than his physical features are the most noteworthy aspect for recording.Hayum, 654 According to Panofsky, \\"D√ºrer did his best to 'characterize' Erasmus by the paraphernalia of erudition and taste, with a charming bouquet of violets and lilies-of-the-valley testifying to his love of beauty and, at the same time, serving as symbols of modesty and virginal purity.\\" Panofsky concluded that Durer \\"failed to capture that elusive blend of charm, serenity, ironic wit, complacency, and formidable strength that was Erasmus of Rotterdam.\\"\\"Epistolarum, VII\\". Oxford, 1928, 376, no. 1985. Basel, 29 March 1528, to H. Botteus: \\"... Unde statuarius iste nactus sit effigiem mei demiror, nisi fortasse habet eam quam Quintinus Antuerpiae fudit aere. Pinxit me Durerius, sed nihil simile.\\" Erasmus himself was vocally unhappy with the final work, and in 1528, the year of D√ºrer's death, complained in a letter that the portrait did not physically resemble him. However, and although Erasmus often sough portraits of himself, he was rarely happy of the results. Of a minor Holbein portrait he wrote, \\"If Erasmus looked as young as that he would be thinking of taking a wife\\". Martin Luther (1483-1546) also disliked the engraving, but having publicly fallen out with Erasmus at the time, dryly observed that \\"no one is really pleased with his own likeness\\".Hayum, 655 References Notes Sources * Hayum, Andr√©e. \\"D√ºrer's Portrait of Erasmus and the Ars Typographorum\\".

It was broadcast on the Blue Network from October 19, 1937, until May 26, 1939, and was revived for a second run from October 5, 1942, until January 1, 1943. Format Don Winslow of the Navy was based on the comic strip of the same name, which was created by Frank V. Martinek. The title character was a commander in U.S. Naval Intelligence who \\"conducted a never-ending war through many of the chapters with a diabolical crime czar identified simply as the Scorpion.\\" In addition to the Scorpion, he \\"fought other subversive types whose scheming could lead to control of the universe.\\" Joel H. Spring, in his book, Images of American Life: A History of Ideological Management in Schools, Movies, Radio, and Television, pointed out the significance of the program beyond the level of entertainment: \\"The popular Don Winslow of the Navy carried a patriotic message in its programs ...\\" Moreover, he noted that the Scorpion was more than just an opponent in a story; the creed for the program's Squadron of Peace for listeners specified that the battle against Scorpion \\"represents the battle between Good and Evil.\\" The program's scripts, which contained much naval terminology, were checked for authenticity by the U.S. Navy. Critical reaction In 1937, the trade publication Radio Daily described Don Winslow of the Navy as \\"... one of the best and most wholesome in the action and thrill category for juvenile listeners.\\" In contrast, a reviewer for another trade publication, Billboard, panned a later episode of the program in the magazine's October 17, 1942, issue. The review said, in part: > Don Winslow of the Navy is introduced with a big build-up, airplane motors > roaring, shouts like \\"Stand by for action and adventure,\\" \\"All hands on deck > for Don Winslow,\\" salutes for the men of the Navy Air Corps 00 but what a > letdown when the guy finally makes his appearance. [The program] was > disappointingly unexciting and quiet. Personnel The title role was played by Bob Guilbert in the 1930s version, and Raymond Edward Johnson had the role in the 1940s version. Lieutenant Red Pennington was played by Edward Davison (1930s) and John Gibson (1940s). The supporting cast included Ruth Barth, Betty Lou Gerson, Betty Ito, and Lenore Kingston. The director was Ray Kremer. Albert Aley and Al Barker were writers. Squadron of Peace Listeners of Don Winslow of the Navy could join its Squadron of Peace club, which enabled them to aid Winslow in his missions. The club's creed began and ended as shown in this excerpt: \\"I consecrate my life to Peace and the protecting of all my Countrymen wherever they may be. ... Love your country, its flag and all the things for which it stands. Follow the advice of your parents and superiors and help someone every day.\\" Promotions In 1938, Kellogg's Wheat Krispies, which sponsored Don Winslow of the Navy, came out with a newly designed package as a tie-in with the program. An item in the trade publication Broadcasting reported, \\"The package front depicts a naval officer and a row of signal flags, while the rear of the box pictures a U.S. battleship with descriptions of the ship's functions.\\" Sales for home use In the 1970s, Don Winslow of the Navy was one of a number of old-time radio programs re-issued as George Garabedian Productions by MARK56 Records on long-playing records for purchasers to enjoy in their homes.

Supermicro's headquarters are located in Silicon Valley, with a manufacturing space in the Netherlands and a Science and Technology Park in Taiwan. Founded by Charles Liang, Wally Liaw and Sara Liu on November 1, 1993, Supermicro specializes in servers, storage, blades, rack solutions, networking devices, server management software and high-end workstations for data center, cloud computing, enterprise IT, big data, high performance computing (HPC), and embedded markets. In 2016, the company deployed thousands of servers into a single data center and was ranked the 18th fastest growing company on Fortune Magazine‚Äôs Top 100 list of the world‚Äôs largest US publicly traded companies in 2016 and the fastest growing IT infrastructure company.  History  San Jose Mercury News headquarters in 2009. Green Computing Park In September 2014, Supermicro moved its corporate headquarters to the former Mercury News headquarters in North San Jose, California along Interstate 880, naming the campus Supermicro Green Computing Park. In 2017, the company completed a new 182,000 square-foot manufacturing building on the campus. The main building was designed by Warren B. Heid in the modernist style, which was common for commercial buildings in the 1960s, and built by the Carl N. Swenson Company. During the time it served as the Mercury Newss headquarters, the main building was expanded from to . Until recently, a bronze sculpture, Chandelier by John Jagger, hung from the ceiling of an elliptical loggia at the entrance. The loggia is distinguished by a series of metal columns and the moat that surrounds it. Allegations of compromised hardware On October 4, 2018, Bloomberg Businessweek published a report, citing unnamed corporate and governmental sources, which claimed that the Chinese People's Liberation Army had forced Supermicro's Chinese sub-contractors to add microchips with hardware backdoors to its servers. The report claimed that the compromised servers had been sold to U.S. government divisions (including the CIA and Department of Defense) and contractors and at least 30 commercial clients (including Apple). The backdoor was reportedly discovered by Amazon during a review of Elemental Technologies, a Supermicro client that Amazon would acquire in 2015. Supermicro denied the report, stating that they had not been contacted by government agencies and were unaware of any investigation. Amazon and Apple also denied the Bloomberg claims, and the article has faced skepticism over its validity. One of its named sources stated that the attack detailed seemed theoretical and that he \\"couldn't rationalize in [his] head that this is the approach that anyone could take.\\" FBI director Christopher A. Wray, in testimony before the U.S. Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, commented, \\"Be careful what you read.\\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/10/fbi-director-wray-on-super-micro- servers-be-careful-what-you-read.html On October 22 Supermicro announced that \\"despite the lack of any proof that a malicious hardware chip exists\\" it was reviewing its motherboards for potential spy chips in response to the article. On October 9, 2018, Bloomberg issued a second report, alleging that Supermicro-manufactured datacenter servers of an unnamed U.S. telecom firm had been compromised by a hardware implant on an Ethernet connector. The report cited former Israel intelligence officer Yossi Appleboum, who had analyzed and documented the implant. The Bloomberg report did not connect these findings to the previous report. Appleboum has since said that his company had found such implants \\"...in different vendors, not just Supermicro...\\" Supermicro filed a letter with the Securities and Exchange Commission stating that it was \\"confident\\" that \\"no malicious hardware chip had been implanted\\" during the manufacture of its motherboards. It was also reported that the chief executives of Apple and Amazon Web Services rejected claims about the reports regarding hardware backdoors in Supermicro servers.

Located within the Roosevelt National Forest, the reservoir supplies water for irrigation and municipal water supply. The reservoir is owned by the Water Supply and Storage Company, based in Fort Collins. The city of Thornton owns a large proportion of the company's stock. Water from the reservoir makes its way to the Cache la Poudre River. It then flows down through Poudre Canyon to Colorado's Eastern Plains, where it is distributed. History The current dam is the third one to exist at the reservoir. Earlier dams burst in 1891 and 1904, causing much flooding and damage downstream. The present dam was built in 1910 and later renovated to increase its height to 58 feet. The renovations were completed in 1928. Chambers Lake receives water from Skyline Ditch, completed in 1894, and several creeks. The ditch carries water from the Laramie River, which is part of the North Platte River watershed. The lake itself and its drainage are part of the South Platte River watershed, so the ditch is an early example of an interbasin transfer in Colorado. Recreation The Forest Service operates the Chambers Lake Campground, near the lake. Given the area's high altitude, the campground has a short season and is only open from about the end of June to the end of September. The lake also offers fishing.

This date is celebrated annually on September 2.  History  In late April 1990, the Supreme Soviet of Moldova adopted a new national flag based on the Romanian tricolor flag, which set the stage for conflict between the Chi≈üinƒÉu government and the government in the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (PMSSR). Three days later, the Tiraspol City Council announced that it would not accept the new flag in the PMSSR, instead saying that the Flag of the Moldovan SSR claims precedence in the PMSSR. In the weeks that followed the decision, many cities in the PMSSR sided with the Tiraspol City Council, while enacting their own measures to counteract Chi≈üinƒÉu. The First Congress of People's Deputies of the PMSSR in 1990. On September 2, 1990, the then PMSSR declared its independence from the Moldovan SSR, becoming the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (PMR). This happened in response to fears of Moldova's unification with Romania following the fall of dictator Nicolae Ceau»ôescu, as well as hopes of the creation of a pro-Soviet republic that would remain in the USSR. 2 months later, the Moldovan authorities invaded Transnistria in an attempt to take control of the region.

The Doctrine of Tenrikyo (Â§©ÁêÜÊïôÊïôÂÖ∏ Tenrikyo kyoten) is the doctrine of the Tenrikyo religion, published and sanctioned by Tenrikyo Church Headquarters. The Doctrine of Tenrikyo is one of the supplemental texts (Ê∫ñÂéüÂÖ∏ jun-genten) of the Tenrikyo scriptures, along with The Life of Oyasama and Anecdotes of Oyasama. History Meiji doctrine Inoue Yorikuni, one of the authors of the Meiji doctrine. In May 1903, Tenrikyo Church Headquarters created a doctrine of the Tenrikyo teachings, referred to as the \\"Meiji doctrine\\" (ÊòéÊ≤ªÊïôÂÖ∏) or the \\"former doctrine\\" (ÊóßÊïôÂÖ∏) to distinguish it from the doctrine published after World War II. The doctrine's compilation was part of the church's effort to become an independent Shinto sect at the turn of the century, which would be achieved a few years later in 1908. Because the doctrine had to be authorized by the Shinto Main Bureau, an official government body, the Tenrikyo teachings presented therein conformed to State Shinto ideology, which promoted patriotism and reverence for the emperor. The Meiji Doctrine was divided into ten chapters ‚Äì 'Revering God,' 'Respecting the Emperor,' 'Loving the Nation,' 'Morality,' 'Accumulating Virtues,' 'Cleansing of Impurities,' 'Founding of the Teachings,' 'Repayment to God,' 'The Kagura', and 'Peace of Mind.' Tenrikyo Church Headquarters compiled the doctrine with the collaboration of scholars Nakanishi Ushir≈ç, Inoue Yorikuni, and Henmi Nakasabur≈ç, who were specialists in religion, kokugaku, and Japanese classics respectively. In the first half of the twentieth century, the Meiji doctrine was used in the schools of Tenrikyo's education system, such as Tenri Seminary. In 1912, two texts related to this doctrine, a commentary and a reference text, were published. Restoration After World War II and the assurance of religious freedom under the 1947 Constitution of Japan, a new doctrine based solely on Nakayama Miki's teachings was compiled. This doctrine was originally published by Tenrikyo Church Headquarters as Tenrikyo Kyoten (Â§©ÁêÜÊïôÊïôÂÖ∏) on October 26, 1949, with the authorization of Nakayama Shozen, the Second Shinbashira. Since then, the Tenrikyo Kyoten has undergone one revision in 1984. The first English edition of The Doctrine of Tenrikyo was published in 1954. The current edition is the tenth edition, published in 1993. Content The current Doctrine of Tenrikyo is primarily based on Tenrikyo's three scriptures, the Ofudesaki, Mikagura- uta, and the Osashizu. Other sources include an early biography of Nakayama Miki by her grandson Nakayama Shinnosuke, Shinnosuke's notes on Miki's teachings, and writings of those who heard Miki's teachings directly. Specifically regarding the Service, the Doctrine of Tenrikyo refers to Hitokotohanashi Dai San Kan, and regarding Tenri-O-no-Mikoto, the Doctrine of Tenrikyo refers to A Study on \\"God,\\" \\"Tsukihi,\\" and \\"Parent\\" („ÄåÁ•û„Äç„ÄåÊúàÊó•„ÄçÂèä„Å≥„Äå„Çí„ÇÑ„Äç„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶ Kami Tsukihi oyobi Oya ni tsuite).

Though he was also a film director, actor and producer, he is most famously remembered for working behind the camera in films directed by Humayun Ahmed and other legendary film makers including Shibli Sadik and Alamgir Kumkum. Family Mahfuzur Rahman Khan was born 10 May 1949 to the renowned family of Hakim Habib Ur Rahman Road in Old Dhaka. He was the eldest of six brothers and three sisters. From a young age Mahfouz was drawn to photography, very much inspired by the photographs his father took with his 120 film box camera. Before he was sent to boarding school at Dhaka Residential Model College, Mahfouz inherited his father‚Äôs camera. Back then, it would take a week for photos to come back from the developers and there was much anticipation. When his friends saw his photographs he would receive many compliments and much praise from them. Spouse He was husband to Dr Nirafat Alam Shipra who made major contributions in her field of working with deaf children in education. She died from cancer in 2001. Career After passing his matric his wish was to study Photography abroad, but was advised to work for six months to a year first to gain experience. Taking this advice he began working as an assistant film director in 1966. Although his eye for calculating frames and imagining shots in his mind was invaluable to this role, his heart was really set on being a cinematographer. Whilst on set, two of the camera assistants sensed his desire and so in the evenings they would teach Mahfouz the fine art of loading a film camera. This meant splitting 1000 film reels into three parts (300, 300, and 400) in a completely dark room, measuring by hand and the imagination. He loved this process, his favourite part was hearing the click sound of the shutter after loading the film. In 1972 he started his professional work as a cinematographer for the movie Kaccher Gore. His teacher was renowned cinematographer Abdul Latif Bachchu. From the outset he was fortunate to work with very experienced talented cinematographers like Shadon Roy, Baby Islam, Abdul Salam, Abzal Chowdury, Arun Roy, Rafiqul Bari Chowdhury who he recounted would pick up his phone call at 3AM if he needed help and Abdus Samad who gave him precious advice on shooting in black and white. In 1985 Mahfouz received his first national award for Obhijan. He soon became known simply by his first name and many would affectionately say ‚Äòwhen Mahfuz ur Rahman is the cameraman on a film then you don't need direction‚Äô. He would receive nine more national awards after this. Four of these were films directed by acclaimed writer and director Humayun Ahmed. He spoke highly of working with Ahmed: ‚Äòwhen he would describe his stories to me the images would come alive before my eyes‚Äô. Later he also became involved in producing films and played an important role in nurturing the next generation of cinematographers. He noted how proud he was of A.R. Jahangir, Z.H.Mintu, Mubjibul Haque Buhiya and Assad Uzzaman Majnu to name a few. The belief he shared with newcomers was ‚Äòif you do your work with love, you will only progress..‚Äô with his life being a testament to that. Mahfouz Ur Rahman worked as a cinematographer for over 40 years, working on over 200 films. Amidst such a prolific and phenomenal career he would say ‚ÄòI am learning everyday, I am not satisfied. In my life, my best work is yet to be done‚Ä¶. I want to make something that after I die, I will live on through it‚Äô. Acting His acting debut was in Alamgir Kumkum's Liberation War film: Amar Jonmobhumi (1973). He also played lead roles in the films: Jalader Darbar, Dabi (1978), Alo Chhaya and Cholo Ghor Badhi. However, as cinematography was his main interest, he pursued it as his career. To him it was ‚Äòthe most joyful work in the world‚Äô and came much more easily to him than acting. Awards He won the Bangladesh National Film award for Best Cinematography a record ten times for the films Obhijan (1984), Sohojatri (1987), Poka Makorer Ghor Bosoti (1996), Srabon Megher Din (1999), Dui Duari (2000), Hajar Bachhor Dhore (2005), Amar Ache Jol (2008), Ghetuputra Komola (2012) and Padma Patar Jol (2015). * Cultural Reporters' Association Award (2003) * Bangladesh Cholochitra Sangbadik Samity (eight times) * Meril Protom Alo award Death Mahfuzur Rahman Khan died on December 6, 2019 at the age of 70.

In a condolence message she prayed for the eternal peace of his departed soul and conveyed profound sympathy to the bereaved family. His colleague, Mushfiqur Rahman Gulzar, general secretary of Bangladesh Film Director's Association said ‚Äòhe never misbehaved with anyone. He also helped many upcoming cinematographers.

The company, founded by woodworker Albert Schoenhut, initially made toy pianos. They began to produce figurines in the early 1900s, including wooden circus-themed sets and animals. The company introduced the Schoenhut Art Doll in 1911, a spring-jointed doll made entirely of wood. It was the first doll in the world able to be manipulated and posed. The company ceased making dolls after its bankruptcy in 1935. Though it was revived the following year, it only produced toy pianos. History Early figurines and dolls The Schoenhut Company began producing dolls as early as 1903 with the production of the Humpty Dumpty Circus set, featuring lady and gentleman acrobats, a lion tamer, a lady circus rider, and a ringmaster. In 1908, Rolly Dolly dolls were created, which featured pear-shaped bodies with weights inside that allow the toy to bob back and forth without tipping over. A fifty- three piece set called Teddy Roosevelt's Adventures in Africa was also made, based on the Smithsonian‚ÄìRoosevelt African Expedition. All-Wood Perfection Art Doll After submitting a patent application 1909, the company patented the All-Wood Perfection Art Doll in 1911, which featured solid wood heads (some with carved hair, and others with wigs), compressed spring metal joints, and holes in the feet, which allows the dolls to be manipulated and posed on stands. They were the first dolls produced in the world that were able to do this. Various styles of the dolls existed, in 14-inch, 16-inch, 19-inch and 21-inch sizes. Face variations included a character face with carved hair and intaglio eyes; a character face with wig and intaglio eyes; a girl adorning a bonnet, with the cap molded to the head; Schnickel-Fritz, which featured molded wavy hair and squinting painted-on eyes; Tootsie Wootsie, with lightly molded short hair; and an African American doll with molded curly hair. Sleepy-eyed child dolls were also produced, which featured eyes that close upon laying the doll horizontal. A Dolly Face style was produced in 1915, which featured rounded cheeks and eyes. Schoenhut Art Dolls, in addition to many other early toys made by the company, have become collector's items. According to a 2008 appraisal, ‚Äì Schoenhut dolls with carved hair and intaglio eyes were worth an estimated USD$2,800‚Äì2,900.

He is best known for his abstract sculptures and is considered one of the pioneers of modern sculptures in Turkey. One of his famous sculptures is Ku≈ülar (\\"The Birds\\"), which he created in 1967. Private life Kuzgun Acar was born to Nazmi Acar of Libyan descent, and his wife Ay≈üe Zehra of Ethiopian origin in Istanbul, Turkey on 28 February 1928. He had a poor childhood and youth. He finished high school at ƒ∞stanbul Sultanahmet Ticaret Lisesi, and in 1948 joined the sculpture department of the Academy of Fine Arts, (now Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University). He was a student of Rudolf Belling (1886‚Äì1972). In his academy years, influenced by Hadi Bara (1906‚Äì1971), he leaned towards more abstract figures. In 1953, he graduated from the academy. He married M√ºnire Abdusef in 1955. In 1965, he married Bilge Berker, who bore him a son named Yunus in 1966. He married for a third time in 1971 to Fersa Pulhan. Acar died on 4 February 1976 aged 47 from intracerebral hemorrhage, following his fall from a ladder while he was working on a wall relief. He was interred at Zincirlikuyu Cemetery. Career He worked with wire mesh, making sculptures reminiscent of Naum Gabo (1890‚Äì1977). He taught painting at Istanbul Atat√ºrk High School and painting-sculpturing at the high school he finished. He displayed his sculpture works in wire at a personal exhibition in the American news Center in 1957. Between 1958 and 1960, he experimented making various forms with wire, nails, metal bars and scrap by gas welding. He performed experiments in enameling. His work, created with nails, was awarded the first prize at the Biennale de Paris in 1961. This award became a turning point for him, because he won one of the two scholarships allocated to foreigner young artists by the Paris Biennale. Acar went to Paris on the scholarship and worked there for one year. His work was displayed in the Musee d'Art in 1962. His worj and his to designs were acquired by the museum. Returned home, he won the first prize with his iron sculpture at the 23rd State Painting and Sculpture Exhibition in 1962. He took part at the Museum of modern art in Le Havre and Galerie Lacloche in Paris with his private exhibition in 1962 and 1963. His next exhibitions were for painting at Deutsches Kulturzentrum in Istanbul, and for sculptures in 1966 at Mus√©e Rodin in Paris. In 1966, he created his well-known public works \\"Ku≈ülar (\\"The Birds\\") placed in Istanbul and \\"T√ºrkiye\\" (\\"Turkey\\") in Ankara. In 1968, he produced masks for street theater artists. In 1975, he accompanied the Turkish theater company to Paris and created the masks for the play The Caucasian Chalk Circle. The 140 masks made of steel and rubber used in World War II are important works. Politics After Acar joined the socialist Workers Party of Turkey in the 1960s. His works did not find buyers, so had to earn a living as a fisherman and barkeeper. He accompanied the street theater \\"Devrim ƒ∞√ßin Hareket\\" (\\"Movement for Revolution\\"), which played at squares, strikes and protest rallies in 1968. He joined a group of foreign mountaineers to Eastern Anatolia for the shooting of a documentary movie promoted by the daily Milliyet's campaign \\"Boƒüaz'a Deƒüil Zap Suyu'na K√∂pr√º\\" (\\"A Bridge to the River Zap, not to the Bosphorus\\"). In 1972, he was detained by the military regime of 1971. Works ;Ku≈ülar (1967) Acar's metal sculpture Ku≈ülar (\\"The Birds\\") was selected to be displayed on the front facade of the ƒ∞M√á ƒ∞stanbul Manifaturacƒ±lar √áar≈üƒ±sƒ± (Istanbul Manufacturers Bazaar), located on Atat√ºrk Boulevard between the Valens Aqueduct and the Unkapanƒ±. After hanging there for some time, the sculpture was damaged due to exposure to the elements, and was taken down to be restored. When it was taken down, it was noticed that the damage was much more severe than initially thought. The very extensive restoration efforts led by assistant professor √ñzer Aktimur took three years. It was on display, for the first time in a museum environment, until 23 October 2016 and then was returned to its original place at the \\"ƒ∞M√á\\" building. ;Masks Acar made 140 masks for the Kafkas Tebe≈üir Dairesi. Some of Acar's works at public places caused controversy, and were removed and put in storage. His 1966-created large-scale metal sculpture titled \\"T√ºrkiye\\", which stood in front of the Emek Business Center in Kƒ±zƒ±lay, Ankara and depicted the lost lands in Anatolia due to becoming arid, was removed later, put in a storage and sold later for scrapping. His 1974-created, -high metal relief composition made of automobile parts and scrap iron, which was placed on a wall at the social facilities of \\"Maden-ƒ∞≈ü Sendikasƒ±\\" (\\"Miners Union\\") in G√∂nen and depicted a worker, his family and employer, was removed after the 1980 military coup and put in storage. In 1997, as it was remembered, it was taken out from storage and was put in its original place. His 1975-created giant sculpture in the form of a hand in honor of former governor of Antalya Ha≈üim ƒ∞≈ücan was removed some time later and put in storage.

She then sailed from Africa on 30 April 1790, and arrived at Jamaica in June 1790. She had embarked 242 slaves and disembarked 240, for an unusually low loss rate of 0.8%. Second slave trading voyage (1790-1791): Captain Diederick Woolbert sailed from Jamaica in August, straight back to Africa. Experiment starting to gather slaves on 9 November, first at Cape Coast Castle and then at Anomabu. She left on 8 December, and arrived back at Kingston 5 February 1791. She had embarked 238 slaves and she landed 232, for a still low loss rate of 2.5%. She arrived back in England on 20 May 1791. Third slave trading voyage (1791-1792): Captain Woolbert sailed from London 28 June 1791. Experiment started gathering her slaves, again at Cape Coast Castle and then Anomabu, on 14 September. She left Africa on 10 October and arrived at Kingston, Jamaica, on 13 February 1792. She had embarked 239 slaves and she landed 238, for a loss rate of 0.4%.

History Thomas Tew sailed from Rhode Island in 1692 on his first ‚Äúpirate round‚Äù voyage, which took him around the coast of Africa, to Madagascar, and into the Red Sea. There they captured a Muslim pilgrim ship carrying fantastic wealth, which they looted and shared. They returned to New England in 1694 with their riches, where Tew prepared to make a second voyage. Edward Woodman appears as a signatory to Tew‚Äôs Articles, or pirate code. The 200-ton, 40-gun slave ship Prophet Daniel sailed from England to Madagascar in 1698; the voyage‚Äôs cargo master was John Cruger, future New York alderman and mayor. They put into Abraham Samuel‚Äôs pirate trading post at Fort Dauphin on Madagascar in early 1699 to collect slaves and were soon drinking with the crew of another ship at anchor in the harbor. The second ship was the Beckford Galley of pirate Evan Jones; that night his men seized the Prophet Daniel after conspiring with some of its disgruntled crew. Cruger tried to retake the ship but was prevented by Samuel after Jones promised to give the Prophet and its slaves to Samuel. Jones sailed away, and Cruger took passage back to New York aboard a visiting merchantman. Samuel then sold the looted Prophet Daniel to Woodman and three other pirates who had been ashore at Madagascar (Isaac Ruff, Thomas Wells, and Edmond Conklin). He gave the four pirates a written bill of sale for the Prophet, which he sold for 1400 pieces of eight. They returned to America the year after: Conklin‚Äôs name appears on a Rhode Island will in 1700, stating that he owned one-quarter of a captured ship called Greyhound. This may have been the Prophet renamed, and Woodman and the others may have jointly owned the ship. In a letter to Secretary of State Charles Hedges in January 1706, Woodman was named as one of several pirates based out of the Dutch colony at St. Thomas.

Diamonds not much larger than molecules are abundant in meteorites and some of them formed in stars before the Solar System existed. High pressure experiments suggest large amounts of diamonds are formed from methane on the ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune, while some planets in other planetary systems may be almost pure diamond. Diamonds are also found in stars and may have been the first mineral ever to have formed. Meteorites Artist's conception of a multitude of tiny diamonds next to a hot star. In 1987, a team of scientists examined some meteorites and found grains of diamond about 2 nanometers in diameter (nanodiamonds). Trapped in them were noble gases whose isotopic signature indicated they came from outside the Solar System. Analyses of more meteorites found nanodiamonds from many different stars. The record of their origins was preserved despite a long and violent history that started when they were ejected from a star into the interstellar medium, went through the formation of the Solar System, were incorporated into a planetary body that was later broken up into meteorites, and finally crashed on the Earth's surface. In meteorites, nanodiamonds make up about 3 percent of the carbon and 400 parts per million of the mass. Grains of silicon carbide and graphite also have anomalous isotopic patterns. Collectively they are known as presolar grains or stardust and their properties constrain models of nucleosynthesis in giant stars and supernovae. It is unclear how many nanodiamonds in meteorites are really from outside the Solar System. Only a very small fraction of them contain noble gases and until recently it was not possible to study them individually. On average, the ratio of carbon-12 to carbon-13 matches that of the Earth's atmosphere while that of nitrogen-14 to nitrogen-15 matches the Sun. Techniques such as atom probe tomography will make it possible to examine individual grains, but due to the limited number of atoms, the isotopic resolution is limited. If most nanodiamonds did form in the Solar System, that raises the question of how this is possible. On the surface of Earth, graphite is the stable carbon mineral while larger diamonds can only be formed in the kind of temperatures and pressures that are found deep in the mantle. However, nanodiamonds are close to molecular size: one with a diameter of 2.8 nm, the median size, contains about 1800 carbon atoms. In very small minerals, surface energy is important and diamonds are more stable than graphite because the diamond structure is more compact. The crossover in stability is between 1 and 5 nm. At even smaller sizes, a variety of other forms of carbon such as fullerenes can be found as well as diamond cores wrapped in fullerenes. The most carbon-rich meteorites, with abundances up to 7 parts per thousand by weight, are ureilites. These have no known parent body and their origin is controversial. Diamonds are common in highly shocked ureilites, and most are thought to have been formed by either the shock of the impact with Earth or with other bodies in space. However, much larger diamonds were found in fragments of a meteorite called Almahata Sitta, found in the Nubian desert of Sudan. They contained inclusions of iron- and sulfur-bearing minerals, the first inclusions to be found in extraterrestrial diamonds. They were dated at 4.5 billion-year-old crystals and were formed at pressures greater than 20 gigapascals. The authors of a 2018 study concluded that they must have come from a protoplanet, no longer intact, with a size between that of the moon and Mars. Infrared emissions from space, observed by the Infrared Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope, has made it clear that carbon- containing molecules are ubiquitous in space. These include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), fullerenes and diamondoids (hydrocarbons that have the same crystal structure as diamond). If dust in space has a similar concentration, a gram of it would carry up to 10 quadrillion of them, but so far there is little evidence for their presence in the interstellar medium; they are difficult to tell apart from diamondoids. A 2014 study led by James Kennett at the University of California Santa Barbara identified a thin layer of diamonds spread over three continents. This lent support to a contentious hypothesis that a collision of a large comet with the Earth about 13,000 years ago caused the extinction of megafauna in North America and put an end to the Clovis culture. Planets Solar System Uranus, imaged by Voyager 2 in 1986. In 1981, Marvin Ross wrote a paper titled \\"The ice layer in Uranus and Neptune‚Äîdiamonds in the sky?\\" in which he proposed that huge quantities of diamonds might be found in the interior of these planets. At Lawrence Livermore, he had analyzed data from shock-wave compression of methane (CH4) and found that the extreme pressure separated the carbon atom from the hydrogen, freeing it to form diamond. Theoretical modeling by Sandro Scandolo and others predicted that diamonds would form at pressures over 300 gigapascals (GPa), but even at lower pressures methane would be disrupted and form chains of hydrocarbons. High pressure experiments at the University of California Berkeley using a diamond anvil cell found both phenomena at only 50 GPa and a temperature of 2500 kelvins, equivalent to depths of 7000 kilometers below Neptune's cloud tops. Another experiment at the Geophysical Laboratory saw methane becoming unstable at only 7 GPa and 2000 kelvins. After forming, denser diamonds would sink. This \\"diamond rain\\" would convert potential energy into heat and help drive the convection that generates Neptune's magnetic field. There are some uncertainties in how well the experimental results apply to Uranus and Neptune. Water and hydrogen mixed with the methane may alter the chemical reactions. A physicist at the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin showed that the carbon on these planets is not concentrated enough to form diamonds from scratch. A proposal that diamonds may also form in Jupiter and Saturn, where the concentration of carbon is far lower, was considered unlikely because the diamonds would quickly dissolve. Experiments looking for conversion of methane to diamonds found weak signals and did not reach the temperatures and pressures expected in Uranus and Neptune. However, a recent experiment used shock heating by lasers to reach temperatures and pressures expected at a depth of 10,000 kilometers below the surface of Uranus. When they did this to polystyrene, nearly every carbon atom in the material was incorporated into diamond crystals within a nanosecond. Extrasolar On Earth, the natural form of silicon carbide is a rare mineral, moissanite. In the Solar System, 70% to 90% of the rocky planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) consist of silicates. By contrast, stars with a high ratio of carbon to oxygen may be orbited by planets that are mostly carbides, with the most common material being silicon carbide. This has a higher thermal conductivity and a lower thermal expansivity than silicates. This would result in more rapid conductive cooling near the surface, but lower down the convection could be at least as vigorous as that in silicate planets. One such planet is PSR J1719-1438 b, companion to a millisecond pulsar. It has a density at least twice that of lead, and may be composed mainly of ultra-dense diamond. It is believed to be the remnant of a white dwarf after the pulsar stripped away more than 99 percent of its mass. Another planet, 55 Cancri e, has been called a \\"super-Earth\\" because, like Earth, it is a rocky planet orbiting a sun-like star, but it has twice the radius and eight times the mass. The researchers who discovered it in 2012 concluded that it was carbon-rich, making an abundance of diamond likely. However, later analyses using multiple measures for the star's chemical composition indicated that the star has 25 percent more oxygen than carbon. This makes it less likely that the planet itself is a carbon planet. Stars It has been proposed that diamonds exist in carbon- rich stars, particularly white dwarfs; and carbonado, a polycrystalline mix of diamond, graphite and amorphous carbon and the toughest natural form of carbon, could come from supernovae and white dwarfs. The white dwarf, BPM 37093, located away in the constellation Centaurus and having a diameter of , may have a diamond core, which was nicknamed Lucy. This gigantic diamond is likely one of the largest in the universe. In 2008, Robert Hazen and colleagues at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C. published a paper, \\"Mineral evolution\\", in which they explored the history of mineral formation and found that the diversity of minerals has changed over time as the conditions have changed. Before the Solar System formed, only a small number of minerals were present, including diamonds and olivine. The first minerals may have been small diamonds formed in stars because stars are rich in carbon and diamonds form at a higher temperature than any other known mineral.

In September 2017, the Memphis City Council passed an ordinance to remove Confederate statues from public parks, including the Nathan Bedford Forrest Monument and the Jefferson Davis Monument, after October 13, 2017, due in part to increased police expenditure, to control protesters and anti-protesters, since the Unite the Right rally of August. On December 20, 2017, the Memphis City Council unanimously approved the sale of Health Sciences Park to Memphis Greenspace for $1,000.00, allowing Memphis Greenspace to remove the monument. The monument, along with a statue of Jefferson Davis, were removed that evening. In May 2018, the Memphis Flyer reported that Memphis Greenspace plans to sell the Nathan Bedford Forrest Monument and the statue of Davis. Potential buyers must be nonprofit organizations who will agree to maintain the statues and display them in public somewhere outside of Shelby County, Tennessee. The following month, The Daily News revealed that Memphis Greenspace had received numerous offers to take the Forrest and Davis statues, including from Tennessee legislators, sites associated with the American Civil War, the Jefferson Davis Presidential Library and Museum, and the city of Savannah, Georgia.

After the Guanzi political and philosophical compendium included the Neiye around the 2nd century BCE, it was seldom mentioned by Chinese scholars until the 20th century, when it was reevaluated as a \\"proto-Daoist\\" text that clearly influenced the Daode jing, Zhuangzi, and other classics. Neiye traditions also influenced Chinese thought and culture. For instance, it had the first references to cultivating the life forces jing \\"essence\\", qi \\"vital energy\\", and shen \\"spirit\\", which later became a fundamental concept in Daoist Neidan \\"internal alchemy\\", as well as the Three Treasures in traditional Chinese medicine. Book The sinologist A. C. Graham regards the Neiye as \\"possibly the oldest 'mystical' text in China\\" (1989: 100). The professor of religious studies Harold D. Roth describes it as \\"a manual on the theory and practice of meditation that contains the earliest references to breath control and the earliest discussion of the physiological basis of self-cultivation in the Chinese tradition\\" (1991: 611‚Äì2), and perhaps the oldest extant text of Daoism (1994: 37). Title The title is a compound of two common Chinese words: n√®i ÂÜÖ meaning \\"inside; inner; internal\\" and y√® Ê•≠ \\"work; deed; achievement; production\\". In ancient Old Chinese that was used when the Neiye was compiled, the two titular component words had complex meanings. Bernhard Karlgren's classic Grammata Serica Recensa dictionary translates n√®i ÂÖß as \\"enter; to bring in, to present; take to heart\\"; and says the early characters for y√® Ê•≠ depicted a \\"horizontal board of a bell stand or frame\\", which was used as a phonetic loan character for \\"initiate; work; action; deed; profession; fortune, inheritance; strong; terrible\\" (1957: 695e, 640a) While many English- language authors transliterate the ÂÖßÊ•≠ title as Neiye or Nei-yeh, some translate it as: *The Workings of the Inner (Riegel 1978) *Inner Workings (Rickett 1985) *Operation of the Inner (Harper 1987) *Inner Cultivation or Inner Development (Kirkland 1997, 2008) *Inward Training (Graham 1989, Roth 1999) *Inner Training (Campany 2005) *The Inner Enterprise (Eno 2005) A. C. Graham's and Harold D. Roth's Inward Training is apparently the most common English title, owing to Roth's Neiye articles and translation (1991, 1994, 1996, 1997, and 1999). In modern Standard Chinese construction and engineering usage, n√®iy√® ÂÖßÊ•≠ or ÂÜÖ‰∏ö can historically refer to the ancient Daoist text, but more commonly designates \\"interior work; office work\\", as opposed to w√†iy√® Â§ñÊ•≠ or Â§ñ‰∏ö \\"field operation; field work\\" (Wenlin 2016). Literary form The Neiye ÂÖßÊ•≠ is a collection of poetic verses describing a method of guided breathing meditation and the underlying cosmology of the Dao on which it is based. Roth calls the mystical method \\"inner cultivation\\", the goal of which is to directly apprehend this \\"all-pervading cosmic force\\" (1999: 11). The text contains a total of 1,622 characters, and the verses are written almost exclusively in rhymed prose. Most of the lines of verse are tetrasyllabic, that is, they contain four syllables each of which is represented by one character, but other patterns of five or more syllables sometimes occur. The rhymes occur most often at the end of every second line (Roth 1999: 12). Both the Neiye's rhymed literary form and philosophical content are similar to the more renowned Daode jing, which is about three times longer (Kirkland 2008: 771). Take for example, Verse 2 (with rhyme words shown in Old Chinese reconstruction) discussing jing \\"vital energy\\": > Therefore this vital energy is: Bright!‚Äîas if ascending the heavens [Â§© > *ten]; Dark!‚Äîas if entering an abyss [Ê∑µ *wen]; Vast!‚Äîas if dwelling in an > ocean [Êµ∑ *xm…ô…£]; Lofty!‚Äîas if dwelling on a mountain peak [Â±∫ *ki…ô…£]. > Therefore this vital energy Cannot be halted by force, [Âäõ *li…ôk] Yet can be > secured by inner power [Âæ∑ *t…ôk]. Cannot be summoned by speech, Yet can be > welcomed by the awareness [ÊÑè *Àëi…ô…£]. Reverently hold onto it and do not lose > it: This is called \\"developing inner power\\" [Âæ∑ *t…ôk]. When inner power > develops and wisdom emerges, The myriad things will, to the last one, be > grasped [Âæó *t…ôk]. (tr. Roth 1999: 48‚Äì49) Scholars infer two kinds of contextual evidence that the redactor of an initial written Neiye edition brought together a series of originally distinct verses: the variety of meter and rhyme in the lines, and the two usages of the conjunction sh√¨g√π ÊòØÊïÖ ‚Äútherefore\\" (Roth 1999: 14). Riegel proposes that these poetic features of the Neiye would have facilitated memorization and recitation, suggesting that they might have been transmitted orally for a period of time before the compiler assembled and wrote them down. (1978: 148) Although extant editions of the Neiye text have only two or three general divisions, it is possible to identify distinct units based on semantic, syntactic, and phonological criteria. Some different proposed textual separations are: fifteen separate verses with some subdivisions (Ma Feibai È¶¨ÈùûÁôæ, W. Allyn Rickett 1985‚Äì98); eighteen verses plus four subdivisions (Gustav Haloun and Jeffrey Riegel 1978); and twenty-six separate verses (Roth 1999: 14). Dating The date when the Neiye was compiled is uncertain. Rickett dated the text to the late 4th or early 3rd century BCE, Graham to the 4th, and Roth to the mid-4th (Kirkland 1997: 3); it is thus generally dated to around 350‚Äì300 BCE (Kirkland 2008: 771). Campany rejects Roth's arguments for dating the Neiye to the 4th century BCE because they are based on his \\"speculative and wishful assumption\\" that political considerations were added only later to an \\"original Dao\\" (2005: 26). The problem of the dating of the Neiye is connected to some other texts within the Guanzi. Four chapters (piƒÅn ÁØá) have descriptions of meditation practices: Xinshu ÂøÉË°ì \\"Techniques of the Mind I and II\\" (chapters 36 and 37), Baixin ÁôΩÂøÉ \\"The Purified Mind\\" (38), and Neiye ÂÖßÊ•≠ \\"Inward Training\\" (49). The Guanzi is an heterogenous collection of writings by diverse Legalist, Confucianist, and Daoist authors; compilation probably began around 300 BCE and material may have been added until 26 BCE when Liu Xiang edited the received text (Roth 1999: 18). Model of ancient Linzi. Since these four texts are the only Guanzi chapters to mention the significance of breath meditation, researchers tend to consider them together (Roth 1999: 18). Furthermore, all four exhibit the irregular rhyme patterns thought to be characteristic of the Chu region variety of Chinese (Roth 1994: 11). Many scholars have debated over the relationship between Neiye, Xinshu I and II, and Baixin. Most concur that these texts were written by Huang-Lao Daoist philosophers at the Jixia Academy in the Qi capital of Linzi, but many disagree over the dating of the texts and identity of the redactors. After analyzing the structure and rhetorical characteristics of the Daode jing, Neiye, Xinshu I, and Baixin, The Chinese linguist William H. Baxter proposed that they constitute a specific literary genre, which emerged from \\"a distinctive tradition of philosophical verse with strong oral elements and little concept of individual authorship\\" (1998: 240‚Äì243, 249). In order to estimate the dates of compilation for these Guanzi writings about breath circulation techniques, Roth analyzed the linguistic features of the Neiye, Xinshu I and II, and Baixin; and concluded that the Neiye is a genuine 4th- century BCE text while the others are derived from it (1999: 23‚Äì25). The first three works have close conceptual and textual parallels, but the Baixin‚Äîwhich is a mostly prose essay on how a sage ruler can apply the meditation techniques to governing‚Äîis considered the latest work in the group. Three types of evidence support the antiquity of the Neiye. First, its distinctive literary structure as a composition of originally independent, rhythmic and rhymed verse is a sign of oral transmission before literacy became widespread in the latter half of the 4th century BCE. Second, the Neiye does not contain the kind of sustained argumentation typically found in 3rd-century BCE philosophical essays, and it shows only a loose principle of organization between its verses. Third, the absence of the correlative cosmology of yin and yang and the Five Phases, characteristic of 3rd-century BCE texts. Using redaction criticism ‚Äì analyzing the production a text from how the redactors (editors, compilers) combined and arranged the source materials ‚Äì Roth found that the Xinshu II is an original prose essay in which the redactor deliberately extracted and rearranged Neiye verses for the purpose of advocating the political benefits of inner cultivation methods (1994: 34). It thus complements Xinshu I and accounts for the Guanzi labeling them as parts of one essay (1999: 26). More specifically, Roth proposes that the Neiye's exclusively verse format and absence of political thought would support a date of mid-4th century at the latest. The first part of Xinshu I contains verses that are almost as old, but since they begin to advocate applying inner cultivation techniques to the task of governing and show evidence of interaction with rival intellectual positions, he dates them to about 300 BCE. The commentary contained in the second part of Xinshu I shows the influence of the Daodejing and so must be dated to a later time after this work became influential in intellectual circles about 250 BCE (1999: 26‚Äì27). A 45-character inscription on a Warring States era jade artifact may possibly be an earlier record of breath meditation than the Neiye (Harper 1999: 881). This rhymed passage entitled X√≠ngq√¨ Ë°åÊ∞£ \\"circulating the vital breath\\" was inscribed on a dodecagonal block of jade, with nine trisyllabic phrases describing the stages of breath cultivation. While the dating is uncertain, estimates range from earlier than 400 BCE (Joseph Needham), 380 BCE (Guo Moruo), to late 4th century BCE (Harper). In any case, scholars agree that this is the earliest Chinese epigraphical evidence on the practice of breath meditation (Roth 1999: 162). Basic concepts The ancient Neiye presents a \\"seamless web ‚Ä¶ connecting the psychological, physiological, and spiritual aspects of the human being\\" (Roth 1999: 106). It is the earliest known text that explains self-cultivation through daily, practiced regulation of a group of life forces. Namely, qi \\"vital energy\\" (the universal force that gives life to all things), jing \\"vital essence\\" (one's innate reservoir of qi), xin \\"heart- mind\\", shen \\"spirit; spiritual consciousness\\", dao \\"the Way\\", and de \\"inner power\\". These terms later became keywords in Chinese philosophy, but the Neiye sometimes used them idiosyncratically, for instance, dao was effectively interchangeable with shen and qi (Kirkland 2008: 771). Qi, which Roth translates as \\"vital energy\\" or \\"vital breath\\", integrates the physical with the psychological. Kirkland describes qi \\"life-energy\\" in the Neiye as \\"a powerful salubrious reality\\" that is present everywhere and within all things (1997: 5). According to the Neiye, human beings are made up of systems containing various manifestations of qi; the w«îz√†ng ‰∫îËáü Five Orbs/Viscera system includes not only the physical organs (lungs, kidneys, liver, gallbladder, and spleen), but also the psychological range of mental and emotional states‚Äîpresciently similar to the contemporary idea of neural correlates for consciousness (Roth 1999: 41‚Äì42). Jing \\"vital essence\\" is a central concept in the Neiye, with meanings that span from the universal life- giving essence contained in all creatures to the particular physiological substrate that allows sages to achieve profound tranquility. Within each person, qi energy is centered in the jing essence, which Roth describes as \\"the source of the vital energy in human beings [and] the basis of our health, vitality, and psychological well-being\\" (1999: 42). Verse 8 provides the following clear equation: \\"The vital essence [jing Á≤æ]: it is the essence [Á≤æ] of the vital energy [qi Ê∞£].\\" Thus, it is concentrated and subtle form of vital energy (Roth 1999: 101). The original meaning of jing (written Á≤æ with the \\"rice radical\\" Á±≥) \\"finest and purest rice\\" was a religious concept (Harper 1998: 119). Pure and refined things were considered as the \\"stuff of spirits; quintessence; essence\\", referring either to sacrificial offerings suitable for the gods/spirits or the potency of the spirits themselves. In later usage jing came to mean \\"germinal essence; energy that nourishes the human body; vitality\\". Harper translates this term both as \\"essence\\" and \\"specter, spectral\\" in the Neiye (1998: 155). The two most important philosophical concepts in the \\"Neiye\\" are the closely related notions of the vital essence and the Way. The power of the Way to generate all things is manifested as the vital essence, which is the procreative principle within all phenomena (Roth 1999: 101). The first lines of the text compare heavenly and earthly jing. > The vital essence of all things: It is this that brings them to life. It > generates the five grains below And becomes the constellated stars above. > When flowing amid the heavens and earth, We call it ghostly and numinous. > When stored within the chests of human beings, We call them sages. (Verse 1, > tr. Roth 1999: 46) By storing jing within the heart/mind, one can become sagely. The sage's cultivation does not occur only at the spiritual level but rather sets into motion physiological changes, causing the human body to become thoroughly transformed and renewed (Yang 2003: 102). Xin \\"heart; mind\\" is regularly translated by Roth as \\"mind\\" with a concrete connotation of not just the physical \\"heart\\" but also the entire sphere of vital energy that flows through it (1999: 42). The xin is described as the ruling agency in an individual's \\"biospiritual nexus, i.e., in the entire personal complex of body/mind/heart/spirit\\" (Kirkland 1997: 6). The xin can become agitated by excessive thought or emotion, which leads to dissipation of one's jing Á≤æ \\"vital essence\\", and can result in sickness and death. To preserve health and vitality, the Neiye says that jing Èùú \\"stabilizing; calming\\" the xin will draw in the external realities of shen and dao (Kirkland 2008: 771). Shen is usually translated as English \\"spirit; spiritual\\", but in order to avoid the connotative ambiguities of spirit, Roth uses \\"numen; numinous\\" in reference to a layer of mystical awareness that lies within the human body (1999: 43). Shen comprises perception, cognition, and higher forms of awareness. The original meaning of shen \\"god; spirit; deity\\" was also a religious concept. External spirits were believed to occasionally descend to human beings (particularly shamans), or humans could draw them down with the power of de \\"inner power; virtue\\" (Harper 1998: 119). Verse 13 describes the aspects of shen \\"numen; numinous\\": > There is a numinous [mind] naturally residing within [ÊúâÁ•ûËá™Âú®Ë∫´]; One moment it > goes, the next it comes, And no one is able to conceive of it. If you lose > it you are inevitably disordered; If you attain it you are inevitably well > ordered. Diligently clean out its lodging place [Êï¨Èô§ÂÖ∂Ëàç] And its vital essence > will naturally arrive [Á≤æÂ∞áËá™‰æÜ]. Still your attempts to imagine and conceive of > it. Relax your efforts to reflect on and control it. Be reverent and > diligent And its vital essence will naturally stabilize. Grasp it and don't > let go Then the eyes and ears won't overflow And the mind will have nothing > else to seek. When a properly aligned mind resides within you [Ê≠£ÂøÉÂú®‰∏≠], The > myriad things will be seen in their proper perspective. (tr. Roth 1999: 70) Verse 14 describes this shen \\"numinous [mind]\\" as a nondual awareness of the Way: \\"Within the mind there is yet another mind. / That mind within the mind: it is an awareness that precedes words.\\" (tr. Roth 1999: 72). This statement means the mind can be divided into two levels: empirical and transcendent. The former awaits transformation by the latter (Yang 2003: 104). The Neiye's privately practiced meditation, in which the shen settles into the practitioner's body, directly descends from the trance of the professional wu \\"shaman; spirit medium\\" (Graham 1989: 101). Dao \\"the Way\\" is a well-known Chinese loanword in English meaning \\"an absolute entity which is the source of the universe\\" (OED), but the ancient Neiye sometimes used it as an equivalent of the qi, jing, and shen that a practitioner works to cultivate (Kirkland 1997: 7‚Äì9). The Neiye describes the Way as a force that can enter or leave a person, and by engaging in specific self-cultivation practices one can make it come into direct experience or can keep it from going away (Roth 1999: 43). > Clear! as though right by your side. Vague! as though it will not be > attained. Indiscernible! as though beyond the limitless. The test of this is > not far off: Daily we make use of its inner power [de Âæ∑]. The Way is what > infuses the body, Yet people are unable to fix it in place. It goes forth > but does not return, It comes back but does not stay. Silent! none can hear > its sound. Suddenly stopping! it abides within the mind. Obscure! we do not > see its form. Surging forth! it arises with us. We do not see its form, We > do not hear its sound, Yet we can perceive an order to its accomplishments. > We call it \\"the Way.\\" (4, tr. Roth 1999: 52) Thus, the term dao refers to a transient reality that a person needs to attract and to retain (Kirkland 1997: 13). The Neiye warns that forceful efforts cannot make the dao arrive or stay, only one's de \\"inner power\\" (see below) can attract it and other life forces (Kirkland 2008: 772). Neiye verse 4 above depicts the Way as the ineffable cosmic power familiar from other early Daoist texts like the Daodejing, yet it has a much more tangible presence in the Neiye (Roth 1999: 102). Verse 5 says the Way is a constantly moving power that seems to come and go within the human mind. > The Way has no fixed position; It abides within the excellent mind [ÂñÑÂøÉ]. > When the mind is tranquil and the vital breath is regular [ÂøÉÈùúÊ∞£ÁêÜ], The Way > can thereby be halted. That Way is not distant from us; When people attain > it they are sustained That Way is not separated from us; When people accord > with it they are harmonious. Therefore: Concentrated! as though you could be > roped together with it. Indiscernible! as though beyond all locations. The > true state of that Way: How could it be conceived of and pronounced upon? > Cultivate your mind, make your thoughts tranquil [‰øÆÂøÉÈùúÊÑè], And the Way can > thereby be attained. (tr. Roth 1999: 54) Although constantly moving in and out of one's mind, the Way can stay within it when one cultivates tranquility through the regular and systematic practice of breathing meditation. While the Way is always present, one is aware of this presence within the mind only when it is properly cultivated (Roth 1999: 103). De \\"inner power\\" is a basic concept in traditional Daoism meaning \\"inherent character; inner moral power; virtue; integrity\\", but the Neiye used de to mean the \\"acquisitional agency\\" through which one can receive qi, jing, shen, and dao (Kirkland 1997: 6). Thus, de \\"inner power\\" (which is cognate with de Âæó \\"get; acquire\\"), is something that we \\"acquire\\" when all elements of the body/heart/mind are peaceful and aligned. Unlike other Daoist classics such as the Daodejing and Zhuangzi that describe de as intrinsic to everyone, the Neiye says one should practice daily self-control of thoughts and actions in order to build up one's de (Kirkland 1997: 7). Inner power is a distinct quality of mental concentration that arises naturally, along with tranquility, through the practice of proper posture and breathing meditation (Roth 1999: 105). > When your body is not aligned [ÂΩ¢‰∏çÊ≠£], The inner power will not come. When you > are not tranquil within [‰∏≠‰∏çÈùú], Your mind will not be well ordered. Align > your body, assist the inner power [Ê≠£ÂΩ¢ÊîùÂæ∑], Then it will gradually come on its > own. (Verse 11, tr. Roth 1999: 66) This inner power can be thought of as a psychological condition of \\"focused and balanced awareness from which the adept is able to respond spontaneously and harmoniously to whatever arises\\" (Roth 1999: 126). \\"Neiye\\" physiological concepts developed in the intellectual background of the 4th century BCE, a period when Chinese philosophers, notably the ethical egoist Yang Zhu, first considered the question of maintaining one's own physical wellbeing (Harper 1998: 120). The chief innovation made in the \\"Neiye\\" is equating jing vital essence and qi vital breath/energy, which unites vital energy and essence with shen spirit/numen‚Äîthus naturalizing the old religious connotations of jing and shen into new physical meanings. This inventive physiological theory merged a person's physical and spiritual components, and made vital breath/energy the source of each. The \\"Neiye\\" opens with the statement that jing \\"vital essence\\" is the source of life. Then the text identifies the mind as the \\"lodging place for the vital essence\\", defines vital essence as the \\"essence of vital breath/energy\\", and links jing with the indwelling shen \\"spirit\\". De \\"inner power; virtue\\" serves as the mechanism by which the triad of vital energy, vital essence, and spirit are drawn to the body where they must be stored and concentrated in order to create a wellspring of vitality (Harper 1998: 119). The \\"Neiye\\" introduced the physiological theory that one could transform oneself into a sage through heartmind training that cultivates qi vital breath/energy, jing vital essence, and shen spirit/numen in the body (Harper 1998: 78, 112). From a modern perspective, these 2500-year-old Neiye concepts seem enigmatic; qi \\"vital breath\\" constitutes both matter and energy, while xin \\"body/heart/mind\\" or bodymind circumvents Cartesian dualism. Owing to a semantic gap in the English lexicon, there is no standard word denoting the ancient Chinese Neiye worldview that spiritual life involves activities that also have physical components. Suggested protologisms include \\"biospiritual\\" (Kirkland 1997), \\"physio-spiritual\\" (Harper 1998),\\"psychophysiological\\" (Roth 1991), and \\"psychospiritual\\" (Roth 1999). According to the Neiye, there is a set of elusive life forces that enter and leave the human body, but will only remain within a person who has transformed him/herself into an efficient receptacle. For instance, \\"Cultivate your mind, make your thoughts tranquil, / And the Way can thereby be attained.\\" (Verse 5), and \\"Diligently clean out [spirit's] lodging place / And its vital essence will naturally arrive.\\" (13). Kirkland says a good analogy for these forces might be radio waves that continually flow through us but can only be utilized by a device that is properly tuned. Figuratively, we are all radios that were originally fully operational, but now are experiencing electromagnetic interference caused by excessive heart/mind activity, and we need to retune ourselves to eliminate the disturbance and begin functioning properly again (1997: 14). Practices  Qing dynasty illustration of modern Daoyin technique for zhengqi Ê≠£Ê∞£ \\"aligning the vital energy\\" The Neiye acclaims a variety of practices and techniques for acquiring, or metaphorically \\"tuning in\\" to, the subtle forces of the Way. Basic daily practices include proper alignment of one's body/heart/mind, breath meditation, and moderation in thinking and eating. Practicing zh√®ng Ê≠£ '\\"alignment\\" of bodymind in order to attain j√¨ng Èùú \\"tranquility\\" (cf. later jingzuo \\"tranquil sitting\\" meditation) is one of the most important aims in the Neiye, where the word zheng \\"to rectify; to square up; to center; to align\\" appears in 9 of the 26 verses and jing \\"still; quiet; calm; tranquil\\" in 11. \\"Fourfold Aligning\\" is the basic method of Neiye practice: zhengxing Ê≠£ÂΩ¢ \\"aligning the body\\", zhengsiti[zhi] Ê≠£ÂõõÈ´î[ËÇ¢] \\"aligning the four limbs\\", zhengqi Ê≠£Ê∞£ \\"aligning the vital energy\\", and zhengxin Ê≠£ÂøÉ \\"aligning the mind\\" (Roth 1999: 109). Since the human body is believed to be imbued with qi vital energy, the term zhengxing refers to aligning or harmonizing the flow of vital energy within the physical form (xing ÂΩ¢ literally means \\"form; shape\\"), while zhengxin refers to aligning the flow of vital energy within the mind (Roth 1991: 612). \\"Aligning the body\\" and \\"aligning the four limbs\\" are closely related. The former appears in Verse 11 (above): \\"When your body is not aligned [ÂΩ¢‰∏çÊ≠£], / The inner power will not come. / When you are not tranquil within [‰∏≠‰∏çÈùú], / Your mind will not be well ordered. / \\"Align your body, assist the inner power [Ê≠£ÂΩ¢ÊîùÂæ∑], / Then it will gradually come on its own.\\" The latter alignment of arms and legs creates a figurative she Ëàç \\"guest-house; lodging\\" for jing \\"vital essence\\" in Verse 8. > If you can be aligned and be tranquil [ËÉΩÊ≠£ËÉΩÈùú], Only then can you be stable. > With a stable mind at your core [ÂÆöÂøÉÂú®‰∏≠], With the eyes and ears acute and > clear, And with the four limbs firm and fixed [ÂõõÊûùÂ†ÖÂõ∫], You can thereby make a > lodging place for the vital essence [ÂèØ‰ª•ÁÇ∫Á≤æËàç]. The vital essence: it is the > essence of the vital energy. When the vital energy is guided, it [the vital > essence] is generated, But when it is generated, there is thought, When > there is thought, there is knowledge, But when there is knowledge, then you > must stop. Whenever the forms of the mind have excessive knowledge, You lose > your vitality. (tr. Roth 1999: 60) In both these verses, being aligned precedes being tranquil, and thus developing a stabilized mind. Neiye \\"alignment\\" apparently refers to sitting in a steady posture with the limbs aligned or squared up with one another, comparable to the vajrasana posture in Buddhist meditation (Roth 1999: 110). This Neiye metaphor of \\"make a lodging place for the vital essence\\" refers to the primary mystical praxis, which Verse 13 (above) symbolically describes, \\"Diligently clean out its [the bodily shen's] lodging place [Êï¨Èô§ÂÖ∂Ëàç] / And its vital essence will naturally arrive [Á≤æÂ∞áËá™‰æÜ]\\". The method of \\"cleaning out [ch√∫ Èô§ \\"eliminate; remove; clean out\\"] the lodging place of the numinous\\" is essentially an apophatic process in which one \\"gradually and systematically removes the normal feelings, desires, thoughts, and perceptions that commonly occupy consciousness\\" (Roth 1999: 134). Xinshu I repeats this Neiye metaphor: \\"The Tao is not far off, but it is hard to reach its limit. It rests together with man, but it is hard to grasp. Empty out your desires, and the numen will enter its abode. If the abode is not thoroughly swept clean, the numen will not remain there.\\" (tr. Roth 1991: 623). It also adds recommendations to \\"open its doors\\" (the senses), \\"relinquish selfishness\\", and \\"stop talking\\" in order to give the practitioner shenming Á•ûÊòé \\"numinous clarity\\" (Roth 1991: 625). Systematic breath meditation practices in the Neiye usually involve sitting in a stable position, circulating and refining the qi \\"vital breath\\", in order to produce concentrated jing \\"vital essence\\", which is thought of as the material counterpart of psychological tranquility. Since vital essence is expended in everyday activities such perceiving, thinking, and feeling, one should minimize them. Aligning the body and emptying the mind will maximize physical vitality and psychological well-being (Roth 1999: 126). Neiye Verse 24 describes breath meditation practice in which the adept shouyi ÂÆà‰∏Ä \\"maintains the One\\" and yunqi ÈÅãÊ∞£ \\"revolves the qi\\", which brings about a profound tranquility. > When you enlarge your mind and let go of it, When you relax your vital > breath and expand it, When your body is calm and unmoving: And you can > maintain the One and discard the myriad disturbances. You will see profit > and not be enticed by it, You will see harm and not be frightened by it. > Relaxed and unwound, yet acutely sensitive, In solitude you delight in your > own person. This is called \\"revolving the vital breath\\": Your thoughts and > deeds seem heavenly. (24, tr. Roth 1999: 92) Roth says this ancient reference to shouyi, which later became a central tenet of Daoist and Chinese Buddhist meditation (Kohn 1989), describes a contemplative technique in which one sits calmly and exclusively concentrates on the Way, which enables one to set aside all the \\"disturbances of perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and desires that normally fill your conscious mind\\" (1999: 116). Verse 17 provides specific details about regularized breath meditation. Breathing is said to \\"coil and uncoil\\" (zh≈çu Âë® \\"encircle; surround\\" and kuƒÅn ÂØ¨ \\"let go; release; stretch out; extend\\") or \\"contract and expand\\" (m√¨ ÂØÜ \\"snug; condense; squeezed together\\" and sh≈´ Ëàí \\"stretch; spread out; expand; unfold\\"), with coiling/contracting referring to exhalation and uncoiling/expanding to inhalation (Roth 1991: 619). > For all [to practice] this Way: You must coil, you must contract, You must > uncoil, you must expand, You must be firm, you must be regular [in this > practice]. Hold fast to this excellent [practice]; do not let go of it. > Chase away the excessive; abandon the trivial. And when you reach its > ultimate limit You will return to the Way and its inner power. (18, tr. Roth > 1999: 78) In addition to discussing mystical transformation through vital breath circulation, the Neiye recommends moderation in thought and diet so that the vital energy can flow freely and harmony can be achieved (Roth 1991: 619). For instance, > Deep thinking generates knowledge. Idleness and carelessness generate worry. > Cruelty and arrogance generate resentment. Worry and grief generate illness. > When illness reaches a distressing degree, you die. When you think about > something and don't let go of it, Internally you will be distressed, > externally you will be weak. Do not plan things out in advance Or else your > vitality will cede its dwelling. In eating, it is best not to fill up; In > thinking, it is best not to overdo. Limit these to the appropriate degree > And you will naturally reach it [vitality]. (20, tr. Roth 1999: 84) The Neiye also discusses common health concerns such as the \\"way of eating\\". > For all the Way of eating [È£ü‰πãÈÅì] is that: Overfilling yourself with food will > impair your vital energy And cause your body to deteriorate. Overrestricting > your consumption causes the bones to wither And the blood to congeal. The > mean between overfilling and overrestricting: This is called \\"harmonious > completion.\\" It is where the vital essence lodges And knowledge is > generated. ‚Ä¶ (23, tr. Roth 1999: 90) These holistic descriptions of harmonizing body, mind, and spirit are early references to the practice later called y«éngshƒìng È§äÁîü \\"nourishing one's vital principle\\" (Roth 1999: 122). Influences The c. 4th-century Neiye had long- reaching effects on Daoism and Chinese culture. It influenced classic texts such as the Daodejing and Zhuangzi, as well as what later became Daoist meditation, Neidan \\"internal alchemy\\", Daoyin, and Daoist diet practices. It also influenced theories about the Three Treasures (jƒ´ng-q√¨-sh√©n Á≤æÊ∞£Á•û \\"essence, vital energy, and spirit\\") in traditional Chinese medicine, and may have impacted the Confucian teachings of Mencius (c. 372-c. 289 BCE) about cultivating the xin \\"heartmind\\" (Kirkland 2008: 771). Daoism The Neiye had a unique position in the history of Chinese philosophy. Compared with other Hundred Schools of Thought texts from the Warring States period (475‚Äì221 BCE), the Neiye does not mention many basic philosophical theories such as yin and yang (Rickett 1985‚Äì98: 155). The text is unconcerned with political philosophy; unlike the Daodejing, which contains many passages discussing the problems involved with ruling a state (Kirkland 1997: 10). Nor does the Neiye criticize Confucianism, as the Daodejing and Zhuangzi frequently do. The Neiye contains no evidence that its authors or compilers were aware of the teachings from other current philosophical traditions, neither Confucianism, Mohism, Legalism, nor the School of Yin Yang (Kirkland 2008: 772). Another distinctive feature of the Neiye is that it lacks the early Chinese idea of Tian \\"Heaven\\" as a beneficent agency overseeing and guiding life. Both the Confucians and the Mohists shared ideas about Tian Heaven as the divine ruler and the Tianzi Son of Heaven as the earthly ruler (Kirkland 1997: 17). The character tian Â§© appears in a number of Neiye passages, in which Roth translates it in the naturalistic sense as \\"the heavens\\" (for instance, \\"Bright!‚Äîas if ascending the heavens\\", Verse 2 above) rather than the usual deified \\"heaven; Heaven\\" (1999: 43). To illustrate the c. 4th-century BCE Neiye's effects on early Daoism, examples are given below from the c. 3rd-century BCE Daodejing and the c. 3rd/2nd-century BCE Zhuangzi. The Neiye and Daodejing have parallels as well as differences. Both texts contain teachings that originated in an oral tradition. The Neiye, like much of the Daodejing, is primarily composed in rhymed verse, and some scholars believe that certain sections may have been borrowed from an early Daoist hymn (Rickett 1985‚Äì98: 154). Harper suggests both texts were \\"canons of physical cultivation theory\\" meant for recitation by initiates who could have received fuller knowledge of its meaning either orally or in supplementary texts (1987: 561). Both texts also share a conception of Dao \\"the Way\\" as the ultimate power through which everything generates and develops (Roth 1999: 145). Compare how they describe the Way and the wanwu Ëê¨Áâ© \\"myriad things\\": \\"The myriad things are generated by it\\" and \\"The myriad things are completed by it\\" (Neiye verse 6) and \\"The Way gives birth to them, nourishes them, matures them, completes them, rests them, rears them, supports them, and protects them\\" (Daodejing chapter 51). Both texts also similarly describe the concept of de \\"inner power\\". In the Neiye (verses 4 and 2), de is the aspect of the Way that we \\"daily make use of\\" and which we develop through refining the qi vital breath into the jing vital essence through breath meditation. The Daodejing (chapter 55) also links de and jing comparing one \\"who is filled with an abundance of inner power\\" with the newborn babe in whom the vital essence is maximized. The Neijing's emphasis on the importance of attaining jing tranquility through breath meditation is also found in the Daodejing, where the term occurs in 7 of the 81 chapters, for instance, to \\"maintain tranquility is the central (practice)\\" (16, tr. Roth 1999: 147). The most explicit Daodejing reference to practicing breath meditation contains three phrases with close parallels to the Neiye. > Amid the daily activity of the psyche, can you embrace the One and not > depart from it? When concentrating your vital breath until it is at its > softest, can you be like a child? Can you sweep clean your Profound Mirror > so you are able to have no flaws in it? In loving the people and governing > the state, can you do it without using knowledge? When the Gates of Heaven > open and close, can you become feminine? In clarifying all within the Four > Directions, can you do it without using knowledge? (chapter 10, tr. Roth > 1999: 150; cf. Mair 1994: 69) First, this Daodejing term baoyi Êä±‰∏Ä \\"embracing the One\\" parallels the Neiye zhiyi Âü∑‰∏Ä \\"hold fast to the One\\" (verse 9, tr. Roth 1999: 62), and both terms refer to retaining a sense of union with the Way in everyday life. Second, zhuanqi Â∞àÊ∞£ \\"concentrating the vital breath (until it is at its softest)\\" closely resembles tuanqi Êë∂Ê∞£ \\"concentrating your vital breath (as if numinous)\\" denoting to the practice of breath meditation (19, tr. Roth 1999: 82). Third, dichu xuanjian ÊªåÈô§ÁéÑË¶Ω \\" sweep clean your Profound Mirror\\" and the distinctive Neiye metaphor jingchu qi she Êï¨Èô§ÂÖ∂Ëàç \\"diligently clean out its lodging place\\" (13, tr. Roth 1999: 70) share the same syntax and verb chu \\"eliminate; remove\\". These three textual counterparts demonstrate that the redactors of both the Neiye and Daodejing shared knowledge of traditional proto-Daoist meditation techniques through which one could directly experience the Way and its inner power (Roth 1999: 152). Notwithstanding these similarities and parallels, there are significant differences between the two texts. As already mentioned, the Neiye contains virtually no political philosophy, which is a major focus in the Daodejing. There is no trace in the Neiye of many now- famous themes of the Daodejing, such as wu \\"non-being\\", ziran \\"naturally; spontaneously\\", wuwei \\"non-interference\\", pu \\"uncarved; unhewn\\", xian \\"transcendent; immortal\\", and xu Ëôõ \\"emptiness\\" (Kirkland 2008: 772‚Äì773). Unlike the Daodejing gender-based concepts of the Dao as mother, the Mysterious Female, and \\"feminine\\" behaviors such as humility or yielding, the Neiye has nothing to say about gender, which hints that women as well as men may have engaged in mediation practices (Kirkland 1997: 16). In addition, the authors/compilers of the Zhuangzi were clearly familiar with Neiye inner cultivation practices. The Zhuangzi text contains both weak and strong evidence of meditation techniques shared with the Neiye. Some passages contain similar terminology and others use sentences that are almost identical with those in the Neiye (Roth 1999: 153). Here are two examples. In the first passage, the character Wearcoat (Ë¢´Ë°£) instructs Gnaw Gap (ÈΩßÁº∫) about the Way. > You must align your body [Ê≠£Ê±ùÂΩ¢], Unify your vision, And the heavenly harmony > will arrive. Gather in your knowledge, Unify your attention, And the > numinous will enter its lodging place [Á•ûÂ∞á‰æÜËàç], The inner power will beautify > you, And the Way will reside in you. You will see things with the eyes of a > newborn calf And will not seek out their precedents. (22, tr. Roth 1999: > 158; cf. Mair 1994: 213‚Äì214) Zhengxing Ê≠£ÂΩ¢ \\"aligning the body\\" is a basic Neiye practice, and jing chu qi she Êï¨Èô§ÂÖ∂Ëàç \\"cleaning out the lodging place of the numinous\\" resembles this shen jianglai she Á•ûÂ∞á‰æÜËàç \\"the numinous will enter its lodging place\\". In the second Zhuangzi passage, Laozi instructs Nanrong Zhu (ÂçóÊ¶ÆË∂é) about meditation practices by paraphrasing, if not quoting, the Neiye. > The practice for guarding vitality [Ë°õÁîü‰πãÁ∂ì]: Can you embrace the One [ËÉΩÊä±‰∏Ä‰πé]? > Can you not lose it [ËÉΩÂãøÂ§±‰πé]? Can you not resort to divining by tortoise or > milfoil [ËÉΩÁÑ°ÂçúÁ≠Æ]? Yet know good and bad fortune [ËÄåÁü•ÂêâÂá∂‰πé]? Can you be still? Can > you cease [ËÉΩÊ≠¢‰πéËÉΩÂ∑≤‰πé]? Can you quit (seeking for) it in others [ËÉΩËàçË´∏‰∫∫] And seek > for within yourself [ËÄåÊ±ÇË´∏Â∑±‰πé]? Can you be casual? Can you be naive? Can you be > like a child? The child howls all day but its throat does not become hoarse. > (tr. Roth 1999: 159) These Zhuangzi instructions are an almost verbatim repetition of Neiye Verse 19. > By concentrating your vital breath as if numinous, The myriad things will > all be contained within you. Can you concentrate? Can you unite with them > [ËÉΩ‰∏Ä‰πé]? Can you not resort to divining by tortoise or milfoil [ËÉΩÁÑ°ÂçúÁ≠Æ]? Yet > know bad and good fortune [ËÄåÁü•ÂêâÂá∂‰πé]? Can you stop? Can you cease [ËÉΩÊ≠¢‰πéËÉΩÂ∑≤‰πé]? Can > you not seek it in others [ËÉΩÂãøÊ±ÇË´∏‰∫∫]?, Yet attain it within yourself [ËÄåÂæó‰πãÂ∑±‰πé]? ‚Ä¶ > (tr. Roth 1999: 82) Based upon the remarkable correspondences between these contexts, the authors of this Zhuangzi chapter were unquestionably familiar with the Neiye or a similar text (Roth 1999: 160). The contents of the Neiye are distinct from either the Daodejing or the Zhuangzi, despite the striking similarities among the texts. Since the Neiye was written earlier than the Daodejing, Kirkland proposes that it could be interpreted as an example of the earliest known Daoist teachings. Since the compilers of the Daodejing were clearly interested in the same social and political issues that concerned members of other philosophical schools, one could reasonably characterize the teachings of the Neiye as \\"original Daoism,\\" and the teachings of the Daodejing as \\"applied Daoism.\\" Although both texts apparently developed from the same general tradition, the Neiye compilers were primarily interested in self-cultivation practices, the Daodejing compilers were also interested in the broader issues of living in human society (Roth 1997: 18‚Äì19). Mencius There is evidence that the Neiye also influenced the teachings of Mencius (c. 370-c. 290 BCE) on cultivating the xin heartmind and building up qi, which later developed into Neo-Confucian ideals of self-cultivation (Kirkland 2008: 771). In the Mencius, Mencius tells his disciple Gongsun Chou ÂÖ¨Â≠´‰∏ë, \\"At forty, I attained to an unperturbed mind [budong xin ‰∏çÂãïÂøÉ]\\" adding that attaining it is not difficult and another disciple Gaozi achieved it at a younger age. Mencius also says, \\"I am good at nourishing my flood-like ch'i [haoran zhi qi Êµ©ÁÑ∂‰πãÊ∞£]\\". When asked what that means, he explains, > A hard thing to speak of. It is the sort of ch'i which is utmost in > vastness, utmost in firmness. If by uprightness you nourish it and do not > interfere with it, it stuffs the space between heaven and earth. It is the > sort of ch'i which matches the right with the Way; without these it starves. > It is generated by accumulation of rightdoing, it is not that by sporadic > rightdoing one makes a grab at it. If anything in conduct is dissatisfying > to the heart it starves. That is why I say that [Gaozi] has never understood > the right, because he thinks it external. There must be work for it, but do > not adjust its course; do not let your heart forget it, but do not help it > to grow. (2A.2, tr. Graham 1989: 127, cf. Legge 1875: 165) Mencius's description of a sage's qi vital energy as haoran Êµ©ÁÑ∂ \\"flood-like\\" was likely taken from this Neiye passage: > For those who preserve and naturally generate vital essence On the outside a > calmness will flourish. Stored inside, we take it to be the well spring. > Floodlike, it harmonizes and equalizes [Êµ©ÁÑ∂ÂíåÂπ≥] And we take it to be the fount > of the vital energy. (15, tr. Roth 1999: 74) Graham dates the Neiye from the 4th century BCE, and says its practices may predate the hypothetical split between Confucianism and Daoism (1989: 100). Another Neiye-Mencius textual parallel exists between \\"By concentrating your vital breath as if numinous, / The myriad things will all be contained within you [Êë∂Ê∞£Â¶ÇÁ•ûËê¨Áâ©ÂÇôÂ≠ò].\\" (19, tr. Roth 1999: 82, see Zhuangzi above) and \\"Mencius said, 'The myriad things are all here at my disposal in myself [Ëê¨Áâ©ÁöÜÂÇôÊñºÊàëÁü£]. There is no greater joy than to look back into oneself and find integrity'.\\" (7A/4, tr. Graham 1989: 127, cf. Legge 1875: 345) Both the Neiye and Mencius assume that one is born with an inherently perfect heartmind, and when one becomes confused that perfection is lost, but one can return to the original state of heart/mind by allowing an inherent harmony to replace the confusion. Kirkland reasons that since these ideas seem more integral to the teachings of the Neiye, it is logical to conclude that the ideas, if not the text itself, may have been known to Mencius or at least to his text's compilers (1997: 3, 11). Excavated texts Daoyin tu Drawings of Guiding and Pulling in the Mawangdui Silk Texts The c. 4th century BCE Neiye is connected with a corpus of 2nd century BCE medical and physical cultivation texts that archaeologists discovered in Western Han dynasty tombs. The c. 168 BCE Mawangdui Silk Texts, excavated in 1973 near Changsha, Hunan, include several previously-unknown medical texts, such as the Wushi'er Bingfang \\"Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments\\" and Shiwen ÂçÅÂïè \\"Ten Questions\\". The c. 186 BCE Zhangjiashan Han bamboo texts, excavated in 1983 near Linyi, Hubei, include additional writings on medicine and health. One of the most widely known Mawangdui silk texts is the Daoyin tu Â∞éÂºïÂúñ \\"Drawings of Guiding and Pulling\\" that illustrates 44 sitting and standing daoyin exercises. The psychophysiological cultivation practices in the Neiye and the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan texts have numerous parallels. They share technical vocabulary for breath cultivation, particularly the three basic elements of human physiology: qi vital energy, jing vital essence, and shen spirit. The texts also similarly describe circulating the vital energy in a stable, sitting posture with the spine erect (Roth 1999: 110, 168). Furthermore, the Neiye and the Mawangdui Four Texts manuscript share a rhyme scheme associated with the state of Chu, and contain identical passages, thus indicating \\"an affinity that is too close to be a matter of chance\\" (Rickett 1993: 248‚Äì249). However, the Neiye and the excavated texts give different purposes for practicing inner cultivation. The Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan manuscripts are primarily concerned with goals of better health and longer life; although the Neiye occasionally mentions the physical benefits of breath cultivation, its goals are more psychological and spiritual (Roth 1999: 169). For example, the Mawangdui text that most closely resembles the Neiye is the Shiwen Ten Questions. While both mention tuanqi Êë∂Ê∞£ \\"concentrating your vital breath\\", it is done in order to attain the Way in the Neiye but to achieve longevity in the Shiwen (19, tr. Roth 1999: 82). Both texts describe jing as being like a quanyuan Ê≥âÂéü \\"wellspring\\", but in the Neiye vital essence is generated in order to attain tranquility (15, Roth 1999: 74), while in the Shiwen it is generated by \\"sucking in vital energy\\" and circulating it into the extremities (Roth 1999: 169). Unlike the \\"Neiye\\" that discourses on philosophical and mystical concepts of human physiology, the Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan texts focus on teaching practical techniques for bodily care and long life. Based on the \\"Neiye\\" text, Harper thinks that Warring States cultivation theory and practice was an esoteric tradition with few actual practitioners. The Mawangdui and Zhangjiashan texts suggest that physical cultivation was popular in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE (1998: 126). While the excavated texts do not mention how many people practiced the techniques and recipes, the literature was clearly available and represented a kind of \\"baseline macrobiotic hygiene for the elite\\" (Harper 1998: 114).

It was owned by Thidricus Sk√¶ll√¶ in 1387. 1413‚Äì1632:Dyre and Dresselberg families Vindingegaard was owned by the Dyre family in the 15th century. The first member of the family who is known to have owned the estate is Jens (possibly Niels) Jensen Sosadel, who died in 1417. It remained in the family until his great grandson Erik Christoffersen's death in 1554. His widow, Sidsel Mouridsdatter Skave, then owned the estate until her death in 1592. Vindingegaard was then passed on to their distant relative Niels Andersen Dresselberg. His son Peder Nielsen Dresselberg inherited the estate in 1594 but died the following year, and it was then taken over by his brother Vilhelm Dresselberg. His widow stayed on the estate after his death in 1620. Their son-in-law, Frederik Parsberg, was the last member of the family to own the estate. 1632‚Äì1663: Changing owners Christian IV bought Vindingegaard in 1632 for his illegitimate son Hans Ulrik Gyldenl√∏ve, but he never lived there and died just 30 years old in 1756. The estate was then acquired by Grunde Rosenkrantz, a son of the scholar Holger Rosenkrantz. In 1660, he ceded the estate to his brother J√∏rgen Rosenkrantz. 1663‚Äì1700: Fuiren family In 1663 he sold it to Margrethe Frische, the widow of J√∏rgen Fuiren. The Fuiren family was a non-noble family of merchants and civil servants that had come to Denmark from Mecklenburg in about 1560. Vindingegaard is thus one of the earliest examples of an estate that passed from noble to non-noble ownership after the introduction of absolutism in 1660. Ved Margrethe Frische's son Thomas Fuiren inherited the estate in 1665. He passed it on to his nephew Diderik Fuiren, who already owned several other estates. He acquired more land and created the Barony of Fuirendal in 1677. Vindingegaard was the seat of the new barony and was renamed Fuirendal. Diderik Fuiren's son of the same name died young without male heirs in 1700, and the barony was therefore passed on to the crown. 1700‚Äìpresent: Holstein-Holsteinborg family Fuirendal by Ferdinand Richardt, 1855 The crown granted Fuirendal to Ulrik Adolf Holstein. He expanded the estate through the acquisition of more land, founding the Countship of Holsteinborg in 1708. The house was over the next years let out to a widow. It was from 1811 used as a hospital under the name Fuirendalske Hospital, and from 1833 the Fuirendalske Institute. The Countship of Holsteinborg was dissolved as a result of the adoption of lensafl√∏sningsloven in 1919. Much of the land that had previously belonged to Fuirendal also had to be sold. The remains of the estate continued as a farm under Holsteinborgs.

History No More Pain formed in 2008 when guitarist/singer Mike Roman and drummer/singer Ryan Sullivan disbanded their previous metalcore band Ministry of Pain and began working on more radio friendly material. Influences of progressive rock crept in, and soon they recruited bassist Jay Weinstein. In 2009 they recorded a self-titled demo, and shortly after added keyboardist Matt McDermott. Wanting to place Sullivan as the front man, drummer Dan Rainone joined in early 2010, and shortly after Mike Santini was added as a second guitarist. The six-member lineup soon went into the studio to record 2011's Debate and Rhyme. While in the studio, Sullivan and Santini left the band, and Roman took over lead vocal duties and Dan's brother Mike Rainone joined as second guitarist/vocalist. but left in early 2012. Weinstein left the band in early 2013 and was replaced by John Moroney. The now four-member lineup went into the studio in early 2014 to record 2015's The Post Human Condition. The album brought them enough attention to get the on the lineup of Rites of Spring festival in 2016. The album was also released in Japan after signing with the record label Marquee Inc. In 2016 they released The Spader EP, which was in dedication to one Indiegogo supporter for The Post Human Condition. In 2017 they released the Live EP, which features a 2014 show and a new studio track.

The genus contains a single described species, Alicodoxa rasnitsyni and is known from several Late Eocene fossils which were found in Europe. History and classification Alicodoxa is known from several fossil specimens of third and fourth instar nymphs. The holotype nymph was first identified from an inclusion in a transparent chunk of Rovno amber found in Ukraine, and two other nymphs have been found in Baltic amber, the genus being one of a number of arthropods shared between the two amber deposits. The Rovno amber inclusion was recovered from amber mining operations in the Klesov area working Late Eocene sediments of the Mezhigorje Formation and underlying Obukhov Formation which cover granite basement rock of the area. Baltic amber has very similar chemical and physical properties to Rovno amber, both ambers possibly being produced by the same forest. The ages of the two ambers differ, with the most common age for Baltic amber being Lutetian, slightly older than the Rovno amber, though both are redistributed into younger sediments and so the absolute age is uncertain. Both the Baltic amber nymphs were originally figured in earlier publications as other taxa. One was first pictured in 1998 labeled as a third instar nymph. The other specimen was first illustrated in 1856 as a third instar nymph of \\"Pseudophana reticulata\\", a species now placed in the genus Protepiptera. The Rovno amber specimen was first studied by Russian entomologists Alexander Emeljanov and Dmitry Shcherbakov, with their 2016 type description for the genus and species being published in the journal ZooKeys. The genus and specific epithet were coined as patronyms honoring Russian paleoentomologist Alexandr Rasnitsyn, the genus name Alicodoxa being formed from Alexandr and the species name rasnitsyni from Rasnitsyn. Description The holotype nymph is long and at the widest, with a generally ovoid outline. The exoskeleton is a dark brown color, with patches of shagreened texturing along the upper surfaces. The head extends beyond the oval outline of the body, with the rostrum folded under the body and reaching to just past the coxae of the hind legs. The pronotum is modified in outline, with 2/3 of its middle length placed between the eyes and the front edge is nearly straight. The rear section is divided into two lobes spreading away from each other to the sides with the lobes converging 1/3 of the pronotal length from the rear. Raised ridges run along the full border of the pronotum with varying degrees of development; the area where the lobes join the central mass show very little ridging, while the free margins of the pronotum have well developed ridges. There are a number of sensory pits on the upper surface and sides of the pronotum. Seven sensory pits are present on the pectoral area of each side, and four pits are developed in the humeral area. Along the upper surface there are rows totaling between nineteen and twenty-one sensory pits. Behind the pronotum, the mesonotum has an arrowhead shaped outline, bracketed by the forewing pads. The front edges are raised ridges and run parallel to the rear inside margin of the pronotum. Along each side margin are groups of six to seven sensory pits ranging in size. The wing pads are nearly parallel to each other, with the fore wing pads overlaying the hind wing pads. There are six sensor pits on the fore wing pads and only two on the hind wing pads. The abdomen has a ridge running down the center from the pronotum to the tip, and poorly developed side ridges present on tergites 4 and 5. There are rows of pits on the upper surfaces of tergites 4 to 9 ranging in number from 3 to 8 pits per tergite. On the rear faces tergites 6 to 8 there are pairs of circular wax plates covering wax gland pores, with a large central plate and a smaller upper plate. Each of the wax pores is surrounded by ridges, and the smaller upper plate of tergite 7 is divided in half by a chitinous bridge.

After subjugating the Hoysalas, Malik Kafur invaded the Pandya kingdom (called Ma'bar in Muslim chronicles) in present-day Tamil Nadu, taking advantage of a war of succession between the Pandya brothers Vira and Sundara. During March‚ÄìApril 1311, he raided several places in the Pandya territory, including their capital Madurai. He was unable to make the Pandya king a tributary to the Delhi Sultanate, but obtained a huge plunder, including elephants, horses, gold and precious stones.  Background  By 1310, Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate had forced the Yadava and Kakatiya rulers of Deccan region in southern India to become his tributaries. During the 1310 Siege of Warangal against the Kakatiyas, Alauddin's general Malik Kafur had learned that the region to the south of the Yadava and Kakatiya kingdoms was also very wealthy. After returning to Delhi, Kafur told Alauddin about this, and obtained permission to lead an expedition to the southernmost regions of India. In early 1311, Malik Kafur reached Deccan with a large army. In February, he besieged the Hoysala capital Dwarasamudra with 10,000 soldiers, and forced the Hoysala king Ballala to become a tributary of the Delhi Sultanate. He stayed at Dwarasamudra for 12 days, waiting for the rest of his army to arrive at Dwarasamudra. At this time, the Pandya kingdom, located to the south of the Hoysala territory, was in a state of political turmoil. After the death of the king Maravarman Kulashekhara, his sons Vira and Sundara Pandya were engaged in a war of succession. Some later chroniclers state that Sundara sought Malik Kafur's help, leading to the Delhi army's invasion of the Pandya territory. However, the writings of the contemporary writer Amir Khusrau cast doubt on this claim: Khusrau's account suggests that Malik Kafur raided the territories controlled by both of them. Khusrau describes Sundara Pandya as a Brahman, who was a \\"pearl\\" among the Hindu kings. He states that Sundara, whose rule extended over land and sea, had a large army and several ships.  March to the Pandya country  Malik Kafur started his march towards the Pandya territory (called Ma'bar in Muslim chronicles) from Dwarasamudra on 10 March 1311, and reached the Pandya frontier five days later. The Delhi courtier Amir Khusrau mentions that, during this march, the Delhi army covered a difficult terrain, where sharp stones tore horse hoofs, and the soldiers had to sleep on ground \\"more uneven than a camel's back\\" at night. According to the 14th century chronicler Isami, the defeated Hoysala King Ballala guided the Delhi army during the plunder of the Pandya territories. However, historian Banarsi Prasad Saksena doubts this claim, as it does not appear in the contemporary writings of Khusrau. Isami states that the Delhi army relied on a reconnaissance unit to explore the Pandya territory. This unit included leading generals such as Bahram Kara, Katla Nihang, Mahmud Sartiha, and Abachi. Every day, one of these generals would lead the reconnaissance party to visit an area of the Pandya territory, supported by a few people who knew the local language. One day, Abachi, who was a Mongol commander, decided to join the Pandya service, and even thought of killing Kafur. He got in touch with some people who promised to take him to the Pandya king. While marching towards the Pandya king's residence, his contingent came into conflict with a body of Pandya troops. Abachi asked his interpreter to communicate his intent to the Pandya troops, but the Pandya contingent suddenly attacked them and the interpreter was killed by an arrow. Abachi had to retreat and rejoin Malik Kafur. When Malik Kafur came to know about Abachi's activities, he had Abachi imprisoned. Later, Alauddin had Abachi executed in Delhi, which prompted Mongol nobles to conspire against him, ultimately leading to the 1311 massacre of Mongols. Khusrau states that the Pandya territory was protected by a high mountain, but there were two passes on either side of the mountain. He names these passes as Tarmali and Tabar, which can be identified with Tharamangalam and Thoppur. The Delhi army marched through these passes, and then encamped on the banks of a river (probably Kaveri). Next, the invaders captured a fort, which Khusrau calls \\"Mardi\\". According to Banarsi Prasad Saksena, Khusrau uses \\"Mardi\\" as an antonym of \\"namardi\\" (Persian for \\"impotence\\"), to characterize the fort's defenders. The Delhi army massacred the inhabitants of Mardi.

This is same as \\"Birdaval\\", which is named as the capital of the Ma'bar country (the Pandya territory) in Taqwƒ´m al-buldƒÅn (1321), a book by the Kurdish writer Abu'l-Fida. British scholar A. Burnell identified Birdhul as Virudhachalam. According to Mohammad Habib and Banarsi Prasad Saksena, who transliterate the name as \\"Bir-Dhol\\" (or \\"Vira-Chola\\"), the term may be a figure of speech invented by Khusrau to refer to the capital of Vira Pandya. It can be derived from the words \\"Bir\\" (Vira) and \\"Dhol\\" (drum), thus equivalent to \\"the drum (capital) of Vira Pandya\\". While describing Malik Kafur's entry into the city, Khsurau states \\"the Bir (Vira) had fled, and the Dhol (Drum) was empty\\". Owing to the war between the two brothers, the Pandya forces were not in a position to offer much resistance. Vira Pandya originally planned to flee to an island, but was unable to do so for some reason. Instead, he first marched to Kabam, a city whose identity is uncertain. He collected some soldiers and wealth from Kabam, and then escaped to Kandur (identified with Kannanur on the banks of the Kollidam River). At Birdhul, the Delhi army found a contingent of around 20,000 Muslim soldiers in the Pandya service. These soldiers deserted the Pandyas, and joined the Delhi army. Instead of killing them for being apostates, the Delhi generals decided to spare their lives. With help of the Muslim deserters, the Delhi army tried to pursue Vira Pandya, but had to retreat because of heavy rainfall. According to the Khusrau, the rural areas were so flooded that \\"it was impossible to distinguish a road from a well\\". A large part of the Delhi army encamped at Birdhul, while a small party went out in search of Vira Pandya despite the heavy rains. At midnight, the unit brought the news that Vira Pandya was at Kannanur.  Kannanur  The Delhi army marched to Kannanur in heavy rains, but by this time, Vira had escaped to a forest with some of his followers. When the rains stopped, the invaders captured 108 elephants loaded with pearls and precious stones. They massacred the residents of Kannanur. The Delhi generals wanted to find Vira Pandya, so that they could force him into becoming a tributary to the Delhi Sultanate. They suspected that Vira Pandya had fled to his ancestral fort of Jal-Kota (\\"water fort\\", identified with Tivukottai). They started marching towards Jal- Kota, but people coming from that place informed them that he was not there. Ultimately, the Delhi generals decided that finding Vira Pandya was a hopelessly difficult task, and decided to return to Kannanur.  Barmatpuri  According to Khusrau, the next morning, the Delhi army learned that the town of Barmatpuri had a golden temple, with several royal elephants roaming around it. S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar identified Barmatpuri as \\"Brahmapuri\\" (Chidambaram), whose Nataraja Temple had a golden ceiling. The Delhi army reached Barmatpuri at midnight, and captured 250 elephants the next morning. The invaders then plundered the golden temple, whose ceiling and walls were studded with rubies and diamonds. They destroyed all the Shiva lingams (called \\"Ling-i-Mahadeo\\" by Khusrau), and brought down an idol of Narayana (Vishnu). Khusrau mentions that the ground that once smelled of musk now emitted a stench of blood.  Madurai  From Barmatpuri, the Delhi army marched back to its camp at Birdhul, where it arrived on 3 April 1311. There, the invaders destroyed the temple of Vira Pandya. The Delhi forces then arrived Kanum (identified with Kadambavanam) on 7 April 1311. 5 days later, they reached Madurai (called \\"Mathura\\" by Khusrau), the capital of Sundara Pandya. By this time, Sundara Pandya had already fled the city with his queens. The Delhi army first visited the temple of \\"Jagnar\\", hoping to find elephants and treasures there. (H. M. Elliot translated \\"Jagnar\\" as \\"Jagannatha\\", but historian S. Krishnaswami Aiyangar identifies \\"Jagnar\\" as \\"Chokkanatha\\", an aspect of Madurai's patron deity Shiva.) Malik Kafur was disappointed to find that only 2-3 elephants were left at the temple. This made him so angry, that he set fire to the temple.  Rameshwaram  According to the 16th-17th century chronicler Firishta, Malik Kafur built a mosque called Masjid-i-Alai (\\"Alauddin's mosque\\"), which could still be seen during Firishta's time, at a place named \\"Sit Band Ramisar\\". This place has been identified as \\"Setubandha Rameshwaram\\", leading to suggestions that Malik Kafur raided Rameshwaram. However, this identification is doubtful, as Firishta places this mosque in the \\"Carnatik\\" country at the port of \\"Dur Samandar\\" on the shore of the \\"Sea of Ummam\\", and states that it was built after Kafur subjugated the local ruler Bikal Dev. The \\"Sea of Ummam\\" (Sea of Oman) refers to the Arabian Sea, and therefore, the mosque must have been located at a port on this sea, in the Hoysala kingdom, whose capital was Dwarasamudra (\\"Dur Samandar\\") in present- day Karnataka. Therefore, it is likely that \\"Sit Band Ramisar\\" does not refer to Rameshwaram. The writings of Amir Khusrau or Ziauddin Barani do not contain any reference to Rameshwaram, and Firishta's account may be the result of a confusion. Had Malik Kafur really constructed a mosque in Rameshwaram, Alauddin's courtier Khusrau would not have failed to mention such an achievement. If a mosque existed at Rameshwaram during Firishta's lifetime, it must have been built after the Khalji period. Although the identification of Firishta's \\"Sit Band Ramisar\\" with Rameshwaram is dubious, it is not unlikely that Malik Kafur's forces marched to Rameshwarm from Madurai, in search of the much-sought elephants and Pandya wealth. According to Amir Khusrau's Ashika, during a campaign against a ruler called \\"Pandya Guru\\", the Khalji forces reached as far as \\"the shores of the sea of Lanka\\". The capital of this ruler was called \\"Fatan\\", and had a temple with an idol. \\"Fatan\\" may be a transcription of \\"Periyapattinam\\", the name of a place near Rameshwaram.  Return to Delhi  Lilatilakam, a 14th-century Sanskrit treatise written by an unknown author, states that a general named Vikrama Pandya defeated the Muslims. Based on this, some historians believe that Vikrama Pandya, an uncle of Vira and Sundara, defeated Malik Kafur's army. However, the identification of this Vikrama Pandya as the brother of Maravarman Kulashekhara is not supported by historical evidence. The Vikrama Pandya mentioned in Lilatilakam appears to have defeated another Muslim army during 1365-70 as a prince; he ascended the Pandya throne much later, in 1401. By late April 1311, the rains had obstructed the operations of the Delhi forces, and the generals received the news that the defenders had assembled a large army against them. Kafur, who had already collected a huge amount of wealth from Hoysala and Pandya kingdoms, determined that it was futile to pursue the Pandya king. Therefore, he decided to return to Delhi. According to Alauddin Khalji's courtier and chronicler Amir Khusrau, the Delhi army had captured 512 elephants, 5,000 horses and 500 manns of gold and precious stones by the end of its southern campaign against the Hoysalas and the Pandyas. According to the exaggerated account of the later writer Ziauddin Barani (a less reliable writer who wrote during the Tughluq era), the loot included 612 elephants; 20,000 horses; and 96,000 manns of gold. Barani describes this seizure of wealth as the greatest one since the Muslim capture of Delhi. The army started its return journey on 25 April 1311. In Delhi, Alauddin held a public court (darbar) at Siri on 19 October 1311, to welcome Malik Kafur and other officers of the army. He gave 0.5 to 4 manns of gold to his various nobles and Amirs.  Aftermath  After Kafur's departure, the Pandya brothers resumed their conflict. This conflict resulted in the defeat of Sundara Pandya, who decided to seek Alauddin's assistance. With help of Alauddin's forces, he was able to re-establish his rule in the South Arcot region by 1314. Later, during the reign of Alauddin's son Qutb ud din Mubarak Shah, the Delhi general Khusro Khan raided the Pandya territories. The northern part of the Pandya kingdom was captured by the Muslims over the next two decades: it first came under the control of the Tughluq dynasty, and later became part of the short-lived Madurai Sultanate. However, the southernmost part of the Pandya territory remained independent.

He was best known for his victory over the Khan of Western Turkic Khaganate Ashina Duzhi. He was also responsible for escorting the Sasanian Persian king-in-exile Narsieh to Persia which was occupied by Arab conquerors. He dedicated most of his life to dealing with Turkic tribes in the Anxi Protectorate.  Life  Pei was a nobleman from Hedong Commandery. His prestigious clan Pei clan of Hedong had contributed numerous politicians to the court in the previous dynasties. Xingjian came from one of the 3 cadet branches of Pei Clan, the Middle house(the other two branches were the Western house and the Eastern house). Xingjian, his brother Xingyan, and his father Renji all served in the military. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang, Xingjian passed the imperial exam. General Su Dingfang saw potentials in Xingjian and personally mentored him. In 665, Pei was appointed the general of Anxi Protectorate. After serving in Anxi for several years, he returned to the imperial court where he collaborated with Li Jingxuan and Ma Zai. In 677, Western Turkic Khan Ashina Duzhi invaded Anxi with his strong forces. At this point of time, Pei asked for the mission of escorting the Persian throne successor Narsieh to his homeland. His strategy was to tackle the affairs of Persia and Turks at the same time. Tang Emperor Gaozong not only granted his wish but also gave him the mission of pacifying the turbulences in Central Asia. During his expedition to the West, he successfully defeated the Turkic forces led by Ashina. However, Pei lost his interests in reinstalling the Persian King and left Narsieh in the Anxi Protectorate alone (Although Narsieh was still able to maintain his many servants and a high quality of life). Minor Turkic chieftains in the region then pledged their loyalty to the Chinese dynasty due to the defeat of Ashina. The overall result of Pei's expedition was a success for the Tang empire. Upon returning to China, Pei was appointed the minister of rituals and Great general of the right flank guards. In 679, Turkic chieftain Ashide Wenfu rebelled. Protectorate general Xiao Siye, a noble from Lanling Commandery, was defeated by Ashide. Pei then took over the command from Xiao and decisively won a battle against the Turks in an ambush. Ashide fled. Not long after the first defeat, he gathered his troops and united them with the troops of another chieftain Ashina Funian. Pei saw the distrust and suspicions between the two chieftains and exploited this weakness by driving a wedge between them. Eventually, Ashina Funian murdered Ashide Wenfu out of the fear of Tang's revenge against him. When Funian was brought to the Tang court, he was executed regardless of the fact that he surrendered his troops. Pei had promised Ashina that he would not be put to death, however, the court did not respect Pei's promise. Due to this incident, Pei retired himself and felt deep regret. Ashina's death, according to New Book of Tang, was a scheme against Xingjian by his very own clansman Pei Yan who was jealous about his victories in the West. In 682, Pei was again in charge of pacifying yet another Turkic rebellion against the Chinese empire. However, he died of old age before the troops were sent out. The imperial court rewarded him the posthumous name Xian (Áçª) which means \\"Dedication\\", as well as the supreme military honorary title Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â).  Family  According to his epitaph written by Zhang Yue, Pei had 2 spouses. His first wife was a Xianbei noble from Luoyang. He married his second wife after the first died. His second wife was of Turkic ethnicity. This marital status of Pei made all his children only half Chinese. Pei had 5 sons: * Pei Zhenyin, half Xianbei and the eldest son, died before his father leaving a son, Pei Canyuan. * Pei Chixuan, one of his younger sons. Had a son named Pei Guangdi. * Pei Yanxiu, one of his younger sons. * Pei Qingyuan, one of his younger sons. * Pei Guangting, half Turk. Xingjian's youngest son. Later became Chancellor of Tang.

Hired on December 21, 2016 to replace Ray Woodard, he was the second head coach of the Lamar Cardinals football program since its resurrection for the 2010 season. Schultz graduated from Sam Houston State University in 1979, after which he worked as a quarterbacks and running backs coach at the university. After spending the next two decades in several other assistant coaching positions, Schultz became the offensive coordinator at TCU in 2000, a post he held through the 2008 season. He then served as the OC at Illinois and Middle Tennessee for the 2009 and 2010 seasons, respectively, before moving back to Texas to hold the same position at Texas State under returning head coach Dennis Franchione from 2011 to 2015. The 2017 season at Lamar was Schultz's first as head coach. Coaching career Early coaching career Schultz held numerous assistant coaching positions after his graduation from Sam Houston in 1979, starting as a recruiting coordinator and linebackers coach at the university that season before switching to quarterbacks and receivers the next. In his next two positions, at UTEP and Kansas State, he also served as a recruiting coordinator, as well as a receivers and tight ends coach. After two seasons as a running backs and secondary coach at Tennessee Tech and a year under Fred Akers at Texas, Schultz spent the next four years at Westwood High School in Round Rock, Texas as an assistant and defensive coordinator. Schultz returned to collegiate coaching in 1990, working under Dennis \\"Coach Fran\\" Franchione at then-Southland Conference member Southwest Texas State (now Texas State) for two seasons as a running backs and secondary coach, then moving to the University of New Mexico to hold the same position from 1992-1997 when Franchione was hired as head coach there. During Schultz's tenure at UNM, the Lobos earned the WAC Mountain Division Championship and an invitation to the 1997 Insight.com Bowl, the Lobos' first bowl appearance in nearly four decades. After that season, \\"Coach Fran\\" was hired at Texas Christian, and Schultz returned to Texas to serve as TCU's running game coordinator. The Horned Frogs went 7-5 for the 1998 season, just a year after producing a 1-11 record, and earned a berth into the Sun Bowl in which they produced 314 rushing yards and defeated the USC Trojans 28-19. TCU earned conference co-champion honors for both the 1998 and 1999 seasons. Offensive coordinator =TCU= When Franchione was hired as the head coach at Alabama for the 2001 season, TCU's defensive coordinator Gary Patterson took the reins as head coach (a position he still holds), and Mike Schultz was promoted to offensive coordinator. The Horned Frogs continued their improvement, and ended the 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2008 seasons ranked in the Top 25 by both the AP and Coaches' polls. Schultz's dominant offenses set several school records, and the Horned Frogs consistently ranked high nationally in terms of offensive production. On the backbone of the offensive power cultivated by Schultz, TCU switched conferences three times during head coach Patterson's tenure, moving from the WAC to Conference USA in 2001, joining the Mountain West Conference in 2005 and winning championship honors, and finally switching to the Big 12 in 2012. In addition to constructing a commanding offensive foundation, Schultz was also important in the development of standout players at TCU. Under Schultz's tutelage, running back LaDainian Tomlinson had his two best seasons as a Horned Frog, setting the FBS single- game record with 406 rushing yards against UTEP in 1999 and leading the NCAA with 1,850 yards in 1999 and 2,158 in 2000. Tomlinson's total of 5,263 rushing yards is a TCU record, and he won the Doak Walker Award his senior season in addition to being a Heisman Trophy finalist. After leaving the university, Tomlinson was picked fifth overall in the NFL draft, and he was later honored as the NFL's Most Valuable Player in 2006, having accrued 1,815 rushing yards and a record 28 touchdowns that season. Counting Tomlinson's two seasons separately, Schultz presided over an unprecedented five 1,000-yard rushers at TCU, more than doubling the number the school saw in its entire football history. Several years later, Schultz again demonstrated his ability to develop young players when working with future NFL star Andy Dalton. A redshirt freshman, Dalton was named the Horned Frogs' starting quarterback prior to the 2007 season, and went on to throw 10 touchdowns that season and 11 the next, amassing over 2,200 yards each year on near-60% completion ratios. Even after Schultz left, Dalton continued his success, and he went on to throw for over 3,000 yards in each of his first three NFL seasons. =Illinois= After his departure from TCU, Schultz took the offensive coordinator position at Illinois for the 2009 season. Despite high preseason expectations, the Illini failed to produce much success with their option/spread offensive scheme, and they finished the season 3-9, the fourth losing season during then-head coach Ron Zook's tenure. =Middle Tennessee= Mike Schultz joined the staff at Middle Tennessee as offensive coordinator for the 2010 season, running a spread offense which had moderately more success than his previous team. The Blue Raiders finished the season 6-7 overall, but 5-3 in Sun Belt Conference play, and the team was invited to the 2011 GoDaddy.com Bowl where they were defeated by the Miami Redhawks. = Texas State = Schultz returned to Texas State University with former head coach Dennis Franchione in 2011, when the university was transitioning from FCS to FBS classification. Schultz rejoined the staff at Texas State as the offensive coordinator, and he helped the Bobcats post a 6-6 record, including a 46-21 win against his future team, the Lamar Cardinals. For 2012, the Bobcats' first year in the FBS and only year as members of the WAC, the Bobcats finished 4-8, 2-4 in conference play. Texas State moved to the Sun Belt Conference in the following year and posted a 6-6 overall record. The 2014 season was the program's best under Schultz's tenure, and the Bobcats finished the season 7‚Äì5 overall with a 5‚Äì3 conference record to cement a three-way tie for fourth place. Although eligible, they were not selected to participate in a bowl game; the Bobcats were the only eligible 7‚Äì5 FBS team not to receive a bowl bid. Head coach =Lamar= Schultz was hired by Lamar University on December 21, 2016 to replace former head coach Ray Woodard. During the 2017 season, Schultz's first as head coach, the Cardinals won two of their 11 games with a 1‚Äì8 Southland Conference record. Schultz was fired at the conclusion of the 2019 season which the Cardinals finished 4-8 Head coaching record References External links * Lamar profile * 1958 births Living people Illinois Fighting Illini football coaches Kansas State Wildcats football coaches Lamar Cardinals football coaches Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football coaches New Mexico Lobos football coaches Sam Houston State Bearkats football coaches TCU Horned Frogs football coaches Texas State Bobcats football coaches UTEP Miners football coaches High school football coaches in Texas Sam Houston State University alumni Sportspeople from Houston ","title":"Mike Schultz (American football)"},{"id":"55119734","text":"LSDA may refer to *Learning and Skills Development Agency, UK *Le Seigneur des anneaux, French translation of The Lord of the Rings *Local Spin-Density Approximation *London School of Dramatic Art *LSDA Northern Ireland ","title":"LSDA"},{"id":"55119735","text":"Abbud is both a surname and a given name.

It was released on October 25, 2018. The film features a clash between exiled prince Lee Chung (Hyun Bin) and the Joseon Minister of War Kim Ja-joon (Jang Dong-gun) with the backdrop of a spreading zombie plague. it received mixed reviews from critics and was a Box Office Bomb, grossing 11.8 Million dollars against a budget of 15 million. Plot In the Joseon dynasty, King Lee Jo is viewed as overly deferential to the nearby Qing dynasty of China. His son, Crown Prince Lee Young, plots to buy European arquebuses to drive away the Qing. The plot is exposed by War Minister Kim Ja-joon, who holds influence over the king and frames it as a rebellion. Kim meets the Europeans and learns that they have brought zombies (called \\"night demons\\"). The crown prince commits suicide as penance so that his subordinates will be spared. Joseon forces destroy the European ship and retrieve the arquebuses, but a Joseon soldier is bitten by a zombie. He returns to his village, where he turns and spreads the infection. The zombies crave human meat and blood, are attracted by sounds, repelled by sunlight, and are stopped by decapitation or piercing of the heart. The crown prince left a request that his wife Gyeong- bin and unborn child be raised by his younger brother Lee Chung in China for their safety. Lee Chung had previously been left out of Joseon's order of succession and grew up abroad in the prosperous Qing. Lee Chung returns with his companion Hak-Su, landing in Jemulpo, but is attacked by Joseon assassins sent by Minister Kim and other ministers, who are plotting a coup. The noise of the battle draws an attack by zombified villagers. Lee Chung and Hak-Su are assisted by local partisans, including Park Eul-ryoung, former lieutenant to the crown prince, and archer Deok-hee. The Jemulpo partisans ask Lee Chung to become crown prince, but he declines, wanting to return to China. Lee Chung awkwardly flirts with Deok-hee. The only survivor of the would-be assassins is captured by Kim because he is infected. The ministers arrange for a concubine to be infected. She later turns and infects the king. Lee Chung arrives at the king's court, where he requests an army to crush the zombies. The king initially agrees but the ministers instigate him to rescind the order, claiming no zombie outbreak, only a civil rebellion. The Jemulpo partisans are arrested, while Lee Chung and Gyeong-bin are ordered to attend a banquet for a visiting Qing delegation. At the banquet, the king fully turns into a zombie, and is slain by Kim, who unleashes zombies there in an attempt to kill members of the palace and the Qing delegation, then rule with all potential opposition gone. However, Kim is bitten by a zombie, leading to the ministers turning on each other in a mad bid for power. Only Kim survives; he chops off his own hand to slow the infection, then declares himself king. Gyeong-bin convinces Lee Chung not to flee but to protect the people, so Lee Chung, the royal guard and his Jemulpo allies freed from prison proceed to fight to prevent the zombies from escaping the palace and attacking the capital. Lee Chung and his allies plan to draw the zombies together into a gigantic fiery explosion at the palace. Kim kills Hak-Su and an infected Park, preventing the explosion. Lee Chung continues the same plan, battling a horde of zombies and the half- infected Kim, ultimately succeeding by using a flaming arrow from Deok-hee. Kim is slain by Lee Chung in a duel. Reinforcements of soldiers and commoners arrive to exterminate the rest of the zombies. Lee Chung recognizes that through the power of the people, the ruined Joseon has promise after all, and elects to stay rather than leave for Qing.

Reception Critical response Shim Sun-ah from Yonhap News Agency gave a mixed review and wrote, \\"Rampant has a promising premise, but it is a bland film that is marred by a predictable plot and cardboard characters. However, the movie much to the satisfaction of fans of zombie movies, they are quick, strong and cruel, not to mention creepy. It also succeeded in giving audiences spectacular sword-fight sequences and some truly beautiful cinematography.\\" Park Jin-hae from The Korea Times also gave a mixed review and wrote, \\"Hyun's skillful action scenes with a long sword, almost singlehandedly defeating zombies endlessly swarming from all directions, are entertaining. It keeps viewers on the edge of their seats with nerve-wracking moments to the last. But the film seems to work adversely as loosening up the thrill and chills the zombies worked hard to create. Another letdown has been lack of character development.\\" Box office The film recorded 156,644 admissions with gross on its opening day, taking the box office lead from Dark Figure of Crime. On October 28, the film surpassed 1 million admissions, 4 days after its release. During its opening weekend, the film attracted 840,854 moviegoers with gross, and finished first place at the box office. However, the film dropped 80% in gross during its second weekend, with gross from 174,993 attendance, and finished third in the box office chart. As of November 18, 2018, the film grossed from 1,596,255 total attendance.

It was released for Microsoft Windows, OS X and Linux in July 2014, and later for Xbox One in January 2016, and the PlayStation 4 and Wii U in April 2016. The game received mixed reviews from critics, with praise given its visuals and soundtrack, but criticism for its presentation and level of difficulty.  Gameplay  The game is a speedrunning focused first-person shooter where the player must complete the level as fast as possible to progress. There is no plot, but rather \\"micro-levels\\" contained within larger areas. Being hit by a bullet, falling, or touching enemies causes the player to die instantly, and the player must memorize the levels to win. The player's gun does not have an aiming reticle, and bullets move slowly, forcing the player to lead their shots. Players can earn up to 3 stars depending on how fast they beat a level, with the third star requiring perfect accuracy. Certain level hazards also force the player forward, for example, apples that must be shot out of the sky or they will kill the player when they reach the ground.  Development  The game's art style and music has been compared by several critics to Katamari Damacy. Andras Neltz of Kotaku found the dissonance between the game's graphics, music and shooting mechanics to be \\"unsettling\\".  Reception  The game received mixed reception, according to review aggregator Metacritic. Tyler Wilde of PC Gamer rated the game 82/100, calling the gameplay \\"great\\" despite being \\"merciless\\", but saying the presentation was \\"mediocre\\", as it was too \\"abstract\\" to be appealing. Tim Latshaw of Nintendo Life rated the Wii U version 6/10, comparing the contrast between its \\"cute\\" graphics and \\"technical\\" mechanics \\"like opening a Hello Kitty backpack and finding nuclear launch codes within\\". He stated that while \\"dedicated speedrunners\\" would enjoy it, its appeal was otherwise \\"limited\\". James Cunningham of Hardcore Gamer rated the game a 2/5, saying that the necessity for extremely precise gameplay \\"leech[ed] the joy out of the action\\".  Sequels  Two sequels were created following the game's release, Lovely Planet Arcade, a more puzzle- oriented first-person shooter, which released on July 22, 2016, and Super Lovely Planet, a third-person platformer in which the player controls a bouncing ball without any attacks, which released on July 28, 2017. Another sequel, entitled Lovely Planet 2: April Skies, was released on June 18, 2019.

Background and education James Charles Stuart Strange was born on August 8, 1753, in London, England, United Kingdom. His parents were Robert Strange and Isabella Lumisden. His father, Robert Strange, was a former Jacobite from Orkney and had fought in the Jacobite rising of 1745, under Charles Edward Stuart, known as \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie\\" and the \\"Young Pretender\\". Robert Strange named his son James Charles Stuart Strange after Bonnie Prince Charlie, who was also James' godfather. Robert and Isabella Strange moved to London in 1750. A few years later James Charles Stuart Strange was born. James attended the College of Navarre in Paris in 1770. East India Company In 1772 James Strange obtained a writership with the East India Company (EIC), in Madras, India. He gained this post through Sir Lawrence Dundas, a relative of Strange's maternal grandmother. Like many members of former Jacobite families, James Strange and his brother Thomas Strange made their way to India, arriving in 1773. James advanced rapidly in the EIC and in private trade. In 1778 he became a Factor of the EIC. In 1780 Strange returned to England, having made a fortune. He was promoted to a Junior Merchant of the EIC in 1782. On February 18, 1785, Strange married Margaret Durham. The same year he returned to India with his new bride. From late 1785 to early 1787 he undertook a voyage to the Pacific Northwest Coast, hoping to be the first to capitalize on the nascent maritime fur trade. Afterward he returned to India and continued his career with the EIC. He was promoted to Senior Merchant in 1790. In 1795 he was appointed Collector and Paymaster for the EIC in Tanjore, India. Later that year he retired from the East India Company and returned to England. Later he rejoined the EIC and became Magistrate Collector in Puducherry (Pondichery), in 1806, then Judge of Court of Appeal, in 1807. From 1813 to 1815 he served the EIC as Postmaster General and a Senior Member of the Board of Trade. In 1816 he retired and returned to Great Britain. On the voyage home he stopped at Saint Helena where he won a game of piquet with the exiled Napoleon. Voyage to the Pacific Northwest In 1785 while returning to India after marrying Margaret Durham, Strange read newly published accounts of the third voyage of Captain Cook,Walker, p. 9 including news of the large profits made by his crew in Guangzhou (Canton), China, selling sea otter furs they had obtained at Nootka Sound on the Pacific Northwest Coast. Captain James King, who had helped take over after the death of Cook, wrote of the possible profits to be made selling northwest coast furs in China. Upon Strange's return to India and the East India Company (EIC) in later 1785, he discussed the idea of an expedition with David Scott, a prominent Mumbai (Bombay) merchant. Scott and his two partners, Tate and Adamson, obtained the support of the president and council of the East India Company in Bombay for an expedition of two ships from Mumbai (Bombay) to the Northwest Coast of America. Strange invested 10,000 pounds in the venture, which he borrowed from David Scott. Overall the cost of fitting out the expedition rose to the point where only a major success in fur trading could possibly pay back investments, let alone make a profit. Two Bombay- built, copper-hulled snows were purchased. They were the Captain Cook of 350 tons, and the Experiment of 100 tons. The Captain Cook was commanded by Henry Laurie, and the Experiment by Henry Guise. Strange was supercargo and also in overall command of the voyage. As far as the EIC was concerned, Strange was a company servant in command of a company-sanctioned, private project that, it was hoped, would lead not only to the discovery of new channels of commerce but also forestall rival attempts. Strange's instructions from the East India Company described two main purposes for the expedition. First, exploration for the benefit of navigation. This included instructions to return via Bering Strait, the Arctic Ocean as far as the North Pole, then Kamchatka, then China. Second, the establishment of a new channel of commerce from the Pacific Northwest Coast to China and India. Despite these instructions, the actual voyage was a commercial fur-trading venture no different from other early maritime fur trading expeditions to the Northwest Coast. Strange's expedition left Bombay in December, 1785. Unable to acquire goods on the Malabar Coast for trade in Macau, Strange sailed directly for the Pacific Northwest. The Experiment was holed while still in the Indian Ocean, forcing a stop at Batavia (now Jakarta) for repairs, costing time and money. After a seven-month voyage the expedition arrived on the coast of Vancouver Island on June 25, 1786 late in the trading season. On the 28th Strange entered Nootka Sound, but not the way he intended. It took nine more days to reach Yuquot, which was where Captain Cook had anchored. Strange named the harbor at Yuquot \\"Friendly Cove\\", a name which persisted for a long time. He spent about a month trading for furs around Nootka Sound with the native Nuu-chah-nulth. Strange conducted the trading negotiations himself and, like other traders, found the Nuu-chah- nulth very shrewd traders. Beyond trading negotiations, Strange did not interact with the natives very much. Alexander Walker, an ensign of the Bombay Army and later Governor of Saint Helena, who had shipped aboard the Experiment, spent a great deal of time with the Nuu-chah-nulth. He had studied the language based on Cook's vocabularies, was able to talk with the Nuu-chah- nulth. He was astonished to learn that the British fur trader James Hanna had been at Nootka Sound a year before. Up until then Strange and his crew thought themselves the first fur traders on the Northwest Coast. Walker wrote favorably of chiefs Maquinna and Callicum, who later came to figure prominently in the Nootka Crisis. Both Walker and Strange were confused about the rank of Maquinna and Callicum and generally about the Nuu-chah-nulth's system of social hierarchy. Maquinna was the highest ranked chief of the highest ranked house, while Callicum was the leading chief of the second ranking house. The visitors did not understand these things. Walker and Strange both showed preference to Callicum, and Strange made the mistake of giving gifts to Callicum before Maquinna. These things offended Maquinna and caused tension and uneasiness, which Walker failed to understand. Still, Walker's descriptions of the Nuu-chah-nulth are valuable as the earliest detailed documentation, other than Captain Cook's 1778 journal, since no first-hand account of Hanna's 1785 stay at Nootka Sound survives.Walker, p. 14-21 Strange had been instructed to establish a trading relationship with the natives. To this end he left John Mackay, assistant surgeon of the Experiment, at Nootka Sound. Strange hoped to make a second expedition, which would benefit from Mackay's time at Nootka Sound, but a second expedition never happened. Mackay remained with Maquinna's Nuu-chah-nulth for about a year. At first Mackay was quite satisfied, but one day he accidentally broke a taboo that earned him the wrath of Maquinna, after which Mackay was poorly treated and spent a miserable winter. In June 1787 Charles William Barkley arrived at Friendly Cove in the Imperial Eagle. Mackay helped Barkley gain 700 sea otter pelts from the Nuu-chah-nulth. In August another maritime fur trader, George Dixon, arrived in the King George. Mackay, eager to leave, shipped out with Dixon. Leaving Mackay behind, Strange left Nootka Sound in late July, 1786, sailing north. He stopped near the northern end of Vancouver Island, which he named Cape Scott, after David Scott, his patron in Mumbai (Bombay). He found and named the Scott Islands. Strange explored the waters north of Vancouver Island, which he named Queen Charlotte Sound. Contact was made with a group of Kwakwaka'wakw off the north coast of Vancouver Continuing east and south around Vancouver Island Strange noted the more constricted waters of Queen Charlotte Strait. Strange's discovery of Queen Charlotte Strait revived speculation about Bartolome de Fonte's alleged Northwest Passage. Strange himself thought he had found the entrance to the fabled strait, but fur trading took priority and he did investigate. Furs were not plentiful in this area, so Strange sailed north, making for Prince William Sound in Alaska, as Cook had done. On the way north land was sighted, probably Haida Gwaii, but Strange kept far to sea and passed by. On August 29, 1786, Cape Hinchinbrook, the entrance to Prince William Sound, was sighted. The two ships entered and sailed to Snug Corner Cove, where Cook had anchored. They stayed for about two weeks, until September 16. Strange tried to acquire furs but it was late in the season and there was little to be had. Additionally, the natives were far less enthusiastic about trade than the Nuu-chah-nulth. While at Prince William Sound Strange was joined by William Tipping of the Sea Otter. After their encounter, Tipping's Sea Otter was never seen again. It might have been attacked and destroyed, or it might have been lost at sea. In September, 1786, Strange left Prince William Sound and sailed to Canton, China. He sold his furs for about ¬£5,600, which was not nearly enough to cover the expenses of the expedition, nor even his own personal investment. Although his venture was a financial disaster, Strange was one of the first trader-explorers working on Pacific Northwest Coast, along with James Hanna, Charles William Barkley, and George Dixon. Political career In 1796 James Strange, a Whig, became a Member of Parliament (MP) as a guest of John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, a silent supporter of William Pitt's administration. Strange's constituency was East Grinstead. In 1802 Strange was elected as MP of Okehampton, having been recommended to the patron Henry Holland by James Strange's father-in-law Henry Dundas. Strange survived a challenge to his election by two wealthy London merchants. Strange was an inconspicuous MP, speaking only once, arguing against severity toward James Trotter, an election offender. Banking After retiring from the East India Company in 1795 Strange became a partner in the bank of Strange, Dashwood & Company, of New Bond Street, London. In 1803 Strange's bank failed, which left him impoverished and caused him to return to India, where his brother Sir Thomas Andrew Lumisden Strange helped James acquire employment with the East India Company. Personal life James Strange's first marriage, in 1785, was to Margaret Durham, the daughter of James Durham of Largo, Fife, Scotland. Margaret's brother was Philip Charles Durham, later Admiral Sir Philip Charles Calderwood Henderson Durham of the Royal Navy. They had one daughter, Isabella Katherine Strange (1785-1847). Margaret died in 1791. In 1798 Strange married Anne Dundas, the daughter of Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, and widow of Henry Drummond, an English banker and politician. They had three daughters: Mary Anne Strange (c. 1806-1889), Louisa Strange (1810-1895), and Isabella Strange (1816-1879). In 1816, after his second time in India working for the EIC, Strange retired to Scotland. After a five-month illness, James Strange died on October 7, 1840, at Airth Castle, Airth, Lanarkshire, Scotland. Legacy Several places in British Columbia were named for James Strange, including Strange Island, in Nootka Sound, and Strange Rock, near Cape Scott, Guise Bay, and Lowrie Bay. Other places are named for Strange's captains, Guise and Lowrie, and his ships, Captain Cook and Experiment. For example, near Cape Scott at the north end of Vancouver Island, Experiment Bight, and Guise Bay. And in Fitz Hugh Sound, Guise Point, and Experiment Point. A fictional account of Strange, portrayed by Jonathan Pryce, appears in the television show Taboo on BBC One and FX.

The team was owned by Anthony del Rosario. The ballclub choose to be named 'Eagles' because the city is the home of the Philippine Eagle. In the MBA's final two years, the team became known as TPG-Davao or Professional Davao Eagles. History First season The Eagles were handled by former national team coach Francis Rodriguez. The players includes Rodriguez' former wards at San Sebastian College during the 1980s; Eugene Quilban, Allan Garrido, Melchor Teves and Armoni Llagas. Two players, Rafael Santos and Jomar Tierra, were with Rodriguez' UE Warriors, while Lou Regidor and Aldrin Barola were under Rodriguez at Oriental Battery in the Philippine Basketball League. Davao started out the inaugural season with five straight victories, with three of its wins, two by buzzer beaters and one via overtime against Manila, 90-86. The Eagles stunned Batangas Blades, 84-83, on the last second triple by Rafael Santos, and pulled an 82-80 win over Pasig Blue Pirates on Eugene Quilban's last second triple. The team finished with the best record in the Southern Conference during the regular season with 14 wins as against eight losses. Next two seasons (1999-2000) The following year in 1999, during the pre- season, the Eagles will no longer have Eugene Quilban in the lineup as he has joined Sta. Lucia Realtors in the PBA. Filling in his shoes is one-time PBL Most Valuable Player Bong Marata. Helping out Marata in the playing chores is Cebuano cager Felix Belano, who played for Chowking in the PBL last season and was actually drafted by Purefoods in the PBA's annual draft but failed to make it to the team's roster. On June 2, 1999, the Davao Eagles were crowned the Southern Conference Mindanao division champions following a smashing 89-75 conquest of SocSarGen Marlins at the RMC gym.

They are not to be confused with the Freikorps. Depending on their size they could be free battalions (Freibataillone) or free companies (Freikompanien).  Emergence  The term Freibataillon emerged in the Holy Roman Empire in the second half of the 17th century for troops formed outside of the regimental system. With the development of linear tactics, light troops were needed for outposts, security and reconnaissance tasks. The soldiers recruited were supposed to be \\"free\\" of the normal discipline of the main army. Pandurs and Croats were used in this way by the Austria in the War of the Austrian Succession. Frederick II was impressed by them and created the Freibatallione, which operated independently and disrupted the enemy with sudden, surprise attacks. They were also used to defend the Pandurs of Maria Theresia. In the Prussian Army, free battalions were often formed from the hussars, j√§gers and regular infantry and were detachiert, i.e. just detached for the role. A battalion could comprise about 1,000 men, often with a light battery of several guns. In the course of the war, a total of 14 units was established, mostly under the leadership of Huguenot nobles: * Le Noble (F 1), * Mayr/Collignon/Courbiere (F 2), * Kalben/Salenmon (Favrat) (F 3), * Angelelli/Collignon (F 4), * Chossignon/Monjou (F 5), * Rapin/L√ºderitz (F 6), * Wunsch (F 7), * Du Verger/Quintus Icilius (F 8), * Hordt (F 9), * Jeney (Voluntaires d'Ostfrise) (F 10), * Schack (F 11), * Heer (Schweizer Volontaires) (F 12), * Bequignolles (F 13), * La Badie (Volontaires Etrangers) (F 14). Particularly well known was the advance of Mayr's Freibataillon (F 2) from Prussian-occupied Electoral Saxony to Franconia in May/June 1757. With the transfer of the light infantry into line regiments at the end of the 18th century the free battalions disappeared again.

During her teen years and early 20s, Nordia's extensive travels between the Caribbean Islands, Miami, New York, Los Angeles and throughout Europe would see her begin to incorporate her global perspective into her lyrics, performance and vocal styling. Her 2004 hit single \\"Be Alone Tonight\\" garnered reputable industry acclaim. Nordia also has a background in acting and modeling.

She was placed in the body building competition for Best Legs, and won the Ms. Jamaica Bikini Title as well as many more.\\"Newsline.\\" Billboard, 20 November 1999, p. 102. Professional life In 2003, Nordia left Jamaica to pursue her second lifelong passion in fashion and had plans to attend the London College of Fashion so she could work toward her dream of becoming a fashion designer. During her stay in London, she was fortunate enough to meet influential people in the film and music industries, including Rod Macsween from International Talent Booking. During this time, she got reengaged in the music industry and realized that it had always been her first love. She grew up in a musical background so music was always at her core. Her first time to get behind a microphone in a studio was actually during her visit to the U.K. in the early 2000s. One morning, she woke to a devastating phone call, learning that her brother had been killed. Without hesitation, she immediately packed her things and returned to Jamaica. While being back home, she was introduced in 2003 by a mutual friend of singer Peter Lloyd who then introduced her to a girl group/ band called MBC managed and produced by Computer Paul at his Boot Camp Studio located in Harbour View. She stayed in the band for a short while and made several appearances both on TV and at local stage shows. After her time spent with the band, she decided to give her career in music another try. Nordia had the good fortune of being introduced to the UIM Recording Studio where she recorded her first single. The studio is owned by brothers Blacka Diamond and Andrew Blacks, and located in Stony Hill, which is a neighborhood close to where she grew up. She was then introduced to Cecil Collins who became her manager. Nordia was soon signed to the Canadian label Cesoul Music. During this time, she shot the video for her single \\"Be Alone Tonight\\" which quickly topped charts both locally and internationally. In 2004, she met Jon Baker, Music Executive Producer, owner of the Geejam Collection, Geejam Studios, and founder of the successful Gee Street Music label from the ‚Äò90s, whom she introduced to her manager. Baker was also one of the producers of Jamaica‚Äôs extremely popular \\"Rising Stars\\" TV show.https://www.televisionjamaica.com/drsvideo\\"Artists Mix Work And Play At Geejam Studios in Jamaica.\\" Billboard, 25 May 2002, p. 45. Breakthrough In 2006, she started recording at Geejam Studios in Port Antonio, Jamaica, and was simultaneously featured on international TV channels, including BET. Nordia later teamed up with Santigold and did a collaboration with Switch and Diplo, a record producer, rapper, singer, songwriter and record executive who is the co-creator and lead member of the dancehall music project, Major Lazer. In addition, she recorded on the tracks \\"I'm On Yah,‚Äù \\"Touch Me\\" and \\"Tip Pon Toe,\\" written by Angela Hunt, which was later sold to Rihanna. As she grew to understand more about the music industry, she realized she needed a bit more training to complete the package. She decided to go back to Edna Manley College of Music and Performing Arts to do a course in music theory and piano to enhance what was already at her core. She also did one-on-one vocal training. In addition, she did some media training at CPTC. Nordia had previously met Cordel \\"Skatta\\" Burrell, producer of the \\"Coolie Dance Riddim\\", and now a host on \\"Magnum Kings and Queens of Dancehall\\",https://www.televisionjamaica.com/mkq who had heard some of the early songs she recorded in London. Although there was potential to collaborate, they didn't at that time because he was a hardcore dancehall producer and Nordia was not doing dancehall. She happened to meet with him again later when he introduced her to Dale Dizzle Virgo, who was also a graduate of The Edna Manley College of Visual and Performing Arts. Virgo asked her to sing something; she sang \\"One More Chance,\\" a song she wrote herself. He immediately began to play the keyboards along with her. At that moment, she knew they were going to be doing a lot of work together. After Nordia introduced Virgo to Jon Baker, he joined the Geejam Team as the in-house studio engineer and producer. Dale is also one-half of the dancehall EDM soundsystem DizTroy with partner Troy Baker, Baker's eldest son.http://emc.edu.jm/ Subsequently, Nordia added quite a number of songs to her discography, including \\"Nice n' Slow,‚Äù \\"Crazy\\" featuring Chris Martin,\\" \\"Hour Glass,\\" \\"Mr. DJ,\\" \\"Tell Me What You Wanna,\\" \\"Runway,\\" \\"I Want You,‚Äù \\"Over,\\" \\"Ole School Luv,\\" \\"Lost Myself,\\" \\"Immortal,\\" \\"B Rida,\\" \\"Gypsy\\" where she was doing a featuring for Charly B, and \\"Candy Crush\\" featuring Marlow Skye, along with many more that have yet to be released. In both 2011 and 2013, she was invited by Brandon Bakshi to participate in and signed to the BMI Writers Camp which was held at Anchor Recording Studio in Kingston; singer/songwriter Oceana who was part of her team recorded \\"Everybody (Na Na Na),\\" the official song of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, as well as Reggie Saunderson, a performer who has been writing for R&B; star Trina throughout her musical career and rapper M1. In 2013, Nordia was introduced to Substance Muzik and did a remix for her Dancehall/Soca single \\"B Rida.\\" It was released in 2014 and gained widespread attention because of a drastic turn around from her style of Lovers Rock/Pop to the Dancehall genre. She then created team \\"Coco\\" and formed a band around the project, rebranding Nordia \\"Coco\\" Witter entirely. The popular ‚ÄúI‚Äôm A Player In The Band‚Äù is another song she recorded with Substance Muzik, as well as her recent hit ‚ÄúWuk Di Money.‚Äù \\"Wuk Di Money\\" was also featured on Noisey Jamaica, alongside Island Records founder Chris Blackwell, and hosted by Walshy Fire from Major Lazer. Additional TV features include: Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, the BET Jazz channel, MTV, Vice TV, and many more. She has also been featured in Rolling Stone. Personal life Nordia met music Executive Music Producer Jon Baker in 2004 and they had a son in 2007. They got married in 2013 at the Trident Hotel and Trident Castle, both properties whose complete upgrade and renovation Baker was responsible for managing and implementing from the ground up as part of his Geejam Collection Hotel Group, which compromises a boutique hotel, private villas, and a state-of-the-art recording studio in Port Antonio, Jamaica. Nordia's mother-in-law is Maureen Baker, a British former fashion designer. She was the chief designer for the Susan Small label for many years, before working for her own label. She is perhaps best known as the designer of the wedding dress of Princess Anne. Two years ago, yet another tragedy changed Nordia's life completely. Her older brother whom she had been very close to died in a motorcycle accident on 26 December 2014. He had just walked her up the aisle at her wedding the year before. She was set to do great things in music in 2015 including working with Tom Elmhirst, a British specialist mix engineer, who had won 13 Grammy awards to date for his work with Amy Winehouse, Adele, David Bowie, Beck and Cage The Elephant. But the death of her brother took an emotional toll and she found herself leaning more toward spirituality to help recuperate from her loss. She took a long pause during this period to grow and find her purpose. Now she's moving in a different direction with her music and also looking into expanding her creative portfolio, including starting her own fashion line and working as A&R;/Co-Manager for Gee Street Records.

He was born in Cornwall, in 1848, to William Blewett and Elizabeth Williams and came to the U.S. as an infant. During his childhood, his father died while copper mining near Lake Superior.Edward son of William Blewett, born July 23, 1848 at College Street, Camborne (reg. dist. Redruth Union of the County of Cornwall), Certified Copy of an Entry of Birth, General Register Office, England. He settled in Fremont, Nebraska in 1866 and married Miss Carrie Van Anda (born 1849) on April 4, 1870 there.  Career  Edward Blewett's commercial ventures included livestock trading, mining, banking and real estate. In 1885, he was reported to have claimed that, \\"We have the largest horse ranch on this continent, if not in the world.\\" He expected his company, Oregon Horse and Land, to \\"brand close on to 11,000 horses\\" that year. He served as president of the First National Bank of Fremont (1888-1890). With others, in Seattle, Blewett founded the Blewett Gold Mining Company, which acquired the Culver Company in 1892. The new company developed the mine and mill along Peshastin Creek in the Wenatchee Mountains and formed the now-abandoned mining town of Blewett, Washington, near what is now called Blewett Pass. Ownership conflicts of the successful mine were ultimately settled by the Washington State Supreme Court in 1913 in Hadley v. Washington Meteor Mining Company. Edward and Carrie Blewett are also credited with helping to develop the Seattle community of Fremont, named after their hometown. On March 20, 1888, they purchased a parcel of newly cleared land at the northwest corner of Lake Union for $55,000. With the help of their agent, Luther H. Griffith (also from Fremont, Nebraska), the Blewetts' revised plat was recorded by King County on May 8, 1888. Blewett was also president and a trustee of the Van Anda Copper & Gold Company. As of 1897, it was mining on 774 acres of crown-granted land on Texada Island, British Columbia. The associated mining town of Van Anda is still inhabited.  Personal life  In 1904 the Blewetts moved to the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, living on West Kensington Road until their deaths: Carrie's in 1927 and Edward's in 1929.

Background Elbphilharmonie (July 2015) J√∂rg Widmann composed the oratorio ARCHE in 2016. Kent Nagano commissioned a full- length work for choir and orchestra and did not make any content restrictions. The commission of the Hamburg Philharmonic State Orchestra for the opening of the Elbphilharmonie has 300 performers with two soloists, two adult choirs and a children‚Äôs choir. Two child narrators chronicle the acts of creation and the flood. Widmann's work was inspired by the Elbphilharmonie under construction. Structure ARCHE is structured in five sections, in which Widmann roams through more than 3000 years of cultural and 300 years of music history. Antithetic or dualistic conceptions characterize large parts of the oratorio. I ‚Äì Fiat lux / Es werde Licht * Let there be light is based on the Genesis creation narrative. Beginning with silence: Let there be sound. At first noise-like sounds of wind and nature and \\"pitchless rustles and whispers\\". Air sounds and breath noises are created with wind instruments. The acts of creation are partly accompanied with heavenly chorales and burlesque, ironical musical episodes. II ‚Äì Die Sintflut * The flood is based on Genesis flood narrative and Noah's Ark. The catastrophic character is manifested by cascading masses of sound. III ‚Äì Liebe * Love The center section is characterized by antiphony between the lovers (soprano and baritone) with tragic operatic fragments. All forms of love are found within it ‚Äì dark, bright, joyous, vile and jealousy. Because of the jealousy of humans, Die Liebe leads to a double murder in a delusional fever. IV ‚Äì Dies irae * Day of wrath The strict setting of Dies irae represents the impending apocalypse. The human response is Friedrich Schiller's Ode to Joy. Widmann's setting of the poem cites Beethoven's Choral Fantasy. V ‚Äì Dona nobis pacem * Grant us peace Modern Zeitgeist is represented by an alphabet rap of the children's choir. The response is a Dona nobis pacem, performed by a boy soprano and the choirs. Man bears the fate of the earth in his own hands. The resolution of the final cadence is not complete. Scoring The setting contains voices and a large orchestra. * Vocal soloists: soprano, baritone, boy soprano * Choirs: children's choir, two mixed choirs * two children narrators (boy and girl) Instrumentation * Woodwinds: 4 flutes (all with B foot, all doubling piccolo, 3rd doubling alto flute, 4th doubling bass flute), 4 oboes (2nd doubling oboe d'amore, 3rd and 4th doubling lotus flute, 3rd doubling cor anglais, 4th doubling heckelphone), 4 clarinets in B (all doubling in A, 2nd doubling clarinet in E, 3rd doubling bass clarinet in B, 4th doubling contrabass clarinet in B), 4 bassoons (3rd and 4th doubling double bassoon) * Brass: 6 horns (1st and 2nd doubling natural horn), 4 trumpets in C (1st and 2nd doubling in B, 1st doubling high B ad lib.), 4 trombones (3rd and 4th doubling bass trombone ad lib.), tuba * Strings: 16 violins I, 14 violins II, 12 violas, 10 cellos, 8 double basses (all with 5 strings) * Percussion: 4 players, timpani * 2 harps, accordion, glass harmonica, 2 pianos (2nd doubling celesta), organ Text The language of the oratorio is German and Latin. Widmann selected a variety of texts from different centuries: * Matthias Claudius * Klabund * Heinrich Heine * Peter Sloterdijk * Hans Christian Andersen * Clemens Brentano * Friedrich Schiller * Francis of Assisi * Friedrich Nietzsche * Roland Schimmelpfennig * Thomas of Celano * Michelangelo and from Des Knaben Wunderhorn, Bible and Mass. Premiere Widmann's oratorio ARCHE had its world premiere on 13 January 2017 on the occasion of the opening festivities of the Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg.Elbphilharmonie programme, 13 January 2017 It was performed by the Hamburg Philharmonic State Orchestra conducted by Kent Nagano. Soloists were Marlis Petersen (soprano) and (baritone). The choirs were Chor der Hamburgischen Staatsoper, Audi Jugendchorakademie and Hamburger Alsterspatzen. Reception A few German newspapers critically reviewed the premiere of ARCHE. The neue musikzeitung stated that the oratorio is capable of winning a majority. Eleonore B√ºning, reviewer of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, wrote about the enthusiasm of the audience, and that Widmann's splendid, richly orchestrated music breaks all genre and style boundaries. S√ºddeutsche Zeitung wrote, that the work is diverging, and also undecided in its message. Andrew Clements, reviewer of The Guardian, wrote about the CD production: \\"fails to convince\\".

Life and career  Lind was born in Makarewa, Southland, New Zealand, on 13 June 1882 to Agnes and William Lind. She trained as a nurse at Wellington Hospital and passed her nursing registration exam in 1909. In 1913 she travelled with her friend Margaret Hitchcock to Ireland to study midwifery at Dublin‚Äôs Rotunda Hospital. At the time World War I broke out, the two women were living and working in London as private nurses. Hitchcock and Lind volunteered their services to the newly formed French Flag Nursing Corps (FFNC), At the end of October 1914 the pair were part of the first contingent of nurses that the FFNC sent to France. They were posted to the Hotel Dieu in Rouen, where they worked alongside French nuns to nurse French, Belgian, Algerian, Turkish, and German soldiers. In mid- December the pair were moved to Bordeaux, to work in a large military hospital there. Next, from the end of January to June 1915, they were posted to the small town of Bergues near the Belgian border. There they nursed victims of a typhoid epidemic. While there, the FFNC nurses were exposed to intensive artillery bombardments which destroyed nearby buildings, forcing them to live in cellars. In July 1915, the pair were moved to Bourbourg and nursed on a hospital barge which ferried sick and wounded soldiers to hospitals via the canals connecting the Belgian city of Nieuport to Dunkirk and Bourbourg in Flanders. In October 1915, Hitchcock and Lind moved again, to a contagious diseases hospital in Steenvoorde. At the end of January 1916, they relocated to Nice as Lind had fallen ill. Initially she thought she had bronchitis, however she was soon diagnosed with tuberculosis, which she had probably contracted while working on the hospital barge. In February Lind moved into a temporary hospital set up at Le Grande Hotel in Grasse. Hitchcock nursed her friend with gargles, inhalations and poultices. In October 1916, both Lind and Hitchcock resigned from the FFNC and left France to travel home to New Zealand on the hospital ship Maheno. However, Lind died on 21 November, shortly after the ship left Colombo, and she was buried at sea.  Recognition  Lind was awarded the Croix de Guerre for her wartime services to France.

A pianist, composer and musicographer, he was also director of the Dijon Conservatory, where he spent his life. Biography Charles Poisot was born in Dijon, but his family moved to Paris in 1834. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1844 where he studied piano with Adolphe Adam, counterpoint with Leborne and musical composition with Fromental Hal√©vy until 1848. In 1850, he composed an Op√©ra comique in an act, Le Paysan, on a traditional theme mixing nobility and love (the libretto is by Pujol).Op√©ra-Comique: A Sourcebook Par Robert Ignatius Letellier, page 625 He returned to Dijon in 1852 where he devoted himself to teaching, musicology and composition, continuing his piano interpretations. In 1868, he was appointed Director of the Municipal School of Music, the future , and was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des Sciences, Arts et Belles-Lettres de Dijon in 1869. He played an active role in the city's cultural life until his sudden death in his home at 4 Buffon Street at the age of 81. He had his works performed in the city, gave talks on the glories of Burgundy (sculptor Fran√ßois Rude, poet and playwright Charles Brifaut and created a high level choir: \\"la Soci√©t√© des Dames\\". A street in Dijon bears his name. Current statue of Jean-Philippe Rameau in Dijon. Stone copy of the original 1880 statue. A fervent admirer of Jean-Philippe Rameau, he began in 1860 with other Dijonnais (Jules Mercier, L√©on Gastinel, ...) a campaign to erect a statue in honour of the great Dijon composer of the 18th century for the centenary of his death in 1864. The affair dragged on for a long time and it was only on 12 August 1876 that the model of the sculptor's statue Eug√®ne Guillaume was finally erected on Place de la Sainte-Chapelle and a concert was given at the Grand Th√©√¢tre with Camille Saint-Sa√´ns. It was not until 1880 that the model was replaced by the final bronze statue (it was melted down by the Germans in 1942 and replaced by a stone copy in 1950). Article du journal Le Bien Public le 17/04/2013 Charles Poisot, entre lettres et musique Charles Poisot collaborated in the publication of Rameau's works and produced numerous arrangements for piano and singing of his operas. He was also involved in the creation of the \\"Soci√©t√© des Compositeurs de Musique\\" (established in Paris in 1862). Works His musical work is quite abundant and varied, but it has not left its mark on the history of music. He composed op√©ras comiques early in his career (Le Paysan in 1850), religious pieces (one cantata, Jeanne d'Arc; motets; one Stabat Mater; one requiem, three oratorios) and many piano pieces (exercises, arrangements, songs, melodies and fantasies), some in collaboration with Joseph O'Kelly.

History In 1854, Francis Hurt died and his three unmarried sisters had to leave Alderwasley Hall to make space for his male heir. Upon the death of Hurt, the sisters were paid large sums to guarantee their financial independence, and in 1859 they started construction on a country home near Crich, Derbyshire. This house was built on the site of \\"Hob Hall\\", a house of which little is known. Benjamin Ferrey was consulted as architect, and the house was built to an irregular T plan of regular coursed gritstone and ashlar dressings. The house is mainly of two storeys with gabled dormers to the attics. The southern elevation has an open four-bay arcade with segmental arches from octagonal piers. Constructed started in 1859, and the main house was complete by 1861. The house now carries Grade II listing. In 1870, work was made on the construction of a lodge and stable block built from regular coursed gritstone to match the house. A lodge has a statue of a deer mounted upon its gable. The entire estate is flanked by stone walls of 1.5 metres height. These also carry Grade II listing. The three sisters were great benefactors to Crich parish and donated three stone seats for parishioners to rest on the way to St Mary's Church.

He served as ambassador to London 1873‚Äì1885\\"Prince von Munster\\". Kalgoorlie Miner, 9 October 1899, p. 2. Retrieved from Trove, 2 September 2017. and Paris (1885‚Äì1900). Early life and education M√ºnster was born in London, where his father, Ernst zu M√ºnster, was the Hanoverian Minister at the Court of King George IV. He studied law at the universities of Bonn, Heidelberg, and G√∂ttingen. At 18, he inherited the family's considerable estate and hereditary seat in the Hanoverian parliament, the Estates Assembly of the Kingdom of Hanover. He also followed his father into the Hanoverian diplomatic service. Career From his father, M√ºnster inherited strong Guelph sympathies and conservative viewpoints. During the German revolutions of 1848‚Äì49, he opposed reforms and the abolition of privileges for the nobility, and he voted against giving the Hanoverian National Assembly to right to pass laws for Hanover. During the early years of his own career, these family traditions kept him closely attached to the Hanoverian dynasty. Prom 1856‚Äì64, he was the Hanoverian Minister in Saint Petersburg, the same post his father had held 50 years prior. In 1866, M√ºnster tried and failed via diplomatic channels to bring understanding between Hanover and Prussia, and the latter annexed the former as a result of the Austro-Prussian War. His subsequent rise in the Prussian diplomatic service was met with reproach by the Guelphs, but M√ºnster was convinced that Germany could only be saved by strong Prussian leadership. \\"My conception of a true Hanoverian,\\" he wrote, \\"is that he must be first of all a German.\\" M√ºnster represented the town of Goslar in the Reichstag from 1867‚Äì73, when he was appointed by Otto von Bismarck to succeed Albrecht von Bernstorff at the Court of St James's. M√ºnster spent the next 28 years in London and Paris, and M√ºnster contributed substantially to smoothing over many minor conflicts between France and Germany. He represented the German Empire at the 1889 Hague Convention, after which he received the title of Prince. In 1900, he was awarded the Order of the Black Eagle. In December 1901, he retired to his villa in Hanover. Personal life M√ºnster was twice married. In 1847, he married Alexandra, Dowager Princess Dolgorukova (1823‚Äì84), widow of Dmitry Nikolaevich Dolgorukov; n√©e Princess Golitsyn, daughter of Prince Mikhail Mikhailovich Golitsyn (1793‚Äì1856). Their son was Alexander M√ºnster. He married secondly, at Dysart House in 1865, to Lady Elizabeth St Clair-Erskine, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Rosslyn. He died in Hanover.

It included an obligation for Muslims to abide by Shariah law. Background In March 1945, the Japanese military authority in Java during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia established the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (Badan Penyelidik Usaha Persiapan Kemerdekaan (BPUPK)) to decide on key issues related to the future independent state, including its constitution. There was a clear division on the committee between those who wanted a secular state and those who wanted a greater role for Islam. On 1 June, the last day of the first session, nationalist and future Indonesian president Sukarno made a speech outlining the Pancasila - the five principles that would form the ideological basis of the new state. A sub-committee of eight members, the panitia kecil (small committee), was set up with Sukarno as chairman to discuss the issues that had emerged. The drawing up of the document In the recess between the two BPUPK sessions, at the urging of future president Sukarno, 38 members met and decided to task a committee of nine members, the Panitia Sembilan, with starting to draft the constitution. These members, and their affiliations were: * Sukarno (secular Muslim nationalist) * Mohammad Hatta (secular Muslim nationalist) * A.A. Maramis (secular Christian nationalist) * Abikoesno Tjokrosoejoso (Muslim nationalist, former leader of the Indonesian Islamic Union Party (PSII)) * Abdoel Kahar Moezakir (Muslim nationalist, leading member of Muhammadiyah) * Agus Salim (Muslim nationalist, former leader of Sarekat Islam) * Achmad Soebardjo (secular Muslim nationalist) * Wahid Hasjim (Muslim nationalist, leader of Nahdlatul Ulama) * Mohammad Yamin (secular Muslim nationalist) Over the course of the afternoon of 22 June, the nine men produced a preamble for the constitution that included Sukarno's Pancasila philosophy, but added the seven words in Indonesian (dengan kewajiban menjalankan syariat Islam bagi pemeluknya) that placed an obligation on Muslims to abide by Islamic law. Mohammad Yamin, who played a dominant role in the wording, named the preamble the Jakarta Charter. Text of the document Subsequent developments On 17 August 1945, Sukarno declared Indonesian independence. The following day, the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI), which had been established with Japanese permission on 7 August, was due to meet. Hatta in particular and Sukarno were both worried that the obligation on Muslims would alienate non-Muslims. Before the meeting, Hatta met with Muslim leaders and managed to persuade them to agree to the removal of the seven words \\"for the sake of national unity\\". The PPKI then met and elected Sukarno and Hatta president and vice-president respectively. It then discussed the draft constitution, including the preamble. Hatta spoke in favour of removing the seven words, and Balinese delegate, I Gusti Ktut Puja, suggested replacing the Arabic word \\"Allah\\" with the Indonesian word for God (\\"Tuhan\\"). This was accepted, but for some reason when the constitution was officially published, this change was not made. Following further discussion, the constitution was approved. When the 1945 constitution was replaced by the United States of Indonesia Federal Constitution of 1949, and this in turn replaced by the Provisional Constitution of 1950, there were no attempts to include the seven words in the preambles, despite their similarity to 1945 version. However, in 1959, the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia, which had been set up to produce a permanent constitution, reached deadlock as the Islamist fraction wanted a greater role for Islam, but like the other factions, did not have enough support to win the two-thirds majority to push through its proposals. The Islamist faction supported the government's proposal to return to the 1945 Constitution on condition that the obligation on Muslims be re-inserted in the preamble. The nationalist faction voted this down, and in response, the Islamist faction vetoed the reintroduction of the 1945 Constitution. On 9 July 1959, Sukarno issued a decree dissolving the assembly and reinstating the original constitution, but without the seven words the Islamists wanted. To placate them, Sukarno stated that his decree relied on the Jakarta Charter, which had inspired the 1945 Constitution and which was an \\"inseparable\\" part of it, but was not a legal part of it. There were two further attempts to revive the Jakarta Charter. In the 1968 special session of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Parmusi, a new Islamist party, called for it to have legal force, but the proposal was voted down. In 2002, during the MPR session that passed the final amendments to the constitutions, a number of small Islamic parties with the support of Vice-president Hamzah Haz tried again, this time by amending the Article 29 of the constitution to make shariah law obligatory on Muslims, but they were resoundingly defeated.

Events According to Mellaart, he encountered a young lady called Anna Papastrati on a train from Istanbul to Izmir and noticed that she was wearing an unusual armband. She is meant to have told him that this armband was part of a collection of antiquities, which was in the possession of her family. He therefore went to the house of Papastrati, who according to him was a young Greek lady and spoke good English with a slight American accent. There she showed him numerous pieces which were stylistically associated with the Yortan culture. The Yortan culture was one of the cultures which neighboured ancient Troy. Mellaart stayed several days in the house at Izmir, making sketches and notes. Photography of the pieces was forbidden, according to Mellaart. Papastrati promised to photograph the pieces herself at the next opportunity and send the photos to him. The items were said to have been found in shallow graves near the city of Dorak, south of the Sea of Marmara, during the Greco- Turkish War. Mellaart reported that he had seen photographs of the graves in which the Dorak treasure had been found and that there was a description of the discovery in Modern Greek, which he had also seen. Mellaart said he left the house after a few days without correctly noting its location, although he noted a name and address (Anna Papastrati, 217 Kazim Direk Street, Izmir) on a piece of notepaper. No communication was received subsequently from Papastrati. Mellaart said that he did not make the discovery public at first because he was waiting for the photos and consent to publication. He said he had written to Izmir twice without receiving an answer. In mid-October 1958, a letter was received by the British Institute of Archaeology in Ankara, where Mellaart was deputy director. It read: The letter was dated \\"18/10/1958\\" and the return to sender address was \\"Kazim Direk Caddesi no. 217, Karsiyaka ‚Äì Izmir.\\" Mellaart then published his sketches and notes on the finds in The Illustrated London News. Discussing their significance in the article, Mellaart drew parallels with the Treasure of Ur. Investigations by the Turkish authorities and by journalists revealed, however, that the address on Kazim Direk Caddesi belonged to a commercial building in a street which had no residential houses. However, there were at least two other streets of the same name in Izmir at that time, and the street might have been renamed. At any rate, the address could not be located. The pieces which Mellaart had described, never appeared in private collections or on the legal art market. In 1962, the Turkish press began to accuse Mellaart of smuggling the treasure out of the country, in exchange for a cut worth 240 million Deutsche Marks. There was eye-witness testimony that a thick-set foreigner had been seen near the find location at Dorak with a woman; one witness even identified Mellaart himself. By 1964, public pressure had reached such a point that the Turkish government forbade Mellaart to excavate at √áatalh√∂y√ºk; the following year, the government did allow him to enter Turkey, but on the condition that he would participate in excavation only as an assistant. Debate about the Dorak Treasure There are various views about the reality behind the Dorak affair. One perspective holds that Mellaart, who was known only in relation to the excavations at √áatalh√∂y√ºk, had invented the treasure himself. The supposed letter from Anna Papastrati has similarities with the typewriter used by his wife in the institute and for his other correspondence at that time.Suzan Mazur, \\"Dorak Diggers Weigh in on Anna & Royal Treasure\\", www.scoop.co.nz from 4 August 2005 Another opinion connects the American accent of \\"Anna Papastrati\\" with the US base at Izmir or with employment at a CIA operation there. In the late 1960s, this was known as a key point for smuggling of items out of Turkey for the illegal art market. In this view, Mellaart was used to provide high-value finds of the Yortan culture with a history from a renowned expert. In this view, the meeting with Mellaart on the train was intentionally arranged and he was then played by criminals.Dora Jane Hamblin, T√ºrkei ‚Äì Land der lebenden Legenden, Bastei-L√ºbbe, Bergisch Gladbach 1975, , S. 196 f.

In early April 1942, while attached to the British Eastern Fleet, Vampire was ordered to escort the British aircraft carrier from Ceylon. Following the Japanese Fast Carrier Task Force's attack on Colombo in early April, Hermes and Vampire were ordered to depart Trincomalee, to avoid any follow-up strike. On 8 April, the two ships were located and attacked by Japanese aircraft, from 10:35. The first wave of attackers severely damaged Hermes, which sank within 20 minutes. A second wave of Japanese aircraft attacked and scored many hits on the destroyer. Vampire shot down at least one aircraft before breaking in half and sinking.

After winning his only race as a two-year-old in 2007 he made a significant impact on his first appearance at three when he was an impressive winner of the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial. He finished when favourite for The Derby and ran second in the Irish Derby on his only other start of 2008. As a four-year- old he added wins in the Tattersalls Gold Cup and the Royal Whip Stakes but then sustained a serious leg injury in the Irish Champion Stakes. He was gelded at the end of that year and never raced again. Background Casual Conquest was bay horse with short white socks on his hind legs, bred in Ireland by his owners, the Moyglare Stud. During his track career he was trained by Dermot Weld at the Curragh, County Kildare and was ridden in all of his races by Weld's stable jockey Pat Smullen. He was from the ninth crop of foals sired by Hernando, a French horse who won the Prix du Jockey Club in 1993. As a breeding stallion Hernando also sired Holding Court, Sulamani and Look Here. Casual Conquest's dam Lady Luck, who produced several other winners including Afternoon Sunlight (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial) and Elusive Double (Tyros Stakes), won one minor race from two starts as a three- year-old in 1998. She was a descendant of the American broodmare Grenzen (foaled 1975) who was the ancestor of many other good winners including Go And Go, Refuse To Bend and Media Puzzle. Racing career 2007: two-year-old season On 8 September at Leopardstown Racecourse Casual Conquest began his racing career in a maiden race over seven furlongs and started at odds of 4/1 in a ten-runner field. After racing in fourth place he took the lead in the straight and held of a sustained challenge from the John Oxx-trained Hanoverian Brown to win by a short head. 2008: three-year-old season Casual Conquest began his second season in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial over ten furlongs at Leopardstown on 11 May and started at odds of 13/2. The highly regarded Washington Irving (from Aidan O'Brien's Ballydoyle stable) started the odds-on favourite with the best-fancied of the other three runners being the Ballysax Stakes winner Moiqen. He raced towards the rear of the field and appeared to be struggling before beginning to make progress on the outside in the straight. He went to the front inside the last quarter mile and drew right away from his opponents to win \\"easily\\" by six lengths from Washington Irving. The result established the colt as a leading contender for the 2008 Epsom Derby even though he had not been entered for the race and could only run if his owners paid a supplementary entry fee of ¬£75,000. At Epsom Racecourse on 7 June Casual Conquest (with the supplementary entry fee having been paid) started the 7/2 favourite in a sixteen-runner field for the Derby. After being restrained by Shanahan in the early stages he turned into the straight in fourth place and then moved into second behind Tartan Bearer approaching the final furlong. He was unable to quicken in the closing stages and finished third behind New Approach and Tartan Bearer. Twenty-two days later the colt started second favourite behind Tartan Bearer for the Irish Derby at the Curragh. He raced towards the rear of the field before staying on strongly in the straight but baut was beaten two lengths into second place by Frozen Fire. The colt then had training problems and did not race again in 2008. 2009: four-year-old season After an absence of ten months, Casual Conquest returned in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 2 May. He started odds-on favourite but was defeated by the John Gosden-trained Bronze Cannon. Three weeks later the colt returned to Ireland and was dropped in distance for the Group 1 Tattersalls Gold Cup over ten furlongs at the Curragh and started at odds of 11/4. The favourite was the Weld-trained Famous Name (Leopardstown 2,000 Guineas Trial, Trigo Stakes), while the other three runners were Lush Lashes, Thewayyouare (Crit√©rium International) and Moiqen. In a change of tactics Casual Conquest led from the start before accelerating away from his opponents in the straight, and won by five and a half lengths from his stablemate Famous Name. After the race Dermot Weld said \\"He deserved that. He's a very good horse from last year. On his reappearance it was very firm ground at Newmarket and my concern today was whether he'd handle the extremely opposite on testing ground. He did it well and I'm very pleased with him. The Arc will be his target\\". Two months after his last run, Casual Conquest was dropped in class and started odds on favourite for the Group 3 Meld Stakes at Leopardsown. Carrying top weight of 140 pounds he took the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third behind She's Our Mark and Lord Admiral. The Group 3 Royal Whip Stakes over the same distance at the Curragh in August saw the colt start 8/13 favourite against four opponents headed by the Mooresbridge Stakes winner Curtain Call. He took the lead two and a half furlongs and saw off a sustained challenge from Curtain Call to win by one and a quarter lengths with the pair finishing thirteen lengths clear of the rest. Weld commented \\"Casual Conquest did that nicely as the runner-up is a decent horse. He is ideally suited by soft ground\\". Casual Conquest returned to Group 1 class for the Irish Champion Stakes in September. He started a 16/1 outsider and never looked likely to win, coming home seventh of the nine runners behind Sea the Stars and sustaining a leg injury in the process. Any prospects of Casual Conquest embarking on a career as a breeding stallion ended in December 2009 when he underwent a gelding operation. It was hoped that he would resume his track career, possibly under National Hunt rules, but he never raced again.

Early life Abby Hutchinson was born in Milford, New Hampshire, on August 29, 1829. She was the fourth daughter and the sixteenth and youngest child of Jesse Hutchinson (1778‚Äì1851) and Mary Hastings Leavitt (1783‚Äì1868), descendants of the Pilgrims. Thirteen of those children lived to adult age, but in 1892, only John and Abby were living. Hutchinson came from a long line of musical ancestors, principally on the maternal side. Her mother sang mostly psalms and hymns, and the first words Abby learned to sing were the sacred songs taught her by her mother, while she stood at her spinning-wheel. When four years of age, Abby could sing alto, which seemed to the family a wonderful performance. A little later she went to the district school with her sister and young brothers. There she acquired the simple English branches of study. Career The Hutchinson siblings In 1839 Abby Hutchinson Patton made her first appearance as a singer in her native town. On that occasion the parents and their thirteen children took part. In 1841, with her three younger brothers, Judson, John and Asa, she began her concert career. The quartet sang in autumn and winter, and the brothers devoted the spring and summer to the management of their farms, while the sister pursued her studies in the academy. In May 1843, the Hutchinson family first visited New York City. Their simple dress and manners and the harmony of their voices took the New Yorkers by storm. The press was loud in their praise, and the people crowded their concerts. The Hutchinsons, imbued with the love of liberty, soon joined heart and hand with the Abolitionists, and in their concerts sang ringing songs of freedom. This roused the ire of their pro-slavery hearers to such an extent that they would demonstrate their disapproval by yells and hisses and sometimes with threats of personal injury to the singers, but the presence of Abby held the riotous spirit in check. With her sweet voice and charming manners she would go forward and sing \\"The Slave's Appeal\\" with such effect that the mob would become peaceful. Those singers were all gifted as songwriters and music-composers. In August 1845, Abby went with her brothers, Jesse, Judson, John and Asa, to England. They found warm friends in William Howitt and Mary Howitt, Douglas William Jerrold, Charles Dickens, William Macready, Harriet Martineau, Hartley Coleridge, Mrs. Tom Hood, Eliza Cook, Samuel Rogers, Hon. Mrs. Norton, George Thompson, Richard Cobden, John Bright and many others. Charles Dickens gave the family an evening reception in his home. George Hogarth, the father of Catherine Dickens, Dickens' wife, and critic of Italian opera, after hearing the family sing, took them by the hands and said that he never before had heard such fine harmony. At their opening concert many prominent literary and musical people were present. After one year of singing in Great Britain the family returned to America and renewed their concerts in their native land. After her marriage Patton sang with her brothers on special occasions. At the outbreak of the Civil War, in 1861, Patton joined with her brothers in singing the songs of freedom and patriotism. During her travels Patton was a frequent contributor to the American newspapers. She composed music to several poems, among which the best known are \\"Kind Words Can Never Die\\" and Alfred, Lord Tennyson's \\"Ring Out, Wild Bells.\\" In 1891 she published a volume entitled \\"A Handful of Pebbles\\", consisting of her poems, interspersed with paragraphs and proverbs, containing the essence of her happy philosophy. She was interested in the education of women and was an earnest believer in women's suffrage, which movement she has aided by tongue and pen. Personal life Abby Hutchinson Patton, 1865 On February 28, 1849, Abby Hutchinson married Ludlow Patton (1825‚Äì1906), a banker and broker in New York City, and an active member of the New York Stock Exchange. In April 1873, Ludlow Patton retired from business with a competency. For the next ten years the Pattons traveled for pleasure through Europe, Asia, Africa and all portions of their own country. She died on November 24, 1892, and is buried at North Yard Cemetery, Milford, New Hampshire.

Origins The track was located on the west side of Temple Mills Lane and accessed by a road called Wycliffe Road at the time. To the west was the River Lea and it was dominated to the east, north and south by the Temple Mills Great Eastern Railway. It was constructed on ground next to an Artificial Manure Works and resulted in the considerable reduction of Wycliffe Road. Opening The track is known to have been in operation in January 1933, when it was hosting whippet racing over 315 and 480 yards. It is not to be confused with Hackney Wick Stadium or Clapton Stadium. History The track was described as a very basic flapping track (independent, not affiliated to the National Greyhound Racing Club). It held significant boxing bout during 1935 including ones by Dick Corbett and Harry Mizler. The 1946 tote turnover reached ¬£776,050, a sizeable sum bearing in mind the track only housed a maximum of 650 people. During 1946 the National Greyhound Racing Club visited the track (during the ¬£1,000 Cambridgeshire final event) with the intention of catching attendees with an NGRC licence in their name. If they identify anyone they will subsequently disqualify them from all NGRC tracks. The attending of flapping tracks by any person with a licence is prohibited in the rules of racing. On 11 February 1947 the track held a daylight race meeting despite a government ban announced by Sir Guy Bower (the Deputy Secretary). The ban was designed to conserve fuel and the meeting was attended by government officials to verify that no electricity was used. The hare was powered by two men on a tandem. Closure It is believed that it closed around 1949. It became a playing field on the north side of the newly constructed Clays Lane. before being converted into a council-run site for Travellers. Initially cleared for the 2012 Summer Olympics, it is today the Chobham Manor housing, on the south side of Abercrombie Road, close to the Lee Valley VeloPark.

Pickowicz then trained at University of Wisconsin, Madison in modern Chinese intellectual history with Maurice Meisner. He wrote his doctoral thesis on the Marxist intellectual, Qu Qiubai, who was influential in forming leftist literary theory before he was executed by the Nationalist government in 1935. He was awarded a Ph.D degree in 1973. His book on Qu was published by University of California Press in 1981. Pickowicz was among a group of American students to travel to the People's Republic of China as a delegation of the Committee of Concerned Asian Scholars in 1971. After joining the faculty of University of California, San Diego in 1973, he broadened his interests to include local village history. Together with Edward Friedman and Mark Selden, Pickowicz spent several years in a north China village interviewing and observing residents and local officials. Official views in China and many western scholars had seen Mao's revolution as a \\"peasant revolution, but their two books, Chinese Village, Socialist State and Revolution, Resistance, and Reform in Village China presented a detailed and dramatic picture of state exploitation. The volumes explained the seeming success of radical village experiments, such as those at Dazhai, by the discovery that the state had given them extensive subsidies. His interest in the history of Chinese film led to a series of articles and books. At the University of California, San Diego, Pickowicz and his colleague Joseph Esherick inaugurated a doctoral program in modern Chinese history which has produced several dozen students whose theses have been published as books. Works on the Chinese village under socialism The collaborative work with Esherick and Friedman drew both praise and critical discussion. The two books describe the village of Wugong, in Raoyang county, Hebei, some 200 kilometres south of Beijing. Wugong was designated as a model village, partly to honor its having founded a co-operative at the height of the Second Sino-Japanese war. The first volume is devoted to the 1940s and 1950s, which include the war years and the coming to power of the Communist Revolution and the land-reform campaigns. The second begins with the formation of the commune and the famine of the Great Leap Forward and follows the village through the early years of the next century. In each, the leading figure is Geng Changsuo (1900- 1985), the leading cadre. Lucien Bianco, a French historian who specializes in rural Chinese history, wrote that he did not share the enthusiasm for the first volume, but thought that this second volume was much better. He felt that offering a step-by-step chronicle brought a certain lack of focus and did not offer a thematic context. The great difference from the first volume, however, was that the authors have ‚Äúlost their illusions.‚Äù This is best illustrated, Bianco felt, through ‚Äúthe themes of patronage and clientelism, and the privileges which have been perpetuated from Mao‚Äôs revolutionary era through to the current post-revolutionary era.‚Äù These themes were present in the first volume, but the second one details ‚Äúthe themes of patronage and clientelism, and the privileges which have been perpetuated from Mao‚Äôs revolutionary era through to the current post-revolutionary era,‚Äù and the authors make clear ‚Äúnot only the favours but also the denunciations and recantations which disgraced leaders are forced into by changes in the Party line, beginning with Geng Changsuo (1900- 1985), Wugong‚Äôs established head.‚Äù Bianco also praises the book for its refusal to condemn the opportunistic leader, Geng, who made his family rich but himself lived simply, and who kept the loyalty of the villagers even when the Red Guards were sent to unseat him: ‚ÄúHe is authoritarian without mistreating the villagers.‚Äù Lucien Bianco, (Review), China Perspectives 2007 Bianco concludes that ‚ÄúNothing is one-sided, or caricatural in this book, not even the condemnation of Maoism or its freeloading inferior successors. It is a local history told with a critical distance but never bereft of sympathy. It is a sober, concise, incisive account, quite often simply complemented by a final line or concluding phrase.‚Äù Studies on film and culture Pickowicz told an interviewer that he was made to feel unwelcome when he first did research in Chinese archives but the situation gradually improved.Paul Pickowicz on a Century of Chinese Film (Interview), China Digital Times (August 2014) Works * Marxist Literary Thought and China: A Conceptual Framework.

Local men killed a criminal J√≥zef \\"Ciechanek\\" Ciechanowicz who was terrorizing the community.  Background  Ciechanowicz was a 60 year old recidivist who spent over 30 years in prison, for batteries, thefts and rapes. While out of prison he extorted pensions and bullied residents of W≈Çodowo and Brzydowo villages and robbed local shops. According to his neighbors, he often wandered around while drunk, with an axe or a cleaver in his hand, mumbling that he would kill someone eventually, because he wanted to go back home (prison). The police did not always respond to calls, and when they did, their intervention had no effect.  Death  On the day of his death, Ciechanowicz entered the yard of Winek's family house where he saw Jagoda Rybak, daughter of his former mistress. The woman took her mother in hiding, after he had wounded her with a screwdriver. Ciechanowicz was upset because he could no longer seize her pension. Earlier he had broken a bottle on Jagoda's head. Tomasz Winek, owner of the house, ordered him to leave but instead of retreating, Ciechanowicz brandished a beetroot cleaver. Winek took a wooden bat from the pile and fought Ciechanowicz who gashed him with the cleaver. Winek's neighbour came to help and forced Ciechanowicz to flee. Winek's wife called the police, but heard that no police cars were available. Later on they drove to nearby Dobre Miasto. Police officers were still refusing to send officers to W≈Çodowo, claiming that none were available. After they returned, a group of locals (including two Winek brothers) gathered. Ciechanowicz returned, waiving his cleaver and threatening to kill \\"you all and your brats\\" (Winek's young son was playing in the yard), the group started to chase him. They caught him in the hollow near the forest and beat him with bats, shovels and car spring. He was alive when they left him, although he died from these wounds.  Trials  After the incident Tomasz Winek and his brothers Miros≈Çaw and Krzysztof were arrested but were released by the prosecutor's decision on 7 November 2005. People of nearby villages raised money to pay legal expenses. On 23 October 2007 they were sentenced to 2 years in prison and placed on probation for 3 years. However, on 15 January 2009, an appeals court extended the sentence to 4 years of prison, without parole. On 18 December 2009, they were pardoned by the president of Poland Lech Kaczy≈Ñski and their sentence was changed to 10 years of probation. Three other persons received minor suspended sentences. Two police officers from Dobre Miasto police station who did not react to calls for help received suspended sentences, for failure to execute their duty. One of them was dismissed from service and the other one was downgraded. The court did not accept their defense that they had no means to react. In January 2012 the Winek brothers were apprehended again for 48 hours in relation to the disappearance of a man living in their village. They were released without an accusation and a court directed financial compensation for them.  Popular culture  The event was pictured in the television series Pitbull and Kryminalni. It was also an inspiration for the Polish thriller movie Lincz.

His duties were centred upon the Whitechapel watch-house, from which he and his watchmen had to deal with nocturnal criminality in an area of rapidly increasing population, crowded conditions with poor sanitation, and much urban poverty and squalor. Plunkett's term of office just preceded the Metropolitan Police Act 1829, by which a new system of policing was introduced. Plunkett was often called upon to give evidence at the Old Bailey,The Proceedings of the Old Bailey 1674‚Äì1913, Old Bailey online. the cases being scheduled for hearings two or three times a year. His testimony and that of his officers in these more serious cases show his relations with the population at large, his investigations, pursuits and arrests, often based on personal knowledge of the offenders. The majority of these cases resulted in convictions leading to penal transportation. His work illustrates the real activities of the parish police of Whitechapel just over a decade before the writing of Oliver Twist.Charles Dickens, Oliver Twist; or, The Parish Boy's Progress (first book edition, Richard Bentley, London 1838): the arrest in Clerkenwell (Chapters X-XI); Whitechapel and Bethnal Green (Chapters XVIII-XIX, XXI).  Background and family  Richard Plunkett was born, lived and died in Whitechapel. He was a son of Luke Plunkett and Margaret Read, who were married at Christ Church, Spitalfields in January 1772.Christ Church, Spitalfields, Register of Marriages, P93/CTC1/014 (London Metropolitan Archives). From various different homes in the neighbourhood, Luke and Margaret christened their children at St Mary Matfelon, Whitechapel between 1776 (as of Bell Yard) and 1790 (as of Rosemary Lane, now Royal Mint Street).See an 1860 photograph of the old St Mary Matfelon at Middlesex Heraldry site. Richard was christened in April 1788 as of George Yard in Gunthorpe Street.St Mary, Whitechapel, Register of Baptisms, Oct 1774-May 1792, P93/MRY1/011 (London Metropolitan Archives). Not much is known about Richard's childhood, but in February 1808, at Christchurch Spitalfields, he married Ann Haffner,Christ Church, Spitalfields, Register of Marriages, P93/CTC1/017 (London Metropolitan Archives). the middle of three daughters of Thomas Haffner and his wife Elizabeth Hunt.Married 10 April 1777: St Dunstan And All Saints, Register of Marriages, P93/DUN/044 (London Metropolitan Archives). Haffner lived at No. 2 Union Court, Fashion Street, and Richard Plunkett and his wife lived at No. 3 soon after their marriage. Fashion Street was just north of Keate Street and Thrawl Street, between Brick Lane and Commercial Street. Plunkett was at that time clerk of a benefit society based at the Black Dog Inn in Church Street, Bethnal Green,See 'Black Dog, Church Street, 101 Bethnal Green Road' pubshistory.com. under management of Mr Stokes: Haffner, a member of the society, made Plunkett sole executor of his will (dividing his property between his three daughters), proved in June 1811.Will of Thomas Haffner of Spitalfield, Middlesex (P.C.C. 1811). Richard and Ann had four children, Richard James (1810), William (1812), Ann (1815) and Caroline (1817), all of whom were christened at St Mary's and survived infancy. Between 1812 and 1817 they were resident in Fieldgate Street, south of the Whitechapel Road.St Mary, Whitechapel, Register of Baptisms, Jun 1792-Dec 1812, P93/MRY1/012 and (1813-), P93/MRY1/013 (London Metropolitan Archives). In the same period his sister Mary had her own family. She married William Crowder, a stationer-bookbinder of Stepney, at Christ Church Spitalfields in May 1810,Christ Church, Spitalfields, Register of banns of marriage, P93/CTC1/041 (London Metropolitan Archives). and their first two daughters were christened from an address on London Wall. The next two, Elizabeth (1815) and Sarah (1817), were christened at St Mary Whitechapel as from Fieldgate Street;St Mary, Whitechapel, Register of Baptisms, P93/MRY1/013 (London Metropolitan Archives). later children were christened at the newly- rebuilt St Dunstan-in-the-East, as from Mile End Old Town, or from Ratcliff.St Dunstan and All Saints Stepney, Register of Baptisms (London Metropolitan Archives). All lived to be married.  Plunkett's early cases  1817 seems to mark the completion of Richard's family-making intentions for the time being, and his first appearance as 'constable of the night' at the Old Bailey relates to an incident just a month before his youngest daughter's christening. As he stood at the corner of Whitechapel church a 19-year-old man ran past an unemployed servant-girl and snatched the shawl (value 2 shillings) from her shoulders. Plunkett took him in charge, and the miscreant got 7 years' transportation.Old Bailey Online, Soloman Simpson, 17 September 1817. As keeper of the watch-house Plunkett received whatever prisoners the watchmen brought in, and a charge of grand larceny, with the same sentence, was successfully laid against Robert Miles the following April, when apprehended by two watchmen with a quantity of linen stolen from a carrier's wagon.Old Bailey Online, Robert Miles, 6 May 1818. A month later Plunkett made his own arrest of a carpenter's lad carrying home a plank of wood from his workplace at 3.30 a.m. Searching the house, Plunkett found two doors which he had also taken. Here a verdict of Not Guilty was returned, the master having made no complaint.Old Bailey Online, Daniel Hurley, 17 June 1818. But in September 1818, following the wholesale theft of provisions (casks of butter and honey and a sackful of hams) from a warehouse in Goodman's Fields (an area around Leman Street and Alie Street), Plunkett, having taken one of the thieves prisoner, got information and went to his residence, where he recovered the goods from the man's wife and mother.Old Bailey Online, Robert Wheelhouse, 9 September 1818. About the same time a 15-year-old boy who had stolen a tablecloth and 11 shillings in copper coins from his master, proprietor of an eating-house in Wentworth Street, was made by his father to give himself up to Plunkett. Both criminals were transported for 7 years.Old Bailey Online, Alexander Flemming, 9 September 1818. In a classic sting two years later, a young woman invited a printer of Coleman Street, who frequented Whitechapel, back to her house. When he had got into bed and put his pocket watch under the pillow, she extinguished the light and ran off, and two people came in and ordered him out of the house. Missing his watch the man made Plunkett arrest the girl, but nothing was found. In court Plunkett said he thought the complainant was drunk, and remarked that the man had accused him of stealing a pound from him when held in charge two nights previously for drunkenness. The girl was found Not Guilty.Old Bailey Online, Margaret Wall, 18 September 1820. By contrast, in November 1820, a man was invited in by a girl in George Yard, Wentworth Street: once he had paid her something to fetch gin, first the women and then the men of the house robbed his money and possessions and forcibly ejected him, padlocking the door. The man called an officer, who arrested one of the girls (aged 17). Further complaint was made to Plunkett, who (having been born in George Yard) knew the man responsible and arrested him. Both were transported for life.Old Bailey Online, Sarah Meyers and Emanuel Lyons, 6/15 December 1820.  A dangerous occupation  Soon afterwards, on 16 January 1821, Plunkett faced a personal challenge. Now living at No. 5 Baker's Row (on the north side of Whitechapel High Street, just east of the Workhouse: now Vallance RoadSee map detail, Whitechapel, in The Workhouse, the story of an institution website.), his two sons usually closed the outer shutters of the windows on their return from school, but were delayed. Soon after 5 pm, while taking tea in his back room, he heard a noise and found that two men had broken into his house via the front window, and were moving about in the dark. Discovered, one jumped onto a table and out through the upper part of the sash. The other followed, his gaiter slipping from Plunkett's grasp. But Plunkett jumped after him, caught him, and gave him into charge of George Brock, who was standing by.Old Bailey Online, William Haynes and William Harrison, 14 February 1821. He then chased the other, whom he recognised, up Baker's Row and round the corner into Church Street, where the man appeared nonchalantly in the doorway of a public house. A fight ensued, and Plunkett took him. The two were found guilty of burglary and sentenced to death, but a special verdict was returned pending a decision as to whether the window had been secured.Old Bailey Online, Supplementary material: Haynes & Harrison, 12 September 1821. (This case established that the pulling down of the sash of a window, though unfastened, constituted a breaking within the definition of \\"breaking and entering\\".'Rex v. William Haines and William Harrison', W.O. Russell and E. Ryan, Crown Cases Reserved for Consideration: and Decided by the Twelve Judges of England from the Year 1799 to the Year 1824 (Joseph Butterworth and Son, London 1825), pp. 451-52. (Google)) William Haynes and William Harrison were transported for life on the second convict voyage of the Asia on 1 April 1822.Transported convicts ‚Äì 258, Old British News website. Mary Crowder, Plunkett's sister, also found herself in the Old Bailey in the winter of 1820‚Äì21. She was still living at Greenfield Street, and in mid- February her lodger, who had been with her since mid-December, disappeared owing her 24 shillings. Some spoons and a pair of ear-rings went missing at the same time. She had not threatened to arrest him for the money owing: the apparent theft came to court, but was not proved against the defendant.Old Bailey Online, Hertzig Brandham, 11 April 1821. In June 1821 Plunkett testified in two cases of pocket-picking, one of which had taken him back to George Yard.Old Bailey Online, 6 June 1821: Robert Lloyd; Henry Copas. In September two women who had accosted a man walking home at 2 a.m. and had taken 27 shillings from him were sentenced to transportation for life.Old Bailey Online, Catherine Sullivan and Catherine Bryan, 12 September 1821. A year later Plunkett and his colleague John Clark went after two women known to them who were accused of stealing a coat and 35 sovereigns from a retired excise-officer in the street, but although the coat was found the court had doubt of their guilt.Old Bailey Online, Hannah Stanton and Esther Cummins, 11 September 1822. On the same day he gave evidence in a case of street robbery (classed as highway robbery with violence, though the work of a footpad) which led to a death sentence.Old Bailey Online, Samuel Greenwood, 11 September 1822. Between December 1822 (when on one occasion he held an identification paradeOld Bailey Online, Edmund Law and Thomas Webb, 15 January 1823.) and February 1825 Plunkett testified in nine other serious cases, mostly resulting in transportation.Old Bailey Online, Philip Redman, 4 December 1822; John Archer and Ann Bradshaw, 4 December 1822; Daniel Griffiths, 19 February 1823; Mary Smith, 9 April 1823; Charles Wasen, 9 April 1823 (see also 12 September 1821); John Andrews, 15 July 1824; William Sparks, 16 September 1824; Thomas Scott, 17 February 1825.  His last cases, and retirement  It happened that near to his house in Baker's Row stood the premises of Messrs. Brocks Fireworks factory. On 4 September 1825 two boys were engaged in ramming gunpowder into squibs when a spark ignited and the boys ran out in fright, throwing the firework aside. Fifty pounds of gunpowder and a large amount of saltpetre suddenly exploded, blowing the roof off, setting fire to the building, and smashing every pane of glass in most of the adjoining streets. \\"Females were frightened into hysterics\\" (runs the report), but the only serious injury was to Richard Plunkett's sister.'Dreadful Explosion', Leigh Hunt (ed.), The Examiner 1825 (John Hunt, London), p. 566. (Google) In November 1825 a respectable lady, Mrs Byrne, stopped at a house in Leman Street and remonstrated with the owner, an undertaker, who was beating his wife. The man then produced a constable's baton and had Mrs Byrne sent to the watch-house as a common prostitute. Plunkett kept her there for two hours among some rough company, and was about to lock her in a cell when her husband and brother arrived to rescue her. She was vindicated in court, severe criticism was levelled against the watch-houses, and the wife-beating constable was arrested and charged.'Police ‚Äì Lambeth Street', The Examiner 1825 (John Hunt, London), p. 747. (Google) In the same week a respectable- looking young man was found lying drunk on Whitechapel Road. The watchman took him to the watch-house to sleep it off, but when Plunkett looked in on him at about 4 a.m. he found him weltering in blood, having stabbed himself in the neck with a penknife. With immediate attention he was able to explain that he wished to end his life, and when further recovered was sent home in a cab under medical supervision.'Accidents, Offences, &c.;  Attempted Suicide', The Examiner 1825 (John Hunt, London), p. 748. (Google) These events doubtless contributed to Plunkett's retirement as beadle, and the evidence he gave leading to two further convictions in 1826 are his last recorded in the Proceedings of the Old Bailey.Old Bailey Online, William Weir, 6 April 1826; John Peachey, 22 June 1826.

Originally oriented towards the treatment of children, the hospital treated military veterans during and after World War II, but closed in 1955 due to a declining need for tuberculosis hospitals. Afterwards, it operated as the Neponsit Home for the Aged, later the Neponsit Health Care Center, a city-run nursing home until its controversial closure in 1998. Description The three buildings of the hospital (far left) adjacent to the Neponsit community Neponsit Beach Hospital is located on the south side of Rockaway Beach Boulevard just west of 149th Street (originally Mohawk Street), with Rockaway Beach at its southern edge. The hospital sits at the southeast corner of the Jacob Riis Park property, adjacent to the residential portion of Neponsit. It currently occupies a site. The grounds were originally in size, extending west to the end of the roundabout in front of the park, and including the beaches on the coast of Neponsit Bays 1 and 2. The hospital consists of three buildings, two of which front the beach. The original building, built in 1915, was designed by the McKim, Mead & White firm. It is four stories high with a red-brick outer facade. It is designed in a \\"U\\" shape, with eastern and western wings opening towards the beach. Open-aired balconies and enclosed porches were located on the building facing the beach. It was built with a 122-patient capacity. Renovations were made to the building in 1938 and 1958. Adjacent to the original building is the nurses' residence completed in 1941. It is the easternmost of the two buildings. It was designed by Dodge & Morrison architects, and built as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project. It is also four stories tall. Fronting Rockaway Beach Boulevard is the hospital's power plant, built at the same time as the nurses' home. The building also contains the hospital's laundry facilities, a men's dormitory, and an administrative center. A fourth building, a parking garage later converted into an office, no longer exists. The hospital's location on the sea provided patients with exposure to sunlight and beach recreation. The hospital originally contained two sets of murals, commissioned by the Works Progress Administration in 1938. The first set of murals called \\"The Circus\\" were painted by Louis Schanker and located on the four walls of the dining room. They consisted of eleven panels depicting clowns and other circus characters. The second series of murals, called \\"Children at Work and Play\\", were created by Helen West Heller. The 23 panels portray children taking part in games and activities, and include disabled children. Both artists utilized tempera painting.https://livingnewdeal.org/projects/neponsit- beach-childrens-hospital-murals-missing-far-rockaway-ny/ The Neponsit Hospital is currently unused and in disrepair. As of 2014, $266,000 is spent annually by NYC Health + Hospitals for maintenance and security of the property. The beach directly in front of the hospital (Neponsit Bay 1), now part of Riis Park, is popular among the gay community as well as nudists. A fence, which had originally been erected to separate the hospital from the park, later isolated this section from the rest of the beach until it was taken down by Hurricane Irene in 2011. A second fence just west of Beach 149th Street separates Bay 1 from the Neponsit portion of Rockaway Beach. Transportation The and local buses directly serve the hospital on Rockaway Beach Boulevard. The Q22 runs east-to-west across the Rockaway Peninsula. The Q35 travels between Rockaway Park and Brooklyn. The express route to Manhattan also operates on Rockaway Beach Boulevard. The closest New York City Subway station is the Rockaway Park‚ÄìBeach 116th Street station on the IND Rockaway Line east of the hospital, connected by the Q22 and Q35. History spinal tuberculosis used as part of the campaign to raise money for the hospital90px Development Around the turn of the 20th century, social journalist Jacob Riis (the namesake for the future Jacob Riis Park) advocated for a children's hospital to be built in the Rockaways, in order treat the increasing cases of tuberculosis in the city. In 1904, the city planned to build an oceanside park in the western Rockaways, supported by Riis' Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor. The Association as well as New York City Mayor George B. McClellan Jr. also lobbied for a hospital and \\"convalescent home\\" to be established. On May 15, 1906, an act was passed in the New York State Legislature allowing for the purchase of beach property in or outside of the city for a maximum of $2.5 million. The act also allowed a portion of the property to be leased for the creation of hospitals. On March 15, 1907, the New York City Board of Estimate accepted $250,000 from the Association to construct a hospital for people with \\"non- pulmonary tuberculosis\\". Efforts to develop the park (then called Seaside Park) and the hospital were suspended on November 1, 1907, due to the panic of 1907, but resurrected in 1909. The agreement between the Association and the Board of Estimate was renewed in 1912. The land for what would become Riis Park, extending east-to-west, was sold to the city in 1913 by the Neponsit Realty Company, which was developing the Neponsit neighborhood. The site for the hospital was then transferred from the New York City Parks Department on April 24, 1913. The hospital was funded by private sources and built by the Association, before being turned over to the city. The money had been raised by the Association by 1906 and held in a trust. As part of their campaign, the Association distributed pictures of a boy suffering spinal tuberculosis at Sea Breeze Hospital in Coney Island, Brooklyn, who was strapped to a board as part of his treatment. This boy was later called \\"Smiling Joe\\". The pictures were included in letters sent out by the Association, as well as in newspapers and magazines across the country. \\"Smiling Joe\\" also received visits from then- President Theodore Roosevelt and John D. Rockefeller. Rockefeller would pledge $125,000 to the project. Construction on the hospital began on January 28, 1914. It was provisionally known as Seaside Hospital. The hospital, which cost $250,000 to construct, was completed by March 1, 1915, and relinquished to the city the next day. Early history Artist Louis Schanker with one of his murals within Neponsit Hospital in 1939 Neponsit Beach Hospital for Children opened on April 16, 1915. Neponsit Hospital was operated by the Bellevue and Allied Hospitals organization, a city agency which also operated Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. It replaced Sea Breeze Hospital, also operated by the Association, with children from Sea Breeze transferred to Neponsit. Upon opening, the hospital was subject to odors and fumes from waste disposal operations on nearby Barren Island (now Floyd Bennett Field). In the 1930s and early 1940s, the hospital was expanded as a Works Progress Administration (WPA) project, adding the nurses' residence and power plant. The expansion was first announced in November 1929 by city hospitals commissioner Dr. William Schroeder, Jr. The project was intended to double the patient capacity of the facility. In June 1931, an appropriation of $300,000 was made by the Board of Estimate for the nurses' home. In December 1933, the city applied for a loan to fund the project. Sketches for the murals were approved as part of the Federal Art Project in October 1935. The first contract was awarded in December 1935, for the power plant. The contract for the nurses' residence was awarded in 1938. In addition, the WPA planned to plant 800 trees and create gardens on the grounds of the hospital, and add a high, sea wall. The power plant was completed in 1939, and work on the nurses' residence began shortly afterwards. The nurses' residence was completed in February 1941. The hospital was closed temporarily on January 7, 1943 to conserve fuel during World War II. Also during the war, the fence separating Riis Park from the hospital grounds was erected. The hospital was reopened on March 1, 1945, after the United States Public Health Service began leasing it to treat servicemen with tuberculosis. Following the war, the Public Health Service continued to use the hospital for veterans of the war. After short extensions of the lease, it was returned to the city in 1950. Closure of hospital and conversion into nursing home Neponsit Beach Hospital returned to city operations in summer 1950 following minor renovations, and was now associated with Queens General Hospital in Jamaica. In July 1950 Neponsit Beach Hospital began operating as an annex of Triboro Hospital for Tuberculosis (adjacent to Queens General), with 24 patients transferred from Triboro to Neponsit. On June 19, 1952, Queens Hospital Center was formed with the merger of the adjacent Queens General and Triboro Hospitals. Neponsit Beach Hospital, the College Point Outpatient Department, and the Ozone Park ambulance station were also absorbed into the new medical center. Around this time, the city planned to renovate and expand Neponsit Hospital so it could be used in a general hospital capacity in the event of an emergency. Plans were drawn up by the York and Sawyer firm in 1952. In July 1953, the Board of Estimate approved fireproofing and electrical work for the hospital, including fire stairs to replace the original wooden staircases. However, in January 1955 the city decided to close Neponsit Beach Hospital due to a declining need for tuberculosis treatment. The hospital was vacated on February 1, 1955, with patients transferred to Sea View Hospital or Triboro Hospital. It was officially closed on April 21, 1955. The planned $1 million addition to the complex was cancelled; the plans were approved in 1956 solely in order for the York and Sawyer firm to be compensated. Following the closure of the hospital, the site was considered a \\"hot property\\", located on the beach in the fairly exclusive Neponsit neighborhood. The site of the hospital was valued at $1 million. Numerous groups had conflicting interests in the future of the site. New York City Parks Commissioner Robert Moses desired to use the hospital land to expand the adjacent Jacob Riis Park. Moses planned to raze the hospital buildings in order to construct sports fields, a swimming pool, and a comfort station, and to extend the beach. Moses also pointed out the clause in the 1906 act which provided the land for the hospital, in which it must be returned to the Parks Department when no long used for a hospital. The U.S. Welfare Department proposed that the hospital be converted into a nursing home. Local businessmen such as the Rockaway Park Businessmen's Association, supported by the Rockaways' Chamber of Commerce, desired to build homes on the property. New York City Comptroller Lawrence E. Gerosa desired for the property to be turned over to a private owner, in order to get it \\"back on the tax rolls\\". Gerosa may have been influenced by the Rockaway developers, an assertion put forth by Moses. Local residents, meanwhile, wanted the facility reopened as a general hospital, as an annex or relocation of Rockaway Beach Hospital, or converted into a school. These residents were opposed to the Riis Park plans, in part out of fear that extending the park would lead Riis Park visitors to \\"invade\\" the adjacent beaches in Neponsit. Two baseball diamonds (pictured) were built on the former Neponsit Beach Hospital land ceded back to Riis Park in 1959. On June 29, 1955, the New York City Planning Commission unanimously approved Moses' plans to extend Riis Park. On July 21, 1955, however, the Board of Estimate voted 10‚Äì6 to block Moses' park plans. Those opposed included the five borough presidents, as well as Gerosa who cast multiple votes. The two members in favor of park expansion were Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. and city councilman Abe Stark, who each cast three votes. This led to a back-and-forth exchange of letters between Moses and Gerosa. After a lawsuit by the Park Association of New York City, on October 14, 1955 New York Attorney General Jacob K. Javits stated in an advisory ruling that the city did not have the jurisdiction to sell the hospital as it was still parkland. The ruling had been requested by Moses. On October 27, New York Supreme Court Justice Peter M. Daly ruled in favor of the Park Association, preventing the sale. The ruling was upheld by the Appellate Court in Brooklyn on July 9, 1956. On October 15, 1958, a compromise plan was proposed by councilman Stark and Mayor Wagner. The plan entailed the conversion of the hospital into the nursing home proposed by the Welfare Department. The surrounding undeveloped land would be absorbed into Jacob Riis Park. The plan was approved by New York City Board of Estimate in February 1959. Renovations were made to the main building and the nurses' residence. The Neponsit Home for the Aged was dedicated and opened August 31, 1961. Among those in attendance was city councilman Stark, who urged the construction of more facilities like the Neponsit Home, due to the increasing elderly population in the city. This included the conversion of the former Manhattan Beach Hospital (now the site of Kingsborough Community College) in Brooklyn into a nursing home. Costing $2.4 million, the Neponsit Home was the first municipally-operated geriatric facility in the city. Meanwhile, of the property were turned over to the Parks Department to expand Riis Park, adding of beach. Later use and final closure In July 1985 under Mayor Ed Koch, the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation (HHC), which operates city-owned health facilities, planned to transfer 10 patients diagnosed with HIV/AIDS from Bellevue Hospital to an isolated wing of the Neponsit Home. The plan received opposition from the local community, due to fears about the transmission of the disease at the time. On July 31, a Queens judge blocked the move. Koch proceeded to drop the plans on September 3. Between September 10 and 12, 1998, the nursing home was evacuated and closed after bricks fell from the roof of the building due to damage from the Labor Day storm of that year. Residents of the home were forced to leave the facility in the middle of the night. Patients were transferred to Bellevue Hospital in Lower Manhattan, and the Coler and Goldwater Hospitals on Roosevelt Island. City officials under Mayor Rudy Giuliani stated that the buildings were in danger of collapsing, and that renovations were required to make the facility structurally sound. An estimate made by an engineering firm on June 19, 1998 stated it would take $1 million to renovate the facility; following the closure, that figure rose to $50 million. After closing the home, the city initially planned to sell the site, to \\"get it back on the tax rolls\\" according to deputy mayor Joe Lhota. The site was worth an estimated $15 to $20 million. By late October, however, Lhota stated that the sale of the site was blocked by the deed restrictions on the property, based on the 1955 court ruling which prevented the sale of the hospital at that time. Meanwhile, accusations were made against Giuliani of using new tactics to justify closing health facilities, after attempts to privatize Coney Island Hospital, Elmhurst Hospital Center, and Queens Hospital Center. There were also rumors of a plan to develop a hotel on the site. After the plans to sell the site fell through, Giuliani and the city decided to demolish the hospital and develop a waterfront park on the site. The plan was announced October 28, 1998 by Giuliani and the HHC. It was opposed by the local community. On October 30, 1998, District Court Judge Deborah Batts blocked the demolition of the buildings. On November 2, 1998, the federal government released a report on the relocation, finding that the Health and Hospitals Corporation endangered the lives of the 300 residents, and deceived them about plans to later return to the Neponsit Home. It also found that the hasty evacuation was unnecessary. Based on the report, the Health Care Financing Administration fined the HHC $3,050 per day for every day the former residents remained in sub-par housing, totaling $450,000. In December 1998, a portion of the complex, the Neponsit Adult Day Health Care which provided outpatient physical therapy, was relocated to the gymnasium of the Young Israel of Far Rockaway synagogue in Far Rockaway. A second court ruling on October 29, 1999, stated that the HHC overextended its authority when evacuating the facility, and blocked demolition. Despite this, the Giuliani administration continued to try and demolitish the building. In March 2000, a structural evaluation was conducted by the New York City Council, finding the three Neponsit buildings to be in good condition, with repairs estimated at $600,000. Neponsit Adult Day Health Care, formerly located in the nursing home, was moved to the Sands Point Professional Building (pictured) in 2004. Following a lawsuit over the closure of the facility by former residents and the Legal Aid Society, on June 2, 2003 under the administration of Michael Bloomberg, the HHC agreed to pay $5 million out of court, with $18,000 going to each patient or their estate if they had passed away. In addition, the city must give notice in the future if it intends to transfer 100 or more nursing home patients. Redevelopment or use of the site, meanwhile, was limited due to its deed restrictions. On March 9, 2004, the Neponsit Adult Day Health Care moved to a permanent location in the Sands Point Professional Building at Beach 102nd Street in nearby Rockaway Park. In 2006, the HHC considered plans to turn over facility to the city, and develop luxury homes on the site. These plans were opposed by local residents and politicians. Alternate plans from the community called for a veteran's rehabilitation center, or a children's hospital. Local politician Lew Simon, in opposition to the city plans, stated it would take \\"seven years\\" to rezone the land for other purposes. None of these plans came to fruition. In 2008, the HHC spent $1 million in order to cleanup debris on the property, and repair fences and windows. At this time, the site was appraised at $40 million.

Trenten moved to Hopewell Junction, NY, where he attended Arlington High School in LaGrangeville. Through the first 2 years of high school, Trenten played baseball earning a spot on the Varsity team because of his batting skills along with his speed in Centerfield. At the urging of his teammates, Trenten joined the indoor track team in his Junior year to help keep in shape for Baseball. Once there, his true abilities surfaced. Within one year, Trenten was able to beat numerous records at the amateur level as well as earn the status of All American at the National Junior Olympics.http://www.poughkeepsiejournal.com/story/sports/2014/07/26/track-and- field/13212007/?cookies=&from;=global In 2014 (his senior year of high school), Trenten was discovered by a talent scout in Manila and then contacted by the Philippine Amateur Track and Field Association (PATAFA), the national sports association for athletics in the Philippines. He was advised to join its athletics National Team, which would first require him to have dual citizenship. After months of reflection, Beram decided to run under the Philippine flag, driven by his interest on his mother's country. He began the process in November 2015, officially gaining Filipino citizenship seven months later. During this period, Trenten began his academic studies at the University of Connecticut as a math major. While actively contributing to the University's track success, he managed to hold a GPA close to 3.9, with nearly perfect scores.

As a gay man, he chose to leave England, where the Labouchere Amendment made life difficult. He settled in Sicily, where he built a villa in Taormina, Casa Cuseni, that is now a historic house museum.  Biography   Early years  Robert Hawthorn Kitson was born into a wealthy family, the eldest son of John Hawthorn Kitson and Jessie Ellershaw. His grandfather James Kitson founded locomotive engineering firm Kitson and Company. His uncle was James Kitson, 1st Baron Airedale. His sister was the first female Lord Mayor of Leeds, Jessie Kitson. He studied at Shrewsbury School and then went to Trinity College, Cambridge to study Natural Sciences in 1895. The following year, Kitson was chosen to receive a Harkness Scholarship and mostly concentrated on geological studies. At Cambridge he befriended the painter Cecil Arthur Hunt. Kitson suffered from rheumatic fever and was advised to spend the winters out of England, in a sunnier climate. Kitson became an artist, learning watercolour painting on sketching tours with Sir Alfred East and Sir Frank Brangwyn. From 1900 he was an active member of the Leeds Fine Arts Club.  Life in Sicily Kitson in 1911 The Hassan Tower, Rabat by Kitson (c. 1910) After his father's death in 1899, Kitson moved to Sicily where he designed and built Casa Cuseni, a villa with views of Mount Etna. Before permanently settling in Taormina, Kitson spent a lot of time in Venice, where he had his own regular gondolier. He also visited Naples and Ravello with his family and friends from Cambridge. His selection of Taormina as a place to settle was due to it being on the rise as a popular winter resort for European aristocracy. Kitson was also familiar with Wilhelm von Gloeden's works made in Taormina and owned von Gloeden's small collection of photographs of ephebes and heads of handsome Arab youths. Kitson also had a long friendship with Bobbie Pratt-Barlow, a distant relative who settled in the Villa Rosa just below Casa Cuseni. Kitson travelled extensively around Europe by train and took long voyages to North Africa, Egypt, Istanbul and, once, to Ceylon and India. Kitson was one of von Gloeden's studio clients; he and his visitors took their films to be developed and printed at von Gloeden's studio. Frank Brangwyn writes in his letters that Kitson and von Gloeden were good friends before the First World War. One of Kitson's sketchbooks has a large group of sketches of young men, clothed as if Arabs and taken after von Gloeden's models. Von Gloeden photographed Kitson's Taorminese lover, Carlo Siligato, making portraits and nudes. People in Taormina called Kitson the \\"crazy Englishman\\" for his appearance. He was tall and thin with blue eyes and a moustache and dressed with flamboyance in his colourful jackets. Kitson lived at Casa Cuseni until he was forced to leave Italy and come back to England when World War II reached Italy and Sicily became a battleground. After World War II When Sicily fell, Kitson was regularly communicating with his friends left there. He had given the Allies information on Sicily and tried, without success, to save the ancient bridge over the Alcantara river from destruction. He was happy to find out that Casa Cuseni survived the War and this spurred on his attempts to get back to Sicily. The Mayor of Taormina requested to the British authorities that Kitson return to be president of the local building commission. His presence was regarded as essential to the reconstruction of the town, since it was essentially in ruins following the bombardment of 9 July 1943. Kitson returned to Sicily by the end of January 1946. In summer 1947, Kitson returned to his pre-war custom of spending part of the summer with family and friends in England. He flew back to Italy early in September, stopping in Rome. He returned to Taormina on 15 September 1947 and died at Casa Cuseni two days later, on 17 September 1947. Kitson was buried in the non-Catholic cemetery in Taormina in the presence of his Sicilian friends, some English expatriates and the Deputy British Consul in Sicily. Carlo Siligato by Vincenzo Galdi. Siligato is holding a painting of himself by Frank Brangwyn Carlo Siligato by Vincenzo Galdi  Personal life  Kitson realised he was homosexual at an early age. He was able to live relatively freely, if not openly, in Taormina, surrounded by a community of artists and aristocrats. Charles Leslie writes that Kitson had a brief romantic relationship with Frank Brangwyn, whom he later employed for decoration of his Taorminese villa. In Taormina, his long-time companion was the handsome Sicilian Carlo Siligato. A series of photographs of Siligato by Vincenzo Galdi survives. Casa Cuseni When Kitson first went to Taormina in 1898, he decided to build a house there, 800 feet above the sea. There he constructed his villa, Casa Cuseni, in the classical style, using local stones, marble, wood and terracotta. Kitson commissioned his friend Frank Brangwyn to create the dining room, for which Brangwyn designed the furniture and painted frescos. When Kitson died in 1947, the villa was inherited by his niece Daphne Phelps, who maintained and ran it till her death in 2005. Phelps wrote a memoir entitled A House in Sicily in 1999. Casa Cuseni has been declared an Italian National Monument and now hosts a museum of fine art and a small hotel.  Exhibitions  Kitson regularly exhibited his work at the Royal Society of British Artists, at the 1925 International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts and had solo exhibitions at the Fine Art Society and in the Redfern Gallery. Kitson's first major exhibition was in Rome in 1919 with a group of foreign artists resident in Italy. He exhibited 19 watercolours of Sicily and Kairouan. In October 1925 his solo show at the Fine Art Society included 57 works.  Collections  Kitson's works are exhibited at the Victoria and Albert Museum, Leeds University Library, and the Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art. The most important collection of his watercolours is now at the Museum of Fine Arts of Taormina at Casa Cuseni.
