In the early 19th century, most jumping spiders were grouped together as a single genus under the name Attus. The genus was originally described in 1805 by Charles Walckenaer, only a year after Pierre Latreille described the first jumping spider genus (or subgenus), Salticus. Walckenaer, ignoring Latreille, placed all of the spiders assigned to Salticus into his new genus, Attus, with the exception of Aranea cinnaberinus, which he placed into Eresus. No further actions were taken regarding these genera until 1810, when Latreille moved Attus scenicus back to Salticus by declaring it as the type species for the genus. Over the course of the 19th century, numerous new genera were split off of Attus, reducing the number of species assigned to the genus considerably. In 1832, Nicholas Marcellus Hentz detached the genera Lyssomanes, Synemosyna, and Epiblemum from Attus. In 1833, Carl Sundevall moved numerous species from Attus to Salticus. From 1833 to 1850, Carl Ludwig Koch created 24 new jumping spider genera, most of which were detached from Attus. Due to the genus's unclear definition, it was often used as a provisional classification for any jumping spiders that could not otherwise be assigned to a genus. In 1955, Pierre Bonnet declared Attus to be a junior synonym of Salticus, since Walkenaer did not differentiate Attus from Salticus and the latter has priority as an older name.

Description Oenothera deltoides subsp. howellii is a short-lived perennial plant with thick stems varying from 4 to 40 inches in length. It is multi-branching in form and tends to grow in large tufts. The grayish colored leaves are shaped like a lance and are about 1 to 5 inches long with many hairs, primarily short with only a few being longer. Its flowers are white with inch-long petals and yellow stamens. It blooms from March to September. The subspecies is often confused with Oenothera deltoides ssp. cognata that grows in an area southeast of the protected area. The Antioch Dunes Evening Primrose blooms for only one night. The flowers are a major host plant for a rare species of sweat bee, Sphecodogastra antiochensis. Distribution and habitat Oenothera deltoides subsp. howellii is a perennial plant that grows only in an environmentally sensitive sand dune habitat located near the meeting of the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River in California. In 1979 Oenothera deltoides subsp. howellii, the Antioch Dunes Evening Primrose, was declared an endangered species. Currently, its habitat is restricted to the Antioch Dunes National Wildlife Refuge, the last remnant of an isolated nine kilometer stretch of sand dune habitat. The refuge was formed in 1980 to prevent extinction of this plant, as well as Lange's metalmark butterfly (Apodemia mormo langei) and the Contra Costa wallflower (Erysimum capitatum var. angustatum). This refuge is the first national wildlife refuge in the U.S. formed to protect endangered plants and insects, and it is open for viewing to the public only under supervision because of the sensitive status of these species. Endangered status In 2007 a five-year review of its endangered status was completed, and its status was continued unchanged.

He was the son (by the second marriage) of the third Belzer Rebbe, Rebbe Yissachar Dov Rokeach. His only son, Yissachar Dov Rokeach, is the fifth and current Belzer Rebbe. From 1927 until the outbreak of World War II, Rabbi Mordechai served as Rav of the town of Biłgoraj, becoming known as the Bilgorayer Rav. During World War II, he famously accompanied his brother, Rebbe Aharon, on a daring escape out of Nazi-occupied Europe. The two reached Israel in February 1944, the only surviving members of their families, and threw themselves into rebuilding the ranks of Belzer Hasidut which had been decimated by the Holocaust. Biography Rabbi Mordechai was one of seven children born to Rebbe Yissachar Dov Rokeach, the third Belzer Rebbe, in his second marriage to Chaya Devorah, daughter of Rabbi Avrohom Shmuel Pecsenik of Berezna. From his first wife, the Belzer Rebbe fathered two children, Aharon and Chana Rochel. Aharon was 22 years old at the time of Mordechai's birth. Rebbe Yissachar Dov closely supervised Mordechai's Torah education, learning with him for three hours nightly.Landesman, Yeruchem. \\"The Younger Brother\\". Mishpacha, 15 November 2006, pp. 24-27. Reb Mottele, as he was popularly called, became known for his diligence in Torah study, his breadth of knowledge and his skills as an orator. He got along well with people, a trait that would serve him later on as a town Rav and as a spokesman for Belz Hasidut in Israel. He was also quite humble.Israel, Yosef (2005). \\"Rescuing the Rebbe of Belz\\". NY:Mesorah Publications, Ltd. . He married Sheva, the daughter of Rabbi Moshe Aharon Rabinowitz, the Kobriner Rav. His eldest daughter, Alte Bas Zion, died in 1931 at the age of 3; his second daughter, Rivka Miriam, was murdered by the Nazis together with his wife in Kobrin after he had fled with the Rebbe. In 1920, he accepted the position of Rav of Biłgoraj. Though his father gave his blessing, Rabbi Mordechai did not assume this post until after his father's death in 1926; at that time, his brother Aharon, the newly appointed Rebbe, gave his blessing to the move. In Biłgoraj, Rabbi Mordechai served as the spiritual leader, educator and av beit din. He conducted tishen on Shabbat and Yom Tov, at which he delivered divrei Torah in the style of the Belzer Rebbes. He also accepted and from people seeking his blessing and prayers. He established a Talmud Torah in the city and provided for the spiritual and physical needs of the students. A photograph taken for a philanthropist in the United States who had sent a donation of new clothing for the children shows him surrounded by his students. Notwithstanding his prominence, Rabbi Mordechai always subordinated himself to his brother, Aharon. He consulted with him on every issue, attended his court on Shabbat, and even gave him kvitlach with the names of his family members. He used to say, \\"When I want to enter my brother's room, I am overcome by fear, knowing who it is I am going to see. I try to turn back, due to my great fear. But one must go in!\\" Escape from Europe With the outbreak of World War II and the German invasion of Poland, town of Biłgoraj was bombed from the air and most of its residents fled. Rabbi Mordechai and his family followed the refugees to Poritsc, several kilometers north of Sokal, and then to Berezhany. Meanwhile, Belzer Hasidim in Israel, England and the United States arranged to spirit the Rebbe out of Belz to Sokal and then to Przemyslany, where he remained for nearly a year. With the onset of Operation Barbarossa on 22 June 1941, Sokal, on the front lines, fell to the Germans on the first day; Prezemyslany was conquered by July 1. The Rebbe went into hiding and narrowly avoided capture by German patrols, but he would not escape further without his brother at his side. Rabbi Mordechai sent his wife and daughter to her father's house in Kobrin, while Rebbe Aharon's wife and five unmarried children stayed in Przemyslany under the care of one of his Hasidim. They were all subsequently murdered by the Nazis. Thanks to the untiring efforts and cash inflow from Belzer Hasidim abroad, the Rebbe and Rabbi Mordechai managed to stay one step ahead of the Nazis in one miraculous escape attempt after another. Together with two Hasidim, they were spirited into Wiśnicz, then the Bochnia Ghetto, then the Kraków Ghetto, and then back into Bochnia, narrowly avoiding Gestapo roundups and deportations. In their most hair-raising escape attempt, the brothers were driven out of occupied Poland and into Hungary by a Hungarian counter-intelligence agent who was friendly to Jews. The Rebbe, his attendant and Rabbi Mordechai, shorn of their distinctive beards and sidelocks, were disguised as Russian generals who had been captured at the front and were being taken to Budapest for questioning. Rebbe Aharon and Rabbi Mordechai spent eight months in Budapest before receiving highly rationed Jewish Agency certificates to enter Israel. Their decision to leave Europe was protested by the Hungarian Jewish community, which desired their continuing presence, but when they finalized their plans, the community made them guests of honor at a farewell evening attended by thousands. Rabbi Mordechai delivered a lengthy speech combining Torah thoughts with commentary on the political situation, exhorting his audience to use their charity money to ransom Jews trapped in German-occupied Europe and also to feed and clothe those who had managed to escape to then-free Hungary. In January 1944 the two boarded the Orient Express to Istanbul. After crossing the Bosphorus straits by ferry, they were subject to a vigorous search and debriefing by the British secret service as \\"aliens\\" from Nazi-occupied territory. The Rebbe, who generally weighed each question before answering it, exasperated the interrogator, who ordered the Rebbe and his brother arrested and held in the basement of the Syrian police house, together with another fifteen Jewish fugitives from Nazi Europe. Israel Chief Rabbi Chaim Herzog, who had planned to be in Turkey with a mission of rescue activists so he could greet the Rebbe upon his arrival, interceded with the British general, who agreed to release the weak and fragile Rebbe. Rabbi Mordechai was released later that evening, and the pair took the first train to Tripoli the next morning. On the outskirts of Beirut, they were greeted by a crowd of 200 Sephardim and 20 Israeli businessmen and hosted to a reception by local rabbis and dignitaries. They arrived at the old border station near Naqoura, Lebanon, on 3 February 1944 (9 Shevat 5704 – a date celebrated by Belzer Hasidim). Upon crossing the border into Israel, the Rebbe tore . Thousands came out to greet them at each of their stops in Haifa, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. They were also given positive newspaper coverage by religious and secular papers alike. In Israel Rabbi Mordechai continued to serve as his brother's right hand after the war, refusing to take a rabbinical position but dedicating his efforts to strengthening Torah Judaism and Belzer Hasidut. He chaired the Rebbe's planning committee for the first Belz Talmud Torah in Tel Aviv and yeshiva in Jerusalem, and represented the Rebbe at most events and conferences. The Rebbe consulted with him before every major decision. He also acceded to the Rebbe's request to live near him in Tel Aviv, even after he remarried, as the Rebbe explained, \\"Heaven forbid that he leave me! For he is my right hand, and it is impossible that I be left without him!\\" With the war in Europe still raging, Rabbi Mordechai gave many speeches and newspaper interviews to publicize the full scope of the Nazis' murderous activities and arouse public opinion. At a routine foundation-stone laying for a new aron kodesh at Haifa's central beth midrash, for example, he spoke passionately and at length about the Holocaust: As Israeli public opinion warmed to the horrors in Europe, the Belzer Rebbe called on the Gerrer Rebbe, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter, to join him in proclaiming a World Fast and Day of Prayer on 23 March 1944 (28 Adar). The event, coming on the heels of the German invasion of Hungary, was attended by thousands. Rabbi Mordechai spoke for a full 90 minutes. He was also heavily involved in helping war survivors obtain government benefits, housing and employment, and arranging weddings on their behalf. Remarriage Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, fifth Belzer rebbe Having lost their entire families in the Holocaust, both Rebbe Aharon and Rabbi Mordechai remarried in Israel. Rabbi Mordechai remarried in 1947 to Miriam, the daughter of Rabbi Tzvi (Hershel) Glick of Satmar.Cohen, Yitzchok. \\"Glimpses of Greatness: My Brother-in-Law, the Bilgorayer Rav\\". Hamodia Features, 12 November 2009, pp. C4-5. Their only child, Yissachar Dov, was born on 19 January 1948.Landesman, Yerucham. \\"Born to Lead: How did the Belzer Rebbe breathe new life into a shattered Chassidus?\\" Mishpacha, 10 October 2011, pp. 30–51. Rebbe Aharon also remarried in 1947, but his second marriage did not produce children. Belz historian Rabbi Mordechai served as a link between the Belz community of old and the new community that his brother was establishing in Israel through his recording of every custom and practice that he had seen done in Belz. He was originally commissioned to write down these notes by his father, the third Belzer Rebbe. In the early years in Israel, Rebbe Aharon urged him to continue. At that time, paper was scarce, so Rabbi Mordechai recorded his memories on scraps of paper, envelopes and wedding invitations. These scraps were discovered in the home of his widow in late 2009, causing his son and current Rebbe, Rabbi Yissachar Dov, to change his levush (wardrobe) in the middle of Hanukkah. The Rebbe appeared in the Belzer shul wearing a spodik instead of the usual kolpik, as his father's papers had revealed that Belzer Rebbes wore the kolpik for traveling and the spodik at home, not the other way around (as had been done in the Rebbe's court until then).Inner Circle in History: In the court of the Rebbe. Mishpacha, 23 December 2009, p. 16. Final days In the summer of 1949, Rebbe Aharon sent his brother on a mission to strengthen and encourage survivors and the nascent Belzer communities in Europe. Rabbi Mordechai traveled to Paris, Zurich and Antwerp to convey the Rebbe's personal message. He impressed many with his Torah knowledge and powers of oration. He would often share divrei Torah that he had heard from his father, the previous Belzer Rebbe, and kept a notebook of all the divrei Torah he remembered. After his death, his rebbetzin wanted to keep the notebook for herself. One of his relatives sat in her house for an entire day to copy the whole notebook so that his brother, Rebbe Aharon, could also benefit from his father's divrei Torah. At the end of the summer, Rabbi Mordechai told his companions that his father had appeared to him in a dream and instructed him to return home immediately. He returned to Israel before Yom Kippur and fell ill during the Sukkot holiday. He underwent major surgery on 17 November but did not survive. He died on 17 November 1949 (25 Cheshvan 5710), and was buried in Tiberias in a funeral attended by thousands. His only son, Yissachar Dov, was raised by Rebbe Aharon. After Rebbe Aharon's death in 1957, the boy was educated by a small circle of trusted advisors. He became the fifth Belzer Rebbe in 1966. Rebbe Yissachar Dov named his only son, Aharon Mordechai Rokeach, born in 1975, after his uncle and his father.

Robert King was born in Phoenix, Arizona, and grew up in northwestern Indiana. He knew he wanted to be a writer since fourth grade: \\"I wanted to be a writer because of The Chronicles of Narnia (by C.S. Lewis). A teacher read one of them to us in third grade... I thought I'd check out the rest of the books. I loved them so much; they provided such an escape. I really wanted to be able to create that sort of escape for other people. They were the sort of fantasy that got me excited about writing.\\" King majored in Theology and the Humanities at Valparaiso University. He worked for two years as an editor for a non-fiction publisher, and then took an editing job at TSR. King worked on a number of products for the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game; his design work includes the Monstrous Compendium Forgotten Realms Appendix II (1991), the Book of Crypts (1991) for Ravenloft, Unsung Heroes (1992) and Tales of the Lance (1992) for Dragonlance, and Aurora's Whole Realms Catalog (1992) for Forgotten Realms. He wrote his first novel, Heart of Midnight, for the Ravenloft setting, soon after his hiring at TSR; other novels include Carnival of Fear for Ravenloft, Vinas Solamnus for Dragonlance, and the Planescape Blood Wars Trilogy: Blood Hostages, Abyssal Warriors, and Planar Powers. King treasures two of his earliest books, Rogues to Riches and Summerhill Hounds, both intended for younger readers: \\"They're two of my favorite books... but probably read the least. I think when we write for the older, mainstream audience we tend to make it gritty to convince people that these aren't fairy tales but \\"real\\" fantasy.

The thing about that book is its sense of experimentation and humor. In writing it, I decided I wanted to write a book backward, starting broad and ending very narrow, a complex thing that became more simple. The first book [in the series] is a tragedy, in which the character's flaw leads to his destruction. The second book is a passion play, in which the character is redeemed by the sacrifice of another, and the third book I wrote as a comedy, in which the flaws of the character lead to his salvation.\\" With the success of his writing (and with two young sons by the late 1990s), King left his editing position to write full-time. He wrote a number of novels for the Magic: the Gathering setting, including Time Streams and a trilogy of the Phyrexian Cycle. and the second book in the tie-in novel series for ArenaNet's Guild Wars 2, Edge of Destiny.

Joe Flacco unloaded a bomb to Jacoby Jones up on the right sideline. Moore was well-positioned to make an easy play on the ball but misjudged the trajectory and fell over, as the pass was completed Jones walked into the end zone for the game-tying touchdown. Baltimore would go on to win the game 38-35 in double overtime and eventually win Super Bowl XLVII.

The event took place at Spencer Street station from 15 to 29 October, and also included tours on Victorian rail lines involving the participating locomotives. History In early 1986, it was suggested at a Steamrail board meeting that something should be done to celebrate Australia's Bicentenary. Inspiration came from the Stockton & Darlington Railway 150th celebrations in England in 1975. Many ideas were canvassed, such as a visit by New South Wales locomotive 3801 and locomotives from other states. In 1987, Mallard was supposed to visit to Australia. But due to the impending 50th anniversary of the locomotive's 126 miles per hour speed record in 1938, the National Railway Museum declined to allow the locomotive to leave the United Kingdom. Flying Scotsman was suggested as an alternative. But funding had to be arranged. The owner of the Flying Scotsman, William McAlpine had his bank to do a credit search on Wal Stuchbery (the creator of Aus Steam '88) and his wife, to assess the soundness of the project. After satisfying himself that a repeat of Flying Scotsman's stranding in the United States in 1972 was not likely occur, McAlpine asked George Hinchcliffe, a former manager of the Flying Scotsman and a former director of Steamtown Railway Museum in Carnforth, where the locomotive was based, to help prepare it for the trip. Final agreement was reached when McAlpine met representatives of the Victorian Department of Transport, and the P&O; shipping agent, in Transport House in Yarraville. Although the Flying Scotsman was set to come to Australia, some problems were emerging. The New South Wales Bicentennial programme was taking its toll, with many locomotives failing and others not restored in time for the celebrations. Nevertheless, the stage was still being set for a spectacular event. Many steam locomotives from New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria were available. South Australia was to be part of the celebration but a number of steam locomotives were not able to be restored in time. However many of that state's vintage diesels were able to take part. The two unions involved in the project, the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen and the Australian Railways Union, were both very supportive of the committee. Delivery Runs On Friday 14 October 1988, the Rail Transport Museum's 4201 and the Canberra Railway Museum's 1210 left Goulburn with the first southbound tour train. It was to have included the Lachlan Valley Railway's 5367 but that engine failed with eccentric problems and was not able to make the journey. 3112 also failed on that day, but was able to meet up with 1210 later the next day. 4201 was substituting for the LVR's 4204 which failed motor traction problems. The train was split at Yass Junction. In the gathering dusk and rain, 1210 set off alone on the main line for Cootamundra, with a water gin and four end platform carriages, followed by the 42 class locomotive with the rest of the carriages. The locomotives were hauling a UK tour party train for the event. On Saturday 15 October 3112 met up with 1210 overnight and set off from Albury to Melbourne. A parallel run had been planned with the Victorian Railways J515 south of Seymour, but it had to be abandoned due to the standard gauge locomotive's late running. R761 left Melbourne that day to meet up with 3801, the Railways of Australia Bicentennial Train, for a parallel run to Melbourne. 3801 departed Sydney with the Bicentennial Train, assisted by 5910 from Campbelltown to Goulburn. On Sunday 16 October 3801 paralleled with R761 from Wodonga all the way to Melbourne. On the same day, the Flying Scotsman was unloaded at Sydney Harbour from the deck of the New Zealand Pacific and hauled to the Eveleigh Railway Workshops. On 17 October 4201 hauled the various carriages that had been left in Albury by 1210 and 3112 to Melbourne. Program of Activities On Tuesday 18 October 1988, two broad gauge trips between Melbourne and Geelong ran. On 19 October, Flying Scotsman left Sydney and, after making an overnight stop at Junee, it departed for Albury. While the locomotive was in Sydney, it made a trial run from Sydney to Port Kembla. During its run to Melbourne, it was welcomed by local residents at towns along the way. Many school children cheered the locomotive on. 3801 worked a return run from Melbourne to Seymour and R707 made an evening return run from Melbourne to Woodend. On Friday 21 October, Elecrail's Tait set worked to Belgrave to connect with a Puffing Billy Railway special to Lakeside, hauled by the newly restored Climax locomotive 1694, double heading with an NA class 2-6-2T as far as Menzies Creek. It was the Climax's first run since its restoration. On Saturday 22 October a triple parallel run with 3801, D3639, K153 and R761 occurred. 3801 ran on the standard and D3 639 and K153 on the broad gauge line were both parallel running from Melbourne to Somerton where they meet up with R761. At Seymour, R761 have been derailed on the standard gauge diamond loop. Diesel locomotives were quickly organised to haul the standard gauge train and R761's train back to Melbourne, while D3 639 and K153 were able to return the third load. 3801 returned to Melbourne as a light engine and R761 headed home next morning. On Sunday 23 October, an extensive locomotive collection was displayed at Spencer Street station: ;Great Western Railway *Pendennis Castle R761 and K153 ran shuttle trips between Spencer Street and Flinders Street stations throughout the day, while the Elecrail Tait set ran a Mystery Tour. Beside the locomotives at Spencer Street, a good variety of road-based steam power, such as vintage trucks and buses, were on display. There were tram shuttles up Flinders Street. On 25 October, the Flying Scotsman worked its first passenger trip in Australia, when it worked a return Melbourne to Albury service. The Return Home On Thursday 27 October, the New South Wales locomotives began the return to their home state. 1210 and 3112 worked a special tour to Albury with K153 running parallel as far as Seymour. 4201 headed for Albury, with C504 in the lead on an interstate freight train, C504 only made it to Donnybrook just north of Melbourne where it became a total failure, locomotive G517 came out from Melbourne to replace the C, and the G and 4201 hauled the freight to NSW. By the next morning, 4201, 1210 and 3112 had reached Cootamundra. 1210 worked alone with four platform end carriages. North from Harden, 1210 and 3112 then double headed to Yass, with 4201 doing the clearing up on its own. 1210 and 3112 ran shuttle trips on the Yass Town line. Meanwhile, 3801 the Bicentennial Train left Melbourne heading to Albury, running parallel with R707 as far as Seymour. On 30 October 3801 with 5910 set off on the home run to Sydney. However, Flying Scotsman stayed in Melbourne until 17 December.

In this case, price retraced approximately 38.2% of a move down before continuing. In finance, Fibonacci retracement is a method of technical analysis for determining support and resistance levels. They are named after their use of the Fibonacci sequence. Fibonacci retracement is based on the idea that markets will retrace a predictable portion of a move, after which they will continue to move in the original direction. The appearance of retracement can be ascribed to ordinary price volatility as described by Burton Malkiel, a Princeton economist in his book A Random Walk Down Wall Street, who found no reliable predictions in technical analysis methods taken as a whole. Malkiel argues that asset prices typically exhibit signs of random walk and that one cannot consistently outperform market averages. Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points on a chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios. 0.0% is considered to be the start of the retracement, while 100.0% is a complete reversal to the original part of the move. Once these levels are identified, horizontal lines are drawn and used to identify possible support and resistance levels (see trend line). The significance of such levels, however, could not be confirmed by examining the data. Arthur Merrill in Filtered Waves determined there is no reliably standard retracement: not 50%, 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, nor any other.  Common Uses  Fibonacci retracement is a popular tool that technical traders use to help identify strategic places for transactions, stop losses or target prices to help traders get in at a good price. The retracement concept is used in many indicators such as Tirone levels, Gartley patterns, Elliott Wave theory and more. After a significant movement in price (be it up or down) the new support and resistance levels are often at these lines. Unlike moving averages, Fibonacci retracement levels are static prices. They do not change. This allows quick and simple identification and allows traders and investors to react when price levels are tested. Because these levels are inflection points, traders expect some type of price action, either a break or a rejection. The 0.617 Fibonacci retracement that is often used by stock analysts approximates to the \\"golden ratio\\".

Tallinn Botanic Garden (), is a botanical garden in Tallinn, Estonia. It is located on the right bank of the Pirita River, in the Kloostrimetsa forest in Pirita district. With an area of , it is the largest in Estonia. History The idea of founding a botanical garden in Tallinn first arose in the 1860s. It took almost 100 years for the idea to be realized. The garden was established on 1 December 1961 as a subordinate institution of the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR and was developed over the following years. Major plant collections were planted during the first 20 years. The systematic open-air collections were opened for visitors in 1970 and the greenhouse collections in 1971. Originally, the main focus of research was the foreign species in Estonian context e.g. plant growth requirements and acclimatisation. From the 1970s research moved to the use of indigenous plant species in landscaping and horticulture (Ülle Kukk, Vaike Paju, Marianna Saar etc.) The Botanic Garden has added a number of sections, such as the Audaku experimental station in Viidumäe Nature Reserve on Saaremaa (since 1963) and an arboretum in Iru (1973–1994). Since 1992 Tallinn Botanic Garden is a member of the Association of Baltic Botanic Gardens (ABBG), and since 1994 the Botanic Garden Conservation International (BGCI) and the Network of Botanic Gardens in the Baltic Sea region.Botanic Gardens in the Baltic Sea region In 1995, the responsibility for the Botanic Garden was transferred to the Tallinn city council.

Formed May 10, 1793, it lasted less than five months. In this brief period of time, however, the Society managed to draw significant interest within the national political scene, and advocated for gender equality in revolutionary politics. Background By the summer of 1789, the French Revolution had begun. The Tennis Court Oath had been made and the Third Estate of the Estates-General had created a new \\"National Assembly\\".Brown, Gregory S. French Revolution Chronology. University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Web. November 23, 2009. Large crowds gathered in public places to discuss the state of the revolution and to discuss what could and should be done in order to remedy the problems that besieged the state. Women too participated in these discussions. On January 1, 1789 a document was addressed to the King, “Petition des femmes du Tiers Etat au roi”, which stated that women wanted equal educational opportunities. Along with the argument for education there was also an argument put forth for equality of sexes. Melzer, Sara E., and Leslie W. Rabine. Rebel Daughters: Women and the French Revolution. New York: Oxford UP, 1992. Print. Many of them had strong feelings and opinions about the revolution and what should be happening in the government. One point that was especially poignant for the women in this era was economic stability. Market prices were out of control and women had to feed their families. On October 5, 1789, women had their first major role in the Revolution. On this day, women marched to Versailles to demand bread from King Louis XVI.Women and the French Revolution. Sunshine for Women, 2003. Web. 24 Nov. 2009. While need for bread was not the only reason that women began to take an interest in the Revolution, it was a very prominent one, especially in the early stages. The feminist newspaper “Etrennes Nationales des dames” would publish an article calling women to have an active role in the National Assembly and reminding them of the day, October 5th, that so many women took a stand.

In that pamphlet she writes: > \\"Would it not be useful to form, in each Section of the capital, a patriotic > society of citoyennes ...

Women were able to take part in politics through mixed fraternal societies. Clubs with only female membership began to pick up steam, they became very popular in the provinces. While most women understood that these clubs were simply to support the males in the army, some women wanted to fight alongside them. Melzer, Sara E., and Leslie W. Rabine. Rebel Daughters: Women and the French Revolution. New York: Oxford UP, 1992. Print Today, historians know of about thirty women's clubs that sprung up at this time. These clubs organized themselves well. Each had a presiding body and each laid out rules for their specific clubs.Godineau, Dominique: Translated by Katherine Streip. The Women of Paris and Their French Revolution. United States of America: University of California Press, 1998. Print. These clubs had a membership range of two hundred to six hundred, with an active attendance of about sixty. Over time, these women's clubs began to widen their political scope and include other issues in their meetings. Soon, the issue of citizenship began to emerge. Citoyenne - not only did they want the title of citizen, a designation as an inhabitant of the country, they wanted the rights and responsibilities that come with being a citizen. One woman went before the National Convention to say this: > \\"Citizen legislators, you have given men a Constitution; now they enjoy all > the rights of free beings, but women are very far from sharing these > glories. Women count for nothing in the political system. We ask for primary > assemblies and, as the Constitution is based on the Rights of Man, we now > demand the full exercise of these rights for ourselves.\\"Scott, Joan Wallach. > \\"French Feminists and the Rights of 'Man': Olympe de Gouges's Declarations.\\" > History Workshop 28 (1989): 1-21. JSTOR. Web. 21 Nov 2009. In 1791, Olympe de Gouges published one of the most prominent women's rights documents of that time period: The Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen. This document introduced the issue of women's rights directly into the French Revolution. It argued that sexual equality had a place in the revolution for equal rights.Heuer, Jennifer Ngaire. \\"Gender and Women's Rights.\\" French Revolution, Encyclopedia of Human Rights. Oxford Reference, 2009. Web. 24 Nov. 2009. Origins In 1793, political chaos reigned. The Jacobins, the leading political force of the era, now allied with the sans-culottes and the Cordeliers, a radical political club in Paris. The coalition took the extreme left position, supporting price controls and ruthless punishments against those who disputed their views. Rivaling them was the Girondins, who maintained support for a free market.Levy, Darline Gay, Harriet Branson Applewhite and Mary Durham Johnson. Women in Revolutionary Paris 1789-1795. United States of America: University of Illinois Press, 1979. Print. In February 1793, a group of women from the Section des Quatre Nations requested the use of the meeting hall of the Jacobins for a meeting of their own. The Jacobins refused. Some say that they feared a \\"massive women's protest\\". The group of women, who now called themselves the Assembly of Republican Women, persisted and received permission from the Fraternal Society of Patriots of Both Sexes to use their meeting hall. This Assembly's main aim was toward economic stability. However, for some this was not enough. They wanted more political activity. On May 10, 1793, the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women was formed; it was a feminist society, yet saw its role of defending the revolution. Founders of this society Pauline Léon and Claire Lancombe officially registered The Society of Revolutionary Republican Women at the Paris Commune: Melzer, Sara E., and Leslie W. Rabine. Rebel Daughters: Women and the French Revolution. New York: Oxford UP, 1992. Print. > \\"Several citoyennes presented themselves to the secretariat of the > municipality and…declared their intention of assembling and forming a > society which admits only women. The Society has for its objective > deliberation on the means of frustrating the projects of the republic's > enemies. It will bear the name of Revolutionary Republic Society and will > meet in the library of the Jacobins, rue Saint-Honoré\\" National influence Rules and regulations were soon established (see Club Organization and Regulations), and in no time the Society dove right into the political fury. Several accounts report that the women of the Society would wear the red caps of liberty to signify their alliance with the revolution. They began to have regular meetings, and attended the National Convention assemblies as much as possible. At the Convention, members of the galleries would cheer at speeches that they agreed with, and boo and make a general ruckus at things they took issue with. The Girondins, for their part, got tired of the hackling and designated specific galleries for Girondin supporters. The Society was outraged. At their next meeting, a motion was passed to do all they could to stop this outrage. From then on, women from the Society would stand guard at the doors to these specific galleries, refusing entrance to them. The Society also worked jointly with the Cordeliers club on several occasions. On May 19, they presented to the Convention a joint delegation to demand more harsh laws for counterrevolutionaries and those suspected of being counterrevolutionaries. Very soon after came the uprising of May 31 to June 2. Around thirty Girondins were expelled from the Convention. The Montagnards were now in charge. The Society did as much as they could to help this insurrection, supporting the radical Jacobins all the way. When the new Montagnard Constitution was adopted in late June, the Society praised it and the Convention, joining in on the celebratory festivities. They continued to support the new policies and delegations presented by the Jacobins. On July 13, 1793, Jean-Paul Marat, an extreme leftist whom the Society admired, was stabbed to death by Charlotte Corday. Corday supported the Girondins, and hated Marat's radical leftist paper, L'Ami du peuple.Semmer, Beth. Worker's World. Worker's World, 18 July 2002. Web. 21 Nov. 2009. Marat's death hit the Society hard. During the funeral, the Society women carried the bathtub where he was murdered and threw flowers on his body. On July 24, the Society swore to raise an obelisk in memory of his legacy. This obelisk took until August 18 to erect. The Society was so caught up in this, that they remained politically inactive from the time of Marat's death to the day the obelisk was completed. That night, they vowed to focus on the issue of national security. After this occurrence, the Society began to drift away from the Jacobins and more toward the Enragés, a political group led by Jacques Roux, Jean Varlet and Théopile Leclerc which supported strict economic control and harsh national security. The Society began to feel that the Montagnards were not including enough of the radical propositions from the leftist Enragés demands. In September, the Society became even more deeply involved. Campaigning for numerous petitions, they helped enact much legislation throughout the month. Pierre Roussel reported hearing at a meeting of the Society a proposal \\"to present to the Convention...[a call for] a decree obliging women to wear the national cockade.\\"Roussel, Pierre Joseph Alexis, Le Chateau des Tuileries,2 vols. (Paris: Legouge, 1802), vol.2, pp. 34-46. Found in: Levy, Darline Gay, Harriet Branson Applewhite and Mary Durham Johnson. Women in Revolutionary Paris 1789-1795. United States of America: University of Illinois Press, 1979. Print. This petition was to become quite influential in the history of the Society. On September 21, as per the Society's demands, the National Convention declared that all women must wear the tricolor cockade of the revolution. Many women hated this decree and refused to wear the cockade. Market women had already begun to turn on the Society. They opposed the Society's views on price controls, among other issues. Dissolution September 16 marked the beginning of the end for the Society. On this day in 1793, Claire Lacombe, then president of the Society, was publicly denounced by the Jacobins to the Committee of General Security. The Jacobins accused her of \\"making counterrevolutionary statements\\" and having associated and aided a \\"notorious counterrevolutionary, the énrage Leclerc\\". Lacombe did her best to defend herself, but it was too late. She was briefly detained and then set free. The seed of distrust had been planted. The Society tried in vain to continue to petition the Convention. Most of the issues that they now dealt with were more trivial and less radical than their previous campaigns. Around this time, women, especially women merchants, began to be very suspicious of women wearing the cockade and red liberty bonnets. There began to be violence in the streets between those women who supported the cockades, notably the Society for Revolutionary Republican Women, and those who did not. The market women went to the Convention with their problem and petitioned that the Society be abolished. On October 30, 1793, the National Convention decreed that \\"clubs and popular societies of women, under whatever denomination, are forbidden\\". The Society of Revolutionary Republican Women was officially dissolved, despite numerous protests by leading figures in the club. > \\"The sans culotte, Chaumette said when he dissolved women's clubs in October > I793, [that he] had a right to expect from his wife [to attend to] the > running of his home while he attended political meetings: hers was the care > of the family: this was the full extent of her civic duties.\\"Hufton, Olwen. > \\"Women in Revolution 1789-1796\\". Past & Present 53 (1971): 90-108. JSTOR. > Web. 21 Nov. 2009. Club organization and regulation The Society of Revolutionary Republican Women had a very organized governing system. The presiding officers consisted of: * Club President - Elected for one month at a time * Club Vice-President - Elected for one month at a time * Four Secretaries - Elected for one month at a time * Club Treasurer - Elected for three months at a time * Two Assistant Treasurers - Elected for three months at a time * One Archivist - Elected for three months at a time * One Assistant Archivist - Elected for three months at a time * Two Monitors - Elected for one month at a time There were three committees in the Society: the Administration Committee, the Relief Committee and the Correspondence Committee.Stark, Nicholas. Political Parties of the French Revolution. Wordpress.com. Web. 20 Nov. 2009. These committees each had twelve elected members each. All of the voting within the Society was done by roll-call voting. The Society itself had around one hundred seventy members, of which around one hundred were regularly attending meetings. To become a member, one had to be \\"presented by a member and seconded by two more members\\", and she had to take an oath \\"to live for the Republic or die for it\\".Réglement de la Société des citoyennes républicaines révolutionnaires de Paris (n.p, n.d.), in Bibliothèque historique de la Ville de Paris, 958939.

He and other family members fought at the Battles of Preston and Winwick in 1648 where he gained valuable military experience. Adamson then served as a cavalryman under Lt-Col the Lord Gerard until the Restoration when he was commissioned in the Artillery Company. Promoted Captain, he was posted to the Board of Ordnance, later becoming Master-Gunner of England.Burke's Landed Gentry online: ADAMSON formerly of Hurst Hall As the threat of French invasion continued throughout the seventeenth century, Adamson was tasked with updating the 16th-century treatise by Thomas Digges, Muster Master-General to Queen Elizabeth's forces in the Low Countries, compromised by being leaked to the Earl of Leicester shortly before the Spanish attempted invasion of England in 1588. Adamson based his on this earlier work, editing and updating it with his own additions: he gave an account of ‘such stores of war and other materials as are requisite for the defence of a fort, a train of artillery, and for a magazine belonging to a field army;’ adding also a list: (1) of the ships of war, (2) of the Governors of the garrisons of England, (3) of the Lords Lieutenant and High Sheriffs of the counties on the coast; and concluding his tract with a summary of the wages paid per month to the officers and seamen in the fleet. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography notes that Adamson (from a recusant family) feared a French invasion could be supported by English Catholics and that he expressed the view that the people of England should take action against any such invasion, even to the point of deposing governors of garrisons where necessary. Thus, Adamson's work was in some circles construed as possibly inciting rebellion.

The group was originally set up on the orders of Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Rafael Eitan, who instructed Israeli General Avigdor Ben-Gal to create the group in the wake of the 1979 Nahariya attack.Ronen Bergman, 'How Arafat Eluded Israel’s Assassination Machine,' New York Times Magazine 23 January 2018 Origins According to Ronen Bergman, the FLLP was set up in the wake of a massacre of an Israeli family at Nahariya in 1979 by militants, such as Samir Kuntar, belonging to the Palestine Liberation Front. The operations, mostly unauthorized, which it carried out against the Palestinian Liberation Organization in Lebanon were coordinated by Meir Dagan, reportedly without informing the IDF, the Israeli Defense Ministry, the Israeli government and its various defense agencies. David Agmon at the time head of Israel's northern command was one of the few people who were briefed on its operations. Lebanese operatives on the ground from the Maronite, Shiite and Druze communities were recruited. The aim of the series of operations was to: > 'cause chaos among the Palestinians and Syrians in Lebanon, without leaving > an Israeli fingerprint, to give them the feeling that they were constantly > under attack and to instill them with a sense of insecurity.' Activities 1979-1983 The group made its début in July 1981 with a bomb attack on the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) offices at Fakhani Road in West Beirut,Sudden Death: Bombings rock P.L.O. offices, TIME Magazine, 28 September 1981. http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953128,00.html#ixzz1Gs8wqZUY though it only reached the peak of its activities later in September by unleashing a spate of car-bombings that created havoc in the Muslim quarters of Sidon, Tripoli, Chekka and West Beirut until February 1982. In the latter case, the car-bombs were combined with a powerful command-detonated explosive device planted at a packed cinema – followed suit by another in early October – that left 300 civilians dead or wounded; other attacks undertaken that same month targeted Syrian troops of the Arab Deterrent Force, followed by a failed assassination attempt on the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon John Gunther Dean.O'Ballance, Civil War in Lebanon (1998), p. 111.New book gives credence to US ambassador’s claim that Israel tried to assassinate him in 1980, Philip Weiss, 22, 2018, Mondoweiss FLLF operations came to a sudden halt just prior to the June 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, only to be resumed the following year with four huge car-bomb attacks: the first one on 28 January 1983 struck a PLO headquarters at Chtaura in the Syrian-controlled Beqaa Valley, killing 40, coupled by a second on 3 February at West Beirut that devastated the Palestine Research Center offices and left 20 people dead, including the wife of Sabri Jiryis.Nur Masalha,'The Palestine Nakba: Decolonising History, Narrating the Subaltern, Reclaiming Memory,' Zed Books Ltd., 2012 p.144.O'Brien, Campaign of Terror (1983), p. 26.Middle East Record (MER), 2 October 1982, pp. 6-8.

Released on 16 November 2009, the set contains nine albums originally released by Epic Records between 1980 and 1990, plus an exclusive CD of 12\\" extended mixes. The set was also made available as a download through iTunes. Background Although one of the most popular acts of the 1980s, Shakin' Stevens' major period of success came just before the emergence of the compact disc as a major format. Three of Stevens' albums, This Ole House (1981), Shaky (1981) and Give Me Your Heart Tonight (1982), had made the top 3 of the UK charts during 1981 and 1982 and, as a result, his 1983 release The Bop Won't Stop was one of the earliest of Epic's albums to be transferred to the CD format. However, despite producing three Top 5 hit singles, the album itself stalled at number 21 in the charts. In response to this relative failure, Epic ignored Shaky's next two album releases (one of which was his Greatest Hits album). By the time of Stevens' next release - 1987's Let's Boogie - compact disc had become the dominant music format and, indeed, all of Stevens' subsequent studio albums were released on CD. However, the rise of the CD happened to coincide with a decline in the Welsh rocker's popularity and, apart from a few hits compilations and a very limited release of This Ole House (1981) in the early 1990s, many of Shaky's most popular recordings were to be denied a digital release for many years. In 2003, Epic's parent company Sony BMG released a compromise three CD box set entitled Hits And More which contained most of the hits plus various selected album tracks. However, a resurgence in Stevens' popularity which began with him winning the 2005 ITV show Hit Me Baby One More Time resulted in the hits album The Collection reaching number 4 in the UK album charts. With Shaky's appearance at the 2008 Glastonbury Festival helping to confirm his popularity among those old enough to remember him the first time around, Sony finally relented and authorised, for the first time, the release of all of Shakin' Stevens' original albums on compact disc. Marketed as a 30th anniversary celebration of Shaky's first hit single \\"Hot Dog\\", The Epic Masters contains 147 digitally remastered tracks (apparently overseen by Stevens himself) spread across ten compact discs. The set includes all of the albums Stevens recorded for Epic with the exception of the Merry Christmas Everyone album (which had already been available on a remastered CD since 2005) and represents the first appearance on compact disc in their entirety of the albums Take One! (1980), Shaky (1981), Give Me Your Heart Tonight and Lipstick, Powder and Paint. Each album is boosted by the addition of non-album b-sides and are housed in slip cases which reproduce the original vinyl releases. The package is completed by a bonus CD of selected 12\\" mixes plus a fully annotated booklet. Apart from the Merry Christmas Everyone album, The Epic Masters contains virtually everything Shakin' Stevens released on Epic. Among the few omissions are the original single versions of \\"Hot Dog\\", \\"Blue Christmas\\" and the number one hit \\"Merry Christmas Everyone\\" (all previously available on several compilations). Also missing are most of the live recordings available on the B-sides of various singles. Of the extended mixes not included on The 12\\" CD, the most glaring omission would be the \\"Megamixofhits\\" compilation included on the \\"Teardrops\\" 12\\" which formed the basis of the \\"Hits Keep Coming\\" live medley from Let's Boogie. Finally, the digital remasters retained the noticeably different mixes of the number one hits \\"This Ole House\\", \\"Green Door\\" and \\"Oh Julie\\" which were included on the 2005 compilation The Collection. Remastering It's been noted on the Steve Hoffman board that several fans who've bought this set have been very disappointed in the remastering, as all the albums contain brickwalling. Results on the DR database range from D1 to D2, with many of the songs constantly clipping. Some fans hoped that Sony could redo this set again without the obnoxiously loud mastering, but consensus is that this won't happen. Track listing Disc 1 Take One! (1980)  Erroneously dated in the box set as being released in October 1979, Take One! wasn't in fact released until February 1980, after the \\"Hot Dog\\" single had become Shaky's first UK hit single. Produced by Mike Hurst, the album contained a host of experienced session men, including lead guitarist Albert Lee, pianist Geraint Watkins, steel guitarist B.J. Cole and bassist and arranger Stuart Colman. In April 1982 the album was re-released under the new title of Hot Dog with \\"That's All Right\\" and \\"Ah, Poor Little Baby\\" being replaced by \\"You and I Were Meant to Be\\" and \\"Make It Right Tonight\\" respectively. The Epic Masters CD also contains Stevens' first three non-album singles recorded for Epic in 1978 and 1979. This is the first release on CD of the Take One! album. #\\"Lovestruck\\" (Ernie Barton) #\\"Hot Dog\\" (Buck Owens, Denny Dedmon) #\\"Is a Bluebird Blue?\\" (Dan Penn) #\\"That's All Right\\" (Gerald Nelson, Fred Burch) #\\"Without a Love\\" (Jimmy & Ronnie Isle) #\\"Shame Shame Shame\\" (Ruby Fisher, Ken Hopkins) #\\"Shotgun Boogie\\" (Tennessee Ernie Ford) #\\"I Got Burned\\" (Ral Donner) #\\"I Guess I Was a Fool\\" (Buddy Holly) #\\"Ah, Poor Little Baby\\" (Rex Koury, Falk) #\\"Little Pigeon\\" (Ray Whitt) #\\"Do What You Did\\" (Thurston Harris) ;Bonus Tracks # * \\"Apron Strings\\" (George David Weiss, Aaron Schroeder) (B-side of \\"Hot Dog\\") #\\"Treat Her Right\\" (Roy Head, Jean Kurtz) (Single) #\\"I Don't Want No Other Baby\\" (Dickie Bishop, Bob Watson) (B-side of \\"Treat Her Right\\" and \\"Spooky\\") #\\"Endless Sleep\\" (Jody Reynolds/Dolores Nance) (Single) #\\"Fire\\" (Bruce Springsteen) (B-side of \\"Endless Sleep\\") #\\"Spooky\\" (Buddy Buie, James Cobb, Harry Middlebrooks, Mike Shapiro) (Single) Disc 2 This Ole House (1981)  The first of the hugely successful trio of Stuart Colman produced albums, This Ole House was originally released under the title of Marie Marie in 17 October 1980. However, the album initially failed to make the charts but was re-issued and re-titled in 27 March 1981 after the success of the \\"This Ole House\\" single and Stevens was rewarded with a number 2 position on the album charts. \\"This Ole House\\" replaced the song \\"Two Hearts Two Kisses\\" (listed on the Marie Marie album by simply \\"Two Hearts\\" at the time) from the original album which is now reinstated as a bonus track on The Epic Masters CD. The album retained most of the same musicians from the Take One! (1980) album, with the addition of ace Welsh guitarist (and ex-member of Shaky's previous backing group the Sunsets) Mickey Gee. #\\"Hey Mae\\" (Rusty & Doug Kershaw) #\\"Baby If We Touch\\" (Shakin' Stevens) #\\"Marie Marie\\" (Dave Alvin) #\\"Lonely Blue Boy\\" (Ben Weisman, Fred Wise) #\\"Make It Right Tonight\\" (Shakin' Stevens) #\\"Move\\" (Peter Green, C.

Alongside three top 10 singles (the UK number 1 \\"Green Door\\", \\"You Drive Me Crazy\\" and \\"It's Raining\\") the album also contained five of Stevens' own compositions. When the album was released in Australia (with a slightly different track listing) it was re-titled Green Door and even received a CD release in the early 1990s. However, The Epic Masters marks the album's first release on CD in its original form. The bonus track \\"You and I Were Meant to Be\\" was also included on the Hot Dog album released in 1982. # \\"Mona Lisa\\" (Jay Livingston, Ray Evans) # \\"You Drive Me Crazy\\" (Ronnie Harwood) # \\"I'm Knockin'\\" (Shakin' Stevens) # \\"It's Raining\\" (Naomi Neville) # \\"Don't She Look Good\\" (Joey Spampinato) # \\"Green Door\\" (Bob Davie, Marvin Moore) # \\"Don't Bug Me Baby\\" (Luallen, Bragg) # \\"Don't Tell Me Your Troubles\\" (Don Gibson) # \\"I'm Gonna Sit Right Down and Write Myself a Letter\\" (Fred E.

As well as the self-composed number 1 single \\"Oh Julie\\", the album also contained another three top 20 hits. Midway through the sessions, Stevens created a new studio band with the addition of The Rumour Brass, a four piece horn section, and only guitarist Roger McKew remaining from the previous three albums. Like the Shaky album, Give Me Your Heart Tonight was issued on compact disc with an altered track listing in Australia in the early 1990s. The Epic Masters however, gives the album its first CD release in its original form. # \\"Josephine\\" (Shakin' Stevens) # \\"Give Me Your Heart Tonight\\" (Billy Livsey) # \\"Sapphire\\" (Jack Hammer) # \\"Oh Julie\\" (Shakin' Stevens) # \\"I'll Be Satisfied (Berry Gordy, Jr., Tyran Carlo) # \\"Vanessa\\" (Billy Swan, Dennis Linde) # \\"Boppity Bop\\" (Shakin' Stevens) # \\"Don't Tell Me We're Through\\" (Shakin' Stevens) # \\"Shirley\\" (John Fred, Tommy Bryan) # \\"You Never Talked About Me\\" (Doc Pomus, Mort Shuman) # \\"Too Too Much\\" (Stuart Leathwood, Gary Sulsh) # \\"(Yeah) You're Evil\\" (Shakin' Stevens) # \\"Que Sera, Sera\\" (Jay Livingston, Ray Evans) ;Bonus Tracks # * \\"I'm for You\\" (Shakin' Stevens) (B-side of \\"Shirley\\") # \\"Thinkin' of You\\" (Shakin' Stevens) (B-side of \\"Give Me Your Heart Tonight\\") # \\"Don't Be Late (Miss Kate)\\" (Shakin' Stevens) (B-side of \\"I'll Be Satisfied\\") # \\"Lawdy Miss Clawdy (live)\\" (Lloyd Price) (from \\"Shakin' Stevens Special Edition EP\\") Disc 5 The Bop Won't Stop (1983)  Produced mainly by Christopher Neil, The Bop Won't Stop signalled a move towards a more contemporary pop sound, highlighted by the top 3 single \\"Cry Just a Little Bit\\". Despite producing three other top 20 singles (two reaching the top 5), the album itself did not perform as well on the charts as Stevens' previous three albums. Nevertheless, The Bop Won't Stop became Shaky's first compact disc release in 1984. Among the bonus tracks included on The Epic Masters are \\"Your Ma Said You Cried in Your Sleep Last Night\\" which was released as a Europe-only single in 1983, and \\"A Letter To You\\", a top 10 single released ahead of 1984's Greatest Hits compilation. # \\"The Bop Won't Stop\\" (Steve Tatler) # \\"Why Do You Treat Me This Way?\\" (Shakin' Stevens) # \\"Diddle I\\" (Hogberg, Lawton) # \\"Don't Be Two Faced\\" (Tom Bee) # \\"Livin' Lovin' Wreck\\" (Otis Blackwell) # \\"A Rockin' Good Way (To Mess Around and Fall in Love)\\" (Brook Benton, Clyde Otis, Luchi DeJesus) Duet with Bonnie Tyler # \\"Brand New Man\\" (Mickey Gee) # \\"Cry Just a Little Bit\\" (Bob Heatlie) # \\"As Long As\\" (Steve Markwick, S. Stevens) # \\"A Love Worth Waiting For\\" (Gary Sulsh, Stuart Leathwood) # \\"Love Me Tonight\\" (Shakin' Stevens) # \\"It's Late\\" (Dorsey Burnette) ;Bonus Tracks # * \\"It's Good for You (Baby)\\" (Shakin' Stevens) (B-side of \\"It's Late\\") # \\"Your Ma Said You Cried in Your Sleep Last Night\\" (Stephen Schlaks, Robert Glazer) (B-side of \\"Cry Just a Little Bit\\" 12\\") # \\"A Letter to You\\" (Dennis Linde) (Single) # \\"Come Back and Love Me\\" (Shakin' Stevens) (B-side of \\"A Letter to You\\") Disc 6 Lipstick, Powder and Paint (1985)  Lipstick, Powder and Paint saw Shaky reunite with fellow Welshman Dave Edmunds who had produced the first Shakin' Stevens and the Sunsets album A Legend in 1970. However, despite the inclusion of the rocking title track and covers of Chuck Berry and Billy Fury songs, the album was not a total return to the traditional rock and roll sound of earlier Stevens releases. It was also the first album since Take One! (1980) not to contain any top 10 singles, although the Christmas number 1 single \\"Merry Christmas Everyone\\" (not included on the album) was released during this period. Perhaps as an indication of Stevens' fading popularity, Epic chose not to issue the album on compact disc when originally released in 1985 and, as a result, The Epic Masters presents the album's first official CD release. The bonus track \\"I'll Give You My Heart\\" featured on this disc is the remixed version which was the B-Side to the single \\"Lipstick Powder And Paint\\". There was an earlier version on the B-Side to \\"Breaking Up My Heart\\" which is not present in this box set, although the CD incorrectly lists it as such. # \\"Lipstick, Powder and Paint\\" (Jesse Stone) # \\"Bad Reputation\\" (Gordon Campbell) # \\"Don't Lie to Me\\" (Chuck Berry) # \\"I'm Leaving You\\" (Gavin Povey, Vincent Laurentis) # \\"The Shape I'm In\\" (Lee Cathy, Otis Blackwell) # \\"Don't Knock Upon My Door\\" (Billy Fury) # \\"Turning Away\\" (Tim Krekel) # \\"Love You Out Loud\\" (Gerald Milne) # \\"As Long as I Have You\\" (Shakin' Stevens) # \\"With My Heart\\" (B. Roberts, D. Edwards, S. Stevens) # \\"Ain't It a Shame (You Win Again) (Roger Dexter) # \\"So Long Baby Goodbye\\" (David Alvin) ;Bonus Tracks # * \\"Teardrops\\" (Shakin' Stevens) (Single) featuring Hank Marvin on lead guitar # \\"You Shake Me Up\\" (Gary Sulsh, Stuart Leathwood) (B-side of \\"Teardrops\\") # \\"Breaking Up My Heart\\" (Bob Heatlie) (Single) # *\\"I'll Give You My Heart (Remix)\\" (Shakin' Stevens) (B-side of \\"Lipstick, Powder and Paint\\") Disc 7 Let's Boogie (1987)  Split into a studio side and a live side, 1987's Let's Boogie was Stevens' first album release for two years. Using a variety of producers, four of the five studio tracks were released as singles, one of which, \\"What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For?\\", was to become Shaky's last top 10 single in the UK. The version of the song included on The Epic Masters is the single mix and not the one included on the original album release, which was apparently an earlier recording that was issued in error by Epic Records. The second half of the album consisted entirely of a 23-minute medley of Shaky's hits recorded at the London Palladium in December 1986. The album received a full CD issue on its original 1987 release. The medley now plays as one complete track, where as before on the 1987 release it was chaptered. It was rectified for 'random' playing in CD players to let the live medley flow correctly. # \\"Come See About Me\\" (Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, Edward Holland, Jr.) # \\"Forever You\\" (Gary Sulsh, Stuart Leathwood) # \\"A Little Boogie Woogie (In the Back of My Mind)\\" (Mike Leander, Seago, Gary Glitter) # \\"Because I Love You\\" (Gordon Campbell) # \\"What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For?\\" (Joseph McCarthy, Howard Johnson, James V.

Three songs from 1981 were included (\\"Oh Julie\\", plus two tracks from the Shaky album) as well as the single mix of the previous year's \\"What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For?\\" (which means the same mix is now included on two discs of The Epic Masters). None of the newly recorded singles from the album reached the UK top 20, despite an attempt to bring Stevens' sound up to date by having Art of Noise re-mix \\"Jezebel\\" for single release. That 7\\" mix is now included as a bonus track on The Epic Masters. \\"How Many Tears Can You Hide\\" is the PWL Pete Hammond mixed CD single version and not the original album or vinyl 7\\" version. Included for the first time on this release is a new mix of \\"Woman (What Have You Done to Me)\\" and a non fade out version of \\"Hello Josephine\\". # \\"What Do You Want to Make Those Eyes at Me For?\\" (Joseph McCarthy, Howard Johnson, James V.

Rock 'n' Roll (1990)  In a further attempt to update his sound, Stevens' recorded this 1990 album with producer Pete Hammond at Pete Waterman's PWL Studios. In total five singles were released from the album, although the last of these, \\"My Cutie Cutie\\", only managed to limp to number 75 in the UK singles chart. Although the singles were released by Epic (as well as the Europe edition of the album), the album itself was issued in the UK by Telstar Records and was supported by a TV advertising campaign. The album was also later released on Ronco. The Epic Masters edition also contains Stevens' last single for Epic, 1992's \\"Radio\\". Recorded with the help of Queen drummer Roger Taylor, \\"Radio\\" was released in support of The Epic Years, a greatest hits collection which effectively brought to an end Shaky's 14-year relationship with the label. # \\"Love Attack\\" (Steve and Heather Taylor) # \\"I Might\\" (Gary Sulsh, Stuart Leathwood, Barrie Guard) # \\"Yes I Do\\" (Gary Sulsh, Stuart Leathwood) # \\"You Shake Me Up\\" (Re-mix) (Gary Sulsh, Stuart Leathwood) # \\"Tell Me\\" (Steve and Heather Taylor) # \\"Tear It Up\\" (Paul Burlison, Dorsey Burnette, Johnny Burnette) # \\"My Cutie Cutie\\" (Ronnie Harwood) # \\"The Night Time Is the Right Time\\" (Parkhill) # \\"Pink Champagne\\" (Steve and Heather Taylor) # \\"If I Lose You\\" (Billy Fury) # \\"Queen of the Hop\\" (Bobby Darin, Woody Harris) # \\"Rockin' the Night Away\\" (Shakin' Stevens) ;Bonus Tracks # * \\"Love Attack\\" (Steve and Heather Taylor) (Single version) # \\"Love Won't Stop\\" (Shakin' Stevens) (B-side of \\"I Might\\") # \\"Radio\\" (Single version) (Gordon Campbell, Bob Heatlie) # \\"Radio\\" (Acoustic) (Gordon Campbell, Bob Heatlie) (Bonus version from CD single #1 \\"Radio\\") # \\"Oh Baby Don't (Out Take)\\" (Shakin' Stevens) (B-side of \\"Radio\\") Disc 10 The 12\\" CD  The tenth disc of The Epic Masters is entitled The 12\\" CD and is a collection of some extended mixes previously only issued on Stevens' 12\\" singles. John Luongo also remixed the 12\\" version of \\"Breaking Up My Heart\\" but unlike \\"Cry Just a Little Bit\\" it was not credited as 'Luongo's Mix' and simply became 'Extended Remix' on the vinyl 12\\" sleeve and label. The \\"Jezebel (Monster Remix)\\" was remixed by J. J.

It changed the law on coroners and criminal justice in England and Wales. Among its provisions are: *preventing criminals from profiting from publications about their crimes *abolishing the anachronistic offences of sedition and seditious, defamatory and obscene libel *re-enacting the provisions of the emergency Criminal Evidence (Witness Anonymity) Act 2008 so that the courts may continue to grant anonymity to vulnerable or intimidated witnesses where this is consistent with a defendant's right to a fair trial *criminalising possession of pornographic non-photographic images depicting under-18s, and of adults where the \\"predominant impression conveyed\\" is of a person under the age of 18.The Coroners and Justice Act 2009, Part 2, Chapter 2 *criminalising the holding of someone in slavery or servitude, or requiring them to perform forced or compulsory labourCPS - Crown Prosecution Service, section 71 *provision for the abolition of the office of Coroner of the Queen's Household.The Coroners and Justice Act 2009, section 46 *creation of the partial defence of loss of control The Coroners and Justice Act 2009, Section 54 The Act makes it illegal to own any picture depicting under-18s participating in sexual activities, or depictions of sexual activity in the presence of someone under 18. The law has been condemned by a coalition of graphic artists, publishers and MPs, fearing it will criminalise graphic novels such as Lost Girls and Watchmen. These sections came into effect on 6 April 2010.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/04/06/cartoon_law_live/ The Act contains measures to reform the coroner system. According to the Institute of Legal Executives, \\"There is provision, carefully circumscribed, for the establishment of a judicial inquiry under the 2005 Inquiries Act to take the place of an inquest, where there is highly sensitive evidence (typically intercept) and it would not be possible to have an Article 2 compliant inquest. These provisions will be used in rare cases only.\\" The most controversial aspect of the bill are the provisions regarding secret inquests. The provisions had previously been mulled as part of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008, though ultimately they were dropped before the Counter-Terrorism Bill was finalised. Last-minute concessions, as the Coroners and Justice Bill passed through Parliament, included giving the Lord Chief Justice the power to veto any requests for private inquests and also the power to decide who the judge is. Hate crimes reform The Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 amended Part 3A of the Public Order Act 1986 to extend hate crime legislation to cover \\"hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to sexual orientation (whether towards persons of the same sex, the opposite sex or both)\\". To prevent that Act being used to inhibit freedom of speech on the subject of homosexuality, the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act also inserted a new section 29JA, entitled \\"Protection of freedom of expression (sexual orientation)\\" but sometimes known as the Waddington Amendment (after Lord Waddington who introduced it). It reads: During debate on the Coroners and Justice Bill the Government unsuccessfully attempted to repeal section 29JA.Coroners and Justice Bill Clause 61 (which would have repealed section 29JA) was introduced into Parliament by Jack Straw on 14 January 2009. The clause was voted down by the House of Lords,Lords Amendments to the Coroners and Justice Bill (no. 59)Hansard, 9 July 2009ibid. reinstated by the House of Commons,Hansard, 9 November 2009 and voted down again by the LordsHansard, 11 November 2009 before the Commons finally conceded that section 29JA could remain.Hansard, 12 November 2009 Notable events with respect to the act In December 2012, owners of a family patio and paving business in Bedford were successfully prosecuted under the provision criminalising the holding of someone in slavery or servitude, or requiring them to perform forced or compulsory labour, between 2010 and 2011. The investigation of forced labour began after the body of one of the family's workers was discovered in 2008. The family found using vulnerable mentally ill, alcoholic, and homeless men for forced labour very profitable, holding some men in servitude for decades and paying them as little as £5 a day (the National Minimum Wage at the time was £5.80 per hour for an adult aged 21 or over).

Instead, it featured 14 new and now forgotten songs, written for the production by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse. The story was adapted by Andrew Birkin (who would subsequently become a leading Barrie scholar) and Jack Burns. Although it was an American production with two American stars, most of the cast was British.

Although born and educated in England, he moved to America in 1873 shortly after his second marriage and lived there for the rest of his life, carrying out charitable works. Life Henry Pellew was born on 26 April 1828 in Canterbury, Kent, England.U.S. Passport application, 1891. His father, George Pellew, who was Dean of Norwich, was the third son of Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth, a British admiral who saw action in the American War of Independence and the Napoleonic Wars. Henry was his only son. His mother was Frances Addington, a daughter of Viscount Sidmouth. Pellew was educated at Eton College, before studying at Trinity College, Cambridge, obtaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1850. Whilst at Cambridge University, he won his \\"Blue\\" by rowing for the University Boat Club against Oxford in the Boat Race in 1849. He was one of the founders of Keble College, Oxford and served on the Council of the college from its foundation in 1870 until 1873. He was also a magistrate for the county of Middlesex, serving on the boards of various charities, hospitals and schools in and around London. He married, on 5 October 1858 in Bedford, New York, Eliza Jay, the daughter of a judge from New York and a descendant of John Jay, the Van Cortlandt family, the Livingston family, and the Schuyler family. She died in 1869 in England. They had three children: George who died in 1892; Charles, his eventual heir; and Violet an infant who died in 1870. On 14 May 1873 in Vienna, he married her youngest sister, Augusta Jay, a marriage that was not recognised as valid at that time in English law. In the same year (possibly because of this, suggested his obituary in The Times) he moved to New York City, and later to Washington, D.C. He became a naturalised citizen of the United States on 25 September 1877.Duplicate copy of the U.S. Naturalization Certificate of Henry Pellew, 1877. One daughter, Marion, was born to this marriage. Pellew carried on working for various good causes in America, as he had in England, even after his ninetieth birthday. He helped to organise the Bureau of Charities in New York, working with the future President Theodore Roosevelt. He helped to set up coffee houses for poor people, a free lending library, and night shelters, as well as helping improve housing conditions. He was President of the Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor and of the St George Society, an Anglo-American group in New York; he also belonged to the Society for Sanitary Reform and the School Commission. He helped with the plans for Washington National Cathedral. In August 1922, Edward Pellew, 5th Viscount Exmouth, a distant cousin, died without descendants and his titles (Viscount Exmouth and two other titles earlier created for the 1st Viscount, namely Baron Exmouth and a baronetcy) passed to Pellew as the closest male relative. He attempted to renounce the peerage (the U.S. Constitution prohibits any \\"person holding any office of profit or trust under them\\" from \\"without the consent of the Congress, accept[ing] any . . . title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.\\"U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 9.) in favour of his son Charles Pellew, but was told by the British Embassy in Washington that this was not possible. In any event, he preferred to remain known as \\"Mr Henry Edward Pellew\\" rather than use the title of Viscount. He died in Washington on 4 February 1923, funeral services were held at St. John's Church on 7 February 1923, and he was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.Find A Grave, Henry Edward Pellew A memorial plaque was erected in St. James Church in Christow, Devon, England. It states in part, \\"Kind, wise, and generous, he never forgot his duty to his neighbour, and wherever he lived, he made the community happier and better for his presence and his influence.\\" He was succeeded in his titles by his son, Charles Pellew, a former professor of chemistry at Columbia University.

It was broadcast on ITV over two series in 1978 and 1979. It was produced by Southern Television in 26 half-hour episodes.  Cast  * Michele Gallagher as George * Marcus Harris as Julian * Gary Russell as Dick * Jennifer Thanisch as Anne * Toddy (a border collie) as Timmy the Dog * Michael Hinz as Uncle Quentin * Sue Best as Aunt Fanny * Friedrich von Thun as Rogers  Production  Production for the series began in 1977, with filming commencing during the summer of that year. The series was produced by Southern Television in a co-production with a German company. The episodes were recorded on location and on film (rather than the more usual video tape), making it the most expensive children's television series ever produced at that point. Each story was adapted from one of the original novels and featured the same main characters; George, Julian, Dick, Anne and Timmy the dog. The first series was produced by Don Leaver, while the second was produced by Sidney Hayers. The executive producer was James Gatward. The stories were adapted for television by a number of writers and directors and starred many notable actors in guest appearances including Patrick Troughton, Cyril Luckham, Brenda Cowling, Geoffrey Bayldon, Brian Glover, Ronald Fraser and an early appearance by Rupert Graves. The television scripts were amended slightly from the books to give them a contemporary, 1970s setting. Of the original 21 novels, three were never adapted; Five on a Treasure Island and Five Have a Mystery to Solve because the Children's Film Foundation still had the film and TV rights to the books, while Five Have Plenty of Fun didn't fit in the production schedule. Due to the success of the series, Southern Television were keen to make another season of episodes, but the Enid Blyton estate forbade them to create original stories. One criticism of the series was that many of the episodes featured scenes set at night-time which were badly lit to the point that it was difficult to see what was happening. These scenes were actually shot in daylight, but a heavy filter was placed over the camera to give the impression of darkness. The series was filmed mostly on location in the New Forest and partly in Christchurch, with many of the indoor scenes filmed in Exbury House, where the house doubled as many different dwellings. The titles song was the only original composition by Rob Andrews (music) and Les Spurr (Lyrics). The Incidental Music was mainly taken from library music produced by labels like Bruton Music and KPM Music. We can hear music composed by Brian Bennett, Steve Gray, Keith Mansfield, John Cameron, John Scott, Alan Hawkshaw, Duncan Lamont, Andrew Jackman, Les Hurdle, Frank Ricotti, Richard Hill, Paul Martin, Francis Monkman. Most of the music used in the series are from \\"Drama Montage\\" vol 1 & 2 by Brian Bennett  Broadcast  The Famous Five was first broadcast on ITV on Monday 3 July 1978 at 4:45 pm. This was a year after it had been filmed and during production of the second series. The first episode was Five Go to Kirren Island (an incorrect spelling for Kirrin Island), although it was not the first episode filmed (Five Go to Mystery Moor). The first series proved popular and, to capitalise on its success, the first six episodes of the second series (which had been filmed in the summer of 1978) were broadcast on Sundays in November and December. The remaining seven episodes of the second series were broadcast on Wednesdays from June to August 1979 (again, a year after production). The Famous Five was sold to many overseas countries such as Ireland (where it was repeated in 1981, 1983 and 1985), Canada and Australia and was dubbed into many languages for the European market such as German (the series having been part-financed by a German company), French, Italian and Spanish. The series made its Australian debut on ABC television on Tuesday, 22nd May at 5:30pm, with the remainder of the first series screened on weekday evenings from that date. Thus the entire first series had been screened by early June. The second series premiered in Australia, again on ABC, on Tue 4th March, 1980 at 5.00pm, as part of an afternoon line-up of children's programming, with new episodes following weekly. Episodes from both series were regularly repeated in similar afternoon time-slots on the ABC in the early to mid 1980s, before moving to a morning time-slot. The series was still being repeated as late as 1989. The series spawned many merchandise items such as jigsaws and annuals, while Look- in magazine ran a picture-strip story each week for nearly two years. The theme music (contrary to popular belief, not sung by the cast but by the Corona Stage Academy choir) was released as a single in 1978, but failed to chart. The scriptwriters who adapted Enid Blyton's books for the first series (of thirteen episodes) were Richard Sparks, Gail Renard, Richard Carpenter and Gloria Tors.

These have been widely dismissed by fans of the original books, however. The four starring actors met up again in 1980 for a newspaper story on their progressing careers. By this time, only Gary Russell was continuing an acting career and he, too, soon gave it up. This was the last time the four met up although Russell, Harris and Thanisch did meet up in 1990, again in 2010 for the German DVD release of the entire series, for a radio interview in 2011, and for The One Show in 2017. * Jenny Thanisch (b. 24 April 1964) is now a mother and works as a school teacher in the south of England. * Gary Russell (b. 18 September 1963) gave up acting in the mid-1980s to concentrate on writing, as well as being the editor of several magazines. He was the script editor on the successful 2005 revival of Doctor Who. * Marcus Harris (b. 19 April 1964) embarked on a number of business ventures and later became a town councillor. Harris returned in a small cameo role in a German film based on the series titled Fünf Freunde 2 (literally \\"Five Friends 2\\", as by the German title for the series), which was released on 31 January 2013.Presseportal.de: \\"Famous Five II: SamFilm Making a Film of the Most Famous Friends in the World!

In 1996 the books were revived again for another British television adaptation. This time, unlike the 1970s series, it was set in the 1950s.Aggedor - The Famous Five, 1996 series More recently, an animated version was made by the French company Marathon, which featured the children of the Famous Five. For many years, the series was not released on DVD due to confusion as to who owns the rights to the television episodes, as well as complexities with the Enid Blyton estate. However, in October 2010, distributor Koch Media remastered the whole series and released it in Germany on Region 2 in a seven-disc DVD set (and on three Blu-ray Discs, respectively) with extensive bonus material including an interview with original cast members and their German counterparts who provided the voices for the German dubbed version.e.g. Fünf Freunde 1978/79 TV-Serie kommt jetzt auf DVD und Blu-ray France followed in November 2011 with two 3-DVD sets (but only with the French dubbed version and no bonus material), whilst the complete series was finally released on DVD in the UK in June 2012 by Koch Media. A new 45-minute interview (recorded earlier in 2012) with the original cast is featured on one of the Series 1 DVDs. The series saw a previous DVD release in Australia in 2005 by Reel Corporation, when the company released this version with images from the 1995-1997 version (the \\"Five on a Treasure Island\\" episode from that version was also included). The set was soon corrected (as a \\"revised edition\\") with images from the 1978 series, and reissued again in 2011.

Between 1992 and 1993 and 1995–96 the Irish Exiles entered the IRFU Interprovincial Championship. The Irish Exiles also acts as an academy system for players from the Irish diaspora who wish to play for the men's national team and other IRFU national teams including the women's national team, the men's sevens team and the women's sevens team. History Early years The Irish Exiles organisation was originally established by Tom Kiernan in 1989 following a meeting in London. The aim of the Irish Exiles was to give Irish diaspora players wishing to represent the Ireland national rugby union team the opportunity to play for a representative team. The Irish Exiles subsequently became a formal sub-committee of the Irish Rugby Football Union. Kiernan became the first chairman of the Exiles organisation. His successors included Barry O'Driscoll. The Exiles would eventually become a full branch of the IRFU. In addition to establishing a senior representative team, the Exiles also established under 21 and student teams. During their first two seasons the Exiles played friendlies against Ulster at Ravenhill and a Welsh Exiles XV. The first senior XV coach was Ken Kennedy. An under 21/student team also played the Ireland U21s at the London Irish ground in Sunbury-on-Thames. During the 1992–93 season an Irish Exiles XV also played an away friendly against the Basque Country national rugby union team. IRFU Interprovincial Championship Between 1992 and 1993 and 1995–96 the Irish Exiles entered the IRFU Interprovincial Championship. Before this Irish diaspora players, including Jim Staples, Simon Geoghegan and John O'Driscoll were usually invited to represent Connacht in the championship. Staples and Geoghegan subsequently represented the Exiles and O'Driscoll coached the team. Other Ireland internationals to represent the Exiles in the championship included David Curtis, Gary Halpin and Rob Saunders. Mat Keenan, a Western Samoa international also played for the Exiles in the competition. Academy The Irish Exiles operates as a scouting and recruitment programme for Irish diaspora players interested in playing for the Ireland national rugby union team, the Ireland women's national rugby union team, the Ireland national rugby sevens team and the Ireland women's national rugby sevens team. In addition to producing nearly thirty Ireland men's internationals, the Exiles programme has also produced three British and Irish Lions – Simon Easterby, Rob Henderson and Nick Popplewell. A number of Irish Exiles players have \\"slipped through the net\\" and have subsequently gone on to play for the England national rugby union team. These include Kieran Brookes, Paul Doran- Jones and Shane Geraghty. Recent graduates of the programme include Sammy Arnold and Kieran Marmion. Women's team The Irish Exiles also field a women's rugby union team. A number of prominent members of the Ireland women's national rugby union team have progressed through the Exiles programme. These include Sophie Spence and Claire Molloy.

She writes for The Washington Post mostly about economics, finance, and government policy. She began her writing career with a blog, \\"Live From The WTC,\\" started in November 2001. In 2003 The Economist hired her to write for their website, and since then she has worked full-time as a journalist and editor, both online and in print. McArdle is currently an opinion writer for The Washington Post. Other publications she has worked for include The Atlantic, Newsweek/The Daily Beast, and Bloomberg View. She has also published book reviews and opinion pieces in the New York Post, The New York Sun, Reason, The Guardian, and Salon.  Early life and education  McArdle was born and raised in New York City. Her father, Francis X. McArdle, was former managing director of the GCA (General Contractors Association of New York)GCA is an advocacy group for the construction and concrete industry of New York City, describing itself on its website as dedicated \\"to promoting infrastructure investment, private development, fair contract provisions, enhanced bidding opportunities, and a safe work environment\\" for the industry. during the Koch, Dinkins, and Giuliani administrations. Her mother, Joan McArdle, was a real estate broker for Prudential Douglas Elliman. McArdle attended high school at Riverdale Country School. Afterwards, she graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, where she received a B.A. in English literature. She then earned an MBA from University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. During her junior year of college, she worked as a canvasser for the Public Interest Research Groups, the nonprofit founded by Ralph Nader. Her experience there hurried along her \\"transition from ultraliberal to libertarian.\\" The organization was, she later wrote, \\"the most deceptive, evil place I've ever worked.\\"  Career  Christopher Hayes at a NY Salon discussion Dave Weigel called McArdle \\"the original blogger-turned-MSM journo\\".Twitter / daveweigel: One odd thing about that NYT In 2012, David Brooks called McArdle one of the most influential bloggers on the right. McArdle began blogging in November 2001 with a blog named \\"Live From The WTC,\\" which arose from her employment with a construction firm involved in cleanup at the World Trade Center site following the September 11 attacks. She wrote under the pen name \\"Jane Galt,\\" playing on the name \\"John Galt,\\" a central character in Ayn Rand's Objectivist novel Atlas Shrugged. In November 2002 she renamed the site \\"Asymmetrical Information,\\" a reference to the economics term of the same name. That blog had two other occasional contributors, Zimran Ahmed (writing under the pen name \\"Winterspeak\\"), and the pseudonymous \\"Mindles H. Dreck.\\" McArdle gained some online attention in May 2003 for coining what she termed \\"Jane's Law\\" in a blog post discussing political behaviors. The law, written with regard to the two main U.S. political parties, Republicans and Democrats, reads: \\"The devotees of the party in power are smug and arrogant. The devotees of the party out of power are insane.\\" Another post by McArdle, from April 2005, discusses why she takes no position on the issue of same-sex marriage. She wrote: \\"All I'm asking for is for people to think more deeply than a quick consultation of their imaginations to make that decision... This humility is what I want from liberals when approaching market changes; now I'm asking it from my side [libertarians], in approaching social ones.\\" In 2003 McArdle was hired by The Economist to write for their website, in the \\"Countries\\" and \\"News\\" sections, and in October 2006 she founded The Economists \\"Free Exchange\\" blog. In August 2007 McArdle left The Economist and moved to Washington, D.C., to work as a full-time blogger for The Atlantic, keeping \\"Asymmetrical Information\\" as her blog's name.\\"McArdle Leaves The Economist For The Atlantic\\" FishBowlDC In 2009, she criticized an article in Playboy by eXile Online editors Mark Ames and Yasha Levine which detailed the influence of the Koch brothers in American and Tea Party politics. Playboy took down the article as a result of the negative response. Megan McArdle in 2010 By 2010, McArdle had also become The Atlantics business and economics editor. In February 2010, her blog lost the title \\"Asymmetrical Information,\\" as The Atlantic switched to having every blog (except Andrew Sullivan's The Daily Dish) be identified solely by its author. She was a Bernard L. Schwartz fellow at the public policy think tank New America. In June 2012, McArdle left The Atlantic, and began writing for Newsweek/The Daily Beast.\\"Farewell\\" , June 10, 2012 In June 2013, McArdle announced that she was departing Newsweek to join Bloomberg View as a columnist. McArdle is an occasional television and radio commentator, having appeared on The Kudlow Report,\\"End of the Recession?\\", The Kudlow Report, October 29, 2009 Fareed Zakaria GPS,\\"Sunday Show Preview\\" FishbowlDCFareed Zakaria GPS Transcript , CNN, March 22, 2009 and American Public Media's Marketplace.\\"Weekly Wrap: Another bubble?\\" , Marketplace, November 13, 2009. McArdle joined The Washington Post as an opinion columnist in March 2018.  Views  McArdle has described herself as a \\"right-leaning libertarian.\\" David Brooks categorized her as part of a group of bloggers who \\"start from broadly libertarian premises but do not apply them in a doctrinaire way.\\"  Ron Paul  McArdle has been critical of the libertarian politician Ron Paul, taking him to task for not strongly disavowing racist statements that appeared in his newsletters,Megan McArdle (January 8, 2010) \\"Ron Paul roundup\\" , The Atlantic. arguing against his championing of tax credits, and accusing him of lacking specificity about cutting government spending.Ron Paul on taxes , Megan McArdle, December 28, 2007 McArdle was also quoted as saying that Ron Paul \\"doesn't understand anything about monetary policy,\\" and that \\"he wastes all of his time on the House Financial Services Committee ranting crazily.\\"Weigel, David (December 10, 2010), \\"Congratulations! Now Shut Up.: Why Ron Paul's newfound power both pleases and worries libertarians.\\" , Slate  U.S. automotive bailout  In late 2008, McArdle wrote extensively against a proposed federal bailout of the U.S. auto industry (which ultimately occurred in early 2009). In November 2008, various of McArdle's blog posts on the subject were quoted approvingly by conservative commentators David Brooks,David Brooks (November 18, 2008), \\"Bailout to Nowhere\\" , The New York Times Michael BaroneMichael Barone (November 15, 2008), Detroit Automakers a Relic of the Past , Human Events and John Podhoretz,John Podhoretz (November 11, 2008), \\"Bailouts Necessary and Unnecessary\\" , Commentary among others.  Nationalized health care  Since 2009, McArdle has argued extensively against instituting a system of national health insurance in the United States, and specifically against the federal health care reform bill the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law in March 2010. In addition to a number of blog posts on the subject, she also wrote an article, \\"Myth Diagnosis,\\" in the March 2010 Atlantic.Megan McArdle (March 2010) Myth Diagnosis , The Atlantic In a July 2009 blog post, McArdle listed two reasons that she objected to such a system: first, that it would stifle innovation, because \\"Monopolies are not innovative, whether they are public or private,\\" and second, that \\"Once the government gets into the business of providing our health care, the government gets into the business of deciding whose life matters, and how much.\\"Megan McArdle (July 28, 2009), A Long, Long Post About My Reasons For Opposing National Health Care , The Atlantic Commentator Ezra Klein of The Washington Post criticized this post, writing, \\"In 1,600 words, she doesn't muster a single link to a study or argument, nor a single number that she didn't make up (what numbers do exist come in the form of thought experiments and assumptions). Megan's argument against national health insurance boils down to a visceral hatred of the government.\\" In an August 2009 post, McArdle reiterated, \\"My objection is primarily, as I've said numerous times, that the government will destroy innovation. It will do this by deciding what constitutes an acceptable standard of care, and refusing to fund treatment above that. It will also start controlling prices.\\"Megan McArdle (August 13, 2009) \\"What Does It Mean To Have a Private Health Care System\\" , The Atlantic In a comment to that post, McArdle stated, \\"The United States currently provides something like 80–90% of the profits on new drugs and medical devices. Perhaps you think you can slash profits 80% with no effect on the behavior of the companies that make these products. I don't.\\" In a subsequent Washington Post online chat, a commenter asked her, \\"You said that medical innovation will be wiped out if we have a type of national health care, because European drug companies get 80% of their revenue from Americans. Where did you get this statistic?\\" McArdle responded that it was \\"a hypothetical, not a statistic.\\" This was criticized in a blog post in The New Republic.\\"Megan McArdle's Word Games\\" The New Republic In response to this criticism, McArdle stated that she had misunderstood the question, and \\"thought the commenter was referring to the postulated hypothetical destruction of all US profits.\\" She also stated that, though \\"there are no hard numbers available,\\" she estimated that the U.S. contribution to pharmaceutical profits was at least 60%.Megan McArdle (September 2, 2009), Does the US Really Account for So Much Pharma Profit? , The Atlantic The article \\"Myth Diagnosis\\" was quoted approvingly by conservative writer Timothy P. Carney of The San Francisco Examiner.Timothy P. Carney (February 28, 2011), \\"Turns out ObamaCare might not save hundreds of thousands of lives\\" , The San Francisco Examiner – Beltway Confidential (blog)  Heartland Institute document controversy  In 2012, Peter Gleick of the Pacific Institute claimed he had received \\"an anonymous document in the mail describing what appeared to be details of the Heartland Institute's climate program strategy\\" to discredit global warming, and distributed what he claimed to be a Heartland \\"Strategy Memo\\"Gleick, P. H. (February 20, 2012), \\"The Origin of the Heartland Documents\\" , The Huffington Post. In a series of posts in February 2012, McArdle argued that the alleged Heartland memo circulated by Gleick was faked.  Personal life  McArdle married Peter Suderman, an associate editor for the libertarian magazine Reason, in 2010. She was a vegan for a year in 2008, which she ended due to the diet complicating management of her previously diagnosed Hashimoto's thyroiditis.McArdle, Megan (31 July 2008), \\"The end of an era\\" .

The winery distributes 200,000 cases of wine per year in 19 states. The vineyards are composed of of Catawba, Vignoles, Chardonel, Concord, Norton, Chambourcin, Seyval and Rougeon grapes. The winemaking heritage of the area was both started and subsequently influenced by Italian Immigrants in the late 19th century. The company has over 50 employees working in the Cellar, Administration, Tasting Room, Shipping and Vineyard departments. The winery distributes in nine U.S. states, mostly in the Midwestern and Southern portions of the country.  History  The St. James Winery was opened in 1970 by Jim and Pat Hofherr. In its first year of business, the winery produced over of wine or roughly 3,400 cases. Included was two of their wine types, Velvet Red and Velvet White. All four of the Hofherr children worked alongside their mother and father, helping to establish and grow the business. The Hofherr sons, Andrew and John, reclaimed their spots in the family business in the late 1980s. Andrew returned in 1987 to manage the family vineyard after studying viticulture at the University of Arkansas. John spent his time of absence earning his winemaking degree from California State University, Fresno, and spending 5 years working for Jekel Winery in Monterey California. In 1988, John returned as head winemaker. Both of the brothers brought new updated viticulture and winemaking techniques to the winery, increasing quality and production. After Jim Hofherr's death in 1994, the second generation had taken over the reins of the winery. Another son, Peter, joined the team in 1995 as general manager, with a BS in microbiology and a Master's in Business Administration. In order to accommodate for the new growth of demand, the company underwent several major vineyard, cellar and warehouse expansions over the course of the late 1990s to early 2000s. Peter Hofherr left the winery yet again to join in the ranks of public service, eventually becoming Director of Agriculture for the state of Missouri. Andrew Meggit joined the winery team as assistant winemaker in 2002, but after John returned to California to pursue his own bottling line business, Andrew became the new head winemaker. Another newcomer, Dean Chalem, started in 2004 as the VP of sales and continues to manage the winery's wholesaler network.

It aids in both, the validation of existing geographical information and the collection of new geographical information through crowdsourcing.See, L., Mooney, P., Foody, G., Bastin, L., Comber, A., Estima, J., Fritz, S., Kerle, N., Jiang, B., Laakso, M., Liu, H.-Y., Milcinski, G., Niksic, M., Painho, M., Podör, A., Olteanu- Raimond, A.-M. and Rutzinger, M. (2016) Crowdsourcing, Citizen Science or Volunteered Geographic Information? The Current State of Crowdsourced Geographic Information. ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information, 5 (5). p. 55. Using tools such as Google Earth, Bing Maps, Geotagged photographs and the Internet, individual volunteers are able to contribute valuable information on land cover and land use, either by validating existing data in comparing it with satellite imagery (through visual interpretation), or by collecting new data. Except on the conventional way, other method for crowd- sourced data collection in Geo-Wiki is through campaigns and games, used as incentives to motivate citizens. Gathered information in the platform is freely available.  Land cover validation  Land cover disagreement over Africa in croplands and forests available for analysis in Geo-wiki Global land cover validation exercises are feasible as images less than 2.5 meter resolution provide very detailed information on land cover with global coverage of at least 20%Potere, D.

Internet tools such as Google Earth offer enormous potential for land cover validation.Butler, D. The web-wide world. Nature 2006, 439, 776-778 The use of Volunteer Geographic Information for land cover validation studies seems even more relevant as Google Earth has been used for the recent validation of remote sensing derived products e.g., the European forest cover mapPekkarinen, A.; Reithmaier, L.; Strobl, P.

Applications of Geo-Wiki go beyond simply improving land cover. An application helps to predict future deforestation in Central Africa, combining five existing cropland data sets from sub-Saharan Africa to create a new map which has higher accuracy than existing maps. This should reduce uncertainty and improve predictions in land use, vegetation, climate change, and earth systems modeling. Scientists from several research institutions describe development of the map in Geophysical Research Letters, along with the application of Geo- Wiki.  Gamification  The Geo-Wiki ecosystem comprises of a number of applications, some of which use gamification mechanisms to attract and motivate citizen scientists and experts to participate in campaigns and make valuable contributions to science.

Jim Bolger has held this distinction since Bill Rowling's death on 31 October 1995 a record so far. He surpassed the previous record held by Robert Stout on 24 November 2018. Robert Stout became the oldest living prime minister when John Hall died in 1907 and remained so until his death in 1930, for 23 years and 24 days. John Hall became the oldest living prime minister after the death of George Waterhouse, but he survived Waterhouse by only 323 days. On one occasion the oldest living prime minister lost this distinction not by his death, but due to the appointment of a prime minister who was older. Sidney Holland ceased to be the oldest living prime minister when Walter Nash was appointed. John Hall was the oldest to acquire this distinction at the age of 81 years, and 231 days. Francis Bell, who was 84 years, and 348 days old when he died, was the oldest prime minister to die without ever acquiring this distinction. Mike Moore, who died on 2 February 2020 at 71 years, and 5 days old is the most recent prime minister to die without ever acquiring this distinction. { class=\\"sortable wikitable\\" - !align=\\"center\\" Prime Minister !align=\\"center\\" Became oldest living prime minister !align=\\"center\\" Ceased to be oldest living prime minister !align=\\"center\\" Age at start date !align=\\"center\\" Age at end date !align=\\"center\\" Duration (years, days) - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" Henry Sewell      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" Alfred Domett      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" William Fox      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" George Grey      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" Edward Stafford      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" George Waterhouse      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" John Hall      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" Robert Stout      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" William Hall-Jones      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" George Forbes      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" Peter Fraser      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" Sidney Holland      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" Walter Nash      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" Keith Holyoake      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" Jack Marshall      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" Robert Muldoon      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" Bill Rowling      - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" Jim Bolger  Current oldest living prime minister  Current oldest living prime minister  - style=\\"text-align: center; background:#FFFFFF\\" - class=\\"sortbottom\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" !align=\\"center\\" Prime Minister !align=\\"center\\" Became oldest living prime minister !align=\\"center\\" Ceased to be oldest living prime minister !align=\\"center\\" Age at start date !align=\\"center\\" Age at end date !align=\\"center\\" Duration (years, days) } See also * List of prime ministers of New Zealand by date of birth * List of prime ministers of New Zealand by place of birth * Living prime ministers of New Zealand Notes New Zealand Prime Ministers Age New Zealand Prime Ministers Prime ","title":"List of prime ministers of New Zealand by age"},{"id":"25182469","text":"The GN & C Stock was operated on the Great Northern and City Railway, an underground railway line in London, England. It was opened between Moorgate and Finsbury Park on 14 February 1904. The original GN&C; Stock operated on the line between 1904 and 1939. Construction The line was operated by electric multiple unit trains from the outset. The initial rolling stock were 77 carriages intended to form 11 seven carriage trains. In practice six carriage trains were operated. They used a multiple unit control system known as the Sprague-Thomson-Houston system. Power was supplied for the line from a power station in Poole Street, which was later converted into the film studios of Gainsborough Pictures. The electrical equipment for the line - including the rolling stock - was ordered from the British Thomson Houston company, which subcontracted the building of the trains to Brush of Loughborough and the Electric Railway Tramway & Carriage works of Preston. The majority of the carriages were of teak bodywork, although eighteen carriages built by Brush were wooden framed with steel panelling. The carriages were built to a main line loading gauge (unlike the smaller profile of trains on the Northern line and other tube lines). A single sliding door was provided in the middle of each carriage. Gates were provided at the carriage ends. The line (and the trains) were acquired by the Metropolitan Railway in 1913, which became part of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933. Replacement and successors The trains were replaced by Northern line tube trains on 15 May 1939 and all the original GN&C; stock was scrapped. As part of the 1935–1940 New Works Plan, the London Passenger Transport Board aimed to integrate the Great Northern and City line into the Northern line, extending to Alexandra Palace and Bushey Heath. These plans were curtailed by World War II and the Northern City line (or \\"Highbury Branch\\") continued operating with 1938 Stock until 1975, when the line was transferred to British Rail. Between 1976 and 2019 the line was operated exclusively by British Rail Class 313 electric multiple units, which were replaced by Great Northern Class 717 trains from 2018. References *J.

His active career was cut short by serious injury in 1813, and he then concentrated on his inventions and innovations in naval technology. He commanded a naval gunnery school in the late 1830s, before being retired in 1846. Biography Family background Tayler was born in Devizes, Wiltshire, the youngest son of Samuel Tayler and Sally Needham. His father was a senior member of the Corporation of Devizes, served six times as Mayor, and also formed and commanded the Devizes Loyal Volunteers. His mother was the daughter of Joseph Needham, surgeon and man-midwife, and the niece of Henry Needham, a co-partner with his uncle, Robert Rogers, in the bank of Child & Co. His eldest brother, also Samuel, was a lieutenant in the 13th Light Dragoons, and was killed in Portugal; another brother, Thomas, was a major in the Bengal 9th Native Infantry, and died in India. Early naval career Tayler entered the navy in July 1796 as a first-class volunteer on board the 100-gun ship , flagship of Lord Bridport in the Channel Fleet, under the command of Captain William Domett. In April–May 1797 he was present in her at the Spithead mutiny. In 1799 he moved to the razee frigate , Captain Philip Charles Durham, which was occasionally employed attending the Royal Family off Weymouth, and was in waiting upon the King in a boat whenever he went afloat. On 27 April 1800 he assisted in the capture of the letter of marque Vainqueur from Bordeaux bound for St. Domingo, and two days afterwards, in the capture of the 18-gun privateer Hardi, which was in company with the 18-gun Guepe, and the 36-gun Braave and Druide. Tayler was also employed in landing arms at Quimper, and in otherwise aiding the French royalists. On 27 June 1800, while escorting a fleet of transport ships from Gibraltar and Minorca, Anson captured seven merchant vessels on the Spanish coast between Tarifa and Algeciras, even though they were protected by shore batteries and covered by the fire of 25 heavy gunboats. She also drove two gunboats, each mounting two long 18-pounders and eight smaller guns, onto the coast, where Tayler, in a boat, assisted in taking possession of one of them – the crew having abandoned ship. He then followed Captain Durham into the 40-gun frigate , visited Saint Helena and Lisbon, and took part in the capture of the 14-gun French cutter- privateer Furie on 13 April 1801. Lieutenant Tayler was promoted to lieutenant on 29 April 1802, and on 18 October 1803 he was appointed to the 50-gun fourth-rate , serving in her under Captains James Nicoll Morris, Francis William Austen, and Richard Raggett. Leopard was part of the squadron stationed off Boulogne during Napoleon's planned invasion, and Tayler assisted in the capture of seven French gun-vessels. In October 1804 he was present at the Raid on Boulogne when the British used Robert Fulton's catamaran-torpedoes in an attempt to attack the French invasion fleet. On 30 March 1806 Leopard sailed from St Helens, Isle of Wight, with orders to escort six Indiamen as far as the Cape Verde islands. At 2 a.m. on 20 April one of the convoy, the Lady Burgess, struck Laten's Level, a rocky reef near Santiago. At daylight it was seen that her masts had fallen, and that the sea was breaking over her. Tayler volunteered to take a boat to her assistance. He contrived to throw a block attached to a rope over the stump of her bowsprit, and rescued 21 people before she broke up; nine more people were rescued from the sea. Two of the Indiaman's boats had already escaped with the captain and several others aboard; but 38 were lost. On 19 August 1806 Tayler transferred to the under Captain Richard Raggett, for passage home from Halifax, Nova Scotia. On 16 March 1807 he joined the 74-gun , under Captain Samuel Hood Linzee, and took part in the expedition against Copenhagen. During the siege of the city he commanded a party of seamen ashore, manning a battery. On the return of the fleet to England he was employed, as first lieutenant of Maida, removing masts and stores from the captured Danish ships. In mid-1808 (a few months after the Maida was paid off) he joined the , flagship of Rear-Admiral Robert Stopford on the blockade of the coast of France, serving as first lieutenant. At one point Tayler was sent ashore at Quimper to distribute propaganda placards proclaiming the British victories in Spain. Spencer was paid off at Plymouth in January 1809. On 12 April 1809 Tayler joined the frigate Heroine, Captain Hood Hanway Christian, and took part in the Walcheren Campaign. He was present at the forcing of the batteries between Flushing and Cadzand on 11 August 1809, prior to joining in the attack on Flushing. He left Heroine after only seven months, and on 12 June 1810 he joined the brig , Captain Arden Adderley, operating off the north coast of Spain. Commander On 27 August 1810 Tayler was promoted to commander aboard the 16-gun , and sailed for the West Indies aboard the sloop , eventually joining his ship on 2 February 1811. Sparrow spent several months on anti-piracy patrol in the Mona Passage, before returning to England in company with the brig , escorting a fleet of merchant ships. During the voyage they recaptured a large ship laden with colonial produce. He then returned to the northern coast of Spain where he was engaged in surveying various harbours, particularly Saint-Jean-de-Luz, and gathering intelligence on the strength of the French garrisons along the Biscay coast. During the winter of 1811-1812 Sparrow was stationed off Cape Matxitxako, and captured a French letter of marque, and also a brig laden with cotton and rice. In June 1812 Tayler took part in the reduction of Lekeitio, and then in the destruction of enemy fortifications at Bermeo, Plentzia, Galea, Algorta, Begoña, El Campillo las Quersas, Xebiles, and Castro. In July, he took part in the attacks upon Puerta Galletta and Getaria. He then twice forced a passage between the fortress of San Salvador de Hano and the Isla de Mouro at the entrance of the Bay of Santander, and also made a reconnaissance of Santoña, Getaria, and Hondarribia. Tayler also submitted a plan to Commodore Sir Home Riggs Popham for a surprise attack on the batteries along the Bidasoa River and destroying the bridge at Irun. On 21 March 1813 Sparrow captured the American ship Oneida, and on 31 March captured the Lightning. In early May 1813, Sir George Collier commander of the British squadron operating on the north coast of Spain, sent the brig-sloops , Commander Robert Bloye; , Commander James Bremer, and Sparrow, Commander Tayler, to assist the Spanish at the town of Castro Urdiales, which was under siege from a force of 13,000 French troops. The British ships arrived there on 4 May, landing guns and manning batteries for the defence of the town, whose garrison numbered no more that 1,200. Tayler used an improved gunsight, of his own design, which combined elevation and line of sight in one focus, and enabled him to fire shells with such precision that two out of every three burst in the French batteries. Despite this, by the morning of the 11th the French gun batteries had made a practicable breach in the town's walls, and the British were compelled to re-embark their guns and men, and prepare for a retreat. At 9 p.m. the French launched their assault via the breach and by escalade, forcing the Spanish defenders to retreat street by street to the castle, from where they were evacuated. The British were able to take about 1,150 men of the garrison to Bermeo. Castro Urdiales was then blockaded, until on 22 June the French were forced out, and Tayler promptly garrisoned the castle. At Lekeitio, on the night of 10 June 1813, Sparrow and the brig brought off 1,270 Spanish troops, who were closely pursued by a superior enemy force. In late June Sparrow conveyed the British staff officer John Fremantle to England with the despatches announcing the victory at the battle of Vitoria, before returning to Spain. Tayler came close to death or serious injury twice; at Plentzia, during the destruction of the fort by explosives, he narrowly avoided several tons of falling masonry, and later at Castro Urdiales he was pointing a carronade, when it was struck by a 12-pound shot, causing considerable damage. Tayler insisted on continuing to load and fire the gun despite fears that it would burst. However his luck finally ran out on 24 July 1813 during the Siege of San Sebastián, when he was ordered, with the other small vessels of the squadron, to conduct a diversionary attack on the north side of Mount Urgull. During the operation a shell hit the battery Tayler was commanding, and he was injured in the head and groin, and his left leg was shattered. Tayler was taken back to the naval hospital at Plymouth where his leg was saved, but he was confined to hospital for seven months, and it was more than two years before he was completely recovered. Post-war career In recognition of his services and injuries Tayler was promoted to post- captain on 16 August 1813. On 12 November 1814 he was awarded a yearly pension of £200, increased on 2 December 1815 to £250, and was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 8 December 1815. He was also presented with the sum of £100 by the Patriotic Society, and the Corporation of Devizes presented him with the freedom of the borough. Tayler applied to the Admiralty several times for a command at sea, but was politely turned down each time. In 1816 he requested a ship to take part on the Bombardment of Algiers, and a few years later, citing his local knowledge of the coast, offered his services during the political turmoil in Portugal. In April 1828 another application stated the \\"he was in the prime of life, quite recovered from his wounds, and ready for any service or climate\\". In August 1831 in a request to Sir James Graham, he noted that \\"if the crew of a frigate was required, he could obtain volunteers to man one with dispatch\\". The same month he offered his services as flag captain to Sir Philip Durham, under whom he had served as a midshipman. Durham replied in friendly terms, but also reminded him that 20 years service as captain as considered necessary to command a first rate. Tayler's persistence and evident expertise eventually led to his final naval appointment, to the ship , where between July 1838 and August 1841 he established a naval gunnery school. On 16 November 1846 Tayler accepted retirement from the navy, and promotion to rear admiral with seniority dating from 1 October. On 17 May 1858 he was promoted to vice admiral, with seniority dating from 28 December 1855. Inventions Tayler was also an inventor and innovator. During the siege of Copenhagen in 1807 he improvised a new means of landing the ship's guns from boats, and also a gun carriage. In 1808 he devised an improved compass mounting. In 1811, while sailing home from the West Indies, he formulated a code of signals made by means of telegraphic shades instead of flags. In 1828 he submitted to the Prince Regent \\"A Plan of Internal Defence\\", and in November 1829 he sent to the Admiralty some remarks on the best mode of preventing \\"pestilential fevers\\", and offered his services to carry them out at Gibraltar. On 23 November 1831, Tayler sent to the Marquis of Lansdowne, then the Lord President of the Council, a plan for a Registry of Seamen, which would do away with the need for impressment. In 1838 he took out a patent on a new form of breakwater, and in 1840 another for improvements to steam vessels, and in 1843, in partnership with the civil engineer William Henry Smith, registered a patent for improvements in breakwaters, beacons, and sound alarms. He also invented a floating breakwater, and published a book On Naval Tactics and Gunnery. In 1840 Tayler published his Plans for the Formation of Harbours of Refuge, and in 1848 The Defence of the Coast of Great Britain. A model of his floating breakwater was displayed at The Great Exhibition of 1851, but appears to have had only moderate success in practice. In 1852 he submitted to Trinity House a proposal to erect a \\"Shipwreck Asylum\\" on the Goodwin Sands. Nothing came of this proposal, but a harbour of refuge seems to have been erected at Le Havre in 1855 in accordance with his suggestions. Innovations in naval gunnery Tayler was a regular correspondent with the Admiralty on the subject of his innovations in naval gunnery. In February 1815 he wrote concerning his improved gun-sight, which he had used with great effect during the defence of Castro Urdiales, and was informed that his \\"plans had been laid before the Board\\". In February 1822, he wrote again pointing out that Colonel Howard Douglas' work on naval gunnery, published in 1817, contained a design for new gun-sight that was very similar to his own, which he had used in 1812. In reply the Admiralty pointed out that Douglas' book \\"was not under the sanction of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty.\\" In January 1824 Tayler wrote to the Admiralty again this time with a model of an improved naval gun-carriage, which allowed all the guns of a broadside to be concentrated on a single point, and in January 1828 another with a design for an improved bomb vessel. In September 1829 he drew their attention to his various inventions, again offering to demonstrate them at his own expense. In December 1830 he wrote requesting acknowledgement as the inventor of the system of directing a broadside to a single point, following the demonstration of a similar system devised by a Mr. Kennish aboard . In January 1831 he reminded the Admiralty that he was asking for recognition not money, and in November the same year wrote \\"with some surprise and great regret\\", that a Captain Smith of the Royal Artillery was now being credited with the invention of a means of concentrating a ship's broadside to a single point. In February 1832 Tayler submitted another design and model for a traversing gun-carriage, which required half the number of men to work, and did away with the handspike, tackles, and crowbar used to train the gun. In reply he was informed that \\"their Lordships could not order any trial of his improved gun-carriage to be made at the expense of Government\\", to which he replied offering a trial at his own expense at Portsmouth. After this offer was again turned down, Tayler abandoned his correspondence with the Admiralty on the subject. His gun- carriage model was donated to the United Service Museum. Building Devizes After 1830 Tayler became a property developer in Devizes. He built new shops on the south-east side of the Brittox, new houses on the south side of Wine Street and in Long Street, a middle-class terrace in Bath Road, called Trafalgar Place, and, at the other end of the town, Southgate House and Villas. He was also a founder member of the Devizes Literary and Scientific Institution in 1833, and in October 1834, was presented with service of plate from the leading citizens of Devizes \\"in token of the high esteem they entertain for him, and in testimony of his active and independent exertions in promoting, upon all occasions, the prosperity of his native town, and the welfare of its inhabitants.\\" Tayler building projects do not seem to yielded much profit, as by February 1842 he was being held in the Queen's Bench Prison for debt, when an order was made by the Court for Relief of Insolvent Debtors assigning his estate and effects to the Provisional Assignee on the petition of his creditors. Death During the later part of his life Tayler resided in Brixton, South London, and died there on 18 March 1864.

We shall defend the citizens of Israel in good time and with all the means at our disposal.\\"Israeli and Iraqi Statements on Raid on Nuclear Plant, The New York Times, June 9, 1981 Two days after the attack in a dramatic press conference in Tel Aviv, Prime Minister Begin took full responsibility for the operation, praised its execution as extraordinary, and justified it both on moral and legal grounds. Begin referred to the strike as an act of \\"anticipatory self-defense at its best.\\" The message Begin conveyed was that the raid on Osirak was not a one-time operation, but rather a long-term national commitment. He ended his press conference with these words: :\\"We chose this moment: now, not later, because later may be too late, perhaps forever. And if we stood by idly, two, three years, at the most four years, and Saddam Hussein would have produced his three, four, five bombs. ... Then, this country and this people would have been lost, after the Holocaust. Another Holocaust would have happened in the history of the Jewish people. Never again, never again! Tell so your friends, tell anyone you meet, we shall defend our people with all the means at our disposal. We shall not allow any enemy to develop weapons of mass destruction turned against us.\\" On June 15, in a television interview on Face the Nation, Begin reiterated this doctrinal point: \\"This attack will be a precedent for every future government in Israel. ... Every future Israeli prime minister will act, in similar circumstances, in the same way.\\" Following the attack and Israeli government comments, many foreign powers opposed it and the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed United Nations Security Council Resolution 487 condemning the attacks. Operation Outside the Box The Begin doctrine was followed in 2007 under Prime Minister Ehud Olmert with Operation Outside the Box against a Syrian nuclear facility. What was particularly notable about the attack on Syria was what occurred in its aftermath, the near total lack of international comment or criticism of Israel's action. This lack of reaction contrasted starkly to the international outcry that followed Israel's preventive strike in 1981 against Iraq's reactor. Foreign governments may have reserved comment because of the lack of information after the attack, but the Israeli government imposed a virtually total news blackout immediately after the raid that lasted for seven months. The U.S. government ordered officials with knowledge of the attack to keep it confidential. Syria was initially silent on the matter and then subsequently denied that the bombed target was a nuclear facility. The international silence continued even after the CIA made information public in April 2008.Leonard S. Spector and Avner Cohen, Israel's Airstrike on Syria's Reactor: Implications for the Nonproliferation Regime, Arms Control Today, Vol. 38, No. 6 (July/August 2008), pp. 15–21, Arms Control Association Iranian nuclear program The doctrine also has been used since 2009, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with regard to Iran and its nuclear capability. During this time the Iranian nuclear issue openly turned into Israel's number one security issue. Netanyahu, along with his key cabinet ministers, such as Minister of Defense Ehud Barak and Vice Premier Moshe Ya'alon, has repeatedly referred to a nuclear Iran, or even a nuclear-capable Iran, as an unacceptable and existential threat to Israel. With virtually all Israelis agreeing that Iran should be prevented from acquiring nuclear weapons, there is an ongoing bitter debate among policymakers on how best to achieve this goal. So far, the Israeli government has been willing to allow the U.S. and Europe to implement economic sanctions and pursue diplomatic solutions, while also carrying out covert operations, such as computer viruses and assassinations of key Iranian scientists, designed to stall Iran's nuclear program.

Archbishop John VIII (Giovanni Bruni) participated in the Council of Trent between 1551 and 1552, and between 1562 and 1563, at which sessions he spoke with distinction. He was the fiercest opponent of the surrender of the city of Bar to the Turks. However, the Venetian governor of Bar, Count Alessandro Donato, and the Venetian military commander Giovanni Guidaccioni, decided that surrender was unavoidable. One source claims that they had sent the Archbishop and 600 soldiers on a galley to Ali Pasha (Ali Müezzinzade Pasha), the admiral of the besieging Ottoman fleet, who offered to purchase the Archbishop for 25,000 Venetian sequins; but any such offer was never finalised. Like many other people from Bar and Ulcinj whom the Ottoman forces had captured when those cities fell to their attacks and were surrendered to them in August 1571, the Archbishop was one of the slaves who rowed in an Ottoman galley at the Battle of Lepanto on 7 October.

In 1996 the first genetically modified soybean was introduced to the U.S. market, by Monsanto. In 2014, 90.7 million hectares of GM soy were planted worldwide, 82% of the total soy cultivation area. Examples of transgenic soybeans The genetic makeup of a soybean gives it a wide variety of uses, thus keeping it in high demand. First, manufacturers only wanted to use transgenics to be able to grow more soy at a minimal cost to meet this demand, and to fix any problems in the growing process, but they eventually found they could modify the soybean to contain healthier components, or even focus on one aspect of the soybean to produce in larger quantities. These phases became known as the first and second generation of genetically modified (GM) foods. As Peter Celec describes, \\"benefits of the first generation of GM foods were oriented towards the production process and companies, the second generation of GM foods offers, on contrary, various advantages and added value for the consumer\\", including \\"improved nutritional composition or even therapeutic effects.\\"  Ready Soybean Roundup Ready soybeans (The first variety was also known as GTS 40-3-2 (OECD UI: MON-04032-6)) are a series of genetically engineered varieties of glyphosate-resistant soybeans produced by Monsanto. Glyphosate kills plants by interfering with the synthesis of the essential amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan. These amino acids are called \\"essential\\" because animals cannot make them; only plants and micro-organisms can make them and animals obtain them by eating plants. Plants and microorganisms make these amino acids with an enzyme that only plants and lower organisms have, called 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). EPSPS is not present in animals, which instead obtain aromatic amino acids from their diet. Roundup Ready Soybeans express a version of EPSPS from the CP4 strain of the bacteria Agrobacterium tumefaciens, expression of which is regulated by an enhanced 35S promoter (E35S) from cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), a chloroplast transit peptide (CTP4) coding sequence from Petunia hybrida, and a nopaline synthase (nos 3') transcriptional termination element from Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The plasmid with EPSPS and the other genetic elements mentioned above was inserted into soybean germplasm with a gene gun by scientists at Monsanto and Asgrow.Homrich MS et al (2012) Soybean genetic transformation: a valuable tool for the functional study of genes and the production of agronomically improved plants Genet.

The patent on the first generation of Roundup Ready soybeans expired in March 2015. =What happened= First approved commercially in the United States during 1994, GTS 40-3-2 was subsequently introduced to Canada in 1995, Japan and Argentina in 1996, Uruguay in 1997, Mexico and Brazil in 1998, and South Africa in 2001. GMO Soybean is also approved by the United Nations in 1999. =Detection= GTS 40-3-2 can be detected using both nucleic acid and protein analysis methods. Generic GMO soybeans Following expiration of Monsanto's patent on the first variety of glyphosate-resistant Roundup Ready soybeans, development began on glyphosate-resistant generic soybeans. The first variety, developed at the University of Arkansas Division of Agriculture, came on the market in 2015. With a slightly lower yield than newer Monsanto varieties, it costs about 1/2 as much, and seeds can be saved for subsequent years. According to its creator it is adapted to conditions in Arkansas. Several other varieties are being bred by crossing the original variety of Roundup Ready soybeans with other soybean varieties. Stacked traits Monsanto developed a glyphosate-resistant soybean that also expresses Cry1Ac protein from Bacillus thuringiensis and the glyphosate- resistance gene, which completed the Brazilian regulatory process in 2010.Staff, Monsanto.

Soy oil has a fatty acid profile that makes it susceptible to oxidation, which makes it rancid, and this has limited its usefulness to the food industry. Genetic modifications increased the amount of oleic acid and stearic acid and decreased the amount of linolenic acid. By silencing, or knocking out, the delta 9 and delta 12 desaturases.Anthony, 196-7 DuPont Pioneer created a high oleic fatty acid soybean with levels of oleic acid greater than 80%, and started marketing it in 2010. Regulation The regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops. There are differences in the regulation of GM crops between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the US and Europe. Soy beans are allowed a Maximum Residue Limit of glyphosate of 20 mg/Kghttp://www.fao.org/fao-who-codexalimentarius/standards/pestres/pesticide- detail/en/?p_id=158 for international trade. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering.

Bingley, UK: Emerald Group Publishing Controversy There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food, but that each GM food needs to be tested on a case-by- case basis before introduction. Nonetheless, members of the public are much less likely than scientists to perceive GM foods as safe. The legal and regulatory status of GM foods varies by country, with some nations banning or restricting them, and others permitting them with widely differing degrees of regulation. Critics have objected to GM crops on several grounds, including ecological concerns, and economic concerns raised by the fact these organisms are subject to intellectual property law. GM crops also are involved in controversies over GM food with respect to whether food produced from GM crops is safe and whether GM crops are needed to address the world's food needs. See the genetically modified food controversies article for discussion of issues about GM crops and GM food. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive legislation in most countries.Wesseler, J. (ed.)

Background  In the first half of the 15th century, the larger Italian powers had been consolidating their territories, with Savoy expanding towards the Ligurian coast, Venice focusing on ' whilst the ' were threatened by Turkish expansion, Milan expanding southwards (and, even after the dismembering of the empire after Gian Galeazzo Visconti's death, retaining the bulk of Lombardy), the Florentines having gained most of Tuscany and the Papal States having begun the unification of the Pontifical territories that would continue over the next two centuries, while Alfonso V, king of Aragon, acquired both Sicilies, reigning the Kingdom of Naples as Alfonso I, as well as expanding to the north. Solemnly proclaimed on the 2 March 1455 with the accession of Pope Nicholas V (1447–55), king Alfonso and other small states to the League (excluding Malatestine Rimini, at Alfonso's insistence), by it was established a mutual defence agreement and a 25-year truce between the Italian powers, forbidding separate alliances and treaties while committing to maintenance of the established boundaries. After the period of confrontation, the Italian states acknowledged the ' Francesco Sforza as successor to the last of the Visconti of Milan, after having married the only daughter of Filippo Maria Visconti. The relative peace and stability resulting from Lodi and the League, promoted by Sforza, allowed him to consolidate his rule over Milan and it was Cosimo de' Medici's most important foreign policy decision to end the traditional rivalry between his Florence and Sforza's Milan.  Consequences  The League was the coherent development of the Peace of Lodi, born from the realisation that none of the regional Italian states, despite the long and bloody wars in the preceding hundred years, was in a position to assume hegemony in the north, let alone the entire peninsula. The League therefore provided a détente, founded on mutual suspicion and fear of France rather than on collaboration, which might have led to the formation of a broader, unified state. The Italic League played an essential part in the balance of power subsequently pursued by the Florentine ruler Lorenzo de' Medici (1449–92); its only cracks were the Pazzi conspiracy, the Barons Conspiracy and the Salt War. The League provided enough stability to allow the peninsular economy to recover from the population loss and economic depression caused by the Black Death and its aftermath, leading to an economic expansion that endured until the first part of the 17th century. The League also enabled the creation of the first permanent embassies amongst the states of the Italian peninsula, in order to monitor compliance with the terms prohibiting supporting exiled dissidents, with De Officio Legati — what seems to be the first treatise on ambassadorship — written by Ermolao Barbaro in Venice in 1490, after he had served the ' in Burgundy and Milan. With the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in 1492 was marked the decline of the League, he having been one of its greatest supporters and prime maintainer, recognising the advantage of maintaining a balance among the five powers as opposed to trying to eliminate his enemies. Whilst the League failed to prevent the French invasion in 1494 that began the Italian Wars, it did enable (as the League of Venice) the creation of the army that repelled Charles VIII's army after their sack of Naples. The League army engaged the French at Fornovo and retained control of the battlefield but failed to prevent an orderly French retreat. The Venetian alliance with France and Spain against Milan and Naples in the Italian War of 1499–1504, however, sounded the death knell for the League. As a result of the détente, unlike France, Spain and England, Italy failed to coalesce into a nation state in the Middle Ages, and was ripe for conquest by the major European powers. Several factors have been considered causes of this; Francesco Guicciardini blamed particularism, for example, while Niccolò Machiavelli believed it resulted from the moral and civil decay of institutions and morals and in Papal policy, for centuries aimed at avoiding the formation of a unitary Italy. It should be borne in mind, however, that Machiavelli's great work The Prince was a reflection of the political equilibrium resulting from the League's existence.

In this additional role, Talamini provides leadership to help coordinate the clinical operations of Stony Brook's surgical and surgically-congruent departments and to stimulate and build their scholarly pursuits. In 2018, Talamini was elected chair of the board of directors of the Clinical Practice Management Plan (CPMP) at Stony Brook Medicine. As chair serving a three-year term, he will preside over the meetings of the CPMP board and the board's Executive Committee. The CPMP board is responsible for ensuring that the plan properly manages and accounts for funds in its care. CPMP was established by the SUNY Board of Trustees to manage clinical practice income earned from fees for professional services. Talamini is co-director of Stony Brook's Surgical Outcomes Analysis Research (SOAR) Collaborative established in 2014. In 2008, Talamini's surgical team at UC San Diego, where he was professor and chairman of surgery from 2005 to mid-2013, gained worldwide attention for pioneering natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), the practice of removing diseased organs through natural body openings (see references below). As a leader of the UC San Diego Center for the Future of Surgery, Talamini's team was the first in the United States to remove an appendix through the mouth. In partnership with Jacobs School of Engineering and Calit2 at UC San Diego, Talamini pushed the limits of surgical technology by helping to develop a new surgical camera, called SurgiCam, that boasts auto focus and optical zoom. Designed for NOTES, optical zoom gives surgeons the ability to change the field of view and some peripheral vision. Talamini was director of minimally invasive surgery at The Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1992 to 2004, where he pioneered new minimally invasive surgical techniques for abdominal diseases. Talamini was one of the first surgeons at Johns Hopkins to use robot-assisted laparoscopic techniques for general abdominal procedures such as gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) and treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Talamini is recognized as one of the leading authorities on laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery in the United States. He advocates for discovery and innovation, and has served as panel chair of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee's Gastroenterology and Urology Devices Panel of the US Food and Drug Administration.

This innovation model represents a combination of the private investment model and the collective-action innovation model. In the private investment model innovators appropriate financial returns from innovations through intellectual property rights such as patents, copyright, licenses, or trade secrets. Any knowledge spillover reduces the innovator's benefits, thus freely revealed knowledge is not in the interest of the innovator. The collective-action innovation model explains the creation of public goods which are defined by the non-rivalry of benefits and non- excludable access to the good. In this case the innovators do not benefit more than any one else not investing into the public good, thus free-riding occurs. In response to this problem, the cost of innovation has to be distributed, therefore governments typically invest into public goods through public funding. As combination of these two models, the private-collective model of innovation explains the creation of public goods through private funding. The model is based on the assumption that the innovators privately creating the public goods benefit more than the free-riders only consuming the public good. While the result of the investment is equally available to all, the innovators benefit through the process of creating the public good. Therefore, private- collective innovation occurs when the process-related rewards exceed the process-related costs.Democratizing innovation (2005) Eric von Hippel, MIT PressGeorg von Krogh (2008) \\"Researching the Private-Collective Innovation Model\\" The SAGE Handbook of New Approaches in Management and Organization, Daved Barry and Hans Hansen (ed.) Sage, 396-397. A laboratory studyGächter, S., von Krogh, G., Haefliger, S. \\"Initiating private-collective innovation: The fragility of knowledge sharing,\\" Research Policy, 39(7), 2010, pp. 893-906. traced the initiation of private-collective innovation to the first decision to share knowledge in a two-person game with multiple equilibria. The results indicate fragility: when individuals face opportunity costs to sharing their knowledge with others they quickly turn away from the social optimum of mutual sharing. The opportunity costs of the \\"second player\\", the second person deciding whether to share, have a bigger (negative) impact on knowledge sharing than the opportunity costs of the first person to decide. Overall, the study also observed sharing behavior in situations where none was predicted. Recent workHelena Garriga, Efe Aksuyek, Georg F. von Krogh, Fredrik Hacklin, What social preferences matter in private-collective innovation? Behavioral game theory in collective action, Technology Analysis and Strategic Management, Forthcoming shows that a project will not \\"take off\\" unless the right incentives are in place for innovators to contribute their knowledge to open innovation from the beginning. The article explores social preferences in the initiation of PCI. It conducted a simulation study that elucidates how inequality aversion, reciprocity, and fairness affect the underlying conditions that lead to the initiation of Private-collective innovation. While firms increasingly seek to cooperate with outside individuals and organizations to tap into their ideas for new products and services, mechanisms that motivate innovators to \\"open up\\" are critical in achieving the benefits of open innovation. The theory of private collective innovation has recently been extended by a study on the exclusion rights for technology in the competition between private-collective and other innovators.Alexy, O., Reitzig, M. \\"Private-collective innovation, competition, and firms' counterintuitive appropriation strategies\\", Research Policy, 42(4), 2013, pp. 895-913. The authors argue that the investment in orphan exclusion rights for technology serves as a subtle coordination mechanism against alternative proprietary solutions. Additionally, the research on private-collective innovation has been extended with theoretical explanations and empirical evidence of egoism and altruism as significant explanations for cooperation in private-collective innovation. Benbunan-Fich and KoufarisBenbunan-Fich, R., Koufaris, M., \\"Public contributions to private-collective systems: the case of social bookmarking\\", Internet Research, 23(2), 2013, pp. 183-203. show that contributions to a social bookmarking site are a combination of intentional and unintentional contributions. The intentional public contribution of bookmarks is driven by an egoistic motivation to contribute valuable information and thus showing competence. Example: Development of Free and Libre Open Source Software The development of open source software / Free Software (consequently named Free and Libre Open Source Software – FLOSS) is the most prominent example of private-collective innovation.Eric von Hippel and Georg von Krogh \\"Free revealing and the private-collective model of innovation incentives\\", R&D; Management, 36(3), 2006, pp. 295-306. By definition, FLOSS represents a public good. It is non-rival because copying and distributing software does not decrease its value. And it is non- excludable because FLOSS licenses enable everyone to use, change and redistribute the software without any restriction. While FLOSS is created by many unpaid individuals, it has been shownMatthias Stuermer, Sebastian Spaeth, and Georg von Krogh, G.

These companies release previously proprietary software under FLOSS licenses, employ programmers to work on established FLOSS projects, and fund entrepreneurial firms to develop certain features. In this way, private entities invest into the creation of public goods.

In the middle of the twentieth century, fertility rates increased significantly in the United States, Canada, Australia, and most of Europe. For example, nearly one-third of Americans—76 million people—were born between 1946 and 1964. This period of increased fertility era occurred between the baby busts of the Depression and World War II and the Vietnam war. * Elevating longevity. Due to advances in public health, nutrition management and medical advances, life expectancy vaulted during the 20th century. For example, in the United States, life expectancy at birth in 1900 was 47.Dychtwald, Ken. \\"Age Wave: The Challenges and Opportunities of an Aging America.\\" New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1989. Today, life expectancy at birth in the United States is 78.https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr56/nvsr56_09.pdf * The birth dearth. The baby boom has been followed by a period of declining fertility rates, so that many parts of the world are now experiencing sub-replacement fertility levels. According to Ken Dychtwald, Ph.D., who first envisioned this demographically-driven transformation and coined the term,\\"The Age Wave,\\" Training & Development Journal, February 1, 1990. the “age wave” has already reshaped social and cultural trends, marketplace opportunities, productivity, and consumption patterns. Because of its enormous size and unique preferences and priorities, the men and women of this generation don’t just populate existing lifestages or consumer trends, they transform them. Some examples of trends and events driven by the age wave include: * Benjamin Spock's book, The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care, published during the first year of the baby boom, sold at least one million copies a year for eight straight years. * 1.5 million cans of baby food were consumed in 1953, almost six times as many as a decade before. * Enrollment in the Cub Scouts doubled between 1950 and 1955. * The toy industry increased fifteen-fold in the 1940s and 1950s to meet the needs of rapidly growing numbers of children. * 83 percent of the total population growth in the United States during the 1950s was in the suburbs as parents of the baby boomers moved out of the cities to raise their larger families. * In the 1960s, teenagers accounted for 55 percent of all soft drink sales, 53 percent of all movie tickets, and 43 percent of all records sold. Fast food franchisers grew 20 percent a year.Jones, Landon. \\"Great Expectations: America and the Baby Boom Generation.\\" New York: Ballantine Books, 1980. * Sales of home gym equipment rose from $75 million in 1982 to over $1 billion in 1985. * Minivans and SUVs were created and came to dominate the auto industry in the 1980s and 1990s as baby boomers began raising families. * The age wave will cause a massive slowdown in workforce growth in the coming years. In the next decade, America's workforce will grow only 4 percent as the boomers begin to retire, down from 12 percent in the current decade and 29 percent in the 1970s when the boomers were entering the workforce.Dychtwald, Ken, Erickson, Tamara, Morison, Robert. \\"Workforce Crisis.\\" Harvard Business School Publishing, 2006. Dychtwald argues that as the boomer generation continues to mature, life's second half is about to be further transformed, and that in the next several decades, this age wave will shift the epicenter of consumer activity from a focus on youth to the needs, challenges, and aspirations of maturing consumers. Because of the aging of the boomer generation, we are about to see an explosion of maturity-oriented products and services such as: nutraceuticals, cosmeceuticals, fitness communes, re-careering, philanthropreneuring, career-transition coordinators, smart homes, long-term care and longevity insurance, equity-release, reverse mortgages, college campus-based retirement housing and Internet cemeteries. However, the age wave will also put unprecedented pressure on families, communities and governments as multiplying numbers of older adults strain entitlements, eldercare, healthcare delivery and pensions.Dychtwald, Ken. \\"Age Wave: The Challenges and Opportunities of an Aging America.\\" New York: St. Martin's Press, 1989. Criticisms All of these anecdotes may not reflect purely demographic changes, but also changes in norms of social present in the period. Especially activities like baby food consumption or Boy Scout attendance. Baby food consumption points to changes in beliefs about childhood nutrition, marketing and increased wealth with which to buy packaged food. Boy Scout attendance is not a stable fraction of the population (all those of a certain age) but rather a reflection of trends in beliefs about proper young male socialization and ideology.

The feminine form is Gaia.Chase, pp. 174–176. The praenomen was used by both patrician and plebeian families, and gave rise to the patronymic gens Gavia. The name was regularly abbreviated C., based on the original spelling, Caius, which dates from the period before the letters \\"C\\" and \\"G\\" were differentiated. Inverted, Ɔ. stood for the feminine, Gaia.Liber de Praenominibus.Quintilian, Institutes, i. 7. § 28.\\"Nomen\\" in Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, pp. 1101–1103.Kajava, Roman Female Praenomina, pp. 38–40, 109, 110. Throughout Roman history, Gaius was generally the second-most common praenomen, following only Lucius. Although many prominent families did not use it at all, it was so widely distributed amongst all social classes that Gaius became a generic name for any man, and Gaia for any woman. A familiar Roman wedding ceremony included the words, spoken by the bride, ubi tu Gaius, ego Gaia (\\"as you are Gaius, I am Gaia\\"), to which the bridegroom replied, ubi tu Gaia, ego Gaius.Plutarch, \\"Quaestiones Romanae\\", 30.Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquities, p. 1016 (\\"Matrimonium\\"). The name survived the collapse of the Western Empire in the fifth century, and continued into modern times. Origin and meaning The author of De Praenominibus (\\"Concerning Praenomina\\") states that Gaius is derived from the same root as gaudere, \\"to rejoice\\". Although Paris and the unidentified authorities whom he consulted probably relied on folk etymology, modern scholars generally concur with this derivation.Chase, pp. 157, 158. The original form of the name was probably Gavius, in which form it was also used by the Oscans. However, in Latin it had already lost its medial \\"v\\" by the time of the earliest inscriptions. An archaic three-syllable pronunciation given above, in which the \\"a\\" and \\"i\\" are pronounced separately as , is evidence of the original form. This pronunciation persisted, alongside the later two-syllable form in which \\"a\\" and \\"i\\" are pronounced together as , throughout the period of the Roman Republic. The existence of the patronymic gens Gavia also indicates the original form of the name, although it could be argued that this family's name was derived from the Oscan praenomen Gavius. But as Gaius and Gavius are apparently based on the same root, this distinction is of limited importance.Chase, p. 127. In the form Cae, this praenomen was also popular amongst the Etruscans, who borrowed many names from both Latin and Oscan.Jacques Heurgon, Daily Life of the Etruscans.  Spellings  The following personal names are derived from Gaius: * Croatian: Kajo * French: Caïus * Greek: Γάιος (Gáios) * Italian: Gaio * Latin: Gaius * Portuguese: Caio * Romanian: Caius * Spanish: Cayo  References Bibliography * Liber de Praenominibus, a short treatise of uncertain authorship, traditionally appended to Valerius Maximus' Factorum ac Dictorum Memorabilium (Memorable Facts and Sayings). * Marcus Fabius Quintilianus (Quintilian), Institutio Oratoria (Institutes of Oratory). * Lucius Mestrius Plutarchus (Plutarch), \\"Quaestiones Romanae\\" (Roman Questions), in Moralia. * George Davis Chase, \\"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\\", in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol.

On 2 October 1847, United States Marines and sailors fought with Mexican militia. Background On August 10, 1847, United States Navy Commodore William Shubrick had resumed command of the Pacific Squadron. His first orders upon retaking command was the sending of sloops-of- war USS Dale and USS Portsmouth along with the frigate Congress to commence a new blockade of Mazatlán, Guaymas and San Blas. When the Dale arrived alone at La Paz in mid-September, the commander of the U.S. occupation force there, Lieutenant Colonel Henry S. Burton, persuaded the Dale commander, Thomas O. Selfridge, to sail for Loreto and Mulegé to prevent the landing of supplies from Guaymas and to secure a pledge of neutrality from the Mexican inhabitants.Nunis, D.B., 1977, The Mexican War in Baja California, Los Angeles: Dawson's Book Shop, On September 30, the Dale entered the port of Mulegé under British colors. After Dale was anchored, it lowered the British flag and raised the Stars and Stripes. Lieutenant Tunis Augustus Macdonough Craven of Dale, went ashore under a flag of truce and delivered to the Mexican emissary, Sub-Lt. Jesus Avilez, a message that Californias was American territory, which prompted Avilez's request for time to consider. Craven then seized the Mexican Navy schooner Magdalena, which had brought Capt. Manuel Pineda days before from Guaymas. On October 1, Commander Selfridge sent a letter ashore warning the Mexican authorities to lay down their arms, to preserve neutrality and to abstain from contact with the mainland within three hours. Returning again after three hours, Craven received Pineda's refusal of the ultimatum. Returning again the next morning, Craven received Pineda's written rejection, Captain Pineda stating that he refused to be neutral and is in protest against the Dales use of British flag to enter the port. Battle Pineda's defiance did not go unanswered. At 2 PM on 2 Oct. 1847, Lieutenant Craven with seventeen marines and fifty-seven sailors landed at the entrance to Muleje Creek (El Sombrerito) and proceeded up the right bank.Craven's report, 1847, in The Mexican War in Baja California, Nunis, D.B., editor, 1977, Los Angeles: Dawson's Book Shop, Just after landing, USS Dale began her bombardment which reportedly had little effect. Now on shore, the American marines and sailors proceeded to a nearby hill, occupied by a strong Mexican force commanding the town. Before reaching the hill, however, a shot was fired from a window of a nearby house and from a thicket to the American's left. USS Dale bombarding Mulege during the engagement, a small captured schooner is also depicted. Immediately, Craven dispatched a small force to attack and burn the house while he attacked the thicket. The house was burned and Lieutenant Craven encountered no one in the thicket or additional houses. The creek at Mulege. The Americans took the hill, the Mexicans retreating beyond the stream, and from several ambuscades, fired upon the Americans' left flank. The American forces responded with several volleys of return fire which forced the Mexicans to flee up the creek. Marching to the village at the foot of the hill, they found it deserted before proceeding to the River Road. Lieutenant Craven's men were again attacked by Mexican insurgents firing from the jungle on the opposite bank, but his fire along with The Boat Gun, drove them off. The farthest Craven took his force was three miles from the mouth of the river. With the approach of night, Craven then proceeded to take his men back aboard the Dale. Aftermath Craven thought he had inflicted \\"Chastisement\\", while Manuel Pineda reported \\"the enemy made off shamefully ... having inflicted exemplary punishment.\\"Pineda's report, 1847, in The Mexican War in Baja California, Nunis, D.B., editor, 1977, Los Angeles: Dawson's Book Shop, After the battle at Mulegé, the Dale sailed for La Paz, with the Magdalena in tow, reaching it on 8 Oct. Commander Selfridge chartered a small schooner from an American citizen living at La Paz, christened it Libertad, and armed it with a 9-pounder on a pivot. Assigned to Lt. Craven, his mission was to sever communication between Mulege and Guaymas. On 2 Nov., Craven captured the sloop Alerta, before heading to Guaymas on 19 Nov.

It is now used predominantly for education, school and community camps and tourism purposes.  History  On 15 April 1912, Kingsley Fairbridge and his wife Ruby Fairbridge arrived in Albany, Western Australia, from England and made their way to Pinjarra, arriving on 16 July that same year to establish the world's first Fairbridge Farm School. The school opened on 19 October 1912. Kingsley wanted to see \\"little children shedding the bondage of bitter circumstances and stretching their legs and minds amid the thousand interests of the farm.\\"  Child migration  From 1913 until 1982, Fairbridge Farm School was home to a total of 3,580 children who came to Fairbridge under various child migration schemes. The school provided education in task-learning, husbandry, metal work and wood work. During World War II, Dutch refugee children evacuated from Indonesia were based at Fairbridge while waiting to be reunited with their families. During the same period, the site was also used as a training ground for the Women's Land Army, and Guildford Grammar School partially relocated there while their school was used as a hospital base. An airfield was constructed and operated from the school during the Second World War until the 1950s. The Australian Heritage Commission commented, when announcing the listing of Fairbridge on the Interim List of the Register of the National Estate in December 1997 that \\"Fairbridge is a striking example of Australia’s early philanthropic movement to resettle and educate migrant children.\\" The Chair of the Heritage Commission at the time, Wendy McCarthy stated that \\"'by entering Fairbridge in the Interim List of the Register of the National Estate, we are not only recognising the efforts of this philanthropist, Kingsley Fairbridge, but also its role in a significant phase in Australia’s migration history. From 1912 until 1980 Fairbridge Pinjarra played a significant role in the development of the British Empire and Australian migration history on child, single parent and family migration schemes. = Forgotten Australians = Many of the child migrants were falsely told that they were orphans and consequently never saw their families again. In 1986 the first Australian child migrant approached the British Government and sought reparation. The approach eventually led to the establishment of the Child Migrant Trust in 1987. The Australian Government apologised for its involvement in the scheme, and in 1998 the Western Australian Government apologised to the former child migrants: \\"The Western Australian Government apologises to former child migrants who suffered physical, emotional and sexual abuse in the state's institutions. The following year the Christian Brothers, Sisters of Mercy and Poor Sisters of Nazareth launched a computerised personal history index to the records of former child migrants.\\" On 24 February 2010 UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown made a formal apology to the families of children who suffered. On 31 January 2019 the UK Government announced that following the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, handed down in May 2018, the UK Government would make an ex-gratia payment of 20,000 to any former British child migrant who was alive on 1 March 2018, or if alive as at that date and since deceased, the payment would be made to the deceased's beneficiaries.  Royal visitors to Fairbridge  Fairbridge was visited by the Duke and Duchess of York in 1927; Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, in 1964; and Prince Charles in 1979.  Fairbridge Chapel  The chapel is the only building in Australia designed by with construction overseen by noted British architect Sir Herbert Baker. Described as \\"the architectural jewel in the crown\\" of Fairbridge Village, the chapel was built in 1930-31 by the Western Australian Government with construction funded by British interests.

This syndrome was named after Richard D. Smith, Robert M. Fineman and Gart G. Myers who discovered it around 1980.http://www.whonamedit.com/synd.cfm/2227.html Signs and symptoms Facial deformities with Smith-Fineman-Myers syndrome SFMS affects the skeletal and nervous system. This syndrome's external signs would be an unusual facial appearance with their heads being slightly smaller and unusually shaped, a narrow face which is also called dolichocephaly, a large mouth with a drooping lower lip that are held open, protruding upper jaw, widely spaced upper front teeth, an underdeveloped chin, cleft palate and exotropied-slanted eyes with drooping eyelids. Males who have SFMS have short stature and a thin body build. Also skin is lightly pigmented with multiple freckles. They may have scoliosis and chest abnormalities. Affected boys have reduced muscle tone as infants and young children. X-rays sometimes show that their bones are underdeveloped and show characteristics of younger bones of children. Boys usually under the age of 10 have reduced muscle tone but later, patients with SFMS over the age of 10 have increased muscle tone and reflexes that cause spasticity. Their hands are short with unusual palm creases with short, shaped fingers and foot abnormalities are shortened and have fused toes and usually mild. They have an absent of a spleen and the genitals may also show undescended testes ranging from mild to severe that leads to female gender assignment. People who have SFMS have severe mental retardation. They are sometimes restless, behavior problems, seizures and severe delay in language development. They are self-absorbed with reduced ability to socialize with others around them. They also have psychomotor retardation which is the slowing-down of thoughts and a reduction of physical movements. They have cortical atrophy or degeneration of the brain's outer layer. Cortical atrophy is usually founded in older affected people. Genetics SFMS is an X-linked disease by chromosome Xq13. X-linked diseases map to the human X chromosome because this syndrome is an X chromosome linked females who have two chromosomes are not affected but because males only have one X chromosome, they are more likely to be affected and show the full clinical symptoms. This disease only requires one copy of the abnormal X-linked gene to display the syndrome. Since females have two X chromosomes, the effect of one X chromosome is recessive and the second chromosome masks the affected chromosome.http://www.bookrags.com/research/smith-fineman-myers-syndrome-wog/ Affected fathers can never pass this X-linked disease to their sons but affected fathers can pass the X-linked gene to their daughters who has a 50% chance to pass this disease-causing gene to each of her children. Since females who inherit this gene do not show symptoms, they are called carriers. Each of the female's carrier's son has a 50% chance to display the symptoms but none of the female carrier's daughters would display any symptoms.http://health.yahoo.net/galecontent/smith-fineman-myers-syndrome Some patients with SFMS have been founded to have a mutation of the gene in the ATRX on the X chromosome, also known as the Xq13 location. ATRX is a gene disease that is associated with other forms of X-linked mental retardation like Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome, Carpenter syndrome, Juberg-Marsidi syndrome, and soastic paraplegia. It is possible that patients with SFMS have Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome without the affected hemoglobin H that leads to Alphathalassemia/ mental retardation syndrome in the traditionally recognized disease. Diagnosis The assessment for Smith-Finemen-Myers syndrome like any other mental retardation includes a detailed family history and physical exam that tests the mentality of the patient. The patient also gets a brain and skeletal imaging though CT scans or x-rays. They also does a chromosome study and certain other genetic biochemical tests to help figure out any other causes for the mental retardation. The diagnosis of SFMS is based on visible and measurable symptoms. Until 2000, SFMS was not known to be associated with any particular gene. As of 2001, scientists do not yet know if other genes are involved in this rare disease. Generic analysis of the ATRX gene may prove to be helpful in diagnosis of SFMS.http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/s/smith_fineman_myers_syndrome_1/tests.htm Treatments Treatments are usually based on the individuals symptoms that are displayed. The seizures are controlled with anticonvulsant medication. For the behavior problems, the doctors prescribe a few medications and behavioral modification routines that involve therapists and other types of therapy. Even if mental retardation is severe, it does not seem to shorten the lifespan of the patient or to get worse with age. History On September 15, 1991 in Sydney, Australia at the Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, reported on two brothers with a distinct facial appearance, severe mental retardation, short stature, cryptorchidism (undescended testicle), asplenia in one (absent spleen), dramatic failure to thrive, early hypotonia, and later hypertonia, all suggestive of the Smith–Fineman–Myers syndrome. All five of the reported cases have been males, suggesting X-linked inheritance. On September 23, 1998 at the Hospital Injury Research and Rehabilitation at the University of São Paulo in Bauru, Brazil report on two boys, monozygotic twins born to normal and non consanguineous parents, presenting with an unusual facial appearance, cortical atrophy, dolichocephaly, short stature, cleft palate, micrognathia, prominent upper central incisors, bilateral Sidney line, minor foot deformities, unstableness in walking, early hypotonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, psychomotor retardation, and severe delay in language development. These symptoms resemble those previously described in the Smith–Fineman–Myers syndrome.

Construction began in 1503 in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, at the behest of governor (and namesake of the hospital) Nicolás de Ovando. This grand project was in keeping with the desire to emulate European princely courts, and looked to Renaissance Italy for inspiration. At the time of its completion, the wards could accommodate up to 70 patients, comparable to the most advanced churches of Rome. It is likely that the model for the Hospital de San Nicolás was the large Ospedale di Santo Spirito in Sassia in Rome.Bailey, p. 132 The complex forms part of the Colonial Zone of Santo Domingo World Heritage Site. History The hospital began operating in 1522 and provided its services until the mid-18th century. The complex occupied most of the block and was built on two stories in a cross shaped plan. Each of the corners contained a courtyard that provided light, ventilation, and open space to the various hospital facilities. The structure, in keeping with contemporary European hospitals, was composed of three naves: a central one for worship flanked by two lateral naves which housed the sick. In this way, patients were literally steps away from the sanctuary and the chapel located in its core. There was also a separate private chapel, now incorporated into the adjacent 20th Century Basílica Catedral Nuestra Señora de la Altagracia. This despite the hospital having been undertaken by an association of benefactors rather than by a monastic order. Already a ruin in 1908 when part of its façade collapsed, the hospital exhibited a combination of Gothic and Renaissance elements, with some considerable Mudéjar influence, as was typical of 16th Century Santo Domingo buildings. For example, the interior arches—which supported Gothic rib vaults—were pointed on the second story yet barreled on the ground floor. The vanguardist plan of the San Nicolás de Bari hospital served as a model for other hospitals throughout Spanish America, namely the Hospital de la Concepción undertaken in Mexico by Hernando Cortés in 1524.Bailey, p. 133 See also * List of oldest buildings in the Americas * Some of the other historical sites from the Colonial Era in Santo Domingo's Ciudad Colonial: Fortaleza Ozama (built in 1502) Basilica Cathedral of Santa María la Menor (construction began in 1512) Autonomous University of Santo Domingo (seminary established in 1538) Monasterio de San Francisco (built between 1509 and 1560) Gallery References {   } Infrastructure completed in 1503 Hospital buildings completed in the 16th century Buildings and structures in Santo Domingo Hospitals in the Dominican Republic 1503 establishments in the Spanish Empire Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo) ","title":"Hospital San Nicolás de Bari"},{"id":"25183744","text":"Solomon Markovich Khromchenko (born 4 December 1907, town of Zlatopol, Russian Empire, now Novomyrhorod, Kirovohrad district, Ukraine – died 20 January 2002, Moscow, Russia) was a Russian and Jewish tenor singer.

Background Ehigie Uzamere was born in the Oredo Local Government Area of Edo State on the 1st of June, 1955. He was an architect before running for the Senate in April 2007, with no prior political experience. In July 2007, an American woman, claiming that Uzamere had married her in New York in 1979 while seeking a green card, filed a divorce suit demanding $100 million compensation and child support. The senator dismissed the charge, saying he had not married the woman. However, according to Huhuonline, in May 2009, the New York State Supreme Court rejected his argument, found that the marriage had taken place, and ordered him to personally appear in court for trial. Senate career Uzamere was elected to the Senate for Edo South in April 2007 for the People's Democratic Party (PDP). He was appointed to committees on Security & Intelligence, Local and Foreign Debts, Land Transport, Housing, Downstream Petroleum and Culture & Tourism. In May 2008, he was named as a member of the National Assembly Joint Committee on Constitution Review (JCCR). He was a member of a joint Senate committee on Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Housing, which investigated the administration of the FCT between 1999 and 2007, issuing a highly critical report in July 2008. In June 2008, the Edo State election petition tribunal said there had been irregularities in the conduct of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the 2007 general elections, annulled the election of Uzamere, and directed the INEC to conduct a fresh Senate election in Edo South within 90 days. After a series of appeals, in June 2009, the court of appeal ruled that Uzamere had in fact been duly elected. In December 2008, the three PDP senators - Uzamere, Yisa Braimah and Odion Ugbesia - were given the job of reconciling the different party factions that emerged during the eighteen months Edo State governorship of Oserheimen Osunbor. Uzamere said that since Edo State now had an Action Congress government, PDP supporters could not expect patronage, which would make the job easier. In a mid-term assessment of the performance of Senators, ThisDay newspaper noted that he had sponsored the Nigerian Communication Commission Act (Amendment) Bill 2009 and the Nigerian Institute of Cost Management Bill 2008. In June 2009, Uzamere spoke in favor of reform of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to reduce delays in finalizing electoral results. In July 2009, he was accused of delays in confirming the Edo State nominee to the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) board, perhaps due to party-political motives. As chancellor of the University of Benin he pushed to appoint another Beni man to replace the previous vice-chancellor, in a debate that dragged out through the second half of 2009. In September 2009, as head of the Senate Committee on Local and Foreign Debts Besides, Uzamere supporting the move to audit debts owed by the Federal government to local contractors, which apparently included many \\"ghost\\" debts. He also called for quick settlement of verified outstanding amounts once the audit is completed. In November 2009, Uzamere gave a talk during the opening of a Nigerian arts exhibition in Stockholm on The Benin Civilization and Its Impacts on Contemporary Nigerian Politics. Uzamere ran successfully for reelection in the April 2011 elections for the Edo South Senatorial District. He defeated former senator Daisy Danjuma by 135,346 votes to 70,725.

The belligerents were United States Army troops against Mexican militia, commanded by Mexican Army officers. The battle occurred on November 16 and 17, 1847. Background In late September, Captain Manuel Pineda of the Mexican Army began to assemble a large militia force of farmers and ranchers to defend the Gulf of California region of Mexico from the invading United States military. Hundreds of men were among Pineda's ranks. In March and April 1847, the 1st Regiment of New York Volunteers, an American volunteer regiment from New York State, arrived in San Francisco, California. Their mission was to reinforce the United States Navy and marines, occupying various Mexican ports to the south and also to take ports themselves. Lieutenant Colonel Henry S. Burton, of the United States Army, was in command. On May 30, 1847, Burton received orders to embark the sloop-of-war USS Lexington with companies A and B and proceed to La Paz for its capture.Nunis, D.B., editor, The Mexican War in Baja California, 1977, Los Angeles: Dawson's Book Shop, On 21 July, 115 men from the Seventh Regiment of New York Volunteers landed peacefully at La Paz. Lieutenant E. Gould Buffum, of Company B, later described the port city: \\"The houses were all of adobe, plastered white, and thatched with the leaves of the palm tree, and were most delightfully cool. The whole beach was lined with palms, date, fig, tamarind and coconut trees, their delicious fruit hanging down on them in clusters.\\" Following the Battle of Mulege, Pineda, as Commandante en Jefe de la Guerilla Guadalupana, set up a provisional capital at San Antonio, raised taxes for defense, started resistance in Oct. at San Jose del Cabo, Comondu and Mulege, and plundered any American sympathizers. By Nov., Pineda had 300-500 insurgents gathered at San Antonio. Before departing to capture Mazatlan on 11 Nov., William Shubrick landed 4 sailors and 20 marines at San Jose del Cabo. Burton's La Paz garrison occupied two houses on the plain commanding the town, on the south side of The Arroyo, with a breastwork of palm logs in front of the officer's house for the 6-pounders. Additionally, Burton's men used palm logs to barricade the space between the officer's quarters, the church and a house on the west side of town. Battle La Paz disposition of forces in 1847 At 2 AMBurton's report, 1848, in The Mexican War in Baja California, Nunis, D.B., editor, 1977, Los Angeles: Dawson's Book Shop, on 16 Nov., Pineda's brigade of 200 men attacked the American garrison of La Paz, from the north side of The Arroyo with infantry, while the cavalry waited in the east and south waiting to charge. Pineda's men fired upon the Americans for about an hour before stopping, waiting until 9 AM to advance, but their advance slackened by 2 PM. Pineda with 50 men was able to burn former governor Francisco Palacios de Miranda's house, and briefly occupy a house on the lower part of town, before spherical case shot and canister shot forced their retreat, killing 6. On the morning of 17 Nov., Burton's spherical case shot drove some Mexicans from another house, after which he destroyed the houses on the north side of The Arroyo, strengthened his breastworks, and the roofs of the houses he occupied. Aftermath Pineda's men withdrew but continued to hover about the garrison, eventually resulting in the Siege of La Paz.

History Hatfield Point NB, c. 1915 Hatfield Point is located at the head of the Belleisle Bay, called \\"Pascobac\\" (\\"Side Bay\\") by the Maliseet, who hunted and fished in the area. European settlement began in 1783 with the arrival of Captain Thomas Spragg, a United Empire Loyalist militia officer from Hempstead, Long Island.Pradl, Gordon, \\"Literature for Democracy\\" (Portsmouth NH, 1996) Spragg and his adult sons were granted large tracts on the north side of the Bay, soon dubbed \\"Spragg's Point\\". The first settlers were largely Loyalists from New York, with subsequent immigration directly from Britain and Ireland. Originally, most belonged to the established Church of England. However, the early 1800s brought a religious shift as the Anglican Church moved to Springfield. Founded in 1806, the \\"First Springfield Calvinist Baptist Church\\", now \\"Hatfield Point Baptist Church\\", became the mother church of several Baptist chapels around the Belleisle. The economy was mainly agricultural, supplemented by seasonal trade in lumber and fur. The early-to- mid 1800s saw the rise of riverboats on the Saint John River system, which became the chief means of transportation in southern New Brunswick. Spragg's Point was the last stop on the Belleisle, and the Pleasantview Inn opened to house the incoming travellers and salesmen. In the 1880s, the settlement became Hatfield's Point, reflecting the preference of the local postmaster. In addition to the hotel and the post office, Hatfield Point would also feature a sawmill, doctor's office, two stores, a Pentecostal Church and later an auto garage. The boiler of the SS Springfield, a riverboat that burnt down while at anchor off the point, is still visible from the community wharf, emerging from the water in a shallow part of the bay. Historiography Though a very small community, Hatfield Point and its people have been the subjects of several oral and informal histories, including works by Marsha Boyd, Thomas Shanklin, Calin Coburn and Elizabeth Drake McDonald. Though these deal with particular families and events, they combine to give a fuller impression of life in the Belleisle Valley. Notable people Hatfield Point's most famous resident was Bob Nolan, born Robert Clarence Nobles. He spent much of his childhood on his grandparents' farm in Hatfield Point. He was a member of the Sons of the Pioneers and a prolific songwriter, with Cool Water and Tumbling Tumbleweeds his best known works. David Crandall, the son of Joseph Crandall, was the resident Baptist minister for a period in the late 1800s. See also *List of communities in New Brunswick References Marsha L.

The responses to a pencil beam incident on a scattering medium are referred to as Green's functions or impulse responses. Photon transport methods can be directly used to compute broad-beam responses by distributing photons over the cross section of the beam. However, convolution can be used in certain cases to improve computational efficiency. General convolution formulas In order for convolution to be used to calculate a broad-beam response, a system must be time invariant, linear, and translation invariant. Time invariance implies that a photon beam delayed by a given time produces a response shifted by the same delay. Linearity indicates that a given response will increase by the same amount if the input is scaled and obeys the property of superposition. Translational invariance means that if a beam is shifted to a new location on the tissue surface, its response is also shifted in the same direction by the same distance. Here, only spatial convolution is considered. Responses from photon transport methods can be physical quantities such as absorption, fluence, reflectance, or transmittance. Given a specific physical quantity, G(x,y,z), from a pencil beam in Cartesian space and a collimated light source with beam profile S(x,y), a broad-beam response can be calculated using the following 2-D convolution formula: :C(x,y,z)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty \\\\ G( x-x',y-y',z)S(x',y')\\\\, dx'\\\\,dy'. \\\\qquad(1) Similar to 1-D convolution, 2-D convolution is commutative between G and S with a change of variables x=x-x'\\\\, and y=y-y'\\\\,: : C(x,y,z)=\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}\\\\\\\\!\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}\\\\ G( x,y,z)S(x-x,y-y)\\\\, dx\\\\,dy. \\\\qquad(2) Because the broad-beam response C(x,y,z)\\\\, has cylindrical symmetry, its convolution integrals can be rewritten as: : C(r,z) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\ S(r')r' \\\\left [ \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} \\\\ G\\\\left (\\\\sqrt{r^2+r'\\\\,^2-2rr'cos\\\\phi'},z \\\\right )\\\\, d\\\\phi' \\\\right ]dr' \\\\qquad(3) :C(r,z)=\\\\int_0^\\\\infty G(r,z)r \\\\left [ \\\\int_{0}^{2\\\\pi} S \\\\left ( \\\\sqrt{r^2+r\\\\,^2-2rrcos\\\\phi} \\\\right ) \\\\, d\\\\phi \\\\right ]dr\\\\qquad(4) where r'=\\\\sqrt{x'^2+y'^2}. Because the inner integration of Equation 4 is independent of z, it only needs to be calculated once for all depths. Thus this form of the broad-beam response is more computationally advantageous. Common beam profiles Gaussian beam For a Gaussian beam, the intensity profile is given by : S(r') = S_0 \\\\exp \\\\left [ -2 \\\\left( \\\\frac{r'}{R} \\\\right )^2 \\\\right]. \\\\qquad(5) Here, R denotes the \\\\tfrac{1}{e^2} \\\\, radius of the beam, and S0 denotes the intensity at the center of the beam. S0 is related to the total power P0 by : S_0 = \\\\frac{2P_0}{\\\\pi R^2}.\\\\qquad(6) Substituting Eq. 5 into Eq. 4, we obtain : C(r,z) = 2\\\\pi S(r)\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} G(r,z)\\\\exp\\\\left [-2\\\\left (\\\\frac{r}{R} \\\\right )^2 \\\\right ]I_0\\\\left (\\\\frac{4rr}{R^2} \\\\right ) r \\\\, dr, \\\\qquad(7) where I0 is the zeroth-order modified Bessel function. Top-hat beam For a top-hat beam of radius R, the source function becomes : S(r') = \\\\begin{cases} S_0, & \\\\text{if }r'\\\\leq R \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\,0, & \\\\text{if }r'> R \\\\end{cases}\\\\qquad(8) where S0 denotes the intensity inside the beam. S0 is related to the total beam power P0 by : S_0 = \\\\frac{P_0}{\\\\pi R^2}.\\\\qquad(9) Substituting Eq. 8 into Eq. 4, we obtain :C(r,z) = 2\\\\pi S_0\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty}G(r,z)I_\\\\phi (r,r)r\\\\,dr,\\\\qquad(10) where : I_\\\\phi (r,r) = \\\\begin{cases} 1, & \\\\mbox{if }R\\\\geq r+r, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\cos^{-1} \\\\left(\\\\tfrac{r^2+r^2-R^2}{2rr} \\\\right ), & \\\\mbox{if } \\\\left r-r \\\\right \\\\leq R < r+r, \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\mbox{if }R < \\\\left  r+r \\\\right . \\\\end{cases}\\\\qquad(11) Errors in numerical evaluation First interactions First photon- tissue interactions always occur on the z axis and hence contribute to the specific absorption or related physical quantities as a Dirac delta function. Errors will result if absorption due to the first interactions is not recorded separately from absorption due to subsequent interactions. The total impulse response can be expressed in two parts: : C(r,z)=G_1(0,z)\\\\frac{\\\\delta (r)}{2\\\\pi r}+ G_2(r,z),\\\\qquad(12) where the first term results from the first interactions and the second, from subsequent interactions. For a Gaussian beam, we have : C(r,z)=G_1(0,z)S(r)+2\\\\pi S_0\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} G_2(r,z)\\\\,exp\\\\left [-2\\\\left (\\\\frac{r-r}{R} \\\\right )^2 \\\\right ]I_{0e}\\\\left(\\\\frac{4rr}{R^2} \\\\right )r\\\\,dr.\\\\qquad(13) For a top-hat beam, we have : C(r,z)=G_1(0,z)S(r)+2\\\\pi S_0\\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} G_2(r,z)I_\\\\phi (r,r)r\\\\,dr.\\\\qquad(14) Truncation error For a top-hat beam, the upper integration limits may be bounded by rmax, such that r ≤ rmax − R. Thus, the limited grid coverage in the r direction does not affect the convolution. To convolve reliably for physical quantities at r in response to a top-hat beam, we must ensure that rmax in photon transport methods is large enough that r ≤ rmax − R holds. For a Gaussian beam, no simple upper integration limits exist because it theoretically extends to infinity. At r >> R, a Gaussian beam and a top-hat beam of the same R and S0 have comparable convolution results. Therefore, r ≤ rmax − R can be used approximately for Gaussian beams as well. Implementation of convolution There are two common methods used to implement discrete convolution: the definition of convolution and fast Fourier transformation (FFT and IFFT) according to the convolution theorem. To calculate the optical broad-beam response, the impulse response of a pencil beam is convolved with the beam function. As shown by Equation 4, this is a 2-D convolution. To calculate the response of a light beam on a plane perpendicular to the z axis, the beam function (represented by a b × b matrix) is convolved with the impulse response on that plane (represented by an a × a matrix). Normally a is greater than b. The calculation efficiency of these two methods depends largely on b, the size of the light beam. In direct convolution, the solution matrix is of the size (a + b − 1) × (a + b − 1). The calculation of each of these elements (except those near boundaries) includes b × b multiplications and b × b − 1 additions, so the time complexity is O[(a + b)2b2]. Using the FFT method, the major steps are the FFT and IFFT of (a + b − 1) × (a + b − 1) matrices, so the time complexity is O[(a + b)2 log(a + b)]. Comparing O[(a + b)2b2] and O[(a + b)2 log(a + b)], it is apparent that direct convolution will be faster if b is much smaller than a, but the FFT method will be faster if b is relatively large. Computational examples The fate of photons can be modeled using a Matlab implementation of the Monte Carlo method (nrel = 1, μa = 0.1, μs=100, g = 0.9, 100,000 photons). Using this Matlab model, the fluence of a 3 × 3 × 3 cm3 region is recorded and the fluence distribution of a broad-beam response is plotted. Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the responses to a pencil beam and a 1-cm top-hat broad-beam, respectively. Direct convolution was used to calculate the broad-beam response in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows the broad-beam response calculated using the FFT method. When the diameter of the light beam is 0.2 cm, direct convolution costs 1.93 seconds, and the FFT method costs 7.35 seconds. When the diameter of the light beam is 2 cm, direct convolution costs 90.1 seconds, and FFT method costs 16.8 seconds. Of course, the absolute computation time depends on the processing speed of the computer being used. These two comparisons were made on the same computer. Although the computation times differ, the plots in Figures 2 and 3 are indistinguishable. {    } See also *Radiative transfer equation and diffusion theory for photon transport in biological tissue *Monte Carlo method *Monte Carlo method for photon transport Links to other Monte Carlo resources *Optical Imaging Laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis (MCML) *Oregon Medical Laser Center References *L.-H.

In August 1971, he was arrested in California along with Albert “Nuh” Washington and Herman Bell and were charged with the killing of two NYPD police officers, Waverly Jones and Joseph A. Piagentini, in New York City on May 21. In 1974, he was convicted on two counts of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with possible parole after 22 years. Muntaqim has been the subject of attention for being repeatedly denied parole despite being eligible since 1993. In June 2020, Muntaqim was reportedly sick with Coronavirus disease. He was released from prison on October 7, 2020, after over 49 years of incarceration and 11 parole denials. Early life and political development Jalil Muntaqim was born Anthony Jalil Bottom in Oakland, California and grew up in San Francisco. Drawn to the civil rights activism during the 1960s, Muntaqim joined and began organizing for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) during his teenage years. In high school he played an active role in the Black Student Union and was often recruited to play the voice of and engage in “speak outs” on behalf of the organization. He was also involved in street protests against police brutality. At the age of 18, Muntaqim joined the Black Panther Party after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. King's assassination solidified Muntaqim's beliefs that armed resistance was necessary to combat racism and the oppression of Black individuals in society. While a member of the Black Panther Party, Muntaqim held beliefs which paralleled those of the underground organization, the Black Liberation Army, which focused on radical means of obtaining equality. Its members served as experts in military strategy and were “the essential armed wing of the above-ground political apparatus.”James, Joy, ed.

Arrest and imprisonment On August 28, 1971, Muntaqim and Albert “Nuh” Washington were arrested for the alleged attempted murder of a San Francisco police sergeant. New York City police charged Muntaqim, Washington, and another BPP and BLA member, Herman Bell, with the May 21, 1971, killings of two New York City police officers. The shootout came after George Jackson was killed by guards during an escape attempt in San Quentin Prison in 1971, which was the possible substantiation for a motive for retaliation. While Washington died of liver cancer in April 2000, in New York State’s Coxsackie Correctional Facility, Bell and Muntaqim were paroled in 2018 and 2020, respectively. Muntaqim remained politically active throughout his incarceration, writing theoretical texts as well as organizing with activists both inside and outside prison. In 1976, he founded the National Prisoners Campaign to petition the United Nations to recognize the existence of political prisoners in the United States. He was also involved in the National Prisoners Afrikan Studies Project, an organization that educates inmates on their rights. In July 2009, Muntaqim pleaded no contest to conspiracy to commit voluntary manslaughter becoming the second person to be convicted in the alleged attempted murder case of the San Francisco police sergeant.2nd guilty plea in 1971 killing of S.F. officer (via SFGate) Parole and Release While abolitionists and organizations within the radical left believe he should be paroled, supporters of the police have forcefully opposed his release. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recently publicized his opposition to parole Muntaqim. He states: “Anthony Bottom's crime is unforgivable, and its consequences will remain forever with the families of the police officers, as well as the men and women of the New York City Police Department.”\\"Mayor Opposes Parole for Man In 1971 Killings of Two Officers\\".

In June 2020, Muntaqim was reported to be under treatment in a prison hospital for Coronavirus disease. He attempted to gain release based on public health guidance advising the release of medically vulnerable people, but New York state attorney general Letitia James challenged the appeal, and the courts struck down a judge’s order mandating his release. Within a few months, however, the parole board approved him for release, and supporters confirmed that he had finally left prison on October 7.

It revolves around the idea of 'emancipating dissonance', that is, freeing the structure of music from the familiar harmonic patterns that are derived from natural overtones. As music becomes more complex, dissonance becomes indistinguishable from consonance. Overview In the latter part of the 19th century, composers began to move away from the tonal system. This is typified in Richard Wagner's music, especially Tristan und Isolde (the Tristan chord, for example). Arnold Schoenberg and his pupil Anton Webern proposed a theory on the emancipation of the dissonance to help analyse the general trend and, in particular, their own atonal music. Composers such as Charles Ives, Dane Rudhyar, and even Duke Ellington and Lou Harrison, connected the emancipation of the dissonance with the emancipation of society and humanity. The basic idea is that as time progresses, the ear becomes acclimatised to more and more complex sounds. This happens not just for individuals but also for societies as they start to write more complex music. Consonance and dissonance become indistinct from each other: dissonances slowly become heard as consonances. Jim Samson explained it this way: \\"As the ear becomes acclimatized to a sonority within a particular context, the sonority will gradually become 'emancipated' from that context and seek a new one. The emancipation of the dominant-quality dissonances has followed this pattern, with the dominant seventh developing in status from a contrapuntal note in the sixteenth century to a quasi-consonant harmonic note in the early nineteenth. By the later nineteenth century the higher numbered dominant-quality dissonances had also achieved harmonic status, with resolution delayed or omitted completely. The greater autonomy of the dominant-quality dissonance contributed significantly to the weakening of traditional tonal function within a purely diatonic context.\\" Theory Music written within the tonal system is generally analysed by defining a certain note as the primary or tonic note and the derived triad is the tonic chord. Other notes and chords are subservient to the tonic and in a strict hierarchy: the dominant note/chord is second in importance, others are lower down still. One example of this style of analysis is called Schenkerian analysis. However, this form of analysis cannot be applied to atonal music since the very point is to make all the notes and chords equal: there is no hierarchy. Instead, notes/chords can be described in terms of their properties and relationships at any particular moment: whether one note is higher than another, whether one chord has more notes than another, whether one chord is more widely spaced than another, and so on. One can also compare and contrast different strings of notes as transpositions (change in pitch) or inversions (change in note order) of each other. These terms are also used to compare chords. These methods of analysis have been used for centuries but became more important as music began to lose its tonal basis. One also needs to consider other aspects, such as how two or more simultaneous melodies relate to each other (counterpoint) and the same tools are used for this. In the later 20th century, analysts started to adapt these tools to the yet more complex music being written. Musical set theory was first elaborated for tonal music but was quickly applied to atonal music since it simply provides concepts for categorizing musical objects (notes, chords, melodies and so on) and describing their relationship, without defining any particular note or chord as \\"primary\\". The later Transformational theory uses a similar approach but concentrates on the relationships themselves. There are also theories which attempt to relate pitch and rhythm. Application Compositional applications of these theories are numerous, but in the present context of post-tonal music the most important is serialism. In this system, certain notes are chosen then written in an order e.g. E-F-C-B- G-F. (Usually there is no repetition, but this is not always observed.) These notes are then used as the basis for a composition by playing them in the original order, in reverse order (retrograde), in \\"upside down\\" order (Inversion i.e. upward intervals now go down, and vice versa), or both (retrograde inversion or \\"reversion\\" [Stravinsky's term]), and then transposed up or down. Chords can also be formed out of the series and these can be treated to similar techniques. Schoenberg used these methods in what has become known as twelve-tone technique. In this, all unique twelve notes of the musical scale are played once and once only in a specified order. The serial techniques described above are then applied. Later composers, such as Jean Barraqué and Pierre Boulez, sought to unify pitch and rhythm by organising the elements into sets of twelve, which resulted in what became known as total serialism. See also Formula composition which describes techniques used by Karlheinz Stockhausen. Aside from serialism, other forms of compositional technique arose such as those based on chords utilizing fourths rather than the more traditional thirds (see quartal and quintal harmony and Synthetic chord), those based on other mathematical processes (see Schillinger System) and those based on specific scales (or \\"modes\\": see hexatonic scale, Heptatonic scale, Octatonic scale and Synthetic scale). Olivier Messiaen in his work The Technique of my Musical Language developed what he called Modes of limited transposition which displayed a special type of symmetry and which he used in numerous compositions. Further developments Microtones and especially quarter tones have been used in music of the 20th and 21st centuries. These are the intervals between semitones. A full theory governing these has yet to be developed but the articles relating to these contain some of the most recent thoughts. (See 15 equal temperament, 19 equal temperament, 24 equal temperament, 34 equal temperament and 72 equal temperament.) Examples Transposition: *The notes A-B-C-D can be transposed downwards to A-B-C-D (the , called a flat, lowers the pitch by one semitone) or upwards to D-E-F-G (the note D is a perfect fourth higher than the note A, E the same amount higher than B and so on). *The chord C-E-G can be transposed upwards to C-E-G (the , called a sharp, raises the pitch by one semitone). Inversion: *The notes D-F-E-B can be reversed to B-E-F-D - This form of inversion is called Retrograde. *The upward intervals can become downward intervals and vice versa - This is the form that is properly called Inversion. *These two can be combined and the result can be transposed: these are inclusive rather than exclusive processes. When viewing the following musical examples, it may help to imagine a mirror being placed between the various versions: How Retrograde and Inversion work . *The chord C-E-G can be inverted to E-G-C or G-C-E - This is called the Inversion of a chord. *Two lines (\\"parts\\") of music can be \\"inverted\\" so that the original lower one is made to sound above the original higher one - this is Inversion of counterpoint and can be applied to any number of parts.

Templeton was a campaigner for African American civil rights in Baltimore, Maryland. He served 25 years as the Executive Director of the Baltimore Urban League, 20 years as a member of Selective Service Board 13 in Baltimore, he was the former Vice-chairman of the Baltimore Housing Authority, a member of a Maryland Commission on Interracial Problems and Relations, and he was also a chairman of the Social Education and Action Committee of the Presbytery of Baltimore.Baltimore News Post, February 16, 1959 Early life Furman L. Templeton (1909–1970) was born in Hackensack, New Jersey.Obituary of Furman L. Templeton, Washington Post, February 16, 1970 He earned a bachelor's degree at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and was awarded an honorary doctor of laws degree by Morgan State College in Baltimore. Professional life In his twenty-five year service to the Baltimore Urban League, Furman L. Templeton was awarded and honored with the Good Citizenship of the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, the Man of the Year Plaque of the Omega Phi fraternity, the Maryland Negro Achievement Medal, and the Certificate of Merit of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Templeton's first position at the Baltimore Urban League was as the Secretary of Industry in 1941, a position the Baltimore Urban League created to increase the number of African Americans working in profitable lines of employment.\\"Templeton Gets Secretarial Post at Urban League,\\" Afro-American; January 4, 1941 Pro-Quest Historical Newspapers Baltimore Afro-American (1893-1988) 24 He was chosen for this position because after he graduated Lincoln University he was the first African American to be appointed an interviewer in the Baltimore office of the state employment service on August 15, 1933 by Oliver C. Short as the white State director. In his first year as the Secretary of Industry in the Baltimore Urban League, Templeton fought for African American painters of Baltimore rights to Union membership.\\"FEC Ponders Union's Bias,\\" Afro-American; September 13, 1941, Pro- Quest Historical Newspapers Baltimore Afro-American (1893-1988) 10 Also that year, Templeton questioned the government purchase of Perryman, Maryland land.\\"Templeton Seeks FSA Probe of Perryman, Md., Land Deal,\\" Afro-American; September 13, 1941 Pro-Quest Historical Newspapers Baltimore Afro-American (1893-1988) This land was going to be used to expand the southwest border of the Aberdeen proving grounds, and was also the home to about 150 families, a third of them were African Americans who were now forced to seek new homes and sell their homes for a quarter of the present purchase price per acre of land, and are buying white homes for more. Later, when Furman L. Templeton served as the Executive Director for the Baltimore Urban League his focus was on education. He created a program for African Americans to advance their educations as well as provide avenues for job placement.Templeton, Furman L., Baltimore Urban League, \\"Occupational Galaxy: Reach For The Stars…\\" (Baltimore, MD: Baltimore Urban League, 1940). Thanks to his efforts in education and involvement in civil rights causes Furman L. Templeton Elementary School, at 1200 Pennsylvania Ave of Baltimore, Maryland is named in his memory. Death Upon his death on February 12, 1970, Furman L. Templeton left his wife Irene Roye-Templeton and their two sons at their residence on the 1500 block of McCulloh Street. Because Templeton worked hard to create equality for the African Americans in Baltimore he left a lasting impact, and a small legacy in the school that is now his namesake. He also left a grandson, Stefan Templeton, b. 1967.

A book about CEO Robbie Case, whose high tech company is built on a lie, Shimmer follows Robbie as he attempts to unwind the lie he has created. The fictional company, Core Communications, is a provider of high end networking services to mainframe computers. Along with his partner and cousin, Robbie has created an elaborate system that supposedly allows mainframe computers to communicate at impossibly fast speeds. However, the system does not work. It is actually built on a technical and financial Ponzi scheme that will fail if the company ever stops expanding.  Reviews of Shimmer  \\"Case's slow but accelerating downward spiral drives the narrative.... The corporate intrigue should hook anyone fascinated by the collapse of Wall Street and the crimes of Bernie Madoff.\\"—Publisher's WeeklyPublisher's Weekly \\"...a sheen of elegance and terror; one is reminded, in Barnes' language and locution, of Don DeLillo's scalpel-sharp delineation of American corporate culture and paranoia, and of David Foster Wallace's penetration into the heart of the relationship between human consciousness and rapidly changing technologies.\\"—Fredric Koeppel, The Commercial Appeal \\"I haven’t been able to get the people in the book out of my head....

His work was widely recognized for its excellence until he became disenchanted with the cocktail-party art circles and preferred to spend most of his time in his studio creating masterpieces in all sizes and media. Nick's early work was mostly soft and dreamy watercolors, while his later work showed increasing power and symbolism. As his interest moved into the combining of Man and Machine, his work could no longer be contained in two-dimensional surfaces and he gravitated to sculpture. Personal life Nick de Angelis, was born in New Jersey as Nicholas Angelo but later changed his surname to the original family name: de Angelis. He served in Europe, Africa and Italy in the U.S. Army, where he was wounded and awarded the Purple Heart. His childhood drawings decorated the walls of his attic bedroom until the 1990s when the house burned down and only a ghostly shell remained. In his early career de Angelis painted exquisite watercolors of street life and café scenes, paintings of Paris and the Seine and of New York coffee houses. De Angelis’ work has evolved significantly during the more than forty years he created art, morphing from realistic to the highly abstract. He worked in whatever media was close at hand in his 57th Street apartment, where he could walk to the Art Students League. His color choices ranged from delicate pastels to bright and clashing primary colors to somber blacks and grays. His portraiture was magnificent and his self-portraits depict much of the pain he experienced in his own life, particularly during his military service. After a long career as an illustrator for various top agencies in New York, de Angelis, in the 1960s, dedicated his life solely to his passion for painting and sculpting, which consumed him to the very end of his life. After Nick's death in 2004 of pancreatic cancer, his wife Josiane de Angelis, was left with a monumental body of work – the content is estimated to thousands of sketches, drawings, watercolors and sculptures. A body of forty years of solitary artwork has never been shown to the public. Career De Angelis was a life member of the Art Students League of New York and a life member of the American Watercolor Society, where he was appointed Vice President, Jury member of A.W.S. for group shows and traveling exhibitions to National Museums. His work has been shown in numerous exhibitions, including: * New York City Center, invitational and jury shows in New York City. * Peter Dietch, invitational drawing show New York City * Guild Hall, invitational exhibition, East Hampton, NY * F.A.R. Gallery, New York City * Frank Eagan, invitational exhibition, New York City * Martha Jackson, group invitational exhibition, New York City * National Arts Club, invitational exhibition, New York City * Salmagundi, invitational exhibition, New York City * Allan Stone Gallery, New York City * Gallery 10, solo and group shows, New Hope Pennsylvania * Arthur Breslauer, Munich, Germany * Slide Exhibitions in the Soviet Union Invitational, directed by William Smith * Illustrated ‘The Vision of Francois the Fox’ by Julia Cunningham, published by Pantheon Books, a division of Random House * Produced eight color paintings for the book ‘Power Sits at Another Table’ by Earl Shorris, published by Simon and Schuster The work of Nicholas de Angelis is with many private collections including: Allan Stone, Chico Hamilton, Erich Knight and the Martinson Coffee Company. The art critic Sidney Gilbert, in a review in the October issue of Artspeak, wrote, \\"Allan Stone mounts a sensational group show... Nick de Angelis shows a masterful monochromatic painting of a mechanical cat, slinky machine parts\\".

The GWPF as well as some of its prominent members have been characterized as promoting climate change denial. In 2014, when the Charity Commission ruled that the GWPF had breached rules on impartiality, a non-charitable organisation called the \\"Global Warming Policy Forum\\" was created as a wholly owned subsidiary, to do lobbying that a charity could not. The GWPF website carries an array of articles \\"sceptical\\" of scientific findings of anthropogenic global warming and its impacts. History The foundation was established in November 2009, a week after the start of the Climatic Research Unit email controversy, with its headquarters in a room of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining at 1 Carlton House Terrace, London, and subsequently moved to 55 Tufton Street, London SW1P 3QL. Its director is Benny Peiser, an expert on the social and economic aspects of physical exercise, and it is chaired by Terence Mordaunt, co-owner of the cargo handling business Bristol Port Company. It was previously chaired by the former Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson. GWPF states that it is \\"deeply concerned about the costs and other implications of many of the policies currently being advocated\\" to address climate change and that it aims to \\"bring reason, integrity and balance to a debate that has become seriously unbalanced, irrationally alarmist, and all too often depressingly intolerant\\". Call for an independent inquiry into Climate Research Unit e-mails The GWPF's first act was to call for a high-level, independent inquiry into the hacked e-mails from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit. A spokesman for the Met Office, a government agency which works with the Climate Research Unit in providing global temperature information, dismissed this call. \\"If you look at the emails, there isn't any evidence that the data was falsified and there's no evidence that climate change is a hoax. It's a shame that some of the sceptics have had to take this rather shallow attempt to discredit robust science undertaken by some of the world's most respected scientists. The bottom line is that temperatures continue to rise and humans are responsible for it. We have every confidence in the science and the various datasets we use. The peer-review process is as robust as it could possibly be.\\" Lawson suggested that the e-mails from the University of East Anglia \\"called into question\\" the integrity of the scientific evidence. Subsequent investigations did not support this view. GWPF Director Benny Peiser said that the organisation did not doubt the science and wasn’t going to discuss it, but want an open, frank debate about what policies should be adopted. Funding sources Because it is registered as a charity, the GWPF is not legally required to report its sources of funding, and Peiser has declined to reveal its funding sources, citing privacy concerns. Peiser said GWPF does not receive funding \\"from people with links to energy companies or from the companies themselves.\\" The foundation has rejected freedom of information (FoI) requests to disclose its funding sources on at least four occasions. The judge ruling on the latest FoI request, Alison McKenna, said that the GWPF was not sufficiently influential to merit forcing them to disclose the source of the £50,000 that was originally provided to establish the organization. Bob Ward, the policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics, commented: :\\"These [FoI] documents expose once again the double standards promoted by ... the GWPF, who demand absolute transparency from everybody except themselves ... The GWPF was the most strident critic during the 'Climategate' row of the standards of transparency practised by the University of East Anglia, yet it simply refuses to disclose basic information about its own secretive operations, including the identity of its funders.\\" In accounts filed at the beginning of 2011 with the Charities Commission and at Companies House, it was revealed that only £8,168 of the £503,302 the Foundation received as income, from its founding in November 2009 until the end of July 2010, came from membership contributions. In response to the accounts, Bob Ward commented that \\"Its income suggests that it only has about 80 members, which means that it is a fringe group promoting the interests of a very small number of politically motivated campaigners.\\" Similarly, based on membership fees reported for the year ending 31 July 2012, it appears that GWPF had no more than 120 members at that time. In March 2012, The Guardian revealed that it had uncovered emails in which Michael Hintze, founder of the hedge fund CQS and a major donor to the UK Conservative Party, disclosed having donated to GWPF; the previous October, Hintze had been at the center of a funding scandal that led to the resignation of then-Secretary of State for Defence Liam Fox and the dismissal of Hintze's then-charity adviser, Oliver Hylton. Chris Huhne, former UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change attacked Lord Lawson's influential climate sceptic think-tank. Charitable status In June 2013 Bob Ward filed a formal complaint to the Charity Commission, alleging that the GWPF had \\"persistently disseminated inaccurate and misleading information about climate change as part of its campaign against climate policies in the UK and overseas\\", and that this was an abuse of their charitable status. In 2014 the Charity Commission ruled that the GWPF had breached rules on impartiality in its climate change coverage, blurred fact and comment and demonstrated a clear bias.\\"Operational Case Report: The Global Warming Policy Foundation (1131448)\\", The Charity Commission, 30 September 2014 In response, the GWPF agreed to establish a non- charitable organisation to do the lobbying, alongside the existing organisation, to be called the \\"Global Warming Policy Forum\\". The GWP Forum is a wholly owned subsidiary of the GWP Foundation. Temperature graph When the GWPF's website was launched in November 2009, a graph used in the logo graphic on each page of the website of '21st Century global mean temperatures' showed a slow decline over the selected period from 2001 to 2008. Hannah Devlin of The Times found an error for 2003 and noted that if the period from 2000 to 2009 had been chosen, then a rise in temperature would have been shown rather than a fall. Bob Ward said that the graph was contrary to the true measurements, and that by leaving out the temperature trend during the 20th century, the graph obscured the fact that 8 of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred this century. The GWPF blamed a \\"small error by our graphic designer\\" for the mistake which would now be changed, but said that starting the graph earlier would be equally arbitrary. Personnel In May 2014, the GWPF listed Benny Peiser, a social anthropologist, as the director, and a board of trustees consisting of Lord Lawson (Chairman), Lord Donoughue, Lord Fellowes, Peter R. Forster (the Bishop of Chester), Martin Jacomb, Baroness Nicholson, Sir James Spooner and Lord Turnbull. Andrew William Montford has been appointed to run an inquiry into the three British Climategate-inquiries for the Global Warming Policy Foundation.Foster, Peter, \\"Peter Foster: Checking the hockey team \\", National Post, July 9, 2010. \\"The third British investigation into the Climategate scandal -- led by former civil servant Sir Muir Russell -- amounts, at best, to a greywash. [...] The U.K.-based Global Warming Policy Foundation, an influential skeptical institution, has now appointed Mr. Montford to run an inquiry into the three British inquiries. There will be no whitewash here, \\" His report The Climategate Inquiries was published in September 2010.Randerson, James, \\"'Climategate' inquiries were 'highly defective', report for sceptic thinktank rules\\", The Guardian, 14 September 2010. One of the Foundation's trustees, Graham Stringer MP, a Labour party politician, sits on the House of Commons' Science and Technology Committee, a Parliamentary select committee which scrutinises government actions in relation to topics including climate change. Media reception David Aaronovitch noted the GWPF's launch in The Times, writing \\"Lord Lawson’s acceptance of the science turns out, on close scrutiny, to be considerably less than half-hearted. Thus he speaks of 'the (present) majority scientific view', hinting rather slyly at the near possibility of a future, entirely different scientific view. (...) 'Sceptic' (...) is simply a misnomer. People such as Lord Lawson are not sceptical, for if one major peer-reviewed piece of scientific research were ever to be published casting doubt on climate change theory, you just know they’d have it up in neon at Piccadilly Circus. They are only sceptical about what they don’t want to be true.\\" The Guardian quoted Bob Ward as saying \\"some of those names are straight from the Who's Who of current climate change sceptics ... It's just going to be a way of pumping material into the debate that hasn't been through scrutiny\\". The Guardian article cast doubt on the idea that an upsurge in scepticism was underway, noting that \\"in (the US) Congress, even the most determined opponents of climate change legislation now frame their arguments in economic terms rather than on the science\\". Fred Pearce wrote in The Guardian that the three inquiries GWPF looked into were all badly flawed, and that The Climategate Inquiries report ably dissects their failures. He writes that \\"for all its sharp—and in many cases justified—rejoinders to the official inquiries its report is likely to be ignored in some quarters for its brazen hypocrisy.\\" Pearce argues that one of the criticisms of the three inquiries was that no climate sceptics were on the inquiry teams, and now the critics themselves have produced a review of the reviews that included no one not already supportive of the sceptical position. But, Pearce wrote, Montford \\"has landed some good blows here.\\" Pearce, Fred. \\"Montford lands some solid blows in review of 'climategate' inquiries\\", The Guardian, 14 September 2010.

There are few books about it and it is thought to be underreported.Gibbs, Verna C. “Chapter 22. The Retained Surgical Sponge.” As a preventable medical error, it occurs more frequently than \\"wrong site\\" surgery. The consequences of retained surgical tools include injury, repeated surgery, excess monetary cost, loss of hospital credibility and in some cases death of patient.Renee Nimitz, Surgical Instrumentation: an Interactive Approach (Saunders, 2010) 1416037020, pxiii  Mistakes and consequences  In any given typical surgery, an estimated 250–300 surgical tools are used.Institute of Medicine. To Err Is Human- Building a Safer Healthcare System pg.43 The number significantly increases to 600 when a larger surgery is performed, thus increasing the chance of the surgeon losing an instrument. Types of forgotten instruments  SmartSponge system, an RFID system to aid doctors in tracking sponges and other surgical items during surgery There are many different types of tools that have been left behind during a surgery. Common instruments are needles, knife blades, safety pins, scalpels, clamps, scissors, sponges, towels, and electrosurgical adapters. Also retained are tweezers, forceps, suction tips and tubes, scopes, ultrasound tissue disruptors, asepto bulbs,Sakhel, Khaled and James Hines. “To Forget is Human: the case of the retained bulb.” Journal of Robotic Surgery pgs. 45–47 cryotomes and cutting laser guides, and measuring devices. The single most common left behind object is a sponge.“Surgical Instruments Left in Patient’s Body.” Nursing Link. Frequency The estimate of how often this type of mistake happens is unclear. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, it is anywhere between 1 in 100 to 1 in 5000. However a study done in 2008 reported to the Annals of Surgery that mistakes in tool and sponge counts happened in 12.5% of surgeries.Gamble, Kate Huvane. “No Sponge Left Behind”, Health Care Informatics. Additionally, the Patient Safety Monitor Alert, announced in 2003 that 1,500 tools were stitched into patients each year.\\"Emergencies, Procedure Changes Contribute to Left-Behind Surgical Instruments.\\" Patient Safety Monitor Alert. Khaled Sakhel, part of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Eastern Virginia Medical School, reported that it is expected to occur at least once “in every 1,000–1,500” stomach surgeries. An exact count of how often this happens would be impossible to calculate. The Joint Commission on Accreditation for Healthcare Organization (JCAHO) stated that “unintentionally retained foreign bod(ies) without major permanent loss of function” (qtd. in Gibbs) are not required to be reported. Nurses have been discouraged against reporting all errors because of the threat of malpractice and liability issues. Estimates are “undoubtedly low.”  Gossypiboma  Gossypiboma is the official name for a retained sponge/towel after surgery. This word comes from the Latin word for cotton, gossypium, combined with the Swahili word for place of concealment, boma.Fortia, Mohamed El, Maroua Bendaoud, and Sumer Sethi. \\"Abdominal Gossypiboma (Textilioma).\\" Internet Journal of Radiology It is also commonly referred to as textilioma. This word combines textile, meaning cloth, and the suffix –oma, which means growth or tumor. A case of gossypiboma can be subtle and may not be discovered until months or even years after the surgery has been performed. In rare cases, a situation can be so severe that it is noticed immediately. Some of the ways gossypiboma can present itself are as a mass in the body or as a bowel tumor.Zbar AP, A. Agrawal, I.T.Saeedi, and MRA Utidjian. “Gossypiboma revisited: a case report and review of the literature.” Immediately after surgery, a case of gossypiboma can commonly be mistaken for an abscess, especially when it is near a passage between organs (a ‘fistula’). In those cases where a sponge isn’t discovered until much later, it may be impossible to tell the difference between gossypiboma and an ‘intra-abdominal abscess’. This is because both cause air bubbles and “calcification of the cavity wall.” Gossypiboma is difficult to diagnose due to vague, inconsistent symptoms and images from x-rays that provide no solid evidence and unclear results. Because it is difficult to diagnose, emphasis has been put on the prevention of the mistake. The following techniques have been put into practice to prevent gossypiboma. *Radiopaque marking: Before operation, sponges can be soaked through with ‘radio-opaque marker’. This allows a sponge to be easily seen on plain radiographs. When the markers are noticed, it can be assumed that it is revealing a retained sponge. A.P. Zbar, Surgical Directorate at Oldchurch and Harold Wood Hospitals stated “the diagnosis is easily made by plain abdominal radiography, when a radio-opaque marker is seen”. This method is flawed in that it doesn’t work if the sponges have broken into smaller pieces over time. *Ultrasonography- Gossypiboma can be recognized with ultrasonography by “the presence of brightly echogenic wavy structures in a cystic mass showing posterior acoustic shadowing that changes in parallel with the direction of the ultrasound beam” according to Zbar and associates. *Computerized Tomography (CT)- A surgical sponge on a CT will show air bubbles on soft tissue masses. The flaw with this technique is that gossypibomas are easily confused with abscesses.  Consequences Dangers of a tool or sponge left behind range anywhere from harmless to life- threatening. Surgical tools left in the body can puncture vital organs and blood vessels, causing internal bleeding. Sponges can fester inside a body, growing increasingly dangerous over time. Additional operations may be necessary, which can be costly and also take the surgical table away from other patients with more urgent needs. Michael Blum said “The incidents observed…took an average of 13 minutes to resolve, a time lapse which can significantly impact the flow of a busy emergency or perioperative department.” Another danger is a sponge can be misdiagnosed, resulting in an unnecessary extreme surgery. A radical surgery can be avoided by considering the possibility of a retained sponge or tool.Rajagopal, Ambil F.R.C.S. and Joseph Martin M.S. “Gossypiboma-“A Surgeon’s Legacy.” Diseases of the Colon and Rectum  Contributing factors  Many studies have taken place to pinpoint the causes of tools being forgotten in hopes that they may be avoided in the future. It has been thought that the amount of blood lost in a surgery or the changing of nurses during the surgery would influence the risk of losing something, but studies do not support this. Human factors such as exhaustion, lack of tools necessary to aid in producing an accurate count, and a chaotic environment all have been seen to increase the risk of forgetting a tool.“Emergencies, Procedure Changes Contribute to Left-Behind Surgical Instruments.” Patient Safety Monitor Alert. These factors cannot be controlled and surgeons must learn to mitigate them. Inaccurate counts are a main reason why tools can be left behind. Many cases of a retained instrument originally reported a correct sponge count when the patient was released. An inaccurate count can occur when nurses are deprived of sleep, when the operation is particularly difficult, long, and mentally draining, when the operation is an emergency, or when there are unforeseen changes in the procedure. An increased amount of chaos and distractions lead to a higher risk of a surgeon forgetting a tool. Mark Hulse from North Shore Medical Center said the following about surgery; “It’s a process that’s definitely subject to interruption and can be prone to errors. You’re doing a hundred other things at the same time, and as much as you try to keep your attention on it [sponge counts] if the surgeon needs something, it’s easy to get distracted.” Some aspects of surgery that can add to chaos are performing unforeseen changes in the procedure and undergoing emergency surgery.Gawande AA, et al. “Risk Factors for Retained Instruments and Sponges After Surgery.” N Engl J Med pg. 348 Consequently, the emergency room is the place most likely to make mistakes.Institute of Medicine. To Err Is Human- Building a Safer Healthcare System. pg.37 Studies have shown having a high body mass index increases risk. Boston researchers found that a one-point increase in BMI related to a higher risk by 10%. The researchers suggest that “they [surgeons] chalk it up to more room in a patient in which to lose things.”Rasich, Paula. “Surgical Tools.”  Retained Surgical Instruments and Unretrieved Device Fragments (UDF)  In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) published a Public Health Notification advising on serious adverse events arising from fragments of medical devices left behind after surgical procedures, known as unretrieved device fragments (UDFs). The FDA's Centre for Devices and Radiological Health receives around 1000 adverse event reports each year relating to UDFs.FDA. \\"Unretrieved Device Fragments.\\"Fischer, R. \\"Danger: Beware of Unretrieved Device Fragments.\\" One major source of UDFs is from the failure of surgical instruments.Health Devices. \\"Top 10 Technology Hazards.\\" There are many risks from UDFs. The FDA states: \\"The adverse events reported include local tissue reaction, infection, perforation and obstruction of blood vessels, and death. Contributing factors may include biocompatibility of the device materials, location of the fragment, potential migration of the fragment, and patient anatomy. During MRI procedures, magnetic fields may cause metallic fragments to migrate, and radiofrequency fields may cause them to heat, causing internal tissue damage and/or burns\\"  Preventing incidents  Improvement in lowering the number of mistakes likely depends upon improving the surgical system, and not in individual scapegoating. According to the Institute of Medicine, “the problem is not bad people; the problem is that the system needs to be made safer.”Institute of Medicine. To Err Is Human- Building a Safer Healthcare System. pg. 49 In order to improve the system and reduce the number of accidents, some hospitals require four counts of sponges and instruments.Berguer, Ramon and Paul J. Heller. \\"Preventing Sharps Injuries in the Operating Room.\\" The first count happens when the instruments are being set up and the sponges unwrapped. The next count is required right before surgery begins, another count as closure begins, and finally a count during skin closure. This is a general guideline and there are different count methods according to different hospitals. While careful counting could prevent some mistakes, counting carries its own risks. Sometimes the patient must be worked on immediately, leaving no time to count the instruments to be used beforehand. Another risk of counting after is having to leave the patient under anesthesia longer. In addition, counting may not be entirely beneficial as counting is prone to human error and the majority of the cases of gossypiboma and other retained tools happen under a reported correct count. Dr. Atul A. Gawande, a surgeon, said in an article published in The New England Journal of Medicine that “even though you're following procedures, the priority is the patient, not the procedures.” A new technique that is developing is similar to the Bar Code Medication Administration. The University of California at San Francisco and North Shore Medical Center have installed a “bar coded sponge management system”, reasoning that technological error is smaller than human error. Each surgical instrument has a bar code placed on it and nurses pass the items through a hand scanner. The bar code allows each sponge to be identified, resulting in little to no room for error. UCSF reported in April 2008 to have not had \\"any unintended retained gauze or sponges” since the installation of the system in April 2007.

History A post office was active here from 1909 to 1974, when the settlement was known as McGivney Junction. One was also located here from 1955 until 1970. McGivney, NB is where the CN Miramichi subdivision (McGivney - Newcastle) and the CN Nashwaak subdivision (McGivney - Fredericton) met the CN Napadogan subdivision (Moncton - Edmundston). Freight and passenger trains rolled through on the Napadogan sub, while local freights went north and south on the other two subdivisions. In time, the Miramichi and Nashwaak subdivisions were abandoned, and all that remains is the Napadogan subdivision with its occasional freight trains. No. 32 Ordnance Depot Opened in 1942 on Highway #8 in the Village of McGivney as No. 1 Magazine Company, a Detachment of No. 7 Ordnance Depot. The depot, run by the Royal Canadian Ordnance Corps, consisted of 24 buildings. The Depot remained open after World War II and was renamed No. 2 Ordnance Depot, but not long after, it was changed to No. 32 Ordnance Depot. Permanent Married Quarters were added in the 1950s. As a result of the Unification, the Depot was renamed No. 32 Canadian Forces Ammunition Depot in 1966, but this would be short-lived. The Unification lead to the consolidation of numerous military establishments. No. 32 CFAD was deemed redundant and as a result, closed in 1969. Today some of the Depot's buildings remain, including the ammunition storage bunkers and less than half of the PMQs. The camp chapel is now a Baptist church and Sergeants’ Mess was relocated off site, for use as the South Portage Recreation Center.

The sculpture is located at the corner of Blackford and Vermont Streets, on the southeast lawn of the Science Building, and is on long-term loan from the Indianapolis Museum of Art. Description Spaces with Iron, created in 1972, is made of cast iron and bronze. It measures high, wide, and long. The work consists of two open rectangular pieces. One elongated rectangle is cast in bronze; the other piece, almost square, is cast iron. The cast-iron rectangle is taller than the bronze piece, but the bronze piece is wider. Both forms sit upright, parallel to each other, and are connected with an iron piece resting across the bottom of each piece. The sculpture sits on a cylindrical-shaped concrete base. A bronze rectangular cuboid rests on each rectangular piece on the sculpture's proper left side. The edges of both cuboids extend beyond the sides of the rectangular pieces. Spaces with Iron \\"draws attention to the negative spaces created by the sculpture's openings as well as the environment in which it resides.\\" Acquisition The Indianapolis Museum of Art acquired Spaces with Iron in 1981 through the Helen Benjamin Fund and assigned it accession number 81.220.The accession number means it was the 220th piece acquired in 1981. Artist New York City artist Will Horwitt was a modernist sculptor who was born in 1934 and spent his adolescence in Stockbridge, Massachusetts. From 1952 to 1954 he studied at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1965 he received the Guggenheim Fellowship for creative sculpture. Three years later he was awarded the Tiffany Purchase Grant. New York Times art critic Art Canaday commends Horwitt as \\"a most gratifying workman...The simplified subtly warped forms in expressive balances are consistently mindful of Brancusi, but that is a good point of departure. Mr. Horwitt comes through as one of the strongest young sculptures around.\\" Horwitt's works appear in many public and private collections, including those of Nelson Rockefeller, Vera and Albert List, and Helen and Robert Benjamin. His sculptures are featured in the Yale University Art Gallery, the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Wadsworth Atheneum, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, the Neuberger Museum of Art, the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, NY, and at IUPUI. Horwitt's works are strongly rooted in geometric forms. His minimalist pieces have been favorably viewed by many critics throughout his career. Horwitt \\"reflects [on] the dominance of a certain preoccupation with the language of the space and lines that express the evocative forms of both his drawings and sculptures.\\" According to Al Brunelle, writer for Art in America, Horwitt's pieces are, \\"expressive...they transmit a feeling that is vital and concrete like everyday life experience.\\" His last exhibition was at the Vanderwoude Tananbaum Gallery in New York City. He died of lymphoma in 1985 in New York City at the age of fifty one. Location Spaces with Iron was acquired by Newfields (formerly the Indianapolis Museum of Art) in 1981. In 1985 it was moved from the southwest corner of the sculpture court to the north of Newfields’ Krannert Pavilion. The sculpture was moved again in 1990 to Newfield's southeastern lawn by the parking lot, to either the north or west side. In late January 2009 it was removed from the Newfields grounds and installed on the IUPUI campus, at the corner of Blackford and Vermont Streets on the southeast lawn of the Science Building. Spaces with Iron is one of four pieces on long-term loan to IUPUI from the Indianapolis Museum of Art. The others are Portrait of History, Mega- Gem, and East Gate/West Gate. Three pieces were transported to IUPUI in January 2009; however, due to its size, East Gate/West Gate was flown by helicopter to campus in March 2009. These pieces and other public art are installed along a portion of the Indianapolis Cultural Trail, a bikeway and pedestrian path that \\"connects neighborhoods, entertainment facilities and the city's five cultural districts\\": Indiana Avenue, Massachusetts Avenue, Fountain Square, the Wholesale District, and White River State Park.

Some accounts place the captures at Onrust Island. One of the vessels they captured was a newly built Dutch brig.Milo (June 1941) reports that the British captured the newly constructed brig Ajax. This would then probably be the vessel that became the Admiral Rainier. Captain Henry Lidgbird Ball of Daedalus ordered her manned, armed, and equipped. Admiral Rainier was commissioned under Lieutenant William Hugh Dobbie of Centurion.The gentleman's magazine, and historical chronicle, Volume 100, Part 2, pp.181–2. She was armed with 14 guns, a mix of 6-pounders and 4-pounders. The British employed her in the blockade of Batavia. On 28 October Admiral Rainier went up the Carawang river with seven armed boats of the squadron to destroy a depot of grain. She accomplished the task after destroying five proas protecting the place. The British carried off three gunboats, together with the commandant's accommodation boat and three large proas laden with coffee. British losses were two killed and six wounded. In 1802 Wellesley, the Governor-General of India, recalled the squadron. The vessels were needed in India for the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803–1805). At the recall, Lieutenant Dobbie returned to Centurion; By 26 February 1803 Dobbie was acting commander of the EIC's brig Ternate and about to attack pirates at \\"Baite Island\\" off the coast of Gujarat. Admiral Rainier was sold in September 1803. Franco-Dutch service The French squadron operating in the Indian Ocean under the command of Rear Admiral Linois, captured two brigs in February 1804 and sent them in to Batavia: a 16-gun brig called Admiral Rainier (1 February), and the Henrietta of 12 guns and fourteen 24-pounder carronades (12 February ). The two prizes arrived at Batavia where Linois was in a hurry to sell them. He therefore accepted a price from the \\"shabendar\\" of 133,000 piastres for both vessels and their cargoes. Admiral Rainier was taken into local colonial service as Admiraal Rainier under Captain-lieutenant Etienne Couderc.Milo (1942); van Maanen (2008)Roche (2005) has no mention of any such vessel in French service but that is not surprising as she was probably never in service before she was sold locally. The Dutch immediately put Admiraal Rainier to use patrolling off Batavia. Towards the end of May, under 1st Lieut. H.D. Andreae, she patrolled the Karimunjawa islands to suppress piracy. Her crew consisted of 24 European sailors, 15 marines and 58 Javanese. In January 1805 she was decommissioned due to a shortage of seamen. Between 20 and 28 October 1805 she sailed from Semarang to Batavia under command of lieutenant Louis Quarles van Ufford. On this short voyage she had a crew of 40 Europeans and 25 Javanese recruits.Nationaal Archief, Archief Louis Quarles van Ufford, 2.21.455, inv.nr. 4. In April 1806 she departed to patrol off the north coast of Java. Her commanding officer was Captain-lieutenant Christiaan Monkenberg. On board were 12 Europeans and 36 Javanese. During the night of 28–29 April the Javanese mutinied and murdered the Europeans, throwing their bodies overboard. A native quartermaster then took command and sailed Admiraal Rainier first to Borneo and then to the Riau Archipelago, now part of the Indonesia province of Riau Islands. Unable to join up with any pirates, and running out of stores, the brig sailed to Penang. Apparently, there the British seized her. Lloyd's List reported that the Indiaman Dover Castle had retaken Admiral Rainer, country-ship, at , on 30 December 1806. According to the account, Admiral Rainer had been captured by a corvette.Lloyd's List №4180, - accessed 8 May February 2019. The officers and men of the EIC's ships and received salvage money in October 1810 for the recapture of Admiral Rainier on 31 December 1806, as did the crew of . A vessel named Admiral Rainier, of 250 tons (bm), was still registered at Calcutta in 1809.

Advertisements for lawyers and law firms take various forms: print, television, radio, the yellow pages, and online advertising. Among the most common type of legal advertisements are those by tort lawyers, whose branch of law includes personal injury, medical malpractice, negligence, and product liability cases involving compensation for harm or damages caused by another. Yet legal advertisements are used by lawyers who specialize in other areas of the practice of law, including criminal defense, bankruptcy, property law, and family law.  History  Before the Canons of Professional Ethics were published by the American Bar Association (ABA) in 1908, advertising within the legal profession was common.Parkinson, Michael G., and Sabrina Neeley. \\"Attorney Advertising: Does It Meet Its Objective?\\" Services Marketing Quarterly. 24.3 (2003). The ABA believed that lawyer advertising was unprofessional and shone a negative light on the profession of law. They also realized that a court was a place where parties can \\"inflict heavy losses on one another\\".Reichstein, Kenneth J. \\"Ambulance Chasing: A Case Study of Deviation and Control Within the Legal Profession\\". Society for the Study of Social Problems. 13.1 (1965): 3-17. The ABA wanted to prevent the bringing forth of cases wherein there was no basis for their claim. Lawyers were still allowed to be included in law directories which contained the lawyers basic information, including their name and contact information. They were also allowed to print business cards and use professional letterhead, but otherwise advertising was strictly prohibited. The Chicago Bar Association believed that \\"The most worthy and effective advertisement possible...is the establishment of a well-merited reputation for professional capacity and fidelity to trust\\".  Concerns  In the Bates v. State Bar of Arizona case, the Arizona State Bar argued against advertising by law firms because they believed that advertising would place too much burden on the legal system. They believed that the advertising may be too effective and dangerously increase litigation. They also believed that lawyers would raise the cost of their services in order to compensate for their increased overhead due to the additional cost of advertising. Another fear was that the legal profession would be viewed as a common trade rather than the noble profession they believed they were part of. Bar associations and consumer advocates were concerned that the members of the public would not protect themselves against false or misleading lawyer advertisements. The bar also argued that legalizing advertising would cause more and more people to pursue a career in law. This was a result of a study that showed that between the years of 1951 and 1971 the number of lawyers increased by 326%. They also believed that an increase in advertising would promote a larger client base and would make it harder for lawyers to serve their clients.  Bates v. State Bar of Arizona  In 1972 John Bates and Van O'steen were admitted to the State Bar of Arizona.Morgan, Thomas D. Legal Ethics (2005), p. 145. Immediately after their admittance to the bar the pair began working for the Maricopa County Legal Aid Society.Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350 (1977). After working there for a period of two years they founded their own practice. As a firm they handled cases for clients who could not qualify for government grants despite moderate incomes. Bates and O’steen decided that, rather than charge expensive fees for their services, they would focus on a large volume of cases in order to generate their income; as such, the firm focused its practice on low-fee cases such as uncontested divorces, adoptions, simple bankruptcy cases, and name changes. They realized that in order to obtain the necessary volume they needed to advertise their name and their services to the public. Bates and O’steen placed an advertisement in the Arizona Republic on February 22, 1976. The State Bar acted reviewed the case. Both Bates and O'steen were suspended from practicing law for six months in accordance with the regulations of the State Bar of Arizona. Bates and O'steen petitioned the Arizona Supreme Court to review their case on the grounds that a total ban on advertisement violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The state supreme court rejected both of their claims, but did reduce their suspensions, in part, because the court believed that Bates and O’steen advertised as a way to test the constitutionality of the ban on advertising within the legal industry. The Supreme Court of the United States recognized that they had the power to review judicial decisions of lower courts and set the case for argument. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger threw out the claim that a total ban on advertising by lawyers and law firms was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. He based his position on the precedent set in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar. This case set the precedent that \\"lawyers engage in trade or commerce,\\" and lawyers and the practice of law were therefore NOT exempt from the Sherman Antitrust Act. On the claim of the violation of free speech, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Bates and O'steen, stating that Arizona's ban of advertising \\"inhibit[ed] the free flow of information and ke[pt] the public in ignorance\\". The Supreme Court therefore removed the ban on advertising. However, they still allowed the State Bar to \\"regulate\\" advertising in order to make certain that the information presented was true and did not mislead others or make false claims. State bar associations across the country quickly began to lift their bans on advertising.Journal of Accountancy 143.5 (1977): 27-28.  Advertising boom  After the U.S. Supreme Court decision, law firm advertising activity increased significantly. Initially the majority of lawyer advertisements were directed at \\"car wreck\\" victims. Later, advertising attempted to recruit clients affected by medications that were recalled for safety reasons or had unanticipated or undisclosed side effects. In the top 75 television markets nationwide, 2,000 lawyers advertise on television and spend close to $200 million collectively on advertising.Freedman, Michael. \\"New Techniques in Ambulance Chasing.\\" Forbes. 168.12 (2001): 56-8. Twenty percent of low-income households who have sought after legal counsel or advice have found their lawyer through the lawyer’s advertisements.Fulkerson, Jennifer. \\"When Lawyers Advertise\\". American Demographics. 17.6 (1995): 54-6. It is estimated that 75 percent of law firms advertise. Research has suggested that the smaller the firm the more likely they are to advertise. According to an article published in the Service Marketing Quarterly, 94% of Americans are familiar with lawyer television advertisements.  Regulations  The ABA has laid down a standard for regulation of lawyer advertising: “The state may prohibit speech that is false or misleading. If the communications are truthful and non-deceptive, the state may limit [advertisements] if the state asserts a substantial government interest. The regulation under scrutiny must directly advance state interest. The regulation must be a reasonable fit narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.\\" There has conflict between law firms and the ABA since lawyer advertising was made legal. The ABA's rules do not have force of law and are not enforced by state bar associations. Individual state bar associations continue to restrict and regulate advertisements. For example, New York print ads are only allowed to contain the address and phone number and only print specialties unless the firm is licensed in that specialty. Court cases that have been filed challenging advertisements typically involve advertising that is absurd to crude but more often than not the advertiser wins as courts uphold the lawyer’s right of free speech. For example, a case in Florida is being reviewed by the Supreme Court of Florida in which lawyers sent direct-mail solicitations to those who had been affected by wrongful-death or personal injury. Forms of advertising In past decades, legal advertising relied heavily on traditional phone directories, notably including Yellow Pages advertisements. In more recent years, as the use of traditional telephone directories has declined, advertisement efforts have shifted to other media and technologies. Lawyers advertise in traditional media, including television, the radio and in newspapers. Due to the cost of television advertising, marketing through television is usually limited to a small number of law firms with large advertising budgets, and to lawyer networks and commercial referral services that direct clients to participating lawyers. Relatively small numbers of lawyers advertise on radio. With the decline of the printed newspaper, much lawyer advertising has shifted away from print and has gone online. Some lawyers have historically marketed their services through client newsletters. Historically newsletters were printed documents that were mailed to clients. Many law firm newsletters are now offered by email. Some lawyers directly market themselves to potential clients by direct mail. For targeted direct mail, lawyers may obtain information about people who have potential legal issues from public records or other sources, then contact those potential clients to indicate that they are available to provide representation. Direct mail advertising must be conducted carefully to avoid violating state rules of professional conduct. Lawyers may also send non- targeted advertisements by mail, such as general information about their law firm and its services or invitations to attend seminars conducted by the firm. Most law firms now have at least a basic website to market their services. Many law firms use various forms of online marketing and advertisement to reach prospective clients, including promotions through media focused on their local market, participation in advertising networks, the use of social media, and online directories and referral services. Some lawyers market themselves by publishing information online, whether on their own websites or weblogs, or through third party websites.

North Macedonia has an embassy in Moscow and a consulate in St. Petersburg, while Russia has an embassy in Skopje and consulates in Bitola and Ohrid. Chargé d'Affaires of North Macedonia in Moscow is Olivera Čauševska- Dimovska, while the Russian ambassador in Skopje is Sergey Bazdnikin (as of September 2019). Political relations Both countries have predominantly Slavic and Orthodox Christian populations, and the former president of North Macedonia, Gjorgje Ivanov, once described their relations as friendlyInterview of President Gjorge Ivanov with ITAR-TASS Macedonian Information Agency. 19-04-2010, but in reality they are ambiguous. North Macedonia does not recognize the Russian annexation of Crimea and it respects the territorial integrity of Ukraine, and on March 27, 2014, it approved the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 68/262. The most contentious issue is the accession of North Macedonia to NATO. The former Russian ambassador Oleg Shcherbak even warned the government of North Macedonia that: \\"If it came to a conflict between Russia and NATO, you will have the role of a legitimate target\\". The Defense Minister of North Macedonia, Radmila Šekerinska, accused the Russian government of trying to interfere in North Macedonia's affairs , while its prime minister Zoran Zaev was a target of the pro-Kremlin pranksters Vovan and Lexus. On April 2, 2018, North Macedonia expelled Russian diplomats over the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. In 2017, some media claimed that Russian spies and diplomats, together with their supporters from Serbia, have been involved in an effort to spread propaganda and provoke discord in North Macedonia with a goal to stop the country from joining NATO and to pry it away from western influence. Since proclaiming its independence in 1991, North Macedonia is pursuing a consistent pro-Western policy. It joined the NATO program Partnership for Peace in 1995 and a decade later, it officially became a European Union candidate. However, some analysts claim that the former prime minister Nikola Gruevski tried to flirt with Moscow, at least during his late tenure. These policy fluctuations are explained as North Macedonia's disillusionment with the West. The European Union and NATO delayed North Macedonia's accession for too long, and also, they are perceived by some ethnic Macedonians as positively biased towards the Albanian minority and neighbouring Kosovo. In this situation, Russia claims to be a protector of the ethnic Macedonian interests. But despite occasional fluctuations, North Macedonia's policy remains pro-Western. The sole Russophile political party in the country is Edinstvena Makedonija, led by Janko Bačev, but its influence is negligible. In 2008, North Macedonia and Russia signed a mutual and conditional visa-waiver agreement, according to which, a visa is not required if the traveller possesses an original tourist voucher or an official letter of invitation, but if these conditions are not met, a visa is still required. Later, North Macedonia unilaterally lifted these special requirements, giving the Russians a real visa-free access to the country (see: Visa requirements for Russian citizens). However, this friendly gesture was not met with reciprocity on the Russian side. For the citizens of North Macedonia, the agreement and its special requirements are still in force (see: Visa requirements for citizens of North Macedonia).

Stroitransgaz is owned by Gennady Timchenko, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, who was among the first businessmen to be placed under sanctions by the United States in the Crimea crisis. A spokesman for Stroitransgaz said the sanctions would not hamper the project in North Macedonia, which is not a member of the European Union. The Negotino-Klečovce gas pipeline will cross North Macedonia from near the Greek border in the south up to the vicinity of the Serbian border in the north. Stroitransgaz will build of the link by June 2016. Moscow plans to build an undersea pipeline to Turkey, a replacement for the cancelled South Stream project via Bulgaria. The details of an onward route from Turkey through Greece have not been finalised. Stroitransgaz said it will carry out its work as part of the repayment of the outstanding debt between the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia, of which North Macedonia was a member. The cost of the entire project stands at $75.7 million. The project has added to tensions between the West and Russia. Following violent interethnic clashes in the northern city of Kumanovo on the 9th of May 2015, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused the West of trying to incite an overthrow of the government of North Macedonia in order to undermine the project. After a meeting between officials from North Macedonia and Russia in March 2016, it was announced that the government of North Macedonia is interested in increasing Russian tourism in the country.

The consumer is asked to fill in their personal details, payment method and agree with the terms and conditions. Up until 2010, Webloyalty and other loyalty companies used a different method for registration. Via the so-called 'data-pass', these companies were able to instantly make use of the consumer's credit card data after its initial purchase on the retailers’ website and bill the consumer a monthly membership fee. As the consumer was not prompted to enter their payment data again to register, many were unaware that clicking 'yes' enrolled them automatically in a monthly paid programme, often only discovering months later that they subscribed. This practice generated numerous complaints resulting in coverage on international newspapers. and money advice websites. These practices were described as \\"misleading, but [...] not illegal'. This resulted in some retailers in the UK, including Debenhams and B&Q;, to sever and suspend their links with Webloyalty after a wave of complaints. Webloyalty and other loyalty programme companies no longer makes use of the data-pass method. They now require all consumers to manually re-enter their credit card details in order to register.  Court cases, convictions, and settlements for fraudulent practices  Affinion has paid millions of dollars in civil claims and state attorney general claims, in 47 states, for unfair and deceptive trade practices, and faces multiple class-action lawsuits. See also U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts case number: 1:14-cv-10283. For example, Afinion settled a case with the State of New York for consumer fraud, as a result of which a fund is maintained to fully reimburse people whose money was stolen by Affinion's fraudulent practices.  US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation Hearing  The United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation announced on 28 May 2009 a Senate Commerce Committee investigation, led by chairman Jay Rockefeller into \\"certain e-commerce marketing practices that generate thousands of mysterious monthly charges to consumer credit cards\\". On 17 November 2009, Webloyalty in the US, Affinion Group and Vertrue were called before the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation to explain its business practices during a full committee hearing on \\"Aggressive Sales Tactics on the Internet and their Impact on American Consumers\\". The hearings investigated the companies' business practices, whereby consumers were enrolled in a \\"membership rewards\\" or \\"loyalty\\" club, often without their knowledge, after having purchased something through a separate website. The committee investigation found that Webloyalty and other \\"loyalty club\\" companies \\"used aggressive sales tactics to enroll online consumers in services without their consent\\". The chairman of the committee introduced the \\"Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act\\" on 5 January 2010 to \\"end the deceptive online sales tactics\\" as a conclusion to the investigation. The Congress' act was considered and passed by the Senate on 30 November 2010, and considered and passed the House of Representatives on 15 December 2010. The act was eventually approved on 29 December 2010. Webloyalty responded on 19 May 2010 to the introduction of the act by stating it had \\"refined its practices to help address senators' concerns and that it will fully comply with the bill once it is enacted\\" and that it changed its business practices by requiring consumers to enter their full credit card information to enroll. Additionally, the company claimed to have improved their after-sales (or post- enrollment) process by sending frequent communications to its members and introduced “no hassle” cancellations.

The electrical cooperatives Cooperative Power Association (CPA) and United Power Association (UPA) proposed construction of the powerline, which was part of a larger project that also involved the construction of an electrical generating station and coal mine. Opposition to the powerline began in 1974 and involved political parties, churches, civic organizations, and businesses in several different Minnesota counties. Farmers were concerned that construction of the powerline on their land might make farming difficult, reduce the value of the land, or adversely impact their health. The powerline was reviewed in 33 meetings in North Dakota and 48 meetings in Minnesota and in two years of hearings; at the time, no other powerline in Minnesota state history had gone through such a drawn-out review process. Multiple candidates for state office included the powerline issue as part of their platforms. Farmers employed tractors, manure spreaders, and ammonia sprayers and used direct action and civil disobedience in an attempt to prevent construction of the line. Powerline protests drew national attention when over 200 state troopers, nearly half the Minnesota Highway Patrol, were deployed to ensure that construction of the line would continue. During a two-year period, a group of opponents to the line who called themselves \\"bolt weevils\\" tore down 14 powerline towers and shot out nearly 10,000 electrical insulators. Background The growth of electrical co-ops The CU Powerline Project was initiated by Cooperative Power Association (CPA) of Edina, Minnesota and United Power Association (UPA) of Elk River, Minnesota. CPA and UPA were Minnesota electrical generation and transmission associations of a combined total of 34 retail electrical co-ops. Retail electrical co-ops developed following the establishment of the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) in 1935 and the Rural Electrification Act in 1936. The REA began to distribute loans to groups involved in increasing access to electricity in the rural United States. Retail electrical co-ops formed in order to be eligible for the REA's distribution loans. Co-ops often combined in federations to purchase power from private utilities or federal agencies. Occasionally these co-op associations built their own generating stations. Motivation behind the CU Project Several factors led UPA and CPA to undertake the CU Project. UPA and CPA traditionally purchased most of their power from the Bureau of Reclamation's Garrison Dam on the Missouri River in North Dakota. UPA and CPA wanted to curtail their purchase of power to avoid the long term contract commitments. They desired to increase their \\"control over their energy supplies and costs\\". UPA and CPA predicted that they would not be able to meet the demand of retail co-op members for their electricity. As a result of the oil crisis of the 1970s, oil prices more than doubled from 1973 to 1978. UPA and CPA believed that consumers would switch to electricity as a source of power to avoid high oil prices. Demand for the electricity provided by UPA and CPA was already growing and UPA and CPA predicted that this growth would continue at the same rate. A 1972 study of the CU Project's feasibility predicted that UPA and CPA would face a \\"projected power generation deficit of 665 megawatts by 1978\\". As well, UPA and CPA needed the CU Project to meet their agreements with the Mid-continent Area Power Pool (MAPP), an association of twenty-eight utilities serving seven states in the Midwest. In order to join MAPP, UPA and CPA had to sign an agreement that obligated them to \\"power pool\\" or maintain a 15% surplus of power for sale to the other members of MAPP. The CU Project and the REA In 1972, UPA and CPA approached REA about the possibility of building a new generating station. The REA favored a lignite coal generator in North Dakota over a Minnesota plant using Montana coal shipped by train. The REA had financed other lignite coal generators in North Dakota, three of which were among the ten most economical plants in the country in the early 1970s. The REA agreed to finance the construction through low-interest loans. At the time of construction, the CU project was the largest and most expensive single project in the history of the REA. When the project was announced, there was only one other comparable high voltage powerline in the United States: the Bonneville Power Administration's Pacific Intertie that runs from Oregon to Los Angeles. The CU Project Components The CU Project consists of three parts: the Falkirk Mine, the Coal Creek Generating Station, and the CU Powerline. A subsidiary of North American Coal Corporation runs the Falkirk Mine, a lignite coal strip mine in North Dakota that covers over twenty-five square miles and uses two of the biggest dragline excavators ever assembled. The lignite uncovered by the draglines travels by conveyor belt to Coal Creek Station, the largest lignite- fired plant in North Dakota. The Coal Creek Station produces AC current which is converted into DC current at a conversion station. This DC current is transmitted from Coal Creek Station in North Dakota to a station near Buffalo, Minnesota where it is converted back into AC current. The powerline crosses 9 western and central Minnesota counties and includes a total of 659 towers placed at one-quarter mile intervals on the property of 476 landowners: primarily corn, wheat, soybean, and sugar beet farms. Arguments against the CU Project The first opponents to the CU Project were farmers who found out that the powerline would be built on their land. Farmers were upset with the way that the powerline route was initially conceived. In 1973 UPA and CPA hired a consulting firm which used a numbering system to assess the value of the land between North Dakota and Minnesota. They assigned high numbers (more value) to airports, highways, and wildlife areas but zero to agricultural land. The line would cross diagonally across farms, which farmers believed would disrupt irrigation and aerial spraying and seeding, limit future land use, and reduce the value of the land. Farmers believed that their way of life was being disrupted to \\"supply mainly urban population centers\\" with power. UPA and CPA customers did not like the fact that their electricity bills would be increased in order to pay off the loans the REA and other creditors had granted UPA and CPA to finance the project. Opponents believed that CPA and UPA \\"demand forecasts might be self-serving\\" and that alternatives to building the line such as conservation were not seriously considered. Farmers worried that the effects of direct electric current on livestock and humans had not been adequately explored. Notable protest activities Following the EQC decision to issue a construction permit to CPA and UPA and several years of legal battles and public hearings, farmers were \\"no longer in a mood to work within the system\\". On June 8, 1976 a farmer smashed a surveying tripod with his tractor and rammed a pickup truck belonging to the survey crew. This was the first act of illegal protest against the powerline. Following the events of June 8, farmers notified each other by CB radio regarding surveying activities and turned out in groups to block the surveyors' work. As the protests grew in momentum, local radio stations carried news of when and where protesters would gather. The Lowry town hall became the headquarters where protesters, some having traveled from surrounding counties, would gather every morning to make plans. The survey crews began to be accompanied by law enforcement. Farmers used a variety of tactics to thwart surveying on their property. They raised signs on poles to block the view of the surveyors. When a protester was hauled away for blocking the surveyor's line of sight, another protester would take the original protester's place.Farmers ran chainsaws to make it difficult for surveyors to hear and communicate. On one instance, farmers were granted permission by their town board to repair a road leading to a survey site. When survey crews arrived, farmers had put up roadblocks and were in the process of digging a hole in the road. Farmers used their tractors to pile boulders around the tower base holes preventing concrete from being poured. One farmer parked his truck with the key broken off in the ignition to block cement mixers. Another farmer \\"drove upwind of a utility crew then switched on his manure spreader\\". Survey stakes would vanish overnight. Mobilization of state troopers On January 4, 1978, a hundred farmers chased powerline crews from three different sites and \\"scuffled\\" with state troopers. Protesters dismantled parts of a tower in full view of the troopers. The following Friday, Governor Perpich ordered what was, at the time, the largest mobilization of state troopers in Minnesota history. National and international news reporters began arriving in Lowry to cover the protest. On January 9, 200 protesters marched across a survey site to hand each trooper a plastic carnation. Protesters also offered troopers coffee and cookies. The protest numbers continued to grow throughout January 1978. Thousands of farmers rallied in Saint Paul, Minnesota. In one community, school was let out so teachers and students could join the rally. The \\"Battle of Stearns County\\" On February 15, 1978, farmers sprayed troopers with anhydrous ammonia, a fertilizer that can cause serious chemical burns. Media reaction to this act was negative and protesters became divided over tactics. Protesters began making greater use of nonviolent resistance. Protesters covered themselves in pig manure and asked the police to arrest them. \\"March for Justice\\" On March 5, 1978 over eight thousand people marched from Lowry to Glenwood in below freezing temperatures to protest the CU Project. Marchers followed a tractor draped with an American flag that carried a coffin labeled \\"Justice\\" and a figure labeled \\"Corporate Giant\\". \\"Bolt Weevils\\" Beginning in August 1978, a group that called themselves the \\"Bolt Weevils\\" began to sabotage power line towers and shoot out electrical insulators. The General Assembly to Stop the Powerline (GASP) put out a regular newsletter called Hold That Line. Referring to the actions of the Bolt Weevils, one issue stated, \\"It is a mistake to label these as acts of vandalism. Vandalism means 'ignorant destruction of property,' and it would be a big misunderstanding to think that these acts are creatures of ignorance.\\" The electrical co-ops hired outside security officers that used helicopters and vehicles to patrol the line. UPA and CPA launched a public relations campaign to communicate to customers that vandalism would lead to electric bill increases. On August 1, 1979 the CU powerline went into commercial operation. On September 9, 1980, the REA took ownership of the line, in part so that attacks on the line would become federal offenses. In the end, Bolt Weevils toppled 20 power line towers and shot out nearly 10,000 electrical insulators. Consequences In the end, protesters were unsuccessful in blocking construction of the powerline. The fight had the unintended consequence of higher payments to farmers whose land was taken for the powerline. From 1976 to 1978, 120 people were arrested in connection with the protest. 4 people were convicted of criminal counts and 1 was convicted of felony charges. Soon after the powerline entered commercial operation, UPA and CPA saw a dropoff in demand for electricity. UPA and CPA ended up selling this surplus electricity to other utilities. Eventually, consumer demand increased. Since 1980, consumer demand for electricity in Minnesota has doubled. In the late 2000s, Xcel Energy, Inc. and 10 other utility companies announced plans to build a new high-voltage transmission line. A report detailing health concerns about the CU powerline was cited by a judge as a reason to block powerline construction in Texas. In the mid-2000s, a new group calling itself the \\"Bolt Weevils\\" emerged in Minnesota. The group vandalized Novartis/Northrup-King's Seed research facility and trampled 50 rows of research corn adjacent to Pioneer Hi-Bred's seed research facility.

As a festival that it only accepts work by artists residing in the Greater Toronto Area, it is a forum to spotlight the work of local emerging artists. Toronto is a city with many film festivals that highlights commercial and international work. The idea behind Toronto Youth Shorts is to highlight the locality of not only the people involved but also the content of the films. It is the only festival that restricts submissions to those residing in the Greater Toronto Area. Films screened include those made by current students and graduates of notable fine arts programs from Ryerson University, OCAD, Humber College and York University. All films are under 20 minutes in length. The festival events include screenings of work and occasionally a panel of industry guests to speak in relevant topics of the local film industry. At the end of the festival, there is an awards gala to celebrate the work of the filmmakers screened where a jury made up of industry professionals select their top picks screened at the festival and bestow upon them various awards and accolades. Now Magazine calls it \\"a festival with an intriguing mandate and a sense of genuine discovery.\\"Toronto Youth Shorts Film Festival puts our city in the spotlight History The Toronto Youth Shorts Film Festival was founded in 2009 by Henry Wong, a graduate of the University of Toronto Scarborough where he coordinated screenings of student films.UTSC Gears up for Film Festival This festival started off as his final project for the Event Management postgraduate program at Centennial College and eventually evolved into a forum that showcases cinematic work by local young filmmakers and video artists. Positive feedback from festival goers and industry partners led to the making of a second festival with expanded program initiatives. Films are screened at Innis Town Hall. The festival screens a wide range of films, with themes and topics that reflect the diversity of Toronto such as cultural clashes, LGTBQ issues, pressures of urban living, influence from media, and issues on immigration and the cultural diaspora all from a youth perspective. They also showcase dramatic short films, documentaries and experimental works. Some previous works include adaptions of high-profile literary works such as The Highwayman and An Encounter. T24 Project One of the festival's unique initiatives is the T24 Project, a 24-hour film challenge. Unlike other challenges similar in nature where teams are given props, locations and random lines of dialogue, the filmmakers of the T24 Project are given an essay-like question about the Toronto experience and participants are tasked in creating a 7- to 10-minute short thesis film in a 24-hour time frame. In 2012, the festival ran the 4th edition of the T24 Project, tasking teams of filmmakers to create films based on the idea of how cinematic narratives, genres and forms can expose the myths and ideologies of an evolving cityscape such as Toronto. Fifteen teams registered, with twelve having completed a film and seven in competition for the festival's Visual Thesis Award. Jury Every year, a jury made up of those in the film industry, such as programmers, award-winning filmmakers and film critics, determine the annual award and accolades for the festival.

The feminine form is Gnaea. The praenomen was used by both patrician and plebeian families, and gave rise to the patronymic gens Naevia. The name was regularly abbreviated Cn., based on the archaic spelling, Cnaeus, dating from the period before the letters \\"C\\" and \\"G\\" were differentiated.William Smith, A Dictionary of Greek and Roman AntiquitiesDe Praenominibus (epitome by Julius Paris)Mika Kajava, Roman Female Praenomina: Studies in the Nomenclature of Roman Women (1994) For most of Roman history, Gnaeus was one of the ten most common praenomina, being less common than Titus, the sixth most common praenomen, and comparable in frequency to Aulus, Spurius, and Sextus. Although the name was used by a minority of families at Rome, it was favored by a number of prominent gentes, including the Cornelii, Domitii, Manlii, and Servilii. The name gradually became less common in imperial times.Dictionary of Greek & Roman Biography & MythologyRealencyclopädie der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft Origin and meaning According to Festus, the praenomen Gnaeus originally referred to a birthmark, which was naevus in Latin. This etymology is generally accepted by modern scholars. In his treatise on the origin of Roman praenomina, Chase cites the archaic spelling Gnaivos in support of this explanation. However, as with other praenomina, Gnaeus was generally chosen because it was a family name, not necessarily because the children who received it had a noteworthy birthmark.Sextus Pompeius Festus, epitome by Paulus DiaconusGeorge Davis Chase, \\"The Origin of Roman Praenomina\\", in Harvard Studies in Classical Philology, vol.

It was Amtrak's first international train service, operating from 1972 until 1981.  History  The departure board at King Street Station (Seattle) in 1981, listing the Pacific International Amtrak did not retain any cross-border services when it assumed control of most intercity passenger trains in the United States on May 1, 1971. As part of its 1972 appropriation for Amtrak the United States Congress directed that $2 million be used for the establishment of service to Vancouver, Montreal (the Montrealer), and Nuevo Laredo (the Inter-American). The Burlington Northern Railroad's International had served the Seattle–Vancouver route up until the creation of Amtrak, and resuming service posed no significant challenges. The first Pacific International, Amtrak's first international train, ran on July 17, 1972. The train was scheduled to connect with the Los Angeles–Seattle Coast Starlight in both directions. Between October 1979 and April 1980 the southbound Pacific International began departing from Vancouver in the middle of the day and terminated in Portland, Oregon. On paper, the Pacific International should have been a success. Rail service had operated between Seattle and Vancouver for most of the 20th century. However, the train struggled to attract riders throughout its history. In 1975 the United States Department of Transportation said it was the worst performer in the system, with a deficit of 47 cents per passenger mile. Critics of the train noted the influence of Senator Warren Magnuson (D-Washington) in establishing the service. In early 1979, Secretary of Transportation Brock Adams proposed eliminating 43% of Amtrak's route network, and the Pacific International was on the chopping block. In the end Congress agreed to fewer, though still significant, cuts, and the Pacific International survived for another two years. Amtrak discontinued the Pacific International on September 30, 1981, as part of another restructuring. After its discontinuance Vancouver service did not return until the inauguration of the Mount Baker International in 1995. This route was folded into the Amtrak Cascades brand in 1998, and still exists today with two daily round trips, one from Seattle to Vancouver and one from Portland to Vancouver.

SWADS was formally created in 2009 with 150 commandos and 200 divers recruited. US Ambassador to Bangladesh Dan Mozena provided assistance in the creation of the unit. The unit's lineage is traced back to the Nou Commando frogmen of Sector 10 during the country's Liberation War against Pakistan.http://dhaka.usembassy.gov/uploads/images/hSceCcaxqZek1JcQr1LWmQ/12_nov_09_Closing_Tiger- Shark.pdf SWADS operators have participated alongside American Navy SEALs in Joint Combined Training Exchange programs under the Tiger Shark exercises. Selection SWADS operatives are volunteers from the Navy and are trained in Bangladesh and abroad. They do the Naval Commando Basic Course (similar to BUD/S of US Navy SEALs) from SWADS Training area at Rangamti and complete their airborne qualification course from army's School of Infantry and Tactics, Sylhet. Further specialist courses are held in various naval and army training bases in Bangladesh as well as in abroad. The average drop rate of NCB is 95%, and this is only the first step of becoming a SWADS operator.

Native vegetation in the hills is predominantly chaparral and coastal sage scrub, and riparian woodland is found along the course of the Ventura River. Terrain on the hills is steep, and the roads to well pads, tanks, and other infrastructure make numerous switchbacks. Most of the field is hidden from view from the city because of the first steep range of hills.

Climate in the area is Mediterranean, with cool, rainy winters and mild, dry summers, cooled by morning coastal clouds. Elevations on the field range from about above sea level along the Ventura River to around on the highest ridges both east and west of the river. Runoff from the oil field is into the Ventura River, although some of the eastern portions of the field drain south into the Santa Clara River.Eco-subregion description Geology Detail of the Ventura field, showing the city of Ventura In the Ventura field, the large-scale structural feature responsible for petroleum accumulation is the Ventura Anticline, an east-west trending geologic structure long, visible in the numerous rock outcrops in the rugged topography of the area.Oldenburg, Curtis M.(2008).

Abstract available here Within this feature, the primary petroleum-bearing unit is the Pico Formation, a sedimentary unit of turbidite sands of high porosity (16 to 20 percent)DOGGR, p. 573-574). Additionally, oil is found in the underlying Santa Margarita Formation.Keller, p. 5 Eight different oil-bearing zones have been identified by number, 1st through 8th based on depth, with the 2nd zone the first to be discovered, in March 1919 by the Shell Oil Company. The pools range in depth from to over , although depth within each pool varies greatly; the discovery well into the 2nd zone, which has an average depth of , had a total depth of only . The underlying Monterey Formation is presumed to be the source of the oil accumulations in the Ventura field, as well as the other two fields in the same geologic trend. The Monterey Formation is rich in organic matter, averaging 3-5 percent but reaching 23 percent in some areas. Oil likely migrated upwards during the late Pliocene, becoming trapped in the folds and structural traps of the higher rocks of the anticline which form an impermeable caps. Some of the oil-bearing zones, such as the 4th and 5th, are capped by the Barnard Fault, which provides an additional structural trap.DOGGR, p. 572 Even with the impermeable caps and structural traps, there are enough breaks in the structure for significant natural tar seeps to occur; indeed the entire region is riddled with natural seeps, and tar was used by the native Chumash peoples as a sealant for their watercraft.Gamble, Lynn H.

Oil gravity and sulfur content is similar in all pools in the field, with an API gravity of 29-30 and approximately 1 percent sulfur by weight. History, production and operations Former oil storage and processing facility along Route 33, across from a residential area The area was worked initially in 1885, followed by Ventura County Power Company drilling 7 shallow gas wells in 1903. While they reached depths of between 400 and , it is not known if they produced oil.DOGGR, p. 573 In May 1916 the first commercially viable well, No. \\"Lloyd\\" 1, was drilled by State Consolidated Oil Company to a depth of 2,555 feet. Initial production consisted of 100 barrels a day. Shell Oil drilled the first well into what is now known as the 2nd Pool, in the Pico Formation, in March 1919, reaching a depth of . A major real estate boom in Ventura resulted with the development of the oil fields in the 1920s. The affordability of automobiles and the building of better roads to Los Angeles and the opening of the Rincon Sea Level Road to Santa Barbara in 1913 also contributed to the rapid growth of the city. While the field was productive from the earliest years, it had a reputation for difficulty, and challenged the technological skill of the early 20th-century drillers. The Lloyd No. 102 well, operated by the Associated Oil Company, was the deepest production well in the world in 1928, producing from a depth of .Hertel, 1928 Later wells reached even greater depths, as drillers attempted to find the bottom of this extraordinarily productive but challenging field. Shell Oil Company's Taylor 653 reached a depth of , penetrating into the Miocene age Monterey Formation, but found no oil at those depths. Deeper reservoir oil was extremely hot; the temperature of oil in the 4th zone, discovered in 1925, and determined later to have an average depth of , was approximately . Production at the field peaked in the 1950s, at which time the field became the 12th most productive in the United States. In 1954 alone the field produced over 31 million barrels of oil. As production began to decline after 1954, technologies for enhanced recovery became available. Waterflooding – the reinjection of produced water to increase reservoir pressure, allowing wells with diminishing returns to flow more freely – commenced in most zones in the late 1950s and 1960s, and continues in the present. Active workover rig, Ventura Oil Field Aera Energy LLC, a joint venture of ExxonMobil and Shell Oil Co., eventually acquired the entire field, by consolidation of their predecessor company's operations and acquisition of the few remaining independent operators in the area. Their neighbor on the abutting San Miguelito and Rincon fields to the west is Vintage Petroleum, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. In 2009 Aera was still producing an average of 11,600 barrels of oil a day from the field, making the company the largest oil and gas producer in Ventura County.Aera Energy, Ventura operations description Aera reported the production of 14,000 barrels of crude oil and 7.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day in 2016 from 414 wells in an area of .

Biography  In 1994, Olson and Ray Southwell founded the Michigan Militia, an organized Bill of Rights group established in response to perceived threats on the rights of citizens by the federal government, specifically what they perceived was then-President Bill Clinton's desire to pass strict gun control laws. Olson owned a wooded property in Northern Michigan which served as the militia's training base, where members learned paramilitary skills. Olson drew the attention of the U.S. government to himself and the Michigan Militia when he reported that Oklahoma City bombing accomplice Terry Nichols had attended one of his meetings. He also claimed that the bombing was carried out by the government of Japan in retaliation for a sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway, which Olson claimed was perpetrated by the United States. The conspiracy theory was deemed so extreme by fellow militiamen that he was expelled from the Michigan Militia after losing four elections for commander. Also in 1995, Olson testified about the militia movement to the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Homeland Security. In 2000, Olson ordered militias across the United States to defend the Indianapolis Baptist Temple, whose property was to be seized after multiple failures to pay taxes.

An educator, pacifist, and Christian activist, she vigorously advanced the cause for the education of women in Japan. Her name was usually seen as Kaji Yajima in the American press of her day. Yajima worked with Toyoju Sasaki, the secretary of Japan's WCTU. Together they attempted to advocate the reform of feudalistic customs which subjugated Japan to the West and women to men. Yajima in particular advocated for temperance due to her brief marriage to an alcoholic. Both worked towards the elimination of prostitution, as well as the elimination of geisha culture and concubinage. Late in life, Yajima attended international meetings on peace and temperance, and met with American suffragists.  Early life  Yajima was born in 1833, in Kumamoto, Japan and was the sixth child and fifth daughter of an influential farmer's family. As a girl instead of a boy her parents had little interest in her. Elizabeth Dorn Lublin wrote \\"the ideology of danson johi (respect men and despise women) that informed this reception remained the dominant shaping force in Yajima's early years\\". She had a traditional female education and it was not until she was twenty-five that she married a samurai named Hayashi Shichiro. Hayashi enjoyed sake and would become abusive when drunk. Yajima later left her husband and returned to her family, refusing to return and cutting her hair. Eventually she moved to Tokyo to take care of her brother. Since teaching was one of the few paying jobs available to women of her time, she became a teacher for the newly established public school system in Tokyo following her divorce. She later transferred to the Presbyterian mission school because it provided her with twice the income as her position with the Tokyo school system. It was during this time that she was drawn to Christianity and would eventually begin working with a Presbyterian missionary by the name of Maria True.\\"A Little Great Woman: Madam Yajima of Japan\\" Continent (November 17, 1921): 1327.

Women’s Christian Temperance Movement In June 1886, the missionary Mary Clement Leavitt came to Japan. Her lectures were standing-room-only and influenced Yajima to start a union. In late 1886, Yajima helped create the Tokyo Woman's Christian Temperance Movement (WCTU) along with twenty-eight other women and was appointed president along with Sasaki Toyoju as secretary.World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Convention Minutes (Women's Temperance Publishing Association 1893): 154–156. The abuse at the hands of her husband and witnessing struggles of students with alcoholic fathers instilled in Yajima a strong dislike of alcohol and an interest in temperance. She pushed for the word temperance (kinshu) should be in the name of the Tokyo WCTU as a result of her past. The different histories of the secretary and Yajima was a source of conflict between the two. Yajima was more traditional in her views and believed that temperance was the most important problem the WCTU needed to address. She maintained that the members should \\"assist their husbands in the home [and] help gentlemen in society\\". Sasaki, on the other hand, thought that prostitution should be the focus of the union, causing the two to fight for control instead of work together. Yajima maintained the presidency until an accident forced her to resign in 1889. Three years later she was able to be reelected and stepped back into her role until 1903 she was forced to leave position yet again, this time because she did not receive enough votes from union members. This only lasted a matter of months as the woman who replaced her died and Yajima took her place. It was not until 1921 that Yajima left the presidency permanently. She edited the Japanese temperance newspaper, lectured, led protest marches, raised funds and represented Japan at international conferences.\\"Anti-Alcohol Movement in the United States Watched Closely in Japan\\" The Union Signal (March 20, 1919): 5.\\"Madame Kaji Yajima; A Great Japanese Educator and Peace Worker\\" Journal of Education (January 26, 1922): 96.

Most of the choristers are students currently at the university while the others are alumni. The choir's repertoire of sacred, secular and folk music is mainly a cappella. The choir is camerata-sized: 40 to 60 choristers. The club is under the office of the Dean of Students of Strathmore University, headed by Mr. Paul Ochieng.  History  Established on 11 January 1997, the Music Club was composed of both university staff and students. The Music Club was later to be split in two, forming Kilele Choir and Safari Band.  Highlights and achievements  In 1999, the university choir made its first international tour in Mwanza, Tanzania where it performed and also participated in the annual regional choir. At this time the choir was under the leadership and guidance of Mr. Silverse Anami, who was the choir director. Currently Mr. Anami is the director of culture and heritage in the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage in Kenya. In 2002, still under Mr. Anami, the choir made its second international tour as a guest choir at the canonization of St Josemaria Escriva in Rome, Italy. They performed in different venues, with the best performance being at the Santa Cecilia auditorium. The climax of the tour was a Harambee concert held in the Vatican. The choir has had a good relationship with the University of Pretoria's Tuks Camerata, who visited Kilele in June 2006. In April 2008 it was Kilele's turn to visit South Africa. The choir did a concert tour of South Africa where they performed at the University of Johannesburg and also at the centenary celebrations of the University of Pretoria. In April 2009, the choir visited South Africa for the second time, this time including the Cape region and Gauteng province. They shared the stage with their hosts, Tuks Camerata and Up Chorale as they sang the popular Kenyan melody Jambo Bwana, with the soloist being the choir's conductor, Mr. Albert Apela. The choir launched their premier album, e-polo, at the University of Pretoria. The choir made its debut at the Kenya National Music Festival in 2005. Key among its achievements are: *2nd position in mixed choirs' set piece in 2005 *2nd position in own composition in 2005 *2nd position in set piece secular category for mixed choirs in 2007 *1st position soprano solo in 2007 (Anne Nalo) *1st position bass solo in 2008 (Albert Apela) *2nd position soprano solo in 2008 (Julia Wanjiru) *1st position set piece secular category for mixed choirs in 2009 *1st position set piece western category for mixed choirs in 2009 *1st position alto solo in 200 (Peris Nyokabi) Membership New members are auditioned at the beginning of a new academic year to replace the choristers who left the previous academic year. Those who audition are allowed to sing a song of their choice. Voice tests are also undertaken. Conductors The first conductor of the choir was Mr. Adam Andera in mid-2006. Mr. Albert Apela later succeeded him. With Mr. Apela, Kilele has developed a repertoire of songs from Africa and the West. The choir also has an assistant conductor choir who deputizes the conductor while he/she is away and he/she is usually a chorister. Recording The choir has recorded one album already, e-polo, whose copies are being sold at the university and selected outlets in Nairobi.

The approximately tall structure, which resembles a giant candle, is assembled each year over the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument, a Civil War memorial located in the city's Centre Square. It is typically assembled in mid November and lighted over Thanksgiving weekend and disassembled in early February each year. The Peace Candle was first erected in 1951, and has been put up every year (except two) since then. Due to damage or disrepair, the Peace Candle has been replaced with new candle structures twice since the original construction. The first candle lasted until 1968, the second candle from 1969 to 1989, and the current candle was built in 1990.The structure is dedicated to the Easton area men and women who have served or are serving in the United States armed forces. It has been said to be the largest non-wax Christmas candle in the country. Although conceived with the hopes of restoring Easton's pre-20th century reputation for elaborate Christmas decorations, city officials also believed a candle would serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, the candle has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. Some have criticized the Peace Candle, calling it a symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas, and condemning the fact that it covers a war monument. Structure The Peace Candle is assembled over the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument in Easton's Centre Square. Above, the top half of the monument is still visible, with the bottom half of the candle assembled around it. The Peace Candle has undergone several changes and variations over the last 68 years. The current candle was built in 1990, and is expected to last until about 2014, after which time Easton officials expect to build a new one. As of 2009, the central main candle stands , and the base brings it to about . It reaches a height of about above ground level when factoring the monument it rests atop. When the candle is assembled, several by 8-foot by box pieces are placed around the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument, a Civil War memorial in Centre Square, the town square of Easton's Downtown neighborhood. Made from marine-grade plywood and galvanized steel, the box pieces are stacked vertically until the structure is assembled, and then bolted together using about 500 bolts inside the Peace Candle. The flame placed atop the candle is about high and illuminated with 31 bulbs. The entire structure weighs between eight and 10 tons. The main candle is surrounded by four, high side candles, and a fountain that surrounds the Peace Candle's base is filled with a ring of Christmas trees. The Peace Candle is believed to be the largest non-wax Christmas candle in the United States. Since it was first erected in 1951, Easton city officials have at various times declared it the largest candle in the world. In 1972, city council president Henry Schultz declared, \\"We claim, and no one has ever argued with us, that this is the largest candle in the world.\\" However, the Schlitz Christmas Candle, a non-wax candle-like structure in Schlitz, a small town in Hesse, Germany, is larger at tall. The current Peace Candle is taller than the Guinness World Record-holder for tallest candle, which belongs to an tall, wide candle exhibited at the General Art and Industrial Exhibition of Stockholm in 1897. However, only wax candles are eligible for the record, and there is no Guinness World Record for largest non-wax candle. When the third incarnation of the Peace Candle was built in 1990, Easton officials tried unsuccessful to seek a Guinness record for it. Creation Easton, the county seat of Northampton County in Pennsylvania, was considered one of the earliest cities to feature elaborate Christmas decoration displays on its city streets, with brightly colored lights and ornamental displays adorning its homes, businesses and residences long before they appeared in other American cities. Easton is also believed to be the home of America's first Christmas tree, as German immigrants who settled in Easton brought the symbol with them in 1816. By the mid-20th century, however, the predominance of Christmas decorations began to diminish in Easton, and support among city officials and residents began to wane as interest in the tradition dropped. Bethlehem, another Northampton County city, came better known for its elaborate Christmas decorations, although it has been suggested it followed the example first set by Easton. In 1951, Mrs. Hutton Hughes wrote a letter in the city's newspaper, The Easton Express, urging that a new holiday program of Christmas lighting be established in the city. On June 13, 1951, the Merchants Association of the Easton Chamber of Commerce responded to the letter by forming the Easton Area Christmas Committee, which set a goal of restoring the prestige of Easton's old Yuletide decorations. Several suggestions were made for a Christmas centerpiece in Centre Square, the town square of Easton's downtown neighborhood, to serve as the focal point of the Christmas program and promote downtown shopping. One of the suggestions was to pile evergreen trees around the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument, a Civil War memorial located in Centre Square, but it was deemed too expensive to pursue. Another suggestion was to attach a giant candy cane atop the monument, but it was dismissed as too secular. During one of the committee meetings, Easton resident Virginia Purdy suggested the idea of assembling a large candle in Centre Square, \\"because it would have no commercial aspect and it would serve to further good will in the community\\". The proposal was accepted. Above, an Easton public works employee stands next to two of the artificial flames that will be placed atop the smaller candle structures surrounding the larger Peace Candle. Below, the box pieces that form the sides of the candle are prepared to be taken away following disassembly. Easton Councilman Frank Bechtel was named chairman of the Easton Area Christmas Committee, and W. Nilan Jones was appointed chairman of the construction subcommittee. Jones, with the help of committee member and architect William Tydeman, studied the engineering angles involved in building a wooden candle structure that could be assembled over the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument. After determining such a project would be feasible, Jones drafted plans for a candle-shaped tower. The committee sought $4,000 for the Christmas display, and asked about 1,200 businesspeople were asked to make donations. Volunteers from the community, as well as members of the Local 239 United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, dedicated time, money and materials to the project, and Theodore Bean, proprietor of the local contractor company Bean, Inc., arranged for the use of his equipment and services to erect the candle. However, four days before it was scheduled to be built, Tydeman determined the structure design was too high to withstand the winds, and that there was a risk that it could topple along with the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument. Tydeman resigned from the project to protect his company from possibly liability, but helped the committee come up with a new, safer design. The committee considered piercing the plywood panels to allow wind to travel through, but Jones said \\"some of the wood could have splintered apart and taken someone's head off\\". Jones called A.P. Heller, the Reading-based company that built the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument, and sought advice from the son of the man who owned the firm when the work was done. The son suggested shortening the candle would allow it to withstand the wind, but also delivered a message from his father: \\"He wants to know why you want to cover up his work?\\" The candle proposal was completely redesigned and cut to . The planned structure was referred to as the Christmas Candle, which it was called every year until 1967. Construction began on December 8, 1951. Using a crane with a berm, as well as electrical equipment and other tools, 20 workmen placed the heavy plywood sheathing sections along all four sides of the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument. The structure was red with speckles of gold and silver, and green fir foliage around the base. It was assembled in four sections, which each ranged between and in weight. Once the tower was complete, it was topped off by an electric neon \\"flame\\". Since the Christmas Candle design was cut to , the top of the candle reached the base of a bugler statue at the top of the memorial. The flame consisted a cage-like frame of curved steel bars covered with yellow neon lights. The flame was placed over the bugler, and a yellow cotton sack was placed atop the statue to further create the image of a flame, and so the bugler would not be visible atop the candle. Plastic wax drippings were designed to extend downward from the top of the candle beneath the flame. Construction of the Christmas Candle progressed slower than expected because Bean Inc. contractors had trouble attaching the base sections. The work was not finished until December 9. The original Christmas Candle display cost $3,390.92, all of which was offset by donations from about 271 donors amounting to $4,055.35 in total. First candle (1951-1968) Inaugural decade On December 10, 1951, Easton Mayor Joseph Morrison flipped the switch to light up the Christmas Candle during its first dedication ceremony. Joining Morrison and Frank Bechtel in the dedication were a Catholic priest, a Jewish rabbi and a Protestant minister, to demonstrate the Christmas Candle was meant to serve as a symbol of peace for all religions and denominations. News reports indicate between 500 and 1,000 people attended the ceremony. In addition to the candle, the decorations included Christmas trees, smaller candle displays, large plywood wreaths and Christmas lights set up by students from the Easton High School and the city's Wolf and Schull junior high schools. It also included a plaque honoring the Easton area men and women on active duty in the United States armed forces. The Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission decorated the nearby Northampton Street bridge, which crossed the Delaware River, with its first Christmas light display in 14 years. A series of nightly Christmas choir concerts were held in front of the Christmas Candle starting December 18, and organ music was piped to the Centre Square from the city's First Presbyterian Church. Downtown business owners participated by decorating their windows with Christmas themes. Morrison called the Christmas Candle display \\"the most elaborate in Easton's history\\". The Christmas Candle was so large it drew the attention of airplanes passing over the city. On December 11, however, one of the neon lights in the flame structure short-circuited and started a fire on the yellow cotton sack placed over the bugler statue, causing an actual fire on the Christmas Candle flame for a brief amount of time. The blaze caused only minor damage to the Christmas Candle, but the bugler statue was exposed and visible inside the flame for the rest of the season. Despite this setback, the Christmas Candle was widely considered a success, and the Easton Area Christmas Committee signed a charter on December 17, 1951, tasking itself with organizing a yearly holiday program revolving around the Christmas Candle. The candle was assembled again every Christmas season until 1961, with ceremonies generally including holiday decorations, Christmas carols, refreshments, appearances by Santa Claus and other forms of entertainment. The Easton Area Christmas Committee was responsible for raising the funds and encouraging the civic interest necessary to keep the program active. In 1952, a new, fireproof flame as designed in response to the previous year's fire. The new flame design enclosed the steel tubing of the flame (which concealed the bugler statue), looked more realistic and better matched the flames on the four smaller candles at the Christmas Candle's base. The 1952 Christmas Candle display included further expansions from the previous year, including the addition of 20 new plywood light standard plaques by the Easton High School, as well as decorations on the Bushkill Street Bridge in addition to the Northampton Street bridge. With the hopes of increasing nationwide publicity for the Christmas Candle, the Easton City Council started dubbing the structure, \\"the world's largest Christmas candle\\". The Easton Area Christmas Committee continued raising the funds for the Christmas program up until 1957, when they needed to raise $3,500 from the public to make necessary repairs to the Christmas Candle for safety reasons. The next year, the committee started to receive a budget from the city, and were approved for $3,000 by the city council in 1958. The program continued to grow each year, and included 3,000 Evergreen trees assembled around the Centre Square by 1957, when more than 500 people attended the lighting ceremony in 20-degree weather. Removal and reconstruction In 1961, the Christmas Candle fell into a state of disrepair, and the contractors who assemble the candle for discounted prices in previous years informed the city they could not handle the project again. The Easton Area Christmas Committee also had trouble raising additional money needed for the repairs, For all these reasons, they decided not to assemble the candle again. The candle was placed into storage at an old incinerator plant on Pennsylvania Route 611, and the Easton Area Christmas Committee sought alternative decorations for its holiday program. In 1961, 24 streams of multi-colored Christmas light strands (totaling 2,650 bulbs) were draped from the top of the monument to the edges of Centre Square, creating an umbrella- like shape of lights. More than 200 Christmas Trees were also placed around the base of the monument, along with a nativity scene and Christmas light decorations on the nearby bridges. The set-up cost only $2,000, compared to the average $3,000 for the Christmas Candle display. This display was used for the next five years, and the decorations around the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument came to be known as \\"the umbrella of Christmas lights\\". In early 1965, Easton City Councilman Fred Ashton conducted a report announcing there had been \\"considerable criticism\\" of Easton's holiday decorations, prompting the Easton Area Christmas Committee to consider restoring the candle. But public contributions had continued to decline, and the project was so expensive the city deemed they could not afford it. The next year, however, Councilman Henry Schultz started an effort to restore the Christmas Candle. Schultz recruited a number of volunteers to make the necessary repairs, including Easton artist Joseph DeThomas, who repainted the structure. Councilman William Tomino also urged that repairs be made, claiming the candle was \\"known all around the world\\" and should remain part of Easton's holiday celebration. A new, flame was built using a new type of quartz, which used 6,000 watts to create a stronger light. The candle was erected and lighted at a ceremony on November 25, 1966, for the first time in six years. Easton Mayor George S. Smith flipped the switch, and the candle was once again dedicated to the local men and women of the armed forces. More than 400 people attended the ceremony, which this year also included 68 Christmas trees decorated with 1,500 lights. In the fall of 1967, it was decided the Christmas Candle would be renamed the Peace Candle, because the city planned to sell Christmas cards depicting the structure and hoped Easton would become known as \\"the Peace Candle city\\". On October 18, the city's businesses issued a statement, \\"Whether you choose to call it a Christmas Candle or a Peace Candle is not important. The important aspect is that the Candle is our clarion call, and this call will be issued this year as a reaffirmation of our desire for peace and harmony in all facts of our lives and throughout the world.\\" On November 27, 1967, about 1,500 people attended the Peace Candle lighting, which would prove to be the final ceremony of its kind for that incarnation of the candle, which would be rebuilt in subsequent years. The bells of six different downtown churches were rung during the ceremony, and people surrounded the Peace Candle holding lit wax candles themselves. Also in 1967, a photo and caption of the Peace Candle was featured in the December 6 issue Weekly Reader, a national children's newspaper circulated in the nation's schools. A columnist for the magazine named \\"Aunt Em\\" said it was featured because, \\"I think the candle in Easton is especially lovely since it is a symbol for both Hanukkah and Christmas\\". Appeared on December 6, 1967. Second candle (1969-1989) Fire damage and new construction On October 25, 1968, a fire at the former incinerator plant off Route 611, where the Peace Candle was being stored, destroyed the four smaller candles that surround the base of the larger candle. The fire was believed to have started by someone playing with matches inside the building. Firefighters battled the blaze for more than an hour. Damage was estimated at a cost of $1,200. Initially, city officials announced the fire would not delay the lighting ceremony planned for December 1. However, the Easton Area Christmas Committee had already been debating the construction of a new Peace Candle prior to the fire. On October 29, Henry Schultz, now chairman of the Christmas committee, announced the four smaller candles were damaged beyond repair and no effort would be made to rebuild them. Instead, the committee would build an entirely new candle within a year. The original plywood candle was replaced with a stronger candle made of fiberglass and galvanized steel, the covering of which was stretched on steel and wood frames. It was designed by the Allentown-based firm Rileigh's Inc. and constructed at a cost of about $12,500. The flame was built out of fiberglass strips with lights that changed color in sequence, to create a more realistic burning flame than the original candle. The new structure was , compared to the original . Each side of the new candle was about wide on each side. Due to the increase in size, it was no longer necessary to place the flame structure over the bugler statue on the top of the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument. Four new smaller candles were built and stood tall and were about wide on each side. Special lighting equipment was added to give the Peace Candle a natural effect that would make it realistically flicker throughout the night. At the base of the candles, 75 tall evergreen trees with gold ornaments were placed, strung with more than 2,000 Christmas tree lights. The first lighting ceremony for the new candle was held on November 28, 1969, and attended by about 450 people. Mayor Fred Ashton Jr. threw the switch, and Rev. Harry Maue of the Olivet Presbyterian Church urged that the symbol serve as a symbol of peace in America, nothing the growing casualties in the Vietnam War at the time. Schultz said the new candle was symbolic of the growing development in the Easton area. The new candle was stored in the city's garage on Bushkill Drive while not assembled. Second candle The new candle sustained some minor damage over its first few years. On November 20, 1970, heavy rain and inclement weather snapped a wire helping keep the structure in place, and firefighters had to install additional braces the next day. Also that year, about 75 lights were stolen from the decorative Christmas trees set up around the candle's base. In 1971, the building where the Peace Candle was stored was broken into and the fiberglass paneling was vandalized. Easton officials declined to discuss the extent of the damage, but Henry Schultz dismissed the vandals as \\"kids\\". In 1974, the Peace Candle was only lit a few hours a night, and not at all on some nights, due to an ongoing energy crisis, which prompted the Metropolitan Edison Company to ask its Easton area customers not to use Christmas lights that year. Since the Peace Candle was seldom lit, charitable donations dropped in 1974, resulting in an $800 defect for the Easton Area Christmas Committee. Additionally the committee spent $1,700 in Peace Candle Christmas cards meant to bring in donations, but only 500 packs were sold at $1 each. The use of less electricity to light the Peace Candle did not help the committee because the city paid the lighting bill. In November 1975, new concrete had been poured at Center Square as part of a beautification project, and the Peace Candle could not be assembled without damaging the work. As a result, the Easton Area Christmas Committee hastily organized a Christmas tree lighting on the Easton Redevelopment Authority parking lot, which was attended by only about 200 people, far below the usual candle lighting ceremony attendance. James Darvin, vice president of the Christmas committee, called it a \\"last-minute affair\\". In order to ensure the candle was erected in 1976, Nazareth contractor Stewart Beatty donated equipment and employees to help erect the structure, along with local carpenters, electricians and city workers. Downtown Easton businesses also donated $1,600 to help offset the $3,500 cost of refurbishing and putting up the candle. Although the Peace Candle was erected and lit in 1977, the formal lighting ceremony had to be canceled due to heavy rain and cold temperatures. Larry Holmes, the heavyweight boxing champion and Easton native, threw the switch himself during the lighting ceremony on November 24, 1978. Throughout the late-1970s and the 1980s, the Nazareth-based firm Beatty Contractors erected the candle each year. The firm originally did the project for free, but began charging $2,000 in 1981 when the cost of fuel started to rise. During the Peace Candle lighting ceremony on November 28, 1980, Easton Mayor Philip Mitman dedicated the candle to the 52 American hostages being held in Iran during the Iran hostage crisis. During a storm on December 6, 1983, 47 mile-per-hour winds caused the Peace Candle to start tilting in place. When city workers removed the flame next day, they realized the bugler statue atop the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument had moved on its base and would have toppled over had it not been leaning against the candle structure. One of the candle's anchor cables was also snapped by the wind and torn out of the brickwork. The cable was repaired and the bugler statue, which was previously held by its own weight, was reinforced with grouting. A sixteen-pound chunk of granite was also dislodged from the top of the statue, although in an area that most spectators cannot see from ground level. The candle suffered similar damage in 1988, when high winds loosened parts of the structure and snapped support wires. As a result, it had to be taken down early on January 5, 1989. In 1985, the Easton Area Christmas Committee was renamed to the Easton Holiday Committee. Third candle (1990-present) Construction of new structure The Peace Candle lit at night (2009) By 1989, the Peace Candle had become so dilapidated that it was hardly able to sustain the winter weather. Strong winds in November had shaken the structure so much that the wax dripping fixtures atop the candle had fallen off. On November 16, 1989, Mayor Sal Panto Jr. announced on WEST's Voice of the People show that the Peace Candle would not go up another year because the support structure was too weak and the Easton Area Christmas Committee was not receiving enough donations to pay for repairs. The committee was now receiving an average of $3,000 a year in donations, which was used to maintain the existing candle. Panto said, \\"The sad reality is, this is the last year.\\" However, new fundraising efforts were started to raise $20,000 to build a new Peace Candle. Local businesses and unions volunteered their time and materials to work on it, with the Lehigh Valley Carpenters Union working up to 100 hours a week for about five weeks to have the candle ready for the 1990 holiday season. The new candle was designed by the Allentown firm Alvin Butz Co., the Allentown firm Barry Isett & Associates, and Bethlehem Steel Corp. Supplies were provided by Dugan & Marcon Inc., Eisenhardt Mills, Ingersoll-Rand Co. and Dectis Painting, and the construction done by the Carpenters Union Local 600, Electricians Union Local 367 and the Northampton County Labor Council. It looked almost exactly the same as the old previous candle, with eight flood lights installed to illuminate the white shaft. The candle cost $35,000 to build, but Panto said without the help from volunteers, it would have cost around $150,000, not including labor. In order to cover the $15,000 shortfall in funds raised, the city sold Christmas cards, posters, ornaments and $10 Peace Candle ownership shares. The first lighting ceremony for the new candle was held November 23, 1990. Third candle On January 12, 1999, the spotlights surrounding the Peace Candle were accidentally turned on, and the heat from the lights ignited a fire among several of the Christmas trees surrounding the structure. Several residents called police and sprayed the flames with fire extinguishers until city firefighters arrived to put out the blaze. Although flames reached as high as 30 feet, only the trees were damaged and the Peace Candle itself was undamaged. The incident spurred discussion about removing the trees altogether, but Easton officials insisted the fire was just a fluke accident. New spotlights were installed in 2000, which lit the candle from top to bottom and focused on the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument for the rest of the year. By 2000, the city's Christmas decorations also included lighted snowflakes on the utility poles of Easton streets surrounding the Peace Candle. The 32 six-foot snowflake decorations cost just over $10,800, which were funded in part by a $6,000 Community Development Block Grant secured by the city. The Easton Holiday Committee said it was becoming increasing difficult to raise sufficient funds for the holiday display and sought $10,000 from the city council, but they were rejected. In response, six of the eleven Easton Holiday Committee members resigned in March 2001, prompting fear that the Peace Candle would not be erected during its 50th anniversary that following holiday season. However, the committee was filled with new volunteers who revamped efforts to raise funds through the sale of wax candles and greeting cards. The Peace Candle was lit during a ceremony on November 23, 2001, in dedication to the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks, as well as rescue workers from New York City, The Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania who responded the day of the attacks. In 2003, a six-foot slab of fiberglass from the imitation wax at the top of the candle was knocked loose by 50 mile-per- hour winds during a storm. Nobody was injured. James Pruznick, a filmmaker from Pohatcong Township, New Jersey, made a documentary film in 2004 focused on that year's assembly of the Peace Candle, as well as interviews with politicians, artists, merchants and construction workers about the history of the structure. It was first screened in December 2004 and made available subsequently on VHS and DVD. In October 2008, fear grew that the Peace Candle would no longer be erected when Easton employees who previously volunteer to climb the Peace Candle structure no longer wished to assemble it. Those fears were put to rest the next month, however, when the trade union Lehigh Valley Erectors Inc. volunteered to put the candle up. In 2007, Easton Mayor Phil Mitman dedicated that year's lighting to the troops fighting in Iraq and all of America's veterans. At about 7 p.m., the mayor introduced U.S. Navy veteran Kyle Stocker, whose son 4½-year-old Kayden hit the switch to turn on the spotlights illuminating the candle. In 2009, Superior Court Judge Jack Panella won a $770 bid on the auction website eBay to flip the switch and turn on the Peace Candle during the candle-lighting ceremony on November 27, 2009. In November 2010, Easton Holiday Committee Chairwoman Sandy O'Brien-Werner voiced doubts that the current candle structure would last until 2014 as previously projected and might need to be replaced sooner. She expressed concern at the cost of such a venture, claiming the Peace Candle cost $14,640 in 2010 alone for maintenance and operation and that an altogether new structure would cost at least $35,000. In response, six-year-old MaryElizabeth Soffera and eight- year-old Katie Dietrich, two cousins from Williams Township who loved the Peace Candle, opened a snow cone stand during a garage sale to raise money for the candle. They raised $23, which they presented to Mayor Sal Panto Jr. during a November city council meeting. Anti-war protests and vigils Due to its symbolism for peace and its placement over a Civil War monument, the Peace Candle has been the site of several anti-war protests over the decades. On December 16, 1972, a group of Vietnam War protesters gathered at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Easton and drafted a petition asking Easton City Council to keep the Peace Candle up all year long until the war was ended. Although the protesters acknowledged it was unlikely their request would be granted, they felt the petition itself was a symbolic gesture. Easton City Council President Henry Schultz commended the idea, but said it was not within the authority of the council and that it would be \\"physically impossible\\" to keep the candle up all year. At the time, liability insurance was only available up to February 1, and that keeping it up longer than necessary increased the possibility of an accident or damage from the weather. As part of the petition, the protesters asked city council to draft a resolution formally naming the structure the Peace Candle, claiming although it was commonly referred to by that name, a formal name had never been officially established. Schultz refuted that request, claiming the name had already been established five years earlier. In 1975, the activist citizens group Lehigh- Pocono Committee of Concern (LEPOCO) formed a \\"human peace candle\\" in front of the real structure as a protest against the Vietnam War. Three group members formed a triangle while another man stood on top of their shoulders, holding a lighted candle and a sign that read, \\"Bring the troops home for Christmas and the rest of the year\\". The protest marked the 10th anniversary of LEPOCO's first protest against the war when they formed in 1965, which was also held at Center Square. In December 1981, the Polish labor union Solidarity held a late-night peace rally that included a candlelight vigil, singing and prayers for a peaceful resolution to the martial law crisis in Poland. In 1991, the city decided to leave the Peace Candle standing until the Gulf War conflict was resolved in honor of the 500,000 American troops serving in the war. The gesture was approved after a pool of residents indicated a ratio of 10-to-1 supported it. During this time, supporters of the troops tied yellow ribbons around the candle and its surrounding fence, while protesters tied black ribbons to symbolize those who died in the conflict. The candle was taken down that March after the war ended. On November 14, 2015, the candle was lit nearly two weeks prior to the official ceremony date after local resident Joe Mercado posted to an Easton, Pennsylvania Facebook community page asking to light the candle to show support for the people of Paris, France after a terrorist attack the day before. Due to overwhelming response to the post, the city organized a candle light vigil that evening with several hundred residents attending. Prayers were offered in several languages, including French, and several faiths. Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr. and Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski spoke. The candle remained lit for three days before being shut off until the official lighting event. Merchandise and memorabilia In 1967, the Easton Area Christmas Committee began selling greeting cards depicting Easton's Peace Candle with the hopes of raising funds to maintain the city's holiday decorations. The committee created 15,000 cards that year, and the city's Downtown Improvement Group urged residents to buy the cards and mail them to friends and family across the country, with the hopes that Easton would become nationally known as the \\"Peace Candle City\\". The cards were sold in packs of three for $1 at city businesses and homes. They were designed in four colors from a painting by Easton artist Joseph DeThomas depicting the Centre Square and the Peace Candle. The 15,000 cards went on sale on Starting on October 18, 1967, Starting on October 18, 1967, and 12,000 were already sold by October 30. The rest by November 1, and another and another 15,000 due to what Councilman Henry Schultz called the \\"tremendous demand\\". In 1969, to advertise and celebrate the first lighting ceremony for the second candle, the Easton Area Christmas Committee sold placemats and napkin sets with an image of the Peace Candle in a night setting. Ten thousand sets were sold for $1 each at various stores and banks in the city. Both in 1967 and 1968, U.S. Rep. Fred B. Rooney lobbied the United States Post Office Department seeking for the Peace Candle to chosen for the official Christmas Stamp in the following year. However, it was rejected both years by the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee, which reviewed the proposals and narrowed the applications. In 1968, an image of the painting The Annunciation by Jan van Eyck was chosen rather than the Peace Candle. In October 1979, the Schaefferstown, Pennsylvania-based Michter's Distillery created whiskey decanters patterned after the Peace Candle. The idea was first posed by Mark Hammerstone of Palmer Township, a decanter collector who approached Schultz with the concept in 1978. Schultz brought the idea to the distillery, which chose to base their second annual Christmas decanter on the Peace Candle. They spent $3,500 to build a sculpture based on photos of the structure. The decanter, which holds is off-white with red and yellow flames atop the candles and bunches of Christmas greens around the base. Six thousand decanters were produced and originally sold for a $49.50 retail price. They were shipped to collectors as far as Texas, California and England. In 1990, the city released a china plate with the Peace Candle along with a Christmas tree, which was meant to symbolize the first tree in the nation, which was believed to have been erected in Easton in 1816. During the 2000 holiday season, the Easton Holiday Committee produced and sold commemorative plates marking the 50th anniversary of the Peace Candle, which included a painting of the structure by local artist Preston Hindmarch. They were sold for $32 along with ceramic ornaments of the Easton eatery Colonial Pizza, which sold for $22. Over the years, Christmas cards depicting the Peace Candle have continued to be used as a means of raising funds for the structure. Criticism Ever since the Peace Candle was first erected, some Easton residents have been critical of the structure, arguing it is a tacky symbol of the over-commercialization of Christmas and not a tasteful way to convey a message of peace. Many have condemned the fact that the Peace Candle covers the Soldiers' & Sailors' Monument, which proponents see as a sign of disrespect toward veterans. Critics have also argued the candle is too expensive to maintain each year, and some have claimed the phallic shape of the symbol is inappropriate. In 1982, a petition was signed by 90 people and submitted to the Easton City Council seeking to discontinue the Peace Candle tradition, calling it a \\"garish symbol of inner-city decadence\\". The group wanted to replace it with a decorative display of evergreen tree, in honor of Easton's claim to be the first city in the United States to observe that German custom. The city rejected the petition after conducting a survey of public opinion, which polled 29 city residents in favor of the Peace Candle and four against it.

Pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis is caused by the consumption of one or more of the 200 known plant species containing the toxic pyrrolizine alkaloids found all over the world today. Established as the most common source of this illness are plants such as ragwort (Senecio jacobaea), woolly groundsels (Senecio redellii, Senecio longilobus), rattleweed (Crotalaria retusa), and seeds of yellow tarweed (Amsinckia intermedia). There are 30 known pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are hepatotoxic, meaning they cause injury to the liver. Although animals innately know to give these toxic plants a wide berth while grazing, in extreme drought conditions animals have been known to ingest them as a source of minimal protein. Animals can also be poisoned if the toxic plant material is in pellets, or harvested with grain.Talcott P: Pyrrolizidine Alkaloid Poisoning. In: Robinson NE (ed): Current Therapy in Equine Medicine, 5th Edition. Philadelphia, W.B. Saunders Co., 2003, pp. 788-790 Frequency and exposure Humans Pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis poisoning in the United States has remained moderately rare among humans. The most common reports are the outcome of the misuse of medicinal home remedies, or the alkaloids are present in food and drink substances such as milk and honey when the animal carriers were exposed to the toxins. In other countries, mass human poisonings have occurred when cereal crops used were infected with seeds containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids.World Health Organization, Environmental Health Criteria 80.

Web. 20 October Infants and young children are most likely to acquire pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis because of their intrinsic nature to put everything they find into their mouths. However, anyone who consumes one of the mentioned toxic plants is susceptible to the disease. The typical case of pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis toxicity ends in liver damage that ranges from severe to moderate, as well as damage to other organs. The longevity of the disease is wide ranging from 2 weeks to 2 years subsequent to when the poison was ingested. The patient's recovery results may be as diverse as the permanence. Some have recovered as if they were never affected by pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis poisoning if the damage to the liver was not too severe, and others have died from it. The severity of pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis depends on how much of the poisonous plant was consumed in a height, age, and weight to the amount of substance ingested ratio. The only difference in the symptoms will be how prominent they are depending on the above ratio. Symptoms include:Plant poisoning - Pyrrolizidine alkaloids, wrongdiagnosis.com * Dull dragging ache in the right upper abdomen * Nausea * Vomiting * Diarrhea * Liver problems * Acute upper gastric pain * Prominent dilated veins on the abdominal wall * Fever * Jaundice * Pulmonary edema * Pleural effusions * Lung damage * Lesions all over the body * Hypertrophy of the right ventricle of the heart * Damage to the kidneys To stop the spread and severity of pyrrolizidine alkaloidosis the first step is to remove the poisonous plant from the source. Once the plant has been removed, the alkaloids can be extracted with chloroform. However, ethyl acetate is a handy and less toxic substitute. Depending on the severity of the toxicity and how long the person has been exposed to the disease, there may be no means of treatment and fatality may occur. Mechanism of Action After oral ingestion, pyrrolizidine alkaloids are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. When they reach the liver, they are metabolized via three pathways: N-oxidation, oxidation, and ester hydrolysis. N-oxidation and hydrolysis are detoxification pathways, and the products of these reactions are conjugated and excreted by the kidneys. However, the N-oxide may be converted back into the pyrrolizidine by cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) monooxygenases. Oxidation of the pyrrolizidine to its respective dehydropyrrolizidine is responsible for the toxic effects. In the toxic pathway, the 2-pyrroline in the core is desaturated via an oxidation reaction to form a pyrrolic ester. This metabolite can still subsequently be eliminated if it is conjugated to glutathione. However, this metabolite is toxic because it can act as an electrophile. It may be attacked by either DNA base pairs or by amino acid residues in liver proteins, resulting in the formation of toxic adducts, including cross-linked adducts between DNA base pairs, liver proteins, or both. These adducts can damage DNA, leading to genotoxicity and carcinogenesis, and liver enzymes and hepatocytes, leading to hepatotoxicity. Metabolism and mechanism of action of pyrrolizidine toxicity. Nuc=nucleophilic protein residue or DNA base Prevention The only known technique of prevention is to avoid ingesting the poisonous alkaloids. Some methods of control have been defoliation in areas in both Oregon and California. Also mass relocation efforts of moths, flea beetles and seed flies have been made in hopes that they will eat the toxic plants and help control the population of the plants. This manner of alkaloid control has been met with variable success. Because sheep and goats have such a high immunity to the toxicity of the alkaloids they are commonly used to graze on the plants to control them. However, this method has its risks unless sheep meant for early slaughter are used. Before hay cutting in the spring is the optimal time frame for annual herbicide applications which have also enhanced the destruction of the alkaloids.Cheeke, P.R.

It is recited after engaging in an act of excretion or urination, but is also included in many Jewish prayer books as a part of daily prayer prior to birkot hashachar. The purpose of this blessing is to thank God for good health. It expresses thanks for having the ability to excrete, for without it existence would be impossible. Though recited normally by observant Jews each time excretory functions are used, it is also recited during the Shacharit service due to its spiritual significance (to Jews, humans are made in God's image, so it is an expression of awe toward God's creations).  Source  The obligation to recite a blessing upon leaving the bathroom could be traced to the following passage in Berachot (60b): > One who enters a latrine should say [to the ministering angels who accompany > him], \\"Be honored, honored and holy ones who serve the Most High! Give glory > to the God of Israel; leave me while I enter and do my will [i.e., relieve > myself], then I will come to you.\\" Abaye objects to saying the above and suggests one should say something else prior to relieving oneself as well as reciting a blessing similar to Asher Yatzar upon exiting the latrine. > Abaye said: A person should not speak like this, for they might leave him > and go; rather, he should say, \\"Guard me, guard me, help me, help me, > support me, support me, wait for me, wait for me until I enter and come out, > for this is the way of human beings.\\" When he comes out, he says, > \\"Blessed... who has formed man with wisdom and created within him many > openings and hollow spaces. It is obvious and known before Your Seat of > Honor, that if even one of them would be opened, or one of them would be > sealed, it would be impossible [to survive and] to stand before You.\\" A dispute over what the conclusion (chasima) of the blessing should be is recorded: > How is it to be concluded? Rav said, \\"who heals the sick.\\" Shmuel said: Does > Abba [Rav] regard the whole world as sick? Rather, [the conclusion of the > benediction should be] \\"who heals all flesh.\\" Rav Sheshet said \\"who acts > wondrously.\\" Rav Papa said: Let us therefore say both: \\"who heals all flesh > and acts wondrously.\\" The halacha follows Rav Papa. Process After completing urination or defecation and upon leaving the bathroom, the person washes their hands. According to Jewish etiquette, this should be done outside the bathroom, but if there is no source of water available outside the bathroom, it is permissible to wash one's hands inside the bathroom, then dry them outside. No al netilat yadayim blessing is recited for the handwashing. Following the washing and drying of one's hands, the asher yatzar blessing is recited.

His life and career as an assassin are chronicled in Assassin's Creed II, II: Discovery, Brotherhood, and Revelations, as well as the animated short film Embers. All games (excluding 'II Discovery) and films he appears in were re-released as an enhanced bundle, The Ezio Collection in 2016. Furthermore, he appears as a guest character in the fighting game Soulcalibur V. Born into Italian nobility, Ezio follows his family heritage as an assassin after most of his immediate kin are killed during the Pazzi conspiracy. His quest to track down those responsible for killing his family eventually sets him up against the villainous Templar Order, led by the House of Borgia. Spending years to fight against Rodrigo and Cesare Borgia and their henchmen, he eventually reestablishes the Order of Assassins as the dominant force in Italy. His further adventures lead him to Spain and the Ottoman Empire, where he is also essential in overcoming Templar threats and restoring the Assassins. After his retirement from the Order, he lives a peaceful life in rural Tuscany before dying from a heart attack. The character has received significant critical acclaim. While most of it focuses on his portrayal and growth throughout the series, as well as the unique chronicling of his entire life, he has also been noted as one of the most attractive video game characters of all time. Due to his reception and the fact that he is the only character in the series who is the protagonist of multiple major installments of the franchise, he is usually considered the face of the franchise and its most popular character. Development When creating the character, the developers were keen on establishing similarities between the series' previous protagonist Altaïr Ibn- La'Ahad in style and general appearance, while at the same time differentiating Ezio from the former characterwise. His name, meaning eagle, was chosen to keep up the tradition of Altaïr, whose named also meant eagle. While Altaïr was described as a warrior monk bred for combat and the life of an assassin, Ezio's backstory was consciously designed in sharp contrast to make playing him feel like an \\"empowering experience\\". Unlike Altaïr, Ezio is not born into the order and discovers his heritage only in his teens, while his main goal for most of the first game is to seek revenge on those who murdered his family. Even though this was made to be his main motivation for the early part of the game, his personal growth was to enable him to seek justice as the game progressed. He does not start out as a master assassin but has to hone his craft throughout, making him more relatable to players. Ezio learns new moves and abilities by being taught by friends and allies, unlike a progression tree, to make the players immersion into the character feel more natural. In general, Ezio was designed to be a Renaissance man, who was to be open minded and seek truth, but also fun-loving. The creative director of Assassin's Creed III, Alex Hutchinson, compared Ezio to actor Errol Flynn, as he was designed to be an over-the-top womanizer and braggart. Fictional character biography Assassin's Creed II and II: Discovery Ezio is an ancestor of Desmond Miles, the protagonist of most of the early series' backstory, who experiences Ezio's life through the Animus, a device unlocking hidden memories inside his DNA. As it is shown in the beginning of Assassin's Creed II, Ezio was born into the nobility in the Italian city of Florence in 1459. Tutored by the banker Giovanni Tornabuoni until the age of 17, Ezio led an affluent, care-free lifestyle until his father Giovanni discovered a plot to assassinate the leader of Florence.Assassin's Creed II, Chapter 1 Giovanni accused Francesco de' Pazzi as a conspirator, but when he presented the evidence to the gonfaloniere of Florence, Uberto Alberti, the latter is revealed to also be conspirator and orders for the Auditore family's arrest, blaming them for the plot. Out running errands for his father, Ezio is not home when his father and two brothers are arrested and later publicly hanged. Ezio, following his father's final advice, finds his Assassin tools and flees the city with his mother and sister to his uncle Mario's estate in Monteriggioni.Assassin's Creed II, Chapters 2 and 3 Mario assists Ezio in discovering the people behind the conspiracy and trains him. While exacting revenge on the Pazzi family, Ezio discovers that more people from outside Florence are involved.Assassin's Creed II, Chapter 4 The search for those responsible leads Ezio from Florence to San Gimignano, Forlì, Venice, and eventually Rome. As he identifies and assassinates more and more political figures, Ezio also gains several allies, including Niccolò Machiavelli, Caterina Sforza, and Leonardo da Vinci. These allies partly train Ezio into an Assassin and guide him on his quest. Eventually, the conspiracy leads to the mastermind behind the plot: Rodrigo Borgia, Grand Master of the Italian Templars. He sought to find the Apple of Eden — a powerful ancient artifact known as a Piece of Eden —which lays in Florence. Ezio finds Borgia in possession of the Apple and learns that Borgia believes himself to be \\"the Prophet\\", who will lead the Templars to a fabled \\"Vault\\". Ezio is able to confront Borgia with the help of his allies and recover the Apple of Eden, but Borgia flees before he can be killed. Ezio's allies reveal they are all Assassins and believe Ezio to be the true Prophet, allowing him to join their ranks.Assassin's Creed II, Chapter 11 During the events of Assassin's Creed II: Discovery, which plays after Borgia's escape during Assassin's Creed II, Ezio travels to Spain in 1490 to free his fellow Assassins, who have been imprisoned under the guise of the Spanish Inquisition. In the process, he discovers that the Templars are planning to sail west to discover the New World. Ezio has to save Christopher Columbus and kill Tomás de Torquemada to end the Templar threat. Ezio must also assassinate some other important targets such as Gasper Martinez, Pedro Llorente, and Juan de Marillo. Along the way, Ezio saves many imprisoned Assassins who help him, including Luis de Santángel and Raphael Sanchez. In the end, Granada City is taken under siege by Templars, and Ezio has to save the Moorish King Muhammad XII. Years later, in 1492, Borgia becomes Pope Alexander VI and resides in Vatican City. By 1499, Ezio and his allies have completed the Codex, which is revealed to be a world map, and discover that \\"the Vault\\" lies in Rome and has to be opened with the Apple of Eden and the Papal cross, another Piece of Eden. While his allies distract the city's guards, Ezio infiltrates the Vatican using the Apple and attempts to assassinate Alexander. The Pope uses the Staff to incapacitate Ezio, escaping with both the Staff and the Apple. Ezio, now injured, finds Alexander in time to stop him and fights him in hand-to-hand combat, easily defeating the older man. He decides to let the Pope live, realizing that killing him will not bring back his family. Now in possession of both the Staff and the Apple, Ezio opens the Vault, where a holographic figure approaches him. Identifying herself as Minerva, she confirms that he is the Prophet. Belonging to an extinct precursor race that created humanity, she warns Desmond - who is reliving Ezio's memories - from a cataclysmic solar flare only he can prevent. As Minerva's projection fades, Ezio is left confused as he tries to ask who Desmond is.Assassin's Creed II, Chapter 15 Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood At the start of Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, Montereggioni is besieged by the Papal Armies led by Cesare Borgia, son of Pope Alexander and co-leader of the Templar Order. During the siege, the Apple is lost, Monteriggioni is destroyed, Caterina Sforza is kidnapped, and Ezio's uncle Mario is killed. Escaping the city with his mother and sister, an injured Ezio sets off for Rome to destroy the Borgia once and for all; however, he collapses shortly thereafter.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Chapter 1 Days later, Ezio awakens in Rome and receives a new set of gear from Niccolò Machiavelli, who also saved him days earlier. After his wounds heal, Ezio and Machiavelli set their plan into motion – to liberate Rome and remove the Borgias from power permanently, as well as retrieve the Apple of Eden. Slowly, over the next three and a half years, Ezio and his allies win a series of victories over the Borgias, reclaiming and restoring the city by destroying the Borgia's allies and resources. Ezio restores the ranks of the Assassins and in time succeeds Machiavelli as the Mentor, the leader of the order.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Chapter 7 By 1503, Ezio has assassinated the clan's banker, Juan Borgia, and their French general ally, the Baron de Valois, and incapacitated Lucrezia Borgia, leaving their power base in disarray. Cesare, in a fit of rage, kills his father and begins losing control over the city. After retrieving the Apple, Ezio uses its power to destroy what is left of Cesare's army and allies. By the end of 1503, Borgia control over the city is completely broken and Cesare is arrested by the new Pope, Julius II, escaping some time later. Ezio rejects the Apple of Eden and hides it below the Colosseum in the Temple of Juno. In 1507, Ezio travels to Spain and catches up with Cesare at the siege of Viana Castle. Ultimately defeated by Ezio, an indignant Cesare Borgia is thrown off the castle walls to his death.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood, Chapter 15 Assassin's Creed: Revelations After the events of Brotherhood, Ezio discovers a letter left behind by his father that talks about a hidden library full of vast knowledge underneath Masyaf Castle, left there by the legendary Assassin Altaïr Ibn- La'Ahad, setting the events of Assassin's Creed: Revelations into motion. Arriving at Masyaf in early 1511, Ezio is ambushed by Templars who occupy the fortress, also searching for Altaïr's library. After escaping capture and assassinating the Templar captain, Ezio recovers the journal of Niccolò Polo, which tells of five seals hidden in Constantinople that will open the door to Altaïr's library.Assassin's Creed Revelations, Chapter 1 Arriving in Constantinople, Ezio begins his search for the seals, while helping the local Assassin's Guild, led by Yusuf Tazim, to overthrow Byzantine Templar control. Over time, Ezio succeeds in eradicating Templar influence and resubjugating the city to the rule of the family of Prince Suleiman. Ezio recovers four of the five keys with the help of historian and book collector Sofia Sartor. He then travels to an underground city in Cappadocia, the Templar base of operations. After assassinating the Templar leader Manuel Palaiologos and recovering the final key, it is revealed that Prince Suleiman's uncle Prince Ahmet has been secretly leading the Byzantine Templars and wishes to open Altaïr's library for himself. After Ezio refuses to hand over the keys, Ahmet threatens to harm Sofia and sails off, leaving Ezio in Cappadocia. Upon returning to Constantinople, Ezio finds that Sofia has been kidnapped by Ahmet and Yusuf has been murdered to force Ezio to reveal the key's whereabouts. Leading an all-out attack with the Constantinople Assassins, Ezio ultimately saves Sofia. He then engages in a chase with Ahmet and eventually recovers the keys from the latter. A returning sultan Selim I kills Ahmet and thanks Ezio for saving his son and country, but at the same time orders him to leave the Ottoman Empire and never return. Ezio and Sofia make their way back to Masyaf and open the library, where Ezio finds Altaïr's corpse. The entire purpose of the library was to convey another message to Ezio's descendant, Desmond Miles, through another Apple of Eden. An aged Ezio decides that he has seen enough violence and mystery for one life, and leaves the Apple of Eden behind.Assassin's Creed Revelations, Chapter 15 Assassin's Creed: Embers In the animated short Assassin's Creed: Embers, the last years of Ezio's life are chronicled. After his retirement from the Order of Assassins, he has settled down in a Tuscan villa near Monteriggioni with Sofia, and had two children, Flavia and Marcello. In 1524, a mysterious Chinese woman appears at his door requesting his help. The woman, Shao Jun, is a member of the vanquished Chinese Assassin Order and sought Ezio's advice in how to help her people and rebuild their order. After helping Shao fight off soldiers sent by the Chinese Emperor Jiajing and training her, Ezio sees Shao on her way back to China, armed with the wisdom she came seeking him for. Shortly thereafter, while on a trip to the market square in Florence, Ezio dies from a heart attack at the age of 65.Assassin's Creed: Embers Other appearances Assassin's Creed series Ezio also appears as a supporting character in the short film Assassin's Creed: Lineage, where he is portrayed by Devon Bostick. While he himself does no longer appear in future instalments, he is referenced by Achilles Davenport as \\"having opened Pandora's box\\" in regards to the First Civilization in Assassin's Creed III.Assassin's Creed III, Chapter 3 Furthermore, he is considered unsuitable for video game installments by the fictional virtual reality department of Abstergo Industries in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag In Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China, Shao Jun applies his teaching in her quest to restore her order and considers him her mentor.Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China His outfit can also be unlocked in all subsequent releases of the series. In 2018, Ezio became a playable character in the free to play role-playing mobile game Assassin's Creed Rebellion. Like II: Discovery, the game is set during the Spanish Inquisition and features multiple characters from different installments of the series, as they build a brotherhood to overthrow the Spanish Templar Order. Furthermore, he is a playable character in the 2018 board game Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice by Triton Noir. Soulcalibur V Ezio also appears as a guest character in the 2012 fighting game Soulcalibur V. In the non-canonical storyline of the game, Ezio discovers a strange artifact in 1506, while on his way to Navarre to fight Cesare Borgia. On his voyage by sea, he dispatches a group of Templars plotting to overthrow Catherine of Aragon with said artifact. After touching what turns out to be a piece of the cursed blade Soul Edge, Ezio is transported 100 years into the future, where he fights against the characters of the series in an effort to collect all pieces of Soul Edge and its counterpart, Soul Calibur. Once he has collected all shards of the legendary swords, he is transported back to his own time and next seen back on his ship to Navarre.Soul Calibur V Other Ezio's robes are unlockable in the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands, Final Fantasy XIII-2 as well as in LittleBigPlanet for the PlayStation 3 and PowerUp Heroes for Kinect on the Xbox 360. His outfit, under the name the \\"Dashin' Hashashin\\", was presented as promotional headgear to Team Fortress 2 players who had pre-ordered Assassin's Creed: Revelations, along with a special knife modeled after his hidden blade (called \\"The Sharp Dresser\\") for the Spy class in the game. In both Final Fantasy XIII-2 and XV, Ezio's outfit was unlockable in special events. In a time-limited special event in Monster Hunter World, players were able to unlock Ezio's robes as a special armor. Ezio appears as a guest character in the 2014 and 2020 free to play role- playing mobile games Soul Hunters and AFK Arena, through a collaboration between developer Lilith Games and Ubisoft. Ezio later appeared as a boss in another one of Ubisoft's titles, For Honor. In the fighting game, players are encouraged to duel with and kill Ezio in a time-limited special event, active from December 2018 to January 2019. Reception and legacy The character was critically acclaimed by the media and general public alike, with his depiction and transformation, as well as the chronicling of his entire life drawing significant praise. He is the only character in the series to receive several main games. Ezio is widely regarded as the series' best character and the face of the franchise, often finishing first in rankings of the series' characters. With the exception of 'Discovery' (a Nintendo DS release), all games and films he appears in were re-released as an enhanced bundle, The Ezio Collection, for Playstation 4 and Xbox 1, in 2016. Initial reception for Ezio as a character was positive. Gamesradar characterized him as an \\"ass-kicking, morally ambiguous superhero\\" and noted that he had a livelier and more charming personality then his predecessor Altaïr, with his personal growth being a central aspect of the narrative. Will Tutle of GameSpy also noted Ezio's growth and contrast to Altaïr as his strongest features, stating that while he was an unlikeable womanizer at first, he was later hoping he would \\"get his revenge and uncover the truth\\". In contrast, Gamespot's Kevin VanOrd called Ezio \\"terrific\\" and \\"instantly likeable\\", while praising him as a more realized character then Altair. In his review of Revelations, VanOrd lauded the developers for reflecting Ezio's age and weariness throughout the game, as well as highlighting his role as a mentor. Matt Miller of GameInformer stated that by Revelations, Ezio has grown from a boy seeking revenge to a man seeking wisdom, as well as a \\"venerable mentor\\", which was made a central aspect of his character. John Davison of GamePro named Ezio the epicenter of the game and drew a comparison between him and Nathan Drake. Like Drake, the \\"charming, witty, and comically self-deprecating\\" Ezio was \\"designed to draw the player into the narrative.\\" Ezio Auditore received an award from GameSpot for the \\"Best New Character\\" in 2009. GameZone authors Natalie Romano and Angelina Sandoval listed him third for \\"Gaming God of 2009\\", which ranks the most attractive video game men of the year. He was also nominated at the Spike Video Game Awards 2010 for \\"Best Character\\". The 2011 Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition lists Ezio as the 35th most popular video game character. The praise for his portrayal has also placed him high in multiple all-decade or all-time rankings. Ezio was voted as the third top character of the 2000s decade by Game Informers readers. In 2012, GamesRadar+ ranked him as the eighth \\"most memorable, influential, and badass\\" protagonist in games due to his entire life being portrayed. They also placed him second on the list of most badass game characters of the generation, saying \\"Ezio has become synonymous with the image of the video game assassin.\\" GamesRadar placed him at number 4 in a list of the 50 best game characters of the generation. Complex listed Ezio among the \\"most badass\\" video game characters of all time in 2013, ranking him at 37th place. Complex ranked him as having the tenth best fighting game cameo for his guest appearance in Soulcalibur V in 2012. He also featured on UGO Networks's list of most memorable Italians in video games at 15th place. In 2014, he was included in Game Informer's dream roster for the next Super Smash Bros. entry. The characters' physical attractiveness and clothing style have also been noted. At the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, he won the award for \\"Best Dressed Assassin\\", while Paste named him as one of the \\"best costumed characters in videogames.\\" GamesRadar+ named Ezio \\"Mister 2009\\" in their article on the sexiest new characters of the decade of 2000. Furthermore, PlayStation Official Magazine ranked Ezio fifth on their list of \\"finest facial hair gaming has to offer\\". Mashable ranked him 9th in a list of \\"the 10 most datable men in video games\\".

The brother of painter Igor Grabar, and the husband of philologue and translator Maria Grabar-Passek. He is one of the leading specialists in international law of the pre-revolutionary and post-Revolutionary Soviet period. Grabar was held a number of leading posts during his impressive and broad career, including: professor of international law, academician, dean, legal advisor to the Imperial Russian government and the Soviet state, internationally recognized jurist and historian. His academic and professional career encompassed the last decades of the Russian empire and the first four decades of the Soviet period. His most notable work on the history of international law in Russia (1647-1917) guaranteed a visible place not only in the Russian legal academy but also abroad. Early life Grabar was born on 10/22 January 1865 in Vienna, Austria at a home located on Währinger Hauptstrasse, 214, during the rise of European national movements. Grabar's maternal grandfather (Adolf Dobryansky) was one of the leaders of the Carpatho-Rusinians, striving for incorporation into a unified Russian empire. Dobryansky gave all of his children and grandchildren Russian names, Olga, Vladimir and Igor. Grabar's parents devoted themselves to revolutionary work and were persecuted by the Austro-Hungarian authorities (see The Case of Olga Grabar). His father, Emanuel Ivanovich Grabar ( - 1910)- was a volunteer in the militia of Lajos Kossuth. Thereafter, Emanuel Grabar obtained a legal education in the Hungarian University at Pest and was admitted to the bar. In 1869, he was elected as a deputy to the Hungarian parliament to represent the Hungarian-Russian district of Máramaros County. For some time, Emanuel Grabar published the satirical journal The Owl «Сова», successfully publishing six editions prior to being censored and abolished by the government. The persecution led to the family's emigration in 1871. At first the family immigrated to Italy, where over the course of three years the children had a personal tutor in the form of a patriarch Terletsky, serving the colony of Carpathian emigrants. Afterwards, the family immigrated along with the colony to Paris. In 1876, Emanuel Grabar arrived in Russia and began teaching under the pseudonym Khrabrov (Храбров), specializing in modern languages, first in Egorevsk, then in Ryazan, followed by Izmail, and finally Tartu (1893–1918http://www.ester.ee/record=b3526284), where he was appointed the deputy rector of the university.

Besides his focus on the science and technology behind this evolution, the author also discusses its effects on Internet companies. The book was published by Harvard University Press in 2009. Overview Stibel first debunks common beliefs about the brain. From a physical basis, he clears up the misperception that the brain is mainly grey matter (it turned out to have more white matter). From a biological basis, he explains that the brain uses nothing more than electricity and chemistry to create intelligence. From a cognitive perspective, he debunks a number of myths about the brain, such as the adage that only 10% of the brain is used. Stibel also argues that the brain is a technical wonder, saying that its hardware is billions of interconnected neurons densely interconnected in rich but disassociated “neural networks.” Its software is richer still (a semantic network) and has developed throughout the cerebral cortex to create memories, category formation, and ultimately consciousness. The Internet, Stibel argues, is a replication of the brain—the hardware being millions of computers connected like neurons to one another, and the software being the World Wide Web and the surrounding infrastructure that build a rich semantic network (the semantic web). He acknowledges that the Internet, the Web, and the intelligence of the Internet and the Web are in their infancy, at least from an evolutionary point of view, but says that they are growing fast. The book also criticizes the term artificial intelligence. Stibel claims that the word itself is misleading, causing people to associate A.I. with something fake or “less than” intelligent. Instead, he says that what is needed is an artificial brain to create real intelligence, “much in the way that an artificial heart is used to create a real heartbeat.” The book's first section outlines the scientific basis for the development of the Internet as a brain. Stibel reviews the works of Daniel Dennett and James A. Anderson, whom he calls his mentors. He builds on Richard Dawkins’ theory of memes by saying websites are spreading memes across the web in the same way that thoughts spread among minds. Stibel also outlines arguments from Steven Pinker, Ray Kurzweil, Nova Spivack, John Brockman, Douglas Hofstadter, Nassim Taleb, and Marvin Minsky. The book's second section provides case studies to support and expand the first section's claims. Stibel outlines a theory for decision making on the web, using examples from Netflix, Amazon.com, and Google. He argues that the Internet has, and will continue to go through, fits of creative destruction, much like human memory succeeds because of its fallibility. The book then focuses on Internet search and the linguistic underpinnings of the web, using the development of Google by Larry Page and Sergey Brin as a case study. Stibel then provides a cross-section of the social networking space, saying that it has evolved in line with neural network theory, which he caps off with a display of Facebook’s “network of networks” approach to the brain. The final section is prospective and provides an outlook for the next 10 to 20 years. Stibel discusses a new technology called Braingate—a chip implanted into the brain that allows people to control electrical devices with their thoughts. The book’s vision for the future focuses less on the grave concerns and risks associated with an “artificial intelligence” than on the prospect of creating new intelligence. Stibel believes that Moore’s law, Metcalfe's law, and many of the other laws that described hyper-growth during the early years of the Internet will break down. At that point, the hardware of the Internet will have evolved and the real advances will all be driven from the software of the World Wide Web. This is where rapid spurts of intelligence will come from, just as the brain leapt forward after it began growing semantically instead of physically (presumably with the development of the cerebral cortex). For the Internet, the final chapter of the book provides a detailed look into the next 20 years of the Internet and how it will evolve into increasing levels of intelligence and eventually forms of consciousness.

The Mexicans were beaten back from an attack on the Mott house at 10 PM and the south end of Main street, the Mexicans retiring only at daylight. 20 November was quiet until sunset, when the Mexicans attacked, attempting to capture the American gun and gain the roof of the fort, but grape shot, canister shot and musket fire stopped the attack. On 21 November, the whalers Magnolia and Edward arrived, and the Mexican force withdrew after the discharge of the whalers' guns. Aftermath Upon hearing of the attack at San José del Cabo, Commodore Shubrick sent the storeship USS Southampton and the first-class sloop-of-war to reinforce Heywood's men. The Southampton arrived on November 26 and the Portsmouth on December 3. Captain Pineda, facing two defeats, one at La Paz where he personally commanded the battle, recalled his company from San José and decided to escalate his attack strength, first at the Siege of La Paz and then again at the Siege of San José del Cabo. For his brave action, the Mexicans consider the death of Lieutenant Mijares as heroic and have placed a monument to honor him on the main street of San José del Cabo, which is called Boulevard Antonio Mijares.

History Shortly after the formal establishment of the Catholic hierarchy in South Africa in 1951, it was first proposed to found a Catholic university in the country. The idea was taken a step further in 1993 when a discussion group – initiated by Professor Emmanuel Ngara, then the Deputy Vice-Chancellor at Fort Hare University, and including Catholic academics, clergy and business persons – began seriously to consider the matter. In June 1997, a Board of Trustees was constituted to guide the process, and, in November 1997, a Section 21 Company (not for profit) was registered. The name chosen for the proposed institution was ‘St Augustine’ – a conscious link to the African context, St Augustine of Hippo being one of the earliest Christian scholars produced by the continent. Having received recognition and accreditation with the South African Department of Education, on 13 July 1999, St Augustine was officially opened by the Deputy Minister of Education. St Augustine was canonically recognised by a decree of the South African Bishops’ Conference in 2008; in the same year, it was recognised by the Congregation for Catholic Education, in the Vatican, as a Catholic University. Being Catholic, St Augustine operates in conformity with the provisions of the Code of Canon Law and the 1990 Apostolic Constitution of Pope John Paul II, Ex Corde Ecclesiae.  Motto  The motto of St Augustine College is ‘Intellige ut credas’. According to St Augustine of Hippo, the two dimensions, faith and reason, should not be separated nor opposed, but rather go forward together. After his conversion, St Augustine held that faith and reason are ‘the two forces that lead us to knowledge’ (Contra Academicos, III, 20, 43). To this end the two famous Augustinian formulae (Sermons 43; 9) express this coherent synthesis between faith and reason: Crede ut intelligas (‘believe that you may understand’) – faith opens the way to step through the door of truth – but also, and inseparably, intellige ut credas (‘understand that you may believe’) – in order to find God and believe one must scrutinise truth. It is this second formula that was chosen as the motto of St Augustine College. In Ex Corde Ecclesiae, Pope John Paul II emphasises the relevance of the Augustinian formulae for Catholic universities: they ‘are called to explore courageously the riches of Revelation and of nature so that the united endeavour of intelligence and faith will enable people to come to the full measure of their humanity, created in the image and likeness of God, renewed even more marvellously, after sin, in Christ, and called to shine forth in the light of the Spirit’.  Campus  When it first opened, St Augustine was situated in rented property on the site of the old Union Observatory in Johannesburg. Thanks to the support of the Catholic Diocese of Rottenburg- Stuttgart in Germany, in 2001, St Augustine purchased its present campus from the Holy Family Centre, at 53 Ley Road in Victory Park, Johannesburg.  Governance and administration  In compliance with the South African Higher Education Act (Act No 101 of 1997) and its own Statutes, St Augustine is governed by a board of directors. The current Chairman of that Board is Brian Scallan. The Grand Chancellor of St Augustine is the ceremonial head, who, in the name of St Augustine, confers all degrees. The current Grand Chancellor is the Jabulani Adatus Nxumalo OMI, Archbishop of Bloemfontein. (Although not a formal office bearer of St Augustine, Wilfrid Cardinal Napier OMI, Archbishop of Durban, is the Patron.) The President is the chief executive officer of St Augustine and is responsible for the day-to-day running of the institution; the President is accountable to the board of directors. The founding president of St Augustine was Professor Edith Raidt, a Schoenstatt religious sister and renowned expert in the history of the Afrikaans language. Professor Raidt was succeeded on her retirement in 2008 by Rev Dr Michael van Heerden, a Catholic priest. The third president, Dr Magdalene (Madge) Karecki, an American religious sister and expert in missiology, was succeeded in August 2015 by the current president, Professor Garth Abraham, a South African international law scholar. The responsibility for regulating all teaching, research and academic functions of St Augustine lies with the Senate. The Academic Dean is responsible for leading the planning and implementation of existing programmes, and for the further development of curricula. The Registrar directs the academic administration of St Augustine and liaises with all relevant state departments to ensure the continued registration and accreditation of its academic offerings. tAcademic Dean was Professor Nicholas Rowe, a graduate of both MIT and Boston College, and the Acting Registrar was Professor Marilise Smurthwaite, Head of the Department of Applied Ethics and Peace Studies.  Degrees and courses offered  The academic programme at St Augustine is offered through five departments: Theology, Philosophy, Applied Ethics and Peace Studies, Education, and Undergraduate Studies. At the post- graduate level, the following degrees are offered: BA (Hons) in Philosophy; BA (Hons) in Peace Studies; BTh (Hons); MPhil in Theology; MPhil in Applied Ethics; MPhil in Culture and Education; DPhil in Philosophy; DPhil in Theology. At the undergraduate level, the BA and the BTh are offered. All degrees are approved and accredited by the South African Council for Higher Education, the South African Qualifications Authority, and the South African Department of Higher Education and Training. St Augustine also offers the Higher Certificate in Biblical Studies (through contact and distance learning), and a variety of short courses for lifelong learning.  Academics  Apart from the academic staff permanently attached to St Augustine, contributions are regularly made by visiting academics. St Augustine is home to the Africa Peacebuilding Institute (API); a ‘virtual’ institute – founded with the assistance and expertise of the Mennonite Central Committee – that provides regular training on civilian peacebuilding capacity. Those who have received training through the API are to be found across the world, including in the United Nations and regional peacebuilding organisations. St Augustine is recognised as a Research Institution (19 August 2010) by South Africa's National Research Foundation; the academic staff publish regularly in their fields of interest and expertise. The in-house journal of the institution is the bi-annual The St Augustine Papers. In addition to its collection of electronic material and its collection of relevant journals, the St Augustine library holds in excess of 40,000 books. Within the library is the ‘Grimley Library’, a unique collection of 1,665 books addressing Theology, Philosophy and Liturgy, brought to South Africa by Rev Dr Thomas Grimley, the second Catholic Bishop of Cape Town; the collection is one of the oldest in South Africa, including many titles that date back to the 17th and 18th centuries.  Bonum Commune Award  The Bonum Commune Award is the highest that St Augustine is able to bestow; it seeks to honour those who have made an outstanding contribution to the common good, or who have made a significant and exceptional contribution to the academic endeavour, particularly those who have contributed in some way to the welfare and improvement of society. To date, the following persons have received the award: * Pius Ncube, Archbishop of Bulawayo (November 2005) * Walter Cardinal Kasper, President of the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity (November 2006) * William Lynch, businessman, Johannesburg (November 2007) * Karl Cardinal Lehman, Bishop of Mainz (February 2008) * Prof Gustavo Guiterrez OP, Priest and Theologian, Peru (February 2008) * John Kane-Berman, Director of the South African Institute of Race Relations, Johannesburg (April 2010) * Conrad Strauss, businessman, Johannesburg (April 2011) * Kevin Dowling, Bishop of Rustenburg (April 2011) * Brendan Ryan, businessman, Cape Town (June 2013) * Gavan Ryan, businessman, Cape Town (June 2013) * Albert Nolan OP, Priest and Theologian, Johannesburg (May 2015)  International connections  St Augustine is a member of a global network of Catholic universities. Apart from its connection with individual universities, St Augustine belongs to the International Federation of Catholic Universities (IFCU), the Association of Catholic Universities and Higher Institutes of Africa and Madagascar (ACUHIAM), as well as the International Council of the Universities of St Thomas Aquinas (ICUSTA). These connections with the ‘Universal Church’ allow for regular collaboration and exchange programmes.

This understanding is said to be first disclosed to human beings through their practical day-to-day encounters with others, with things in the world, and through language. The phenomenon was described by the German philosopher Martin Heidegger in his landmark book Being and Time. It has been discussed (not always using the same name) by philosophers such as John Dewey, Jürgen Habermas, Nikolas Kompridis and Charles Taylor.Nikolas Kompridis, \\"On World Disclosure: Heidegger, Habermas and Dewey,\\" Thesis Eleven, Vol. 37, No. 1, 29-45 (1994). Some philosophers, such as Ian Hacking and Nikolas Kompridis, have also described how this ontological understanding can be re-disclosed in various ways (including through innovative forms of philosophical argument). First and second order disclosure The idea of disclosure supposes that the meaning of a word or thing depends upon the context in which we encounter it, including the way of life of which it is a part. For example, a table is part of a context with other things that give it its sense or purpose – e.g. chairs, food, a teapot, pencils, books – and we first learn about it through our everyday experience of it in particular contexts. Its meaning is \\"given\\" to us by virtue of its connection to various activities (e.g. writing, eating, conversation), and by qualities (e.g. conviviality) that give it value in relation to such activities. These constitute part of its \\"conditions of intelligibility.\\" The implication is that we are always already \\"thrown\\" into these conditions, that is, thrown into a prior understanding of the things which we encounter on a daily basis – an understanding that is already somewhat meaningful and coherent. However, our understanding cannot be made fully conscious or knowable at one time, since this background understanding isn't itself an object: According to Nikolas Kompridis, the initial disclosure of an ontological world is said to be \\"pre-reflective\\" or first-order disclosure.Nikolas Kompridis, Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future, MIT Press, 2006. However, this so-called first-order disclosure is not fixed, as it can vary across historical time and cultural space. As well, Kompridis has described a kind of second-order or reflective disclosure. Whereas first-order disclosure involves an implicit, unconscious and largely passive relation to meaning, reflective disclosure is an explicit re-working of meaning and the terms used to make sense of ourselves and the world, through the \\"refocusing\\" or \\"de-centering\\" of our understanding. Reflective disclosure is thus a way of acting back upon conditions of intelligibility, in order to clarify or reshape our background understanding. Because of this, reflective disclosure also affects conditions of possibility by impacting on such basic questions as \\"what counts as a thing, what counts as true/false, and what it makes sense to do.\\"Hubert Dreyfus, \\"Being and Power: Heidegger and Foucault,\\" in International Journal of Philosophical Studies 4, 1 (March 1996): 4. cited in Nikolas Kompridis, Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future, MIT Press, 2006. p.126 While some philosophers, notably Jürgen Habermas and Richard Rorty, claim that disclosure is an aesthetic phenomenon (supposedly, neither rational nor cognitive, and therefore not philosophical), disclosive arguments have been employed in many contexts that are not primarily considered literary or \\"aesthetic,\\" and some philosophers have argued for the importance of disclosure's (not to mention, aesthetics') place in human reason, most notably Nikolas Kompridis and Charles Taylor.Fred Dallmayr, \\"Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future, University of Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews.Charles Taylor, Philosophical Arguments (Harvard University Press, 1997), 12; 15. World-disclosing arguments World- disclosing arguments are a family of philosophical argument described by Nikolas Kompridis in his book Critique and Disclosure.Nikolas Kompridis, Critique and Disclosure (MIT Press, 2006) According to Kompridis, these arguments have distinctive forms, sometimes called styles of reasoning,Ian Hacking, Styles of Scientific Reasoning, John Rajchman and Cornel West, eds., Post-analytic Philosophy (New York:Columbia University Press, 1985), pp.145-65. that start with a disclosive approach instead of, or in addition to methods that are deductive, inductive, etc.We can use the word \\"disclosure\\" for this, following Heidegger. And along with this goes a conception of critical reasoning, of especial relevance for moral thinking, that focuses on the nature of transitions in our thought.\\" Charles Taylor, Philosophical Arguments (Harvard, 1995), 15.\\"[D]eductive, inductive, or abductive [logic does] not count as a style of reasoning. This is as it should be... People everywhere make inductions, draw inferences to the best explanation, make deductions; those are not peculiarly scientific styles of thinking.\\" Ian Hacking, Historical Ontology (Harvard, 2002), 90. According to disclosure theorists, these forms of argument attempt to reveal features of a wider ontological or cultural-linguistic understanding (or \\"world,\\" in a specifically ontological sense), in order to clarify or transform the background of meaning and \\"logical space\\" on which an argument implicitly depends.\\"[T]hrough a clarification of the conditions of intentionality, we come to a better understanding of what we are as knowing agents – and hence also as language beings – and thereby gain insight into some of the crucial anthropological questions that underpin our moral and spiritual beliefs... What reflection in this direction would entail is already fairly well known. It involves... our being able to articulate the background of our lives perspicuously.\\" Charles Taylor, Philosophical Arguments\\" (Harvard, 1995), 14-15.\\"[World disclosing] arguments cannot assume that the logical space necessary to rendering visible the inferential relations between the premises and the conclusions already exists; rather, their success depends on the degree to which they can expand existing logical space in order to make room for the conclusions to which they lead.\\" Nikolas Kompridis, \\"World Disclosing Arguments?\\" in Critique and Disclosure (MIT Press, 2006), 119.\\" A major example of this type of argument is said to be that of immanent critique, although it is not the only kind.\\"[Immanent] critique and reflective disclosure are practically indistinguishable, and that is because they are structurally homologous.\\" Nikolas Kompridis, Critique and Disclosure (MIT Press, 2006), 254-255. In deductive arguments, the \\"test\\" of the argument's success are said to be its formal validity and soundness. However, in a world- disclosing argument, the primary criterion for success is the solution of a problem that could not be successfully dealt with under some previous understanding or paradigm, for example, after an epistemological crisis (see Paradigm shift). It is therefore said to be possibility disclosing rather than \\"truth-preserving\\" or \\"truth-tracking.\\"\\"Since we are not dealing with deductive or inductive styles of reasoning (which are truth-preserving, not possibility disclosing), we cannot know in advance what form [they] will take.\\" Nikolas Kompridis, Critique and Disclosure (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006), 174. The \\"claim\\" made by such an argument is that of a new insight, resulting from the adoption of a new stance or perspective that reveals, or discloses a new possibility for thinking and acting.\\"[S]uccessful critique depends not just on showing that x is a disguised effect of y, which effect in turn requires the exclusion or repression of r. For this to be shown in the first place, critique needs to find the normative stance, the new interpretive perspective, in light of which what is familiar is defamiliarized, seen again, as if for the first time.\\" Nikolas Kompridis, Critique and Disclosure (MIT Press, 2006), 254-255. See also \\"The test of disclosure\\" in the same volume, 139-146. Nikolas Kompridis has described two kinds of fallibilism in this regard. The first consists in being open to new evidence that could disprove some previously held position or belief (the taken-for-granted position of the observer in normal science). The second refers to the consciousness of \\"the degree to which our interpretations, valuations, our practices, and traditions are temporally indexed\\" and subject to historical change. This \\"time- responsive\\" (as opposed to \\"evidence-responsive\\") fallibilism consists in an expectant openness to some future possibility. According to Kompridis, world- disclosing arguments are fallible in both senses of the word.Nikolas Kompridis, \\"Two kinds of fallibilism\\", Critique and Disclosure (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2006), 181. Major examples of world disclosing arguments in philosophy are said to include: * Transcendental arguments, in which an understanding of some feature of experience is shown to logically entail certain necessary conceptual pre-suppositions (e.g. Kant's transcendental self; Heidegger's elucidation of ontological being in Being and Time); * Dialectical arguments, where the premises argued from are shown to be logically weaker than the argument's conclusion (e.g. Hegel's master-slave dialectic and T.W. Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment); * Historical ontologies, such as those articulated by Michel Foucault (the historical ontology of power), Jacques Derrida (the historical ontology of meaning) and philosopher of science Ian Hacking (scientific revolutions); and * Forms of argument that, \\"through the use of hermeneutic arguments and creative redescriptions\\" of our practices and cultural paradigms, re-disclose the background of cultural meaning and \\"logical space of possibility\\".Nikolas Kompridis, \\"World Disclosing Arguments?\\" in Critique and Disclosure, Cambridge:MIT Press (2006), 118-121. Other modern philosophers who are said to employ world-disclosing arguments include Hans-Georg Gadamer, George Herbert Mead and Maurice Merleau-Ponty.

He is currently the Victor S. Thomas Professor of the History of Art and Architecture and, since 2008, Senior Fellow at the Society of Fellows at Harvard University. Specializing in Northern Renaissance and 19th-century art, Koerner is perhaps best known for his work on German art. After teaching at Harvard from 1989 to 1999 (as Professor since 1991), he moved to Frankfurt, where he was Professor of Modern Art History at the Goethe University, and to London, where he held professorships at University College London and the Courtauld Institute before returning to Harvard in 2007. His feature film The Burning Child, a documentary combining personal and cultural history, was released in 2019. Education and career Son of the Vienna-born Jewish- American painter Henry Koerner, Joseph Koerner was raised in the Squirrel Hill area of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Vienna, Austria. He graduated from Taylor Allderdice High School in 1976. He attended Yale University where he received his B.A. in History, the Arts, and Letters in 1980. His senior thesis, published in 1983 in German titled Die Suche nach dem Labyrinth (\\"In Quest of the Labyrinth\\"), treated the myth of Daedalus and Icarus from Ancient Greek art and literature through James Joyce, with chapters on Ben Jonson, John Milton, and John Keats. After a Master of Arts in English at Cambridge University (M.A. 1982), where supervised by Frank Kermode he wrote on Joyce's Finnegans Wake, and then a year studying philosophy and German literature at Heidelberg University (1983), Koerner received an M.A. (1985) and Ph.D. in art history at the University of California, Berkeley in 1988. In articles on topics ranging from early Chinese bronzes through Renaissance painting to Romanticism and contemporary art, Koerner focused on problems of meaning and developed a distinctive technique: fine-grained analysis of the effect images have on the beholder combined with historical accounts of how and why this effect was engineered. Koerner used this technique most extensively in the opening chapters of his first art history book, Caspar David Friedrich and the Subject of Landscape (1990, Winner of the 1992 Mitchell Prize)—written while the author was a Junior Fellow at Harvard’s Society of Fellows.Debretts Koerner was a member of the research group Poetik und Hermeneutik in Konstanz in its later phase, 1987-1994, writing on the themes of festival and contingency, or accident. Caspar David Friedrich and the Subject of Landscape became the third volume of Koerner’s trilogy on German art. The first volume, The Moment of Self-Portraiture in German Renaissance Art (1993), studied Albrecht Dürer’s self-portraits and their distortion by Dürer’s disciple, Hans Baldung Grien. The second volume, The Reformation of the Image (2004), focussed on works by Lucas Cranach, and treated Protestant iconoclasm and its aftermath in painting and architecture. Among its claims was that, prior to Protestantism, Christian art had iconoclasm built into it, most centrally in the image of the ruined Christ as crossed-out God. While writing the latter book, Koerner collaborated with Bruno Latour and Peter Weibel on the 2002 exhibition \\"Iconoclash\\" and the 2020-21 exhibition \\"Critical Zones\\" at the ZKM in Karlsruhe. He has also curated exhibitions of his father’s work, including a 1997 retrospective at the Austrian National Gallery. In the 1990s, he was a frequent contributor to The New Republic. He has published non-fiction in Granta Magazine and book and exhibition reviews in The New York Review of Books. In Great Britain, Koerner is known for his work as writer and presenter of the three-part Northern Renaissance (2006) and the feature-lengthVienna: City of Dreams (2007), both produced in Scotland by the BBC and broadcast on BBC Four. A popular speaker, Koerner has delivered the Slade Lectures at Cambridge (2003) and Oxford (2013), the Getty Lectures at USC (2005), the Bross Lectures at University of Chicago (2007), the A. W. Mellon lectures at the National Gallery (2008), the Tanner Lectures on Human Values at Cambridge (2012), and the E. H. Gombrich Lectures in the Classical Tradition at the Warburg Institute (2016). His lectures as the Avenali Chair in the Humanities at U. C. Berkeley (2018) treated Bosch and William Kentridge under the title, borrowed from Kentridge, \\"Art in a State of Siege.\\" Koerner’s most recent publications concern the theme of enmity in the art of Hieronymus Bosch, including the book, based on Koerner's Mellon Lectures in Washington and widely reviewed, Bosch and Bruegel: From Enemy Painting to Everyday Life (2016).Guardian lead review In it, he revisited the dual-artist format of The Moment of Self-Portraiture in German Renaissance Art, though with a different trajectory: from an artistry specializing in hatred (Bosch) to one that predicts a modern ethnographic perspective on the human. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1995) and the American Philosophical Association (since 2008), Koerner has served on the boards of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, the Yale University Art Gallery, the Frick Art Reference Library, the Warburg Institute, Ralston College, and the American Academy in Berlin. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship for 2006-7 and served as Guest Professor at the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz. In 2009, Koerner was one of three recipients of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation's Distinguished Achievement Award, which funds an academic and creative project on homemaking (geographic, architectural, and psychic) in Vienna from Otto Wagner to the present day. Based at Harvard, the project has produced the documentary film directed by Koerner, The Burning Child. IMDbOctober Magazine In 2020 the College Art Association honored him with its 2020 Distinguished Lifetime Achievement Award for Writing on Art.CAA Personal life In 2003, Koerner married Margaret K Koerner (born Margaret Lendia Koster), also an art historian; a previous marriage ended in divorce.He has four children.

These ferns were earlier considered part of either the Athyriaceae, Dryopteridaceae, Aspleniaceae, or Polypodiaceae families or recognized as belonging to their own taxonomic family. The Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) places the genus in the Athyriaceae.

In 1541, Dorothy embarked on a love affair with William Parr, Baron Parr of Kendal, who would later hold the title of 1st Marquess of Northampton, after Baron Parr's wife, Anne Bourchier, 7th Baroness Bourchier had created a scandal when she ran off with her lover, John Lyngfield, and shortly afterwards bore him an illegitimate child. Dorothy's affair with Parr lasted until 1543, when he began to court her niece, Elizabeth Brooke, who had also been one of Catherine Howard's Maids of Honour up until the Queen's execution for High treason.

The school had only 9 students but by the end of 1896 the number had grown to 30. In 1900 CGC became a grant- in-aid school. The Old Girls' Association was inaugurated in August 1915 by then principal Sophia Lucinda Page. Tamil was first taught as a subject in 1916. The following year the school was registered as a fully organised secondary school making it the first school of this type in the north of Ceylon. CGC relocated to its current location on 6 October 1936. In 1945 CGC started providing free education. In 1947 CGC was recognised as a Grade 1 school. Most private schools in Ceylon were taken over by the government in 1960 but CGC chose to remain as a private. As any private school, attending CGC also required donations and term fees. Overview CGC is situated on Main Street in Chundikuli, a south-eastern suburb of Jaffna. Since its founding the school has mainly catered to Sri Lankan Tamil girls. The school is divided into three: a primary school providing specialised education from grades 1 to 5; the middle school for students from grades 6 to 8; and the senior school for students from grades 9 to 12.

D. Katz & Sons, Inc., 643 A.2d 642 (App. Div. 1994), was a case decided by the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey that first applied public policy considerations instead of the touch and concern doctrine when deciding the validity of a restrictive covenant.Casner, A.J. et al. Cases and Text on Property, Fifth Edition. Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2004, p. 1024 Factual background Davidson Bros., Inc. operated several grocery stores in downtown New Brunswick, New Jersey. After vacating one inner city supermarket, Davidson added a restrictive covenant not to compete to the lease for the vacated property. The covenant disallowed the lessee from operating another grocery store in the space.Casner, p. 1020 Decision The New Jersey Supreme Court granted Davidson’s petition for certification and reversed and remanded (to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey) for a trial. In doing so, the Court determined that “rigid adherence” to the “touch and concern” requirement was no longer warranted. It held that enforceability of a covenant would depend on its reasonableness, and that the principle of “touch and concern” is “but one of the factors.” The Court then described eight factors to be considered in resolving the reasonableness issue:https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/4155 at 211 # The intention of the parties when the covenant was executed, and whether the parties had a viable purpose which did not at the time interfere with existing commercial laws, such as antitrust laws, or public policy. # Whether the covenant had an impact on the considerations exchanged when the covenant was originally executed. This may provide a measure of the value to the parties of the covenant at the time. # Whether the covenant clearly and expressly sets forth the restrictions. # Whether the covenant was in writing, recorded, and if so, whether the subsequent grantee had actual notice of the covenant. # Whether the covenant is reasonable concerning area, time or duration. Covenants that extend for perpetuity or beyond the terms of a lease may often be unreasonable. # Whether the covenant imposes an unreasonable restraint on trade or secures a monopoly for the covenantor. This may be the case in areas where there is limited space available to conduct certain business activities and a covenant not to compete burdens all or most available locales to prevent them from competing in such an activity. # Whether the covenant interferes with the public interest. # Whether, even if the covenant was reasonable at the time it was executed, “changed circumstances” now make the covenant unreasonable. The Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey held that the covenant not to compete was invalid because it was against public policy. The availability of supermarkets in inner city areas was essential to fighting urban blight and preventing a Food desert, and this could not be outweighed by the property interests of Davidson.Casner, p. 1024 This usage of public policy grounds instead of the touch and concern doctrine for analyzing covenants predated the same technique used in the Restatement Third of Servitudes.Casner, p. 994 References Real property law 1994 in United States case law New Jersey state case law 1994 in New Jersey United States property case law New Brunswick, New Jersey Food retailing Food deserts Law articles needing an infobox ","title":"Davidson Bros., Inc. v.

In 2014 he was commended for his work building a worldwide risk management programme at the City of London's Risk Management Awards. Early life and education Zerzan was born in the United States. He graduated from the University of Toronto with a double major in politics and economics and subsequently studied financial & commercial regulation at the London School of Economics.  Research and professional life  Zerzan has worked on initiatives at the United Nations, the World Bank and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to transform how the poor move financial assets. He and his colleagues developed the first risk assessment tools to help firms and regulators calibrate responses to the actual risks faced. For this work he was awarded Junior Professional of the Year by the World Bank. At the British Council, Zerzan helped to form a collaboration between The United Kingdom and China. The aim of this partnership is to connect students in industries such as healthcare, food safety, renewable energy and manufacturing. For this reason the British Council and The Ministry of Education have issued funding to nearly 30 universities including Peking University, Dalian University of Technology, the University of Leeds and King's College London. The United Kingdom is becoming a preferred destination for students from China and according to statistics from Universities and Colleges Admissions Service \\"the number of university applicants from China has increased by 30 percent during the current academic year\\". Zerzan has since been widely involved in public discussions on the impact of technology on global development, particularly in the third world. He has given speeches covering mobile banking and financial crimes in developing countries. He has been a Guest Lecturer at the London School of Economics since 2012.

Plot Britney (Crew) is a woman whose profession is to 'break up' with a significant other for people. One day she meets Rick (Benson), a charming gentleman who lures Britney into a relationship with his alluring looks and sly wit. She later discovers that he's the head of another break-up company and is stealing all her customers, which is putting her into debt. He dumps her using one of his staff who claims to be his best friend. Britney is outraged and heartbroken by the abrupt turn of events. She plots and schemes to put Rick out of business. Britney's sister Ashley (Swan) is a flirtatious woman who dumps men at the drop of a hat. Her last boyfriend, Mike (Kennedy), is saddened and distressed when Ashley gets Britney to break up with him for her. Mike teaches art to underprivileged children, and will be entering a mural competition soon. He claims that Ashley is his muse and without her he can only draw crap. He offers to pay Britney $10,000 if she can manage to get Ashley back for him. Britney hesitantly agrees after seeing her overdue bills and mortgage payments. She teaches him what kind of men Ashley likes. He must be unflappable, cool, and not care what others think of him. He must be rich, so Britney gets Mike to act rich. He must be tall, dark and handsome. Britney gives Mike an extreme make-over. He changes his fashion style, his hairstyle, and his attitude. He becomes cooler and more nonchalant around women. They arrange to \\"bump into\\" Ashley at a store and Mike pretends to be on a phone call. Ashley overhears and spins around to talk to him. He acts unflappable and doesn't falter as Britney gives him instructions through a hidden earphone. When Ashley seems impressed by his new look and attitude, Britney is overjoyed but causes Mike to crash into a clothing rack on his way out of the store because she squeals into her microphone. Britney then learns that Rick is dating Ashley. She tries to pull them apart, but Ashley is smitten with the rich, \\"endearing gentleman\\" he appears to be. Meanwhile, Britney's friends and now downsized ex-employers, Robyn (Delain) and Tiffany (Liebert), are also plotting. They get jobs at Rick's company and pretend to work for him. They steal his client list and give it to Britney so she can win back her old customers. Britney realizes that her friends didn't betray her, and are now helping her win back their business. Britney slowly grows closer to Mike. They spend every day together as she coaches him, and they mope together about their broken hearts, eating snacks and watching TV. When Mike is finally ready, they arrange for him to be spotted by Ashley throughout the day, pretending to be oblivious to her. She finally catches up to him outside a dance club, but not before Britney and Mike share a kiss. In the end Mike and Britney get together when he realizes that Ashley is not his muse, but Britney is. He and the children win the mural competition, and Britney's business is back and better than ever. Britney changes her company name to \\"Love Rocks\\" and helps people find love as well as dump their boy/girlfriends. Rick's company falls apart. Then Britney breaks up with Rick for Ashley.

Object The object of Marriage is to be the player with the largest number of points after playing all hands. Everyone draws one card, the high card deals, and the subsequent deals are passed to the left. Three 52-card decks are used without any Jokers. No other wild cards are used. Each player is dealt 21 cards, the remaining stock pile is spread on the table, and the player to the left of the dealer draws the top card from the stock pile to make melds. After a card is drawn, one must be discarded, and the next player to the left has the option of drawing either the top discard or top stock card. Then he must discard. A set consists of three or more cards of the same face value, (e.g. three queens, three aces, or three sevens). A run consists of four or more cards in sequence of the same suit. If there is an ace in the run, it can serve as either a high card or a low card, but not both in the same run. Gameplay Wildcard Selection After dealing 21 cards to each players, a random card is selected from the remaining pile as \\"joker\\" and is kept hidden. Except this joker, there are two more wildcard that are used in game which are called as \\"value\\" i.e. the card ascending and descending the joker of the same suit. For example, if 3 of hearts (3H) is chosen as joker then the \\"value\\" will be 2H—3H—4H and all the 3's will be joker. All \\"jokers\\" and \\"value\\" can be used as wild card in the game. Hands Each hand consists of a combination of sets and runs. The first aim of the game is to make three \\"pure run\\" or \\"pure set\\", after which the player is eligible to see the hidden joker. After seeing the joker the player can \\"show\\" or end the game if all the cards are melded. Melding Melding the cards is the most important part of rummy. A meld must be made using a minimum of 3 card, there is no limit for maximum cards in a meld. Following are the types of melds allowed - 1\\\\. Pure run = 6D 7D 8D 2\\\\. Pure set = 6D 6H 6S 3\\\\. Run using joker or wild card = 6D 7D joker/wildcard 4\\\\. Set using joker or wildcard = 6D 6H joker/wildcard {NOTE : ( 6D 6D joker/wildcard ) is not allowed} 5\\\\. All joker / wildcard can be used = Jo Jo Jo or WC WC WC Eligibility to see the joker A player can see the hidden joker only after showing 3 pure sets or 3 pure runs and keep those sets or runs on table for others players to confirm. After seeing the joker, the player should have at least 3 pure sets or runs with him thought the hand. Meanwhile, those 3 pure sets or runs can be changes with other pure sets or runs, but minimum of 3 is required throughout that hand. After seeing the joker the player also become eligible to use the joker or other wildcard in his hand for making sets and runs. Gameplay A player on his turn pick a card either from discard pile or pile, and discard another card from his hand thereafter. A player can only go down or show after being eligible to see the joker. Once a player has gone down by satisfying the requirements, he may not create any new sets or runs. The deal All players pick a card at random and return it to the deck, with the player who drew the lowest card dealing first. Each hand starts a new deal, with the turn to deal passing to the right from player to player. Cards are dealt one at a time, face down beginning at the dealer's right. The dealer deals 21 cards face down to each player, places the remainder of the pack face down in the middle, and places the top card from the stock pile face up next to it. Play then starts with the player to the dealer's right and proceeds anti-clockwise. The play Beginning with the player to the right of the dealer, a person starts his turn by selecting either the top card from the stockpile or the top card from the discard pile. If the player has not yet opened, and has the necessary cards to meet the eligibility requirements, he may then lay down the sets and runs appropriate for seeing the joker. Having become eligible, the player is then free to play jokers and wildcard onto existing sets or runs. Wild cards may be used to fill in missing cards in a set or a run, and there is no limit to how many wild cards may be used in any set or run. If the player changes his mind as to which cards to play where, only the cards played in the current turn may be picked up for re-use. The end of a turn occurs when a player discards one card onto the discard pile. Play then continues with the next player to the right. Scoring Since Indian Marriage is a game that is won by having the most points, the numeric value of the cards are counted from 2 to 10. Face cards and Aces count as 10 points. The most important part of scoring in Indian Marriage is \\"Value\\". The Value is scores as under :- Joker \\"Value\\" = 4 points Paplu = 2 points Tapulu = 2 points Paplu + Joker (\\"Value\\") + Taplu is calles MARRIAGE = 14 points If any players has not seen the joker than his hand will count as All Count = 14 points or actual counted points, whichever is lower. Note :- 1\\\\. The points of \\"Value\\" will be traded with each Player. For example, if Player 1 has value of 4 points and Player 2 have value of 2 points, then Player 2 will give 2 point to Player, similarly each players will trade their value with each other. 2\\\\. To know more about \\"value\\" please read wildcard section. Rules of play Stock pile depletion It is possible, when many cards have been taken out of turn in a hand (incurring many penalty cards), that the stock pile may dwindle down to nothing before any player has gone out. Should this happen, the discard pile is turned over once, without shuffling, and play continues in order. If the remaining cards in the stock pile are depleted a second time without any player going out, the hand ends and all points remaining in all players' hands are tallied as they would be had someone gone out. Incomplete hands and games If all players agree, a game may be suspended between hands and later resumed. However, play can only resume if all players are available and if the game resumes in the same calendar year as it started. Players must be seated in the same relative positions to each other when the game resumes. Any player not finishing a full game (one or more hands not played to completion) will post a game total equal to the sum of the two highest complete game totals posted by other players in that game. If two other complete game totals are not available in that game, all statistics for that game are discarded. Similarly, any player not providing a score for a particular hand that he or she played will post a score equal to the sum of the two highest scores posted by other players for that hand. If two other scores are not available in that hand, the hand is re-played. Play out of turn If a player going out of turn is not stopped before discarding, it stands as a play in turn and intervening players lose their turns. If the player out of turn has chosen to take the top card of the stock pile, it is too late for rectification after the player has added that card to his or her hand. If it is not too late, as defined, to correct the error, the offender restores the card drawn, takes back any cards that he or she may have played, and play then reverts to the correct person. The rule \\"Illegal Draw\\" may apply. Illegal Draw If a player sees a card to which he is not entitled by playing out of turn or by drawing more than one card from the top of the stock pile, that card is placed face up on top of the stock pile. The next player in turn may either take the card or have it placed face down in the center of the stock pile and proceed to play as if no irregularity had occurred. If more than one card is so exposed at the top of the stock pile, the option of each player in turn is only to take the top such card remaining there, or the top face-down card of the stock pile, or the previous player's discard. That is, players have three options to draw from instead of the normal two for as long as exposed cards remain at the top of the stock pile. A player's illegal draw may not be corrected after discarding, but the section on Incorrect Hand may apply. Premature discard Any player who discards without drawing may then draw from the stock pile to restore their hand to the proper number of cards, but he or she may not lay down any cards after discarding. If the next player in turn has already drawn, the section on Incorrect Hand applies. A player who discards more than one card may retract either one, unless the next player has drawn it or unless the next player has already ended their turn. Incorrect hand *A player with too many cards discards without drawing. *A player with too few cards draws without discarding; one card in each turn until the player's hand is restored to the correct number. This also applies to a player who draws too many cards and adds them to his hand before correction is required. *A player may not lay down any cards in a turn when the hand is still incorrect. *If, after a player goes out, another player has too many cards, he simply counts the value of all cards in the hand. *If a player has too few cards, he is charged 10 points for each missing card. *If any player goes out and is found to have too few cards, they take back all cards that were laid down in that turn, and play continues. Re-deal There must be a re-deal by the same dealer if more than one card is exposed in dealing or if more than one card is found face up in the pack. A player who is dealt an incorrect number of cards may demand a re-deal before drawing in their first turn, but not after that. There must be a re-deal at any time it is discovered that the pack is incorrect, but the results of previous deals are not affected. Cards laid down illegally Any cards which are superfluous in an otherwise correct set or run must be returned to the original player's hand as soon as they are discovered. Any cards that may have been added to the incorrect set or run remain on the table. Play then proceeds as if no irregularity had occurred. Scoring errors An error in scoring a hand may not be corrected after that hand has been mixed with other cards. However, if an error in scoring is discovered when there had previously been no dispute, an agreed upon correction may be made at any time.  Strategy  It must me remembered that the game is won who ever has the highest points in the end. Hence the main aim for every player must be to show the game as early as possible to get maximum points. Getting \\"value\\" points - Another important aspect of this variation is \\"values\\" i.e. wildcards. A major part of scoring will comprise points scored in \\"value\\". Hence every players must watch out what other players are discarding, especially the players who have seen the joker, as they will never discard a joker or wildcard and also will always pick jokers and wildcards from discard pile.

Hirschman, which styles the rhetoric of conservatism in opposition to social change as consisting of three narratives: perversity, futility, and jeopardy, and that, further, these narratives are simplistic and flawed, and cut off debate. After a historical examination of his thesis, he discusses corresponding progressive narratives, and proposes a new framework. Hirschman takes as a starting point the neoconservative critiques of social security and other social welfare programs. Recalling Thomas Humphrey Marshall's theory of the development of citizenship in the West by which civil, political, and social dimensions of citizenship are successively achieved, Hirschman illustrates the rhetoric of reactionaries through citing arguments concerning three major reforms: the French revolution, moves toward universal suffrage in the 19th and 20th centuries, and the concerns over the welfare state in his time.  Reactionary narratives  Hirschman describes the reactionary narratives thus: * According to the perversity thesis, any purposive action to improve some feature of the political, social, or economic order only serves to exacerbate the condition one wishes to remedy (compare: Unintended consequences). * The futility thesis holds that attempts at social transformation will be unavailing, that they will simply fail to \\"make a dent.\\" * Finally, the jeopardy thesis argues that the cost of the proposed change or reform is too high as it endangers some previous, precious accomplishment. He argues that these are \\"rhetorics of intransigence\\", which do not further debate.  Progressive narratives  In the final chapter, Hirschman takes the discusses progressive narratives which he regards simplistic and flawed. * The Synergy Illusion – the idea that all reforms work together and reinforce each other, rather than being competing; * The Imminent Danger – urgent action is necessary to avoid imminent danger; * History Is on Our Side *:Compare: “The arc of history is long, but it bends towards justice,” by Martin Luther King Jr.  Proposal  Hirschman advocates instead these \\"mature\\" bases for discussion: # There are dangers and risks in both action and inaction. The risks of both should be canvassed, assessed, and guarded against to the extent possible. # The baneful consequences of either action or inaction can never be known with certainty but our reaction to either is affected by the two types of alarm-sounding Cassandras with whom we have become acquainted.

A research scientist in the field of superstring theory at the National Center for Physics, Hussain made contributions to the fields of superstring and string theory. He was the first Pakistani physicist to publish a research paper in the field of superstring theory. A prominent social activist and democratic activist, he has authored various scientific research papers in peer-reviewed journals. Education and early life Faheem Hussain was born in Yavatmal, Maharashtra, British India in 1942. His family moved to West Pakistan shortly before the Partition of India on 14 August 1947. He graduated from St. Anthony's High School, Lahore, in 1955 and then enrolled in Forman Christian College. After receiving his double BSc(Hons) in Mathematics and Physics from Forman Christian College in 1960, he moved to the Great Britain. There, he attended Chelsea College, London, and completed another B.S. (hons) in physics in 1963. He attended Imperial College, London where a prominent and illustrious physicist Abdus Salam was also teaching. He began working with Abdus Salam's group at the Imperial College. He completed his MSc in physics from Imperial College, London under Abdus Salam, and followed by his PhD in Theoretical physics under the supervision of theoretical particle physicist Paul Matthews in 1966. Academic career In 1966, at the age of 24, Hussain travelled to the United States and joined 'The Enrico Fermi Institute for Nuclear Studies', nowadays known as The Enrico Fermi Institute. During that time, Hussain met with group of Pakistani physicists at the institute, there he founded \\"The Relativity Group\\", along with Fayyazuddin, Riazuddin, and Peter Rotteli. During his stay in the Institute, he served as an assistant professor at the University of Chicago, Illinois. In 1968, along with \\"The Relativity Group\\" scientists, Hussain went back to Pakistan and joined Quaid-i-Azam University's Institute of Physics. From 1969 till 1975, Hussain joined the \\"Theoretical Physics Group\\" (TPG) and did extensive research at the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC). In 1976, he joined Quaid-e-Azam University's Physics faculty. He taught at Garyounis University, Benghazi, Libya, from 1977 to 1979. In 1985 joined Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron, better known as DESY, in Germany. Prior to this, Hussain moved to Geneva, Switzerland and joined the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). He had also been a visiting professor at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Germany. There, with Juergen Koerner, George Thompson and others, he calculated relativistic-wave functions for hadrons and used Salam's formalism to develop a variant of the heavy quark effective theory. The Mainz group went on to make valuable contributions to the study of heavy baryon decays. ICTP career Hussain joined the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) at the request of Salam. He worked there as a senior staff scientist in Trieste, Italy. There he was originally involved in developing the high energy physics diploma programme, which helps train young graduates from developing countries to start research in physics. He was the head of the office of external activities for six years. Of late, he was working in superstring theory, the physics of extra dimensions and non- commutative geometry. Hussain published extensively in the field of theoretical elementary particle physics. He also published articles and papers to solve the science and technology problems in underdeveloped countries. Politics Hussain had deep interest in national and international politics. He was a staunch anti-imperialist, and vociferously protested against the new wave of the savage neo-liberalism religion of the free market. According to his close associates and friends, Hussain described himself as an \\"unreconstructed Marxist\\". During his stay in the United States. Hussain participated at the mass anti-war demonstration at the University of Chicago. As he moved to Pakistan, Hussain began criticising the Pakistani Army's role in East Pakistan. However, after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto legalised the trade unions in the 1970s. Hussain, together with Pervez Hoodbhoy, formed the student union movement, the \\"People Labour Federation\\" in 1973. The dream of the organisation was to bring the \\"social revolution in Pakistan.\\" Support for democracy in Pakistan After the Coup d'état by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, Hussain publicly opposed Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization of Pakistan and supported democracy in his country. Hussain left Pakistan in 1989 and joined ICTP at the request of Abdus Salam. Return to Pakistan Hussain worked as a senior staff scientist at ICTP from 1990 then took his retirement and returned to Pakistan in 2004. There, he joined the physics research institute, the National Center for Physics. Research in physics Hussain, along with Riazuddin, Fayyazuddin, and Hamid Saleem, carried out a research on the string theory and published extensively in the field of mathematical physics. Later, he moved to Lahore and was offered a position at the Lahore University of Management Sciences or LUMS's science department. He eventually became a chairperson of the Physics Department there. At LUMS, Hussain began his research in noncommutative geometry and superstring theory. There, he formed a \\"Mathematical Physics Group\\" (MPG), the MPG group consists of Pakistan's noted physicists, Asad Naqvi, Tasneem Zehra Hussain, and Amer Iqbal. He there began his work and published articles in the field of Extra dimensions, Noncommutative geometry, and the string theory. Personal life Hussain was married to Jane Steinfels Hussain, an American woman, from 1968 to 1986. He later married Sara Monticone Hussain. Death Hussain was suffering from prostate cancer in 2009. Hussain died on 29 September 2009. He has been paid tribute by some of his close friends, associates and students. Pervez Hoodbhoy, a professor of nuclear physics at the Quaid-i-Azam University paid a tribute to him and said: \\"I think he belonged to the genre of academic intellectuals who believe in changing the world for the better. His research and teaching were instruments of change\\". Abdul Hameed Nayyar, a former professor of solid state physics at the Qaud-e-Azam University, recalled and said: \\"Dr. Faheem Hussain was a scholar, a scientist and a revolutionary at the same time\\". Masud Ahmad, a theoretical physicists, PAEC member and a close friend of his, said: \\"Faheem Hussain was a multidimensional personality of being an accomplished scientist, an excellent teacher and an ideal role model for the young students who took great pains to direct the energy of the youth to intellectual pursuits\\". Asad Naqvi, a professor of mathematical physics at the LUMS, paid heavy tribute to him and commemorate in few words, and said: \\"I am lost after hearing this. I only knew him for about five years, and in that short time, I had grown really fond of him. We are all poorer today, having lost such a lovely person who touched us so deeply\\".

Born in Calgary, Alberta, Nell started ski jumping in 1999 at almost 15 years old (in a sport where the common starting age is as young as 5–6 years old). He improved rapidly, being named to the National development team after only two years of Ski Jumping, and to the Canadian National Team just a year later. He competed with the Canadian National team for three years before taking a year hiatus to pursue academics. Nell was back on the National team for two more years from 2004-2006 after hearing that Canada would field its first Olympic Ski Jumping team since 1992 at the 2006 Olympic Winter Games in Torino, Italy. Nell never competed at the World Cup or World Championships but his best individual result came in the Continental Cup where he finished 6th in the normal hill competition in Calgary in September 2002. He also showed good results at the Junior World Championships in Schonach, Germany in 2002. Nell's late start in the sport meant that though many of the other competitors were several years younger he was likely one of the least experienced. At the age of 17, it would be Nell's last chance to compete at the Junior World Championships. Nell finished off his competitive career after competing at the 2006 Winter Olympics, in all three of the Ski Jumping events. He placed 64th and 65th, respectively, in the qualifying rounds of the normal and large hill individual events. He was also part of the Canadian foursome that finished 15th in the team event. After retiring from the sport Nell returned to school, studying mechanical engineering at the University of Victoria in Victoria, BC. He graduated in 2011 and is now working towards his Professional Engineering designation.

Description C.inspersa A selection of Cheiridopsis species in cultivation in South Africa. C.denticulata C.brownii Most species are clump-forming, a few are shrubby. The leaves are opposite and triangular in section, rarely flattened, the surface more or less velvety, which makes them easy to distinguish from species of the allied genus Argyroderma. Daisy-like flowers open during the day in summer, are borne singly and usually have yellow, rarely purple or red, petals. The name comes from the Greek \\"cheiris\\", meaning \\"sleeve\\". Each succeeding pair of leaves differs from the previous one in form, size, and relative unity of the leaves. Those most united wither in the resting period and form a papery sheath covering the succeeding pair of leaves during dormancy in dry, hot summer. Distribution The genus occurs in the far west of South Africa and Namibia. Here it occurs from the Western Cape Province northwards through the Namaqualand, into Namibia. Cultivation The species are mostly adapted to a very arid, winter-rainfall climate. The tender species C. peculiaris requires cultivation under glass in temperate regions.

Makhdoom was also a feudal lord and tribe chieftain. He was the leading Islamic theologian and the Imam of the Grand Mosque at Thatta. He engaged himself in missionary duties and was famous among Sufis. He wrote Madah Nama Sindh (a book about Islam in Sindhi society and culture), Dirham al-Surrat Fi Wada al-Yadayn Taht al-Surrah (a book based on the Hanafi theology), Al-Baqiyat as-Salihat (a biography of great Islamic figures) and other books.

He belonged to the Qadri order of Sufism, and followed the Hanafi school of thought.

Early life and education Makhdoom belonged to a very traditional, religious and educated family and received basic education from his father Makhdoom Abdul Ghafoor. His father taught him to memorise and recite the Quran. He further learned Persian language and Fiqh at home and travelled to Thatta the centre of education, poetry, spiritual grooming and culture of the time for receiving higher education. It was in the time of the Kalhora dynasty when Sindh was at its peak in reference to rich culture and economic progress. Scholars, poets, intellectuals were found in abundance and such people were very much obeyed, trusted and respected. Thatta had been entirely unique as in the year 1111 Hijri, it had 400 high schools and 1400 mosques and is considered a unique city even today. All this attracted Makhdoom Hashim to come to Thatta and attend Arabic classes from Makhdoom Saeed. Makhdoom Muhammad, by his immense intellect and sharp mind, finished the curriculum which was usually completed in six years, in just six months. This made Makhdoom earn a lot of popularity among the great scholars and common people who used to come and visit him from far away areas and places. So he became a source of attraction for many people and they began to see him as their spiritual master. Makhdoom Muhammad went to Makhdoom Zia uddin Thattvi to learn the science of ahadith and associated matters. It took him nine years to learn Persian and Arabic. Meanwhile, his father Makhdoom Abdul Ghafoor died on 1113 Hijri in the blessed month of Dhul-hajj and was buried in his place at Sehwan. Makhdoom visited Makkah and Madinah and learned exegesis, hadiths, religious fundamentals, tajwid and fiqh. Books He wrote 400 books in Arabic, Sindhi and Persian including: * Madah Nama Sindh (مدح نامه سنڌ): The book contains merits and values of Sindh and Sindhi society in the 18th century. * Dirham al-Surrat Fi Wada al-Yadayn Taht al-Surrah. This is a short book that proves the Hanafi way of keeping hands in Qiyam during prayer is proved by Sahih Hadith. * al-Baqiyat as-Salihat (الباقيات الصالحات): This book describes the biographies of prophet Muhammad's wives and some other great Islamic figures. His authored books are included in the syllabus of Al-Azhar University today as well. Some of his books have recently been translated into Sindhi by Allama Muhammad Idrees Dahiri and Ghulam Mustafa Qasmi, including Madah Nama Sindh, al-Baqiyat as-Salihat and Khamsat at-Tahirah. Alleged miracle On Friday, 12th OF Rajab 1135 Hijri, Makhdoom Hashim was at Madinah and presented greetings at the resting place of Muhammad and reportedly received the greatest gift in the form of reply of the greetings from Muhammad himself: \\"Waalaykum as-salam ya Muhammad Hashim\\". There were two Muhammad Hashims who both felt Muhammad had replied to them alone. To end the confusion they agreed on trying again and this time Muhammad reportedly replied: \\"Waalaykum as-salam ya Muhammad Hashim Thattvi.\\" A Persian phrase describes this event: ::\\"Zaban-e-khalq-e-khuda naqqara-e-khuda ast\\" ::Tongue of mankind is the tongue of God.

Kanaskat was a small facility on the Northern Pacific Railway, today's BNSF Railway, created by the opening of a cut-off between Palmer, Washington and Auburn, Washington, built 1899-1900 by the Northern Pacific's contractors Horace C. Henry and his partner Nelson Bennett. Kanaskat served as a water-stop for steam-powered trains out of Auburn, as well as a small yard and scale for the NP's Green River Branch northward to Kangley, Washington, Selleck, Washington, and Kerriston, Washington, as well as the large mills located just to the south in Enumclaw, Washington and Buckley, Washington. In 1900 the NP built a 2,850-foot passing track, a 1,200-foot house track, a wye connection with the Green River Branch to Kangley, Selleck, Barneston and Kerriston, a fourth class combination station, a second class section house, a 24-man bunkhouse, a double tool house, and a box water tank and standpipe. The ornate Victorian station at this site was burned to the ground in 1944 when a wood stove pipe through the roof overheated and caught fire. It was replaced by an innovative temporary station -– a round-roof box car. After World War Two the Northern Pacific replaced the box car with a solid brick station. This lasted until 1959, when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers were forced to build the Northern Pacific yet another station directly northwest of its postwar structure (due to the line change caused by the Corps of Engineer's Howard A. Hanson Dam at Eagle Gorge). Thus, Kanaskat had the dubious honor of being home to four stations in 90 years. The Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad also crossed through the area, moving north-south from its main line station at Cedar Falls, Washington, south to the large mill at Enumclaw, Washington. Track connections between the two roads were made to the north and south of town. It was named after Kanasket (alternately spelled Kanaskat), a chief of the Klickitat people, who was killed by the U.S. Army ca. 1855-56. Kanaskat-Palmer State Park is just south of the settlement.
